    "text": "2024-01-11 20:34:00\n– Lausanne gets its homeless people off the streets\nIn order to protect around 270 people – including families with small children – from freezing temperatures, snow and icy winds, the city is activating its emergency plan.\nPublished: January 11, 2024, 9:34 p.m\nIn order to find homeless people in Lausanne and protect them from the cold, socio-medical emergency teams are also out at night these days.\nPhoto: Jean-Paul Guinnard (24 Hours)\nThree blankets wrapped around him, the dog with thick, white fur under a cloth next to him: This is how a homeless man is sitting these days in the posh Lausanne shopping street Rue de Bourg. His face sunken, his lips torn, he shudders for hours, even in heavy snowfall. Many passers-by know the man. Individuals approach him and put one, two or five francs in a wooden box. A woman buys him a sandwich in the café next door.\nThe city government wants to prevent homeless people from sitting on the streets of Lausanne in sub-zero temperatures. Especially that they sleep at night in the freezing cold in parks, in alleys or underpasses. On Monday, the city government announced the “Grand Froid” plan.\nSuch images are commonplace in Lausanne, even in winter: a homeless person sleeping in the station underpass.\nPhoto: Patrick Martin (24 Hours)\nSomeone wants to stay outside\nSocial workers provide verbal information about the “Grand Froid” plan. Information sheets are posted at contact points. The man on Rue de Bourg, who doesn’t want to give his name and certainly doesn’t want to see a portrait of himself in the newspaper, also found out about it. He still continues to sleep outside, he says defiantly. He couldn’t go to an emergency shelter because he didn’t have an identity card, and without a card he wouldn’t be allowed in, and his dog wouldn’t be liked there either.\nDue to the cold, the city of Lausanne is currently keeping the L’Espace meeting point open during the day. This measure is part of the “Grand Froid” plan.\nPhoto: Philippe Reichen\nAccording to studies, there are between 220 and 270 homeless people living in the city of Lausanne, which has a population of 150,000, including individual families with small children. According to Eliane Belser, these numbers are “always a snapshot,” so they can change quickly – in both directions.\nLausanne’s “cold plan” also includes allowing homeless people to stay in a heated place in the city almost all the time. L’Espace (the room) is the name of the lounge in the middle of the city center, where hot dinners are served 365 days a week and lunch four days a week. This week it is open throughout the day due to the cold – and is well attended.\nAt the beginning of this winter, homeless people in Lausanne slept overnight in boat storage areas.\nPhoto: Cella Florian (24 Hours)\nJulien Casentini and Youssef Khairi will also be there on Tuesday afternoon. Both spend their nights in shelters for the homeless, both suffer from lung diseases, and both emphasize that the warm place protects them from massive health problems. He has chronic bronchitis and has to go to the hospital regularly, says Casentini. He was diagnosed with tuberculosis at the university hospital, says Khairi. That is also the reason why he is still in Switzerland and has not yet been deported, said the Moroccan. He came to Switzerland eight months ago and initially lived on the street. He ended up in prison because he didn’t have a residence permit. Due to pneumonia, he ultimately had to go to the hospital and was diagnosed with tuberculosis. “I can’t stay outside in this cold,” says the 24-year-old Moroccan. Neither does Casentini. He reveals: “On cold days I often escape to libraries and read one book after the other.”\nBut not all homeless people in Lausanne go to warm places on their own. There are those like the man on Rue de Bourg who live and sleep further outside and thereby put their lives in danger.\nCall to citizens\nIf the emergency plan comes into force, citizens are encouraged to contact the mobile emergency teams of the Center for General Medicine and Public Health at the University of Lausanne using a collection number if they discover a homeless person sleeping outdoors. In such cases, Anna Laget, a nurse and head of an emergency aid team, also responds. “Our teams have repeatedly accompanied people to emergency sleeping places in the last few days,” she says. Laget estimates that around a dozen people are currently spending the night outside. The reasons for this are different. Some wanted to preserve their autonomy or protect their privacy. Others have psychological problems and fear conflicts with other people.\n“In such cases, we look at how those affected are dressed and covered, whether they have eaten something warm and whether they are lying in the open air or are at least somewhat protected by a roof or other insulating material such as wood,” says Laget. You also measure your body temperature. If hypothermia is diagnosed, emergency sleeping quarters are no longer an option. “We then call the emergency medical service and, depending on the emergency doctor’s assessment, transfer those affected directly to the hospital.”\nFor now, the “Grand Froid” plan in Lausanne continues. But next week the temperatures are likely to rise above the zero degree limit again at night and the protective measures will end.\nHomelessness in SwitzerlandPhilippe Reichen has been a western Switzerland correspondent based in Lausanne since 2012.

    "text": "Farmers treat crops with fertiliser, use apps for precision, trucks to get the stock off and Deep Heat to help with the aches and pains.\nThere is even myxo for the rabbits and, sometimes, water delivery to cut through the drought.\nBut far too many producers delay seeking help for their own mental health, as they might put off pulling weeds or covering silage pits.\nSo bad has the situation snowballed, following years of fluctuating input and market prices, natural disasters, geopolitical shocks and even a pandemic, that it has become a crisis so pervasive that half of Australia's farmers have now contemplated self-harm or suicide.\nNearly a third of those have taken the next step by attempting to hurt themselves physically or end it all.\nEven when help is available, research shows that farmers are still only half as likely as other rural Australians to have seen a mental health professional over a 12-month period.\nAnd usually only then if they feel the specialist understands the farming way of life.\nTo this end, the Coalition has vowed to create a band of state-based mental health professionals dedicated to addressing the mental health concerns of farmers if it wins the federal election.\nUnder the plan, to be announced on Thursday, $7.9 million would be set aside to place seven mental health specialists in Medicare mental health centres in regional areas in each state and territory.\nNationals leader David Littleproud said these professionals would be equipped with the skills to deliver tailored advice to patients based on an understanding of their unique experiences.\n\"Our farmers are resilient and do a fantastic job, but it's a tough job and we know they face challenging circumstances,\" he said.\n\"Mental health not only affects farmers, but also their families and rural communities. This support will assist in building resilience in the community.\"\nHe said these specialists would act as a conduit between the medical centres and regional hubs and also advise the centres on what extra support the state's farmers need.\nWide Bay pineapple farmer Col Hawken said access to better mental health facilities would be welcomed by many farmers.\n\"Farmers' mental health is a growing concern in the rural sector, given the lack of help that (government) departments are giving,\" he said.\nIf you or anyone you know needs help:\nLifelineamp;source=gmail&ust=1745463623297000&usg=AOvVaw2nXWQl41HKxMWaGGtUbgDe\">Lifeline on 13 11 14Kids Helplineamp;source=gmail&ust=1745463623297000&usg=AOvVaw3dFwlHQIAZhy4FpmVorsWh\">Kids Helpline on 1800 551 800Beyond Blueamp;source=gmail&ust=1745463623297000&usg=AOvVaw2XPWmKdUIGtPcmjMBjIGmV\">Beyond Blue on 1300 224 636Suicide Call Back Serviceamp;source=gmail&ust=1745463623297000&usg=AOvVaw1zprY_rMevWNoQhWaUeoYQ\">Suicide Call Back Service on 1300 659 467Headspaceamp;source=gmail&ust=1745463623297000&usg=AOvVaw3Rk4Ddl5YkJHytENNUKvip\">Headspace on 1800 650 890- ReachOut at\nau.reachout.comamp;source=gmail&ust=1745463623297000&usg=AOvVaw1eh1EEEsMtUNVgywlaQVse\">au.reachout.com MensLine Australiaamp;source=gmail&ust=1745463623298000&usg=AOvVaw3GUcbOOWUyF3I8f5BCyJ9B\">MensLine Australia on 1300 789 978Care Leavers Australasia Network (CLAN)amp;source=gmail&ust=1745463623298000&usg=AOvVaw1840-hDztQrAvGp3YiO6P0\">Care Leavers Australasia Network (CLAN) on 1800 008 774- Head to Health at\nheadtohealth.gov.auamp;source=gmail&ust=1745463623298000&usg=AOvVaw2hRNt6y5QAF5TZNyuhlorp\">headtohealth.gov.au - ifarmwell at\nifarmwell.com.au/farmer-friendly-mental-health-resourcesamp;source=gmail&ust=1745463623297000&usg=AOvVaw2nkc1XMgb7EllEMllH3q96\">ifarmwell.com.au/farmer-friendly-mental-health-resources - Farmer Health Support Hub at\nfarmerhealth.org.au/support-hubamp;source=gmail&ust=1745463623297000&usg=AOvVaw3HzQxQx4jjRDbb9Aq8CX7Q\">farmerhealth.org.au/support-hub",

    "title": "El crudo análisis de Diego Latorre a la actualidad de River en el campeonato: \"Su realidad es horrible\" | 442",
    "text": "Horas después de la derrota de River Plate en Mendoza ante Godoy Cruz en cotejo correspondiente a la séptima fecha de la Liga Profesional , aparecieron muchísimas críticas en contra de Martín Demichelis y una de las más fuertes fue presentada por Diego Latorre durante el programa televisivo ESPN F90.\nEn este escenario, el exfutbolista hizo una fuertísima crítica en contra del cuadro del barrio de Núñez. “ Un equipo no puede jugar 15 minutos bien y después volverse totalmente desconocido y no tener ningún tipo de respuesta. Ahí se ve que la situación es tensa y grave. Ya son muchos partidos así. Creo que el entrenador nunca encontró el equipo ni le generó convicción”, dijo.\n“ La convicción no solamente es hacer las coas bien, sino también reaccionar cuando las cosas no salen . Ahí es donde aflora la personalidad de un equipo. No siempre jugamos el partido que queremos. River demuestra lo peor de su presente en esos momentos, su realidad es horrible cuando las cosas se le tuercen”, añadió.\nEn esta sintonía, Latorre hizo fuertes cuestionamientos a Demichelis y remarcó que un entrenador no puede demorar tanto tiempo en la conformación de un equipo sólido teniendo presente lesiones y el rendimiento de los integrantes de su plantilla.\n\"Me parece esencial que un DT decida quienes juegan con quienes. La táctica es saber asociar a los jugadores. Uno no funciona solo dentro de la cancha… Yo creo que Demichelis le transmitió a muchos jugadores la mentalidad de suplente ”, aseguró.\nPor último hizo un análisis contundente sobre el actual momento del club en el torneo local. “ Hay equipos que puede atacar mal y defender bien o viceversa. Pero River no es ese equipo. River ataca mal y por eso defiende mal ”, cerró.\n¿Cuándo será el próximo partido que tendrá River en la Liga Profesional? El siguiente reto del cuadro de la Banda Cruzada será el próximo domingo 28 de julio. Este encuentro se va a estar disputando en el estadio Monumental donde estará esperando a Sarmiento de Junin.\nSe debe añadir que el compromiso se jugará desde las 18.30 y tendrá la transmisión en vivo y en directo por parte de ESPN Premium.\nGM",

    "title": "Tories blast Trudeau for ‘lavish’ retreat at Sudbury Holiday Inn",
    "text": "The Conservative Party of Canada is putting Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on blast for what they describe as a “lavish” and “swanky” retreat at a Sudbury Holiday Inn. “Today, Justin Trudeau took a surprise trip up to Sudbury to appease his Liberal MPs from Ontario at their swanky retreat before the summer ends, where they will discuss ways to make life more costly and miserable for Ontarians, especially those in Northern Ontario,” according to an email sent by party media relations manager Sebastian Skamski on Wednesday evening. The email, titled “Trudeau’s lavish retreat,” also criticizes the Prime Minister for not holding a media availability. Liberal Party of Canada members have been in Sudbury all week, Sudbury Liberal MP Viviane Lapointe’s senior communications advisor, Hailey Short, clarified to Sudbury.com today. Ministers toured various locations in the region on Monday and Tuesday, including those in the mining sector. Tourism Minister Soraya Martinez Ferrada [visited downtown Sudbury](https://www.sudbury.com/local-news/feds-announce-indigenous-tourism-economic-development-funding-9343355), where she announced funding for Indigenous tourism and economic development. The Liberal Party of Canada’s Ontario Caucus meetings began on Wednesday and conclude today. On Wednesday, Liberals were in meetings at the Holiday Inn all day, during which [Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stopped by](https://www.sudbury.com/local-news/trudeau-dropped-by-sudbury-for-meeting-with-liberal-mps-today-9352680) to participate. Today, Liberals are meeting at one of Science North’s board rooms for their second day of meetings. “That’s basically it,” Short said, adding that this must be the lavishness the Tories referenced. Sudbury.com reached out to Skamski this morning for more insight regarding the Conservatives’ use of the words “swanky” and “lavish” to describe the Liberals’ Sudbury retreat, but did not receive a response. This story will be updated in the event a response is received. “All political parties have caucus meetings, and they just so happen to be here this year,” Nickel Belt Liberal MP Marc Serré’s office clarified in a written response to Sudbury.com. “These meetings are standard... Not sure where they get their benchmark status of ‘lavish.’” Sudbury.com asked Skamski how much the Conservative Party of Canada’s September 2023 policy convention and caucus meeting in Quebec City cost taxpayers, but did not receive a response. [The CBC reported](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/political-parties-spending-rules-1.7204136) in May that a House of Commons bill totalling $426,283 was filed, including $331,699 for travel, $71,408 for accommodations and $21,053 for meals and incidentals. In his email to media, Skamski criticized what he described as other “lavish getaways” the Liberals have embarked on, such as a September 2022 caucus meeting in St. Andrews, New Brunswick, which he said cost at least $428,000, and a September 2023 caucus meeting in London, Ontario, which cost $314,552 “that we know about so far.” Skamski also criticized the Liberals for their upcoming “lavish” national caucus retreat planned to take place on Vancouver Island in September. He closed his email by citing statistics around “Trudeau’s Housing Crisis” and “Trudeau’s Crime Wave,” wherein local [housing costs have skyrocketed](https://www.sudbury.com/local-news/home-ownership-on-the-decline-in-greater-sudbury-9078698) and [violent crime has spiked](https://www.sudbury.com/local-news/violent-crime-hit-record-high-in-greater-sudbury-last-year-9144335) under the Liberals’ watch in recent years.

(Travis Burke/CBC) As the days turned into almost a week away from home, residents who had to flee quickly were asking for things like diapers, toddler shoes and underwear.\nThe community has been stepping up since the evacuation order was issued – cooking and serving meals three times a day for evacuees and hosting people from Fort Good Hope in their homes.\nFinding comfortable accommodation for everyone as the days stretch on has been difficult.\nRegina Lennie said she was initially sleeping in someone's garage, but has since been put up in a hotel with her grandson.\n\"I had a rough couple of days ... it's too stressful for me,\" Lennie said.\n\"But the food and everything they're doing for us, makes the stress less,\" she said. \"It's hard, I want to go home. But it needs to be safe before we go home. And so we'll stick it out I guess. What other choice do we have?\"\nTeachers are still working too.\nAlthough last Thursday was the final day of school for kids in Fort Good Hope, teachers still need to submit report cards.\nNorman Wells mayor says he wants N.W.T. government to step in to support evacuees Fort Good Hope, N.W.T., wildfire now headed toward 2017 burn area, away from community Fort Good Hope teacher Betty Barnaby has been working each day to finalize report cards for kids so they can get them when they go home.\nBarnaby said she couldn't continue to do her job without the support of people in Norman Wells.\n\"It's amazing, amazing to see people step up and help out.
