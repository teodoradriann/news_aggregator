    "title": "45-mile Dragon Trail now open in Newaygo, Mecosta Counties",
    "text": "BROWER PARK, Mich. — The long-awaited, long and winding Dragon Trail is now fully open. Built for hiking and mountain biking, the 45-mile trail wraps around the Hardy Dam Pond in Newaygo and Mecosta counties, featuring sharp switchbacks and sprawling overlooks along a path that meanders through Michigan forests, including an old-growth white pine. The two-direction, natural-surface trail of \"intermediate\" difficulty will be open year-round. Trailheads can be found at county parks, including Brower and Davis Bridge parks. \"A lot of science, a lot of art,\" said Nick Smith, the director of parks and recreation in Newaygo County, describing the route drawn by Spectrum Trail Design, an Indianapolis-based company. \"When you build a trail, you don't just go straight down a hill,\" Smith said. \"When our trail designers and builders came through the area, they looked for those existing natural features to complement and make the trail stronger.\" Planning for the trail began in 2009. Ten years later in 2019, construction started. In 2024, the trail's final sections were finished, completing the 45-mile path. Located almost entirely on land owned by Consumers Energy, the Dragon Trail is segmented into eleven different sections. Segment one, for example, contains an ADA-accessible path, while segments seven and nine are for more experienced mountain bikers. \"To be at the finish line is just a phenomenal feeling,\" said Jeff Abel, the superintendent for Mecosta County Parks. \"For not just us as parks directors, but for everyone that had the initial idea of this trail becoming a reality.\" Abel says Mecosta and Newaygo counties will annually set aside a combined $10,000 for future improvements, though they're not the only ones investing in the outdoors. The West Michigan Mountain Biking Alliance will weekly maintain the trail. \"The people that are going to come and visit this trail, they're going to want to stop somewhere before they get here. They're going to want to stop somewhere afterward,\" said Abel, describing the economic benefit of the Dragon Trail. \"The real bonus: You don't have to drive four-and-a-half hours to find those things we now have right here in the Lower Peninsula,\" Abel said.

    "title": "Guerra vuelve a Moscú con nuevo ataque de drones",
    "text": "Agricultores polacos se manifiestan sobre los cruces fronterizos con Ucrania Ucrania lanzó uno de sus mayores ataques con drones contra Moscú la madrugada del miércoles. El ataque formó parte de una serie más amplia de ofensivas en territorio ruso, con un total de 45 drones ucranianos derribados, incluidos 11 en Moscú, 23 en Briansk, seis en Bélgorod, tres en Kaluga y dos en Kursk. Este último asalto a la ciudad sede del Kremlin, que recuerda a un ataque similar en mayo de 2023, marca una nueva fase en la estrategia de Kiev para acercar la guerra al corazón de Rusia. Los informes preliminares no indican víctimas, pero la magnitud de la operación subraya la creciente capacidad de Ucrania de atacar la capital rusa, que había estado en gran medida aislada de la guerra. El ataque con drones coincide con la ofensiva terrestre de Ucrania en la región occidental de Kursk, donde las fuerzas ucranianas han realizado sorprendentes avances en territorio ruso. Esta ofensiva, que comenzó el 6 de agosto, ha dado como resultado el control ucraniano sobre aproximadamente 1,263 kilómetros cuadrados, incluidos 93 asentamientos. El éxito de la incursión en Kursk ha elevado la moral en Ucrania y ha alterado la dinámica del conflicto, siendo la incursión extranjera más importante en suelo ruso desde la Segunda Guerra Mundial. La respuesta de Rusia a la ofensiva en Kursk se ha visto obstaculizada por desafíos logísticos, en particular después de la destrucción por parte de Ucrania de puentes clave sobre el río Seim. Las fuerzas ucranianas han aislado a las tropas rusas en la región, lo que ha ralentizado su capacidad para contrarrestar el avance. Las autoridades rusas han evacuado a más de 120,000 civiles de la zona, al tiempo que intentan reforzar sus posiciones con tropas redistribuidas desde otras regiones. A pesar del aparente éxito de las operaciones transfronterizas de Ucrania, la sostenibilidad a largo plazo de estos avances sigue siendo incierta. Además, la élite política rusa, incluido el expresidente Dmitri Medvédev, han descartado la posibilidad de negociaciones y han prometido seguir luchando hasta la derrota total de Ucrania. En el ámbito diplomático, el presidente ruso, Vladímir Putin, se reunió con el premier chino, Li Qiang, en Moscú, reafirmando su asociación estratégica en medio de la escalada del conflicto. Mientras tanto, India, un comprador clave de armas rusas, está tratando de fortalecer su papel en la crisis, y el primer ministro Narendra Modi tiene previsto visitar Kiev para analizar posibles vías para el fin de la guerra.",

    "text": "Green Hydrogen – Avalon Energy Launches $380M Agriculture-Sustainable Aviation Fuel Project in Latin America, Backed by Uruguay Govt\nHOUSTON, TX, UNITED STATES, October 1, 2024 / EINPresswire.com / — Avalon BioEnergy Uruguay S.A., a subsidiary of the U.S.-based Avalon Energy Group LLC, is proud to announce the launch of its first fully integrated Agriculture- Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) biorefinery in Latin America, located in Uruguay. This project is endorsed by the Ministry of Environment, and the Government of Uruguay.\nThe proposed SAF biorefinery will significantly contribute to reducing emissions from air travel, offering up to an 80% reduction compared to traditional fossil fuel-based jet fuels. The initiative integrates a sustainable agricultural strategy to cultivate proprietary non-edible oil seed crops alongside green hydrogen production through solar-powered electrolysis, establishing a low-carbon SAF supply chain. This innovative model aligns with global efforts to decarbonize the aviation sector without putting pressure on food commodities for energy use.\nIrshad Ahmed, President & CEO of Auris-Avalon Group of Companies, said:\nThis endorsement from the Uruguayan government is a crucial milestone for the establishment of Uruguay’s first SAF facility,\n“We are honored by the support and excited to position Uruguay as a leader in SAF production. Our aim is to leverage dedicated non-edible oil seed crops to build a sustainable feedstock supply chain contributing to net-zero goals and fostering regional economic growth.”\nThe SAF project, designated as a high-impact clean energy initiative of national interest, has a projected cost of US$380 million (15.5 billion Uruguayan Pesos) and includes plans for a 100,000 MT per year SAF production facility utilizing the Hydrotreated Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) process. It also includes the development of a 50 MW solar power plant to produce green hydrogen, a critical component for SAF production. PRISMECS, a Houston, Texas, United States, based EPC company has been selected to build the solar power and green hydrogen plant. With a proven track record in executing complex energy projects, Prismecs brings cutting-edge engineering and operational capabilities to ensure the project’s success, contributing to Avalon’s vision of creating a low-carbon, sustainable aviation fuel supply chain.\nHonorable Mr. Gerardo Amarilla , Undersecretary of the Ministry of Environment, emphasized the project’s importance:\nAvalon’s SAF biorefinery has the potential to drive sustainable development and innovation in Uruguay.\n“We are committed to supporting initiatives that align with our climate goals and promote clean energy solutions. This project not only reduces our carbon footprint but also strengthens Uruguay’s position as a regional leader in green energy.”\nThe project’s impact extends beyond Uruguay, setting a precedent for sustainable aviation fuel production in Latin America. Honorable Mr. Jorge E. Rodríguez de Mello , the Global Union’s Ambassador at the Uruguayan Embassy, stated:\nThis biorefinery will serve as a model for other countries in the region.\n“We are pleased to work with Avalon Energy Group and help build this important project that will boost both the energy and agriculture sectors of our economy. Uruguay is committed to fostering innovations that advance environmental sustainability and economic prosperity, and we are excited to see the positive outcomes this project will bring.”\nAvalon Energy Group is also developing additional SAF, biodiesel, and green hydrogen projects across the United States, India, South Africa, Eswatini (Swaziland), and Kenya, contributing to the global transition toward a low-carbon economy and supporting the COP26 Net Zero Carbon reduction commitments.\nREAD the latest news shaping the hydrogen market at Hydrogen Central\nGreen Hydrogen – Avalon Energy Launches $380M Agriculture-Sustainable Aviation Fuel Project in Latin America, Backed by Uruguay Govt, source",

    "title": "HUELGA ITV EN ANDALUCÍA | Convocadas ocho jornadas de huelga en todas las ITV de Andalucía",
    "text": "Huelgas Convocadas ocho jornadas de huelga en todas las ITV de Andalucía UGT y CCOO han convocado paros para el 19, 20 y 21, 23, 26, 27, 28 y 30 de septiembre, con el fin de exigir la actualización del convenio colectivo El personal de ITV en Andalucía estará en huelga durante ocho días para exigir así una actualización del convenio colectivo. Este paro está convocado por los sindicatos de [UGT](https://www.laopiniondemalaga.es/tags/ugt-malaga.html) y [CCOO](https://www.laopiniondemalaga.es/tags/ccoo-malaga.html) y se llevará a cabo los próximos días 19, 20 y 21, 23, 26, 27, 28 y 30 de septiembre en turnos completos para exigir la actualización del convenio colectivo, que afecta a unos 2.000 trabajadores. Desde los sindicatos aseguran que las propuestas de la empresa Veiasa empeoran las condiciones actuales. El coordinador regional de UGT Veiasa, Romualdo Barcala, denuncia el continuo retraso en las negociaciones para el nuevo convenio colectivo. El tercer convenio, firmado en 2008, caducó hace 12 años. Un periodo de tiempo en el que se han aprobado nuevas normativas que deben incluirse en el mismo. El conflicto laboral en Veiasa se remonta a meses atrás con posturas muy distantes entre la empresa pública y los sindicatos sobre el convenio colectivo, ya que la Consejería de Industria mantiene que las propuestas sindicales suponen un coste excesivo, mientras que los sindicatos defienden que muchas de las medidas contempladas tienen un coste cero y, entre otras, proponen trabajar de lunes a viernes en lugar de hacerlo de lunes a sábado. Barcala insta a las administraciones públicas a resolver el convenio tras 7 años de negociación: “El único objetivo es conseguir la firma de un IV Convenio Colectivo acorde a la realidad laboral y social de los empleados públicos de Andalucía”, han explicado los sindicatos.

    "title": "La Nación / Sumar: capacitación laboral será clave para la reinserción de personas con adicción",
    "text": "El pasado 21 de diciembre, el Gobierno nacional presentó el plan “Sumar”, un programa integral que convoca a 22 instituciones del Estado para el abordaje de los problemas de adicción desde diferentes aristas. La capacitación laboral es un punto importante para incentivar y promover la reinserción social y laboral de las personas que han caído en las drogas. “Lo que nosotros queremos brindar es oportunidades para las personas que salen de ese proceso e incluso acompañamiento dentro de las penitenciarías para quienes padecen algún tipo de adicción, de modo que ellos se formen y que la vida ociosa esté ocupada a través de la formación y capacitación, que eso sirva posteriormente para poder insertarse no solamente de manera social sino laboralmente”, explicó la ministra de Trabajo, Mónica Recalde. En conversación con La Nación/Nación Media, la titular del Ministerio de Trabajo, Empleo y Seguridad Social (MTESS) detalló que dicha cartera forma parte del plan Sumar dentro del componente económico y de rehabilitación desde el punto de vista de la formación. Las experiencias alrededor del mundo demuestran que la rehabilitación de personas con problemas de adicción debe estar acompañado de un incentivo para una salida laboral.

Tenemos un rol bastante importante dentro de lo que es la rehabilitación y la reinserción de la persona en esa condición”, expresó la ministra.
