    "title": "Oakland A’s closer Mason Miller headed to injured list with fractured pinky",
    "text": "Mason Miller, the A’s All-Star closer and perhaps their most valuable trade candidate, is heading to the injury list with a broken left hand.\nThe rookie right-handed reliever fractured the fifth metacarpal in the pinky of his non-throwing hand after Monday night’s win over the Houston Astros,\naccording to Martín Gallegos of MLB.com. It was initially unclear how Miller suffered the fracture, but Gallegos later clarified that Miller “put his hand down awkwardly on the training table while getting ready to do an exercise.”\nMiller has been placed on the 15-day injured list retroactive to Tuesday. He pitched a perfect ninth inning on Monday to seal the\nA’s 4-0 win over the Astros.\nMiller is in the middle of a sterling season, posting a 2.21 ERA with 15 saves and 15.5 strikeouts per nine innings. He is a potential trade-deadline acquisition for contending teams in need of an elite closer, though ESPN’s Buster Olney recently\nreported that he appears unlikely to be moved by next Tuesday’s trade deadline.\nThe A’s have not given a timeline for Miller’s return, but a metacarpal fracture typically takes at least three to four weeks to heal,\naccording to the British NHS.\nMiller’s bizarre injury is the latest in a line of confusing pitching ailments for the A’s. In 2014, left-handed pitcher Drew Pomeranz broke his right hand while punching a chair after a loss against the Texas Rangers.\nIn 2018, right-handed reliever Shawn Kelley sliced his right thumb on a knife while washing dishes. In 2021, left-handed starter Jesus Luzardo suffered a hairline fracture in his left pinky when he banged his hand against a table while playing video games.\nMost recently, in 2022, right-handed starter James Kaprielian lacerated his right middle finger when putting a shirt on and accidentally hitting a poster on his wall.",

    "title": "Francisco Alvarez’s Mets Extension Delayed by Bad Bunny Legal Case",
    "text": "Sources indicate that the New York Mets were negotiating a long-term extension with their young catching star, Francisco Alvarez, when discussions were abruptly halted due to the decertification of Alvarez’s agency, Rimas, led by Bad Bunny.\nThe agency is embroiled in a legal dispute with the MLB Players Association over its status, as reported by Jon Heyman of the New York Post, but Alvarez has affirmed that Rimas still represents him. It’s unclear when or if the contract discussions will resume.\nOn the field, Alvarez has been a key contributor to New York’s lineup, hitting .278 with four home runs, 24 RBI, and 44 hits in 158 at-bats this season.\nThe Mets, with a record of 53–48, are 10.5 games behind the NL East-leading Phillies. However, they currently hold the second NL wild-card position, narrowly ahead of the St. Louis Cardinals by half a game.\nBad Bunny’s Rimas Sports is facing serious issues with the MLB Players Association. The agency, representing Mets’ Francisco Alvarez and Ronny Mauricio among others, had its main agent William Arroyo decertified after an MLBPA investigation revealed complaints about improper benefits given to players, as reported by ESPN.\nOn April 10, the union also rejected the certification applications of Rimas co-owners Noah Assad and Jonathan Miranda due to alleged violations of agent regulations.\nBad Bunny, together with his manager Noah Assad, established Rimas Sports in April 2023. However, just a week later, the MLBPA received evidence that Rimas employees were giving gifts to players they did not represent, such as VIP tickets to Bad Bunny concerts and suite access to a Phoenix Suns game.\nAdditionally, the union accused the agents of violating regulations by providing or promising money, cars, and gifts to entice players to switch representation.\nIn May, Bad Bunny and Rimas Sports countered with a federal lawsuit against the MLB Players Association, alleging discrimination. The 27-page complaint was filed in the United States District Court in Puerto Rico, where Rimas is seeking a temporary restraining order and injunction to counteract the MLBPA’s sanctions.\nThe agency argues that the penalties were intended to drive the agency out of business and claims the union overstepped its legal authority under the National Labor Relations Act.\nRimas had previously sought a temporary restraining order to lift the penalties imposed on Arroyo, Assad, and Miranda, but an arbitrator rejected their request. The agency filed an appeal of the individual penalties before the May 10 deadline, and the American Arbitration Association will make the decision.\nThe three individuals were barred from reapplying for certification for five years, and the union imposed a $400,000 fine, also prohibiting certified agents from associating with Rimas, the individuals, or any related entities.\nRimas Sports primarily represents Puerto Rican players and features longtime MLB catcher Ivan Rodriguez as an ambassador.\nIn addition to Francisco Alvarez and Ronny Mauricio, the agency’s clientele includes Rockies shortstop Ezequiel Tovar, Giants’ Wilmer Flores, Reds’ Santiago Espinal, Orioles’ Livan Soto, and top Dodgers prospect Diego Cartaya.\nSource: New York Post, ESPN",

    "text": "ELIZABETHTON — State and local leaders came together on the grounds of the former Carter County Workforce Development Complex on a cold Thursday afternoon to break ground on a $40 million state project to be called the Carter County Higher Education Center.\nIt will provide new classrooms and other facilities to support the Carter County campuses of Northeast State Community College and the Tennessee College of Applied Technology Elizabethton. It will also provide accommodations for the Middle College program of Carter County School System, the second largest middle college program in the state.\nThe project will add about 71,000 gross square feet of new space. Buildings will include high-bay training spaces, laboratories, and classrooms It will also have space for administrative, student, and support requirements for academic programs and hands-on instruction.\n“This is a historic occasion,” said Tennessee Board of Regents Chancellor Flora W. Tydings. She praised two people for making the education center possible: Carter County Mayor Patty Woodby and Tennessee Governor Bill Lee.\nTydings said Woodby was “the brains behind the building.” Tydings said Woodby's passion and spirit made it happen. She said the other force that made it possible was when Gov. Lee said “I have decided to run the table on your master plan. We are going to put the whole thing in the budget.” She said that amounted to $1 billion.\nTydings said that when she goes to other parts of the country and talks about the fact that her governor and the state legislature voted to spend $1 billion into the system, they look at her like she is not telling the truth. She said the next thing they ask is if the state floated a bond for the project. She said the state was not borrowing, it was paying cash because Tennessee is the best managed state in the nation, thanks to the legislators.\nShe said two of the best partners in the state education system, the TCAT and the community college, are coming together to make the project into \"a center of higher education learning, where people will come, and they will get a job, and it will change their life and change the lives of their families, and it will change the community. I can’t wait to be back in 2026 to cut the ribbon on this building.”\nMayor Woodby said the education center was the first project she took on when she became mayor. She said the irony is that three years ago on this day, Dec. 5, she had Gov. Lee tour this ground to discuss the idea of building an education center on the site. She said her hope is that this facility will enable “our children to enter into the workforce, but not only have jobs but be able to purchase homes and raise their families in this community. To not have to leave to look for work. We want them to be able to stay here and love our community.”\nSenator Rusty Crowe represented Carter County and told the Johnson City Press “I have to say that Mayor Woodby used Sen. Jon Lundberg and I early on to make this happen. She was laser focused on this approach for our students. We met in my office in Nashville for a call with Chancellor Tydings to try to secure the $40 million appropriation for the project. Mayor Woodby was very convincing. Chancellor Tydings was excited about this approach and she and Gov. Lee made this happen.”\nNortheast State Community College President Jeff McCord and Tennessee College of Applied Technology President Heath McMillian both pledged to be strong supporting partners in the project. McMillian said “the new center and the partnership with Northeast State will help us better serve students and provide more opportunities to gain the skills needed for local careers.”\nMcCord said “Northeast State is proud to be a partner in the Carter County Higher Education Center and looks forward to the positive impact it will have on the prosperity of the people of Carter County. The good things happening on this site will no doubt ripple across the region.”\nThe facility is scheduled to open in fall 2026, with Thompson & Litton, an architectural, engineering, and land surveying firm based in Wise, Va. overseeing the project’s design.",

(Luis Vargas/Cortesía) El nutricionista nos explicó que debido a eso, ellos se encargan de brindar una dieta cruda, que incluye huesos carnosos, carne magra, órganos, frutas y verduras, proporcionando un plato completo con todos los nutrientes esenciales para un desarrollo saludable.\n“Con este tipo de alimentación lo que hacemos es ofrecerles primero que nada una alimentación que cumpla con todos sus requerimientos nutricionales, pero también nos apegamos a la forma en la que se han alimentado sus antepasados durante cientos de miles de años.\nLEA MÁS: Celso Borges nos contó lo enamorado que está de su chuzo y compartió detalles exclusivos\n“De esa forma buscamos simular o hacer algo lo más parecido a la forma en la que ellos podrían alimentarse en forma natural, o sea cazando, casi que les ofrecemos como una presa”, comentó Luis.\nLuis Vargas es papá perruno de seis. (Luis Vargas/Cortesía) Según lo que nos explicó Vargas, este tipo de comida ofrece diversos beneficios, por ejemplo, es ideal para el control del peso, especialmente para los peluditos con obesidad. Además, gracias a la humedad que aporta la dieta natural cruda, los más chineados mantienen sus niveles de hidratación óptimos, lo cual quiere decir que no necesitan estar tomando agua continuamente del recipiente.\nAlgo muy positivo es que al nivel de absorción de la dieta o al aprovechamiento digestivo, las heces se reducen hasta un 80%. Y por último, una de las grandes ventajas es que al ser una dieta orgánica y natural, no contiene químicos, preservantes, colorantes ni saborizantes artificiales.\nLEA MÁS: Jalé Berahimi encendió las redes con unas fotos en las que demostró que belleza le sobra\nEsto favorece que los órganos del canino funcionen correctamente, sin tener que procesar sustancias químicas innecesarias.\nLos caninos disfrutan mucho los sabores de Barf Natural. (Luis Vargas/Cortesía) “Actualmente, tenemos más de diez opciones de proteínas diferentes, trabajamos pollo, ternera, cerdo, cordero, caballo, salmón y pavo”, explicó el especialista.\nVargas ofrece asesoría nutricional personalizada a sus clientes, la cual toma en cuenta desde los requerimientos específicos de cada mascota hasta las mejores prácticas de la comida en cuanto a la manipulación, el proceso adecuado de descongelado, los tiempos de comida y mucho más.\n“Hemos tenido un resultado tremendo gracias a los beneficios que se ven desde la primera semana que la mascota empieza a consumir la dieta y eso nos ha abierto la puerta”, indicó Luis.\nLEA MÁS: Pitín, el payaso que tiene la dura, pero importante misión de hacernos reír en San José\nEsta es la segunda vez que Barf Natural Pets estará en Viva Feria de Mascotas, la cual tendrá lugar los días 22 y 23 de marzo, en un horario de 10 a.m., a 7 p.m., en Parque Viva y la entrada es gratuita.\nLa feria contará con la presencia de varios especialistas, quienes compartirán consejos sobre el cuidado y salud de sus mascotitas.
