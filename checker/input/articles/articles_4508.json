    "text": "Gaston Glock, Handgun Designer Who Changed the World, Dead at 94\nAWR HAWKINS 28 Dec 2023\nGaston Glock, the handgun designer who changed the world, died on Wednesday at 94 years of age.\nThe New York Times noted that Glock, born in 1929, managed a car-radiator factory near Vienna when he answered the call for a new handgun in the 1980s.\nHe heard the Austrian Army was seeking a handgun and he designed a 9mm semiautomatic that changed the course of the firearm world. It all started with the Glock Model 17, and the Austrian Army ordering 20,000 units. It was eventually adopted by two-thirds of Americas police forces.\nThe Glock also became a staple among federal agencies.\nThe Glock handgun relied on polymer in areas which bore no stress, allowing large portions of the gun to appear plastic to the naked eye.\nGlock went to public school as a child and was trained in engineering. The Daily Mail reported that he got a divorce from his first wife, Hilga, in 2011, and in the same year married Katherine Tschikof.\nKatherine was 51 years younger than Glock.\nThe Glock company website says, Make it Simple, Make it Perfect, in addressing Mr. Glocks contribution to the handgun world: Gaston Glock not only revolutionized the world of small arms in the 1980s, but also succeeded in establishing the GLOCK brand as the global leader in the handgun industry.\nIt continues, His internationally renowned GLOCK Perfection stands for uncompromising quality and maximum customer satisfaction.\nSite Information\nAbout Us\n- RonPaulForums.com is an independent grassroots outfit not officially connected to Ron Paul but dedicated to his mission.

    "text": "Recent updates\nThis article was updated in April 2024.\nFormative assessments are crucial for educators to understand their students’ grasp of concepts and skills as they work their way through lessons.

    "text": "“Il paziente della Lousiana che ha contratto l’infezione da volatili selvatici il 18 dicembre, quello di oggi del Winsconsin che ha contratto l’infezione dal suo allevamento domestico di polli, e quelli delle settimane scorse di infezioni trasmesse dalle mucche all’uomo sono tutti eventi che se considerati singolarmente rappresentano un rischio basso di focolai epidemici, ma che se presi nel loro insieme rappresentano la prova evidente che il virus sta entrando nell’uomo. A supporto di questa evidenza, vi sono analisi genetiche nei ceppi H5N1 riscontrati nell’uomo che presentano mutazioni rispetto ai ceppi nella controparte animale che lo renderebbero più adatto a replicare nell’uomo e, in un futuro prossimo, a trasmettersi da uomo a uomo”. Così all’Adnkronos Salute il virologo Mauro Pistello , direttore dell’Unità di virologia dell’Azienda ospedaliera universitaria di Pisa, interviene su quanto confermato dai Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Cdc): il primo caso di malattia grave collegata al virus dell’influenza aviaria A/H5N1 in Usa. Secondo i Cdc il bilancio generale, da aprile 2024, è di 61 casi umani di influenza aviaria H5 negli Stati Uniti.\n“Per ridurre il rischio di trasmissione serve una azione concertata, mondiale, dei sistemi sanitari e veterinari – sottolinea Pistello – che monitorino strettamente l’uomo, oltre che animali selvatici e di interesse zootecnico, al fine di una pronta identificazione e isolamento dei soggetti infetti e di una concomitante analisi dei soggetti, uomini e animali, nell’area geografica circostante al caso identificato. Penso che l’adattamento all’uomo sia inevitabile, ma con una strategia integrata e One Health si possano ridurre i danni e contenere l’impatto sanitario ed economico”, conclude il virologo.",

    "text": "Thousands of homes remain without power as the post-storm cleanup begins in the wake of Storm Gerrit. Around 1,500 homes in Scotland experienced their second night without power in Scotland while a lightning strike hit supplies in Wales on Thursday. Power company Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks said it had restored supply to more than 46,000 properties that lost power due to the storm, with people in the north east and Shetland worst affected. They said the remaining homes should be reconnected on Friday with welfare vans serving hot food and drink to affected customers from 9am. Operations director Andy Smith said: “This has been a difficult couple of days for the communities affected and I’m grateful to them for their patience and support as our teams work extremely hard to restore power.” National Grid UK said 36,000 properties were without power in Ceredigion on Thursday after lightning struck. Three men died after their 4×4 vehicle was submerged in the River Esk, near Glaisdale, on Thursday, North Yorkshire Police said. A supercell thunderstorm moved across the northwest of England on Thursday after a similar storm is thought to have resulted in a tornado that damaged homes in Greater Manchester on Wednesday. Around 100 properties were damaged by what police called a “localised tornado” in Stalybridge, Tameside and in the badly-hit village of Carrbrook. Hayley McCaffer, 40, who lives in Carrbrook, told the PA news agency that some of her neighbours’ houses “are an absolute disaster” with missing roofs and “squished” cars. Damage will be covered by standard property insurance policies, the Association of British Insurers has said. ScotRail said many lines have been reopened but urged passengers to check for the latest information before travelling, a message echoed by LNER, Avanti West Coast and London Northwestern Railway who suspensed or cancelled services due to damage or system faults. Friday will see significant disruption for travellers wishing to travel on the London Euston and Watford Junction lines with services expected to be up and running by the end of the day. In Wales, the aftermath of the recent severe weather will see rail services hampered until Monday. Ferry services also experienced cancellations and delays due to storm activity with operator DFDS confirming sailings between Dover and France were delayed due to strong winds in the English Channel. Air travel in and out of the UK saw cancellations but most services have returned to normal. The Met Office reported the worst of Storm Gerrit had passed with the last few days of 2023 forecast to be unsettled with strong winds, rain and even snow on higher ground. Met Office chief forecaster Steven Ramsdale said: “Heavy rain will spread across all but the far north on Saturday, affecting similar areas previously affected by Storm Gerrit. However, this rainfall will be a step down from that seen during Storm Gerrit.”",

    "title": "DOJ investigation details 6 ways Phoenix Police violated civil rights",
    "text": "Here’s what DOJ found during civil rights investigation into Phoenix Police Department Jun 13, 2024, 2:00 PM (DOJ Photo) PHOENIX – The U.S. Department of Justice on Thursday released the findings of a yearslong investigation into civil rights violations by the Phoenix Police Department. [The DOJ announced](https://ktar.com/story/4610838/department-of-justice-opens-civil-rights-investigation-of-phoenix-police/) back in August 2021 it would launch the investigation. The [126-page report](https://www.justice.gov/crt/media/1355866/dl?inline) list the following six areas where the department’s conduct has been unacceptable: - Excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment. - Violation of the rights of people experiencing homelessness. - Discrimination against Black, Hispanic and Native American people. - Unlawful restriction of protected speech and expression. - Discrimination against people with behavioral health disabilities. - Failing to modify practices during encounters with children. Here’s a look at what the report says about each area: Excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment After studying police shootings from January 2019 to December 2022, investigators identified several patterns indicating unreasonable use of force. They found problems with how officers used deadly force and less-lethal force. Phoenix officers too often fired weapons when there was no immediate threat, magnified the risk by their own actions and delayed providing aid for people they shot, according to the report. “Officers use unreasonable force to rapidly dominate encounters, often within the first few moments of an encounter. Officers fail to employ basic strategies to avoid force, like verbal de-escalation or using time or distance to slow things down,” the report says. Violating rights of people experiencing homelessness The DOJ said this is the first time an investigation found the rights of unhoused people being violated. The report notes that it happened in two ways. “First, PhxPD stops, detains, and arrests people who are homeless without reasonable suspicion that they are engaged in criminal activity. Second, the City and PhxPD seize and destroy property belonging to people who are homeless without providing adequate notice or opportunity to collect their belongings,” the report says. Police funneled unhoused people into the Zone homeless encampment near downtown Phoenix, helping create unsafe conditions that led to lawsuits, according to the DOJ. “But the Zone was not a safe place to live. Paramedics would not respond to emergencies in the Zone without a police escort. People in the Zone reported thirty rapes during 2021-2022. A dead fetus, estimated to be between 20 and 24 weeks old, was found in the street in 2022. In March 2023, a man was beaten, thrown into a dumpster, and set on fire,” the report says. The report does credit the city for its efforts to clear out the Zone and take other measures to address its homelessness problem. Discriminating against Black, Hispanic and Native American people Records show that officers disproportionately targeted people of color for enforcement of traffic violations, alcohol and low-level drug offenses, and quality-of-life violations such as loitering and trespassing, according to investigators. “PhxPD’s enforcement strategy has focused on policing low-level violations, including quality-of-life offenses that often involve people who are homeless. This enforcement strategy also results in stark disparities in how officers treat Black, Hispanic, and Native American people,” the report says. The DOJ said the department should have been aware of the problem. “The police department claims, it was unaware of these significant racial disparities, but longstanding and frequently voiced community concerns about discriminatory policing, as well as overt displays of bias within the police force, should have spurred the department to analyze its own data,” Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Kristen Clarke said during a press conference about the findings. “Instead, the police department turned a blind eye to the data, ignored these unmistakable warnings, and failed to uncover its own discriminatory policing patterns.” Unlawful restriction of protected speech and expression The DOJ found that Phoenix officers violated the First Amendment by retaliating against protesters who were engaged in protected speech. The report recounts multiple incidents where police fired pepper balls and other less-lethal munitions at protesters during anti-police demonstrations in 2020. “First, PhxPD retaliates against people engaged in core political speech by using unjustified punitive tactics against peaceful protestors and by targeting lawful protestors for arrest. Second, PhxPD retaliates against people in everyday encounters, reacting with unjustified force or arrest when people talk back or attempt to record officers’ activities,” the report says. Discrimination against people with behavioral health disabilities Investigators found two problems with Phoenix police policy regarding situations involving people with behavioral health disabilities. “First, the PhxPD 911 call center routinely fails to identify when callers need help with behavioral health issues. As a consequence, call-takers default to sending regular patrol officers, even though they have options to transfer the caller to clinical specialists or to send a specially trained team. Second, when PhxPD officers respond to behavioral health calls, they seldom make reasonable modifications to their approach when appropriate,” the report says. The upshot is that the police department violated the Americans with Disabilities Act during the emergency response process, according to the DOJ. Failing to modify practices during encounters with children The DOJ determined that Phoenix officers at times treat children the same as adults when the situation calls for a different approach. “During encounters with children over minor issues — sometimes where no crime has been committed — PhxPD officers escalate situations with combative language and needless force. In one such incident, two officers threw a 15-year-old Latino boy against a bus stop pole, held the back of his neck, and handcuffed him after he asked to call his mother,” the report says. Such experiences can leave children feeling traumatized and degraded, according to investigators. “Disparaging and disrespectful language from adults in positions of power can have a lasting effect on kids. It can also contribute to fear and distrust of law enforcement from the next generation of Phoenix residents,” the report says. We want to hear from you. Have a story idea or tip?

    "text": "Cerrar ventana emergente Los trabajos previstos de sustitución de las luminarias y sus soportes \"para lograr un ahorro energético y económico y adaptarse a la normativa\" en Santa Coloma de Gramenet ya se han iniciado y se alargarán hasta diciembre, ha anunciado el consistorio en un comunicado. En concreto, se ha estrenado un nuevo alumbrado en la rambla del Fondo y los trabajos continúan en diferentes lugares de la ciudad como por ejemplo en las plazas del Mediterráneo y del Rellotge , o las calles de Irlanda y de la C ircumval · lació .\nAdemás del ahorro y la eficiencia energética y de la reducción de emisiones de dióxido de carbono, se lograrán otras mejoras como por ejemplo el encendido inmediato y un funcionamiento más versátil con dispositivos de telegestión y regulación . El Gobierno municipal señala que habrá también una mejora en la uniformidad de la iluminación, sin generar contaminación lumínica al entorno y para proteger, así, la biodiversidad.\nInstalan un nuevo alumbrado en el parque del Molinet de Santa Coloma que “favorece a la biodiversidad”\nEl Ayuntamiento recibió una subvención de la Diputación de Barcelona para mejorar la eficiencia energética del alumbrado público en el marco del Programa Sectorial Renovables 2030, que impulsa actuaciones para la reducción de los costes energéticos locales. Con esta aportación económica, la Junta de Gobierno colomense adjudicó un nuevo contrato de suministro e instalación de luminarias de tecnología LED, por 412.592 euros , que permite renovar ahora unos 500 puntos de luz en toda la ciudad.\nEl objetivo es \"mejorar su eficiencia y sostenibilidad, y adecuar los niveles lumínicos del alumbrado a la normativa\", asegura el Ayuntamiento.",

    "text": "Las autoridades turcas anunciaron este viernes la detención de 32 sospechosos, presuntos miembros del grupo yihadista Estado Islámico (EI), que se cree que estaban preparando atentados contra sinagogas e iglesias del país. Según una fuente de la seguridad turca consultada por medios locales, estas personas fueron detenidas durante redadas de las fuerzas de seguridad y de los servicios de inteligencia en nueve ciudades, entre ellas Estambul y Ankara, la capital. “Dos de los sospechosos (...) fueron a explorar a sinagogas e iglesias”, afirmó la fuente. Mencionó también a un tercer hombre que planeaba un ataque contra la embajada de Irak. Según esta fuente, los tres sospechosos son importantes miembros del grupo yihadista. La policía turca anunció la semana pasada una gran redada en 32 ciudades del país y la detención de más de 300 personas por presuntos vínculos con el EI. Los ataques a las comunidades judías y cristianas en el país árabe continúan en ascenso y han tenido un incremento notable desde los ataques de Hamás a Israel el pasado 7 de octubre. A propósito de ello, el presidente de Turquía, Recep Erdogan, declaró que no considera que Hamás sea un grupo terrorista y lo tildó de “grupo de liberación”, a la vez que acusó a Israel de atacar Gaza.",
