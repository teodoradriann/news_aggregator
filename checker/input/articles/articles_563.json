    "text": "Running and gardening clubs will be recommended to those on long-term sickness leave in a bid to get people back to work. Doctors, employers, job centres, social workers and charities will be encouraged to suggest therapy and life coaching under new Government plans to create a national occupational health service and reduce the number of people whom GPs sign off from work. Community activities such as singing, cooking or gardening clubs will also be offered through NHS “social prescribing” initiatives. Work and Pensions Secretary Mel Stride and Health Secretary Victoria Atkins said the scheme is not a “one size fits all” but they hope it will work with other services to help people stay in employment. They told The Times: “We know the longer someone spends out of work, the harder it becomes for them to find a job. They added: “We also know that one in five of those claiming the highest level of health benefits want to work and feel they could do so with the right support.” Currently, there are 2.2 million people claiming Universal Credit with no work requirements. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has previously committed to tackling the growing numbers of those too ill to work. The pilots will see 15 areas test a service known as WorkWell which involves work coaches, physiotherapy and mental health treatment. Following the trials, the Governments hopes to expand the scheme nationally but key elements of it will not take effect until 2025. Ms Atkins and Mr Stride said: “Where someone could fall out of work and on to long-term sickness benefits, WorkWell is designed to swoop in and provide the support that people need to stay in work, or return as soon as possible.” Labour’s shadow employment minister Alison McGovern told The Times the scheme is “all too little and it’s far too late”.

    "text": "OPINION Comedians have had their fun with the downright disturbing confession from Robert F. Kennedy Jr. about his dumping of a dead bear cub nearly a decade ago. It is impossible to grasp the rationale of his thought process, which would have difficulty attracting viewers if billed as a dark comedy on Netflix. It has grabbed people’s attention because it is outlandish to imagine someone deciding to do this or even consider doing this vile act. We have often heard that there are no bad ideas, but this was a bad idea. The entire story is reprehensible and disgusting. As a state legislator once nicknamed “The Bear” for my local advocacy, I have embraced that name to the core. It has allowed me to learn much about the bear population in our country and find a kinship with these majestic mammals, which compelled me to share my thoughts as someone who will always fight for the humane treatment of animals. To some, this story is a tremendous comedy material and will score plenty of laughs. Still, the thought process behind this incident has a variety of consequences that are far from funny, and Mr. Kennedy should be ashamed. Carol Murphy is the majority whip of the New Jersey State Assembly.",

    "text": "New Year’s Eve is already a perilous night for motorists, and winter weather could make the next few days even more difficult for travelers in some parts of the U.S.\nCar crash fatalities jump on New Year’s Eve, largely attributed to drunk driving accidents, and although the forecast is mostly clear, poor weather conditions this year could contribute to hazardous road conditions for holiday travelers in some areas.\nMultiple states faced hazardous holiday travel over Christmas when a blustery winter storm brought blizzard conditions to Nebraska and South Dakota. The storm has moved eastward, with 12 states expecting snow over the weekend , including multiple states in the Midwest, northern Alabama and Georgia, and New York and Maine, as well as Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia.\nHowever, much of the snow was expected to fall on Friday and Saturday, leaving Sunday through Tuesday mostly clear for travelers, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n“The outlook is rosy for most travelers at the start of 2024. A sprawling area of high pressure will keep most of the country dry,” an NOAA report said Tuesday. “High temperatures are expected to be near or above average for much of the country through the first half of next week as Arctic air stays bottled up to the north.”\nHowever, the snow in northern Maine from Saturday may have “lingering effects” that “could impact travel into the New Year,” NOAA public affairs specialist and meteorologist Erica Grow Cei told Newsweek , although major interstates in the region are unlikely to have any weather-related issues. She added that snow showers enhanced by the lake effect are likely for the Midwest on Sunday, with an inch of snow forecast in the Great Lakes region and 2 to 4 inches predicted in upstate New York and northern Wisconsin.\nThe NOAA report added that precipitation will be scarce, although showers are possible on Monday from the lower Mississippi Valley to the southern and central Appalachian mountains.\n“Some snow is possible in higher mountain elevations, but since there’s not much cold air in place, the majority of precipitation is likely to fall as rain. Looking ahead to Tuesday, the outlook is dry for most folks traveling east of the Rockies,” the report said.\nRain showers are expected along the West Coast on Monday, with a threat of snow in the Cascades and the northern Sierras.\n“However, the impact on travel should be low, as the snow is likely confined to elevations above the mountain passes and major interstates,” NOAA reported.\nMeanwhile, air travel could be interrupted by a low ceiling on Monday and Tuesday in and out of Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego.\n“January 2nd could also be gusty at airport hubs along the East Coast, including Atlanta, Washington DC, and New York City,” the report said.\nMore motorists are impacted by winter weather in the days leading up to the new year, with the National Weather Service issuing weather advisories for five states on Friday. Parts of Alaska, California, Maine, Nevada and Tennessee will be impacted by high wind, as well as snow and freezing rain that could reduce visibility in the early part of the weekend.\nUncommon Knowledge\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\nThe post How Winter Weather Could Impede New Year’s Travel appeared first on Newsweek .",

He left emptyhanded, though, and was nabbed by cops a short time later at West Broadway and Franklin St.\nThe money from the successful robbery was recovered, police said.\nNo one was injured in either incident. However, the suspect’s note did vow to hurt anyone who tipped off the police, according to cops.\nRoger, who lives in the Bronx, was charged with robbery. Police said he has 11 prior arrests, most recently for drug possession last May.",

    "text": "Dentro del mundo de la astrología, una de las disciplinas más populares es el [horóscopo chino](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrolog%C3%ADa_china), y es que los antiguos astrónomos le asignaron los cinco elementos de la naturaleza china que son Tierra, Madera, Fuego, Metal, Agua y Aire a los cinco planetas del Sistema Solar. Y teniendo en cuenta la posición de los planetas, del sol, la tierra, la luna y el sol, se podrá conocer el destino de las personas. En cuanto a los signos, son en total doce y se representan por animales. Una de las diferencias que podemos establecer entre la astrología oriental y la astrología occidental es que los [signos ](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signo_zodiacal)se asignan de acuerdo al año de nacimiento y no por el día y mes de nacimiento de cada uno. A su vez, no hay que olvidarse de que entran en vigencia cada doce años, por lo que el 2024 será el año del Dragón. En esta ocasión, vamos a hacer mención de los tres signos que recibirán una ola de abundancia y prosperdidad durante los próximos días. 3 signos que tendrán abundancia y prosperidad El primer signo del horóscopo chino que tendrá una ola de abundancia y prosperidad durante los próximos días es Serpiente (1929, 1941, 1953, 1965, 1977, 1989, 2001, 2013, 2025) debido a que lo más importante pasará porque gracias a los astros, lograrán encontrar el mejor camino para poder cumplir sus objetivos y de esta manera, tener la estabilidad que buscaban. El segundo signo perteneciente a la astrología oriental que tendrá fortuna, abundancia y prosperidad durante la próxima semana es Cabra (1931, 1943, 1955, 1967, 1979, 1991, 2003, 2015, 2027) y es que lo más relevante será por lo económico, y es que ggracias a los astros, podrán acumular una enorme cantidad de dinero que les permitirá invertir. El tercer signo del horóscopo chino que tendrá abundancia y prosperidad durante los próximos días es Gallo (1933, 1945, 1957, 1969, 1981, 1993, 2005, 2017, 2029) teniendo en cuenta que lo más importante será por la positividad de algunas noticias que estarán relacionadas a lo personal conociendo nuevas personas, lo económico, acumulando mucha fortuna y en lo espiritual.
