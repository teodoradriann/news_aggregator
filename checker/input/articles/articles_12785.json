WHIO Staff December 29, 2023 at 12:25 AM · 2 min read Link Copied Read full article Sheriff’s office stretching resources to take over patrol of local village suspending police dept.\nIn just days, a small Clark County community will lose its police force.\nAs News Center 7 reported earlier this week, South Vienna is suspending its police department. The village said it couldn’t hire or keep the police officers necessary to keep the department running.\n>> PREVIOUS COVERAGE: Local community suspends police department, turns to Sheriff’s Office starting Jan. 1\nIn its replacement, the Clark County Sheriff’s Office will be stretching its resources to help patrol the community, a process they began back in April but will completely take over in January. A deputy will be assigned to the village for 40 hours a week.\n“Just because it says 40 hours a week doesn’t mean they’re not going to be patrolling if there (are) issues,” Chuck Comp, of South Vienna, said.\nSome people, like Theo High, have some concerns.\n“They might not be able to be as effective as they need to be so I mean, I’m just not sure how effective that’ll be,” High said.\nAs seen on News Center 7 at 5:00 , Malik Patterson spoke to Clark County Sheriff’s Office Major Michael Young about the change and the staffing issues the sheriff’s office has also seen.\n“We have been at a struggle point multiple times over the last few years,” Young said.\n>> RELATED: Just never know;’ Local community resident voices concerns about police department suspension\nHe told News Center 7 that the office had issues with pay, as well as recruiting and retention of deputies. Still, he’s confident in the other deputies and the work they’ll put in with this extended role.\n“We’re going to be that bridge for the residents of South Vienna and for the mayor out there,” Young explained.\nComp said he thinks being close to major cities like Columbus and Dayton impacts the village’s ability to retain officers.\n“South Vienna’s competing with Dayton, Columbus, you know larger cities for police officers and you know they’re short too,” Comp said.\nDespite the upcoming change, the door is still open to bring police back to South Vienna. Talks about bringing the police department back to the village will happen next year. There is no timeframe yet, but the village mayor speaks to the sheriff’s office frequently.\nView comments",

    "text": "Factory workers at Boeing will walk off the job Friday after members voted late Thursday evening in favor of a strike, according to a report. \"This is about respect, this is about addressing the past, and this is about fighting for our future,\" said Jon Holden, who headed the negotiations for International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), Boeing&apos;s largest union, Reuters reported. He then announced roughly 30,000 workers who produce Boeing&apos;s 737 MAX and other jets on the U.S.&apos; West Coast voted 96% in favor of striking and subsequently halting production of the planemaker&apos;s strongest-selling jet. The strike will be workers&apos; first since 2008. It will formally start at midnight Pacific time as Friday begins. BOEING FACES STRIKE OF ABOUT 32,000 WORKERS In a statement, Boeing said it was committed to continuing negotiations. \"The message was clear that the tentative agreement we reached with IAM leadership was not acceptable to the members. We remain committed to resetting our relationship with our employees and the union and we are ready to get back to the table to reach a new agreement,\" the company said. The strike comes amid numerous other delays over production and as the company faces heat after a door panel blew off a near-new 737 MAX jet in midair in January. It also comes just weeks after new CEO Kelly Ortberg was brought on in August to restore faith in the company. The strike comes as a jarring conclusion to negotiations over a deal that would see an increase in workers’ wages. NEW BOEING CEO FOCUSED ON RESTORING TRUST: &apos;WE CLEARLY HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO&apos; The deal included a general wage increase of 25%, a $3,000 signing bonus and a pledge to build Boeing&apos;s next commercial jet in the Seattle area. Initially, IAM leadership recommended that its members accept the contract, but many workers responded angrily. Many of the dissenters argued for the originally demanded 40% pay rise and lamented the loss of an annual bonus. According to Reuters, IAM members ultimately voted 94.6% to reject the agreement, which was their first full contract in 16 years. \"We&apos;re going to get back to the table as quickly as we can,\" Holden told a group of reporters on Thursday. He would not say how long he thought the strike would last or when talks would resume, adding: \"This is something that we take one day at a time, one week at a time.\" Workers have been protesting all week in Boeing factories in Seattle.

The Boeing workers&apos; last strike in 2008 continued for 52 days and cost Boeing an estimated $100 million per day. Reuters contributed to this report.",

    "text": "Voir mon actu Suivre La Gazette du Val d'Oise Il lui avait assuré qu’il ne « se séparerait jamais d’elle facilement ou en bons termes ». Malgré ces menaces, malgré le chantage de son compagnon de se suicider si elle venait à le quitter, Sandrine avait fait son choix. Le choix de vivre sa vie. Un choix que Keenan n’a jamais accepté. C’est parce qu’il ne voulait pas la savoir avec un autre homme qu’ il s’est acharné sur sa compagne de 23 ans , et mère de leur petit garçon alors âgé de 7 mois, le 12 mars 2021 à leur domicile de Champagne-sur-Oise (Val-d’Oise).\nDu canapé du salon jusqu’à l’entrée de leur immeuble jusqu’où il l’avait poursuivie, il l’a poignardé à 118 reprises dans un « état de fureur », a analysé l’expert psychiatrique. Une exécution qui en 2021 avait fait de Sandrine la 19 e victime d’un féminicide au cours d’une année où 121 femmes avaient succombé aux coups de leur compagnon . « Elle a été tuée parce qu’elle était en train de le quitter. Elle est morte parce qu’elle voulait être libre », a condamné l’avocate de la partie civile lors de sa plaidoirie.\nUn crime que l’accusé a toujours reconnu, sans toutefois jamais réussir l’expliquer, évoquant un trou noir après les premiers coups portés. Les photos de la scène de crime publiées sur les écrans de la salle d’audience n’auront rien changé, pas plus que les demandes des frères et sœurs de la victime qui a défaut de réponse auront obtenu de la cour une peine à la hauteur de leur espérances : Keenan ayant été condamné à 25 ans de réclusion criminelle jeudi 13 juin 2024. Les jurés ont ainsi suivi les réquisitions de l’avocat général qui avait présenté l’accusé comme « une bombe à retardement. Rien n’aurait pu l’arrêter ce soir-là. Sandrine n’avait aucune chance. »\n« Je suis désespéré et prêt à tout » Dans la matinée, le jeune homme de 27 ans était revenu sur sa relation avec la victime qui s’était dégradée depuis la naissance de leur fils. La jeune femme lui reprochait de ne pas l’aider dans les tâches quotidiennes. Au fil des mois, Sandrine s’était détachée de Keenan. Elle estimait lui avoir laissé suffisamment de chances de prouver qu’il pouvait changer et désirait ainsi poursuivre sa vie sans lui. « Je suis désespéré et prêt à tout pour que la relation reprenne, je ne me voyais à aucun moment entretenir une relation amicale », a confié l’accusé face à la cour d’assises. Ce dernier confie sa crainte de l’abandon . Un sentiment qu’il a nourri depuis le suicide de sa mère alors qu’il était âgé de 7 ans . Dans une note rédigée sur son téléphone quelques instants avant les faits, il évoque « un ensemble d’anxiété », « une jalousie grandissante » et « la peur de finir seul ».\n« Sandrine a subi toutes les peines que j’avais en moi » Ce soir là, il avait surpris Sandrine au téléphone avec son nouveau compagnon. L’élément déclencheur. « C’est toute la rage que j’avais en moi qui est sortie tout d’un coup. Sandrine a subi toutes les peines que j’avais en moi », indique l’accusé qui se souvient des coups de couteaux portés sur le canapé , se voyant dans « des flashs » au dessus d’elle alors qu’elle gît dans son sang en bas de l’escalier. Une absence de souvenirs qui interpelle le président de la cour d’assises. » Est-ce vraiment une amnésie ?, a-t-il interrogé. Ce ne serait pas une façon d’échapper à devoir raconter comment vous avez donné une centaine de coups de couteau, c’est plus dur. » « J’essaie encore de me souvenir », assure l’accusé, soulignant avoir été « bourré de médicaments » après avoir été admis en hôpital psychiatrique. Le président de la cour reprend : « C’est un acharnement terrible . Quarante plaies rien qu’au thorax dont 33 profondes. Vous aviez l’absolue volonté de la détruire totalement. Cela manifeste une haine manifeste une haine totale! » D’une voix monocorde, sans montrer aucune réaction, Keenan témoigne : « C’est toute la rage que j’avais en moi qui est sortie tout d’un coup. Sandrine a subi toutes les peines que j’avais en moi. » Alors que l’hypothèse de la prise de produit, un temps évoquée, a été écartée par l’expert toxicologique, les expertises psychiatriques et psychologiques ont également conclu que son discernement n’était pas aboli ni même altéré lors de son passage à l’acte.\n« J’ai énormément de remords », a tenu à assurer l’accusé alors que son avocate, Me Marion Ménage, a relevé que « chaque jour que Dieu fait, a plaidé l’avocate, Keenan se lève le matin pour trouver la force de comprendre pourquoi il a fait ça. Il ne le fait pas pour lui. Il le fait pour son fils, parce qu’il y aura des questions un jour ». « Un fils qu’il a privé de sa mère, comme lui même avait été privé de la sienne », a relevé l’avocate de la partie civile.\nVidéos : en ce moment sur Actu « C’était interdit d’enlever la vie à sa maman » Un petit garçon aujourd’hui élevé par Martina, la grande soeur de Sandrine, avec les parents de Keenan. « Ce que vous faites est admirable. Continuez. Une seule chose doit vous guider, c’est l’intérêt de l’enfant », a souligné Me Christian Gallon qui représentait les intérêts de celui-ci. Un petit-garçon « qui va grandir avec une histoire absolument épouvantable » . Se tournant vers l’accusé, le conseil lui lance alors : « C’est le procès d’un homme qui a tué une femme, le procès d’un homme qui a tué une soeur, une fille, une amie, mais également le procès d’un père qui a tué une mère. Vous êtes ces trois hommes là. » Et Me Christian Gallon de conclure : « L’histoire de votre enfant est écrite avec le sang de sa mère. C’était interdit d’enlever la vie à sa maman. »\nSuivez toute l’actualité de vos villes et médias favoris en vous inscrivant à Mon Actu .\n#Féminicide",

    "text": "Sign up for the Morning Brief email newsletter to get weekday updates from The Weather Channel and our meteorologists.\nWinter weather has been rather minimal over much of the country so far, to the point of setting records for the mildest start to the season, according to one metric.\nT​he record setters and the rest of the mild cities: According to the Accumulated Winter Season Severity Index (AWSSI) from the Midwest Regional Climate Center (MRCC), more than 20 cities have had a record gentle start to the winter through late December.\nA​mong those cities are some of America’s typically snowy or cold places, including Fargo, North Dakota; Marquette, Michigan; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and Minneapolis-St. Paul.\nM​uch of the rest of the country has had a mild or moderate start to the season, at least somewhat less snowy and/or warmer than usual.\n(Further beef up your forecast with our detailed, hour-by-hour breakdown for the next 8 days – only available on our Premium Pro experience.)\nWhat this index means: Also known as the “winter misery index”, the AWSSI takes takes into account three factors: the intensity and persistence of cold weather, the frequency and amount of snowfall and the amount and persistence of snow on the ground. Wind and mixed precipitation, such as freezing rain, are not a part of the index.\nThe index uses five categories – mild, moderate, average, severe and extreme – to rate the severity of winter weather in cities across the U.S. over an entire cold season.\nThe higher the index, the more and persistent snow and/or cold you’ve experienced. As the map above shows, much of the nation has had relatively low AWSSI indices, so far.\nShown below is the time series of the index for Lead, South Dakota, in the state’s western Black Hills. The black line corresponds to this season’s index. Only a Christmas blizzard – Winter Storm Donovan – bumped the town’s index up a bit in recent days, though it was still in record territory through late December.\nL​ack of snow: Outside the Mountain West, High Plains and northern New England, there hasn’t been much snowfall this season, so far. According to an analysis by New Zealand-based meteorologist Ben Noll, the Lower 48 has seen its least snowfall this season-to-date since at least 2008.\nT​he snow that has fallen hasn’t stuck around long. Snow cover extent has been the least expansive for late December across the Lower 48 in at least 20 years, according to NOAA.\n(For even more granular weather data tracking in your area, view your 15-minute details forecast in our Premium Pro experience.)\nW​idespread warmth: Then there’s the fact it hasn’t been very cold in December.\nA​s of the time this article was published before New Year’s Eve, several cities in the northern tier from Washington state to the Great Lakes were flirting with or solidly ahead of pace for their warmest Decembers on record.\nT​hat included some of the same places with record-low winter misery indices, as well as Portland, Oregon; Toledo, Ohio; and even the nation’s icebox, International Falls, Minnesota.\nD​ozens of other cities from the Northeast to California were on pace for one of their top five warmest Decembers.\nD​ifferent kind of “misery”: Despite all this, there’s been a different kind of weather frustration, namely, the liquid variety.\nV​irtually the entire Eastern Seaboard from Florida to Maine has been soaked repeatedly in December.\nA​ pair of wet storms pushed Allentown, Pennsylvania, to its wettest single winter month in data since 1912, picking up just over 8.5 inches of rain. And several Florida cities, including Punta Gorda and Tallahassee, were on pace for a top 10 wettest December, usually a dry month in the Sunshine State.\nM​ORE ON WEATHER.COM\n-​ What A Polar Vortex Weakening Could Mean For The Rest Of Winter\n-​ How A Stronger El Niño Could Impact Snowfall This Winter\n-​ 5 Weather Wishes We Hope Come True In 2024\n-​ 10 Strangest Things We Saw In 2023’s Weather\nJonathan Erdman is a senior meteorologist at weather.com and has been covering national and international weather since 1996.
