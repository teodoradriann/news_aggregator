    "title": "The United States reached the immigration crisis – PublicoGT",
    "text": "Jorge Sanchez\nUpon assuming the presidency of the\nUnited States, Joe Biden promised to improve the country’s immigration policy, which was harshly criticized during the administration of his predecessor, Donald Trump. Initially, this promise was received with joy by the Latin American immigrant community. However, the Biden administration has been forced to reverse his position due to an unchecked immigration crisis.\nThe “open door” policy resulted in a steady increase in immigrants into US territory. Although some officials recognized this problem, many feared losing political support by addressing it. The mayor of\nNew York was one of the first to warn about the lack of resources to care for a large number of immigrants.\nTo address the situation, the Biden administration took steps, such as negotiating with the Mexican government and collaborating with Spain to accept Latin American migrants from centers in the region. However, these actions generated discontent among the Spanish.\nThe\nUnited States House of Representatives, with a Republican majority, has approved a bill to reactivate the construction of a wall on the border with Mexico, an emblematic measure of the Trump era. In contrast, the Senate, with a Democratic majority, announced its intention to block this project, reflecting the division in Congress over immigration policy.\nThe governor of Texas, a state bordering Mexico, has deployed the National Guard to intercept immigrants at the border, managing to block some 30,000 Latin American migrants. However, it is recognized that the solution to the problem requires a coordinated approach at the state level.\nFurthermore, the increase in the arrival of immigrants has generated growth in anti-immigrant sentiments, reflected in crimes and violent acts. Organizations such as the League of United Latino American Citizens (LULAC) have demanded independent investigations into cases of harassment and deaths of immigrants in the country.\nRead more: The grandmother has notified the police. Follow the uncle-in-law. Mistreated her 12-year-old granddaughter until she was pregnant - gave birth to a child.\nIn short, the\nUnited States is currently fighting an immigration threat and trying to restore tranquility in the country. Although it is unclear who will emerge victorious in this fight, it is clear that immigrants’ desires are clashing with American interests. It is hoped that, once the situation normalizes, the United States can regain its reputation as a welcoming country and find sustainable solutions to manage migration flows.\nHere are some actions the US government could consider to address the migration crisis:\n- International cooperation:\n- Work closely with countries of origin and transit to address the root causes of migration, such as poverty, violence and lack of economic opportunity.\n- Reform of the immigration system:\n- Pursue comprehensive reform of the immigration system that addresses deficiencies and provides legal and efficient pathways for immigration.\n- Efficient processing of asylum applications:\n- Strengthen and accelerate asylum application procedures to ensure fair and rapid evaluation of applications.\n- Additional Resources:\n- Allocate additional resources to improve detention and processing facilities, as well as to hire more immigration judges and trained staff.\n- Economic development programs:\n- Implement economic development programs in vulnerable areas to address the economic causes of migration and improve living conditions.\n- Education and outreach:\n- Carry out education and outreach campaigns in countries of origin to inform people about the risks and consequences of irregular migration.\n- Improved border security:\n- Invest in technologies and strategies that improve border security and facilitate the detection of illegal activities.\n- Bipartisan collaboration:\n- Foster bipartisan collaboration to achieve lasting and sustainable legislative solutions.\n- Support to humanitarian organizations:\n- Collaborate with non-governmental organizations and international agencies to provide humanitarian assistance and basic services to migrants.\n- Regional policies:\n- Develop policies that comprehensively address migration across the region, rather than unilateral approaches.\nRead more: Marseille, Nice, Monaco, Cannes, Le Cannet ... This is what awaits them for the 32nd finals of the Coupe de France\nIt is important to note that addressing the migration crisis requires a comprehensive and long-term strategy, in addition to collaboration between various sectors and levels of government, both nationally and internationally. Solutions must balance border security with respect for human rights and address the underlying causes of migration.\nJorge Carlos Sánchez Pérez. Born in Argentina in 1995, I loved this wonderful country. Lover of journalism, culture and communication. I really like writing about\npolitics and international relations. He studied at the Faculty of Psychology and Social Sciences (Sociology) at the University of Flores in Argentina. Out of pity he was expelled. After losing the chance to graduate, he was looking for different types of work in Buenos Aires. My career in journalism began on Telegram channel La Jirafa, as a general information editor. Today I am the main journalist of Telegram channel La Jirafa. My professional experience began at Impacto España Noticias where the editorial team created my capabilities. I currently collaborate with Digital Alert, Aporrea, Rebellion, Spain News, Third Information.\nI’m ready to improve my writing skills. I approach each challenge with an analytical and comprehensive view, with energy and creativity.",

    "text": "It is a quiet start to November, but that won't last long as an active weather pattern is setting up all the way through next week, especially for the mountains. There is also the potential for the first accumulating snow of the season for parts of central Montana come Election Day.\nThe first round of mountain snow will arrive as a disturbance moves in Saturday morning. Roads over mountain passes could become slick during the day, and especially Saturday night. The mountains of western Montana and along the continental Divide will receive 1-4\" of snowfall by Saturday evening.\nWhile the lower elevations will generally remain dry over the weekend, there is a slight chance for a stray rain or snow shower. Temperatures will be seasonably mild on Saturday, with highs in the low to mid-50s, but will drop a bit on Sunday, reaching the mid to upper 40s.\nLight snow showers will persist in the mountains on Sunday and Monday, although only minor accumulations are expected.\nThe next storm drops in from the northwest Monday night. The wind is going to pick up quickly ahead of the arrival of the storm, with gusts of 50-70mph likely for the Rocky Mountain Front Monday into Tuesday.\nLight snow will overspread western Montana from northwest to southeast Monday night. There will be scattered snow showers east of the Divide but most areas will receive less than an inch of snowfall. There could be some slick spots on Election Day morning.\nThis system will likely bring the first good snowfall to the mountain ranges of central Montana. Then, a high pressure ridge looks to strengthen over the region kick-starting a warming trend and bringing more sunshine to the area for the remainder of the week.",

The small law enforcement entity of 5,000 employees is favored by Democrats as critical to combating gun violence and accused by Republicans of overregulating firearms. ATF works with local law enforcement to solve gun crimes and regulates the sales and licensing of firearms under federal law.\nSince being tapped as the interim ATF director in February, Patel has been a largely absent leader and only appeared at the agency’s headquarters once. President Trump has not nominated a permanent director and has not indicated whether he will. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche has proposed merging ATF with the Drug Enforcement Administration. Patel said last month that he would pull 150 ATF agents from their typical duties and deploy them to work on border-related duties. As Army secretary, Driscoll shapes policies for the military’s largest service, with more than 400,000 active-duty soldiers, including personnel and recruitment.\nThe Senate confirmed Driscoll in February.",

    "text": "El Papa \"sigue de cerca\" las noticias del \"terrible\" incendio que se declaró durante la tarde de este jueves en un edificio de 14 plantas en el barrio de Campanar, en la ciudad de Valencia, y ha pedido oraciones por las víctimas. \"El Santo Padre sigue de cerca las noticias que llegan sobre el terrible incendio en un edificio de apartamentos del campanar, en el que ya se cuentan pérdidas de vidas humanas, así como numerosos heridos y desaparecidos\", se lee en el telegrama, firmado como es habitual en nombre de Francisco por el Secretario de Estado del Vaticano, el cardenal Pietro Parolin. En el telegrama --remitido al arzobispo de Valencia, Enrique Benavent Vidal--, el Papa ha encomendado \"el alma de los difuntos a la misericordia divina\" y ha asegurado \"su cercanía espiritual al pueblo valenciano y a todas las familias de los afectados\". Asimismo ha pedido oraciones \"para que les otorgue fortaleza en este momento de dolor y sostenga los trabajos de extinción y búsqueda\". \"Con estos sentimientos, invocando la intercesión de nuestra señora de los desamparados y del patriarca san josé, les imparte de corazón la confortadora bendición apostólica, como prenda de esperanza en cristo resucitado\", se lee en el telegrama. Iniciado por causas todavía desconocidas, el fuego se propagó a gran velocidad por todo el complejo arrasando todo el inmueble y dejando atrapados a varios vecinos. De momento, se han confirmado cinco víctimas mortales, además de al menos 15 desaparecidos. EUROPA PRESS",

    "text": "El alcalde de Cartagena, William Dau Chamat, denunció ante la Fiscalía General de la Nación al alcalde la Localidad de la Virgen y Turística del Distrito, Andy Reales Arroyo; a Linda Ruiz Leguizamo y/o Bryan Rodríguez Luna, representante legal del Grupo Ingenious; y a funcionarios públicos que se lleguen a considerar responsables disciplinaria, fiscal y penalmente, por la celebración de un contrato que presuntamente habría violado el régimen de la contratación pública, de acuerdo a los principios de publicidad y transparencia. [ Lea: Mientras Dau y los entes lo buscan, Andy Reales apareció en Magangué](https://www.eluniversal.com.co/politica/mientras-dau-y-los-entes-lo-buscan-andy-reales-aparecio-en-magangue-BY9706883) El alcalde se refiere al contrato de suministro UM- ALVT -001-2023, que tiene como objeto “ejecutar las acciones que permitan desarrollar generación de ingresos de emprendimiento y empresarismo como asistencia social en las familias en condición de pobreza extrema de la Localidad de la Virgen y Turística”. [También le puede interesar: Atención: Procuraduría abrió investigación contra el alcalde Andy Reales](https://www.eluniversal.com.co/politica/atencion-procuraduria-abrio-investigacion-contra-el-alcalde-andy-reales-DN9681243) Dicho contrato tiene un valor de tres mil ciento ochenta y cinco millones ciento tres mil ochocientos diecisiete pesos ($3.185.103.817). De acuerdo a la información del contrato en mención, el mismo se justifica en el marco del Decreto 1441 de 2023 por el cual “se declara situación de calamidad pública en el Distrito de Cartagena por las condiciones de riesgo para la ciudadanía a causa de las fuertes lluvias por perturbación atmosférica en el oriente del Mar del Caribe”. Sin embargo, la Alcaldía de la Localidad de la Virgen y Turística no realizó ninguna articulación y/o suscribió compromiso en el plan de riesgo coordinado con el Consejo para la Gestión del Riesgo. Por lo anterior, el alcalde de la Localidad Virgen y Turística ,Andy Reales Arroyo, incurre en una presunta violación a la Ley. Por otra parte, de acuerdo con el Distrito, las actividades contratadas no guardan relación con las acciones a desplegar a fin de atender la calamidad pública. “El Certificado de Disponibilidad Presupuestal es tramitado bajo el proyecto del plan desarrollar generación de ingresos emprendimiento y empresarismo como asistencia social en las familias en condición de pobreza extrema de la Localidad de la Virgen y Turística, que no guarda relación con el propósito de la calamidad pública que propendía se asumieran acciones para mitigar, corregir, y controlar los efectos de la emergencia a causa de las lluvias”, indicó el Distrito a través de un comunicado. Denuncian que la relación tiempo y costo presupuestal del contrato no se ajusta a la realidad jurídica y fáctica de la ejecución del mismo, “esto si se observa que para este tipo de contratación regularmente se establecen períodos de ejecución entre un mes y tres meses, y normalmente los presupuestos no superan los $600 millones”. El alcalde de Cartagena, William Dau Chamat, también argumenta que, el objeto social del Grupo Ingenious es excesivamente amplio, lo que desdibuja su distintivo como ESAL, teniendo, al parecer, como única finalidad poder participar en cualquier tipo de convenio, sin importar la idoneidad. Es importante resaltar que la ESAL referenciada ya fue denunciada por el mandatario en el “Libro Blanco”, por presentar irregularidades relacionadas en otros contratos celebrados con el Distrito de Cartagena en la vigencia 2017 a 2019.",
