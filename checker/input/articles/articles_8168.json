    "title": "Hades 2's Supportive Shade May Be More Than It Seems",
    "text": "Hades 2's early access has so content on offer that it almost feels like a completed game. Like its predecessor, Hades 2 includes many small references and Easter Eggs from Greek mythology, but it also includes several references to its own canon, which diverges from commonly established Greek myths at times to avoid some awkward scenarios. This isn't a problem, as there are many differing versions of Greek myths, and Supergiant's own version doesn't directly contradict anything from the original myths. It does, however, introduce a seemingly original character in the form of the Supportive Shade.\nThe Supportive Shade is a recurring character in Hades, and appears in the arena in Elysium as the only shade that consistently supports Zagreus. In Hades 2's Warsong Update, the Supportive Shade makes a return in the Fields of Mourning, where Melinoe can speak to them and acknowledges them as the same shade. As Persephone's father was a mortal farmer, there's a popular fan theory that the Supportive Shade is Zagreus and Melinoe's maternal grandfather, an idea which may be explored in Hades 2.\nRelated\nHades 2: 5 Most Teased Events For the Full Release\nA list of events that may or may not be fated for Hades 2.\nSupergiant's Hades and Myth\nOne particular myth that has several deviations in Greek mythology is the matter of Persephone's parents. While her mother is always Demeter, the goddess of the seasons, her father changes depending on the origin of the myth, with her father usually being either Zeus or a random mortal man. Supergiant's canon for Hades has Persephone being the child of Demeter and a mortal man, making Zagreus and Melinoe a quarter mortal. Zagreus' mortality is evident in that he bleeds red blood, rather than the golden ichor more typical of the gods, and is designated as the God of Blood and Life.\nThe Supportive Shade is first encountered in Hades when Zagreus fights Theseus in Elysium's arena. The Supportive Shade is the only shade in the crowd who consistently supports Zagreus, and has a banner of Zagreus it brandishes in support of him. The Supportive Shade makes a reappearance in Hades 2 in the Fields of Mourning after Melinoe's battle with Cerberus, and appears close to the exit. Melinoe acknowledges that the shade used to dwell in Elysium, and can interact with them on subsequent runs. Eventually, Melinoe can invite the Supportive Shade to the Crossroads.\nThe Supportive Shade in Hades 2\nThe Supportive Shade made their reappearance within the Warsong Update. Alongside this update came new decorations for the Crossroads called \"Toolset, Farmer's\", with the description, \"Claimed to have once belonged to a mortal farmer who knew the goddess of the seasons\". This is very likely a reference to Zagreus and Melinoe's mortal grandfather. When selected, Melinoe doesn't show any recognition that these could have been her grandfather's, and doesn't seem to be aware that her grandfather was a mortal at all.\nTo bring back the Supportive Shade in the same update that introduced a Crossroads upgrade that references Melinoe's grandfather could be a coincidence, but it does give credibility to the popular fan theory that the Supportive Shade is Zagreus and Melinoe's mortal grandfather. As the main conflict of Hades 2 is about defeating their other grandfather, the Titan of Time, it would be wonderfully charming for Melinoe to have her other grandfather offer her unconditional love and support. Melinoe is known in the myths as a goddess of shades and, as the rest of her immediate family has been locked away, having her develop a connection with her mortal grandfather as a shade would be a great reference to her special connection with shades, while simoltaneously giving her a part of her family back.\n-\nOpenCritic Reviews - Top Critic Rating: 90/100 Critics Recommend: 100%\n- Released\n- May 6, 2024\n- ESRB\n- t\n- Developer(s)\n-\nSupergiant Games - Publisher(s)\n-\nSupergiant Games",

    "title": "The Top 9 Most Likely Places to Encounter Bobcats in the United States",
    "text": "Bobcats are one of wildlife conservation’s greatest success stories in most of the United States . Whereas population decline occurred in Midwest states, leading to local extinction in states like Iowa and Ohio, a rebound led to growing populations from the 1990s until now. Except for Delaware, all 48 contiguous United States report bobcat populations . So, with bobcats existing almost anywhere in the United States, you might wonder about the likely places to encounter bobcats. Unfortunately, these wild cats are some of the most elusive species you will find. They notoriously lead nocturnal lives, coming out rarely during the day, and like to stick around places with good cover. However, there are some areas where you might have more luck encountering a bobcat. Check out the top places you will most likely encounter a bobcat in the United States and whether they are associated with any risks. Pay attention to covered habitats in southern California, including chaparral, sagebrush, and thick brush. ©iStock.com/brentawp Estimates put California bobcat populations between 70,000 and 100,000, making it a likely state to run into one. However, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife emphasizes that bobcats dislike human contact and rarely display aggression . If you want a likely place to encounter a bobcat in California, state and national parks like Point Lobos State Natural Preserve, Toro Park, and Pinnacles National Park are great options. Scratch marks on tree trunks are one way to look out for bobcats in your area of Texas. ©Chris Desborough/Shutterstock.com All over the state of Texas , bobcats are thriving. As many as 200,000 bobcats live throughout the state. If you want one spot to pay particular attention to, consider hanging around the brush country of south Texas . One statistic estimates one bobcat per less than one square mile in the south. Bobcats often hunt at night, making it less likely for humans to encounter them during the day. Researchers find that bobcats make rock piles, brush piles, and hollow trees into their dens throughout the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. ©Jeff Westhead/Shutterstock.com Over 125,000 bobcats call North Carolina home, and the population is growing. According to the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission , the largest numbers of bobcats are in wooded areas of the Coastal Plain region and mountains. This wild cat lives all over the rest of the state but prefers the coverage of bottomland hardwoods and swamps in the east and mature mountain forests. Although these are the likely places to encounter a bobcat in North Carolina, you can easily miss them unless you are out at night. As bobcats lose traditional habitats and prey sources, more encounters are occurring in Colorado despite having fewer estimated bobcats than in other states. ©Grindstone Media Group/Shutterstock.com Due to its adaptability, the bobcat lives in a variety of habitats. In Colorado , it easily makes its home in juniper woodlands and snowy landscapes. The risk of encountering a bobcat in a more urban area depends on the level of distance from wooded or rocky spaces. Because these wild cats prefer cover, they may wander into a residential area if it abuts a patch of forest. Keeping pets inside during dark hours, especially dusk and dawn, is advised. The most likely places to encounter a bobcat in Georgia are mixed forests and agricultural areas with plenty of wooded growth on the margins. Typically, wildlife authorities in Georgia do not classify bobcats as a nuisance. They avoid places with lots of human activity and do not openly attack people. Bobcats can range from the size of a large housecat to a bit larger. They are not considered a threat to adults but could hurt a small child. ©Don Mammoser/Shutterstock.com All over Oregon , you will see little signs of the bobcat, whether you see scratch marks or paw prints. However, you likely will not encounter them in person, even if you live in the western part of Oregon, where bobcats are most common. These reclusive creatures stay where they have cover. Plus, they often come out during dusk, evening, and dawn hours. If your home sits near a forest, you might see one of the 7,000 bobcats that call Oregon home if you pay attention. Attacks on humans by bobcats typically are linked to rabies or other disease. ©Charles T. Peden/Shutterstock.com Bobcats have adapted to all types of habitats in Arizona , including all elevations. The most likely places to encounter a bobcat are the Sonoran desert, chaparral areas, and the outskirts of urban areas, where they can find plenty of food. Residents of suburban homes in Phoenix and Tucson have sighted wild cats in their backyards, rarely with any trouble. The Arizona Game and Fish Department recommends removing anything that can attract bobcats if you wish to dissuade them. Do not leave food for other animals outside. Also, pick up brush and rubbish in your yard regularly. Although Florida is the only state where bobcat populations are decreasing, an estimated 300,000 bobcats call it home. ©Laurie E Wilson/Shutterstock.com Bobcats live in all parts of Florida but are especially abundant in the south . Big Cypress National Preserve is home to many of them. They enjoy the cypress swamps and pinelands that provide plenty of food and shelter. A bobcat poses little threat to humans. You can easily deter one from coming into your yard or property with loud noises and sprinklers. The highest bobcat population in South Carolina is in the lower Coastal Plain region. © Johann Knox/Shutterstock.com Across South Carolina , around 90,000 bobcats live and breed. Kiawah Island proudly protects its population of bobcats. Once fairly abundant, between 2017 and 2020, the population declined due to rodenticide use. Residents of Kiawah appreciate the way bobcats help control rodent and deer populations.

    "text": "Actualité santé | News 24\nRéduisez votre taux de cholestérol jusqu’à 10 % en ajoutant des collations quotidiennes à votre alimentation\nNe pas lutter contre les taux de cholestérol élevés entraîne souvent des patients nécessitant des interventions médicales ultérieures.\nHeureusement, certains aliments peuvent contribuer de manière significative à la gestion du taux de cholestérol lorsqu’ils sont inclus dans l’alimentation.\nLa diététiste et nutritionniste Mei Wan a déclaré à GB News que dans certains cas, une intervention diététique peut donner des résultats en seulement quatre à six semaines.\nCe délai correspond aux effets observés lors de la prise de médicaments à base de statines traditionnels, a noté l’expert.\nLes noix sont riches en stérols végétaux\nPennsylvanie\nMei a expliqué : « Certains aliments, en particulier ceux riches en fibres solubles, en stérols végétaux et en graisses insaturées, peuvent réduire considérablement le cholestérol LDL et peuvent compléter ou, dans quelques cas, produire des effets similaires aux statines, en particulier chez les personnes présentant une légère élévation du cholestérol.\n« Les aliments riches en fibres solubles comme l’avoine, les haricots, les pommes et les agrumes aident à réduire le cholestérol en se liant à celui-ci dans le système digestif, réduisant ainsi son absorption.\n« Par exemple, seulement 1,5 tasse de flocons d’avoine cuits par jour peut réduire le cholestérol LDL jusqu’à 10 pour cent au fil du temps. »\nL’expert a poursuivi : « Les stérols et stanols végétaux présents dans les aliments enrichis comme les pâtes à tartiner et les yaourts peuvent également favoriser un taux de cholestérol sain, entraînant une réduction de six à 10 % du cholestérol LDL lorsqu’ils sont consommés en quantités quotidiennes d’environ 1,5 à trois grammes, et en parallèle. une alimentation saine et équilibrée.\n« Incorporer des graisses saines est une autre stratégie efficace », a poursuivi l’expert.\n« Les noix comme les amandes et les noix, ainsi que les poissons gras comme le saumon, fournissent des acides gras oméga-3 bénéfiques et des graisses monoinsaturées qui abaissent le cholestérol LDL et améliorent le profil lipidique global. »\nPour ajouter des fibres supplémentaires liant le cholestérol à l’alimentation, Mei recommande de manger des grains entiers comme l’orge et le riz brun.\nLes aliments d’origine végétale réduisent considérablement le mauvais cholestérol\nGETTY\n« Les grains entiers comme l’orge et le riz brun contribuent également à la réduction du cholestérol en fournissant plus de fibres, qui se lient au cholestérol dans les intestins », a expliqué Mei.\n« Il a été démontré que les produits à base de soja, tels que le tofu et le lait de soja, réduisent le cholestérol jusqu’à cinq pour cent et remplacer le beurre par des graisses saines comme l’huile d’olive peut également aider à réduire le taux de cholestérol. »\nSelon Mei, les approches naturelles fonctionnent mieux en complément d’un exercice régulier, 30 à 45 minutes d’exercice modéré étant recommandées cinq fois par semaine.\nRéduire la consommation d’alcool aidera également le foie à éliminer plus efficacement le mauvais cholestérol.",

    "text": "Medio Oriente, https://www.lahaine.org/mundo.php/medio-oriente/:: 02/02/2024\nIsrael lo tuvo que admitir: Murió otro alto comandante del ejército en Gaza\nEl ejército de Israel confirma que un comandante de la unidad de élite de su fuerza aérea ha muerto en enfrentamientos con HAMAS en la Franja de Gaza. Es el cuarto desde el 7 de octubre.\nMediante un comunicado emitido este miércoles, un portavoz del ejército israelí ha anunciado la muerte del comandante de la unidad Shaldag de la fuerza aérea israelí, Yitzhar Hoffman, de 36 años, en el campo de refugiados Shati, ubicado en el norte del enclave costero.\nHoffman fue uno de los encargados de la invasión y asedio al Hospital Al-Shifa, por lo que es responsable del asesinato de decenas de bebés y niños en ese centro médico.\nLos medios de la ocupación han descrito esta muerte como un “golpe muy grande” a las fuerzas armadas de este régimen. Hoffman era considerado uno de los principales oficiales militares en la guerra contra Gaza, y había mejorado los métodos terroristas de lucha dentro de los túneles de la Resistencia palestina.\nCon este deceso, se eleva a cuatro el número de tropas israelíes muertas durante las últimas 24 horas en los enfrentamientos con el Movimiento de la Resistencia Islámica Palestina (HAMAS). También, la cifra total de bajas militares israelíes desde el 7 de octubre de 2023 aumenta a 561, incluidos 224 que cayeron tras el inicio de la ofensiva terrestre contra la Franja.\nEsto mientras, la Resistencia palestina ha declarado en reiteradas ocasiones que las bajas israelíes son mayores a las que anuncian las autoridades israelíes.\n¿Qué es la Unidad Shildag del ejército de Israel?\nShildag es una de las principales unidades especiales del ejército de ocupación y tiene su cuartel general en la base aérea Palmachim, a unos 45 kilómetros al norte de la ciudad de Gaza.\nSoldados israelíes junto a la tumba de un militar ajusticiado en la Franja de Gaza.\nEjército israelí retira tropas militares y un batallón de Gaza\nLa Resistencia palestina sigue asestando duros golpes al ejército israelí en fuertes combates en el sur de Gaza, al destruir otros tres tanques del enemigo.\nLas Brigadas Al-Qassam, rama militar del Movimiento de la Resistencia Islámica Palestina (HAMAS), ha anunciado este domingo haber destruido dos tanques israelíes “Merkava” con misiles antiblindaje Yassin-105 en el barrio de Jouret Al Aqad, al sur de la ciudad de Jan Yunis, según ha informado la cadena catarí Al Jazeera.\nAsimismo, las Brigadas Al-Quds, el brazo militar la Yihad Islámica Palestina, ha dicho que se ha enfrentado a las fuerzas agresoras en Jan Yunis, y ha atacado un tanque israelí con un artefacto explosivo.\nEl grupo también ha dicho que atacó con granadas de mortero a las fuerzas israelíes en la ciudad de Gaza, en el norte del enclave costero.\nLos recientes daños sufridos por el ejército israelí se producen mientras que el Canal 12 de la televisión israelí ha anunciado hoy que las tropas israelíes enfrentan una violenta y fuerte resistencia en Jan Yunis, la mayor ciudad del sur de Gaza.\nAunque el ejército israelí afirma haber destruido varios túneles e instalaciones de HAMAS en Jan Yunis en las últimas semanas, las fuerzas sionistas siguen sufriendo muchas bajas en trampas explosivas y emboscadas bien preparadas por la Resistencia.\nEjército israelí retira tropas militares y un batallón de Khan Yunis\nEl anuncio de su retirada fue simultáneo con informes israelíes de que el ejército reducirá el número de sus fuerzas en el norte de Gaza.\nEl ejército israelí redujo las fuerzas de reserva en la Franja de Gaza y retiró el batallón Kiryati (7107) de Khan Yunis, después de meses de cruentos combates con la resistencia palestina.\nSegún el canal israelí 13, este batallón es una de las unidades de ingenieros de combate de las Fuerzas de Reserva y participó en combates en el norte de la Franja.\nEl anuncio de su retirada fue simultáneo con informes de que el ejército reducirá el número de sus fuerzas en el norte.\nAdemás, el Batallón 7107 no es la primera unidad que se retira de las operaciones, pues a finales de diciembre pasado, las fuerzas de élite Brigada Golani retiraron un batallón de la Franja de Gaza.\nEl excomandante de esa brigada, Moshé Kaplanski, declaró que el escuadrón perdió un cuarto de sus fuerzas entre muertos y heridos desde el 7 de octubre de 2023.\nHasta el momento, el número de soldados israelíes heridos en los frentes del sur con Gaza y del norte con Líbano llegó a 4 mil 600, y las lesiones en las filas son de alrededor de 60 heridos por día.\nDe acuerdo con datos del Ministerio de Seguridad de la ocupación, más de 530 efectivos fueron abatidos.\nAsimismo, las estimaciones israelíes sugieren que el número de discapacitados alcanzará los 100 mil para fines de 2030.",

Cette déclaration a été faite par le Conseil de paix et de sécurité de l'UA dans un communiqué publié samedi à l'issue d'une réunion qui portait notamment sur la situation dans l'est de la République démocratique du Congo (RDC), une zone où sévit actuellement un conflit. Réitérant sa profonde inquiétude quant au fléau que représentent les conflits dans différentes régions d'Afrique, le Conseil a déclaré que les conflits et l'insécurité entravaient le développement socio-économique du continent. Dans ce contexte, le Conseil a réaffirmé la détermination des 55 membres de l'organisation continentale à réaliser l'Agenda 2063, le plan de développement continental de l'UA sur 50 ans. Il a notamment mis l'accent sur ses aspirations phare en matière de paix et de sécurité, dont son intention de \"faire taire les armes en Afrique\" d'ici 2030. Il a en outre souligné la nécessité de concrétiser la récente promesse des dirigeants africains de parvenir à un continent sans conflit, de faire de la paix une réalité pour tous les citoyens africains et de ne pas léguer le fardeau de la guerre aux générations futures.",
