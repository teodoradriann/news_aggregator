File photo | News-Press NOW Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save The pavement on Interstate 229 couldn’t take the heat this summer.A scorching July day with temperatures above 90 degrees caused a section of the double-decker to buckle, forcing a portion of the highway to close for two weeks for maintenance.Troy Slagle with the Missouri Department of Transportation said this is an uncommon occurrence on bridges, but I-229 had issues that needed to be tended to immediately.Road crews began scheduled maintenance a little early to coincide with the emergency repairs and cause the least disruption to travelers.While the pavement may be stable, the bridge’s future isn’t. MoDOT is in the early stages of a project that would demolish the bridge and likely replace it with a four-lane roadway. MoDOT will soon submit its environmental assessment to the Federal Highway Administration for approval. After that, however, Northwest district engineer for MoDOT Marty Liles said it could still be five to seven years before all of the necessary funding is secured to move forward.

Otros buscaron aliviar el peso de la búsqueda de consensos y catalogaron esta situación como “una piedra más en el camino” que “podría encapsularse”.

    "title": "Remembering the Life of Legendary Outfielder Willie Mays, the 'Say Hey Kid'",
    "text": "Willie Mays, whose unique collection of skills made him the greatest center fielder who ever lived, died at 93 years old in the Bay Area. Michael Mays said in a statement released by the San Francisco Giants, “My father has passed away peacefully and among loved ones. I want to thank you all from the bottom of my broken heart for the unwavering love you have shown him over the years. You have been his life’s blood.” The “Say Hey Kid” left an undeniable mark on the sport, with his name a constant throughout baseball’s hallowed record book and his defensive expertise, epitomized by “The Catch” in Game 1 of the 1954 World Series, second to none.\nAll told, in a career that spanned 20-plus years (1951-73) — most of them with his beloved Giants — he made 24 All-Star teams, won two National League MVP awards and had 12 Gold Gloves. He ranks sixth all-time in home runs (660), seventh in runs scored (2,068), 10th in RBIs (1,909) and 12th in hits (3,293). Giants chairman Greg Johnson said in a statement, “Today we have lost a true legend. In the pantheon of baseball greats, Willie Mays’ combination of tremendous talent, keen intellect, showmanship, and boundless joy set him apart. A 24-time All-Star, the Say Hey Kid is the ultimate Forever Giant. Johnson continued, “He had a profound influence not only on the game of baseball but on the fabric of America. He was an inspiration and a hero who will be forever remembered and deeply missed.”\nView this post on Instagram\nFellow Giants legend Barry Bonds, who is Mays’ godson and sits just five spots above him on the all-time home run leaderboard, said Mays “helped shape me to be who I am today” in a\nmessage shared on social media. Mays’ death comes two days before the Giants are set to play the St. Louis Cardinals at Rickwood Field in Birmingham, Alabama, in a game honoring Mays and the Negro Leagues as a whole. It was announced Monday that Mays would not be able to attend.\nMays, who was born on May 6, 1931, and grew up in Alabama, began his professional career at age 17 in 1948 with the Birmingham Black Barons, helping the team to the Negro League World Series that season. MLB has been working with the city of Birmingham and the Friends of Rickwood nonprofit group to renovate the 10,800-seat ballpark, which, at 114 years old, is the oldest professional ballpark in the United States.\n“The game at historic Rickwood Field was designed to be a celebration of Willie Mays and his peers,” MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. “With sadness in our hearts, it will now also serve as a national remembrance of an American who will forever remain on the short list of the most impactful individuals our great game has ever known.” The Giants were playing the Cubs in Chicago; the Wrigley Field crowd of 36,292 stood in a salute to Mays during a moment of silence when his death was announced on the left-field video board in the sixth inning.\n“It’s heavy hearts for not only the Bay Area and New York where he started, but the baseball world,” said Giants manager Bob Melvin, who learned of Mays’ death right before the start of the game. “This is one of the true icons of the game.”",

    "title": "After war, heat, bots and Barbie, world rings in 2024 - Japan Today",
    "text": "Jubilant crowds will bid farewell to the hottest year on record Sunday, closing a turbulent 12 months marked by clever chatbots, climate crises and wrenching wars in Gaza and Ukraine.\nThe world's population -- now over eight billion -- will see out the old and usher in the new, with many hoping to shake the weight of high living costs and global tumult.\nIn Sydney, the self-proclaimed \"New Year's capital of the world\", more than a million partygoers are expected to pack the city's foreshore.\nEven before nightfall, tens of thousands of people gathered at vantage points around the city's iconic Harbour Bridge, defying uncharacteristically dank weather.\nAt midnight, eight tons of fireworks will light the fuse on 2024, a year that will bring elections concerning half the world's population and a summer Olympiad celebrated in Paris.\nThe last 12 months brought \"Barbiegeddon\" at the box office, a proliferation of human-seeming artificial intelligence tools and a world-first whole-eye transplant.\nIndia outgrew China as the world's most populous country, and then became the first nation to land a rocket on the dark side of the moon.\nIt was also the hottest year since records began in 1880, with a spate of climate-fueled disasters striking from Australia to the Horn of Africa and the Amazon basin.\nFans bade adieu to \"Queen of Rock 'n' Roll\" Tina Turner, \"Friends\" actor Matthew Perry, hell-raising Anglo-Irish songsmith Shane MacGowan and master dystopian novelist Cormac McCarthy.\nPerhaps more than anything, 2023 will be remembered for war in the Middle East -- for Hamas's brutal October 7 raids on southern Israel and Israel's ferocious reprisals.\nThe United Nations estimates that almost two million Gazans have been displaced since Israel's siege began -- about 85 percent of the peacetime population.\nWith once-bustling Gaza City neighborhoods reduced to rubble, there were few places left to mark the new year -- and fewer loved ones to celebrate with.\n\"It was a black year full of tragedies,\" said Abed Akkawi, who fled the city with his wife and three children.\nThe 37-year-old, now living in a U.N. shelter in Rafah, southern Gaza, said the war had obliterated his house and killed his brother.\nBut still, he clings to modest hopes for 2024.\n\"God willing this war will end, the new year will be a better one, and we will be able to return to our homes and rebuild them, or even live in a tent on the rubble,\" he told AFP.\nIn Ukraine, where Russia's invasion grinds towards its second anniversary, there was also hope, and defiance in the face of a renewed assault from Moscow.\n\"Victory! We are waiting for it and believe that Ukraine will win,\" said Tetiana Shostka as air raid sirens blared in Kyiv.\n\"We will have everything we want if Ukraine is free, without Russia,\" the 42-year-old added.\nSome in Vladimir Putin's Russia are also weary of the conflict.\n\"In the new year I would like the war to end, a new president, and a return to normal life,\" said 55-year-old theatre decorator and Moscow resident Zoya Karpova.\nPutin is already his country's longest-tenured leader since Joseph Stalin and his name will again be on the ballot paper when Russians vote in March.\nFew expect the vote to be fully free or fair, or for the former KGB man to return to the shadows.\nRussia's is just one of several pivotal elections scheduled, with 2024 looming as the year of the ballots.\nIn all, the political fate of more than four billion people will be decided in contests that will shape Britain, the European Union, India, Indonesia, Mexico, South Africa, Venezuela and a host of other nations.\nBut one election promises global consequences.\nIn the United States, Democrat Joe Biden, aged 81, and Republican Donald Trump, aged 77, appear set to rerun their divisive 2020 presidential poll race in November.\nAs the incumbent, Biden has at times appeared to show his advancing age and even his supporters worry about the toll of another bruising four years in office.\nBut if there are worries about what a second Biden administration would look like, there are at least as many concerns about a return of Trump.\nHe faces prosecution on several counts, and voters could yet decide whether the bombastic self-proclaimed billionaire goes to the Oval Office or to jail.",
