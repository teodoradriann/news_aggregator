    "title": "Bitcoin Miner Stocks Beat Blue-Chips In Trading Volumes, Analyst Says Miners To Peak As BTC Rallies - Benzinga",
    "text": " Bitcoin miner stocks have witnessed a significant rally in trading volumes compared to blue-chip stocks on the exchange amidst the rise in traders’ interest in Bitcoin.\nWhat Happened: Based on data, Bitcoin miners such as Marathon Digital Holdings Inc MARA reported a trading volume of 98 million at the time of writing compared to 81.3 million of Tesla Inc TSLA , Apple Inc AAPL at 19.9 million and Nio Inc - ADR NIO with 71.5 million. Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN , Meta Platforms Inc. META and Palantir Technologies PLTR reported 16.5 million, 7.2 million, and 28.1 million, respectively.\nAmong the other Bitcoin miners, TerraWulf Inc WULF reported 49.4 million, Riot Platforms Inc RIOT stood at 36.7 million followed by Bitfarms Ltd BITF at 29.5 million, CleanSpark Inc CLSK at 20.2 million and Bit Digital Inc BTBT at 18.6 million.\nMike Alfred, an engaged value investor, took to X and said , \"Heavy algo activity after hours in the select group of miners I watch outside regular market hours. Every time I've seen this recently, it's had a perfect record calling a big move up the following day. The big squeeze is already on but we may see even more participation tomorrow\"\nBitcoin mining companies are looking to expand operations on the heels of a likely spot Bitcoin ETF approval and the scheduled Bitcoin halving event in April 2024.\nWhy It Matters: Marathon Digital announced purchasing new mining sites for $178.6 million adding 390 MW capacity. This will reduce the cost per coin mined by around 30%.\nTerraWulf today reported a fully funded 7.9 EH/s expansion, increasing self-mining capacity by 58%. It also highlighted future expansion plans which are likely to bring total operational capacity to ~10 EH/s.\nBit Digital announced to target the doubling of its operating fleet in its Bitcoin mining operations, to around 6.0 EH/s, during 2024. Bitfarms is expected to receive delivery of 35,888 Bitmain T21 miners in 1H24. It has the option to acquire an additional 28,000 Bitmain T21 miners. These expansions could take the company’s operational capacity to 17 EH/s during 2H24.\nBased on data from Blockchain.com, Bitcoin miners’ revenue as of Dec. 28 stood at $46.8 million, the highest in 2023. The revenue has not reached that level since March 2022.\nCrypto quant trader Charles Edwards went on X on Dec. 27, writing , “Bitcoin miners are absolutely printing. With Miner Price at $64K, they are making 50% extra on top of the Bitcoin price.”\nAnother user, cycle forecaster and chartist MortensenBach said , “Bears keep telling me that the miners won’t reach ATH due to share dilution. Let me tell you, when Bitcoin is trading at 100,000-150,000, many of the miners will definitely be at ATH. As an example; In the last bull run $MARA gained 2,500% in 4.5 months from Nov 2020 to March 2021!”\nRead Next: Tired Of Shady Stablecoins?

    "title": "The Argyle Declaration has relieved Guyana of the threat of imminent invasion - Kaieteur News",
    "text": "Latest update December 30th, 2023 12:59 AM Dec 30, 2023 [Letters](https://www.kaieteurnewsonline.com/category/letters/) Only a few people in this world are truly greedy. Most would be content with being able to live in harmony with their neighbours, enjoying a life free of financial worries. The motivation of the greedy is ultimately founded upon denying or taking from others what is their rightful due. The Venezuelan people are not greedy. The upper classes want to live the 21st Century lives they had become accustomed to before Chavez, whilst the masses long for the social largesse they enjoyed during the Chavez years, although the upper classes would not have minded that too much if things had settled there – then came the oil price crash! The exodus from Venezuela to anywhere else since around 2014 is estimated to number about 7M persons. After elections in 2018, the previously unelected Maduro was recognized in the region only by Cuba. Those who flee to Guyana generally hate Maduro and have no interest in his annexation talk. Most seek a life whereby they can be sure of eating one meal each day – a luxury for millions living in Venezuela – and be sure also of the prospect of building a future in a peaceful and progressive country. Today, the public approval rating of the Venezuelan leader stands at an uninspiring 29%. The Argyle Declaration has relieved Guyana of the threat of imminent invasion. Whilst Maduro might have been just sabre-rattling, we have no way to be sure about that. Taking possession of 60,000 square miles of jungle and mountains would be a monumental logistical adventure with several big challenges over and above legal factors and the support of Guyana’s allies. The Declaration has given Maduro enough to save face after all his bellicose talk, since he must surely know that he has the chance to save Venezuela now rather than allow the rot to accelerate with a vengeance, risking his own future if the US is given good excuse to deal militarily with his army. Venezuela recently strengthened its already strong trade ties with China, had some oil sanctions lifted by the USA, and also recently signed a LNG production deal with the Trinidad & Tobago Government and Shell. Maduro would be incredibly irrational to want to throw that all away now. “Now” is very much the operative word, for whilst everyone in Guyana and the wider region can now breathe a sigh of relief, Venezuelans have been taught from Primary School that “Essequiba” was taken from Venezuela by an imperialist conspiracy against their then young nation at the end of the 19th century. Legal tribunals often return wholly unexpected judgements – but in all real likelihood the ICJ will rule in Guyana’s favour. Venezuela does not recognize the jurisdiction of the World Court and is likely to renew its claim, regardless of the President at the helm, if or when it is thought expedient to do so – and likely for a domestic popularity purpose! We need to be prepared for such an eventuality and must be unified to be in any position to be so prepared. It is the combination of financial limitations, and more importantly, paranoia attributable to lack of unity, that accounts for the dire state of Guyana Defence Force inadequacy. Guyana started out as a new State in 1966 with little in the way of resources to build a large well-equipped army. Our leadership at the time recognized the Venezuelan threat and sought to ensure that we had a Force that would present a meaningful deterrent, considering always that population-wise Venezuela is around 30:1 vis-à-vis Guyana. A relatively strong army also equated jobs for otherwise unemployed mainly Afro-Guyanese youths, which was naturally considered a good thing at the time. Indo-Guyanese youths generally preferred to gravitate to their family businesses, get into entrepreneurial activity on their own account, or continue cutting sugar cane. After the PPP took the reins of Government in 1992, the GDF was not prioritized in any significant way, resulting in the acute diminution of the army’s capabilities. The capacity of the GDF needs to be massively upgraded if we should ever want to be capable of protecting our vast and valuable natural resources without depending upon the active help of other countries. With adequate capability, all we would ever need would be the weight of international law and opinion. We won’t need a standing army of 160,000 to deter (ours is purely a Defence Force) a potentially hostile standing army of 160,000 given our geographical position in relation to Venezuela and our fraternal relations with big brother Brazil. A standing army of 30,000 with a special corps trained by the SAS or US Special Forces, would pose a real deterrent backed up by 2 squadrons of fighter jets, 50 armoured vehicles in the South Rupununi to pull our own weight instead of leaving it all up to the Brazilians, and as many AI drones as we can realistically afford. This will cost a lot of money and will also depend upon quite a lot of unity! Because of historical factors dating back to the colonial era, a 30,000 strong army given current recruitment methods is likely to be disproportionately represented by Afro-Guyanese. This would be significantly fewer, so in the immediate future given the high levels of technical skills required by a modern army, which would thus attract a wider cross-section of young Guyanese – particularly so if salaries for skilled personnel were to be scaled with salaries offered in commerce and industry. The factor that would ensure this desired cross-section would be a unified population who identify and think as Guyanese – not as Afro-Guyanese or Indo-Guyanese or Amerindian! Our brothers and sisters of the other three Guyanese heritages, have no historical reason to think of themselves in Guyana as any other than Guyanese since their numbers are relatively small. The $1.2Bn supplemental for the GDF representing 5% of $24Bn recently approved by Parliament is a start. We ought to aim at 5% at least out of every annual budget with immediate effect. For this to be initiated by the incumbent Government would require a leap of faith. Fortunately, Maduro has caused us to focus on being unified. We ought to maintain that focus. Happy 2024!

Tra i temi delle conclusioni non ancora trattati, la competitività, e altre questioni tra cui migrazione, Moldavia, Montenegro e Georgia e il lavoro futuro sulle riforme. La posizione di Salvini «Quello che sta accadendo» sulle nomine Ue «puzza di colpo di Stato». Lo ha detto a Dritto e Rovescio su Rete4, il leader della Lega Matteo Salvini. «Milioni di europei hanno votato» e «hanno chiesto di cambiare l’Europa. E che cosa ti ripropongono quelli che hanno perso? Le stesse facce: la von der Leyen, un socialista al Consiglio europeo, una indicata da Macron per la politica estera. Penso sia assolutamente irrispettoso, arrogante. Se preferiscono la poltrona al voto popolare assicuro, a nome della Lega e dell’Italia, che li marcheremo centimetro per centimetro Non gliele faremo passare. Difenderemo il voto degli italiani».",
