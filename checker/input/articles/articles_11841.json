    "title": "Final Fantasy is in trouble. Does Metaphor: ReFantazio show it the way?",
    "text": "As Polygon’s [newly minted awards pundit](/awards), I’ve seen something pretty interesting transpire over the past month or so. When I started ranking contenders for The Game Awards’ top prize, [Game of the Year](/awards/450195/game-of-the-year-game-awards-frontrunners), I identified Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth as the frontrunner. It was a big game in a storied series and a favored genre, with high production values, a strong storyline, and a 90-plus Metacritic rating — all historic indicators of success with The Game Awards’ large and diverse voting jury. Final Fantasy is in trouble. Does Metaphor: ReFantazio show it the way? These days, it’s cool to be niche [Oli Welsh](/authors/oli-welsh)is senior editor, U.K., providing news, analysis, and criticism of film, TV, and games. He has been covering the business & culture of video games for two decades. But since the start of October, Rebirth has been wholly eclipsed in Game of the Year conversations by another game that has its roots in the 1990s Japanese role-playing game scene: Atlus’ Metaphor: ReFantazio. It has a weird title, relatively modest production values, and an old-school, niche ethos. But I’m confident that it surpasses its fellow RPG in the Game of the Year stakes, and its critical reputation outshines the Square Enix blockbuster more than its two-point Metacritic advantage might suggest. Metaphor is an original title from Atlus’ in-house team Studio Zero, makers of the fan-favorite Persona series. Atlus, [now a subsidiary of Sega](/2016/4/1/11345238/sega-will-publish-all-future-atlus-games-finalizes-acquisition), has been enthusiastically touting the game’s success; the company announced Metaphor sold a million copies on its launch day, making it Atlus’ fastest-selling game to date. By contrast, Square Enix’s public pronouncements about Rebirth — and last year’s Final Fantasy 16 — have been positively glum. At a financial briefing in May that was [made public in September](https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-admits-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-final-fantasy-16-profits-did-not-meet-expectations), Square Enix said profits from both blockbuster Final Fantasy games “did not meet expectations” and Rebirth sales were “not as strong as expected.” In April, game industry analyst Daniel Ahmad estimated that Rebirth was selling “[about half](https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1778751429919854691)” as many copies as its predecessor Final Fantasy 7 Remake did in a similar timeframe. Neither Square Enix nor Atlus has reported hard sales figures for the games, and it’s entirely possible that Rebirth has sold more copies than Metaphor — maybe even a lot more. But it’s clear that Metaphor’s publisher is happy with how things are going, and Rebirth’s publisher is not. More to the point, it’s clear that Atlus’ games are growing in stature in the culture, and Square Enix’s are shrinking. Persona 5’s lifetime sales across all its editions are [reportedly more than 8 million](https://vgsales.fandom.com/wiki/Megami_Tensei#Persona_series) — a number that’s in the same ballpark as [Final Fantasy 7 Remake’s sales](https://x.com/finalfantasyvii/status/1702446167185883194). That kind of success would have been unthinkable in the Persona series’ early days, when each new Persona game sold in the hundreds of thousands. Meanwhile, Square Enix is reaching for anything resembling the Final Fantasy series’ sales peak: [the original 1997 Final Fantasy 7](https://vgsales.fandom.com/wiki/Best-selling_Square_Enix_games#Unit_sales). (To be fair, this discounts the actual bestselling Final Fantasy game, the MMO phenomenon Final Fantasy 14, which is still going strong — but which arguably operates in a completely different sector of gaming.) One reason for Final Fantasy’s struggles is Square Enix’s [anachronistic tactic](/24166647/aaa-exclusive-games-are-dead-playstation-xbox-multiplatform) of PlayStation platform exclusivity, which it has already [promised to abandon](/24155266/square-enix-multiplatform-final-fantasy-7-rebirth). But another might be that Square Enix’s strategy for the series is out of step with contemporary gaming tastes. Final Fantasy is [one of the most famous brands in gaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_video_game_franchises), and Square Enix’s management ardently wants the series to take its place in gaming’s top flight once more. To that end, it’s configured its recent entries in the series as mainstream blockbuster games, with huge production budgets and cutting-edge visuals that gesture simultaneously toward the Final Fantasy history and toward generalized trends in contemporary AAA gaming: generic open-world design, sprawling hierarchies of content, and — in a marked shift away from the series’ roots — [real-time action combat](/23617590/final-fantasy-16-preview-ps5-square-enix). Metaphor, on the other hand, employs turn-based combat and visuals that combine strong character designs with anime stylization and sparse, functional environments. It doesn’t look like anyone’s idea of a mainstream AAA game — and it doesn’t play like one, either. Instead of trying to combine a 1990s RPG with a 2010s open-world action-adventure, Studio Zero burrows deep into its own niche. Metaphor establishes an ornate, original setting while exploring the curious features of Persona games in a new context — features like the sophisticated social simulation and the day-by-day structure that applies gentle time pressure and weekly rhythms to your adventuring. And yet, this highly specific gaming flavor seems to resonate increasingly with critics and gamers. There’s another example of this change in tastes happening in Western-style RPGs right now. Dragon Age: The Veilguard isn’t quite the open-world jamboree of its 2014 predecessor Inquisition, but it does try to broaden the appeal of BioWare’s games with its easygoing, action-style combat. And yet it has fewer players on Steam right now than Baldur’s Gate 3, a game released more than a year ago, with a fiddly, turn-based, tabletop-influenced game design that owes everything to the kind of hardcore Dungeons & Dragons simulators that BioWare (developer of the first two Baldur’s Gate games) used to make. Baldur’s Gate 3 is estimated to have sold around 15 million copies. Sales for The Veilguard aren’t known yet, although publisher EA’s silence on the matter is perhaps telling. There’s plenty of evidence, in role-playing gaming at least, of a shift that elevates sophisticated, niche designs above obvious stabs at mass appeal. For proof, you don’t need to look any further than the astonishing success of FromSoftware’s Elden Ring, a game that makes few concessions to approachability even as it expands FromSoft’s forbidding Soulslike template across an open world. This might also mean the epicenter of gaming culture is moving away from mass-marketed consoles and toward Steam, whose community tends to gravitate toward [highly](/gaming/24173617/banana-clicker-game-steam-egg) [specialized](/24140347/manor-lords-early-access-impressions-pc) [experiences](/24115870/stardew-valley-8-years-later-concernedape). Former Square Enix exec Jacob Navok [has surmised](https://x.com/JNavok/status/1793779717813723521) that the publisher likely set the budgets and strategies for its recent Final Fantasy games as much as a decade ago — the era of The Witcher 3 and Skyrim. Things looked very different then. If Square Enix wants to reclaim Final Fantasy’s glory days, it might need to let go of its blockbuster envy and mainstream ambitions, embrace the niche, and get weird again.

    "title": "Utah State QB Leaves College Football to Become Navy SEAL: 'This Is Where God's Calling Me'",
    "text": "Opinion\nUtah State QB Leaves College Football to Become Navy SEAL: 'This Is Where God's Calling Me'\nAt the height of personal glory, a young man soon to become a husband thought only of God and service.\nAccording to\nKSL, quarterback Levi Williams of the Utah State Aggies announced Monday that he would forego his final season of college football eligibility in hopes of joining the Navy SEALs.\nWhen KSL “Sports Zone’s” Hans and Scotty asked Williams how he explained his decision to his fiance — whom he plans to marry on Mar. 15 — the young quarterback cited the universe’s ultimate authority.\n“This is where\nGod’s calling me,” Williams recalled telling his soon-to-be wife. “Obviously, we can’t prepare for everything. There’s going to be some unexpected turns along the way. As long you trust God and trust me, I think we’re gonna be alright.”\nThat attitude certainly helped explain how Williams has achieved success as a college quarterback.\nStop the censors, sign up to get today's top stories delivered right to your inbox\nOn Saturday, Williams led the Aggies to a 44-41, double-overtime\nvictory over the New Mexico Lobos. In that game, he accounted for five total touchdowns, including the game-winner on a broken play in the second overtime.\nThe victory gave the Aggies six wins on the season and made them eligible for a postseason bowl game.\nReaders can view the game’s final play here:\nUTAH STATE IS BOWL ELIGIBLE ON A WILD PLAY\n[@USUFootball] [pic.twitter.com/vZWiRuDL8I]\n— CBS Sports College Football 🏈 (@CBSSportsCFB)\n[November 25, 2023]\nMeanwhile, Williams’ performance\nearned him the Mountain West Conference’s Offensive Player of the Week.\nIn light of his decision to work toward joining the\nSEALs, however, one suspects that Williams found more joy in his team’s accomplishment than in his own.\n“What I love about [the SEAL’s] ethos and their motto is that no one guy is better than the other. It takes all of them to complete a mission. I think that’s super critical … Just to have the ability to be part of that brotherhood, it would be a great honor,” Williams told Hans and Scotty.\nThat perspective undoubtedly helped Williams think beyond his college\nfootball career.\n“I love football, and it’s so great,” the quarterback said. “But I knew that, eventually, it was going to come to an end.”\nAnd if you cannot be part of a football team forever, why not join a bigger team with an even nobler purpose?\n“I just want to be in a spot where I can protect this great country where we get to play football with the freedom to do that. I think this is the best country in the world. So I’d like to keep it that way and protect it as long as I can,” Williams said.\nAs impressed as we are with Williams, the happiest people in this story have to be his future in-laws.\nAfter all, imagine your daughter finding an elite college athlete who thinks nothing of his personal accomplishments. Instead, he only wants to be a husband, serve his country and praise\nGod.\nThe U.S. Navy also should look forward to welcoming Williams into its family. While some commanders have gone nauseatingly\nwoke, the military as a whole remains an object of intense admiration for many Americans.\nIn fact, our entire experiment in republican self-government depends on people like Williams who voluntarily practice the\nChristian virtues of courage and humility. The experiment cannot survive otherwise.\nThis article appeared originally on\nThe Western Journal.",

Ces bugs n'ont pas été observés dans les versions précédentes, ce qui indique qu'un délai supplémentaire est nécessaire pour les corriger.\nOne UI 7 Beta peut ne pas être lancé en douceur, et il y a trop de bugs. Même dans la dernière version de XKB, il y a encore des bogues dans l'animation, et ce sont de nouveaux bogues.\nIl y a trop de choses pour lesquelles Samsung a pris du retard ces dernières années. Il est très difficile pour eux de se rattraper....\n- ICE UNIVERSE (@UniverseIce) 15 novembre 2024 Samsung prévoit de lancer la version bêta de One UI 7.0 pour la série Galaxy S24 dans certains pays le 17 novembre, mais cette information n'a pas encore été officiellement confirmée. Les premières mises à jour sont attendues en Corée du Sud et aux États-Unis, suivies par d'autres pays comme la Chine, l'Allemagne, l'Inde, la Pologne et le Royaume-Uni.\nMalgré les retards, l'entreprise se prépare à lancer un programme de test bêta et les utilisateurs peuvent s'attendre à des améliorations significatives du design et des fonctionnalités de l'interface. Toutefois, compte tenu des problèmes actuels, il est conseillé aux utilisateurs d'être prudents avant d'installer la version bêta de One UI 7.0.\nSource : @UniverseIce @UniverseIce",

    "text": "Lowering credit card processing fees is a crucial aspect for businesses striving to maximize profitability while ensuring a seamless payment experience for their customers. In today's dynamic market, where digital transactions are predominant, understanding and implementing strategies to reduce these fees can significantly impact a company's bottom line. Negotiating Better Terms with Payment Processors One key approach to managing these costs is through negotiating better terms with payment processors. Businesses often overlook the potential savings that can be achieved by simply reviewing their current agreements and engaging in negotiations. This proactive stance can lead to more favorable rates and reduced per-transaction costs. Leveraging Advanced Payment Solutions Another effective strategy involves the integration of advanced payment solutions. Companies like Optimized Payments specialize in offering innovative payment processing systems that are not only efficient but also cost-effective. By leveraging the latest technologies in payment processing, businesses can reduce errors, minimize fraud, and lower their overall transaction fees. Staying Informed and Engaged It's essential for businesses to stay informed about the evolving landscape of payment processing. Engaging in additional reading and research, attending industry seminars, and networking with peers can provide valuable insights into new trends and technologies that can further aid in reducing credit card processing fees. Adopting Efficient Payment Methods Adopting more efficient payment methods is also a key factor. Encouraging the use of less costly payment methods, such as ACH transfers or digital wallets, can be beneficial. These methods often come with lower processing fees compared to traditional credit card transactions and can also offer customers more convenience and security. Regular Review of Billing Statements Moreover, maintaining a keen eye on billing statements and fees is vital. Regularly reviewing statements can help identify any discrepancies or unexpected charges. This vigilance ensures that businesses are not overpaying and helps in keeping track of fee changes that might occur over time. Educating Customers on Payment Options Businesses should also consider the role of customer education in reducing processing costs. Educating customers about the cost implications of different payment methods can subtly influence their choice of payment, potentially steering them towards less expensive options. This strategy not only helps in lowering processing fees but also enhances customer engagement and satisfaction. Utilizing Resources for Better Understanding In line with these strategies, it is important to keep in mind something like 10 Ways to Reduce Your Credit Card Processing Fees . These types of resources offer a comprehensive overview of various tactics and approaches that businesses can employ to minimize their processing costs. According to realtimecampaign.com, understanding the nuances of credit card processing fees and actively seeking ways to reduce them is an ongoing process. It requires a combination of staying informed, utilizing the right technologies, and engaging in best practices in payment processing. The ability to efficiently manage and lower credit card processing fees plays a significant role in the financial health of a business. By adopting a strategic approach, leveraging technology, and staying informed, companies can significantly reduce their processing costs, leading to improved profitability and enhanced customer experiences.

    "text": "Putin Warns Against 'Illusory' Attempts To Defeat Russia & America's 'Big Mistake' Of Weaponizing Dollar On the final day of the BRICS summit hosted in the Russian city of Kazan, President Vladimir Putin warned that efforts to defeat Russia on the battlefield are \"illusory\". Moscow's adversaries \"do not conceal their aim to deal our country a strategic defeat,\" Putin told the summit. \"I will say directly that these are illusory calculations, that can be made only by those who do not know Russia's history.\" He described that the Ukraine conflict has essentially become a proxy war, as \"Ukraine is being exploited to create critical threats to Russia’s security at the expense of its vital interests.\" He also said the West is \"ignoring... legitimate concerns and violating the rights of Russian-speaking individuals\" - in reference especially to the Russian-speaking Donbass region in the East, which Moscow forces have been solidifying control over. He also addressed the creation of a stable and fair Eurasian security order, through alliances like BRICS. \"The idea is that by joining efforts, we can reliably guarantee genuine stability and create conditions for the peaceful development of all states and peoples on the continent,\" Putin stated. Turning to the Gaza crisis, he stressed that though Russia stands against terrorism, the region is \"on the brink of full-scale war.\" He argued that the establishment of an independent Palestine in some form is vital. \"Addressing the historical injustice towards the Palestinian people could guarantee peace in the Middle East,\" Putin said. The BRICS family photo has expanded from year to year, reflecting the admission of new members: BRICS+ participants take family photo at summit in Kazan — RT (@RT_com)[pic.twitter.com/1kbs4o4Jeo][October 24, 2024] He hit upon the familiar them of multipolarity in world affairs, and condemned forces that seek to \"dominate everything and everyone.\" Of the Western drive to control the world, he described in the Thursday address that \"As a result, regional and global strategic stability is eroded, violating the principles of equal and indivisible security and triggering transnational and internal conflicts.\" And on Washington's \"big mistake\" of 'weaponizing' the dollar, he https://www.rt.com/news/606348-putin-dollar-political-gain/: \"The dollar remains the most important instrument of world finance and using it as a means of achieving political goals undermines confidence in this currency and reduces its capabilities.\" He explained that Russia is not trying to drop the dollar, but is actually \"prevented from working with it\" - and so \"Then we are forced to look for other alternatives, which is what is happening.\" Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro had some fiery words related to wars in the Middle East, and called out Israel... 🇻🇪 President Maduro at BRICS: \"Every time a high-precision missile falls on an apartment building in Gaza, Beirut, or the South of Lebanon, killing men, women and children, it sets fire and destruction to the United Nations system... A new world is possible.\" — COMBATE |🇵🇷 (@upholdreality)[pic.twitter.com/0eRipWTdLP][October 24, 2024] China's President Xi Jinping in addressing the forum said BRICS could be a \"stabilizing force for peace.\" On the Middle East, he said \"We need to continue to push for a ceasefire in Gaza, relaunch the two-state solution and stop the spread of war in Lebanon.\" Xi added: \"There should be no more suffering and destruction in Palestine and Lebanon.\" Xi and Putin shared a very lively private chat, and have been frequently seen together at the BRICS summit in Kazan, Russia: Mystery sealed with a handshake: Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping engage in a lively private chat at the BRICS summit — RT (@RT_com) What were they talking about? 🤔[pic.twitter.com/JciMrWgFnl][October 24, 2024] During the summit, the February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine didn't got without criticism. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who is later expected to meet one-on-one with President Putin, described that the full-scale invasion sets a \"dangerous precedent\" for the world.",
