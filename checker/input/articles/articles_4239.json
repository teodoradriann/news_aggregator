    "text": "Movies Pierce Brosnan cited for walking in Yellowstone Park thermal areas The James Bond star has been cited by Wyoming authorities. By Clark Collis Clark Collis Senior Writer EW's editorial guidelines Published on December 28, 2023 What would Miss Moneypenny say? Former James Bond actor Pierce Brosnan has been cited in Wyoming after allegedly walking in thermal areas of Yellowstone National Park, according to a court document obtained by People. A criminal docket filed in the U.S. District Court in Wyoming on Tuesday reveals that Brosnan, 70, received citations for traveling by foot “in all thermal areas and w/in Yellowstone Canyon confined to trails\" and “violating closures and use limits” on Nov. 1. Both citations are listed as petty offenses. The Irish actor has been ordered to appear at the Yellowstone Justice Center on Jan. 23. Pierce Brosnan. Leon Bennett/WireImage Yellowstone Park has an array of hydrothermal features including hot springs, geysers and mudpots. The park's official website warns visitors to, \"Stay on boardwalks and trails in thermal areas. Hot springs have injured or killed more people in Yellowstone than any other feature.\" Brosnan has recently been shooting a western titled Unholy Trinity at the Yellowstone Film Ranch in Montana. The actor played James Bond in four films, from 1995's GoldenEye to 2002's Die Another Day. His many other movie credits include 1993's Mrs. Doubtfire, 1996's Mars Attacks!, the 1999 remake of The Thomas Crown Affair, 2010's Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief, 2013's The World's End, and last year's Black Adam. A representative for Brosnan did not immediately respond to EW's request for comment. Want more movie news?

    "title": "塔里木油田超深层油气产量达1.5亿吨_央广网",
    "text": "记者今天（3月13日）从中国石油获悉，我国最大超深油气生产基地——塔里木油田，已累计从6000米以下地层采出油气1.5亿吨油气当量，相当于去年全国油气产量的37%。\n在油气开发中，国际上一般将埋深超过4500米的地层称为深层，而埋深超过6000米被称为超深层。今年前两个月，塔里木油田加速超深层油气开发，从中采出油气当量突破300万吨，超深层油气产量逐日增长，成为增储上产主力。\n塔里木盆地是我国面积最大的含油气盆地，超深油气资源储量丰富。我国首口超万米科探井——深地塔科1井日前在这里钻到了地下10910米，在全球范围内首次发现地下万米的油气资源，为深地资源开发利用提供了坚实支撑。\n过去一段时间，我国油气勘探主要集中在中浅层，经过几十年的开发，老油田储量递减、开采难度加大，我国新增油气的储量主要来源于深层。目前，塔里木油田在天山南麓及塔克拉玛干沙漠腹地已建成五个深层、超深层石油、天然气主力产区。\n（总台央视记者 朱江 张伟）\n编辑:高杨\n更多精彩资讯请在应用市场下载“央广网”客户端。欢迎提供新闻线索，24小时报料热线400-800-0088；消费者也可通过央广网“啄木鸟消费者投诉平台”线上投诉。版权声明：本文章版权归属央广网所有，未经授权不得转载。转载请联系：cnrbanquan@cnr.cn，不尊重原创的行为我们将追究责任。\n长按二维码\n关注精彩内容\n关注精彩内容",
