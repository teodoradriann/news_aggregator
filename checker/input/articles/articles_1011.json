    "title": "David Murphey, '90 Day Fiancé' personality, dies at 66 after years of 'health issues'",
    "text": "Los Angeles Times (TNS)\nLOS ANGELES — David Murphey, a software engineer who appeared in TLC’s “90 Day Fiancé” franchise, has died.\nMurphey died at his Nevada home Dec. 11 after “experiencing health issues over the last several years” of his life, his family announced Wednesday in a statement posted to Instagram and Facebook. He was 66.\n“He will be deeply missed by his family, friends and fans,” his loved ones said.\nMurphey appeared on Season 4 of the “90 Day Fiancé” spinoff series “Before the 90 Days,” which chronicled his relationship with Ukrainian girlfriend Lana. When his season debuted in 2020, Murphey was preparing for retirement and a life on the road.\n“I can’t wait to start this new life living in the RV full-time and I want to share that with someone,” he said at the time.\nSeveral years prior to his “90 Day Fiancé” spotlight, Murphey struck up a connection with Lana, whom he met on an online dating site.\nAfter several attempts to meet in person, Murphey and his now-ex reunited in Ukraine, starting their road to a life together that would eventually prove complicated. As the season progressed, Lana, then 28, admitted she didn’t spark a connection with only Murphey and had been talking to other men. Despite this, Murphey proposed to Lana in the season finale.\n“I have my girl now, I really have her ... she’s now mine,” he said in a confessional interview shortly after the proposal. “I have my other half now. I did it.”\nThe engagement, however, didn’t mean happily ever after for the couple. In 2022, during an appearance on “90 Day Diaries,” Murphey confirmed his romance with Lana was over.\nIn the following years, Murphey turned his focus to traveling across the nation, sharing his road trips with fans on Instagram. He told social media followers in 2022 that he was hospitalized and detailed several health issues — including blood clots in his lungs and blockages in his liver and pancreas.\nMurphey’s final post, shared before the family’s Wednesday statement, was a 2023 video of him telling fans he has been living with “more of the same problems” from his hospitalization. “My liver’s not working right,” he said, adding that doctors “can’t figure it out.”\n“I’ve been really out of commission. I’ve been canceling all these trips,” he added. Later in the Instagram Live session, Murphey admitted he “never felt any heartache” over his ex-girlfriend and distanced himself from his time on the series.\nBefore his death, Murphey retired from the Clark County Treasurer’s Office, his family said. He previously worked at H&R Block and gaming company IGT. Beyond his career and “90 Day Fiancé” stardom, Murphey was known for his “fierce” love for cats, his family said.\n“He always made an effort to adopt cats and give them a good loving home,” said the statement, which added that donations in Murphey’s name could be made to the Animal Foundation in Las Vegas.\nMurphey is survived by two sisters and his cat, Gamera.",

The trick was to absolutely not think about it. Not on the subway there. Not on the beach. Not while I was taking off layers. Not even while I was running in! I went for the ‘don’t think, only do’ version, which gave me no time to chicken out.” Says Mel on [welcome to the new year](https://cupofjo.com/2024/01/03/happy-new-year-2024/): I recently did a ‘cold plunge’ and thought ‘I’m from Wisconsin, live in Minnesota and love the cold, so how hard can this be?’ Oh man. I was terribly wrong. It physically HURT. But now I’ve started doing cold showers. I read that you should slowly turn it cold, but I say rip off the bandaid, then get nutty. I shout-count 1 to 60 in an absurd sing-songy voice while doing lunges and squats. My little girls dance around the bathroom. It’s still horrible but afterward I feel like a million dollars.” Says Rachel on [lovely and giddy marriage proposal](https://cupofjo.com/2024/01/04/how-lovely-and-giddy-is-this-marriage-proposal/): “I was hanging on by a thread emotionally that whole story and then HIS DOG GIVES HIM A HIGH FIVE?!

    "text": "The number of new study permits approved in 2025 is expected to drop by 50 per cent from last year as a growing number of the permits are going to international students changing schools or programs, or extending their studies in Canada, according to new projections.\nFewer new international students — the result of a decline in new study permit applications and approval rates — could spell trouble for the postsecondary education sector, which will continue to see enrolment drop for at least the next three years, warns an analysis by ApplyBoard based on the latest government data.\n“Onshore students and students extending their studies may help Canada reach its cap targets in 2025, but this trend is unlikely to hold in future years,” said the forecast released Wednesday.\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW “Search engine data has shown that interest in studying in Canada has fallen at a greater rate than for Australia, the U.K. or the U.S. And with issued study permit extensions now outpacing new study permits, the flow of new international students toward Canadian institutions is weakening.”\nCanada should be alarmed by the low new student count, said Meti Basiri, CEO and co-founder of the online marketplace for learning institutions and international students.\n“We have effectively closed the tap,” he told the Star. “When your graduation exceeds significantly your entry into the process ... two years from now you will have no students because you graduated everyone.”\nLast year, Ottawa capped the number of new study permits issued in order to reduce international student admission by 35 per cent, as Canada’s temporary resident population was soaring. The cap did not apply to students for master’s and doctoral programs or in elementary and secondary schools.\nThis year, the study permit caps were reduced by another 10 per cent and include those pursuing post-graduate studies in the country.\nLeveraging early 2025 study permit data, ApplyBoard projects the total number of study permits issued may reach 420,000, just short of the overall cap (437,000). However, Basiri said that’s deceiving because only 163,000 of these permits are going to new international students, half of the volume admitted in 2024 and nearly 70 per cent fewer than 2023.\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW “The total number of students still seems high, but give it 18 months or 24 months from now, you all of a sudden have a significant shortage of the students,” he said. “Why? Because the top of the funnel wasn’t filling up.”\nLisa Brunner, a research fellow at the UBC Centre for Migration Studies, believes the softened demand has to do more with the post-graduation work permit changes than the cap. Many international students study abroad to ultimately obtain permanent residence but the changing policies have made it difficult to plan toward that goal.\nOn Wednesday, the Immigration Department added 119 and removed 178 fields of study in key sectors from the work permit eligibility list for international graduates .\n“Many international students in Canada today feel betrayed by the lack of permanent residency options that were promised to them,” said Brunner, who studies migration and education.\n“If Canada does not make viable, predictable permanent residency pathways clear for international students, a portion of new students will turn to other so-called competitor countries.”\nApplyBoard’s projection takes into account two significant shifts that have occurred in the past 18 months: falling study permit approval rates and a significant increase in study permit extensions.\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW Study permit extensions will account for over 60 per cent or 260,000 of the 420,000 total study permits issued in 2025, it noted, up from 44 per cent in 2024 and 29 per cent in 2023.\nBetween January and April of this year, there was a 30 per cent drop in new study permit applications compared to the same months in 2024 and 70 per cent compared to 2023. The new study permit approval rates also declined to 33 per cent over the first four months of 2025, resulting in less than 31,000 new approvals.\nBasiri said Ottawa’s study permit caps were established in part on the 60 per cent approval rate in 2023, almost double the current rate. It means a bigger pool of applicants is required to meet the targets.\nWhile colleges faced the most direct impacts of the caps in 2024 and continue to experience substantially lower demand in 2025, universities are now seeing a broader weakening of student demand, said ApplyBoard.\nAccording to the 2025 data, it said study permit applications for university bachelor programs dropped 39 per cent year-over-year, with applications for university graduate programs declining by 32 per cent. Many educational institutions have already laid of staff and cancelled programs .\n“Fewer study permit applications are not necessarily bad,” said Brunner. “The question is how institutions, provinces and the federal government manage the economic consequences rippling across the higher education sector.”\nONTARIO NOW NEWSLETTER Get our free new weekly newsletter Error!

    "title": "Prefeitura de Blumenau e Ablutec travam guerra na Justiça por Concurso e Festival da Cerveja - NSC Total",
    "text": "Como já era de se esperar, a guerra deflagrada entre prefeitura de Blumenau e Associação Blumenauense de Turismo, Eventos e Cultura (Ablutec) pela “paternidade” do Concurso e do Festival Brasileiro da Cerveja, antes restrita a acusações e troca de farpas nos bastidores, foi parar na Justiça.\nContinua depois da publicidade\nEntre na comunidade exclusiva de colunistas do NSC Total\nDuas ações judiciais distintas protocoladas na terça-feira (11), uma patrocinada pelo município e a outra pela entidade, tratam sobre o direito à exploração e organização dos eventos. Ambos os processos tramitam na 1ª Vara da Fazenda Pública e Acidentes do Trabalho da Comarca de Blumenau e serão avaliados pelo mesmo juiz, Raphael de Oliveira e Silva Borges.\nTanto a Ablutec quanto a prefeitura vêm anunciando edições do Concurso e do Festival para março de 2025 em datas simultâneas, mas em cidades diferentes – em Balneário Camboriú e Blumenau. Na prática, no entanto, uma tenta frear a programação da outra.\nO que alega a prefeitura Na ação apresentada à Justiça, o município lista documentos do Instituto Nacional da Propriedade Intelectual (INPI) para provar que seria o legítimo detentor das marcas dos eventos. O pedido na ação é para que a Ablutec seja impedida de usá-las, inclusive em logomarcas que lembrem as programações.\nContinua depois da publicidade\nA prefeitura também reivindica que a associação seja impedida de dizer que está organizando a 16ª edição do Festival e a 13ª edição do Concurso em materiais de divulgação e contratos. Há uma ênfase nesses números por um entendimento de que os eventos seriam uma continuidade de programações historicamente fomentadas pelo município.\nEm outro pedido, a prefeitura defende que a Ablutec seja condenada a pagar uma indenização por danos materiais, em valor ainda a ser definido. E outra de R$ 50 mil a título de danos morais por supostos prejuízos à imagem e credibilidade da prefeitura junto à sociedade a partir de informações que induziriam o público e o mercado ao erro.\nO que diz a Ablutec Na outra ação, a Ablutec diz que criou o Festival da Cerveja em 2010, à época com apoio da prefeitura, que chegou a ocupar uma cadeira no conselho administrativo da associação. A entidade alega que a promoção do evento sempre foi privada e que o município teria se afastado da organização – o que não justificaria a decisão de “intervenção” agora.\nEm uma contraofensiva, a entidade pede que o processo de inexigibilidade que contratou a Escola Superior de Cerveja e Malte para a organização de um concurso de cervejas seja suspenso ou tornado sem efeito. A Ablutec entende que a contratação, em vez de assessoria ou consultoria, seria para a realização do evento, o que seria irregular e dependeria de licitação aberta à concorrência que a própria associação poderia participar.\nContinua depois da publicidade\nA Ablutec também reivindica que contratos administrativos e outros documentos firmados com a Associação Blumenau Capital Brasileira da Cerveja para execução do festival também sejam suspensos ou tornados sem efeito. Se os pedidos não forem aceitos, a associação pede que a Justiça determine a elaboração de processos licitatórios para a organização dos eventos com todas as etapas, publicações, editais e demais documentos previstos em lei.\nA palavra final está nas mãos do juiz.\nConfira fotos da edição deste ano do festival Foto: Patrick Rodrigues, NSC Total Foto: Patrick Rodrigues, NSC Total Foto: Patrick Rodrigues, NSC Total Foto: Patrick Rodrigues, NSC Total Foto: Patrick Rodrigues, NSC Total Foto: Patrick Rodrigues, NSC Total Foto: Patrick Rodrigues, NSC Total Foto: Patrick Rodrigues, NSC Total Foto: Patrick Rodrigues, NSC Total Voltar Avançar\nLeia também EXCLUSIVO: Shopee investe em novo centro logístico em SC\nGigante da indústria do papel anuncia investimento de R$ 90 milhões em SC\nSexta mais antiga do Brasil, empresa de SC marca data para inaugurar passeios de trem pela fábrica\nRodoviária de Blumenau deve ter investimento de R$ 144 milhões para mudar de cara\nReceba notícias e análises do colunista Pedro Machado pelo WhatsApp\nDestaques do NSC Total Dia de Santo Antônio: tradicional bolo atrai centenas de fiéis a igreja de Florianópolis Piloto catarinense busca pódio na pista onde Ayrton Senna teve a primeira vitória na F1 Liberação em contorno mostra novo traçado duplicado no Norte de SC Aeroporto de Joinville vai ganhar nova rota para São Paulo em outubro Criciúma apresenta imagens do projeto de ampliação do Heriberto Hülse Indicada ao Grammy Latino, cantora portuguesa Carminho vem a Florianópolis pela primeira vez TUM Festival faz campanha em Florianópolis para ajudar músicos atingidos por enchentes no RS Nahim teve \"noite de reconciliação\" com a ex antes de morrer; causa da morte é investigada Em quais países do mundo o aborto é legalizado ou permitido?
