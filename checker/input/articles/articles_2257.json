    "title": "India’s night temperature rise in October breaks all time record, November may be ‘above normal’ - The Hindu BusinessLine",
    "text": "India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Friday said that the average minimum temperature during October was 21.85 Degree Celsius, which is 1.85 Degree higher than normal and is also the highest since 1901. Region-wise too, the minimum temperature (recorded in the night) was the highest in the south, central and north-west meteorological subdivisions.\nBriefing the media, Mrityunjay Mohapatra, IMD’s Director-General, said the rise in minimum temperature in the South has been continuous in the last few years, unlike in other regions. IMD data for October show that in 2024, the minimum temperature reached record 23.45 degree, whereas the second highest was 23.11 degree in 2021, 23.05 degree in 2017, 23.03 degree in 2019 and 23.02 degree in 2020 in the southern region.\nHe also said that October was the warmest pan-India basis since 1901, with the mean temperature recording 1.23 degree Celsius above normal. He said there was absence of western disturbances and influx of easterly winds due to active low pressure systems in the Bay of Bengal as both contributed to the rise in temperature. The mean temperature in October was 26.92 degrees against 25.69 degrees which is considered normal.\nHe said the temperature will continue to remain 2-5 degree Celsius above normal in the north-western plains at least for the next two weeks, before a gradual decline towards normalcy.\nAbove normal rains from N-E monsoon On the outlook for November, the IMD DG said that the north-east monsoon is expected to bring above normal rainfall in the southern peninsula comprising Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Karaikal, coastal Andhra Pradesh and Yanam, Rayalaseema, Kerala and Mahe and south interior Karnataka.\n“The above normal to normal rainfall is likely over most parts of the country except north-west and some areas of central India,” IMD said. However, Mohapatra said that while all other parts will have above normal minimum temperature, the north-west region may have ‘below normal’ temperature.\nAs wheat sowing has started, the prediction of “normal to below normal” maximum temperature over west central India and adjoining areas of north-west and north peninsular India, may help farmers to speed up the planting acrtivities, experts said.\nLa Nina in Dec Mohapatra said that all the global weather forecasting models, including IMD, had gone wrong in predicting the emergence of La Nina and the scientists have to do a study on the reason for this deviation. He said there is a higher chance of La Nina conditions developing by December in a gradual manner.\n“ENSO (El Nino–Southern Oscillation) conditions are slowly evolving towards the negative side and La Nina can set in by December,” Mohapatra said.",

    "text": "KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 31 (Bernama) -- Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Malaysia are committed to continuing humanitarian aid missions for Palestine in the upcoming year.\nOps Ihsan Secretariat chairman Jismi Johari said that NGOs would collect funds to provide necessities, including food and personal care items.\nHe said so far, three humanitarian aid missions for Palestine through Ops Ihsan had been carried out this year, namely on Nov 3, Nov 10 and Dec 19, with the value of goods including transport costs amounting to approximately RM14 million.\n\"Although we have distributed aid such as food, medicine and personal care items, it is still not enough to meet the needs of the people in Gaza.\n\"Currently, more than 1.7 million people there are homeless and living as refugees, so they need tents to be used as shelter and we hope to provide such assistance,\" he said when contacted by Bernama.\nJismi, who is also Malaysian Humanitarian Aid and Relief (MAHAR) president, said the next batch of assistance was expected to be sent in early January, involving 10 containers by sea.\nOps Ihsan, coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is led by MAHAR along with more than 50 other NGOs including Global Peace Mission (GPM) Malaysia, Red A Humanitarian Development Global, Mercy Malaysia, Pertubuhan Ihsan Johor, BeVital and the Malaysian Consultative Council of Islamic Organisations (Mapim).\nTouching on the Ops Ihsan Secretariat's plans for 2024, Jismi said it planned to help with tuition fees and living costs for Palestinians in Malaysia, while ensuring the handling of delivery aid for humanitarian missions at the hub in Cairo runs smoothly.\nMeanwhile, Muslim Care Malaysia president Zulkifli Wahijan said that the organisation had distributed RM3.5 million worth of donations to Palestine since Oct 10, which included dry food such as biscuits, rice, flour and beans, blankets and sweaters as well as solar panels to generate energy for various uses.\nHe said the organisation also planned to rebuild infrastructure such as mosques, schools and business centres that had been destroyed by Israeli military assaults.\n\"However, we hope and pray that the oppression there will stop so that reconstruction can be done,\" he said.\nMAPIM president Mohd Azmi Abdul Hamid, meanwhile, highlighted ongoing communication with NGOs in Gaza to determine the specific needs of the people in the region.\nHe said the collaborative approach involved discussing the essential goods required with local NGOs in Gaza and then coordinating with other NGOs in Malaysia, with a focus on addressing urgent needs and efficiently utilising donations received for the benefit of the affected communities.\n-- BERNAMA\nBERNAMA provides up-to-date authentic and comprehensive news and information which are disseminated via BERNAMA Wires; www.bernama.com; BERNAMA TV on Astro 502, unifi TV 631 and MYTV 121 IFLIX channels and BERNAMA Radio on FM93.9 (Klang Valley), FM107.5 (Johor), FM107.9 (Kota Kinabalu) and FM100.9 (Kuching) frequencies.\nFollow us on social media :\nFacebook : @bernamaofficial, @bernamatv, @bernamaradio\nTwitter : @bernama.com, @BernamaTV, @bernamaradio\nInstagram : @bernamaofficial, @bernamatvofficial, @bernamaradioofficial\nTikTok : @bernamaofficial",
