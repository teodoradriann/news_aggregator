    "text": "Russia said its forces now control the key Ukrainian town of Marinka earlier this week after months of fighting.\nIn a televised meeting on Tuesday with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said Russian “assault units have today completely liberated the settlement of Marinka.”\nUkrainian officials initially denied that the Russian army completely captured the eastern Ukrainian city, saying its armed forces retreated to the outskirts of the town to set up positions.\n“Our troops are in the administrative borders of Marinka, the battles for the city continue,” Oleksandr Shtupun, a spokesman for the Ukrainian military, said. “The city is completely destroyed, but it is incorrect to talk about the complete capture of Maryinka.”\n‘Here it is, our Marinka!’\nRussian state TV aired a report showing soldiers standing amid the rubble and destruction left behind in the eastern Ukrainian town, likening the struggle for the territory to the battle for the Reichstag in Berlin.\n“Here it is, our Marinka!” a person in the report says, motioning to a victory banner atop a ruined building in the decimated town .\nMarinka plays a crucial role in the Ukrainian defensive barrier.\nPutin said the apparent capture gives Russian troops “the opportunity to reach a wider operational area.”\nMarinka has been on the front lines of the Ukraine-Russia tensions since 2014.\nOver the last near-decade, Marinka has been pinned between Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists after Russia seized and annexed Crimea in 2014.\nIn June 2015, pro-Russian paramilitaries attacked Marinka, but Ukrainian armed forces pushed them out and the town was under Ukrainian control until its recent capture.\nResidents of Marinka had learned to live amid the conflict.\nIn 2017, a school principal told Business Insider through a translator that the children in Marinka “don’t care about their safety anymore.”\n“They got so adjusted to the situation,” the principal said. “… They hear the sounds of shelling and shooting, and they just don’t care that they could get hurt.”\nThey put sandbags in the windows of shops and schools to shield themselves from shellingThey cleaned up broken glass and debris left behind from artillery fire.Marinka is now a ghost town.\nAs the fighting intensified following Russia launching a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Ukrainian officials have been evacuating Marinka since late last year.\nRussian officials touted the capture of Marinka as a tactical gain.\n“Over the course of nine years, the Ukrainian armed forces created a powerful fortified area there, which was connected by underground passages,” Shoigu said. He added that each street was “fairly well protected from all attacks from both the air and field artillery structures, long-term firing points, and a complex system of underground communications.”\nExperts with the Institute for the Study of War, a DC-based think tank, said the capture “represents a limited Russian tactical gain” unless Russian forces improve issues with their armored vehicle attacks.\nThe city is now reduced to rubble, the tragic aftermath after months and years of fighting.\n“A small and completely destroyed settlement does not offer Russian forces a secure operational foothold from which to launch further offensive operations,” the group of experts with the ISW said.\nThe post Russians celebrated capturing a ghost town in Ukraine. Photos show how the war ruined it. appeared first on Business Insider .",

    "title": "Netflix fans disappointed as popular series set to leave streaming platform - The Mirror US",
    "text": "Netflix fans have been left disappointed after it emerged that one of the most popular series ever is set to leave the platform in two years' time.\nBreaking Bad, which first aired in 2008, has won a total of 16 Emmy Awards, including four Best Actor Emmys for star Bryan Cranston. In its five seasons, the show follows the story of Walter White, a terminally ill chemistry teacher who teams with a former student to manufacture crystal meth to secure his family's future.\nOther stars on the show are Aaron Paul (Jesse Pinkman), Bob Odenkirk (Saul Goodman) and Anna Gunn, who plays Walter's wife, Skyler White. All seasons of the series are now available on Netflix, but they will be exiting on April 18, 2027.\nPreviously, Breaking Bad was set to depart the streaming platform this year, but its license was extended for two more years following an agreement Sony Pictures Television. After it emerged that fans have just two more years to enjoy the show on Netflix, many have taken to social media to share their frustration.\nOne wrote on X, formerly called Twitter, \"This show should literally never leave Netflix. I just finished rewatching it again yesterday.\" Another said, \"Ok so I still have 2 more years to watch it 100 more times.\"\nA third agreed, \"They just raised the price & now they are taking away one of the best shows? That's so messed up!\" A fourth pointed out, \"Funny how Netflix announces a price increase one day, followed by one of the most popular shows that's on the platform being removed (I get it's not for 2 years, but the point still stands) the next.\"\nOne more fan wrote, \"Netflix is removing shows they never removed before.\" It comes days after Netflix announced it is increasing prices, with many disappointed fans threatening to cancel their subscription. The latest price hike comes on the heels of the streaming service reporting a record increase in subscriber numbers, boasting 19 million new subscribers in the last quarter of 2024.\nNetflix's ad-supported plan will be going from $6.99 to $7.99, its standard plan will increase from $15.49 to $17.99, and its premium plan will be raised from $22.99 to $24.99. Netflix has decided to increase monthly subscription costs despite the massive success of season 2 of Squid Game and NFL Christmas Day featuring Beyoncé, which saw record-breaking numbers for a live event with over 30 million viewers tuning in.\nSubscribers took to X, formerly Twitter, to complain about the price hike, with many vowing to cancel their subscription. Some viewers pointed out the irony in the fact that streaming services rose in popularity due to rising cable costs only to end up costing more than cable. One user wrote: \"Streaming will cost more than cable very soon. These prices are out of control.\"\nThe streaming service saw an annual operating income of over $10 billion, with its annual revenue increasing by 16%, according to the New York Times. With such success, streamers are chalking up the price hike to greed, with one X user saying: \"Lmao @netflix raising subscription prices because of an influx of new subscribers is the biggest greed move yet. You’re already gaining new profits…?\"\nClick here to follow the Mirror US on Google News to stay up to date with all the latest news, sport and entertainment stories.\nSign up to our FREE newsletter and get the top stories to your inbox\nDAILY NEWSLETTER: Sign up here to get the latest news and updates from the Mirror US straight to your inbox with our FREE newsletter.",

    "title": "Port Huron kids organize community snowball fight",
    "text": "[McKenna Golat](/staff/7534194001/mckenna-golat/) PORT HURON — Snowballs were flying over the weekend thanks to local kids looking for some winter fun. Gavin Tucker, 13, posted to Facebook on Friday that he and his friends were going to have a snowball fight the next day at Roosevelt Elementary School playground. The post was inviting other local kids to join in on the fun. About a dozen children were at the playground by 2 p.m. on Saturday. Some were engaged in the snowball fight, while other played on the play sets and built forts. Tucker said he and his friend, Allen Lloyd, 12, thought of the idea after playing outside the night before with a snowball maker. The two thought it would be fun to organize a bunch of people to have a giant snowball fight. \"I'm extremely proud of the turnout,\" Tucker said. \"I didn't care about how many people showed up. We just wanted to have some fun.\" Lloyd said he thought it was super cool that people came out to join them. After seeing the Facebook post, Nick and Emily Humphries decided to bring one of their sons and neighbor. They said they thought it was great to see that a kid organized a fun event and wanted to partake in the action. \"It seems like this doesn't happen as much anymore,\" Nick Humphries said. \"To see something like this be set up is awesome.\" Emily Humphries said it was especially nice to see that it was kids that organized it. She said it's great that kids are going outside rather than spending the entire day online. She said the only thing that would have made it better was more snow and less wind. The original Facebook post was asking for kids between the ages of 10 and 18 to join. After seeing the comments, Tucker updated the post to expand the age range to anyone under 25. He said this way, more people could join the fun. Tucker and Lloyd said they would like to organize more community snowball fights throughout the winter. Contact McKenna Golat at mgolat@gannett.com.
