No hay posibilidad de que esto se sostenga en el tiempo\".\n\"Cuando uno va a la oficina del PAMI ve gente muy angustiada\", subrayó el diputado, ya que desde este mes solo pueden acceder a la cobertura total de su medicación quienes tengan ingresos menores a 1,5 haberes previsionales mínimos.\nPor otra parte, criticó a los políticos radicales, ya que \"transan permanentemente, mientras que el PRO que está con los libertarios\".\n\"Se puede sacar una ley que garantice mejor salarios a los jubilados, pero si el presidente (Javier) Milei veta todo no se puede sostener\", advirtió.",

Listen, I had 107,000 people in new Jersey. You didn't report it. I'm so glad you asked. What did you have yesterday? 2000 people. If I ever had 2000 people, you'd say my campaign is finished. It's so dishonest, the press. And here's a great example, I had in Michigan recently 25,000 people, and 25,000 people we just couldn't get them in. We had in Harrisburg 20-25,000 people and 20,000 people couldn't get in. We had so many.

    "text": "PORT CHARLOTTE – The first eight innings of Wednesday’s 5-2 victory against the Pirates were pretty impressive for the Rays.\nStarter Zack Littell threw six strong innings, shortstop Taylor Walls made some highlight-reel defensive stops, and Eloy Jimenez and Danny Jansen both hit home runs. Still, it was the ninth inning that seemed to excite manager Kevin Cash the most.\nCloser Pete Fairbanks looked impressive with a three-up, three-down inning, throwing eight strikes among his 11 pitches. Fairbanks struggled with his control earlier in the camp and spent time working on his delivery with pitching coaches Kyle Snyder and Jorge Moncada.\n“The strike zone and the velocity uptick? He was up to 97 to 99 mph. Really encouraged,” Cash said. “That was probably the brightest spot of the day. There was a lot to like. (Josh) Lowe swinging the bat well, Mason Montgomery and Manny (Rodriguez) both came in and did well, Littell looked like himself with a nice bounce-back outing.\n“But highlighted by Pete right there. That was awesome.”\nAnother Jansen jack Jansen, one of Tampa Bay’s two main offseason acquisitions, has quietly put together a strong spring. The former Toronto and Boston catcher is hitting .320 with a team-high six walks and yanked his second home run down the leftfield line. “It feels like we’ve seen that a lot,” Cash said. “He’s hit some pull-side home runs against us.

    "title": "NASA Worried About Second Trapped Astronauts Health After Sunita Williams' Weight Loss",
    "text": "The mission to the ISS was only supposed to be a few days, but after the Boeing capsule designated to return to earth developed faults, the residents have become trapped. Since, both NASA and other observers have become concerned about the two astronauts health, noting serious weight loss.\nOriginally, it was 59-year-old Sunita Williams that began to show serious signs of weight loss , raising concerns about the astronauts' health. However, since then, the health of 61-year-old Barry Wilmore has also become a worry.\nTheir trip was only supposed to be a few days, but has now been extended to over 150. The faulty return capsule is unusable, meaning that a rescue vehicle will have to be sent out. This is being built by Space X and expected to be ready by February 2025. Until then, the astronauts will just have to hang tight.\nIn the meantime, the health of both astronauts is being carefully monitored. But, Williams weight has become a point of concern. She is looking significantly more gaunt than when she left. Wilmore, despite being significantly heavier than her on take off, is also showing signs of weight loss.\nIt's pretty hard to measure weight in zero gravity though, so presumptions are being made mostly on appearance. One employee noted that \"He had a lot more mass at the start, so it's not as big of a deal,\" referring to Wilmore's 210 pound weight on liftoff.\nThere Could Be A Few Reasons For Astronauts Health Concerns In an interview, Williams addressed concerns about the two astronauts health. When asked about the weight loss, she reassured everyone they were both doing just fine. She actually said she had put on muscle while aboard the International Space Station. \"My thighs are a little bit bigger, my butt is a little bit bigger. We do a lot of squats,\" she said.\nFluid moves differently around the body in space, too. This can often give the appearance of bad health in the astronauts. Gravity does a lot to the fluids movement in a body, and without it there is a tendency for it to pool. However, they're in good hands.\nA statement given to the daily mail on November 6th reassures concerned parties. \"All NASA astronauts aboard the International Space Station undergo routine medical evaluations.They have dedicated flight surgeons monitoring them and are in good health.\" However, when approached about the current situation, they have declined to comment. The astronauts' health is still protected under HIPPA after all.",

    "text": "VANCOUVER — Data from Environment Canada has confirmed what winter sport enthusiasts have known for a while — December was warm in British Columbia. Five communities in the province set or equalled temperature records for the month while the warm weather, combined with a lack of rain or snow, has done little to ease ongoing drought concerns. Meteorologist Brian Proctor said the mean temperature at Vancouver International Airport last month was 7 C, tying with 1939 as the city's warmest December on record since data started being collected in 1896. The mean temperature was 3.4 degrees higher than what is considered normal for the month. Proctor said Tuesday that warm weather records for December were also either set or tied in Victoria, Comox, Campbell River and Abbotsford. The month was also very dry, meaning there wasn't enough rain or snow to ease drought concerns in the province, he said. In the northeastern municipality of Chetwynd, for example, less than a millimetre of precipitation was recorded in December. The community usually sees about 19 millimetres. \"In general terms, it hasn't been enough to alleviate the long-standing drought,\" Proctor said. \"It's helped to sort of pull it back a little bit, but what we really do need, more than anything else, is we need snowpack. And we're not getting snowpack out of these kinds of systems at this point in time.\" The province's final drought update of the year, posted at the end of November, lists eight of B.C.'s 34 basins at the two highest levels of risk for adverse drought impacts. The northeast corner of B.C., which includes the Fort Nelson and Peace regions, remains at the highest level of drought where adverse impacts are almost certain. Proctor says the first full week of January is expected to get cooler with some snow possible at higher elevations This report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 2, 2024. The Canadian Press Note to readers: This is a corrected story. A previous version said December wasn't warm enough to break records in British Columbia. In fact, Environment Canada now says multiple communities either broke or tied heat records.",
