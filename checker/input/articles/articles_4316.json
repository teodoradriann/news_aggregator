[ANI](/ani-stories)| Updated: 23-06-2024 22:23 IST | Created: 23-06-2024 22:23 IST - Country: - India Indian Army engineers from Trishakti Corps constructed a 150-foot suspension bridge in North Sikkim to re-connect the border villages that got cut off due to continued heavy rains, giving respite to the locals living in those locations, the army said on Sunday. Working under challenging conditions, the army engineers reaffirmed their technical proficiency by launching the foot suspension bridge over waters flowing at speeds over 20 knots in less than 48 hours, said the army in an official release. The bridge will now pave the way to re-establish connectivity to those areas and facilitate move of people and the provision of relief material to the locales inhabiting the area. The Indian Army remains steadfast in its commitment to ensuring the safety and wellbeing of the people living in border areas, the army said.

    "text": "Sport PressBee .. The Sun Watch the post from Week-long freeze hits Britain TODAY with -8C plunge, up to 16 INCHES of snow & health alerts issued for WHOLE of England, Now to the details\nA WEEK-LONG freeze will hit Britain today – bringing an -8C cold plunge and up to 16 inches of snow.\nPublic health bosses have issued amber alerts for the whole of England from now until January 8.\nThe UK Health Security Agency warned a rise in deaths is likely, particularly among the elderly and people with health problems.\nLast night the mercury sank as low as minus 8C in rural Scotland and northern England.\nA yellow warning for snow will be in force from noon tomorrow until 9am on Monday.\nThe warning covers all regions of England, other than the south west, most of Wales and parts of southern Scotland.\nAround 2 inches of snow is expected widely across the Midlands, Wales and northern England.\nA whopping 16 inches could fall over high ground in Wales and the Pennines, the forecaster added.\nStrong winds could lead to snow drifts in some areas, and freezing rain as temperatures creep up could add to the risk of ice.\nMet Office meteorologist Tom Morgan said: “At the moment we’ve issued a very large snow warning for Saturday until Monday.\n“But it doesn’t mean that everywhere within that warning could see snow, it’s just a heads-up there could be some impacts.”\nThe Met Office has warned people to be prepared and aware when travelling with longer journey times likely.\nRailways are likely to experience delays or cancellations, with National Rail confirming that various routes across the UK are impacted.\nPoor weather is currently affecting National Rail’s Northern and ScotRail services.\nIn Wales, buses are replacing trains between Llandudno Junction and Blaenau Ffestiniog.\nThere could be icy surfaces in northern and western Scotland, the north west of England and Northern Ireland.\nMotorists and pedestrians alike are warned to be wary of icy patches on untreated roads, pavements, or cycle paths.\nYesterday London councils activated an emergency accommodation protocol for people sleeping rough in freezing conditions.\nThe emergency measures, which see extra beds made available, have been active for three nights so far this winter.\nA major incident declared in Greater Manchester on Wednesday because of flooding has been stood down.\nEmergency services and partners now focusing on recovery efforts and there have been no casualties or reports of serious injuries.\nICE ICE MAYBE\nConditions should become a little warmer over the weekend before cold snap sets in again early next week.\nMet Office expert Dan Stroud said: “The second half of the weekend should be in the high singles or low doubles.\n“But temperatures will dive again next week, particularly on Monday and Tuesday.\n“They should start to improve towards the latter end of the week – but there’s a lot of water to go under the bridge until then.”\nNHS bosses in the West Midlands have warned locals not to go out early in the morning or late at night, when frost will be thick.\nThey said people should keep hands free and wear shoes with a good grip.\nHerefordshire residents have been urged to stock up on food and medicine and to seal up draughts in their homes.\nOAP STRUGGLE\nAge UK chief Caroline Abrahams said pensioners will struggle in the cold snap after the government slashed the winter fuel allowance.\nMs Abrahams said OAPs had already contacted the charity “worrying about what to do when this moment arrived”.\nShe said said: “We urge older people to do everything they can to stay warm.\n“Even if that means risking spending more on their heating than they feel they can afford.\n“The energy companies are under an obligation to help if you are struggling.”\nAbrahams added: “There may be support available from your local council too.”\nFrom this winter, only people on pension credit or certain other benefits will receive the winter fuel payments.\nMore than nine million others are set to be stripped of the allowance under the new rules.\nThis weekend's Met Office forecast in full\nToday\nIt will remain cold but mostly dry and sunny for many. Snow showers will continue to affect coasts exposed to the northerly wind.\nBut these will be more of a wintry mix of rain, sleet and snow in the west.\nTonight\nShowers in the north and west, these wintry over the hills will move eastwards.\nElsewhere with clear spells, temperatures will drop below freezing with a widespread frost developing for many.\nSaturday\nA cold and frosty for many, however thicker cloud will spread in from the southwest during the afternoon.\nA mixture of rain, sleet and snow pushing northwards overnight.\nSunday to Tuesday\nRain, sleet and snow continuing to spread northeast on Sunday, turning briefly milder in the south.\nColder but drier again on Monday with wintry showers, similar on Tuesday.\nweek long freeze hits britain today with 8c plunge up to 16 inches of snow\nPlease note that the original topic has been published and is available on The Sun the editing team at PressBee have verified it and it may have been partially modified or quoted from it.

    "text": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers fans got some good news on Thursday with the latest injury report. The Bucs put out their second injury report of the week on Thursday before they face off against the Washington Commanders in Week 1. On Wednesday, defensive tackle Logan Hall and kicker Chase McLaughlin did not participate, but one of those players was back to full participation on Thursday — McLaughlin, listed with an abdominal injury and an illness, was full go. The Bucs will be happy about that. The team has had some kicker woes the last few years, and little would be worse than having to get a kicker on the practice squad to play the opening game of the season. That doesn't appear to be the case, though, as a fully-participating McLaughlin likely means he'll kick on Sunday. READ MORE: Todd Bowles Talks on 'Unknown' Commanders Team In worse news, defensive tackle Logan Hall did not participate for the second day in a row with a foot injury and defensive lineman Earnest Brown didn't participate with a ribs injury after being limited Wednesday. The Buccaneers recently signed Ben Stille from the Cardinals' practice squad, and it's likely that someone will have to go to Injured Reserve. As it stands, it's unknown whether or not the Hall will be ready to go on Sunday.

    "title": "Oxford Union has no confidence in the United Nations - Cherwell",
    "text": "On Thursday night, the Oxford Union voted in favour of the motion “This House Has No Confidence in the United Nations.” The final count had 148 members voting for the motion and 90 members voting against. Craig Mokhiber, the former UN official whose resignation over the UN’s stance on the Israel-Gaza War garnered international attention late last October, and Sir Geoffrey Nice, the lead prosecutor at the trial of Slobodan Milošević and current chair of the China and Uyghur Tribunals, spoke for the motion. Joining Mokhiber and Nice were first-year History student Ben Murphy and first-year Chemistry student James MacKenzie. Opposing the motion were Angela Kane, former UN High Representative for Disarmament Affairs and UN Undersecretary for Management; The Lord Hannay of Chiswick, a British diplomat who previously held the position of Permanent Representative to the EU and to the UN; and UK Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN James Kariuki. Masters student Shaezmina Khan also opposed the motion. Ben Murphy opened the case for opposition by stating that, although the UN was founded with a “clear promise of peace and justice,” it has since become a “utopian fantasy that cannot be achieved.” He argued the very idea of a unified group of nations was illusory since countries have different and often competing interests. Murphy then asked the audience to consider the UN from the perspective of a Cambodian living under the Khmer Rouge, a group he said was legitimised by the UN. He argued that the UN is not an enforcer of peace but an enabler of strife, as shown by such autocratic regimes it legitimises and by the belligerence of its “big five” members: France, Russia, China, the United Kingdom, and the United States. “The founding countries, those central to its development, the big five, have had their part in more conflict than the rest of the world together.” Opening the case for the opposition, Shaezmina Khan focused on the semantics of the motion, arguing that “to vote for opposition, you only need to believe you have some confidence in the UN.” She cited past UN contributions – such as UNICEF’s vaccination programmes and the UN’s Non-Proliferation Treaty – and averred that the UN has served the world better than most people realise. She closed her speech with a quote from John F. Kennedy: “I see little merit in the impatience of those who would abandon this imperfect world instrument because they dislike our imperfect world. For the troubles of a world organisation merely reflect the troubles of the world itself.” The second speaker for the proposition, Sir Geoffrey Nice, argued that the core purpose of the United Nations was to put an end to war and ensure “disputes between nations should be resolved by peaceful means” – a purpose which he believes has been abandoned. Central to Nice’s argument was the failure of the United Nations to prevent the crime of genocide. He stated that the Genocide Convention requires participating states in Article I to “act to prevent genocide, wherever whenever it happens, anywhere on the globe.” He paused before asking the audience: “In 70 years, how many times has any government done that?” According to Nice, “excluding the cases of Zambia with Myanmar and South Africa with Israel,” the answer was “none.” He cited the case of Rwanda, where the British deliberately avoided the term “genocide,” and the case of Bosnia, where he said the United Nations was “conveniently absent,” before stating forcefully: “This sort of thing has to stop.” Responding to the first proposition speaker’s clarification of terms, he told the audience: “Disregard the semantics, we know what the motion really means… Do you have confidence that you, your children, and grandchildren won’t be at war?” James Kariuki continued the case for the opposition. He acknowledged some of the shortcomings of the UN but asked the audience “when the critics blame the UN for the world’s ills, who exactly do they blame?” He argued it was misguided to believe that the representatives from different member states were capable of solving all the problems around the globe. According to Kariuki, “The complaints about the UN reflect dissatisfaction with the world as it is.” Kariuki touched on the UN’s role in eradicating polio through mass inoculation, combating climate change through environmental regulation, and promoting human rights through the Universal Declaration of Human Rights – which he described as a “monumental achievement.” Toward the end of his speech, he stated that the 80 years before the establishment of the UN were worse than the 80 years since. Continuing the case for the proposition, James MacKenzie cited the failure of the UN to respond to humanitarian crises and to fulfil its charter on social development. He argued that the policy of veto in the Security Council “undermines the very principles UN claims to uphold: Equality, justice, and the right to self-determination.” The UN, MacKenzie stated, has devolved into a geo-political chessboard, demonstrated by the lack of response “to the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Yemen and the ethnic cleansing in Myanmar.” He asked the audience how many more cases we would require in order to see “the UN is failing in its fundamental duty.” Angela Kane, the third opposition speaker, drew on her own experience working at the UN. She touched on the success of the UN in tackling climate change and helping hundreds of millions of people throughout the world receive aid. She cited an opinion poll conducted in 24 countries which revealed that, on average, 63% of people see the United Nations in a positive light. Kane emphasised the importance of international treaties, which allow us to hold states to account, stating: “The UN works for the world, it works for the people.” Closing the case for the proposition, Craig Mokhiber began by stating: “I think it should be clear by now that the House should have no confidence in the UN.” He clarified that this was not meant as a critique of the idea of the UN, nor was it meant as a critique of the people who have dedicated their lives to the mission of the UN. Rather, it was a critique of bodies like the Security Council which, Mokhiber argued, had abandoned the mission of the UN. He discussed the UN Charter and told the audience that, 75 years later, we are still waiting for its fulfilment. Mocking a remark made by the opposition that “The UN is not made to deliver us to heaven, but merely to save us from hell,” he encouraged the audience to ask people in Bosnia, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Gaza, and Syria whether the United Nations has protected them from war crimes and crimes against humanity: “Should the abandoned people of the United Nations have confidence in the United Nations?” Lord Hannay of Chiswick closed the case for the opposition. He began by stating that almost everything had been said already and the debate, and his job would instead be to recapitulate some central reasons for opposing the motion. According to Hannay, nobody on the opposition side was suggesting that the UN had accomplished all of its objectives. Rather, because of the soundness of the principles enumerated in the UN Charter and the UN Declaration of Human Rights, the opposition was emphasising the importance of working to fulfil the mission of the UN. To those who would abandon the UN, Hannay prophesied: “If we walk away from it, we will rue the day.” He conceded that some member states were not acting perfectly but argued that the UN was needed to preserve norm-based international order. He concluded by stressing the importance of the UN and was met with a great deal of applause in the chamber.",
