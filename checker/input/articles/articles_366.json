    "text": "GARY — Students at Williams Elementary School are learning more about science with help from Indiana University Northwest's Chemistry Club.\nAs part of the school's STEM, which is short for science, technology, engineering and math, club, students meet once a month and spend half their time with the chemistry club and the other half learning about robotics from local electricians.\nThe STEM club was formed in August by Tomeka Pope, the school's STEM instructor. Pope said she had originally organized a STEM day last year for her classes, something that became popular with the students.\nAt the same time, members of the chemistry club were invited to do chemistry demonstrations during Williams' back-to-school event. Pope reached out to the group and asked if they would be willing to partner with the school for the STEM club.\nDuring their meeting on Tuesday, IUN chemistry and physics lecturer Linda Wozniewski gave the students a lesson on polymers — compound materials made up of similar smaller units bonded together. After the lesson, students took part in different activities, such as determining the density of plastic beads by placing them in different liquids, placing fibers of different materials above a candle flame to determine whether they're natural or synthetic and looking at dog hairs through a microscopes\n\"You get to do cool sciences things and you get to do cool experiments,\" said Williams student Prince Smith.\nWozniewski, who developed the club's curriculum, said the lessons have also covered metals, food science, fingerprints and liquids. It'll all cumulate with the students solving a fictional crime next month.\nIUN student Hamza Nasar, who is president of the chemistry club, said it has been an enriching process to work with the students.\n\"They're really inquisitive and curious to see what's going on and how things work,\" Nasar said.\nPope said she's loved having the IUN students volunteer in the STEM club, and that it has motivated students to be involved in science and explore different careers.\nWynter Windfield, another Williams student, said learning how to make a cupcake during the food science lesson has made her more interested in science.\nWozniewski said she hopes to inspire the same level of fascination and interest in STEM that began in her when she was an elementary school student.\n\"Hopefully they will get that same passion for understanding why the world works the way it does and understanding how everything works together,\" Wozniewski said.",

    "text": "THE Police Regional Office (PRO) - Western Visayas conducted a series of successful anti-drug operations in 24 hours, resulting in the apprehension of 10 individuals and the seizure of approximately 150 grams of suspected shabu with a street value of P1 million. These operations, which began at 6 a.m. on June 10, 2024, and concluded at 5:59 a.m. on June 11, 2024, targeted both high-value individual (HVI) and street-level individual (SLI) offenders. Two individuals were classified as HVI, while the remaining eight were involved in SLI activities. The Negros Occidental Police Provincial Office (Nocppo) played a significant role in the operations, conducting three successful busts and confiscating around P600,000 worth of shabu. The Iloilo Police Provincial Office (Ippo) followed closely with two operations, resulting in the seizure of approximately P400,000 worth of illegal drugs. The Bacolod City Police Office (BCPO) also contributed to the success, conducting one operation and recovering P15,000 worth of shabu. Police Brigadier General Jack Wanky, regional director of the PRO in Western Visayas, lauded the operatives for their dedication and tireless efforts in the fight against illegal drugs. \"Congratulations on these remarkable accomplishments. Your efforts truly speak of your dedication and perseverance towards your duty,\" Wanky said. He further emphasized the importance of continued focus and collaboration. “I encourage you to maintain your focus and momentum in our campaign. Strengthen your collaboration and coordination with the different stakeholders to gather more information that might lead to the arrest of those who opt to engage in the illegal trade,\" Wanky added.

    "text": "No. 9 Missouri's surprising season ended with a 14-3 win over a declawed No. 7 Ohio State in the Cotton Bowl Classic on Friday, setting up the program for its first top 10 finish since 2013. To say the game was a slog would be generous. Only one drive in the first half ended in something other than a punt, when Ohio State turned some generous field position into a 44-yard field goal. The two teams combined for 183 yards total, averaging 2.8 yards per play. Ohio State entered the game shorthanded on offense, missing starting quarterback Kyle McCord and Heisman Trophy finalist Marvin Harrison Jr., then lost back-up quarterback Devin Brown to an injury in the first quarter. Third-stringer Lincoln Kienholz, who had attempted five passes total this season entering bowl season, took over. It was almost jarring when Missouri broke the ice at the end of the third quarter. Quarterback Brady Cook hit a wide-open Marquis Johnson on play action for 50 yards to go from deep in the Tigers' territory to the red zone. Before that, Missouri's longest play had been for 17 yards, It was only the second time the Ohio State defense allowed a play of 40+ yards all season and set up what wound up being the decisive score. The Buckeyes responded with one of their best drives of the game, but a Kienholz fumble ended it at the Mizzou 35. The Tigers responded with a 13-play, 91-yard drive to put the game away.",

Sign up He instead offered a montage of photos and clips from some of the unnamed restaurants, including a few he felt he was “obviously not the target audience for.” The montage revealed a few of the negatives Lee and his team discussed while dining, including unprofessional customer service and poor food preparation.\nNonetheless, the DMV did not disappoint entirely. Okonomi Asian Grille in Fairfax, Virginia rated a 8.5/10; Hong Kong Carryout in Southeast, D.C. received a 8.6; and Dukem, a classic Ethiopian restaurant on U Street was crowned “the best food we’ve had in D.C.” in his Aug. 24 review.\nAt Hong Kong Carryout on Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue in Southeast, D.C., Lee paid for neighbors to eat free.\nHe offered Okonomi $2,000 to pay for free food for customers, in addition to $1,000 to help the restaurant recover from recent fake DoorDash scams.\nDukem Ethiopian restaurant on U Street NW, Lee crowned “the best food we’ve had in D.C,” noting its “robust sauce” and “earthy taste” in food. Lee gifted $1000 worth of food for following customers, plus $500 in individual tips to the restaurant owners.\nThe former MMA fighter remained committed to giving back to the DMV’s restaurant community. In a culmination of food orders, generous tips and community donations, Lee and his team were able to “sow $30,000 to various restaurants around the DMV,” according to the Aug. 26 TikTok post.\nIn his now viral video, he also criticized media outlets for minimizing the positive impact of his DMV tour.\n “A lot of media outlets picked up on the fact that I said restaurants out here, in my opinion, tend to lean towards promoting alcohol more than promoting food. That’s the headlines more than us being in the actual city and being blessed enough to touch the people that we’ve touched,” he said.\nAs social media reacted to Lee’s transparent take on Washington’s food scene, some agreed with his thoughts, while others questioned his recommendation sources as a whole.\nOne user on X (formerly known as Twitter) voiced that Lee’s experience would be different if he, himself, was not so restricted.\n“Two things can [be] true,” read the tweet . “Yes, the D.C. food scene isn’t all that it’s cracked out to be. However, Keith Lee’s palate is a bit limited and how he chooses to eat the food, takeout in the car, makes it challenging to fully experience some restaurants.”\nAs the Detroit, Michigan native made his way to Baltimore, according to Axios , there’s speculation of a positive review for the Jamaican food chain Jerk at Nite, which has several locations in the nation’s capital. Based on an Instagram post from the local food chain, Lee visited and offered “a kind-hearted donation” earlier last week that prompted the eatery to give out 200 free meals at the Langdon location on Aug. 27.\n“[Ten] years ago, we were selling food out of our dorm [at Howard University] and now we’re here,” read the caption. “[Lee] heard about us being a Howard University and D.C. community staple so we made sure he tasted our perseverance and passion on every plate. We hope we made D.C. proud!”\nTagged: DMV (District, Maryland, Virginia) , Dukem , Hong Kong Carryout , Jada Ingleton , Jerk at Nite , Keith Lee , Okonomi Asian Grille , TikTok Jada Ingleton wijingleton@gmail.com\nJada Ingleton is a Comcast Digital Equity Local Voices Lab contributing fellow through the Washington Informer.

The former G League Ignite guard vowed to prove it once the 2023-24 season started.\nHenderson had an up-and-down first six games of his career before spraining his ankle against the Detroit Pistons on Nov. 1. He missed roughly three weeks as he recovered from the said injury. The Blazers eased him back once he returned and has slowly but steadily found his groove.\nWhen asked about what he wants to accomplish this season, the point guard responded that winning the Rookie of the Year award remains his goal. He added that the ROY is still “up in the air.”\n•\n70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) Unlock Free tips from our Experts Get Picks Now Fans on Twitter/X promptly reacted:\n“He better go bet on himself at +25000” Expand Tweet Expand Tweet Expand Tweet Expand Tweet Expand Tweet Expand Tweet Expand Tweet Expand Tweet Expand Tweet Expand Tweet Expand Tweet The Dec. 27 odds had Chet Holmgren as the betting favorite to win the Rookie of the Year award at -180. Victor Wembanyama came in second at +140. Miami Heat forward Jaime Jaquez Jr. has surged to contention and is now third with a +3000 odds. Scoot Henderson is a long shot at +25000.\nIt’s still late in December and anything can still happen. Wembanyama has already missed a couple of games due to a sprained ankle. Injuries can happen to anyone among the early favorites. Henderson can still close the gap and may have a chance down the road.\nWith the way things are going, the ROY seems to be a two-way horse race between Chet Holmgren and Victor Wembanyama. The OKC Thunder is likely entering the playoffs so Holmgren might have a decisive edge over Wembanyama’s Spurs who currently have the second-worst record in the NBA.\nScoot Henderson’s chance of winning the Wilt Chamberlain Trophy may be out of his reach if nothing unexpected happens to the aforementioned leaders.",

    "title": "联大停火决议吸引全球目光！美以强硬反对，法国或承认巴勒斯坦|美国_新浪财经_新浪网",
    "text": "下载新浪财经APP，了解全球实时汇率\n　　 汇通财经APP讯—— 据路孚特，联合国大会即将在周四（6月12日）对一项要求加沙战争立即、无条件且永久停火的决议草案进行表决，这一事件迅速成为全球关注的焦点。然而，美国 和以色列对此强烈反对，试图通过外交施压阻止决议通过。与此同时，法国和沙特阿拉伯即将主办的巴以“两国方案”会议进一步加剧了紧张局势。美方甚至发出警告，威胁对支持反以色列行动的国家施加外交后果。这一连串事件不仅凸显了巴以冲突的复杂性，也为国际关系和地缘政治带来了新的不确定性。\n　　联大决议草案：停火与人道主义的呼声\n　　决议的核心内容\n　　联合国大会的决议草案旨在为持续升级的加沙冲突寻求解决方案。草案明确要求哈马斯释放人质，同时要求以色列释放被扣押的巴勒斯坦囚犯，并从加沙地带全面撤军。此外，草案强调必须保障人道主义援助的畅通无阻，强烈谴责将平民饥饿作为战争手段，以及任何非法阻挠人道主义救助进入的行为，特别是剥夺平民生存必需物资的做法。这些条款反映了国际社会对加沙人道主义危机的深切关注。\n　　决议的政治意义\n　　尽管联合国大会的决议不具备法律约束力，但其作为全球对巴以冲突态度的重要风向标，具有不可忽视的象征意义。联大由193个成员国组成，且没有任何国家拥有否决权，这与安理会的机制形成鲜明对比。此前，联大多次通过类似呼吁停火的决议，但均被冲突双方无视。此次表决的结果将进一步反映国际社会在巴以问题上的立场分化。\n　　美以的强硬反对：外交施压与否决权\n　　美国的否决与警告\n　　美国在联合国安理会中已于上周否决了一项内容相似的停火提案，理由是该提案可能破坏美国主导的停火谈判努力。美国驻以色列大使赫卡毕甚至公开表示，建立独立的巴勒斯坦国已不再是美国的外交政策目标，这一表态标志着美国对“两国方案”立场的重大转变。此外，美国还针对即将召开的巴以问题会议发出外交照会，警告任何在会议后采取“反以色列行动”的国家将被视为违背美国外交政策利益，可能面临外交后果。\n　　以色列的游说与反击\n　　以色列常驻联合国代表丹尼·达农（Danny Danon）在给各成员国的信件中激烈批评联大决议草案，称其指控“不实且具有诽谤性”。他认为草案存在严重缺陷，未能谴责哈马斯的行为，并可能破坏正在进行的人质谈判。以色列还积极游说各国抵制联大决议，称其为“政治动机”下的“闹剧”。\n　　法国与沙特的联合行动：巴以“两国方案”再启\n　　会议的背景与目标\n　　法国和沙特阿拉伯将于6月17日至20日在纽约共同主办一场联合国会议，旨在为巴以“两国方案”制定具体路线图。这场会议不仅寻求为建立巴勒斯坦国铺平道路，同时也强调确保以色列的安全。法国总统马克龙表示，法国可能在会议期间正式承认巴勒斯坦国，这一表态引发了国际社会的广泛关注。\n　　美法矛盾的显现\n　　作为美国的传统盟友，法国在巴以问题上的立场与美国出现明显分歧。美国的外交照会明确反对单方面承认巴勒斯坦国的举措，认为这将为冲突的最终解决增添法律和政治障碍。法国则表示，其正努力避免与美国发生直接冲突，但仍坚持推动会议的召开。一位匿名欧洲外交官批评美国的施压行为为“霸凌”，并表示多数国家不会因此放弃参与会议。\n　　国际社会的反应与分歧\n　　支持停火的广泛共识\n　　外交官们预计，联大决议草案可能以压倒性多数通过，反映出国际社会对加沙人道主义危机的普遍关切。尽管决议不具约束力，但其通过将进一步凸显美国和以色列在国际舞台上的孤立。许多国家认为，停火和人道主义援助是解决当前危机的当务之急。\n　　美国的孤立与压力\n　　美国在安理会否决停火提案，以及对即将召开的会议施加外交压力的行为，引发了部分国家的反感。一些国家认为，美国的立场过于偏向以色列，忽视了巴勒斯坦平民的苦难。这种分歧可能进一步削弱美国在中东问题上的影响力。\n　　对黄金市场的影响分析\n　　加沙冲突及其引发的国际博弈对全球金融市场，尤其是黄金市场，可能产生显著影响。首先，地缘政治紧张局势的加剧通常会推高避险资产的需求，黄金作为传统避险资产可能因此受益。如果联大决议通过并引发美以与其他国家的进一步对立，市场的不确定性将增加，投资者可能转向黄金以规避风险。其次，若法国正式承认巴勒斯坦国，可能导致中东局势进一步复杂化，进而推高金价。然而，若美国主导的停火谈判取得进展，市场对地缘政治风险的担忧可能缓解，短期内金价可能面临回调压力。总体来看，当前局势的不确定性为金价提供了上行支撑，但具体走势仍需视后续外交进展而定。\n　　结语：全球目光聚焦联合国\n　　联合国大会即将表决的加沙停火决议草案，以及法国和沙特主办的巴以“两国方案”会议，将巴以冲突推向了新的国际焦点。美国和以色列的强硬反对与国际社会的广泛支持形成鲜明对比，凸显了地缘政治的复杂性。这一事件不仅关乎加沙的人道主义危机，也可能对全球金融市场产生深远影响。未来几天，国际社会的每一个决定都可能成为改变局势的关键，而黄金市场也将随之波动。\n　　 北京时间13：54， 现货黄金 现报3374.83美元 /盎司。",

Se espera una respuesta oficial por parte del gobierno israelí. No hubo detalles inmediatos sobre lo que implicaba el acuerdo. Hamás emitió un comunicado este lunes según el cual aceptó una propuesta de alto el fuego con Israel presentada por Egipto y Qatar. La facción islamista indicó en un comunicado que su jefe, Ismail Haniyeh, había informado al primer ministro de Qatar y al jefe de inteligencia de Egipto de que había aceptado su propuesta. No hubo detalles inmediatos sobre lo que implicaba el acuerdo. Un funcionario israelí afirmó a su turno que esa tregua era una versión \"suavizada\" de una propuesta egipcia que incluía conclusiones \"de gran alcance\" que Israel no puede aceptar. \"Esto parece ser una artimaña destinada a hacer que Israel parezca el lado que se niega a un acuerdo\", declaró el funcionario israelí, que habló bajo condición de anonimato con la agencia de noticias Reuters. Mientras tanto en Francia, el presidente de China, Xi Jinping afirmó que su país \"instó a impulsar un cese al fuego inmediato en la Franja de Gaza que sea integral y sostenible y apoya la membresía de pleno derecho de Palestina en la Organización de las Naciones Unidas\". Xi formuló estas declaraciones en una conferencia de prensa conjunta con su homólogo francés, Emmanuel Macron.

    "text": "Hitze-Gefahr: Diese Getränke verstärken Durst, statt ihn zu löschen\nZwei scheinbar erfrischende Drinks können bei Hitze gefährlich werden. Experten warnen vor versteckten Risiken für Ihre Gesundheit.\nDer Sommer zeigt sich von seiner heißesten Seite. Bei Temperaturen über 30 Grad ist ausreichend trinken überlebenswichtig. Doch nicht alle Getränke sind bei Hitze geeignet. Zwei beliebte Drinks können sogar gefährlich werden. Experten warnen vor den Folgen falscher Getränkewahl an heißen Tagen.\nWarum diese Getränke bei Hitze schaden\nPure Fruchtsäfte und süße Limonaden stehen ganz oben auf der Liste der problematischen Hitze-Getränke. Der hohe Zuckergehalt verstärkt paradoxerweise den Durst. Statt zu löschen, verstärken diese Drinks das Durstgefühl. Bei Fruchtsäften entsteht durch Fruktose das schädliche Fruktose-1-Phosphat. Dieses fördert Entzündungen und treibt die Harnsäurebildung an.\nGesundheitsrisiken durch falsche Getränke im Sommer\nStudien der Universität Yonsei belegen: Regelmäßiger Softdrink-Konsum erhöht das Risiko für chronische Nierenerkrankungen. Bei Hitze steigt dieses Risiko zusätzlich. Der Körper verliert täglich 1,5 Liter Wasser durch Atmung und Schweiß. An heißen Tagen können weitere zwei Liter dazukommen. Falsches Trinken belastet das Herz-Kreislaufsystem zusätzlich.\nDie besten Alternativen für heiße Tage\n- Leitungswasser und Mineralwasser\n- Ungesüßte Kräuter- und Früchtetees\n- Saftschorlen (1 Teil Saft, 3 Teile Wasser)\n- Wasserreiches Obst wie Melonen oder Gurken\nWichtig: Getränke sollten lauwarm oder leicht gekühlt sein. Eiskalte Drinks signalisieren dem Körper Kälte. Die Folge: verstärktes Schwitzen durch hochgefahrene Wärmeregulierung.\nFazit: Richtig trinken ist das A und O\nAn heißen Sommertagen benötigt der Körper zwei bis drei Liter Flüssigkeit. Die Getränkewahl entscheidet über Wohlbefinden und Gesundheit. Verzichten Sie auf zuckerreiche Drinks und setzen Sie auf Wasser und ungesüßte Tees. Ihr Körper wird es Ihnen danken.

    "text": "Issued Friday 10 May 2024 The Bureau of Meteorology's Australian Space Weather Forecasting Centre has forecast a geomagnetic storm event of level G4 (severe) on the global G-scale. The Bureau issued a G4 geomagnetic magnetic storm warning at 10.15am 10 May 2024. The warning issued for this event informs government and critical infrastructure operators so they can take action to mitigate potential impacts on infrastructure assets and essential services. These geomagnetic storm conditions are expected to arrive at Earth on 10 May 2024, starting at 8.00 pm AEST +/- 10 hours. G4 geomagnetic conditions are expected on 10 May 2024, reducing to G3 with a chance of G4 on 11 May 2024. The Bureau predicts that these geomagnetic conditions are likely to continue until 06.00 AEST 12 May 2024. The G-scale is a measure of global geomagnetic activity, which refers to fluctuations in Earth's magnetic field across the globe. The G-scale ranges from G1 (minor) to G5 (extreme). The intensity of geomagnetic storms in Australia is usually lower than the planetary average. This event is a result of four coronal mass ejections observed at 3.36pm AEST and 10.24 pm AEST on Wednesday 8 May 2024, and at 8.24am AEST and 7.36pm AEST Thursday 9 May 2024. Geomagnetic storms of G4 level can potentially disrupt: - critical infrastructure such as power grids, causing power outages - satellite services, affecting communications and global position, navigation and timing services that use high-frequency radio communication The Bureau continues to monitor the situation and will provide updates of significant changes. If G4 geomagnetic conditions occur, bright auroras will be visible at unusually low latitudes, including dark-sky locations near Sydney and Perth. The Bureau of Meteorology's Australian Space Weather Forecasting Centre (ASWFC) is the official source of space weather forecasts, alerts and warnings in Australia.
