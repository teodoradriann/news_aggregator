    "title": "Harris says Trump 'wants to be an autocrat' in acceptance speech",
    "text": "Vice President Kamala Harris said Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump \"wants to be an autocrat,\" as she accepted the Democratic presidential nomination in Chicago on Thursday night. \"I will not cozy up to tyrants and dictators like Kim Jong-Un, who are rooting for Trump,\" said Harris. \"Because they know he is easy to manipulate with flattery and favors,\" the vice president said. \"They know Trump won't hold autocrats accountable — because he wants to be an autocrat,\" Harris said of her Republican opponent. \"As President, I will never waver in defense of America's security and ideals.\" Shortly after Harris delivered these lines, Trump replied to her critique in a social media post. \"The Tyrants are laughing at her, she's weak and ineffective, and for three and a half years she has done nothing except enabled them to get STRONG, RICH, and POWERFUL!\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. Harris' sharp criticism of Trump's well documented admiration for dictators and autocrats hostile to U.S. interests built on a theme established earlier in the night. The convention's speaker list on Thursday included a half-dozen veterans of the American military and intelligence community. One by one, they portrayed Trump as a threat to national security, and Harris as a staunch defender of America's ideals. \"I want to talk tonight about national security,\" said Rep. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, the Democratic nominee for a Senate seat from that state this fall. \"Because the choice in November is stark: America retreating from the world, or leading the world. Trump wants to take us backwards,\" said Slotkin, a former Central Intelligence Agency analyst who worked alongside the military during three tours in Iraq. \"He admires dictators, treats our friends as adversaries, and our adversaries as friends.\" \"Don't give an inch to pretenders who wrap themselves in the flag, but spit in the face of the freedoms it represents,\" she said to wide applause. Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., a former U.S. Navy fighter pilot and astronaut, said, \"As president, Trump skipped his intelligence briefings.\" \"He was too busy sucking up to dictators and dreaming of becoming one himself,\" Kelly said. \"Trump thinks Americans who have made the ultimate sacrifice are 'suckers' and 'losers.' If we fall for it again, and make him commander-in-chief, the only suckers would be us.\" Kelly also said that the threats the United States faces are too serious to risk another term in the White House for Trump, who \"the world laughs at.\" Leon Panetta, a former secretary of defense and director of the CIA, also issued a warning. \"Trump would abandon our allies and isolate America,\" he said. \"We tried that in the 1930s. It was foolish and dangerous then. It is foolish and dangerous now.\" He also quoted Republican former President Ronald Reagan, who said, \"Isolationism never was and never will be an acceptable response to tyrannical governments.\" Unlike Reagan, \"Trump tells tyrants like Putin they can do 'whatever the hell they want.'\" \"Donald Trump does not understand the world. And he does not understand the service and sacrifice of our military,\" said Panetta. \"Our fallen veterans aren't suckers. They are not losers. They are heroes.\"",

    "text": "Heavy thunderstorms swept across Switzerland on Wednesday and caused local flooding. Water entered houses in the St. Gallen area. In addition to the city of St. Gallen, several surrounding communities were affected by the heavy thunderstorm, especially in the Degersheim, Gossau, Wittenbach, Mörschwil and Rorschach areas.\nSeveral communities in the Chur Rhine Valley were without electricity. In Uetendorf, Canton of Bern, the attic of a two-family house burned down after being struck by lightning. No one was injured.\nThere was heavy rain, gusts of wind and, according to Meteoschweiz, some hailstones as big as five-franc coins. By early evening, around 48,000 lightning strikes had been counted over Switzerland, as SRF Meteo reported.\nFlooding in the Sitter\nThere was a lot of rain in the St. Gallen area. 50 millimeters were measured there in one hour, 22 of which fell within ten minutes. In Thurgau, the police warned of flooding in the Sitter and called on people to leave the danger area via the Alertswiss warning app.\nBut it also rained heavily in central Switzerland. In Oberiberg SZ, 40 millimetres were measured in one hour, with a total of around 60 millimetres. In places, there were heavy gusts of wind. In Einsiedeln SZ, the wind blew at 110 kilometres per hour.\n90 emergency calls in St. Gallen\nThere were no reports of major damage at the moment. There were reports of trees being knocked over and streets and squares being temporarily flooded. In St. Gallen, the police received over 90 emergency calls that evening.\nIn Rorschach SG, Federal Councillor Elisabeth Baume-Schneider was unable to give her planned speech on August 1st. Due to an approaching thunderstorm, the festival tent was evacuated as a precaution. Dozens of people were asked to leave the premises, as a correspondent from the Keystone-SDA news agency reported on site.",

    "text": "Por Asuka Koda, CNN\nLas comidas instantáneas de fettuccine Alfredo con pollo vendidas en Walmart y Kroger fueron retiradas del mercado tras un brote de listeria que causó 17 casos de esta enfermedad, incluyendo tres muertes y una pérdida fetal.\nEl Servicio de Inspección y Seguridad Alimentaria del Departamento de Agricultura (FSIS, por sus siglas en inglés) de EE.UU. está investigando el brote, que ha afectado a personas en 13 estados. La cepa del brote se identificó en personas enfermas desde agosto de 2024 hasta mayo de 2025, y el FSIS indicó que la misma cepa fue aislada durante pruebas de rutina en un establecimiento de FreshRealm en marzo. El FSIS aún investiga si un ingrediente específico del fettuccine Alfredo con pollo es la fuente del brote.\nFreshRealm informó que los productos se vendieron a nivel nacional en Walmart bajo la marca Marketside y en Kroger bajo la marca Home Chef.\nLos productos afectados son:\nBandejas de 32.8 onzas (unos 930 gramos) con “Marketside Grilled Chicken Alfredo with Fettuccine Tender Pasta with Creamy Alfredo Sauce, White Meat Chicken and Shaved Parmesan Cheese” con fecha de caducidad del 27 de junio o anterior. Bandejas de 12.3 onzas (unos 344 gramos) con “Marketside Grilled Chicken Alfredo with Fettuccine Tender Pasta with Creamy Alfredo Sauce, White Meat Chicken, Broccoli and Shaved Parmesan Cheese” con fecha de caducidad del 26 de junio o anterior. Bandejas de 12.5 onzas (unos 354 gramos) con “Home Chef Heat & Eat Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo with pasta, grilled white meat chicken, and Parmesan cheese” con fecha de caducidad del 19 de junio o anterior. Provinieron de FreshRealm, con sede en Texas, y tienen los números de establecimiento Est. P-50784, Est. P-47770 o Est. P-47718 dentro de la marca de inspección del Departamento de Agricultura de Estados Unidos (USDA, por sus siglas en inglés). El fabricante afirma que el retiro voluntario no aplica a otros productos de FreshRealm.\nEl FSIS dice que le preocupa que los productos retirados puedan estar en los refrigeradores o congeladores de los consumidores. No deben ser consumidos y los clientes deben tirar los productos o devolverlos al lugar de compra.\nEl consumo de alimentos contaminados con Listeria monocytogenes puede causar listeriosis, una infección grave que puede provocar fiebre, dolores musculares, dolor de cabeza, rigidez en el cuello, confusión, pérdida de equilibrio y convulsiones. Estos síntomas a veces pueden estar precedidos por diarrea u otros síntomas gastrointestinales. En mujeres embarazadas, la infección puede causar abortos espontáneos, muerte fetal, parto prematuro o infecciones potencialmente mortales en el recién nacido. También puede causar infecciones graves y, a veces, mortales en adultos mayores y personas con sistemas inmunológicos debilitados. La listeriosis se trata con antibióticos.\nEl FSIS insta a las personas en categorías de mayor riesgo que experimenten síntomas similares a los de la gripe dentro de los dos meses posteriores a haber consumido alimentos contaminados con listeria a buscar atención médica y notificar a su proveedor de salud.\nEl FSIS también enfatiza que las comidas preparadas solo deben consumirse cuando se cocinan a una temperatura de 165 grados Fahrenheit (unos 74 grados Celsius). La única manera de confirmar que las comidas preparadas han alcanzado una temperatura lo suficientemente alta como para eliminar bacterias dañinas, incluida la listeria, es usar un termómetro de alimentos que mida la temperatura interna.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.
