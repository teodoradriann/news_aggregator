    "text": "生产供给较快增长，新质生产力加快培育，国内需求不断扩大，就业形势总体稳定……国家统计局4月16日发布数据显示：今年一季度，随着各项宏观政策继续发力显效，国民经济起步平稳、开局良好，高质量发展向新向好，彰显了中国经济强大的韧性和潜力。\n　　良好开局怎么看？16日召开的国务院新闻办新闻发布会上，国家统计局副局长盛来运结合数据介绍了有关情况。\n　　 从“5.4%”看发展韧性\n　　【亮点】一季度，国内生产总值同比增长5.4%，在全球主要经济体中名列前茅。\n　　初步核算，一季度国内生产总值318758亿元，按不变价格计算，同比增长5.4%，比上年四季度环比增长1.2%。\n　　这一成绩有含金量。\n　　“5.4%的增速高于去年全年5%的增速，也高于去年一季度5.3%的增速，在全球主要经济体中名列前茅，延续了稳中向好、稳中回升的态势。”盛来运说。\n　　含金量，体现在生产需求等主要指标的稳中有升，也体现在就业收入总体稳定、国际收支状况良好方面。\n　　看就业收入。一季度，全国城镇调查失业率平均值为5.3%，3月份为5.2%，比上月回落0.2个百分点。全国居民人均可支配收入扣除物价因素，实际增长5.6%，与国内生产总值增长基本同步。\n　　看国际收支。今年以来，全球经济增长动能偏弱，但我国进出口保持基本平稳态势：一季度，货物贸易进出口同比增长1.3%，出口增长6.9%；1至2月份，服务进出口额增长9.9%；3月末，外汇储备余额保持在3.2万亿美元以上。\n　　这一成绩来之不易。\n　　“今年以来，国际环境变乱交织，不利影响加深，国内结构调整阵痛仍在释放，不少企业经营比较困难。面对复杂局面，各地区各部门加快落实更加积极有为的宏观政策，有力有效应对外部挑战。”盛来运认为，前期出台的宏观政策和今年以来扩容加码的增量政策叠加发力，有效扩大了需求、促进了生产、激发了活力、增强了信心，推动经济实现良好开局。\n　　这一成绩，进一步增强了前行信心。\n　　美国大搞关税壁垒和贸易霸凌，对世界经济秩序造成严重冲击。“从短期来看，美国加征高额关税会对我国经济和外贸带来一定压力，但是改变不了中国经济持续长期向好的大势。”盛来运表示，中国经济基础稳、优势多、韧性强、潜力大，有底气、有信心、有能力应对外部挑战，实现既定发展目标。\n　　 从“4.6%”看消费潜力\n　　【亮点】一季度，社会消费品零售总额增长4.6%，比上年全年加快1.1个百分点。\n　　一季度，社会消费品零售总额124671亿元，同比增长4.6%，比上年全年加快1.1个百分点，而且增速逐月回升。3月份，社会消费品零售总额增长5.9%，比1至2月份加快1.9个百分点。\n　　“扩大内需、提振消费等方面政策持续发挥作用，效果比较明显。”盛来运说。\n　　商品零售增长较快。一季度，“两新”政策带动相关消费品保持两位数增长，反映出市场销售状况不断好转。电动自行车、手机、平板、智能手表等新扩围的产品销售增速很高。一季度，限额以上单位通讯器材类商品零售额同比增长26.9%，文化办公用品类增长21.7%，家用电器和音像器材类增长19.3%，家具类增长18.1%，仅这4项就拉动社会消费品零售总额增长1.4个百分点。\n　　服务消费方兴未艾。一季度，服务零售额同比增长5%，比商品零售高0.4个百分点。与消费结构升级相关的消费保持两位数增长。一季度，居民人均交通通信支出同比增长10.4%， 教育 文化娱乐支出增长13.9%；居民人均服务性消费支出同比增长5.4%，占全部居民人均消费支出的比重达到43.4%，比去年同期提高0.1个百分点。“服务消费是未来支撑消费增长的一个重要领域，发展空间非常大。”盛来运说。\n　　消费新动能持续释放。随着 大数据 、 人工智能 加速运用，直播带货、即时零售、“夜经济”、数字消费、 人工智能 游戏 等消费场景不断创新拓展，一些文化类消费也较快增长。\n　　“消费是收入的函数，要大力提振消费，也要大力促进消费能力的提升。”盛来运表示，下一步，要落实好《提振消费专项行动方案》，积极稳就业、促增收、减负担，提升居民消费能力，大力增加优质消费供给，持续释放消费潜力。\n　　 从“9.7%”看创新动能\n　　【亮点】一季度，规模以上高技术制造业增加值同比增长9.7%，新质生产力培育壮大。\n　　一季度，规模以上高技术制造业增加值同比增长9.7%，信息传输、软件和信息技术服务业增加值增长10.3%，显示产业创 新动力 在增强。\n　　从细分数据不难看出，开年以来，新质生产力正在培育壮大，高质量发展取得新成效。\n　　向新逐高，经济结构进一步优化。从产业结构看，一季度，规模以上装备制造业、高技术制造业增加值占规模以上工业的比重分别为33.7%、15.7%，同比分别提高1.9个、0.5个百分点，工业向高端化、智能化、绿色化转型的趋势明显。从需求结构看，一季度，高技术产业投资同比增长6.5%，占全部投资比重为10.3%。\n　　扩大开放，贸易新格局加快形成。近几年，我国积极开拓国际市场，构建贸易多元化格局，已与世界上150多个国家和地区成为贸易伙伴。一季度，对共建“ 一带一路 ”国家的出口同比增长7.2%，货物进出口额占全部进出口额比重超过50%。\n　　绿色转型，发展底色更加亮丽。一季度，以 新能源 车、 锂电池 、光伏为代表的 新能源 产业继续保持较高增长速度，非化石能源消费占能源消费总量的比重比上年同期提升1.5个百分点。\n　　守住底线，安全发展取得新进展。能源保供有力有效，原油、原煤生产稳中有增。化解地方债、中小金融机构、房地产等风险的政策积极有效。\n　　“无论国际形势怎么变化，我们都要坚定不移推动高质量发展，以中国高质量发展的确定性来应对外部变化的不确定性。”盛来运表示。\n　　 从“0.4%”看市场活力\n　　【亮点】一季度，民间投资同比增长0.4%，由上年全年下降转为增长，彰显出民营经济活力在提升。\n　　民营经济是推进中国式现代化的生力军，是高质量发展的重要基础。“各地方各部门认真贯彻落实民营企业座谈会精神，把党中央对发展民营经济的要求落实落地，取得明显成效。”盛来运结合数据作了分析。\n　　生产经营在改善。一季度，规模以上工业企业中，私营企业增加值同比增长7.3%，增速比上年全年有所回升，且快于全部规模以上工业企业增速。\n　　活力动力在增强。一季度制造业民间投资同比增长9.7%，基础设施民间投资增长9.3%，均快于各自领域平均增速。从进出口看，一季度民营企业进出口额同比增长5.8%，快于全部进出口额增速，占全部进出口总额的比重提升到56.8%。\n　　创新动能更强劲。“从生成式 人工智能 到人工智能 机器人 ，再到民用航空、量子信息等多个领域，今年以来，民营企业的科技创新成果不断涌现，民营经济展现出强大的创新活力、潜力和市场竞争力。”盛来运说。\n　　从全部投资来看，今年一季度，全国固定资产投资（不含农户）同比增长4.2%，比上年全年加快1.0个百分点；扣除 房地产开发 投资，增长8.3%。\n　　这得益于一系列政策的助推。盛来运列出一组数据：一季度，新增专项债累计发行量接近1万亿元，固定资产投资本年实际到位资金同比增长3.7%，基础设施投资增长5.8%，比上年全年加快1.4个百分点；在大规模设备更新政策带动下，一季度设备工器具购置投资同比增长19%，比去年全年加快3.3个百分点，对全部投资增长贡献率为64.6%，有效拉动了投资。\n　　“中国有14亿多人口，市场规模巨大，人均国内生产总值超过1.3万美元，正处在消费升级的关键阶段，市场成长性好，无论是投资还是消费空间都非常大，将支撑中国经济持续发展。”盛来运说。\n　　 记者手记\n　　 “稳、新、韧”，中国经济底气足\n　　深度求索（DeepSeek）大模型火爆全球，“人造太阳”刷新纪录，家电卖场人头攒动，节日消费热度升温……开年以来，一幕幕微观图景释放出发展向新向好的积极信号。“一季报”中，一组组数据再次印证了中国经济回升向好的良好态势。从中，不难读出“稳、新、韧”的鲜明特点。\n　　“稳”，体现在经济底盘之稳。纵向看，一季度国内生产总值5.4%的增速高于去年全年的5%，也高于去年一季度的5.3%。横向比，这一增速在全球主要经济体中名列前茅。拿出这样的表现，中国经济不愧是“世界经济增长的主要贡献者和稳定锚”。\n　　“新”，可从供需两端的新气象观之。看需求，市场销售增速回升，以旧换新相关商品销售增长较快，出行、旅游、餐饮等服务消费方兴未艾。随着全方位扩大内需相关政策见效，强大国内市场的潜力正稳步释放。看生产，规上装备制造业增加值同比两位数增长，高技术制造业跑出加速度，彰显了产业体系完备的独特优势、产业升级的澎湃动能。\n　　“韧”，外贸体现得明显。一季度，在全球经济不确定性上升的背景下，我国货物出口同比增长6.9%，充分证明了中国制造的硬核实力、贸易多元化格局带来的抗冲击能力。“韧”，还体现在民营企业顽强的生命力。克服压力、直面困难，一季度民间投资由上年全年下降转为增长，背后是发展环境改善、民企信心增强。广大经营主体坚韧不拔，中国经济就更有韧劲。\n　　良好开局，为实现全年经济社会发展目标任务开了个好头，为决战决胜“十四五”鼓舞了士气，也为中国号巨轮应对风险挑战、栉风沐雨前行注入了坚实底气。\n　　集中精力办好自己的事情，中国经济必将稳中有进、持续向好。\n（文章来源：人民日报）",

    "title": "Woman 'Chained' in Orthodox Jewish Marriage for 10 Years Now Helps Others",
    "text": "Sitting in her home on a leafy street in North West London, Rifka Meyer looks fondly at a framed photograph hanging above her dining room table.\nThe image, taken at her wedding, features her now-husband and the nine children — five hers, four his — who now form their blended family.\n\"I'm extremely happily married,\" she says.\nAdvertisement But she wasn't always.\nMeyer, a devout Orthodox Jew , once shared the house with her former husband, her second.\nBy her account, it was a deeply traumatic marriage that left her feeling manipulated, isolated, and a shell of her former self.\nAnd when she tried to leave it, she couldn't.\nTo obtain a religiously accepted separation in Judaism, women require a bill of divorce known as a gett.\nBut they can only be granted by a husband to his wife — and Meyer's husband refused.\nIt was the start of a decade of struggle to end her marriage.\nA traumatic marriage Meyer said the marriage was coercive on a number of levels, including financially and emotionally.\nAdvertisement \"He moved into my home with my children and he didn't contribute to anything,\" she said, adding: \"He was also controlling in the aspects of what I wore and who I could speak to. I found myself slowly being cut off from family and friends.\"\nRifka Meyer, the co-founder of GETToutUK and the owner of Rifka's Salon. Tori Ferenc for Business Insider She was deeply unhappy, a situation compounded by allegations of criminal behavior against her husband, which Business Insider is unable to describe in full for legal reasons.\nIn a message to Business Insider, her former husband, Yossi Elkouby, described the allegations and a consequent conviction as a conspiracy against him.\nMeyer said she resolved to end the marriage in 2011.\nAfter Meyer decided the marriage was over, and with the assistance of the London Beth Din, the central religious authority for Orthodox Jews in the United Kingdom, she was able to get her husband out of her house.\nBut when it came to securing the gett, a document in Jewish law that brings about a religious divorce between the couple, Meyer said the Beth Din was hesitant.\n\"They said, 'He's gone through a lot, we've managed to get him out of your house, let the dust settle and then we'll talk about a gett,\" she explained.\nHer husband's refusal left Meyer with few options to dissolve the marriage.\nAdvertisement It rendered her an \"agunah,\" which roughly translates from Hebrew as a \"chained woman.\"\nThat, Meyer said, is an apt description: \"There's a physical feeling of that ball and chain weighing you down.\"\nOr, to put it another way: \"You're technically stuck in a dead relationship with no future,\" she said.\nElkouby claimed to BI that he refused to give Meyer a gett because she was giving him the \"silent treatment.\"\nHe said he wanted to reach a financial settlement through dialogue but she \"stubbornly refused to discuss,\" leading to years of delay.\nElkouby told BI: \"She could have received her gett in no time if she'd cooperated.\"\nBecoming an agunah Agunot, the plural of agunah, are women trapped in marriages they want to escape. They are unable to date, remarry, start a family with someone else, or otherwise progress in life while still adhering to Jewish law.\nTheoretically, women like Meyer could obtain a civil divorce and explore these options outside their religion.\nAdvertisement But it would mean severing ties with their communities, leaving behind their jobs, friends, families, and synagogues.\nFor Meyer, it wasn't even a consideration. She said: \"I am who I am and I'm very secure in where I am in my religiosity.\"\nRifka Meyer Tori Ferenc for Business Insider After that, Meyer waited for her husband to have a change of heart. But with every passing week, month, and year, it became clearer that such a change was unlikely.\n\"I suppose it is the last act of control that someone has over their spouse and they can hold that as long as they want,\" she said.\nAfter four years, Meyer got back in touch with the London Beth Din, hoping to find a solution.\nThey told her that they were bound by Jewish law, and had little power to compel her husband, she said.\nA spokesperson for the London Beth Din told Business Insider that \"save for exceptional circumstances\" a gett cannot be forced.\n\"Therefore the suggestion that Dayanim were hesitant in forcing a gett completely misses the point that any gett which is achieved by force is invalid and no use to the recipient,\" he said.\nAdvertisement Public shaming That left one other option: public shaming.\n\"The Chief Rabbi's office put out a siruv against him, which is a publication about him, ostracizing him from the community,\" Meyer said.\nThe 2016 siruv, which has been reviewed by Business Insider, asked \"communities to be wary of social interactions or entering into business transactions\" with her then-husband.\nIt also urged synagogues to refuse him entry until he granted her a gett.\nAlthough it was a drastic measure — the London Beth Din spokesperson called it \"as strong as any siruv could be\" — Meyer does not think it made much of an impact.\nNevertheless, she believed it would serve to publicly expose her husband's refusal.\nRifka Meyer, the co-founder of GETToutUK and the owner of Rifka's Salon. Tori Ferenc for Business Insider Feeling like she had exhausted all other options, Meyer decided to go further afield. She flew to New York to visit the International Beit Din, an organization established by rabbis to help chained women nullify their marriages.\n\"It was extremely brutal,\" she said of the process. \"I remember crying, really feeling very exhausted from it all.\"\nAdvertisement The dayanim, or religious judges, spent months deliberating, she said. They reached a conclusion that she could have her marriage annulled, providing her with a document outlining the religious laws used to justify that decision.\n\"It took me a while to digest,\" she said. \"But when I did digest it and told my family and friends, it kind of cut the noose around my neck a little bit.\"\nBut it would only have effect in the US — back in the UK her marriage still stood.\nMeyer showed the document to the London Beth Din, who she said refused to approve an annulment because it would \"set a precedent.\"\nThe London Beth Din denied saying this, telling Business Insider that it does not recognize the International Beit Din and rejected the annulment because there \"were no grounds whatsoever\" for it.\nA novel approach Hopeless and dejected, feeling let down by the London Beth Din after nine years of waiting, Meyer made a last-ditch attempt to escape her marriage. It worked.\nShe made contact with a British lawyer, Gary Lesin-Davis, who had previously worked with clients seeking getts.\nThe lawyer tried a novel approach — using English law to force her husband's hand.\nAdvertisement Lesin-Davis wrote to Meyer's husband telling him that he was breaching UK laws against coercive and controlling behavior.\nThe specific law — Section 76 of Britain's Serious Crime Act 2015 — legislates against controlling or coercive behavior in an intimate or family relationship. It carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.\nThe Crown Prosecution Service makes it clear that forced marriage is one example of this.\nLesin-Davis told Business Insider that the first response from Meyer's then-husband was \"as you might expect, aggressive.\"\nBut eventually, with the prospect of prison time looming, there was a shift. Lesin-Davis said the then-husband changed his tune in a \"relatively short\" period of time.\n\"Perhaps he took legal advice, I'm not really quite sure,\" he added.\nElkouby gave BI a different account, saying that the timing was coincidental.\nHe didn't take \"much notice\" of Lesin-Davis or the legal threat, and instead granted the gett so he could remarry.\nAdvertisement \"The only way I could get remarried was if I gave a gett, that's why I gave it,' he said.\nIt took effect in September 2020, and Meyer was finally unshackled.\n\"I literally felt lighter,\" she recalled. \"I felt like I could breathe and my lungs were now filling at full capacity.\"\nRifka Meyer, the co-founder of GETToutUK and the owner of Rifka's Salon. Tori Ferenc for Business Insider But for others, it wouldn't be so easy.\nCaroline Moher-Maxwell was refused a gett by her husband Alan Moher. In April 2022, instead of granting the document, Moher went to prison. In a landmark case, he was sentenced to 18 months after pleading guilty to controlling or coercive behavior.\nSince getting her freedom, Meyer has been working to establish her own organization, GETToutUK , dedicated to helping agunot in the UK.\nShe said that within the first week, it had 13 women seeking its help. It recently celebrated its third anniversary.\nGETToutUK employs various strategies to aid these women, including sensitivity training for London religious bodies.\nAdvertisement This led the London Beth Din to incorporate compassionate gestures into the gett process, such as placing tissue boxes in its rooms and asking women if they prefer to be referred to by their married or maiden names, she said.\nGETToutUK has also contributed to the drafting of the statutory guidance in the UK's Domestic Abuse Act which explicitly addresses gett refusal.\nIts work has also expanded to assisting men whose wives refuse to accept a gett.\n'Chained' men While it is less common, a religious authority may also not provide a gett if the woman refuses to accept it or to be present at the proceedings.\nThis happened to Shmuli Simon, a London-based lawyer.\nThough Simon was never technically a \"chained man,\" because no Jewish courts officially declared his ex-wife a gett-refuser, he spent years trying to extricate himself from his marriage.\nLike Meyer, he felt let down by religious authorities.\n\"My issue is really not with my ex,\" he said. \"My issue was with the inability of the Batei Din to exercise any authority whatsoever.\"\nAdvertisement Simon and Meyer now share more than just a common experience with religious authorities — they share a life together. They married in December last year.\nReflecting on the unexpectedly joyful conclusion to a decade marked by tragedy, Meyer said she hopes her story offers glimmers of hope to people who are currently \"chained\".\n\"I hope it will give faith that it will end, one day, please God, and we will do what we can in order to help that happen,\" she said.",

    "text": "Yémen : nouvelles frappes américaines, nouvelle attaque des Houthis Les Houthis poursuivent leurs attaques en mer Rouge contre des navires de marchandises, ce qui affecte le commerce international de manière considérable. Photo : Reuters / HOUTHI MILITARY MEDIA L'armée américaine a abattu un drone au large du Yémen, jeudi, et a détruit un drone de surface naval sans équipage chargé d'explosifs en mer Rouge alors que les Houthis continuent de menacer le trafic maritime dans la région. Le Commandement militaire américain au Moyen-Orient (Centcom) a par ailleurs annoncé que ce mouvement yéménite proche de l'Iran avait lancé deux missiles visant potentiellement un cargo, mais sans le toucher. Le drone a été abattu au-dessus du golfe d'Aden tôt jeudi, a déclaré le Centcom sans préciser à qui il appartenait. Il a toutefois imputé aux Houthis la responsabilité du navire-drone, dont la destruction a provoqué des explosions annexes importantes mais pas de blessés ni de dégâts matériels. L'armée américaine avait auparavant annoncé qu'elle avait notamment détruit dix drones houthis et trois drones iraniens dans une série de frappes. Ces dernières semaines, les Houthis, qui contrôlent une grande partie du Yémen en guerre, ont multiplié les attaques contre des navires en mer Rouge et dans le golfe d'Aden, passages essentiels du commerce mondial. Les Houthis disent agir en solidarité avec les Palestiniens de Gaza, territoire assiégé et bombardé par Israël, en guerre contre le mouvement Hamas depuis l'attaque sanglante menée par ce dernier en sol israélien, le 7 octobre dernier. Mercredi vers 20 h 30, heure locale, les Houthis ont lancé un missile balistique antinavire [...] vers le golfe d'Aden, a annoncé le Centcom dans un communiqué. Moins d'une heure plus tard, le même destroyer a abattu trois drones iraniens qui se trouvaient à proximité, a ajouté le Centcom. Dans la soirée, il a encore annoncé que des frappes américaines avaient détruit dix drones d'attaque et un poste de commandement houthi, qui constituaient une menace imminente pour les navires marchands et pour les navires militaires américains. Plus tôt mercredi, l'armée américaine avait en outre dit avoir détruit un missile sol-air des Houthis prêt à être tiré depuis le Yémen et qui menaçait, selon elle, des avions américains. Les Houthis ont affirmé mercredi avoir visé un bâtiment américain, le USS Gravely. Les bases américaines visées en Syrie et en Irak D'autres groupes armés pro-iraniens ont attaqué ces derniers mois des bases américaines en Irak et en Syrie. Une de ces attaques a coûté la vie dimanche à trois militaires américains en Jordanie, à la frontière syrienne. Washington l'a imputée à la Résistance islamique en Irak, une nébuleuse de combattants issus de groupes armés pro-Iran, Téhéran réfutant toute implication. Les États-Unis et l'Iran ont plusieurs fois répété qu'ils ne cherchaient pas une escalade des tensions au Moyen-Orient dans le contexte de la guerre à Gaza. Le premier ministre britannique Rishi Sunak a une nouvelle fois appelé jeudi à l'arrêt des attaques inconsidérées des Houthis lors d'un entretien téléphonique avec le sultan Haitham d'Oman, pays voisin du Yémen et médiateur important entre l'Iran et les pays occidentaux. Rishi Sunak, dont le pays a mené plusieurs frappes conjointes contre les Houthis avec Washington, a souligné que l'action militaire n'était qu'un dernier recours face à des menaces intolérables pour la navigation mondiale, selon un communiqué de son bureau. Dans le golfe d'Aden, un autre navire marchand a été touché par un missile, ce qui a provoqué une explosion à bord, a indiqué jeudi la société britannique de sécurité maritime Ambrey. 35 attaques depuis novembre Un technicien des Forces armées britanniques prépare un appareil qui s’apprête à mener des frappes aériennes contre les Houthis au Yémen. Photo : Reuters / Ministère de la Défense du Royaume-Uni Les Houthis, qui affirment viser des navires liés à Israël, ont mené plus de 35 attaques contre des navires au large du Yémen depuis le 19 novembre, selon le ministère américain de la Défense. Avant de lancer des frappes, en janvier, les États-Unis, principal allié d'Israël, avaient déployé des navires de guerre en mer Rouge et institué une coalition maritime internationale pour protéger cette zone cruciale par où transite jusqu'à 12 % du commerce mondial. Depuis, les Houthis considèrent également les navires liés aux États-Unis ou au Royaume-Uni comme des cibles légitimes. Washington a annoncé à la mi-janvier les désigner à nouveau comme une entité terroriste. L'impact de ces tensions dans cette zone est lourd : [le transport maritime de conteneurs par la mer Rouge a chuté de près de 30 % sur un an](https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/2046123/mer-rouge-transport-conteneurs-fmi), a annoncé mercredi le Fonds monétaire international (FMI).",

    "text": "O dorama \"Beleza Verdadeira\" entrou no catálogo da Netflix e já está fazendo muito sucesso. A história traz uma jornada emocionante e cativante. A produção sul-coreana ultrapassou fronteiras e conquistou o mundo com seu elenco e história. A trama traz mensagens universais e profundas.\n\"Beleza Verdadeira'' é muito mais que um romance entre estudantes. O dorama leva os telespectadores numa viagem de autoconhecimento, superação e desafios. A série aborda temas delicados como o bulliyng e a pressão feita pela sociedade para que as pessoas tenham uma aparência perfeita, além da busca pela identidade.\nTransformação e autoaceitação O dorama traz temas do cotidiano de todos, principalmente dos jovens. Ele gira em torno de uma jovem que passou anos sofrendo bullying por conta de sua aparência física. Ela então acaba descobrindo a mágica da maquiagem e se tranforma em uma especialista no assunto. A jovem usa os truques para esconder suas imperfeições na nova escola.\nAo longo da trama, ela acaba se envolvendo em um triângulo amoroso com dois colegas de classe, cada um deles tem seus próprios desafios para enfrentar. O triângulo amoroso traz uma dinâmica bem interessante ao seriado, o que faz os telespectadores se manterem interessados na história do começo ao fim.\nDiferente de outros doramas A produção se destaca pois aborda temas delicados como a autoestima e o preconceito, de uma maneira realista e muito delicada oferecendo um ponto de vista necessário sobre os assuntos.\nAlém disso, \"Beleza Verdadeira\" consegue equilibrar de maneira natural o drama e a comédia, o que é incomum nos doramas, que sempre estão de um lado ou de outro.\nPor suas mensagens serem universais, o dorama conquistou fãs no mundo inteiro. Ele conta com dezesseis episódios, cada um com mais de uma hora de duração, o que é muito bom para os fãs do gênero.\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla eu odio odio.

    "title": "Wind damage devastates homeowner in Pulaski County",
    "text": "PULASKI CO., Ky. (LEX 18) — Pulaski County resident Linda Crowley faced a terrifying ordeal last night as powerful wind gusts reached up to 50 miles per hour, causing significant damage to her property. Crowley, who has called the trailer home for nearly 30 years, described the chaos as \"everything was blowing off the walls, and crashing. It was unreal, it was terrifying.\"\nThe storm left Crowley reeling, as she found many of her valuables scattered across her front yard and beyond. \"I can't believe I've been here ever since '96 in this trailer and for it to be totally gone, you know,” she said, reflecting on the sudden loss.\nDuring the storm, Crowley feared for her life. \"I just didn't think I was gonna make it out alive,\" she recounted. While she was crawling through her front door, waiting for emergency responders to arrive, she was struck on the head by a piece of wood. “The wind was just so fierce, even the walls on the inside were just moving,” she added.\nIn the aftermath, Crowley has been surrounded by a supportive community. Neighbors and even strangers have banded together to help her put a tarp on what remains of her roof. “I appreciate all the help and yeah, we are close. Everyone's close around here,” she said.\nTim Turner, a Texas native who happened to be in the area, was among those who lent a hand. Although he did not know Crowley personally, he felt compelled to assist her. \"It means the world to me because I'm showing the love of Jesus Christ to somebody else, just like he showed me,” Turner shared. He added, “I think that if everyone would stop and go help your neighbor, the world would be a different place. This is what we do. It's how we survive.”\nTurner quickly grabbed his staple gun and set to work, demonstrating the spirit of community and kindness that can emerge even in the face of disaster. \"I live through and I praise God for that. God's been good to me,\" he remarked.",

    "title": "Los colectivos contra las plantas de biogás en Murcia se unifican: \"El Mar Menor se puede ver amenazado si se construyen\"",
    "text": "En la Región de Murcia , desde finales del año pasado, una serie de colectivos vecinales están organizando protestas contra la construcción de grandes plantas de biogás previstas cerca de sus núcleos urbanos. Para ejercer más fuerza, seis de estas organizaciones de distintos municipios se acaban de unificar para constituir la Coordinadora de Plataformas Stop Biogás, una entidad que surge para \"afrontar la alarmante falta de regulación y transparencia en la construcción masiva de estas plantas \".\nAsí lo explica el comunicado de constitución de este colectivo, que estará dirigido por los líderes de las organizaciones municipales que lo componen: Stop Biogás de Santomera, Las Torres de Cotillas, San Javier-Mar Menor, Mula, Fuente Álamo y Molina de Segura. Sus portavoces, José Hernández y Nuria Velázquez, atienden a ENCLAVE ODS para subrayar que esta coordinadora nace \"oponiéndose a los cuarenta proyectos de plantas que están en marcha , tal y como están planteados ahora\".\nNuria Velázquez valora que \"estas plantas deberían respetar el objetivo de dar solución a unos residuos\", los purines: desperdicios de origen orgánico y otros restos que son producto de la actividad ganadera . Sin embargo, explica que \"el tamaño de algunas macroplantas que se quieren construir no está proporcionado con la cantidad de residuos que se originan en los municipios, y su ubicación prevista no respeta las distancias mínimas para garantizar la calidad de vida de los vecinos \".\nLa manifestación del 6 de octubre contra la planta de biogás de Las Torres de Cotillas (Murcia).\nLos colectivos que protestan contra la construcción de las plantas temen por varias cuestiones: los olores que puedan provenir de los purines tratados, la cercanía de algunas de estas instalaciones \"con espacios como gasolineras, lo que puede originar graves accidentes\" y el \"incremento del tráfico\" rodado en los núcleos urbanos, detalla la portavoz. Además, en el caso de la planta que se pretende construir en la pedanía sanjaviereña de El Mirador, preocupa su cercanía con el Mar Menor .\nCedida\n[El alcalde de Las Torres de Cotillas anuncia una consulta pública a favor o en contra del proyecto de la planta de biogás] \"Un entorno tan emblemático como la laguna salada se puede ver amenazado . Algunas empresas quieren crear más macrogranjas para alimentar estas plantas, cuando debería ser al revés: que las plantas se dimensionen para acoger la cantidad de residuos que ya existe\", afirma Velázquez.\nY es que los purines producidos por las instalaciones ganaderas pueden ser muy perjudiciales para el Mar Menor si las empresas que las explotan no cuentan con unos procesos de control exhaustivos. Esta es otra cuestión que pone en alerta a la plataforma Stop Biogás San Javier-Mar Menor y a la nueva coordinadora regional, ya que su portavoz asegura que \"el problema de los residuos en las macrogranjas está muy mal resuelto en nuestra Región\".\nEl otro portavoz de Stop Biogás Región de Murcia, José Hernández, abogado, recalca que la coordinadora de plataformas \" exige que haya una regulación regional o nacional \" para evitar \"la proliferación de estas plantas sin ningún control\". \"En cada Ayuntamiento hay una respuesta distinta ante una misma circunstancia. En unos se paraliza la construcción de planta y, en otros, todo está permitido\", menciona.\nNuria Velázquez y José Hernández, portavoces de la Coordinadora de Plataformas Stop Biogás Región de Murcia. Cedidas\nPregunta: ¿Cuáles son las acciones que tiene previsto tomar a corto plazo la Coordinadora de Plataformas Stop Biogás Región de Murcia?\nJosé Hernández: Este mes vamos a hacer una reunión de presentación de la coordinadora, y la daremos en Murcia. La siguiente actuación dependerá de cómo se desarrollen los acontecimientos. Tenemos la herramienta de las manifestaciones para más adelante. Si es necesario, nos planteamos acudir frente a la Asamblea Regional o al Palacio de San Esteban (la sede del Gobierno autonómico).\nNuria Velázquez: Nos vamos a seguir poniendo en contacto con distintas instituciones. Además, en breve convocaremos actos donde nos unificaremos todas las plataformas, porque gran parte del problema nace de la falta de regulación autonómica.\nLas protestas vecinales que se han ido llevando a cabo a nivel local las distintas manifestaciones, aunque no han tumbado los proyectos que critican, sí que han logrado algunas pequeñas victorias. Es el caso de Las Torres de Cotillas, de cuya plataforma es líder el propio José Hernández, y que consiguió sacar a las calles a centenares de vecinos , pese a tratarse de un municipio pequeño, de poco más de 22.000 habitantes.\nUna manifestación convocada por la plataforma Stop Biogás de Las Torres de Cotillas frente a su Ayuntamiento, el pasado 18 de septiembre. Facebook Stop Biogás Torres de Cotillas\nComo resultado, el alcalde torreño, Pedro José Noguera, anunció que iba a celebrar una \"consulta popular\" de la mano de la Cátedra de Políticas Públicas de la Universidad de Murcia \"para que los vecinos decidan: s i no la quieren, no se hará \". Sin embargo, el primer edil declara a este diario que esa consulta aún no tiene fecha porque están \"esperando la autorización del Consejo de Ministros\" para poder llevarla a cabo.\nEn otros puntos de la Región de Murcia, los alcaldes rechazaron en primera instancia los proyectos originales presentados por las empresas que querían instalar esas plantas de biometano. El alcalde de San Javier, José Miguel Luengo, declaró que si bien apoya el proyecto, ponía como condición a Enagás que la planta de El Mirador no tratase purines .\nPor otro lado, el alcalde de Santomera, Víctor Martínez, rechazó directamente el proyecto de construcción de una de esas plantas . Pese a ello, en los dos municipios existen todavía plataformas locales Stop Biogás; con una actividad especialmente intensa en el caso de la localidad ribereña.\nUna recreación de la planta de biometano de Las Torres de Cotillas. Ayto. Las Torres de Cotillas\nP.: ¿Por qué hay plataformas Stop Biogás en municipios donde los alcaldes han rechazado los proyectos?\nJosé Hernández: Algunos ayuntamientos, como es el caso de Santomera, no es que estén en contra, sino que dicen que la planta no cumple los criterios técnicos para construirse en ese sitio. Mula y San Javier han hecho lo mismo.\nPero eso no quiere decir que esos criterios no se puedan subsanar para seguir adelante, o que la Comunidad Autónoma decida que es de interés estratégico y siga. Por eso están estas plataformas. No nos fiamos de nuestros equipos de Gobierno ni de la Comunidad.\nLos dos portavoces concluyen que la principal exigencia de la Coordinadora de Plataformas Stop Biogás es \" que haya una normativa y que se paralice todo hasta que se regule y se asiente dónde se pueden poner esas plantas, qué condiciones deben cumplir...\"\nProtestas sociales Molina de Segura San Javier Las Torres de Cotillas Santomera Mula (Murcia) Región de Murcia (Comunidad) Biogás Biometano Mientras Dormías - NEWSLETTER Apúntate gratis y recibe cada mañana un análisis de los temas del día Apuntarme De conformidad con el RGPD y la LOPDGDD, EL LEÓN DE EL ESPAÑOL PUBLICACIONES, S.A. tratará los datos facilitados con la finalidad de remitirle noticias de actualidad.",

    "text": "[ ](https://www.informazione.it/a/E0A5ADA4-BFA8-4458-B062-AB7A46FBA7B5/Natale-e-pace-rosso-sangue) [Leggi](https://www.avvenire.it/attualita/pagine/terra-santa-per-cambiare-sguardo-natale-e-pace-ro) Papa Francesco è recentemente finito sotto il fuoco delle critiche da parte dell'American Jewish Committee, una delle più antiche organizzazioni ebraiche mondiali che si batte contro l'antisemitismo. La preoccupazione nasce dal fatto che il Papa non ha distinto tra il terrorismo di Hamas e la difesa di Israele nel suo discorso all'Angelus della scorsa domenica. Durante l'Angelus, Papa Francesco ha usato il termine \"terrorismo\" per definire le bombe di Gaza, senza fare alcuna distinzione tra gli atti di \"violenza intenzionale\" del 7 ottobre da parte di Hamas e le vittime involontarie che si verificano purtroppo in una \"guerra giusta\". Questo ha suscitato preoccupazioni tra gli ebrei americani, che ritengono che l'atteggiamento del Papa sia sbilanciato. In risposta a queste critiche, il Vaticano ha inviato un cardinale di peso in Terra Santa con il compito di sostenere la comunità cattolica locale che si appresta a celebrare il Natale. Dal 7 ottobre, Betlemme è una città prigioniera, anche in questi giorni di Natale. Per entrarvi si è costretti a passare, e non è facile, il posto di blocco dell’esercito israeliano nei pressi del villaggio di Khader, a sud di Betlemme. Tutti gli altri posti di blocco sono sigillati dal giorno dell’attacco di Hamas nel sud di Israele. Una famiglia di profughi, a Betlemme, a Natale. Ma qui tutto è più feroce e irrazionale che ai tempi di Erode e dei Romani quando, secondo il vangelo di Matteo, Giuseppe «levatosi, prese il bambino e sua madre e di notte partì per l’Egitto», per sfuggire alla strage degli innocenti. Qui i profughi sono eternamente tali, sono qui dal 1948: proprio perché in Egitto non ci sono voluti andare.",
