    "title": "Grimes frantically contacts ex Elon Musk with a chainsaw about their child's urgent health issue",
    "text": "Grimes, also known as Claire Elise Boucher, recently reached out to Elon Musk on social media regarding a ‘medical crisis’ involving their child. This plea for help came as the ‘First Buddy’ (Musk) was wielding a chainsaw alongside Javier Millei at CPAC.\nThe singer and artist Grimes shares three children with Elon Musk, who is publicly known to have 13 kids. A conservative influencer, Ashley St. Clair, recently claimed to be the mother of Musk’s 13th child.\nIssues around custody of their children have caused conflicts between Grimes and the renowned entrepreneur, particularly her disapproval of Musk showcasing their son X during a press event in the Oval Office with former President Donald Trump.\nMusk attended the Conservative Political Action Conference with Argentina Prime Minister Javier Millei, where he held up a chainsaw while wearing aviator sunglasses and a MAGA hat to represent the cuts he was making to the federal government.\nIn a since deleted post to Musk-owned X Grimes responded to a tweet Musk made Wednesday with more pressing matters regarding one of their offspring.\n‘Plz respond about our child’s medical crisis. I am sorry to do this publicly but it is no longer acceptable to ignore this situation. This requires immediate attention,’ the Canadian singer wrote.\nShe clarified that Musk didn’t even have to respond to her but could contact her through a third party.\n‘If you don’t want to talk to me can you please designate or hire someone who can so that we can move forward on solving this. This is urgent, Elon.’\nSocial media followers expressed their sympathies with Grimes in response and wondered why she was taking it public, saying the effects could cause permanent damage.\n‘I’m not giving any details but he won’t respond to texts call or emails and has skipped every meeting and our child will suffer life long impairment if he doesn’t respond asap, so I need him to f***ing respond and if I have to apply public pressure then I guess that’s where we are at.’\nHe has yet to respond to Grimes’ message publicly, though he has made multiple posts to X since she asked for help.\nAfter Grimes deleted the post, she was informed by a follower that her original tweet had been ‘shadowbanned’ by X.\nShe could only respond: ‘lol.’\nMusk, who has become Trump´s close adviser spearheading a massive effort to cut spending and downsize the federal government, was set to meet with Milei, who was in Washington to attend CPAC.\nThe ‘First Buddy’ was announced as a speaker for the conference earlier on Thursday by Mercedes Schlapp, a CPAC organizer.\nThe scheduled meeting between Musk and Milei was confirmed by a person who insisted on anonymity to discuss an event that hadn´t yet been announced publicly and said the meeting was private and had been planned for weeks.\nMilei was the first foreign leader to meet with Trump after he won the election, but before he took office. He was also invited to the inauguration.\nA self-described ‘anarcho-capitalist,’ Milei has received praise frequently from Musk for implementing a series of austerity measures, laying off tens of thousands of government workers, freezing public infrastructure projects to fix Argentina´s long mismanaged economy.\nGrimes and Musk welcomed their first child, X., in May 2020 and originally gave their son the name X Æ A-12, which would have violated California regulations as it contained characters that are not in the modern English alphabet.\nThey then changed the child’s name to X Æ A-Xii. and received plenty of criticism for choosing a name perceived to be impractical and difficult to pronounce.\nThe following year they welcomed their daughter Exa Dark Sideræl via surrogacy.\nIn between then and welcoming their son Tao in 2023, the couple ‘semi-separated’ and in January 2022, Grimes said of Musk: ‘I would probably refer to him as my boyfriend, but we’re very fluid.’\nHowever, two months later in March 2022, she described Musk as her ‘best friend and the love of my life.’\nFollowing the birth of their third child, Grimes sued Musk in September 2023 over parental rights to their children in a California court. Musk allegedly fought to keep the hearing closed, asking for the documents to be sealed.\nUpon seeing her son in the Oval office, Grimes berated her former flame on social media and said: ‘He should not be in public like this. I did not see this, thank you for alerting me. But I’m glad he was polite. Sigh.’\nThe singer revealed in November last year that she has been in a year-long custody battle with Musk, during which time she allegedly did not see one of her children for five months.\nMusk sued for for custody of the children he shares with Grimes in Texas, where his businesses are headquartered.\nGrimes then counter-sued filing a ‘petition to establish parental relationship’ in a California court, typically seen as the first step in suing for custody for unmarried parents.\nShe claimed that Musk was withholding access to her kids and even prevented them from seeing their terminally ill maternal grandmother.\nA Travis County Clerk confirmed that the Texas dispute had been settled, but declined to give further details.\nGrimes claimed the ordeal almost left her ‘bankrupt’ and unable to make new music.",

Born in Newport, RI, son of the late Judge Gabriel D. and Mary (Wogan) Russo. He was predeceased by his beautiful wife of 59 years, MaryJane (Sisson) Russo.

He eventually landed in the technical field holding several positions for a variety of companies throughout Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New York. He ultimately landed as the Director of Data Processing for Duracell Batteries until his retirement in 1992. Paul and MaryJane were fortunate to have first lived as newlyweds in Manassas VA, and then as they welcomed children, returned home to Jamestown, RI. Later they lived in Danbury, Thomaston, Winchester, Goshen, and Burlington, CT. They retired to Biddeford, ME where they lived on the ocean for fifteen years before returning to CT. Paul leaves many beloveds, including his daughter Deborah DeBisschop and her husband Mark, with whom he made his home in New Hartford, CT; son Michael P. Russo and his wife Karla of Barrington, RI; and son James A. Russo and his wife Jennifer of Thomaston, CT. Paul also leaves behind his brother, Bryan Russo and his wife Elisa of White Plains, NY.

    "text": "Al via lo sciopero generale, proclamato da Cgil e Uil, per chiedere di cambiare la manovra di bilancio, aumentare salari e pensioni, finanziare sanità, istruzione, servizi pubblici e investire nelle politiche industriali. Uno stop di 8 ore per tutti i settori privati e pubblici, ad eccezione dei trasporti dove è di 4 ore: per bus e metro dalle 9 alle 13, così come per il trasporto marittimo, per i voli dalle 10 alle 14. Esclusi dallo stop i treni. Parte il corteo a Napoli È appena partito da Piazza Mancini, a Napoli, il corteo organizzato da Cgil e Uil in occasione dello sciopero generale programmato per oggi dalle due organizzazioni sindacali. I lavoratori raggiungeranno Piazza Matteotti dopo aver attraversato il corso Umberto e via Guglielmo Sanfelice. Il comizio finale sarà affidato a Nicola Ricci, segretario generale della Cgil Napoli e Campania e Pierpaolo Bombardieri, segretario generale della Uil. Ad aprire il corteo, lo striscione delle due sigle sindacali che hanno proclamato lo sciopero con la scritta «Cambiare la manovra di bilancio». Le manifestazioni di Napoli e Bologna Una mobilitazione che si sta svolgendo in 43 piazze su tutto il territorio nazionale, indetta per contrastare «le scelte ingiuste e sbagliate del governo». I segretari generali, Maurizio Landini e Pierpaolo Bombardieri concluderanno rispettivamente le manifestazioni di Bologna (corteo ore 9.30, da Porta Lame a Piazza Maggiore) e Napoli (corteo ore 9.30, da Piazza Mancini a Piazza Matteotti). In contemporanea, in alcune città, i comizi saranno conclusi dai dirigenti sindacali delle segreterie nazionali di Cgil e Uil. Corteo a Napoli, le prime parole di Bombardieri «Mi pare che Salvini si sia sprecato in insulti, ci ha detto che siamo degli estremisti, ci ha detto che siamo ridicoli, e quegli insulti sono forse rivolti a queste persone che riempiono 40 piazze in questo splendido Paese, che chiedono soltanto di essere ascoltati, di modificare le scelte che sono state fatte finora». Lo ha detto Pierpaolo Bombardieri a Napoli. «Intanto mi pare - ha aggiunto Bombardieri - che non tutto il governo abbia fatto le stesse valutazioni. Questa è una protesta pacifica, democratica, è strano che un vicepresidente del Consiglio attacchi in questo modo un diritto riconosciuto dalla Costituzione. Noi rispondiamo con queste piazze, rispondiamo con la democrazia, con manifestazioni pacifiche, democratiche, che chiedono cambiamenti.» «La precettazione mette a rischio un diritto costituzionale che e riconosciuto alle persone e viene esercitato attraverso le organizzazioni sindacali. La sensazione e che ci sia un attacco politico sul diritto allo sciopero perche le progettazioni arrivano soltanto quando c'e lo sciopero di Uil e di Cgil. Al netto di questo la risposta migliore e questa che arriva da 50 piazze piene di persone che chiedono in modo democratico e pacifico di avere delle risposte, di fare dei cambiamenti». I numeri della protesta Sono almeno in 30mila presenti in piazza, secondo la stima di Cgil Napoli e Campania. «Non consentiremo che qualcuno disegni per la Campania un futuro senza fabbriche, fatto di emigrazione obbligata, assistenzialismo e diseguaglianze. Il Sud è anche industria, produzione, tecnologia, innovazione, competenze, maestranze. Con 5 miliardi e 300 milioni di euro in meno per il Mezzogiorno, come ci ricorda la Svimez, gli effetti finanziari della manovra saranno devastanti. Questo Governo sta per decidere che tutte le crisi aziendali, per le realtà al di sotto dei 250 dipendenti, saranno scaricate sulle Regioni, lavandosene le mani e scaricando sul territorio la ricerca di soluzioni che solo il Governo deve trovare. Siamo ancora in attesa di soluzioni per Jabil, Dema, IIA, Softlab, Conbipel, Gesco, Beco, Nuroll, TTA, per le lavoratrici e i lavoratori in somministrazione delle Questure e delle Prefetture, per i precari della scuola e i ricercatori e per i tanti che sono senza più ammortizzatori sociali e sostegni al reddito», dice il segretario generale Nicola Ricci, anticipando ai giornalisti il contenuto dell'intervento che terrà a piazza Matteotti al termine del corteo.",

    "text": "Photo Unsplash Newsroom\n01 NOVEMBER 2024 - 08:21 Good morning, Cyprus! As we roll into Friday and kick off the weekend, don’t put away the umbrella just yet. A low-pressure system is sweeping in from the southwest, bringing along some strong northeastern winds that will stick around until tomorrow afternoon.\nToday, expect partly to mostly cloudy skies with a chance of scattered showers and even isolated thunderstorms, particularly around the mountains, inland areas, and western parts of the island later in the day. Winds will be brisk, ranging from 4 to 5 on the Beaufort scale, stirring up some choppy seas. Temperatures are set to reach about 27°C across the coast and inland, while the mountain regions will stay cooler at around 17°C.\nTonight, skies will start to clear up, though a few clouds may linger, especially along the coast, possibly bringing a stray shower. Winds will ease up a bit, but coastal areas may still feel a steady breeze at times. Temperatures will dip to 15°C inland, with coastal areas slightly warmer at around 18-20°C, while the mountains cool down to 10°C.\nLooking ahead, both Saturday and Sunday are likely to bring localized showers and isolated thunderstorms, with the chance of hail during some storms. Monday looks similar, with showers likely in the afternoon. Temperatures will stay warm for now, but expect a slight drop by Monday, bringing things closer to seasonal norms.\nEnjoy the weekend, stay safe, and keep an eye on those clouds!\nLawmakers weigh extended traffic fine deadlines and countdown timers Halloween haunt: Supreme Court digs into Cyprus black magic case Ακολουθήστε το KNEWS\nστο Google News TAGS Cyprus | weather",

    "text": "A 4-year-old California boy who wandered away from a campground in the Sierra National Forest was found safe after spending 22 hours alone in the wilderness, authorities said. A search-and-rescue team of about 50 officers and volunteers set out around 11 a.m. Thursday after the child was reported missing from the camping site surrounded by dense forest north of Fresno. The boy, from Torrance near Los Angeles, was last seen wearing shorts and a T-shirt, the Fresno County Sheriff's Office said. Around 8 a.m. Friday, the boy was discovered in good condition “nestled under a tree” near a lake about a quarter mile (.4 km) from the Rancheria Campground where his family was. “He was hungry and exhausted, but otherwise in good health. We got him a sandwich and then carried him out to be reunited with Mom and Dad,” the sheriff's office said Saturday on Facebook. Officials say the boy simply wandered away and lost his sense of direction.
