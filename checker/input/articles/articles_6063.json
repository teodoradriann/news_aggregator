    "text": "A [Joliet](https://www.shawlocal.com/tags/joliet/) man was sentenced to 23 years in prison for the predatory criminal sexual assault of a child in 2018. On Wednesday, [Will County](https://www.shawlocal.com/tags/will-county/) Judge Dave Carlson delivered the prison sentence for Quinton Jenkins, 41, according to Will County State’s Attorney James Glasgow’s Office. Jenkins will serve 85% of the 23-year sentence and receive credit for 1,971 days served while incarcerated. Jenkins was supposed to take an 11-year-old boy to a birthday party on Dec. 1, 2018 but he instead took him to an apartment, where the crime occurred, according to Glasgow’s office. The boy called his mother and after she unsuccessfully tried to call him back, the police were notified. “What should have been a fun afternoon at a birthday party turned into a life-altering nightmare for this young boy because of the horrific sexual assault by this serial child predator with a history of taking advantage of young children,” Glasgow said in a statement. Glasgow said many children keep silent about their abuse because they “don’t fully understand it, are afraid of the abuser, or feel ashamed about something that was in no way their fault.” “This young boy should be commended for his courage in speaking up about the abuse,” Glasgow said. As part of Jenkins’ sentence, he must register as a child sex offender for the rest of his life. If he is released from prison, he must spend three years to life on mandatory supervised release, otherwise known as parole. Glasgow commended numerous prosecutors, victim witness advocates, Joliet police officers and the Will County Children’s Advocacy Center for their role in the prosecution of the case.",

    "text": "Trabalhadores da PepsiCo, que produz Gatorade, Pepsi e chips - Ruffles, Doritos, entre outros - continuam em greve, nesta sexta-feira (29), pelo fim das escalas de 6 dias de trabalho por 1 dia de folga, além da oposição a 6 dias de trabalho por 2 de folga. Na próxima segunda-feira (2), está marcada audiência no TRT-2.\nNo último domingo (24), trabalhadores das unidades de Itaquera e Sorocaba decidiram entrar em greve. A decisão tomada em assembleia foi motivada, segundo o sindicato da categoria, pela postura intransigente da empresa e recusa em dialogar sobre a jornada de trabalho.\n“Diante da tentativa arbitrária da PepsiCo de implementar a jornada 6x1 e 6x2, propusemos a jornada de trabalho espanhola como alternativa [alternar entre uma semana de 48 horas e uma semana de 40 horas]. Porém, mesmo com nossas insistentes solicitações para um diálogo construtivo, a empresa se manteve inflexível”, divulgou o Sindicato dos Trabalhadores nas Indústrias de Laticínios e Alimentação de São Paulo e Região (Stilasp).\nO sindicato considera a postura da empresa inaceitável, considerando que há atualmente uma mobilização nacional pelo fim de jornadas de trabalho exaustivas. “Nossa luta é para que todos trabalhadores tenham qualidade de vida e saúde mental.” A entidade não tem estimativa de adesão dos funcionários à greve.\nO tema ganhou repercussão nacional em novembro em razão da proposta de emenda à Constituição Federal (PEC), de autoria da deputada federal Erika Hilton (PSol-SP), que propõe jornada de trabalho de, no máximo, 36 horas semanais e quatro dias de trabalho por semana no Brasil.\nSegundo o Stilasp, na próxima audiência no TRT-2, as partes deverão apresentar, no mínimo, duas novas propostas de jornada de trabalho.\nEmpresa\nA PepsiCo disse, em nota, que “cumpre rigorosamente as leis do país e, ainda que em discussão no Congresso, a jornada 6x1 está de acordo com a legislação brasileira em vigor.”\n“A PepsiCo permanece aberta ao diálogo com seus colaboradores e representantes sindicais em busca de soluções equilibradas para todas as partes, reafirmando o seu cuidado e compromisso com as pessoas com base em relações éticas e responsáveis que sempre orientam as suas decisões”, informou.\nLeia mais",

    "text": "By Michael Katz | Thursday, 18 January 2024 10:46 PM EST North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, who ended his long shot bid for the Republican presidential nomination in early December, told Newsmax on Thursday it's time the party comes together and throws its full support behind former President Donald Trump. Burgum told \"Greg Kelly Reports\" that after next week's first-in-the-nation New Hampshire presidential primary, which he predicted Trump will win, Nikki Haley and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis should drop out of the race so the party can begin the campaign against President Joe Biden. \"We all had our shot,\" Burgum said. \"The folks that are still in it had their shot. The evidence is clear: President Trump is leading in all 50 states. Let's move on from this primary and get focused on winning the White House and get our country going in the right direction in November.\" Burgum said he and his wife, Kathryn, campaigned for Trump in Iowa, where the former president won the caucuses in a landslide, and they are campaigning for him in New Hampshire. He said they saw the resiliency in Iowa of Trump supporters who turned out despite subzero temperatures and bitter wind and snow to deliver a record-breaking victory for the former president. \"The voter intensity and support for President Trump is really incredible,\" Burgum said. \"... If President Trump wins in New Hampshire, I think we should just say, 'Let's go, we've got the candidate, he's leading in all 50 states.' The sooner we start spending money against Joe Biden and stop spending money — Republicans attacking Republicans, classic mistake we make — the better chance we have of getting our country going in the right direction again because under Joe Biden, the world is less safe.\" About NEWSMAX TV: NEWSMAX is the fastest-growing cable news channel in America!

New to Kayo? Start Your Free Trial Today >\nBBC Radio 1 host Vicky Hawkesworth featured alongside Fi Glover and Owain Wyn Evans but was left feeling red-faced after her bizarre answer.\nThe question that left fans watching on was a seemingly simple: “In sport the US-born tennis player who in the 1990s won all four Grand Slams and an Olympic gold medal is Andre who?”\nThe response was an all-time mix up of two men who share the same name.\nHawkesworth responded confidently with: “The giant”.\nThe correct Andre. (Photo by Mark Dadswell/Getty Images). Source: Supplied\nNot the right Andre. Source: Twitter\nThe radio host had confused eight-time Grand Slam champion Andre Agassi for the 223cm professional wrestler, Andre The Giant.\nFellow contestant Rick Edwards burst out laughing, as did many viewers watching from home.\nOne reacted saying: “Hahahahaha the single best answer in quiz show history.”\nAnother added: “Just saw this and spat my tea out.”\nA third wrote: “New balls for Andre The Giant!?!”\nAnd another commented: “Best answer for ages.”\nVicky took the teasing in good spirit and responded on social media saying: “Well I knew it couldn’t be Peter Andre so this was the next best guess!”\nShe added: “How do we know he didn’t play tennis in his spare time?!”\nThis article originally appeared on The Sun and was reproduced with permission.",

    "title": "Commerce Department Bans Kaspersky Software in US",
    "text": "In the Biden Administration’s continuing effort to reduce the risk of cybersecurity spyware from foreign adversaries, including Russia, the United States Department of Commerce (Commerce) issued a final rule (Rule) on June 16, 2023, entitled “Protecting Americans’ Sensitive Data from Foreign Adversaries” and also amended a previously issued rule (“Securing the Information and Communications Technology Supply Chain”) that had been published under a Biden Executive Order. The [new Rule](https://www.bis.gov/sites/default/files/files/KL-press_release-CLEAN.pdf) gives Commerce authority to prohibit or regulate communications technology or services connected to foreign adversaries that pose a risk to national security, including software. For the first time using the authority provided by the Rule, on June 19, 2024, Commerce issued a final determination prohibiting Kaspersky Lab, Inc., its affiliates, subsidiaries, and parent companies from “directly or indirectly” providing anti-virus software and cybersecurity products or services in the U.S. According to Commerce, “Kaspersky will generally no longer be able to, among other activities, sell its software within the United States or provide updates to software already in use. ” Kaspersky has until September 29, 2024, to cease doing business in the U.S. and provide existing customers anti-virus and codebase updates until that time. Kaspersky has been selling software and services in the U.S. for years, so it is no doubt embedded in company cybersecurity programs throughout the U.S. according to Commerce: “Individuals and businesses that utilize Kaspersky software are strongly encouraged to expeditiously transition to new vendors to limit exposure of personal or other sensitive data to malign actors due to a potential lack of cybersecurity coverage. Individuals and businesses that continue to use existing Kaspersky products and services will not face legal penalties under the Final Determination. However, any individual or business that continues to use Kaspersky products and services assumes all the cybersecurity and associated risks of doing so.” Commerce determined that Kaspersky posed an undue or unacceptable risk to national security because “the ability to gather valuable U.S. business information, including intellectual property, and to gather U.S. persons’ sensitive data for malicious use by the Russian Government, pose an undue or unacceptable national security risk and therefore prohibits continued transactions involving Kaspersky’s products and services.” On June 20, 2024, in coordination with Commerce, the Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) [designated](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2420) twelve executives and senior leadership from Kaspersky to the OFAC sanctions list. If you are using Kaspersky products or services, the final determination has a meaningful impact on your organization. This means that as of June 19, 2024, Kaspersky will no longer be able to provide support for any of its products or services in the U.S., and its executives are listed on the OFAC sanctions list. You may wish to heed Commerce’s recommendations if you hare in this position.",

Alternate between sliding it again and forth over the head and gently pulling it back and exposing the top for some targeted attention. You’ll be able to look round within the VR world, and move your head and body to work together with it. I can hold my very own. Similar to Dave (the founder) – he has in depth knowledge in various relationship, hookup web sites; as well as offline locations the place guys can have an excellent time.\n“He couldn’t have fallen off the rocks,” she declared firmly. Do you have any regrets? The one regrets I’ve is when i didn’t take some main auditions critically. Regardless of the preliminary reluctance because of her strict schooling, she determined to take an opportunity on a brand new profession path – which would in the end result in glory and fortune. I’m egotistical about my looks, but it’s your duty to take care of yourself. It was a big maddening at first, then pitiable, then funny, to see a lot (a lot) of very dumb motherfuckers on-line eulogizing this like it’s fucking shit 9/11. Too bizarre to live, too uncommon to die, like you’re talking about Bowie and having to acknowledge the period the place he was infamously on sufficient coke to kill an elephant and ebony sex no person informed him that sporting Hugo Boss was a foul idea.\nIn any other case it’s possible you’ll end up in certainly one of @Foone’s many Twitter Threads making fun of bad UI choices. In 1971, John and blowjob Lem Amero were making their newest film ‘Bacchanale‘, an bold, surreal fanstasy that was not like any sexploitation movie ever seen earlier than. Certain. I met him once i first moved out right here. I work out on a regular basis. I make collections, do surveillance work. This’ll make viewing your favourite videos simpler. I’ve a health video called, ‘Brooklyn Physique Blast’, which is a completely new concept in health movies.\nI don’t need you to inform me: Oh, however have you tried the curry? I’m going to Freddie’s Wild Card Gym in Hollywood, sometime to do mitts if I have time, or to spar if I’ve time, oftentimes simply to dangle out, and absorb the energy. Freddie’s a special individual. As a matter of reality, when everyone is long turned to dust, I’m nonetheless gonna be here. I’m telling you proper now, reduce to a hundred years from now, I’m still gonna be right here.\nI’m right here to remain, of us. I’m finishing a screenplay known as ‘Scar Tissue’, which is concerning the boxing coach, Freddy Roach, and his family. A big part of my life at present is boxing. Sexy busty Dani Dare is a lady of many skills but the one at the fore front immediately is her means to milk a cock till it explodes. What are doing with your self at present? “his appetites are attending to be more like a girl’s than a man”. In the long run it has no object, at any rate no real object; by means of real objects that are substitutes (and all of the extra numerous and interchangeable for that), it pursues an imaginary object (a ‘lost object’) which is its truest object, an object that has at all times been misplaced and is always desired as such.\nWho are you? In the primary place, a human being, which is to say, a being possessed of no higher faculty than free selection, with all of your other schools subordinate to it, alternative itself being unconfined and unbiased. I nonetheless do. I’m not one of these individuals who smokes and stares on the ceiling or watches Television. Folks don’t mess with me. I entertain people. I belong to the world. He has Parkinson’s illness but he nonetheless works, he has like a complete bunch of world champions.\nI give myself to the world. Lower the tape, and I’ll provide you with solutions. Or, if there’s an off-responsibility pursuit you love-giving tarot readings, sprucing beach rocks-it’s an ideal praise to say: “You ought to try this for cash.” Be a part of the eagerness economy, give the market last say on the value of your delights. I’ve sparred with Manny Pacquiao and other great fighters. I’ve been stabbed 3 times, I’ve been thrown out of transferring vehicles, I’ve had bottles broken up on my head, up the fucking shit yin yang.\nI’ve been smoking weed since I was fifteen. The fiesta absorbed even the Biarritz English so that you didn’t see them unless you handed near a desk. Only in class – if even there – does our mind briefly come to life. There was a moment’s silence. No matter it takes. I’m trusted. I’m identical to a permanent fixture on this planet.

    "text": "Вытянут счастливый лотерейный билетик: Василиса Володина назвала знаки Зодиака, которые сорвут жирный куш в лотерее с 25 июля\nСоцсети\nПо мнению астролога Василисы Володиной, лето 2025 года готовит значительные изменения для каждого знака Зодиака. Особое внимание она уделяет времени с 25 июля: этот период обещает стать судьбоносным и может коренным образом изменить привычный образ жизни многих людей. Володина настаивает на том, что не стоит бояться непредсказуемости — вторая половина лета будет особенно удачной для новых знакомств и романтических начинаний. Секрет счастья заключается в умении слушать свое сердце и быть открытым для чувств.\nТельцов, Львов и Козерогов ожидают самые приятные изменения.\nТелец:\nИюль станет для Тельцов временем неожиданных открытий и смелых шагов. Появится желание выделиться среди окружающих, но стоит помнить, что не все изменения могут быть восприняты друзьями и близкими с пониманием. В финансовых делах у Тельцов появятся новые возможности заработка, связанные с давними знакомствами и технологическими проектами. Август принесёт большую стабильность и новые шансы для внутреннего роста, однако, крупные начинания лучше отложить до середины месяца. Лучшее время для старта важных дел — 26 августа.\nЛев:\nИюль для Львов станет временем обновления круга знакомых: он может уменьшиться, но связи станут крепче и надёжнее. Не исключено появление друзей из других городов и стран. Важно в этот период проявлять тактичность, чтобы избежать конфликтов с влиятельными людьми. Август принесёт шанс на романтические знакомства, и астролог рекомендует внимательнее присматривать за своим окружением — любовь может оказаться совсем рядом. Также этот месяц подойдёт для укрепления семейных уз и создания уюта в доме.\nКозерог:\nОдиноким Козерогам стоит немного снизить рабочий темп и обратить внимание на личные отношения — судьба подсказывает, что время открыться новым связям пришло. В середине июля стоит заняться вопросами здоровья и общего самочувствия. Август обещает удачу тем, кто берётся за новые проекты: завершайте начатое и сосредоточьтесь на актуальных делах. Успех будет сопровождать в вопросах жилья, ремонта и карьерного роста. Новые интересные знакомства ближе к осени могут привести к серьёзным отношениям и верным друзьям.",

    "text": "[Skip to main content](#main) Barrie mayor uses Strong Mayor Powers for 1st time over controversial field Barrie Mayor Alex Nuttall is using his strong mayor powers for the first time in relation to one of the most contentious issues he's' faced during his nearly two years in office. On Thursday, the mayor issued a statement noting he is directing City staff to immediately pause work on the multi-purpose field along the waterfront near the General John Hayter Southshore Centre. Nuttall's use of his strong mayor powers - which have caused controversy in other municipalities over the past year - comes one day after a third-party report into the field provided the council with various new avenues to consider. The [strong mayor powers](https://www.ontario.ca/document/ontario-municipal-councillors-guide/10-strong-mayor-powers-and-duties) give mayors of large municipalities the ability to propose and pass bylaws with just one-third of councillors supporting them, veto bylaws altogether, and hire and fire department heads. Multi-purpose Field Investigation In June, Nuttall tasked long-time lawyer and community leader Marshall Green to investigate the recently approved multi-purpose field along Barrie's waterfront near the General John Hayter Southshore Community Centre. The proposal animated the community, with thousands both for and against it. The field's primary purpose is to serve as the new parading grounds for the Sea Cadets, who are currently facing safety and space concerns at their current location on Bayfield St. near the Barrie marina. It is also to be used by other minor sports teams in the City, with many advocates saying more sports fields are needed. Green released his public report on Wednesday after consulting with various stakeholders throughout the community. \"I think people were interpreting that it was farther down the road than it was,\" Green said on Wednesday. \"But I don't think anybody's opposed now to pausing and having to look at it again.\" Recommendations Green submitted seven different recommendations for council to consider: - The Sea Cadets get a small parading ground location in the proposed area with a hard surface as per their request. - The City not approve the multi-purpose sports field. - City staff work with sports groups to form a group to determine best uses of existing sports fields that the city plan properly in future subdivisions for parkland, and that city staff work with school boards to ensure access to their locations is provided. - The City develop current proposed location as a passive park with an educational component, zoning the lands as environmentally protected. - The Barrie Baycats move from Midhurst Stadium to Queen's Park in downtown Barrie. - The current Sea Cadets site become the future site of the planned performing arts centre. - The old Barrie Central Collegiate property, currently planned for a performing arts center, be freed up for a soccer stadium for the Simcoe County Rovers. Simcoe County Rovers Green also writes that the Simcoe County Rovers are set to make what he calls a 'game-changing announcement' regarding the team's future in the community. However, he says the club will need a soccer stadium with upwards of 2,500 seats in the coming years. Green's report was confirmed by Nuttall in his statement Thursday, saying the opportunity presented itself to the City in early July. \"The City is actively working with a global entity on a promising venture that could significantly enhance the future of sport tourism in Barrie,\" Nuttall wrote. However, the exact purchaser of the Rovers has not been released, with no firm date for when that announcement will be made. Development Paused As part of his unilateral direction, Nuttall said that work on the multi-purpose field is being paused to allow for further public consultation in light of Green's report, with that coming back to council in a staff report later this year. As part of his report, Marshall consulted with various local sports teams. While he heard from many of a need for more sports fields, he said many appeared to sour at the current approved plan along the waterfront. He said one group he did not name said playing by the waterfront would increase its exposure. However, he concluded that is not a strong enough justification for a project facing widespread opposition from the community. After his conversations, he writes he hopes that these sports groups can come together to leverage existing assets. \"It is my recommendation that these groups meet cooperatively and determine how these fields can be adapted for more than one sport,\" Green stated. \"The mayor indicated to me that in some cases, the school boards, who have large and often unused (after school hours) fields, have in some cases made it somewhat difficult for the various sports groups to use these fields. I find that both unfortunate and unacceptable,\" Green's report continued. Community Consultations Green also consulted with members of the arts community for his report. For years, the City has been working on bringing a new performing arts centre (PAC) to Barrie, with Green writing that the Five Points Theatre 'does not fit the needs of the community.' One of his suggestions is to scale down plans for a new performing arts centre, currently plotted on the grounds of the former Barrie Central Collegiate, and instead build that at the current location of the Sea Cadets, near the marina at the bottom of Bayfield Street. That would free up the old collegiate grounds for a sports field that the Simcoe County Rovers could use. \"The Rovers and their new partner were looking for a site where fans could grab a meal before or a snack and beverage after,\" the report reads. \"With the new condos, the PAC, a renewed Queen's Park and a professional soccer team in the vicinity, downtown Barrie should have just the shot in the arm that it has needed for years if not decades.\" While considering all of this downtown revitalization, Green spoke with leadership of the Barrie Baycats. The team currently plays at Vintage Throne Stadium in Springwater Township. Green writes that the City should prioritize safety concerns at Queen's Park downtown and says moving the Baycats there might help address those worries. \"Their games would be accessible by public transit,\" Green writes. \"They would be within walking distance of restaurants to enjoy before the games and pubs to celebrate at after the games.\" Green says he has learned a lot about the local arts and sports scene over the last two and a half months. \"Now the downtown has the potential to become a huge sports/performing arts magnet,\" Green noted towards the end of his report. Nuttall's use of the strong mayor powers is a first for him. The powers have been used sparingly by the 46 mayors who have access to them.
