    "text": "(Reuters) - Donald Trump urged Christians on Thursday to support him in the 2024 presidential election, a contest he depicted in religious terms and likened to the great battles of World War Two.\nSpeaking at a forum for Christian broadcasters in Nashville, the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination compared the stakes for the election to D-Day and the Battle of the Bulge and said God's involvement was needed to rescue the country.\n\"Today we are in another struggle for survival of our nation,\" Trump told the event organized by the National Religious Broadcasters association. \"This time the greatest threat is not from the outside of our country, I really believe this: it's from within.\"\n\"I am here today because I know that to achieve victory in this fight, just like in the battles of the past, we still need the hand of our Lord, and the grace of Almighty God.\"\nSince launching his campaign in late 2022, Trump has regularly painted the state of the country in apocalyptic terms, seeking to undermine President Joe Biden's support ahead of a likely rematch for the White House.\nAPPEALING TO CHRISTIAN BASE\nTrump has at times sought to portray the choice facing Americans in November as one of good versus evil, couching his rhetoric in language that appeals to the conservative Christian voters who form a core of his support base.\nConservative Christian voters credit Trump for a series of policy victories including the U.S. Supreme Court's decision overturning the constitutional right to abortion.\nThe thrice-married Trump has retained that support even as faces a criminal trial next month in New York that stems from alleged hush money paid to a porn star. It is one of four criminal prosecutions facing Trump, who has derided them all as politically motivated.\n\"I'm a very proud Christian, actually,\" Trump said. \"I've been very busy fighting and, you know, taking the bullets, taking the arrows. I'm taking them for you and I'm so honored to take them, you have no idea.\"\nCalling the prosecutors \"bad people,\" Trump attempted to create common cause with his audience by raising fears that the Biden administration was planning to go after Christians and their organizations - despite a lack of evidence to support such an assertion.\n\"Christians, they can't afford to sit on the sidelines in this fight,\" Trump said. \"The radical left is coming after all of us because they know that our allegiance is not to them. Our allegiance is to our country and our allegiance is to our creator.\"\nThe former president's appearance in the Tennessee capital is no coincidence. The state is one of many holding primaries and caucuses on \"Super Tuesday\" on March 5, the biggest day of nominating contests.\nTrump is far ahead of Nikki Haley, his sole challenger in the Republican race. He is favored by 30 percentage points in South Carolina's first-in-the-South primary on Saturday, according to the polling average maintained by website FiveThirtyEight.\nIn his speech, Trump referred to people imprisoned for the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol as \"hostages,\" repeating language he has used several times as a way to embrace his supporters involved in the riot.\n(Reporting by Nathan Layne in Charleston, South Carolina, and Tim Reid in Washington; Editing by William Mallard)\nBy Nathan Layne and Tim Reid\nShare © Reuters - 2024",

    "text": "Erosion of Cairo’s green space leaves residents exposed to searing heat CAIRO – Ahmed Belal’s Cairo apartment used to overlook a cluster of trees that provided a much-needed refuge from pollution in a bustling area of the Egyptian capital while helping take the edge off intense summer heat. But when a state drive to expand and widen main roads led to the uprooting of most of those trees in Greater Cairo’s upscale Mohandeseen district, he decided to pack his bags and moved in 2022 to the suburbs. “I sold my apartment … to have a little bit of peace of mind and some green areas that I hope they won’t go after,” the 39-year-old doctor said. Removal of green space in the capital and other cities became a topic of social media furore in recent weeks as temperatures soared, with many complaining that it was exacerbating the effects or climate change. Temperatures in Cairo hit up to 43 degrees Celsius early in the summer, while the southern city of Aswan saw a near-record temperature of more than 49 C on June 6, according to the Egyptian Meteorological Authority. In recent years, Egypt embarked on road construction projects it said would ease congestion in the traffic-clogged city and boost investment. But they also ate away at already sparse green spaces. While recent public data is scarce, the environment ministry said last year that the average per capita share of green space in the country is only 1.2 square metres, far behind the World Health Organisation’s recommendation of 9 square metres. Between 2017 and 2020, during the height of Egypt’s road-widening works, Cairo lost around 910,894 square metres of its already limited green areas, according to Alternative Policy Solutions, a public policy research project at the American University in Cairo. That loss risks exposing people to more life-threatening heat as climate change leads to more frequent heatwaves globally, and exacerbates the urban heat island effect, analysts say. “In densely populated cities where heat can become oppressive, the presence of parks, gardens, and other green areas can help lower local temperatures, making outdoor spaces more pleasant and usable,” said Sana Sherif, a Cairo-based environmental governance researcher and sociologist. “Without adequate shade and cooling areas, residents are more likely to suffer from heat-related illnesses.” Trapped heat Some trees and green space have been lost along the Nile, which runs through the heart of Cairo and provides almost all Egypt’s fresh water. On Dahab island, just south of the city centre, the widening of a ring road bridge has eroded agricultural lands, said Nabil Elhady of Cairo University, while a long concrete walkway is being constructed along the river’s banks. “Construction by default increases heat”, said Elhady. Egypt’s road projects are not the only cause for the removal of green space, critics say, with parks also partially removed in parts of Cairo to make way for shops and cafes. A spokesperson for Egypt’s environment ministry declined to answer questions about areas where green space was razed in the absence of construction works, referring reporters to public statements. Last month, Cairo’s governor Ibrahim Saber said in reaction to public criticism that no trees would be taken down unless a specialised committee examined whether they obstructed any projects. Egypt, which hosted the COP27 UN climate conference in 2022, also said it had a scheme to plant 100 million trees from 2022-2029 nationwide, adding that 3.1 million had already been planted. “Replacing trees that are deeply rooted with new trees is not that easy. You need a lot of money, workers, and maintenance,” said Asmaa al-Halwagy, a veteran environmental activist and the chair of the Tree Lovers Association, which was founded in the 1970s to combat the loss of green spaces in Egypt’s urban areas. “We keep hearing them say ‘we planted 50, 500, 3,000 or a million trees.’ Where are those trees?” ‘Green sprawl’ While Cairo’s densely populated areas bear the brunt of Egypt’s roadworks, green spaces are flourishing in residential compounds on the outskirts of the city, predominantly reserved for the well off. A new administrative capital east of Cairo, President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi’s flagship project, includes a 35km-long green river park. Researcher Sherif said “green sprawl,” or relocation of greenery to more affluent outskirts, had led to “a stark reduction in accessible green spaces for residents in the heart of the city,” adding to social inequalities. Cutting down trees deprives people of more than shade, said Halwagy, the activist. “Trees show the identity of any place. Today, places are devoid of identity or memory,” she said.",

While they stayed mum on their expanding family, Bailey previously opened up about her blossoming relationship with DDG, telling British Vogue in a 2022 [interview](https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/halle-bailey-british-vogue-interview) that “experiencing deep love for the first time in my life is something I feel has opened a whole new world for me creatively.” “I like all of the scary feelings that come with that. I like the suspense, the not knowing what’s going to happen, and I feel like that’s what I’m supposed to be going through in womanhood,” she added. This is Bailey and DDG’s first child together.
