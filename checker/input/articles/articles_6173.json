(WFSB/Gray News) - A firefighter who was plowing the snowy streets of Trumbull, Connecticut, jumped into action to rescue four people and three dogs when he happened upon a house fire. [WFSB](https://www.wfsb.com/2024/01/07/firefighter-plowing-route-notices-house-fire-rescues-people-pets/) reports Shaun Bogen’s quick actions were credited with saving the lives of the victims. The [Long Hill Fire Department said](https://www.facebook.com/longhillfd/posts/pfbid0uNJskTAvbNXazDW3ybvZ3mLqGGpdjbSUJLsFGQJZQHEJpVsSWnDyBrfeSmbCzbr3l) the house fire on Haviland Drive began just before 4 a.m. Sunday. While he was on the plowing route, Bogen discovered a house with a fire in the garage, according to the fire department. Bogen radioed into his base to alert them of the fire and called 911. Bogen then sprung into action, waking up the four sleeping residents and their three dogs and making sure everyone was outside before the fire department arrived. A total of 26 firefighters responded to the fire, and the first unit to arrive found the fire most heavy in the garage and extending into the home. The firefighters brought the fire under control in less than one hour. Officials said there did not appear to be any injuries. The cause of the fire remains under investigation.

    "text": "Vice President Kashim Shettima yesterday hinted on the federal government’s firm resolve to end the reign of terror in the South East region by those he described as self-serving criminals and certain persons taking advantage of the security situation to foster their dangerous political agenda. According to him, the president has been worried about the economic devastation inflicted on the South East geopolitical zone by non-state actors since he assumed office and is determined to deploy all available resources to eliminate the purveyors of falsehoods and propaganda that have become weapons against Nigeria’s unity. According to a statement by his spokesman, Stanley Nkwocha, Senator Shettima disclosed this in Bende, Abia State, during the unveiling of the Peace in South East Project (PISE-P) by the deputy speaker of the House of Representatives, Rt. Hon. Benjamin Okezie Kalu. Before the unveiling ceremony, President Tinubu was conferred with the traditional title of Omeziri Igbo 1 at the grand civic reception held in honour of the deputy speaker. Vice President Shettima who received the title on behalf of the president was also conferred with the traditional title of Enyioma Ndigbo by the chairman of Abia State Council of Traditional Rulers, Eze Linus Mbah. Delivering his speech titled; “Why We are all Umunna,” VP Shettima said, “His Excellency, President Bola Ahmed Tinubu is acutely aware that our commitment to Nigeria’s future remains incomplete as long as we grapple with the sinister operations of economic saboteurs who masquerade as advocates for the Ndi-Igbo. “That’s why he’s determined to utilise all available resources to ensure that the peace we’re establishing in this region is not cosmetic, and we can’t guarantee it unless all of us see through the falsehoods and propaganda that have become weapons against our unity.” Shettima noted that the gory activities of the criminals holding the South East captive were self-serving and do not in any way represent the interests of Ndi-Igbo and the entire country. He said the terror groups that have held the South East to ransom are not a creation of the people of the region, or of Nigerians from other parts of the country. “The problem we are here to solve as a community, as an Umunna, is a creation of self-serving criminals who do not represent the interests of the Ndi-Igbo and Nigerians. Mr. President knows this better than all of us, and that’s why he has never held any group accountable for the infractions of law-breaking individuals who identify as their members. This, I believe, is the democracy we have all chosen,” he stated. Pointing out that the criminals disrupting the peace in the South-East were doing so in connivance with “forces exploiting the situation for dangerous political agenda,” the vice president said attempts to undo the hard work of the nation’s heroes past will fail. He maintained however that the catastrophic situation can’t be reversed unless the government involves the people whom he said are the ears, legs and mouths in the region. He commended the deputy speaker of the House of Representatives and convener of the peace initiative, Hon. Kalu, for his efforts to restore lasting peace in the South East region, just as he said the event attested to the profound understanding that no one comprehends the experience of a community better than the people themselves. Earlier, Rt. Hon. Kalu said his goal for initiating the peace project was to foster peace, unity and development in the region. He said the project also aims at promoting reconciliation among communities and individuals affected by past conflicts. Abia State Governor, Alex Otti, said, “We the people of the South East hereby declare that peace is what we stand for as a region. “We declare peace and prosperity, we declare peace for progress, we stand for peace in the South East as a catalyst that will drive growth in all sectors of the economy and rekindle the confidence of future generations. We declare that peace is better.”",

    "title": "Disability and queer health in medical education — India under the lens - The Hindu",
    "text": "India’s National Medical Commission’s (NMC) alleged non-inclusion in its medical curriculum of disability and queer rights is at the forefront of a commentary piece, ‘One step forward, two steps back: urgent priorities to embed disability and queer health in medical education systems’ published online in The Lancet Regional Health — Southeast Asia. The authors point to this sustained and glaring absence, highlighting the need to introduce a holistic, inclusive medical syllabus.\nThe commentary also notes that on the global front, out of the 110 Lancet Commissions, aside from mental health and the Holocaust, there is no dedicated commission for disability or the queer community.\nNMC’s MBBS curriculum: Shouldn’t Indian medical graduates be sensitive to the LGBTQ and disabled communities, ask activists In India, the mandatory inclusion of disability rights as disability competencies in India’s new medical curriculum in 2019 was highlighted as one of the 17 lighthouse initiatives by United Nations India during the sustainable development goals (SDG) mid-point review. “Currently, queer affirmative and inclusive access to medical care remains a distant dream,’’ note the authors.\nA protest on ‘International Day of Persons with Disabilities’, in Kolkata.\nHampering human rights Explaining why the exclusion, both at the national and global level, will continue to hamper human rights one of the authors of the commentary, Satendra Singh from the Department of Physiology, University College of Medical Sciences & GTB Hospital, University of Delhi, said Lancet Commissions are science-led, international, and multidisciplinary collaborations aimed at achieving transformational change, with a particular focus on policy and political action. “Their evidence-based recommendations provide critical data to influence policymakers in revising health policies or improving practices. Currently, there are 1.2 billion young people aged 15 to 24 years, accounting for 16% of the global population. A similar proportion (16%) of people globally experience disability, with more individuals joining this group every year,’’ said Dr. Singh.\nIndia has among the highest number of road accident fatalities worldwide (as of 2022); additionally, it is recognised as the “diabetes capital of the world,” where complications such as gangrene, limb loss, and ocular conditions leading to blindness significantly contribute to disability.\nAlso historically, both the disability and transgender communities have experienced mistrust toward the medical establishment, said Dr. Singh, adding that these two groups share similar vulnerabilities, which contribute to health inequities and undermine the Agenda 2030 goal of “leaving no one behind.” He stated that things will only change when voices from these two communities are part of these Lancet Commissions; otherwise, it would remain mere lip service.\nIndia currently has the highest number of medical colleges in the world, producing future doctors and medical professionals. “Many of these graduates also represent the largest group of international medical professionals working in the USA and Canada. A compassionate medical graduate, well-versed in the health inequities faced by vulnerable groups, can play a crucial role in dismantling long-standing structural and attitudinal barriers,’’ they explain.\nAlso Read: ​Undoing the undoing: On the Competency-Based Medical Education Curriculum guidelines\nEducating future medics Co-author of the commentary Rohin Bhatt, who is also a human rights lawyer, argues that both of these groups have been marginalised in healthcare settings. “They have been at the brunt of discrimination and marginalisation in healthcare settings. So, when the doctors of tomorrow are educated, it is essential that they do not repeat the mistakes of their predecessors and ensure that disabled and queer patients are not deprived of the right to advocate for themselves, but also so that the doctors see these patients not as a collective of symptoms but as full humans in their own right,” he said.\nThe paper adds that to drive inclusion, it is important to recognise that amidst a variety of important factors that perpetuate social inequality, non-inclusive language is an area that warrants attention.\n“Prioritising inclusive language — clear, consistent, and respectful — recognises diversity. It shouldn’t be left solely to minorities to advocate for this but should be everyone’s responsibility, especially policymakers, whose words carry significant symbolic and material impact on the entire ecosystem. Recently, the Supreme Court of India launched a handbook debunking stereotypical disability language,’’ said the paper.\nAt the end of Pride Month, assessing the LGBTQIA+ communities’ rights: Data In India, the National Medical Commission — a statutory body that regulates medical education, professionals, institutions, and research, established in 2020 by the National Medical Commission Act, 2019, which replaced the Medical Council of India — in its preamble emphasises improving access to quality, affordable medical education, promoting equitable healthcare, encouraging community health perspectives, and enforcing high ethical standards in medical services that are flexible to adapt to changing needs.\n“The current circumstances in India are, however, not just a dereliction of the statutory duty of the NMC but also, arguably, an action that is ultra vires the parent legislation under which it was constituted and thus, ex facie illegal,’’ states the paper.\nIt adds that at the global level, the World Federation of Medical Education’s basic standards and the Agenda 2030 call to “leave no one behind” will remain unfulfilled unless stakeholders from these communities are positioned at the forefront of reforms in medical education.\nPublished - December 20, 2024 06:00 am IST\nRead Comments Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit READ LATER Remove SEE ALL PRINT",

    "title": "La primera mujer en caminar sobre la Luna vestir\\u00e1 Prada",
    "text": "En un evento que marcará la historia de la exploración espacial, la astronauta de la NASA Christina Koch se convertirá en la primera mujer en pisar la Luna. Pero no es sólo su destreza científica e histórica lo que llama la atención. Durante esta misión excepcional, Koch vestirá un traje espacial diseñado en colaboración con la famosa casa de moda italiana Prada. La primera mujer en ir a la Luna Christina Koch, ingeniera eléctrica y astronauta desde 2013, no es ajena a batir récords. Ya ostenta el título de la estancia más larga en el espacio para una mujer, con 328 días en órbita a bordo de la Estación Espacial Internacional. Pero esta nueva misión es parte de un marco aún mayor: el programa Artemis III de la NASA, cuyo objetivo es enviar humanos de regreso a la Luna por primera vez desde la misión Apolo 17 en 1972. Una alianza inesperada entre Prada y Axiom Space Para esta misión excepcional, el astronauta no vestirá un traje cualquiera… sino a la moda italiana. Ya que fue Prada quien fue la elegida para participar en el diseño de los trajes espaciales. La casa de moda se ha asociado con Axiom Space, una empresa especializada en tecnologías espaciales, para ayudar a crear la próxima generación de trajes de exploración, diseñados para afrontar los desafíos extremos de las condiciones lunares. A Prada, con su experiencia en materiales técnicos y precisión en el diseño, se le encomendó la tarea de mejorar tanto la funcionalidad como la comodidad de los trajes. Estos deben ser flexibles, duraderos y permitir una mayor movilidad al mismo tiempo que brindan la máxima protección contra las duras condiciones de la Luna, como temperaturas extremas, radiación solar y polvo abrasivo. La experiencia de Prada en el diseño de ropa de alto rendimiento se traduce en atención al detalle y el uso de textiles avanzados, una combinación de estética y tecnología. El director técnico de Prada, Lorenzo Bertelli, destacó que esta colaboración representa “un honor para la marca”, al tiempo que amplía “los límites de su experiencia en áreas aún inexploradas por la moda”. Un traje espacial inclusivo ¿El aspecto esencial de esta nueva generación de trajes de neopreno? Su diseño inclusivo, adaptado tanto al tipo de cuerpo femenino como masculino. Históricamente, los trajes espaciales han sido diseñados abrumadoramente para hombres, con muy pocas adaptaciones para mujeres astronautas. Hasta el punto de llevar a situaciones grotescas, como la cancelación en 2019 del primer paseo espacial 100% femenino, por falta de trajes adaptados a las tallas femeninas. Prada y Axiom Space, unidos para esta misión, trabajaron para solucionar este problema creando un traje capaz de adaptarse a diferentes tipos de cuerpo, al tiempo que proporciona la comodidad, movilidad y protección necesarias para misiones extremas. El hecho de que la primera mujer en caminar sobre la Luna pudiera hacerlo con un traje diseñado específicamente para las necesidades femeninas representa un progreso tangible en el reconocimiento de las distintas necesidades de las mujeres. Aunque quizás nos sorprenda que hayamos tenido que esperar hasta 2024 para finalmente investigarlo. Entre el escepticismo y la celebración Por supuesto, es imposible no percibir todo el aspecto “marketing” de la operación, ni preguntarse sobre la necesidad real de “dar glamour” a una exploración de la Luna realizada por primera vez por una mujer. La elección de Prada inevitablemente centra la atención en la casa de moda, desviando así la de la poseedora del récord Christina Koch. También surge la cuestión de la superficialidad del enfoque. ¿Los intereses mercantiles gozan de tal ubicuidad que una misión espacial se convierte en una oportunidad de promoción para una marca de moda? No obstante, destacaremos, cualquiera que sea el interés que hay detrás, el pequeño paso adelante para la igualdad de género en un campo donde las mujeres históricamente han estado subrepresentadas. Esta asociación también tiene el mérito de abrir nuevas posibilidades en el mundo de la alta costura, demostrando que moda e innovación tecnológica están lejos de ser incompatibles. Prueba de que industrias tradicionalmente distintas pueden colaborar para resolver problemas complejos y atreverse a desempeñarse donde menos se esperaba.
