    "text": "WOODINVILLE, Wash. — Eight students in Washington State University’s [Department of Viticulture and Enology](https://wine.wsu.edu/) (V&E) recently traveled from the Tri-Cities campus west across the Cascades to witness Woodinville’s flourishing wine scene.\nOpen to all viticulture and enology majors, the daylong expedition was a part of VE Connects, an initiative established by V&E Department Chair Jean Dodson Peterson and funded via the [V&E Experiential Learning Fund](https://foundation.wsu.edu/give/?fund=fb7ed1e1-30d5-4722-8266-e38d0266f98c&cat=idonate_colleges&area=idonate_agricultural_human_and_natural_resource_sciences&utm_source=Viticulture+%26+Enology&utm_medium=qr-code&utm_campaign=viticulture-enology-experiential-learning-fund-print-materials). The group’s itinerary included four stops that showcased different aspects of the region’s wine industry.\n“It was a fantastic day,” said Dodson Peterson, who led the field trip. “VE Connects is designed to foster a strong sense of community among our students while building meaningful connections between academia and the wine industry. While much of Washington’s grape production takes place on the east side of the state, this experience highlighted the thriving wine production and industry presence in western Washington.”\nLocated 25 miles north of Seattle and boasting more than 130 wineries, Woodinville has evolved into an industry mecca of sorts. For WSU transfer student Paul Cramer, the visit provided an eye-opening look at what goes on behind the scenes.\n“The trip was an exploration and extension of what we’re doing in class,” Cramer said. “It showed us the wine industry’s many specialties and demonstrated that this field has opportunities for thinking outside the box. It was refreshing to see how many chances there are to carve your own path.”\nThe students started the day by meeting Erica Orr, owner of an independent winemaking, consulting, and enology business.\n“We invited Erica because of her unique and innovative role in the industry,” Dodson Peterson said. “It’s inspiring for students to see someone who has built a successful career by pursuing a less traditional path.”\nThe group then toured a more traditional winery setting at Novelty Hill and Januik, two wineries that share a tasting room and winemaking space. Both also employ many WSU graduates.\n“We wanted to showcase Januik’s longstanding and deep-rooted connections within the industry,” Dodson Peterson said. “Their experience offers a valuable long-term perspective on the remarkable growth of Washington’s wine industry.”\nThe third stop was DeLille Cellars, a creator of Bordeaux-style blends that was founded in 1992.\n“We had a great discussion at DeLille,” Dodson Peterson said. “They shared insights into how they’ve designed their cellar to prioritize and support sustainable operations.”\nThe group wrapped up the day at Sparkman Cellars, where students had a chance to smell and taste some of the winery’s yeast trials and hear about other in-progress experiments.\n“Innovation is key to staying competitive in this industry, and effectively communicating those advancements to consumers is essential for long-term success,” Dodson Peterson said.\nFor Cramer, the trip illustrated how wine industry members in Woodinville consistently work together and support one another.\n“I was fascinated by the palpable sense of community that exists between these winemakers,” he said. “Instead of being competitive, they’re fortifying what’s existing and ensuring there’s a foundation for the industry going forward.”\nIn addition to providing a unique opportunity to learn outside the classroom, Cramer believes the Woodinville trip will help him prepare for a successful career in the wine industry.\n“As we visited the different venues, I found myself constantly attaching my wine science education to the hands-on perspective I was seeing,” he said. “The biggest thing I walked away with is the realization that I’ll have the confidence to say, ‘yes, I can do that,’ in any future job interview.”\nFuture VE Connects Trips:\nStudents will visit Red Mountain AVA and Walla Walla Valley AVA in spring 2025. More information to come.\nTravel expenses for this trip were made possible in part by donated funds. Help students attend future trips by donating to the [Viticulture & Enology Experiential Learning Fund](https://foundation.wsu.edu/give/?fund=fb7ed1e1-30d5-4722-8266-e38d0266f98c&cat=idonate_colleges&area=idonate_agricultural_human_and_natural_resource_sciences&utm_campaign=viticulture-enology-experiential-learning-fund).",

    "title": "Duxbury teen convicted after drowning father to exorcise ‘demon’ – NBC Boston",
    "text": "A Massachusetts man who was 19 years old when he drowned his father in a Duxbury pond has been convicted of involuntary manslaughter. Jack Callahan, now 22, told police in 2021 that he tried to exorcise a \"demon\" from his father, 57-year-old Scott Callahan, [by baptizing him at Island Creek Pond](https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/duxbury-19-year-old-charged-with-fathers-murder-due-in-court-tuesday/2417064/). The Plymouth County District Attorney's Office said Thursday Jack Callahan had been charged with murder, but that a jury found him guilty of involuntary manslaughter at the end of an eight-day trial. Prosecutors say Callahan's mother called 911 around 2 a.m. on June 28, 2021, reporting that her son was acting erratically. She told police that her ex-husband, the teen's father, was missing in the area of Island Creek Pond. Get Boston local news, weather forecasts, lifestyle and entertainment stories to your inbox. [Sign up for NBC Boston’s newsletters.] When police arrived at the home, they found the younger Callahan distraught and hyperventilating, authorities said. Police and fire crews responded to the pond to find Scott Callahan submerged. He was brought to Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital in Plymouth, where he was [pronounced dead](https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/man-hospitalized-after-being-pulled-from-duxbury-pond-condition-unknown/2416291/). Family members told NBC10 Boston at the time they were shocked and confused by the news. \"He's a good kid,\" said Callahan's uncle, Bill Hall Jr. \"He's smart, he's nice. He's not a violent person.\" Investigators determined that Jack Callahan had picked up his father in Boston, and they took a rideshare back to Duxbury, where the two were dropped off near the pond. Prosecutors say there was a physical altercation before the drowning. [The Boston Globe reported](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/06/29/metro/son-who-allegedly-murdered-his-father-duxbury-due-court-tuesday-morning/) that Scott Callahan had walked away from an alcohol abuse treatment center, and that his son picked him up at a Boston bar. According to the Globe, Jack Callahan said he was exorcising a demon named \"Dirty Dan,\" telling police he gave his father a choice to go to heaven or hell and explaining, \"I believe he chose hell.\" Callahan is due to be sentenced Friday, May 3.",

    "text": "In the agricultural sector, overhead expenses, although not linked to specific farm activities, are vital for smooth operations. Managing these expenses is a key component in ensuring farm profitability. Overhead costs include items like insurance, taxes, utilities, and salaries. Properly recording and scrutinizing these costs can reveal potential savings. The first step in overhead management is to calculate the total overhead. This enables farmers to allocate costs to various enterprises, either based on their contribution to revenue or the labor hours involved. For example, if livestock represents 50% of the farm’s labor, then half of the overhead should be allocated to it. Cost reduction can be pursued in several areas. Regularly comparing insurance rates can lead to better deals. Leveraging discounts on software subscriptions, prolonging the lifespan of equipment, and optimizing participation in trade shows through cost-sharing can all contribute to overhead savings. These cost-cutting measures may seem small, but when combined, they can substantially reduce overall expenses. For farms operating with minimal input costs, focusing on overhead offers an additional avenue for boosting profitability. Ultimately, in farming, the difference between revenue and expenses determines net profit. Efficient management of overhead costs is therefore essential for maintaining a healthy financial status in the agricultural industry.",

    "text": "Deepfake technology – the use of deep-learning artificial intelligence to create fake content online – creates a troubling portrait of consent in the digital age. A 2019 report by Sensity, a company that detects and monitors sexual deepfakes, found that 95% of all online deepfake videos are nonconsensual porn and 90% of those featured women. The Milstein Program in the College of Arts and Sciences, partnering with Cornell Cinema, will present [a free screening of the documentary “Another Body,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs3Wlf9BcEI) which focuses on the gendered implications of deepfake technology. The screening will be on Wednesday, February 7, at 7 p.m. at Cornell Cinema. This event is part of the [Science on Screens](https://scienceonscreen.org/) initiative, and will feature an introduction by Gili Vidan, assistant professor of information science in the Cornell Ann S. Bowers College of Computing and Information Science, as well as a post-show Q&A with one of the film’s directors. “Another Body” follows a college student's search for answers and justice after she discovers that the image of her face has been used without her consent in deepfake pornography. She joins with another student who has also been a target and they take the investigation into their own hands. \"I caught ‘Another Body’ at the Woodstock Film Festival, after its premiere at South by Southwest, and found it unforgettable – searing, urgent, and provocative,\" says Milstein Program director [Austin Bunn](https://pma.cornell.edu/austin-bunn), associate professor of performing & media arts. \"As deepfakes become increasingly commonplace, the film provides a look at the culture of the people behind them and asks why they do it. The answer is disturbing.\" Directors Sophie Compton and Reuban Hamlyn said that “we hope ‘Another Body’ will bolster efforts to rewrite the laws that govern the internet, and deepen people’s understanding of how online misogyny has very tangible impacts on our world.” This event is co-sponsored by the Departments of Science and Technology Studies and Performing and Media Arts (A&S).",

    "text": "Southern California added 21,700 real estate workers in the past year, a hiring pace faster than the overall job market.\nMy trusty spreadsheet found property-linked employment in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, and San Bernardino counties was 803,700 in November 2023. That’s off 1,200 for the month, but in pre-pandemic 2015-19, 2,020 jobs were cut on average in November.\nReal estate work grew locally by 21,700 positions over 12 months, or a 2.8% gain while all other industries added 115,300 – or a 1.6% gain.\nThe sector’s big employment niche, construction, added 300 workers in the month and was up 18,800 over 12 months, or a 5% gain. (Note that numerous people who work in the real estate world are self-employed and are not tracked by traditional government job counts.)\nProperty-related jobs were 9.8% of local employment in November 2023, but accounted for 15.8% of Southern California hires for the year. Since 2010, the end of the Great Recession, real-estate-linked jobs have equaled 9.7% of all Southern California jobs and 12.2% of local hiring.\nBy the slice Here’s how key real estate-related employment niches in Southern California fared …\nConstruction trade specialists: 266,400 employed by contractors – tying a post-Great-Recession high – after being flat for the month and up 13,700 over 12 months, or a 5.4% gain. Average November 2023 had 1,200 jobs lost.\nConstruction on buildings, civil projects: 125,800 workers in various trades – post Great Recession high – up 300 for the month and up 5,100 over 12 months, or a 4.2% gain. Average November 2023 had 460 jobs lost.\nLending: 102,600 folks in various slices of credit work – off 100 for the month and up 100 over 12 months, or a 0.1% gain. Average November 2023 had 100 job losses. This niche remains 14,800 jobs below pre-pandemic levels.\nReal estate services: 141,800 people handling transactions and leasing – up 300 for the month and off 500 over 12 months, or a 0.4% drop. Average November 2023 had 60 job losses.\nBuilding services: 114,500 jobs in commercial property operations – off 1,900 for the month and up 3,800 over 12 months, or a 3.4% gain. Average November 2023 had 140 job losses.\nSupplies: 52,600 sellers of equipment and materials – up 200 for the month and off 500 over 12 months, or a 0.9% drop. Average November 2023 had 60 job losses.\nGeographically speaking Here is the real estate employment breakdown, by metro area …\nLos Angeles County: Post-Great Recession high of 380,400 real estate jobs – up 1,400 for the month and up 9,800 over 12 months, or a 2.6% one-year gain. An average November in 2015-19 had 500 cuts. Property jobs equaled 8.1% of all LA workers last month.\nOrange County: 231,600 real estate jobs – off 100 for the month and up 3,300 over 12 months, or a 1.4% one-year gain. An average November in 2015-19 had 520 cuts. Property jobs equaled 13.3% of all OC workers last month.\nInland Empire: 191,700 real estate jobs – off 2,500 for the month and up 8,600 over 12 months, or a 4.7% one-year gain. An average November in 2015-19 had 1,000 cuts. Property jobs equaled 11.2% of all IE workers last month.\nJonathan Lansner is the business columnist for the Southern California News Group.
