    "title": "Some Positive ESG Trends Emerged in 2023",
    "text": "Environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing endured political controversies, regulatory scrutiny and tepid fund-level demand in 2023. But obituaries weren’t penned for ESG this year, nor should they have been.\nAfter all, exchange traded funds such as the (\nQQMG ) notched stellar showings this year. Those were helped in large part by growth stock leadership. Obviously, investing is a bottom-line endeavor and performance is what matters most at the end of the day. But some other positive ESG trends emerged this year. Some of those may be underappreciated with 2023 drawing to a close.\nFor example, data confirms that more U.S.-based companies, including QQMG member firms, are stepping up to the plate and making improved ESG reporting a priority. Those efforts could pave the way for broader adoption of ESG exchange traded funds.\nESG Reporting Trending in Right Direction\nIt could prove constructive that more corporations are making efforts on the ESG reporting front.\n“Despite challenges and the\nrecent ESG backlash, companies remain committed to the work of ESG and CSR. Recent data supports the continued relevance of ESG and CSR practices, underlying their critical role in risk mitigation and financial success. A June 2023 study from the Center for Audit Quality found that ESG reporting among the S&P 500 is now approximately 99%,” reported EHS Today.\nWhile QQMG’s methodology is clear and easy to understand, that’s a status not shared across the landscape of ESG ETFs. There’s also a lack of uniformity regard ESG ratings and reporting. Those factors are headwinds to broader ESG ETF adoption.\nFortunately, those scenarios are expected to improve as soon as next year. Plus, there are other emerging ESG tailwinds that could be supportive of funds such as QQMG. For example, data indicates more high-ranking executives view ESG as a value-add, while others see merit in committing to more ESG efforts.\n“Contrary to the narrative that companies are scaling back or abandoning ESG and CSR, most are continuing to prioritize progress towards their social impact goals. According to KPMG’s 2023 CEO Outlook report, 69% of CEOs have embedded ESG into their business as a means of value creation,” added EHS Today. “They also recognize that there is more work to do. 68% indicate that their current ESG progress is not yet strong enough to withstand the scrutiny of stakeholders and shareholders. But progress won’t continue if resources are not commensurate with the expected growth.”\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the\nETF Education Channel.",

    "text": "Nieves Concostrina: \"No hubo ningún San Valentín, es un cuento inventado por la Iglesia Católica\"\npor a publicado:\nLa historia oficiosa data del siglo III, en el que el emperador romano Marco Aurelio Claudio prohibió el matrimonio entre soldados. \"Hasta los mismos miembros de la multinacional católica lo descatalogaron en el 1969. No hubo ningún San Valentín. Fueron tres santos. Se lo han ido inventando. El Vaticano se encontró con tres al que llamaban San Valentín, ninguno documentado\". Esta festividad la inventó el cristianismo para sustituir las fiestas paganas por las suyas. \"El 15 de febrero se celebraban las lupercales.\n#laventana|\n#16ni la Navidad, que nada tiene que ver con Jesús, que como personaje histórico, con lo que ellos mismos cuentan, nacería como a finales de Marzo. Sus padre estaban censándose en Belén, y el censo era en marzo... Por eso pudieron quedarse a dormir en un portalón. Primero de abril, a lo sumo.\n#4Y San Juan, que existió pero no tiene nada que ver con la llegada del verano.\n#10y eso en sus ratos libres, su trabajo principal es vender nueces\n#5Claro que fueron tres santos, Sam Va Lentín!\n#8Dramatización:\n#2La Biblia está llena de personajes y lugares que nunca existieron de los que no hay ninguna constancia arqueológica, pero por política se toma como fuente \"histórica\" e \"historia\" de un pueblo. Como los personajes de Don Quijote, que son pura ficción aunque Cervantes se inspirara en algún conocido, o las historias que suceden en Macondo que cuenta la historia de ese pueblo pero aunque esos relatos tengan correlación con la historia politica de Colombia, Cien años de Soledad no deja de ser una novela y el libro de un genio universal.\n#7Luego esta Borges que es convertir las mates discretas y teoria de conjuntos en novela.\n#7No compares la literatura con la religión. Las novelas hacen poco o ningún mal. Sin embargo el creador de una religión, y todo lo que significa construirla, nunca podría ser considerado un genio, sino un vulgar psicópata.\n#15No es comparar literatura con religión, es quitarle a textos imaginarios como la Biblia su carácter histórico por motivos políticos.\n#17Mi madre cumple 75 años el 14 de febrero y siempre dice que cuando ella era pequeña no se decía nada de San Valentín por su cumpleaños, que es una moda que vino bastante después. Nada de religión. Es como el papa noel de rojo de Coca Cola.\n#17La Iglesia católica española tiene tantos santos y vírgenes que que roza el paganismo, y luego lo que se hace con ellos en semana santa ya es el esperpento.\n#18Estaba poniendo los chistes malos en bandeja y no los ha hecho nadie. En fin, es esto;\nes.wikipedia.org/wiki/Día_blanco\n#6Jose tenía más cuernos que el buey\n#6¿Que es el día blanco ? (En serio, no lo sé y tengo curiosidad).\n#18Tanta curiosidad no tendrás cuando no lo has buscado en Google como acabo de hacer yo ahora.\n[es.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Día_blanco](https://es.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Día_blanco)\n[Autentifícate si deseas escribir](https://www.meneame.net/login.php?return=%2Fstory%2Fnieves-concostrina-no-hubo-ningun-san-valentin-cuento-inventado%2Fc041)comentarios.

    "title": "Off-road drivers were swept away by river, says man who tried to save them | York Press",
    "text": "A man who tried to save three men trapped in a submerged 4×4 vehicle said they were “swept away” as they attempted to cross a river. Emergency services including police, ambulance and a helicopter attended a location on the River Esk near Glaisdale shortly before midday on Thursday. A 4×4 was recovered from the river by the fire service just after 3pm and three men found inside had died, North Yorkshire Police said. Chris Ford, who lives nearby, told the PA news agency the men were part of an off-roading group when they crossed a ford on Rake Lane. The river, swollen by heavy rain, swept them away and carried them around 400 yards downstream, he said. It came as Storm Gerrit caused flooding and travel chaos across the country throughout Wednesday and Thursday. Mr Ford, a firewood salesman, was called to the scene to help recover the vehicle with his tractor and found it fully submerged beneath the water, he said. He and two others used tractors to pull the 4×4 on to the riverbank, he said. Police said another man, who attempted to help those trapped in the car, was pulled from the river and needed medical treatment. Mr Ford told PA: “There was a ford they were going over and they were swept down 400 yards. “They were part of an off-road club. “I went down with my tractor. There was a couple of vehicles – one parked up. “You couldn’t see the (other) vehicle. It was 3ft beneath the water. “I helped get it out on to the riverbank with three other tractors.” Two other locals, Rosie and Andrew Dale, said they were with Mr Ford when he got the call to help. They said they saw several 4×4 vehicles pass their home in the direction of the ford shortly before the incident. Mrs Dale said “nobody local” would attempt to cross the ford in the current conditions. The area is popular with 4×4 drivers, she said, adding: “In the summer you get 10 of them at a time.” A spokesperson for North Yorkshire Police said: “Localised conditions across our area are making driving hazardous. “Roads are particularly badly affected around the River Esk, to the north of the county, as we have seen with the tragic incident near Glaisdale. “There was another incident at nearby Houlsyke at 12.49pm when a car got stuck in flood water and another at Kirby Wiske in Hambleton at 2.35pm. “Thankfully, the occupants of both vehicles were brought to safety. “The key advice is to consider whether your journey is necessary. “Please avoid driving through any kind of standing or moving flood water if you possibly can.” Witnesses to the incident at Glaisdale are urged to call North Yorkshire Police on 101, option 4, quoting reference NYP-28122023-0146.

    "title": "Erdogan offers to host Ukraine-Russia peace summit after meeting Zelenskiy",
    "text": "Turkey is ready to host a summit between Ukraine and Russia to end the war, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday after talks with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Istanbul.\nIn a meeting lasting about an hour, Erdogan and Zelenskiy discussed developments in the Ukraine-Russia war, shipping security in the Black Sea including the defunct grain deal, and defence industry cooperation, according to the two sides.\nNATO member Turkey supports Ukraine’s territorial integrity, but also maintains cordial relations with Russia, and regularly speaks with both sides in the conflict, notably as a sponsor of the Black Sea deal that lifted a de facto Russian blockade of Ukrainian grain exports.\n“We discussed developments about the war in detail today, I stated our observations with all my sincerity,” Erdogan said at a press conference alongside Zelenskiy, whose trip comes before an expected visit by Russian President Vladimir Putin following elections in Russia on March 15-17.\n“We are giving our utmost contribution for the war to end on the basis of negotiations. We are ready to host a peace summit that Russia will attend too,” he said, adding he had reiterated Ankara’s support for Ukraine’s sovereignty.\nTurkey had hosted peace talks between Russia and Ukraine in 2022, but has since complained that no diplomatic step has been taken to advance these discussions. It has repeatedly offered to host further talks, saying a summit of leaders was needed.\nZelenskiy said Russia would not be invited to the first peace summit due to be held in Switzerland in the coming months, but that a Russian representative could be invited to the next meeting after a roadmap for peace had been agreed upon with Ukrainian allies.\n“We do not see any representatives of Russia at this summit. We don’t see how you can invite people who block, destroy, and kill everything. We want to get a result – a just peace,” he said.\nLast week, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said after meeting Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov that it was time for Ukraine and Russia to start ceasefire talks, but added that this must not mean the recognition of Russia’s occupation.\nDEFENCE INDUSTRY COOPERATION\nTurkey has provided Ukraine with armed drones and also inked an agreement for their joint production at a factory near Kyiv, but progress has been hindered by the war. It has provided Kyiv with other forms of military support, but opposes the Western sanctions on Russia.\nAfter arriving on Friday, Zelenskiy visited a shipyard near Istanbul to inspect construction work on two corvettes for the Ukrainian navy. He later said he had discussed the joint production of some arms and ammunition with Erdogan.\n“Today, we have reached agreements on joint defence projects both at the government level and between companies,” he said on the social media platform X after meeting Erdogan.\n“I met with the Turkish defence industry representatives. We are prepared to move quickly to put everything we discussed into action,” he added, without elaborating.\nTalks also touched on the Black Sea grain deal, which was brokered by Turkey and United Nations and allowed Ukraine to safely export grain from its ports. Ankara has pushed to revive it, but Russia, which said its requests for better terms for its own food and fuel exports were ignored, has said it is not interested.\nAs part of its balancing act, Turkey maintains its defence industry ties with Ukraine while deepening energy cooperation with Russia. It also inked an accord to take part in the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine.\nReuters exclusively reported last month that a U.S. threat to hit financial firms doing business with Russia with sanctions had chilled Turkish-Russian trade, disrupting or slowing some payments for both imported oil and Turkish exports\n ",
