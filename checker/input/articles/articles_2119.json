    "text": "Adrian Autry has now filled the vacancy on his coaching staff since the departure of Gerry McNamara to Siena on March 29.\nSU athletics Thursday officially announced the hiring of former Mt. Saint Mary's coach Dan Engelstad as an assistant coach, after serving six years at the school.\nRAPID REACTION Advertisement The luring of Engelstad away from his head coaching position at Mount St. Mary's, clearly signifies the direction that Autry wanted to go with his second coaching hire out of the program in as many seasons.\nBring aboard an established head coach (11 seasons combined at Southern Vermont/MSM) who has handled all the various nuances of running an organization administratively, sports a solid record of player development and a couple of quick season turnarounds, and will stimulate Autry's thinking as the staff evolves and establishes new offensive and defensive strategies into the program.\nThe latter trait is important in the new world order of so many players transferring after one season (along with traditional scholastic recruiting). Their goal is to fit into a winning program that not only satisfies NIL opportunities, but features a playing style that best suits (and showcases) their individual game.\nOh, and Engelstad's hiring also may come with the added benefit of a talent infusion to the depleted Orange roster. All-MAAC first team selection Dakota Leffew is in the portal after four seasons at 'The Mount', and has listed SU among his final six schools on social media this month, He could potentially step right into the SU backcourt to become a dangerous 3-point threat (37% / 18ppg last season).\nThrow in Englestad's recruiting connections that date back decades in not only the Washington, D.C. region but the entire east coast, and his seasoned experience and voice will bring a new balance to the Syracuse basketball coaching staff in helping achieve its goal of a return to the NCAA Tournament next season.\n----\nChat about this story and all things Syracuse and Syracuse recruiting on our premium message board, Cuse Classified !\nFollow us on Twitter @ TheJuiceOnline , like us on Facebook , follow us on Instagram @SUJuiceOnline and listen to our podcast .\nTips/questions/concerns?

    "text": "General News of Thursday, 28 December 2023\nSource:\n[www.ghanaweb.com](/GhanaHomePage/aboutus.php)\nOn December 27, 2023, the fourth Chairman of The Church of Pentecost, Apostle Dr Michael Nutmy passed away at the age of 65.\nHaving commenced his apostolic journey at a young age, Ntumy lived a dedicated life towards the propagation of Christianity and The Church of Pentecost.\nHe was born at Dadieso in the Oti Region of Ghana and begun his professional life as a teacher in Yendi in the 1980s before becoming a deacon, and an elder of the church.\nHe was called to office as an apostle at the age of 33 and begin a journey of traversing various parts of the country and the world to spread the gospel.\nAs part of his apostolic journey, Dr Ntumy faced various trials in tribulations including wars, sicknesses and accidents that bore testament to his unflinching commitment towards the work of Ghana.\nOne of such experiences the apostle had was during the Liberian Civil of 1989 to 1997.\nApostle Nutmy who was a pastor in the Buchanan District of Liberia during the time of war became a source of motivation for several Liberians and members of the Buchanan community which was predominantly a Ghanaian community.\nIn the heat of the war, Apostle Ntumy was taken captive together with his family by the National Patriotic Front Party of Charles Taylor.\nThe apostle, his wife and children were held in the heart of the Nimba Forest where he was assaulted and poisoned.\nDespite his ordeal, a resilient Apostle Ntumy continued to be a source of encouragement for other hostages including members of his church.\nTestimonies of Apostle Ntumy’s resilience during the period was shared by members of the Buchanan District Church of Pentecost in 2022.\nElder John Baidoo, presiding elder at the now Prayer Tower Assembly, the central chapel of the Buchanan district, where Apostle Ntumy used to fellowship, testified about the impact Apostle Ntumy had on the members of the church in the district.\n“According to the elders I met, Apostle Ntumy laid his life down for most of the members here. He [Apostle Ntumy] came back three years ago and encouraged us.\n“I remember the sermon he preached: ‘When I saw him I held fast to him but I now leave him.’ That sermon brought revival to the church here in Liberia. The sermon topic is now on everyone’s lips. Our father’s presence in Buchanan has really lifted the church high.”\nA community leader amongst the fisherfolks and an elder of the church, Elder Joseph Kwame Persewaa also said: “If Apostle Ntumy was with us here now, we would have carried him up high on our shoulders. This is because spiritually he really worked. It is because of Apostle Ntumy’s works that we had confidence and courage to remain in the church. His lifestyle drew many to the church.”\nHe added: “I was present at Flamingo (the camp of no return) during the war when Apostle Ntumy prophesied that no one would die, and indeed non-members of The Church of Pentecost saw the hand and power of God and got converted.”\nThe Area Head for Buchanan Area and National Secretary of the Church in Liberia, Apostle Quie G. Toe, was full of praise for Apostle Ntumy. According to him, the successes and achievements of the Area were a result of the selfless leadership of Apostle Ntumy during his days in Liberia.\n“Before every fishing season, Apostle Ntumy would gather members of the church who are fisherfolks and pray with them. This led to the introduction of a prayer and fasting programme that helped the fisherfolks to experience bumper harvests.\n“This prayer programme has come to stay. The leadership of the church supports the Ghanaian fisherfolks to organise this prayer programme at the beginning of every fishing season,” he added.\nThroughout his apostolic career, the late Apostle Ntumy served as the Missionary of The Church of Pentecost to Liberia, Ivory Coast, France/Switzerland, from 1988-1998.\nHis tenure as chairperson of the church commenced in 1998 and ended in 2008 after two terms (ten years).\nOn his 54th birthday, Apostle Ntumy wrote an article in which talked about all the trials he had been through and how and how his faith in the lord saved him\nRead the article written by Apostle Ntumy on his 54th birthday\nAs I ponder and reflect over the course of my life so far, I realize the exceptional grace God has bestowed on me. I am not going to talk about promotion, position, power, achievements and accomplishments. I am going to share with you about troubles, trials and tears, interlaced with amazing triumphs and testimonies resulting in thanksgiving to God. The enemy of our souls forgets that his orchestrations against us rather result to the praise of God in the long run.\nIn fact, Apostle Paul said that if he had to boast, he would rather boast about his sufferings for the sake of Christ. My catalogue, however, does not come anywhere near that of Apostles.\n1. Been through four wars (Two in Northern Ghana, one each in Liberia and Ivory Coast) Charles Gangay Taylor, Leader of Liberia’s NPFL\n2. Taken hostage for 163 days in the heart of the Nimba Forest in Liberia by Charles Taylor’s NPFL rebels while serving as missionary in that country\n3. Survived three accidents— two on the road, one on the Volta Lake in Ghana. A Vessel On The Volta Lake\nSurely if my life were in my own hands, I would have lost it long ago.\n4. Survived an assassination attempt on my life while serving as the youngest-ever Chairman of The Church of Pentecost.\n5. Survived two food poisoning attempts against me\n6. Tasted hospitalization for 332 days in 2009/2010\n7. Tasting the pains and agonies of paralysis for 1,211 days (to date), moving about in an electric wheelchair.\nHowever, there is an INVISIBLE HAND THAT HOLDS, SUSTAINS and NOURISHES US. THROUGH IT ALL, being kept by THE POWER OF GOD.\nCome, beloved, praise the LORD with me.\nTHANK GOD FOR THE GIFT OF MY LIFE. He has upheld me very tenaciously through it all.Crushed, but not destroyed.\nStand with me in prayer as I go through this phase of my life, doing business for the Kingdom of God even through this “out of season” period.\nBelieve with me that the expected miracle shall take place soon for His glory.\nAll these could not have happened for nought. God is definitely up to something.\nGA/SARA",

    "text": "Ein Sieg im Doppel, ein Sieg im Einzel: Das Comeback von Venus Williams nach mehr als einem Jahr ohne Turnier-Einsatz läuft bislang reibungslos. Nun kann sie bereits mit dem nächsten Auftritt planen.\nStand: 24.07.2025, 05:37 Uhr\nNach ihrem erfolgreichen Comeback auf der WTA-Tour kann Venus Williams schon mit der nächsten Turnier-Teilnahme planen. Die 45 Jahre alte ehemalige Weltranglistenerste bekommt für die Cincinnati Open im August eine Wildcard. Dort hatte sie 2023 ihr letztes Einzel-Match gewonnen - bis sie am Dienstag bei den DC Open in Washington bei ihrem ersten Turnier nach 16 Monaten Pause Peyton Stearns 6:3, 6:4 besiegte. Tags zuvor hatte sie bereits im Doppel gewonnen und ihr Comeback auf der WTA-Tour gegeben.\nWilliams, die ältere Schwester von Serena Williams, war vor einem Jahr an der Gebärmutter operiert worden. Nur eine Spielerin war bei einem Sieg auf der WTA-Tour jemals älter als sie, Martina Navratilova gewann 2004 im Alter von 47 Jahren. „Es gibt keine Grenzen für Exzellenz. Es geht darum, was in deinem Kopf vorgeht und wie viel du investieren kannst“, sagte Williams nach ihrem Erstrundensieg. „Wenn du mental, physisch und emotional arbeitest, kannst du Resultate liefern. Es geht nicht darum, wie oft du hinfällst. Es geht nicht darum, wie oft du krank oder verletzt bist. Wenn du daran glaubst und arbeitest, gibt es eine Chance.“\nBlick schon auf US Open gerichtet In Washington trifft Williams nun auf die an Nummer fünf gesetzte Polin Magdalena Frech. Für die US Open im August hat sie mit ihrem Landsmann Reilly Opelka zumindest für das Mixed-Turnier gemeldet und liebäugelte zuletzt auch mit einem möglichen Start im Einzel, für den sie ebenfalls eine Wildcard benötigen würde.\n© dpa-infocom, dpa:250724-930-833227/1\nDas ist eine Nachricht direkt aus dem dpa-Newskanal.\nZur Startseite\nshowPaywall: false isSubscriber: false isPaid:\nper E-Mail teilen\nauf Facebook teilen\nauf Twitter teilen\nper WhatsApp teilen\nauf Pocket teilen\nper E-Mail teilen Ausblenden",

    "text": "Massive California waves injure onlookers, bring flooding and treacherous beach conditions to West Coast\nDec 29, 2023, 6:14 AM\n(Brian van der Brug/Los Angeles Times/Getty Images)\nLOS ANGELES (CNN) — A powerful offshore storm is\ndriving towering waves into the California coastline, triggering flooding and warnings of dangerous and damaging swells after several people were injured by a wave along Ventura Beach on Thursday.\nThe wave crashed over a barrier along the southern California beach, tossing a wall of fast-moving water at a group of onlookers who rushed to escape the deluge, witness video shows. Seawater quickly knocked some people off their feet and pummeled cars as drivers tried to speed away.\nNearly 20 people were briefly swept away in the incident and eight people were taken to the hospital, Ventura officials said.\n[#HighSurf]– Watch when a rogue wave hits the beach at the end of Seward Ave in the City of Ventura. This occurred during the high surf advisory at high tide. Because of this wave eight people were transported to local hospitals. Currently the beaches are closed in Ventura County… [pic.twitter.com/VlRlgRLhpn]\n— VCFD PIO (@VCFD_PIO)\n[December 29, 2023]\nHigh water and dangerous rip currents will churn along some of California’s beaches through the weekend as much of the West coast – spanning from the U.S.-Mexico border to southern Oregon – is under coastal flood and high-surf alerts, the National Weather Service said.\nWaves as high as telephone poles – about 40 feet – could slam into San Francisco through Friday morning. Fifteen to 20-foot waves are expected along the central coast.\nThe dangerous conditions pose an “exceptional risk” of ocean drowning and damage to structures like piers and jetties, the National Weather Service said.\nThe spectacular waters have enthralled some surfers and onlookers, but weather officials are cautioning that the waves and strong rip tides can be perilous for those nearby.\n“Large breaking waves can cause injury, wash people off beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats near shore,” the National Weather Service warned.\nAt least one fisherman fell overboard in a harbor off Oxnard and later came ashore uninjured, the Ventura County Fire Department said.\nThe conditions have already caused some road closures and evacuations in coastal California communities and prompted the rescue of five campers along the San Luis Obispo coast.\nCrews in Ventura worked through the night to reinforce a mile-long sand barrier that was damaged by powerful waters on Thursday, the local fire department said. Standing about seven feet tall, the raised wall helps protect beachside communities.\n🚨 Due to a high tidal surge, numerous closures are in place today. Pls exercise extreme caution near the ocean and stay safe. Here are some views from the Rio Del Mar Esplanade and Seacliff St. Beach. Remember to respect the closures and avoid these areas for your own safety.\n[pic.twitter.com/KpNHy4MNC5]\n— CHP Santa Cruz (@CHPscrz)\n[December 28, 2023]\nHoping to discourage spectators, local officials closed a main access point to Ventura Pier, which saw a swell of about 20 feet on Thursday. Some coastal streets in the area have also been closed as a precaution.\nIn central California’s Santa Cruz, the sheriff’s office\nissued an evacuation warning for some areas on Thursday, which included areas of Rio Del Mar, where seawater filled beachside roadways and pushed against some homes, CNN affiliate KION reported. The warnings were lifted later in the day.\nThe most extreme impacts were expected along the central and Ventura County coasts, along with Hermosa, Manhattan and Palos Verdes beaches, the weather service in Los Angeles said Thursday.\nTempestuous waters are also battering Northern California, where the Bay Area could see waves of 28 to 33 feet, the weather service advised.\nA high wind alert is also in effect for the Bay Area on Friday as wind gusts of up to 50 mph are expected.\nRainfall is likely to stretch northward from the Bay Area throughout the day Friday before shifting south into the weekend.\nMassive waves attract surfers to Mavericks\nDespite safety warnings, the massive waves are a welcome sight to surfers hungry to tackle the legendary swells at Mavericks Beach, about 25 miles south of San Francisco.\nPro surfers and spectators flocked to the beach on Thursday for a competition at the site known for having\nsome of the biggest waves in the world, CNN affiliate KGO reported.\nLocal resident Ion Banner\ntold the affiliate that surfers from Brazil, Tahiti and Hawaii were out in the water. “It’s pretty gnarly, it’s super big,” he said.\n“The waves looked absolutely massive and it was everything that we expected,” said Miguel Blanco, who told KGO he flew in from Portugal to surf the waves. “It was really big, I’d say 40-60 foot waves.”\nMavericks’ jaw-dropping waves – caused by unique underwater rock formations – reach their biggest heights in the winter, when big wave surfers from all over the world make pilgrimages to face the swells.\nThe legendary waves and the surfers who brave them have been the subject of several films and documentaries, including the 2012 biopic “Chasing Mavericks” about American surfer Jay Moriarity’s journey to surf Mavericks as a teen.\nOn Thursday, the conditions were prime for surfers like Blanco.\n“If it’s your turn, you just gotta go,” Blanco said. “When you see a big wave, you’re kinda scared but at the same time you’re feeling like you should go and you just go and enjoy the ride.”\nCNN’s David Williams contributed to this report.",

    "title": "Ski Resort’s Plan to Build Massive Statue of Virgin Mary Draws Criticism",
    "text": "Mt. Shasta Ski Park in McCloud, California, is facing criticism after it unveiled plans to build a 20-foot statue of the Virgin Mary on its site. The resort made the announcement on\nThe announcement, however, did not sit well with some locals in the area, with some starting a\npetition to stop the building of the Statue. To date, the petition has garnered nearly 2,500 signatures. Noting that the resort has served as a beloved gathering spot for the community where children have learned to ski, the petition stated that the religious Statue would alienate non-Christian members of the community. “The religious icon currently under construction threatens to alienate members of our diverse community who do not share the same religious beliefs. Local gathering places, whether private or not, should remain neutral spaces that promote inclusivity and respect for all visitors,” it affirmed. The petition also objected to the Statue being built on what it called “one of the most beautiful natural vistas at the top of Douglas.” It warned that the Statue would become an “intrusive religious icon.” The petition then suggested that the money for the project would be better spent on a community need such as a homeless shelter or detox facility.\nAnother criticism aimed at the resort claimed the move was disrespectful of the area’s Native American heritage. “Given the deep Native American history to that area and the long mysterious Lemurian beliefs, it would be a shame to add this Statue!! If you want a Christian remembrance for your late husband, place a plaque at the lodge,” said one commenter on\nFox News, the resort called the criticism “hateful.” “In response to the negative reactions to the Virgin Mary project, it is just disappointing to see folks being so hateful about how our owner, Robin Merlo, has chosen to honor her late husband,” the resort wrote. After noting that it had heard from numerous people who support the project, it also emphasized its status as a private business. “I would also like to clarify that Ski Park is 100% privately owned and operated. We do have a use permit with the Forest Service, but that pertains to the lower parking areas and is separate from the location of Statue. We look forward to completing the project early this summer.”",
