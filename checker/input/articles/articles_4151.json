    "title": "Watch: A Historic Day of Surfing in San Diego",
    "text": "Last week, New Jersey saw the \"day of days\" thanks to a bomb cyclone in the Atlantic. Yesterday, San Diego got its turn with El Nino, and photographer/filmer Jimmy Wilson posted up at this rare SD slab to document a truly historic session. \"I’m pretty dang happy right now,\" writes Wilson about the day. \"Today was by far the best session I’ve ever witnessed in San Diego. As you will see, it’s not the most organized or easy wave to read, but the potential for a session of this level has been in the making for a long time. \"I want to send a huge thank you to Damien Hobgood who I’ve been shooting photos of here for nearly a decade. He used to paddle out in psycho conditions where no one thought it was possible, and it was borderline most of those days. His wave from the last El Niño in 2016 was seriously historic (Watch Surfing Magazine’s video: Just Up The Coast) and the same angle I shot that photo, is what I chose to film from today. He also helped babysit my daughter Koura this morning so I could shoot, and then helped line up our friend Kevin to continue babysitting all our kids when he paddled out. \"I also want to thank Skip McCullough. La Jolla local and a core icon! You can tell he was waiting for the stars to align to show what he can do out there. Amazing performance. Someone pay this man! \"What was originally supposed to be a short window of me filming this morning turned into 7:15am-3pm on the sticks, zero food or water, dodging parking tickets, editing until the late hours of the next morning, and about to drive straight to Mammoth with my daughter and girlfriend on no sleep, just pure passion!\" Go ahead and click play. Unless you're the goofy that went right on the left of the day (see below). Then you might not want to watch this. *** Don't miss another headline from SURFER!

    "text": "After bouts of wild weather over Christmas, the east coast will face another round of severe thunderstorms and rain according to the Bureau of Meteorology's (BoM) latest forecast. Severe thunderstorms have eased across eastern Australia but are expected to redevelop around eastern Queensland and northeast NSW from December 30 into the New Year. Parts of Australia are set to face wet and potentially wild weather on New Years Eve and New Year's Day. BoM senior meteorologist Sarah Scully said isolated thunderstorms are possible for parts of Queensland, NSW, Victoria and South Australia. \"Severe thunderstorms are possible in Queensland between St Lawrence and Redcliffe, although activity will not be as widespread compared to previous days,\" Ms Scully said. \"Isolated gusty thunderstorms are also possible over western South Australia.\" Showers and storms are possible across parts of southern and eastern Australia, mainly NSW, eastern South Australia, and northern Victoria on December 29. There is a risk of severe thunderstorms in Sydney, the Blue Mountains and the Hunter regions. Severe thunderstorms will become more widespread from this weekend concentrating in north-east NSW, and south-east and central Queensland. BoM said there are indications that isolated, very dangerous thunderstorms with destructive winds, giant hail and intense rainfall may be possible across southeast Queensland on Saturday. BoM has encouraged the community to stay up to date with the latest forecasts and warnings using the BOM Weather app and website. Queensland will also experience heatwave conditions along the east coast affecting Brisbane, the Sunshine Coast and areas surrounding Cairns. Northern and Western Australia will also face heatwave conditions with temperatures reaching the mid to high 40 degree Celsius in some areas. Sign up for our newsletter to stay up to date.

    "text": "A avaliação positiva do governo do presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva aumentou em quatro meses e passou de 33%, registrado em março, para 37%, segundo pesquisa Ipec divulgada na quinta-feira (11). A avaliação negativa do governo oscilou dos 32% para 31%. Dos entrevistados, 31% consideram a gestão Lula regular.\nA avaliação positiva corresponde aos eleitores que consideram a gestão ótima ou boa. Já a negativa é dos entrevistados que avaliam como ruim ou péssima.\nA pesquisa mostra uma melhora na imagem do governo. Desde setembro de 2023, a avaliação positiva estava em queda: naquele mês, 40% avaliavam a gestão como ótima ou boa. Essa fatia do eleitorado foi para 38% em dezembro, caiu para 33% em março e agora, chegou a 37% — mesmo percentual registrado em junho de 2023.\nA melhor percepção sobre o governo Lula, com os maiores percentuais de ótimo e bom, está entre aqueles que vivem na região Nordeste (53% de ótimo/bom), entre as pessoas que estudaram até o ensino fundamental (48%) e com renda de até um salário mínimo (48%). A avaliação é melhor entre mulheres (38%), entre pretos e pardos (40%) e entre os católicos (44%).\nJá a avaliação da gestão entre os evangélicos continua enfrentando dificuldades. A parcela desse eleitorado que tem uma percepção negativa sobre o governo é maior do que evangélicos com uma percepção positiva: 39% consideram o governo ruim ou péssimo e 27% avaliam como ótimo ou bom.\nDe acordo com a pesquisa Ipec, 50% dos entrevistados aprovam a gestão Lula (em março eram 49%) e 44% desaprovam (eram 45%). Em relação à confiança, 51% disseram não confiar no presidente Lula e 46% afirmaram que confiam no petista.\nA pesquisa tem margem de erro de dois pontos percentuais, para mais ou para menos, e o nível de confiança é de 95%. O instituto ouviu 2 mil pessoas em 129 municípios do país entre os dias 4 e 8 de julho.\nO resultado da pesquisa do Ipec vai na mesma linha do que foi registrado pelo\nlevantamento da Genial/Quaest divulgado nessa quarta-feira.\nHouve um aumento da avaliação do governo como ótimo ou bom: em maio eram 33% e agora, 36%. A avaliação da gestão como ruim ou péssima foi de 33% para 30%. A percepção regular oscilou de 31% para 30%. A margem de erro da pesquisa Genial/Quaest é de dois pontos percentuais, para mais ou para menos. De acordo com o levantamento divulgado ontem, 54% aprovam o governo Lula e 43% desaprovam.\nMais recente Próxima Lira pede para grupo de trabalho liberar parecer sobre comitê gestor no início de agosto",

In one incident, students openly discussed the antisemitic conspiracy theories Kanye West has spewed and circulated an image of a s in a campus dining hall.\nAdditionally, the lawsuit recounts an episode where a student encountered three student-athletes using the phrase “Jew someone down” as a derogatory term, further illustrating the casual antisemitism that permeates the campus environment.\nThe lawsuit claims faculty and students have openly praised the violent actions of Hamas , referring to them as “astounding” and “awesome,” in a clear display of support for acts of violence and terrorism.\nFurthermore, the campuses have witnessed marches where hundreds of pro-Hamas students and faculty chanted deeply antisemitic slogans, calling for violence against Jews and promoting genocide.\nThese actions have not only been allowed to occur but have gone largely unaddressed by the university administration, contributing to an atmosphere of fear and exclusion for Jewish and Israeli students.\nThe lawsuit accuses the institutions of not enforcing their policies against discrimination, failing to condemn acts of antisemitism effectively, and neglecting to take disciplinary action against those who engage in such behavior.\nThis, according to the complaint, has allowed a culture of antisemitism to thrive, significantly hindering Jewish and Israeli students’ ability to participate fully in campus life.\nThe students are seeking a range of remedies from Columbia University and Barnard College, including the implementation of comprehensive measures to combat antisemitism on campus, disciplinary action against those who perpetuate antisemitic acts, and the development of educational programs aimed at raising awareness about antisemitism.\nAdditionally, the lawsuit calls for the universities to ensure the safety and inclusion of Jewish and Israeli students by enforcing Title VI of the Civil Rights Act and to provide compensation for the harm caused by the hostile environment.\nShare AllHipHop | Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) More Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)\nPosted in News Tagged Hip-Hop News , Kanye West , YE",

En él somos testigos del momento de la espectacular explosión de un local, que ocurre tan solo unos segundos después de que los bomberos se decidieran a salir de él.\nSe trata de una tienda de repuestos de automóviles que acaba de saltar por los aires. \"Las imágenes fueron grabadas desde el vehículo del jefe del batallón\", informa el presentador.\nMaría Moya destaca que una de las tareas fundamentales de estos cuerpos de seguridad es detectar cuándo es necesario salir de los edificios en este tipo de situaciones. \"En unas circunstancias en las que a veces hay fuego, humo y no lo pueden ver, se salvan la vida así\", dice señalando a la pantalla.\n(*) Disfruta de los mejores momentos de la temporada de Aruser@s este verano en Aruser@s Fresh.

    "text": "Ubisoft ha fatto sapere di aver rinviato per la seconda volta la pubblicazione di Assassin’s Creed Shadows . Tramite un comunicato arrivato in redazione, la società francese ha spiegato che il team di sviluppo ha bisogno di più tempo per completare i lavori.\n“ Come parte della rinnovata attenzione alla qualità del gameplay e alle esperienze coinvolgenti del Day-1, è stato deciso di fornire un mese aggiuntivo di sviluppo ad Assassin’s Creed Shadows, ” si legge nella nota stampa. “ Questo tempo aggiuntivo consentirà al team di incorporare meglio il feedback dei giocatori ottenuto negli ultimi tre mesi e di contribuire a creare le migliori condizioni per il lancio continuando a interagire da vicino con la community di Assassin’s Creed. ”\nUbisoft ha annunciato che la nuova data di uscita di Assassin’s Creed Shadows è stata fissata al 20 marzo 2025 .\nNon è tutto: il CEO Yves Guillemot ha comunicato di aver “ adottato misure decisive per rimodellare il Gruppo al fine di offrire esperienze di gioco di prima categoria, migliorare l’efficienza operativa e massimizzare la creazione di valore. ” Guillemot ha precisato che la società ha nominato dei consulenti appositi per esplorare “ varie opzioni strategiche e capitalistiche ” così da sbloccare il pieno potenziale di valore degli asset aziendali.\nAndando oltre l’aziendalese, ciò significa che Ubisoft starebbe valutando anche l’ipotesi di vendita del gruppo a un soggetto terzo . Stando a quanto riportato nel comunicato, “ Ubisoft informerà il mercato, in conformità con le normative vigenti, se e quando una transazione dovesse concretizzarsi “. In ogni caso, vi terremo informati in caso di eventuali sviluppi.\nCondividi con gli amici Il tuo nome\nIl tuo e-mail\nE-mail del destinatario\nEnter a Message\nHo letto questo articolo e lo trovo fantastico, potrebbe interessarti!
