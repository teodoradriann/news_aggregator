    "text": "Want To Be a Millionaire? Embrace These 13 Habits Now\nOne million dollars is a number that many people set as a target for their\nretirement nest egg, and it has something of a mythical feel about it. The very idea of being a millionaire symbolizes great wealth for most Americans, and indeed only about 8.8% of Americans actually are millionaires, putting them in the category of the financial elite.\nHowever, there are concrete steps that anyone can take to increase their chances of reaching a seven-digit net worth. By starting early enough and implementing some of these financial steps, you may find yourself in this rarefied company\nmore easily than you think.\nStart Investing Early\nProbably the single biggest step you can take towards achieving millionaire status is to start investing early. As Mark Cuban said, “When investing, the best thing you can do is start early.” Socking away as little as $200 per month when you are 20 can translate to over $1 million by age 65 if you earn an 8% return on your investments. While no investment return is guaranteed, the long-term average return of the S&P 500 index easily eclipses this 8% target. However, as billionaire Warren Buffet advised: “The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second-best time is now.” So, better to start now than not at all.\nSave Until It Hurts\nYou might have heard that you should save at least 10% of your income to generate long-term wealth. While that’s a great start, if you want to\nbecome a millionaire, you’ll have to save until it hurts. This means different things for different people. If you’re only earning $25,000 per year, saving 10% of your money might hurt a little — but try pushing it to 15% or 20%. If you earn $200,000 per year, you might be able to push that savings rate to 50% or more. Or, to put it simply, listen to Buffet: “Do not save what is left after spending; spend what is left after saving.”\nInvest in Appreciating Assets, Not Depreciating Ones\nOne of the most important steps in reaching millionaire status is to only put your money into investments that will generate a positive return for you. In plain English, this means you should be investing in assets that have demonstrated long-term earnings potential, like the stock market and real estate, not in assets that lose value every day, like new cars or consumer goods.\nContinually Increase Your Income\nThe cost of living goes up nearly every year, so if your income doesn’t grow as well, you’ll never generate true wealth. Regularly ask for raises at your job so your income rises faster than the inflation rate. If you can’t squeeze any more money out of your current job, consider taking on a side gig or some type of additional work so you can continue to raise your income.\nGenerate Passive Income\nMillionaires and billionaires agree: Passive income is incredibly important to amassing a fortune. As Buffet said, “If you don’t find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die,” It’s hard to get wealthy just from earning a salary. But you can get to millionaire status a lot more quickly if you generate income that you don’t have to work for, known as passive income. A classic example is rental income. Once you buy a rental property, you’ll get paid every month by your renters without having to do any additional work beyond routine maintenance and repairs. If your rental income exceeds the amount you pay for your mortgage, property tax and other costs, you’re essentially using other people’s money to pay for your property while you sit and watch its value increase. Be like investor and author Robert Kiyosaki, who said, “my passive income exceeds my expenses. That’s financial independence.”\nPay Off Credit Card Debt\nKnocking down your credit card balances won’t earn you any money, but it might still be the best “investment” you ever make. If you carry a balance on your credit card, you may be paying interest of 20% or more annually. No investment you make can reliably generate those types of returns, so paying off any outstanding balances you have is one of the best possible uses of your money.\nMaximize Your 401(k) Match\nIf you’re lucky enough to have a 401(k) match at your job, you absolutely must take advantage of it each and every year. A 401(k) match may be the closest thing to free money you’ll ever receive, and best of all, it’s deposited into a tax-advantaged investment account. Even if you can’t contribute the absolute maximum to your 401(k) every year, at least contribute enough to claim your full employer match.\nMaintain a Top-Tier Credit Score\nAs financial guru\nSuze Orman said, “A good credit score is better than money.” A top-tier credit score won’t put any money in your pocket directly, but it can save you literally tens of thousands of dollars over your lifetime, perhaps even more. With a credit score above 740, you can usually qualify for the lowest available interest rates on everything from home mortgages to auto loans, and the savings can really pile up. A $300,000, 30-year mortgage at 3.0% vs. 4.5%, for example, will save you over $74,000 in interest over the life of the loan.\nLive in an Affordable Community\nAmerica is a vast country with plenty of comfortable places to live. If you can live in a lower-cost area while still earning the same salary, it’s the same as if you got a significant raise. As more and more companies are allowing their employees to work remotely, see if you can move to a less-expensive area and boost your savings rate to help you achieve millionaire status.\nBe Entrepreneurial and Take Calculated Risks\n“The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today,” said U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Millionaires are often willing to take smart risks to grow their money through new business ventures. Calculated risks and entrepreneurship can lead to greater reward.\nNetwork and Seek Mentorship\nSurrounding yourself with knowledgeable peers and mentors accelerates learning and unlocks opportunities. As Shark Tank’s Daymond John said,”Finding mentors has been key to my success.” Millionaires invest time in networking and mentor relationships.\nLearn Constantly and Improve Your Skills\n“Risk comes from not knowing what you’re doing,” said Buffett. Education and skill development are lifelong pursuits. Millionaires continually learn to expand their knowledge, abilities and opportunities.\nPractice Intentional Goal Setting\nMillionaires set clear goals for their money and review them regularly. Intentional goal setting and tracking progress are keys to success. “Decide what you want, decide what you are willing to exchange for it. Establish your priorities and go to work,” said American tycoon H. L. Hunt.\nLaura Beck contributed to the reporting for this article.\nMore From GOBankingRates\nPocket an Extra $403 Per Month With This Simple Hack I Grew Up Poor: Here Are 8 Things I Never Waste Money On Experts: Make These 7 Money Resolutions If You Want To Become Rich on an Average Salary The 7 Worst Things You Can Do If You Owe the IRS",

    "text": "A North Carolina family has been reunited with a photo album that had been washed away in the floodwaters during Helene. (WXII, SHAWN VESTEY, CNN) By Kara Peters, WXII via CNN Newsource Published: Oct. 11, 2024 at 4:14 AM PDT | Updated: 2 hours ago Email This Link\nShare on Facebook\nShare on X (formerly Twitter)\nShare on Pinterest\nShare on LinkedIn\nHICKORY, N.C. (WXII) - A good Samaritan returned to his hometown of Boone, North Carolina, to help with the cleanup from Helene.\nWhat he found within the mud and debris ended up being valuable and irreplaceable for one family.\nThe saying goes, “A picture is worth a thousand words,” but no words can describe the moment Brittany Wilson met the good Samaritan that found her family’s photo album filled with childhood memories.\n“Sadness, but happiness,” Wilson remarked. “I see my family. There’s my mom and my cousins and everything, you know, my great-grandma. I miss her dearly. I was 19 when I lost her, but I do thank you.”\nShawn Vestey went up to his hometown a week ago to help with the cleanup from Helene only to find so much more within the mud and debris.\n“It was kind of devastating because I didn’t know if it was the people we were right beside because there was a house right beside it, or I didn’t know if it was upstream,” Vestey said. “My first thought was I need to post this and find the owner because I knew somebody would probably want these photos back.”\nVestey then posted the missing photo album on Facebook, and within hours, he received a response.\n“I’m just scrolling through Facebook and I had to stop for a minute because my heart sank,” Wilson said. “I seen my great-grandmother in one and I’m like, ‘There’s no way.’\"\nWilson and Vestey met for the first time in Hickory to reflect on the photo album that swept through the waters of Helene.\nThe pages and crinkled pictures now add a whole new perspective.\n“My aunt and uncle lost their whole shop, and it even went into their home and flooded their home, too,” Wilson added. “Obviously, they still can’t even find their shed that just completely washed away.”\nThe unexpected reunion served as a reminder that even in the midst of devastation, there are still moments to be grateful.\n“It warmed my heart knowing that a complete stranger, that all he had to do was to throw them away. I mean, he had no connection to my family’s photos, could just post that and take the time out to do that, so I really do appreciate that,” Wilson said.\nThe story does not stop there.\nWilson says another stranger found even more photos of her family after the storm. She plans to connect with that good Samaritan soon to retrieve those.\n“It gives you kind of hope and purpose in a way, which is nice,” Vestey said.\nCopyright 2024 WXII via CNN Newsource.

    "text": "Gov. Roy Cooper signed legislation that will preserve and update the state's automatic expunction law, which is deigned to aid people with certain criminal records in overcoming barriers to employment and housing. (Photo: Clayton Henkel)\nA debate over a state law that governs the expunction of criminal records was resolved quickly and quietly before state lawmakers left town in late June, allowing automatic expunctions to resume on July 1 for certain “dismissed” or “not guilty” verdicts.\nOn Monday, Gov. Roy Cooper signed a measure ( Senate Bill 565 ) that makes revisions to the statute, but the bill no longer contained a provision that had been included that would have repealed the law.\n“At first, the purpose of Senate Bill 565 was to restart automatic expungement with some needed fixes,” said Laura Webb, Director of the North Carolina Justice Center’s Fair Chance project. “And then what happened … was the bill basically was gutted and rewritten to repeal automatic expungement.”\n“This sparked a significant effort, with many people coming forward to fight the repeal,” said Webb.\nThe story of the expunction law has been a case of good intentions running up against real world logistical challenges.\nIn December 2021, North Carolina became the 14th state to automatically expunge criminal charges resulting in acquittals or dismissals, removing the need for individuals to file petitions to delete these charges from their records.\nThe changes were part of a broader ‘second chance’ movement in North Carolina and nationwide that seeks to allow people with certain criminal records to overcome barriers to employment and housing.\nBut nine months after the law was enacted, in August 2022, lawmakers suspended it temporarily after the court system became overwhelmed by the volume of records it was being required to expunge. The legislature directed the courts to create a group to recommend fixes for the problem which included handling and retaining records confidentially.\nThe resumption of the law, delayed twice, was due to take effect this July 1. But in May, some lawmakers attempted to repeal automatic expunction entirely, sparking the backlash from advocates.\nIn late June, a conference committee report for the legislation emerged that discarded the repeal and both houses unanimously approved the revised version on June 26.\n“Without automation, most people who are eligible to get their charges expunged won’t do that just because they don’t know how to, and so the backlog of eligible cases just kind of illustrates that,” said Webb.\nAdvocates say several factors contribute to this, including the complexity of navigating the criminal process, lack of awareness of the program, complicated eligibility criteria, and financial barriers.\nBefore automatic expunctions began in December 2021, the court system processed a limited number of expunction requests annually through a petition process. For example, the North Carolina Administrative Office of the Courts processed 45,455 expunctions in fiscal years 2018-19, 2019-20, and 2020-21, according to the AOC’s 2023 Expunctions Report. But in the nine months the automatic expunction provision was operational, more than 400,000 charges were expunged.\n“People were eligible for expungement over the last two years, but they didn’t get the expungement for one reason or the other. And so that’s why automation is so necessary, because if automation was running those million something cases would have been expunged through the automatic process,” said Webb.\nThe state’s transition to “eCourts” has made it easier for the court system to manage and store the massive number of cases. Senate Bill 565 also makes clear who can access expunged records. Only prosecutors, the individual whose record was expunged, or their attorney can access these records.\nCurrently, thanks in large part to the two-year suspension, there are more than 1 million cases eligible for expunction — a backlog that is expected to take as much as a year for the automatic process to work through. Individuals can still file a formal request to have their records expunged, but the process remains complex and difficult to negotiate for many individuals.\nThe post Cooper approves bill that preserves, updates automatic expunction law appeared first on NC Newsline .",

    "text": "Notimex Sindicato de Notimex levanta su huelga tras el pago de indemnizacionesLa Junta Federal de Conciliación y Arbitraje pagó las indemnizaciones a los trabajadores del Sindicato de Notimex, tras los cual, los periodistas y trabajadores de la agencia levantaron la huelga que duró tres años y 10 meses. CIUDAD DE MÉXICO (apro).- La Secretaría de Gobernación (Secgob) informó que la Junta Federal de Conciliación y Arbitraje realizó este viernes el pago de las indemnizaciones a los trabajadores del Sindicato Único de Trabajadores (SUT) de Notimex, tras los cual, los periodistas y trabajadores de la Agencia de Noticias del Estado concluyeron la huelga que duró tres años y 10 meses. En su cuenta de X, la Secgob publicó un comunicado en el que afirmó: “En cumplimiento a las instrucciones del presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador, se realizó el pago correspondiente con pleno respeto a los derechos laborales de la organización sindical, de acuerdo con la Ley Federal del Trabajo”. A un costado del campamento que levantaron los huelguistas en avenida Baja California 200, en la alcaldía Cuauhtémoc, Adriana Urrea, secretaria general del SUT de Notimex, confirmó: “Hoy por la mañana se firmó ya el acuerdo entre Notimex, con la participación del Indep (Instituto para Devolverle al Pueblo lo Robado), que es el órgano litigador después de aceptarse el proceso de extinción, y obviamente ante las autoridades, para dar por terminada las relaciones primero colectivas y después individuales”. Aunque reconoció que el objetivo del sindicato era defender su fuente de trabajo y no el cierre de la agencia, agregó en conferencia: “Con esto se conjura la huelga en la agencia de noticias del Estado Mexicano”. Al ser cuestionada sobre si todos los trabajadores ya recibieron su indemnización, Urrea contestó: “Las liquidaciones ya se hicieron, de hecho esa fue condición para que nosotros pudiéramos levantar la huelga (...) no se iba a levantar campamento hasta que no se pagara al último trabajador”. Lo anterior también fue confirmado por la secretaria general del sindicato. Mientras sus compañeros enunciaron “que sube, que baja, su Notimex no se raja”, Adriana Urrea leyó un texto en el que apuntó que con el cierre de Notimex se termina con la fuente laboral de más de un centenar de trabajadores: “Bajo el pretexto de una supuesta corrupción en el Sut Notimex, Sanjuana Martines (exdirectora de Notimex) llegó a correr al personal, a violar los derechos de los trabajadores, a violar el contrato colectivo de trabajo, pues jamás demostró ante las autoridades tal corrupción”. Después exigió: “Que la dirección aclare públicamente dónde quedaron los millones de pesos que se otorgaron durante cinco años, cuando la agencia estuvo tres años y diez meses en huelga”. Durante la huelga, Sanjuana Martínez denunció que fue víctima de “terrorismo sindical”, al tiempo que los trabajadores la acusaban de abusos laborales. De acuerdo con el Sistema Nacional de Transparencia, Sanjuana Martínez recibió en 2019 un salario mensual bruto de 122 mil 512 pesos y un salario mensual neto de 86 mil 698 pesos, sin embargo, no muestra las percepciones salariales durante 2021, 2021, y 2021. El pasado 27 de septiembre, la exdirectora de la agencia de noticias publicó en su cuenta de la red X una foto con el presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador: “Sostuve reunión con el presidente López obrador para preparar los últimos detalles del cierre de Notimex”. La posibilidad de un sindicato de industria Frente a los integrantes del sindicato, Urrea aseguró que seguirán en la lucha: “Volveremos y tendrán noticias nuestras porque esto no se acaba aquí”. Luego de sus palabras, los asistentes corearon la consigna: “Ni un paso atrás”. La secretaria general del SUT Notimex anunció que llevaron a asamblea la propuesta de transformar su organización en un sindicato de industria: “Esto significa que podremos dar acompañamiento y agrupar a trabajadores de otros medios de comunicación”. Argumentó que quieren aprovechar su experiencia, pues en el país el oficio de periodista es uno de los más precarizados, y detalló que están siendo asesorados de otros sindicatos que pasaron por dicho proceso de transformación, u otros que nacieron como sindicatos de industria. Además, adelantó que trabajan en la confirmación de una cooperativa, para hacer una nueva agencia de información que priorizará temas laborales y sindicales. Urrea llegó a dar su mensaje en compañía de José Luis Sánchez, director del departamento jurídico de la Secretaría de Trabajo y Previsión Social (STPS); Óscar Mendoza, miembro del departamento jurídico de la Secgob, y Carlos Mendoza, que encabeza el cuerpo jurídico de SUT Notimex. Otros sindicatos acudieron a la conferencia en muestra de apoyo, como el Sindicato de Trabajadores del Instituto Mexicano de Tecnología del Agua (Sitimta), Sindicato de Trabajadores de Prensa, Sindicato de Trabajadores del Instituto de Vivienda de la Ciudad de México (Astinvi), Sindicato de Telefonistas de la República Mexicana (STRM), la Federación Nacional de Sindicatos de la Banca de Desarrollo (Fenabad), por mencionar algunos. Al punto de las 16:40 horas, los periodistas y trabajadores del SUT Notimex comenzaron a retirar el campamento. El pasado 13 de diciembre, el Senado de la República aprobó la extinción de Notimex con 59 votos a favor, 44 en contra y 2 abstenciones. La medida fue impulsada por López Obrador, quien en abril pasado sostuvo que Notimex estaba por desaparecer, después de que operó durante 55 años.",
