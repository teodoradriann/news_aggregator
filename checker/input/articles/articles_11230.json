El seleccionado europeo venció 1-0 a Liechtenstein, este jueves 5 de septiembre de 2024, y luego de 20 años volvió a conseguir una victoria. El único gol del partido fue de Nicko Sensoli, al minuto 53 en el estadio Olímpico de San Marino, luego de dos errores en defensa del combinado rival. ¿Cuántos años estuvo San Marino sin conseguir una victoria? En el diario ‘Clarín’ explicaron exactamente que “fueron 20 años y cinco meses en los que acumuló seis empates y 135 derrotas, con apenas 21 goles a favor y 568 en contra”. El duelo de este jueves entre San Marino y Liechtenstein se dio por la fecha 1 del grupo M de las Nations League.

El pequeño país de apenas 30.000 habitantes, rodeado por Italia, llegó al partido en el estadio de San Marino buscando su primera victoria de cualquier tipo desde que venció a Liechtenstein en un amistoso en 2004. A Liechtenstein le anularon un gol por un ajustado fuera de juego en la primera mitad antes de que San Marino aprovechara un error defensivo para anotar el gol de la victoria en el minuto 53 gracias a Nicko Sensoli. Publicidad Tenía 19 años y no había nacido cuando el equipo que ocupa el puesto 210 y último en la clasificación mundial ganó un partido por última vez. Los chivos expiatorios del fútbol internacional se habían ido preparando para lograrlo, habiendo empatado en partidos amistosos contra Seychelles, Santa Lucía y Saint Kitts y Nevis en los últimos dos años.

    "title": "Hurricanes end year with Pinstripe Bowl loss to Rutgers",
    "text": "NEW YORK CITY — The Hurricanes’ run defense was stout for nearly the entire season, but with several players missing due to the NFL draft or departing via the transfer portal, the run defense faltered.\nRutgers racked up 208 yards on the ground and scored three rushing touchdowns as the Scarlet Knights (7-6) picked up a 31-24 win over Miami (7-6) in the Pinstripe Bowl at Yankee Stadium. The Hurricanes have now lost their last five bowl appearances and 11 of their past 12.\n“We look at it with honesty, we look at it with reality: There’s so many good things that we have done throughout the season that show progress, and yet we find ourselves showing a lack of discipline in crunch time,” Miami coach Mario Cristobal said. “A special teams blunder and a turnover on downs is a turnover. So those are things that you have to just attack collectively, as a group, as an organization. Coaches, players, everybody. There’s no pointing fingers in there. When you win, you win together. When you lose, you lose together.”\nMiami entered the game missing several key players. Starting quarterback Tyler Van Dyke and wide receiver Colbie Young transferred to Wisconsin and Georgia, respectively. Starting defensive tackle Leonard Taylor III, starting safeties Kam Kinchens and James Williams and starting offensive linemen Javion Cohen and Matt Lee all sat the game out as they prepared for the NFL draft.\nThe Hurricanes got off to a sluggish start on defense. Rutgers went up 14-0 to start the game, getting touchdowns on a goal-line run by quarterback Gavin Wimsatt and a 7-yard run by Kyle Monangai.\nMiami’s offense got out to a slow start, managing just 5 yards in the first quarter. But the Scarlet Knights aided the Hurricanes late in the first half, committing a pair of personal fouls to help UM get in the red zone. Jacurri Brown put the Hurricanes on the board with a 7-yard run and score, sliding into the end zone.\nThe Hurricanes got the ball back at their own 10-yard line with 40 seconds left, but instead of taking a knee to end the half down a score, they chose to try for points. The decision paid off, as they drove down the field and reached the Scarlet Knights’ 17-yard line. Miami nearly scored a game-tying touchdown on a catch by Xavier Restrepo, but a review ruled him out of bounds. The Hurricanes needed to settle for a field goal to end the second quarter.\nMiami jumped out to its one lead of the game on a 30-yard touchdown from Brown to Restrepo on their first drive of the second half, but their second ended in disaster. After the Scarlet Knights pinned the Hurricanes inside the 10 on a punt, they forced a three-and-out.\nRutgers’ Trevor Kodie-Yeboah blocked a Dylan Joyce punt in the end zone, and Timmy Ward recovered it for a Scarlet Knights go-ahead touchdown.\n“Obviously, a block and a touchdown at the same time is massive in terms of momentum,” Cristobal said.\nRutgers put the game away in the fourth quarter. Monangai, who finished the game with 163 yards, broke off a 40-yard run to put Rutgers at the Miami 1. Wimsatt punched in another 1-yard score to put the Scarlet Knights up by 11.\n“That was a really good running back,” Mauigoa said. “… We just didn’t fit our gaps and (missed) assignments, and that’s something we’ve got to work on.”\nBrown added a late rushing touchdown, and Miami recovered an onside kick to create some late drama, but the Hurricanes could not mount a game-tying drive.\nFive takeaways Offense flashes for moments with Jacurri Brown Brown played his first snaps of the season, and on some drives, that was obvious. Miami’s offense had four three-and-outs (one of which resulted in a blocked punt and touchdown) and was forced to punt four times. Brown also threw a brutal interception in the first half that led to a Scarlet Knights touchdown.\nBut Brown was efficient on some drives, leading UM down the field before the end of the first half and on their first drive of the second half. He threw several well-executed passes, including a touchdown to Restrepo and another near-touchdown that was overturned on review.\nBrown ended the game 20 of 31 for 181 yards, one touchdown and one interception. He also ran for a team-best 57 yards and scored a pair of touchdowns.\n“I thought he played hard and did a lot of really good things,” Cristobal said. “He’d love to have that one interception back. … But he really made some explosive plays. He found his way out of the pocket when the pocket collapsed a little bit. Made some really good throws, some others he’d like to have back against a team that’s a top-10 defense in the passing game.”\nXavier Restrepo hits 1,000 yards The Hurricanes’ veteran wide receiver could leave Miami and enter the NFL draft if he wants. If that is Restrepo’s choice, his final game at Miami was a stellar one.\nRestrepo made several good catches against Rutgers and nearly pulled off a touchdown catch from the seat of his pants. He ended the game with 99 yards, putting him at 1,092 yards for the season —tied with Andre Johnson for the fifth-most in UM history. He had 11 receptions, giving him 85 for the season — the most catches for a Hurricanes receiver in a single year.\n“Obviously, Restrepo’s done a really good job all year,” Cristobal said. “Made some big catches today, as well. … Always plays hard, always throws his body around and is a very reliable and explosive player.”\nDefense makes adjustments Miami’s defense struggled to stop Rutgers’ offensive attack early in the game, surrendering 153 yards on the Scarlet Knights’ first three drives.\nBut the Hurricanes bounced back, forcing punts on the subsequent three drives before surrendering another rushing touchdown to Monangai.\nMiami entered the game with the nation’s No. 10 rush defense but ultimately gave up 208 rushing yards, which was the second-most they have surrendered all year. The 292 total yards UM surrendered was the fifth-best game, by yardage, for the Hurricanes’ defense this season.\nInjuries to key players The worst-case scenario for a bowl game happened in the first quarter. Hurricanes star running back Mark Fletcher Jr. suffered a foot injury on a carry and had to be helped off the field. He was taken from the sideline in a cart and did not return to the game.\nCristobal said X-rays on Fletcher’s foot were negative but there was “certainly something else going on there.”\nFletcher, an American Heritage alum, has grown into a dependable running back for the Hurricanes in his first season. He ran for 514 yards and five touchdowns as a freshman.\nIn the fourth quarter, sophomore linebacker Wesley Bissainthe also suffered an upper-body injury, Cristobal said, and did not return to the game.\nRueben Bain ends freshman year on high note Freshman defensive lineman Rueben Bain Jr. has blossomed into a star in his freshman season, and his final game of the year showed why.\nThe explosive defensive end racked up seven tackles with three tackles for loss, a career-high, and a forced fumble in the loss.\n“It means the world to him,” Cristobal said. “That’s what it is. He’s really talented, but he plays really, really hard, and it means the world to him. We need a bunch more guys like Rueben.”\n ",

    "text": "Two Queensland women who drowned in a stormwater drain following wild weather conditions have been identified as 46-year-old Tanya Hehir and 40-year-old Helen Bradford. The women were exploring a 2.4km drain called the \"love tunnel\" in Gympie with a friend when they were swept away by floodwaters. Their companion, a 46-year-old woman made it to safety and contacted police. Emergency services were called to the Kidd Bridge around 3.20pm. A search and rescue operation commenced involving water police, general duties officers, swift water rescue crews and the SES. Police first recovered Helen Bradford's body at 7:10pm on Boxing Day and Tanya Hehir's body on December 27. Tanya Hehir was a keen runner and a member of the Gympie Hash House Harriers. Gympie Regional Council mayor Glen Hartwig told the ABC that he would consider new safety measures in light of the tragedy. \"It's an old stormwater system that's been there since the foundation of Gympie,\" he said. \"It's not a place to be played with. It's not a place where you want to go and explore.\" Acting superintendent Paul Algie said in recent times that weather events were developing quickly and advised the public to be careful near water. \"There is always the chance tragedy can strike,\" he said.

    "title": "Ngeh’s proposal to have non-Muslim experts in syariah law committee a mistake: Loke - News",
    "text": "KUALA LUMPUR: DAP secretary-general Anthony Loke today stressed that the proposal by Beruas Member of Parliament Datuk Ngeh Koo Ham for the government to appoint non-Muslim legal experts into the special committee to study issues related to the competencies of state legislative assembly in enacting Islamic laws was a mistake and misunderstanding about the committee’s source of power. Realising that the proposal could spark controversy as DAP would be seen trying to meddle in Islamic legal affairs, Loke asserted that this is entirely untrue because the party is committed to the principle of mutual respect and harmony among religions and ethnicities. “The committee was established by the Malaysian National Council for Islamic Religious Affairs (MKI), chaired by Sultan Sharafuddin Idris Shah of Selangor, and aims to advise the council with suggestions to empower and elevate the jurisdictions of Syariah Courts. “It should be emphasised that the establishment of this special committee is not determined by the cabinet but by MKI, and they report directly to MKI. “DAP respects the wisdom of His Royal Highness the Sultan of Selangor in making any decisions regarding MKI affairs,” he said in a statement today. Loke said any proposals by the special committee involving legal amendments must be brought to the Cabinet for the usual process of legal enactments. As such, Loke said non-Muslim communities need not worry about this matter because any legal amendments involving the rights of non-Muslims must be thoroughly discussed and finalised by the cabinet before being brought to Parliament. Yesterday, the media reported that Ngeh proposed the government appoint experts from the non-Muslim community to assist the special committee established earlier this month and to ensure that the non-Muslims’ views were considered before making any changes to the laws. The proposal, however, was slammed by Umno secretary-general Datuk Dr. Asyraf Wajdi Dusuki, who said that there was no need for non-Muslim experts to be appointed to the special committee. Meanwhile, Bangi Member of Parliament Syahredzan Johan through a post of X today echoed Asyraf Wajdi’s sentiments, saying that he believed that the members of the special committee are experienced and competent in their respective fields, especially constitutional law, and would be able to conduct an objective study, going beyond considerations of their own ethnicity and religion. “Furthermore, the committee’s suggestions or findings are not binding on the cabinet, and I believe that all views and further engagement sessions will be conducted before any suggestions are accepted and implemented. “Therefore, there is no reason to say that the views or suggestions presented to the government will be limited to one party,” he said, adding that all parties should give space to the committee to continue what has been entrusted to them to start addressing the issues that need to be fully resolved.

I've always been such a huge Christina fan and it's been so nice to see her look so happy, healthy and THRIVING lately and this shoot is SO GORGEOUS,' gushed another.\nA slender Christina Aguilera has shocked her longtime fans after appearing completely unrecognizable in a new photoshoot\nThe hitmaker showed off her fuller figure on the red carpet back in 2012\n'I thought that was Nicola Peltz for a second,' added another.\nA fourth speculated, 'Ozempic not only made her lose weight but changed her face too.'\nAnother wrote, 'Her ability to look younger every time I see her should be studied.

(TND) — The alleged murder of a woman in New York by an illegal immigrant is prompting Republican lawmakers to scrutinize the state's \"sanctuary\" policies. 21-year-old Jhon Moises Chacaguasay-Ilbis is accused of strangling Joselyn Toaquiza, a hotel housekeeper from Ecuador, to death this month. The woman's body was found in Syracuse's Lincoln Park on Saturday, three days after she was reported missing and just one day after her 21st birthday. Chacaguasay-Ilbis and Toaquiza were previously classmates while both living in Ecuador, family members told [CNY Central](https://cnycentral.com/news/local/syracuse-murder-arrest-joselyn-toaquiza-lincoln-park-strangulation-custody-onondaga-county-district-attorney#). Chacaguasay-Ilbis pled not guilty Thursday to charges of murder and concealment of a corpse, claiming he has no memory of the incident due to being under the influence of alcohol. He is currently being held without bail with a preliminary court hearing set for July 2. The man allegedly entered the U.S. illegally last year and may have been applying for asylum. It is not immediately clear what Toaquiza's immigration status was. However, the revelation surrounding Chacaguasay-Ilbis has prompted some Republican lawmakers to sound the alarm on state and federal immigration policies. The border crisis is no longer isolated in states like Texas; it’s in our own backyard. This coward should have never been let into our country in the first place, but open-border Democrats welcomed him with open arms,\" Assemblyman John Lemondes, R-District 126, told The National Desk (TND). \"This is a direct result of former-Gov. Cuomo’s sanctuary state policies which have been continued by Gov. Hochul,\" the assemblyman continued. \"Until we recognize this crisis for what it is, we will continue to see tragedies like this. It’s time to say enough is enough.” READ MORE | [Albany police, lawmakers face cover-up speculations in undocumented immigrant's rape case](https://cbs6albany.com/news/local/police-accused-of-cover-up-in-undocumented-immigrants-rape-case-in-albany-sakir-akkan#) Rep. Claudia Tenney, R-N.Y., echoed the sentiments in a statement to TND. Jhon Moises Chacaguasay should never have been allowed into our country, yet the Biden administration and Albany Democrats welcomed him with open arms,” the congresswoman said. \"This tragedy could have been easily prevented if President Biden and Kathy Hochul had done their jobs and prioritized American citizens over these violent criminals. Our communities remain at risk due to their abhorrent failures.\" TND reached out to New York Gov. Kathy Hochul for a response to the lawmakers' claims, but has not received a response. This story will be updated if a response is received. In 2017, then-New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo issued an [executive order](https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/EO_%23_170.pdf) prohibiting state agencies and officers from inquiring about an individual's immigration status unless necessitated by law or in cases of illegal criminal activity. The protections extended to those who ask law enforcement officers for assistance or are witnesses to or victims of a crime.

Hochul has since doubled down on such efforts. In 2021, less than two months after being sworn in as governor, she signed legislation classifying certain threats to report an individual's immigration status as \"extortion or coercion.\" Additionally, in July, the Democratic governor [announced](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-announces-implementation-federal-measures-protect-undocumented-workers-during#:~:text=Governor%20Kathy%20Hochul%20today%20announced,year%20by%20the%20Biden%20administration.) a new state process protecting undocumented immigrant workers from \"retaliation and removal\" during labor disputes. The process is aligned with directives from the Biden administration. During an appearance on MSNBC in February, Gov. Hochul [criticized](https://thenationaldesk.com/news/americas-news-now/ny-governor-claims-gop-broke-border-im-putting-them-on-notice-kathy-hochul-msnbc-tuesday-migrants-mexico-nyc-eric-adams-crisis-immigration-migrants-new-york-upstate-albany-republicans) Republicans in Congress for rejecting a bipartisan border deal touted by President Joe Biden. \"Those Republicans – even in one state like New York – 10 of them can make this happen. If they don’t, this will be a wedge issue, a forceful issue against them this November as well,” she asserted. “I’m putting them on notice. You broke it, you now own it.”",
