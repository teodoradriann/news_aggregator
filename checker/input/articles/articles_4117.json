    "title": "Smooth Christmas and New Year's holiday travel season at new KCI terminal",
    "text": "If you look closely inside the new Kansas City International Airport terminal, you can see the good moments are here to stay in 2024. There were sweet homecoming reunions, big hugs from loved ones, and locals showing hospitality to new friends with big welcome signs as holiday travel wound down Monday night. KSHB 41 even saw people take time to connect with other passengers. “We want to greet them to give them a nice warm welcome to KC,” said Stephanie Umunna, who was welcoming a new international student to the University of Central Missouri. Justin Meyer, Deputy Director of the Aviation Department, said increased enforcement of the rules regarding stopping at the curbs outside the terminal, more TSA screening staff on duty and adding 30-minute free garage parking made the first holiday travel season in the new terminal a success. Winter weather and flight cancellations were a challenge last year. Meyer said this year was much smoother. “We’re nine months into this building now and it’s been delightful,” Meyer said. “Over the holiday travel period to see people who are in the building for the first or second time. The people that are looking up and taking out their phones and taking pictures. We're just so proud of how the building was designed and implemented.” Meyer said 11.5 million passengers have passed through the airport since February 2023. With added international and domestic flights, Meyer said 2024 could set a record for the number of passengers using the airport. Passengers can see why the new terminal is a big hit. “To the lobby, to the gate area, to the restrooms, I’ve never seen an airport in the 40-50 years I’ve been in as clean as this one,” said Bill Castrop. Another family appreciated the new design that made their travels smoother. “I like how it’s separated with the departures and the arrivals, more of the new, modern, traditional design that other airports have gone to,” one family told KSHB 41.",

    "text": "– Significant blood pressure reductions among patients with uncontrolled or resistant hypertension treated with lorundrostat reinforce key role of dysregulated aldosterone in disease onset and progression –\n– Detailed results from the second pivotal Phase 3 Launch-HTN trial to be presented at an upcoming medical conference and published in a peer-reviewed publication –\nRADNOR, Pa., April 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mineralys Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: MLYS), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing medicines to target hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and other diseases driven by dysregulated aldosterone, today announced that the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) published the detailed results from the Company’s pivotal Phase 2 Advance-HTN trial, the first of two pivotal trials evaluating lorundrostat in patients with uncontrolled hypertension (uHTN) or resistant hypertension (rHTN). The full manuscript is titled, “Lorundrostat Efficacy and Safety in Patients with Uncontrolled Hypertension,” and is featured in the April 23, 2025 issue of NEJM .\nThe key data from the publication showed that lorundrostat 50 mg demonstrated a 15.4 mmHg absolute reduction and a 7.9 mmHg placebo-adjusted reduction (p=0.001), in 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure at week 12. Lorundrostat worked equally well in those taking two baseline medications and those taking three or more, and in both men and women as well as in white and black patients. Lorundrostat demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile, with modest changes in potassium, sodium and eGFR.\nLesen Sie auch 70 Prozent Kurspotenzial Evotec überrascht beim Gewinn: Analyst spricht von \"ermutigendem Wendepunkt\" heute 12:32 Weniger Ballast, mehr Marge Evotec macht Tabula Rasa – Strategiewechsel soll bis 2028 Milliarden bringen 17.04.25, 10:44 Kurz vor RSV-Impfdurchbruch GSK: Goldman Sachs geht von einer positiven Überraschung in dieser Woche aus 15.04.25, 16:26 Blockbuster-Potenzial? 1 Dividendenaristokrat, der wie Novo Nordisk vom Multimilliarden-Obesity-Markt profitieren könnte 11.04.25, 19:00 “The publication of our Advance-HTN trial results in the New England Journal of Medicine is a significant milestone that underscores both the strength of our clinical data and the potentially transformative nature of this new class of medicines that could help address dysregulated aldosterone, an unaddressed, key driver of hypertension,” stated Jon Congleton, Chief Executive Officer of Mineralys Therapeutics. “Prior studies have shown that even modest reductions in systolic blood pressure can lead to a substantial decrease in the incidence of major cardiovascular events. The blood pressure reductions with lorundrostat observed in the Advance-HTN trial are particularly meaningful given the well-established correlation between elevated blood pressure, dysregulated aldosterone production and cardiovascular risk.”\nSeite 1 von 5 Seite 2 ►",

    "text": "By Victor Block When Betsy and Tom Butler entered the hotel room, their favorite music welcomed them and the lighting was adjusted to fit their mood. After unpacking, they began a virtual exploration of attractions, restaurants and other things to see and do in the city they were visiting. The Butlers were taking advantage of one of the fastest-growing innovations in travel. The explosion of artificial intelligence in both leisure tourism and business trips is changing the way many people plan, take and enjoy time away from home. From choosing where to go and booking flights to finding the best accommodations at any price, AI is providing valuable assistance to a growing number of both vacationers and those going on the road for work. One concise description of the uses and benefits of AI in travel is offered by James Liang, chairman of the Trip.com Group. Speaking about his company's TripGenie app, which generates itineraries based on personal preferences, he says it \"transforms the way travelers plan and book their trips, enhancing engagement, accuracy and personalization in the travel experience. Our goal is to help the customer plan the perfect trip, like a genie.\" The push for technological advancement also is playing out in other ways. A 2022 survey found that use of AI in the travel and hospitality sector is much lower than in other industries. That means there is much room for growth, and companies and services are moving in to fill the void. They are offering an ever-expanding variety of enhancements. The Expedia Group's AI travel agent enables customers to cancel flights, check hotel reservations and deal with specific needs such as verifying wheelchair accessibility. Claiming to be \"the world's largest travel guidance platform,\" Tripadvisor uses the new technology to help customers arrange personalized travel itineraries. They are able to utilize more than 1 billion reviews and opinions available on the site, along with photos. Those with questions about their travel plans who seek answers from the Trip.com chatbot often receive instant responses. It can offer tailored itineraries and help with pre-trip decisions and in-trip arrangements. Personalization is a primary goal of the use of AI in travel. Sojern's digital platform collects anonymous traveler information and targets it — and ads — on sites in which people might have an interest. The company's virtual accommodations concierge service can handle tasks like scheduling a spa appointment and ordering requested items to be delivered to a hotel room. Improving hotel stays also is a primary objective of some AI programs. Hyatt Hotels has begun offering beds that take advantage of new software functions that can track a person's heart rate and breathing and adjust the mattress temperature and firmness to help induce a deeper doze. It's even possible to plan a gentle wake-up nudge in the morning. Intercontinental Hotels & Resorts, which has more than 200 luxury properties worldwide, uses the Josh.ai database to create what it terms \"the hotel room of the future.\" The Butlers were enjoying one of those spaces, using devices and voice-controlled connections borrowed from smart homes. They were able to search for places to eat, attractions that fit their preferences and other aspects of where they were visiting to make their stay as pleasant as possible. Not surprisingly, finding good deals and discounts also is a primary purpose of AI databases. That's one goal of Hopper, whose mobile app seeks good price offerings on flights, hotels and car rentals. Add-on functions include price freezing to protect against increases when changing a flight booking or switching a hotel reservation. With every query to its meta-search engine, KAYAK scans hundreds of travel sites. Its cost-prediction model forecasts if the price of flights is likely to rise or fall and suggests when a customer should purchase tickets in order to get the lowest fare. In addition to the advantages that AI provides to travelers, it also offers plusses to companies in the travel industry. This can range from monitoring and predicting maintenance needs in hotel rooms to optimizing energy efficiency. Its use in automating repetitive tasks frees hotel staff to provide in-person services to guests. AI-powered personalization and recommendation engines lead to targeted experiences for lodgers based on their preferences. This can include touch-screen check-in, room amenities fashioned for the guest's liking, QR scanning for ordering food and a list of other activities and amenities. According to Howard Phung of the Pro-Invest Group, a real estate firm active in the hotel sector, energy consumption and wage costs are the biggest cost challenges that hotels face. He says technology can provide improved monitoring of those expenditures. Other kinds of help also may be on the way. Heidi George, director of operational excellence at TFE Hotels, peers into the future and foresees robots performing repetitive work such as cleaning and food preparation. Those chores would be among a rapidly expanding diversity of services and assistance available through the use of artificial intelligence.
