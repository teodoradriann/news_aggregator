    "text": "LILM | 18 minutes ago Follows German parliament´s Budget Committee not approving a loan guarantee that was a condition precedent to a private fundraise Company was also unable to reach an agreement in principle with Bavarian government to guarantee a €50 million loan\nApplication for self-administration proceedings driven by insolvency at Lilium subsidiaries in Germany\nMUNICH, Oct. 24, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lilium N.V. (Nasdaq: LILM), a leading electric aircraft manufacturer and pioneer in Regional Air Mobility (RAM), today announced that its principal German subsidiaries will apply for self-administration proceedings in the next few days with the competent court in Germany. This follows a lengthy and complex government approval process for a loan from KfW, which failed in the Budget Committee of the German parliament.\nLilium&CloseCurlyQuote;s international competition is receiving grants and loans in the U.S., France, China, Brazil, and the UK. Therefore, German government support was seen by Lilium investors as critical to retain market confidence and potential future investment.\n“Our plan was to obtain shareholder investment in a new funding round anchored by a German government backed loan of €100 million,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; Lilium CEO Klaus Roewe said. “We had already conditionally secured additional private capital to complement the KfW loan. However, the Budget Committee was unable to agree on the loan and Bavaria couldn&CloseCurlyQuote;t do it alone.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;\nGerman government support of the KfW loan was a closing condition to already committed private funding and without this support Lilium was left with no alternative but to cause the principal German subsidiaries to file for self-administration.\nLilium was also in advanced discussions regarding a French government guarantee of a €219 million loan to finance a battery factory and an assembly line in the Southwest of France. Following the Lilium Jet&CloseCurlyQuote;s planned first flight in early 2025, Lilium anticipated receiving pre-delivery payments and new investment to finance the company into 2026 when the company expected delivery would begin on its current order pipeline consisting of firm orders, reservations, options, and memoranda of understanding for more than 780 Lilium Jets to operators in the U.S., South America, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.\nSupporting the insolvency proceedings is now the top priority for Lilium. Customers, employees and suppliers will be notified by the company as soon as possible.\nSelf-administration, if and when granted by the court, aims to preserve and continue the business that is the subject of the proceedings. Management would retain control and would continue operating the business under the supervision of a custodian. The procedure is often used to initiate investment by new parties or a process to sell the company&CloseCurlyQuote;s assets and/or business as a whole. In Germany, the procedure is generally perceived as providing an improved chance for a successful in-court business restructuring.\n“We deeply regret the insolvency and its consequences for all stakeholders at such a crucial stage of our company&CloseCurlyQuote;s development,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; CEO Klaus Roewe said. “However, while there is no guarantee for success in insolvency proceedings, we hope that the Lilium Jet will get a chance for a fresh start after the self-administration process is completed.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;\n“We strongly believe that electric flying is our best hope for the decarbonization of aviation,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; Klaus Roewe added.\nDirectly impacted by the filing are Lilium GmbH and Lilium eAircraft GmbH. Plans for affected stakeholders and the operational implementation of the necessary measures will be shared in the coming days after the filing and related procedures have been launched.\nLilium Contact information for media:\nRainer Ohler\n+49 1724890353\nRainer.ohler@seniorstrategists.com\npress@lilium.com\nLilium Contact information for investors:\nRama Bondada\nVice President, Investor Relations\ninvestors@lilium.com\nAbout Lilium\nLilium (NASDAQ: LILM) is creating a sustainable and accessible mode of high-speed, regional transportation for people and goods.

    "text": "Fox News California bill would mandate all new cars have device to 'automatically limit' speed to 10 mph over limit Andrew Miller January 25, 2024 at 10:33 PM · 2 min read Link Copied Read full article\nA California Democratic lawmaker has introduced a bill he calls \"groundbreaking\" that would require all new cars sold in the Golden State to be equipped with a device preventing them from traveling more than 10 mph over the speed limit.\nState Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat from San Francisco, introduced the Speeding and Fatality Emergency Reduction on California Streets Package this week that includes a provision that would require \"new vehicles sold in California\" to \"install speed governors, smart devices that automatically limit the vehicle’s speed to 10 miles above the legal limit.\"\n\"These changes are a head-on attempt to tackle vehicle fatalities, which are surging across the U.S. — and especially in California — amid a rise in reckless driving since the onset of the pandemic,\" a press release from Wiener’s office explained. \"A recent report from TRIP, a national transportation research group, found that traffic fatalities in California have increased by 22% from 2019 to 2022, compared to 19% for the U.S. overall. In 2022, 4,400 Californians died in car crashes.\"\nThe bill package also \"requires side underride guards on trucks, to reduce the risk of cars and bikes being pulled underneath the truck during a crash\" and \"physical improvements like new crosswalks and curb extensions on state-owned surface streets to better accommodate pedestrians, cyclists, the disability community, and transit users.\"\nWHY SELF-DRIVING CARS ARE ABLE TO COMPLETELY BREAK THE RULES IN THIS CALIFORNIA CITY\nCalifornia State Sen. Scott Wiener.\nThe press release argues that these changes are meant to \"slash\" the \"California road deaths epidemic.\"\nREAD ON THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"The alarming surge in road deaths is unbearable and demands an urgent response,\" Wiener said. \"There is no reason for anyone to be going over 100 miles per hour on a public road, yet in 2020, California Highway Patrol issued over 3,000 tickets for just that offense. Preventing reckless speeding is a commonsense approach to prevent these utterly needless and heartbreaking crashes.\"\nWALL STREET JOURNAL BASHES CALIFORNIA FOR GAS CAR BAN, ASKS WHY AMERICANS CAN'T BUY THE CARS 'THEY WANT'\nA view of the California State Capitol in Sacramento on Feb. 1, 2023.\nNot everyone is on board with the legislation, including social media users who expressed frustration with the plan.\n\"Imagine an empty highway in the middle of the night and you can only go 65,\" author Richard Hanania posted on X.\n\"Just when you thought California couldn't possibly get any crazier,\" former San Diego County Board of Supervisors candidate Amy Reichert posted on X.\nA spokesperson for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration told Fox News Digital the agency \"does not comment on pending legislation.\"\nOriginal article source: California bill would mandate all new cars have device to 'automatically limit' speed to 10 mph over limit\nView comments",

    "title": "Biden in Denial When Doocy Confronts Him About Kamala Harris' Plans: 'She's Not Going To'",
    "text": "[Commentary](https://www.westernjournal.com/commentary/) Biden in Denial When Doocy Confronts Him About Kamala Harris' Plans: 'She's Not Going To' If President Joe Biden says it, believe the opposite. Speaking to the press outside the White House on Thursday, Biden encountered Fox News’ Peter Doocy, who asked about a report that Vice President and 2024 Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris intends to distance herself from Biden’s economic record. “She’s not going to,” Biden tersely replied in a clip posted to the social media platform X. Doocy referred to an [Axios](https://axios.com/2024/08/14/kamala-harris-economy-inflation) report claiming that [Harris](https://www.westernjournal.com/kamala-harris-set-begin-highly-choreographed-flip-flop-key-issues-report/) plans a “highly choreographed” pivot away from Bidenomics. In fact, the Fox News correspondent’s question sounded somewhat calculated to irk the irritable octogenarian president. “How much does it bother you,” Doocy asked, “that Vice President Harris might soon, for political reasons, start to distance herself from your economic record?” Biden quickly refuted the suggestion and then, with his trademark look of perpetual befuddlement, moved along to another reporter. 🚨 Biden confirms Kamala is tethered to his HIGHLY UNPOPULAR, INFLATION-INDUCING, MASSIVE FAILURE known as “Bidenomics” [pic.twitter.com/BGP5hD15nt] — RNC Research (@RNCResearch) [August 15, 2024] Biden later [joined Harris](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-harris-hold-1st-joint-event-dropped-touting/story?id=112859079) in Maryland for their first appearance together since Democratic Party elites staged a [coup](https://www.westernjournal.com/insiders-biden-isnt-telling-truth-feels-obama-pelosi-pushed-race/), forcing Biden out of the presidential race and [installing](https://www.westernjournal.com/black-lives-matter-turns-democratic-party-kamala-harris-installed-nominee/) the vice president as their nominee — all with no input from voters. Thus, in public, the president played the good soldier — not the [lying dog-faced pony soldier](https://www.westernjournal.com/biden-takes-dog-faced-pony-soldier-routine-abroad-bizarre-press-conference-ends-saying-gonna-go-bed/), but the good one. Behind the scenes, however, one wonders about possible tensions between the Biden and Harris camps. For instance, at a press conference on Wednesday, Doocy asked White House press secretary [Karine Jean-Pierre](https://www.westernjournal.com/awkward-karine-jean-pierre-throws-wrench-kamala-harris-attempt-distance-biden/) about the report that Harris would try to distance herself from Biden’s record. Tellingly, Jean-Pierre reminded Doocy of Harris’ role as vice president in the Biden-Harris administration. The press secretary also explicitly connected Harris to Bidenomics. One does not answer as Jean-Pierre did unless one a) committed a strategic error, or b) resents the vice president. Furthermore, on social media and on the campaign trail, former President [Donald Trump](https://www.westernjournal.com/kamala-harris-steal-nomination-biden-scary-election-scenario-reality-according-trump/) has repeatedly and perhaps half-jokingly tweaked the president by suggesting that Biden might crash next week’s Democratic National Convention in Chicago and demand the nomination. Trump asks if Joe Biden is going to crash the DNC convention and try to take back the nomination and challenge him to another debate 🤣 [pic.twitter.com/9BCebhGuwS] — Benny Johnson (@bennyjohnson) [August 6, 2024] Here is a clip of Trump telling rally-goers the same thing last week: Donald Trump on Joe Biden: “They forced him out — it was a coup… I hear he’s going to make a comeback at the Democrat Convention, he’s going to walk into the room and say ‘I want my presidency back I want another chance to debate Trump’.” [pic.twitter.com/nw9o9qahBZ] — ALX 🇺🇸 (@alx) [August 10, 2024] Crashing the convention might sound a bit far-fetched. But Trump probably struck a nerve with his erstwhile rival. After all, Biden has exposed himself as a bitter and unrepentant [tyrant](https://www.westernjournal.com/watch-tucker-carlson-takes-aim-wannabe-dictator-joe-biden-latest-twitter-show/) to his rotten core. Thus, pay no attention to what the president says. The truth always lies elsewhere. In this case, the truth is that Biden’s quiet animosity toward Democrats who torpedoed his campaign almost certainly will fester. ",

Un movimento che rientra nell'azione nazionale prevista per quella giornata, in seguito ai vari annunci del governo.\n“È piuttosto raro che questa interunione sia così ampia”, indica Guillaume Arruat, segretario dipartimentale della FSU. Ci sentiamo a disagio perché siamo ancora meno riconosciuti nella nostra professione. Per noi fa parte dell'attuale attacco agli insegnanti. Vogliamo evidenziare le nostre condizioni di lavoro. Vale a dire i 4.000 posti di lavoro soppressi, la perdita di potere d'acquisto e i tre giorni di attesa. Queste tre misure avranno un impatto ancora maggiore su questo lavoro e i genitori si troveranno con condizioni di apprendimento degradate per i loro figli. »\nMinistri in superficie\n“Genitori, funzionari eletti e insegnanti, siamo tutti preoccupati per il deterioramento delle condizioni di lavoro e di apprendimento degli studenti. Per noi di ingiunzioni contraddittorie ce ne sono già abbastanza. Da un lato ci viene chiesto di alzare il livello (è l’atto II dello shock della conoscenza che si annuncia), dall’altro ci troviamo con tagli di posti di lavoro, che significa quindi, per il primo livello, il doppio o il triplo livelli, con necessariamente più studenti nelle classi, compresi gli studenti portatori di disabilità. »\nNei sindacati paragoniamo la situazione della scuola a quella dell’ospedale, del settore educativo alla disgregazione del sistema sanitario, “con un valzer di ministri in superficie. Ci chiediamo se comprendono la realtà di cosa significhi essere di classe. Da due anni il Lot-et-Garonne è costretto a creare posti, continua Guillaume Arruat, e quando gli insegnanti sono assenti non possono essere sostituiti. »\nGiovedì 5 dicembre, oltre all'invocazione di sciopero, a partire dalle 14 si svolgerà una manifestazione in Place Jasmin.",

    "title": "About France's nuclear vitality disaster - 2024-06-27 21:30:59",
    "text": "/ world in the present day information/ Obeying incompetent inexperienced insurance policies, the nation is ruining its vitality sector\nSummer season 2023 in France was marked by nationwide water conservation. The Water Sobriety Plan (plan de sobriété sur l’eau) was introduced by the President of the Fifth Republic on the finish of March. Emmanuel Macron has urged ministries, companies and even peculiar farmers to cut back water consumption by ten p.c to guard the nationwide economic system from the results of one other drought and strange warmth.\nMacron’s plan induced a stunning response amongst nuclear vitality specialists even on the stage of its preparation. The Workplace of Statistics and Analysis (SDES) of the Ministry of Environmental Transition has recalculated the water consumption of French nuclear energy crops, decreasing it by 3 times.\n„ Reactor cooling water consumption is now estimated at round 0.5 billion cubic meters per 12 months, in comparison with round 1.7 billion within the earlier estimate, decreasing the share of nuclear vitality from 31% to 12% of whole French consumption.” SDES introduced on the day Macron introduced the “water sobriety” plan.\nOfficers from the Ministry of Environmental Transition stated that they had diminished the estimate of water consumption by French nuclear energy crops in shut cooperation with vitality specialists.\nNevertheless, the discount in water consumption at France’s nuclear energy crops has exacerbated the disaster within the nation’s nuclear business.\nNearly 70% of electrical energy in France is generated by nuclear energy crops. Immediately, 19 French nuclear energy crops with their 56 energy items generate three quarters of all electrical energy within the nation and supply work for 40 thousand folks. France ranks first on this planet by way of the share of nuclear vitality within the nation’s vitality stability and second in absolute quantity of electrical energy produced by nuclear energy crops.\nThe period of the peaceable atom in France was inaugurated by Charles de Gaulle, who established the Commissariat of Atomic Vitality, headed by Nobel laureate Frédéric Joliot-Curie. In 1948, the primary French heavy water nuclear reactor was launched.\nAfter the oil disaster of 1973, the emphasis on nuclear vitality grew to become a precedence in France. French Prime Minister Pierre Mesmer launched an bold initiative to construct 13 nuclear energy crops to realize the nation’s vitality independence.\nThe federal government meant to make the most of France’s benefits – developed business, scientific base and expertise gained throughout the navy nuclear program. The development of nuclear energy crops is undertaken by the state-owned firm Électricité de France (EDF). Plans embrace the development of about 170 energy items by the 12 months 2000 and an virtually full transition to nuclear energy.\nNevertheless, after France got here below intense stress from the European “inexperienced foyer”, it needed to give up its “nuclear” positions below the stress of a bloc of “anti-nuclear” international locations led by Germany, Austria and Luxembourg.\nIn 2012, French President François Hollande proposed decreasing the share of nuclear vitality in vitality manufacturing from 75% to 50% by 2025. In 2015, the Nationwide Meeting adopted the corresponding legislation. Already in 2016, 20 out of 58 nuclear energy items have been shut down, resulting in an increase in electrical energy costs in France and neighboring international locations the place extra electrical energy was exported.\nIn coming to energy, Macron continued Hollande’s line of abandoning nuclear energy. In 2018, he introduced that the nation would shut down 14 nuclear reactors with a capability of 900 MW by 2035.\nNot a single new nuclear reactor has been inbuilt France within the twenty first century. A lot of the working French nuclear energy crops have been constructed within the late Seventies and early Eighties; the lifetime of the reactor was initially deliberate to be 30-40 years, however it has already been prolonged twice by 10 years every. In the end your complete fleet of nuclear energy crops should be decommissioned, and France has no substitute capability.\nAnd the French have forgotten easy methods to construct new nuclear energy crops with out defects and exceeding deadlines and estimates. The final nuclear energy plant challenge – two items of the Flamanville NPP put into operation and one below building – was accompanied by critical accidents. The launch of the third unit is consistently delayed.\nThe estimate has lengthy outgrown itself, the deadline for placing the location into operation was prolonged and repeatedly postponed. The corporate constructing the brand new reactor, Framatome, not too long ago stated it will not be operational till the primary quarter of 2024, however business analysts doubt that.\nYears of neglect by the nuclear business have resulted in quite a lot of French nuclear reactors affected by “stress corrosion” of their welds. In 2019, the French Nuclear Security Company (ASN) throughout an inspection of French nuclear energy crops discovered that “issues have been present in steam mills in twenty nuclear reactors: the welding zones of the steam boilers are harmful and may result in the destruction of the generator.”\nIt was not potential to take away rust from the steam pipes with out shutting down the nuclear energy plant, and in Might 2022 the top of the nation’s Nuclear Security Authority (ASN), Bernard Doroshchuk, advised BFM tv that shutting down the reactors can be crucial and fixing the issues would take years. “At this stage, because of stress corrosion, the vitality company EDF has stopped or prolonged the deliberate outages of 12 reactors for a radical evaluation and, if crucial, repairs,” he emphasised.\nDoroshchuk added that the welds that go to the tubes of the reactor’s emergency cooling system are lined in rust. He warned that corrosion could cause cracks to type. The corrosion was discovered on comparatively new reactors manufactured by the American Westinghouse Electrical Firm and was not associated to steel growing old.\nFrom 1974 to 1982, 16 Westinghouse Electrical PWR (pressurized water reactor) energy items have been put in in French nuclear energy crops. In Might 2022, greater than half of French nuclear energy crops have been shut down as a result of discovery of “stress corrosion”, or micro-cracks, close to welds. EDF specialists concluded that each one these defects have been of a structural nature and started repairs on 16 Westinghouse reactors.\nIn current many years, the Russian design bureau Hydroopres (Podolsk) has noticed pipeline failures of energy items all over the world. The main specialist of the corporate, Vladimir Bergunker, notes that Westinghouse repeatedly changed one failed welding alloy with one other, and though the ultimate consequence was damaging, the French used alloys developed by the People as a result of lack of their very own developments.\nEmmanuel Macron has referred to as for a revival of France’s nuclear business in late 2021, saying he needs to construct 14 new reactors. At first of his first time period, nevertheless, Macron pledged to cut back nuclear manufacturing and compelled EDF to close down its two oldest reactors. As well as, Macron, when he was economic system minister, allowed America’s Basic Electrical to grab key nuclear property from France’s Alstom.\nThis led to a deadly lack of technical personnel, and in response to Macron’s name to revive the nuclear business, the top of the French Nuclear Security Authority, Bernard Doroshuk, responded that this required a brand new “Marshall Plan”, i.e. help from the US. The French authorities responded by hiring 100 Westinghouse welders to restore its nuclear energy crops.\nThe issues of nuclear energy within the Fifth Republic are additionally associated to an over-reliance on disposable cooling reactors, which take water from the river after which return virtually all of it again to the river. By the best way, in Russia for greater than 15 years the Water Code has prohibited the usage of water for direct cooling of nuclear energy crops.\nThis is the reason all new nuclear energy plant items constructed throughout this time have been constructed with cooling towers to chill the reactor water. Even the Leningrad NPP-2, positioned on the coast of the Gulf of Finland, makes use of cooling towers.\nThroughout final summer time’s warmth wave, quite a lot of French nuclear energy crops have been shut down as a result of the temperature of the water discharged into the river exceeded environmental requirements.\nFrance’s peaceable nuclear issues have been exacerbated in January 2022 by Macron’s opportunistic resolution to drive EDF to promote electrical energy at a loss in an try to safe mass help for the presidential election.\nThis complete tangle of issues casts doubt on Macron’s bold plans to revive the nation’s nuclear energy business. By the best way, the French media don’t write a phrase about how Macron’s plan for “water sobriety” was applied.\nTranslation: ES\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel:\nand for the channel in Telegram:\nShare in your profiles, with buddies, in teams and on pages.
