Agnes Dawidowicz, 42, and her son Charlie Dawidowicz, 3, were discovered unresponsive in a vehicle parked at their residence on the 2100 block of Barley Drive on Sunday, June 8, authorities said. They were pronounced dead at the scene around 5 p.m. on Sunday, June 8. The causes and manners of death remain under investigation, according to the coroner’s office.

    "text": "Momento di fuga e di relax per la bellissima Belen Rodriguez . Infatti, in questi giorni la showgirl è partita insieme alla sua famiglia con destinazione Argentina ! Più precisamente, nella sua bellissima e gigantesca villa in un’esclusiva zona residenziale nella provincia di Buenos Aires. Infatti, per arrivare all’abitazione è necessario percorrere in auto una via alberata sul quale affacciano numerose altre abitazioni lussuose. Insieme alla modella, durante questo soggiorno nel Paese natale ci sono anche i genitori, Veronica e Gustavo, e la sorella Cecilia con il compagno Ignazio Moser . Chissà se il calore e l’affetto della famiglia riusciranno almeno per un po’ ad alleviare le preoccupazioni di Belen, in particolare quelle più recenti legate all’ex compagno Antonio Spinalbese .\nBelen Rodriguez furiosa con Spinalbese: “Occupati di tua figlia e non nominarmi mai più”\nBelen Rodriguez, la sua villa in Argentina: le foto su Instagram\n“Ho comprato questa casa quando avevo 24 anni”, racconta Belen mentre apre il portone della grande villa. La showgirl ci tiene a documentare il suo arrivo nella casa e a condividere le immagini sul proprio profilo Instagram. E quello che vediamo è senz’altro da sogno! Una volta giunti alla casa c’è un grande portico che ripara il portone d’ingresso e un prato verde intorno al vialetto. All’interno della casa, i soffitti sono altissimi e le finestre strette e lunghe, da vera villa di lusso. Le stanze, in particolare la cucina e il salotto-sala da pranzo open space, hanno grandi porte di vetro che affacciano sul giardino con una splendida piscina. Pezzo forte della casa? Il grande parco che la circonda. Non sono ancora state mostrate tutte le stanze della casa, ma restiamo connessi per vedere se Belen, nei prossimi giorni, ci svelerà altre parti della sua amata casa.\nBelen Rodriguez, nessuna pietà: arriva l’unfollow anche per Stefano\nBelen Rodriguez, fuga in Argentina con i figli: un momento per staccare dopo la lite social con Antonino Spinalbese\nSono circolate molte voci ultimamente in merito al rapporto tra Belen e l’ex compagno e padre di Luna Marie, Antonino Spinalbese. Proprio nei giorni scorsi, i due hanno reso ben palese quanto tra loro non scorra buon sangue e il motivo sarebbe proprio l’affidamento della piccola Luna. Infatti, Spinalbese ha sostenuto di non essere riuscito a passare nemmeno un giorno di queste vacanze di Natale insieme alla figlia, aggiungendo anche non essere stato messo al corrente del viaggio che avrebbe dovuto affrontare la piccola per arrivare in Argentina con la madre Belen. Accuse a cui la showgirl ha duramente risposto pubblicando dei post sfogo in merito.\nAntonio Spinalbese parla ancora di Belén: “Credevo fosse una vita felice ma non era così”",

    "title": "Bar/Bat Mitzvah: A rite of passage and source of joy",
    "text": "Bar/Bat Mitzvah: A rite of passage and source of joy I begin by extending warm wishes to those readers currently celebrating their most solemn and important religious holidays; to Christians I wish a blessed Easter, and to Muslims a Ramadan kareem and Ramadan Mubarak (a generous and blessed Ramadan). My themes for this column have often related to Jewish holidays, but since our observance of Passover this year is delayed by a month due to this being a leap year on our calendar, I have chosen instead to write about a familiar pair of life-cycle ceremonies – bar mitzvah (for boys) and bat mitzvah (for girls) – rites of passage which mark a young person’s transition to maturity. In the Torah, adulthood began at age 20. This is when men were registered in the censuses that Moses conducted during the Israelites’ journey to the Promised Land, and it was the age when they became eligible for military service. However, for the rabbis of the Talmud, the age at which a young person was considered an adult was 13 for a boy and 12 for a girl, the time when their bodies began to show signs of physical maturity. In the Judaism of the rabbis, mitzvah meaning “commandment” is a fundamental religious concept embracing all of the obligations incumbent upon a Jewish person – both positive and negative (“thou shalt” and “thou shalt not”), and focusing on both observance of rituals and living an ethical life. Bar and bat mitzvah literally translated as “son/daughter of commandment” refers to one who is responsible for observing the commandments of the Torah. When a child attains the age of bar/bat mitzvah, it is he or she rather than their parents who are now held accountable for any sins or lapses they commit. For boys turning 13 meant not only accountability for their actions but the ability to take on an active role in the rituals of the synagogue, leading the congregation in prayer and participating in the reading of Scripture. The practice developed for a boy on the Sabbath closest to his 13th birthday to chant a section of the Torah portion read that day as well as the day’s reading from the Prophets and then to deliver a discourse on the meaning of the passages he had read. If a young man was more capable, he might read the entire portion for the day rather than just a section; and sometimes, a boy might mark becoming a bar mitzvah not on the Sabbath but at Monday or Thursday morning prayers, days when the Torah is also read. The bar mitzvah ceremony as we know it probably goes back several hundred years. Parents would provide refreshments for the congregation and guests following the service, and the young man would receive some modest gifts. The standard bar mitzvah speech invariably included the words, “today I am a man,” but I have always felt that a bar mitzvah ceremony at age 13 is a relic of a time when marriage took place in one’s late teens, when schooling and preparation for a career were not such a long and protracted commitment, and when a young man often entered the work force in his early teens. In today’s world, a 13-year-old is still developing emotionally and intellectually; he or she still has much to learn and to understand. As a celebration marking the onset of the teen years, the bar or bat mitzvah ceremony still has an important place in the Jewish life cycle, but it should be viewed as the transition to rather than the attainment of adulthood and as the beginning rather than the completion of learning about one’s faith tradition. Reform Judaism in the 19th-century replaced bar mitzvah with Confirmation, a group ceremony for both boys and girls at age 15 or 16, usually held on Shavuot, the late springtime festival celebrating the giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai. Today most Reform congregations have brought back the bar mitzvah ceremony, which along with Confirmation is now a regular feature of congregational life. Bat mitzvah ceremonies for girls were instituted by Rabbi Mordecai Kaplan, a daring and innovative Jewish teacher and thinker, in 1922. At the synagogue where he served, much to the shock of his traditionally minded mother and mother-in-law, he called up his daughter Judith to the pulpit and had her read from the Scriptures to the congregation. The bat mitzvah ceremony took some time to catch on in other congregations, but since the 1960s and 1970s it has become universally accepted in Reform and Conservative synagogues. Additionally, it has become common for adults, who, for one reason or another, did not get to have a bar or bat mitzvah at age 12 or 13, to prepare for and have one at a later age, either as individuals or part of a group. As a rite of passage, the bar/bat mitzvah teaches the young person skills necessary to participate in and lead our religious rituals and assures us elders that our faith tradition will be carried on. It was a joy and a source of pride for me as a parent and years later as a grandparent to witness the b’nai mitzvah of a son, a granddaughter, and a grandson and to lead the services on those occasions.

    "text": "Veteran Ellyse Perry played a special knock on her 300th International game as her 34 runs ensured that the visitors stay alive in the series. Apart from Perry, Alyssa Healy Beth Mooney and Phoebe Litchfield played decent knocks for the visiting side on Sunday (January 7). Speaking about the first innings, Deepti Sharma top-scored for the home side as she scored 30 runs. Smriti Mandhana and Richa Ghosh also got decent starts with the bat but they failed to make a big score. As a result, Harmanpreet Kaur and Co. posted 130 runs in their allotted 20 overs.

So for us to come back and put in such a bowling effort there in the first innings and it was a difficult chase, but nice to finish. Phoebe in the end there was sensational,” said Ellyse Perry after the match.",

    "text": "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine on Thursday condemned the use of photos of the consequences of the war of Russia against Ukraine in a political ad in Georgia, said a message published on the ministry's website and quoted by \"Ukrinform\". \"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine condemns as unacceptable the use in political advertising of photographs of the terrible consequences of Russia's merciless war against Ukraine, the suffering and blood of thousands of innocent people, the destruction of religious shrines and cultural heritage,'' said the the ministry. Ukrainian diplomats called on the government of Georgia, the ruling party \"Georgian Dream\" and all interested parties to refrain from exploiting the theme of the aggressive war waged against Ukraine and its citizens in the internal political struggle in Georgia. \"The Georgian people should not fear another war while Ukraine resists Russian aggression. The terrible price of this resistance is also the price of peace in Georgia,\" the statement emphasized. The MFA added that Ukraine will consistently, steadfastly and resolutely continue to support the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia within its internationally recognized borders and expressed hope that the parliamentary elections will be held in a peaceful and democratic manner and that the Georgian people will pursue the strategic course towards joining the EU and NATO. The campaign materials of the ruling party \"Georgian Dream\" were condemned by the country's president, Salome Zurabishvili, as \"shameful and offensive to culture, traditions, history and faith\". We remind you that the invitation of Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze to a reception for world leaders organized by US President Joe Biden during the UN General Assembly was withdrawn. According to reports, the reason is \"anti-democratic actions, disinformation and negative rhetoric\" by the Georgian government towards the US and the West. Although Georgia has traditionally been pro-Western and has been a major recipient of American aid since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, relations between the country and Western powers have soured in recent months. The main reason is accusations of authoritarian and pro-Russian tendencies in the governance of Georgia, especially after the adoption of a law on \"foreign agents\" inspired by Russian legislation. In July, the EU also froze around 30 million euros in military aid to Georgia. The European Union will reduce political contacts with Georgia and consider freezing financial aid to the government after it pushed through the controversial \"foreign agents\" law, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said in June. Georgian officials indicated that Kobakhidze was initially invited to the event, but the US subsequently declined any meetings with his delegation. In response, the speaker of the parliament, Shalva Papuashvili, called the decision \"frivolous\".",

    "text": "Zu gewagt: Schlagerstar erhält bei „Immer wieder sonntags“ Song-Verbot\nEklat bei Stefan Mross: Ein Schlagersänger durfte seinen neuen Song bei „Immer wieder sonntags“ nicht singen, denn der Text war dem Sender zu gewagt.\nRust – Vincent Gross (28) ist einer der erfolgreichsten Schweizer Schlagerstars der Gegenwart. Der gebürtige Basler hat sich in den letzten Jahren mit Hits wie „Ouzo“ und „Rum“ einen Namen in der deutschen Schlagerszene gemacht und ist regelmäßiger Gast in den großen TV-Shows.\nVincent Gross erklärt Grund für Song-Verbot bei „Immer wieder sonntags“\nDoch was am vergangenen Sonntag (13. Juli) bei der Unterhaltungsshow passierte, sorgt nun für heftige Diskussionen. Vincent Gross wollte dem „Immer wieder sonntags“-Publikum eine besondere Überraschung bereiten und seinen brandneuen Song „Camping“ zum ersten Mal live performen. Nach der Generalprobe kam jedoch die Hiobsbotschaft: Der SWR verbot den Auftritt, berichtete unter anderem schlagerprofis.de.\nAuch Vincent Gross selbst meldete sich zu dem Vorfall zu Wort und erklärte auf seiner Instagramseite: „Mir wurde gerade vom SWR ein Song verboten, weil er zu anzüglich ist. Ich war bei ‚Immer wieder sonntags‘ und wollte einen neuen Überraschungssong performen, der ‚Camping‘ heißt.“ Nach der Generalprobe habe er dann vom Sender die Nachricht erhalten, er könne den Song in der Show nicht singen. Die umstrittene Passage lautet: „Dann rappelts im Karton / Digi-dong, digi-tong / Hast du Lust zu komm‘n / Digi-dong, digi-tong“. Für die Sendungsverantwortlichen war das offenbar zu gewagt. Stattdessen musste Gross auf seinen bereits bekannten Hit „Ouzo“ ausweichen.\nSWR erklärt Vincent Gross‘ Songtausch bei „Immer wieder sonntags“\nAuf Nachfrage von bild.de erklärte der SWR: „Die Redaktion übernimmt und verantwortet die Titelauswahl und achtet darauf, dass Künstler:innen und Lieder zur Sendung passen.“ Vincent Gross‘ Song „Ouzo“ habe laut dem Sender einen „hohen Wiedererkennungswert“ und sei „generationenübergreifend“, weswegen der Schlagersänger anscheinend lieber diesen Song performen sollte.\nIn der „Immer wieder sonntags“-Ausgabe kam es übrigens zu einer Technik-Panne.
