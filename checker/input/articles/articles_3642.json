    "text": "Los Angeles Fire Threatens Mt. Wilson Communication Transmitters\nElon Musk already promised free Starlink terminals.\nThe Eaton fire in Los Angeles has reached Mt. Wilson, which houses communication and broadcast transmitters.\nPolice and firefighters rely on those towers to communicate with each other. The destruction would also affect truck drivers using radios.\nThe majority of LA’s broadcast stations have antennas on Mt. Wilson. From Variety:\nAccording to KCBS/KCAL news, hand crews have arrived at Mt. Wilson to fight the blaze.\nMost of Los Angeles’ TV stations broadcast from Mt.

Venti a oltre 200km/h e piogge torrenziali in arrivo - Video\n1 minuto, 15 secondi\nSull'Oceano Indiano Meridionale è in azione il ciclone tropicale Chido, con la forza equivalente a quella di un uragano di categoria 3 e con raffiche di vento che superano i 200km/h. Nel suo spostamento verso ovest è transitato sulla piccola isola di Agalega, che dista circa 700km dal Madagascar ed è abitata da poco più di 300 abitanti. Si è trattato del sistema tropicale più forte ad aver colpito l'isola dal 1983 (quando vennero distrutte quasi tutte le infrastrutture dell'isola) e lo ha fatto con la forza equivalente a quella di un uragano di categoria 4 nella giornata di giovedì.\nTropical Cyclone Chido: Video of weather conditions in Agal a Island located in the Indian Ocean.\n— RenderNature (@RenderNature)\nVideo captured on Wednesday afternoon (December 11, 2024).\n[: Defi Media][#CycloneChido][#Agal a][pic.twitter.com/46ee1oo2gT][December 12, 2024]\nOra si trova alle coordinate 11.1S 49.9E, ovvero a un centinaio di chilometri a nord della costa settentrionale del Madagascar, dove le condizioni sono in forte peggioramento e si prevedono venti intorno a 200km/h con mareggiate e piogge di forte intensità. Il suo passaggio sarà comunque rapido e nella giornata di sabato transiterà in prossimità dell'isola di Mayotte, nel Canale di Mozambico, per poi dirigersi verso il Mozambico, dove farà landfall nella giornata di domenica.\nTropical Cyclone\n— YouStorm (@YouStormorg)[#Chido]has intensified to category 4 major hurricane strength, a highly dangerous storm with distinct eye.

Successivamente, inoltrandosi nell'entroterra africano, potrà coinvolgere anche lo stato del Malawi all'inizio della prossima settimana, con venti parzialmente indeboliti, ma con piogge di forte intensità e a carattere alluvionale.",

    "text": "A NATO radar plane base in Geilenkirchen, Germany has raised its security level due to an intelligence warning about a potential threat.\nLocated near the German-Dutch border, the base is home to the NATO AWACS (airborne early warning and control systems) force, which became operational in 1988.\n“We raised the security level at NATO Airbase Geilenkirchen based on intelligence information indicating potential threat,” the base announced on its X (formerly Twitter) account on Thursday evening.\n“All non-mission essential staff have been sent home as a precautionary measure,” the base added. “Operations continue as planned.”\nThe threat level at the base has been raised to Charlie, a spokesperson told Reuters. This is the second-highest of four states of alert, and means there has either been an incident, or intelligence, indicating that some kind of terrorist attack is “highly likely.”\nRead more Potential breach detected at military base of NATO member Geilenkirchen reported an attempted trespassing incident last week that triggered a full security sweep at the base. On the same day, the Wahn barracks, which serve the military part of Cologne Bonn Airport, were put on lockdown as authorities investigated reports that the water supply had been contaminated. Test results later showed no issues with the tap water, however.\nOn Thursday, the authorities launched an investigation after unidentified drones were seen flying over critical infrastructure in the northern part of the country.\nNATO has ramped up warnings about possible sabotage by Russia in recent months, even as it has increased its supply of weapons, ammunition and equipment to Ukraine. The US and its allies have insisted that provisioning Kiev does not make them a party to the conflict, shrugging off Russia’s repeated insistence otherwise.\nYou can share this story on social media: Follow RT on",

Leverages Investment from Elite Fun Entertainment amidst Revenue Slump.\nPublished / Modified Dec 28 2023\nCSIMarket Team / CSIMarket.com\nAllied Gaming & Entertainment,Inc. (NASDAQ: AGAE) is not just a company; it is the harbor of imaginative and immersive entertainment experiences delivered across the globe.By making supreme use of advanced technology and interactive exhibits, AGAE unfailingly presents its clients with a one-of-a-kind entertainment experience that surpasses the conventional norms of amusement. Their quality services have been appreciated far and wide, and they stand as a trusted name in the global entertainment industry.\nOn the other hand, Elite Fun Entertainment Co., an influential purveyor of cultural and theatrical affairs in Macau, is equally distinguished for its prowess in directing live events across Asia, and especially in the thriving area of China's Greater Bay. This expertize has given them a significant position amidst the Asian cultural and entertainment sectors.\nThis investment by Elite Fun Entertainment is viewed as a dynamic collaboration that couples the robust experiential entertainment capacities of AGAE with the live event mastery of the investing company.\nDespite a tough financial quarter for Allied Gaming & Entertainment Inc., which saw a revenue slump of 28.47% YoY in Q3 2023, this move seems to be a well-thought-out play in the grander scheme of things. While most of AGAE's\ncompetitors reported an average revenue surge of 5.38% in the same period, Allied Gaming & Entertainment Inc. managed to attain higher profitability.

    "text": "It might look odd now, but one day in the not-too-distant future, you might not blink twice seeing a robot sit among humans in a school line-up. As part of a robotics incursion at Engadine High School, students got on the artificial intelligence (AI) bandwagon and got close to a robot with very lifelike features. Over 500 students from 16 high schools across the Sutherland Shire and St George have entered an AI Careers Immersion program this year. The initiative, supported by the Regional Industry Education Partnerships program under the NSW Department of Education, equips young people with the essential skills and knowledge to thrive in a rapidly evolving job market. Engadine High School was the first in NSW to welcome G1, a state-of-the-art humanoid robot from Unitree. As companies like BMW increasingly deploy humanoids in manufacturing, students gained hands-on exposure to the cutting edge of AI and robotics. The AI Careers Incursion program prepares students to lead in industries yet to be imagined by fostering lifelong learning and hands-on engagement with transformative technology. Trevor Adams from Regional Industry Education Partnerships emphasised the importance of such initiatives. \"In today&apos;s fast-changing job landscape, connecting students with emerging technologies and local employers as early as possible is key,\" he said. \"We know this has a massive impact on positive outcomes for students. These experiences empower students to explore future career pathways and develop the agility to adapt to evolving industries.\" The program inspired students to think critically about the impact of AI and robotics on their future. Vice Captain of Engadine High School, Holly, said: \"I don&apos;t think the question is, &apos;What jobs can we use the humanoid for?&apos; I think the question is, &apos;What jobs aren&apos;t we going to use the humanoids for?&apos; The pace of technology and diversity of jobs remain the challenge.\" Students interacted with robotic dogs and humanoid robots, diving into AI and Mechatronic Engineering. Tara, a student in the enrichment class, was intrigued. \"I was immediately very excited because the last time robots came to Engadine High with this program, we got to see quadrupeds, and this time it was a bipedal robot, so it was cool to see a humanoid, an advancement that has a lot of unknown potential,\" she said. Another student, Zac, reflected on the robot&apos;s future uses. \"I think it will be useful for things that are too dangerous for humans to do or for it to do things humans don&apos;t want to,\" he said. To further their learning, students completed AI Microskills through the TAFE Institute of Applied Technology, taking their first steps toward becoming part of a workforce ready to embrace AI-driven opportunities. They also secured opportunities to participate in Cyber Security Work Experience, leveraging their knowledge from the program to explore another critical and rapidly growing field. Engadine High School principal Kerrie Jones praised the program. \"Our students and the world they are inheriting are so very different from the world even five years ago,\" she said. We have no idea of the impact of such phenomenal technology. This will also be the next generation&apos;s challenge.\"",
