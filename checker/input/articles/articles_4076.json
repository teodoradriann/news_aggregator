In that case, consuming the recommended dosage of an everyday Berberine supplement may not help.\nHowever, taking Berberine supplements labeled as Berberine hydrochloride may promote improved blood sugar control and induce weight loss benefits efficiently through their high-dose Berberine.\nWe found BerberBurn+ helpful in simultaneously achieving healthy blood pressure and blood sugar levels. Unlike prescription medications, this Berberine supplement didn’t induce any side effects while using pure Berberine HCL to help us manage weight properly.\nWe also call the BerberBurn+ Berberine supplementation one of the best Berberine supplements because it is backed by clinical research, and its high-dose Berberine has helped us achieve all its potential health benefits at a relatively low cost.\nPros Of The BerberBurn+ Berberine Supplement\n- Affordable\n- This is backed by research that studied the clinical effects of Berberine HCL on humans and how BerberBurn+ may be a potent solution.\n- Blended with several natural ingredients that can help in improving insulin sensitivity, weight management, and various other aspects of health\n- Delivered within 3 to 5 days in the USA\nCons Of The BerberBurn+ Berberine Supplement\n- You must consult a healthcare provider before taking the BerberBurn+ Berberine HCL supplement because although several reviews praise its anti-inflammatory properties, some of its past users claim that it may degrade gut health among a small section of people\nNativePath Native Berberine\n- Ingredients: Barberry, Goldenseal, Oregon Grape, etc.\n- Cost:\n- 1-bottle pack: $34\n- 3-bottle pack: $28/bottle\n- 6-bottle pack: $22/bottle\n- Refund Policy: 365-day money-back guarantee\n- Shipping: All orders are shipped for free\nIf no dietary supplement has been able to promote healthy blood sugar levels in your body while enhancing your metabolic health,\nNativePath Native Berberine may suit your needs.\nThis Berberine supplement helped us regulate blood sugar levels by balancing insulin secretion and stimulating our AMP-activated protein kinase pathways.\nDo We Recommend This Berberine Supplement to Promote Metabolic Health and Other Health Benefits?\nWe think that the anti-inflammatory properties of the NativePath Native Berberine supplement can help lower blood sugar levels while promoting effective weight management.\nOur team members consider it the best Berberine supplement for people who want to enjoy weight loss benefits and prevent issues like diabetes at the same time.\nThis high-dose Berberine supplement contains 900 mg of Berberine in its 3-in-1 formula. Over the three months that we consumed the NativePath Native Berberine supplements, none of us had to worry about its Berberine absorption rate, and our gut health surprisingly improved with time.\nPros Of The NativePath Native Berberine Supplements\n- Its dose of 900 mg can help promote benefits like healthier blood sugar levels, faster weight loss, and balanced blood pressure levels among both experienced and beginner users\n- 3-in-1 formula\n- No reported side effects\n- Its capsules are suitable for vegetarians who want to balance blood sugar levels and support optimal metabolic health simultaneously\nCons Of The NativePath Native Berberine Supplements\n- It can only be bought from its official website\nClinical Effects Berberine HCL\n- Ingredients: Berberine HCL\n- Cost:\n- 1-bottle pack: $39\n- 3-bottle pack: $36/bottle\n- 6-bottle pack: $33/bottle\n- Refund Policy: 90-day money-back guarantee\n- Shipping: Orders are shipped to only the USA and Canada\nSuppose you are looking for the best Berberine supplements to promote cardiovascular health, healthier blood sugar levels, effective weight loss, and other health perks such as balanced glucose uptake, glucose metabolism, and liver health. In that case, you might like\nClinical Effects Berberine HCL.\nIt helped us lower insulin resistance and boost metabolic health within a few weeks, and its potent formula is recommended by our healthcare provider as well!\nDo We Recommend This Berberine Supplement to Promote Metabolic Health and Other Health Benefits?\nSince most of our team members enjoyed multiple health benefits of taking the Clinical Effects Berberine HCL supplement, we think that consuming the recommended dosage of this Berberine supplementation can genuinely help one achieve improved metabolic health, faster weight loss, and higher blood sugar control.\nOne of the best things we like about Clinical Effects Berberine HCL is that the cost of the per-serving and per-bottle Berberine dosage can go relatively low when we invest in its subscription.\nSince it uses a gentle formula to help us keep our harmful cholesterol levels in check and reduce symptoms of metabolic syndrome, we recommend this high-quality Berberine supplement to those who struggle to digest new components.\nPros Of The Clinical Effects Berberine HCL Supplements\n- Its per-serving and per-bottle Berberine dosage cost is quite affordable for those who invest in its subscription.\n- Made in the USA\n- Created in an FDA-approved facility\n- May induce benefits like improved liver health and cardiovascular health using a blend of natural and clinically proven ingredients\nCons Of The Clinical Effects Berberine HCL Supplements\n- Only people living in the USA and Canada order Clinical Effects Berberine HCL to support blood sugar management and weight loss in their bodies\nBarton Nutrition Berberine\n- Ingredients: Berberine HCL and Milk Thistle Extract\n- Cost:\n- 1-bottle pack: $67\n- 3-bottle pack: $59/bottle\n- 6-bottle pack: $49/bottle\n- Refund Policy: 365-day money-back guarantee\n- Shipping: Subscription and multi-bottle packs are shipped for free in the USA\nAlthough\nBarton Nutrition Berberine might be a bit more expensive than most Berberine supplements on this list, we find it worth noting that it is way safer than a majority of prescription medications that claim to support blood sugar management among adults.\nWe found Barton Nutrition Berberine to be the best supplement for people who struggle with unhealthy blood glucose and cholesterol levels but have been asked by their healthcare provider not to consume harsh chemical-based products.\nDo We Recommend This Berberine Supplement to Promote Metabolic Health and Other Health Benefits?\nWe came across several online reviews by healthcare experts who suggested taking the recommended dosage of Barton Nutrition Berberine to promote better blood sugar regulation and weight loss perks in their bodies.\nWe bought it since the per-serving cost and features like free shipping of its 6-bottle Berberine dosage pack seemed justified.\nWithin about a month of taking the Barton Nutrition Berberine supplement, we noticed positive changes in cholesterol levels and blood sugar regulation.\nOur bodies found it much easier to enjoy a healthy weight loss journey, and we think that the presence of milk thistle extract increases the absorption rate of Barton Nutrition Berberine. We suggest taking its recommended dosage irrespective of age and gender as long as you’re over 18!\nPros Of The Barton Nutrition Berberine Supplements\n- The per-serving costs of its multi-bottle Berberine dosage packs are decently low.\n- Free shipping is offered on eligible orders.\n- The presence of components like milk thistle helps it get absorbed and induce benefits quickly\n- Safer than prescription medications and most of the other dietary supplements in terms of promoting better blood sugar regulation and weight loss journeys\nCons Of The Barton Nutrition Berberine Supplements\n- Since its formula has 800 mg of Berberine and 105 mg of milk thistle, it may not be suitable for folks who want to enjoy the benefits of consuming pure Berberine\nHealth Nutrition BerbaPrime\n- Ingredients: Berberine HCL\n- Cost:\n- 1-bottle pack: $59.99\n- 2+1-bottle pack: $99.98\n- 3+2-bottle pack: $149.97\n- Refund Policy: 100-day money-back guarantee\n- Shipping: All packages are shipped for free\nIf you have been taking Berberine HCL for quite some time now and require a high dose per serving to experience its maximum effects, you may like consuming the recommended dosage of\nBerbaPrime.\nHealth Nutrition Limited created it in a safe environment, and its 1500 mg dose of Berberine HCL makes it a potent supplement for increasing insulin sensitivity, improving metabolic health, reducing insulin resistance, and balancing cholesterol levels.\nDo We Recommend This Berberine Supplement to Promote Metabolic Health and Other Health Benefits?\nAlthough the best Berberine supplements should, ideally, provide a decently high dose of Berberine HCL per serving – not all of them matched our expectations regarding quality, potency, and purity. However, the pure Berberine HCL pills of Health Nutrition BerbaPrime helped work for us.\nOur team liked that it was suitable for our vegan team members. Its gluten and lactose-free Berberine sulfate formula helped reduce our harmful cholesterol levels within five weeks because of its per-serving dose of 1500 mg Berberine.\nWe were also impressed to see how the specific details of the safety regulations followed during its manufacturing process were listed on its official website. We recommend it to anyone who values purity and potency over factors like price!\nPros Of The Health Nutrition BerbaPrime Berberine Supplements\n- 1500 mg Berberine offered per serving\n- Free shipping in the USA\n- Created in an ISO9001 and GMP-certified facility that follows all the relevant HACCP guidelines\n- Tested by third-lab parties\nCons Of The Health Nutrition BerbaPrime Berberine Supplements\n- It requires you to take three capsules per serving, which may be an inconvenient dose for some people\nDouble Wood Supplements Berberine\n- Ingredients: Berberine HCL\n- Cost:\n- 1-bottle pack: $19.95\n- 2-bottle pack: $34.95\n- 3-bottle pack: $49.95\n- Refund Policy: 30-day money-back guarantee\n- Shipping:\n- US orders are delivered in 5 to 7 days.\n- International orders may take longer to get delivered based on local customs followed by the carriers of your region.\nIf you are new to taking Berberine supplements, we recommend starting with one that provides a low per-serving dose to prevent overwhelming bodily functions.\nDouble Wood Supplements Berberine was one of the first Berberine supplements we tried, and it effectively supported our cardiovascular health and cognitive function.\nIts per-serving dose of 500 mg started increasing our energy levels and balancing our blood sugar within a few weeks, and our hearts felt much healthier within about two months.\nDo We Recommend This Berberine Supplement to Promote Metabolic Health and Other Health Benefits?\nWe recommend Double Wood Supplements Berberine over other Berberine supplements because even with its low per-serving dose of 500 mg, it worked just as efficiently as some of the best Berberine supplements on the market for us.\nOur team was impressed with how its official website provided access to its certificate of analysis and third-party lab results.\nAnother thing we liked about Double Wood Supplements Berberine is that there is no fixed time to consume it. While we took it in the morning with breakfast, you may take it at night, too, if that’s more convenient.\nThe only catch is that you must consume Double Wood Supplements Berberine with a meal to absorb it efficiently. We recommend It primarily for beginners and those who prefer a low per-serving dose of Berberine.\nPros Of The Double Wood Supplements Berberine Supplements\n- Low per-serving cost\n- Transparent clinical trials and third-party lab results\n- Strong manufacturing practices\n- Warm customer support service\nCons Of The Double Wood Supplements Berberine Supplements\n- You must not consume this dietary supplement if you take other medicines\nRenue By Science Lipo Berberine\n- Ingredients: Berberine HCL\n- Cost: $49.95\n- Refund Policy: 60-day refund/replacement guarantee\n- Shipping: All orders over $50 are shipped for free in the USA\nAlthough Berberine is a practical component for lowering cholesterol levels, improving metabolic health, and so on, it must be consumed with a meal if you want it to be absorbed quickly.\nHowever, some of our team members didn’t have the time to do so, so we decided to purchase\nRenue By Science Lipo Berberine. Since it comes with a patented liposomal technology, we didn’t have to worry about what its Berberine might do to our digestive tract.\nDo We Recommend This Berberine Supplement to Promote Metabolic Health and Other Health Benefits?\nAlthough Renue By Science Lipo Berberine provides just 250 mg of Lipo Berberine per serving, we recommend it to people who want to ensure that their digestive tract doesn’t suffer any adverse effects, even when they don’t take their Berberine pills with a meal.\nOur team was impressed to see how a single bottle of Renue By Science Lipo Berberine can last up to 3 months since it comes with 90 vegetarian capsules and its recommended dosage is one pill per day.\nLike almost every other product by Renue By Science, we weren’t surprised to see how Renue By Science Lipo Berberine may be better for those who want to invest in bulk packages.\nAlthough we would have liked it if its Berberine dose was a little higher, it helped our team members improve blood sugar levels, metabolic health, cardiovascular health, and cognitive function decently.\nPros Of The Renue By Science Lipo Berberine Supplements\n- Low per-serving cost\n- 1 Renue By Science Lipo Berberine bottle can last you up to 3 months\n- Created in FDA-registered and GMP-certified facilities\n- Its patented liposome technology promotes better absorption\nCons Of Renue By Science Lipo Berberine Supplements\n- There is no option to buy a 30-day supply of Renue By Science Lipo Berberine\nFinal Verdict: What Berberine Supplements Are Right For You?\nSince tree turmeric has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for several decades, we are unsurprised that many people want to use the best Berberine supplement today.\nWhile the right Berberine supplement might vary from one person to another, we found the above options worthy of consideration.\nIf you are looking for a high-dose formula, Health Nutrition BerbaPrime may suit you. On the other hand, we found Clinical Effects Berberine HCL Supplements to be the most affordable and Renue By Science Lipo Berberine Supplements to be the safest from our picks.\nChoose the best Berberine supplement that fits your needs and preferences well!\nAffiliate Disclosure:\nThe links contained in this product review may result in a small commission if you opt to purchase the product recommended at no additional cost to you.

    "title": "Torrington's Trinity Episcopal approved to run homeless shelter",
    "text": "Trinity Episcopal Church on Prospect Street in Torrington on Dec. 27 received approval to run a winter homeless shelter. TORRINGTON — A homeless shelter was approved for Trinity Episcopal Church Wednesday, ending the search for a location that has continued since early spring. During a public hearing, members of the Planning & Zoning Commission heard repeatedly that the shelter plan could no longer wait, and that the city's homeless wouldn't survive much longer without help. Trinity provided shelter for people facing homelessness, pre-pandemic, along with several other churches. Its pastor, the Rev. Carrie Combs, presented the church's application this week. Trinity's receiving approval for a special permit comes just a week after the commission denied an application to run the shelter at Northwest Hills Community Church, also on Prospect Street but next door to St. John Paul the Great Academy, a K-8 Catholic school. Northwest Hills Community Church applied for the special exception permit in November, and immediately faced objections from the school and parish, led by Pastor Emmanuel Ihemedu, who said that Operation Overflow's homeless shelter running adjacent to the school would endanger and traumatize the students. Since early 2023, a group of care providers overseeing the shelter operations, along with Mayor Elinor Carbone, have been seeking a building for Operation Overflow. Before the pandemic, the effort was run by volunteers and rotated between three churches, including Trinity and Northwest Hills, for 16 years. Since 2020, supported by state funding, the winter shelter has operated at a closed school and a health center. This week, supporters of the shelter were in the majority at the commission meeting, and all said the shelter was desperately needed. \"Our unhoused residents are just as deserving as everyone else,\" wrote Julia Jagger, who works with people through Greenwoods Counseling and other groups. Julie Scharnberg from the Northwest Hills Connecticut Community Foundation, said there was a \"significant bottleneck\" of people facing homelessness, in spite of having a state voucher to obtain housing of their own. \"They can't use them (the vouchers) because they can't find people who will accept them,\" she said, adding that a growing population of seniors are also facing homelessness, because they live on fixed incomes and can't afford housing. During the public's testimony, resident Rich Rivera asked the commission and Carbone if the city was thinking ahead to avoid this year's difficulties. \"What are we trying to achieve here?\" he said. \"What do we want for the homeless; what's the ideal place?\" City Planner Jeremy Leifert, who attended the hearing, said a shelter should be in a building that's suitable for a group home. \"We're going to work on our regulations in the spring, to make it less restrictive,\" he said. Resident Allyson Schanz urged the board to grant the permit. \"It's cold, it's raining, and it's inhumane to allow these mothers (and children), fathers, veterans (not to have shelter),\" she said. \"They don't deserve to be treated as less than.\" The commissioners approved the permit unanimously after closing the hearing. Carbone told the audience that the City Council was prepared to provide up to $40,000 to help with operations and other expenses, using funds from the city's money from the federal American Rescue Plan Act. \"There's a definite need for this,\" Mele said. \"We need to fix this problem going forward. Without the funding and support from the mayor, this wouldn't be happening.\"",

    "title": "My Turn: Project 2025 — Republicans’ anti-democratic agenda for America",
    "text": "My Turn: Project 2025 — Republicans’ anti-democratic agenda for America\n|Published: 06-27-2024 5:42 PM|\nTo know what’s coming if Donald Trump wins the fall election, check out\nProject 2025, the extreme right’s policy agenda and plan of action for the next Republican president. The Heritage Foundation produced Project 2025 with support from a coalition of over 100 right-wing organizations.\nProject 2025’s policy agenda includes banning abortion pills and limiting access to contraception nationwide, gutting programs to help poor and low-income mothers feed and care for their children, pressuring single mothers to marry, rolling back Title IX protections against sexual harassment and assault at educational institutions, and eliminating LGBTQ rights.\nProject 2025 would also remove environmental and labor protections, shut U.S. borders and round up and deport immigrants, make draconian cuts to Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security, and so much more.\n“Project 2025 is a far-right manifesto and blueprint for Trump and Republicans to enact widespread, wholesale policy violence on everyone who calls America home,” says U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass. “We must call that out and use every congressional tool to push back and prevent this harmful agenda from becoming reality.”\nProject 2025 includes “four pillars”: a 920-page policy agenda; a presidential personnel database of vetted conservatives; a Presidential Administration Academy to train these people to achieve the Project 2025 policy goals; and a 180-day playbook, which is what they hope to achieve in the first 180 days if Trump takes office in January 2025.\n“It is not enough for conservatives to win elections,” says the Project 2025 website. “If we are going to rescue the country from the grip of the radical Left, we need both a governing agenda and the right people in place, ready to carry this agenda out on Day One of the next conservative Administration.”\nTheir plan is to fundamentally reshape the executive branch of the federal government by replacing nonpartisan civil servants with trained ideologues to carry out their radical agenda.\nDespite a longstanding American tradition that career employees of the federal government are not political appointees, Project 2025 calls for removing any federal government employee who disagrees with their agenda. The authors of 2025 boast about “how to fire supposedly ‘un-fireable’ federal bureaucrats; how to shutter wasteful and corrupt bureaus and offices; how to muzzle woke propaganda at every level of Government.” (page 9).\nArticle continues after...\nYesterday's Most Read Articles\n[Black Cow Burger Bar owner announces closure](/Black-Cow-Burger-Bar-closes-55739321) [My Turn: Eastern Mass. is coming for our forests, fields and farmlands](/MyTurnDiDonato-55750476) [Bridge of Flowers plantings cleared ahead of reconstruction project](/Shelburne-Bridge-of-Flowers-Cleared-of-Flora-by-Residents-55738899) [Abutters say odors from Flower Power Growers requires them to stay indoors](/Montague-Selectboard-Presented-Odor-Concerns-from-Flower-Power-Growers-55747901) [Deerfield DPW superintendent retiring after ‘a pretty cool ride’](/Deerfield-DPW-superintendent-retiring-after-a-pretty-cool-ride-55736405) [Warmth, hospitality drive new Turners Falls brunch restaurant](/Warmth-hospitality-drive-new-Turners-Falls-brunch-restaurant-55602454)\nProject 2025 explicitly seeks to “dismantle the administrative state” in order to eliminate enforcement of civil rights, labor and environmental laws. They explain: “The solution ... is not to tinker with this or that government program, to replace this or that bureaucrat. These are problems not of technocratic efficiency but of national sovereignty and constitutional governance. We solve them not by trimming and reshaping the leaves but by ripping out the trees — root and branch” (page 12).\nJust as the Federalist Society helped Trump transform the federal judiciary in his first term, the Heritage Foundation hopes to help Trump transform the executive branch in a second term.\nShaped by a Christian nationalist vision of America, the authors of Project 2025 twist our founding values of equality and freedom. They claim to support equality while advocating for dismantling the government agencies that enforce laws ensuring equality, such as Title VII and Title IX of the Civil Rights Act.\nThey also claim to support freedom while advocating policies that force women to carry unwanted and unsafe pregnancies to term. They are particularly regressive around gender issues, condemning single mothers, same-sex marriage and transgender people.\nThey define freedom in religious terms: “An individual must be free to live as his Creator ordained — to flourish. Our Constitution grants each of us the liberty to do not what we want, but what we ought. This pursuit of the good life is found primarily in family — marriage, children, Thanksgiving dinners, and the like” (page 14).\nOn economic issues, Project 2025 claims to support the working class but calls for tax cuts for the rich, elimination of labor and environmental protections, and deregulation of big business and the oil industry. They say, “America’s vast reserves of oil and natural gas are not an environmental problem; they are the lifeblood of economic growth” (page 13).\nThe nonpartisan watchdog group Accountable.US has created an Expose Project 2025 campaign to educate the public and reveal the key funders and conservative figures behind Project 2025. Leonard Leo’s dark money network has contributed $21.5 million in funding to over half of the organizations behind Project 2025. Meanwhile in Congress, U.S. Rep. Jaren Huffman, D-Calif., recently announced the Stop Project 2025 Task Force.\n“Project 2025 is more than an idea, it’s a dystopian plot that’s already in motion to dismantle our democratic institutions, abolish checks and balances, chip away at church-state separation, and impose a far-right agenda that infringes on basic liberties and violates public will,” said Huffman. “This is an unprecedented embrace of extremism, fascism, and religious nationalism, orchestrated by the radical right and its dark money backers. We need a coordinated strategy to save America and stop this coup before it’s too late.”\nCarrie N.

    "text": "[Columnas]\nBernardo Tobar: Valiente la RAE\nlo inadmisible es la pretensión de imponer como estándar la ideología de género, para lo cual han optado por el camino de la colonización del lenguaje\nLa Real Academia Española (RAE) ha salido unánimemente al paso de un bodrio denominado Recomendaciones para un uso no sexista del lenguaje en la Administración parlamentaria. Sexista, según los promotores de estas modas idiomáticas, es el lenguaje discriminatorio contra el sexo ajeno al género gramatical de la expresión elegida, problema imaginario para el que han recurrido a cacofonías, duplicaciones y contorsiones semánticas tan estéticas como un felino con hocico porcino, moco de pavo e intestinos al aire. Bien las conocemos desde Montecristi.\nY como el género ya no se reduce, para sus activistas, a las dos únicas opciones biológicamente posibles, sino que es un abanico fluido y variopinto, ya no bastará con decir los parlamentarios y las parlamentarias, duplicación forzada y horrible, sino que habría que resbalarse hacia la inclusiva ambigüedad de todes o tod@s. Conforme florezcan nuevas identidades sexuales, seguirá marchitándose la ética y estética del castellano.\nSi, como enseña la filosofía del arte, hay una relación indisoluble entre la razón última y su potencial estético, habría alarma suficiente para desconfiar de estos asaltos ideológicos al idioma si tan solo atendiéramos a su efecto musical, que en la entonación de la composición gramatical logran un efecto equivalente al sonido de un piano destemplado y rociado con ácido: conatos vómicos.\nNo voy a reproducir las razones técnicas y culturales de la RAE, que bien pueden consultarse en su sede digital, excepto para enfatizar su defensa de la elección personal de las fórmulas lingüísticas. Porque cada cual tiene derecho a destrozar el idioma, a ser idiota, a vestirse de amapola o actuar como una, si le place; lo inadmisible es la pretensión de imponer como estándar la ideología de género, para lo cual han optado por el camino de la colonización del lenguaje, bajo una bandera que exhibe una etiqueta de tolerancia, mientras escamotea la tela totalitaria.\nEs que, en el fondo, despejados los debates estéticos y el asedio a la milenaria riqueza del español, lo que está en juego es la normalización de una visión muy particular del individuo, la familia y la sociedad -si dicha visión es respetable o no, es objeto de otra discusión-, a través de formas expresivas. Inocular el idioma es la estrategia más eficaz para modelar la cultura e influenciar cómo pensamos. Valiente la RAE, hasta ahora.",

    "text": "COLUMBIA, Tenn. ( WSMV /Gray News) - On Wednesday, after seeing the baseball-sized hail falling in her front yard in Hohenwald, Tennessee, Sandy Goff’s immediate thought was of her son Cody Frizzell and his fiancé.\nFrizzell was driving in Columbia, and Goff knew the storm was heading their way.\n“I couldn’t think of them being out in it. That’s what scared me,” Goff said.\nFrizzell said the sky was bright and sunny when his mother called, warning him of what was coming. He asked her where they should go.\n“Where’s the best place where we could stop and seek shelter? And she said Walmart,” Frizzell said.\nWith his mother still on the line and heavy rain starting to fall, Frizzell said he and his fiancé approached the store at 2200 Brookmeade Drive in Columbia where employees in blue Walmart vests were standing.\n“One of the people stopped (his fiancé) and said, ‘No, you can’t come in. There’s a tornado warning. We’re not letting anyone in,’” Frizzell said. “I said, ‘Where are we supposed to go?’ And she said, ‘I don’t care, but you can’t stay here.’”\nGoff, listening on the line, was irate. “He said they’re not letting us in. And I said, ‘What? What do you mean they’re not letting you in?’” Goff said.\nFrizzell said he and his fiancé weren’t the only ones prevented from entering the store.\n“There was a couple behind us and they weren’t letting them in either,” Frizell said.\nWSMV4 Investigates spoke with the manager at the Columbia Walmart, but she said she could not comment and referred our questions to corporate communications.\nBrian Little, global communications director for Walmart, wrote in an email to WSMV4 Investigates: “The safety of our customers during weather events like what occurred recently in Columbia, TN is a priority. During the storm customers inside our store as well as others who requested to enter were allowed to shelter in place. While we can’t confirm who this individual spoke with, we do allow people to shelter in place inside our stores.”\nFrizzell said he and his fiancé rushed to another store that agreed to allow them to shelter in place.\nWSMV4 Investigates spoke with a manager at the store, and she confirmed that they sheltered people who had been turned away from Walmart.\n“I’m angry. Hurt. And if something had happened to them, I don’t know what I would have done,” Goff said.\nCopyright 2024 WSMV via Gray Media Group, Inc. All rights reserved.",
