    "text": "By Katie Parkins ,\n4 hours ago The City of Louisville unveiled its first fleet of fully electric trash and recycling trucks Wednesday, saying the city was the first in the country to do so .\n\"To be the first municipality in the country to adopt an electrified fleet showcases their desire to find tangible solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change,\" Richard Coupland, Republic Services vice president of municipal services, said.\nLouisville will completely replace its current fleet of trash and recycling trucks by the end of the year. This will contribute to the city's Sustainability Action Plan goals and Republic Services' goal to operate more than 50 EVs across the country by the end of 2024.\nThe four new trucks in Louisville are McNeilus Volterra electric vehicles that produce zero tailpipe emissions, according to Republic Services. They have audible devices to alert other drivers and pedestrians of their presence to counteract how much quieter EVs generally are compared to traditional trash trucks.\nThe EVs will also have automated braking systems and sensors if drivers drift out of the lane lines, Republic Services said.\nOne of the chief concerns with any electric vehicle is the distance it can travel before it needs to be charged again.\nRepublic Services responded to that by saying:\n\"Collection trucks drive short distances, travel at slow speeds and make many stops and starts during a route, all of which are factors that make our fleet ideal for electrification. Plus, all trucks return to a base overnight where they can be recharged.\"\nRepublic Services \"The technology already has been proven in other cities with more challenging climates than ours,\" Louisville Mayor Chris Leh said . \"What's more, it is cost-competitive for our taxpayers.\"\nThis is part of a trend nationwide to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and make electric vehicles more widely used.\nEnvironment\nEPA offers grants to swap heavy-duty vehicles for zero-emission versions Danielle Kreutter 8:20 PM, May 09, 2024 Around $932 million in grants are available for communities to swap out heavy-duty vehicles, like trucks and school buses, for electric versions.\nIt can be costly to buy electric vehicles for these purposes. The EPA is accepting applications for grants to help cover such costs, including related infrastructure costs through July 25.\nDenver 7+ Colorado News Latest Headlines | July 18, 8am",

    "text": "trading volumesfollowing a regulatory crackdown on F&O trading, is likely to hit\nsalary incrementsand bonuses in the broking industry after a strong two-year run, according to market participants.\nOngoing uncertainty and expectations of continued market volatility amid warnings of the new US administration’s higher tariffs are adding to the strain, prompting brokerage firms to adopt a cautious approach towards expenses.\nAverage increments at brokerages are likely to be down by at least 1.5-2 percentage points from 11% last year, according to a dipstick survey of 12 such firms by Deloitte; some brokerages expect the hit to be harder at even 5-7 percentage points in some instances.\nFY24 was a record one in terms of payouts, with average increments coming in at anywhere between 11% and 15%, according to industry players. But now, many firms, already grappling with multiple regulatory changes that have eroded their margins in recent months, are focusing on cost-cutting measures to navigate the challenging environment.\n“This is a high-risk, high-reward business. In 2025, brokerages are bracing for the fact that the next two quarters may not be great; retail investors will be wary,” said Zarina Sani, associate director, Deloitte Consulting.\nShe added that most companies are unlikely to use up the entire amount they had budgeted for bonuses. “It’s likely to be more in the range of 85-90%.” Top performers, however, will continue to get a premium—bigger bonuses and about 1.7-2x of the average in terms of increments.\nIn a good year, employees stand to get bonuses of three-six months depending on performance; that is likely to come down to two to four months. “This correction is being seen after a good two years,” said Sani.\nIndustry sources said that attrition across industry too has gone down, meaning that firms no longer need to pay out disproportionate hikes to ring-fence talent. “Attrition is not a big concern; it has plateaued,” said a top executive at a full-service brokerage.\n“In line with the expected industry salary increments, our hikes are expected to be around 8-10%, marginally lower than last year,” said Dhiraj Relli, MD & CEO,\nHDFC Securities. “However, there will be performance-based differentiation. In addition to salary increments, bonuses are expected to be around 20 to 30%.”\nAccording to Geetha Menon, head of HR for\nIIFL Capitaland discount stockbroking company\n5paisa Capital, FY25 has been a challenging year because of market volatility, which will impact the increment percentages.\n“The predicted industry average from multiple sources is in the range of 8%-10% compared to 15% on an average in the previous year,” said Menon.\nThis year the wealth management segment across the industry has been on a higher trajectory and will reap the benefits of it, she added.\nThough the first half (April-September) of FY25 was relatively strong, the December quarter results of most leading broking firms present a challenging picture, showing a decline in both revenues and profits compared to the previous quarter. According to the brokers, the March quarter is expected to be even weaker than the December quarter.\nDiscount brokers are likely to be more affected than their full-service counterparts, said industry sources, and this will reflect in hikes as well.\nThe stockbroking industry’s net profit margin is projected to decline by 400 basis points in FY25 due to several regulatory changes introduced in recent months, according to ratings agency CareEdge. In the first half of FY25, industry revenues stood at about Rs 23,500 crore but are expected to decline to around Rs 20,500 crore in the second half. As a result, profit margins are likely to contract from 36% in FY24 to 32% in FY25, according to CareEdge estimates.\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the [ET ePaper](https://epaper.indiatimes.com/timesepaper/publication-the-economic-times,city-delhi.cms) online.",

    "text": "Protecting your home against potential dangers is paramount in the face of increasingly unpredictable and extreme weather events. From fierce storms and heavy rainfall to scorching heat waves, understanding how to fortify your home can help you prepare for severe weather events and contribute to a more sustainable and energy-efficient living environment. How to Prepare for Severe Weather Severe weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, and blizzards, can strike unexpectedly, posing significant threats to life and property. Climate change is the driving force behind such events, further solidifying the importance of taking energy-saving measures to mitigate the climate crisis. Being prepared for such occurrences is essential to ensure the safety and well-being of yourself and your community. Here are some actionable steps you can take to prepare for severe weather and conserve energy. Insulation and Weather Stripping One of the most effective ways to protect your home from the impact of dangerous weather is to ensure it’s properly insulated. Adequate insulation helps regulate indoor temperatures, preventing unnecessary energy consumption to maintain a comfortable living space. Sealing gaps and cracks with weather stripping can further enhance insulation, keeping your home well-protected against the elements and reducing the strain on your heating and cooling systems. The average family can [reduce their heating and cooling costs by 15%](https://www.energystar.gov/saveathome/seal_insulate/methodology) just by sealing doors. Investing in high-quality insulation materials, such as fiberglass or foam board, can provide long-term benefits. Additionally, consider hiring a professional to assess your home’s insulation needs and make recommendations tailored to your specific climate and weather patterns for optimal benefits. Impact-Resistant Windows and Doors Installing impact-resistant windows and doors can provide additional protection during severe weather conditions such as hurricanes or strong winds. These specifically designed structures enhance the safety of your home and contribute to energy efficiency by preventing drafts and leaks. Some of these windows are so strong that a branch [falling at 100 miles per hour](https://wrightsimpactwindowanddoor.com/blog/reasons-to-install-impact-windows-doors/) can’t break the glass. The increased durability of impact-resistant materials can reduce the need for frequent repairs, ultimately conserving energy and resources. When choosing impact-resistant windows and doors, look for ones with high energy efficiency ratings. Some models come with multiple layers of glass and insulating gas fillings, offering improved thermal performance. While the initial investment may be higher, long-term energy savings and enhanced safety features make it worthwhile. Storm Shutters For areas prone to hurricanes or high winds, installing storm shutters can provide an extra layer of protection for windows. These shutters help prevent breakage and minimize the risk of debris entering your home during severe weather events. Additionally, they contribute to energy efficiency by reducing heat transfer and maintaining a stable indoor temperature. Roof Maintenance A well-maintained roof is crucial for protecting your home from the brunt of extreme weather. Regular inspections and repairs can prevent leaks, water damage, and structural issues that may arise during heavy rainfall or snowfall. Additionally, a light-colored roof [can help regulate indoor temperatures](https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/cool-roofs#:~:text=This%20lowers%20the%20temperature%20of,(28%20%C2%B0C)%20cooler.) by reducing heat absorption, leading to lower energy consumption for cooling purposes. Schedule annual roof inspections to identify and address any potential issues promptly. Consider using cool roof coatings with [reflective properties to deflect sunlight](https://renovated.com/storm-resistant-roofing-material/) and reduce heat absorption. This coating also protects your home from weather-related damage and contributes to a more energy-efficient cooling system. Smart Landscaping Strategic landscaping can serve as a natural barrier against dangerous weather. Planting windbreaks, such as trees and shrubs, can [shield your home from strong winds](https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/landscaping-windbreaks#:~:text=A%20windbreak%20reduces%20heating%20costs,and%20the%20skin%20temperature%20drops.), reducing the risk of structural damage. Furthermore, adding shade-providing vegetation around your property can assist in cooling your home, reducing the need for excessive air conditioning during hot weather. Choose native, drought-resistant plants for landscaping to create a low-maintenance and eco-friendly garden. These [indigenous plants require less water](https://www.asla.org/nativeplantssavemoney.aspx), conserving resources in the process. Position windbreaks strategically to maximize their protective effects. Properly designed landscaping helps you prepare for severe weather and contributes to your home’s overall energy efficiency. Why Should You Conserve Energy? It’s now more important than ever to conserve energy, given the escalating challenges climate change poses, environmental degradation and the finite nature of our natural resources. The average household is responsible for [14,020 pounds of CO2 emissions](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/assumptions-and-references-household-carbon-footprint-calculator) each year, significantly contributing to climate change. Fossil fuels provide most of the world’s energy, releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases contribute to climate change, leading to rising global temperatures, extreme weather events and ecosystem disruptions. Minimizing energy consumption can reduce your carbon footprint, slow climate change and protect the planet’s delicate balance. From an economic standpoint, households and businesses can save money by reducing their energy consumption. Optimizing heating and cooling and investing in energy-efficient appliances can minimize electricity use, reducing utility bills. Depending on your home improvements, households [can save up to 20%](https://www.energystar.gov/saveathome/improvements/benefits/savings) on their electricity bill. It Starts at Home Protecting your home from dangerous weather plays a vital role in conserving energy and promoting sustainability. Implementing these measures protects your property and loved ones and contributes to a more resilient and energy-conscious home. As climate change continues to pose challenges, taking proactive steps to fortify your home becomes integral to creating a safer and more sustainable living space.",

Mas ambos tiveram apenas alguns milhares de espectadores em grandes estádios, com capacidade para 65 mil e 42 mil pessoas, respectivamente.\nNo caso da partida em Saint-Étienne, menos de 3 mil pessoas acompanharam nas arquibancadas o jogo entre canadenses e neozelandesas. Este é um dos piores públicos da história do futebol olímpico, sem contar os Jogos de Tóquio em 2021, que foi disputado com portões fechados e em uma bolha sanitária devido à pandemia de covid-19.\n\"É decepcionante, especialmente para os Jogos Olímpicos. Sei que todo mundo está em Paris\", lamentou a zagueira canadense Vanessa Gilles.\nOs organizadores dos Jogos optaram, em alguns casos, como em Bordeaux, por não fornecer números oficiais exatos de público.\nbur-lh-ali/dr/ma/aam/rpr\n© Agence France-Presse\nComunicar erro Veja também Deixe seu comentário Só para assinantes",
