    "text": "El día de hoy, 4 de octubre de 2024, Pozoblanco se presenta con un tiempo mayormente despejado, lo que permitirá disfrutar de un ambiente agradable a lo largo de la jornada. Desde las primeras horas de la mañana, el cielo se mantendrá despejado, con temperaturas que comenzarán en torno a los 19 grados . A medida que avance la mañana, se espera que la temperatura descienda ligeramente, alcanzando los 18 grados a la 1 de la tarde. La humedad relativa será alta durante las primeras horas, alcanzando un 100% en la madrugada, lo que podría generar una sensación de bochorno. Sin embargo, a medida que el día avance, la humedad comenzará a disminuir, situándose en un 39% hacia la tarde, lo que contribuirá a un ambiente más seco y confortable. En cuanto al viento, se prevé que sople desde el noroeste con velocidades que oscilarán entre los 5 y 17 km/h. Las ráfagas más intensas se registrarán en las horas de la tarde, alcanzando hasta 28 km/h, lo que podría proporcionar un alivio ante las temperaturas cálidas que se esperan. La dirección del viento será predominantemente del noroeste, lo que es típico en esta época del año en la región. A lo largo del día, las temperaturas alcanzarán su punto máximo en torno a las 4 de la tarde, con un valor de 26 grados . Este calor será acompañado por un cielo despejado, lo que permitirá que los rayos del sol calienten el ambiente de manera efectiva. Sin embargo, hacia el final de la tarde, se anticipa un ligero descenso en la temperatura, que caerá a 24 grados a las 7 de la tarde. No se prevén precipitaciones durante el día, lo que significa que los habitantes de Pozoblanco podrán disfrutar de actividades al aire libre sin preocuparse por la lluvia. La probabilidad de precipitación es nula, lo que refuerza la idea de un día soleado y seco. En resumen, Pozoblanco disfrutará de un día mayormente despejado, con temperaturas agradables y un viento moderado que hará que la jornada sea ideal para salir y disfrutar del entorno. Con un cielo despejado y sin lluvias a la vista, es un buen momento para aprovechar el aire libre y realizar actividades que requieran buen tiempo.

    "title": "\"Rancore personale\", \"Deve stare attento\". Botta e risposta tra Renzi e Calenda - il Giornale",
    "text": "Mancano poche ore alle elezioni europee e il dibattito s'infiamma sempre di più, anche tra personalità forti che in passato avevano provato a percorrere la strada del matrimonio politico dando vita al famigerato Terzo Polo. Quella che doveva essere un'entità in grado di rosicchiare voti ai moderati del centrodestra in realtà è finito per essere un ring su cui si è consumato un divorzio che ancora oggi ha strascichi evidenti. Lo dimostra l'ultimo botta e risposta a distanza tra [Matteo Renzi](/persone/matteo-renzi-131321.html) e Carlo Calenda, entrambi ospiti di Enrico Mentana su La7 per lo speciale L'ultima parola. Il leader di Italia Viva ha preso parte al progetto della lista Stati Uniti d'Europa, cappello che raccoglie +Europa, Psi, Radicali italiani, Libdem e L'Italia c'è. Nei primi giorni del cantiere della formazione politica era circolata l'ipotesi dell'ingresso anche di Azione, ma alla fine il dibattito interno e i personalismi hanno prevalso escludendo quello che fin da subito era apparso come uno scenario di fantapolitica. Proprio su questo tema è stato interpellato Renzi, che non ha rinunciato a lanciare una frecciatina. \"È inspiegabile il rancore personale che lo porta a stare fuori da Stati Uniti d'Europa\", ha affermato l'ex presidente del Consiglio. Che, senza cadere nell'insulto diretto o nell'attacco frontale, ha comunque utilizzato parole che hanno sferzato Calenda. E lo ha fatto ripercorrendo le tappe del passato che invece avevano mostrato la disponibilità di Renzi alla collaborazione con il suo ex partner di partito: \"Due milioni e 100mila persone hanno scelto di fare il Terzo Polo. Un cittadino romano ha scelto di non farlo più. Io non ho niente contro di lui: l'ho fatto ministro, ambasciatore, presidente del Terzo Polo, non aveva le firme e gli ho dato le firme...\". Altrettanto pungente la presa di posizione di Carlo Calenda, secondo cui ciò che sta facendo Renzi \"è molto grave\". Il punto della divergenza riguarda sempre le consulenze in Arabia Saudita, tema su cui si è spesso consumato uno scontro senza esclusione di colpi.La tesi sostenuta dal leader di Azione è che Renzi, anche se dovesse approdare a Bruxelles, si troverebbe con le mani legate: \"Attento, perché non è come l'Italia: dovrai stare attento a come voti per non incorrere in un conflitto d'interesse. Lì è l'Europa, ti fanno nero\". - dal lunedì al venerdì dalle ore 10:00 alle ore 20:00 - sabato, domenica e festivi dalle ore 10:00 alle ore 18:00.",

    "title": "Penn-Mar Human Services paves the way for employment for all in Carroll",
    "text": "With her friendly personality and easy smile, Kristen Tracey is well-suited to her job as a greeter at JeannieBird Baking Company in Westminster. Though Tracey may need some help with tasks such as clocking in or tying her apron, she excels at providing the kind of friendly greeting owner Bernie Vogel considers a standard of service at the Main Street restaurant.\n“We’re not in the bakery business, we’re in the making people happy business, and [Tracey is] exceptional at doing precisely that,” Vogel said.\nTracey is one of two people with intellectual or developmental disabilities who Vogel employs at the restaurant, from 8 to 11 a.m., two days per week, in partnership with the nonprofit Penn-Mar Human Services.\nTracey earns minimum wage, plus a share of tips. Vogel said her friendly personality makes her a good fit for the job, and her attention to detail makes her better than many neurotypical workers at clearing plates and wiping tables.\n“It’s been wonderful for all of us to see that there’s a place for people with special skills and special needs, and my crew members all work as a team,” Vogel said. “We work more as a family than we do as a team.”\nPeople with intellectual or developmental disabilities can face hurdles in navigating the world, especially when it comes to the near-universal struggle of finding employment. Penn-Mar Human Services is a nonprofit that works to help pave the way by providing career counseling and job placement, among other help, for those who need it. The organization works with employers to identify roles and customize job duties when necessary, said Jenny Brower, Penn-Mar’s Maryland supported employment manager.\nThe nonprofit consists of multiple departments aimed at providing many different services to people with disabilities, and its employment department assists more than 100 people with careers in Maryland and Pennsylvania.\n“The biggest thing I want people to know about customized employment is that the dedication that our workers have to their jobs is just phenomenal,” Brower said. “They are dedicated, they show up for work on time, they’re excited, they’re reliable, and they have that assistance from us if they need it at any time. So I think that’s very appealing to employers in our workforce, and I get excited every time somebody gets a job because I know they will be very dedicated to the work that they do.”\nWestminster resident Jordan Ketterman, 35, is one such individual. A veteran of several screen reclaiming roles for various printing companies, Ketterman now works about 30 hours per week as a reclaimer at Maryland Print House in Westminster, where he makes just over minimum wage.\nScreen reclamation is as glamor-less as it is vital to printing operations, according to production manager Andrew Bergamaschi. The job involves removing hardened ink and other material that gets caked on a screen during the printing process, so the screen can be used for future printing jobs. Ketterman wears a mask while applying a chemical treatment to remove the gunk, then power washes each screen and applies dish soap. Ketterman’s hands and clothes slowly blacken with ink each workday, as spinning print machines and conveyor belts whirr in the background. The screen reclaimer’s responsibilities also include sweeping and taking out the trash.\n“His role is absolutely vital,” said Bergamaschi, who co-owns the business. “If I had to use a screen that had some leftover bad stuff in it, it might affect my next job. Imagine having to run a restaurant for a night and you don’t have a dishwasher — impossible. You couldn’t do it. He is my dishwasher. He’s been a blessing for us in terms of not having to worry about that position, and he’s good at the position, at that.”\nKetterman cleans about 30 to 40 screens during the course of an eight-hour workday, which Bergamaschi said is the upper limit of what is humanly possible.\n“I love doing it,” Ketterman said. “I like getting dirty. I like washing the screens.”\nBergamaschi met Ketterman years ago when Bergamaschi filled in as a screen printer for a few days at a different printing company where Ketterman was employed as screen reclaimer. When Maryland Print House grew big enough to support a dedicated screen reclaimer, Bergamaschi tried several people in the position, but no one was a perfect fit. He was fortunate to reconnect with Ketterman and offer him the job.\n“It really did come full circle,” Bergamaschi said.\nKetterman quickly became a valuable team member and a good-spirited contributor to workplace culture. Bergamaschi said the screen reclaimer will make him laugh at least once daily, and loves to banter with coworkers when he isn’t listening to music.\n“I like like working with Jordan a lot,” Bergamaschi said. “He’s part of the crew.”\nPenn-Mar endeavors to place individuals in jobs that will last, Brower said, and provides the services of a dedicated career coach who checks in with businesses to make sure everything is going according to plan with employees placed with the help of Penn-Mar.\nA long-lasting job is beneficial to employees and employers alike, Brower added.\n“It keeps people from quitting and it keeps employers from from terminating,” Brower said. “It’s a win-win.”\nA career coach helps to adjust duties and expectations of an individual in a job, coordinates schedules as needed, reviews payment information, and advocates for people in situations where the world can be hard for them to understand. Bergamaschi said Erin Brady, who serves as a career coach for Ketterman and Tracey, is a valuable resource.\nBrady also serves as a career coach for Bryan May of Taneytown, 54, but he needs very little oversight.\nA utility work employee for AVI Foodsystems at the McDaniel College cafeteria in Westminster, May was diagnosed with tardive dyskinesia at age 12 after he says he received questionable medical treatments that irrevocably impacted the trajectory of his life. After numerous stints with other employers, May found his role in the McDaniel cafeteria dish room in 2015 and has been gainfully employed ever since.\n“I like this job more than all the others put together,” May said.\nMay works from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. on weekdays and AVI director of operations Kristen Miller said he is an among the hardest working members of the team.\n“He’s a great worker, we could use five more Bryans,” Miller said. “He works harder than most of our employees here.”\nMaking sure dishes are clean and properly put away comprises the bulk of May’s job duties. AVI resident director Kevin Laster said he appreciates May’s punctuality, dependability and positive attitude.\n“I wouldn’t know what to do in the dish room without him,” Laster said. “And disability — take it away. He has no disability. He can do anything, and he’s kind of a pretty big part of the whole organization.”\nMay is also vocal about his love for his job, Laster said.\n“I do the best I can to my best standards,” May said. “I’d rather work here than work somewhere else. Hopefully, I’d like to work for the rest of my life or until I can work no longer.”\nBeing employed provides May with money and benefits that he said are important to him and his lifestyle. He said his job is a great fit for his personality, and he also enjoys the perk of cafeteria buffet access during breaks.\nTardive dyskinesia is a movement disorder, and May said he will never be able to participate in traditional recreational activities or sports. He uses a walker to assist his mobility and seems to be constantly leaning forward. Nevertheless, May has found his place in the steamy dish room and busy kitchen of McDaniel’s cafeteria, where he faithfully performs his job.\n“Don’t let them tell you what you can and cannot do,” May said, “because you can do it if you put your mind to it. You can accomplish anything, like I did, and don’t let anybody tell you different that you can’t do it, that you’re good for nothing. If you believe you can do it, then you can do it. That’s what I believe.”",

    "title": "Cowboy Bebop’s Director Hated the Netflix Live-Action So Much He Couldn’t Continue Watching After the Opening Scene, Felt It Was Clearly Not Cowboy Bebop",
    "text": "The curse of the live-action adaptations was quite real before the release of Netflix’s One Piece . Every anime or manga series that was adapted faced criticism from anime fans because of multiple elements and aspects not fitting well with the original story. One such live-action that was heavily criticized by fans was Cowboy Bebop’s adaptation.\nCowboy Bebop live-action adaptation | Credit: Netflix Set in the year 2071, Cowboy Bebop follows the lives of a traveling bounty-hunter crew: Spike Spiegel, Jet Black, Faye Valentine, Edward, and Ein. As the Earth has become inhabitable, the crew travels through space in their spaceship called Bebop. It is considered to be one of the greatest anime series of all time.\nHowever, the legendary image of Cowboy Bebop was ruined by the live-action adaptation. Even the director of the anime series, Shinichiro Watanabe, hated the live-action series so much that he couldn’t continue watching it after the opening scene. This in itself proved what kind of reception it got from the fans of the original anime.\nShinichiro Watanabe Couldn’t Watch Cowboy Bebop’s Live-Action Adaptation In January 2023, Watanabe was interviewed by Forbes , where the anime director was asked about his journey through the industry, his works, his favorite projects, and his opinion about the live-action adaptation by Netflix that was released in 2021. Watanabe was extremely disappointed with the series.\nRELATED “This scene is not progressive at all”: One Scene from Cowboy Bebop Has Still Left Fans Divided Over its Real Intention Featuring Faye Valentine That Got Censored in the US He stated:\nFor the new Netflix live-action adaptation, they sent me a video to review and check. It started with a scene in a casino, which made it very tough for me to continue. I stopped there and so only saw that opening scene.\nOne of the main reasons Cowboy Bebop flopped was its divergence from the source material. A lot of scenes and storylines were different from the original, which led to fans losing their interest.\nNetflix Cowboy Bebop live-action adaptation | Credit: Netflix Watanabe, who spent a lot of time building Cowboy Bebop’s legacy , couldn’t witness it being destroyed by the live-action series. Thus, he decided to avoid watching it after the first scene. He instantly realized that adapting his work into a live-action was a bad idea, and it could potentially tarnish the name of Cowboy Bebop .\nShinichiro Watanabe Believed He Could Have Done Better With Cowboy Bebop’s Live-Action Shinichiro Watanabe has worked on many prominent projects, but he is mostly known for Cowboy Bebop . It was his first full directorial project, and he received universal praise for it. Thus, seeing it be failed by a live-action adaptation hurt his sentiments. He believed that he could have done a better job with the Netflix series.\nCowboy Bebop live-action | Credit: Netflix Watanabe stated:\nIt was clearly not Cowboy Bebop and I realized at that point that if I wasn’t involved, it would not be Cowboy Bebop. I felt that maybe I should have done this. Although the value of the original anime is somehow far higher now.\nCowboy Bebop was a gateway series that allowed the anime industry to earn recognition from a worldwide audience. The series’ legendary status comes solely from its intriguing narrative, which was a big thing in the early 2000s.\nRELATED “We just made what we enjoyed making”: Cowboy Bebop Director Shinichiro Watanabe’s Humble Response after Realizing Western Audiences Loved the Show Thus, Watanabe’s disappointment with Netflix’s adaptation was understandable. Fans to this day hope that if Cowboy Bebop makes a return, it should be under the guidance of Watanabe so that it can get a better adaptation, be it anime or live-action.\nCowboy Bebop live-action is available to watch on Netflix.",

    "text": "El Tribunal de l’Estat Vaticà, en una sentència inèdita, ha condemnat al cardenal Angelo Beccciu a cinc anys i mig de presó per malversació de fons. Aquest escàndol vaticà, que ha vist implicat el cardenal per una inversió immobiliària d’alt risc a Londres a compte de fons vaticans, ha acabat amb la condemna al cardenal i a nou persones més, i també diverses empreses n’han sortit esquitxades.\nDe nom angelical (don Angelo) i cognom Becciu (es pronuncia \"betxu\"), aquest eminentíssim assessor del Papa ha fet perdre moltes hores als tribunals vaticans, que han hagut d’investigar els 200 milions de dòlars i d’ús il·lícit en l’administració dels béns eclesiàstics. El cardenal ha estat condemnat a inhabilitació perpètua per a càrrec públic. El fet no és només tèrbol, èticament reprovable i trist, sinó indignant i carn per a possible i trepidant guió audiovisual. Per exemple, Cecilia Marogna (la dama del cardenal, li diuen) va rebre més de mig milió d’euros suposadament per facilitar l’alliberament d’una monja segrestada a Mali. El cardenal havia autoritzat aquest pagament quan ell era un alt càrrec vaticà. La senyora Marogna, en comptes d’alliberar una segrestada, es va comprar roba de Gucci i Prada, i ho argumenta amb serenor explicant que eren objectes necessaris i complements adients que necessitava per negociar amb persones \"d’alt nivell\" per aconseguir fruits diplomàtics i ajudar les nunciatures del món.\nEl papa Francesc s’està distanciant de manera sideral dels corruptes que descobreix\nEls advocats del cardenal titllen \"d’absurda\" l’acusació a Becciu i, tot i respectar la sentència, asseguren que el cardenal és innocent. La Viquipèdia ja s'ha afanyat a definir-lo com a \"sacerdot i diplomàtic italià, delinqüent convicte\". El cardenal Becciu ara té 75 anys, i va néixer a una ciutat anomenada Pattada, a Itàlia. Un bon cop de peu li ha conferit ara la justícia vaticana, que, des dels escàndols contra Ratzinger, no havia protagonitzat un enrenou semblant ni un judici tan llarg.\nEl papa Francesc s’està distanciant de manera sideral dels corruptes que descobreix. En té més. Però, per sort, també està acompanyat de jutges que fan la seva feina i d’assessors que li van dient com està el món. Mentre els seus tribunals estan ocupats amb aquests temes tan poc espirituals, la Doctrina de la Fe ha publicat\nFiducia Supplicans, un document que obre la possibilitat a les \"parelles en situacions irregulars\" i parelles homosexuals a rebre benediccions. Sota el pessebre i l’arbre de Nadal a la plaça de Sant Pere, les coses es mouen.",
