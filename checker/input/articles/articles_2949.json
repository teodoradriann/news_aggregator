    "title": "VA Senate Democrats disappointed over Right to Contraception",
    "text": "NORFOLK, Va. — Senate Republicans voted down a measure that would ensure women have a right to contraception, a month after a similar measure was struck down in Virginia. It also comes two years after the Supreme Court voted to overturn Roe v Wade. Virginia Democratic Senators Mark Warner and Tim Kaine said they are disappointed by the vote, with only two Republicans voting yes on the Right to Contraception Act. However, they say they’re turning their attention to another bill they are cosponsoring protecting reproductive rights. Senate Republicans argue the Right to Contraception Act was a political stunt, saying they believe in access to contraception but said the legislation was unnecessary. Senate Democrats say it was about more than that. \"It basically established that a person has the right to access contraception and a provider has the right to provide contraception and the government can’t intrude upon that,\" said Kaine. According to the Pew Research Center, the majority of both President Joe Biden and Former President Donald Trump supporters view the broad availability of birth control and in-vitro fertilization as a good thing. \"It was disappointing yesterday. People have said, ‘well was it a show vote?’ It was a show of whether you as a senator believe women in this country have a right to contraception,\" said Warner. A similar measure, supported by Democratic Virginia Delegate Cia Price, was vetoed by Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin last month. \"We introduced this bill because everyone should have the full scope of available options for reproductive healthcare and family planning services,\" she said during a press conference before the Senate vote. \"Contraception is critical for family planning and a variety of health conditions, including my own—polycystic ovarian syndrome. I could not even be here today without my IUD. I could not do the work of a delegate without my IUD and there are millions of Americans just like me who have no semblance of quality of life without our contraception.\" Youngkin said he supports access to birth control but did not want to “trample on the religious freedoms of Virginians.” Now, Warner and Kaine are turning their attention to the Right to IVF Act that will likely make it to the Senate floor for a vote next week. \"People deserve the ability to make their own reproductive healthcare decisions and their own decisions about when and how to start a family,\" said Kaine. According to the two Virginia Senators, the Right to IVF Act includes provisions from four bills: It comes after Alabama’s Supreme Court ruled frozen embryos can be considered children under state law… but the state later created a law providing legal protections for clinics. \"I believe very strongly that women in America, women in Virginia ought to have the freedom to decide how and when to start a family,\" said Warner.",

    "title": "Brésil : La déforestation en Amazonie repart à la hausse pour la première fois depuis quinze mois",
    "text": "Pour la première fois depuis quinze mois, la déforestation en Amazonie brésilienne a augmenté en juillet. La surface dévastée a atteint 666 km2 le mois dernier, en hausse de 33 % par rapport aux 500 km2 détruits en juillet 2023, selon des données de l’Institut national de recherches spatiales (INPE). Cependant, en prenant en compte les 12 derniers mois, la déforestation a baissé de 45,7 % par rapport à la période antérieure, un résultat spectaculaire. Même si la tendance de fond reste à une forte baisse, les derniers chiffres de l’INPE sont un véritable revers pour le gouvernement du président Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. La chute spectaculaire du déboisement dans la plus grande forêt tropicale de la planète est l’un des points forts du bilan du président de gauche depuis son retour au pouvoir en 2023, alors que le phénomène avait bondi sous son prédécesseur d’extrême droite Jair Bolsonaro (2019-2022). « Déforestation zéro » Lula a promis de mettre fin, d’ici à 2030, à la déforestation illégale au Brésil. « En arrivant au pouvoir, le président Lula a donné la priorité à l’agenda de déforestation zéro, non seulement pour l’Amazonie mais pour tous les biomes », a déclaré, lors d’une conférence de presse à Brasilia, la ministre de l’Environnement Marina Silva, après la présentation des résultats. Les biomes sont de vastes zones géographiques partageant un climat, une faune et une flore similaires. La déforestation en Amazonie est fortement liée à l’expansion agricole et à l’exploitation minière illégale. Lula a adopté en juin un plan visant à combattre les organisations criminelles qui contribuent à la déforestation dans cet écosystème, appelant son gouvernement à faire preuve d'« agilité » pour sa mise en place rapide. Les autorités pointent en outre l’impact d’une grève de fonctionnaires au sein de l’organisme de protection de l’environnement Ibama. Par ailleurs, « en juillet l’an dernier, la réduction (de la déforestation) avait été très élevée, avec un résultat très en dessous de la tendance historique », a dit Joao Paulo Capobianco, secrétaire exécutif du ministère de l’Environnement, pour expliquer le mauvais résultat récent. Alerte au Cerrado L’Amazonie (dont 60 % se trouve au Brésil) joue un rôle majeur contre le réchauffement climatique grâce à l’absorption de CO2. Si la tendance lourde à la baisse de la déforestation se confirme dans les prochains mois, « le Brésil sera tout près de réaliser son objectif prévu pour 2025 dans l’Accord de Paris », consistant à atteindre une réduction de 48 % de ses gaz à effet de serre, a estimé dans un communiqué l’Observatoire du climat, un collectif d’ONG. Selon le groupement, « c’est un bon signe de leadership par l’exemple, pour un pays qui sera le siège de la conférence de l’ONU sur le climat » l’an prochain, la COP30 prévue dans la ville amazonienne de Belem. L’inquiétude demeure cependant pour le Cerrado, biome situé au sud de l’Amazonie et zone de savane également très riche en biodiversité. Si une réduction a été observée au cours des quatre derniers mois, la déforestation y a atteint 7.015 km2 entre août 2023 et juillet 2024, contre 6.341 km2 pour la période antérieure. La ministre Marina Silva a espéré que la baisse enregistrée ces derniers mois devienne une « tendance ferme » dans le Cerrado.",

This is an increase of 3.2 percent since 2019, with 2 million more households being cost-burdened.\nOf these households, half of them, or 12.1 million, were severely burdened, meaning that they were spending more than half of their incomes on rents.\nThe share of cost-burdened households rose most significantly among middle-income households with incomes ranging between $30,000 to $75,000, the research found. Households with incomes lower than $30,000, a group already disproportionately likely to face housing price burdens, also saw an increase, with 1.5 percent more households with unaffordable rates.\nThe rise in unaffordability is due to historic increases in housing prices in recent years in combination with decades-long wage stagnation . The research found that, while median rents rose by 21 percent between 2001 and 2022, adjusting for inflation, renters’ incomes rose by only 2 percent.\nRelated Story News | Economy & Labor Greedflation Accounts for 53 Cents of Every Dollar of Inflation in Past 6 Months With the 2024 presidential election looming, 96 percent of Americans say inflation is an important issue to them. By Chris Walker , T ruthout January 22, 2024 Truthout Households with incomes lower than $30,000 already struggle the most with paying higher proportions of their rents, and this combination has hit them hardest; the researchers found that this group’s median residual income after paying rent and other needs like utilities was a record low of only $310 a month, a decrease of 47 percent since 2001. By contrast, the Economic Policy Institute says that, even in the most affordable areas, a single-person household needs $2,000 a month after housing for basic needs.\nMeanwhile, homelessness has reached record heights, with evictions increasing after the early pandemic-era eviction moratorium expired in 2021 and states ran out of rental assistance funds; since then, few policies have been put in place to prevent further housing instability. As of January 2023, over 653,000 people are experiencing homelessness in the U.S., a record high — with 71,000 people driven into homelessness in just the past year.\nMeasures put in place in response to the pandemic had helped renters significantly, but now, with soaring housing costs, the “need for rental assistance remains greater than ever,” the report notes.\nWith expiring resources for housing, the “housing safety net is once again overwhelmed and underfunded,” Chris Herbert, managing director for the Joint Center for Housing Studies, said in a press release . “And while states and localities have acted to fill some of the gaps, a larger commitment from the federal government is required to expand housing supports and preserve and improve the existing affordable stock. Only then will the nation finally make a meaningful dent in the housing affordability crisis making life so difficult for millions of people.”",

    "title": "Hong Kong Cardinal Calls for Forgiveness Ahead of Tiananmen Square Anniversary",
    "text": "The 35th anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown approaches, Hong Kong's top catholic priest, Cardinal Stephen Chow Sau-yan, has urged residents to 'proactively forgive' those responsible for the event's wounds and move towards 'reconciliation and healing.'\nIn an article published in the\nCatholic newspaper Sunday Examiner, Chow emphasized that forgiveness does not mean forgetting but rather letting go of 'unending sadness and resentments.' He encouraged different parties to move beyond 'finger-pointing and the painful 'I will never forgive' mindset.'\nWhy this matters: The call for forgiveness and reconciliation by Hong Kong's Cardinal Stephen Chow Sau-yan has significant implications for the city's relationship with China and the world, as it addresses a sensitive and still-unresolved issue. The outcome of this call could have far-reaching consequences for Hong Kong's freedoms and autonomy.\nThe 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown occurred on June 4, 1989, when the Chinese military violently suppressed student-led protests in Beijing, resulting in an unknown number of civilian deaths. The event has left a deep wound in the psyche of many, with Hong Kong residents annually gathering for a\nlive candlelight vigil to mourn the victims.\nHowever, the vigil has not been officially held since 2019, and the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, which organized the event, disbanded in 2021. The city authorities refused to grant permission for the event in 2020 and 2021, citing health risks amid the Covid-19 pandemic.\nEarlier this week, seven people, including Chow Hang-tung, the former vice-chairwoman of the alliance, were arrested for allegedly publishing\npress releases related to the crackdown and inciting hatred towards the local and central governments. Chow Hang-tung is currently in remand pending a national security trial for allegedly inciting subversion through her work with the alliance.\nThe arrests mark the first under the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance, which was enacted in March and carries a maximum punishment of seven years in prison for sedition offenses. One suspect remains in remand, while six others were released on bail.\nCardinal Chow's message emphasizes the importance of forgiveness in achieving reconciliation and healing. He wrote, 'I would like to say something that conveys sadness and hope, coexisting in the life-sapping event that took place 35 years ago in the capital city.' Chow urged different parties to 'move beyond finger-pointing and the painful 'I will never forgive' mindset,' stressing that forgiveness is necessary for reconciliation and healing to become a reality.\nThe Tiananmen Square crackdown has left a lasting impact on many, with the incident still disturbing many even years later. The recent arrests of seven individuals, including Chow Hang-tung, have sparked concerns about the erosion of freedoms in Hong Kong.\nCardinal Chow's call for forgiveness and reconciliation offers a path towards healing, urging residents to let go of past resentments and move forward together, with the 35th anniversary approaching.\nKey Takeaways\n- Cardinal Stephen Chow urges Hong Kong residents to \"proactively forgive\" those responsible for Tiananmen Square crackdown.\n- Forgiveness doesn't mean forgetting, but letting go of \"unending sadness and resentments.\"\n- 7 people, including Chow Hang-tung, arrested for allegedly inciting hatred towards governments related to Tiananmen Square.\n- Cardinal Chow's message emphasizes forgiveness for reconciliation and healing.\n- The call for forgiveness has significant implications for Hong Kong's relationship with China and the world.",
