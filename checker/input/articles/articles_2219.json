    "text": "Pueblo Police reports 7% decrease in motor vehicle theft this year\nPUEBLO, Colo. (KRDO) - The Pueblo Police Department (PPD) is reporting an overall seven percent decrease in motor vehicle thefts this year, attributing it to a crackdown on the crime, as well as a change in the gravity of the crime from a misdemeanor to a felony.\nThat 7% decrease would have been bigger if it weren't for a design flaw in Kia and Hyundai vehicles that made them easier to steal, according to Sargeant Frank Ortega with the Pueblo Police Department.\n\"Ideally, we would not have the vehicle stolen at all, but if the manufacturers are designing it in a way that makes it easy to steal, there's only so much that the police can do in regards to that,\" Ortega said.\nWhile there is an overall decrease in car theft,\nPueblo police also report recovering nearly double the monetary amount in car theft than last year, rising from $949,450 thousand to $1,844,946 million.\nThat's a 94% increase from last year.\n\"We're seeing it increase because of the ease of stealing those two manufacturers' vehicles, and then we're seeing an increase, obviously, too, because we're catching them,\" Ortega said of the steep increase.\nOrtega detailed that they had been working with other agencies and making motor vehicle theft a priority for the team. Ortega also said that he's noticed car theft is often paired with more serious crimes in the area.\n\"People have to realize that the reason they're stealing cars sometimes is as simple as to have transportation,\" Ortega said. \"But most of the time it's used to be involved in other criminal activity. That's why they steal the car.\"\nOrtega recalled two cases in the last few weeks that have escalated into physical violence or shooting, when people had tried to locate cars themselves or law enforcement had been caught in the crossfire while trying to locate a stolen car.\n\"The only reason I want to highlight that is to warn people [so they] don't try to recover their own car because, you know what I mean, it is dangerous,\" Ortega said. \"But that's part of the job that we do, is we deal with dangerous situations.\"",

    "title": "Unlocking Professional Success: Mastering 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Numbers on LinkedIn - Star Two",
    "text": "LinkedIn is more than just a social media platform; it’s a pivotal tool for career advancement and professional networking. In today’s digital age, your LinkedIn profile and connections can make or break career opportunities. This blog post delves into the importance of LinkedIn’s 1st, 2nd, and 3rd connections. Understanding and utilizing these links effectively is key to unlocking a world of professional opportunities, networking, and career development. What Are 1st Connections? [1st connections on LinkedIn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqcXuDqfFzQ) are your direct contacts, including colleagues, classmates, and industry peers. These links are not just names in a list; they represent your immediate professional network. 1st links are crucial for several reasons. They are your primary source for industry insights, job opportunities, and professional endorsements. Your 1st connections can directly influence your career growth by offering support, information, and access to their own networks. Building Strong 1st Connections To build strong 1st connections, focus on connecting with relevant professionals in your field. It’s essential to be strategic and intentional. When sending links requests, always include a personalized message. Reference shared interests, mutual links, or specific reasons why you’re reaching out. This personalized approach not only increases the likelihood of your request being accepted but also sets the stage for meaningful professional relationships. Regular interaction with these links, such as commenting on their posts or sharing relevant articles, strengthens your network. Another way to do this is by using outlets such as [Scrupp](https://scrupp.com/blog/people-available-to-work-linkedin). Leveraging 1st Connections Leveraging your 1st connections is crucial for career growth. These links can offer job referrals, introduce you to key industry players, and provide valuable insights. It’s important to maintain an active presence on LinkedIn. Regularly update your profile, share your professional achievements, and engage with your connections’ content. Seek endorsements and recommendations from your 1st links, as these add credibility to your profile and attract potential employers or business partners. What Are 2nd Connections? 2nd connections on LinkedIn are individuals linked to your primary network. They represent an extended layer of your professional sphere, one step beyond your direct contacts. These secondary links play a critical role in extending your professional reach and uncovering hidden opportunities. They are key to diversifying your network and accessing resources and knowledge that are not directly available. Understanding the nuances of these secondary links, and how they provide different advantages compared to your primary contacts, is essential for effective LinkedIn [networking](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/networking-linkedin-why-you-should-how-do-tzufit-herling). They bridge the gap between known and unknown territories in your professional landscape. Expanding Your 2nd Connections Expanding your professional circle to include 2nd connections is a tactful strategy. To forge these new links, utilize the common connections you share. Seek introductions from your primary contacts, or reference them in your outreach messages to establish trust. Participating in LinkedIn groups pertinent to your field is also beneficial, as these forums are often hubs for potential secondary contacts. Engaging in these groups enhances your presence and increases the likelihood of forging meaningful connections. The aim is to discover mutual interests or objectives that can pave the way for a beneficial professional relationship for both you and your secondary contacts. Engaging with 2nd Connections Interacting with 2nd connections demands a mix of professionalism and personal engagement. When engaging with these secondary contacts, authenticity and value addition are key. Distribute content that aligns with their interests or professional sector to demonstrate your knowledge and relevance. Contribute thoughtfully to their discussions and share your insights. This engagement should be regular to foster recognition but measured to avoid overstepping boundaries. The objective is to cultivate a connection that goes beyond superficial interactions, paving the way for direct, meaningful links and opening doors to new professional avenues. What Are 3rd Connections? 3rd connections on LinkedIn are the contacts of your 2nd connections. They represent a broader network and are less directly accessible than your 1st or 2nd links. However, 3rd links can be incredibly valuable for expanding your professional reach. They are potential gateways to new industries, roles, and opportunities. Understanding how to connect with these individuals through your existing network is a key networking skill. Connecting with 3rd Connections To connect with 3rd connections, you must utilize your 1st and 2nd connections. Explore the networks of your 2nd links to identify potential 3rd links that align with your career goals. Engage in LinkedIn [groups](https://www.linkedin.com/advice/3/what-some-best-practices-engaging-other-members) where these individuals are active, and contribute valuable insights and discussions. When reaching out, mention mutual links or shared interests. This approach demonstrates that you’ve done your homework and are genuinely interested in connecting for professional reasons. The Power of 3rd Connections The power of 3rd connections lies in their ability to dramatically expand your professional network and uncover opportunities that are not visible in your immediate circle. These links can lead to new job openings, business partnerships, and industry insights. By tapping into this wider network, you open up a world of possibilities that can significantly influence your career trajectory. It’s important to approach these connections with a long-term view, focusing on building lasting professional relationships. Networking Success Stories There are numerous success stories of individuals who have leveraged their 1st, 2nd, and 3rd connections on LinkedIn to achieve remarkable career advancements. These stories often involve finding a dream job through a 2nd connection’s referral, gaining invaluable mentorship from 1st links, or launching a successful business venture through collaborations with 3rd links. These real-life examples illustrate the power of a well-maintained and strategically utilized LinkedIn network. Conclusion and Takeaways Mastering your 1st, 2nd, and 3rd connections on LinkedIn is crucial for professional success. Your 1st connections from your core network, 2nd connections expand your reach, and 3rd links open up new horizons. By strategically connecting, engaging, and leveraging these relationships, you can unlock a wealth of opportunities. Remember, LinkedIn is more than just a platform for professional networking; it’s a tool for career growth and development. Start applying these strategies today, and watch your professional network and career opportunities flourish.",
