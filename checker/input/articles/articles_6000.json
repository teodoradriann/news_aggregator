More info\nJoin us on WhatsApp Brits are bracing for a 400-mile wide band of heavy snow to sweep across the UK on Saturday, with temperatures expected to plummet to -8C . The country is currently experiencing wintry conditions , with yellow weather warnings in place until Monday, and forecasts suggest the icy snap will continue into next week.\nWXCharts&apos; weekend maps indicate a low pressure system moving up and across the UK on Friday , initially bringing several centimetres of snow to southwest England and Wales before spreading across the Midlands and northern England. By 9pm, the snow band is predicted to stretch 402 miles, from Derry in Northern Ireland to Ipswich on the east coast of England.\nMore than five centimetres of snow could fall per hour, and although the band will break up, snowfall is expected to continue throughout the night and into Sunday for northern England. Temperatures could drop as low as -8C in Scotland on Saturday night, with only the far south of England expected to avoid freezing conditions.\nBBC weather forecaster Chris Fawkes warned that the weekend \"may prove to be very disruptive for some\". He added: \"It&apos;s through Saturday night, into Sunday and into Monday that some areas could see some really severe weather due to heavy snow as this low pressure works into the cold air. In the cold air, we&apos;ll get snow right down to sea level.\"\nA Met Office yellow warning for snow and ice will be in effect from noon on Saturday until 9am on Monday, encompassing all English regions except the South West, most of Wales, and parts of southern Scotland. The Midlands, Wales, and northern England can expect around 5cm of snow, while up to 20-30cm may accumulate over higher terrain in Wales and the Pennines, according to the national agency, reports the Mirror .\nStrong winds are also expected, which could cause drifting snow in some places, and the risk of ice is increased by the possibility of freezing rain as temperatures rise slightly. Met Office meteorologist Tom Morgan commented: \"At the moment we&apos;ve issued a very large snow warning for Saturday until Monday but it doesn&apos;t mean that everywhere within that warning could see snow, it&apos;s just a heads-up there could be some impacts.\"\nIn addition, the UK Health Security Agency has set cold weather health alerts for all of England in anticipation of a chilly week ahead. Amber alerts, effective from 12pm on Thursday until January 8, indicate an increased likelihood of deaths, particularly among those aged 65 and above or with existing health conditions, the UKHSA warned.\nStory Saved You can find this story in My Bookmarks.

    "title": "Muslim Mob Attacks Christian Man Over Alleged Blasphemy, Sets House On Fire In Pak's Sargodha | MENAFN.COM",
    "text": "Sargodha, May 25 (IANS) An angry mob seriously injured a Christian man and set his house on fire over an alleged incident of blasphemy in Pakistan's Sargodha on Saturday. Local sources revealed that the situation turned violent when an enraged mob entered Sargodha's Mujahid Colony, an area which houses many Christian families, broke into a Christian man's house, thrashed him badly and set his belongings on fire. The mob also torched a shoe factory operating from within the premises besides damaging the entire property. Videos of the incident, which went viral on social media, showed a badly injured man lying on the ground as several people continued to attack him, many using even stones. The local police, however, said that the situation was brought under control after it dispersed the angry mob and shifted the injured to a nearby hospital. Police authorities also maintained that they had dispersed the crowd and rescued at least two more families from being attacked by the Muslim mob. \"We have shifted the injured to a hospital and also taken into custody several suspects involved in the incident,\" said Regional Police Officer (RPO) Shariq Kamal. \"The incident occurred over an incident of alleged desecration,\" confirmed Sargodha District Police Officer (DPO) Asad Ejaz Malhi. \"When a heavy contingent of police reached the spot, we saw a huge crowd outside some houses. We cleared the area and took out the families safely,\" added Ejaz. While the police officials claimed that no one was injured, social media posts on the incident confirmed torture and vandalism caused by the violent mob. \"We have called in a District Peace Committee to evaluate the situation and issue a statement on the matter. District committee includes district administration, religious scholars of Muslim and minority communities,\" said the DPO. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) has expressed serious concerns about the unfolding situation in Sargodha, stating, \"Christian community in Gillwala is reportedly at grave risk to their lives at the hands of charged mobs.\" The incident has brought back horrific memories of last August when angry mobs attacked Christian churches, and Christian graveyards and rampaged the Christian neighbourhood torching dozens of houses over alleged blasphemy committed by members of the community in Jaranwala. The human rights lawyers have slammed the Pakistani government for failing to take any serious and sincere action against the perpetrators of the Jaranwala incident and emboldening radicals. \"I strongly condemn the Sardogha incident. I denounce the failure of the State to take any serious and sincere action against the perpetrators of the Jaranwala incident. It has only emboldened those who exploit religious sentiments for their criminal acts,\" said politician and human rights lawyer Jibran Nasir.

    "text": "Marianne Williamson announces bid to head DNC: \"I will work to reinvent the party from the inside out\"\nWashington DC - Former Democratic [presidential](https://www.tag24.com/politics/politicians) candidate [Marianne Williamson](https://www.tag24.com/politics/politicians/marianne-williamson-2024-her-story-experience-and-policies-2814860) recently announced that she is running for chair of the Democratic National Committee.\nOn Thursday, Williamson shared an[ open letter](https://www.transformarticles.com/p/im-running-for-dnc-chair) to members of the DNC, in which she argued that the coming election for chair of the committee \"feels different than in past years,\" and the party is in need of a \"transformation.\"\n\"This year, the party faces a more critical problem than we have ever faced before,\" Williamson wrote.\n\"The MAGA phenomenon now challenges the very way that politics are done in America, and the traditional tool kit of party organizing will not be enough to meet the moment.\"\nShe went on to heavily criticize President-elect [Donald Trump](https://www.tag24.com/politics/politicians/donald-trump) for having \"ushered in an age of political theater,\" but noted that it's important to understand \"the psychological and emotional dimensions\" of his appeal in order to \"create the energy to counter it.\"\n\"As Chairwoman, I will work to reinvent the party from the inside out,\" she continued. \"For if we want a new president in four years, and a new Congress in two, then we must immediately get about the task of creating a new party.\"\nWhat does Marianne Williamson plan to do as chair of the DNC?\nThe letter comes as many Democratic voters have expressed extreme dissatisfaction with how the party handled the 2024 presidential election, which led to candidate [Kamala Harris](https://www.tag24.com/politics/politicians/kamala-harris) losing to Trump.\nWilliamson ran for president in both 2020 and 2024. Throughout both campaigns, she has been openly critical of the Democratic Party's leadership, taking particular issue with how the DNC \"suppresses\" candidates that are not a part of the \"establishment.\"\nIn her letter, Williamson envisioned the party under her leadership as one that \"listens more\" to its members, \"advocates unequivocally\" for the working class, and possesses \"the humility to recognize we need to look in the mirror, and be willing to reinvent ourselves.\"\n\"Our ultimate success will be creating in people's minds a sense that in order to further that legacy, your smartest move is to vote for Democrats,\" Williamson wrote. \"And the party will be worthy of that trust.\"\nCover photo: Sean Rayford / GETTY IMAGES NORTH AMERICA / Getty Images via AFP",

    "text": "Is honey good for you? The impressive health benefits during cold and flu season Honey is a sweet treat that evokes warmth and comfort, and has the reputation of being a soothing elixir during [cold and flu season](https://www.today.com/health/cold-flu). No wonder honey sales peak in January, according to the National Honey Board, the industry promotion board. Made by bees from flower nectar, honey has been eaten and used for medicinal purposes by humans for thousands of years. But is honey really good for you? Honey nutrition: Honey is naturally about 80% sugar, so it’s calorie- and energy-dense. One tablespoon of honey contains the following, according to the [U.S. Department of Agriculture](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/169640/nutrients): 64 calories 17 grams of carbohydrates 17 grams of sugar Honey has no fat, protein, fiber or cholesterol, but one tablespoon contains trace amounts of calcium, iron, magnesium, potassium, selenium, vitamin C and folate. In all, honey contains about [180 types of different compounds](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6225430/), including various [phytochemicals](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9862941/), or plant-based bioactive compounds, studies have found. What are the health benefits of honey? If you’re choosing between different types of [sweeteners](https://www.today.com/health/natural-artificial-added-sugars-what-s-difference-t195002), there might be some benefit of honey due to all the different compounds it contains, says Maya Vadiveloo, Ph.D., a registered dietitian and an associate professor of nutrition at the University of Rhode Island. “There’s been some research showing that it has more antioxidants, and it’s relatively a better source of potassium and some minerals than, say, table sugar,” Vadiveloo tells TODAY.com. “But I wouldn’t rush out to be eating honey as a health food… it’s still a source of added sugar.” Honey contains [antioxidants](https://www.today.com/health/eat-more-antioxidants-add-these-7-foods-your-diet-t95646) such as phenolic acid and flavonoids, which make it a slightly better choice than sugar, but both should be consumed in moderation, says Elisabetta Politi, a clinical dietitian at the Duke Lifestyle and Weight Management Center in Durham, North Carolina. As a source of antioxidants, some studies suggest honey can help prevent heart disease, she adds. A recent [study](https://temertymedicine.utoronto.ca/news/sweet-honey-reduces-cardiometabolic-risks-u-t-study-shows) found consuming around 2 tablespoons of honey a day alongside a healthy diet may improve cholesterol levels — reducing LDL cholesterol and triglycerides while increasing HDL cholesterol, says Diego Garzon, a clinical dietitian at UHealth, the University of Miami Health System. “(But) honey is sugar like any other sugar,” Garzon tells TODAY.com. “At the end of the day, it should only be consumed in a very small amount.” Which kind of honey is the best? Darker honey generally has a higher antioxidant content than lighter honey, with Illinois buckwheat honey showing the highest antioxidant activity, according to the [National Honey Board](https://honey.com/images/files/Detailed-Nutrition-Information.pdf). No matter what the floral source is, Garzon recommends eating raw honey, which hasn’t been heated or filtered, “so it tends to be a very pure form of honey without any of the nutritional content being compromised,” he says. Foodborne pathogens don’t survive in honey so heating it doesn’t provide any food safety advantage, according to the [Mayo Clinic](https://connect.mayoclinic.org/blog/transplant/newsfeed-post/unpasteurized-foods-and-raw-honey/). How is honey used for healing? Honey has antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and wound healing properties. Some of honey’s components might kill certain bacteria and fungi; it can keep skin from sticking to wound dressings and might provide nutrients that speed wound healing, according to the [National Library of Medicine](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/738.html). Honey is possibly effective for improving the healing of burns, cold sores, and the swelling and sores inside the mouth caused by chemotherapy or radiation, the agency notes, citing the Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database. Topical honey products might also improve the symptoms of rosacea, it adds. Is honey effective for cough? Yes, in head-to-head studies, honey either did as well or outperformed cough medicines, Dr. John Torres, NBC News senior medical correspondent, said in a [TODAY segment](https://www.today.com/video/how-does-the-bivalent-covid-19-booster-work-151786053664) that aired on Oct. 28, 2022. “It did a really good job,” Torres noted. When children with an upper respiratory tract infection were given either a dose of buckwheat honey, a cough suppressant or no treatment to relieve nighttime cough, their [parents rated honey as the most effective remedy](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/571638), a study published in JAMA Pediatrics found. It reduced cough and helped the kids sleep. “The mechanism of cough suppression is not well understood, but honey has been shown to have both anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties. ... It may also just be that it coats a sore throat,” Dr. Cory Fisher, a family medicine physician at Cleveland Clinic, [previously told TODAY.com](https://www.today.com/health/cold-flu/best-cold-remedies-rcna49678). Honey is “cheap, readily available, and has virtually no side effects, and doctors can recommend it as a suitable alternative to antibiotics” when it comes to upper respiratory tract infections in adults, [researchers reported](https://www.bmj.com/company/newsroom/honey-better-than-usual-care-for-easing-respiratory-symptoms-especially-cough/) in the journal BMJ Evidence Based Medicine. For cough relief, the experts suggested adding a bit of honey to some warm — not boiling hot — tea or water. Does honey help with allergies? No, this is a common myth, but honey doesn’t help with seasonal allergies, according to the [Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America](https://community.aafa.org/blog/aafa-explains-can-honey-help-my-seasonal-allergies). The theory is that local honey helps desensitize the body to pollen, but the pollen bees collect for honey is different from the pollens that cause allergies, the foundation noted. The tiny amount of pollen allergens that might make it into honey would be broken down by the honey-making process and a person’s stomach enzymes during digestion so “you would not ingest enough intact pollen for your immune system to start becoming desensitized to it,” AAFA explains. Health risks Honey should never be given to babies younger than 12 months because of the risk of infant botulism, the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns](https://www.cdc.gov/botulism/prevention.html). It’s safe for children who are at least 1 year old, the agency adds. Honey might slow blood clotting, so it could raise the risk of bruising and bleeding if eaten by people who take medications that also slow blood clotting, the National Library of Medicine cautions. Large amounts of honey might increase blood sugar levels in Type 2 diabetes patients, it adds. The glycemic index — a measure of how quickly a food raises blood glucose — of honey and sugar is about the same, Politi says. Is it OK to have honey every day? Honey is considered an added sugar, which should be limited to no more than 100 calories per day for women and 150 calories per day for men, the [American Heart Association advises](https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/sugar/added-sugars). That’s across all sources of added sugar, which add up quickly, Vadiveloo cautions. If you’re not eating any other sugar, 2 to 3 tablespoons of honey per day should be the maximum, she and the other dietitians interviewed by TODAY.com say. The best way to use honey is as a replacement for other sweeteners since it does provide some slight benefits over white granulated sugar, Garzon advises. “If you don’t mind the taste of honey and you already use sugar in your coffee or tea then yes, I think there can be some benefit of substituting to honey,” Vadiveloo agreed. “(But) I wouldn’t say that you need to have honey as part of a balanced diet. It’s not one of the things to eat more of like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds, legumes — it’s not in that category.” This article was originally published on [TODAY.com](https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/is-honey-good-for-you-rcna132143)",

    "title": "Basket-ball : Wembanyama, le coup dur",
    "text": "Basket-ball : Wembanyama, le coup dur\nLa pathologie a été diagnostiquée à son retour de San Francisco où le Français a honoré le week-end dernier sa première sélection au All Star Game. « Wembanyama devrait manquer le reste de la saison régulière qui s’achèvera le 13 avril prochain, NDLR », précisent les Spurs. « L’équipe communiquera à nouveau en temps voulu. »\n« C’est dur, plus dur que tout, sachant ce qu’il représente pour notre équipe, mais encore plus pour ce qu’il représente pour le basket et son amour du jeu », a réagi son coéquipier Chris Paul.\nCar la nouvelle relève évidemment du coup dur, aussi bien pour « Wemby » que pour son club, que le N° 1 de la draft 2023 souhaitait ramener en play-off pour la première fois depuis 2019.\nSan Antonio, actuellement 12e de la conférence Ouest avec un bilan négatif de 23 victoires pour 29 défaites, devrait avoir du mal à atteindre cet objectif sans lui tant le pivot de 2,21 m surfait cette saison sur des bases statistiques très élevées (24,3 pts, 11 rebonds, 3,7 passes décisives et 3,8 contres de moyenne en 46 matches).\n« Une blessure assez rare »\nUne thrombose veineuse se caractérise par la formation d’un caillot de sang dans une veine qui vient la boucher. Son apparition au niveau de l’épaule « est assez rare », indique le docteur Victoria Tchaikovski, médecin du sport à la Clinique Drouot à Paris. « Dans la majorité des cas, relève-t-elle, cela vient dans les jambes. »\nPlus généralement appelée « thrombose veineuse d’effort », celle-ci peut se développer chez de jeunes athlètes sans problème de santé. Ces derniers, détaille le Dr Tchaikovski, « font des efforts physiques intenses, ils ont beaucoup de muscles dont certains pressent la veine sous-clavière (sous la clavicule, NDLR) » qui va alors se boucher après plusieurs matches, ou entraînements.\nPour la soigner, on prescrit le plus souvent des anticoagulants. Un traitement qui peut durer « quelques semaines à quelques mois ». C’est cette durée qui empêche alors la pratique de sports de contacts, jugée trop dangereuse, poursuit le Dr Tchaikovski, mais « la douleur peut se résorber en quelques semaines, et au bout de quelques jours, on ne risque plus de complications graves ».\nSi une activité physique n’est pas prohibée, un retour sur les terrains reste évidemment flou. « Il se peut qu’il rejoue dans six semaines, tout est possible. Mais s’il a fait un très gros caillot, avec des douleurs, il ne faut pas oublier que cela peut gonfler, faire mal. Sa circulation dans le bras peut mettre trois ou quatre mois à revenir. Cela dépend de la sévérité et de sa prise en charge », dit-elle encore.\nD’autres joueurs concernés\nL’intérieur de 21 ans pourrait remis être à temps pour disputer éventuellement l’Euro-2025 avec les Bleus qui aura lieu du 27 août au 14 septembre dans quatre pays hôtes (Lettonie, Chypre, Finlande et Pologne).\n« On est suffisamment éloigné du mois d’août pour régler le problème », estime Victoria Tchaikovski, qui rappelle également qu’il y a « un pronostic positif à long terme. Le risque de la thrombose est en aigu. Une fois qu’on a passé la phase aiguë, et qu’il est sous traitement, le pronostic devrait être positif », avec a priori « quasiment 100 % de retour sur les terrains ».\nD’autres joueurs évoluant en NBA ont été victimes de pathologies similaires. Ausar Thompson, des Detroit Pistons, arrêté après la découverte d’un caillot en mars 2024, a repris la compétition et a disputé 33 matches cette saison. Brandon Ingram, des Toronto Raptors, a repris après avoir traité un caillot au bras droit en 2019.\nEn revanche, Chris Bosh, champion à deux reprises avec le Miami Heat, a été contraint de prendre sa retraite sportive à l’âge de 32 ans après avoir été touché à de multiples reprises.",

Em seu mais recente relatório mensal, a Redbelt Security, consultoria especializada em cibersegurança, divulga uma curadoria detalhada que revela as principais vulnerabilidades exploradas por cibercriminosos no último mês.\nEste levantamento não apenas destaca os riscos enfrentados por empresas de todos os portes, mas também reforça a necessidade de práticas proativas para mitigar os danos potenciais.\nAs vulnerabilidades recentemente identificadas são:\n• Hackers usam arquivos corrompidos para burlar as defesas de antivírus e e-mail – Pesquisadores de segurança cibernética chamaram a atenção para uma nova campanha de phishing que aproveita documentos corrompidos do Microsoft Office e arquivos ZIP como forma de contornar as defesas de e-mail. A atividade maliciosa envolve o envio de e-mails contendo arquivos ZIP ou anexos do Office que são intencionalmente corrompidos de forma que não possam ser verificados por ferramentas de segurança. Essas mensagens visam induzir os usuários a abrir os anexos com falsas promessas de benefícios e bônus dos funcionários. O objetivo final desses ataques é enganar os usuários para que abram documentos com armadilhas, que incorporam códigos QR que, quando digitalizados, redirecionam as vítimas para sites fraudulentos para implantação de malware ou páginas de login falsas para roubo de credenciais.\n• Nova técnica de malware pode explorar o Windows UI Framework para burlar ferramentas de EDR – Uma técnica recém-desenvolvida aproveita uma estrutura de acessibilidade do Windows chamada UIA (Automação da Interface do Usuário) para executar uma ampla gama de atividades maliciosas sem alertar soluções de EDR (detecção e resposta de ponto de extremidade). Pior ainda, os invasores locais podem aproveitar esse ponto cego de segurança para executar comandos e ler/gravar mensagens de/para aplicativos de mensagens como Slack e WhatsApp. Além disso, também pode ser potencialmente armado para manipular elementos da interface do usuário em uma rede.\n• Invasores exploram o Microsoft Teams e o AnyDesk para implantar o malware DarkGate – Uma nova campanha de engenharia social alavancou o Microsoft Teams como uma forma de facilitar a implantação de um malware conhecido chamado DarkGate. Embora o ataque tenha sido bloqueado antes que qualquer atividade de exfiltração de dados pudesse ocorrer, as descobertas são um sinal de como os agentes de ameaças estão usando um conjunto diversificado de rotas de acesso iniciais para propagação de malware.\nRecomenda-se que as organizações habilitem a autenticação multifator (MFA), coloquem ferramentas de acesso remoto aprovadas na lista de permissões, bloqueiem aplicativos não verificados e examinem minuciosamente os provedores de suporte técnico terceirizados para eliminar o risco de vishing.\n• 390.000 credenciais do WordPress comprometidas em ataque via GitHub – Mais de 390.000 credenciais do WordPress foram comprometidas em uma campanha maliciosa que explorou vulnerabilidades associadas a repositórios do GitHub. Um repositório específico, agora removido, promovia uma ferramenta WordPress projetada para publicar postagens no sistema de gerenciamento de conteúdo (CMS). No entanto, essa ferramenta foi utilizada para exfiltrar credenciais, afetando usuários de forma massiva. Essa atividade é parte de uma campanha de ataque mais ampla conduzida por um agente de ameaças conhecido como MUT-1244 (abreviação de \"Misteriosa Ameaça Não Atribuída\"), identificado pelo Datadog Security Labs.\nA campanha envolveu técnicas de phishing e o uso de repositórios GitHub comprometidos que hospedavam códigos de prova de conceito (PoC) para explorar vulnerabilidades conhecidas. Um dos projetos utilizados, chamado yawpp no GitHub, permitiu o envio das credenciais extraídas para uma conta no Dropbox controlada pelos invasores. Esse comprometimento afetou até mesmo agentes de ameaça não relacionados, que obtiveram acesso às credenciais por meios ilícitos, aumentando o alcance do ataque.\n• Cisco alerta sobre exploração da vulnerabilidade ASA WebVPN – A Cisco emitiu uma atualização para alertar seus clientes sobre a exploração ativa de uma vulnerabilidade identificada há mais de uma década, que afeta o Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA). A falha, rastreada como CVE-2014-2120 (pontuação CVSS: 4,3), está relacionada à validação insuficiente de entradas na página de login do WebVPN no ASA. Essa brecha pode permitir que invasores remotos não autenticados conduzam ataques de script entre sites (XSS) contra usuários-alvo do dispositivo. Em uma revisão publicada em dezembro, a Cisco destacou que identificou \"tentativas adicionais de exploração\" dessa vulnerabilidade. Aos usuários do Cisco ASA, a recomendação é clara: mantenham seus dispositivos sempre atualizados para mitigar os riscos associados.\nDiante desse cenário, a consultoria enfatiza que as empresas precisam enxergar a segurança cibernética não apenas como uma defesa contra ameaças, mas como um elemento central de sua estratégia de negócios. Isso requer um investimento contínuo em soluções tecnológicas de ponta, combinadas com a capacitação de equipes para lidar com cenários cada vez mais complexos. Além disso, é essencial adotar uma abordagem holística, que integre ferramentas avançadas, processos automatizados e práticas de governança voltadas à proteção de dados.\nCom o suporte de especialistas em cibersegurança, as organizações podem antecipar riscos, fortalecer sua resiliência e, ao mesmo tempo, transformar os desafios do ambiente digital em vantagens competitivas no mercado global.",
