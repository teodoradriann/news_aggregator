    "text": "JANESVILLE — The day was waning but the July sun still beat hot Wednesday as six young performers took to the grandstand stage at the Rock County Fair.\nThe youth were competing for prize money and local fame in a new event debuting at this year’s fair — the Rock County Idol contest.\nRock County Fair Board President Beth Burdick said organizers had hoped for more participation, but were happy with those who signed up, who were all between 10 and 16 years old.\n“It’s awesome to be able to give these kids the space to show off their talents,” said Burdick, who said the fair hopes to offer the contest again in 2026.\nThe cash prizes were significant.\nContestants went away with $500 as the first place winner, $250 for second place and $100 for third place. They chose their own song and performed it however they liked. Two contestants played the guitar while they sang.\nThe winners were Hunter Wirth, first place; Lucas Dahle, second place; and Bella Bolthouse, third place.\nJudges said they were impressed by the thought contestants put into their song choices and performances.\n“The song selection that people choose is really important. Thinking about who they are, what they really resonate with, and what fits their voice really well in the venue and space, makes a huge difference,” said Matthew Knutson, one of the judges “These performers did a great job. Everyone came up here confidently, sang, and did really well.”\nIn an unexpected moment of generosity, Grizz, the emcee for the night, pulled out his wallet at the end to present contestants who didn’t place in the top three a small cash reward.\n“I believe everybody here deserves something, so I’m gonna give $20 to each competitor, because they absolutely rocked it,” he said. “It takes a lot to get on this stage, a lot of courage, and they showed that tonight”\n“Keep honing your craft and come on back here next year and try and win 2026,” he said, while shaking each of their hands.\nPerformances\nBolthouse performed “Popular” from the Broadway musical “Wicked,” bringing a fun, animated energy to the stage.\nBolthouse is no stranger to the stage. She’s performed in multiple school musicals and even sang the national anthem at two baseball games. Currently, she’s part of the cast of “Mary Poppins,” a summer musical at Starlight Theatre.\n“I’ve been singing since I was probably around six,” she said. “I love singing, so this is what I’m passionate about.”\nDressed in a pink outfit that reflected her bubbly character and love for performance, she also did her makeup to match.\nClaire Seichter, 10, took on a challenging solo performance of “Déjà vu,” by Olivia Rodrigo, a song she delivered with poise beyond her years.\n“I’ve been singing at least for six or seven years,” she shared. “I like singing, and it was just a fun opportunity.”\nYet, stepping into the spotlight still came with a few butterflies.\n“I enjoy performing,” she admitted, “but I’m also very terrified. I get embarrassed really easily.”\nShe said she was proud to be singing solo and thrilled for the chance to stand on stage.\nHarper Tunks, 11, of Edgerton, lit up the evening with her rendition of “Better When I’m Dancing,” by Meghan Trainor.\n“I’ve been singing since I was two, but I’ve been performing for, like, two years,” Tunks said. “I feel like singing is fun, and I like performing in front of people.”\nShe donned a sparkly getup with makeup to match.\n“I love being extra and, like, sparkly,” she said.\nTunks said was pretty nervous, but excited. None of that was noticeable when she performed, confidently strutting down the runway of the grandstand.\nTunks has some experience in the past performing in front of large crowds, including at Janesville Jolly Jingle.\nFair schedule\nThe Rock County Idol contest on Wednesday night is just one of a many events in this full week of fair fun and entertainment.\nThe Rock County Fairgrounds, 1301 Craig Ave., in Janesville, will be open each day of the fair starting at 8 a.m. with all the traditional fun — exhibits, animals, food, music, a carnival and live daily entertainment.\nThe theme of this year’s fair is “Neon Lights & Country Sights.”\nRemaining grandstand entertainment this year includes Blue Steel at 4:30 p.m. on Thursday; Pink Houses at 3 p.m. on Friday; Totally Neon Band at 7 p.m. on Friday; Jay Matthew at 6 p.m. Saturday; and Niko Moon at 8 p.m. Saturday. Rice Bull Riders are the Grandstand entertainment at 4 p.m. Sunday.\nMore information, including the full week’s schedule of events, carnival specials and ticket prices is all at www.rockcounty4hfair.com.",

    "text": "Magelang (ANTARA) - The Environment and Forestry (LHK) Ministry on Thursday organized the Festival of Collaboration for Sustainability at Menoreh hill, Magelang district, Central Java, as part of an effort to promote the rehabilitation of watersheds. On the occasion, Dyah Murtiningsih, the ministry's director general of watershed management and forest rehabilitation, said that the government has devised the Forest and Land Rehabilitation program to help Indonesia achieve the targets outlined in its Nationally Determined Contributions document. According to a statement received from the Magelang government, she made the remarks while speaking on behalf of LHK Minister Siti Nurbaya Bakar at the festival. Murtiningsih said that efforts to rehabilitate watersheds in Menoreh are a follow-up to the directives of President Joko Widodo (Jokowi) regarding the development of agritourism. \"We can see that the Menoreh hill genuinely lacks water. For that reason, President Jokowi has instructed Madam Minister to take rehabilitation measures,\" she informed. The director general then highlighted that the main objective of the rehabilitation of Menoreh's watersheds is to identify the most suitable planting and preservation measures and enable more transparent and accountable evaluation schemes. Meanwhile, Magelang regional secretary Adi Waryanto said that the festival is meant to step up collaboration between the government, people, and business actors to support the continuous rehabilitation of forests and watersheds. He noted that the district government has taken a variety of environmental preservation measures, which have included forming the Jogo Tuk community, establishing a tree bank, conducting periodic reforestation, organizing dissemination and mentoring, creating infiltration wells, and arranging a profile book of water springs.

At the festival, a multi-party commitment was also signed regarding marketing support for local farmers' produce and the provision of digital marketing training by the LHK Ministry to farmers. The festival concluded with the inking of the Menoreh Charter of Collaboration For Sustainability.",

    "title": "“Fixing what’s broken”: Norfolk community leaders meet with EPA to discuss environmental justice",
    "text": "Berkley activist Kim Sudderth pleaded with leaders this week: “Please, do not use environmental justice as a buzzword.” About two dozen federal, state and local leaders met at Norfolk State University Wednesday to discuss how to address disproportionate environmental impacts experienced by marginalized local communities. The roundtable was organized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to jumpstart more work in Hampton Roads on what’s known as environmental justice. The federal government defines the term as “the just treatment and meaningful involvement of all people, regardless of income, race, color, national origin, tribal affiliation, or disability, in agency decision-making and other federal activities that affect human health and the environment.” Garry Harris, president of the nonprofit Center for Sustainable Communities based in Portsmouth, said at the meeting that environmental justice “is not a project. “EJ is fixing what’s broken in communities which is causing a disproportionate impact.” Nationwide, people of color face a roughly 28% higher health burden – the impact of health problems as measured by mortality, cost and other factors – compared to the general population, in part because they often live near facilities that emit air pollution, according to a 2018 EPA study. In Hampton Roads, for example, the historically Black communities of Lambert’s Point in Norfolk and Southeast Newport News have long complained of coal dust from nearby terminals pervading the area and causing high rates of asthma. Leslie Gillespie-Marthaler, director for environmental justice in EPA’s Mid-Atlantic Region, said the agency has been working with Lambert’s Point. That spurred their interest in other areas of Norfolk facing issues. “There are a lot of challenges here, with flooding, with legacy industrial sites, and of course, with environmental justice marginalized communities,” she said. “We’re trying to fix some of these issues — not just put a Band-Aid on it, but trying to go back and really understand, how do we make these communities stronger?” Another thing that drew the EPA’s interest was the activism of the Southside Coalition, a group of residents from communities on Norfolk’s Southside including Campostella, Berkley, Campostella Heights, Oakleaf and Diggs Town. The coalition has been fighting to be included in Norfolk’s floodwall project with the Army Corps of Engineers. Their exclusion stemmed from the way the Corps evaluates a project’s worth, known as a cost-benefit analysis, which prioritizes protecting the dollar value of real estate. That leaves lower-income areas at a disadvantage, especially because of historic discrimination in urban planning that suppressed property values. Kim Sudderth, a Berkley resident who serves on Norfolk’s Planning Commission, represented the Southside Coalition at this week’s meeting with the EPA. She said it feels like leaders are finally listening. “It’s usually those of us who are on the end of environmental injustice having these conversations, trying to convince decision makers to participate,” Sudderth said. “This was the opposite, where it was the decision makers reaching out, saying, ‘We want to bring you to the table, listen and learn and then work together on solutions.’” She pleaded with leaders at the table this week: “Please, do not use environmental justice as a buzzword.” The environment is more than just natural elements like land and rivers, Sudderth said. “At the center of environmental justice is people, and I'd like everyone to remember that.” Ru Williams, environmental justice coordinator with the nonprofit Elizabeth River Project, said it can be hard for residents of disadvantaged communities to focus on environmental concerns when they’re already facing pressing issues like access to healthy, affordable food. “I think in order for things to be most beneficial, you have to address those concerns first,” Williams said. The group plans to meet with the EPA again soon, with a list of specific projects or initiatives they’d like to see in Norfolk – such as cleaning up Steamboat Creek in Campostella Heights after an oil spill a few years ago.",

    "text": "EXTON, PA, Nov. 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Spherix Global Insights has published a new white paper, Earlier Diagnosis and Treatment: The Key to Better Outcomes in Hidradenitis Suppurativa , underscoring how early intervention with advanced therapies can significantly enhance patient outcomes in Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS). This chronic, inflammatory skin condition, which affects approximately 1% of the EU & US population, often goes undiagnosed or misdiagnosed for years, causing painful abscesses, scarring, and a profound reduction in quality of life.\nThe white paper draws on extensive data and expert insights to analyze current treatment patterns, barriers to early intervention, and the transformative potential of proactive therapeutic strategies in HS management. By promoting earlier diagnosis and intervention, the authors aim to address the gaps in awareness and treatment, supporting healthcare providers in optimizing outcomes for HS patients and improving long-term health prospects.\nWith advancements in biologic therapies, the HS treatment landscape is evolving, creating dynamic opportunities for innovation and market growth. This white paper offers a data-driven analysis of HS diagnosis and treatment trends, highlighting the potential for pharmaceutical innovation in a rapidly growing HS market.\nKey Insights from the White Paper Include:\nImpact of Early Diagnosis : Hidradenitis Suppurativa is often misdiagnosed as acne or other skin conditions, leading to delays in care for many patients. The data shows that early intervention with advanced therapies—especially biologics—can significantly improve outcomes and increase treatment adherence, particularly when treatment begins in moderate cases before disease progression.\nBiologics as Transformative Therapies : Biologic therapies such as adalimumab and secukinumab are revolutionizing the management of moderate to severe HS. These therapies have shown impressive efficacy when introduced early, driving shifts in prescribing patterns. Dermatologists are increasingly considering biologics in moderate cases, yielding improved patient outcomes and underscoring the importance of advanced treatments at earlier disease stages.\nMarket Growth Potential : Increased awareness and diagnostics, coupled with novel therapeutic options, are driving growth. Current estimates from Komodo Health Inc. indicate the HS market is poised to grow significantly, with diagnosed and treated patients projected to more than double by 2035. The introduction of new therapies, including recent biologics, has driven a 27% increase in biologic-treated patients year-over-year, underscoring expanding market potential.\nStrategies for the Future : To advance HS care, the white paper outlines actionable recommendations, including raising provider awareness, promoting multidisciplinary care, and improving access to biologic therapies through patient support programs and streamlined pathways.\nAlice B. Gottlieb, MD, PhD, a dermatologist and rheumatologist as well as a clinical professor and medical director at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, New York states, “Hidradenitis suppurativa is one of the most challenging chronic inflammatory conditions we treat, with substantial unmet needs that call for innovative solutions. Advancements in early diagnosis and biologic therapies offer real hope, allowing us to intervene sooner and more effectively to improve patient outcomes and quality of life.”\nEarlier Diagnosis and Treatment: The Key to Better Outcomes in Hidradenitis Suppurativa serves as an essential resource for healthcare providers, policymakers, industry leaders, and patient advocacy groups. By prioritizing early intervention and developing targeted therapies, pharmaceutical companies can make a significant impact on patient outcomes while addressing an evolving market with substantial potential.\nAbout Spherix Global Insights  \nSpherix is a leading independent market intelligence and advisory firm that delivers commercial value to the global life sciences industry, across the brand lifecycle.\nThe seasoned team of Spherix experts provides an unbiased and holistic view of the landscape within rapidly evolving specialty markets, including dermatology, gastroenterology, rheumatology, nephrology, neurology, ophthalmology, and hematology.
