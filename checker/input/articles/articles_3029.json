    "text": "The hippopotamus, also known as the hippo, is the third-largest living land mammal after the elephant and rhino. An adult male hippo can weigh up to 3,200 kilograms. Now imagine the giant flying! Sounds scary, right? Well, guess what, hippos, in fact, can fly! PexelsHow hippos lift offScientists in the UK have claimed that hippos can be airborne. A group of researchers at the Royal Veterinary College in North Mymms, Hertfordshire, has found that they do lift up from the ground. No, this doesn't mean that hippos can fly like birds, but when they run at top speed, they can glide through the air for a period of time.Also read: Trio of male lions flee for their lives from aggressive hippo in water streamWhat scientist foundAnalysis of videos of two hippos at Flamingo Land in North Yorkshire moving in their paddock showed hippos got all four feet off the ground at once up to 15% of the time when thundering along at full pelt. PexelsWhen comparing their videos to online footage of hippos moving, they found the animals were able to almost trot, even when walking slowly or running quickly.Similar to movements elephants, rhinos According to the researchers, this puts hippos in the same league as the two other largest land animals - elephants and rhinos, which also use a standard four-footed walk, with a footfall sequence of left hind, left fore, right hind, right fore.Also read: Baby Hippo And Giraffe's Meeting Reminds People Of Madagascar's CharactersProf. John Hutchinson, who led the study, said it was “really impressive” to see how hippos got airborne when they moved quickly. PexelsWhy it is hard to study hipposHe said: \\\"It's hard to work with hippos as they tend to stick to the water and very seldom are trained to be studied in zoo collections.\\\"They're also very dangerous. That's part of the reason why science knew little about how hippos move before our research.\\\" Hutchinson further said that he wants to study them more and learn if baby hippos can do something that adults can’t.For more news and current affairs from around the world, please visit Indiatimes News.",

    "text": "Bogotá\nEl delegado de la Conferencia Episcopal Colombiana para las relaciones Iglesia – Estado, Monseñor Héctor Fabio Henao, invita a los colombianos a escuchar con humildad y con capacidad de servicio para superar la división que hay en el país. En estos días de Semana Santa desde la Iglesia Católica piden a los ciudadanos desprenderse de odios innecesarios y aprender a escuchar para poder vivir en comunidad y superar los niveles de polarización que hay en el país.\n“ Hoy hablamos de diálogos, los diálogos deben tener la capacidad de escucha, pero mucha humildad, y de servicio. Esas palabras humildad y servicio nos van a llevar a nosotros a alcanzar una meta que va mucho más allá que la lucha por el poder, y la lucha a través de la violencia. Se trata de la búsqueda de hacer presente una realidad completamente distinta basada en el amor ”.\nMonseñor Héctor Fabio Henao asegura que para cambiar realidades en los territorios de Colombia los gobernantes tienen que dejar de un lado el ego y ponerse al servicio real de las comunidades.\n“ Jesús nos invita a ser constructores de paz , buscando siempre oportunidades de servir a los demás, eso es parte del proceso de paz, ser capaces de ponernos al servicio de todos y reflejando el amor incondicional de Dios”.\nEl delegado de la Conferencia Episcopal Colombiana para las relaciones Iglesia – Estado, Monseñor Héctor Fabio Henao es claro es afirmar que para ser constructores de paz hay que escuchar con humildad y sentir las necesidades de los demás, ponerse en los zapatos de los que realmente saben que es vivir en medio del conflicto armado en Colombia y darle la importancia al diálogo para superar las diferencias.",

    "text": "The number of antisemitic hate crimes recorded by many of the UK’s largest police forces jumped sharply in the weeks following the outbreak of the Hamas-Israel conflict, new figures reveal.\nIslamophobic offences also rose for some forces, although the picture was more mixed across the country.\nJewish charities called the findings “shocking”, while campaigners against anti-Muslim abuse said the data was “deeply worrying”.\nThe Home Office condemned the rise in offences, adding: “There is no place for hate in our society.”\n(PA Graphics) The figures have been obtained by the PA news agency using Freedom of Information requests. They show that:\n– Greater Manchester Police recorded 74 antisemitic offences in the month following the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7, compared with 15 for the same period in 2022 and 14 in 2021, while West Yorkshire Police recorded 53, compared with 10 (2022) and 14 (2021).\n– West Midlands Police recorded 22 antisemitic offences from October 7 to November 7, compared with one (2022) and eight (2021), while Merseyside Police recorded 20 compared with four (both 2022 and 2021).\n– The British Transport Police had one of the largest increases, recording 87 antisemitic offences in the month after October 7, up from eight in the same period in 2022 and 11 in 2021, as well as a jump in Islamophobic offences with 22 (2023), up from two (2022) and eight (2021).\n– West Yorkshire recorded 49 Islamophobic offences in this period in 2023, up from 29 (2022) and 38 (2021), but the pattern was not so clear for Greater Manchester (34 in 2023, 43 in 2022 and 42 in 2021) or West Midlands (25 in 2023, 33 in 2022 and 23 in 2021).\n(PA Graphics) The Community Security Trust described the figures as “shocking” and said they made clear “the extent of the unacceptable rise in anti-Jewish hatred across the country since the Hamas terror attack on October 7”.\nA spokesman for the Jewish charity said: “This wave of antisemitism was triggered by the mass murder, rape and kidnapping of Jews in Israel, and is fuelled and sustained by extremist hatred online and on our streets.\n“It is essential that perpetrators are identified and prosecuted, and that wider society shows its disgust for this racist hate crime.”\nTell Mama, which monitors and works to tackle anti-Muslim sentiment and abuse in the UK, told PA that “levels of anti-Muslim hatred and discrimination are deeply worrying, impacting trust in authorities and their sense of identity and belonging”.\nIman Atta, the organisation’s director, said there had been a “significant spike in anti-Muslim hate since the atrocities on October 7”, adding: “The nature of many offline cases sent to our service is often overtly racist – targeting Arab and Palestinian communities with dehumanising slurs, anti-Muslim slurs or in some cases targeting their homes, or when speaking Arabic in public, as well as targeting Muslim communities across all ages and gender.\n“We should never allow such hatred and intolerance to take root in our communities and at this time, please look out for each other, whether Muslim or Jewish. We must stand together against intolerance, hate and racism.”\nThe Metropolitan Police, the largest force in the UK, said delays prevented it from supplying full figures until the new year, but it had previously reported 218 antisemitic and 101 Islamophobic offences between October 1 and 18 this year, compared with 15 and 42 respectively in the same period in 2022.\nPA obtained full responses from 31 of the 46 forces across the UK, with the data representing a snapshot of what has currently been recorded by forces and is therefore subject to change.\nMethods for recording hate crime are not consistent across forces, so the data cannot be used to compare the number of offences between different areas or provide an overall total for the whole of the UK.\nBut the figures do point to a jump in antisemitic offences recorded by forces concentrated mostly in cities or across built-up areas, while the pattern for Islamophobic offences was more varied.\n(PA Graphics) Some forces that operate across a mix of urban and less populated areas tend to show a similar pattern, although with lower volumes of offences – for example Hertfordshire Police (17 antisemitic offences for the period in 2023, compared with six in 2022 and three in 2021) and Thames Valley Police (21 antisemitic offences in 2023, one in 2022 and four in 2021).\nData obtained from smaller forces, or those covering areas with few towns or cities, typically showed low numbers of offences, often in single figures, meaning a clear trend was hard to determine.\nA spokesman for the Board of Deputies of British Jews said the findings “provide further evidence of the huge upsurge in antisemitism following the Hamas massacre of October 7”.\nThe board, seen as the voice of the British Jewish community with over 300 deputies directly elected by the synagogues and communal organisations they represent, told PA the rise in antisemitism had “caused enormous anxiety for Jewish people, particularly children and Jewish students on campus or indeed anyone easily identified as Jewish by their dress”.\nA spokesman added: “We call on police to take strong action against anyone found to be perpetrating hate crimes.”\nThe Muslim Council of Britain said: “Despite the extremely low reporting rate from Muslim communities, the huge increase in Islamophobic hate crimes recorded with the police reflects what we are seeing from third-party reporting groups.\n“The Government’s laissez-faire attitude to Islamophobia contrasts strongly with its no-tolerance approach to antisemitism. We are hopeful this will now change.”\nA spokesperson for the Home Office said: “There is no place for hate in our society and we condemn the recent rise in reported antisemitic and anti-Muslim hatred.\n“We expect the police to fully investigate all hate crimes and work with the CPS to make sure the cowards who commit these abhorrent offences feel the full force of the law.\n“Following recent events, we have also made further funding available to Jewish and Muslim communities, to provide additional security at places of worship and faith schools.”",

    "text": "Biden is about to wrap another dismal year as his administration’s participation in the genocide in Israel is set to wreak havoc on his 2024 presidential campaign. People across the US have been taking to the streets, protesting the ongoing Israeli’s siege on Palestinians in Gaza since October 8. As the death toll in Gaza nears 22,000, the United States and the Biden administration continue to unconditionally support Israel. As a result, voters, especially Arab-American voters, have abandoned their support for Biden and the Democratic Party [in droves](https://www.npr.org/2023/11/17/1213668804/arab-americans-michigan-voters-biden-israel-hamas-palestinians). But Biden is no stranger to neglecting the demands of his base, as his record as president has shown: 1. Mass protests condemn Biden’s participation in genocide The Biden administration as directly and indirectly facilitated the genocide in Gaza. Biden himself has [bypassed Congress](https://peoplesdispatch.org/2023/12/12/the-world-goes-on-strike-for-palestine/) to send weapons to Israel, and continues to push for massive Israel military aid packages at the legislative level. The seven-day pause in Israeli aggression ended following Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s visit to the state, when he essentially gave the [greenlight](https://peoplesdispatch.org/2023/12/09/as-the-us-vetoes-unsc-ceasefire-resolution-the-people-take-the-streets-for-palestine/) to Israel to resume strikes on Gaza. Biden has participated in pro-genocide rhetoric, openly [questioning](https://peoplesdispatch.org/2023/12/09/as-the-us-vetoes-unsc-ceasefire-resolution-the-people-take-the-streets-for-palestine/) the validity of the Palestinian death toll. The White House went as far to condemn the progressive congress members calling for a ceasefire, calling the pressure for peace [“repugnant”](https://peoplesdispatch.org/2023/12/04/the-us-political-establishment-has-remained-complicit-in-israels-crimes-every-step-of-the-way/) and “disgraceful.” 2. Working class in jeopardy as social safety net destroyed Biden’s domestic policy is a reflection of overzealous military spending and a willingness to neglect the needs of his own people. Biden has allowed for the further destruction of the COVID-era social safety net during his presidency. Due to the so-called “unwinding” of pandemic-era public healthcare expansion, [at least 2.2 million children](https://www.axios.com/2023/12/19/children-health-insurance-medicaid-unwinding#:~:text=Context%3A%20At%20least%202.2%20million,for%20Medicare%20and%20Medicaid%20Services.) have been removed from the government insurance program Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program—although the real number could be [closer to 3 million](https://ccf.georgetown.edu/subtopic/unwinding-phe/). Experts say that Biden [has not done enough](https://apnews.com/article/medicaid-eligibility-texas-florida-disenrollments-fe7c10276e86ab909060dd6fbea60328) to stop the purging of up to 30 million people from public health insurance programs. It is not only states with Republican leadership that are some of the worst offenders in “purging” people off of Medicaid roles—states with governors [from Biden’s own Democratic Party](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/08/09/bidens-health-care-wins-undone-medicaid-00110389) are also doing the same. “The same Congress where the Democrats control the Senate, the Republicans barely control the house, five million people, and more than 1.5 million of them are children, who can no longer go to a doctor because Congress has decided that Medicaid expansion, which took place during COVID has been rescinded,” [said](https://peoplesdispatch.org/2023/09/07/brian-becker-it-is-time-for-us-movements-to-decide-stand-with-the-masses-or-stand-on-the-sidelines/) socialist leader Brian Becker at the Dilemmas of Humanity conference in Atlanta this summer. “It’s not because they don’t have the money, they decided to do this. They decided to do this. I mean they just spent [880 billion dollars](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/congress-passes-886-billion-defense-policy-bill-biden-sign-into-law-2023-12-14/) for the next military budget for one year. 880 billion dollars. And they’re saying we don’t have the money for low income families and their children to go to a doctor?” 3. Cost of living squeezes workers as Biden looks on Meanwhile, conditions remain dire for working people, with [over half of those surveyed](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2023/demo/hhp/hhp63.html) by the US Census having some difficulty affording basic weekly expenses. Food prices have risen dramatically during Biden’s administration, rising by [10.6%](https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2022/consumer-price-index-up-7-1-percent-over-the-year-ended-november-2022.htm) from November 2021 to November 2022, and continuing to rise by [2.9%](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/price-of-food) from November 2022 to November 2021—in part due to the ongoing war in Ukraine that Biden only wants to continue. 4. Student loan borrowers granted no relief due to Biden’s failures Federal student loan payments, which had been on pause since March 2020, resumed on October 1 of this year following a series of failures by the Biden administration and Democrats to enact significant debt relief. In August of 2022, Biden [ launched a student loan debt relief program that](https://peoplesdispatch.org/2023/02/07/bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-program-in-jeopardy/) would have zeroed out the debts of 20 million people. However, conservatives led legal challenges against the program that immediately halted it before anyone’s debt could be forgiven. The case against the program was taken up all the way to the conservative Supreme Court, which [ struck down](https://peoplesdispatch.org/2023/06/30/us-supreme-court-strikes-down-student-debt-relief-another-blow-to-education-for-all/) the measure in June. The Debt Collective, a group which organizes student loan borrowers into a “debtor’s union,” claims that Biden had executive authority to [do far more](https://tools.debtcollective.org/run/student/#/1) to keep college grads out of debt. 5. Building on a legacy of broken promises Biden started off his presidency breaking major campaign promises to the people of the US. One major promise was to raise the federal minimum wage from a paltry USD 7.25 an hour to USD 15, a goal of the organized labor movement for many years. Instead, only a few months into his presidency, he gave up all pretenses of a fight by surrendering to a technicality in the Senate proceedings, which his administration [could have easily bypassed](https://peoplesdispatch.org/2021/03/01/deciphering-bidens-excuse-to-abandon-the-fight-for-15/). Also early into his presidency, Biden [shorted](https://peoplesdispatch.org/2021/03/11/bidens-stimulus-plan-falls-short-of-addressing-deep-economic-inequality-in-the-us/) the people of the United States on stimulus checks. In the version of Biden’s American Rescue Plan that was finally passed by Congress in March of 2021, the originally planned COVID-19 stimulus check was brought down from USD 2,000, as promised by Biden and the Democrats during his election campaign, to USD 1,400. The additional weekly unemployment benefits of USD 300 passed in the Plan were much smaller than the USD 600 that was previously afforded in the CARES Act, passed in March of 2020 during Trump’s presidency. Biden [put up zero fight](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/06/business/economy/unemployment-benefits.html#:~:text=Jobs%20Report-,Unemployment%20Benefits%20Expire%20for%20Millions%20Without%20Pushback%20From%20Biden,enhanced%20federal%20aid%20to%20end.) in September of 2021, when expanded pandemic-era unemployment benefits expired for 7.5 million people. It is highly likely that the candidates from the two major parties in 2024 will be Biden and Trump—two presidents who oversaw the deterioration of the living conditions of the vast majority of people in the US. Many are looking for an alternative to the Republican and Democratic tickets. Several strong contenders for President have emerged, including the socialist and anti-imperialist campaign of Claudia De La Cruz, which has been openly challenging Biden’s policy regarding Israel, among other things. This Christmas Eve, may the world remember that Genocide Joe and the settler colonial state of Israel have killed over 10,000 Palestinian children. They have killed baby Jesus 10,000 times over. They have taken the holy out of Christmas Day. May we continue to fight for a free… [https://t.co/mCEaIn7hMw] — Claudia (@Claud9_) [December 24, 2023]",
