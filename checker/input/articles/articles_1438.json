    "title": "Breaking down the 49ers Pro Bowl selections",
    "text": "Ahead of their Week 18 matchup against the Los Angeles Rams, the San Francisco 49ers saw nine players be named to the Pro Bowl, the most of any NFL team. On the offensive side of the ball, quarterback Brock Purdy, fullback Kyle Juzczyk, running back Christian McCaffrey, tight end George Kittle, and left tackle Trent Williams were all selected. On the defensive side of the ball, defensive end Nick Bosa, defensive tackle Javon Hargrave, linebacker Fred Warner, cornerback Charvarius Ward were selected. Of the nine players, only Hargrave was listed as a backup. In our latest podcast episode, we discussed the 49ers’ Pro Bowl selections, pointing out potential snubs, while breaking down each of their seasons. The video for the show is embedded above, while the audio is available below. You can listen to The Rohan Chakravarthi Show on [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-rohan-chakravarthi-show/id1665472154), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/5djyS54CaCbFCJdy7wUTmV), or [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@rohanchakravarthi7828). At quarterback, Brock Purdy was a fan-vote leader, but his MVP-esque season led him to be the NFC’s starter at the position. McCaffrey, another player who was in MVP conversations at times this season, was the leader at running back, with Philadelphia’s D’Andre Swift and Los Angeles’s Kyren Williams backing him up. George Kittle has arguably been the league’s best tight end this season, which is why it made sense that he made the Pro Bowl as a starter, with Detroit Lions rookie Sam LaPorta backing him up. Defensively, one of San Francisco’s two top defensive tackles made the Pro Bowl, as Javon Hargrave was the third player selected behind stars Dexter Lawrence and Aaron Donald. In the secondary, Charvarius Ward earned his Pro Bowl, as he was named a starter alongside Dallas’s DaRon Bland. Ward has been excellent this season, leading the league in pass deflections, while recording several interceptions over the past few weeks. [While the 49ers certainly got their praise with nine selections, one notable omission was wideout Brandon Aiyuk, who was not one of the four NFC receivers selected.](https://www.ninersnation.com/2024/1/4/24025463/kyle-shanahan-brock-purdy-nick-bosa-49ers-playoff-picture)",

The novel follows shop-worker Keiko, who challenges societal norms by showing no interest in having a relationship or moving to a different job.\nHer character was isolated by society for not wanting to have a husband or start a family. Muraka herself worked in a convenience store, and didn’t start writing until she was in her forties. The short novel, her 10th book and first to be translated, was wacky, introspective and, as is Muraka’s style, beautifully descriptive.\nHave you tried Focail and Conundrum?\nDaily word puzzles designed to test your vocabulary and lateral thinking skills.",

    "title": "Enquête sur la pression menée par des musulmans intégristes sur les français maghrébins participant aux fêtes occidentales comme la Saint-Valentin ou Noël : « Ne fais pas comme les mécréants »",
    "text": "De nombreux Français d’origine maghrébine sont sous la pression de musulmans intégristes, qui considèrent que célébrer les fêtes «occidentales» relève notamment du «shirk», un péché mortel en islam.\nZineb est une jeune Française d’origine algérienne, âgée de 27 ans. Comme tous les jeunes de son âge, elle voulait, pour ses 25 ans, marquer le coup. Elle avait ainsi prévu d’organiser une grande fête d’anniversaire, et donc de privatiser une petite salle de réception de sa commune, en région parisienne. Elle voulait y accueillir ses amis et sa famille proche, autour d’un buffet et d’une piste de danse. C’était la première fois qu’elle avait l’idée de réunir ses parents, son frère, sa sœur et ses amis dans un même endroit.\nZineb a toujours vécu dans une famille musulmane dite «modérée», ne consommant pas de porc, allant à la mosquée lorsque c’est possible, mais ne sombrant jamais dans l’obscurantisme ou les interdictions «débiles». […] Alors, au cours d’un repas réunissant une dizaine de membres de sa famille, elle profite de l’occasion pour évoquer son projet. Mais ce dernier ne s’avère pas au goût de tout le monde: l’un de ses cousins, qu’elle voit en de rares occasions, commence à lui faire un «rappel sur l’islam». «Fêter son anniversaire, ça n’a rien de musulman», lui martèle-t-il. «Il m’a dit devant mes parents que je ne devais pas faire “comme tous ces mécréants”, et que selon lui, faire une fête de cet acabit impliquait tout un tas de “péchés“ qui allaient me mener “à ma perte”», nous confie-t-elle. Parmi ces péchés, la présence de femmes en présence d’hommes et la diffusion de musiques «satanistes». […]\nSofiane, qui a aujourd’hui quitté l’islam, a témoigné d’une situation similaire, qui l’a coupée de la quasi-totalité de sa famille. «Ma famille n’a pas toujours été aussi pratiquante qu’aujourd’hui. La religion a pris de plus en plus de place au fil du temps, surtout quand mon père et mon frère se sont mis à fréquenter une mosquée à Marseille », commence-t-il auprès du Figaro. «Petits, pour nous faire plaisir, mes parents organisaient un “semblant de Noël”», avec des cadeaux, un repas… «Mais ils se sont vite fait rappeler à l’ordre par un oncle d’Algérie, qui était à l’époque membre du FIS (Front islamique du Salut, ancienne formation politique qui militait pour la création d’un État islamique en Algérie, NDLR)», continue Sofiane. […]\nLes témoignages de Zineb et Sofiane sont les plus marquants d’une longue liste parvenue au Figaro. Sarah, quadragénaire divorcée qui fêtait Noël avec ses enfants, s’est vue menacée par son propre père d’être «reniée» après qu’il a appris la nouvelle.

Alex’s daughter Ella is also on the vacay.\nRodriguez last played baseball in 2016 as third baseman for the New York Yankees, before hanging up his glove and leaving the sport as one of the most feared hitters ever.\nDespite being an immortal player, A-Rod admittedly let himself go a bit in retirement, so much so his family expressed concern for him in late 2021, saying he “looked unhealthy.”\nRodriguez decided to make some changes to his life (more plants, less red meat, intermittent fasting, and walking) … and he says it made all the difference.\nIn 2023, Alex revealed, with help and support from Jac, he’d lost 32 pounds!\nRodriguez didn’t spend the whole trip posing without a shirt (though could you blame him?) … he also spent some quality time with his fam, from some fun in the sun to a chess game with his daughter.\nA-Rod isn’t the first athlete we’ve seen who actually looks fitter in retirement … 46-year-old\n[Tom Brady](//www.tmz.com/people/tom-brady/) has [avoided shirts like the plague](//www.tmz.com/2023/03/28/tom-brady-shirtless-beach-football-session-rob-gronkowski-julian-edelman-danny-amendola/) since he retired, and [he looks amazing](//www.tmz.com/2023/08/30/tom-brady-shirtless-yacht-pictures-miami-irina-shayk-topless-vacation-bradley-cooper/)! 🔥 [World News](/)|| [Latest News](/news)|| [U.S. News](../../us-news) [Source link](//www.tmz.com/2024/01/05/alex-rodriguez-shares-shirtless-vacation-photo-girlfriend-jac-cordeiro-dominican-republic/)",
