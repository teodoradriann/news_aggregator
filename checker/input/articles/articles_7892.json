    "text": "“公司催化剂每年可在全球防止约2000万吨有害污染物的排放，平均每分钟防止约40吨。”庄信万丰CA（Clean Air，清洁空气）上海厂长朱利介绍。\n　　以数字化开路，庄信万丰将数字化、智能化、绿色化深入融合，以新型工业化推动产业绿色转型。近日，上海证券报记者跟随上海市工业互联网协会走进一线，深入了解其在数字化转型与绿色化发展中的创新实践。作为行业领军企业，庄信万丰通过数字化技术优化生产流程，以智能化手段提升效率，同时将绿色理念贯穿于全产业链，致力于实现可持续发展目标。这一系列举措不仅为行业树立了标杆，也为新型工业化的推进提供了宝贵经验。\n　　 让生产智能化高效化\n　　位于上海松江的庄信万丰（上海）化工有限公司是庄信万丰在中国建立的第一家工厂，目前该工厂拥有多条可生产汽车尾气排放控制催化剂各类产品的生产线，产品覆盖三元催化转化器、颗粒捕集器、柴油氧化催化器、柴油颗粒物过滤器等。\n　　走进车间，记者看到一筐筐浅棕色的“蜂窝煤”，这些圆柱体内部排列着不少细长的通气孔。这就是庄信万丰生产的催化剂。汽车尾气通过这些催化剂后，一氧化碳、一氧化氮、碳氢化合物（HC）等有害气体将转化为空气中的氮气、二氧化碳和水，同时过滤掉排气中的颗粒物（PM）。\n　　“没有催化剂，汽车就不能满足日益严格的环保要求，这堪称‘汽车的环保芯片’。”朱利介绍。\n　　“催化剂产品核心材料为铂族贵金属，价值较高，因此哪怕只有千分之一的浪费，我们都不能接受。同时，催化剂上如果有轻微的破损或缺陷，都是不合格的。”朱利介绍，“工厂一年的报废成本就有上千万元，非常惊人，因此通过技术手段提高良品率尤为重要。”\n　　借助数字化系统，庄信万丰已经实现自动化精密涂覆和数字化质量控制，建立了智能制造数据系统平台，涵盖了生产、仓储、销售等全流程，实现了生产计划、库存管理、订单跟踪等功能的智能化，有效提升了工厂的整体运营效率。\n　　“管理人员能实时掌握产线数据，公司废品率、报废率、原料损失率、不良质量成本均大幅下降。”朱利介绍，庄信万丰借助数字化系统，严控生产端资源成本与能源消耗。自2020年起，每升催化剂生产成本、能源消耗、用水效率、综合生产效率OEE等多个生产时间指标获优化。\n　　 数字化转型五步走\n　　将多块催化剂测试块放在元素分析仪上，盖上外罩，点击按钮，元素分析仪就开始自动测试，并将测试结果传送到相关系统完成智能判定，同时汇总了测试过程的相关绩效数据。这就是庄信万丰的SMART质量实验室。\n　　SMART质量实验室的背后是公司不断推进数字化的步伐。在朱利看来，数字化的转型并非一蹴而就。\n　　“数字化的起点是产线自动化。”朱利说，如果没有自动化设备、纯依靠人工，数据就无法产生和自动捕捉。同时，由于各个设备型号并没有非常标准化，将设备打通仍存在一定壁垒。对于不少工厂而言，数字化转型最大的投入是硬件设备。\n　　“建设智能工厂分五步走。”公司实验室经理兼工厂首席数智官汪竹介绍，先是设备自动化，引入先进设备与机器人技术打基础；接着触点数字化，改造传统设备以采集监测数据；而后信息互联网，借物联网打破信息孤岛；再是数据模型化，深度挖掘数据形成操作模型；最后决策数字化，运用智能算法与模型支持决策，实现精细化管理与持续优化。\n　　据介绍，2019年，庄信万丰上线了MES制造执行系统，实现了对产线绩效数据的实时管理；2020年，公司通过新的SAP系统优化各个职能模块业务流程；2021年，实验室的全数字化管理实现，无人工数据、无纸质记录的设备和系统数据自动传输得以实现；2022年，庄信万丰上线的能源管理系统实现了电能、燃气等能耗数据的实时采集和分析，成功降低产品制造过程6%的单位能耗。\n　　“其中，在数据及信息安全管理转型过程中，贸然求进可能会影响数据质量和信息安全，乃至带来数据相关风险。”汪竹说，推动数据标准化，建立数字化管理团队，落实数字化定期审查格外重要。\n　　“未来，公司将继续深化数字化与日常工作的融合。公司将打造一个怎样的新平台？这个平台将如何赋能生产力？又有哪些具体落地场景可供探索？这些都是需要思考和实践的方向。同时，团队还需要更多既懂业务又懂技术的复合型人才，助力数字化转型的稳步推进。”朱利表示。",

    "title": "Kathy's Story: How Spinal Surgery Helped Her Ride Horses Again",
    "text": "Kathy Torrey has ridden horses since she was 3 years old. She owns three horses and can ride for hours at a time. She goes on frequent weekend riding trips with a group of friends, enjoying the scenery of north central Pennsylvania.\n“(My favorite parts are) just the freedom and having the connection with your horse, and of course, the friends and the scenery,” says Kathy, 74, of Austin, Pa.\nIn 2024, however, a constant numbness in her legs was making it difficult to walk, let alone ride. Imaging revealed that Kathy had a tumor in her spine that needed removal.\nNeurosurgeon Fadi Sweiss, MD, UPMC in North Central Pa., surgically removed Kathy’s tumor in July 2024. Nearly a year later, Kathy is back riding horses again.\n“I have absolutely no tingling in my legs,” Kathy says. “I can’t say enough good about it. It was just amazing.”\nA ‘Constant’ Numbness\nKathy first started feeling the numbness in her legs in spring 2024.\nShe describes it as a “constant” numbness in her legs. She mentioned the issue to her chiropractor, who recommended stopping her appointments until they could discover the problem. Kathy tried taking magnesium supplements and other treatments, but the numbness continued.\n“It was constant,” she says. “There was no relief whatsoever, no matter what I did.”\nHer horseback riding friends became concerned when they noticed she was having trouble walking, including falling.\n“They said, ‘OK, you’re going someplace. We’re taking care of it,’” she says.\nOne of Kathy’s riding friends worked at UPMC Williamsport, and she recommended that Kathy see a neurologist. Some other riding friends who were nurses agreed.\nNever Miss a Beat!\nSubscribe to Our HealthBeat Newsletter!\nThank you for subscribing!\nYou can now select the specific newsletters you'd like to receive.\nYou are already subscribed.\nSubscribe to more newsletters in our email preference center.\nSorry, an error occurred. Please try again later.\nGet Healthy Tips Sent to Your Phone!\nSeeking Care at UPMC\nKathy visited her primary care provider for a referral to a neurologist. However, the soonest available appointment through that health care system was in October. So, she contacted her friend who worked at UPMC and landed an appointment at UPMC Neurological Institute in Williamsport within a week.\nAlthough Williamsport was two hours away, she made the trip with one of her nurse friends. She visited with Weizhen Wang, MD, neurologist, UPMC Neurological Institute in Williamsport, in mid-July 2024.\nConcerned about Kathy’s symptoms, Dr. Wang ordered a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of Kathy’s spine. The imaging showed a tumor on her thoracic spine — the middle part of her back. The tumor was compressing Kathy’s spinal cord, causing her symptoms.\n“She was extremely kind,” Kathy says of Dr. Wang. “She went over the MRI and explained everything. She said, ‘We have to do more testing. We don’t know if it’s benign or what’s going on.’\n“She took it from there. She got the ball rolling.”\nDr. Wang referred Kathy to neurosurgery. Holly Shadle, DNP, CRNP, certified registered nurse practitioner, UPMC Neurological Institute in Williamsport, fast-tracked her for surgery.\nBefore surgery, Kathy underwent a full-body MRI at UPMC Cole in Coudersport, Pa., near her home. While she was getting the MRI, the team gave her headphones to listen to music. The final song that came on was “That’s My Job” by Conway Twitty, one of her late mother’s favorite artists.\n“I was like, ‘I’ve got this,’” Kathy recalls, getting emotional. “‘They’re looking out for me — my mom is. She’s right here with me.’\n“After that, I had no concerns that it was going to be benign. I knew it. It was just such a calming thing, like, ‘Well, it’s in their hands now.’”\nScheduled for Surgery\nKathy scheduled surgery with Dr. Sweiss at UPMC Williamsport for July 29, 2024. It was about two weeks after her initial appointment with Dr. Wang.\nDr. Sweiss performed a laminectomy, removing a small portion of bone in the back of Kathy’s thoracic spine to relieve pressure. He also removed the tumor.\n“Dr. Sweiss was so kind,” Kathy says. “Just very, very nice and gentle. And evidently, he knew what the heck he was doing.”\nKathy stayed in the hospital for four days after surgery. She did some physical therapy while she was there to ensure she could walk and perform other routine tasks. She no longer felt numbness or tingling in her legs.\n“When I came home, (Dr. Sweiss) had me on restrictions, of course — and I followed those to a T,” she says.\nHer daughter visited from Colorado, and her son visited from Virginia to help her during her recovery. Within a few months, she felt fully recovered — and by fall, she was riding again.\nBack Riding Horses Again\nAlmost a year after surgery, Kathy feels strong. She’s well enough to take care of all of her household chores, including caring for her three horses.\nShe’s also back to riding horses frequently. Although she doesn’t ride every day, she does go several times a week. One of her favorite trips is going to the Austin Dam, a four-hour round trip on horseback from her home. Another favorite is Benezette, Pa., home of Pennsylvania’s elk herd.\n“It’s beautiful riding,” she says.\nIn May 2025, she and her friends went on a riding trip to Benezette. Kathy rode her horse for four hours a day for four or five straight days.\n“When I came home, I was really sore, but I took a hot shower, and I felt great the next day,” she says. “It’s just a matter of getting all the muscles back to where they should be.”\nDr. Sweiss told Kathy that her tumor had likely been in her spine for at least 15 years. Her chiropractic adjustments apparently tweaked the area of her tumor enough that she began experiencing symptoms.\n“I’m very thankful for that because I don’t know how long it would have gone on (otherwise),” Kathy says. “It could have been a heck of a lot worse than it was.”\nKathy says she’s grateful to her entire team for the care they provided, from the initial diagnosis to her fast-tracked surgery. She also says everyone treated her kindly, including sending her a card during her recovery. Her friends also helped her by coming with her when she got care.\n“It was like everything fell into place, like it was just supposed to be,” Kathy says. “You have to appreciate all the steps that people took to get me there, and get the surgery, and get the doctors’ appointments.\n“It was just meant to be. That was the place that I was supposed to be, the people that I was supposed to see, and I’m so grateful to the doctors, the nurses, and my friends for getting me there. It was amazing.”\nSources\nAbout Neurosurgery\nThe UPMC Department of Neurosurgery is the largest academic neurosurgical provider in the United States.

    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

DKK 70m going forward.\nGiven our resilient business model combined with the executed initiatives and our strategic focus areas, we are convinced that Solar will be able to improve profitability in our strategy period.”\nH1 key financial messages\nStrong revenue growth for Solar Polaris in the trade segment.
