    "title": "Recruiters using AI could be discriminating against older workers",
    "text": "On average a recruiter will go through 250 CVs for each job listing, where there is also only a 17% chance an individual’s cover letter will be read. With the rise in redundancies and companies experiencing a reduction in their budget to use towards hiring and training new candidates, leads to many recruiters and HR experts having less time to go through hundreds of CVs, thereby resulting in using AI technology to help in the process.\nResearch suggests 48% of UK recruitment agencies use some form of AI technology when hiring candidates. This could be in the form of Application Tracking Systems (ATS), where recruiters use the software to collect all the CVs and scan them for keywords and experiences in order to pick the right candidates to go forward for an interview.\nYet, AI-driven recruitment tools may unintentionally discriminate against older candidates, primarily because these systems are often trained on historical data that may reflect biassed hiring practices or criteria. A recent survey by Totaljobs has highlighted how there is already age discrimination against over 50s who are searching for a new job, where they found one in seven (15%) candidates over 50 have been rejected from a job explicitly due to their age.\nAs some recruiters are still showing signs of age discrimination during the hiring process, some experts believe this could be affecting the AI algorithms which are currently used when scanning CVs.\nMatthew Vohs, Founder and CEO of O50C and V&C, has highlighted the use of AI during hiring processes and how it might also be having an effect on those aged over 50 being chosen for certain jobs based on the previous hiring data of the employer.\nHe’s found some of the key reasons why Artificial Intelligence is having an impact on age diversity in the workplace.\nAI model may favour younger employees in their search\nWhen recruiters use AI tools to go through CVs and streamline talent, it can sometimes use AI algorithms that follow past data which often prioritises candidates with certain work histories or skill sets. Even in the most subtle ways, some algorithms may filter out candidates based on gaps in employment or previous roles deemed “outdated,” which can disproportionately impact older applicants who may have different gaps due to various life events. Following previous hires in a business’s database, may mean the AI will look for more technical keywords based on more ‘modern’ digital skills and certain job titles which favour younger candidates.\nThe impact of ATS on older candidates\nA common AI tool many recruiters use which is deemed a popular one to be able to streamline talent is the Application Tracking System (ATS), this is particularly useful for recruiters to use when there is a large volume of CVs and it is able to filter through candidates by focusing on keywords in each industry. Due to the criteria set by the recruiter, there tends to be keyword biases in ATS systems that often overlook experiences or skills relevant to older professionals. For example, in the IT and computer science sector some of the keywords include; MATLAB, matrix, software development and software development life cycle. A recent survey by Totaljobs found that 15% of candidates over 50 report age-related rejection during job applications. This report provides insight into how age bias manifests even without AI, if this is already taking place amongst recruiters then AI could replicate such patterns if trained on biassed historical data.\nThe Rapid Growth in digital skills poses a risk of job displacement for older workers\nAround 7.5 million people in the UK lack the essential digital skills that are needed for the workplace. 18% of those people are adults who do not have the skills or abilities that are needed to gain work in the digital sector. This may also affect older candidates who are applying to roles in the digital and technology sector due to the fact AI has the potential to reinforce age bias in the hiring process from the patterns learned from biassed training data. This means that some AI tools which are used to screen CVs are filtering out candidates who have a skills gap or no recent qualifications in that industry, despite any qualifications they already have. With fewer companies actively considering older workers for tech-heavy roles, this then contributes to a perceived lack of interest from older workers in AI-driven positions, when often they just need more training within the digital sector.\nMatthew Vohs, said: “It is no surprise to see the power and influence of AI is now being used for recruitment purposes, as advanced technology has made a positive impact across many industries. Over the years we’ve seen many talent acquisition teams have their budgets reduced, which means there’s now a smaller team of recruiters to go through a higher volume of job applications per job listing, this is where AI can come in and reduce their screening time by 75%.\n“However, I urge all employers and hiring teams to be transparent about how these algorithms are trained and what data they rely on. More companies and businesses, especially in sectors we are seeing an increase in skills shortages, should regularly carry out audits on their AI systems to detect and mitigate age bias, making it more likely for the hiring process to ensure fair outcomes. If more employers could factor in looking into their algorithm criteria, this could show that age inclusivity needs to be more of a priority for organisations.\n“As more of the older generation come out of retirement to continue to work, means more employers need to have strategies in place to help in retaining these employees and offering them support. Having AI recruitment systems that are age-inclusive benefit the entire workforce and ensure we are actively promoting age diversity and fostering a collaborative and inclusive work environment.”",

    "text": "Funding cuts deepen education crisis for Rohingya children in Bangladesh: HRW\nA sharp reduction in foreign aid has deepened the education crisis for nearly half a million Rohingya children living in refugee camps in Bangladesh, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said in a report released today.\nWith the United States and other major donors slashing humanitarian funding, thousands of learning centres operated by aid organisations have been forced to shut down, leaving over 300,000 school-age children without access to education. On June 3, Unicef suspended its support for many of these centres due to funding shortfalls.\nThe only remaining educational options are community-led schools established by the Rohingya themselves. While widely seen as offering higher-quality instruction, these schools lack formal recognition from the Bangladesh government and receive no international funding. As a result, they must charge tuition fees -- ranging from 50 cents to $5 per month -- posing a financial burden many families cannot afford.\n\"The US and other donor governments are abandoning education for Rohingya children after the previous Bangladesh government long blocked it,\" said Bill Van Esveld, Associate Children's Rights Director at HRW. \"The interim government must support inclusive education, while donors should back the Rohingya community's efforts to avoid a lost generation.\"\nInterviews conducted by HRW with over 75 individuals -- including refugee students, teachers, and humanitarian experts -- highlighted growing concerns about children's vulnerability to violence, trafficking, and forced labour as education options disappear. Between January and March 2025, at least 51 child abductions were reported in the Cox's Bazar camps.\nCommunity-led schools, often staffed by Rohingya who have completed secondary education, face challenges due to the lack of certification. Students fear that even after completing class 12, their achievements will go unrecognised.\nHRW urged the interim Bangladesh government to grant official recognition to these schools and called on international donors to support them financially. It also encouraged the inclusion of Rohingya educators in education planning and decision-making processes.\nBangladesh currently does not allow Rohingya children to attend schools outside the camps, a policy HRW says violates international human rights laws, which guarantee the right to education without discrimination.\n\"Education is a lifeline for refugee children,\" Van Esveld said. \"It's time for Bangladesh and its partners to support that right -- not obstruct it.\"",

    "text": "La ministra de Seguridad Social, Elma Saiz. Eduardo Parra - Europa Press La pensión media de jubilación subirá en 52 euros al mes el próximo año y la pensión media, en 46 euros mensuales\nMADRID, 1 (EUROPA PRESS)\nLas pensiones contributivas subirán un 3,8% con la llegada del nuevo año, mientras que las mínimas contributivas aumentarán 6,9%, salvo las de viudas con cargas familiares, que se revalorizarán un 14,1%, desde los 905,9 euros actuales hasta los 1.033,6 euros mensuales. Por su parte, las no contributivas y el Ingreso Mínimo Vital (IMV) se incrementarán también un 6,9%.\nCon esta subida del 3,8% que experimentarán las contributivas en 2024, la pensión media de jubilación aumentará en 734 euros al año ó 52 euros al mes, en tanto que la pensión media del sistema, de 1.200 euros al mes actualmente, aumentará en 638 euros al año, lo que suponen 46 euros más al mes.\nEste porcentaje del 3,8% en el que subirán las pensiones contributivas el próximo año deriva de la fórmula de revalorización acordada en la reforma de pensiones de 2021.\nDicha fórmula liga la subida de las pensiones a la inflación media de doce meses, en este caso a la del periodo diciembre 2022-noviembre 2023, cuyo resultado fue un 3,8%.\nLa subida será efectiva desde el 1 de enero de 2024 y con ella se da cumplimiento a las recomendaciones del Pacto de Toledo de garantizar el poder adquisitivo de los pensionistas en base a la evolución del IPC.\nSegún cálculos de la Seguridad Social, en total, más de 10 millones de pensionistas van a ver conservado o aumentado su poder adquisitivo el próximo año gracias a esta fórmula de revalorización, que se aplicará en 2024 por tercer año consecutivo.\nLAS MÍNIMAS Y LAS NO CONTRIBUTIVAS SUBIRÁN POR ENCIMA DEL IPC\nPor su parte, las pensiones mínimas contributivas y las pensiones no contributivas aumentarán por encima del IPC medio del 3,8%. En concreto, las primeras subirán en 2024 un 6,9%, salvo las mínimas de viudedad con cargas familiares, que lo harán en un 14,1%.\nAdemás, las pensiones no contributivas y el IMV (IMV) aumentarán también un 6,9% el próximo año.\nPara mejorar la equidad y suficiencia de las pensiones, la reforma que aprobó el Gobierno en la anterior legislatura contempla mejoras en 2024 en las pensiones no contributivas.\nÉstas, una vez revalorizadas de acuerdo con el IPC, se incrementarán adicionalmente para reducir en un 20% la brecha existente hasta alcanzar el 0,75 del umbral de riesgo de pobreza calculado a partir de la Encuesta de Condiciones de Vida del Instituto Nacional de Estadística (INE) para un hogar unipersonal.\nAsimismo, la cuantía mínima de la pensión de jubilación contributiva para un titular mayor de 65 años con cónyuge a cargo, una vez revalorizada en función del IPC, subirá adicionalmente para reducir en un 20% la brecha existente hasta alcanzar el 1,5 del umbral de riesgo de pobreza.\nEl objetivo es que la pensión mínima de jubilación contributiva con cónyuge a cargo alcance en 2027 al menos los 16.500 euros anuales (1.178,5 euros al mes por catorce pagas), un 22% más que en 2023.\nLa cuantía mínima de la pensión de viudedad con cargas familiares, las de pensiones contributivas con cónyuge a cargo, excepto la de incapacidad permanente total de menores de 60 años, serán iguales a la cuantía de la pensión mínima de jubilación contributiva para un titular mayor de 65 años con cónyuge a cargo.\nEl resto de las cuantías mínimas de las pensiones contributivas, una vez revalorizadas, se incrementan adicionalmente en un porcentaje equivalente al 50% de los porcentajes resultantes del incremento adicional de la cuantía mínima de la pensión de jubilación contributiva para un titular mayor de 65 años con cónyuge a cargo referenciado al umbral de riesgo de pobreza indicado.\nSegún la reforma vigente, las pensiones no contributivas, por su parte, crecerán también por encima de la revalorización media de las pensiones, hasta converger en 2027 con el 75% del umbral de la pobreza calculado para un hogar unipersonal.\nLA PENSIÓN MÁXIMA SUBE UN 3,8%\nCon la revalorización del 3,8%, la pensión máxima se situará en 2024 en 3.175,5 euros mensuales por catorce pagas, frente a los 3.059,2 euros de 2023.\nEl destope de la pensión máxima inicial comenzará a aplicarse en 2025 y consistirá en revalorizar la pensión máxima con el IPC más un incremento adicional de 0,115 puntos porcentuales cada año hasta 2050, lo que supondrá un incremento aproximado del 3% en ese periodo.\nEl coste de la revalorización de las pensiones, estimado para el conjunto de 2024, es de 7.300 millones de euros. Si se añade la subida de las pensiones mínimas, de las no contributivas y del IMV, esta cifra asciende a 8.280 millones.",
