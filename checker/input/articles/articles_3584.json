    "title": "7 Psychological Habits That Will Make You More Successful Than 98% Of People",
    "text": "Success starts with healing your relationship with yourself.\nBy\n(/users/nick-wignall)\nWritten on Jan 07, 2024\nPhoto: Brooke Cagle | Unsplash\nHere’s my argument for this essay:\nSuccessful people tend to have good relationships with their own minds.\nWhen I get to know people who have been successful — and I use that term successful in a pretty broad sense — it seems to me that many of them have an uncommonly positive relationship with themselves.\nFor example:\n- One of the marks of a healthy self-relationship is that you don’t fall into self-criticism very often or too intensely.\n- Successful people tend to be quite reflective and honest about their shortcomings.\n- But they also tend to avoid the more unhelpful and destructive end of that continuum — self-judgment, rumination, negative self-talk, etc.\nOf course, there are plenty of people who are very successful despite not having a great relationship with themselves. But the exception doesn’t prove the rule.\nIt’s my experience that when you look carefully at people who have achieved and maintained some amount of meaningful success in their lives, one of the hidden factors behind that success is that they don’t get sabotaged and derailed by their thoughts, beliefs, and emotions.\nIt’s a lot easier to be successful when you have a good relationship with your mind.\nHere are 7 psychological habits I’ve observed in highly successful people that we can all learn from — whatever your definition of success is:\n1. They acknowledge their emotions early\nIt’s hard to be successful in any part of life if you constantly get overwhelmed by painful emotions. Of course, we all experience difficult emotions like fear, sadness, or anger. But why is it that some people manage these feelings relatively well while others don’t?\nIt’s easier to manage difficult emotions when you catch them early.\nMost people get overwhelmed by painful emotions because they ignore them or distract themselves when those emotions are small. While this feels good in the short term, it usually leads to those feelings getting much bigger and more intense over time.\nOn the other hand, if you can get in the habit of\nacknowledging your emotions when they first show up — and then validating them instead of trying to get rid of them — you stand a much better chance of staying emotionally balanced and getting on with your most important work and goals.\nRELATED:\nPsychologist Reveals The 6 Mental Habits Making You Insecure\n2. They think about their thinking\nAside from ignoring your emotions when they first show up, the other reason they end up ballooning into giant, overwhelming feelings is because we unintentionally feed them. Specifically, patterns of thinking as chronic worry or negative self-talk lead to much stronger and longer-lasting emotions.\nIf you want to control your emotions, you must learn to manage your thinking.\nMost people are not very aware of their mental patterns. As a result, they find themselves at the mercy of all the emotions those thought patterns lead to:\n- Chronic worry → chronic anxiety\n- Chronic rumination → chronic anger\n- Chronic self-criticism → chronically low self-confidence.\nOn the other hand, successful people often have a habit of reflecting on and paying attention to their thoughts. They’re aware of the role they play in initiating or maintaining unhelpful mental patterns; and as a result, are better at regulating those thought patterns and the emotions that follow.\n3. They’re compassionate with their mistakes\nOne of the things I’ve noticed in observing successful people is that there are two types of successful people…\n- One type is very externally successful, but miserable on the inside.\n- The other type is externally successful and also has a relatively calm and confident interior life as well.\nAnd while many factors could lead to this difference, here’s a big one I don’t think is well enough appreciated:\nIt’s hard to be sustainably successful when you beat the heck out of yourself every time you slip up.\nThe externally successful and internally miserable types often have a pretty intense habit of self-judgment after mistakes. They’re constantly ruminating on past mistakes, worrying about future slip-ups, and generally being kind of nasty to themselves.\nBut the ones whose external success is matched by internal calm almost always have\n a strong habit of self-compassion. They reflect on their mistakes and try to learn from them. But they don’t dwell on them or generalize them to what they mean about them as people.\nPhoto: Darius Bashar/Unsplash\nRELATED:\n18 Experts Reveal The Small Habits That Drain Your Emotional Battery\n4. They listen to their emotions — but rarely trust them\nMost people’s relationship with their emotions falls into one of two extremes:\n- They’re dismissive and avoidant of their emotions. As a result, they don’t know much about them or how much those emotions influence them outside of their awareness (and they do!)\n- They’re obsessed with and overly focused on their emotions. As a result, they frequently get lost in their feelings and are overly emotion-driven in their decision-making and choices.\nOn the other hand, people who tend to be successful often have a middle-ground approach to their emotions:\nThey’re aware of and sensitive to their emotions but don’t put blind trust in them either.\nInstead, they see emotions as one source of potentially useful information but not gospel truth either. And when push comes to shove, they tend to use values rather than emotions to make big decisions.\n5. They update their expectations frequently\nExpectations are powerful beliefs about the future or\nwhat you believe should happen. But they also tend to run in the background of our minds, which means we rarely examine them or question them. As a result, we can end up thinking, feeling, and then acting in ways that are contrary to our values and what we want all because of old, unexamined expectations — either for ourselves or others.\nIf you insist on having expectations, you should insist on having realistic ones.\nA lot of people end up falling into patterns of self-sabotage and bad habits because they’re still operating according to old expectations — often from childhood!\nSuccessful people understand that to continue to make good decisions in an ever-changing environment you need to be regularly examining and updating your expectations so that they actually adhere to reality and move you toward your goals and aspirations rather than away from them.\nRELATED:\n5 Common (But Seriously Unhealthy) Psychological Habits That Hold People Back In Life\n6. They’re serious about self-care\nIt’s very hard work to manage difficult emotions well, think clearly and accurately, update strong beliefs and expectations, manage mistakes and criticism well, and perform all the other psychological functions that success depends on.\nAnd yet, most people rarely do anything to support their minds in accomplishing those functions well. It’s like being a professional athlete and eating a terrible diet. Or owning a sports car and never bothering to get the oil changed.\nRelated Stories From YourTango:\nSuccess depends on a healthy mind. And a healthy mind\ndepends on healthy habits.\nThe term self-care gets a bad rap because it’s been hijacked to mean superficial acts of comfort and pleasure. But in reality,\nself-care means establishing and maintaining habits and routines that support your emotional health and well-being.\nSuccessful people understand that doing your best work depends on being emotionally strong and mentally sharp. But more importantly, they know that those things require time and investment.\nIf you want your mind to work for you, you need to work for your mind.\n7. They’re willing to be emotionally vulnerable\nEmotional vulnerability is another one of those terms like self-care that seems silly and superficial and not worth even thinking much about. But that’s only because most people don’t understand what it means…\nTo be emotionally vulnerable means that, when appropriate, you are able and willing to talk about how you feel — especially when it’s tough. Not only is this important for your emotional health and well-being (see #1), but it’s vital if you want to maintain healthy and effective relationships — which almost all forms of success depend on (probably more than you think).\nFrom business to parenting, a successful voyage depends on all parties feeling confident that they can talk about how they feel. Successful people understand that by modeling their emotional vulnerability and being honest about how they feel, they’re empowering others to do the same.\nPhoto: Ryan Arya/Pexels\nRELATED:\n4 Bad Micro-Habits That Drain Your Cognitive Battery\nMore for You:\nNick Wignall is a psychologist and writer sharing practical advice for emotional health and well-being.

    "text": "Rechazos desde la Iglesia al DNU de Javier Milei\n“Los Equipos de Pastoral Social de las diócesis de Viedma, Alto Valle y Bariloche, los tres de la provincia de Río Negro, rechazamos el DNU presentado por el presidente Javier Milei el miércoles 20 de diciembre”, reza el comunicado emitido por estos organismos de la Iglesia Católica, sumándose de esta manera a otras comunicaciones de voceros católicos surgidas en los últimos días. Por el contrario, hasta el momento no se han conocido declaraciones de miembros de la jerarquía católica respecto de las iniciativas tomadas por el gobierno de La Libertad Avanza.\nLos Equipos de Pastoral Social son organismos oficiales que la Iglesia Católica designa en cada una de las jurisdicciones eclesiásticas del país para atender a las cuestiones sociales desde la perspectiva del magisterio católico y colaborar en la tarea eclesial poniendo especial atención en la situación de los pobres.\n“Entendemos que este decreto atenta contra nuestra vida democrática, que tanto nos cuesta cuidar, para que la paz y la justicia sean su esencia”, dicen los responsables de la Pastoral Social de la provincia de Río Negro, con la firma de Suyhay Quilapán (Viedma), Cristina Martin (Bariloche) y el sacerdote Gustavo Varela (Alto Valle de Rio Negro).\nEn consonancia con lo anterior se afirma que “no podemos permitir que se ignore la división de poderes de este modo, para seguir imponiendo un modelo económico que siga concentrando la riqueza en grupos monopólicos privilegiados”. Se trata, dicen, de “una riqueza que se le niega al pueblo trabajador que la produce, que ahora ve como se intenta que sus derechos -que llevaron décadas conquistar- sean despreciados”.\nY en la misma línea hacen suyas las palabras del papa Francisco en Evangelii Gaudium cuando afirma que “ya no podemos seguir confiando en las fuerzas y en la mano invisible del mercado (…) En el vigente modelo ‘exitista’ y ‘privatista’ no parece tener sentido invertir para que los lentos, débiles y menos dotados puedan abrirse camino en la vida“.\nSostienen los voceros de la Pastoral Social de toda la provincia de Río Negro que “como Iglesia venimos denunciando el avance del liberalismo con su desregulación del mercado, porque propone una sociedad basada en el individualismo y la competencia, y no en la justicia social, la solidaridad y la fraternidad”.\nSegún los representantes de la Iglesia Católica abocados a los temas sociales, “este DNU golpea duro el corazón de nuestras familias, y duele más cuando estamos por celebrar la fiesta de Dios que se hace hermano nuestro, para acompañarnos en la realidad de cada día”.\nEl mensaje finaliza pidiendo a “Dios fuente de la verdad” que “ilumine a nuestros gobernantes para que busquen el bien de todos, privilegiando a los que tienen menos posibilidades”.\n[email protected]",

Unfortunately for one family living north of Atlanta, that’s not the case. Their daughter’s 2022 Honda Civic is melting, WSB-TV reports .\nAccording to Charles Goldberg, his daughter’s side-view mirrors, bumper and other trim pieces began to warp, and bubbles appeared in the paint. “It’s as if someone shot a ray gun at our car,” he told the news outlet, adding, “I’d never seen anything like it. It was also warped and started melting and disintegrating.”\nRead more\nADVERTISEMENT Rebel Moon's Ed Skrein on Co-Starring With His Game of Thrones Replacement\nThe Best RPGs Of 2023\nThe State Of The Nintendo Switch In 2023\nGypsy Rose Blanchard has been released from prison and hopes to meet Taylor Swift\nChinese Chess Champ Stripped Of Title After Taking A Dump In A Bathtub\nThe Goldbergs, however, don’t sound particularly happy with that explanation and have reportedly filed a complaint with Honda corporate. Unfortunately for them, while a quick search for “melting Honda” turns up a number of forum results, if you dig a little deeper, Honda owners aren’t the only ones dealing with similar issues. Still, considering how many complaints there are about melting Hondas, you have to wonder if it could change the type of exterior plastics it uses to make melting less likely to happen.\nMore from Jalopnik\nThe Best Movies You May Have Missed in 2023, and Where to Stream Them\nResearchers Uncover the ‘Most Sophisticated’ iPhone Exploit Ever\nXbox Slammed For AI-Generated Art Promoting Indie Games\nWegovy and Other New Weight Loss Drugs Actually Work—so What's Next?\nIDIOT OF THE YEAR: It's the final countdown (Nos. 10-1)\nSign up for Jalopnik's Newsletter.

    "title": "MWC25: Exploring 5G, AI and IoT innovation - SiliconANGLE",
    "text": "MWC25 Barcelona is set to showcase groundbreaking advancements in AI, 5G and the future of mobile connectivity. As the world’s top telecom leaders, innovators and tech giants gather next week, all eyes will be on how artificial intelligence is reshaping the industry — from AI-driven networks to the next generation of edge computing.\nOne of the most anticipated developments this year is the growing role of telcos in AI edge applications, a shift that could redefine their business models. Industry players, including Qualcomm Inc., Intel Corp. and Nvidia Corp., are gearing up to demonstrate how AI and 5G are converging to unlock new revenue opportunities, streamline networks and accelerate innovation. This includes the launch of a new alliance this month involving firms such as Qualcomm Inc. and Intel Corp. to facilitate an open, harmonized and aligned ecosystem for IoT.\nIndustry observers, such as Chris Lewis , founder and managing director of Lewis Insight Ltd., have seen an evolution in the telco industry as the influence of IT expands. “We used to be an industry that was always self-contained,” Lewis said in an interview with theCUBE. “What the IT world is teaching us, the cloud world is teaching us and the AI world is teaching us is that you’ve got to be more open.”\nTheCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media’s livestreaming studio, will be in Barcelona for coverage of MWC25 Barcelona March 3-6. TheCUBE’s coverage will include interviews with key industry executives and analysts who will explore the intersection of hardware innovation with the rise of edge devices, while examining the latest mobile tech in AI, 5G, IoT and sustainability. (* Disclosure below.)\nSpotlight on AI edge at MWC25 A key development that will be closely followed at MWC this year is the role of telcos in what is expected to be an explosion in AI edge applications . The growth of AI at the edge received further attention earlier this month when Cisco Systems Inc. Chief Executive Chuck Robbins noted during an earnings call that European telco operators were looking to deliver AI as-a-service and that “we see of lot of them planning for AI edge applications.”\nDelivery of AI applications at the edge will require processors to handle the workloads. Along with network powerhouses such as Cisco Systems Inc., silicon providers will likely be in the spotlight at MWC as well. At last year’s gathering, chipmakers Qualcomm Technologies Inc. and Broadcom Inc. were significant participants, demonstrating new capabilities in areas such as mmWave deployment for 5G and software-defined edge technologies for telcos.\nChip giant Nvidia Corp. is expected to expand on its own telco-based initiatives. During its November AI Summit in Japan, Nvidia revealed that SoftBank Group had successfully piloted the world’s first combined AI and 5G telecom network using the chipmaker’s AI Aerial accelerated computing platform. This advancement could open revenue streams potentially worth billions to telecom operators if they can generate inference revenue from an AI-based radio access network, according to Nvidia.\n“Service provider success is critical to the health of the tech sector,” said Zeus Kerravala , principal analyst at ZK Research. “Over the past several decades, the telcos have been continually marginalized to the point where most of their services are considered commodities. With the rise of cloud, mobility and AI, the world has become network-centric, putting service providers in their strongest position for a long time.”\nTheCUBE event livestream Don’t miss theCUBE’s coverage of MWC25 Barcelona event March 3-6.

    "text": "If you’ve ever wanted to do your bit for the conservation of Japanese fauna while also having something adorable in your home, this cute Giant Japanese Salamander plushie might just be the thing for you.\nGiant Japanese Salamander Conservation by The Gaming Beaver\nThe plushie represents the species itself, a fully aquatic amphibian endemic to Japan. With a length of up to 5 feet, the Japanese giant salamander represents the third-largest salamander species in the world. However, due to the effects of pollution, habitat loss and invasive species, its numbers have dwindled to a point where it is now recognized as a Special Natural Monument and Treasure of Japan. Introgressive hybridization with the Chinese variety of salamanders (imported during the 1970s as a food source) is also said to have resulted in 95% of captured giant salamanders in Japan being categorized as hybrids.\nThese particular plushies are being produced by\nJames Beavers, also known as The Gaming Beaver online. Known for his video game content and general fascination with animals, Beavers has also bridged entertainment and education through his interviews with actor Jeff Goldblum from the Jurassic Park franchise and famed paleontologist Jim Kirkland. Represented by talent agency GeeXPlus, Beavers is keen to push out his distinctive blend of content with a hint of Japanese flair. In this instance, the plushies were created to support Sustainable Daisen, a non-profit organization with the goal of protecting and conserving the Japanese giant salamanders in the town of Daisen and beyond. All proceeds of the plushie will go towards conservation efforts as well as education and preservation of the salamanders’ natural environment.\nWhere to get your very own giant salamander plush\nYou can purchase your own giant salamander plush directly from The Gaming Beaver’s own online store found\nhere.\nThe design of the plushie is meant to be adorable but also to showcase some of the hardships that the salamanders go through. Each item comes with an exclusive plush bag to eliminate the use of plastics. To find out more about Sustainable Daisen’s initiatives, you can check out the video below.",

    "title": "UN attacks Africa for attitudes towards abortion",
    "text": "Iulia Elena Cazan (ZENIT News – [Center for Family and Human Rights](https://c-fam.org/) / Nueva York, 12.28.2023).- International abortion groups and UN agencies are influencing the development of massive propaganda programs in Africa. With government officials, they are carrying out large-scale advocacy campaigns to include abortion as an essential health service. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the World Health Organization (WHO) released a [report](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/unlocking-future-advancing-universal-sexual-and-reproductive-health-and-rights-within-universal-health-coverage-east-and-southern-africa) committed to coupling health services and abortion in Southeast Africa and that no country in that region, such as Angola, Botswana, Kenya, Malawi, Uganda and Malawi among others, will be able to attain universal health care without universal sexual and reproductive care. The report admits that access to contraception, pregnancy care, and HIV treatments are already partially included in many universal health care packages in that region. Still, UN agencies push for the inclusion of abortion access and comprehensive sexuality education as “essential” components of health care. To ensure widespread abortion access in the region, the report recommends “strengthening the digital health ecosystem and related self-care interventions.” Earlier this year, the WHO [launched a mobile app](https://unric.org/en/who-comprehensive-abortion-care-tool-mobile-app/) to help healthcare providers offer better abortion “care” to pregnant women. The app “takes the individual characteristics of patients and generates patient-specific assessments or recommendations” and helps facilitate remote patient support to “assist” women while performing abortions at home. The WHO-UNFPA report also shared that a crucial factor in ensuring “comprehensive sexual reproductive health care” is conducting “value clarification” work for providers. This kind of work attempts to “destigmatize” abortion among medical personnel and encourage them to perform abortions. It is clear that many medical personnel in Africa oppose abortion. Ipas, an international organization whose expressed purpose is to promote abortion all over the world, has a full curriculum on this, the Ipas Values Clarification for Action and Transformation (VCAT), and uses it to knock down medical and religious beliefs about abortion across Africa. In a recent [press release](https://www.ipas.org/news/in-the-democratic-republic-of-congo-policymakers-commit-to-including-abortion-in-universal-health-coverage/), Ipas claimed victory in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Comprehensive abortion care is now included in the universal health program and boasted that it was one of the key factors in making this happen. Such policy change did not come about solely by mobilizing civil society organizations. Ipas offered SRH training to government officials, including the DRC Health Ministry personnel. Ipas said it was able to find supporters inside the government. It is clear that money played a huge role in the shift. The Ipas director in the Congo said as much, “the existing government budget is unable to finance integrating abortion care…Ipas is working to secure this missing funding.” It is likely the missing funding came from the Biden administration. While celebrating Universal Health Coverage Day, Ipas said that “a powerful joint statement signed by 60 countries emerged from the United Nations General Assembly in September that calls for sexual and reproductive health and rights to be an essential component of UHC.” This was not a document of the UN General Assembly, however. An international right to abortion has never emerged from the General Assembly and a significant number of UN members consistently delivered statements at the UN clarifying that they do not consider the term “sexual and reproductive health and rights” as to include abortion.",
