    "text": "So much for the dad bod. David Beckham, who turns 50 this year, has released pictures of himself modelling his new bodywear collection for Hugo Boss. Bodywear, if you’re unfamiliar with the term, appears to mean underwear. In the corresponding ad clip , Beckham returns home for the day in his vintage Aston Martin, Bond-style, but he can’t wait to rip off his sharp suit and slouch around in a leather armchair in nothing but his tighty-whities. He has set the bar very high for middle-aged dads who like to relax by sitting around drinking in their pants, Homer Simpson-style. If you feel at all self-conscious about your soft, squishy, beer-induced centre, Beckham’s new line of smalls will not help.",

    "title": "2023 over for Haaland: When will City striker return from injury?",
    "text": "Manchester City and Erling Haaland had not anticipated the striker’s extended stint out of action this season with injury.\nDespite missing time, the Norwegian striker has scored 14 goals in the Premier League thus far this season. However, if the prolific ace could avoid the treatment table, he would have most certainly netted more.\nThe\nCitizens’ bad record and his absence have coincided. However, they did recover to defeat Everton in their second-to-last game of 2023.\nTheir depth of roster and Julian Alvarez’s performance in\nHaaland‘s absence make them capable of handling most situations. However, any team would be troubled by the loss of both the Norwegian and Kevin De Bruyne simultaneously.\nHow many games has Haaland missed so far?\nCity haven’t fielded an attacking threat with Haaland since their 1-0 defeat to Aston Villa in early December. Because of the hectic schedule this month, he has missed six games in all competitions.\nTwo of those matches were fortunately for them—the\nClub World Cup and a UEFA Champions League clash with Red Star Belgrade. Healing from his bone stress response in his foot is taking more time than anybody associated with the club would have preferred.\nThe injury has kept the Norwegian striker out of the previous six games for the Sky Blues, including their meeting against Everton this Wednesday.\nPep Guardiola has now excluded Haaland from the league match the last game of the calendar year, against Sheffield United. Thus, the number of games the 23-year-old has missed so far will increase from six to seven.\nWhen will he return to action?\nThe major issue, according to Pep Guardiola, is when Haaland’s discomfort will go away; he’s hoping to return by January.\n“He’s training a lot but not with the team yet. Kevin is with the team. Erling not yet but feels better”, Guardiola told the\nclub’s official website. “It’s not a stress or fracture but a question on when the pain will disappear. Hopefully [in January he will be back].\n“He has a stress, the bone is fit but painful. He’s not like [Phil] Foden who is small and skinny, Erling is huge so it’s difficult at times. He’ll be fine, and when he is he’ll be back and play. The doctors come every morning and say, ‘This player is available and this one is not.’ Until then, I create the team and we play games.”\nAs a result, Haaland will not be available for the encounters against Sheffield United and, most likely, Huddersfield Town in the opening FA Cup match of the season. His availability for January 13’s match against Newcastle United is also in doubt.\nCity would want to maintain their position in the top four and put some space between themselves and the mid-table clubs who are following them. Thus, this game will be pivotal.\nPHOTOS: IMAGO\n200+ Channels With Sports & News\n- Starting price: $33/mo. for fubo Latino Package\n- Watch Premier League, Women’s World Cup, Euro 2024 & Gold Cup\nThe New Home of MLS\n- Price: $14.99/mo. for MLS Season Pass\n- Watch every MLS game including playoffs & Leagues Cup\nMany Sports & ESPN Originals\n- Price: $10.99/mo.

As winter begins, the forecast warned of potential snowstorms or winter storms that could bring devastating impacts on affected areas. Checking the weather and advisories is recommended, especially if they have any travel plans this week. Homeowners and motorists should stay alert with the weather conditions this week. Commuters should be extra careful in navigating the roads to avoid inconvenience and road hassle. Snow-covered roads and slippery outlooks can also cause dangerous travel in the Midwest and parts of the US. Snow squalls can become dangerous due to the windy and snow conditions.
