    "text": "Viewers have slated Adam Sandler over his 'messy' new Netflix special, Love You, after claiming they couldn't hear anything Viewers have slated Adam Sandler over his 'messy' new Netflix special, claiming they turned the whole thing off after just a few minutes.\nThe Grown Ups actor returned to his comedy roots with a new program, titled Love You, which premiered on the streaming platform on August 27.\nIt served as a follow-up to the 57-year-old's 2018 special, 100% Fresh, and saw him performing for delighted fans, dressed in his signature, casual style of a hoodie, a colorful T-shirt and tracksuit bottoms.\nHowever, despite flying straight into the Netflix Top 10 list, many weren't thrilled by the quality of the 74-minute episode and flocked to social media to share their issues.\nOrganic-Hovercraft-3 revealed their thoughts in a lengthy message on the Netflix Reddit page, penning: 'Let me start out by saying Ive been a big fan of the sandman for decades. With that being said, this special was f**king awful.\n'The audio was absolute dog s**t. Adam mumbling, everyone else just so loud, including the crowd. The sound engineer needs to be fired. All the scripted pieces that are supposed to be candid are tacky and take away from the special.\nAdam Sandler's Netflix special premiered this month (Picture: Netflix)\n'We all pay $25-30 a month for Netflix because it is supposed to be hi quality – both the audio and visuals. And here I am watching some special that looks, and sounds like, it was filmed on a Motorola Razr. Anyone else feel the sams? Or am I f**king crazy?…\nRishma Dosani",

    "text": "ANKARA (Reuters) – Turkey’s radio and television watchdog RTUK on Thursday placed a two-week broadcasting ban on the popular television series “Kizil Goncalar” (Crimson Buds), a board member said, as it was deemed to be against “society’s national and spiritual values”.\nIlhan Tasci, a member of the RTUK board representing the main opposition, said on social media platform X that the regulator had also imposed a 3% administrative fine on broadcaster Fox TV, owned by Walt Disney Co. unit Fox Networks Group.\n“Kizil Goncalar”, which highlights the division between religious and secular segments of society, faced immediate backlash after it was first aired on Dec. 18, even though its first two episodes topped ratings lists and had more than 10 million views on YouTube.\nRTUK has often penalised shows over what it has labelled as violations of Turkey’s moral values, the structure of family, or other issues it considers to be unethical, namely LGBTQ+ rights. Its critics and opposition parties have criticised it for curbing freedoms.\nThe show’s producer, Faruk Turgut, said the series reflected the sociological reality of Turkey, portraying the clash between secular and religious segments of society.\n“I am trying to hold a mirror on the realities of Turkish society. The realities must be discussed, we cannot progress by ignoring them,” Turgut was quoted by daily Hurriyet as saying.\n“They declared war on us, but we will fight until the end.”\nEbubekir Sahin, RTUK chairman and a member of President Tayyip Erdogan’s ruling AK Party, wrote on X that outraged viewers had called for the cancellation of the show, and that its posters on billboards in Istanbul had been vandalised with black paint.\nPro-government media accused the show of being Islamophobic, prompting the cancellation of filming venue permits for upcoming episodes.\nThe Ismailaga Brotherhood, a prominent religious sect in Turkey, sharply criticized the series.\n“Productions in today’s media that target our religion and devout individuals by aiming to denigrate the names of Allah, our noble book the Quran, spiritual institutions such as sects and orders, are absolutely unacceptable,” the sect said on X.\nTasci said the “RTUK has bowed down to cults and sects”.\n(Reporting by Ece Toksabay; Editing by Tuvan Gumrukcu and Sharon Singleton)",
