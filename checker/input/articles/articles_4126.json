Advertisement\n\"Over the past several months, thousands of asylum seekers have been arriving in New York City, from the southern border, without having any immediate plans for shelter,\" Adams wrote in Emergency Executive Order 538 .\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbot has implemented a policy of sending migrants to other states via chartered buses and flights . According to the mayor's office, more than 161,000 migrants have arrived since 2022. Related Democrat mayors call on Biden for help amid migrant surge they blame on Texas Blinken, Mayorkas travel to Mexico for key immigration meeting Texas flies immigrants to Chicago in expansion of Gov. Greg Abbott's busing plan\n\"The city now faces an unprecedented humanitarian crisis that requires it to take extraordinary measures to meet the immediate needs of the asylum seekers while continuing to serve the tens of thousands of people who are currently using the Department of Homeless Services' Shelter System,\" Adams said.\nOn Wednesday, Adams held a press conference calling on the Biden administration to declare a federal emergency and provide financial support.\n\"Cities cannot keep doing the federal government's job for them,\" Adams said. Advertisement\nThe order says the entities sending migrants via buses know the migrants will need shelter when they arrive and that they are being dropped off in \"random locations.\"\nAny driver who knows, or \"reasonably should know,\" that recent arrivals are being sent via their bus routes by third parties will be required to contact the Office of Emergency Management at least 32 hours in advance.\nDrivers also would be required to provide passenger manifests.\nThe executive order also requires drivers to drop off the passengers between 8:30 a.m. and noon Monday through Friday.",

Ventura isn't the only place experiencing tumultuous coasts. The National Weather Service has issued surf and flooding advisories along the California coast and in Hawaii. A video from Ventura officials opens on a seemingly tranquil scene. People are scattered along the seawall, leaning against it and watching the rolling waves in the distance. Suddenly, people start to back away from the wall moments before a wave spikes up in front of them. As it crashes down into the street, many of the people running get their feet knocked out from under them and a truck seems to skip forward in the waves. Another angle captured by [Facebook user Colin Hoag shows the waves chasing him](https://www.facebook.com/1 103854833/videos/339998562146021/) down the street.

En 2024, 60 % des cadres ont bénéficié d'une augmentation salariale, alors même que cette part plafonnait à 46 % en 2021. « Ce taux de 60 % correspond à un pic exceptionnel, car il se situe plutôt autour de 50 % en période normale », confirmait Gilles Gateau, directeur général de l'Association pour l'emploi des cadres (APEC), lors de la présentation le 21 novembre des principaux résultats de l'enquête.\nLa rémunération annuelle brute médiane (fixe + variable) dans cette population atteint désormais 54 000 euros, ce qui signifie que la moitié des cadres gagne plus que cette somme, l'autre moitié moins.

    "title": "Rate of Young Women Getting Sterilized Doubled After ‘Roe’ Was Overturned - KFF Health News",
    "text": "HELENA, Mont. — Sophia Ferst remembers her reaction to learning that the Supreme Court had overturned Roe v. Wade: She needed to get sterilized. Within a week, she asked her provider about getting the procedure done. Ferst, 28, said she has always known she doesn’t want kids. She also worries about getting pregnant as the result of a sexual assault then being unable to access abortion services. “That’s not a crazy concept anymore,” she said. “I think kids are really fun. I even see kids in my therapy practice, but, however, I understand that children are a big commitment,” she said. In Montana, where Ferst lives, lawmakers have passed several [bills to restrict abortion access](https://www.mtpr.org/montana-news/2023-05-24/judge-temporarily-blocks-new-abortion-laws-but-the-legal-fight-has-just-begun), which have been tied up in court. Forty-one states [have bans or restrictions](https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/state-policies-abortion-bans#:~:text=shortly%20after%20birth.-,Highlights,bans%20based%20on%20gestational%20duration.) on abortion, according to the Guttmacher Institute, and anti-abortion groups [have advocated for restricting contraception](https://www.npr.org/2024/05/26/nx-s1-4977618/how-contraception-became-a-political-issue-among-christians-in-the-u-s) access in recent years. After Roe was overturned in June 2022, doctors said a [wave of young people](https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/post-roe-permanent-sterilizations-montana/) like Ferst started asking for permanent birth control like tubal ligations, in which the fallopian tubes are removed, or vasectomies. New research published this spring in JAMA Health Forum shows how big that wave of young people is nationally. University of Pittsburgh researcher Jackie Ellison and her co-authors [used TriNetX](https://trinetx.com/#signe), a national medical record database, to look at how many 18- to 30-year-olds were getting sterilized before and after the ruling. They found [sharp increases](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2817438?utm_campaign=articlePDF&utm_medium=articlePDFlink&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8H7CWBvbjkR2o3OHpD2pxW3nfTBDC6gwYi7ZaHTs5My3z3koQBeM_4U_Q7bUvofu4NxFuITxj4H5L89Qz-cDMtggxeKw&_hsmi=302448984&utm_content=jamahealthforum.2024.0424&utm_source=articlePDF) in both male and female sterilization. [Tubal ligations doubled](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2817438?utm_campaign=articlePDF&utm_medium=articlePDFlink&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8H7CWBvbjkR2o3OHpD2pxW3nfTBDC6gwYi7ZaHTs5My3z3koQBeM_4U_Q7bUvofu4NxFuITxj4H5L89Qz-cDMtggxeKw&_hsmi=302448984&utm_content=jamahealthforum.2024.0424&utm_source=articlePDF) from June 2022 to September 2023, and vasectomies increased over three times during that same time, Ellison said. Even with that increase, women are still getting sterilized much more often than men. Vasectomies have leveled off at the new higher rate, while tubal ligations still appear to be increasing. Tubal ligations among young people had been slowly rising for years, but the ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization had a discernible impact. “We saw a pretty substantial increase in both tubal ligation and vasectomy procedures in response to Dobbs,” Ellison said. The data wasn’t broken out by state. But at least in states, like Montana, where the future of abortion rights is deeply uncertain, OB-GYNs and urologists say they are noticing the phenomenon. Kalispell, Montana-based OB-GYN [Gina Nelson](https://drginanelson.com/bios) said she’s seeing women of all ages, with and without children, seeking sterilization because of the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision. She said the biggest change is among young patients who don’t have children seeking sterilization. She said that’s a big shift from when she started practicing 30 years ago. Nelson said she believes she is better equipped to talk them through the process now than she was in the 1990s, when she first had a 21-year-old patient ask for sterilization. “I wanted to respect her rights, but I also wanted her to consider a number of future scenarios,” she said, “so, I actually made her write an essay for me, and then she brought it in, jumped through all the hoops, and I tied her tubes.” Nelson said she doesn’t make patients do that today but still believes she is responsible for helping patients deeply consider what they’re requesting. She schedules time with patients for conversations about the risks and benefits of all their birth control options. She said she believes that helps her patients make an informed decision about whether to move forward with permanent birth control. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [supports Nelson’s practice](https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/committee-statement/articles/2024/02/permanent-contraception-ethical-issues-and-considerations). [Louise King](https://bioethics.hms.harvard.edu/faculty-staff/louise-p-king), an assistant professor of obstetrics at Harvard Medical School, who helps lead ACOG’s ethics committee, said providers are coming around to the idea of listening to their patients, not deciding for them whether they can get permanent contraception based on age or whether they have kids. King said some young patients who ask about sterilization never go through with the procedure. She recalled one of her own recent patients who decided against a tubal ligation after King talked with them about an IUD. “They were scared of the pain,” she said. But after she reassured the patient that they’d be under anesthesia and unable to feel pain, they went ahead with the intrauterine device, a reversible birth control method. [Helena-based OB-GYN Alexis O’Leary](https://obgynoffices.com/helena-obgyn-staff/) sees a divide between younger and older providers when it comes to female sterilization. O’Leary finished her residency six years ago. She said older providers are more reluctant to sterilize younger patients. “I will routinely see patients that have been denied by other people because of, ‘Ah, you might want to have kids in the future.’ ‘You don’t have enough kids.’ ‘Are you sure you want to do this? It’s not reversible,’” she said. That’s what happened to Ferst when she first tried to get a tubal ligation. She asked her doctor for one after having an IUD for about a year. Ferst recalls her male OB-GYN asking her to bring in her partner at the time, who was a male, and her parents to talk about whether she could get sterilized. “I was shocked by that,” she said. So Ferst stuck with her IUD. But the uncertainty of abortion rights in Montana persuaded her to ask again. She has found a younger OB-GYN who has agreed to sterilize her this year.

    "text": "La viuda de Josh Owen, ayudante de sheriff asesinado, le pide a Tim Walz no asistir al funeral de su esposo: \"Usted nunca apoyó a la Policía\" Shannon Owen le pidió al gobernador de Minnesota y candidato demócrata a la vicepresidencia que se mantuviera alejado del funeral de su esposo, asesinado en cumplimiento del deber. Shannon Owen -la viuda del ayudante del sheriff [Josh Owen-](http://www.swiftcountymonitor.com/pope-county-deputy-josh-owen-killed-line-duty) le pidió al gobernador de Minnesota y candidato demócrata a la vicepresidencia, Tim Walz, que se mantuviera alejado del funeral de su esposo, asesinado en cumplimiento del deber. En una llamada telefónica difundida por [The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/news/2024/10/24/widow-police-officer-killed-tim-walz-not-welcome-funeral/), Owen le advirtió al gobernador que si intentaba asistir, sería escoltado fuera del lugar. La mujer expresó su rechazo a la falta de apoyo de Walz a las fuerzas policiales, especialmente tras las reformas que el gobernador impulsó y respaldó después de la muerte del delincuente George Floyd en 2020: \"Nunca has apoyado a la policía y te agradecería que no te acercaras\". Ante las palabras, Walz respondió con un tono de sorpresa: \"No, entiendo y respeto totalmente tus derechos. Nuestros oficiales están aquí para apoyarte de cualquier manera que necesites\". Allí terminó llamada abruptamente. Owen, frustrado con las reformas policiales progresistas El ayudante del sheriff Josh Owen fue asesinado en sus labores mientras respondía a una llamada por violencia doméstica. Durante el arresto del sospechoso, éste sacó un arma oculta y abrió fuego, disparando cuatro veces a Owen. La primera bala fue fatal, atravesando su corazón y ambos pulmones. Shannon relató la despedida de su esposo el día en que fue asesinado. Eran las 7 de la tarde cuando Josh salió para responder a una llamada de respaldo. Ella y su hijo de 10 años, Rylan, le dieron un abrazo de despedida. \"Gracias a Dios que lo hicimos\". Owen, veterano de la Guardia Nacional con un servicio de dos años en Irak, había estado considerando dejar la fuerza antes de su muerte, molesto por las condiciones laborales. Su esposa asegura que se sentía frustrado con las reformas policiales impulsadas en Minnesota tras los actos vandálicos de Minneapolis en 2020 (y la muerte del delincuente Floyd). \"No lo respetaron\", dijo Shannon. Según la viuda, el propio Josh nunca habría querido la presencia de Walz en su funeral, dado el resentimiento que sentía hacia las políticas del gobernador. La crisis de confianza en la policía Con las protestas violentas llevadas a cabo por los delincuentes, Minnesota se convirtió en el epicentro de una crisis sobre la policía y la raza. Las manifestaciones vandálicas que sacudieron el estado en los días posteriores a la muerte de Floyd llevaron a una ola de disturbios y saqueos. Walz impulsó reformas tras la muerte del delincuente que incluían la prohibición de técnicas como los estrangulamientos, la obligación de los oficiales de intervenir si veían el uso excesivo de la fuerza por parte de sus compañeros y la creación de una base de datos sobre la mala conducta policial. Sin embargo, estas medidas han tenido resultados negativos dejando al estado con altos índices de violencia debido a que los oficiales no pueden hacer su trabajo de manera efectiva. Minneapolis (una vez hogar de una de las fuerzas policiales más grandes de la región) ha visto una dramática disminución en el número de oficiales desde 2020, con una pérdida de más del 40% de su personal. En los últimos 12 meses, cinco socorristas han sido asesinados en Minnesota, incluidos cuatro oficiales de policía y un bombero-paramédico. Un jefe de policía en Minnesota -habló en condición de anonimato- resumió el sentimiento general entre las fuerzas del orden: Él [Walz] no tiene nuestro apoyo.",
