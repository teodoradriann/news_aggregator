    "text": "Backpack ban on boardwalk following unruly Memorial Day weekend crowds\nBy Kim Hudson, Tom Gardiner, Kyle Burton, Kerri Corrado\nClick here for updates on this story\nWILDWOOD, New Jersey (\nKYW) — The City of Wildwood Board of Commissioners on Wednesday approved a ban on backpacks and other large bags on its boardwalks and beaches, which takes effect immediately.\nWildwood city leaders are trying to keep a repeat of what happened last month from happening again. Officials issued a state of emergency over Memorial Day weekend because of large unruly crowds. Beachgoer Timothy Blakeslee, of Wildwood, said he sometimes thinks twice about bringing his daughter to the beach.\n“Yeah, it’s unfortunate. It’s surprising too. It seems to be kind of progressing as well,” he said.\nThe increased violence is why city leaders considered a backpack ban. They said some people are hiding drug paraphernalia and alcohol in the bags. However, Blakeslee was not optimistic a ban would work.\n“They will figure out a way if they want to bring it on, so I don’t know. I don’t think it will make a change at all,” Blakeslee said.\nEbram Bishai, of Bayonne, New Jersey, thought a ban would improve safety but not by much.\n“Maybe a little, because sometimes they still hide it in their underwear. But, I think it will slightly decrease the violence and alcoholic rates here,” Bishai said.\nHowever, beachgoer Chloe Meyers, of Philadelphia, believed a ban would improve safety.\n“The pros being that there will not be as many fights and arguments that there are down here,” Meyers said.\nHowever, she believed a ban would be unfair to all the other law-abiding beachgoers.\nThere were exceptions for baby bags, medical bags and small purses. But as for enforcement, Meyers had a wait-and-see outlook.\n“I think it’s going to be hard to put it into effect. But they can give it a shot, you can never know,” Meyers said.\n“These kids have little to no respect for anyone” Wildwood isn’t the only spot down the Shore that’s had issues with unruly crowds lately, and some state leaders said parents should be held responsible for the actions of their children.\nRepublican lawmakers and a group of New Jersey police chiefs talked about ways to keep the shore safe on Wednesday.\n“I would add that I think that the juveniles and the parents should be held accountable, and beyond that, I think the entire juvenile justice system needs to be reformed,” Ocean City Police Chief Bill Campbell said.\nSome people on the boardwalk said they feel safe, despite the pushes by officials to make parts of the Jersey Shore safer, but they agreed that holding parents accountable might help.\nThe backpack ban in Wildwood comes after a 15-year-old was stabbed on the boardwalk in Ocean City by another teen during Memorial Day weekend.\nDuring the holiday weekend, Wildwood issued a state of emergency, citing numerous incidents of civil unrest.\n“These kids have little to no respect for anyone,” Wildwood Mayor Ernie Troiano said. “No respect for themselves, no respect for their friends and no respect for police, officials, adults — just a total lack of respect for any form of authority, and it’s become an issue where we cannot enforce the laws.”\nBoth Wildwood and Ocean City also have curfews in place to deter the unruly teens and large gatherings.\n“The problem is we have juveniles who believe that they can’t get in trouble for anything they do wrong,” Ocean City Councilman Jody Levchuck said.\nCBS Philadelphia reached out to Gov. Phil Murphy’s office for a response to Wednesday’s meeting, and we were referred to the Attorney General’s Office. We are awaiting a response.\nPlease note: This content carries a strict local market embargo. If you share the same market as the contributor of this article, you may not use it on any platform.",

    "text": "Sony La PlayStation 5 Pro est l’événement Tech et jeu vidéo de cette rentrée 2024. Après des mois de rumeurs sur son design et ses performances, la nouvelle console de Sony est disponible depuis le mois de septembre , mais son prix a refroidi de nombreux joueurs, certains se demandant même si ses performances justifiaient une telle hausse de prix . En effet, la version estampillée Pro de la PS5 coûte près de 800€, soit 250€ de plus par rapport à la version originale. D’autant plus que la liste des jeux optimisés pour cette version Pro n’a pas été diffusée immédiatement, laissant planer le suspens.\nBref, entre bonnes et mauvaises surprises , le lancement de la PS5 Pro ne s’est pas fait sans rebondissements.\nCe qui était prévu VS réalité Selon les promesses de Sony, la PS5 Pro devait proposer une avancée considérable en matière de capacités graphiques par rapport à sa prédécesseuse, soit 45% de performances supplémentaires, capables de faire tourner les jeux en résolution 4K à 60 images par seconde . Ces améliorations étaient dues notamment au système Game Boost, un mode de compatibilité spécifique.\nSelon les experts de la chaîne Digital Foundry, cette promesse de 45% d’amélioration n’est pas tenue… Les fonctionnalités du système n’atteignent que 30 à 35% tout au plus pour les titres qui n’ont pas été “optimisés”. Cette limitation technique pourrait s’expliquer par la bande passante mémoire en décalage par rapport au contrôleur mémoire. L’augmentation de la bande passante mémoire et du contrôleur mémoire permet au GPU de mieux gérer le cache et donc les résolutions élevées. Cela signifie que la PS5 Pro serait capable de mieux gérer une résolution de 1080p à 120 FPS qu’une 4K à 60 FPS.\nIl semblerait, par contre, que les jeux optimisés soient mieux pris en charge en termes de performances techniques et visuelles.",

    "text": "Florida suing Department of Justice, alleging they prevented the state from investigation Trump assassination attempt Lawyers in Moody’s office filed the lawsuit Wednesday in federal court in Fort Pierce against U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (WCTV) - Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody has filed a lawsuit alleging that the U.S. Department of Justice is improperly preventing the state from investigating an alleged assassination attempt last month against former President Donald Trump. Lawyers in Moody’s office filed the lawsuit Wednesday in federal court in Fort Pierce against U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland. The lawsuit alleges that the FBI, which is part of the Department of Justice, has blocked state authorities from investigating whether accused gunman Ryan Routh committed violations of state law. More Florida politics: Routh, 58, was spotted by a U.S. Secret Service agent hiding with a rifle in shrubbery along Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, ahead of where the former president — and current Republican presidential nominee — was playing golf. A Secret Service agent fired at Routh, who fled and was captured after driving away. Federal officials have filed charges against Routh, but Moody contends that a state probe could lead to additional charges, potentially including attempted murder. “Every day that Florida is prevented from investigating, the state’s case becomes harder to prove at trial,” the lawsuit said. “By contrast, the federal government suffers no injury from Florida investigating state law crimes, as the state has no intention of interfering with or obstructing the federal investigation.” To stay up to date on all the latest news as it develops, follow WCTV on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/WCTV.tv/) and [X](https://twitter.com/WCTV) ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/WCTV)).

    "text": "Estimated read time: 4-5 minutes [CoPilot Executive Function Coaching](https://www.copilotef.com/). Helping kids who struggle with school and other responsibilities can be challenging, especially if you don't know where to turn for help. Unfortunately, many parents face exactly that scenario, and outcomes can be anything but hopeful. According to [Learning Disabilities Association of Utah](https://www.ldau.org/facts), only about 50% of students with specific learning disabilities receive special education services — and those who do receive them may not be getting exactly what they need either. That's why parents like Kathy, a Utah mother, fought to find the key to helping her children navigate the challenges of executive function (EF) deficits and learning difficulties. Kathy and her husband, like many parents, believed the straightforward idea that attentiveness plus effort equals academic success. But when two of their sons encountered significant hurdles in school, they were forced to reassess that belief. Being scattered and unfocused is a sign — but of what? Unlike their oldest daughter, who navigated academic responsibilities with ease, Kathy's middle boys faced an uphill battle from an early age. This struggle intensified as they transitioned into junior high. The onset of more classes, assignments and deadlines revealed a deeper issue than what had initially appeared as typical childhood forgetfulness or disorganization. Kathy's sons struggled with cluttered rooms, missed deadlines and a growing aversion to school — a stark departure from the academic engagement they once showed. \"They seemed to have no concept of time,\" Kathy recounted, highlighting a core symptom of EF deficits. The situation escalated as the boys developed negative attitudes toward school, expecting failure not only in their academic pursuits but in life itself. With this perspective came an onslaught of anxiety and depression, leading to substance experimentation as a misguided form of relief. Kathy soon realized traditional approaches were not working. A targeted treatment approach When the boys were diagnosed with ADHD alongside poor executive function skills — including slow processing speed and weak working memory — Kathy had the clarity she needed to seek targeted help. That's when she discovered [CoPilot Executive Function Coaching](https://www.copilotef.com/) developed by mental health clinician Anthony Mosier, LMFT. CoPilot's approach focuses on how to learn rather than subject matter tutoring. The goal is to cultivate crucial EF skills such as organization, time management and task initiation. Through dedicated coaching sessions, Kathy's sons began to internalize and apply strategies that addressed their specific challenges. The program's impact was profound and lasting, with significant improvements in academic performance and self-esteem. \"I'll never forget the first time my son got an A on an assignment,\" Kathy shared, a moment that challenged and changed their self-perceptions. An insightful approach Mosier's insights into the widespread impact of EF deficits on academic success and mental health derived from his work as a clinical therapist. \"The bulk of the repair work I was doing in the therapy office stemmed from damage in the classroom,\" Mosier noted, reflecting on his early career experiences. His determination to develop a program like CoPilot was fueled by the realization that many therapists, teachers, and parents are unaware of how to teach or even recognize EF skills. CoPilot stands out not only for its innovative approach to EF skill development but also for its commitment to accessibility and evidence-based results. The program demonstrates that skills, once gained, build momentum and lead to sustained improvements. In one study, students demonstrated significant growth in all seven EF skills, with outcomes continuing to improve one year post-coaching. Empowering families Kathy's journey from despair to empowerment serves as a powerful narrative for the importance of recognizing and addressing EF deficits. Her story sheds light on a critical aspect of education that goes beyond traditional subjects, focusing on the foundational skills necessary for academic and life success. As Kathy reflects on her family's journey, her story is one of both regret and gratitude — regret for the pressure and misunderstanding that initially marked their approach, and profound gratitude for the transformative impact of CoPilot Executive Function Coaching. \"My boys are doing well. They both graduated from high school and are thriving in college,\" Kathy shared. Her story underscores the urgency of integrating EF skill development into educational settings and the broader conversation about mental health and academic success. It highlights the need for increased awareness and resources to support students struggling with EF deficits, ensuring that families like Kathy's have the tools and understanding necessary to navigate these challenges. Unfortunately, this experience is not unique to Kathy's family but is a shared experience among many.

    "title": "Durísima denuncia. Castillo: \"Los fondos reservados son para actividades ilegales de los gobiernos\"",
    "text": "El diputado nacional del PTS en el Frente de Izquierda Unidad intervino en la Comisión Bicameral Permanente del Congreso Nacional e hizo una fuerte intervención. Mirá el video completo. \"Sí, señor presidente, en primer lugar, lo que se ha ampliado son fondos reservados. Lo que estamos discutiendo aquí, para ir al contenido, es que hay dos DNU, tres en realidad, pero dos son los centrales: uno que crea una nueva Central de Inteligencia, reemplazando la anterior, y otro que le atribuye 100.000 millones de pesos en fondos reservados a un gobierno que dice que no hay plata para los docentes, no hay plata para la asistencia social, no hay plata para obra pública, no hay plata para nada, pero sí hay para fondos reservados. ¿Y para qué se utilizan los fondos reservados? Históricamente, se han usado para pagar sobresueldos a jueces. Recordemos el famoso caso del juez que se estaba divorciando, y su esposa dijo que había que compartir los fondos porque recibía un sobre en la década de los 90 (información pública). También se utilizan para pagarle a periodistas sobornados. Estos fondos se destinan a otro tipo de operaciones, es decir, a actividades ilegales por parte de un gobierno determinado. La primera discusión que deberíamos tener es por qué tiene que haber fondos reservados y no fondos auditables. Esto abre un debate muy fuerte sobre estas dos cuestiones: un gobierno que dice que no hay plata para nada, pero para eventuales sobornos y la compra de medios de comunicación, sí la hay. Diversos artículos han aparecido en los diarios sobre la posible utilización de estos fondos para comprar medios de comunicación. Sin embargo, la historia nos ha enseñado que no se puede controlar todo con los servicios de inteligencia. Un ejemplo claro es la Stasi, que controlaba todo, incluso a nivel familiar, y aún así no pudo evitar el derrumbe de un estado. La idea de que con fondos reservados se puede comprar un medio de comunicación y controlarlo todo es una fantasía. Creo que esto no servirá y que esos recursos, provenientes de los contribuyentes, deberían destinarse a mejorar los salarios, las jubilaciones, la infraestructura, un plan de vivienda, o la ayuda social en un país que acaba de alcanzar el 55% de pobreza. Es una dilapidación de fondos, más allá de las ilegalidades asociadas a ello. Por lo tanto, me parece inaceptable que aquellos que dicen tener tanto cuidado presupuestario, que no quieren votar ni un pequeño aumento a las jubilaciones, y que se esmeran en encontrar fórmulas para no aumentar las jubilaciones, insisto, han desfinanciado brutalmente las universidades públicas. Las clases en muchas universidades comienzan la semana que viene con tres días de paro porque los salarios de la docencia universitaria han caído a la mitad durante estos siete meses y pico del año, casi ocho meses ya. Son estos mismos los que quieren otorgar 100.000 millones de pesos, no en general, sino en gastos reservados, es decir, para operaciones políticas. Creo que esto amerita el rechazo de ambos DNU. Y con un agravante: todos hemos leído que hay designaciones en el sistema de inteligencia, en el nuevo, creado por DNU, de personalidades vinculadas a la SIDE de los 90. Sabemos lo que hizo la SIDE de los 90, y no es especulación. Sabemos lo que hizo, el encubrimiento del atentado de la AMIA, entre otras cosas, y el encubrimiento del contrabando de armas, dos casos muy graves. Sabemos de operetas de todo tipo, y ahora no solo se recupera el nombre, sino que parte del personal político, involucrado en muchas causas muy complicadas, vuelve al ruedo. Además, hay una cuestión de forma: crear o modificar sustantivamente una agencia de inteligencia por DNU es un despropósito. Esto debería presentarse obviamente como una ley. Atribuir 100.000 millones de pesos en gasto reservado es un despropósito, se mire como se mire. Por eso, anticipamos el rechazo de todo el Frente de Izquierda cuando esto sea tratado en el recinto. Hemos presentado proyectos al respecto, firmados por la totalidad de los diputados, presentados por la diputada que me acompaña acá, Vanina Biasi, y con la firma de todos los cinco diputados del Frente de Izquierda. Esperamos que hoy se pueda incorporar al temario del debate estos DNU y obtener un dictamen negativo para llevarlo lo antes posible a las cámaras y evitar este nuevo despropósito del gobierno. Nada más. Muchas gracias\".",

    "text": "A TIM Brasil anunciou um novo programa de benefícios para os clientes de planos pós-pago e controle da operadora. Chamado de TIM Mais , a iniciativa da empresa é focada em experiências para os usuários.\nPela primeira vez, o programa inclui também o segmento controle, que reúne os planos pós-pagos de entrada. \"Lançamos, no ano passado, um novo portfólio no TIM Controle, que fica ainda mais robusto com a chegada do TIM Mais\", comentou o CMO da TIM, Paulo Esperandio.\nNo novo programa, a marca está apostando em sorteios de viagens, desconto em serviços e nos cinemas da rede Kinoplex, gift cards mensais e também na oportunidade de clientes participarem dos eventos musicais promovidos pela companhia. Para funcionar, o projeto conta com um espaço dedicado dentro do aplicativo Meu TIM.\nÀ imprensa, a operadora afirmou que já vem testando nos últimos meses um piloto dos benefícios . \"Os clientes selecionados já puderam curtir grandes eventos como o Rock in Rio e o Festival de Verão Salvador, com direito a brindes e acesso ao espaço da operadora nos festivais, aproveitando com ainda mais conforto\", afirmou a tele.\nPara este Carnaval, por exemplo, a operadora quer levar alguns clientes para cima do trio elétrico da cantora Ivete Sangalo na cidade de Salvador.\n\"Com o TIM Mais, reafirmamos nosso compromisso em oferecer experiências verdadeiramente inesquecíveis. Queremos transformar o modo como interagimos e recompensamos nossos clientes, criando um novo padrão de excelência e cuidado no setor de telecomunicações\", afirmou Esperandio.\nFidelização A oferta de \"experiências\" por parte da TIM é mais uma das estratégias da operadora para atrair clientes para planos pós-pago e controle, já que essas pessoas entregam um ticket médio por usuário superior ao obtido pelos consumidores de chips pré-pagos.\nEntre as três grandes companhias de telefonia móvel no Brasil, a TIM ainda é a única cujo portfólio é formado por mais clientes pré-pago do que pós-pago. De acordo com a Anatel, dos 51,6 milhões de acessos celulares da empresa em dezembro de 2024, 57% são de clientes no pré.",
