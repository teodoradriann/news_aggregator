    "text": "HONOLULU (Island News) -- Hawaii is paying the Los Angeles Clippers $750,000 as part of a partnership that would bring the basketball team to the Islands for training camp and a preseason game in Honolulu against the Golden State Warriors in October. Public records show that the Hawaii Tourism Authority (HTA) will receive several marketing opportunities both during the Clippers time in Hawaii, as well as in Los Angeles, most notably being given the designation of Official Partner of the L.A. Clippers. The contract also says the Clippers are scheduled to do several community events in Hawaii during their training camp, which includes youth basketball clinics, school computer lab renovations and VIP meet and greets with players or staff. HTA says it has a pre-existing relationship with the Clippers dating back to the 2019 training camp. Due to NBA geographic market restrictions, only the Clippers and L.A. Lakers could host training camps in Hawaii. The Lakers said they were not available to play preseason games in Hawaii this year. The Clippers are scheduled to hold training camp in Honolulu from Oct. 1-5, with a game scheduled against the Warriors, who are also scheduled to be practicing the same week but at BYU-Hawaii on Oahu’s North Shore.",

    "title": "Malaysia rescues hundreds of tortoises from 'Ninja Turtle Gang' - VnExpress International",
    "text": "Abdul Kadir Abu Hashim, wildlife and national parks department director-general, said 400 tortoises worth RM3.8 million (US$805,084) bound for the lucrative exotic pet trade were seized during an operation by the police and wildlife officials on Saturday. Across Asia, many believe that tortoises bring good luck and prosperity. \"This is the biggest ever seizure in the past 10 years,\" Abdul Kadir told AFP, adding that the reptiles were to be sold on to Thailand and Indonesia after local demand was met. He said the tortoises were believed to have been smuggled from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal. The joint operation, codenamed \"United National Resource\", crippled the tortoise smuggling ring known as the \"Ninja Turtle Gang\", he said. The operation involved a car chase in which the driver of a vehicle thought to be used in the smuggling was arrested. The driver subsequently led the enforcement officers to a location where rare three-keeled land turtles and Indian star tortoises were being kept. Commercial trade in the Indian star tortoise was banned in 2019. \"The strategic location of Malaysia in Southeast Asia makes the country a hub for the smuggling of these exotic species,\" Abdul Kadir said. The tortoises are illegally brought into Malaysia by road or in suitcases by smugglers aboard commercial flights, he said. Traffic, a wildlife NGO, has previously said that Southeast Asian countries \"function as source, consumer and as entrepots for wildlife originating from within the region as well as the rest of the world.\"",

    "text": "Harto de la abismal diferencia entre los salarios que cobran los dirigentes políticos y las jubilaciones de miseria que cobran las personas de la tercera edad en la Argentina, un jubilado se plantó ante la dirigencia de su localidad y estalló de furia contra ellos, reclamo que ya se volvió viral en las redes sociales.\nHARTO\nViral: Un jubilado se plantó ante los políticos y les reclamó por las jubilaciones de miseria\nUn reclamo de un jubilado a dirigentes políticos de Bahía Blanca se volvió viral en redes sociales. El hombre les reclamó una mejor jubilación.\nEl viral momento ocurrió en la localidad e Bahía Blanca, en la provincia de Buenos Aires, donde un hombre decidió presentarse en el Concejo Deliberante de esa localidad para despacharse contra los concejales.\nEl hombre decidió aprovechar la celebración de una sesión ordinaria para apersonarse en el sitio y disparar contra los dirigentes políticos, dejándoles claro que ellos gozan de salarios privilegiados, mientras que los jubilados \"se cagan de hambre\".\nSegún describen medios locales, el ingreso en mano de cada concejal, de base, rondaba los 800 mil pesos (en el 2023), aunque dependiendo de la antigüedad en la función pública y otras variables puede estar por encima de ese nivel.\nEl viral descargo del jubilado\nEn ese contexto, este jueves 24/10 se viralizó un video del jubilado enojado y en contra de los concejales de Bahía Blanca. El manifestante en cuestión es Luciano Martos, referente de los \"canillitas\" de la localidad y quien viene exponiendo en distintos ámbitos la compleja situación que atraviesan los jubilados.\nFue en el inicio de la sesión ordinaria, cuando el jubilado se paró frente a las y los ediles y les recriminó por sus dietas y por las horas que trabajan en el deliberativo.\n“Pónganse las pilas”, les exigió el hombre, y les pidió que destinen parte de sus ingresos a aquellos jubilados y jubiladas que no llegan a fin de mes.\nEn medio de su descargo, los concejales le plantearon que no era el momento ni la forma de exponer el pedido, situación que lo enojó más y aseguró que en distintas ocasiones se presentó en el edificio de Sarmiento 12, en Bahía Blanca y siempre obtuvo la misma respuesta: “no es el momento”.\n\"Desde el año 2018 vengo con este reclamo y nunca tratan este tema. A ustedes ahora le viene un aumento de 170 mil pesos a cada uno... Pónganse las pilas... ustedes no trabajan más de siete horas por día. Tomen actitudes contra mí, no tengo problema, yo soy un ciudadano común\", se despachó el jubilado.\nY siguió: \"Hay gente que no viene acá a reclamar porque les tienen miedo, por eso vengo acá. Yo lo digo porque hay voces acá que les da vergüenza y miedo, y mucho más decir que cobran 200 mil más un bono\". Además, el jubilado aseguró que los concejales cobran más de 3 millones por mes.\nParadójicamente, y tras el veto a los jubilados que decretó el Presidente, uno de los que compartió el video fue la cuenta libertaria ligada directamente con Javier Milei y la Casa Rosada.",

The Centre will fund activities and provide services to: - help commercialise locally manufactured renewable energy technologies and ideas; - encourage connections between critical minerals producers and renewable technology manufacturers; - include a First Nations Advisor to build First Nations business management capabilities in renewable technologies. The centre delivers on our election commitment under the Australia Made Battery Plan, to provide advanced technology and skills development to businesses looking to locally manufacture renewable technologies. It also builds on the Government's suite of support for the renewable technology industry, including Powering Australia, Rewiring the Nation and a Future Made in Australia. The centre also aligns with the National Reconstruction Fund's priority area of renewables, value adding in resources and low-emissions technologies. Quotes attributable to the Hon Ed Husic, Minister for Industry and Science: \"Batteries, renewables and other low-emissions technologies offer huge opportunities for Australian industry to create jobs and the sovereign capabilities critical to our economic success. \"This $14 million investment is targeted support to grow Aussie know-how in these emerging areas. \"It aligns with what we're doing with our $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund, which has renewable and low-emissions technologies as one of its priority investment areas, once again demonstrating how Government linking up policies can better support Australian industry.\" [here](/clean-energy-powered-by-aussie-ingenuity-1175341/).",

    "text": "Video | Cristiano Ronaldo, primer futbolista en la historia en marcar 900 goles: así fue El gol, un remate con el pie derecho desde el corazón del área tras asistencia de Nuno Mendes, supone un hito más en la carrera de récord del jugador. El delantero portugués [Cristiano Ronaldo](https://www.wradio.com.co/tag/cristiano_ronaldo/a/) alcanzó los 900 goles en su carrera este jueves, al marcar el segundo tanto de Portugal en el partido de la Liga de Naciones ante Croacia. El gol, un remate con el pie derecho desde el corazón del área tras asistencia de Nuno Mendes, supone un hito más en la carrera de récord del jugador. Le puede interesar El delantero suma 900 goles en 1238 partidos oficiales, con una media de casi 0,73 tantos por encuentro, que ha marcado con las camisetas de Sporting (5), del Manchester United (145), del Real Madrid (450), del Juventus (101) y del Al-Nassr (67). A su periplo en estos clubes se suman los 131 tantos que ha firmado con la selección de Portugal. La afición lusa recibió el gol de Cristiano con su ya famoso “Siuuu” y coreó el nombre del delantero de Madeira, que para celebrarlo se tiró al suelo en la línea de fondo con las manos en la cara y una sonrisa.",
