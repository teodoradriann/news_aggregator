    "text": "BUENOS AIRES: Argentine farmers made good progress sowing corn and soy crops following recent abundant rainfall, the Buenos Aires grains exchange said on Thursday, as industry groups prepare to fight government plans to hike export taxes on their produce. The South American nation is one of the world’s top exporters of corn, soybean oil and soy meal, but its last harvest was devastated by a historic drought. Faced with a severe economic crisis, Argentina’s new government is looking to the sector to boost its tax take. The grains exchange said in a weekly report that soybean planting is 78.6% complete after advancing 9.5 percentage points in seven days, while corn planting has also progressed well and is now 69.9% complete. Argentine farmers should plant some 17.3 million hectares of soybean and 7.1 million hectares of corn this season, according to the exchange’s estimates. Wheat farmers have meanwhile harvested some 70.9% of an estimated 14.7 million-metric-ton harvest, it added, noting it had not yet assessed the extent of damages from strong winds and hail that swept farmlands alongside the recent rains. The report comes a day after the government of President Javier Milei sent a package of economic reforms to Congress, including a proposal to hike export taxes on the country’s key grain products, sparking backlash from the sector. Argentina’s CAA agro-industrial council said it would alert lawmakers about this “erroneous decision,” arguing the measure goes against the new right-wing government’s pledges to boost employment, production and exports. “We will seek to have the duty hike corrected and eliminated,” the council said in a statement.

    "title": "Bayer Leverkusen humilla por 4-0 al Feyenoord de Santi Jiménez | ABC Noticias",
    "text": "Leverkusen. –El Bayer Leverkusen se impuso este jueves por 0-4 al Feyenoord con dos goles de Florian Wirtz, uno de Alejandro Grimaldo y otro en propia puerta del meta Simon Wellenreuther, en un partido que por momentos pareció mucho más parejo de loque indicó el resultado. El Leverkusen dejó el partido visto para sentencia antes del descanso con cuatro tantos marcados en la primera parte, que fueron el fruto de una eficacia implacable ante un esforzado Feyenoord que intentó controlar el partido en los primeros minutos y que poco a poco se fue apagando. Wirtz abrió el marcador en el minuto 5 con un remate desde la media luna a pase de Robert Andrich que le había robado una pelota a Zerrouki en medio campo. En el momento en que se produjo el gol de Wirtz, el Feyenoord parecía tener la iniciativa y la pelota circulaba más en la mitad contraria que en las cercanías de la portería de Simon Wellenreuther. El Leverkusen no volvió a rematar a puerta sino hasta el minuto 26 con un disparo de Victor Boniface desde fuera del área. En el área contraria hubo un gol anulado a Zerrouki en el minuto 9 por fuera de juego y un remate de In-Beom Hwang en el 15 desde buena posición, pero demasiado central. En el 29, Hwang volvió a rematar desde fuera del área y el balón pasó cerca del primer poste. El partido parece parejo, pero todo se rompería en los minutos siguientes. En el 31, llegó el segundo del Leverkusen marcado por Grimaldo en una jugada que inició Wirtz cerca de la raya central. Wirtz jugó con Boniface, este abrió desde la media luna para Jeremy Frimpong que centró para que Grimaldo definiera desde corta distancia. El Feyenoord intentó seguir atacando, pero se encontró con un contragolpe perfecto del Leverkusen que trajo gol que ya prácticamente sentenciaba el partido. Terrier, desde la propia mitad, le metió un pase de profundidad a Frimpong y este, ya cerca del área, centro al segundo poste donde Wirtz definió de primera. El cuarto gol, poco antes del descanso, se produjo cuando Tapsoba cabeceó hacia el centro una falta lanzada por Grimaldo y Wellenreuther desvió la pelota hacia su propia portería. En el segundo tiempo pasó muy poco. El Leverkusen bajó el ritmo y dejó jugar al Feyenoord que tuvo la pelota y tuvo algunas aproximaciones al área y una buena ocasión en un remate de Timberg en el 55. El 0-4 final contrasta con el hecho de que el Feyenoord más posesión y más remates a puerta. Si se mira la hoja de estadísticas se puede pensar que se trató de un partido igualado y tal vez lo hubiera sido no haber sido por la eficiencia implacable del Leverkusen.",

    "text": "Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has delayed the launch of its R2 model due to technical issues with Huawei’s Ascend chips.\nAuthorities had encouraged DeepSeek to use Huawei processors instead of Nvidia’s after releasing its R1 model in January 2025.\nPersistent problems during R2 training on Ascend chips forced the company to switch to Nvidia for training while keeping Huawei hardware for inference.\nThis setback reportedly pushed back the R2 launch from May 2025, allowing competitors to advance.\nIndustry insiders say Chinese-made chips still lag behind Nvidia’s in stability, connectivity, and software.\nDespite Huawei sending engineers to assist, DeepSeek could not complete a successful R2 training run on the Ascend chip.\nThe company is still working to make the model compatible with Huawei’s hardware for inference.\n🔗 Source: Reuters\n🧠 Food for thought 1️⃣ Hardware bottlenecks persist despite aggressive policy interventions DeepSeek’s training difficulties illustrate a broader challenge facing China’s semiconductor ecosystem despite years of government investment and policy pressure.\nThe numbers reveal the scale of the problem: in 2024, Chinese firms purchased approximately 1 million Nvidia H20 chips compared to only 450,000 Huawei Ascend 910B chips, showing market preference despite official encouragement to buy domestic alternatives 1 .\nThis preference stems from measurable performance gaps, as Huawei’s chips lag behind Nvidia’s in critical metrics, including memory bandwidth and processing capabilities 1 .\nThe production capacity constraints compound these quality issues, with Huawei expected to produce only 200,000 AI chips in 2025 2 .\nChinese firms are estimated to be approximately two years behind in chip design and five generations behind in semiconductor manufacturing equipment 3 .\nThese technical realities explain why DeepSeek, despite having Huawei engineers on-site for support, ultimately couldn’t complete successful training runs on Ascend processors and had to revert to Nvidia chips for training while using Huawei only for the less demanding inference tasks.\n2️⃣ Model performance improvements decouple from hardware limitations Despite persistent chip constraints, Chinese AI models have narrowed the performance gap with US counterparts through innovative approaches that maximize limited computing resources.\nThe performance gap between US and Chinese AI models shrunk from 103 points in January 2024 to just 23 points by February 2025 4 .\nThis convergence occurred even as China maintained significantly lower total compute capacity—the US holds a tenfold advantage in overall computing power 5 .\nDeepSeek’s R1 model exemplifies this efficiency-focused approach, achieving competitive performance while being developed with significantly lower costs compared to US models 6 .\nThis suggests that raw computing power, while important for training, may not be the primary determinant of final model quality when combined with algorithmic innovations and more efficient training methodologies.\nThis efficiency advantage could prove strategically important as it allows Chinese companies to remain competitive in AI capabilities even while operating under continued hardware constraints.",

Pour obtenir une copie de l'avis de rachat envoyé aux détenteurs des bons de souscription et un prospectus relatif aux actions ordinaires pouvant être émises lors de l'exercice des bons de souscription, veuillez envoyer une demande par e-mail à IR@grindr.com ou visiter notre site web à https://investors.grindr.com/overview/default.aspx .\nPas d'offre ni de sollicitation\nCe communiqué de presse ne constitue pas une offre de vente ou une sollicitation d'une offre d'achat de titres de Grindr, et il n'y aura aucune vente de ces titres dans aucun État ou autre juridiction où une telle offre, sollicitation ou vente serait illégale.\nPerspectives financières mises à jour\nGrindr a également annoncé aujourd'hui qu'elle s'attend à ce que la croissance des revenus pour l'année complète 2024 dépasse les perspectives précédemment fournies d'au moins 29% de croissance des revenus d'une année sur l'autre. Grindr prévoit maintenant que les revenus pour l'année complète 2024 se situeront entre 343 et 345 millions de dollars, représentant une croissance des revenus de 32%-33% d'une année sur l'autre. Grindr a également annoncé aujourd'hui qu'elle réaffirme ses perspectives précédemment fournies pour une marge d'EBITDA ajusté de 42% ou plus pour l'année complète 2024.\nL'augmentation de la croissance des revenus par rapport aux perspectives financières a été motivée par une combinaison de surperformance dans l'activité de vente directe de publicités de Grindr, qui a largement dépassé les attentes en décembre 2024, et une force continue du côté des revenus directs (abonnements et compléments). Les résultats financiers pour le quatrième trimestre et l'année complète 2024 devraient être communiqués en mars 2025.\nDéclarations prospectives\nCe communiqué de presse contient des déclarations qui peuvent constituer des déclarations prospectives au sens des lois fédérales sur les valeurs mobilières et au sens des dispositions de \"safe harbor\" du United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act de 1995. Dans certains cas, vous pouvez identifier ces déclarations prospectives par l'utilisation de termes tels que \"anticipe\", \"approximativement\", \"croit\", \"continue\", \"pourrait\", \"estime\", \"s'attend\", \"objectif\", \"a l'intention\", \"peut\", \"perspectives\", \"planifie\", \"potentiel\", \"prédit\", \"projets\", \"cherche\", \"devrait\", \"à venir\", \"va\" ou la version négative de ces mots ou d'autres termes ou phrases comparables. Ces déclarations prospectives incluent, entre autres, des déclarations concernant la croissance des revenus attendue par la Société et la marge d'EBITDA ajusté pour l'année complète 2024, la radiation des bons de souscription le jour de bourse précédant la Date de rachat, et la communication prévue des résultats financiers pour le quatrième trimestre et l'année complète 2024 en mars 2025. Les déclarations prospectives sont des prédictions, des projections et d'autres déclarations sur des événements futurs qui sont basées sur les attentes et hypothèses actuelles et, par conséquent, ne sont pas des garanties de performances futures et sont soumises à des risques et incertitudes qui peuvent entraîner des résultats réels différant matériellement des attentes discutées dans les déclarations prospectives. De nombreux facteurs pourraient faire en sorte que les événements futurs réels diffèrent matériellement des déclarations prospectives contenues dans ce communiqué de presse, y compris ceux discutés dans la section intitulée \"Facteurs de risque\" dans les rapports annuels sur le formulaire 10-K et les rapports trimestriels sur le formulaire 10-Q que nous déposons auprès de la Securities and Exchange Commission de temps à autre. Toute déclaration prospective ne parle qu'à la date à laquelle elle est faite, et vous ne devriez pas accorder une confiance excessive aux déclarations prospectives. Sauf dans la mesure requise par la loi applicable, nous n'avons aucune obligation (et déclinons expressément toute obligation) de mettre à jour ou de réviser nos déclarations prospectives, que ce soit à la suite de nouvelles informations, d'événements futurs ou autrement.\nMesures financières non conformes aux PCGR\nNous utilisons l'EBITDA ajusté et la marge d'EBITDA ajusté, qui sont des mesures non conformes aux PCGR, pour comprendre et évaluer notre performance opérationnelle de base. Ces mesures financières non conformes aux PCGR, qui peuvent différer des mesures similaires utilisées par d'autres sociétés, sont présentées pour améliorer la compréhension globale des investisseurs de notre performance financière et ne doivent pas être considérées comme un substitut ou supérieures aux informations financières préparées et présentées conformément aux PCGR.\nL'EBITDA ajusté ajuste l'impact des éléments que nous ne considérons pas comme indicatifs de la performance opérationnelle de notre activité. Nous définissons l'EBITDA ajusté comme le bénéfice net (perte) excluant la provision (avantage) d'impôt sur le revenu ; les charges d'intérêts, nettes ; l'amortissement ; les charges de rémunération à base d'actions ; les coûts liés aux transactions ; le gain (perte) de la juste valeur du passif lié aux bons de souscription ; et les dépenses de licenciement, les coûts liés aux litiges et d'autres éléments, dans chaque cas qui ne sont pas liés à nos activités opérationnelles de base en cours. La marge d'EBITDA ajusté est calculée en divisant l'EBITDA ajusté d'une période par les revenus de la même période. Nous excluons les éléments ci-dessus car certains sont de nature non monétaire et d'autres peuvent ne pas être représentatifs des résultats d'exploitation normaux. Bien que nous croyions que l'EBITDA ajusté et la marge d'EBITDA ajusté sont utiles pour évaluer notre activité, ces informations doivent être considérées comme supplémentaires par nature et ne sont pas destinées à remplacer les informations financières connexes préparées et présentées conformément aux PCGR.\nÀ l'heure actuelle, nous ne sommes pas en mesure d'estimer notre bénéfice net (perte) attendu ou notre marge de bénéfice net (perte) pour l'année complète terminée le 31 décembre 2024, ni de rapprocher les orientations fournies pour la marge d'EBITDA ajusté à la marge de bénéfice net (perte) pour l'année complète 2024 sans efforts déraisonnables en raison de la variabilité et de la complexité des charges exclues de l'EBITDA ajusté. En conséquence, nous nous appuyons sur l'exception prospective prévue par l'article 10(e)(1)(i)(B) du Règlement S-K pour exclure ces rapprochements. La variabilité des charges, y compris la rémunération à base d'actions et la provision (avantage) d'impôt sur le revenu, pourrait avoir un impact significatif et potentiellement imprévisible sur nos résultats financiers conformes aux PCGR.\nMarques déposées\nCe communiqué de presse peut contenir des marques déposées de Grindr.

    "title": "Tory MP suggests ‘crap parents’ behind most of town’s struggling children | Gazette",
    "text": "A Conservative MP has been criticised for suggesting most children who struggle in an English town are the “products of crap parents”. James Daly was accused by his Labour rival of “insulting the parenting skills of people in Bury” after the remark was made in a newspaper piece analysing election prospects for the Greater Manchester town. Mr Daly, speaking to the i newspaper, stressed the importance of “stability” offered by the family unit as he outlined what the New Conservatives group of MPs stands for. The Bury North MP said: “I think New Conservatives represent very much working-class conservatism. “We’re not a strange right-wing sect. It’s just people who want to give people the best chance to succeed and thrive in life. “When you think about the family, it’s about stability. “Most of the kids who struggle in Bury are the products of crap parents and so what do we do to try to address that issue? “On the left it would just be we’ll throw money at this and hope something sticks, somebody like me thinks about this more fundamentally.” James Frith, Labour’s prospective parliamentary candidate for Bury North, said: “It is revealing to see how little James Daly thinks of his own constituents. “Rather than insulting the parenting skills of people in Bury, he should look closer to home. “Over the last 13 years the Conservatives have failed to grow our economy, protect our public services or provide opportunities for young people in Bury and across the UK.” Comments: Our rules We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Si la grisaille s'est invitée depuis plusieurs jours sur le territoire, elle compte bien prolonger sa venue ce week-end et même en début de semaine prochaine.\nSi ce matin les températures étaient négatives, elles devraient remonter à partir de ce week-end à Dijon et en Côte-d'Or. En effet, le froid, installé depuis quelques jours sur tout le territoire, aura tendance à s'effacer à partir de samedi matin. Une perturbation ondulera toute la journée, apportant un ciel gris et maussade accompagné de quelques gouttes de pluie. Le thermomètre affichera des valeurs de saison, entre 4 et 5 degrés dans la journée.\nScénario identique pour dimanche. Le soleil ne fera toujours pas son apparition et sera remplacé par un ciel très gris. Du brouillard sera potentiellement visible localement. À basse altitude, la neige pourrait se mêler à la pluie. Côté températures, il fera 2 degrés le matin et 5 degrés l'après-midi.\nToujours de la grisaille avec un redoux\nPour la semaine prochaine, la grisaille sera toujours présente mais cette fois, elle sera accompagnée par un un léger redoux.

    "text": "David Pérez, de solo 44 años, vive la Semana Santa en el lugar como el momento “más importante del año”29 marzo, 2024 07:00 Noticias relacionadas Ampudia es una bella localidad que se ubica al sur de la provincia de Palencia, en la parte occidental provincial y a unos 26 kilómetros de la capital si nos acercamos por la carretera P-901. Cuenta con una población, según los datos del Instituto Nacional de Estadística, de unos 600 habitantes. En el lugar es típico el Paloteo, una antigua y vistosa danza tradicional que se remonta a tiempos ancestrales. De hecho, en el mes de agosto también se organiza el Festival de Paloteo y Danza, con el fin de que esta centenaria tradición tenga continuidad. A lo largo del año son muchas las actividades que la villa mantiene con una programación que resulta intensa y a destacar en lo festivo y lo cultural. Reina la Feria de San Miguel Arcángel que tiene lugar en el mes de septiembre en un evento que desarrolla una amplia programación y que revive el ambiente y aspecto más medieval con decenas de forasteros y de vecinos abarrotando las calles de la localidad. Una cita enmarcada en el calendario es también la Semana Santa. Ampudia está desarrollando estos días de pasión con procesiones, silencio y devoción. Las vías de la localidad palentina se llenan de pasos, tallas y de curiosos que se unen a esta tradición. Un valedor muy importante para que estos días sean únicos en el pueblo es el cura del mismo. David Pérez Gutiérrez habla con EL ESPAÑOL de Castilla y León de la Semana Santa de Ampudia y, también, de su vida. Pasó incluso por Roma. Un apasionado de Jesucristo “Soy un sacerdote católico nacido en Palencia. Me defino como un apasionado de Jesucristo, a quién he intentado llevar a las comunidades parroquiales que se me han encomendado, así como otras responsabilidades diocesanas”, asegura, en declaraciones a este periódico. A sus 44 años suma 18 como cura. Es un apasionado de la lectura, de la historia y del arte. Nació en Palencia, en la capital. Su infancia fue “normal”. “En lo que me diferencio es en la impronta que en mí dejaron mis años como monaguillo en la Catedral de Palencia. Entré con nueve años y, de ahí, pasé al Seminario Mayor”, nos cuenta. “Llego a Ampudia, para ser párroco, en el año 2015. Fue a mi vuelta de Roma, donde amplié estudios en la Pontificia Universidad Gregoriana de Roma. El obispo me nombró párroco de Ampudia por seis años, pero siempre con disponibilidad para lo que se nos requiera”, añade David. Es del grupo de sacerdotes más jóvenes de la Diócesis, pero le resta importancia a ese hecho. Para él, vivir en la localidad palentina es sinónimo de “mucha tranquilidad” pero, añade, que el trabajo pastoral hace que el día a día “sea un poco frenético”. Sin embargo, afirma “vivir todo con paz” porque para eso le ha llamado el Señor, para “entregar la vida por los demás”. Implicado con la Semana Santa de Ampudia “La Semana Santa es la más importante del año para los cristianos. Tiene dos dimensiones: la cultural y la expresión pública de la fe en las calles con las procesiones. Desde los tres años soy cofrade de una de las cofradías más antiguas de Palencia: la Real Cofradía del Santo Sepulcro, de la que soy abad también. Esto influye mucho en que me implique más en la Semana Santa”, explica nuestro entrevistado. Él, junto a un gran número de personas del pueblo, se esmera por continuar haciendo de la de Ampudia, una Semana Santa referente para la provincia palentina. Él, junto a la Cofradía Penitencial del Cristo de la Buena Muerte y del Santo Sepulcro, la Cofradía del Santísimo, el coro parroquial y el propio Ayuntamiento de Ampudia, en definitiva, todo el pueblo, se ha volcado para que esta semana de pasión esté siendo todo un éxito. “La Semana Santa, para mí, son los días centrales de la vida de la comunidad parroquial. Jornadas de acompañar a Cristo en los momentos de pasión, muerte y resurrección. Se vive intensamente y son días en los que Ampudia se transforma y se une al silencio, la liturgia y el arte. El momento clave lo estamos viviendo ahora que es el Triduo Pascual, desde la tarde del Jueves Santo hasta el Domingo de Resurrección”, añade el párroco. La Semana Santa de Ampudia es fiel a su pasado, con un presente vivo y un futuro prometedor como se está viendo estos días. De este mantenimiento en el tiempo tiene mucha culpa todo el que se implica en ello. Uno de los artífices de esto es David.",
