    "text": "THE 10-year-old great-great-grand-daughter of a Darlington man who was killed 80 years ago in the Battle of Greece has been presented with his war medal by the Greek government to recognise his sacrifice.\nGunner George Welsh, 32, drowned along with 1,000 others in the Myrtoan Sea on April 27, 1941, when a convoy carrying rescued Allied troops came under attack from German dive bombers.\nGunner George Welsh\nHis death left his wife, Margaret, with three boys under the age of seven to bring up in King Street, in the town centre, and because his body was never recovered, he was listed as “missing” and so she got none of the financial assistance given to widows whose husbands were officially “dead”.\n“They had to live on church and Salvation Army hand-outs, and Margaret had to do multiple jobs just to get by,” says his great-grand-daughter, Tracy Stephenson. “The two surviving lads, although they are well into their eighties, still carry these scars today from their childhood.”\nREAD MORE: THE COUNTY DURHAM DEPARTMENT STORE THAT WAS TOP DOGGARTS IN ITS DAY\nLayla, 10, is presented with her great-great-grandfather's campaign medal\nGunner George was born in Valley Street in 1908 to Annie Welsh and her partner, George Saint. When Annie died young, Gunner George and his brother, Robert, were brought up by “Granny Saint”, who ran the family grocery stall in the covered market. Robert went on to run the stall, but George joined the army in 1926 and by 1939, he was in the 106 (Lancashire Hussars) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment which was sent to northern Africa.\nGunner George's brother, Robert, and his wife, Annie, at the family stall in Darlington covered market\nOn April 6, 1941, the Germans and Italians invaded Greece, and pushed the 60,000 Allied soldiers – British, Australians, New Zealanders and Greek defenders – southwards. The British launched Operation Demon to rescue them, sending all available hands from north Africa to help.\nHMS Wryneck, probably in Egypt in 1940\nGeorge was attached to HMS Wryneck, an old warship completed on the Tyne on the last day of the First World War, as a rear gunner – the RAF had lost control of the skies so it was inevitable that the ships would come under attack from the Luftwaffe and his anti-aircraft skills would be vital.\nOn April 25, 1941, Wryneck reached Piraeus, the port of Athens, and rescued 647 Aussie soldiers who hadn’t eaten for three weeks. Wryneck sailed them 250 miles south to the safety of Port Souda on the island of Crete, coming under almost constant attack from the skies – Wryneck’s guns managed to bring down one enemy aircraft.\nIt was a quick turnaround, because another 3,000 Allied soldiers had reached Nauplia on the Greek mainland and were also in need of rescue.\nThe medals waiting to be handed to the families of me who served in Greece during the Second World War\nWryneck was part of a convoy of a dozen ships, led by the cruiser HMS Calcutta, which went to their aid. As they neared Nauplia, a German air raid destroyed the convoy’s one landing craft so the soldiers had to be transferred from the land to the ships by small boat. It was very time-consuming, and at 3am Calcutta ordered that all ships should sail – they needed to be as far as possible from the mainland when dawn revealed their position to enemy eyes.\nBut Tjalling Luidinga, the captain of a Dutch troop ship, the SS Slamat, didn’t heed the order. There were up to 2,000 men on land who still needed rescuing and the Slamat had space for 500 more, so he waited for more and more small boats to ferry handfuls of men to him.\nWinston Churchill, in his history of the Second World War, called Slamat’s actions “gallant but misguided effort”.\nAt about 4.15am on April 27, Slamat finally turned from the shore at Nauplia and, full speed ahead with more than 600 on board, tried to catch up with the rest of the convoy heading for Crete.\nThe citation from the Greek government marking George Welsh's wartime exploits\nBut at 7.15am, Stuka dive bombers discovered her lonely position and hit her with such ferocity that she caught fire from bow to stern.\nHMS Diamond and Wryneck were sent to her aid, with Diamond picking up about 600 survivors before firing a torpedo at the wreck so it sunk. This enabled the two warships to look for more survivors clinging to flotsam and jetsam for dear life.\nThe dive bombers returned to base, refuelled and then returned to the Myrtoan Sea, between the Greek mainland and Crete, for another killing spree.\nComing out of the sun at 1.15pm, their first bombs hit Diamond which sank within eight minutes, spewing Slamat’s survivors once more into the sea.\nGunner George Welsh on the right\nOn the bombers’ next run, three devices hit Wryneck, one going through an open hatch into the engine room and exploding. Almost immediately, Wryneck capsized to port, and those who were still alive jumped onto the lifeboat and the Carley life-floats.\nBut only 27 of Wryneck’s crew of 106 survived, some of them taking many days on their floats going around the Greek islands before they found sanctuary.\nTotal official losses for the Wryneck, Diamond and Slamat – known as \"the greatest disaster in Dutch Merchant Navy History\" – are 983, although probably more than 1,000 died that morning.\nThe family home was in King Street, which has since been demolished. Now a car park off Gladstone Street is on its site\nThe lad from King Street, Darlington, was among them, although his body, and his “dog tag”, was never recovered so he was regarded as “missing” – without evidence of his death, the officials may have thought he could have been washed up alive on a remote island. He is still listed in the book of remembrance in the Memorial Hall as “presumed dead”\nIt was only when his grand-daughter Tracy researched her family history that she discovered his story and that he was entitled to the 1940-41 Campaigns Medal from the Greek government. She got in touch with the Greek embassy which, just before Christmas, invited her and her daughter, Layla, down to London for a presentation ceremony involving three other British families who had discovered that their ancestors should also have been recipients of the medal.\nTracy and Layla went down on behalf of George’s two surviving sons, Joseph, 87, and Robert, 85, who both still live in Darlington.\nLayla Henderson, 10, receives the medal from Greek officials\n“The Greek officials gave a very moving speech about how the English and Greeks had worked together and how they will honour the lives that were lost for generations to come,” says Tracy. “They expressed their appreciation and gratitude for what he had done, so it was very emotional, but it was also a huge honour and privilege to be part of it and to receive the medal on behalf of the family.”\nREAD NEXT: HOW THE POET OF POLAM DESCRIBED THE GREAT CHRISTMAS TREE PARTY THAT WAS THE HIGHLIGHT OF DARLINGTON'S CHRISTMAS\nGunner George Welsh's body was never recovered so his name is on a monument in Athens cemetery (below)\nEcho Memories Heritage History Military Nostalgia People Darlington",

    "text": "ECRM Nobita workers say they haven’t been paid since July.\nEmployees at a Vietnam-based software firm owned by logistics major Ninja Van have staged protests over alleged unpaid salaries and overdue social insurance contributions.\nOne affected worker told Tech in Asia that ECRM Nobita , a company that offers management solutions for ecommerce vendors, has not been paying its staff in full since July this year. Workers have contacted local labor officials to intervene in the matter.\nThe protests, which are ongoing at the Hanoi and Vinh offices, come after several attempts by employees to communicate with ECRM Nobita’s HR and management teams, including a virtual meeting with Boxian Tan , co-founder and chief product officer at Singapore-headquartered Ninja Van.\nHowever, the source said ECRM Nobita employees were not permitted to speak at the meeting, and no meaningful resolution was reached.\nIn a statement to Tech in Asia , Tan explained that after learning about ECRM Nobita’s failure to fully pay its employees, Ninja Van dispatched its own teams to investigate the issue.\nA virtual meeting was then held to address all ECRM Nobita employees, who are spread across three cities in Vietnam, according to Tan.\n“ We did not take any questions during the announcement as we had scheduled in-person meetings post-announcement for better discussion in private, ” he said. “ As the owner of ECRM Nobita, we are committed to honoring our obligations and doing all we can to resolve the issue for ECRM Nobita’s employees. ”\nThe co-founder also stressed that the subsidiary is “ independent of Ninja Van’ s core operations. ”\nAccording to Ninja Van, 61 ECRM Nobita employees were affected and an internal review is underway. The issue is expected to be resolved within the next two weeks.\nIn July, Ninja Van conducted a second round of layoffs that primarily affected junior workers at its tech offices in Indonesia and Vietnam as well as 5% of junior tech positions in Singapore.\n See also: Challenging times ahead for Ninja Van as losses spike and growth slows\nUpdate (September 13, 5:10 p.m. SGT): This article has been updated with additional information from Ninja Van about the number of affected employees, the expected timeline for resolving the issue, and further details on where the protests occurred.",

    "text": "The Southwest monsoon has covered the entire country ahead of schedule, boosting prospects for kharif sowing and the newly elected government’s increase in minimum support prices for kharif crops is expected to improve disposable incomes in rural India, potentially enhancing auto retail performance.\nBased on current market conditions, the overall rating for July auto retail performance is cautiously optimistic with a moderate outlook. While some segments may see improved activity, overall growth is likely to be tempered by persistent challenges, the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA) said on Friday while sharing monthly retail sales data of June.\nAlso read: Volvo Cars to launch one electric vehicle every year, starting with EX30 next year “For two-wheelers (2W), the arrival of the monsoon is expected to provide a boost, although challenges such as agricultural cash flow constraints and regional market variations remain. In the passenger vehicle (PV) segment, high inventory levels and ongoing low market sentiment necessitate cautious management,” Manish Raj Singhania, President, FADA said.\nHe also said commercial vehicle (CV) sector looks forward to potential growth driven by renewed infrastructure projects and seasonal demands, despite current slowdowns.\n“Dealer feedback across the 2W, PV and CV segments presents a cautious picture. While dealers anticipate better sales due to improved supply and new product launches, they express concerns over low customer inquiries and market sentiment dampened by heavy rains,” Singhania said.\nOn the monthly retail sales, he said the Indian automobile retail experienced a modest year-on-year (YoY) growth of just 0.73 per cent in June as compared to the same month last year. While the 2W and three-wheeler (3W) segments registered positive YoY growths of 4.66 per cent and 5.1 per cent respectively, other categories such as PV, tractors and CV saw declines of 6.7 per cent, 28.3 per cent, and 4.7 per cent YoY, respectively.\nAlso read: Role of govt policies in promoting EV adoption in agriculture In the PV segment, the retail sales declined to 2,81,566 units in June as compared with 3,02,000 units in the corresponding month last year. Similarly, CV sales declined to 72,747 units during the month as against 76,364 units in the same month last year.\n“In the PV segment, the inventory levels have reached an all-time high, ranging from 62 to 67 days. Despite improved product availability and substantial discounts aimed at stimulating demand, market sentiment remains subdued due to extreme heat resulting in 15 per cent less walk-in’s and delayed monsoons. Dealer feedback highlights challenges such as low customer inquiries and postponed purchase decisions,” Singhania noted.\nWith the festive season still some time away, it is crucial for passenger vehicle manufacturers to exercise caution, he said adding that effective inventory management strategies are essential to mitigate financial strain from high interest costs. Therefore, FADA urged PV manufacturers to implement prudent inventory control and engage proactively with the market, he added.\nHowever, 2W sales grew at 13,75,889 units in June as compared with 13,14,628 units in the same month last year, the FADA monthly data showed. The monthly retail sales of 3W also went up to 94,321 units in June as compared with 89,743 units in June 2023.\nThe total sales of vehicles across categories grew at 18,95,552 units during the month as compared with 18,81,883 units in the corresponding month last year.",

Questa iniziativa rappresenta un’opportunità fondamentale per difendere i diritti dei lavoratori della scuola, che da troppo tempo vedono compressi i loro diritti e riconoscimenti economici e professionali\".\nL’anno 2013 \"è una data cruciale per i lavoratori della scuola, sia per chi era già in servizio, sia per chi ha iniziato a lavorare in quell’anno, oltre che per i pensionati. Le sentenze emesse dalla magistratura giudicante hanno evidenziato gravi disparità e violazioni dei diritti contrattuali, con ripercussioni significative su retribuzioni, carriere e condizioni lavorative. È per questo motivo che lo Snals Confsal ha deciso di agire con prontezza e determinazione, raccogliendo i ricorsi che potranno essere presentati al giudice del lavoro per rivendicare i diritti di chi ha subito danni e ingiustizie\"\n\"Il recupero dei diritti relativi all’anno 2013 – prosegue – non riguarda solo chi era in servizio in quell’anno, ma ha implicazioni anche per coloro che hanno iniziato a lavorare in quel periodo, così come per i pensionati che vedono riflessi nei loro trattamenti previdenziali le decisioni prese in quegli anni. Il sindacato sottolinea l’importanza di questa azione collettiva per garantire a tutti i lavoratori coinvolti, a qualsiasi livello, il riconoscimento dei diritti non adeguatamente tutelati e il recupero delle somme e degli status professionali spettanti. Lo Snals Confsal – prosegue –, con la sua storica indipendenza da qualsiasi appartenenza politico- ideologica, si impegna con serietà e dedizione nella tutela degli interessi di tutti i lavoratori della scuola. Il sindacato agisce unicamente per la difesa dei diritti dei propri iscritti, senza condizionamenti di parte, e con un approccio trasparente e focalizzato sulle reali esigenze del personale scolastico\".\nIl professor Giacomo Lo Cascio invita tutto il personale interessato a rivolgersi alla segreteria provinciale di via Vittorio Alfieri, 16, Massa, tel 0585/41733, mail [email protected] , per avere informazioni dettagliate sulla procedura per aderire ai ricorsi e sulle modalità di partecipazione. \"È fondamentale che ciascun lavoratore, sia esso attivo o già in pensione, non perda questa occasione per rivendicare i propri diritti e ottenere giustizia. Il sindacato Snals Confsal continua la sua battaglia – conclude nel suo intervento il professore – con impegno e determinazione, affinché nessun lavoratore della scuola venga lasciato indietro e affinché le conquiste ottenute siano difese e valorizzate nel rispetto della dignità e dei diritti di tutti\".",

    "text": "O presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva sancionou a lei que cria o protocolo \"Não é Não\" em todo o País, para proteger mulheres de assédio e violência em shows, bares e boates. A publicação foi feita na edição do Diário Oficial da União (DOU) desta sexta-feira, 29. A nova norma entrará em vigor em 180 dias (seis meses). Ou seja, os estabelecimentos terão de se adequar às regras até o fim de junho de 2024.\nO objetivo da lei é prevenir constrangimentos e evitar a violência contra mulheres em locais como casas noturnas, eventos festivos, bailes, espetáculos, shows com venda de bebidas alcoólicas, bares e restaurantes. Eventos religiosos ficam de fora do protocolo.\nComo funciona? Os estabelecimentos passam a ser responsáveis por monitorar possíveis situações de constrangimento (quando há insistência física ou verbal mesmo depois de a mulher manifestar discordância) e violência (ação que resulte em lesão, danos ou morte pelo uso da força).\nTambém devem preparar e capacitar pelo menos um funcionário para executar o protocolo e colocar informações em lugares visíveis sobre como acionar a medida, bem como o contato da Polícia Militar e da Central de Atendimento à Mulher.\nAo serem avisados ou identificarem indícios de constrangimento, os estabelecimentos precisam se certificar de que a vítima saiba que tem direito à assistência garantida pelo protocolo.\nOs locais ainda podem adotar ações que considerarem cabíveis para preservar a dignidade e a integridade física e psicológica da denunciante, além de apoiarem órgãos de saúde e segurança pública que possam ser acionados. Os estabelecimentos podem retirar o ofensor do espaço e impedir o retorno dele até o término das atividades.\nJá no caso de algum tipo de violência contra uma mulher, os estabelecimentos devem: Proteger a mulher e proceder às medidas de apoio do protocolo; Afastar a vítima do agressor, inclusive do seu alcance visual, permitindo que ela tenha o acompanhamento de pessoa de sua escolha, se quiser; Colaborar para a identificação das possíveis testemunhas da violência; Solicitar o comparecimento da Polícia Militar ou do agente público competente; Isolar o local específico onde existam vestígios da violência até a chegada das autoridades. Selo \"Não é Não\" A lei também cria o \"Selo 'Não é Não' - Mulheres Seguras\", que poderá ser concedido pelo poder público a estabelecimentos que sejam classificados como local seguro para mulheres, mas que não estejam na lista dos que precisam cumprir o protocolo obrigatoriamente.\nNesses casos, a empresa poderá criar um código próprio, divulgado nos sanitários femininos, para que as mulheres possam pedir ajuda aos funcionários, para que eles tomem as providências necessárias em episódios de constrangimento e violência.\nO projeto de autoria da deputada Maria do Rosário (PT-RS) foi aprovado no início de dezembro na Câmara dos Deputados. Ele havia sido aprovado em agosto pelos deputados, mas sofreu modificações no Senado Federal e retornou para a Câmara.\nMais sobre: Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva Mulheres Violência urbana Créditos Estadão Conteúdo Agência de notícias\nProdução e distribuição de informações, com o melhor conteúdo de notícias, vídeos e o maior acervo de fotojornalismo do País.\nMais lidas em Brasil 01\nSalário mínimo 2024: ministro confirma qual será o valor de aumento; veja quando entra em vigor 02\nEleições: Boulos e Nunes estão tecnicamente empatados em SP, diz pesquisa Futura Inteligência 03\nUbatuba tem 1º verão com cobrança de taxa para visitantes; saiba valor e como pagar ",

    "text": "Halle Bailey, que nunca confirmó que estuviera embarazada, anuncia el nacimiento de su bebé\nRocío Muñoz-Ledo\n(CNN) — La cantante y estrella de “La Sirenita” Halle Bailey da la bienvenida a un nuevo bebé que formará parte de su mundo.\n“Aunque llevamos pocos días de año nuevo, lo mejor que ha podido hacer 2023 por mí ha sido traerme a mi hijo”, escribió Bailey en su cuenta de Instagram junto a una foto en la que se ve la mano de su hijo recién nacido con una pulsera de oro con su nombre, “Halo”, grabado.\n“Bienvenido al mundo, mi halo”, escribió. “El mundo está ansioso por conocerte”.\nHalle Bailey comparte un momento difícil que vivió en la grabación de “The Little Mermaid”\nEl novio de Bailey, el rapero DDG, publicó la misma foto en su Instagram este sábado, y escribió: “mi mayor bendición por mucho” y que “nunca había estado tan enamorado”.\nLa pareja, a la que se vincula sentimentalmente desde 2022, no había confirmado que estuvieran esperando un bebé, por lo que el anuncio de este sábado fue una sorpresa.\nAunque no se pronunció sobre el crecimiento de su familia, Bailey ya había hablado de su floreciente relación con DDG en una entrevista de 2022 con la revista British Vogue en la que dijo que “experimentar un amor profundo por primera vez en mi vida es algo que creo que me ha abierto un mundo completamente nuevo desde el punto de vista creativo”.\n“Me gustan todos los sentimientos aterradores que vienen con eso. Me gusta el suspenso, el no saber qué va a pasar, y siento que eso es lo que se supone que tengo que vivir en la feminidad”, añadió.\nEste es el primer hijo en común de Bailey y DDG.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

    "text": "ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Hundreds of supporters from Pakistani Islamist parties on Friday rallied to protest against what they say were blasphemous remarks by the country's chief justice.\nThe protest call, by various religious and political groups led by hardline Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan (TLP) whose rallying cry is \"death to blasphemers\", said that remarks by Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa in a case against a member of the minority Ahmadi community were blasphemous.\nThe court had granted bail to an Ahmadi community member earlier this week, ruling that blasphemy charges against him did not stand. The man, accused of blasphemy for distributing Islamic literature, had been in jail for 13 months.\n\"We (will) monitor the sermons and protests outside mosques,\" said police official Abrar Hussain in southern city of Karahci, warning the protesters to remain peaceful.\nHundreds of the protesters took to streets in the northwestern city of Peshawar, chanting slogans against the chief justice, said police official Mubarak Khan.\nThe top court on Thursday issued a statement after the Islamist parties and some political groups launched a campaign accusing the chief justice of deviating in his ruling from the constitutional definition of a Muslim, which excludes Ahmadis.\n\"This impression is absolutely wrong,\" the court statement said, deploring what it called a \"vicious campaign\" against Isa.\nThe campaign against Isa was also joined by some supporters and aides of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan, who think a ruling by the chief justice stripping Khan's party of its symbol on ballots cost them votes in an election on Feb. 8.\nKhan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party's information secretary Rauf Hasan did not respond to a request for a comment.\nHuman rights groups say Pakistan's harsh blasphemy laws are often misused to settle personal scores, and just accusing someone of such a crime could lead to mob justice.\nJudges hesitate to take up such cases for fear of retribution, which leaves accused languishing in jail for years without cases being heard.\nBlasphemy is punishable by death in Pakistan. No one has been executed by the state for it, but numerous accused have been lynched by outraged mobs.\n(Reporting by Asif Shahzad in Islamabad, Ariba Shahid in Karachi and Mushtaq Ali in Peshawar; Editing by Peter Graff)\nShare © Reuters - 2024",

    "text": "Treatment emerges for rare, symptomless heart condition in Cytokinetics drug trial [James Powel](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12244761002/james-powel/) A new drug to treat a rare heart condition may be set to go before the Food and Drug Administration. Pharmaceutical company Cytokinetics [announced Wednesday](https://ir.cytokinetics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cytokinetics-announces-positive-results-sequoia-hcm-pivotal) that its drug aficamten produced, \"statistically significant and clinically meaningful\" results in the phase three trial of the [drug](/story/news/2023/12/25/weight-loss-abortion-drug-prices-psychedelics-hot-topics-of-2024/72027935007/). Aficamten is intended to treat hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a condition that thickens the heart muscle and is present in .2% of the world's population, [according to the National Institute of Health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430788/). The company said in its press release that full results of the study would be presented at, \"an upcoming medical conference.\" If the drug does make it to market it would compete against Bristol Meyer's drug Camzyos. \"A therapy like aficamten that improves exercise capacity in a clinically meaningful manner, absent low (left ventricular ejection fraction) events that interrupt treatment, should be a welcome addition for HCM patients as well as the clinicians who treat them,\" Martin Maron, M.D., Director of the Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Center at Lahey Hospital and Medical Center in Burlington, Massachusetts and principal investigator for the trial said. Cytokinetics stock closed down a quarter of a percent at [$83.24 per share](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CYTK) Thursday but is still up significantly from [Tuesday's close of $45.71](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CYTK/history?p=CYTK). What did the phase three trial find? Patients in the trial arm saw improvement in exercise tolerance, peak oxygen uptake and \"clinically meaningful improvements\" in the study's secondary endpoints including participant's Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Clinical Summary Score, according to the release. The Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Clinical Summary Score is a test that measures, \"symptoms, physical and social limitations, and quality of life in patients with heart failure,\" [according to the Journal of American College of Cardiology](https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2020.09.542). Serious adverse effects occurred in 5.6% of people in the trial arm and 9.3% of people in the placebo arm. What is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy? Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a condition that causes the heart muscle to thicken and makes it more difficult to pump blood, [according to the Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy/symptoms-causes/syc-20350198). The condition is usually caused by genetics and does not cause symptoms in many cases. Symptoms, if they are experienced, can include: - Chest pain - Fainting - Heart murmur - Sensation of fast, fluttering or pounding heartbeats (palpitations) - Shortness of breath The Mayo Clinic recommends seeking immediate medical attention if a person is experiencing rapid or irregular heartbeat, difficulty breathing or chest pain. Loyola Marymount basketball star [Hank Gathers](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2017/1201/p738.html) was killed by a cardiac arrest during a game in 1990 and his autopsy found that he had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Oklahoma City Thunder [draft pick](https://www.nba.com/thunder/news/release-johnson-230707) and former Florida Gator and Kansas State Wildcat star Keyonte Johnson was [diagnosed with the condition](https://okcthunderwire.usatoday.com/2023/06/23/okc-thunder-voices-zero-concerns-over-keyontae-johnsons-heart-condition/) after collapsing in a game in 2020.",

    "title": "Pope says Ukraine should have ‘white flag courage’ and negotiate with Russia",
    "text": "ROME — Pope Francis has said in an interview that Ukraine should have what he called the courage of the “white flag” and negotiate an end to the war with Russia that followed Moscow’s full-scale invasion two years ago and that has killed tens of thousands. Francis made his comments in an interview recorded last month with Swiss broadcaster RSI, well before Friday’s latest offer by Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan to host a summit between Ukraine and Russia to end the war. Erdogan made the fresh offer after a meeting in Istanbul with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Zelenskyy has said while he wants peace he will not give up any territory. The Ukrainian leader’s own peace plan calls for the withdrawal of Russian troops from all of Ukraine and the restoration of its state borders. The Kremlin has ruled out engaging in peace talks on terms set by Kyiv. A spokesman for Zelenskyy did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the pope’s remarks. In the interview Francis was asked for his position on a debate between those who say Ukraine should give up as it has not been able to repel Russian forces, and those who say doing so would legitimise actions by the strongest party. The interviewer used the term “white flag” in the question. “It is one interpretation, that is true,” Francis said, according to an advance transcript of the interview and a partial video made available to Reuters on Saturday. It is due to be broadcast on March 20 as part of a new cultural programme. “But I think that the strongest one is the one who looks at the situation, thinks about the people and has the courage of the white flag, and negotiates,” Francis said, adding that talks should take place with the help of international powers. “The word negotiate is a courageous word. When you see that you are defeated, that things are not going well, you have to have the courage to negotiate,” Francis said. It was believed to be the first time Francis has used terms such as “white flag” or “defeated” in discussing the Ukraine war, although he has spoken in the past about the need for negotiations. In a statement, Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said the pope had picked up on the term “white flag” spoken by the interviewer and used it “to indicate a stop to hostilities (and) a truce achieved with the courage of negotiations”. Last year the 87-year-old pope sent a peace envoy, Italian Cardinal Matteo Zuppi, to Kyiv, Moscow and Washington to sound out leaders in those countries. “One may feel shame,” Francis said about negotiating, “but how many dead will it (the war) end up with? (One should) negotiate in time, find a country that can be a mediator,” Francis said, mentioning Turkey among the countries that had offered. “Do not be ashamed of negotiating, before things get worse,” said Francis, who has made hundreds of appeals for what he calls “martyred Ukraine”. Asked if he was willing to mediate, Francis said “I am here”. In another part of the interview, speaking of the war between Israel and Hamas, Francis said: “Negotiating is never a surrender”. Last month Zelenskyy said that 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed since the Russian invasion in February 2022 and that tens of thousands of civilians had been killed in the occupied areas of the country.",
