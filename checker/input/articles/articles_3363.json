    "title": "Trudeau ‘targeted’ by pro-Modi outlets after Nijjar assassination allegations: docs - National | Globalnews.ca",
    "text": "Media outlets aligned with the Indian government “targeted” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau after he revealed Canada suspected India was behind the killing of B.C. Sikh leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar, new documents suggest. A report by the Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM), a unit with Global Affairs Canada that monitors state-sponsored disinformation, said commentators at outlets that backed Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi amplified highly similar narratives that sought to discredit Trudeau and Canada. The report was released by a federal inquiry investigating allegations of foreign interference in the 2019 and 2021 federal elections. The analysis of online platforms found that pro-Modi news media and influencers also went after Canadian security agencies, the Sikh diaspora and Canada’s High Commissioner to India following Trudeau’s September 2023 announcement linking Indian agents to Nijjar’s murder. An outspoken leader of the Khalistan movement that seeks independence for India’s Punjab region, Nijjar was gunned down in the parking lot of the Guru Nanak Sikh Temple in Surrey, B.C. on June 18, 2023. In May, the four suspected gunmen were arrested in Alberta and Ontario. Trudeau’s public announcement that the Canadian government had “credible allegations” of a “potential link” between Nijjar’s killers and agents of the Indian government further chilled an already frosty relationship between Ottawa and New Delhi. Get breaking National news Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy . “(The) incident has quickly evolved into a diplomatic crisis between Canada and India that will likely carry considerable implications for Canadian foreign policy,” the RRM report, included in a cache of documents released by the Hogue inquiry Thursday, read. The report noted that some pro-Modi news outlets painted Canada as “isolated” within the G7, and suggested the country’s allies were not eager to “clash” with India amidst sanctions on Russia and an increasingly confrontational China. The RCMP is still investigating several Indian officials and agents it suspects were involved in Nijjar’s killing. India has pushed back at the suggestion it assassinated Nijjar because of his prominent role in the Khalistan movement, but at the same time it has branded him a wanted terrorist leader. The United States has also accused an Indian intelligence officer of hiring alleged drug trafficker Nikhil Gupta to murder one of Nijjar’s associates, Gurpatwant Pannun, the New York-based lawyer for the group Sikhs for Justice. Gupta was arrested in the Czech Republic on June 30. The report said the RMM Canada had “observed high levels of similarity in the tone and type of narratives” that Modi-aligned media had used to discredit the allegation of India’s involvement in Nijjar’s killing, but added “it was not possible for RMM Canada to verify if these outlets worked in conjunction to amplify their reach.” Chinese state-controlled news outlets such as Global Times and Xinhua also joined in with “robust coverage” and were “opportunistic in replicating narratives from a range of Indian sources that put Canada in a negative light” and depicted Ottawa as isolated from its allies, said the report. “The tenor of the narratives was often heated, with commentators employed by Modi-aligned outlets posting that PM Trudeau and Canadian institutions were ‘enablers of terrorism,’ ‘falling into the laps of Khalistani extremists,’ or ‘treacherous’ against India, according to the report. It said media aligned with Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party reach millions more readers than Canadian news outlets, giving them a “distinct advantage in amplifying negative narratives about Canada and its position on the killing of Nijjar.” Both the Foreign Interference Commission and the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians (NSICOP) have ranked India as the number two foreign interference threat to Canada, behind only China. The RRM was established by G7 countries at a meeting in Charlevoix, Que., in 2018 as a way to monitor and “respond to diverse and growing threats to democracy.”",

    "text": "综合美媒报道，当地时间3月4日，美国国务院宣布停止“全球空气质量监测”项目，美国驻外使领馆将停止发布空气质量数据。\n所谓“全球空气质量监测”项目创立于2008年，项目运作期间，全球80多个美国使领馆在屋顶上安装空气质量监测器，并将采集的空气数据进行实时共享。\n据法新社报道，美国国务院4日宣布因“预算限制”不再能够继续发布空气污染数据。美国国务院表示，历史数据将留存在环境保护署的一个网站上，但实时数据已于4日停止更新，并将在相关项目重新获得经费前一直处于宕机状态。据报道，美国总统特朗普上台后大幅削减了海外以及环境支出。截至记者发稿时，此前用于公布相关数据的页面已显示为“页面不存在”。\n美国国务院标志（资料图）图自美媒\n美国驻华使馆从2008年起开始监测并发布北京的空气质量数据，2011年开始发布广州的空气数据，2012年驻上海领事馆也开始发布数据。中国外交部发言人当时对此表示，外国驻华使领馆不具有在中国开展环境监测和发布相关数据的法定资质，也不具备从事环境监测的专业能力和条件。\n【责任编辑：于璧嘉 编辑：郭艳丽】",
