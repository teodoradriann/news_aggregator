    "title": "AI impersonation scams are exploding: Here's how to spot and stop them | The Sealy News",
    "text": "Linaimages // Shutterstock\nAI impersonation scams are exploding: Here's how to spot and stop them\nThe conversational AI market is exploding. Grand View Research suggests it's set to jump from $11.58 billion in 2024 to $41.39 billion by 2030, a massive 23.7% annual growth rate. While businesses use AI to boost customer service, cybercriminals are jumping in too, launching slick impersonation scams.\nThese scams are spreading fast. A report from the Identity Theft Resource Center shows a 148% spike in impersonation scams between April 2024 and March 2025 as scammers spin up fake business websites, create lifelike AI chatbots, and build voice agents that sound just like real company reps. In 2024 alone, the Federal Trade Commission reported $2.95 billion in losses due to impersonation scams.\nHeimdal breaks down how scammers fake customer service, points out the industries they hit hardest, and shares simple ways to double-check who you’re talking to before giving up your personal info.\nThe technology behind the deception\nToday’s AI scams blend high-tech tools with surprisingly simple methods, making impersonation easier than ever.\nHow AI powers slick impersonation\nVoice cloning has gotten scarily accurate. McAfee notes that with just three seconds of audio, scammers can copy someone’s voice so well that in its study of 7,000 people, 70% weren’t confident enough to tell if the voice was real or a clone.\nAI chatbots have also leveled up. They mirror tone, language, and responses so well they’re almost impossible to tell apart from real customer service reps.\nOn top of both, fake website creation has exploded. AI can whip up polished product descriptions, realistic images, and fake reviews that look legit — all in minutes.\nFraud is easier than ever\nStarting an AI scam is cheap and fast. According to a 2024 Deloitte study, scamming software sells on the dark web for as little as $20. Scams can not only be cheap, but they work fast: Consumer advice charity Advance Direct Scotland found that an AI scam can go live in under two minutes.\nThese low costs and easy access have supercharged growth. Open-source fraud reporting platform Chainabuse reports that generative AI scams quadrupled between May 2024 and April 2025.\nMore than 38,000 new scam pages popped up every day in the first half of 2024, according to Security Boulevard. The mix of powerful tech and easy access makes AI business impersonation one of the fastest-growing threats facing consumers today.\nIndustries under siege: Most targeted sectors\nNo industry is completely safe from AI impersonation scams, but some face much bigger risks because of the sensitive data and money they handle.\nFinancial services: The primary target\nThe financial sector sits at the top of scammers’ hit list. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network warned U.S. banks in November 2024 about the surge in AI-powered identity fraud.\nDeloitte expects U.S. banking fraud losses to soar from $12.3 billion in 2023 to $40 billion by 2027. Signicat’s Battle Against AI-driven Identity Fraud report, based on February 2024 data, found that AI drives over 42% of all fraud.\nE-commerce and retail\nOnline shopping platforms are another favorite target. According to Juniper Research, e-commerce fraud is projected to rocket from $44.3 billion in 2024 to a staggering $107 billion by 2029. Microsoft has exposed scams using fake shopping sites and AI chatbots designed to harvest payment details and personal info.\nMost impersonated entities\nScammers love going after businesses. Identity Theft Resource Center’s 2025 report notes that about 51% of impersonation scams target them directly, while 21% focus on financial institutions, all rich with data that scammers crave.\nAs AI scams keep evolving, businesses in these industries need to stay alert and rethink their defenses to keep up with this fast-moving threat.\nAnatomy of modern AI scams: Real-world case studies\nLooking at actual incidents shows just how sophisticated and convincing AI-powered scams have become, even fooling cautious, tech-savvy individuals.\nThe $25 million deepfake video conference scam\nIn one of the most shocking cases to date, a Hong Kong finance worker was tricked into transferring 200 million Hong Kong dollars (about $25.6 million) after attending a deepfake video call with what appeared to be the company’s chief financial officer and other senior colleagues.\nThe employee initially suspected a phishing attempt but was convinced by a highly realistic video conference. Scammers used publicly available video footage to create AI-generated versions of each participant, perfectly mimicking voices and facial expressions to make the fake meeting appear completely authentic.\nTech company CEO impersonations\nCybercriminals have increasingly targeted tech companies by impersonating top executives. At the company LastPass, an employee received calls, texts, and WhatsApp messages from someone posing as the CEO. The voice was cloned using audio taken from YouTube videos.\nAt cloud security firm Wiz, scammers used an AI-generated voice clone of the CEO to leave voicemails for dozens of employees, asking for sensitive credentials. In both cases, the impersonations were realistic enough to almost trick seasoned security professionals.\nConsumer-facing scams\nAI scams aren’t limited to corporate environments. In Canada, three men lost a combined 373,000 Canadian dollars (over $273,000) after being convinced by deepfake videos featuring what appeared to be Justin Trudeau and Elon Musk promoting a fake investment scheme.\nVoice cloning scams are also widespread. In the McAfee study, 10% of respondents received a message from an AI voice clone. Of those targeted, 77% reported financial losses.\nThe ‘scam sweatshop’ operation\nAccording to The Sunday Post, authorities in Scotland uncovered so-called AI “scam sweatshops,” where criminals generated hyperpersonalized fraud campaigns in under two minutes using freely available AI apps. These operations swindled over 700,000 pounds (more than $945,000) from Scots through highly targeted voice and text-based scams.\nThese real-world examples highlight a sobering reality: AI-driven scams are no longer crude or obvious; they are highly advanced and often indistinguishable from legitimate interactions.\nRegulatory response: The FTC fights back\nAs AI-powered impersonation scams have exploded, regulators have scrambled to keep up. Leading the charge, the FTC has rolled out new rules to protect both consumers and businesses.\nThe Government and Business Impersonation Rule\nLaw firm WilmerHale explains that the FTC’s Impersonation Rule, which took effect in April 2024, makes it illegal to materially and falsely pose as a government agency or business. This landmark rule gives the FTC the power to move fast against scammers running fake websites, pushing fraudulent chatbots, or using AI voice agents to mislead people.\nViolators face fines of up to $53,088 per violation. The rule also allows the FTC to drag scammers into federal court to secure refunds for victims, a big step in helping people get their money back.\nFirst-year results\nThe FTC didn’t waste time. In its first year, the agency filed five enforcement actions under the new rule and shut down 13 fake websites posing as the commission itself.\nThe FTC also launched \"Operation AI Comply,\" a crackdown on AI-powered fraud. This effort has targeted AI chatbots offering fake “legal advice” and tools flooding review sites with phony testimonials, all designed to erode public trust.\nProposed extensions\nScams keep evolving, and the FTC knows it. ReadWrite notes that the agency has proposed expanding the rule to cover impersonation of individuals, a direct move against voice cloning and deepfake scams that can mimic real people almost perfectly.\nThese regulatory moves mark a strong first step. But they also show that fighting AI scams will require constant vigilance from both regulators and the public.\nRed flags: How to spot AI impersonation\nEven the most polished AI scams leave small tells. Learning to catch these clues can help you avoid falling for them.\nChatbot warning signs\nResponse patterns: If a chatbot replies instantly and flawlessly every time, be cautious. While quick responses are normal, perfect spelling and grammar — combined with robotic or awkward phrasing — often point to AI, not a human.\nBehavioral red flags: Be wary if the bot repeats itself often or keeps pushing one solution. Real reps usually offer options and handle specific questions smoothly. AI bots tend to struggle when the conversation goes off-script.\nTechnical signs: Bots often have uniform response delays, no matter how complex the question is. They’re also available 24/7 without normal staffing patterns.\nVoice cloning detection\nAudio quality issues: Listen for weird pauses, odd tone shifts, or strange audio glitches. AI voices usually miss the natural emotion and flow of real speech.\nConversation patterns: Scammers using cloned voices often keep calls short and urgent to avoid questions. If someone you know sounds “off” or acts strangely, don’t ignore it.\nWebsite and email verification\nVisual inspection: Real business websites generally show full contact details, including a physical address, phone number, and official email. Look for security badges and seals from trusted organizations.\nCommunication channels: When in doubt, go straight to the source. Call or email using contact info from official statements or the company’s main website, not links from pop-ups or emails.\nSpotting these signals and taking a moment to double-check can stop a scam before it even starts.\nProtection Strategies: Your Defense Against AI Scams\nOnce you learn to spot impersonation attempts, the next step is building strong defenses. A mix of smart habits and proactive strategies can make a huge difference in keeping you safe.\nImmediate verification steps\nMultichannel confirmation: Always double-check unexpected requests, even if the number seems familiar. If a chatbot or caller asks for sensitive info or urgent payments, hang up or close the chat. Then, reach out directly through an official phone number or email from the company’s website.\nFamily and business protocols: Set up a “safe word” with family to confirm emergencies. For businesses, employers can implement dual approval for transactions so no single person can approve large payments alone.\nDigital hygiene practices\nVoice protection: Consider using automated voicemail greetings instead of your own voice to cut down cloning risks. Avoid sharing voice data online, a habit worth building since 53% of adults share voice recordings weekly without thinking about the risks, according to McAfee’s report.\nInformation sharing: Never share passwords, Social Security numbers, or financial details over chat, email, or phone unless you’re absolutely sure who you’re talking to. Be extra cautious with urgent or pushy requests.\nBusiness security measures\nEmployee training: Teach employees about new AI impersonation tactics. Regularly update them on scam trends and make sure they know the steps to verify any requests involving sensitive data or large payments.\nTechnical safeguards: Use multifactor authentication to reduce the risk of unauthorized access. Another common suggestion is checking financial statements and account activity often to catch suspicious transactions early.\nCombining sharp habits, solid tech tools, and clear protocols gives you the best defense against fast-evolving AI scams.\nStaying ahead of the AI arms race\nAI has completely reshaped the fraud game. Putting advanced tools into almost anyone’s hands allows scammers to pull off schemes that used to require elite hacking skills. Because of this, old-school detection methods just can’t keep up.\nBut despite these challenges, consumers still have strong ways to fight back. Using solid verification habits and staying skeptical are some of the best defenses for keeping personal and financial info safe.\nOn the regulatory side, the FTC’s tough enforcement of the Impersonation Rule shows the government is serious about stopping AI-powered scams. New proposals, such as expanding the rule to cover individual impersonation, show policymakers are adjusting to keep pace with fast-changing threats.\nLooking forward, AI scams will only get more advanced, so our awareness and defenses need to evolve too. Staying informed, regularly updating security habits, and sharing what you learn with others will be key to staying safe.\nIf you think you’ve run into an AI impersonation scam, report it at ReportFraud.ftc.gov. Your quick action protects you and helps authorities spot new threats, keeping others from getting caught in the same traps.\nThis story was produced by Heimdal and reviewed and distributed by Stacker.",

    "text": "News industry off to brutal 2024 start as mass layoffs devastate publishers, raising questions about the future of journalism\nBy Oliver Darcy and Jon Passantino, CNN\n(CNN) — The news industry is enduring a brutal start to the new year, with outlets large and small across the country hemorrhaging reporting staff as legacy business models that kept much of the industry afloat for decades collapse in plain sight.\nThe rapid contraction, coming even as the presidential election cycle heats up and public attention and revenues historically mount, has been on full display this month, with the first few weeks of 2024 ushering in a spate of painful layoffs at news organizations from coast-to-coast.\nThe Los Angeles Times slashed its newsroom by more than 20% earlier this week; TIME cut dozens of staffers; and Business Insider said it would trim its workforce by 8%. Meanwhile, hundreds of staffers at Condé Nast, Forbes, The New York Daily News, and others staged historic walkouts to protest planned cuts at the outlets.\nThe recent round of layoffs, while pronounced, are part of a much larger and unrelenting storm battering the journalism industry. Over the past 18 months, most news organizations have been forced to make difficult decisions to reduce their workforces.\nAt the national level, CNN, The Washington Post, NPR, Vice Media, Sports Illustrated, Vox Media, NBC News, CNBC, and other organizations have cut swaths of their reporting staff. At the local level, layoffs have been nearly constant, with newspaper giant Gannett cutting hundreds of employees, and small outlets carving out already lean operations.\nThe latest round of layoffs come after 2023 marked the worst year for job cuts in the journalism sector since Covid-19 upended the world in 2020, with roughly 2,700 jobs eliminated.\nWhile each outlet is struggling with its own unique challenges, they all are facing brutal industry headwinds ushered in by the internet revolution and other technological advances that have fundamentally changed the way the public consumes news and entertainment.\nAudiences that once reliably surfed traditional cable channels and consumed news websites or newspapers are instead absorbing content and spending time on platforms such as TikTok and Netflix, leading to massive declines in ratings and traffic. That shift in behavior has led brands to spend their marketing in emerging digital arenas, particularly given their ability to offer advertisers powerful tools to target audiences with precision.\nMaking matters worse, news outlets have seen their online advertising businesses vanish as social media and search giants devour much of the industry’s dollars. Research produced by Columbia University in October estimated that technology titans Google and Meta should pay news outlets $14 billion per year in revenue for their search traffic and content, a figure it\ndescribed as “conservative.” But technology companies have resisted paying publishers for their content and launched high-profile fights to block legislation intended to recoup some of the lost revenue.\n“The ad industry doesn’t need the news industry when there are so many other ways to purchase attention, and so many better ways to target users,” Jay Rosen, an associate professor of journalism at New York University, told CNN.\nThe change in behavior has also meant news consumers are canceling subscriptions to newspapers and cable providers, cutting precious revenues even further.\n“I am sorry to say that I do not see turning around most legacy outlets,” Jeff Jarvis, the Leonard Tow Professor of Journalism Innovation at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism, told CNN. “Their proprietors, with few exceptions, did not adapt to the internet. They held onto their old business models — advertising, subscription, and the attention economy.”\n“Many of them are now controlled by hedge funds, which will not invest or innovate,” Jarvis said, adding that cost-cutting is the “predictable response to a worsening downward business spiral,” which “will make the products of these publications only worse, which will accelerate the spiral.”\n“The death of newspapers — and magazines and linear TV — has been oft-foretold and has not yet occurred,” Jarvis said. “The fall might be coming now.”\nThe hollowing out of large news institutions comes at a perilous time for America. Antidemocratic candidates have intentionally worked to undermine faith in news outlets as they look to seize power in election contests from coast to coast, attacking those tasked with the duty of holding public officials accountable.\n“To say that trust in the news media has declined is correct, but too vague,” Rosen said. “The reality is that destroying confidence in the practice and products of journalism is a potent and successful political strategy, as with Steve Bannon’s ‘flood the zone.’”\nThat lack of accountability means dishonest figures seeking higher office, and those in positions of power, could avoid crucial scrutiny, leaving the electorate less informed about the vital decisions it will have to make in November at the ballot box.\nMargaret Sullivan, a columnist at The Guardian who previously wrote about media for The Washington Post and The New York Times, told CNN in December that she is worried about the larger consequences the deeper cuts in the news business will have on the country. Sullivan said that it is not only “heartbreaking to see the loss of these jobs,” but warned the action will do “damage to society.”\n“The loss of journalists contributes to the exponential growth of news deserts in large swaths of the nation — and that’s disastrous when misinformation is rampant,” Sullivan said. “Democracy needs an informed electorate in order to function and that is tragically dwindling in many regions.”\nFor a time, there had been hope that billionaire ownership of news publications could offer stability to the industry as it wears off legacy business models. Recent months, however, have cast doubt on that optimism, with Jeff Bezos’ Washington Post and Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong’s Los Angeles Times making significant cuts to their newsrooms.\nBut despite the widespread gloom, there are some encouraging signs popping up across the industry. Dan Kennedy, a journalism professor at Northeastern University, noted some local news outlets have found financial sustainability.\n“Billionaire newspaper ownership is coming under fire lately because of Soon-Shiong’s fecklessness and because Jeff Bezos has hit a few bumps with the Post, although I think that will prove to be temporary,” Kennedy told CNN, pointing to recent successes at The Minneapolis Star Tribune and The Boston Globe newspapers.\n“There are reasons to be optimistic given the hundreds of independent local news organizations that have sprouted up in recent years,” he said. “The challenge is that coverage at the hyperlocal level is hit or miss, as some communities are well-served and others — especially in rural areas and in urban communities of color — tend to be overlooked.”\nBut Rosen cautioned against the reliance on deep-pocketed philanthropists to sustain journalistic enterprises in the long-term.\n“Journalists have to take it upon themselves to treat sustainability as their problem, but this is not what they signed up for,” he said. “They signed up to do stories.”\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.
