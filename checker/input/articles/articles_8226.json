    "text": "“It’s Unfair…”: Damian Lillard’s Ex-Teammate Gives His Verdict on 7x All-Star’s Bucks Move [](https://bit.ly/4113QfS) Follow Us Damian Lillard left the NBA world clueless throughout the 2023 off-season with his trade intentions. And, finally, days before the season opener, the 7x NBA All-Star got his nod from the Milwaukee Bucks franchise. Since then, Lillard hasn’t looked back as he got what he wished for, a run at the championship. However, it didn’t sit well with one of his former teammates, as he gave his verdict ahead of his reunion game. America’s Favorite Video Today Zach Collins, who moved to the San Antonio Spurs in 2021 after spending 3 years with the Portland Trail Blazers, commented on the big Bucks trade. Ahead of the Spurs’ game against the Blazers, Collins made his verdict. He said, “It’s definitely weird, it’s unfair… to be in the transition when he is not here is definitely different.” Homecoming for [@zcollins_33]as he faces his former team. He goes one-on-one with [@DanWeissPBP]to talk about his return to Portland.

    "text": "The pope’s 2023: A year of health challenges, travel and the synod December 29, 2023By Cindy Wooden Catholic News Service Filed Under: Feature, News, Vatican, World News VATICAN CITY (CNS) — Pope Francis’ 2023 was a year of important trips made or postponed, a predecessor’s funeral and his own 10th anniversary as pope, a call to the world to act on climate change and a call to the Catholic Church to strengthen its mission by learning “synodality.” The Argentine pope, who was born Dec. 17, 1936, was to finish the year as an 87-year-old. As the oldest reigning pope in the last 120 years, Pope Francis’ year was punctuated with hospitalizations, breathing difficulties and ongoing mobility challenges. The last pope to serve at his age was Pope Leo XIII, who died at the age of 93 in 1903.

(CNS photo/Lola Gomez) For Pope Francis, the year began with mourning Pope Benedict XVI, who resigned in 2013 and died Dec. 31, 2022. Pope Francis spent the week after his death speaking about his predecessor, lauding his “wisdom, tenderness, devotion” and lauding how his theology was a direct result of his faith. “His explanation of the faith was carried out with the devotion of a man who has surrendered all of himself to God and who, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, sought an ever-greater participation in the mystery of that Jesus who had fascinated him from his youth,” Pope Francis wrote in the introduction to a book published by the Vatican. Pope Francis presided over his predecessor’s funeral Jan. 5, and preaching about the Gospel rather than giving a eulogy as liturgical norms dictate, he built his homily around four quotations from Pope Benedict. The first of five foreign trips Pope Francis made in 2023 took him to Congo and then on an ecumenical peace mission to South Sudan. The trip with the Anglican archbishop of Canterbury and the moderator of the Presbyterian Church of Scotland had been set for July 2022, but was canceled because Pope Francis was experiencing intense pain in his knee. Even though he was well enough to travel in 2023, the knee continued to be a problem. Photos taken in his residence often showed him using a walker. He would be pushed in a wheelchair to his place when presiding at Mass in St. Peter’s Basilica and when greeting people at his general audiences. On days when it was not so painful, he would use a silver cane. Pope Francis spent nine days in Rome’s Gemelli hospital in June after undergoing a three-hour surgery to repair a hernia. Surgeons also removed several adhesions or bands of scar tissue that had formed after previous surgeries decades ago. Suffering from a respiratory infection, he also spent four days in March in the suite of rooms the Gemelli reserves for the pope. When he was experiencing respiratory difficulties again in late November, he went to the Gemelli Isola hospital for a CT scan but returned to his Vatican residence the same day. He was given intravenous antibiotics at home but kept many of his appointments, even if he did have an aide read his speeches for him. Pope Francis meets with participants from a seminar on ethics in health care management at the Vatican Nov. 30, 2023. (CNS photo/Vatican Media) The bronchial infection, which made his breathing very labored, forced him to cancel his planned trip to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates in early December for COP28; he would have been the first pope to attend a U.N. climate change summit. “Are we working for a culture of life or a culture of death?” he asked world leaders in his COP28 message read in Dubai by Cardinal Pietro Parolin, Vatican secretary of state. “To all of you I make this heartfelt appeal: Let us choose life! Let us choose the future!” The destruction of the environment is “a sin” that not only “greatly endangers all human beings, especially the most vulnerable,” he wrote to the leaders, but it also “threatens to unleash a conflict between generations.” In anticipation of the conference, Pope Francis in early October released “Laudate Deum” (“Praise God”), a follow-up document to his 2015 encyclical “Laudato Si’, On Care for Our Common Home.” “We must move beyond the mentality of appearing to be concerned but not having the courage needed to produce substantial changes,” he wrote in “Laudate Deum.” Making an even more urgent appeal for action than he did with “Laudato Si’,” the pope wrote that COP28 could “represent a change of direction, showing that everything done since 1992 (with the adoption of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change) was in fact serious and worth the effort, or else it will be a great disappointment and jeopardize whatever good has been achieved thus far.” The two major events Pope Francis was able to participate in were World Youth Day in Lisbon, Portugal, in August and the long-awaited first assembly of the Synod of Bishops on Synodality in October. WYD brought more than 1.5 million young people together and, in a letter for local youth day celebrations in November, Pope Francis described it as an “event that surpassed all our expectations. Our meeting in Lisbon was magnificent, a genuine experience of renewal, an explosion of light and joy!” Throughout his visit to Portugal, in meetings both with young people and with clergy, the pope’s refrain was that in the church there is room for “todos, todos, todos” — “everyone, everyone, everyone.” Pope Francis smiles as members of the assembly of the Synod of Bishops approach the end of their work Oct. 28, 2023, in the Paul VI Hall at the Vatican. (CNS photo/Vatican Media) “Please, let us not convert the church into a customs office” where only the “just,” “good,” and “properly married” can enter while leaving everyone else outside, he told Portuguese bishops, priests and pastoral workers. “No. The church is not that,” he said, rather it is a place for “righteous and sinners, good and bad, everyone, everyone, everyone.” Interviewed by Italian television about the Oct. 4-29 assembly of the Synod of Bishops, the pope said, “The result is positive. Everything was discussed with full freedom, and this is a beautiful thing.” Asked specifically about the assembly’s discussions about welcoming gay Catholics, Pope Francis responded: “When I say ‘everyone, everyone, everyone,’ it’s the people. The church receives people, everyone, and does not ask what you are. Then, within the church, everyone grows and matures in their Christian belonging. It’s true that today it’s a bit fashionable to talk about this. The church receives everyone.” At his Mass concluding the synod assembly, the pope summarized his key hope for the synod, which will meet again in October 2024: “The Lord will guide us and help us to be a more synodal and missionary church, a church that adores God and serves the women and men of our time, going forth to bring to everyone the consoling joy of the Gospel.” Just days before the synod opened, Pope Francis created 21 new cardinals from 16 nations, including Cardinal Robert F. Prevost, the Chicago-born prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops, and French Cardinal Christophe Pierre, the nuncio to the United States. In an interview with Mexican journalist Valentina Alazraki Dec. 12, the pope said he feels “quite well” physically and his health continues to improve. Yet asked if people should be concerned about his health, he responded, “Yes, a little bit, yes. I need them to pray for my health.” Read More Vatican News ‘Listening is act of love,’ says papal message to European youths Cardinal says Vatican is not moving toward accepting gay marriage Pope encourages persecuted Christians to stay strong in their witness ‘The devil is a seducer,’ pope says as he begins new series of talks Pope’s Christmas message: Say ‘yes’ to the Prince of Peace, ‘no’ to war At Christmas, God shows love through ‘littleness,’ not power, pope says Copyright © 2023 Catholic News Service/U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops Print",

    "title": "Euroliga: Voigtmann y Melli frenan a un impotente Baskonia en Milán | Marca",
    "text": "J ohannes Voigtmann y Nico Melli frenaron este jueves a un impotente Baskonia que cayó en Milán por 76-67 en un choque en el que los vitorianos no lograron superar su mal arranque ante un mermado Armani en la decimoséptima jornada de la Euroliga.\nFicha técnica 76 - Armani Milán (20+26+14+16): Flaccadori (14), Hall (-), Melli (21), Voigtmann (19) y Hines (8) -cinco inicial-, Poythress (5), Bortolani (-), Tonut (7), Baron (-), Kamagate (2) y Caruso (-). 67 - Baskonia (12+19+17+19): Miller-McIntyre (4), Marinkovic (10), Díez (-), Sedekerskis (12) y Kotsar (2) -cinco inicial-, Chiozza (-), Rogkavopoulos (6), Howard (7), Diop (3), Costello (9) y Moneke (14). Árbitros: Mehdi Difallah (Francia), Gytis Vilius (Lituania) y Josip Radojkovic (Croacia). Eliminaron por faltas personales a Costello (min.39). Señalaron falta antideportiva al visitante Howard (min.23). Incidencias: Partido correspondiente a la decimoséptima jornada de la Euroliga disputado en Mediolanum Forum de Milán. Los italianos llegaron a manejar rentas de 22 puntos tras el descanso y aunque los azulgranas lograron reaccionar con jugadores menos habituales, apenas lograron bajar la diferencia por debajo de los 10 puntos.\nLos bajos porcentajes exteriores y la concentración defensiva fueron dos factores que marcaron un partido en el que los líderes de los lombardos no pudieron jugar. En cambio, aparecieron hombres como el exbaskonista Johannes Voigtmann, con 19 puntos y 12 rebotes, y Nico Melli, con 24 créditos de valoración, para reventar la pintura de los azulgranas, que solo encontraron chispazos de algunos jugadores.\nEl equipo lombardo entró mucho mejor en el partido con un parcial de 14-3. Los errores de los baskonistas se sucedieron en uno y otro lado con errores de marca y tres puntos en los primeros cinco minutos de un encuentro marcado por las ausencias de jugadores clave en los locales.\nLos de Ettore Messina tuvieron más paciencia en la elaboración, mientras que los azulgranas se obsesionaron con el triple hasta que reaccionaron con la entrada de Chris Chiozza, que comenzó a repartir juego y el Baskonia comenzó a crecer.\nSin embargo, el segundo triple de Johannes Voigtmann dejó un 20-12 que frenó el empuje de un Baskonia que fue a rachas.\nLa defensa de los locales dieron puntos muy fáciles a un Milán mucho más intenso, que volvió a abrir hueco en un arranque de segundo cuarto cargado de errores vascos, que se encontraron con un activo Stefano Tonut.\nDiego Flaccadori irrumpió para liderar a su equipo en ataque, Nico Melli cogió el testigo y Armani tomó una renta superior a los diez puntos ante un Baskonia que sufría para anotar y solo sumaba al contragolpe.\nVanja Marinkovic fue el baskonista más inspirado y evitó una sangría de los locales, que incluso perdonaron a su rival con errores en varios tiros liberados y se fueron por delante con un 46-31, donde el acierto exterior y las pérdidas de balón marcaron la diferencia.\nEl paso por vestuarios no cambió mucho el partido. El Milán siguió golpeando con comodidad y superó los 20 puntos de distancia a lomos de un desatado Nico Melli y un acertado Johannes Voigtmann, que castigaron una y otra vez a un desquiciado Baskonia, incapaz de encontrar soluciones.\nTodo coincidió además con la tercera falta personal de Markus Howard, una de las bazas vascas para intentar iniciar la remontada. De hecho, los azulgranas dieron un paso adelante en defensa y endosaron un parcial de 0-12, que les volvió a meter en el partido con diez minutos por delante, 60-48, con un quinteto atípico.\nPero el Baskonia no consiguió mantener la intensidad para defender su aro. Fue víctima de sus errores y no fue capaz de cerrar las vías de agua que abrieron jugadores como Melli o Flaccadori.\nDusko Ivanovic continuó creyendo en los hombres que arañaron los puntos a los italianos y aunque volvieron acercarse a diez puntos, desaprovecharon varias ocasiones claras de apretar aún más un marcador controlado por Armani, que aunque le faltó acierto para cerrar el partido, apeló a su defensa para evitar sustos y llevarse el duelo por 76-67.",

    "text": "A storm-driven rogue wave crashed past a seawall in California and struck running beachgoers, pushed cars and turned streets into rivers.\nThe entire terrifying ordeal was captured on\nvideo by a bystander in Ventura on Thursday.\nA man can be seen walking calmly on the sand in the Pierpont neighborhood near Seaward Avenue as a swell in the distance approaches the seawall.\nThe water continues toward the shore and when it doesn’t stop, several people begin to flee.\nColin Hoag, who\n recorded the unusual occurrence, can be heard saying some expletives as he runs while still filming the swell continuing to climb up the street.\nPeople can be heard screaming and a car is seen driving up the street with water surrounding it.\n‘Oh my god,’ Haog says, as he stops several blocks away from the shore. Water is seen spreading more slowly.\nShop owners step outside to observe the streets turned into rivers. Some people wade more than ankle deep in the water.\n‘I was able to capture this entire event on video this morning at the Seaward wall in Pierpont,’ wrote Hoag on\nFacebook on Thursday afternoon.\nAt least eight people were injured, according to Ventura County Fire Department Spokesman Andy Vansciver.\n‘All of the people in the area were swept down on to shore,’ Vansciver told\nKEYT. ‘Multiple vehicles in the area were moved around and swept around due to the impact and force of the water.’\nThere were at least 12 swift water rescues across Ventura County. The fire department urged the public to stay away form beaches.\nThe rogue wave was generated by powerful storms in the Pacific Ocean that have caused coastal flooding and evacuations across the California coast and in Hawaii.\nEvacuation orders were in effect in Marin County on Thursday morning and later in the day in Santa Cruz County.\nWaves were estimated to reach 28 to 40 feet, the National\nWeather Service said.\nConditions were expected to improve in San Francisco on Friday morning, but forecasters said the worst could still be ahead in parts of southern California, with San Diego likely to see highest surf on Saturday. Los Angeles is on a high surf and coastal flooding advisory through Saturday at 10pm.\nGet in touch with our news team by emailing us at .\nFor more stories like this,\ncheck our news page.\nSign Up for News Updates\nGet your need-to-know latest news, feel-good stories, analysis and more\nPrivacy Policyand Terms of Serviceapply.",

    "text": "El tiempo se está acabando: científicos advierten sobre el fracaso de los puntos de inflexión climáticos clave\nLos científicos han publicado un nuevo estudio en el que advierten sobre el colapso de una corriente oceánica clave, y sus efectos podrían tener consecuencias nefastas en todo el mundo. El informe también analiza otros puntos de inflexión climáticos.\nA principios de este año, Venezuela perdió su último glaciar. La capa de hielo de Groenlandia está perdiendo 30 millones de toneladas de hielo por hora. La pérdida de hielo del glaciar Thwaites, conocido como el \"glaciar del fin del mundo\", podría ser imparable. Un nuevo estudio resume el estado de la nieve y el hielo en la Tierra este año.\nAlcanzando el punto de inflexión\nLos hallazgos de más de 50 científicos especializados en nieve y hielo, en un nuevo informe de la Iniciativa Internacional sobre el Clima de la Criosfera, resumen el estado de la nieve y el hielo en 2024. Los expertos coinciden en que ha sido un año horrible para la criosfera de la Tierra como resultado del calentamiento global.\nLos científicos están preocupados de que la Circulación Meridional Atlántica (AMOC por su sigla en inglés) esté en camino de colapsar. La AMOC es una corriente clave que rige los ciclos de calor en el Océano Atlántico. El colapso de la corriente provocaría un enfriamiento rápido en el Atlántico Norte, un calentamiento en el hemisferio sur y cambios extremos en las precipitaciones. El norte de Europa podría enfriarse 5,4 grados Fahrenheit en sólo una década.\nLos científicos pensaban que estos puntos de inflexión del clima estaban lejos de la realidad. Ahora parece más probable que sucedan, con menos tiempo para evitar que sucedan. “La ciencia más reciente nos dice con más confianza y más certeza que es más probable que sucedan estas cosas”, dice Helen Findlay, autora del informe y profesora y oceanógrafa biológica del Laboratorio Marino de Plymouth en Inglaterra.\n“Cuanto más tiempo registremos estas cosas y cuanto más tiempo podamos observarlas y comenzar a comprenderlas y monitorearlas, habrá más certeza en el sistema y comenzaremos a comprender realmente cómo funcionan estos puntos de inflexión”, continúa Findlay.\nEl estado de la nieve y el hielo de la Tierra\n44 científicos destacados escribieron una carta abierta a los líderes de los países nórdicos en la que afirmaban que el colapso de la AMOC seguía siendo “muy incierto”, pero hay evidencia de que el colapso está aumentando y que los riesgos se habían subestimado. Los cambios dramáticos en la AMOC probablemente conducirían a un clima extremo sin precedentes y amenazarían potencialmente la viabilidad de la agricultura en el noroeste de Europa.\nEl nuevo informe también saca a la luz el riesgo de colapso de la AMOC. Se proyecta que dos tercios del hielo glaciar en los Alpes europeos se perderán para 2050 si las emisiones globales de gases de efecto invernadero continúan en su rumbo actual. Se estima que 10 millones de personas corren el riesgo de inundaciones por desbordes glaciares en Islandia, Alaska y Asia.\nEstas inundaciones ya están ocurriendo. El agua de deshielo colapsa las presas de hielo e inunda rápidamente río abajo. Si las altas emisiones continúan, el nivel del mar podría subir 3 metros en el siglo XXI, arrasando ciudades costeras según los modelos.\n¿Y ahora qué?\nEl informe se publicó mientras los líderes mundiales se reunían en Bakú, Azerbaiyán, para la conferencia climática COP29 de la ONU. El grupo espera ganar la atención de los líderes mundiales con el informe. \"El sentido de urgencia no podría ser mayor. Hemos estado hablando de urgencia durante una década. Casi comienza a sentirse como una palabra inútil. ¿Qué es más que “urgente”? ¿“Catastrófico”? Se nos han acabado las formas de describirlo”, alega Julie Brigham-Grette, profesora de geociencias de la Universidad de Massachusetts Amherst y autora del nuevo informe.\nEl lunes (11) en Bakú, los líderes mundiales acordaron nuevas reglas para un mercado global para el comercio de créditos de carbono. El mundo está “en camino a la ruina” bajo las políticas climáticas actuales, dice el presidente de la COP29, Mukhtar Babyev, ministro de ecología y recursos naturales de Azerbaiyán desde 2018. Los autores comunicaron claramente el consenso científico, comenta Peter Neff, un glaciólogo y científico del clima que no participó en el nuevo informe: “Estos documentos pueden golpearte como una tonelada de ladrillos, y eso es intencional”.",

    "title": "Ryan Chesley scores crucial one-time blast to help lead Team USA to 4-3 shootout WJC win over Czechia",
    "text": "Washington Capitals defense prospect Ryan Chesley and the rest of Team USA were victorious today in a shootout thriller against Czechia. The 19-year-old rearguard notched his first point of the tournament in the 4-3 win, scoring an equalizing goal at the end of the second period. Chesley has been integral for the US on the team’s top defense pairing and was [named one of the squad’s alternate captains](https://russianmachineneverbreaks.com/2023/12/21/capitals-prospect-ryan-chesley-named-alternate-captain-of-team-usa-for-2024-world-junior-championship/) before the tournament’s kickoff. The US is undefeated through three Group B preliminary games with one more to come on Sunday. Chesley’s goal came 14:11 into the second period with the US down 3-2 to Czechia. The marker is his first at the U20 tournament after he recorded just one assist in seven games at last year’s event. An absolute bomb from Ryan Chelsey 💥 [#WorldJuniors] [pic.twitter.com/JEe8YPeIZo] — USA Hockey (@usahockey) [December 29, 2023] The strike was assisted by Chesley’s defense partner and high-scoring Montreal Canadiens prospect Lane Hutson. Hutson started the play by passing the puck through traffic from behind the Czech red line, perfectly setting up Chesley for a big one-time blast that whizzed past goaltender Michael Hrabal. The Minnesota native played 24:58 of total ice time in the win, second most among US players to just Hutson (26:16) and third-most overall in the game. Chesley, the Capitals’ 2022 second-round draft selection, is amid his sophomore season at the University of Minnesota, where he was one of four Gophers to be selected to Team USA’s preliminary roster. Joining them in Sweden for the tournament is coach Steve Miller, who is an assistant coach for the States. In the NCAA this year, Chesley has two goals and four assists in 18 games. His goal on Friday made him the 49th Minnesota hockey player to score in a World Juniors Tournament, and only the 14th defender to do so. GAME. OVER. 🇺🇸 [#WorldJuniors]| [@WinmarkResale] [pic.twitter.com/PfF63dUEGQ] — USA Hockey (@usahockey) [December 29, 2023] Chesley was not the only Capitals prospect to contribute to the US’ win as Ryan Leonard added an assist on Will Smith’s goal early in the second period. Leonard combined with his two Boston College linemates Gabe Perreault and Smith to tie the game 2-2 halfway through the contest. The point keeps Leonard producing at a point-per-game rate through three games of the tournament. The 18-year-old winger later got an attempt in the shootout but was denied a real chance at scoring by an unfortunate puck bobble. The feed from Lenny The finish from Smith 👌 [#WorldJuniors] [pic.twitter.com/Z9tOyBBvXi] — USA Hockey (@usahockey) [December 29, 2023] Isaac Howard eventually put the nail in the coffin for Czechia, seven rounds into the duel. Team USA will take the ice again for the last time in preliminary round action in a New Year’s Eve battle against an also undefeated Slovakian team to determine the champion of Group B.
