    "text": "Protesters attempt to block aid into Gaza, demand release of hostages Protesters in Israel are attempting to prevent humanitarian aid from entering into Gaza as they demand the immediate release of the more than 100 hostages that have been held captive by Hamas since the Oct. 7 terrorist attack on Israel.Dozens of demonstrators gathered Wednesday at Israel's Ashdod Port in attempt to block trucks from transporting goods and supplies for Palestinians into the Gaza Strip. Footage from the scene showed protesters harassing truck drivers, while others held signs that read \"no aid for terrorists.\"As part of a temporary cease-fire in November, Israel agreed to allow up to 200 trucks a day to transport aid and goods into Gaza in exchange for the release of 105 hostages held by Hamas. However, protests have erupted over the past week demanding that additional aid be withheld until all remaining hostages are set free.SEE MORE: Here's where things stand on a potential Israel-Hamas hostage dealThis comes as a coalition of negotiators from the United States and Middle Eastern countries is working to secure a temporary truce that would allow for more hostages to be released. In exchange, Israel would pull back military operation in Gaza for six weeks, while also releasing three Palestinian prisoners for every Israeli hostage set free. Senior Hamas officials met with Egyptian negotiators in Cairo Wednesday to discuss the details of the proposal specifically the timeline in which it could play out. Israeli officials have reportedly accepted parts of the proposal, in principle, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly vowed to continue war efforts until Israel achieves \"total victory\" over Hamas.With up to 80% of the Palestinian population in Gaza now displaced, the war is quickly becoming one of the world's worst humanitarian disasters. According to the United Nations, Israel's offensive in the region has forced as many as 1.8 million Palestinians to flee their homes. But overcrowded shelters, combined with the loss of basic health and sanitation necessities, is causing dire humanitarian concerns. Latest video",

    "text": "Pennsylvania U.S. Senator John Fetterman was driving at a high rate of speed before slamming into another car on I-70 in Maryland this past Sunday Night. USA Today requested and received the accident report from Maryland State Police. It shows Fetterman was driving at a rate of speed \"well over\" the posted 70 miles per hour according to another driver he passed on the highway. Fetterman was driving a Chevrolet Traverse when he slammed into the back of a Chevrolet Impala. Fetterman, his wife and the driver of the Impala were taken to the hospital. The Maryland State Police did not test the Senator for alcohol or substance use. No citations were issued. The investigation of the crash is continuing. Senator Fetterman has not commented on the contents of the police report. Do you think if you were driving there would have been no test for substance abuse? No citation for causing an accident with injuries?\nSource: USA Today\nSee the police report here\nPhoto: Nathan Howard / Getty Images News / Getty Images",

EatingWell's Editorial Guidelines Trending Videos Photo: Getty Images As you age, your brain health may be on top of mind—literally and figuratively. There’s a ton of research that supports how taking care of your body means taking care of your brain, as health conditions like low bone density, type 2 diabetes and heart disease can all contribute to cognitive decline. And most recently, the science is showing how certain lifestyle changes can also support your brain health. One new study shows that lifestyle factors are associated with young-onset dementia risk. Here’s what the research suggests. Eating More Protein May Reduce Heart Disease Risk, New Study Shows What the Study Found The study was published in JAMA Neurology on December 26, 2023 with 356,052 UK-based participants under the age of 65 with no dementia diagnosis. The research study examined each participant over the course of 15 years and detected predicted dementia risk factors from systematic reviews. Each person’s lifestyle habits were evaluated, and their risk for dementia was observed through their way of living. Through this study, lifestyle factors like physical activity, limited alcohol use, healthy diet, cognitive activity and social involvement were shown to help reduce the risk of young-onset dementia. On the flipside, alcohol use disorder, smoking, social isolation and vitamin D deficiency could all contribute to early dementia risk. A key point to consider is that most of the 15 factors identified in this study that impact one’s dementia risk can be controlled. 5 Sneaky Signs You Might Have a Vitamin D Deficiency While more research needs to be done to say these lifestyle factors will for certain increase or decrease your risk, this study is a stepping stone for understanding how our everyday habits directly affect our brains overtime. The Bottom Line There are several factors that are hard or even impossible to control when regarding dementia risk, including genetics and socioeconomic status, but promoting a healthy eating pattern and lifestyle can help support your brain health.

    "title": "Minimum wage: FCT workers begin indefinite strike Sunday",
    "text": "The Federal Capital Territory Council of the Nigeria Labour Congress has directed workers in the six area councils of the FCT to embark on an indefinite strike on December 1, 2024, until further directives are issued. This was contained in a letter obtained by our correspondent on Saturday and signed by the Chairman of the FCT Council of the NLC, Stephen Knabayi. Recall that the NLC had directed workers in 14 states and the FCT to embark on an industrial action from Sunday, December 1, over the non-implementation of the N70,000 new minimum wage. In his letter, Knabayi faulted the failure of the Area Council Chairmen to respond to the demand for the implementation of the N70,000 minimum wage despite receiving a communique of the National Executive Council of the NLC, issued to the Council Chairmen on November 14, 2024. He added that the non-implementation of the minimum wage was a “gross violation of the law”, and represented a total disregard for the welfare of workers in the Area Councils. The FCT Council Chairman said the State Administrative Council resolved to comply with the national directive, noting also the delay in paying workers’ entitlements in the FCT, including the outstanding arrears of primary school teachers in the respective Area Councils. The letter read, “On 14/11/2024, the Area Council Chairmen in the Federal Capital Territory were issued a communique of the National Executive Council meeting of the Nigeria Labour Congress held in Port Harcourt, Rivers State on Friday 8/11/2024”. “Unfortunately, the Council Chairmen have blatantly refused to respond to the demand for implementation of the new national minimum wage to the workers in their respective area councils. Failure to implement the new national minimum wage is a gross violation of the law and a total disregard for the welfare and well-being of the workers in the Area Councils. “In response to this inaction, the Organised Labour in its State Administrative Council (SEC) Meeting held 12/11/2024, unanimously resolved to adhere strictly to the national directive to embark on an indefinite strike action should any government fail to implement the N70,000.00 (Seventy Thousand Naira) national minimum wage on or before the last day November 2024. “The SEC also noted with deep frustration the persistent delay and outright refusal by the Area Councils to pay some pending entitlements to the workers including the outstanding arrears of the primary school teachers in their respective Area Councils. Therefore, all the workers in the Six-Area Councils in FCT are hereby issued a marching order without hesitation to proceed on an indefinite strike action beginning from the 1st day of December 2024 until further directives are issued.”",
