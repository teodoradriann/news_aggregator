    "text": "El concurso de belenes que organiza el Ayuntamiento de Mairena del Alcor, en Sevilla, ha sido declarado desierto en la categoría de asociaciones o grupos ante la sospecha de que una de las entidades participantes haya obtenido votos de manera fraudulenta entre usuarios asiáticos de Facebook. “Se declara desierto debido a las dudas en el sistema de designación del ganador, entendiéndose que se ha desvariado el objeto del concurso. De todas formas, se entregará placa de agradecimiento a todos los grupos participantes”, indicó en su perfil de Facebook el Consistorio del municipio sevillano. Las protestas de varios usuarios de redes sociales municipales, donde se realizaban los votos para el concurso, dieron aviso del origen de los votos en apoyo al belén de la Hermandad de la Veracruz de esta localidad. Indicaban que aparecían nombres como los de Nguyën Däng Thy, Hoäng Thi Thão o Ngô Mai Thüy Dung mostraron su apoyo al belén, y así hasta más de 700 similares. Según han indicado desde el Ayuntamiento a la agencia EFE, tras ponerse en contacto con la hermandad se les ha indicado que desconocen quién puede ser la persona encargada de este asunto, por lo que se ha decidido entregar una placa a todos los participantes y dar por zanjado el concurso. El premio del concurso, una paletilla de jamón y una placa conmemorativa, se daba en función de los apoyos en Facebook en forma de “me gusta. El mairenero Manuel Jesús Vallejo sí ha recibido el premio que le acredita como el ganador a título individual.

    "text": "Yves Bissouma El jugador Yves Bissouma inhaló “gas de la risa” el pasado fin de semana, algo que no cayó bien en el Tottenham, por lo que el centrocampista marfileño se perderá el primer partido del equipo en la Premier League. - TE PUEDE INTERESAR: No luchó por el oro por pasarse 100 gramos en su peso; rechazan apelación El técnico Ange Postecoglou anunció el castigo y mencionó que esperan ayudarle al jugador a que se dé cuenta de que las decisiones que toma repercuten más allá de él. Yves Bissouma “Le hemos suspendido para el partido del lunes. La puerta está abierta para él y ojalá podamos ayudarle a darse cuenta de que las decisiones que toma repercuten más allá de él. Esperemos que le permita tomar mejores decisiones de cara al futuro”, dijo el técnico en conferencia de prensa. Por su parte, Yves Bissouma pidió disculpas, luego de que el pasado domingo publicara un video en Snapchat en el que se le ve inhalando un globo que se cree que contenía óxido nitroso, que es conocido como el “gas de la risa”. Yves Bissouma Después de que el video circulara en redes sociales, el Tottenham abrió una investigación interna en contra del exjugador del Lille y del Brighton, quien es titular habitual con los “Spurs”. En el Reino Unido, la posesión del óxido nitroso para uso recreativo constituye un delito desde 2023 y puede llevar a penas de prisión de hasta dos años. “Debe recuperar mi confianza y la del grupo”, agregó el técnico sobre la postura del jugador.

    "title": "Air Force Academy Highlights Transgender Officer At Leadership Summit",
    "text": "The United States Air Force Academy showcased a transgender-identifying activist and military service member who seeks to embed far-left gender ideology in the armed forces for a speech on leadership and inclusion. Lieutenant Colonel Bree Fram, an engineer with the United States Space Force and activist for transgenderism in the military, spoke at the National Character and Leadership Symposium, the theme of which was “Embrace Culture, Empower People.” The military official states that he is a co-leader of the Department of the Air Force LGBTQ+ Initiatives Team, which he says is “dedicated to eliminating barriers to LGBTQ+ military service in the Air and Space Force.” Fram was introduced at the Air Force Academy event as “one of the highest-ranking out transgender officers in the United States military” and a “featured speaker on leadership, diversity, and inclusion.” He is also an activist on behalf of transgenderism, previously serving as the president of SPARTA, “a non-profit that advocates and educates about transgender military service.” “Inclusion takes action, inclusion requires asking, inclusion requires understanding, and it is more work, it is a lot more work for a leader but I need you to be willing to do it,” Fram said to the crowd while wearing a patch on his uniform bearing a rainbow flag. “In the future, we are going to fight and win war with brain power, and if those brains happen to be in a trans body … you should want them serving alongside you. Because they might be the ones that revolutionize the way we fight in space, in cyber or in any other domain of war.” The speech comes as the Pentagon has promoted a leftwing agenda, asking for a whopping $114 million in fiscal year 2024 alone to fund diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts such as “unconscious bias diversity training,” and “training programs and diversity and inclusion initiatives,” a Daily Wire investigation revealed. The Air Force’s LGBT Initiatives Team , which Fram has helped lead, has also pushed leftwing ideology in the military, celebrating transgender day of visibility. The far-left ideological capture of America’s military coincides with an unprecedented recruiting crisis, with the Air Force, the Army, and the Navy all missing their recruiting goals in fiscal year 2023 and a particularly sharp decline in white recruits. Republican officials have warned that the politicization of the military could be alienating citizens who would otherwise consider joining the armed forces. But despite concerns that the far-left agenda might be dissuading potential recruits, Fram went on to ask those with leadership positions in the military to support leftwing agendas, showing a slide that says military members can “be allies by standing with and supporting marginalized communities … and advocates by speaking out and raising awareness on issues.” He also appeared to express concern over the potential reelection of former President Donald Trump. “While I don’t have a crystal ball, I can look out and say, ‘Well, either next year things will be great or I will be fighting for my ability to continue serving,'” Fram said. Fram has a history of pushing the transgender agenda in the military, arguing that inclusion is a matter of national security at a recent women’s empowerment conference. Trans Lt. Colonel suggests inclusion is a matter of national security. The world is laughing at us. [pic.twitter.com/rmjtLoSU89] — Libs of TikTok (@libsoftiktok) [December 31, 2023] He also spoke at a Department of Defense Pride event in 2022, where he was introduced as an “unwavering advocate for transgender service members” who “transitioned while in command position.” He explained that he taught a lesson on leadership to military officers, where he shared with them that he “was two days away from a 10-hour surgery to give me a new lease on life.” He also celebrated that a colleague of his changed official Air Force policy to allow service members to include their pronouns in their bio “including they/them for our non-binary service members.” “We must focus on … intentional inclusivity,” Fram said before adding, “For all of you out there, I ask you to set out your symbols of pride, share your pronouns in your email, particularly if you’re a person who doesn’t think they need to, initiate difficult conversations about racial and gender barriers, and share a bit of your vulnerability in a way that draws others in.” “Remember that we mark Pride not beginning with a celebration, but with a riot,” he said in the speech. “I’m not asking you to pick up your bricks, but I am asking you to pick up your ideas about how we can be a more inclusive service.” Lieutenant Colonel Bree Fram did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "title": "Australia's biggest coal-fired power station, Origin-owned Eraring, is 'driving up energy bills'",
    "text": "Australia's coal-fired power stations are unreliable and driving up electricity prices, according to a new report out today, on the eve of a federal election campaign in which the viability of keeping coal plants going longer will be a key focus. Australia's largest coal-fired power station is unreliable and driving up electricity prices, according to a new report that argues against the viability of keeping coal plants open beyond their scheduled closure dates.\nThe report from clean energy consultancy group Nexa Advisory questions the wisdom of a New South Wales government deal to extend the life of the Origin Energy-owned Eraring.\nLast year, the state's Labor government struck a deal with Origin to keep the 43-year-old coal plant open for an additional two years, until August 2027.\nEraring is the largest coal-fired power station in the country, supplying NSW with about a quarter of its electricity needs.\nUnder the agreement, the state government agreed to cover Origin's operational losses of up to $225 million a year from 2025.\nOrigin Energy has until the end of this month to opt into the underwriting deal for 2025-26.\nThe NSW government's move to extend the life of Eraring followed concerns that the state would struggle to keep the lights on, after Origin announced it would bring forward the plant's closure by seven years, to August 2025.\nEraring coal-fired power station at Lake Macquarie, 1.5 hours north of Sydney, is Australia's largest. ((Shuttershock: Harley Kingston))\nWhile Origin has said Eraring's operations will not be extended beyond April 2029, energy experts say that timeline leaves the door open to further taxpayer support, beyond the current deal that runs until 2027.\nNexa Advisory's report argues against further taxpayer assistance for Eraring, given the plant's \"unreliability\" due to frequent outages.\nNexa analysed the performance data of Eraring and found each of its four units had experienced about 6,000 hours, equivalent to two months, of downtime annually over the last four years and that these outages had affected the plant's availability when it was needed most.\n\"While there is variability across units each year, there has been a steady upward trend in overall downtime…\nRhiana Whitson",

    "text": "(CNN) -- Algunos padres están ocultando a sus hijos a las autoridades locales para evitar la evacuación obligatoria en la ciudad de Pokrovsk, en el oriente de Ucrania, en medio de advertencias de que las fuerzas rusas están avanzando rápidamente.\nLas comunidades de Pokrovsk y sus alrededores, en el este de Ucrania, están siendo instadas a huir en las próximas dos semanas ante el avance de las fuerzas rusas, que se produce a pesar de la propia incursión ucraniana en territorio ruso que tomó a Moscú por sorpresa.\nRusia avanza \"rápidamente\" hacia una ciudad clave de Ucrania a pesar del revés en Kursk\nEl jueves, Rusia insistió en que había frustrado otro intento ucraniano de penetrar en la región fronteriza de Briansk, mientras Ucrania sigue avanzando hacia la región de Kursk.\n\"No esperen. No mejorará, sólo empeorará. Márchense\". Esa fue la cruda advertencia del funcionario del gobierno local Yurii Tretiak, jefe de la administración militar de la ciudad de Myrnohrad, que ahora se encuentra a menos de 4,8 km de la línea del frente.\nLos menores con sus padres u otros representantes legales serán evacuados por la fuerza de ciertos distritos de la región ucraniana de Donetsk, incluido el distrito de Pokrovsk, según el ministerio ucraniano responsable de la reintegración de las regiones que anteriormente estaban bajo control ruso.\nPero Tretiak dijo que muchas personas siguen siendo reacias a marcharse, llegando incluso a esconder a sus hijos de las autoridades locales, lo que incita a la administración militar a realizar visitas domiciliarias.\n\"Tenemos casos en los que los padres esconden a sus hijos. Hoy (20 de agosto) tendremos una reunión con la Policía para discutir cómo trabajaremos con esas personas, cómo buscaremos a esos padres que esconden a los niños y dan información falsa de que los niños se fueron hace tiempo\", dijo, señalando que los peligros están aumentando y que algunas zonas de la ciudad sufren ataques diarios.\n\"Los que dudaban hace una semana se han decidido en su mayoría y se están marchando en masa\", dijo, señalando que para los residentes que aún no han evacuado, \"el argumento más común es 'no tengo adónde ir' o 'nadie me necesita'\".\nHay casi 59.000 residentes en toda la comunidad, que abarca la ciudad de Pokrovsk, el pueblo de Myrnohrad y 39 aldeas circundantes, según la administración militar de la ciudad de Pokrovsk. Alrededor de 600 a 700 personas han estado evacuando diariamente, dijo la administración.\n\"El enemigo avanza más rápido de lo esperado\", dijo Tretiak en una entrevista radiofónica el martes. \"Así que estamos intentando hacer todo lo posible para evacuar a la gente antes de que acabe la semana\".\nAunque Pokrovsk no es una de las ciudades más grandes de Ucrania, unas 60.000 personas vivían allí antes de la guerra y muchas se han marchado desde el inicio de la invasión a gran escala, sirve como centro clave para el ejército ucraniano gracias a su fácil acceso a Kostiantynivka, otro centro militar.\nLas fuerzas ucranianas utilizan la carretera que conecta ambos para reabastecer las líneas del frente y evacuar a las bajas hacia Dnipro.\nRestos de un edificio residencial destruido por los bombardeos rusos el 11 de agosto en Myrnohrad, Ucrania.

Las fuerzas ucranianas repelieron 11 ataques, los combates continúan en cuatro localidades\", dijeron las Fuerzas Armadas de Ucrania en la última actualización.\nMientras las comunidades de Pokrovsk y sus alrededores siguen bajo el fuego, el Ministerio de Defensa de Rusia afirmó el jueves que las fuerzas rusas han ocupado el pueblo ucraniano oriental de Mezhove como parte de su ofensiva en curso en la zona.\nRusia afirma que evitó un ataque de drones ucranianos en la región de Moscú\nEl ministerio afirmó que unidades del grupo Centro de las fuerzas armadas rusas tomaron el control de Mezhove, en la región de Donetsk anexada ilegalmente por Rusia. El ejército ucraniano no ha hecho comentarios sobre la situación en el pueblo.\nEl presidente de Ucrania, Volodymyr Zelensky, declaró el miércoles que se están reforzando las fuerzas ucranianas en la región oriental para repeler un posible avance ruso.\nEn su discurso nocturno, Zelensky dijo: \"La línea del frente es nuestra posición, en primer lugar la dirección de Pokrovsk, nuestra región de Donetsk. Entendemos los movimientos del enemigo y nos estamos reforzando\".\nMédicos del ejército ucraniano atienden a soldados heridos en un punto de estabilización en la dirección de Pokrovsk.

    "text": "BUFFALO, N.Y. (WKBW) — A breakthrough in medical technology is unfolding right here in our backyard. Garwood Medical says it invented a solution for people who experience potentially fatal infections after implant surgery. Researchers hope BioPrax can address a serious, unmet need for patients. Doctors say it can treat infections without the need to remove the implant. \"We use low levels of voltage-controlled stimulation to eradicate bacteria from the surface of an implant,\" Doctor Mary Canty, Director of Research at Garwood explained. \"The treatment itself works on oxygen and water reduction which effectively increases the Ph so it becomes more basic so think about like lemons and limes...the complete opposite of that, so in that basic environment the bacteria can no longer live.\" According to researchers, more than 40,000 people who get a knee or hip implant each year develop an infection and one in five people with a knee-implant infection do not survive. Doctors say once an infection is identified they have to cut the person back open, remove the implant, and put in a cement spacer. The hope is to then put in a new implant, but the reinfection rate is 35 percent. That's why doctors say BioPrax is so important and now with a large investment the approval process could happen fast. The FDA designated it a breakthrough device because it addresses a serious unmet clinical need. The President and CEO of Garwood Medical says BioPrax is a minimally invasive therapy to treat the infection, with the goal of having the patient keep the original implant. The device was developed by the University of Buffalo in collaboration with Syracuse University and now has the support of an $8 billion Japanese company called Teijin. Doctors say right now BioPrax is in the animal testing phase and later this year they hope to start with human trials. Once approved it could create more jobs in Buffalo and there could be a large production facility.",
