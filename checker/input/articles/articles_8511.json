    "text": "Customer's photo of forlorn owner in empty restaurant leads business to boom at OK diner Nick Chappell had never been to Spirals Hot Dogs & More before he took a photo of Scott Hosek in his empty restaurant. But after business boomed, Chappell's part of the Spirals family, Hosek says. [Anthony Robledo](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7612431001/anthony-robledo/) An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Hosek standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Hosek would soon have no time to stand around as \" [Spirals: Hot Dogs & More](https://spiralshotdogs.com/),\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Hosek told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Hosek found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Hosek said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Hosek wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': [See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her](/story/life/humankind/2023/12/26/dolly-parton-meets-longtime-fan/72033945007/) Customer knew he had to capture 'wholesome moment' Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance. Noticing Hosek gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\" \"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Hosek waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Owner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Hosek is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Hosek said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Hosek added.",

    "text": "Puerto Príncipe, 1 feb (EFE).- La violencia experimentó un aumento del 8 % en Haití entre octubre y diciembre de 2023 respecto al trimestre anterior, para alcanzar un total de más de 8.400 víctimas desde enero de ese año, informó este jueves el Departamento de Derechos Humanos de la Oficina Integrada de Naciones Unidas en Haití (Binuh). La expansión de la violencia por parte de grupos criminales se produjo particularmente en el departamento de [Artibonite ](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departamento_Artibonito)y en la periferia sur de la capital, con un aumento de la violencia sexual en varios municipios, según el último informe trimestral de la organización. La representante especial del secretario general de la ONU y jefa de la Binuh, María Isabel Salvador, enfatizó que esta violencia conduce a una inseguridad crónica, amenazando la estabilidad y el bienestar de los ciudadanos. El documento también revela el impacto en los niños, con al menos 53 menores víctimas de violencia o involucrados en actividades criminales, y destaca los obstáculos existentes para entregar ayuda humanitaria o para desplazarse en vehículos debido al control de las carreteras por parte de las pandillas armadas. Por otra parte, el texto señala que el sistema judicial, afectado por la violencia y problemas estructurales, muestra algunos signos de mejora con medidas para reducir la prisión preventiva durante este período, en el que se procesaron 400 casos que resultaron en la liberación de al menos 258 personas. Sin embargo, las operaciones policiales han visto un aumento de víctimas, lo que pone de relieve la persistente inseguridad, de acuerdo con un comunicado de la ONU. Ante esta situación, el informe llama a la comunidad internacional a mantener a [Haití ](https://www.elcaribe.com.do/panorama/internacionales/con-menos-apoyo-concluyo-tercer-dia-de-huelga-en-haiti/)en la agenda y respalda la importancia de desplegar una misión multinacional de apoyo a la seguridad, que estaría liderada por Kenia y en la que participarían fuerzas de Bahamas, Antigua, Barbuda y Jamaica, aunque su entrada en acción se mantiene en suspenso. La nota resalta el compromiso y la determinación de los Estados miembros de [Naciones Unidas ](https://www.un.org/es/)para enviar una fuerza internacional a Haití, tal y como solicitara el primer ministro haitiano, Ariel Henry, en octubre de 2022, sin que se haya establecido una fecha y un plan concreto de actuación para pacificar el país caribeño.

    "text": "“Gesù, portiamo anche noi delle croci, a volte molto pesanti: una malattia, un incidente, la morte di una persona cara, una delusione affettiva, un figlio che si è perso, il lavoro che manca, una ferita interiore che non guarisce, il fallimento di un progetto, l’ennesima attesa andata a vuoto…”. E’ la meditazione del Papa sulla seconda stazione della Via Crucis, che presiederà stasera al Colosseo. “Gesù, come si fa a pregare lì?”, la domanda di Francesco: “Come fare quando mi sento schiacciato dalla vita, quando un peso mi grava sul cuore, quando sono sotto pressione e non ho più la forza di reagire?”. “Venite a me, voi tutti che siete stanchi e oppressi, e io vi darò ristoro”, la risposta e la proposta di Gesù: “Venire a te; io, invece, mi chiudo in me: rimugino, rivango, mi piango addosso, sprofondo nel vittimismo, campione di negatività. Venite a me: dircelo non è bastato e allora ecco che ci vieni incontro e ti carichi sulle spalle la nostra croce, per togliercene il peso. Tu questo desideri: che gettiamo in te fatiche e affanni, perché vuoi che ci sentiamo liberi e amati in te”. “Grazie, Gesù”, l’omaggio del Papa: “Unisco la mia croce alla tua, ti porto la mia stanchezza e le mie miserie, getto in te ogni peso del cuore”. Infine la preghiera: “Io vengo a te, Signore. Con la mia storia Io vengo a te, Signore. Con le mie fatiche Io vengo a te, Signore. Con i miei limiti e le mie fragilità io vengo a te, Signore. Con le mie paure Io vengo a te, Signore. Riponendo ogni fiducia nel tuo amore Io vengo a te, Signore”.",

    "text": "After bouts of wild weather over Christmas, the east coast will face another round of severe thunderstorms and rain according to the Bureau of Meteorology's (BoM) latest forecast. Severe thunderstorms have eased across eastern Australia but are expected to redevelop around eastern Queensland and northeast NSW from December 30 into the New Year. Parts of Australia are set to face wet and potentially wild weather on New Years Eve and New Year's Day. BoM senior meteorologist Sarah Scully said isolated thunderstorms are possible for parts of Queensland, NSW, Victoria and South Australia. \"Severe thunderstorms are possible in Queensland between St Lawrence and Redcliffe, although activity will not be as widespread compared to previous days,\" Ms Scully said. \"Isolated gusty thunderstorms are also possible over western South Australia.\" Showers and storms are possible across parts of southern and eastern Australia, mainly NSW, eastern South Australia, and northern Victoria on December 29. There is a risk of severe thunderstorms in Sydney, the Blue Mountains and the Hunter regions. Severe thunderstorms will become more widespread from this weekend concentrating in north-east NSW, and south-east and central Queensland. BoM said there are indications that isolated, very dangerous thunderstorms with destructive winds, giant hail and intense rainfall may be possible across southeast Queensland on Saturday. BoM has encouraged the community to stay up to date with the latest forecasts and warnings using the BOM Weather app and website. Queensland will also experience heatwave conditions along the east coast affecting Brisbane, the Sunshine Coast and areas surrounding Cairns. Northern and Western Australia will also face heatwave conditions with temperatures reaching the mid to high 40 degree Celsius in some areas. Sign up for our newsletter to stay up to date.

L'inizio dei match in programma, tra cui il derby italiano tra Sinner e Vavassori, è stato ritardato di almeno un'ora rispetto al programma previsto. Il maltempo ha causato il rinvio del derby italiano tra Jannik Sinner e Andrea Vavassori. Questo è il primo scontro diretto tra i due tennisti. Sinner, testa di serie numero 2 del torneo, arriva in Florida dopo una prestazione non al massimo a Indian Wells, ma è pronto a difendere la finale della passata stagione. Non solo il derby italiano è stato rinviato, ma anche gli incontri di altri tennisti italiani come Flavio Cobolli, Matteo Arnaldi, Jasmine Paolini e Camila Giorgi. La pioggia ha infatti interrotto tutti i match in programma, compreso quello di Jasmine Paolini che doveva iniziare alle 16. Al momento, nessuno è sceso in campo e la situazione meteo continua a essere monitorata. In questo articolo vi forniremo tutti gli aggiornamenti dettagliati sulle condizioni meteo e su come queste potrebbero influenzare il programma dei match. Dopo la vittoria dell'Italia di Luciano Spalletti contro il Venezuela, è tempo per Jannik Sinner di tornare in azione. Nonostante non si senta al 100%, Sinner è tranquillo e pronto per il suo debutto nel Masters 1000 di Miami.",

    "text": "By Cherie Dupuis ,\n4 hours ago\nI am at my grandparents’ farm and Grandpa is returning home from the field for dinner. He carries a box with small rabbits. Apparently the mother rabbit died from a threshing machine accident and Grandpa found these orphans. I am 9 years old and eager to take on the challenge of keeping them alive. The small wiggling creatures are so full of life. I imagine them growing up and returning to the wild and having families of their own all because of my intervention. I stuff a box with rags to make a cozy nest. I use an eye dropper to feed them milk. The rabbits are just the size of my hands. They are soft, cuddly and mine. My charges. I stand taller caring for them, and I sense that my family is impressed. But over the next few days, they die. I did all I could think of to care for their physical needs. But despite my attention, they die and I am devastated. I wanted to do something so right. How could my efforts not be rewarded? My family tells me that it is hard to save wild creatures and I accept that for now. But deep inside I sense that there must be a way.\nWhen I was 11, my mother took to her bed with an illness. I didn’t know what was wrong but a friendly gray-haired doctor made a house call and noticed me waiting on my mother, stroking her hair, bringing her water. “You’re quite the little healer, aren’t you?” He didn’t know how his carelessly tossed-off words affected me. That little seed planted when caring for the rabbits took root. This man who was a professional healer, and an adult with much experience, called me a healer. I tucked away his comment and continued to look for the secret of healing.\nIn my teen years I delighted in those books about medicine women who knew how to mix the proper blend of wild plants to calm a symptom. I loosely memorized the plants but sensed that there was a mystery in what the healer was doing that added to the plant’s natural healing power.\nIt is no surprise that I spent my professional life as a nurse. In nurses’ training I realized that in trying to help the rabbits, I had been concentrating on my performance and not getting inside of what a rabbit is in its wholeness, its wildness. I secretly began calling this healing place in humans the wildness in the person. I defined this wildness as a powerful drive for survival, a drive full of good instincts and passionate creativity. I spent my career discovering ways to activate this quality through careful listening and questioning. I was rewarded again and again with moments of deep intimacy as a person revealed and helped heal herself. Though I am retired now, I still find life alive with possibility as I seek out that quality of wholeness beneath the veneer that others frequently present.\nIt is said that a person spends so much of his life at work that one’s profession should bring joy and fulfillment. I reached that level of success with help from the lesson of the rabbits.\nCherie Dupuis is a member of the Jottings Group (jottings33@gmail.com) at The Lake Oswego Adult Community Center.",

    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Webster County, West Virginia from 1901-2000 was 31.6. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Webster County, West Virginia experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Webster County, West Virginia history.",
