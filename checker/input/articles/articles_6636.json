    "title": "Miami Dolphins WR Tyreek Hill Involved in Domestic Dispute That Brought Police",
    "text": "Another Tyreek Incident Amid Turbulent Offseason\nTyreek Hill again is making headlines — and for the wrong reasons.\nThe Miami Dolphins wide receiver was involved in a domestic dispute Monday at a condominium in the coastal town of Sunny Isles, according to an incident report.\nSunny Isles Beach Police Department responded following a report of an \"assault in progress\" just before 2 p.m. Wednesday.\nHill's mother-in-law, Alesia Vaccaro, called police after she said Hill threw his wife's computer on the floor, grabbed his 5-month-old daughter and started walking with her in his arms toward the balcony of their 35th-floor residence, according to the incident report.\nVaccaro has been living with Hill and his wife, Keeta, since the child was born in November and there have been frequent arguments. Keeta Hill told police that whenever she expresses her opinion \"about anything they discuss,\" Hill becomes angry and agitated and \"throws objects around.\" She said the two had been going to couples therapy but was in the process of filing for divorce.\nTyreek Hill said that on the day of the incident he returned from training and sat down to talk to his wife about their couples therapy sessions. He told police he did not like that she told him he was not involved enough with the daughter, according to the incident report, so he approached her, gabbed the baby and starting walking around the apartment. Hill told police, \"I have the same rights as a father as her as a mother, and I can take my baby whenever I want.\"\nBoth Hill and his wife told police the argument never became physical, even though officers noticed a bruise on Katee Hill's upper chest, which she said probably happened when he grabbed the baby from her.\nKeeta Hill declined to write a statement about the incident, and Tyreek left the residence in the presence of the officers a little less than an hour later.\nANOTHER HEADACHE WITH HILL\nThis latest incident is just the latest in a series of off-the-field episodes involving the uber-talented but controversial Dolphins wide receiver.\nIt also comes as speculation continued to run rampant that the Dolphins might have been entertaining the idea of trading him, essentially because of wariness over the headaches that come with his gifts.\nThis incident follows his highly publicized brief detainment by police before the 2024 season opener at Hard Rock Stadium, the lawsuit filed by the OnlyFans model, the paternity lawsuits by different women, along with more harmless, yet still aggravating incidents.\nNews of the incident, first reported by South Florida TV station WPLG, came on the same day former teammate Terron Armstead said on the Up & Adams Podcast that he believed Hill would remain with the Dolphins amid the trade speculation.\nThe trade speculation, of course, is the result of Hill's comments after the 2024 season finale against the New York Jets that included \"I'm out, bro.\" While he has walked back his comments since then, Hill also never misses an opportunity on social media to post the \"peace out\" two-finger emoji or make comments that could be interpreted as him wanting out.\nIf the Dolphins indeed were planning on trying to move Hill, the latest episode this week certainly isn't going to enhance his value on the trade market — if it doesn't kill it entirely.",

    "text": "Albergue en Harlingen abre un centro de calefacción para la comunidad Un refugio para desamparados en Harlingen está tratando de mantener a la gente en un ambiente cálido y para lograrlo abrieron una estación de calentamiento. El albergue 'Loaves And Fishes', localizado en el 514 S E St, Harlingen, abrirá sus puertas el lunes 15 de enero a partir de las 8 de la mañana para quienes necesiten un lugar cálido donde quedarse. El refugio ya ha recibido mensajes y llamadas de personas de la comunidad que quieren saber qué tipo de ayuda pueden recibir. De acuerdo a Víctor Rivera, director ejecutivo de 'Loaves & Fishes', el centro tiene una capacidad para más de 200 personas y cuentan con un comedor. \"Pueden venir a nuestro refugio. Si traen una manta, una almohada, agua y medicamentos, estaremos preparados. También tenemos catres listos\", dijo Rivera. Rivera agregó que la comida también estará disponible en su horario habitual y solicita a los asistentes que lleven una colcha, una almohada y sus medicinas.

    "text": "Simone Biles Nails NYC Winter Chic in Monochrome Chocolate Ensemble\nSimone Biles can stick a landing just as effortlessly as she can nail a winter ensemble, and her latest NYC look is proof. The history-making Olympic gymnast looked absolutely stunning and cozy as ever in her latest Instagram photo dump.\nWeâ€™re especially enamored with the cover snap, which deserved its spot at the front of the carousel. The 27-year-old opted for a monochromatic chocolate outfit, centered around the Fashion Nova â€œRule Breakerâ€� vest ($44.99). The belted faux leather number, complete with a shearling collar and pockets, radiated luxe wintery AprÃ©s Ski vibes. Styled over a matching warm brown long-sleeve top and tailored trousers, the look was elegant, comfy and polished.\nThe 30-time World Champion paired the outerwear with understated accessories including gold hoop earrings and a small fuzzy beige cross-body purse. She opted for a glowy glam look including long dramatic lashes, a flawless, chiseled base, mauve blush and glossy, plump taupe lips. In the following pic, she one-upped her previous look and donned a multicolored swirly striped floor-length oversized fur coat ($79.99), also from Fashion Nova. The two-time SI Swimsuit model wore the glamorous piece when she surprised TODAY host Hoda Kotb on her last day on the morning show.\nIn a later snap, the Texas native captured a cute front-camera selfie with husband Jonathan Owens, and in the following image, she took a mirror selfie as the couple, who got married in April 2023, dressed in formal attire. Biles donned a navy blue mock-neck fitted dress and the NFL player wore a crisp gray suit. In another slide, the duo were photographed courtside as the New York Knicks played the Oklahoma City Thunder at Madison Square Garden on Jan. 10.\nâ€œNY ğŸ��ğŸ—½ğŸš•,â€� the Athleta ambassador captioned the post shared with her 12.5 million Instagram followers.\nâ€œâ�¤ï¸�ğŸ«¶ğŸ�½,â€� Owens replied in the comments.\nâ€œLOVE LOVE LOVE that coat!!!!â€� one fan exclaimed.\nEarlier this month, Biles was named Sports Illustratedâ€™s Sportsperson of the Year. In her powerful cover story interview, she reflected on her historic return to gymnastics after a two-year hiatus. Biles, who was attempting one of the most dramatic comebacks in sports history, shared the mental and emotional challenges that came with it.\nâ€œThe hardest part of coming back was learning to trust myself again,â€� she explained.\nFamed for inventing countless gravity-defying skills, Biles acknowledged that this time, the challenge was perfecting something far more personal. â€œYou do feel forced [at times],â€� she revealed. â€œYou do feel like you have to accomplish something, and that has weight that you carry, and nobody realizes that. Itâ€™s hard and itâ€™s not always fun. So we have to really remember why weâ€™re doing it, who weâ€™re doing it for, and if this is really an enjoyable experience that we can look back on in a couple years [and have no regrets].â€�\nAs for the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, Biles hasnâ€™t made any decisions yet. Sheâ€™s taking things day by day, listening to her body and focusing on her well-being. â€œThereâ€™s a lot to take into consideration, especially that weâ€™re so much older. You can just, like, have a great life, go get a job, and move onâ€� she shared.",
