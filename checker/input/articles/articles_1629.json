    "text": "Can Fish Eat Fries? A Deep Dive into Fishy Diets The short answer is no, fish should not eat fries . While a rogue fry might not immediately kill a fish, regularly feeding them fries is detrimental to their health. Fish have specific nutritional needs, and french fries simply don’t meet them. They are high in unhealthy fats, salt, and carbohydrates while lacking the essential vitamins, minerals, and proteins fish need to thrive. Think of it like feeding a human exclusively candy bars – it might provide temporary energy, but it will lead to serious health problems in the long run.\nThe Problem with Fries: A Nutritional Nightmare for Fish Fries are primarily composed of potatoes, which are mostly starch. While some fish, like certain species of plecos, can benefit from small amounts of vegetables, the form and preparation of french fries are the issue. Here’s a breakdown of why fries are bad news for your aquatic friends:\nHigh in Unhealthy Fats: Fries are deep-fried, absorbing a significant amount of oil. This excessive fat can lead to fatty liver disease in fish, hindering their ability to properly metabolize nutrients. Excessive Salt Content: Fish are extremely sensitive to salt levels in their environment. While they need some minerals, fries contain far too much salt, which can disrupt their osmotic balance and lead to organ damage. Lack of Essential Nutrients: Fries offer virtually no vitamins, minerals, or proteins that fish need for growth, development, and immune function. They’re empty calories at best. Digestive Issues: The high starch content and processed nature of fries can be difficult for fish to digest, leading to bloating, constipation, and other digestive problems . Water Quality Degradation: Uneaten fries quickly decompose in the aquarium, releasing harmful ammonia and nitrates into the water. This can create a toxic environment for your fish, leading to illness and even death. Understanding Fish Dietary Needs Fish have diverse dietary needs based on their species. Some are herbivores (plant-eaters), some are carnivores (meat-eaters), and others are omnivores (eating both plants and meat). Providing a balanced diet tailored to the specific needs of your fish is crucial for their health and longevity. Commercial fish foods are formulated to meet these needs, offering a combination of proteins, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals.\nBefore offering any unconventional food to your fish, research their specific dietary requirements. Some fish might benefit from small amounts of blanched vegetables like zucchini or cucumber, but even these should be offered in moderation and as a supplement to their regular diet. Learn more about ecosystems with resources from The Environmental Literacy Council .\nWhat To Feed Your Fish Instead of Fries Instead of reaching for the french fries, opt for these healthy alternatives:\nHigh-Quality Flake or Pellet Food: Choose a food specifically formulated for your fish species. Frozen Foods: Brine shrimp, bloodworms, and daphnia are excellent sources of protein and essential nutrients. Thaw them before feeding. Live Foods: Offer a variety of live foods like blackworms, mosquito larvae, or fruit flies (depending on the fish) for a stimulating and nutritious meal. Blanched Vegetables: Some fish enjoy blanched vegetables like zucchini, spinach, or cucumber. Offer them in small quantities and remove any uneaten portions after a few hours. Repashy Gel Food: These gel foods offer a balanced and nutritious diet and are easy to prepare. FAQs: French Fries and Fish 1. Will fish eat french fries? Yes, some fish will eat french fries if offered. However, just because they eat them doesn’t mean it’s good for them. Many fish are opportunistic feeders and will consume anything that seems edible.\n2. Do fish eat potatoes? Certain species of fish, particularly those that graze on algae, may benefit from small amounts of well-cooked potatoes. However, potatoes should never be fried or seasoned.\n3. Can catfish eat french fries? While some anglers use french fries as bait for catfish, it doesn’t mean they’re healthy for them. It’s best to avoid feeding catfish fries.\n4. Can I feed chips to my fish? No, chips are just as bad as fries. They are high in unhealthy fats, salt, and lack essential nutrients.\n5. What do fry eat if I can’t feed them? If you run out of fry-specific food, you can crush flake food into a fine powder or offer microworms. Baby brine shrimp are also an excellent option.\n6. What is a fish’s favorite food? This varies depending on the species. However, live and frozen foods are generally highly palatable and nutritious for many fish.\n7. Can I give my cat a McDonald’s fry? No, you should never feed your cat French fries. They are not a healthy choice and could make your cat feel unwell.\n8. Can fish eat rice? Yes, boiled rice can be a supplemental part of a fish’s diet. It should be soft, well-cooked, and broken down into tiny, manageable pieces.\n9. Can koi fish eat fries? No. Don’t feed koi fish anything high in carbohydrates.\n10. Can animals eat fries? Potatoes fried in oil, such as French fries or potato chips, or potatoes loaded up with butter or salt, are not healthy for pets.\n11. Can fish eat lettuce? Yes, romaine lettuce can be a good supplemental snack for fish.\n12. Will baby fish survive in my tank? Most adult fish will eat babies (fry) within a day or whenever they find them. You’ll have to move them if you wish them to survive and grow to adults.\n13. What can I feed my fish if I run out of food? In the aquarium, hobbyists can provide fresh vegetables like sliced zucchini, cucumber, romaine lettuce, sweet potato, peas, and spinach. These can be attached to the inside wall of the tank using specially designed clips.\n14. How do I know what kind of food my fish needs? Research the specific species of fish you own or plan to own. Understanding their natural diet and habitat will help you choose the appropriate food and provide a healthy environment.\n15. Where can I learn more about fish care and responsible aquarium keeping? Consult reputable online resources, aquarium supply stores, and local aquarium clubs for information and advice. The well being of fish is a reflection of enviroliteracy.org.\nConclusion: Happy Fish, Healthy Fish Ultimately, the best way to ensure the health and well-being of your fish is to provide them with a balanced diet that meets their specific nutritional needs. Avoid feeding them processed foods like french fries, and instead, opt for high-quality commercial fish food, live foods, and blanched vegetables in moderation. By making informed choices about your fish’s diet, you can help them thrive and enjoy a long and healthy life.",

    "text": "Summary\n- Call of Duty: Warzone players point out that exterior ascenders and vertical ziplines were not mentioned in the latest update for Verdansk in Season 3 Reloaded.\n- Some players are doubtful that the features will be added to Verdansk with the update on May 1.\n- Exterior ascenders and vertical ziplines were originally promised to come to Verdansk after the launch of Season 3 and before the Season 3 Reloaded update.\nCall of Duty: Warzone players have noticed that Season 3 Reloaded's Verdansk is missing rooftop ziplines and exterior ascenders that were available during Season 5 of the original Warzone. Ahead of the Season 3 Reloaded launch, many Call of Duty: Warzone players expected the ziplines and ascenders to be present, making traversal more streamlined on the map.\nOn April 2, the Call of Duty: Warzone Season 3 update brought a rebuilt version of Verdansk with new light adjustments, quality-of-life improvements, and features that are faithful, including Buy Stations, Points of Interest, Killstreaks, and Easter eggs. Elements from the original Warzone's later seasons were added as well, such as Metro Station entrances and other map changes. What's more, the Call of Duty: Warzone Season 3 update brought multiple modes, including 150-player Battle Royale and the new Battle Royale Casual mode, which supports up to 120 bots and 28 real players. On May 1, the Season 3 Reloaded update will bring some updates to the Verdansk map to bring it up to speed with the original iteration of the map.\nRelated\n'Never Gonna Beat This' Call of Duty: Warzone Player Pulls Off Ridiculous RPG Shot\nA Call of Duty: Warzone player is considering retiring their RPG after making a once-in-a-lifetime shot that stunned the community.\nAs pointed out by ModernWarzone on Twitter, the official Call of Duty: Warzone Season 3 Reloaded blog post did not mention exterior ascenders or vertical ziplines, implying that these features will not be available on the map when the mid-season update launches on May 1. Only interior ascenders were included, which means players can reach the top of a building by heading inside it. Near the start of Call of Duty: Warzone Season 3, the developers at Raven Software promised that exterior ascenders would be added sometime between launch and the mid-season update, and the lack of new information has players doubtful about the feature's inclusion.\nCall of Duty: Warzone Players Point Out that Verdansk is Still Missing Exterior Ascenders and Vertical Ziplines\nThis discovery has some players worried about Verdansk in Season 3 Reloaded, since exterior ascenders and vertical ziplines were available in the original Warzone. However, it has sparked some debates among players in the community on Twitter, since many fans are happy with the gameplay and pacing of the matches on Verdansk in Call of Duty: Warzone Season 3. Others are arguing that rooftop camping has become more common in Season 3, resulting in players wanting ascenders and ziplines to be added sooner rather than later.\nIn Season 3 Reloaded, the Verdansk Train Station will be open with multiple access points. Warzone players can also expect High Value Loot Zones and more contracts, including the Big Game Bounty Contract and Train Recon Contract. Rebirth Island's Triumph TF 250-X motorbike will also be added to Verdansk with the new update.\nYour comment has not been saved\nCall of Duty: Warzone\n-\nOpenCritic Reviews - Top Critic Avg: 80/100 Critics Rec: 78%\n- Released\n- March 10, 2020\n- ESRB\n- M for Mature: Blood and Gore, Strong Language, Suggestive Themes, Use of Drugs, Violence\n- Developer(s)\n-\nInfinity Ward,Raven Software - Publisher(s)\n-\nActivision - Engine\n- IW 8.0 & IW 9.0 (Warzone 2.0)",

    "title": "#26 Pasadle estos datos y gráficos a los partidarios de Javier Milei a ver si alguno tiene la poca vergüenza de decir que lo está haciendo bien en Argentina",
    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\nTodos esos gráficos ya los adelantó en su campaña, no son nada que no se supiera. Argentina tenía un modo de gestión con un déficit tan loco que para encauzarlo habría que hacer sacrificios. Se dijo de sobra, 2 décadas con la mayor pérdida de poder adquisitivo de todo occidente, se trataba de elegir seguir así o romper esa inercia pero con unos años malos.\nDe verdad, es ridículo. Argentina es el peor caso de gestión económica de este siglo, habría que ir a Venezuela o países del 3er mundo o a países en guerra para ver algo comparable. Es mucho canteo que el meneante medio no tenga ni puñeterísima idea de lo que ha estado pasando en Argentina los últimos 20-30 años, y de pronto para criticar a un rival ideológico medio foro se autoproclame catedrático en argentinología.\n[#5](c5#c-5) tb resulta un poco curioso que todos los defensores de Milei en meneame son expertos en argentinologia . O no?\n[#6](c6#c-6) A mí siempre me ha parecido un mamarracho. Pero es una consecuencia lógica de la Argentina desde los 90 hasta hoy.\nPonerse a hacer gráficos con un excel y echarse las manos a la cabeza es absurdo tras ni medio año de Milei, que además no es nada que no se supiera. Argentina es un país cuya economía daba para por lo menos una portada mensual en menéame desde antes de la creación del propio portal.\n[#5](c5#c-5) O sea que para combatir \"2 décadas con la mayor pérdida de poder adquisitivo de todo occidente\", se implementan medidas que profundizan esa pérdida de poder adquisitivo...\nY eso para tí y los que te votan positivo, tiene sentido...\nPues nada, deberías sentirte orgulloso de la cantidad de gente que no puede comprar medicamentos, de las clínicas oncológicas cerradas, del incremento de la pobreza, y miles de cosas más. Todas, también, dichas en campaña, verdad?\nDesde luego que lo está haciendo bien.\nDejar de subvencionar con cargo al déficit y la deuda la energía, el transporte etc tiene la consecuencia de que la inflación se dispara.\nYa caerá.\nMilei sólo está destapando las vergüenzas de la economía argentina, que hasta ahora era una farsa\nEn un año la inflación estará por los suelos y la economía lista para crecer sin apoyarse en la impresión de papeles\ncc\n[#1](c1#c-1) [#2](c2#c-2) [#3](c3#c-3) [#4](c4#c-4) [#5](c5#c-5)\nMe jode tener yo que defender al mongolo de Milei, pero vamos si quitas subsidios y desregulas sectores es seguro que pasaría lo que está pasando.\nOtro punto es el precio a pagar por ello y si estas medidas van a mejorar el país en el medio-largo plazo o lo van a mandar al abismo directamente reventando la cohesión social.\n[#4](c4#c-4) \"El interrogante que más insiste con respecto a la ultraderecha argentina se refiere a la adhesión que aun suscita en sectores amplios de la población.\nEn efecto, un gobierno que no gobierna, un grupo de funcionarios inconsistentes y crueles, una agrupación de políticos bizarros que parecen testimoniar de una mutación antropológica en el centro del neoliberalismo provocan en el mundo la pregunta crucial: porqué un experimento con un coste de dolor tan amplio para la sociedad argentina no solo es soportable sino que parece estar apoyado por una fe inquebrantable.\nResponder a esto exigiría un conjunto de lecturas que sepan al menos caracterizar en qué tiempo histórico vivimos y si somos contemporáneos de algo nuevo y distinto. Pero mas allá de la necesaria reflexión teórica y crítica con respecto a la tragedia que le toca vivir a la Argentina, la única posibilidad de responder a esta situación siniestra es no dejarse subyugar por la foto fija de las encuestas y los votos obtenidos.\nLas encuestas y el sistema de votación nunca logran captar ciertos momentos privilegiados de lo micropolítico y de su capilarización en el tejido social. El supuesto 50 por ciento de apoyo del que dispone el ultraderechista se puede volatilizar de un instante a otro, y entonces puede emerger la verdad del militante, la verdad del que no cede, y entrega su vida a la más inmediata de las urgencias: combatir el hambre. Ya sabemos de quién estamos hablando.\nEsta es la hora de quien no se deja obnubilar por el peso inerte de los números y abraza la verdadera causa, la verdadera razón por la que ha decidido entregar su vida a la justicia.\nFrente al nihilismo de las encuestas, la verdad incondicional de la justicia social; no importa lo que digan si alguien ha decidido no prestarles mas atención.\nEn cada hombre y en cada mujer, uno por uno, en donde vibre una sensibilidad por la justicia y por el otro, un nuevo lazo social, un nuevo amor va abriendo su camino. Los días de la nueva política estan por venir\".\n[#8](c8#c-8) Por la misma razon que todos los que se quejan de nuestros fachas politicos, jueces, periodistas, empresarios...siguen aqui y no se van a otros paises superdemocraticos.\n[#8](c8#c-8) joder pues es bastante evidente no?\n- Sesgo temporal => Una chica obesa empieza a hacer ejercicio/dieta. Prefieres acostarme con ella ahora o en 1 año cuando haya perdido la mitad de peso? Pues eso.\n- Que un pais sea mejor economicamente no quiere decir que nos tengamos que mudar. Si esa fuera la logica, toda España se habria mudado a Zurich.\nHacedle caso a Eduardo Garzón, que tiene la receta para solucionar lo de Argentina:\n⦁ Eduardo Garzón: \"Argentina no está limitada en términos financieros. Todos los pesos que se quieran crear, se pueden crear\"\n⦁ Eduardo Garzón: \"La solución al paro es teclear dinero\"\n⦁ Eduardo Garzón: \"El dinero es un invento y se puede crear sin límites\"\n⦁ Eduardo Garzón: \"El dinero lo crea y regula el sector público, por lo que éste no necesita recaudar impuestos para financiarse.\"\n⦁ Eduardo Garzón: \"Los ingresos de los funcionarios provienen del gasto del Estado, no de ningún impuesto.\"\n⦁ Eduardo Garzón: Como si llega al 250% del PIB,como en Japón y viven mejor que nosotros, mientras el BCE siga comprando bonos la deuda pública no debe preocupar\n[#9](c9#c-9) la verdad esque es un pieza, pero honestamente, prefiero atacar a los argumentos antes de a la persona.\nAparte, es de la poca gente de la izquierda que se sienta a debatir contra liberales. Eso se lo tengo que conceder.\n[#36](c36#c-36) La parte en la que dice que ciertas cicatrices económicas tardarán años en arreglarse aunque Milei se fuese mañana me imagino que no te la has leído. Ah, hostias, enero de 2024. Nada más.\n[#41](c41#c-41) eso ya se sabia. Estais demasiados ansiosos porque a argentina le vaya mal, y no le va a ir mal a medio plazo, tiempo al tiempo.\nllevo en meneame desde el 2007 (ya no tengo acceso a mi cuenta antigua) y en foros desde mediados de los 90, por si dan medallas de antiguedad, y por si vale para ganar algun argumento.\n[#48](c48#c-48) se iba?? pero dale tiempo!!! no ha pasado nada todavia.\nLa inflacion se iba a disparar despues de las medidas de milei, era obvio!!!:\nhttps://es-us.finanzas.yahoo.com/noticias/subir-inflaci%C3%B3n-bajarla-terapia-choque-122832348.html\nREPITO, ya se que quieres que milei y argentina se hundan, dale tiempo, incluso la libertad requiere tiempo para poder disfrutarla.\n[#2](c2#c-2) ay mi madre el mensaje.\nTodo eso que menciona en la noticia, LLEVA PASANDO EN ARGENTINA DURANTE TODA LA DECADA. Y ha sido especialmente agudo durante los ultimos años. Lo que esta diciendo el articulo esque durante los 6 meses de gobierno se esta siguiendo la tendencia . No shit Sherlock, si te parece se puede revertir totalmente una tendencia en menos de 2 dias con ademas todo el congreso en contra.\nDe verdad, yo he llegado a ver como echaban a Milei culpa de la inflacion DE DICIEMBRE. Esto es como si Sanchez entrara al poder un 10 de Diciembre y le echaramos la culpa de la bajada de empleo en Diciembre. Seria completamente absurdo.\nY ahora contrataco. Hay un plan (que Milei ya ha explicado), para acabar con la inflacion y disminuir el desempleo. El plan esta de sobra explicado pero no veo que nadie haya mirado ni entendido el plan.

    "text": "Suspendue dans le vide depuis le 17e étage: au procès P. Diddy, une témoin raconte la violence du producteur\nUne témoin au procès pour trafic sexuel de P. Diddy a soutenu mercredi devant le tribunal de New York que le magnat du hip-hop l'avait \"soulevée\" dans les airs depuis le 17e étage d'un édifice avant de la projeter contre des meubles, une agression physique qui l'a traumatisée.\nBryana Bongolan, une amie de longue date de Casandra Ventura, ex-copine de P. Diddy connue sous son nom de chanteuse \"Cassie\", a raconté que le fondateur du label Bad Boy Records l'avait un jour surprise par derrière, pour la soulever au-dessus d'un balcon tout en l'insultant.\n\"Il m'a soulevée et m'a suspendue à la rampe\" pendant 10 à 15 secondes en criant sans cesse \"tu sais ce que tu as fait\", a-t-elle témoigné en disant ne pas comprendre ce que P. Diddy lui reprochait lors de cet incident survenu dans l'appartement de Cassie. Des photos du balcon et une image de ses contusions à l'issue de cet incident ont été présentées au jury.\nCette témoin a aussi raconté avoir vu P. Diddy lancer un couteau en direction de Cassie, qui l'aurait ensuite relancé vers le producteur.\nCette amie de Cassie a indiqué ne pas avoir contacté la police sur le coup, craignant la réaction du rappeur. \"J'avais simplement peur de Puff\", a-t-elle déclaré aux jurés réunis au tribunal criminel de Manhattan en employant l'un des nombreux surnoms du chanteur et producteur.\nDepuis près d'un mois, les jurés du tribunal fédéral de Manhattan ont vu défiler une série de témoins qui leur ont décrit l'emprise exercée par l'influent rappeur et producteur sur ses employés ou son ex-compagne.\n- \"Je crie dans mon sommeil\" -\nFigure incontournable du hip-hop pendant les trois dernières décennies, Sean Combs, dit P. Diddy, qui a aussi fait fortune dans la mode et les alcools, comparaît pour trafic à des fins d'exploitation sexuelle et entreprise criminelle.\nA 55 ans, il est accusé d'avoir forcé plusieurs femmes, dont Cassie, qui a déjà témoigné, à se livrer à des marathons sexuels avec des hommes prostitués. Selon l'accusation, les employés de P. Diddy devaient notamment se charger de livrer des drogues aux victimes pour qu'elles se soumettent et faire en sorte qu'elles se taisent.\nLe rappeur a plaidé non coupable. Sa défense concède des épisodes de violence sur Cassie, mais affirme qu'elle participait de son plein gré aux rapports sexuels avec d'autres hommes. Durant son témoignage, la chanteuse a assuré qu'elle n'avait pas le choix.\nUne dizaine de personnes ont porté plainte contre P. Diddy au civil ces dernières années, comme Bryana Bongolan, qui souhaite \"obtenir justice pour ce qui s'est produit sur le balcon\".\"Parfois, je crie dans mon sommeil\", a-t-elle déclaré aux jurés, disant souffrir d'un syndrome de stress post-traumatique.\nL'avocate de la défense, Nicole Westmoreland, a attaqué la crédibilité de Bryana Bongola en l'accusant de consommer énormément de drogues, ce qui aurait brouillé sa mémoire.\nLa défense l'a également accusée d'avoir coordonné sa plainte au civil avec celle, en novembre 2023, de Cassie, qui s'est soldée par un accord à l'amiable en moins de 24 heures. Les deux femmes se seraient alors entendues sur une même version des faits, a suggéré l'avocate.\n- 100.000 dollars -\nP. Diddy encourt la prison à vie s'il est reconnu coupable à l'issue de ce procès hyper-médiatisé.\nMardi, un garde de sécurité d'un hôtel de luxe a raconté avoir reçu 100.000 dollars dans un sac en papier brun de la part de P. Diddy en échange de l'enregistrement de caméras de surveillance le montrant en train traîner au sol Cassie et la rouer de coups, diffusé des années plus tard par la chaîne CNN et présenté au jury, .\nCet agent de sécurité, Eddy Garcia, a affirmé avoir refusé au début cette offre, avant de finalement l'accepter avec l'aval d'un de ses patrons, qui a pris un pourcentage de la transaction.\n\"Eddy, mon ange, je savais que tu pouvais aider. Je savais que tu pouvais le faire\", lui a ensuite dit P. Diddy, a-t-il témoigné devant le tribunal.",
