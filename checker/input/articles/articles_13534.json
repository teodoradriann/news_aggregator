    "text": "En un contexto en el cual, el Gobierno nacional ha optado por reducir los [subsidios](https://urgente24.com/subsidios-a2359) al suministro de energía eléctrica con el objetivo de mejorar la equidad entre las provincias, la población argentina se halla en una búsqueda febril de estrategias para optimizar sus hábitos de consumo. Y es allí, donde surge un cuestionamiento de gran relevancia: ¿existen [dispositivos](https://urgente24.com/dispositivos-a7015) que continúan consumiendo energía aun cuando se encuentran apagados? La respuesta es sí, y es precisamente en esta nota donde revelamos cuáles son. DATOS REVELADORES Los dispositivos que pueden aumentar el monto de tu factura ¡Atención! Algunos dispositivos no descansan realmente cuando los apagas. Descubre cuáles son y cómo puedes prevenir este gasto innecesario en tu casa. En un contexto en el cual, el Gobierno nacional ha optado por reducir los De acuerdo con una investigación llevada a cabo por el Departamento de Energía de los Estados Unidos, la cual analizó el gasto medio en vatios (W) de varios dispositivos, se identificaron tres artefactos como los principales consumidores, incluso cuando se encuentran en estado apagado, en espera o en modo stand by. Según las estadísticas proporcionadas por la Agencia Internacional de la Energía, los dispositivos eléctricos que se encuentran apagados o en modo de espera consumen, en promedio, aproximadamente 1.6 kilovatios al día en un hogar convencional. Este consumo representa una fracción significativa, oscilando entre el 5% y el 10%, del total de energía utilizado en el ámbito doméstico. En este sentido, lo que para ciertos individuos puede parecer razonable, para otros resulta completamente desconocido. Un ilustrativo caso de esto es la incidencia del consumo de [energía](https://urgente24.com/energia-a1085) de un dispositivo eléctrico apagado o en modo stand by, que tiende a ser más evidente durante las noches, momento en el cual el objeto no se encuentra en uso pero permanece conectado. En relación a este tema, el Ente Provincial Regulador de la Energía en Argentina denomina este fenómeno como \"corriente vampiro\" y sugiere la sencilla acción de desconectar los dispositivos eléctricos cuando no se encuentren en funcionamiento. Los artefactos que más energía consumen aun estando apagados - Decodificadores Estos dispositivos empleados en la prestación de servicios de televisión satelital o por cable conllevan variados niveles de consumo energético. Algunos de ellos brindan la capacidad de registrar programas, siendo esta función, según la investigación, la que requiere una mayor cantidad de energía. - Computadora portátil Aunque las laptops estén en estado de apagado, si permanecen conectadas a una fuente de energía, su consumo puede ascender a 8.9 vatios por hora. En el caso de la modalidad de hibernación, este gasto puede incrementarse hasta alcanzar los 15.7 vatios. - Computadora de escritorio En caso de que la computadora permanezca inactiva durante un periodo determinado, entrará de forma automática en un estado de hibernación, con un consumo estimado de 21.1 vatios. En este contexto, es importante destacar que la falta de uso no implica necesariamente la interrupción del consumo energético. Asimismo, existen otros dispositivos que generan gasto de energía. En este caso, el microondas en modo stand by también puede representar un inconveniente. Por ejemplo, la posición de su puerta, ya sea abierta o cerrada, puede marcar una notable disparidad, en caso de permanecer sin uso, pero con la puerta abierta, el consumo energético puede aumentar hasta 25 vatios por hora. Esta cifra representa un incremento significativo en comparación con los cuatro vatios que utiliza un microondas inactivo, con la puerta cerrada.",

    "title": "M'sian Star Hero Tai's Wife Was Angry He Made Her Fly Economy When She Was Pregnant",
    "text": "Back in 2023, Malaysian celeb Hero Tai was praised for flying his pregnant fiancée , Ukrainian model Tatiana Marchyshyna on Business class while he took Economy.\nAt that time, Tatiana wrote on Instagram that Hero had spent his \"limited budget\" on a Business class ticket for her after their doctor recommended pregnant women fly Business as it’s more comfortable.\nTatiana, 24, and Hero, 38, got married later that year and welcomed their daughter Karina, now one, in January 2024.\nNow that two years have passed, it appears that the story behind that incident was not as sweet and romantic as Tatiana made it sound back then.\nIn a recent episode of Taiwanese variety show Students Coming , Tatiana lamented that Hero is actually a very stingy person.\n\"I love to drink coffee and I have to drink about three cups a day. It happens that there is a cafe right below our house and I enjoy the atmosphere there. But he doesn't like it and would say I'm wasting money,\" she whined.\nHero went on to buy Tatiana a coffee machine so she could make her own coffee at home.\n\"But I can only make small cups of coffee because the bigger cups are too expensive and he would scold me,\" she said.\nIn response, Hero argued that Tatiana spends about TW$10K (S$411) on coffee every month, and that the coffee capsules he buys for her are three times cheaper.\n\"But she insists on going to the cafe. I told her to buy an Americano as it's the cheapest, but she'd go for the most expensive option,\" he shared.\nHero explained he's thrifty because he needs to provide for their family.\n\"When I was still single, I didn't understand the need to scrimp and save when buying tissue. Now that I have a family, all these need to be calculated carefully,\" he said.\nAccording to Hero, he once went to buy tissue and wet wipes for his child and pets, and that alone cost him TW$10K (S$411).\nNot convinced by what her husband said, Tatiana went on to complain about having to fly economy when she was pregnant.\n\"We were flying to Europe and I did remind him that I've never taken Economy before. He said okay. In the end when we boarded the plane, I realised we were seated at the last row of the Economy cabin,\" she said.\nShe lamented that her legs went numb during the flight and she ended up crying on the plane.\nIt was only on the return flight that Hero paid for a Business class seat for Tatiana while he continued taking Economy.\nHero, on the other hand, explained that he was trying to let Tatiana experience what flying Eonomy was like after she told him that she'd never taken it before.\n\"Plus the flight attendant gave us the seats that were meant for four people as [Tatiana] was pregnant. She could even lie down across our seats,\" he clarified.\nTatiana's response? \"I was pregnant with your child. If you have no money, why get me pregnant?\"\nUm, then what was with all the flexing two years ago?\nTatiana enjoying her business class seat two years ago Photos: Hero Tai/Instagram, Tatiana Marchyshyna/Instagram Hero Tai\nAdvertisement Advertisement Shopping Expand to read the full story Subscribe to the 8days weekly e-newsletter to receive the latest entertainment, celebrity, food and lifestyle news!\nBy clicking Subscribe, I consent to the Terms & Conditions.

    "title": "Princes William, Harry honor Princess Diana separately amid family drama - Good Morning America",
    "text": "Princes William and Harry appeared separately at an event on Thursday to honor their late mother Princess Diana and young people working to change the world.\nMarking the 25th anniversary of the Diana Award , William, the Prince of Wales, attended in person to give his speech and present The Legacy Award at the ceremony, which was held at the Science Museum in London, according to Kensington Palace.\nThe Diana Award was established in 1999 by the British government. The organization's website states that it was launched \\\"in memory of Diana, the late Princess of Wales, and her belief that young people have the power to change the world.\\\"\nAccording to a news release from the organization, the Legacy Award takes place every two years and \\\"is the most prestigious accolade a young person can receive for their social action or humanitarian work.\\\"\n\\\"The Legacy Award and Development Programme aspires to be the world's premier award and fellowship programme for the next generation of changemakers. Young people who are selflessly transforming their communities and society at large using innovative solutions,\\\" the Diana Award website states. \\\"The Award recognises these remarkable individuals under the age of 25 who confront adversity with boldness, tackling significant challenges with ground-breaking ideas poised to make global impact.\\\"\nTwenty Legacy Award recipients were chosen this year to receive the honor.\nIn his speech Thursday, William said this year's ceremony commemorating the 25th anniversary was \\\"particularly special.\\\"\n\\\"I know that she would have been honored to see a charity in her name doing such inspirational work to uplift young people from all corners of the globe,\\\" William said, referring to his late mother, who died in 1997. \\\"She taught me that everyone has the potential to give something back, that everyone in need deserves a supporting hand in life.\\\"\nWilliam noted that the legacy of the charity is something he and his wife Kate, the Princess of Wales, \\\"have sought to focus on through our work.\\\"\n\\\"I am incredibly proud to see this manifested in the amazing young people receiving the Legacy Award tonight,\\\" he added.\nHarry, the Duke of Sussex, joined virtually to speak with Diana Award recipients after William left.\n\\\"Thank you, very much, for inspiring so many others and at the same time protecting my mother’s legacy, I really appreciate that,\\\" Harry said, congratulating Diana Award CEO Tessy Ojo on choosing a \\\"fantastic group of individuals\\\" to receive the honor.\nThe decision for William and Harry to attend Thursday's event separately comes amid ongoing controversy surrounding the royal family.\nThe brothers have remained publicly distant in recent years, following a decision by Harry and his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, to step down from their roles as senior working royals and move to California in 2020, as well as the publication of Harry's memoir \\\"Spare\\\" in January last year, which among other things gave a detailed account of his rift with his family. Harry and Meghan currently reside in Montecito with their children Archie and Lilibet.\nSpeculation surrounding William's wife Kate has also grown in recent weeks as she has been completely out of the spotlight following a \\\"planned abdominal surgery\\\" in January. Kate's last official public appearance was on Christmas Day, and she is not expected to return to royal duties until later this spring.\nThe controversy snowballed earlier this month after the royal couple shared a photo on their official X account to mark Mother's Day in the U.K. Credit for the photo was issued to William.\nNot long after it was posted, the image, which featured Kate and the couple's three children, Princes George and Louis and Princess Charlotte, was retracted by global news agencies amid concerns it was \\\" manipulated .\\\"\nKate has since issued a rare public apology , admitting to editing the photo and writing that she was sorry for any \\\"confusion\\\" the photo caused.\nWilliam has not commented publicly on the photo.\nABC News' Zoe Magee contributed to this report.",

For example, with all the media hype on whether Joe Biden should seek re-election and questions about whether he is too old and is still capable of handling the responsibilities of the presidency, one of the strongest arguments in his favor has been his record of accomplishments in office. It is considerable. He brought inflation down and employment way up. He lowered prescription drug prices and capped the cost of insulin for seniors. He got wealthy corporations to pay their fair share of taxes and got legislation through Congress to combat gun violence. He actually made a major investment in rebuilding the nation's infrastructure, something that his opponent talked about a lot but never did anything about. He revived the American chip industry. He added a new nation to NATO and solidified America's alliances in the Pacific Rim. Oh yeah, the leading stock market indicators are at record highs. To which some nay-sayers reply: How do you know? There could be a cabinet of people running things on his behalf. Well, I sure hope so. The sign of a good leader, a good executive, a good president is having people around him capable of making his or her vision a reality. No president can do it alone. Whom he chooses to be part of his team and what the team accomplishes says a lot about the president. So by trying to take credit away from Biden by saying maybe a whole bunch of other people accomplished these things in his name, the critics are actually complimenting Biden for his vision, for choosing good people and for listening to what they have to say and helping them get it done. By comparison, many team members from Donald Trump's chaotic presidency have criticized him for his lack of understanding or caring about presidential responsibilities. Others are in prison. Possible members of a Trump team in 2025 have authored the notorious Project 2025, which explains in detail how they would dissemble American democracy in favor of an authoritarian Christian nation. Predictably, since details of that document have been made public and been widely criticized, Trump, whose name appears throughout the document, has disavowed it. That's because Trump, a convicted felon, has no agenda other than himself and power. If it's going to hurt his ratings, he tries to run away from it. He bragged about getting Roe v. Wade overturned by appointing Supreme Court justices who would do it. But when that decision met strong opposition, he tried to backtrack from that, too. He simply lies about everything and fires people who don't help feed his ego. Suffice to say, any team of folks behind the scenes doing things in Trump's name are going to do their best to make him happy. And he's already told us many times that what makes him happy is being treated special (absolute immunity!) and getting even with those who don't comply. The team wagging the dog for Trump will be ruthless and vicious because he will pick those who will do his bidding in order to further their own agenda. Not the nicest and not necessarily the best and brightest. He learned that from his first term in office. He knows more than all the generals. Sycophants and soldiers, that's what he wants. So, nay-sayers, do I want all those mysterious, intelligent, caring people behind the scenes making all those decisions for old, arthritic Joe Biden or do I want all those \"authoritarian, anti-democratic, rightwing Christian, post the 10 Commandments in every classroom, women's place is in the kitchen and pregnant, cut Social Security, arrest the homeless and leave billionaires alone, don't force us to be violent\" people making decisions for Donald Trump while he goes around the world like a reality show Don Quixote, jousting at windmills? Thanks, I'll stick with Joe's team. Bob Gaydos rjgaydos@gmail.com",

    "title": "Forever a Knight: UCF Trustee Joseph Conte Inducted into Knighthood | University of Central Florida News",
    "text": "UCF Trustee Joseph Conte was recently inducted into the Royal Order of Francis I of the House of Bourbon, an honor bestowed “upon worthy individuals regardless of nationality or creed who have contributed to public life, science, the arts, agriculture, and commerce,” according to the organization’s website. Conte, who received his undergraduate degree from Florida Atlantic University in south Florida and his graduate degree from the American University in Washington, D.C., is now officially a Knight. On Feb. 11, Conte, became a Knight of the European Order, sanctioned by the Vatican. Traditionally, the induction ceremonies are typically held in Rome, but this year, it was held in Naples, Florida, at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel for the nine U.S. recipients. Notable inductees from previous years include the late anti-apartheid and human rights activist Desmond Tutu and former U.K. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. When Conte and his wife, Lynn, learned of his nomination for the Knighthood, they researched it to fully understand the significance. The prestigious order was established in 1829 by the Royal House of Bourbon Two Sicilies. “Upon receiving the honor bestowed by HRH Prince Carlo of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, Duke of Castro, I was filled with profound gratitude,” Conte says. “Amidst the illustrious achievements of my fellow inductees and all historical Knights, this remarkable recognition holds an even deeper significance. Merely expressing gratitude feels inadequate in the face of such an esteemed group.” To be considered for the honor, each inductee must be nominated by a knight or dame, says Lynn Conte. Her husband’s nominator, unbeknownst to the couple, had been diligently taking notes of Joseph Conte’s life for quite some time to ensure he was worthy. The Contes learned of the nomination in October 2023. Conte’s public life includes his two, five-year appointments as one of 13 members of the UCF Board of Trustees, with the first made by Rick Scott, former Florida governor and current U.S. senator and the second by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. The latter term expires in 2025. The appointments were not Conte’s first foray into government. When he was in graduate school at American University in Washington, D.C., he was a research assistant for Sen. Sam Nunn. In the course of his work, Conte produced reports for Nunn detailing the state of healthcare for the elderly. “Sen. Nunn was an inspiration to Joe,” Lynn Conte says. After graduation, Conte got a job in Michigan working for a physician who conceptualized post-acute surgical rehabilitation for the elderly. He was not only bright, but also someone who could see the big picture. “He would regularly visit the facilities after hours to see if things were being done according to the rigorous federal standards,” Lynn Conte says. “He would never toot his own horn about this kind of thing, but that’s OK, I can do that for him because I’m so proud of him.” After gaining more experience, Conte co-founded Tandem Healthcare in 1998, which eventually evolved into Consulate Healthcare, which he sold in 2015. It didn’t take long after his “retirement” for him to be noticed as a potential UCF Trustee. UCF College of Medicine was just getting off the ground, and Dean Deborah German worked with Conte on various issues, including discussions centered around geriatric concerns and creating a generation of new physicians with sensitivity to those issues. Both felt this needed to be understood as our population is rapidly aging. “His ‘retirement’ became a much harder, unpaid job,” Lynn Conte says with a laugh. “Joe has always been very analytical, very fair, and is especially kind and generous, but you have to follow the rules.” In short, Conte is very good at separating a business decision from an emotional decision, Lynn says. When UCF President John C. Hitt retired in 2018, the university was going through a transitional time and Conte’s logical and realistic leadership was valuable. This was when DeSantis, the then incoming governor, beseeched Conte to stay on for an additional term. And all the while, John Salamone, a Knight of the European Order for 16 years, was watching. As an existing Knight, Salamone has the opportunity to nominate new Knights. Salamone, whom the Contes met years ago, is the president of Salamone Associates, a nonprofit fundraising organization. The Contes have, from time to time, made charitable donations, some of which were facilitated by Salamone Associates. At times, the Contes permit organizations to share the news of their gifts when it would help to inspire others to make a philanthropic investment, but much of their philanthropy, as Lynn Conte would describe, flies “under the radar.” “Sometimes,” Lynn Conte says, “We just do things. If Joe sees a need, and it’s something he can help with, he’ll do it. Things that are near and dear to our hearts. That’s what John Salamone noticed over the years.” The idea to do a good deed just because it’s the right thing is something Conte learned growing up from his parents, grandparents and great-grandparents. The Conte family — and extended family — helped with church-related activities, took food to people who needed it, kept an eye on all the neighborhood kids who didn’t have a place to go after school. These caring acts left a lasting impression on Joseph Conte. “His parents are very proud of him,” Lynn Conte says. “But they never accepted less than the best from him. He pushes himself now, and he has for all the years I’ve known him. He is very focused on what needs to be done, but not in a mean way.” When Joseph Conte found out that he was going to be accepted into the European Order, Lynn Conte says her humble husband was pleased. “I don’t think he ever realized that all the things he’s done over the years would ever come back to him,” Lynn Conte says. “I hope that whoever reads this article realizes that everyone can do something. You can’t always fix every problem, but you can at least try and help, and if it’s only one person you have helped try to succeed who has done so — then you have a success. And I think that’s really what Joe does so well.”",
