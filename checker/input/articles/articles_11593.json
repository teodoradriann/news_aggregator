On September 11, Vance appeared for an interview with the Shawn Ryan Show podcast expressed his views on a deal to resolve Russia-Ukraine conflict. “Ukraine retains its independent sovereignty, Russia gets the guarantee of neutrality from Ukraine—it doesn't join NATO, it doesn't join some of these allied institutions.” In retaliation, [Zelenskyy](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-news/joe-biden-speaks-with-zelenskyy-as-us-approves-125mn-in-new-military-aid-to-ukraine-101724466738513.html) declared during a trip to the United States this week: “The idea that the world should end this war at Ukraine's expense is unacceptable.” He blasted Vance, saying that he should study the events of the Second World War, in which a nation was compelled to cede a portion of its territory to one individual. “What did that man do? Was he appeased or did he deal a devastating blow to the continent of Europe—to many nations, broadly, and to the Jewish nation in particular? Let him do some reading.” Also Read: [Zelenskyy visits Washington as election year divide grows over Ukraine war](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-news/zelenskyy-visits-washington-as-election-year-divide-grows-over-ukraine-war-101727377779218.html) Vance hits back at Zelenskyy During Vance's campaign rally in Traverse City, Michigan on Wednesday, a reporter asked him to comment on Zelenskyy's statement. The Ohio Senator clarified that the deal he presented on the podcast was “one possible scenario” rather than “a plan.” He, however, added that he doesn't appreciate [Zelenskyy's](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/zelenskyys-fleece-jacket-sold-for-over-100-000-at-fundraiser-in-london-report-101652056806928.html) visit to the US and his instruction to the “American taxpayer what they oughta do.” Vance went on to suggest to the Ukrainian President that he should be grateful to the American taxpayers, in reference to US' financial and military aid to his nation. The Republican vice presidential candidate claimed in his speech in Traverse City that Trump will put a stop to the conflict in Ukraine “by not being weak and not being dumb, which is unfortunately not something you can say for the current administration.” He mentioned that Russia did not attack [Ukraine](https://www.hindustantimes.com/videos/world-news/zelensky-confirmed-to-lose-america-if-trump-wins-ukraine-prez-accused-of-kamala-bias-amid-us-trip-101727354212259.html) under Trump's tenure. However, Russia continues to invade their neighbors under the administrations of Democratic government because “they don't respect American leadership and because our leaders aren't smart.” Trump, who served as the US President from 2017 to 2021, has stated repeatedly that if he had been elected in 2020, he would have resolved the conflict in Ukraine “in 24 hours.” He has also reiterated that he would speak to Russian President Vladimir Putin to quickly end the conflict in Ukraine if he gets re-elected to the White House.

    "title": "Kathleen Wilson's Minnesota dentist did 30 procedures at once: lawsuit",
    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",
