    "title": "Galaxy Watch 7: model numbers revealed – Samsung is planning a big surprise",
    "text": "SAMSUNG GALAXY WATCH 7 March 25, 2024 at 3:13 p.m\nSamsung could release three variants of the Galaxy Watch 7 instead of the current two. This is what the leaked model numbers suggest. This is how the third model could differ.\nSamsung could release three model variants of the Galaxy Watch 7 instead of the current two. (Source: Samsung)\nSamsung is secretly working on a new generation of smartwatches and it could be bigger than any previous one. The South Korean manufacturer may present three new smartwatches in the coming months. Until now, each model generation consisted of a maximum of two models.\nThe usually well-informed fan blog SamMobile wants to find out about this. The model numbers of the next Galaxy Watch generation were leaked to this by unnamed sources. These are as follows: SM-L300/SM-L305, SM-L310/SM-L315 and SM-L700/SM-L705. The “5” at the end of a model number is intended to indicate the LTE variant, while the “0” stands for the Bluetooth version.\nGalaxy Watch 7 Pro, 7 Ultra or a square watch?\nAccording to SamMobile, it is still unclear what name the individual models will be called. We assume that the “SM-L300/SM-L305” model will be the Galaxy Watch 7 and the “SM-L310/SM-L315” model will be the Galaxy Watch 7 Classic. Finally, the similarity of the model numbers indicates that the watches are very similar. The regular and classic versions essentially only differ in appearance.\nSeveral names are conceivable for the third model. What seems most realistic to us is that Samsung is positioning the model as the successor to the Galaxy Watch 5 Pro. The South Korean manufacturer continues to sell these even after the Watch 6 is released, as the model with its long battery life is primarily aimed at outdoor fans and athletes. It would also be conceivable that Samsung would call the model the Galaxy Watch 7 Ultra in the future in order to participate in the success of the Apple Watch Ultra.\nRumors have recently been circulating that Samsung will once again offer smartwatches with a square housing instead of a round one. The third model may also set itself apart from the other Galaxy Watch models thanks to a different form factor.\n” Tip: The best VPN providers for more security and data protection » Buy balcony power plant: Comparison of the best solar systems Don’t miss anything with this NETWORK WORLD Newsletter\nEvery Friday: The most informative and entertaining summary from the world of technology!\nSource link -67",

    "title": "Bassitt says everyone to blame as Jays' shoddy season worsens with 13-0 loss to Rays",
    "text": "TORONTO — Chris Bassitt declared everyone in the Toronto Blue Jays organization should bear the blame for its shoddy season.\nBassitt (8-9) made his remarks after the Tampa Bay Rays (52-51) throttled the Blue Jays (46-56) 13-0 with 16 hits in the rubber match of their three-game series on Thursday.\n“I would say there’s not a single person in probably the whole organization who's not disappointed right now,\" Bassitt said.\n“It just sucks. I don’t think anyone thought this is what was going to happen.\n“I don’t think there’s one person with clean hands right now. I really don’t think we’ve done anything well this year. Well, maybe (Daulton) Varsho’s defence.\n“Besides Varsho’s defence, I don’t see how anyone can say ‘I’ve done what I should.'\"\nBassitt also remarked that the embarrassing loss was because the team has been fighting \"demons.\"\nWhat did he mean?\n“Everything that’s been going on,\" Bassitt said.\n\"It’s whatever it might be, giving up that many hits, not being able to hit and the trade deadline. Who’s going to be here, who’s not going to be here? There’s a million different things right now that are just not great.\"\nWith the trade deadline five days away, and the Blue Jays not meeting expectations of contending, the assumptions have been general manager Ross Atkins will sell off a handful of veteran players in exchange for prospects.\n“You have ideas of who’s not going to be around much longer and a lot of these people mean a lot to you so yeah, it’s not fun,\" Bassitt said.\nBassitt admitted he wasn't sharp before 41,148 at Rogers Centre. He departed after five innings down 3-0 after tossing 97 pitches, giving up five hits and a walk with six strikeouts.\nBut then reliever Trevor Richards entered and was worse. He only faced seven hitters, giving up four runs on four hits and two walks.\n“He’s been really good for us, especially earlier in the year,\" Blue Jays manager John Scheider said of Richards. \"But he doesn’t have a good feel for his change-up right now.\n\"When you have two pitches you have to be good with them. He doesn’t have his command right now and he’s falling behind (in the count).”\nTampa followed its four-run sixth inning by tacking on five more in the seventh.\nErnie Clement and his knuckleball had to be summoned from his third-base position to pitch the ninth and save the bullpen from further depletion. He gave up a run as the Rays pushed their hit total to 16.\nTaj Bradley (6-4) pitched six shutout innings and allowed only two hits, winning his third straight start.\nThe 23-year-old Bradley surrendered a one-out double to left from Spencer Horwitz and an infield hit to Vladimir Guerrero Jr. in the first inning.\nBut then the Rays righty settled down to retire 11 in a row and 17 of his final 18, allowing only a walk to Danny Jansen in the fifth. Bradley finished with seven strikeouts and a walk.\nBrandon Lowe, Isaac Paredes, Alex Jackson and Amed Rosario were the big offensive producers in the series finale before 41,148 at Rogers Centre.\nLowe sent a 414-foot homer into the fifth deck down the right-field line to open the scoring. He knocked in two more runs with four hits and also twice walked.\nParedes drove in four runs with two hits, while Jackson checked in with three RBI with two hits. Rosario pounded a double and two singles.\nON THE MEND\nBlue Jays utility infielder Isiah Kiner-Falefa (sprained left knee) could begin a rehab assignment with Triple-A Buffalo on Saturday, provided there are no setbacks, according to Schneider.\nKiner-Falefa has been out since July 1 and has enjoyed a solid season with a .292 average and .338 on-base percentage.\nON DECK\nThe Blue Jays begin a three-game set against the Texas Rangers on Friday to conclude their nine-outing, 10-day homestand. Toronto's Yusei Kikuchi (4-9) will open the series against lefty Andrew Heaney (4-10).\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published July 25, 2024.\nTim Wharnsby, The Canadian Press",

    "text": "El activista libio Al Moatassim Areebi ha sido liberado este jueves tan solo unos días después de su secuestro por parte de un grupo de hombres armados vestidos de civil en la ciudad de Misrata, en el noroeste del país, tras las denuncias de la Misión de Apoyo de Naciones Unidas en Libia (UNSMIL) como de las Embajadas de Estados Unidos y de Francia. El Departamento de Tareas Especiales de Libia ha confirmado que, tras las primeras investigaciones y una redada, los secuestradores decidieron liberar a Areebi, según un comunicado publicado en su cuenta de la red social X. De igual forma, ha advertido contra el aumento de los delitos de secuestro en los últimos días, y ha reafirmado su compromiso con la seguridad y la protección de los ciudadanos. Areebi, de 29 años, había sido secuestrado junto a un ciudadano identificado como Mohamed Shtewi, quien fue liberado tras recibir una paliza. La UNSMIL pidió la inmediata liberación del activista y una investigación al respecto. Además, la Misión informó sobre al menos 60 casos documentados de personas detenidas en Libia por su \"real o supuesta\" afiliación política, por lo que ha pedido la liberación \"inmediata e incondicional\" de todos ellos y que los responsables rindan cuentas.",

    "title": "NASA Researchers Discover New Types of Gamma-ray Emissions in Tropical Thunderstorms",
    "text": "Scientists have identified a previously unknown type of gamma-ray emission produced by storm clouds, shedding new light on the complex mechanisms that drive thunderstorms. Using advanced detectors aboard NASA aircraft, researchers recorded bursts of gamma radiation from tropical storm clouds, providing critical insights into these energetic processes.\nNew Gamma-ray Emissions Detected Gamma rays, known as the most energetic form of light, are typically associated with extreme cosmic phenomena like supernovae and black holes , but since the 1990s, researchers have discovered that these emissions also occur within Earth's atmosphere. Specifically, thunderstorms have been found to generate terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs) , which are brief but intense bursts of radiation lasting mere microseconds. While TGFs have been linked to lightning strikes, scientists had not fully understood the range of gamma-ray emissions produced by storm clouds.\nIn a groundbreaking development, NASA researchers, using advanced airborne instruments, have detected a new form of gamma-ray emission within storm clouds . These newly discovered emissions, termed \"flickering gamma-ray flashes,\" last between 50 and 200 milliseconds, a timespan that falls between the brief bursts of TGFs and the longer, steady glows of gamma rays previously observed. This discovery provides a crucial missing link in understanding how thunderstorms generate such high-energy emissions. As physicist Martino Marisaldi explained, \"They’re almost impossible to detect from space, but when you are flying at 20 kilometers [12.5 miles] high, you're so close that you will see them.\"\nThese flickering flashes reveal new aspects of storm cloud behavior that had eluded earlier detection methods. The insights gained from these observations could significantly advance the understanding of how thunderstorms produce radiation, particularly in relation to lightning formation. As Joseph Dwyer , a physicist at the University of New Hampshire, noted, \"They’re telling us something about how thunderstorms work, which is really important because thunderstorms produce lightning that hurts and kills a lot of people.\"\nAdvanced Aircraft Observations Reveal Abundant Gamma Activity This breakthrough was made possible through NASA 's ALOFT (Airborne Lightning Observatory for Fly’s Eye Geostationary Lightning Mapper Simulator and Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flashes) campaign, which utilized the ER-2 High-Altitude Aircraft . This specialized plane, a retrofitted version of the U2 spy plane , flew at an altitude of 20 kilometers (12.5 miles), allowing researchers to observe thunderstorms from just above the clouds where the gamma-ray emissions originate. Over the course of 10 flights in July 2023, the ER-2 flew over storm systems in the Caribbean and Central America , gathering an unprecedented amount of data on gamma radiation in storm clouds.\nThe research team initially hoped to observe a handful of terrestrial gamma-ray flashes , but the results far exceeded expectations. In total, the ER-2 detected over 130 gamma-ray flashes, a remarkable achievement that has provided scientists with a wealth of data. As Nikolai Østgaard , the lead investigator from the University of Bergen, remarked, \"I went to a meeting just before the ALOFT campaign. And they asked me: ‘How many TGFs are you going to see?’ I said: ‘Either we’ll see zero, or we’ll see a lot.’ And then we happened to see 130.\"\nThe sheer volume of detected flashes, combined with the discovery of flickering gamma-ray emissions, marks a significant step forward in understanding the energetic processes that take place within thunderstorms. These findings challenge previous assumptions about the frequency and nature of gamma-ray emissions from storm clouds and open new avenues for research into storm cloud dynamics. According to Timothy Lang , the study’s project scientist from NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center, \"If we had gotten one flash, we would have been ecstatic — and we got well over 100.\"\nImplications for Understanding Thunderstorms and Lightning The discovery of flickering gamma-ray flashes and the abundance of TGFs observed during the campaign highlight the complexity of thunderstorm dynamics . Thunderstorms are now understood to produce a continuous range of gamma radiation , from short, intense bursts to longer-lasting glows. These emissions are closely tied to the electric fields generated within storm clouds, which can reach staggering intensities, comparable to 100 million AA batteries stacked in a series. Within these fields, electrons are accelerated to high speeds, leading to nuclear reactions that produce gamma rays.\nWhat makes the new findings particularly exciting is that they may help unravel one of the most enduring mysteries of thunderstorms: how lightning forms. While TGFs have been linked to visible lightning strikes, the flickering gamma-ray flashes appear to occur independently of lightning, suggesting that they could be related to the processes that initiate lightning rather than the lightning itself. As Steve Cummer , a physicist at Duke University, put it, \"There is way more going on in thunderstorms than we ever imagined.\"\nThese discoveries could lead to more accurate lightning risk models , improving safety measures for aircraft , spacecraft , and people on the ground. Lightning is a major hazard during thunderstorms, responsible for numerous injuries and fatalities each year. By gaining a deeper understanding of the processes that generate both lightning and gamma radiation, researchers hope to develop better methods for predicting lightning strikes and mitigating their risks.\nGamma-ray Emissions in Tropical Thunderstorms The study also uncovered new details about how tropical thunderstorms differ from those at higher latitudes in terms of their gamma-ray emissions. According to the research, large tropical storms are far more dynamic than previously thought, continuously producing gamma radiation in multiple forms. As Martino Marisaldi explained, the gamma emissions from tropical thunderstorms resemble a \"boiling pot,\" with bursts of radiation occurring throughout the storm, rather than the more stationary emissions seen in other types of clouds.\nThe size and intensity of tropical thunderstorms contribute to their unique gamma-ray behavior. Given the vast scale of these storms, which are much larger than their temperate counterparts, the researchers estimate that more than half of all tropical thunderstorms generate gamma radiation. This low-level production of gamma rays may act as a release valve, preventing the buildup of energy that could lead to more extreme events like lightning strikes or TGFs.\nThe study’s findings have broad implications for the fields of meteorology and atmospheric science . By revealing the full extent of gamma radiation produced by thunderstorms, researchers are gaining new insights into the electrical processes that occur within storm systems. These discoveries challenge long-standing assumptions about how storms operate and open the door to further research into the interplay between radiation , lightning , and storm dynamics .\nUnraveling the Mysteries of Thunderstorms The discovery of flickering gamma-ray flashes and the detailed observations of tropical thunderstorms represent a major leap forward in understanding thunderstorm dynamics . These findings not only provide new insights into the processes that generate lightning and gamma radiation , but also suggest that thunderstorms are far more energetic and complex than previously imagined.\nAs researchers continue to analyze the data collected during the ALOFT campaign, further discoveries are expected. The combination of advanced airborne instruments and the unique vantage point provided by the ER-2 aircraft has given scientists an unprecedented look into the inner workings of storm clouds, revealing the intricate mechanisms that drive some of the most powerful weather phenomena on Earth.",

    "text": "Tal mãe, tal filha! Taís Araujo celebra o aniversário da filha, Maria Antônia, com vídeo especial e a semelhança delas rouba a cena\nA atriz Taís Araujo está em festa nesta quinta-feira, 23, por causa do aniversário de sua filha caçula, Maria Antônia, fruto do casamento com Lázaro Ramos. A menina completou 10 anos de idade e apareceu em um vídeo inédito ao lado da mãe.\nNas imagens, as duas apareceram com o mesmo penteado e looks semelhantes. Tanto que os fãs ficaram impressionados com a semelhança física entre mãe e filha. “Como é linda! Um clone! É muita beleza”, disse um seguidor. “A cópia de Tais”, comentou outro. “Mini Tais”, declarou mais um.\nNa legenda, a mãe coruja falou sobre a data especial. \"Com vocês, Maria Antônia. Uma das minhas melhores criações. Feliz aniversário, meu amor! Todas as bençãos dos céus pra você, minha pequenininha!\", declarou.\nVer essa foto no Instagram\nRecentemente, a TV Globo divulgou as primeiras fotos de Taís Araujo caracterizada como Raquel Accioli, protagonista de Vale Tudo, novela que deve estrear este ano na emissora. A atriz se surpreendeu ao ver alguns comentários afirmando que a deixaram mais velha para a personagem.\nEm seu Instagram Stories, a artista publicou um vídeo e afirmou que está apenas sem maquiagem e com os cabelos brancos para viver a personagem. \"Ontem saíram as fotos de divulgação de Vale Tudo, e eu fui ver os comentários. Tem uns hilários falando assim: 'Ah, essa caracterização da Taís, esse envelhecimento que fizeram nela a deixaram com 80 anos'. Preciso dizer uma coisa para vocês: Não tem envelhecimento. O que acontece é que não tem maquiagem. Não tem pele. Eu uso filtro solar sem cor. Às vezes eu uso um lápis verde e um batom meio rosa. Mas não tem nada de correção de pele. Sobre meu cabelo, eu o pinto, mas deixei de pintar para fazer a novela, ele é muito branco, ele tem muita coisa branca\", disse ela.\nA famosa ainda afirmou que trata-se apenas do envelhecimento natural da vida. \"Fiquei rindo. Olha só, vocês não sabem quem eu sou. Normalmente me veem muito maquiada e produzida. Vocês vão se surpreender, vão me ver nessa novela com a cara que eu tenho, e a cara que eu tenho é essa daí, cara. Isso é envelhecimento natural da vida, eu tenho 46 anos. Normalmente as pessoas falam que eu pareço mais jovem do que a idade que tenho. Nem acho isso uma coisa boa, porque como atriz quero fazer personagens com a complexidade da minha idade. Não quero fazer personagem mais jovem e nem quero parecer mais jovem. Mas adorei que a minha cara verdadeira, sem nada, cabelo sem estar pintado caracterizaram envelhecimento. Trago verdades, essa daí sou eu\", concluiu.\nLeia também: Taís Araujo surge com look poderoso em noite especial no cinema",

    "text": "AUGUSTA, Ga. (WFXG) - An arctic cold blast, is what meteorologists are calling it. With another round of below freezing temperatures expected for next week. Many mornings will be below freezing may bring some potential dangers.\nHypothermia and frostbite are what doctors are most concerned about when the forecast dips below 32 degrees.\nWhich is a concern as students head to area bus stops to head back to the classroom.\n“That’s where our core body temperature reaches dangerously low levels. But we can also maintain core body temperatures, but get digits and have faces exposed and then we get a frostbite injury, which can be equally painful and devastating in its own right,” said Dr. Shawn Fagan, the Chief Medical Officer with the Burn and Reconstructive Centers of America at Doctors Hospital.\nSigns range from intense shivering to confusion.\n“If you see a child with cherry red, that's an indication that you're getting substantial exposure,” stated Dr. Fagan.\nEven slurred speech is an indicator.\nThe best tip is to get the person’s temperature back up to normal, is by gentle rewarming. But the best thing you can do with cold weather is preparation.\n\"Prevention is the key. It's just bundling up the children correctly. Bundling up so that they won't sweat. That they are in material that wicks sweat away,” said Dr. Fagan.\nSweat speeds up the cooling process, so Dr. Fagan recommends wearing moisture wicking layers for those who may be outside for an extended period of time.\nSome forecast models are even showing the possibility for wintry precipitation, such as snow.

    "title": "Javier Milei repudió el terrorismo de Hamás y recordó a \"las fuerzas del cielo\" que lo llevaron al triunfo - MDZ Online",
    "text": "Javier Milei repudió el terrorismo de Hamás y recordó a \"las fuerzas del cielo\" que lo llevaron al triunfo Milei dio el presente en un evento de la comunidad judía, fue acompañado y no dudó en recordar a las \"fuerzas del cielo\" que le dieron el apoyo para llegar al sillón de Rivadavia. El presidente [Javier Milei](https://twitter.com/JMilei?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) participó este jueves de la apertura inaugural de la edición XV de los Juegos Macabeos Panamericanos 2023 en el Movistar Arena y dio un discurso que se basó en \"las fuerzas del cielo\" pero también le permitió ratificar su lucha contra el terrorismo islámico, lanzar una pequeña chicana y evitar nombrar asuntos de la coyuntura nacional. \"Hola a todos\", fue la primera frase que dijo el libertario tras subirse al escenario, haciendo referencia a la canción \"Panic Show\", un icónico de la campaña de La Libertad Avanza, que identifica a su líder máximo como \"el león\". Además, agradeció tener una \"verdadera congregación del pueblo judío en una semana\" por los Juegos Macabeos, que se celebran cada cuatro años y que en esta ocasión se desarrollarán en Buenos Aires, desde este 28 de diciembre hasta el 5 de enero. Milei, desde antes de convertirse en presidente, ya tenía una muy buena relación con la comunidad judía. Tan así que dos semanas antes de asumir viajó a Nueva York para visitar la tumba del rabino de Luvavitch, Menachem Mendel Schneerson. Otro ejemplo es la bendición que recibió del rabino David Pinto Shlita, una semana antes de su viaje a Estados Unidos. También tiene a su rabino de cabecera: Shimon Axel Wahnish, quien fue el elegido para ocupar la embajada de Argentina en Israel. Wahnish es un prestigioso miembro de la comunidad judeo marroquí que se convirtió en el guía espiritual del libertario, enseñándole la Tora al presidente. Es así como hoy, Milei habló frente a un Movistar Arena repleto de atletas y familiares de 16 países y no pudo evitar referirse a las \"fuerzas del cielo\", la frase que se convirtió en un latiguillo para todos sus seguidores: \"Para los que me conocen, saben que la historia de los Macabeos para mi es muy importante, muy relevante\", explicó. Mirá el video: Milei subió al escenario ovacionado por el público \"La historia de los Macabeos para mí es una de las más inspiradoras de las escrituras, eran los menos contra los muchos, los débiles contra los poderosos, pero vencieron porque la razón y la providencia divina estaban de su lado. Porque la victoria en el combate no depende de la cantidad de soldados sino de las fuerzas que vienen del cielo\", expresó Milei, mientras la gente comenzaba a aplaudir al unísono. En ese sentido, en un momento se desvió de su discurso inicial para lanzar una chicana que el definió como un \"aviso parroquial\" contra aquellos que no creían en que él podría convertirse, junto a La Libertad Avanza, en presidente y Gobierno: \"Recuerdo que cuando junto a Victoria Villarruel estábamos asumiendo como diputados (en 2021), me habían hecho una entrevista y el periodista me dijo 'pero que pueden hacer ustedes dos adentro de un grupo de 257'. Frente a ese momento, recuerdo que le respondí citando el libro de Macabeos, que dice que la victoria en la batalla no depende de la cantidad de soldados sino de las fuerzas que vienen del cielo. Y sin lugar a dudas las fuerzas del cielo probaron ser más fuertes, argumentó Milei, dando a entender que a pesar de las críticas y poca confianza que se tenía en su figura y su Gobierno, logró llegar al Sillón de Rivadavia con las fuerzas de los Macabeos. Mirá el video: Milei saludó a los atletas argentinos de los Juegos Macabeos Panamericanos en el acto de inauguración Otro tema que estuvo presente en su discurso fue el hecho de que Israel se encuentra en guerra con la organización terrorista Hamás desde el ataque del 7 de octubre hacia el territorio y los habitantes israelíes. En ese sentido, y sobre el final del discurso, el presidente le envió un \"cariño sentido a todo el pueblo judío, en particular a quienes tienen familia o seres queridos cerca de la línea de combate\". \"Acompaño en este momento difícil y quiero ratificar mi compromiso inalterable con el Estado de Israel y con el pueblo judío en la lucha contra el [terrorismo](https://www.mdzol.com/sociedad/2023/10/12/quien-es-el-soldado-de-95-anos-que-lucha-en-el-frente-israeli-por-que-es-clave-para-los-mas-jovenes-375123.html) islámico\", confirmó. \"Por La Paz y la libertad, Viva la libertad carajo\", exclamó Milei para cerrar su discurso que tuvo como respuesta una multitud que gritaba \"viva\" en respuesta a su célebre frase. Las declaraciones del presidente que condenan al terrorismo son un llamado de esperanza para toda la comunidad judía argentina, que espera que Hamás sea incluida en la lista de organizaciones terroristas. Sabrina Ajmechet, diputada nacional, escribió para navidad un posteo que le exigía al Gobierno que tome esa decisión y el presidente, a través de red social X (exTwitter) le respondió que estaban \"trabajando en eso\". El presidente no permitió que el acto se convierta en un espacio para hablar sobre políticas de Estado actuales, en un contexto donde la oposición se queja del mega [DNU](https://www.mdzol.com/sociedad/2023/12/21/el-dnu-de-milei-establece-la-educacion-como-servicio-esencial-que-implica-393262.html) que Milei anunció y de la ley ómnibus que envió al Congreso. A 18 días de asumir como mandatario de la Argentina, el presidente se enfrenta a un paro general confirmado de la CGT el 24 de enero y a un Congreso que ve con malos ojos las facultades que quiere atribuirse. Acompañando al presidente se encontraba la vicepresidenta Victoria Villarruel y varios integrantes del Gabinete de ministros, como Patricia Bullrich, de Seguridad; Luis Petri, Defensa; Mariano Cúneo Libarona, de Justicia y Karina Milei, secretaria General de la Presidencia. Además, dijeron presente el jefe de Gobierno de la Ciudad Jorge Macri, su ministro de Seguridad Waldo Wolff y Roberto García Moritán, ministro de Desarrollo Económico porteño. La edición XV de los Juegos Macabeos Panamericanos 2023 contará con la presencia de países como Uruguay, Estados Unidos, Brasil, Chile, Canadá, México, Colombia y Cuba. Aunque también participarán delegaciones que representan otros países fuera del continente, como Israel, Suiza, Zimbabwe, Reino Unido, Sudáfrica, Australia y Alemania. Las sedes de los juegos serán los centros deportivos de la comunidad judía más grandes de Buenos Airea: el Náutico Hacoaj, Tigre; Sociedad Hebraica Argentina, Pilar y Cissab, en Tristán Suárez. Habrá 20 disciplinas compitiendo en simultáneo y cinco categorías de edad.

    "text": "Section Branding Header Content Chuck Leavell on death of Allman Brothers bandmate Dickey Betts: 'He left an enduring legacy' Hero Image Primary Content LISTEN: GPB's Orlando Montoya speaks with Chuck Leavell about his friend and former Allman Brothers bandmate, Dickey Betts, who died April 18 at age 80. ___ Dickey Betts, a founding member of the Allman Brothers Band, was known as one of the world's great guitarists and a progenitor of Southern rock. He wrote the band's 1970s FM radio staple, \"Ramblin' Man\" as well as the instrumental \"Jessica.\" Chuck Leavell played keyboards for the Macon, Ga.-based band and collaborated with Betts on songs and performances over the years. Currently in rehearsals for this year's outing with the Rolling Stones (for whom he has served as principle keyboardist and music director since 1982), Leavell took the time Thursday afternoon to reflect on Dickey Betts' life and music as well as their friendship. TRANSCRIPT: Chuck Leavell: Well, I'm feeling very, very sad. The world has lost a great guitarist, a great songwriter, and certainly I and many others that were close to Dickey have lost a very good friend. But the good news is that he has left us an amazing, enduring, and awesome legacy of music. And that's something we'll be celebrating for a long, long time. Orlando Montoya: Talk a little bit about, about his legacy. What do you think—we will talk about his musical legacy, first of all, and his personal legacy. But musically, what do you think his legacy is? Chuck Leavell: Well, he had such a very unique style, a style of his own. You know, Dickey Betts, when you heard him play, it was very recognizable, very powerful. But also as a songwriter, you know, you take a song like “Ramblin’ Man,” which was, you know, a big hit for the Allman Brothers Band when I was in the band. It's a song that everyone can relate to. You know, it’s just a straight-ahead little story that is so fun. And it's a joyful song. You know, his guitar work, especially at the end of that song where there's multiple guitars playing, is something that's very special and unique. But … some of his instrumentals, especially the song “Jessica,” that was a great vehicle for a 20-year-old piano player at the time that we recorded that song. And, you know, I still hear that song on the radio, along with “Ramblin’ Man” and some of the other songs that Dickey wrote. So, his legacy is here to stay. Orlando Montoya: And personally, you knew him as a friend. Tell me a little bit about him as a person and what you'll remember him personally. Chuck Leavell: Well, I can tell you that, when I first joined the band—and this would have been, when we were touring in 1973—we played Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Dickey had been married to a Native American woman named Sandy Blue Sky, who he wrote the song “Blue Sky “for. And Dickey called me up and he said, “Chuck, we got a couple of days off. Would you and Rose Lane (my wife Rose Lane), like to go to a reservation and meet some of these Native Americans, meet some of the chiefs, and attend some ceremonies? And that was one of the greatest experiences I've ever had. It was so sweet of him to reach out to myself and to Rose Lane and to include us in that little trip that we made. And it's something that I will never, ever forget and be grateful for. Orlando Montoya: Well, you and the band will be known as the creators of Southern rock. And I think that’s another [piece of Betts’] legacy. Chuck Leavell: Well, absolutely. Dickey Betts helped invent the term Southern rock. It's not a term that we all fell in love with, but, you know, looking back today, I think it is an appropriate term. We were from the South. Very proud to be from the South. We were influenced by Southern culture. We were influenced by Southern music, whether it's country, whether it's rhythm and blues and soul or blues. And so all of those blends worked together to form the style that the Allman Brothers Band had. And something I think we're all very happy about and very proud of. Orlando Montoya: Well, again, my thoughts are with you and the family as well, and I appreciate you talking with me in helping to remember his legacy. Chuck Leavell: Thank you so much, and rest in peace, my brother Dickey.",
