    "text": "NORTHSTATE, Calif. — The Department of Water Resources (DWR) shared their first snowpack survey of 2024 on Tuesday. Last year's snowpack was one of the largest ever in California, with a [fifth survey](https://water.ca.gov/News/News-Releases/2023/May-2023/May-2023-Snow-Survey) [last May reading as 254% above-average. But early in this new year, that number is much different.](https://water.ca.gov/News/News-Releases/2023/May-2023/May-2023-Snow-Survey) Below is the [first comparison](https://krcrtv.com/news/local/gallery/california-department-of-water-releases-first-snowpack-survey-of-2024?photo=2) between last year and this year, courtesy of the DWR. Phillips is the main survey station, near Lake Tahoe. Those numbers are on the top, with state-wide numbers on the bottom. In both cases, the yearly difference is drastic. A big change this winter is the fact we're in an [ El Nino](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/enso/december-2023-el-nino-update-adventure) year—the first since 2018/2019—which means, in simple terms, that the jet streams are switched and conditions are thrown out of whack. But El Ninos are not a perfect indicator of what’s to come during winter. The DWR says there has been extreme annual variances in recent winters. In terms of last winter, officials told KRCR it was truly an outlier. \"I would definitely classify last year as an extreme anomaly,\" said Michael Anderson, State Climatologist for the DWR. \"We really had some unusual events line up that created those windows where we had a lot of really extreme activity, and then we had these windows where absolutely nothing was happening. And this period of really wet, really dry, really wet.\" \"What we're seeing this year more [is] not quite the strength of either wet or dry, but everything kind of being a little bit subdued,\" Anderson continued. Anderson and Andrew Schwartz of the [UC Berkeley Central Sierra Snow Lab](https://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/research-unit/central-sierra-snow-lab) each said it is too soon to know how the state's snow pack/water supply will look in 2024. In regards to [this week's storms](https://twitter.com/NWSSacramento/status/1742283967490048241?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet), both men said the outlook likely won't change much, although many ski parks are expected to get a needed boost. The DWR will conduct several other snowpack surveys between now and the spring, with their peak data coming in April. One early positive is that experts believe our precipitation levels across California will ultimately finish above-average. -- To report errors or issues with this article please",

    "text": "A preacher who set out this month to pray over the entire southern border said his tent revivals, baptisms, and invocations are changing lives. Listen to them on the latest episode of “Quick Start” 👇 Pastor Tony Suarez’s [Revival on the Border](https://revivalmakers.com/revival-on-the-border/) already unfolded in El Paso, Texas, from March 21-23, and will arrive in McAllen, Texas, from March 27-29, with nightly revival meetings concluding on Good Friday. Suarez said the first wave of evangelistic outreach in El Paso was remarkable. “Our street evangelism team set out to reach everyone, everywhere!” the preacher told CBN News. “From bars to city parks to those we could get to come to the tent — when it was all set and done, God gave us a harvest of over 3,000 souls that had an experience with God, in some form or fashion.” Prayer is a vital component of the Revival on the Border effort, with Suarez explaining how a “prayer army” was equipped and sent out the last night of the El Paso event. These individuals then journeyed to spaces across the southern border to offer invocations, minister, and hand out resources. “Starting in El Paso — and in each city they’ve been to — we’ve driven a stake into the ground claiming that city for the Lord,” he said. “The prayer army was tasked with speaking the name of Jesus over every single mile of the border between Texas and Mexico, as well as praying in the Spirit, and reaching people along the way.” Suarez continued, “These men have handed out Bibles to migrants, border patrol agents [and] they have preached in parks and ministered to people in restaurants.” The preacher said dozens have been baptized and experienced healing. But he added, “The greatest miracle of all is people giving their lives to God!” Suarez asked people to continue praying for those encountering these revival events through March 29.

    "text": "By Emily Cooke ,\n11 hours ago\nDisease name: Fatal familial insomnia (FFI)\nAffected populations: The disease affects an estimated 1 to 2 people per million every year , according to the National Organization of Rare Disorders. FFI is passed from parent to child, and between 50 and 70 families worldwide are believed to carry the genetic mutation that causes FFI. Males and females are equally likely to develop the condition.\nCauses: FFI is a neurodegenerative prion disease that is caused by a mutation in a gene called PRNP , which produces a so-called prion protein. Prions are misfolded versions of normal proteins, and their abnormal shape is toxic to cells in the body, particularly neurons in the brain . One of the tissues that is primarily damaged in patients with FFI is the thalamus , a region of the brain that regulates an array of body functions including sleep, body temperature and appetite.\nChildren need to inherit only one copy of the mutant PRNP gene from a parent to develop the condition. In rare instances, patients may spontaneously develop mutations in the PRNP gene, despite having no family history of FFI. They can then pass this mutation on to their children in the regular way.\nRelated: Not all insomnia is the same — in fact, there may be 5 types\nSymptoms: The hallmark symptom of FFI is insomnia, or the inability to fall or stay asleep , which progressively worsens over time to the point where patients cannot sleep at all .\nPatients with FFI also commonly experience memory loss, high blood pressure, hallucinations and involuntary jerking of their muscles . They may sweat profusely and lose their coordination .\nSymptoms usually begin around age 40, but can develop as early as age 20 or as late as age 70. Patients eventually enter a coma-like state and typically die within nine to 30 months after their symptoms emerge.\nBrain scans of a patient with fatal familial insomnia.

As the disease is so rare, there is also no standard way of treating it. Instead, patients may be given advice on how to best manage their symptoms and live as comfortable a life as possible . For instance, taking the drug clonazepam can reduce muscle jerking .\n— 'Love hormone' oxytocin may be missing link between sleep apnea and high blood pressure\n— What is sleep hygiene?\n— Is insomnia a sign of pregnancy?\nA medical case report from 2006 showed that trying to induce sleep — for instance, by engaging in rigorous exercise and taking narcoleptic drugs — extended and enhanced the life of 52-year-old man with FFI by about a year, but did not prevent his death .\nIn 2015, a clinical trial of a drug that aims to prevent the onset of FFI was launched. Over 10 years, 10 people who carry the FFI mutation will be given the antibiotic doxycycline and their prognosis and survival after disease onset will be compared to patients who previously died of FFI. Doxycycline has also been shown to prevent the formation of misfolded proteins in another prion disease, called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, helping patients live twice as long as those who didn't receive the treatment .\nEver wonder why some people build muscle more easily than others or why freckles come out in the sun ?
