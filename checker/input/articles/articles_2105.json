    "text": "The first all-women anti-Maoist commando unit, Danteshwari Fighters, a team of 97 is standing strong in Bastar.\nDanteshwari Fighters that started as a unit of 16, has now come so far that they are here to compete with men. Two of the women commandos from the unit have been awarded with out-of-turn promotion for killing two Maoists, as per the report by The Times Of India .\nThese Danteshwari 'Ladake' are volunteers who are ready to stand strong and take a bullet to save their people.\nEarlier Danteshwari commandos would help other security forces to carry out anti Naxalite operations, however, now they do it on their own as a unit. This year, they plan to organise cultural events where chief minister Vishnu Deo Sai will be the guest.\nSunaina Patel, head constable of Danteshwari fighters would go on operation even during her pregnancy period, according to TOI .\nSunaina along with Reshma Kashyap had killed two of the Maoists in Jallampal. She told TOI that, \"It was like stepping into the den of death, but we went in and completed the mission.\"\n\"Once I was trapped in a Maoist ambush. it was a close one, but I narrowly escaped. when we are on a mission, we don't think of anything else,\" she added.\nShe further said that Danteshwari fighter are deployed as road opening parties for projects on Kamarguda-Jagargunda route and provide security to the construction team, she told TOI .\nIt also reported that these commandos are trained in medicine who then go to villages to check up on peoples health and give medication.\nADVERTISEMENT (Published 08 March 2024, 13:41 IST)",

    "title": "Israeli tanks, missiles strike Gaza in offensive against Hamas",
    "text": "By Nidal al-Mughrabi and Bassam Masoud\nCAIRO/GAZA (Reuters) – Israeli forces attacked areas of the central and southern Gaza Strip where residents have been expecting a renewed ground offensive in areas crammed with tens of thousands of Palestinians already displaced by the Israeli-Hamas war.\nWith nightfall on Thursday, an Israeli airstrike on a house in the southern city of Khan Younis killed eight Palestinians, health officials said. Three Palestinians were killed and six injured in an Israeli missile strike on a house in Maghazi camp in central Gaza, the Palestine Red Crescent said.\n“The task here is to dismantle Hamas – so that it no longer has military and governing capabilities,” Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said at a press briefing on operations in Khan Younis. “We will be required to show a lot of perseverance and determination.”\nA Palestinian journalist posted pictures of Israeli tanks near a mosque in a built-up area of Bureij in central Gaza.\nThe Islamist group Hamas released video it said showed its fighters targeting Israeli tanks and soldiers east of Bureij. Reuters was not able to verify the location or the date the video was filmed.\n“That moment has come, I wished it would never happen, but it seems displacement is a must,” said Omar, 60, who said he had been forced to move with at least 35 family members. He declined to give his surname for fear of reprisals.\nYamen Hamad has been living in a school in Deir al-Balah, also in central Gaza, since fleeing from the north. He said people newly displaced from Bureij and Nusseirat were setting up tents wherever there was open ground.\nIn one of Israel’s latest airstrikes, 20 Palestinians were killed and 55 wounded in Rafah, a major town near the southern border with Egypt, Gaza health ministry spokesman Ashraf Al-Qidra said. Their bombed building was housing displaced civilians, according to local medics and residents.\nSEARCHING THROUGH RUBBLE\nReuters video showed rescuers scrabbling frantically through rubble to uncover and pull out victims including a baby and several children and rushing them through milling crowds of dazed and weeping people to the nearby Kuwaiti Hospital.\nPalestinian health authorities said earlier that 210 people were confirmed killed in Israeli strikes in the past 24 hours, raising the toll of Palestinians killed in the war so far to 21,320 – nearly 1% of Gaza’s population. Thousands more dead were feared to be buried or lost in the ruins.\nOver the course of the war, the Israeli military has expressed regret for civilian deaths but it accuses Hamas of operating in densely populated areas and using civilians as human shields, a charge the group denies.\nHamas and its fighters are dug deep into the Gaza Strip’s dense cities and towns and their leaders are still at large.\nIsrael has reported 169 of its soldiers killed in its Gaza campaign after Hamas fighters rampaged through Israeli towns in a cross-border raid on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and taking about 240 hostages.\nSome 110 hostages were freed during a Nov. 24-Dec. 1 humanitarian pause and more than 20 others have been declared dead.\nU.S. President Joe Biden said on Thursday that Hamas killed an American hostage, Judith Weinstein, 70, on Oct. 7. Last week he said her husband Gadi Haggai, 73, was killed on the same day.\nThe Israeli military released findings of an investigation into the killings in error by its troops of three Israeli hostages in Gaza on Dec. 15. Soldiers mistook their cries for help as a ruse by Hamas militants to draw them into an ambush, the military said, concluding that the soldiers acted rightly to the best of their understanding.\nEGYPT’S PLAN TO END CONFLICT\nEgypt confirmed on Thursday that it had put forward a framework proposal to end the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip that includes three stages ending with a ceasefire and said it was awaiting responses on the plan.\nThe proposal is an attempt “to bring viewpoints between all concerned parties closer, in an effort to stop Palestinian bloodshed and the aggression against the Gaza Strip and restore peace and stability to the region,” Diaa Rashwan, head of Egypt’s State Information Service, said in a statement.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will keep some form of security control of all Gaza indefinitely, though he insists that this would not amount to reoccupying the enclave.\n(Reporting by Reporting by Nidal al-Mughrabi in Cairo, Bassam Masoud in Gaza and Emily Rose in Jerusalem; writing by Grant McCool; editing by Howard Goller)",

    "text": "Cientistas da Universidade Northwestern conseguiram realizar o primeiro teletransporte quântico usando um cabo de fibra óptica comum, uma infraestrutura típica de internet.\nEste feito foi alcançado por meio do emaranhamento quântico, permitindo a transferência de informações entre dois pontos sem que estas precisem percorrer fisicamente a distância entre eles.\nPrem Kumar, professor e líder do estudo, destacou a importância do experimento para o futuro das comunicações.\n“Nosso trabalho mostra um caminho em direção às redes quânticas e clássicas de próxima geração que compartilham uma infraestrutura de fibra óptica unificada”, afirmou Kumar.\nO processo de teletransporte empregado pela equipe utilizou partículas de fótons. Anteriormente, estudos indicaram que o emaranhamento quântico poderia ser interrompido em comprimentos de onda similares aos usados no tráfego de internet.\nNo entanto, o estudo atual demonstrou que, ao operar em um comprimento de onda distinto, o emaranhamento se mantém intacto, permitindo a comunicação quântica sem interferências.\nJordan Thomas, candidato a Ph.D. e primeiro autor do artigo, explicou o processo: “Realizamos uma medição destrutiva em dois fótons, transferindo o estado quântico de um para outro que pode estar localizado a grandes distâncias. Essencialmente, não é necessário que o fóton viaje essa distância, pois seu estado é codificado no fóton distante.”\nA pesquisa revelou que os fótons emaranhados podiam se perder entre milhões de outras partículas de luz. No entanto, a equipe descobriu uma forma de minimizar essa interferência estudando como a luz se espalha dentro dos cabos de fibra óptica e colocando os fótons em pontos onde o espalhamento de luz é reduzido.\nDurante os testes, um cabo de fibra óptica de 30km foi utilizado. Com um fóton em cada extremidade e o tráfego de internet ocorrendo simultaneamente, os cientistas foram capazes de realizar o teletransporte de informações quânticas com êxito, marcando um avanço significativo na integração de tecnologias de comunicação clássicas e quânticas.",

    "text": "U n monumental triple de Hezonja en el último segundo resolvió para el Real Madrid un partido de locos frente al Baskonia (90-89) . Perdían los blancos por dos a falta de 17 segundos y su ataque se ensució, Campazzo estuvo a punto de perder el balón, lo atrapó Tavares y se la entregó al alero croata, que hizo volar a Moneke, dio dos pasos a la derecha y la clavó sobre la bocina. El triple de su vida .\nEstiró los brazos para celebrarlo, empezó a tirarse de la camiseta, a señalar el escudo madridista y a acercarse a una afición enloquecida mientras los árbitros revisaban si quedaba algo de tiempo. Dos décimas de segundo en las que el Baskonia no pudo hacer más que un pase largo en busca de un imposible . Se le había ido otro final ajustado. Los blancos, mientras, siguen en su cruzada por alcanzar los puestos playoffs.\nFacundo Campazzo y Chima Moneke pelean por un rebote. EFE Fue un desenlace bestial para un encuentro que el Madrid tuvo encarrilado: 84-75, a falta de 3:38. También muy cuesta arriba después de dos pérdidas seguidas: 84-88 y triple fallado por Samanic . Ahí dio la primera puñalada Hezonja con un triple. Luego Baldwin falló dos tiros libres , pero el rebote de ataque, gran lastre de los blancos , fue para Samanic, que se dejó otro tiro desde la personal y dio al Madrid la posibilidad de forzar la prórroga o resolver. Tras el caos de la última acción, Hezonja hizo lo segundo .\nEl Madrid se desangra en el rebote de ataque Fue casi un milagro que los madridistas ganaran. Concedieron ¡21 rebotes de ataque! al Baskonia y lanzaron 29 tiros de campo menos (50 por 79) . Aguantaron con un gran Campazzo, la puntería de Hezonja , el acierto en los tiros libres, especialmente en el tercer cuarto (11/11) y la defensa de Garuba y Abalde, que le dio la noche a Howard , también lastrado por las personales.\nLuka Samanic hace un mate sobre Edy Tavares y Usman Garuba. EFE Moneke y Rogkavopoulos cargaban el rebote como si no hubiera mañana (12 ofensivos entre los dos) y el griego, además, se mostraba letal en ataque (22 puntos). Forrest también plantaba cara a Campazzo (19) y aprovechaba cada descanso de Tavares para campar por la zona.\nEl Baskonia aguanta sin pívots Con todo eso, el partido salió igualado. Hubo 17 cambios de líder en el marcador y nadie tuvo más de seis puntos de ventaja hasta el último periodo . El Madrid pegó un tirón que parecía definitivo. Creció la defensa y Musa cerró un parcial de 10-0 (84-75) que incluyó una técnica a Laso, ovacionado en su segundo regreso a la que fue su casa . Pero el Baskonia, jugando sin pívot puro, nunca se rindió.\nDzanan Musa entra a canasta ante la defensa de Khalifa Diop.

    "text": "ABACAXI PARA BAIXAR A GLICOSE EM POUCO TEMPO: receita rápida de suco de abacaxi para baixar a glicemia rapidamente Conheça receita prática de suco de abacaxi para controlar a glicose. O [abacaxi (Ananas comosus) figura entre as frutas mais populares no Brasil](https://social1.ne10.uol.com.br/webstory/2023/12/15652574-receita-de-abacaxi-para-baixar-a-glicose-naturalmente-aprenda-truque-do-suco-de-abacaxi-para-baixar-a-glicose.html) e é apreciado mundialmente. Originário de regiões tropicais e subtropicais, esse fruto versátil conquista paladares em sua forma natural e como ingrediente culinário. DIABÉTICOS PODEM COMER ABACAXI? A resposta é sim, com a ressalva de que todas as frutas devem ser consumidas com moderação para evitar oscilações nos níveis de glicose. O abacaxi se destaca por apresentar baixo índice glicêmico, o que significa que o açúcar contido na fruta é metabolizado lentamente, evitando picos de glicose no sangue. Essa característica é especialmente relevante para o controle glicêmico, um aspecto crucial no gerenciamento da diabetes. É fundamental salientar a importância de manter a glicemia controlada para indivíduos com diabetes, sendo a consulta a profissionais de saúde essencial para orientações personalizadas sobre a dieta. Para otimizar os benefícios do abacaxi, é recomendável optar pela versão fresca da fruta, evitando as opções enlatadas ou em calda, que podem conter adição de açúcar. Além disso, uma estratégia interessante para aqueles que buscam controlar a glicemia é privilegiar o consumo da fruta em sua forma integral, em vez de optar pelo suco, que pode ter uma concentração maior de açúcar e menos fibras. SUCO DE ABACAXI PARA O CONTROLE DA GLICEMIA Ingredientes: - 1 abacaxi maduro; - Água (opcional). Modo de Preparo: - Lave cuidadosamente o abacaxi sob água corrente. - Descasque a fruta, removendo a casca externa e a parte central dura. Corte o abacaxi em pedaços pequenos. - Coloque os pedaços no liquidificador. - Se preferir um suco mais encorpado, não é necessário adicionar água. No entanto, para uma opção mais leve, acrescente um pouco de água ao liquidificador. - Misture bem até obter uma consistência suave. Para indivíduos com diabetes, essa abordagem representa uma escolha consciente, proporcionando os benefícios nutricionais do abacaxi de maneira equilibrada. No entanto, reforça-se a importância de consultas regulares com profissionais de saúde para garantir uma abordagem personalizada e segura em relação à dieta. “A matéria apresentada neste portal tem caráter informativo e não deve ser considerada como aconselhamento médico.
