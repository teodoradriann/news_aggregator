    "text": "Raheb, homme d'église de la ville historique de Bethléem, en Cisjordanie occupée par Israël, a fait des déclarations sur la situation en Palestine au site web \"Democracy Now\". Ce dernier a dit penser que la communauté chrétienne allait disparaître de Palestine, avant d'accuser Israël d'avoir tué moins 3% de la communauté chrétienne de Gaza. Soulignant que le Noël de cette année a été très triste et que, de toute sa vie, il n'avait jamais éprouvé une telle tristesse et, en même temps, une telle colère à l'égard de ce qui se passe à Gaza. \"Les célébrations et les festivités de Noël à Bethléem ont été annulées, il n'y a pas de lumières ni d'arbres de Noël dans la ville\" a expliqué le pasteur luthérien. Il a ajouté que les touristes ne venaient pas dans la ville en raison de la guerre et que les habitants n'avaient pas le cœur à faire la fête avec ce que subit le \"peuple à Gaza\", avant de préciser: Notre peuple en Cisjordanie, subit l'apartheid et la colonisation par les colons juifs Raheb a rappelé qu'au cours des 75 derniers jours, Israël a tué plus 20 000 personnes à Gaza et des centaines d'autres en Cisjordanie, et qu'il a interpellé plus de 3 000 Palestiniens en Cisjordanie. 3 % de la communauté chrétienne de Gaza a été tuée. \"Plus de 8 000 enfants ont été tués à Gaza pour que Netanyahou reste au pouvoir\" , a insisté Raheb. \"Israël attaque les églises, les mosquées, les hôpitaux, les écoles et les universités. Croyez-le ou non, 11 universités ont été détruites au cours de cette guerre. Plus de 200 écoles ont été détruites\" , a-t-il déploré. Le religieux a souligné qu'il était \"honteux\" pour les Etats-Unis d'avoir opposé leur veto au cessez-le-feu à un moment où les mots \"paix dans le monde\" sont entendus dans toutes les églises. L'ecclésiastique palestinien a aussi souligné:\nL'histoire de Noël est en fait une histoire palestinienne. \"La présence chrétienne à Gaza remonte à 2000 ans. Je pense que cette communauté va disparaître à cause de la guerre d'Israël contre Gaza. 3 % de la communauté chrétienne de Gaza a été tuée en 75 jours\" , a-t-il conclu. A lire également:",

    "text": "Bihar deputy chief minister and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav has rubbished the rumours about the resignation of Lalan Singh New Delhi: Top leaders of the Janata Dal (United) are in New Delhi for the party’s national executive meeting on Friday. The two-day meeting was convened by JD(U) president Rajiv Ranjan Singh, popularly known as Lalan Singh, amid speculation that he could step down to make way for Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar to take over the reins of the party again. The JD(U)’s national office-bearers' meeting was held Thursday and this will be followed by national executive and national council meetings on Friday. However, Lalan Singh dismissed reports of his resignation, saying a “narrative” has been set by the media at the behest of the ruling BJP. Mr Singh said the meeting was a routine one, and stressed that his party remains united. “If I have to resign, I will call you (the media), and consult you about what to write in the resignation letter, so that you can go to the BJP office and get the draft. You are trying to set the narrative… JD(U) is one, and will remain united,” Mr Singh said. Speculation has been rife that Mr Singh may be asked to resign due to his alleged proximity to ally Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD). A section of the media also claimed that after having dumped the BJP in August last year, Mr Kumar was now planning an about-turn. Mr Nitish Kumar asserted that the party’s meeting was a “normal and annual” affair with “nothing extraordinary” about it, rejecting speculation about turmoil in his party. He, however, ducked questions when asked whether Lalan Singh was likely to make a formal offer of his resignation at the meeting on December 29. He also evaded questions about the rumours of his joining the NDA. Bihar deputy chief minister and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav has rubbished the rumours about the resignation of Lalan Singh. “These is all useless talk… Every party holds its national executive meeting. We also held our party’s national executive meeting in Delhi,” Mr Yadav said. At the national executive meeting venue, posters featuring Bihar CM Nitish Kumar reading “Pradesh ne pehchana, ab desh bhi pehchanega” (The state of Bihar recognised him, now the nation will) were put up. However, as the Lok Sabha elections draw closer, the BJP claims that a transfer of power in Bihar is in the offing, a claim strongly denied by the ruling coalition. Union minister and BJP leader Giriraj Singh said: “Nitish Kumar ji will remain the chief minister of Bihar for just a few days. Lalu Prasad Yadav has created a ‘chakravyuh’ for this. The first step of this ‘chakravyuh’ was making Awadh Bihar the Speaker of the Bihar Assembly. Nitish Kumar will become former (CM) very soon… It is fixed that Nitish Kumar will not remain the CM anymore. In the next few days, Bihar is going to get a CM from the RJD…”",

    "title": "Китайский монстр G700 способен то, о чём другие внедорожники и не мечтают",
    "text": "Внешне G700 напоминает коктейль из Land Rover Defender и Toyota Land Cruiser 250. Но копией его не назовёшь — у него собственный стиль. Гигантский кузов (длина — 5198 мм, ширина — 2050 мм) прячет в себе современную раму и полностью независимую подвеску с пневматикой. В максимальном положении дорожный просвет достигает 320 мм — то, что нужно для серьёзного бездорожья.\nИ вот в чём парадокс: китайцы сделали рамный внедорожник с пневмоподвеской, но пошли дальше — под капотом тут вовсе не дизель. Мощность в 751 л. с. обеспечивает гибридная система Chery Kupeng CDM-O. В её составе:\nдвухлитровый турбодвигатель (211 л. с.);\nдва электромотора — по одному на каждую ось;\nлитий-железо-фосфатная батарея;\nи двухступенчатый редуктор для передачи момента на передние колёса.\nРезультат? Ускорение до \"сотни\" за 4,6 секунды. У суперкроссоверов нет шансов. Максимальная скорость — 180 км/ч, а вес при этом — более трёх тонн (до 3180 кг в зависимости от конфигурации).\nJetour Zongheng G700 не про скорость, а про свободу. Благодаря силовой установке и внушительному баку запас хода составляет 1400 километров. Это значит, что можно не думать о заправках даже в самой глуши. К тому же, машина способна тянуть прицеп весом до 2,5 тонны. Подзарядка батареи с 20 до 80% — всего за 10 минут.\nКитайцы, похоже, вдохновлялись амфибией Yangwang U8. Новый G700 при необходимости способен преодолевать водные преграды — до 40 минут он может держаться на плаву, благодаря герметичной конструкции кузова.\nСалон встречает не брезентовыми сиденьями, а кожей и металлом. Шестиместная конфигурация, кожаная отделка, экран на всю ширину панели вместо приборки, и 15,6-дюймовый дисплей мультимедиа — всё как в премиум-сегменте. Кнопки остались только на тоннеле, где есть и беспроводная зарядка для гаджетов.\nЗвучит странно, но да: несмотря на общую концепцию \"рамный внедорожник\", китайский G700 заметно отличается от Mercedes-Benz G-Class. У \"немца\" — передняя независимая подвеска и задний мост, у китайца — полностью независимая схема с возможностью подстраивать клиренс.\nJetour (кит. 捷途) — отдельный бренд китайского автопроизводителя и автоконцерна Chery, созданный в январе 2018 года. Название бренда состоит из комбинации английских слов jet («реактивный самолёт») и tour («путешествие»).",

    "text": "APPLE VALLEY, Calif. (VVNG.com) — Residents around the Victor Valley experienced a drastic change in weather on Wednesday evening when a sudden storm rolled into the area bringing thunder, lightning, flash flooding, and even hail.\nOn March 20, 2023, not long after an ominous sunset, the remnants of the spring storm moved into the Victor Valley producing several noticeable large cloud formations.\nSome residents in the Mesa area of Hesperia and Oak Hills reported experiencing rain and thunder. However, residents in the Town of Apple Valley experienced flash flooding, lightning, and hail.\n“In all the years I have lived in the high desert, I had never heard the emergency sirens. It was crazy and scary to hear,” commented Victor Valley News Group Member Norma Armenta.\nJoshua Castro replied and said it was the Spring Valley Lake siren that is used to tell everyone to get out of the water or to stay away.\nTaylor Shane shared a photo of his garage that was completely flooded near Apple Valley Road and Highway 18. Shane said it rained for approximately 15 minutes but it was enough to flood his garage and a bedroom.\nAt about 8:11 pm, Firefighters from the Apple Valley Fire Protection District were dispatched to a swift water rescue on Kasota Road, just south of Highway 18, near Potomac Road.\nA woman driving in a blue Honda Fit ran off the roadway, and into a drainage wash. She was stuck inside the vehicle and unable to exit safely on her own.\nInterim Batallion Chief Sean Grober said they utilized Medic Truck 336 to rescue the victim.\n“It seemed we had a cell come over Apple Valley and lasted for about 45 minutes or so, brought a significant amount of rain,” stated Grober. “The victim was not harmed in any way and is doing well and in good spirits.”\nDesert Recovery founding members Eddie Kochara and his wife Shannon responded to the incident and helped the owner recover the vehicle from the moving water.\nDesert Recovery is a Facebook group with over 11,000 members who volunteer their time and personal vehicles to help motorists who are stuck in places usually where tow trucks can’t service. The group never charges a fee for helping someone out.\nTo follow updates to this article and more, join our\nnewsgroupon Facebook with over 165,000 members.

(Foto: Dragomir Yankovic/Photosport) Por Patricio Muñoz\nEste jueves Arturo Vidal entregó una gran noticia en Colo Colo , al superar la lesión muscular -de triceps sural izquierdo- que lo marginó de varios compromisos en los útimos dos meses.\nAsí lo informó el propio King, quien ya estaría en condiciones de ser considerado por el entrenador Jorge Almirón para los próximos partidos del Cacique.\nA través de una publicación en Instagram, el volante de 37 años escribió un desafiante mensaje para dar a conocer su regreso a las canchas.\n“No se asusten, volvió el King” , escribió Vidal junto a una fotografía entrenando en el Estadio Monumental.\nTambién subió una historia en el gimnasio del reducto de Macul junto a Leonardo Gil , con el mensaje: “Estamos ready con mi hermanito”.\nCaptura de la publicación de Arturo Vidal en Instagram. La rebelde lesión muscular que tuvo Arturo Vidal Cabe recordar que el bicampeón de América se lesionó el 21 de julio en el triunfo por 2-1 ante Unión Española. Intentó adelantar el alta médica para el Superclásico con Universidad de Chile del 10 de agosto, donde solo pudo disputar el primer tiempo.\nLuego, quiso estar para la ida de los octavos de final de Copa Libertadores ante Junior de Barranquilla, pero se resintió en el trabajo precompetitivo. Finalmente en la revancha en Colombia, jugó los últimos minutos.\nCaptura de la historia de Instagram de Arturo Vidal. El King se recuperó antes de lo esperado Desde ahí que el ex Barcelona se mantuvo fuera de las canchas para tener una óptima recuperación. Incluso, en el cuerpo técnico pensaban que recién iba a estar disponible para el clásico contra Universidad Católica del próximo viernes 13 de septiembre.\nEl gran objetivo del oriundo de San Joaquín era llegar a la llave de cuartos de final de la Libertadores contra River Plate, el martes 17 y 24 de septiembre.\nPatricio Muñoz Arturo Vidal LEE TAMBIÉN Selección Chilena Selección Chilena Argentino campeón del mundo y el grave problema de La Roja de Gareca",
