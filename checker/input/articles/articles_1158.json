    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Franklin County, Alabama from 1901-2000 was 42.1. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Franklin County, Alabama experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Franklin County, Alabama history.",

    "title": "Climate hasn't been core to the GOP. These conservatives are trying to change that",
    "text": "Climate hasn't been core to the GOP. These conservatives are trying to change that\nTucked into a hallway at the Republican National Convention, between booths promoting the Second Amendment and another selling official merchandise of the Trump Campaign, sat a sprawling display of the conservative legacy in environmentalism.\nYoung conservatives ran back and forth asking convention goers with Nixon pins if they were familiar with former President Richard Nixon’s environmental policy. They approached oil lobbyists about the need for climate change conversations. They handed out stickers to rising young Republican voters.\n“The word ‘Conservative’ is in ‘conservation,’” said Aidan Shank, one member of the American Conservation Coalition, the environmental group that set up the booth.\nFor years, the Republican Party has gotten a reputation for denying climate science and the urgency of global warming. Their statements about the environment usually focus on burning more fossil fuels, the biggest driver of climate change.\nBut this year, for the first time in recent memory, conservatives had a climate showing at the Republican National Convention. The leadership of the American Conservation Coalition (ACC) flew to Milwaukee for a week of conversations around climate, conservation, and energy. They kept up efforts to win delegates’ attention and support, even as their party nominated former President Donald Trump, who doesn’t acknowledge the full effects of human-caused climate change and has vowed to rescind many of President Biden’s climate-related investments.\nYoung conservatives are likely to support Trump this November. Still, they want to see their party talk about climate and energy policy. They see potential for a Trump administration to prioritize domestic production of clean energy. Unlike their Democratic counterparts–and prevailing climate science—they also still back oil and gas development.\n“We can be hopeful. And our approach has always been to work with people where we can,” said Danielle Butcher Franz, CEO of ACC. She added: “We really are using this RNC to introduce ourselves to the base, and to stakeholders, and to say there's a better way to do environmental policy.”\nYoung conservatives hope to reframe the conversation\nOn their first morning in Milwaukee, six members of ACC got ready at an Airbnb for their convention debut. Decked out with their American flag caps, brown Tevoca boots, American flag belt and button-up shirt with bison, they planned out their RNC reception event schedule: arrive at 1 pm, do a reception hosted by another group, and have time to visit, talk to dozens of people over five hours.\nACC was an RNC sponsor, cementing its mark at the Republican gathering. It's considered a significant milestone for the group, which formed in 2017 during the first Trump administration.\nAt its inception, it quickly attracted young politicos like Stephen Perkins, the 29-year-old chief operating officer of ACC.\n“I grew up going camping and with my dad and fishing and all that sort of stuff. And so we've always had an appreciation for the environment and the outdoors,” said Perkins, of the Texas places he grew up in and loved. “As I got more involved in politics, the issues that I gravitated toward were the tougher ones.”\nPerkins likes to talk to fellow young conservatives about the impact of climate change on most policy issues. He recalled when one young Republican told him that he didn’t care about climate — that he was more concerned about immigration. Perkins had an answer for him.\n“Not the only reason, but a big reason why people are coming here is many of them are climate refugees,” Perkins said of the explanation he gave about immigration “There are places where whether it's flooding or extreme heat, they're coming here to escape that. And so there's actually a connection.”\nGenerally, Republicans have not seen climate as their issue. And leaders, like Trump and Vance, have championed fossil fuel production over conservation and climate action.\n“He’s (Trump) not perfect. We certainly recognize that. He needs to talk about climate change,” Perkins said. “But when you talk about seven years ago when ACC was started, you couldn't get Republican elected officials to even talk about climate change.”\nSome of that has evolved. During the first GOP debate, an ACC member asked presidential candidates running against Trump how they would ease fears that the GOP doesn’t care about climate. There were few direct answers.\nAlthough climate is not a top issue for Republicans, i\nt does rank higher on the list of policy priorities for younger Republicans. The steps are small but ACC hopes a younger generation of conservatives can reframe the conversation. One way of doing so was with the large booth at the convention.\nMost visitors were curious and generally supportive. They picked up stickers, and fliers and colored a large poster that spelled out the word “legacy.”\nThere was the occasional pushback — like an oil lobbyist who denied climate change.\n“Approaching every conversation with empathy is the first place to begin,” said Aidan Shank, who was staffing the ACC table. “There's so many places where we can agree, and just assuming that the conversation revolves around finding those agreements, sometimes that's the most constructive way to create dialogue.”\nThe leaders at ACC wanted to create the organization in order to facilitate the conversations Shank is having at the convention now. Like Perkins, Danielle Butcher Franz grew up in the outdoors. Raised in a more liberal family, she said she never thought of the environment as a partisan issue, until she started talking to others.\n“As we would speak to our peers, we would notice over and over them saying things like, ‘I'm conservative except on the environment’ or ‘I want to support Democrats because of climate change,’” Butcher Franz said.\nThough she generally feels welcome in her conservative spaces, she at first had to fight stereotypes.\n“On the right, you would sort of have this skepticism of, ‘Are you really conservatives, or is this like a Trojan horse for big government solutions that we don't agree with?’ ” Butcher Franz said, noting that she also pushes back against stereotypes about Republican interest in climate.\n“It can be frustrating to have to constantly feel like you're in myth-busting mode, and you have to constantly dispel these preconceived notions that people have about what you believe and what you stand for,” Butcher Franz said.\nRepublicans celebrate being at the convention — at all\nLater in the day, the group gathers inside the Mitchell Park Domes Horticulture Conservatory to host a reception with dozens of guests and to talk about energy innovation, and Republicans’ long involvement with the environment. Mainly, they wanted to celebrate being at the convention.\nNearly all the speakers acknowledged that this kind of convention presence was new and signals a turning tide. In remarks, ACC President Chris Barnard noted that he believed this was a historic event. “This is the first time something like this has happened at a Republican convention — we have a conservative climate reception,” he proudly told the crowd.\nTalking with NPR, Barnard says he still feels like there is a stereotype that to care about climate or conservation is to be a Democrat. But he wants to see the GOP — even Trump and Vance — to take advantage of the issue.\n“It's politically very popular,” Barnard said. “And so the first thing to say really is that for anyone in the Republican Party, that's not championing that message: That's really just a lost opportunity.”\nBarnard saw speaking to delegates and other 2024 candidates at the convention as a foot in the door. And he hopes ACC’s conversations, the booth and receptions encourage them to address climate in their local races.\n“It's important to talk to them and kind of equip them with the messaging and how they can talk about these issues,” Barnard said. “And hoping that there's a good opportunity to work with Republicans on important environmental and climate policies.”\nCopyright 2024 NPR",

The airstrike has left the facility completely unusable, according to hospital director Ali Mahmoud.\n“Al Daein Teaching Hospital is completely out of service,” said Mahmoud. Around 650 patients, including 200 children, were evacuated.\nThe closure has also impacted surrounding private clinics, raising concerns of a severe healthcare crisis in the area, which has been under the control of the paramilitary Rapid since late last year.\nThe bombing destroyed several wards including the men’s internal medicine ward, intensive care unit, mental health and tuberculosis departments. Three newborns and a stroke patient were among the casualties.\nSince the conflict erupted in April, most hospitals in Darfur have been rendered inoperable due to fighting, exacerbating the spread of diseases such as malaria, diarrhoea and malnutrition.",

    "text": "Sydney, renowned for its stunning architectural landscape, has witnessed an intriguing evolution in housing design. In this article, we delve into the realm of modern two-story houses, focusing on the allure of award-winning duplex designs that have become the epitome of elegance in Sydney’s housing market.\nSydney’s Architectural Landscape\nThe rich history of Sydney’s architecture sets the stage for understanding current housing trends.

These eco-friendly initiatives not only benefit the environment but also enhance the overall appeal of these residences.\nBenefits of Two-Story Living\nThe surge in popularity of two-story houses in Sydney is not arbitrary; it is rooted in a plethora of advantages that cater to the evolving needs and preferences of modern homeowners. This section delves into the compelling benefits, showcasing why these architectural marvels are gaining traction.\n1. Efficient Space Utilisation\nOne of the primary attractions of two-story living is the efficient use of available space. With the increasing premium on land in urban areas, vertical expansion becomes a practical solution. Two-story houses optimally utilise limited ground space, allowing homeowners to have a more substantial living area without compromising the footprint of their property. This efficiency is particularly valuable in densely populated cities like Sydney, where space comes at a premium.\n2. Enhanced Privacy\nPrivacy is a precious commodity in the bustling urban landscape, and two-story houses offer an effective remedy. The vertical separation of living spaces and bedrooms inherently provides a level of privacy that is often challenging to achieve in single-story dwellings. Bedrooms situated on the upper floor naturally become secluded retreats, shielded from the noise and activities of the communal areas downstairs. This enhanced privacy fosters a more tranquil living environment, catering to the desire for personal space and seclusion.\n3. Separation of Living and Sleeping Spaces\nTwo-story houses excel in providing a distinct separation between living and sleeping spaces. This architectural layout aligns with the evolving lifestyle preferences of homeowners, offering a clear distinction between daytime communal activities and nighttime rest. The ground floor typically accommodates shared spaces such as the living room, kitchen, and dining area, fostering a sense of togetherness. Meanwhile, the upper floor becomes a haven for bedrooms, promoting a tranquil retreat for relaxation and sleep. This separation enhances the overall functionality of the home, creating a well-defined balance in daily activities.\n4.
