    "text": "Hearst Magazines, the publisher of Cosmopolitan, Good Housekeeping and Esquire, has fired around 200 employees — most of whom work at the company’s iconic headquarters in Midtown Manhattan.\nThe Writers Guild of America East (WGAE), the union which represents thousands of media professionals, told the news site W42ST that the total number of layoffs amounted to 197 people — 67 of whom were members of the Hearst Union bargaining unit.\nThe union also told W42ST that “most affected workers are based at Hearst Tower” on 8th Avenue and 57th Street on Manhattan’s West Side.\nHearst Tower, which rises nearly 600 feet and 46 stories high, is a Norman Foster-designed triangular glass skyscraper known for its sleek, environmentally friendly layout.\nThe tower was constructed in 2006 atop the original Hearst Magazine Building, whose facade was designated as a city landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1988.\nDebi Chirichella, the president of the company, circulated a memo to employees announcing the layoffs last week.\n“After a thorough review of our business, we’ve decided to reallocate resources to better support our goals and continue our focus on digital innovation while strengthening our best in class print products,” Chirichella wrote in the memo, which was reported by The Hollywood Reporter.",

    "text": "Filho mais novo de Cher, Elijah Blue Allman estaria com problemas de saúde física e mental, além do suposto uso contínuo de drogas\nCantora de música como \"Believe,\" \"If I Could Turn Back Time\" e \"Strong Enough,\"\nCher entrou supostamente com pedido de tutela para o filho mais novo, Elijah Blue Allman, por preocupação de supostos problemas \"graves\" de abuso de drogas e outras substâncias ilícitas. As informações são da People.\nO site obteve documentos judiciais apresentados no Tribunal Superior de Los Angeles, que mostrar como a artista solicita ser a única tutora dos bens do filho mais novo, com argumento de que ele é \"substancialmente incapaz de administrar os próprios recursos financeiros.\"\n+++LEIA MAIS: O melhor filme de Cher, segundo Tom Hanks: 'Perfeição cinematográfica'\nAlém disso, a ação judicial explica como um tutor para Elijah é \"urgentemente necessário\" para \"protegê-lo contra perdas ou ferimentos,\" porque ele \"atualmente é incapaz de administrar seus bens devido a graves problemas de saúde mental e abuso de substâncias.\" O processo também afirma como Marie Angela King, esposa do filho de Cher, não está apta para a função de tutora porque \"a relação tumultuada deles foi marcada por um ciclo de dependência de drogas e crises de saúde mental.\"\nElijah tem direito a distribuições regulares do patrimônio, mas dados os contínuos problemas de saúde mental e abuso de substâncias, teme que quaisquer fundos distribuídos a Elijah sejam imediatamente gastos em drogas, deixando Elijah sem bens para se sustentar e colocando a vida de Elijah em risco.\nPor fim, o processo conclui como Cher supostamente \"trabalhou incansavelmente para colocar Elijah em tratamento e obter a ajuda de que precisava,\" assim como \"ama imensamente Elijah e sempre agiu com os melhores interesses em mente. \"[A cantora tem sido] incapaz de discutir as preferências em relação à nomeação de um tutor temporário por conta dos atuais problemas de saúde física e mental.\"\n+++LEIA MAIS: Cher se pronuncia sobre exclusão do Rock & Roll Hall of Fame: 'Podem ir tomar naquele lugar'\nComo People relatou, a audiência para uma ordem de tutela temporária está atualmente marcada para o dia 5 de janeiro de 2024, enquanto a audiência para uma ordem permanente ocorrerá cerca de dois meses depois, em 6 de março.",

    "title": "Government of Canada on track to exceed high-speed Internet connectivity targets",
    "text": "Projections show that 98.6% of Canadians will have access to high-speed Internet by 2026\nOTTAWA, ON , Dec. 28, 2023 /CNW/ - No matter where you live, access to reliable, affordable high-speed Internet is essential. That's why the Government of Canada is working with provinces and territories, municipalities, Indigenous communities, and large and small Internet service providers to ensure that all Canadians are connected.\nToday, the Honourable Gudie Hutchings, Minister of Rural Economic Development and Minister responsible for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, updated Canadians on the Government of Canada's progress toward connecting all Canadians, no matter where they live, to high-speed Internet.\nA year of progress Thanks to the $3.225 billion Universal Broadband Fund (UBF), as well as other federal and provincial investments, the federal government is on track to exceed its goal of providing access to high-speed Internet to 98% of Canadian households by 2026 and 100% by 2030. Today, 93.5% of Canadian households have access to high-speed Internet compared to just 79% in 2014. Current projections show that 98.6% of households will have access by 2026.\nSince the launch of the UBF in November 2020 , 295 projects have been announced across Canada . This includes 45 projects in 2023 alone, which will serve more than 200,000 households. In 2023, 40,000 households also gained new access to high-speed Internet through completed UBF projects. The Government of Canada looks forward to announcing more UBF projects through 2024. Projects are posted online as they are announced.\nIn June 2023 , Minister Hutchings launched the government's redesigned website — canada.ca/rural . The interactive website is a source for rural Canadians to find relevant resources and information on Government of Canada programs, including the UBF.\nPartnering for success To help meet connectivity targets faster, the Government of Canada has also entered into co-funding partnerships with Quebec , Ontario , Newfoundland and Labrador , Alberta , British Columbia , and Prince Edward Island . With more than $2 billion in provincial co-funding secured, these partnerships allow for more households to be connected through UBF funding.\nMany provinces have made significant progress toward achieving universal connectivity already. With a total of $920 million in federal-provincial co-funding under Canada–Quebec Operation High Speed, Quebec has achieved our common goal of offering high-speed Internet access to all residents in the province. Many other provinces, including Prince Edward Island , New Brunswick , Ontario , British Columbia and Nova Scotia , are also very close to achieving universal connectivity.\nThe Government of Canada is working closely with all provinces and territories to help connect remaining underserved households. For the latest information on Canada's progress toward achieving universal high-speed Internet access, visit the interactive High-Speed Internet Access Dashboard . The dashboard allows Canadians to track national progress and government funding by province and territory.\nReal results, real progress These investments are making a real difference in peoples' lives, including by enabling them to access health care or expand their businesses.\nIn Iskatewizaagegan No. 39 Independent First Nation , also known as Shoal Lake No. 39 First Nation, community members are benefiting from improved access to reliable high-speed Internet. Residents can now access telehealth services, enabling people to meet with doctors virtually when in-person appointments are not possible. This has been an important benefit to Shoal Lake No. 39 First Nation and has improved residents' quality of life.\nElsewhere, in Port-Menier, Quebec , recent access to high-speed Internet has enhanced the village's tourism industry. Businesses in the community, located on Anticosti Island in the heart of the St. Lawrence, have improved their online visibility and increased their opportunities to market to tourists. Visitors can now enjoy the region's vast wilderness while staying connected to the rest of the world.\nThe work continues Since 2015, the federal government has allocated more than $7.6 billion for improving connectivity across Canada . These investments will level the playing field and ensure rural communities have equal ability to benefit from Internet access. The Government of Canada will continue working with provinces and territories, municipalities, Indigenous communities, and Internet service providers so that all Canadians, no matter where they live, have access to high-speed Internet as fast as possible.\nQuote \"High-speed Internet is no longer a luxury—it's a necessity. Thanks to our government, 93.5% of Canadian households now have access to high-speed Internet, compared to just 79% in 2014. We are on track to surpass our target of providing 98% of Canadians with high-speed Internet access by 2026 and all Canadians by 2030. I will continue to make sure rural Canadians have the access they need to affordable high-speed Internet connectivity.\" – The Honourable Gudie Hutchings, Minister of Rural Economic Development and Minister responsible for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency\nQuick facts Canada's Connectivity Strategy aims to provide all Canadians with access to Internet speeds of at least 50 megabits per second (Mbps) download / 10 Mbps upload. Since 2015, the Government of Canada has allocated $7.6 billion for building or improving broadband Internet infrastructure from coast to coast to coast. The Universal Broadband Fund (UBF) is a $3.225 billion investment by the Government of Canada designed to help provide high-speed Internet access to 98% of Canadians by 2026 and achieve the national target of 100% access by 2030. Of that amount, up to $50 million is allocated for mobile Internet projects that primarily benefit Indigenous people. Today, 93.5% of Canadian households have access to high-speed Internet compared to just 79% in 2014. The High-Speed Internet Access Dashboard is updated on a quarterly basis and allows Canadians to view national progress and government funding by province and territory. The National Broadband Internet Service Availability Map is an interactive tool that allows Canadians to find Internet service providers as well as connectivity projects under way in their area.

    "title": "The wonderful works of God (1) — Sunday Magazine — The Guardian Nigeria News – Nigeria and World News",
    "text": "Our Father in heaven is full of wonders. He is a wonderful God and, therefore, does wonderful things. From the time of creation till now, He is doing wonderful works that are beyond human understanding. Yes, no man can comprehend the works of God. If we reflect on how God made man, you will agree with me that God is a wonder working God. Gen 1:26-27 then God says: “Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth. 27: So, God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them,” (NKJV). The above account is how man was created and made to overseer all other creatures of God. Not only that, God covered man with his glory and the glory of God upon Adam was a wonderful experience until Adam sinned. It was when he sinned that the glory was taken away, then he became naked and shame covered him. This goes to show that no sinner will experience the wonderful works of God, so be warned, do not be a goat amid lambs, do not be Achan in the camp of the Israelites (children of God). Remember, Achan took the accursed things and, therefore, brought reproach to the children of Israel (Josh.7v1, 20-21). Remember, we are still looking at the wonderful works of God. Now, let us delve into the birth of our Saviour Jesus Christ, his virgin birth was wonderful. Before the birth of the Saviour, it was never heard of, that a virgin conceived, but because God is wonderful and does wonderful works, He made it come to pass. Isa 7:14 says: “Therefore, the Lord Himself will give you a sign; behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a Son, and shall call His name Immanuel (NKJV). So God does what no man can do. Even when Jesus Christ was born, devil, knowing that He is the redeemer of the world, plotted to kill him through King Herod, but God in his mysterious and wonderful works, saved him by taking him with his parents to Egypt, till the death of King Herod when God brought them back to Israel. The redemption package is also a wonderful work because a righteous man came and died for an unrighteous people. Romans 5v8 says: “But God commanded his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.” When you think or reason with your human knowledge, intellect or wisdom, you will not understand how one man will die for the sins of the whole world, but God made it possible because He does wonderful works. When we refer to one of our texts above, Acts 10v38: “How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with Holy Ghost and with power, who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil, for God was with him.” Our Lord Jesus Christ went everywhere, healing and delivering as many as were oppressed of the devil because he was anointed with the Holy Ghost and with power. I want you to understand that without the Holy Ghost, you cannot do much as a Christian. Therefore, if you desire to do exploit in the body of Christ, you must be endued with the Holy Ghost. Holy Ghost will give you understanding in the deep things of God. You need to be spiritual to understand the wonderful moves of God. 1 Cor.2v14 says: “But the natural man receives not the things of the spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him, neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned.” You must be spiritual because God is a spirit, and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and truth (Jn4v24). So, the wonderful works of God are in many areas of our lives, spiritually, physically, materially, educationally, among others; there is nowhere that God does not manifest His wonders in our lives, situations or circumstances. Now, I want you to remember that God that does wonders has also given us power to represent him here on earth, and to do the same wonders too. Jn14v12-14, verse 12 says: “Most assuredly, I say to you, he who believes in Me, the works that I do he will do also; and greater works than these he will do, because I go to My Father. 13: And whatever you ask in My name, I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. 14: If you ask anything in My name, I will do it.” The above verses serve as powerful assurance from God that we should go and do the same wonderful works he is doing. In this generation, we are the ambassadors for Christ and if that is the case, we must represent him well. At this juncture, you might be asking, how do we exercise the authority to do wonderful works as God has directed us? Mark 16:15-18 says: “Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. 16: He who believes and is baptised will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned. 17: And these signs will follow those who believe: In My name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new tongues. 18: They will take up serpents; and if they drink anything deadly, it will by no means hurt them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover.” Preaching the word of God is where the power comes, when Jesus Christ was physically present in the world, he went everywhere with his disciples preaching and healing all the people there. The same thing applies to you reading this message, if you will obey the instruction of God and begin to preach the gospel everywhere, you will be empowered to do the wonderful works of God. Acts 8v5-6 says: “Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria and preached Christ unto them. And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.” Philip was able to do exploit because he obeyed the instruction of God “Go ye” and he went. Now the ball is in your court, will you obey? If you obey, you will reap the fruits therefrom. May be you are reading this message, and you have not even given your life to Christ, you will not experience the wonderful works of God in your life, let alone having the power to do exploit. This is another opportunity to work with God and for God; so surrender your life to Him before it is too late. Remember, you are not the owner of your life. It is appointed unto men once to die and after that judgment. What shall it profit you to gain the whole world and at the end, lose your soul or what shall a man give in exchange of his soul? Please make haste, while you still have the opportunity. Tomorrow might be too late, therefore, surrender now for your soul is very important to God.TT 0 Comments [cancel reply](/sunday-magazine/ibru-ecumenical-centre/the-wonderful-works-of-god-1/#respond) You must be logged in to post a comment.
