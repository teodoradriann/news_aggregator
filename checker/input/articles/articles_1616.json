    "text": "Nearly 4,000 campsites across California’s 18 national forests could shut down for part or all of the summer, as the U.S. Forest Service grapples with budget constraints following a federal spending freeze, The New York Times reported. The closures may affect visitor centers and backcountry trails in popular destinations such as Desolation Wilderness near Lake Tahoe and the Mount Whitney area. An internal agency memo cited by The Times warned that some sites could become “unsafe” due to lack of maintenance. Forest Service employees highlighted concerns over essential services, including human waste removal, trail upkeep, and search-and-rescue operations—especially at Mount Whitney, where rescues are frequent. Additionally, Desolation Wilderness lost its last permanent ranger, and other visitor centers may also shut down.",

The warhead did not explode.\nFor reference: Mobile fire groups of the National Guard are created to counter air strikes, specifically for downing missiles and kamikaze drones. Combined with the effective work of air defence units, this enables an increase in the success rate of intercepting aerial targets, thereby preserving infrastructure and the lives of citizens.\nSupport UP or become our patron !\nView comments",
