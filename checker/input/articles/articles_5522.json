    "text": "Brooks Gets Second NBA Shot, Recalled from G League\nNo one said the NBA was going to be easy.\nKeion Brooks, a year removed from the University of Washington basketball team, has received a second call-up this season from the New Orleans Pelicans, leaving the G League as he tries to establish himself at the game's highest level.\nIn early February, the 6-foot-7 Brooks played in two games for the Pelicans while making his NBA debut and then returned to the Birmingham Squadron.\nBrooks, a first-team All-Pac-12 selection and the Huskies' leading scorer at 21.1 points last year, is signed to a two-way contract with the Pelicans that enables him to move back and forth between the NBA and the G League.\nPreviously, he played in games against Denver and Oklahoma City on the road, making his NBA debut on Feb. 5 against the Nuggets, a 144-119 loss. Five days later, he appeared against the Thunder and scored his first career points with 4 in a 137-101 loss.\nOn the college level, Brooks played three seasons for Kentucky and two more for the UW before going undrafted and having to work his way to the NBA the hard way.\nFor Birmingham, he's played in 26 games and averaged 16 points and 6.4 rebounds an outing while shooting 43.8 percent from the floor.\nHe joins a New Orleans team that is 18-51 and currently well out of playoff contention.\nFor the latest UW football and basketball news, go to si.com/college/washington",

    "text": "Rivalidad tecnológica\nOpenAI planea crear un navegador web con IA para competir con Google\nCarles Planas Bou\nSemana de malas noticias para [Google](/tags/google/). Si el miércoles supo que el Departamento de Justicia de Estados Unidos quiere obligarla a vender el negocio de Chrome para acabar con su monopolio, el jueves se filtró que [OpenAI](/tags/openai/), su rival y fabricante de [ChatGPT](/tags/chatgpt/), estudia la posibilidad de desarrollar un navegador web propio para desbancarla.\nSegún publica The Information, la start-up de inteligencia artificial financiada por [Microsoft](/tags/microsoft/) se plantea crear un producto de navegación por Internet que combinaría con su chatbot, si bien esa posibilidad está aún lejos de materializarse.\nCon este movimiento, OpenAI podría tratar de plantar cara a Google. Chrome es el navegador más popular del mundo, pues concentra un 67% de ese mercado, según datos de Statcounter, muy por delante de rivales como Safari, Edge o Firefox. Competir con Google es una misión titánica, pero eso podría cambiar si la justicia estadounidense termina obligando a la compañía a desprenderse de su navegador.\nAmbas noticias han hecho que la capitalización de Google se resienta en bolsa. En las últimas 24 horas, sus acciones se han devaluado un 4,56%.\nBuscador contra Google\nNo es la primera vez que OpenAI reta a Google. A finales de julio, la empresa capitaneada por Sam Altman anunció el lanzamiento de SearchGPT, el prototipo de un motor de búsqueda que se sirve de IA para dar respuesta a las consultas de los usuarios. Un año antes, Microsoft integró esa tecnología en su buscador Bing y en su navegador Edge a través de Copilot, un asistente conversacional que acompaña al usuario durante la navegación web.\nEl dominio de Google en ese campo es aún más abrumador, pues su servicio concentra casi el 90% del mercado mundial de las búsquedas web. Aun así, las maniobras de Microsoft y OpenAI han obligado a Google a mover ficha. A finales de 2023, el gigante tecnológico dirigido por Sundar Pichai lanzó su propio modelo de IA, Gemini, y lo integró a sus servicios para tratar de mejorar las búsquedas y neutralizar a sus rivales.\nOpenAI también está buscando otras fórmulas para ganar terreno a Google. Según The Information, la firma está estudiando la posibilidad de potenciar las funciones de IA en los móviles y tabletas fabricados por la surcoreana Samsung, tradicional socio comercial de Google. En junio, la creadora de ChatGPT anunció una nueva alianza para alimentar los dispositivos de Apple, que cobra unos 12.000 millones de dólares anuales de Google para que su navegador y su buscador estén instalados por defecto.\n[RRSS WhatsApp](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=OpenAI%20planea%20crear%20un%20navegador%20web%20con%20IA%20para%20competir%20con%20Google%20https://www.elperiodicomediterraneo.com/vida-y-estilo/tecnologia/2024/11/22/openai-planea-crear-navegador-web-111938132.html%3Futm_source%3Dwhatsapp%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dbtn-share)\n[RRSS Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.elperiodicomediterraneo.com/vida-y-estilo/tecnologia/2024/11/22/openai-planea-crear-navegador-web-111938132.html%3Futm_source%3Dfacebook%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dbtn-share)\n[RRSS Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?original_referer=https://www.elperiodicomediterraneo.com/vida-y-estilo/tecnologia/2024/11/22/openai-planea-crear-navegador-web-111938132.html&text=OpenAI%20planea%20crear%20un%20navegador%20web%20con%20IA%20para%20competir%20con%20Google%20%20https://www.elperiodicomediterraneo.com/vida-y-estilo/tecnologia/2024/11/22/openai-planea-crear-navegador-web-111938132.html%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dbtn-share%20a%20trav%C3%A9s%20de%20%40epmediterraneo)\n[RRSS email](mailto:?subject=OpenAI%20planea%20crear%20un%20navegador%20web%20con%20IA%20para%20competir%20con%20Google%20&body=https://www.elperiodicomediterraneo.com/vida-y-estilo/tecnologia/2024/11/22/openai-planea-crear-navegador-web-111938132.html%3Futm_source%3Dmail%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dbtn-share)\n[Copiar URL](javascript: void(0))\nNoticia guardada en tu perfil\n[Adiós al registro de jornada con papel y boli: Yolanda Díaz quiere obligar a que Inspección de Trabajo pueda ver los datos en remoto en cualquier momento](https://www.elperiodicomediterraneo.com/sociedad/2024/11/25/adios-registro-jornada-papel-boli-inspeccion-trabajo-dv-111957649.html)[Denuncian que el único policía de Navajas usa su vehículo particular para patrullar porque el oficial no pasa la ITV](https://www.elperiodicomediterraneo.com/comarcas/2024/11/25/denuncian-unico-policia-navajas-vehiculo-112039050.html)[La cesta navideña más solidaria de España vuelve a rifarse en un pueblo de Castellón: ¡255.000 euros en premios!](https://www.elperiodicomediterraneo.com/comarcas/2024/11/26/cesta-navidad-solidaria-grande-espana-castellon-segorbe-255-000-euros-loteria-nacional-gordo-oro-rifa-premio-112036632.html)[Europa avisa de que limpiar ríos agrava las inundaciones, pero en Castellón hay dudas](https://www.elperiodicomediterraneo.com/comarcas/2024/11/24/europa-avisa-limpiar-rios-agrava-inundaciones-111982297.html)[Benicàssim logra desbloquear el plan del nuevo Eurosol tras tres años de trámites](https://www.elperiodicomediterraneo.com/comarcas/2024/11/26/benicassim-plan-nuevo-eurosol-obras-proyecto-costas-castellon-112048722.html)[Esto es lo que cobrarán en 2025 los 3.312 pensionistas de Castellón que perciben la paga máxima](https://www.elperiodicomediterraneo.com/castello-provincia/2024/11/26/cobraran-2025-3-312-pensionistas-112041369.html)[Debate sobre si limpiar cauces o no: Los alcaldes de Castellón optan por un término medio y piden tener más autonomía](https://www.elperiodicomediterraneo.com/comarcas/2024/11/25/debate-limpiar-cauces-alcaldes-inundaciones-111982872.html)[Detienen a un extrabajador por el robo de unos 100.000 euros en una nave industrial de Onda](https://www.elperiodicomediterraneo.com/caso-abierto/sucesos-en-castellon/2024/11/26/detienen-persona-robo-nave-industrial-onda-castellon-112050290.html)",

    "text": "2023-12-28 23:59:33 Until 2027, the Generalitat will invest 2.4 billion euros to guarantee supply, improve the environment and confront drought and the climate emergency. So far, it has already invested 290 million euros to encourage municipalities and agriculture to be more efficient in water management, and 160 million euros to support the countryside. It also plans to expand and build new desalination plants and 174 new treatment plants, as well as doubling the water regeneration stations. In the field of desalination plants, it is planned to double production capacity and go from the current 80 hm3 to 160 in the coming years. This will be possible thanks to the expansion of the Tordera desalination plant, which will go from 20 to 80 hm3 of production capacity, and the construction of a plant at the mouth of the Foix River, with a capacity to produce 20 hm3. Until 2027, the Generalitat will invest 2.4 billion euros to guarantee supply, improve the environment and confront drought and the climate emergency. Currently, work is being done on the modernization of the ETAP del Ter, which is the largest drinking water treatment plant in Catalonia, and on the construction of two water purification plants in the final section of the Besòs. Specifically, in the area of the river as it passes through Montcada and Reixac and between Barcelona, Santa Coloma de Gramenet and Sant Adrià de Besòs, in the areas of Mas Rampinyo and Bon Pastor. The forecast, in the case of ETAP del Ter, is that the works will begin next autumn. The worst drought in 100 years We find ourselves in a drought context which is the worst in the last 100 years, that is, since records have been kept (in 1905). According to the Servei Meteorològic de Catalunya, it is the harshest drought ever experienced in the country and has no signs of regression in the short term. In fact, it has been raining below average for three years. Right now, the drought affects more than half of the territory and no rain is expected in the coming weeks. At this time, water reserves are at 17% of their capacity. Two years ago, the Government launched the Sequera Special Plan, which has made it possible to delay the entry into the emergency situation due to lack of water throughout the territory by one year. Thanks to the plan, it has been possible to generate the water used by all of Catalonia in 8 months. At the same time, the Taula Nacional de l’Aigua has been promoted, which will serve, in the future, to adapt to more frequent droughts. Furthermore, thanks to Catalonia’s Reclaimed Water Reuse Plan, which involves an investment of 126 million euros over four years, Catalonia will reuse the same volume of water that Barcelona needs to supply itself for a year, according to the Minister of Climate Action, David. Mascort. All actions against drought seek, in the words of the counselor, “to provide the system with structural resistance.” The Ter-Llobregat, in pre-emergency Currently, the municipalities of the Ter-Llobregat system, which make up the most populated area in Catalonia, are in a pre-emergency phase due to the drought situation. This means that each inhabitant has limited water consumption to 210 liters per day, including economic and commercial activities. The measure affects 202 municipalities in 14 regions, with almost 6 million inhabitants. At this moment, the average water consumption in Catalonia is 117 liters per inhabitant per day, a figure that is above the WHO recommendation, which is 100 liters. Related news With the entry into force of this phase, all the water savings that occur at home, in economic activities and in sports must serve, according to Mascort, to prolong the entry into the emergency phase, “which would mean applying more serious restrictions “. In the pre-emergence phase, grass irrigation is prohibited in all cases, except on surfaces intended for federated practice of the sport. Only survival irrigation can be done in the trees and private pools for individual or single-family use cannot be filled. Regarding vehicle washing, the car can only be cleaned in commercial establishments dedicated to this activity. How to save water? To extend the entry into the emergency phase, the Government has launched the campaign Water does not fall from the sky, which gives guidelines for saving water at home. Some of them are: showering instead of bathing, turning off the faucet when we brush our teeth or soaping our hands, repairing faucets that leak water, filling the washing machine well to avoid adding more, and flushing the chain by pressing the smallest button. , which is the one that discharges the least water. #Barcelona #area #cover #water #years #investments #Generalitat",

    "title": "4 Distinct Sleep Types Identified, With Unique Impacts on Long-Term Health",
    "text": "Research reveals four key sleep patterns tied to health, stressing the importance of tailored interventions to enhance sleep quality and reduce chronic health risks. Poor sleep habits are strongly associated with long-term chronic health conditions, according to decades of research. To better understand this relationship, a team led by researchers in Penn State’s College of Health and Human Development identified four distinct patterns that characterize how most people sleep. These patterns are also predictive of long-term health, the researchers said. Soomi Lee, associate professor of human development and family studies at Penn State, led a team in identifying these sleep patterns and their correlation to overall health. Their results were published in the journal Psychosomatic Medicine. Using a national sample of adults from the Midlife in the United States study, the team gathered data on approximately 3,700 participants’ sleep habits and their chronic health conditions across two-time points 10 years apart. The data included self-reported sleep habits, including sleep regularity and duration, perceived sleep satisfaction and daytime alertness, as well as the number and type of chronic conditions. Researchers used the data to identify four different sleep patterns. - Good sleepers, who are characterized by optimal sleep habits across all data points. - Weekend catch-up sleepers, who are characterized by irregular sleep, specifically short average sleep duration, but longer sleep times on weekends or non-workdays. - Insomnia sleepers, who are characterized by sleep problems related to clinical insomnia symptoms, including short sleep duration, high daytime tiredness, and a long time to fall asleep. - Nappers, who are characterized by mostly good sleep but frequent daytime naps. Researchers found that more than half of participants were identified as insomnia sleepers or nappers, both of which are suboptimal sleep patterns. Additionally, being an insomnia sleeper over the 10-year period was associated with a significantly higher likelihood of chronic health conditions, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes and depression. Results also showed that people were unlikely to change their sleep pattern over the course of the 10 years. This was especially true for insomnia sleepers and nappers. The MIDUS study may not represent the entire population, researchers said, as it primarily comprises healthy adults, but — despite this — most participants displayed suboptimal insomnia sleeper or napper sleep patterns. “These results may suggest that it is very difficult to change our sleep habits because sleep health is embedded into our overall lifestyle. It may also suggest that people still don’t know about the importance of their sleep and about sleep health behaviors,” Lee said. “We need to make more efforts to educate the public about good sleep health. There are sleep hygiene behaviors that people could do to improve their sleep, such as not using cell phones in bed, exercising regularly and avoiding caffeine in the late afternoon.” While the sleep patterns were seemingly not age-related, researchers found that older adults and retirees were more likely to be nappers. They also found that those with less education and those facing unemployment were more likely to be insomnia sleepers. According to Lee, the fact that phase of life and economic conditions can influence longstanding sleep patterns suggests that societal and neighborhood influences — including economic stressors and access to health resources — may have significant effects on individual health and, in this case, sleep habits. All these findings strongly suggest the need for programs and interventions to promote healthy sleep and sleep habits, the researchers said. The identification of distinct sleep patterns also suggests that these prevention programs should not be one-size-fits-all and can be targeted based on a variety of factors, including the risk of chronic conditions and socioeconomic vulnerability. “Sleep is an everyday behavior,” Lee said. “Sleep is also modifiable, So, if we can improve sleep almost every day, what outcomes might we see after several months, or even several years? Better sleeping habits can make many significant differences, from improving social relationships and work performance to promoting long-term healthy behaviors and healthy aging.” Reference: “10-year Stability of an Insomnia Sleeper Phenotype and Its Association with Chronic Conditions” by Soomi Lee PhD, Claire E.

    "text": "The United Kingdom has significantly escalated its support for Ukraine amid the Russian invasion by announcing a new support package worth 381 million euros to supply over 10,000 drones to the Ukrainian Armed Forces. This announcement was made by Defence Secretary Grant Shapps during his third visit to Ukraine, where he met with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Defence Minister Rustem Umerov to reaffirm the UK's steadfast commitment to Ukraine.\nFollow Army Recognition on Google News at this link\nA soldier from the 21 Air Assault Battery, 32 Royal Artillery Regiment, launches a Puma Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) in 2023 (Picture source: UK MoD )\nThe increased funding, now totaling around €381 million, represents a significant ramp-up from the initial announcement of €234 million made by the Prime Minister in January. It aims to provide a wide range of unmanned platforms, predominantly first-person view (FPV) drones, 1,000 one-way attack drones developed in the UK, as well as surveillance and maritime drones.\nThese new drones, emerging directly from the UK's leading defense industry, are expected to be delivered throughout 2024, bolstering Ukrainian capabilities on the battlefield. According to Shapps, the goal is to arm Ukraine with cutting-edge technology, while also encouraging international partners to support this effort.\nThe effective use of various types of drones by the Ukrainian Armed Forces has already garnered attention, with these devices enabling the destruction and damage of thousands of Russian equipment and vehicles at a significantly lower cost. FPV drones, in particular, have proven effective in circumventing Russian air defenses to hit their targets, providing critical situational awareness to target enemy positions and armored vehicles.\nThis announcement follows a meeting of the US-led Ukraine Defence Contact Group, which brings together over 50 countries providing military support to Ukraine. The UK, in collaboration with Latvia, will lead an international coalition aimed at enhancing Ukraine's drone capabilities.\nThe Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary have both highlighted the importance of rallying international support for Ukraine and last month, the Defence Secretary called on NATO allies to further intensify their commitment during a meeting of the alliance's ministers.\nThis significant contribution from the UK, with an investment of over €117 million in maritime capabilities, aims to continue changing the course of the conflict in the Black Sea in favor of Ukraine.",

    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II [Saleen Martin](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7245115001/saleen-martin/) During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, [online records](https://rafbeaulieu.co.uk/honouring-the-airmen-of-raf-beaulieu/) show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",

    "text": "Axel Allag, Media365, publié le jeudi 28 décembre 2023 à 23h12\nArsenal a manqué l'occasion de reprendre la tête de la Premier League, en s'inclinant face à West Ham (0-2). La soirée n'a pas été plus réussie pour les Spurs de Tottenham, dominés par Brighton (4-2).\nLe résumé de Brighton / Tottenham - Premier League 2023-24 (J19) par CANAL+ Sport\nJeudi soir difficile pour Arsenal et Tottenham . Les joueurs de Mikel Arteta se devaient de gagner afin de reprendre la tête de la Premier League devant Liverpool, qui a battu Burnley mardi (0-2). Sur la pelouse de l'Emirates Stadium, rien n'a tourné dans le bon sens pour les Gunners, très tendres sur le plan offensif, et rarement dans le bon tempo de manière globale. Lors d'un premier acte dominé par les locaux, Alphonse Areola s'est illustré en détournant une tête de Bukayo Saka (30ème) et quelques minutes avant, les Hammers ont ouvert le score avec un peu de réussite. En effet, suite à un centre et une mésentente entre Gabriel et Zinchenko, le ballon a été dégagé mais, avant que ce dernier ne sorte sur le côté de la cage de Raya, Bowen l'a repris pour trouver Soucek dans les 6 mètres (0-1, 13ème). Le but a été validé après intervention du VAR et mettait alors les Gunners dans l'embarras.\nJuste avant la mi-temps, sur un service de Martin Odegaard, Saka a trouvé le poteau (42ème) et en seconde période, le cauchemar a continué pour Arsenal. Après 10 minutes de jeu, West Ham a doublé la mise grâce à la tête décroisée de Mavropanos, le ballon touchant la transversale et le poteau avant de finir dans les filets (0-2, 55ème). Trop brouillon dans ses offensives, Arsenal n'a jamais semblé en mesure de véritablement revenir, malgré de nombreuses tentatives et en fin de match, Saïd Benrahma a pu se permettre de rater un penalty pour les visiteurs (90ème+6). Les Gunners se situent donc à la 2ème position, voyant Liverpool au sommet avec 2 points d'avance.\nUn peu plus tôt ce jeudi, Tottenham s'est aussi pris les pieds dans le tapis, manquant l'opportunité d'intégrer le top 4 en s'inclinant à Brighton (4-2) . Certes, Richarlison a touché le poteau et s'est vu refuser 2 buts pour hors-jeu mais les Spurs ont été en-dessous d'un Brighton en feu. D'abord, Hinshelwood a ouvert le score (1-0,12ème) avant que Joao Pedro ne s'offre un doublé sur penalty (23ème, 76ème). Dans l'intervalle, Estupinan a inscrit un but via un tir tendu en lucarne (63ème). La réaction des Spurs, avec les réalisations de Veliz (82ème) et Davies (86ème) a été trop tardive pour un Tottenham défait et toujours aussi irrégulier. Les joueurs de Roberto De Zerbi, eux, sont à 6 points de leur victime du soir, à la 8ème position.",

    "text": "(The Center Square) – New charter schools in Arizona are expected to be developed as a result of new federal taxpayer funding from the United States Department of Education.\nThe state received a $34.8 million cut of the over $143 million awarded through the Expanding Opportunities Through Quality Charter Schools Program. Although the funding came from fiscal year 2024, it will be doled out in portions each year through 2029. The first two years will have a roughly $8.7 million budget, roughly $10 million in year three, and $5 million and $2.8 million in years four and five, respectively.\nSuperintendent of Public Instruction Tom Horne said the funds will go toward creating more charter schools in areas where students are “educationally disadvantaged.”\n“I am extremely pleased that we have received this federal grant that will create 24 new high-quality charter schools and help another 23 existing schools with models and practices that result in academic growth. I want to commend the department staff who competed for this funding. Their work has resulted in the state receiving the largest recipient of this grant, per capita, in the country,” Horne stated.\n“Arizona is the leader in the country on school choice and charters are a major component of that. These dollars will serve a vital purpose in making sure that an estimated 10,000 students in traditionally underserved areas will have a chance to select a high-quality charter school. Every student in every part of our state, urban or rural, rich or poor, deserves this opportunity and I am very pleased to be a part of this effort.”\nThere are roughly 560 charter schools in the Grand Canyon State with an about 231,000 students enrolled, according to the Arizona Charter Schools Association . State law requires Arizona schools to be “open enrollment,” making charter schools a relatively common option for some families in the state.\nThe California Department of Education, Colorado League of Charter Schools, New York State Education Department, Utah Association of Public Charter Schools and Rhode Island Department of Education also received grant funding from the program this year. New York and California got the highest amounts with $121 million and $94 million, respectively.",
