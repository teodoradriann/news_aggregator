    "text": "Green move: Plastic collection units come up in PU market In a ‘go green’ move, plastic collection units have been set up at two junctions in the market on the Panjab University (PU) campus. In addition, special benches, ‘Bench of Dreams’, made of recycled plastic waste have been set up at the entrance of the Department of Zoology so as to encourage students to dump plastic waste at the two booths. The university campus is one of the places in the city where plastic material is used in heavy quantity. Last month, Prof (Dr) Renu Vig, Vice-Chancellor, PU, had signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for the ‘Bottles for Change’ initiative on the campus in association with Bisleri International Private Limited. “Owing to biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation, plastic pollution threatens human health. The units have been set up under the ‘Bottles for Change’ initiative with an aim to sensitise the youth towards efficient disposal and recycling of plastic. Plastic pollution comes from improper disposal only. We are committed to make the PU plastic free and here it is as good as more bang for your buck as the discarded material is constructively processed for making usable products, including benches,” said Prof Vig. Dr Anuj Kumar, coordinator, Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan, PU, added, “The notion behind this revolutionary initiative under the MoU is to promote plastic segregation among the citizenry. Plastic deposit containers have been placed at different locations on the PU campus to ensure a ‘sustainable future’ for the coming generations. Students and staff can put the waste plastic in these containers, which will be recycled productively and thus eradicate the menace of plastic on the campus.” “This is a welcome initiative and students should be made aware of it. Apart from the campus market, the collection units should be set up at the Student Centre and hostels too,” said Preeti, a student.",

    "text": "WASHINGTON, DC, UNITED STATES, December 29, 2023 /\nEINPresswire.com/ -- The Middle East Christian Committee condemns those in the government of Lebanon who would take legal action against Christian religious leaders for meeting Israel’s President Herzog in the Holy Land on the occasion of the New Year on December 21. The traditional meeting drew the expected criticism from leaders of Hezbollah: \"The image provoked me because there cannot be a religious figure worshiping God, believing in justice and right, aligning themselves with Israel, tyranny, and colonialism,\" stated Sadek Naboulsi, a religious sheikh close to Hezbollah, who accused anyone meeting an Israeli of \"treason.\"\nThe minister of information Ziad Makari stated: “I was bothered by the image of the two bishops with the Israeli president, and I definitely do not agree to it, and I contacted the military court judges which has the texts related to contact with the Israeli enemy.”\nAl Ahed, a news site with ties to Hezbollah, reported that a collective of Representatives of Released Prisoners and Detainees submitted a request to the Lebanese judiciary to open an investigation against Archbishops al-Hage and Semaan, accusing them of “having contact with the Zionist [Israeli] enemy,” an offence which can carry a sentence of death.\nRadical Islamists seek to separate Christians from their Jewish brethren who follow the original religion of Jesus and even go so far as to claim Jesus was not Jewish at all. In this way, they seek to isolate Israel from the rest of the world.\nRepresentatives of Hamas, who on October 7, carried out the bloody massacre and kidnapping of Israeli civilians - the worst atrocity committed against Jews since the Holocaust - claim to have been “shocked by the photo of Christian dignitaries from the occupied Palestinian territories meeting the president of the Zionist entity on the occasion of Christmas.”\nThe relentless Muslim persecution of Christians and Jews in the Holy Land continues. Bethlehem, located in Palestinian-controlled territory, has seen a precipitous decline in its Christian population, which was once the majority in the birthplace of Jesus, but now comprises only 12% of the population. Jews, who were once found in substantial numbers across the Middle East were driven out of all the Arab states after the creation of Israel in 1948, and Christians are likewise being “ethnically cleansed” from the Muslim regions. The one exception where the Christian population is growing is in Israel.\nArchbishop Hage denied participating in the meeting himself, but also\npointed out: “[T]he patriarchs and bishops who took part in this event conveyed a message related to the cause they defend, and they clearly denounced the military actions in Palestine.”\n“The US Congress should condition any future aid to the Lebanese government to this issue,” said MECHRIC Director John Hajjar. “It is inhuman to threaten to imprison the Christian clergies in Lebanon who are simply serving their dioceses in Israel and coordinating with the Israeli government on behalf of the Christians of Israel.”\n\"This is a pattern in Lebanon,” stated MECHRIC Director Tom Harb. “The military court is an instrument used by Hezbollah to silence any criticism of Hezbollah or Iran in Lebanon.”\nThe Middle East Christian Committee stands with the archbishops and the other Christian leaders seeking peace in the region and applaud their refusal to be intimidated by those pushing for war.\nRebecca Bynum\nAmerican Mideast Coalition for Democracy\n+1 615-775-6801\n[[email protected]]https://kalkinemedia.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\nVisit us on social media:",

    "text": "[Jakkar Aimery](/staff/5652546001/jakkar-aimery/) A winter weather advisory will be in effect all day Friday for most of southern and mid-Michigan with two to four inches of snow forecast, creating hazardous travel conditions, the National Weather Service said. The advisory is in effect from 6 a.m. Friday through midnight, warning that snow accumulations and a mix of rain were expected in Shiawassee, Genesee, Lapeer, St. Clair, Livingston, Oakland and Macomb counties. Saginaw, Bay and Midland counties could see up to 7 inches of snow. Trent Frey, a meteorologist with the weather service in White Lake Township, said a low-pressure system forming in the Midwest was expected to \"bring this plume of snow across the Great Lakes region,\" but would be moving out by late Friday. \"Starting at 6 a.m., we'll see the lead edge of the snow work in; there could be a lull during the mid-day period, but then we expect another round of precipitation move in during the evening into the late evening hours before the snow tapers off,\" Frey told The Detroit News on Thursday. Southern parts of Metro Detroit could see 1-2 inches, whereas northern areas could see 2-3 inches, said Frey, who added that snow this time of year is not unusual during the transition period from winter into the spring months. \"Most Marches, we do see a bit of snow,\" he said. \"So far this month, we've only seen .4 inches of snow; normally up to this point, we see about 5 inches.\" Temperatures Friday though Sunday were expected to top out near 39 in Metro Detroit, the weather service said. Temperatures were predicted to climb Monday with highs in the mid-upper 50s, Frey added. Average readings around this time of year are highs around 48 and lows near 30, Frey said.",

    "text": "M uchas zonas del mundo están azotadas estos días por varios frentes que han provocado una caída importante de las temperaturas. Como en España, en Reino Unido se han visto afectados estos días por la tormenta Gerrit y, a su paso, ha dejado sin electricidad a varios hogares de Escocia y, en Londres, los aviones han tenido verdaderos problemas para aterrizar en el aeropuerto de Heathrow.\nEl frente ha estado marcado por las fuertes rachas de viento de 128 km/h y precipitaciones que han provocado, entre otros muchos desperfectos, el corte de la electricidad, algo que ha afectado a cerca de 14.000 casas en Escocia. A ello se suman casas con destrozos y el caos en las líneas de tren, según informa ABC News.\nLos expertos, como Met Office, alertaron del paso de la tormenta el pasado miércoles y avisaron de la llegada de un pequeño tornado que provocó daños en más de un centenar de casas. Se espera, además, que esta situación climatológica se mantenga hasta el lunes 1 de enero y llegue a inundar ríos de West Midlands, Yorkshire y Humber.\nEl peligroso aterrizaje en Heathrow que pone los pelos de punta Una de las imágenes más impactantes de Gerrit en Reino Unido quedó en Londres, más concretamente en el aeropuerto de Heathrow . En redes sociales se han hecho virales los instantes previos y posteriores al aterrizaje de uno de los miles de aviones que sobrevuelan el espacio aéreo británico.\nEn uno de los más impactantes, se observa cómo el aparato se aproxima a la pista y, al descender, comienza a inclinarse hacia una de sus alas , provocando que esté muy cerca de chocar con ella en la pista. Por suerte, no hubo que lamentar incidentes, más allá de decenas de vuelos cancelados y momentos como este de mucho pánico.",

    "text": "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, July 12. Our brotherhood\nis based on deep feelings between our peoples towards each other,\nwhich go back to centuries, President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev\nsaid during a press statement with Prime Minister of the Islamic\nRepublic of Pakistan Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif,\nTrend reports.\n\"This connection is a big asset. And today brotherly relations between Pakistan and Azerbaijan are based on this foundation. We are brothers, we are friends. We support each other on every issue on every international case, in every international institution. When it comes to the case, which we introduce, our brothers support us and the same vice versa.\nOur straightforward support on the issue of Jammu and Kashmir is our commitment to our brotherhood and also our respect to international law. The rights of Kashmiris are ignored and violated for decades. United Nations Security Council resolutions clearly indicate how this issue must be resolved. But unfortunately, United Nations Security Council resolutions have no mechanism of implementation. But we, as brothers and friends, will always stand side by side with you, with our brothers in Kashmir, with international law, with justice.

    "title": "Trump pledges to defend Christianity against the left, which he says wants 'to tear down crosses' - The San Diego Union-Tribune",
    "text": "Former President Donald Trump promised to use a second term in the White House to defend Christian values and even suggested he'd shield the faith's central iconography, warning a convention of religious broadcasters on Thursday night that the left wants “to tear down crosses.” “Remember, every communist regime throughout history has tried to stamp out the churches, just like every fascist regime has tried to co-opt them and control them. And, in America, the radical left is trying to do both,\\\" Trump told hundreds of cheering attendees at the National Religious Broadcasters International Christian Media Convention in Nashville. “They want to tear down crosses where they can, and cover them up with social justice flags,” Trump added. “But no one will be touching the cross of Christ under the Trump administration, I swear to you.” Pledging protections for the symbol of Christianity recalled the former president recently telling the National Rifle Association, \\\"No one will lay a finger on your firearms.” It also comes as leading conservatives have increasingly called on the Trump to openly build his second term around Christian values, should he win. Trump is favored in a Republican primary where the once crowded field has dwindled to just him and his former ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley. The Christian media gathering, where sponsors distributed free red and white baseball caps emblazoned with “Make America Pray Again,” was exceedingly friendly territory for the former president, whose address often felt more like a rally than a staid convention speech. “The left is trying to shame Christians,\\\" Trump said. \\\"They’re trying to shame us. I’m a very proud Christian.” Trump brought the crowd to its feet repeatedly and frequently championed his record on abortion, including appointing three conservative Supreme Court justices who helped overturn the Roe v. Wade decision. But he notably didn't mention the Alabama Supreme Court ruling that has prompted providers there to pause in vitro fertilization after justices ruled that frozen embryos could be considered children under state law. President Joe Biden 's reelection campaign released a blank statement on the matter late Thursday, ironically calling attention to Trump's lack of reaction on the \\\"Alabama IVF ruling he is responsible for.” Instead, Trump used his speech to boast that he had used his first term to do “more to uphold religious freedom than any administration in history.” “The enthusiasm for this election coming up in November is far greater than it was in 2016 or 2020,\\\" he said. \\\"Far greater, it’s not even a contest.” Tennessee holds its primary on Super Tuesday, March 5, when many states around the country vote and could move Trump to the cusp of claiming the Republican nomination. Some religious leaders were initially hesitant to get behind multi-divorcee Trump when he first ran for president in 2016, but now they are among his mostly solidly loyal “Make America Great Again” base. That's despite a personal history that has only gotten more checkered in recent years, including Trump being indicted in New York in connection with hush money payments made to a porn actress in an attempt to suppress an extramarital affair. “When he came onto the scene, people were skeptical,” said Troy Miller, president and CEO of the National Religious Broadcasters. “But I think, as they’ve learned more and listened to Donald Trump speak, the one thing I hear all the time from people ... is that they really feel like Donald Trump understands them and that’s the biggest connection that people make is, ‘This is a guy in politics who gets us, who understands us, who doesn’t talk like he’s an elitist and talk down to us.’”",
