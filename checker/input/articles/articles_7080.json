    "text": "CoinShares makes history, first to secure MiCA license for crypto management. Triple license status positions CoinShares as Europe’s trusted crypto asset manager. Mognetti says MiCA license proves crypto must operate under clear rules. CoinShares has just made history in the European crypto industry. The well-known European cryptocurrency investment firm has secured a new license under the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation, also known as MiCA. CoinShares said on Wednesday that it was granted this license under its French affiliate, CoinShares Asset Management.\nFirm Holds Rare Triple License: AIFM, MiFID, and Now MiCA This is not a normal license. It places CoinShares as the initial controlled crypto asset manager in continental Europe with MiCA. This massive move provides CoinShares with a combination of three big licences. There is AIFM License, MiFID License, and now MiCA Authorisation.\nCoinShares has an AIFM License, which permits the management of alternative investment funds. The MiFID License enables the company to provide portfolio management and advice on the regular financial assets. Currently, the MiCA license includes the right to administer and provide advice concerning crypto-assets as well.\nIt implies that CoinShares will be able to provide professional services to manage crypto assets legally in the EU. It already operates in France, Germany, Cyprus, Ireland, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta and the Netherlands. In the near future, the company will have more presence in the EU countries.\nThis emerging license addresses one of the biggest issues of the crypto investment sphere in Europe. Most crypto platforms have termed themselves asset managers without the appropriate licenses. They lacked clear regulations on the separation of important functions such as custody, trading and portfolio management. However, CoinShares is now one of the companies that do it right.\nJean-Marie Mognetti, Co-Founder, and CEO of CoinShares, expressed his opinion on this huge news. According to him, the MiCA authorization is a great step forward both to CoinShares and the rest of the crypto industry. Over the years, crypto managers have been required to operate under less or no rules. MiCA gives a single, unambiguous framework to all EU countries now.\nCoinShares Approval Builds Trust for Big Institutions Entering Crypto Mognetti believes this license shows that crypto is here to stay. He believes that it must be controlled under robust, well-defined regulations to safeguard investors. CoinShares being a public company, had always been a believer in good governance and clear rules. Its new license now supports that belief with actual legal force.\nBy getting this approval, CoinShares is now able to provide services to clients that require a regulated counterparty. Most major investors and institutions need this kind of control before they can deal with crypto. The position of CoinShares will contribute to the expansion of confidence in crypto as a valid investment option.\nThe milestone is achieved when CoinShares continues to expand all around the world. It has recently acquired Valkyrie Funds in the US. The transaction demonstrated the intentions of CoinShares to move outside of Europe. The new MiCA license gives it an extra boost in its EU strategy and assists it in catering to the increasing demand in trusted crypto services.\nCoinShares claims that it will continue to operate in a robust regulatory environment. The company will be the first to integrate crypto innovation and smart regulations, and investor protection. Having MiCA , other asset managers can now walk in the footsteps of CoinShares.\nOther companies can also attempt to have their MiCA authorization in the next few months. However, at the moment, CoinShares is the first to establish this new norm. European investors will pay attention to what will ensue. CoinShares has paved the way to professional crypto asset management; that is right.",

Le chanteur a fait des révélations sur la saison 3 de sa fiction.\nLe jeudi soir, c'est Panda sur TF1 ! Depuis le 9 janvier 2025, TF1 propose la saison 2 inédite de la série avec Julien Doré, au rythme de deux premiers épisodes inédits par semaine, puis un seul depuis le jeudi 23 janvier 2025. Une saison placée sous le signe de l’amour, comme le révélait Julien Doré en Une de Télé Loisirs. \"En essayant de ne pas être trop cul-cul, nous avons souhaité injecter dans chaque rôle cet amour et cette tendresse qui, selon moi, sont les contre-pieds absolus de notre époque\", expliquait le chanteur dans notre magazine. Mais toutes les bonnes choses ont une fin.\nPanda : Un final avec Stanislas Carmont des Rencontres du Papotin et Un p’tit truc en plus\nCe jeudi 30 janvier 2025, TF1 diffuse donc le sixième et dernier épisode inédit de la saison 2 de Panda à partir de 21h15. Un épisode marqué par la présence de Stanislas Carmont découvert dans les Rencontres du Papotin, le magazine de France 2 dans lequel il interviewe les personnalités et passé à la postérité avec son rôle au côté d’Artus dans le film à succès Un p’tit truc en plus. Dans ce final, le comédien, diagnostiqué autiste à l'âge de 8 ans interprète un cuisinier aux côtés de Philippe Duquesne, ancien membre de la troupe des Deschiens, dans le rôle d'un chef plus taiseux. Mais qu'en est-il de la suite ? Les fans de Panda risquent d'être un poil déçus.\nPanda : Une saison 3 \"n'est pas dans les tuyaux\", selon Julien Doré\nÀ la question du Midi Libre \"Est-ce qu'il y aura une saison 3 de Panda ?\", Julien Doré n'y va pas par quatre chemins. \"Ce n'est pas dans les tuyaux\", répond l'artiste qui commence sa tournée le 1er mars 2025, à Aix-en-Provence. \"Là, ce qui m'attend c'est ma tournée, déjà 60 Arena et Zénith prévus sans doute jusqu’à début 2026. Il n’y a que ça dans ma tête, retrouver sur scène le public et lui proposer un show de folie pendant deux heures, pour qu’il prenne du plaisir, j’ai tellement hâte !\".

    "title": "General Ogolla: Gallant officer rose to the top of Defence Forces - The Standard",
    "text": "Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) General Francis Ogolla, who died in a helicopter crash in Elgeyo Marakwet yesterday, was a decorated military man, credited for his professionalism and exceptional educational background. While announcing the sad news last evening, President William Ruto described Gen Ogolla’s death, and that of nine other officers as “a moment of great sadness” for him and for the nation. “Our motherland has lost one of her most valiant generals. We have also lost gallant officers, service men and women... A distinguished four-star general has fallen in the course of duty and in the service of country,” Ruto said after a meeting of the National Security Council at State House, Nairobi. He announced three days of national mourning, during which the Kenyan, KDF and East African Community flags, as well as those of all military formations, shall fly at half mast in Kenya and at all her foreign missions abroad. Gen Ogolla met his death while on official duty, visiting troops that are part of the Operation Maliza Uhalifu in the North Rift, where he also inspected school rebuilding projects. The cause of the chopper crash was not immediately established, with President Ruto saying that the Kenya Airforce had dispatched a team to investigate it. Gen Ogolla’s passing was as shocking to the nation as it was to his family, which was planning to celebrate the 100th birthday of Gen Ogolla’s father. His daughter Lorna Omodi Ogolla, who works with Google Data Centers in the US, eulogised him as “the most empathetic and effective leader and statesman”, who cherished the responsibility of keeping Kenya safe. “One day I shall tell beautiful stories of how he taught with his actions and not with his words,” she said in a LinkedIn post. Appointed CDF in April last year, the four-star general held key military leadership roles, rising to occupy the KDF’s ultimate role. An expert in imagery intelligence, counter-terrorism and accident investigation, the dedicated soldier took as much pride in defending the nation as he did in building future heroes, hence his active participation as a trainer in different capacities. “Previously he has held various appointments in Training, Command and Staff including Deputy Commander of the Kenya Air Force (KAF), Base Commander of Laikipia Air Base, Commanding Officer of Tactical Fighter Wing, Chief Flying Instructor at Kenya Air Force Flying Training School and Operations Desk Officer at Kenya Air Force Headquarters,” reads part of the 61-year-old’s Ministry of Defence’s public bio. “Gen Francis O Ogolla is a graduate of ÉcoleMilitaire de Paris and (the) National Defence College of Kenya. He holds a Diploma both in International Studies and Military Science from Egerton University, a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science, Armed Conflict and Peace Studies (First Class Honors) and Masters of Arts in International Studies from the University of Nairobi,” it adds of a man whose hobbies are listed as reading and golfing. The 11th military chief’s journey in service began 40 years ago. Swelling with patriotism, a young Ogolla, in his early 20s, enlisted in the KDF. His love for flying would show early on, and he was commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant in 1985 and posted to the KAF. Stay informed. Subscribe to our newsletter He would train as a fighter pilot with the United States Air Force and later as an instructor pilot with the KAF. The talented soldier would rise through the ranks and serve as co-chair of the Association of African Air Chiefs between 2018 and 2019. Signs that he was destined for greatness were always evident and became clearer when he became a Major General and was appointed the KAF Commander in 2018. This appointment placed him in line to achieve what many in the service dream of and former President Uhuru Kenyatta would later promote him to vice CDF, deputising former CDF Gen (Rtd) Robert Kibochi. The late CDF was next in line courtesy of a rotational framework established by former military chief Gen (Rtd) Daudi Tonje, more famous as the ‘Tonje rules’. Kibochi, a Kenya Army man, was to hand over to a KAF officer. Former CDF Gen (Rtd) Samson Mwathethe, served in the Kenya Navy. Ogolla’s rise to the military’s highest office should have never been in doubt, but in the early days of Ruto’s tenure, many had questioned whether Ogolla, then the KDF vice CDF, would take up the service’s leadership. It had everything to do with the controversial August 2022 presidential election and a scathing Supreme Court petition that thrust him into the limelight. President Ruto, his battery of lawyers and electoral commissioners would accuse Gen Ogolla of being part of an alleged plan to “overturn” Ruto’s election. Although the Supreme Court dismissed the allegations as it could not make substantive findings, the matter has cropped up in several instances. Similarly, no legal steps have been taken in line with the said claims, with different persons peddling narratives. When Kibochi hung up his boots, many speculated that Ogolla, the natural heir, would be sidestepped. But as the Head of State later admitted, the general’s illustrious career made him the most qualified and most deserving of the job. “I assessed your background, where you have come from, what you have done - your journey in the military, and I am satisfied that you merit the office,” Ruto said when he appointed him last year. Despite their initial friction, there have been no apparent differences between Ruto and Gen Ogolla, who has also seemed to enjoy chemistry with Defence Cabinet Secretary Aden Duale, making joint appearances at different functions. He assumed office amid a renewed push by the government to counter bandits in the troubled Rift Valley region, which saw the KDF deployed alongside the Kenya Police Service. Indeed, success in the operation would help shape the legacy of the military chief who was to attain the retirement age of 62 next year. His active military role has also involved overseas duty, serving as an Observer and Military Information Officer in the former Yugoslavia from 1992 to 1993. Described as humble, Ogolla served as chairman of the Military Christian Fellowship from 1994 to 2004. His death, barely a year since his appointed, makes him the shortest-serving military chief in Kenya’s history. The late general is survived by his wife Aileen Ogolla, with whom he has two children and a grandson.",

The [weather](https://www.gloucestershirelive.co.uk/all-about/weather) warnings mean flooding is expected, act now, and are in place along the River Severn between Gloucester and Tewkesbury. The warnings come ahead of a [severe weather warning for wind](https://www.gloucestershirelive.co.uk/news/cheltenham-news/met-office-issues-severe-weather-9002993) that has been issued for Saturday and Sunday. Heavy rain is also forecast in the county while a weather warning for rain has been issued by the [Met Office](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/) for Wales over the weekend, which could put extra pressure on Gloucestershire rivers in days to come. The four warning areas in Gloucestershire are for the Severn at Abbots Court, Deerhurst; Apperley and The Leigh; Chaceley and Haw Bridge; Severn Ham, Tewkesbury. Flood warnings are also in force on the River Wye from Hereford to Ross-on-Wye; North Hereford; and South Hereford.

Flood defences are being checked by its staff. People are urged to avoid using low lying footpaths near local watercourses and plan driving routes to avoid low lying roads near rivers, which may be flooded. River peaks could be as late as Monday.
