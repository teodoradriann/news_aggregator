However, the expenses linked to home renovations can vary greatly, influenced by factors such as the project’s scale, choice of materials, and geographical location. For instance, in Chicago, the cost of a comprehensive bathroom remodel ranges from $16,500 to upwards of $69,000. This wide range reflects the diverse options available to homeowners, particularly when considering eco-friendly remodeling. Eco-friendly home remodeling is not only beneficial for the environment but can also be cost-effective in the long run. This article focuses on six insightful tips for homeowners looking to remodel their homes in an eco-conscious and budget-friendly manner.\n- Sustainable Material Choices\nOne of the pillars of eco-friendly remodeling is the use of sustainable materials. These materials are not only better for the environment but often offer improved durability and aesthetic appeal. Bamboo flooring, for instance, is a popular sustainable option that is both stylish and highly renewable. Recycled glass countertops add a unique touch to kitchens and bathrooms while promoting recycling.\nReclaimed wood is another excellent choice, bringing a rustic charm and history to any space while reducing the demand for new timber. These materials can often be more cost-effective in the long run, as they are designed to last longer and maintain their appearance over time. By opting for sustainable materials, homeowners contribute to a reduction in environmental impact and support the growing market for eco-friendly products.\n- Collaborating with Efficient Contractors\nChoosing the right contractor is crucial for ensuring an eco-friendly home remodeling project. Working with a\nHome Remodeling Company in Chicago that specializes in efficient and sustainable practices can be a game-changer. Such companies, known for their expertise in roofing, siding, window services, etc., can provide invaluable guidance on selecting sustainable materials and implementing energy-efficient designs. They understand the importance of balancing environmental responsibility with the homeowner’s budget and aesthetic preferences.\nThese eco-conscious contractors can advise on the best practices for reducing energy consumption and minimizing waste during the remodeling process. They often have access to a network of suppliers who offer recycled or sustainably sourced materials. By choosing a contractor who prioritizes eco-friendly practices, homeowners can ensure their remodeling project aligns with their values of sustainability and environmental stewardship.\n- Energy-Efficient Windows and Insulation\nUpgrading to energy-efficient windows and improving insulation are critical steps in an eco-friendly home remodel. These improvements are designed to significantly reduce energy consumption, thereby lowering utility bills and contributing to a more sustainable household. Energy-efficient windows, such as double-glazed or low-emissivity (low-E) windows, help maintain a consistent temperature inside the home, reducing the need for excessive heating or cooling.\nProper insulation is equally important in preventing heat loss during colder months and heat gain during warmer months. This can be achieved through various means, such as adding insulation to walls, attics, and basements and sealing any gaps or leaks. While the upfront cost of these upgrades can be significant, the long-term savings in energy bills and the positive impact on the environment make them a wise investment for any eco-friendly remodeling project.\n- Utilizing Low VOC and Natural Paints\nIn\neco-friendly home remodeling, the choice of paint plays a significant role. Low Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) and natural paints are an excellent choice for homeowners looking to reduce their environmental impact. Traditional paints often contain chemicals that can release harmful gases into the air, affecting both indoor air quality and the environment. Low VOC and natural paints, on the other hand, are formulated to minimize these emissions, providing a healthier option for both the home and the planet.\nThese paints come in a wide range of colors and finishes, allowing homeowners to achieve their desired aesthetic without compromising on health or environmental standards. Additionally, they are durable and long-lasting, often providing better coverage and requiring fewer touch-ups over time. By opting for these eco-friendly paint options, homeowners can ensure a safer living environment while contributing to the reduction of harmful emissions.\n- Water Conservation Strategies\nWater conservation is a key aspect of eco-friendly home remodeling. With the growing awareness of the importance of conserving water, more homeowners are implementing strategies to reduce water usage in their homes. One effective approach is the installation of low-flow fixtures in bathrooms and kitchens. These fixtures are designed to reduce water flow without compromising performance, leading to significant savings in water usage.\nAnother option is the installation of efficient toilets, which use less water per flush compared to traditional models. Homeowners can also consider setting up greywater systems, which recycle water from sinks, showers, and washing machines for use in gardening and other non-potable purposes. These water conservation measures not only help in reducing the environmental footprint of the home but also lead to considerable savings in water bills.\n- Smart Home Automation for Efficiency\nThe integration of smart home technologies is a growing trend in eco-friendly home remodeling. Smart home automation systems enable homeowners to optimize energy usage, thereby enhancing efficiency and reducing environmental impact. Smart thermostats are a prime example, allowing homeowners to control heating and cooling systems remotely and adjust temperatures based on occupancy and time of day.\nIn addition to thermostats, smart lighting systems can be programmed to turn off automatically when rooms are unoccupied, and energy monitors can provide real-time feedback on electricity usage, helping homeowners identify areas where they can reduce consumption. These\ntechnologies not only make homes more comfortable and convenient but also contribute to a more sustainable lifestyle by minimizing energy waste.\nConclusion\nEco-friendly home remodeling is an impactful way to enhance your living space while being mindful of the environment. From choosing the right contractor and sustainable materials to implementing energy-efficient upgrades, low VOC paints, water conservation strategies, and smart home technologies, each of these six tips offers a practical approach to creating a more sustainable home. By embracing these eco-friendly practices, homeowners can enjoy a modern, comfortable, and environmentally responsible living space. This approach to remodeling not only benefits the planet but also provides long-term cost savings and a healthier living environment, making it a wise choice for any homeowner.\nPeople & Lifestyle\nHollard Ghana is the Best Organisation in Rewards Management Practice at the HR Focus Conference and Awards\nHollard Ghana, the country’s favourite insurer with subsidiaries Hollard Insurance and Hollard Life, has earned a prestigious “Best Organisation in Rewards Management Practice” at the HR Focus Conference and Awards.

The team met with the Chiefs and Community Leaders, the Member of Parliament for North Tongu, Hon. Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa, and affected families to interact with them.\nMr. Dominic Donkoh, the Chief Risk Officer of the Bank, in presenting the items to the Chiefs, Queenmothers, and the affected people, stated, ‘This is a CSR initiative by our staff who believe that the people of Aveyime-Battor deserve our support during this challenging time. We understand the hardships faced by the residents due to the Akosombo Dam Spillage, and it is our duty as a responsible corporate citizen to extend a helping hand.’\nHe further emphasized the Bank’s commitment to the community’s well-being and highlighted that the SEEK Initiative is not just a one-time effort but an ongoing commitment to making a positive impact on lives.\nThe Chief of Battor, Torgbe Manklalo Borbordzi VII, expressed heartfelt appreciation to OmniBSIC Bank and its staff for their timely intervention. He stated, ‘The generosity shown by OmniBSIC Bank staff is a testament to their dedication to community development. This support will go a long way in easing the challenges faced by our people during this difficult period.’\nThe Member of Parliament, Hon. Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa, also commended OmniBSIC Bank for its swift response and community-focused approach. He noted that the essential items donated would meet the practical needs of the people. He recognized the Bank’s tagline, ‘At Your Service,’ which is in line with its commitment to serving the people of Aveyime-Battor.\nThe OmniBSIC SEEK Initiative\nThe OmniBSIC Bank Supporting Communities through Engagement, Empathy & Kindness (SEEK) project is driven by the dedication and compassion of staff. This initiative is a pivotal part of the broader OmniBSIC CSR program.\nThrough the SEEK Initiative, OmniBSIC staff generously volunteer their time, skills, and resources to support various projects to improve the lives of the communities.\nPeople & Lifestyle\nWorkplace gender policy key to combating sexual harassment, revolutionary efforts underway, experts unite to tackle sexual harassment and gender-based violence\nAdvocates with expertise in Sexual and Gender-Based Violence (SGBV) have come together to address the critical need for strong workplace gender policies focused on eliminating sexual harassment. This collective commitment comes as a response to the pervasive yet often underreported nature of workplace harassment, emphasizing the urgent need for organizations to prioritize comprehensive gender policies to cultivate safe and inclusive work environments.\nThey were speaking during the recently held national conference at the Labadi Beach Hotel organized by OXFAM and the Institute of Directors, Ghana (IoD-GH) on the topic ‘The Draft Model; Gender Workplace Policy’ as part of the agenda to address Sexual and Gender-Based Violence (SGBV) in the workplace. The resounding call for action emphasizes the critical role of comprehensive policies in fostering safe working environments and stands as a united front against the global pandemic of sexual harassment.\nKeynote Speaker: Strategic direction and harmony in corporate leadership for long-term profitable enterprises\nIn a keynote address, the President of the Institute of Directors and Chairman of the Council, Angela Carmen Appiah, emphasized purposeful action by directors, highlighting the ecosystemic nature of enterprises and emphasizing the need for harmony for long-term profitability.\n“It must be of critical importance, the idea being that we live in an ecosystem of different players or actors and we need a certain harmony or balance for survival and for growth, so now if the dynamics are not right, it doesn’t matter how well one arm performs; you will find out that it will always fall short because another arm is not developing. This being a critical and important thing to us as directors means that as directors, we must not just know or be aware; we must be delibrate and intentional in what we do.\nNot just to know but to also prevent or salvage, so directors have a responsibility of providing strategic directions. Providing a strategic direction means using information or data so you are not just identifying risks but managing them,” she revealed.\nMrs. Appiah further stated that responsible directors are required to establish suitable steps to combat sexual harassment and ensure that rules are followed.\n“You need a competent director to be mindful of some of these so that they can prescribe, as we are setting policies to address the needs of society. As directors, we don’t want just to know; we want to know how, and this is why we have these conversations so we can elicit specific responses. Its like a phenomenon we are studying, so you elicit responses so that you can put in appropriate interventions to curtail, manage, address, modify, and review whatever we want to do. Once it becomes a policy, we also ensure that we are monitoring and tracking its implementation so that it doesn’t just sit in a book.”\nPanel Discussions\nThe Executive Director of Women in Law and Development in Africa (WILDAF), Melody Darkey, has emphasized the significance of implementing a gender policy at work to combat sexual harassment and gender-based violence.\n“Having a workplace gender policy, particularly in regards to policy that addresses issues of sexual and gender based violence, is important because, as we said, the issue is quite pervasive, but it’s underreported, and so if left unchecked, it creates an environment that is toxic, a culture that doesn’t facilitate safe working environment, particularly for women and other excluded groups.”\nAccording to her, such workplace incidents reduce productivity and emotionally harm the victims.\n“Some of these things, as I said, sexual and gender based violence, for instance, in the workplace, if not checked, can create a situation where victims and survivors are affected emotionally and psychologically, and some of them feel embarrassment, shame, and guilt, and they develop sort of anxiety disorders as well.\nFor the organization, as we said, it can affect your productivity. If you have an environment where people are not getting along because of issues of sexual and gender based violence, work will not progress well, and its also about reputation for your organization.”\nMrs. Darkey noted that all of these factors matter when it comes to viewing a business or institution as a good corporate citizen or as a socially responsible institution, and it is critical that we have these policies in place.\nGhana’s Labour Act, 2003 (Act 651) defines “sexual harassment” as “any unwelcome, offensive, or importunate sexual advances or requests made by an employer or superior officer or a co-worker to a worker, whether the worker is a man or woman.”\nLead Executive and Principal Consultant, Kojo Amissah, also called for serious consequences for violations while expressing concern that policies alone are insufficient without serious consequences for violators. He stated emphatically, “Until we start penalizing people for these, I think all of us will be joking. Let’s have policies in organisations that will actually penalize people.”\nMr. Amissah also disclosed that a lack of sufficient education on workplace regulations and the repercussions of sexual harassment encourages its persistence.\n“To a large extent, it is education that is lacking. As much as I still believe that everybody in an organization knows what sexual harassment is, when you enter and they don’t walk you through the policies they have and the steps for grievance and resolution regarding sexual harassment, you are there and everyone is talking about the culture, and you realize that people are not free in this organization, so when things are happening to you, most of the time they find somebody you can trust and confide in, not the system.”\nAlso, the Head of Department of Development Policy, School of Public Services and Governance, Dr. Gifty Oforiwaa Gyamera, additionally pointed out the global impact and leadership responsibility in drawing attention to the global pandemic of sexual harassment, as well as the issue’s simultaneous recognition and ignorance.\n“Society does not encourage reporting, so it is very important that leadership will also put good structures in place to help the victims. Leadership should also find means to protect the victims and encourage them to report because, in Ghana, reporting means you will never have anyone to support you.\nSexual harassment is a global pandemic, and that is why it has attracted the attention of various international organizations. There have been a lot of international frameworks, and as we are witnessing right now, it’s not only in Ghana, as I said, but globally, so according to recent research that we did in Australia, four out of five women have been sexually harassed,” she added.\nHead of Relations for OXFAM, Lydia Doe, who focused on policy implementation and cultural transformation, acknowledged existing legal frameworks while emphasizing the need to move beyond them to achieve successful policy implementation.\n“The legal frameworks are there, but we are talking about policy implementation. I think where we have gaps is in the implementation. We have to move from a legal framework to policy implementations, clear statements, and acceptable and unacceptable policies within the work space. We all agree that we have a framework, but the issue is the practice and culture do not change what you desire to change.”\nLeadership and Corporate Governance Expert, Dr. Olu Ajayi emphasizes the necessity of punitive measures for effective progress. “Without punitive measures in place, we can never go far. We will just have the policies, but I also believe that there is also some work HR can do because when we talk about sexual harassment, its not about skills its not about technicalities; its about behaviors, and I believe its high time we started building behavioral assessment into performance management. That will go a very long way.”\nDr. Ajayi suggests that when it comes to strategic planning, the board should prioritize and approve resources for staff training in this area, adding that despite training, there must be some protective mechanisms for those who blow the whistle, and this is an area where we are still struggling.\nShe described sexual harassment as a global phenomenon, but in Ghanaian culture, it is even more difficult. However, it should be an area that we should keep working to invest in.\nPresentation of the policy: Unpacking the anti-sexual harassment policy\nIn a presentation, the Principal Consultant, BSC Advisory, Bernice Sam, Esq., mentioned that it’s crucial for businesses to have a fair, safe workplace without discrimination, violence, or harassment. “Responsible business practices, including providing and maintaining a workplace free of discrimination, violence and harassment, have become an essential requirement.”\nShe added that an enterprise’s public image and reputation can be adversely affected by allegations or findings of discrimination, violence, or harassment practices and the reputational cost can be high. However, there are proven benefits to having a good reputation, which include attracting better talent, having more loyal customers, and having higher market value.\nSexual harassment can take the form of physical, verbal, or nonverbal behavior. Physical sexual harassment includes acts of physical aggression, unwanted touching, and excessive closeness. Unwelcome comments and queries regarding a worker’s bodily parts, looks, lifestyle, sexual orientation, and/or rude phone calls constitute verbal sexual harassment.\nNonverbal sexual harassment, on the other hand, includes activities such as sexually provocative gestures, whistling, and the physical or electronic exhibition or transfer of pornographic items or sexually suggestive messages.\nThe relevance of this conference lies in its potential to catalyze transformative change in Ghana’s workplaces. By showcasing the global imperative for gender-equitable policies and aligning these principles with the specific challenges and opportunities within the Ghanaian context, the conference will serve as a catalyst for change.\nThrough collaborative efforts, knowledge sharing, and the endorsement of a model Anti-Sexual Harassment Policy, the conference aspires to drive the adoption of inclusive policies in both public and private organizations. The goal is not merely to convene discussions but to witness tangible outcomes, with at least 12 organizations committing to adopting the policy and signing Memoranda of Understanding at the conclusion of the event.\nParticipants and panelists at the National Conference organized by OXFAM and the Institute of Directors, Ghana (IoD)\nPanelists at the Oxfam organized conference on The Draft Model on Gender Workplace Policy\nPeople & Lifestyle\nGhana Property and Lifestyle Expo 2023 Boosts Confidence in Property Investment Market\nOmansomfuo Barima Nana Yaw Kodie Oppong Manwerehene of Akyem Abuakwa traditional area and director of the Ghana School of Law.\nAccra, Ghana – On Point Property Management Ltd successfully organised the two-day inaugural, edition of the Ghana Property and Lifestyle Expo 2023, leaving attendees with a significant boost in confidence in the Ghana property investment market.

    "text": "Das alte Bauernhaus ist in einem schlechten baulichen Zustand. Bild: Markus Schoch José Moreno dachte, er wisse ungefähr, worauf er sich einlasse, als er das rund 250 Jahre alte und leer stehende Bauernhaus im Arboner Ortsteil Stachen gegenüber der Mosterei Möhl 2019 kaufte. Doch der Architekt irrte sich. Er ging davon aus, das äussere Erscheinungsbild des Fachwerkbaus erhalten zu müssen und im Inneren mehr oder weniger freie Hand zu haben. Die kantonale Denkmalpflege belehrte ihn eines Besseren. Erst im dritten Anlauf gelang es Moreno schliesslich, eine Bewilligung für den Umbau zu bekommen. Die Stadt erteilte sie ihm im Januar dieses Jahres. Er freue sich sehr darüber, sagte Moreno damals gegenüber der Thurgauer Zeitung .\nDer Architekt bewies nach eigenen Worten deshalb so viel Durchhaltewillen, weil das Projekt für ihn zu einer Herzensangelegenheit geworden sei, sagte er vor zwei Jahren. Er hatte sogar vor, mit seiner Familie dereinst ins Bauernhaus zu ziehen. Doch jetzt, da Moreno endlich am Ziel ist, haben sich die Pläne in Luft aufgelöst. Die Liegenschaft steht auf einschlägigen Immobilienplattformen für 690'000 Franken zum Verkauf – mit Verweis auf die Bewilligung zur Renovation.\nMoreno sagt nichts mehr José Moreno. Bild: morenoarchitektur.ch Warum sich Moreno vom Haus trennen will, das ihn viel Zeit, viel Geld und viele Nerven gekostet hat, lässt sich nicht sagen. Er wolle sich im Moment nicht äussern, sagt er auf Anfrage. Möglicherweise ist dem Architekten nach den Erfahrungen in den letzten sechs Jahren mit Amtsstellen und Fachkommissionen am Schluss doch noch einfach die Lust vergangen. Er habe schon vieles erlebt, sagte er bei früherer Gelegenheit. «Aber so etwas noch nicht.»\nTecti ist aus dem Spiel Es fragt sich, was passieren würde, wenn sich kein Käufer für das Gebäude finden sollte, das gemäss Hinweisinventar der kantonalen Denkmalpflege «insgesamt von herausragender kulturhistorischer Bedeutung ist», und wenn Moreno darauf verzichten würde, selbst in das baufällige Baudenkmal zu investieren.\nFalsch ist jedenfalls das Gerücht, dass die Tecti zum Handkuss kommen könnte, sollten Moreno oder ein Dritter die mit 1,4 Millionen Franken veranschlagte Renovation des Bauernhauses nicht an die Hand nehmen. Das stimmt nicht, sagt Tecti-Verwaltungsratspräsident Dölf Früh. Es habe vertragliche Vereinbarungen gegeben für den Fall, dass Moreno nicht rechtzeitig ein Baugesuch einreichen sollte oder Sicherungsmassnahmen am Gebäude nötig werden. «Die Fristen für diese Garantieleistungen sind aber abgelaufen», sagt Früh.\nBlick von oben auf das neue Quartier, das damals noch im Bau war. Im Winkel ganz rechts steht das alte Bauernhaus. Bild: Manuel Nagel Die Tecti mit Sitz in Teufen hatte zwischen 2021 und 2024 auf der grünen Wiese in Stachen zwölf Häuser mit 65 Miet- sowie 45 Eigentumswohnungen gebaut und davor Moreno das alte Bauernhaus verkauft, das im äussersten Zipfel des rund 15'000 Quadratmeter grossen Grundstückes steht. Das Immobilienunternehmen steht auch gegenüber der Stadt nicht in der Verpflichtung. Sie habe sich im Bewilligungsverfahren für die Grossüberbauung keine Sicherheiten mit einer Rückfallklausel und Haftungsbedingungen ausbedungen, schreibt diese auf Anfrage. Der für das Gebiet Holzgass-Stachen rechtsgültige Gestaltungsplan sehe keine speziellen Verordnungen vor für den Fall, dass der Besitzer des Bauernhauses nicht mit der Sanierung vorwärtsmachen sollte.\nTotalumbau möglich So präsentierte sich die Situation, als es die Grossüberbauung noch nicht gab. Die Scheune steht nicht mehr. Bild: Max Eichenberger Die Pläne von Moreno sehen den Totalumbau des alten Bauernhauses vor. Es verfügt über dreizehn Zimmer und hat eine Wohnfläche von rund 340 Quadratmetern. Zu erhalten sind das Erscheinungsbild, die Gebäudehülle, die geschützten Grundrisse und die Wandmalereien. Genutzt werden kann das Gebäude gemäss Verkaufsunterlagen als grosses Einfamilienhaus, als Einfamilienhaus mit Atelier/Büro/Praxis im Erdgeschoss, als Zwei- beziehungsweise Mehrgenerationenhaus oder als Wohnhaus mit zwei separaten Wohnungen.\n2 Kommentare Eduard Müller vor 19 Minuten 3 Empfehlungen Es ist sehr bedauerlich das es so weit kommen musste. Die Ämter sind überzeugt, dass sie das richtige tun, aber sie haben keine Fenster in ihren Denkräumen. Der Vorteil ist, Herr Moreno braucht sich nicht noch mit Einsprachen herumzuschlagen. Aber vielleicht komm die Touristen bald wegen vielen Ruinen nach Arbon.\n3 Empfehlungen Alle Kommentare anzeigen Mehr Artikel dieser Gemeinden\nArbon",
