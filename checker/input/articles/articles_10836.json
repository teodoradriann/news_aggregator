    "text": "El alcalde Galán ha construido esperanza de una mejor ciudad, planeando para el largo plazo, construyendo sobre lo construido y generando confianza. Ha mantenido y forjado alianzas para el desarrollo de la ciudad región y construcción de país desde lo regional. Por otra parte, ha hecho esfuerzos para sortear dificultades y trabajar con el gobierno nacional, en materia de sus obligaciones y compromisos.\nPara socializar su gestión, implementó indicadores de revisión periódica, que lo acerca al ciudadano. Uno de los retos de mayor impacto es la seguridad que, viene mejorando en cifras, pero la percepción sigue siendo un desastre. En materia social, avanza en los frentes propuestos en su Plan de Desarrollo. El medio ambiente es parte importante de su agenda. El metro se mantuvo como estaba contratado y se avanza en la consolidación de un sistema de transporte público integrado y regional.\nLa administración distrital, compartiendo el liderazgo con la Cámara de Comercio de Bogotá - CCB, la buena gestión y aporte de Corferias, la participación de las cajas de compensación familiar y el apoyo del gobierno nacional con participación del Sena, consolida El Campus de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación de Bogotá Región. Megaproyecto planeado de tiempo atrás, que se consolida ahora como una realidad. Ya hay diseño urbano arquitectónico, fruto de concurso internacional. Su localización estratégica consolida este polo, de Corferias, Ágora y su entorno, con cercanías al aeropuerto y a zonas atractivas de la capital.\nEste nuevo centro de conocimiento será una pieza singular de la ciudad, con identidad propia, que conecta al mejor talento con un ecosistema académico, de servicios físicos, de inversión y de financiamiento que harán realidad las ideas innovadoras. Campus que posicionará a Bogotá Región como el epicentro de la ciencia, la tecnología y la innovación en Latinoamérica. Así, le cumple también la CCB al fortalecimiento del tejido empresarial, y al futuro del emprendimiento y del talento innovador.\nDetonante de renovación, urbana, social y económica: Se avecina la transformación de antiguas áreas industriales o improductivas, en entornos de calidad para vivir, aprender y trabajar. Se facilitarán oportunidades que ofrecen las nuevas tecnologías. También, proyecta transformación del territorio en una plataforma científica, tecnológica y cultural, conduciéndola a mejorar nuestra competitividad.\nPara la inversión extranjera, este proyecto ha de convertirse en un incentivo para establecer operaciones y expandir negocios desde Bogotá. Por ello, la alianza entre la alcaldía y la CCB, representada en Invest in Bogotá, participa de este instrumento. Acceder a servicios como la formación y captación de talento humano, la gestión y transferencia de conocimiento, espacios de experimentación, exploración, así como la posibilidad de acceder a conexiones de valor en un solo lugar, para los inversionistas cobran relevancia.\nLa ciencia, la tecnología y la innovación, pasan a ser protagonistas. Este espacio para crear conocimiento, ha de convertirse en pilar de desarrollo y la mejor forma de preparar y atraer el talento joven.",

    "text": "[News](/news) [New York](/news/new-york)\nFamily, organ recipients, honor Islip's William P. Moon with plaque at his FDNY firehouse\nFloral Park resident Terrence Jordan first heard the name William P. Moon after the FDNY firefighter's widow, Kristina, directed her husband’s lungs be donated to him.\nThe 47-year-old firefighter from Islip, known as “Billy,” lost his life in December 2022 after a fall during a training accident in Brooklyn.\nOn Sunday, Kristina Moon joined Jordan, a retired FDNY firefighter, and fellow transplant recipient, as well as retired fire department Capt. Patrick Reynolds, at her late husband's Rescue Company 2 in Brooklyn. The occasion was a plaque dedication ceremony honoring her husband that she and other attendees hoped would ensure future generations of FDNY firefighters also know his name.\nJordan, 65, said of the man whose lungs he depends on for living: “Billy was not afraid to answer the call of duty. Even when his life ended, the decision he had made saved the life of five people, two of whom are brother firefighters. I'm sure I speak for all of us when I say we will be forever grateful to Billy for giving us a second chance at life.”\nThe plaque in Moon's name notes that he made the “supreme sacrifice” while on the job.\nMoon was preparing for a training drill on Dec. 12, 2022 at Rescue Company 2 when he fell approximately 20 feet, sustaining a serious head injury. He was taken to the hospital in critical condition but officials said it became clear Moon would not survive.\nReynolds, who received Moon’s liver, noted Sunday that the donated organs made it possible for all three firefighters to be present at the firehouse.\n“His donated organs are working to keep quite a few people alive,” said Reynolds, 64, of East Northport, a 9/11 first responder who waited a year for a transplant after being diagnosed with a genetic end-stage liver disease.\n“His heart is beating, his lungs are breathing, his liver’s performing its function. He is among us.”\nJordan, who suffered from end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and emphysema, both from his work at Ground Zero, said he felt “especially connected” to Moon after learning about his devotion to family, community and fire service, which included volunteering with the Islip Fire Department. Kristina Moon noted that her husband was the type of dad who wasn’t afraid to let his daughter put bows in his hair, and took the time from his busy schedule to coach his son’s youth baseball teams.\n“Billy more than once mentioned how he had no regrets,” she said of her husband.\nHe had the “job of his dreams,” she added, and enjoyed the people in his life and the town where they were both raised and chose to grow their family. “ … I couldn’t be more proud to call him my husband and best friend.”\nRescue 2 Capt. Liam Flaherty, who served as master of ceremonies for the plaque dedication, joked that Moon met all the requirements for Catholic sainthood.\nHe encouraged Moon’s daughter, Brianne, 11, and son, Colin, 9, to visit the firehouse and view the plaque with future generations of their family to share the story of their father, who he called a “role model.”\n“I'm going to look at it and it's going to remind me to be a better person,” the captain said.",

    "text": "Watergrasshill joined an exclusive set of Cork clubs after an amazing All-Ireland intermediate final at Croke Park on Sunday.\nThey're the fourth Cork team to lift that particular trophy, after Kanturk, Ballymartle and Blarney. There have been five senior winners, Newtown, the last in 2004, Midleton, Blackrock, St Finbarr's the Glen, with Sars hoping to join that pantheon next weekend.\nAt junior level, there have been six victorious clubs: Ballygiblin, Mayfield, Meelin, Dripsey, Fr O'Neills and Ballinhassig. Russell Rovers couldn't have any complaints about failing to be added to the roll of honour, with Freshford undoubtedly the better side in the decider two days ago.\nIt was a cruel loss though, their second since 2020, and like Charleville, beaten at junior level in 2012 and intermediate in 2019, they've twice suffered All-Ireland final day pain.\nCastlelyons, St Catherine's and Ballinhassig, who were junior champions in 2003 but not at Croker and then lost the intermediate final in '06, also know what it's like to leave Jones Road without silverware.\nAs Anthony Daly wrote in Monday's Irish Examiner: \"All-Ireland finals are rare and wonderful. And that’s why people – not just the players - glow when they win them.\"\nWe can see Watergrasshill all the way from the Echo office in Blackpool this week, they're shining so brightly! It's been well documented in recent months but they really went on the most unlikely of journeys from outsiders to county champions.\nIt's not that the Hill didn't have talented hurlers, Daire O'Leary, Sean Desmond and Kevin O'Neill especially, it's just they'd failed to get out of their group in recent seasons and flirted with relegation from PIHC. U20 All-Ireland winner Shane Óg O'Regan (they still have Shane O'Regan, who had an impressive All-Ireland final) moved to Sars in 2022 in controversial circumstances, which was a major off-field distraction.\nWhen they trailed Carrigaline by 10 points midway through their opening group game last August, it looked like the same old sceál.\nBut a magnificent comeback, with Adam Murphy landing 0-11, six from play, and Desmond and Brendan Lehane burying goals, ignited their campaign.\nHis match-winning goal deep into injury time on Sunday was his eighth of the season, including a couple for Imokilly, and maybe it was the young captain's destiny.\nIn the build-up, Desmond said: “It's something I suppose you think of when you're a child or when you're out on the grass playing with your friends that, oh, I'm in Croke Park, and I'm getting the winning score or whatever...\"\nAs prophetic as it gets!\nStill, they could never have expected the 2024 season to roll into 2025 and take them up the road to Croke Park. The shortest and sweetest winter ever.\nNewtownshandrum (2004);\nMidleton (1988);\nBlackrock (1979, 1974, 1972);\nSt Finbarr's (1978, 1975);\nGlen Rovers (1977, 1973).\nNewtownshandrum (2006);\nSt Finbarr's (1981);\nBlackrock (1976).\nWatergrasshill (2025);\nKanturk (2018);\nBallymartle (2011);\nBlarney (2009).\nBallinhassig (2006);\nCharleville (2019);\nFr O'Neills (2020);\nCastlelyons (2024).\nBallygiblin (2023);\nMayfield (2017);\nMeelin (2011);\nDripsey (2009);\nFr O'Neills (2006);\nBallinhassig (2003).\nRussell Rovers (2025);\nSt Catherine's (2024);\nBallygiblin (2022);\nRussell Rovers (2020);\nCharleville (2012).",

An average air quality index (AQI) of 350 (very poor) was recorded at 8am compared to 318 (very poor) at 4pm on Thursday.\nThe maximum temperature was expected to settle around 17°C on Friday. (HT PHOTO) The visibility fell to zero at Palam around 8am and 50 metres at Safdarjung. No diversions or flight cancellations were reported at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International airport even as some flights were delayed.\nOn Thursday, over 300 flights were delayed with an average delay of 18 minutes. “CAT-III visibility procedures [which allow pilots to land even in low visibility] were in place at all three runways,” said India Meteorological Department (IMD) scientist RK Jenamani.\nThe northern railway said at least 24 trains were delayed by over an hour due to the fog.\nThe IMD classifies fog as “dense” when the visibility is below 200 metres and as “very dense” when it drops below 50 metres. Zero visibility was reported on Thursday as well. The lowest visibility was 100 metres on Wednesday.\nThe minimum temperature recorded on Friday (7°C) was around normal for this time of the year.

She says, whenever she works on a masterpiece, she must calm her heart so her thinking can center on her work.\nVatican City is a small country surrounded by the Italian capital, Rome. It is the headquarters and seat of government of the Roman Catholic Church. The Vatican Museums contain thousands of artworks hundreds of years old including paintings by Michelangelo.\n\"The emotion of working on something like a Michelangelo is truly indescribable,\" said Zarelli. She helped repair one of his wall paintings in Vatican City’s Pauline Chapel.\nMichelangelo painted during the Renaissance period of European history during a growth of interest in science, art, and literature.\nZarelli is part of a special team at the Vatican Museums’ repair laboratory for paintings and wood pieces.\nThe team is responsible for looking after thousands of square meters of wall paintings, including the famous ceiling and walls of the Sistine Chapel. They also look after some 5,300 oil paintings and wooden statues.\nRestorers Chiara Notarsfefano and Caterina Manisco work on paintings at the \"painting and wood materials restoration laboratory\" inside the Vatican Museums, at the Vatican, December 11, 2023. (REUTERS/Guglielmo Mangiapane) A century of restoration\nThe painting and wood lab is one of eight specialized groups in the museums. It permitted several news organizations, including Reuters, the chance to see its inner workings to mark its 100th anniversary.\nCare and repair methods change often and today’s workers often have to repair mistakes from care workers that came before them. They repair work from recent history to many centuries ago.\nAnother problem, usually from the distant past, is that restorers were not technicians but artists in their own right. Francesca Persegati is chief restorer at the Vatican Museums. She said that some of those artists thought they could “improve” the original by adding their own work.\n\"It's important to be humble in this job, to respect the work but also to have a scientific background to understand the materials,\" she said.\nBefore a painting even reaches the lab, another team carries out tests to see if paint or color has been added since the piece was first made. They also check it for possible other work below the surface.\nIn another part of the lab, Caterina Manisco was working on an 1895 painting called Madonna and Child Between St. Teresa and St. Francis . Italian Emma Richards was the artist. She painted for the rich and powerful, like Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.

    "title": "Good Counsel football maintains high expectations despite new starters - The Washington Post",
    "text": "Success is expected within the Good Counsel football program. As players leave team meetings, they walk past the school’s collection of athletic memorabilia: Stefon Diggs’s Pro Bowl jersey is featured on the wall next to an impressive photo display of national signing day scenes. The interlocked school initials on the Falcons’ gold helmets are replicated in jewels on the team’s championship rings. Last season, the Falcons earned a Washington Catholic Athletic Conference title and finished atop The Washington Post’s end-of-season rankings — the first time since 2019 they had accomplished either feat. Powering that success was a star-studded senior class, one of the best in the nation . That group came through the program together and went out on top. Now it’s up to the next generation of players to take up the torch. The No. 2 Falcons have an array of new starters this season, including seven on defense. But that doesn’t mean they don’t have ambitions to repeat last season’s achievements. “Kids come here because they want to play high school football at the highest level, they want to go on and play college football at the highest level and they want to win championships,” Coach Andy Stefanelli said. “They know what the standard is when they get here.” In high school football, player development and program building are in many ways one and the same. Today’s cornerstones once practiced with the scout team and spent game days on the sidelines. Senior running back Joseph Williams spent much of the past three seasons backing up Dilin Jones, a four-star prospect now at Wisconsin. The two formed a close bond, with Williams pointing to Jones as a mentor. Now the Falcons’ featured back, Williams turned his first touch of the season into an 80-yard touchdown run in the team’s season-opening win against Columbus (Fla.) last week. He hopes it will be remembered as the start of a breakout season. “We’re trying to win a championship, and every single person on this team is a key part of it,” Williams said. “Me and a lot of my other teammates were there last season — we weren’t key players. Now we get our time to shine.” Quarterback Frankie Weaver captained Good Counsel’s offense for three years, but his graduation opened the door for a new starter. Enter sophomore Jackson Rice. This is Rice’s first season starting at the varsity level after a year of practicing with the Falcons but playing on the junior varsity. Stefanelli stands behind Rice at every practice, hovering a body length away with the answer to any question about verbiage, scheme or approach. Weaver received the same instruction when he was coming into his own as a sophomore. The quarterback, now at Monmouth, helped Rice learn what it takes to step into a role in which leadership is a requirement. “Frankie really helped me understand the playbook, how to read defenses and really just how to be a starter,” Rice said. “Being the quarterback, I know the ball’s in my hands every single play. ... I have to be a leader. I have to be trustworthy and get stuff done.” Not all the mentors have left the building. For each new face on this year’s team, there’s an experienced player to show them the ropes. Faheem Delane, a star safety who will suit up for Ohio State next fall, anchors the secondary. Gavin Crawford and Eidan Buchanon are West Virginia-bound offensive linemen able to give Rice time to get the ball to weapons such as future Pittsburgh wideout DaMarion Fowlkes. Linebacker Justin Thompson, also a Pitt commit, has been a steady presence in the middle, and defensive linemen Delano Brown (Coastal Carolina) and Donovan Moyer (Arkansas State) are disruptive up front. All of them once looked to older teammates for answers. Now it’s their turn to pay it forward. “I was kind of thrust into a position where I have to be the more vocal guy and I have to lead everything. So it’s just good to see the responsibility I have, and I feel I can do that,” said Crawford. “We lost a lot of guys, obviously, but we’re working hard to make sure that people who you may not know their name, you’ll know their names after this season.” The Falcons are coalescing through a trial by fire, a process that traces back to grueling strength and conditioning sessions in the offseason. The season-opening win was a strong start, but there will be no reprieve when the Falcons leave the state again this weekend to play DePaul Catholic (N.J.) on Friday night. Four more nonconference games follow. After that, the Falcons will test themselves against one of the nation’s toughest leagues as WCAC play begins. In league play, especially, there will be nowhere for the Falcons’ new starters to hide. After all, the team has a title to defend. “The standard here is ‘We’re better than you, and we’re here to dominate,’” Delane said. “That’s the model we had last year, and we’re trying to pass that on.”",
