    "text": "Maize & Blue Scholar White's Boeing internship transformed career trajectory\nKat OakOn\n[Skip to Article Text](#mainArticleText)Share or print this article\nQuestions. The past few years have brought a couple of important ones to the forefront for University of Michigan-Flint senior Alexander White.\n\"I'm the kind of person who worries a lot about the future—will I be able to get a good job? Will I be prepared for what comes next? You know, I think with my experiences graduating from high school during the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a lot of uncertainty. I felt a lot of pressure to choose the right path,\" said White, who was recently named a Fall 2024 Maize & Blue Distinguished Scholar and will graduate Dec. 15 with a bachelor's in business administration operations and supply chain management and a minor in Spanish.\n\"I initially chose to attend UM-Flint because of its affordability and proximity to home, but the incredible support I received during my first two years made me realize it was a great long-term decision.\"\nAfter beginning his college studies early while attending high school in Grand Blanc, White first experimented with different majors and classes, struggling to find the right path. \"Ultimately, I knew I wanted to work for a manufacturing company in a job that allowed me to travel and explore international opportunities,\" he said. \"I connected early with the former career development manager at the School of Management, who was integral in helping me find my way. I gained a lot of confidence through the different workshops he offered, so when Boeing came to the career fair last year, I was very prepared to connect with them and advocate for an internship.\"\nFor current and future students at UM-Flint, White stressed how vital the career service support he received has been in preparing him for his future. \"All students, no matter their major, should connect early and often with the folks in Career Services,\" he said. \"You don't know what a job will be like until you do it, so take advantage of their expertise! They are there to help you succeed.\"\nWhite spent the summer of 2024 working in the Seattle-area, putting the skills and ideas he'd learned in his courses at UM-Flint into practice. \"It was the perfect experience! I spent most of my time at the Boeing Everett Factory offices, visited suppliers in Washington and California, and attended intern networking events they hosted, so I learned a lot,\" he said. \"It also showed me how supply chain management connects with all levels of a business, so there is a lot of opportunity for growth and development in my career.\"\nHis experiences at Boeing led directly to him securing a position with Parker Hannifin's Supply Chain Leadership Development Program, which he'll begin shortly after graduation. \"They liked that I had hands-on experience in the aerospace industry, and it turned out that I had also worked with one of their subsidiaries during my internship at Boeing, so that was a real plus,\" said White. \"The skills I've developed at UM-Flint, in terms of core business practices and professionalism, have truly prepared me to make the most of this opportunity. Being named a Maize & Blue Scholar is one more thing I can add to my resume, and I think it will have a long-term positive impact on my career.\"\nWhite is keeping an open mind when considering his future career trajectory. \"I'd like to work in this field for a while and then maybe go to law school, perhaps get into corporate law, with some experience in these industries under my belt,\" he said. \"And, eventually, I'd like to own my own business—but that might be, you know, 20 or 30 years from now! I'm focused on building a solid foundation, and UM-Flint has helped me get a great start.\"\nKat Oak\nKat Oak is the communications specialist for the College of Arts, Sciences, and Education.

    "text": "Pune: The upcoming Union Budget for 2024-25 will likely focus on job creation and the govt is expected to provide initiatives to stimulate work opportunities, veteran banker and current chairperson and CEO of Salesforce India, Arundhati Bhattacharya said. “I think the govt is looking at jobs from whatever the poll outcome has been and the experts have been saying,” she said on the sidelines of a press conference organised by the US-based SaaS firm. Bhattacharya stressed the need for developing sectors that are labour intensive areas so that the govt can upskill the workforce and create the infrastructure in those areas. There are lots of areas that the govt can focus on ranging from tourism, health to life sciences, she added. Infrastructure-heavy sectors such as housing and roadways contribute significantly to the economy in addition to job creation. The housing sales continue to witness record growth across all major metros in the post pandemic period, however, growth in the affordable segment is lagging. On the regulation of in the fintech sector in India, Bhattacharya said that in order to become sustainable, there should be self-regulation or regulation imposed by regulators. Earlier, micro loans were introduced was self-regulated but people were driven by death traps and then regulators had to step in. “Basically, what we are looking at is assessment of risks. If you are able to do that you will not get in trouble with the regulators,” she added.We also published the following articles recentlyEU regulator has a warning for Nvidia: We have beenLearn about the European Union's scrutiny of tech giant Nvidia for potential market risks related to AI chip supply.

    "text": "Microsoft’s recent decision to cut 650 jobs in its gaming division has sparked a wave of criticism from the Communications Workers Union (CWA). The organization, which previously supported Microsoft’s merger with Activision Blizzard, is now expressing deep disappointment with the tech giant’s actions. Microsoft to cut gaming staff by 650 CWA representatives stressed the paradox of the situation: one of the most profitable corporations in the world, which earned $88 billion last year, resorts to mass layoffs under the pretext of ensuring “long-term success.” Such a move, according to the union, runs counter to expectations from a company of such size and financial power. What makes the situation particularly bitter is that the CWA was instrumental in getting regulators to approve the Microsoft-Activision Blizzard deal. The union took this step after Microsoft entered into a union-neutrality agreement that paved the way for unionization at major gaming studios. Samuel Cooper, senior producer of World of Warcraft and a member of WoWGG-CWA, expressed solidarity with the fired colleagues. He called on workers in the gaming industry to join unions to protect their rights and interests. The CWA reminded that while union representation cannot always prevent layoffs, it can strengthen workers’ bargaining power with their employers. Despite its disappointment with Microsoft’s actions, the CWA said it remains committed to supporting the company’s workers in their quest for better working conditions. The union will continue to organize workers and protect their rights, especially in light of the increasing number of layoffs in the tech industry.",

    "text": "Photo: PATRICK T. FALLON / AFP / Getty Images\nIn Wilmington, Los Angeles, a tunnel collapse on Wednesday night led to a tense but successful rescue of 31 workers. The incident occurred around 8 p.m. in the 1700 block of N. Figueroa Street, involving workers in a six-mile-long tunnel located 400 feet underground. The tunnel is part of the Clearwater Project, designed to transport treated wastewater to the ocean.\nAccording to the Los Angeles Times , more than 100 Los Angeles Fire Department personnel, including Urban Search and Rescue teams, responded to the scene. The workers managed to escape by climbing through the collapsed section of the tunnel. Interim Fire Chief Ronnie Villanueva described it as a \"very scary\" situation, but fortunately, no one was injured.\nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass met with the rescued workers and expressed relief at the positive outcome, saying, \"I am feeling very good that this is a great outcome to what started as a very scary evening.\" The collapse occurred over five miles from the tunnel's entry point, as reported by CBS4 Local .\nThe tunnel, part of a $630.5 million project, was expected to reach Royal Palms Beach by the end of the year. However, the construction is now paused as the contractor assesses the damage and determines necessary repairs. Robert Ferrante, chief engineer for the L.A. County Sanitation Districts, stated that the timeline for resuming work is uncertain.\nThe LAist reported that the project aims to safely transport treated water from the Hyperion Water Reclamation Plant to the Pacific Ocean. The incident is the first major setback since construction began in 2019.",
