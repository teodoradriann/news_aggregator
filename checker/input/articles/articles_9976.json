    "text": "La presencia de la [DANA](/tags/dana/) va a seguir complicando el tiempo durante el puente de Todos los Santos y podría dejar este viernes más de 100 litros por metro cuadrado (l/m2) en el sur de Cataluña y el norte de la Comunidad Valenciana, según la predicción del portavoz de la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (AEMET), Rubén del Campo. Por ello, ha pedido consultar el estado del tiempo y de las carreteras si se va a emprender un viaje. Del Campo ha explicado que la situación más complicada de este viernes estará en el suroeste peninsular. En concreto, Huelva registrará chubascos muy fuertes y podrá superar los 40 litros por metro cuadrado (l/m2). A su vez, también caerán probablemente chubascos fuertes en otras zonas de Andalucía occidental y sur de Extremadura. Además, ha añadido que la situación seguirá siendo complicada en el área mediterránea, en el sur de Catalunya especialmente y en el norte de la Comunitat Valenciana. Allí, los chubascos podrán ser persistentes y los acumulados podrán superar los 100 l/m2. Esto puede provocar de nuevo crecidas en cauces e inundaciones en zonas bajas, por lo que el portavoz de [AEMET](/tags/aemet/) ha recomendado alejarse de este tipo de zonas. Lluvias intensas en Baleares A su vez, ha advertido sobre el clima en Baleares durante la jornada del viernes. En las islas, las lluvias podrán ser muy intensas y podrán dejar 50 l/m2 en sólo una hora o incluso 120 l/m2 en unas pocos horas. Al igual que en el caso de la Comunitat Valenciana, Del Campo ha pedido precaución en el archipiélago, dado que también pueden producirse crecidas e inundaciones en zonas bajas. El sábado continuará la inestabilidad con chubascos de nuevo fuertes y persistentes en el sur de Catalunya, en la Comunitat Valenciana y de nuevo en el archipiélago Balear. De forma más débil, se podrán registrar en puntos del tercio sur de la península. Situación estable desde el domingo El portavoz de AEMET ha avanzado que la tendencia para el domingo y el lunes es la de que la DANA vaya desapareciendo y que la situación sea más estable. Aún así, ha indicado que todavía se producirán chubascos en el Levante, en Catalunya, en el área del Estrecho y en Baleares. Estos podrán ser fuertes aún durante el lunes, en especial en el sur de Catalunya, en la Comunitat Valenciana y en el sur de Aragón. De cara al martes y días siguientes probablemente se dará una situación más estable en todo el país, aunque a día de hoy, Del Campo no descarta posibles chubascos, una vez más, en el [área Mediterránea](/tags/mediterraneo/). Todo esto estará acompañado con unas temperaturas que no van a variar demasiado y que serán en general algo más cálidas de lo habitual para esta época del año.",

    "title": "Mariya Oktyabrskaya: Vengeance Drives A Tank",
    "text": "Every war has unique stories about heroes who were inspired by revenge and served their country bravely and boldly. World War II was certainly no exception, and many women picked up weapons to avenge the deaths of their loved ones.\nThere was one Ukrainian woman who was so determined to seek revenge on the\nNazis for the death of her beloved husband that she sold everything she owned, bought a tank, and drove said tank on the front line just to destroy German soldiers. Mariya Vasilyevna Oktyabrskaya was a total badass who would stop at nothing to seek revenge for her husband’s death.\nShe was awarded one of the top military honors of the Soviet Union for her bravery, and was the first female tanker to earn that title. This is the story of Mariya Vasilyevna Oktyabrskaya and her quest for revenge.\nMariya Vasilyevna Oktyabrskaya\nMariya Vasilyevna Oktyabrskaya was born in 1905 on the\nCrimean Peninsula to a poor family of serfs. Serfs in 20th-century Russia were essentially slaves to feudal lords, and the 12-member family of Mariya Vasilyevna struggled to survive in her early years.\nWhile the Russian Revolution and the establishment of\ncommunism, is now seen as largely negative, Mariya and her family benefited greatly from being a part of the Communist party. Her family were no longer indentured servants; she was able to attend school and eventually found work in a cannery, then later as a telephone operator.\nIn 1925, telephone operator Mariya married Ilya Oktyabrsky, a sergeant in the Red Army who served as the Regiment Commissar of the 206th Division. Mariya Oktyabrskaya joined the Military Wives Council and trained to work as an army nurse.\nShe also learned how to drive and was educated by Ilya in using military\nweapons, which only added to her interest in military matters. Mariya Oktyabrskaya was the epitome of the perfect Red Army wife.\nShe once said, “Marry a serviceman, and you serve in the army: an officer’s wife is not only a proud woman, but also a responsible title.” The Oktyabrskayas were deeply in love, and their lives seemed full of potential when\nWorld War II began.\nIlya was called to serve, and Mariya was evacuated to the city of Tomsk in\nSiberia for her safety. When she was living in Tomsk, Mariya Oktyabrskaya received word that her husband had been killed in combat against Nazi Germany near the Ukrainian capital city of Kyiv in August of 1941. Lepa Radić, Teenage Hero Of Yugoslavian Resistance Aimo Koivunen: Finland’s Drug-Fueled Super Soldier\nDue to the war and her move to Siberia, it took two years for the news of her beloved husband’s death to reach Mariya, and she was devastated and burned with hatred for the Nazis.\nHell Hath No Fury Like A Soviet Widow\nMariya Oktyabrskaya was determined to seek revenge for Ilya’s death. When she tried to enlist in the Red Army, she was rejected due to her age (36) and because she suffered from cervical vertebra tuberculosis.\nSo Mariya took it upon herself to sell all of her possessions, took up sewing work, and sold bed linens after her work shifts to raise enough funds to buy a tank. Mariya Oktyabrskaya gave 50,000 rubles to the\nSoviet Defense Fund as a donation and wrote a telegram to Joseph Stalin requesting permission for her to join the war effort.\nIn her telegram to Stalin, Mariya Oktyabrskaya wrote “Dear Joseph Vissarionivich! In the battles for the motherland, my husband, regimental commissar Ilya Fedotovich Oktyabrsky, died. For his death, for the death of Soviet people tortured by fascist barbarians, I want to take revenge on fascist dogs, for which I have contributed all my personal savings, 50,000 rubles to the state bank to build a tank. I ask you to name the tank “Fighting Girlfriend” (Боевая подруга) and send me to the front as the driver of said tank. I have the specialty of a driver, I have excellent command of a machine gun, I am a Voroshilov shooter.”\nNot long after the telegram was sent, Mariya Oktyabrskaya received a response from Joseph Stalin granting her requests for the construction of The Fighting Girlfriend tank and to be the driver of this tank she paid for. The Fighting Girlfriend was a T-34 tank, and five months after her letter to Stalin, Mariya Oktyabrskaya graduated with honors from the Tomsk Tank Academy as a tank driver and mechanic.\nThe Fighting Girlfriend\nMariya Oktyabrskaya’s training was uncommon, not because she was a woman, but because most tank crew members were sent straight into combat with next to no training. Maybe it was because of her dedication to the motherland, or Stalin was impressed by the furious widow.\nEither way, Mariya was more than capable when she was posted to the 26th Guards Tank Brigade, which was part of the 2nd Guards Tank Corps. With the words “Боевая подруга” painted in bold white along the side of her tank, most of the other tankers in her unit saw her as a joke and nothing more than a publicity stunt, another propaganda piece for the\nSoviet Union.\nOn October 21, 1943, Mariya experienced her first battle in the city of Smolensk along the Dnieper River, which had recently been recovered from the Nazis in September. Mariya and the Red Army were sent to remove any remaining Nazi soldiers from the city.\nDuring this battle, it was reported that she and her tank crew destroyed artillery guns and machine-gun nests taking out any and all Nazi soldiers who got in her way. One negative thing about tanks is that they are large and very easy targets, and the Fighting Girlfriend was hit with gunfire during the battle.\nMariya Oktyabrskaya, who was trained as a tank mechanic, jumped out of her tank in the middle of active combat to fix the tank. She was told to get back in the tank but ignored her superiors and fixed the tank, restoring it to working order.\nCan you guess what she did next? If you said, “jumped back into the tank and returned to battle,” you would be correct. She did disobey orders and placed herself in the direct line of danger. She released hell on the\nhttps://www.historicmysteries.com/nazi-grail-hunter/ she hated and won the respect of her fellow male tankers.\nMariya Oktyabrskaya was also promoted to sergeant after her first taste of combat. Mariya Oktyabrskaya was living her best revenge-focused life, and after the incident in Smolensk, Mariya wrote a letter to her sister that said, “You can be happy for me – I’ve just been baptized in battle. I’m slaying bastards.”\nIt became common for Mariya Oktyabrskaya to leap out of her tank to fix the Fighting Girlfriend under heavy fire before hopping back inside to return to combat.\nThe Final Battle\nMariya Oktyabrskaya’s final\nbattle occurred on January 17, 1944, during a night attack as part of the Leningrad-Novgorod Offensive. In the village of Šviedy in Soviet Belarus, the Fighting Girlfriend was struck by a German anti-tank shell, and the tank could not move due to damage.\nMariya Oktyabrskaya leapt out of her tank to begin repairs as she was known to do when she was hit in the head by fragments of a mine shell which left her unconscious. At the hospital, doctors determined that a shell fragment had hit Mariya Oktyabrskaya’s left eye and penetrated the cerebral hemisphere of her brain.\nDoctors operated on Mariya Oktyabrskaya to remove the shrapnel from her head, and while the operation was a success, her health rapidly deteriorated. Mariya began experiencing memory lapses, fever, delirium, and severe headaches.\nWhile in recovery, a major of the Red Army visited her to present her with the Order of the Patriotic War 1st degree for her heroism and courage. Shortly after receiving the award, Mariya Oktyabrskaya slipped into unconsciousness, and when the sun rose on March 15, 1944, Mariya Oktyabrskaya died.\nMariya Oktyabrskaya was buried at the Smolensk Kremlin, along the banks of the Dnieper River, alongside the remains of “heroes of the Patriotic War of 1812.” The Fighting Girlfriend tank remained in service until Victory Day on May 9th, 1945, but it had to be replaced three times before it reached the\nBaltic Sea near Königsberg, where it was dismantled.\nEvery time the tank was replaced, Mariya Oktyabrskaya’s crew insisted that the new vehicle have the words “Боевая подруга” emblazoned upon it as a tribute to their fallen heroine. In August 1945, Mariya was posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union, recognizing her bravery in her final battle.\nThe Hero of the\nhttps://www.historicmysteries.com/vladimir-komarov/ award was the highest degree of distinction a member of the Soviet military could be awarded. Mariya Oktyabrskaya was the first female tank driver to receive the Hero of the Soviet Union award.\nTop Image: Mariya Oktyabrskaya and her tank, the “fighting girlfriend”.

    "text": "Mumbai: Residents of BMC's Ward A, including those in Colaba, Koliwada, and the Naval area of Mumbai, are advised to prepare for a temporary interruption in water supply due to emergency repair work on a crucial water channel. The supply will be cut for eight hours on Saturday.\nA 1200 mm diameter main water line, serving these areas, has sprung a leak during the ongoing construction work for Metro 3 on Jeevan Bima Marg at Churchgate in A ward. This essential water channel is set to undergo repairs on Saturday between 3.30pm and 11.30pm. However, digging is set to begin at 9am, with pumping of water from the channel preceding the actual repair work. Following completion, water supply will be gradually restored to the affected areas during the morning and afternoon sessions.\nDuring the repair period, regular water supply timings for Colaba (4.30pm to 6.30pm), additional special water supply for Koliwada (6.30pm to 6.45pm), and extra special water supply for the Naval area (6.50pm to 7.5pm) will be affected.\nFurthermore, residents are advised that regular water supply to the Naval area, scheduled between 10.30pm and 2.50am, may experience delays following the completion of repair work, as the water channels are recharged.\nA 1200 mm diameter water channel is utilised for water supply in ward A, sourced from a 1500 mm diameter pipeline originating at Cross Maidan. Upon detecting reduced pressure and flow through this channel, an investigation ensued. It was revealed that the ongoing Metro 3 construction work at Jeevan Bima Marg, near the Mantralaya building, had caused a rupture in the 1200 mm diameter water channel.\nMumbai: Lake Levels Lowest In 2 Years, BMC Assures No Water Cuts The municipal corporation&apos;s swift response involved an inspection by the emergency repair department. To facilitate the repair work and minimise disruptions, the BMC has liaised with the Marine Drive traffic police, with traffic planning considerations taken into account.",

Ma né Yahya Sinwar, il capo di Hamas barricato nella “metropolitana” di Gaza, né il premier israeliano Benjamin Netanyahu, che insiste per la vittoria totale, intendono cedere realmente. Il nodo del corridoio Filadelfia, che segna il confine fra la Striscia e l’Egitto, diventa un affaire diplomatico in cui a non arretrare sono in primo luogo gli egiziani, che ieri in extremis hanno presentato come «apertura» la disponibilità di Hamas ad accettare una forza internazionale a presidio. Appellandosi al Trattato di pace con Israele, i mediatori di Al-Sisi non ammettono che si installino in modo permanente militari con la Stella di David su quella frontiera. Netanyahu, da parte sua, ha talmente a cuore il Corridoio Filadelfia che ha ordinato ai suoi portavoce di uscire con una dichiarazione in cui ribadisce, smentendo le ipotesi di apertura riportate dai media americani, che Israele «insisterà sul raggiungimento di tutti i suoi obiettivi di guerra, così come sono stati definiti dal gabinetto di sicurezza, compreso il fatto che Gaza non costituisca più una minaccia per la sicurezza di Israele e ciò richiede la messa in sicurezza del confine sud». Niente disimpegno, niente mappa con riduzioni di militari dislocati lungo il corridoio, come suggerito dai media vicini alla Casa Bianca. GLI SFORZI USA Joe Biden ha detto che nella telefonata dell’altra sera con Netanyahu gli ha esposto «gli sforzi degli Stati Uniti per la difesa di Israele contro le minacce che provengono dall’Iran e dai suoi gruppi terroristici», ma gli ha pure chiarito che bisogna «portare a termine l’accordo su cessate il fuoco e liberazione degli ostaggi», infine ha discusso i colloqui del Cairo di oggi e domani per «rimuovere eventuali ostacoli rimanenti». Il Wall Street Journal assicura che Biden ha usato il pacchetto da 20 miliardi di aiuti militari per Israele come leva negoziale su Netanyahu, senza successo. Le speranze di intesa sono al lumicino e i segnali vanno tutti nella direzione del fallimento, che aprirebbe le porte alla rappresaglia iraniana contro le uccisioni israeliane del leader di Hamas e del capo militare di Hezbollah a Teheran e Beirut. «I tempi della risposta, che servirà da deterrente, saranno meticolosamente orchestrati perché avvenga in un momento di massima sorpresa», fa sapere la missione permanente dell’Iran presso l’Onu. «L’aggressore va punito per il suo atto di terrorismo e le violazioni alla nostra sovranità nazionale». Tra i segnali dell’escalation, l’invito della Cina ai propri concittadini a lasciare al più presto il Libano per via della «grave e complessa situazione della sicurezza» o, se devono restare, almeno siano «vigili, rafforzino le precauzioni ed evitino di andare nelle aree a rischio». Altro segnale l’arrivo dal Pacifico della portaerei USS Abraham Lincoln, che si affianca col suo gruppo di battaglia alla Roosevelt e al sommergibile lanciamissili Georgia. Tensione alle stelle nel Mar Rosso, dove i ribelli filo-iraniani Houthi hanno ripetutamente attaccato la petroliera greca Sounion e un cacciatorpediniere francese della missione europea Aspides ha messo in salvo 29 marinai, per lo più russi e filippini, mentre a bordo scoppiava un incendio. LE VITTIME E prosegue la guerra di Gaza, con l’esercito israeliano che ha ucciso 17 persone, ben 11 distruggendo una sola casa nel campo di Al-Maghazi, e ordinato di evacuare zone di Deir al-Balah, centro della Striscia, e Khan Younis, nel Sud, per smantellare strutture militari, razzi e eliminare miliziani. I media israeliani scrivono del 19enne che avrebbe tradito il numero 2 di Hamas a Gaza, Deif, ucciso in un raid, e adesso si troverebbe già in Usa dove ha chiesto asilo politico. Quattro invece i terroristi israeliani arrestati in Israele per raid assassini e incendiari nei villaggi della Cisgiordania. Un fenomeno, dice il capo dello Shin Bet Ronen Bar a Netanyahu, che «ci porta sull’orlo del disastro». Tragica la situazione degli ostaggi. L’esercito ha confermato che sui corpi degli ultimi sei cadaveri recuperati, per lo più anziani presi nei Kibbutz, ci sono colpi d’arma da fuoco. Sette sarebbero in mano alla Jihad islamica. Una sessantina in tutto. Tra loro 12 donne, 7 civili e 5 soldatesse 20enni, le vedette disarmate sulla barriera con Gaza, riprese sanguinanti in un video. Tra le civili Eden Yerushalmi, 24 anni, nascosta tra i cespugli di lavanda nel deserto del Nova Music Festival a inviare sms alla polizia e alla madre («Mi stanno sparando, sono morta»), prima di venire trascinata via. «Perdo sangue, tutti qui perdiamo sangue», l’ultimo messaggio. © RIPRODUZIONE RISERVATA",

    "text": "El Ayuntamiento de Lepe vuelve este año a celebrar una de sus tradiciones navideñas más singulares, la celebración del adelanto de las campanadas de Año Nuevo con las berries de la suerte. El viernes 29 de diciembre, a partir de las 18.30 horas, comenzará el reparto de las más de 2.000 tarrinas de frutos rojos, que se distribuirán en la plaza de España, facilitadas por la empresa “Plus Berries”. A continuación está previsto que la fiesta se inicie en el porche de la iglesia parroquial Santo Domingo de Guzmán, ante la espadaña, donde tendrá lugar el sorteo de la paga extraordinaria que la Asociación General de Empresarios de Lepe -Agelepe- ofrece entre los participantes en la campaña comercial de Navidad. Animación, música ambiente y participación ciudadana amenizarán esta genuina actividad lepera, que a las 20.30 horas conectará en directo con un reloj programado para el ensayo general con el que Lepe y los leperos y leperas, encabezados por su alcalde, Juan Manuel González, dan la bienvenida a 2024, esperando que venga cargado de salud, felicidad y prosperidad.
