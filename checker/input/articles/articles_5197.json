    "text": "Principaux renseignements\n- La fermeture de la raffinerie entraînera la perte de 400 emplois.\n- Les gouvernements britannique et écossais ont annoncé un plan conjoint prévoyant une enveloppe financière de 100 millions de livres sterling pour les travailleurs.\n- Petroineos a cité la concurrence croissante des grandes raffineries comme un facteur important dans la décision.\nPetroineos, l’exploitant de Grangemouth, la seule raffinerie de pétrole d’\nÉcosse, a annoncé sa fermeture imminente en 2025, entraînant la perte de 400 emplois. L’entreprise a invoqué les difficultés économiques comme principale raison de sa décision. Grangemouth, créée il y a plus d’un siècle, sera transformée en terminal d’importation de carburants.\nRaisons derrière la fermeture\nLa fermeture de la raffinerie a suscité des critiques de la part des syndicats et des hommes politiques, qui ont exprimé leur consternation face à la perte d’emplois et à son impact sur la base manufacturière et la sécurité énergétique du pays. Les gouvernements britannique et écossais ont annoncé un plan conjoint visant à fournir une enveloppe financière de 100 millions de livres sterling pour soutenir les travailleurs et investir dans des projets énergétiques locaux.\nPressions financières\nPetroineos a cité la concurrence croissante de raffineries plus grandes et plus modernes dans d’autres régions comme un facteur important de la fermeture. L’entreprise a fait état de pertes financières importantes ces dernières années, estimant ses pertes quotidiennes à environ 500 000 dollars.\nAlternatives potentielles\nAvant l’annonce, des campagnes ont été menées pour que la raffinerie reste opérationnelle jusqu’à ce qu’une alternative viable à faible émission de carbone puisse être identifiée. Le gouvernement et Petroineos explorent des options potentielles à long terme telles que l’hydrogène à faible teneur en carbone, les carburants électroniques propres et les carburants durables pour l’aviation.\nImplications pour le marché du pétrole\nLa fermeture de Grangemouth\ndevrait avoir des répercussions sur le marché du pétrole, car il traite le pétrole brut Forties de la mer du Nord et le WTI Midland des États-Unis, qui contribuent à l’indice de référence mondial du pétrole Brent. Petroineos a précisé que les autres opérations menées à proximité, notamment les installations pétrochimiques et les oléoducs, ne sont pas affectées.

    "title": "Suspect in Tabatha Tozzi murder arrested in Mexico after nearly two-year international manhunt",
    "text": "By Alyssa Bethencourt\nClick here for updates on this story\n LAS VEGAS, Nevada ( KTNV ) — After nearly two years of heartbreak and unanswered questions, the family of Tabatha Tozzi may finally see justice take a step forward.\nOswaldo Nathanahel Perez-Sanchez, the man accused of killing 26-year-old Tabatha Tozzi in Las Vegas in April 2023, was arrested Tuesday in Sonora, Mexico.\nMexican authorities confirmed in a Facebook post that the Unidad Especializada en Aprehensiones arrested Perez-Sanchez in Ciudad Obregón, acting on a warrant issued by the attorney general’s office in Sinaloa.\nPerez-Sanchez is also being investigated in connection with the femicide and forced disappearance of another woman whose body was discovered on April 7, 2025, in Villa Fontana, Culiacán.\nHe had reportedly been living under the alias “Jorge N” while hiding in the region.\nAuthorities say he is now being transported to Culiacán, where he will be held at the Aguaruto Penitentiary and presented before the Court of Control and Criminal Prosecution. In a news release on Wednesday, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department wrote that Perez-Sanchez’s extradition to the United States is pending.\nLas Vegas police thanked multiple agencies for “their extensive follow-up and collaboration with Mexican authorities to locate Pereze-Sanchez,” including the U.S. Marshals Service Nevada Violent Offender Task Force, the U.S. Marshals Service – District of Arizona Tucson, the FBI, DEA Nogales Resident Office and the Customs and Border Protection Special Operations Group in San Diego.\n“We have relentlessly pursued this fugitive, and the family can rest knowing that he is now in custody,” District of Nevada U.S. Marshal Gary Schofield stated.\n“The collaboration required to apprehend this fugitive exemplifies the importance of teamwork,” added FBI Las Vegas Special Agent in Charge Spencer Evans. “We hope this outcome provides a measure of peace to the family, knowing that he is now in custody.”\nA mother’s unimaginable loss\nThe arrest marks a major development in a case that has gripped the Las Vegas community for nearly two years. Tabatha Tozzi, a young woman described by friends and family as bright, loving, and full of potential, was killed in April of 2023. Metro police say she was shot outside of a northwest Las Vegas home, allegedly by her boyfriend, Perez-Sanchez, before he fled the country.\nHer mother, Regina Lacerda, has been a tireless advocate for justice ever since. In multiple emotional interviews, she spoke candidly about the pain of losing her daughter and the torment of knowing the suspect remained at large.\n“The day before this happened, she even told me, ‘Mom, I’m not happy. I’m trying to break up with him, but I’m afraid,’” Lacerda previously told Channel 13. “She said she was afraid he’d do something to himself. And I said, ‘To himself or to you?’”\nOn the morning of the shooting, Lacerda received a frantic call from her daughter asking to be picked up. “I couldn’t make it there on time to save my daughter,” she recalled, through tears.\nThe search for justice\nFor months, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department and the FBI worked to locate Perez-Sanchez. Ten days after the shooting, Metro Police released his photo to the public. Some, including Lacerda, questioned whether releasing it earlier might have made a difference.\nIn 2023, on what would have been Tabatha’s 27th birthday, the FBI announced they had officially joined the case, intensifying the international search and raising the reward for information to $30,000.\nRetired LVMPD Lieutenant Randy Sutton had said at the time, “You can run for a while, but they are on the scent, and once they’re on the scent, they’re not getting off it.”\nA community united: “The Tabby Tribe”\nThroughout the investigation, friends and supporters formed what became known as the “Tabby Tribe”—a passionate group determined to keep Tabatha’s memory alive and demand accountability. Vigils, rallies, and memorials were held across the Las Vegas valley.\n“My daughter will never be a cold case,” Lacerda told the crowd during a memorial event at the Metro Police Headquarters. “We will always fight for her.”\nPlease note: This content carries a strict local market embargo.

    "text": "Cinco meses depois, as luzes do Norte desceram novamente até latitudes muitos baixas e onde são muito raras de avistar. Resultado: esta noite, se estiver num local com pouca luz e com o céu sem muitas nuvens, agarre na câmara e verá auroras boreais em Portugal. Já correm várias imagens nas redes sociais, com as luzes, sobretudo em tons rosa e roxo, a colorirem zonas no Centro e Norte do País. Acontece o mesmo no Sul de Espanha, até nas ilhas baleares, e um pouco por toda a Europa.\nNo alto da Serra da Estrela! Não sei se é Aurora Boreal!

Uma erupção na crosta do Sol, que ocorreu às primeiras horas da madrugada de dia 9, de classe X, uma das mais intensas, e que seguiu em direção à Terra. Na noite desta quarta-feira, quando atingiu a atmosfera terrestre, a tempestade geomagnética era de intensidade G4, num máximo é G5, com um índice de magnitude Kp de 8, no máximo de 9.\nPUB • CONTINUE A LER A SEGUIR\nAhora!\nBella #aurora boreal desde la Catedral de Ely en Cambridgeshire, Inglaterra #TormentaSolarGeomagnetica #Auroraborealis\nVía @VeronicaJoPo pic.twitter.com/2yNn4L8mbW\n— Geól. Sergio Almazán (@chematierra) October 10, 2024\nÉ esta intensidade e magnitude que permite que as auroras boreais sejam visíveis em latitudes mais a Sul, cerca de 40 a 44º, e não fiquem limitadas às luzes do Norte, nome pelas quais são conhecidas, já que as partículas emitidas nas tempestades solares são atraídas pela zona magnética dos polos, nomeadamente do Polo Norte. A hora prevista da chegada da tempestade era às 17h00 (mas com uma grande margem de incerteza). Mas, mal se pôs o sol, não houve atrasos: chegaram as primeiras imagens.\nMuito intensas nas zonas habituais (Islândia, Noruega, Suécia), mas ténues nos países onde são tão raras, como Portugal ou Espanha — as auroras apareceram visíveis bem a Sul, até nas ilhas baleares.\nAurora Boreal visible des de Punta Nati, Menorca.\n????Jesus Liz pic.twitter.com/160Rjb57Um\n— MeteoDadesBalears (@balearicsmeteo) October 10, 2024\nAurora boreal desde #Nagore #ValledeArce #Navarra @AEMET_Navarra @ElTiempo_tve @ElTiempoNavarra @DiariodeNavarra @NoticiasNavarra @RTVENavarra @ElTiempoA3 @eguraldiaETB pic.twitter.com/qbBudXeMow\n— Javier Idiazabal Chourraut (@JChourraut) October 10, 2024\nVuelve a verse la aurora boreal desde el norte de la península ibérica, a ver si en las próximas horas tenemos sorpresa por el sur https://t.co/ODmIwG8PBD\n— meteocr (@meteocr) October 10, 2024\nDesde Villanueva de Córdoba, muy leve pero algo se intuyen. #Auroraboreal pic.twitter.com/fQ7k2MA0Uc\n— AstrofotografA_Ana (@anam2fernandez) October 10, 2024\n⚠️ Impresionante como va ganando intensidad la Aurora Boreal.‼️\nAsí se ve ahora desde el observatorio astronómico de calar Alto en Almería. pic.twitter.com/TrtyPdGinz\n— AMETSE (@MeteoSE) October 10, 2024\n#auroraboreal está noche desde Granada pic.twitter.com/8HLMHDMyXg\n— Elvira Guerrero (@Eangela82) October 10, 2024\nHorizonte norte en el Observatorio de Torremocha del Jiloca (Teruel) hace unos minutos.
