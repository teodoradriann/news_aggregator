    "title": "Ocho exempleados de SpaceX demandan a Elon Musk por acoso",
    "text": "Un grupo de ocho exingenieros de SpaceX presentó este miércoles una demanda ante un tribunal estatal de Los Ángeles (Estados Unidos) en la que acusan a la compañía aeroespacial y a su consejero delegado, Elon Musk , de acoso sexual y discriminación por razón de sexo a sus trabajadoras.

UU.\nEn la demanda, presentada por cuatro hombres y cuatro mujeres, se afirma que el director ejecutivo publicó fotografías sexuales y comentarios denigrantes de sus trabajadores.\n\" Estas acciones tuvieron el resultado previsible de ofender , causar angustia e inmiscuirse en el bienestar de las demandantes para perturbar su tranquilidad emocional en el lugar de trabajo\", reza el texto.\nDespués de esto, decidieron escribir una carta en la que manifestaban su preocupación ante la \"vergonzosa\" gestión de Musk por los supuestos episodios de acoso sexual y discriminación que \"habitualmente\" sufrían las ingenieras de la empresa , cuyas quejas habrían sido ignoradas en varias ocasiones. De interés: Video: una pareja se electrocutó dentro de un jacuzzi en México\nAsimismo, según los ocho exempleados, también instaron sin éxito al resto de ejecutivos de la compañía a desautorizar otros comentarios sexistas que el director ejecutivo había emitido entonces en sus redes sociales.\nLos extrabajadores solicitan una compensación económica en concepto de daños y perjuicios -cuya cantidad no fue especificada- y una orden que prohíba a SpaceX continuar con esta fórmula \"ilegal\" de despidos.\nAnne Shaver, una de las abogadas de las demandantes, afirmó en un comunicado que la dirección de la empresa aeroespacial \"permitió y fomentó a sabiendas un entorno de trabajo plagado de acoso sexual\": \"Haber sido despedida por protestar por el absoluto fracaso de SpaceX a la hora de tomar medidas básicas para prevenir el acoso sexual es claramente una represalia, errónea y recurrible\".\nSpaceX ha negado haber incurrido en esta forma de proceder, asegurando que la carta que escribieron era perjudicial y que los exempleados fueron despedidos legalmente por violar las políticas de la empresa.

UU . en la que se argumentó que sus despidos vulneraron sus derechos, amparados por la legislación en materia de empleo del país.\nA petición de SpaceX, un tribunal de apelaciones de EE. UU. suspendió más tarde la demanda de la Junta de Relaciones Laborales hasta que se resuelva la interpuesta por los exempleados.",

    "title": "New Information Reveals Relentless Torture of Heilongjiang Woman Who Died in Custody at 75 While Serving a 6-Year Prison Term | Falun Dafa - Minghui.org",
    "text": "(Minghui.org) The Minghui.org website previously reported on the death of Ms. Mou Yongxia on July 13, 2023, while she was serving a six-year prison term for her faith in Falun Gong. The retired teacher from Daqing City, Heilongjiang Province was 75 years old.\nMs. Mou’s family was never told where she was being held after her arrest in 2019. After being admitted to prison in June 2020, she was still denied family visits and barred from contacting her family. It wasn’t until April 2023 that she was finally allowed to call her loved ones for the first time. Only then did her younger son learn of her prison sentence, and she heard from him that her older son had passed away during her imprisonment.\nThe prison authorities didn’t allow Ms. Mou’s younger son to visit her until May 2023, when she had to be hospitalized. He was heartbroken to see a pale and emaciated woman who was unable to move, talk, or eat. He requested her immediate release but was repeatedly rejected. His mother died one month later on July 13, 2023.\nThe rest of the report presents newly obtained details about Ms. Mou’s abuse at the Heilongjiang Province Women’s Prison.\nMs. Mou was assigned to a cell on the fourth floor of the strict management team upon her admission in June 2020. Each cell there is about 430 square feet in size and houses 35-60 people, with five women sharing one double-bed. They had to sleep on their sides at night.\nThe guards allowed only five minutes for restroom breaks, another five minutes for brushing teeth and washing face, and 15 minutes for showers. Already 72 at the time, Ms. Mou struggled to keep up and often ended up with no restroom breaks or showers.\nHead inmate Wang Fengchun ordered Ms. Mou to sit on a small stool from morning to night every day. Sometimes she didn’t even allow Ms. Mou to sleep, and would often randomly grab a hard object to hit her.\nMs. Mou refused to admit guilt or answer roll call. The prison guards barred her from contacting her two sons. As a result, she had no one to deposit money into her commissary account, much less purchase additional daily necessities or food. Head inmate Wang even seized the only toilet paper Ms. Mou had with her upon admission.\nMs. Mou was moved to team 11 in January 2022, joining other steadfast Falun Gong practitioners. They were barred from any communication with their families. From around 5 a.m. to as late as 8 p.m. every day, the practitioners were made to sit on a small stool with their backs straight. There were also time limits for restroom use and showers.\nTwo sets of heaters were originally in the cell, but one set was removed to make the practitioners suffer during the cold winters. Ms. Mou, then 74 and the oldest in the cell, was made to sleep next to a window, which made it even colder for her.\nMs. Mou fell off her bed the first night after being moved to team 11 and injured her hand. The prison never rendered any medical attention to her. She had to rely on others to help her wash her clothes.\nThe relentless torture, plus no communication with her sons, crushed Ms. Mou. She developed a mental disorder and no longer recognized people. She also suffered fecal incontinence. Team lead Pang Shoumei beat her with heavy shoes and instructed other inmates to hit her, resulting in injuries all over her body. The inmates also poured cold water on her to freeze her. Her mental state worsened and she was heard screaming at night from time to time.\nThe guards moved Ms. Mou to the fifth floor in early 2023. Her cell was damp and cold with no sunlight. She was again assigned to a bed next to the window. Despite the use of two comforters, she still shivered from the cold. She and other practitioners were jailed in separate cells and not allowed to see each other. Except for meal times and restroom breaks, the practitioners were forced to sit on small stools from morning until 9 p.m. at night.\nThe practitioners were divided into five groups and required to take turns using the restroom. The next group needed to wait until the previous group exited the restroom before going in. Ms. Mou was verbally abused by head inmate Li Guimei the first day on the fifth floor because she was too “slow” in using the restroom. Other inmates often beat her with clothes hangers.\nA day or two before the Chinese New Year in 2023, Ms. Mou felt very weak and had to hold on to the restroom door frame as she lined up with her group. Inmate Yang Haiyan said she walked too slowly and gave her a sudden, hard push on the back, causing her to fall face down on the hard cement floor. After others helped her up, they saw that her face was swollen with blue bruises on her cheeks. From then on she was unable to squat to use the restroom. Only then did the prison remove the time limit for her restroom breaks. She suffered frequent urination as a result of the fall and had to get up in the middle of the night numerous times. The inmates beat her for disrupting their sleep.\nWith little food given to her, Ms. Mou was always hungry and suffered declining health. One of her teeth once fell out while she was chewing food. The prison however never notified her family of this nor rendered her any medical attention.\nMs. Mou’s condition kept worsening. She was eventually unable to keep food down. The prison accused her of “going on a hunger strike.” She died in custody on July 13, 2023.\nRelated reports:\n75-Year-Old Retired Teacher Dies in Heilongjiang Province Women’s Prison\n75-Year-Old Woman Tortured to Mental Disorder While Serving Six Years for Her Faith\nHeilongjiang Teacher, 72, Sentenced to Six Years for Her Faith\nMother and Son Are Deprived of Their Right to Social Identities\nDisabled Elderly Woman Detained for Two Months for Her Faith, Authorities Give Family the Runaround\nFalun Gong Freed Ms. Mou Yongxia from Illnesses, Persecution Put Her Back in Danger\nHarbin Railway Police Actively Persecute Falun Gong Practitioners\nCopyright © 1999-2025 Minghui.org.

    "text": "Country music star Kane Brown gave some gas station employees a ride home in a snowstorm, according to his wife, Katelyn. \"Kane went to the gas station this morning and has been seeing people working,\" Katelyn shared Monday on her Instagram Story. \"So, he's giving them rides home from work. He gave them his number and told them to call whenever they got off work, and he would give them rides home.\" He followed through on that promise, she said, and Katelyn patiently awaited her husband's return. \"So currently Kane is like the Uber driver of Nashville,\" she joked. Earlier in the day, Katelyn posted a video of Kane in a RZR 1000, a four-wheeler that's able to drive over tough terrains and snow. This weekend's storm doused Nashville in three to nine inches of snow , shut down freeways and airports, and temperatures aren't expected to rise above freezing until Thursday. Last week, though, Kane and Katelyn had something to celebrate. The couple revealed the sex of their third baby. \"Baby boy brown. coming 2024,\" they announced on Instagram with the help of their two daughters Kingsley, 4, and Kodi, 2. Kane is set to kick off the In the Air Tour in Charlottesville, Va., on March 28.",

A empresa refere que conseguiu recuperar alguns dos dados reunidos pelo New York Times mas, tendo em conta que estão incompletos, não podem ser usados nos procedimentos legais.\nO New York Times e outros órgãos de comunicação social deram início a esta batalha judicial em dezembro do ano passado e procuram provar que a OpenAI (e a Microsoft) desenvolveram as suas ferramentas de IA “copiando e usando milhões” dos seus artigos e reportagens para agora “competir diretamente” com as publicações.\nSobre este acidente da OpenAI, os advogados do New York Times já sublinharam que não têm motivos para crer que este caso não tenha sido nada mais do que um erro.\nLeia Também: [EUA.

La invitación a Vladimir Putin, que se ha aclarado se trata de un acto protocolario, causó críticas hacia la virtual presidenta electa, pues el mandatario ruso ha sido señalado de actuar de forma antidemocrática. TE PUEDE INTERESAR: [‘Práctica protocolaria’, Sheinbaum justifica invitación a Putin a toma de posesión](https://vanguardia.com.mx/noticias/practica-protocolaria-sheinbaum-justifica-invitacion-a-putin-a-toma-de-posesion-FN12860603) “México se está poniendo en una posición muy comprometida con el país que más económicamente lo apoya”, expresó el funcionario del Departamento de Estado de Estados Unidos. EU y Rusia están en conflicto, entre otros motivos, por la invasión que Putin mantiene en Ucrania desde febrero de 2022, país que ha sido apoyado por el gobierno de Joe Biden. Fue la prensa rusa la que reveló la invitación de México a Putin. Ante el revuelo causado, el futuro secretario de Relaciones Exteriores, Juan Ramón de la Fuente, tuvo que salir a aclarar que la convocatoria se hizo al país como una “práctica protocolaria” que se hace con todas las naciones con los que México mantiene relaciones. De la Fuente explicó que “cada país decide a quién manda” como representante. Claudia Sheinbaum respaldó lo dicho por quien será su titular de la SRE al manifestar que son “notas diplomáticas que se envían normalmente cuando hay tomas de posesión (presidencial) y se envían a todos los países en donde hay relaciones”. FELICITA PUTIN A CLAUDIA Luego de la invitación, a través de la [embajada de Rusia en México](https://mexico.mid.ru/es/), Putin respondió a la invitación y felicitó a [Sheinbaum](https://www.instagram.com/claudia_shein/). “Le ruego acepte mis sinceras felicitaciones por su victoria en las elecciones presidenciales. México es un socio tradicionalmente amistoso de Rusia en la región latinoamericana. Confiamos en que su actividad en el cargo presidencial contribuirá al desarrollo ulterior de la cooperación constructiva entre nuestros países. Le deseo éxito en su gestión pública, así como salud y bienestar”, compartió la embajada en su cuenta de X.

Petición que hoy fue rechazada por el mandatario porque “no nos corresponde”.
