    "text": "El destino de Portugal preferido por los sevillanos que una revista de viajes aconseja no visitar La masificación de esta localización costera es el principal motivo argumentado por la revista especializada Viajar para desaconsejarla como destino para las vacaciones [Así es «el pueblo más feo» de Sevilla según una revista de viajes](https://www.abc.es/sevilla/provincia/pueblo-feo-sevilla-segun-revista-viajes-20240826193448-nts.html) Portugal es uno de los destinos predilectos de muchos andaluces y sevillanos dada la cercanía geográfica de sus costas con nuestra tierra. Por ello, el impresionante litoral del Algarve, con playas de vistas espectaculares, se erige como una opción más que atractiva para numerosas personas. Sin embargo, la prestigiosa revista especializada Viajar desaconseja la visita a este rincón del suroeste peninsular. A pesar de sus virtudes: esas larguísimas playas de arena blanca y la arquitectura natural que proporcionan sus acantilados y cuevas con calas que todo el mundo quiere inmortalizar, precisamente el efecto llamada que ha generado una costa tan fotogénica ha provocado una masificación que la vuelve incómoda para el turista. Por ejemplo, entrar en una de estas calas en las que los rayos de sol se cuelan entre los huecos de las rocas «se multa con hasta 216.000 euros, una dura medida con la que las autoridades buscan evitar el continuo desgaste que causan los numerosos visitantes». El 'boom' experimentado por este enclave ha derivado en esta situación. Los precios tampoco ayudan Otro motivo de peso es el precio del viaje. Tavira, Faro, Albufeira, Portimao o Lagos son algunas de las atractivas ciudades turísticas que se reparten por la costa del Algarve y que tradicionalmente han acogido a muchos visitantes de nuestro país, especialmente sevillanos, onubenses y extremeños. La mayoría suponía antaño un interesante ahorro frente a las playas españolas. Sin embargo, hoy por hoy se han encarecido tanto que viajar al sur de Portugal es equivalente a hacerlo a la Costa del Sol en muchos casos. Es por ello que la popular revista de viajes la ha incluido en el primer lugar dentro de su lista de lugares evitables para las escapadas a causa de la masificación turística. Una lista que incluye también puntos como Llanes, en Asturias, o las islas Baleares.",

REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo\n18 Oct 2024 04:06AM (Updated: 18 Oct 2024 12:23PM) Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn LOS ANGELES :Netflix picked up 5.1 million streaming subscribers in the third quarter, topping Wall Street estimates by more than 1 million, and said it expected higher customer growth around the holidays when Korean drama \"Squid Game\" returns.\nShares of Netflix rose 4.8 per cent in after-hours trading on Thursday following the earnings report. The shares have gained about 47 per cent so far this year.\nAs the pace of subscriber addition slows, Netflix has been trying to shift investor attention away from sign-ups to metrics including revenue growth and profit margins. It will stop reporting subscriber data from next year, and is touting growth in its ad-supported plans.\nThe streaming giant said on Thursday its ad-supported service accounted for more than 50 per cent of signups in the third quarter in countries where it was available.\nWall Street had expected Netflix to bring in 4 million subscribers from July through September, according to analysts' estimates compiled by LSEG. New programming during the period included murder mystery \"The Perfect Couple\" and romantic comedy \"Nobody Wants This.\"\nNetflix earned $5.40 per share in the quarter, above the consensus forecast of $5.12. Operating margin hit 30 per cent in the quarter, compared with 22 per cent a year earlier.\nRevenue rose to $9.825 billion, just ahead of the $9.769 billion consensus forecast.\n\"On the surface, Netflix is trending in all the right directions,\" said Forrester analyst Mike Proulx. \"Financially, revenue and operating margins continue to increase and expenses are down.\"\nBut while the customer additions outpaced forecasts, they were below the 8.76 million that Netflix picked up in the year-ago quarter.\n\"A steep decline in net new subscribers is what’s concerning. While there’s room for net subscriber growth internationally, in the U.S. things are getting tapped out,\" Proulx said.\nNetflix projected its customer additions for the last three months of the year - traditionally a strong period around the holidays - would outpace the September quarter, though it did not provide a number. The second season of Korean drama \"Squid Game\" is scheduled for release in late December.\n\"We're feeling really good about the business,\" Co-CEO Ted Sarandos said in a post-earnings video. \"We had a plan to re-accelerate the business, and we delivered on that plan.\"\n'CRAWL, WALK, RUN'\nThe company said its programming volume had picked up following disruptions from last year's Hollywood strikes. Engagement, the time spent watching Netflix, averaged two hours per day per member.\nWhile Netflix has reported subscriber gains in its ad-supported tier, it does not expect advertising to become a primary growth driver until 2026.\n\"They consistently remind us of crawl, walk, run and I think, yeah, it's still definitely the beginning,\" said Magalie Grossheim, senior equity research analyst at M Science. \"In our data, we continue to see that the selection rate for the ad-supported plan is accelerating in a lot of the mature markets.\"\nPart of the plan centers around live events including sports, a big draw for advertisers. In November, Netflix will stream a fight between YouTube star Jake Paul and Mike Tyson, followed by two National Football League games on Christmas Day.\nThe company also plans to increase prices in Spain and Italy on Friday. Earlier this month, it raised prices in a few European markets and in Japan.\nSarandos has rejected the idea of adding Netflix to a discounted bundle with other streaming services such as Walt Disney and Warner Bros Discovery.\n\"What we're focused on is adding more and more value to this package,\" Sarandos said on Thursday, calling this a \"comfortable model\" for traditional media companies.\nSource: Reuters Sign up for our newsletters Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox\nSubscribe here Get the CNA app Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories\nDownload here Get WhatsApp alerts\nJoin our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app\nJoin here Advertisement Also worth reading Content is loading...

    "text": "The recent (January 22, 2024) pranpratishtha (consecration) ceremony at the Ram Temple in Ayodhya has been a major spectacle.\nThis has accompanied promotion of the mass display of religiosity in most parts of the country, more so in North India. This also saw the fusion of roles ‘chief of religion’ and ‘chief of political power’ into a single person, the prime minister.\nIt was immediately followed by Narendra Modi inaugurating another big temple (Shri Swaminayan) in Abu Dhabi with gaiety and publicity. And lo and behold foundation for another temple in Chambal, Kalki Dham, was also done by Modi a couple of days ago. Impressed by the serial temple events many right-wing ideologues are claiming that the prime minister is the first statesman from the post-colonial world to move towards decolonisation of cultures in the post-colonial societies.\nAgainst journey towards equality\nHow did colonialism affect South Asia in particular? South Asia was predominantly a feudal type society, ruled by the landlord-Kings legitimised by the clergy. The British succeeded in colonising most parts of South Asia, Indian subcontinent in particular. Their primary focus was on plundering its wealth and creating markets for its goods being produced in England.\nIt had to lay the structure of a colonial state in which transport, education and foundations of modern administration were laid down. Incidentally, they also supported eradication of some of the ghastly practices like sati. For other reforms the likes of Jotirao Phule, Savitribai Phule, B.R. Ambedkar and M.K. Gandhi moved mountains to bring in reforms and cultural changes.\nThe culture of society is not a static thing. It did start changing in multiple ways during the colonial period. While a blind aping of the West was a small part of cultural change, the major accompanying part was the journey towards a society with equality. These were baby steps towards the culture of industrial-modern society in India. This was looked down by the conservative political forces like Muslim League, Hindu Mahasabha and the RSS. They were essentially piqued by the journey towards equality of the downtrodden, they were opposed to it and they labeled it as being ‘Western’.\nOn these lines they called the Indian Constitution, embodiment of India’s political culture, as being based on Western values. One recalls that the ideologues of Hindu right were totally opposed to the ideology which talks of equality. In opposition to this they harp on holy books like Manu Smriti, which were talking of inequality of caste and gender.\nInterestingly, the social forces which had roots in the feudal power structure stuck to the ‘anti-Western narrative’. Simultaneously, they collaborated with the colonial rulers. In a sharp contrast, the national movement was opposing colonial rulers and also shaping the culture of the country.\nThe ‘Muslim Brotherhood’ (West Asia) is yet another example. It referred to democratic culture and values as Western import and tried to impose dictatorial norms and social inequality in the name of Islam.\nIn the name of Indian culture\nIn India, the Hindu right wing seeks to oppose equality as being a Western import. The opposition to the values of Indian Constitution is also couched in the garb of opposition to colonial culture and is propagated as glorification of the Indian culture. So, what is being called as opposing colonial culture at times is the culture which bases itself to oppose fraternity and justice.\nJustice for all, irrespective of caste and gender, has been the goal of emerging Indian democracy; this gives space to pluralism and diversity. Amongst the post-colonial states, India had the best political journey till a few decades ago. This was also accompanied by a culture, which had continuity and change. It was reflected in the life patterns promoted by the likes of Gandhi and Nehru, Subhash Bose and Maulana Azad, to name a few. This was an attempt to tune the culture which is compatible with democratic values.\nAlso read: Four Decades of Milking a Deity in Ayodhya\nFalse assumption\nThe spree of temple related events is accompanied by the assertion that this is the decolonisation of culture. Moreover, the impression being created that the inauguration of the temple in Abu Dhabi is the first one in the ‘Muslim countries’ of West Asia is totally false.\nIt is a known fact that there are many temples in the region – UAE, Muscat, Bahrain and Oman to name the few. As the global migrations, economic in this case, of Indians are accompanied by the temples in the region, it is important to recall that there are many temples in our neighbouring Muslim countries as well.\nFor instance, the Dhakeshwari Temple in Bangladesh is popular. There are multiple temples existing in Pakistan as well. Notably, Lal Krishna Advani had visited Pakistan in 2005 for the launch of the restoration work of Katasraj Temple.\nGlorification and conservatism\nThe glorification of Modi for ensuring a Hindu temple is unwarranted. To assert that by inaugurating temples in India and in Abu Dhabi, Modi is showing the conviction to bring in decolonisation is totally misplaced.\nIn India, the colonial impact was undone during the freedom movement itself, as the roots of progressive social steps and progressive writings and theatre also ran parallel with national movement. Post-independence, the process continued with Nehru’s encouragement of scientific temper and Ambedkar’s well drafted Indian constitution.\nIndia did not get subdued by the colonial culture in totality. What we are facing today is the promotion of religiosity and conservatism during the last few decades. Since politics is stalking the streets in the garb of religion, our culture is coming under the attack from conservative and orthodox values. The hilarious example of this is the opposition by BJP associate VHP and company legally challenging the forest department to let the lion Akbar co-habit the lioness Sita.\nAs far as Abu Dhabi is concerned, not only Abu Dhabi but the whole of West Asia has suffered the onslaught of orthodox values due to the promotion of Islamic fundamentalism by the USA. In pursuit of its control over oil resources, it had overthrown the democratically elected Government of Mossadegh in Iran in 1953 paving the way for fundamentalist regime in due course. Later it was instrumental in propping up madrassas in Pakistan to train Mujahedeen, Al Qaeda with huge funding and also supplying them with armaments. This whole American intervention shifted the West Asian culture towards a retrograde one.\nThe inauguration of the temple in Abu Dhabi in no way can undo the cultural damage done to West Asia by the global forces with infinite ‘hunger for oil’. Temples are one part of the culture. The definition of culture has to be much broader than just temple-related events.\nRam Puniyani is president of the Centre for Study of Society and Secularism.\n ",

    "text": "Donald Trump will not get a new trial in his case against E. Jean Carroll, after federal Judge Lewis Kaplan on Thursday denied the former president's request. Trump was ordered to pay Carroll , an advice columnist, $83.3 million, after a New York jury ruled in January that he had defamed her in 2019 by denying her allegations of sexual assault. The ruling and heavy sum was on top of $5 million Trump already owed Carroll from an earlier case last year, in which a civil jury found he had sexually assaulted and defamed her again in 2022. Did Donald Trump rape E. Jean Carroll? Here's what a jury and judge said. Judge Kaplan rejected Trump's latest attempt to avoid paying over $80 million, finding in his rulin g Thursday the former president's motion for a new trial or judgment \"without merit\" and the amount in damages appropriate. \"Mr. Trump’s malicious and unceasing attacks on Ms. Carroll were disseminated to more than 100 million people,\" the judge wrote. \"They included public threats and personal attacks, and they endangered Ms. Carroll’s health and safety. The jury was entitled to conclude that Mr. Trump derailed the career, reputation, and emotional well-being of one of America’s most successful and prominent advice columnists and authors.\"",

    "text": "Star gazers ready to witness rare ‘planetary parade’\nLucknow: Sky enthusiasts are in for a rare celestial treat known as a planetary parade when six planets – Mars, Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune and Uranus-- will align in the evening sky on Jan 25.\nLucknow University's department of mathematics and astronomy is organising a special viewing event for students, offering telescopic assistance to better observe this spectacle.\nThe alignment will be visible shortly after sunset, with Venus and Jupiter shining brightly, making them the easiest to spot. Mars will be seen higher in the sky with its distinct reddish hue. While Saturn will be visible to the naked eyes Uranus and Neptune will require telescopes due to their distance and dimness.\nProf Alka Misra of the department said: \"This planetary parade is fascinating occurrence. While alignments of 3 to 5 planets are common, the coming together of 6 or 7 planets is rare. Offering our students a glimpse of this vast and interconnected solar system will not only inspire curiosity but also foster a deeper understanding of the universe.\"\nSuch alignments are visually stunning and occur when planets appear close together in the sky due to their positions in their respective orbits. For the best viewing experience, stargazers are encouraged to visit areas with minimal light pollution, ensuring a clear and uninterrupted view of this celestial spectacle.",

    "text": "Roanoke initiative shapes next generation of health science researchers\nThis fall, a third cohort of Virginia Tech undergraduate students began the Integrated Health Sciences and Research experience.\nWhen not in class, a select group of undergraduate students are running experiments, shadowing physicians, and operating state-of-the-art biomedical research equipment.\nThrough a unique opportunity available at Virginia Tech’s [Health Sciences and Technology](https://hst.vt.edu) campus in Roanoke, these students are not just learning — they are receiving hands-on training to help them prepare for careers in research, medicine, and beyond.\nThis year, a third cohort joins the interdisciplinary experience, which began in fall 2022.\n“The Integrated Health Sciences and Research initiative began as a collaboration between the Virginia Tech College of Science and the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute at VTC,” said Sarah Clinton, co-director of the program and associate vice president for health sciences planning and strategy. “However, we now have students majoring in biomedical engineering, biochemistry, public health, psychology, and human nutrition, foods, and exercise.”\nThe most recent cohort brings total enrollment to 51 students representing nine majors and four colleges. Though from different academic disciplines, these students are united by shared interests in clinical work and health research.\nJack Horton is a third-year biochemistry major who was accepted in the spring.\n“I’ve always been interested in science,” said Horton, who joined Professor Steven Poelzing’s lab at the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute this summer. It marks the pre-med student’s first laboratory research experience. “But this is the first time I’m learning science by working with people who are at the peak of our understanding of the subject.”\nThe Integrated Health Sciences and Research undergraduate experience is designed as a three-year commitment. After applying in December, accepted students participate in a spring orientation. The academic curriculum officially begins the following fall, the start of sophomore year for most students in the cohort. That semester, students take an introductory course in biomedical and health research and match with labs at the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute, where they earn academic credit and work in research labs for the duration of the experience.\nThrough elective courses, students can shadow Carilion clinicians, analyze and interpret scientific literature, and build skills for presenting and writing about their scientific discoveries.\n“I would love to get published,” said Horton, whose lab responsibilities include culturing human kidney cells. “It's cool that I am contributing to something that could eventually become a solution for everyday patient treatment.”\nHarbal Rai also hopes to see her efforts translate into improved patient outcomes. Now in her final semester, Rai balances lab responsibilities with her senior course load and her work as an EMT. The undergraduate student has commuted from Blacksburg to Roanoke weekly since joining Assistant Professor Sharon Swanger’s lab.\n“I’m someone who always wants to try new things,” Rai said. “The program captures all of the things I’m really interested in, and the faculty really want you to do well. Right off the bat, I was already starting my own experiments and doing my own data analysis and seeing projects all the way through.”\nRecent Integrated Health Sciences and Research graduates have gone on to careers with INOVA Health and doctoral programs at Virginia Tech's College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, the Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine, the Medical College of Wisconsin, and Johns Hopkins University. One graduate is a trainee at the National Institutes of Health.\n“We look for first- and second-year students who are passionate about biomedicine, aspiring to become health professionals, or eager to delve into clinical and translational research,” Clinton said.\n[Applications](https://hst.vt.edu/campus/IHSR.html) for the fall 2025 cohort open Dec. 2 and close Jan. 31.",
