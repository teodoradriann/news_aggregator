    "text": "Ken Paxton files second lawsuit against TikTok for exposing minors to explicit content\n[Sign up for The Brief](https://www.texastribune.org/newsletters/the-brief/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=trib-ads-owned&utm_campaign=trib-marketing&utm_term=inline-CTA-brief), The Texas Tribune’s daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news.\nTexas Attorney General [Ken Paxton](https://www.texastribune.org/directory/ken-paxton/) on Thursday sued TikTok for the second time in recent months, accusing the social media company of violating deceptive trade law by downplaying its addictiveness and exposing children to explicit material.\nThe suit argues that TikTok, a short-form video app, violated the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act by listing itself on app stores as appropriate for children and not enforcing its community guidelines effectively. The Apple App Store lists TikTok as rated for those 12 and older, while the Microsoft and Google Play Stores list the app as appropriate for users who are 13 and older.\nThe 66-page filing, which has several redactions, details several TikTok posts containing inappropriate material that seemingly violate the guidelines and ways the app can circumvent parental controls on smartphones through an in-app browser. At one point, the lawsuit states the inappropriate material also included child sexual abuse content, although that section of the suit is largely redacted.\n“TikTok actively worked to deceive parents and lure children onto their app despite the presence of an overwhelming amount of profane and illicit material,” Paxton said in a statement Thursday. “Companies may not jeopardize the health and wellbeing of Texas children by blatantly lying about the products they provide.”\nA spokesperson for TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nSeveral times the suit references an investigation conducted by the state that found videos which contained depictions of drug use, self-harm and sexually explicit acts. In December, Paxton’s office [announced](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/attorney-general-ken-paxton-launches-investigations-characterai-reddit-instagram-discord-and-other) it would investigate several social media platforms’ privacy and safety practices for children, however the office did not clarify in its announcement Thursday whether the investigation mentioned in the lawsuit was related.\nBut depending on a ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court, TikTok may not be accessible to anyone in the country for much longer. The platform has stated it would pull all activity from the U.S. on Jan. 19 if the Supreme Court does not strike down a bipartisan law mandating its parent company, ByteDance, sell TikTok.\nThe Supreme Court is set to hear arguments Friday on the law, which makes it illegal for providers like Apple to have applications available that are owned by foreign adversaries. ByteDance is based in China, and the law was primarily aimed at forcing the TikTok sale. ByteDance is also named in the lawsuit Paxton filed Thursday.\nsent weekday mornings.\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google\n[Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and\n[Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms) apply.\nThis is the second lawsuit Paxton has filed against TikTok in just over three months, as the attorney general’s office [filed a suit](https://www.texastribune.org/2024/10/03/ken-paxton-texas-lawsuit-tiktok/) accusing the company of violating the new Securing Children Online through Parental Empowerment Act. [The SCOPE Act](https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=88R&Bill=HB18), which has received its own legal challenges, forbids companies from selling a minor’s personal information without parental approval, and the October lawsuit claims TikTok circumvented the law several times. The new lawsuit was filed in the same Galveston federal district as the first suit, and dozens of other lawsuits against social media platforms have been filed across the country in recent years.\nTexas lawmakers have weighed bringing restrictions or [outright bans](https://www.texastribune.org/2024/12/05/texas-ban-social-media-as-schools-struggle/) on social media platforms like TikTok for minors as some are exposed to harmful content, but free speech advocacy organizations and tech companies have balked. Several bills have been filed ahead of the 2025 Texas legislative session, one of which could potentially restrict minors from creating accounts on the sites altogether.\nDisclosure: Apple, Google and Microsoft have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

    "title": "Messy Divorce Ahead? Expert Claims Michelle & Barack Obama's Body Language Can't Hide the Signs of Trouble",
    "text": "Former First Lady Michelle Obama and Barack Obama are among the most popular couples. They have set a very high standard in front of the world in terms of partnership and togetherness. The duo has gone through the highest of the highs and lowest of the lows in the public eye like a rock standing by each other’s side.\nYet, most of 2024 has been hard for Michelle Obama since her absence from Donald Trump ‘s inaugural ceremony and Jimmy Carter’s funeral sparked alleged divorce rumors between the couple, which, by the way, she dismissed in a bold and authentic conversation.\nAs per Nicki Swift, the 61-year-old lady made an appearance on the Diary of a CEO podcast explaining that she and Barack’s choice not to broadcast their personal life, like going on dates, had fueled speculation. She noted calmly, “We’re 60—you’re not going to know what we’re doing every minute.”\nHowever, would the media leave a woman no? Hell no! Recently, a body language expert said their recent podcast appearance may have unintentionally confirmed those whispers. She addressed the divorce speculation once again during an episode of her “IMO” podcast. Barack joined his wife and her brother, Craig Robinson , in what appeared to be an effort to silence the ongoing rumors.\nHappy anniversary, @MichelleObama ! 32 years together, and I couldn’t have asked for a better partner and friend to go through life with. pic.twitter.com/04t41YYfN6\n— Barack Obama (@BarackObama) October 3, 2024\nThe subtle cues caught by an expert suggest the couple may have gone through severe marital strain. It all began when the former FLOTUS made a lighthearted yet revealing comment in June. On the show, guest Angie Martinez mentioned Michelle could have had a son. She replied jokingly, “I’m so glad I didn’t have a boy. Because he would’ve been a Barack Obama.”\nEagle-eyed fans criticized the comment after which, during the July 16 episode, Barack greeted Michelle with a hug and played along with her brother’s teasing . “She took me back… It was touch and go for a while,” Barack joked. But one expert believes there was more truth to that than humor.\nFormer president Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama addressed speculation about a divorce in her new podcast episode.\n“She took me back!” Barack Obama joked. “It was touch and go for awhile!” https://t.co/nvNE2Ksel5 pic.twitter.com/NQeM43w91W\n— The Washington Post (@washingtonpost) July 16, 2025\nNicki Swift consulted Traci Brown, a body language expert and behavior analyst, who analyzed the couple’s conduct in the podcast and said that their “touch and go” joke could actually hint at real past issues. “People don’t usually say things like that unless there’s truth behind it,” she explained.\nEven more telling were her facial expressions. Brown pointed out that Michelle’s blink rate slowed dramatically while discussing the hard times in their marriage, which is an alleged sign of internal sorrow. “She kept her eyes closed while mentioning difficult moments, which signals there’s more she’s not saying.”\nBarack and Michelle Obama are now trying to squash rumors that their marriage is on the rocks.\nMichelle is so blatantly lying. You can easily tell by the forced delivery.\nThey should both just admit that their marriage is a total sham.\n(pagesix on TT) pic.twitter.com/VN6M5F4uKg\n— Paul A. Szypula 🇺🇸 (@Bubblebathgirl) July 16, 2025\nIn addition, Traci Brown also highlighted her attempt to shut down divorce talk. “There hasn’t been one moment in our marriage where I have thought about quitting on my man,” Michelle said during the podcast. However, Lady Obama’s twisting of words was telling. “She doesn’t say, ‘I always wanted to stay with him.’ That choice of words shows that leaving him was at least considered,” she said.\nMeanwhile, in another episode of IMO podcast, she is seen conversing with Julia Louis-Dreyfus about how her life changed since Barack’s Presidential term ended. “I mean, at this stage in life for me, personally, is the first time I’ve been completely free,”\nShe continued, “There’s been a release where every choice I make is not about my husband, not about his career, not about my family, not about what my kids need or where they’re going, it’s totally about me.”\nThe couple who have been together since 1992 share two daughters with him. Despite their united front and lighthearted banter, the expert believes there’s more truth than what Lady Obama tells everyone in front of the camera.\nObama and Michelle married on October 3, 1992. After suffering a miscarriage, Michelle underwent in vitro fertilisation to conceive their daughters Malia Ann (born 1998) and Natasha (known as Sasha, born 2001). The Obama family lived on Chicago’s South Side, where Barack taught… pic.twitter.com/YSPIteGiLf\n— AlphaBravoCharlie (@alphabravo1947) January 3, 2024\nWhile the mother of two seems to be thriving in her career even after completing her role as first lady with podcast shows, entrepreneurial ventures, and brand deals, is there nothing going on between Barack and her, or has she gotten better at hiding things, just like all other public figures who face the spotlight every day?",

    "title": "M. United - Rangers: El Manchester United recurre a la épica y a un Bruno Fernandes salvador - Europa League",
    "text": "N o tiene partido tranquilo el Manchester United. Ante el Rangers en Europa League, una nueva muestra. Se impusieron 2-1 gracias a un gol de Bruno Fernandes en el descuento después de que el Rangers les empatara en el minuto 88. Son cuartos y dependerán de si mismos para clasificar directamente a los octavos.\nEn una temporada tan complicada como la que está viviendo el Manchester United, los de Amorim se jugaban mucho en casa ante el Rangers. Un 'clásico' del fútbol británico que enfrentaba a dos equipos históricos de las islas. Y que estuvo muy apretado.\nEl United empezó bien. Garnacho, envuelto en rumores de mercado en torno a Nápoles y Chelsea, tuvo la primera. Respondió rápido el Rangers y Raskin perdonó en un mano a mano por culpa de un control que se le fue largo. Mientras, Bayindir, hoy titular por delante de Onana, se hacía grande.\nEl turco fue uno de los mejores del United y sacó varias manos de mérito en el primer tiempo, destacando una ante su compatriota Ridvan Yilmaz al primer palo. La más clara, no obstante, no valía. Anuló el VAR un gol de Matthijs de Ligt a la salida de un córner por una falta previa de Leny Yoro.\nPero a Amorim, por una vez, le quedaba el comodín de la fortuna porque si el guión del segundo tiempo parecía que no iba a cambiar... sí lo hizo gracias a un regalo de Jack Butland. Eriksen sacó el córner y el meta inglés, ex del United aunque no debutó, se la metió en su portería con un despeje terrorífico.\nEl error de Butland que supuso el 1-0. LAPRESSE. Desde ahí todo fue cuesta abajo para los 'Red Devils'. Tuvo alguna ocasión aislada al Rangers pero el encuentro estaba bajo control. Garnacho tuvo la sentencia tras un jugadón de Amad Diallo pero la mandó al palo; Lisandro Martínez también pudo anotar, pero esta vez sí estuvo acertado Butland.\nUn final de locura Todo saltó por los aires al final, cuando los nervios llegaron a los jugadores del United. Primero, hubo susto. Dessers cazó un balón al espacio, la picó sobre Bayindir y se topó con el poste. La acción, eso sí, estaba anulada por fuera de juego. Y ya en el minuto 88, lo que apuntaba a drama: Dessers no perdonaba esta vez tras un error en la marca de Maguire.\nPero Bruno Fernandes acudió al rescate. El portugués cazó la espalda a su marcador y anotó el 2-1 tras un grandísimo centro de Lisandro Martínez. Era el gol de la victoria y llegaba en el minuto 92. Amorim, al límite.\nEl luso, no obstante, ha ganado sus tres partidos como técnico del Manchester United en Europa League. Y ya son cuartos, con 15 puntos. Cerrarán la 'fase liga' en Bucarest (ante el FCSB, que es octavo) y dependen de si mismos para 'saltarse' el 'playoff'.",
