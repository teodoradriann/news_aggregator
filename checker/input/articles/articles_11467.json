    "text": "AFP News Son of Gaza hostage on emotional visit to father's homeland Poland Michael BLUM 5 May 2024 at 10:59 pm · 3- His father, of whom he has had no news for months, has dedicated his life to passing on the memory of the Holocaust (Pablo GONZALEZ)\nYuval Dancyg could not hold back his tears.\nOn Sunday, the Israeli flew to Poland, the homeland of his father Alex, taken hostage by Hamas militants during the October 7 attack on Israel.\nFor Holocaust Remembrance Day, Yuval joined an Israeli delegation that will take part in an annual march to commemorate the victims of the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp, located in the southern city of Oswiecim.\nHis father, of whom he has had no news for months, has dedicated his life to passing on the memory of the Holocaust. He is an educator who has trained guides accompanying visitors to the camp.\n\"I dream of coming back here with my father, having him explain every spot to me,\" Yuval said while walking along the streets of the nearby city of Krakow.\nBorn in Poland, Alex Dancyg, 75, moved to Israel in 1957. Last year, he was captured by Hamas militants from his home in the Nir Oz kibbutz, near the border with Gaza.\nIsrael responded to the October 7 attack with a retaliatory offensive.\nSome of those hostages released during the truce in late November also joined the Israeli delegation to the March of the Living, which will be held on Monday.\n- 'Alex taught us all' -\nEvery year, thousands of Jews and non-Jews from around the world take part in the event at the site of the former death camp, which was built by Nazi Germany after it invaded Poland.\nOne million European Jews died at the camp between 1940 and 1945 along with around 80,000 non-Jewish Poles, 25,000 Roma and 20,000 Soviet soldiers.\nThe camp was liberated by the Red Army in January 1945.\nYuval is brought to tears when the Israeli delegation's guides mention his father while the group tours the streets of the former Jewish ghetto of Krakow.\nWearing a T-shirt with an image of Alex, one guide from Israel reveals that Yuval's father had trained him in Israel.\n\"He was my teacher and taught me how to lead groups in Poland,\" Zohar Vlosky, 56, said, after giving Yuval a hug.\nFellow guide Adi Dadon clutched a book written by Alex in Hebrew about Krakow. The 40-year-old said: \"Alex taught us all.\"\n\"I'm part of the generations of guides who lead groups not only with the help of his books but also with an awareness of the complexity of his ties to Poland, where he was born, and Israel, his country,\" Dadon said.\n- 'I can only hope' -\nOn the occasion of this year's Holocaust Remembrance Day, observed from Sunday evening to Monday, Dadon points out that there are fundamental differences between the Holocaust and the October 7 attack.\nBut he says he understands that the members of the Israeli delegation could in some ways feel similar things to those who survived the Holocaust.\nYuval rejects the comparison. \"Each of the events has its own particularity,\" he says.\nYuval is wearing a yellow ribbon, the symbol of solidarity with the hostages taken by Hamas, as well as a \"Bring Them Home Now\" dog tag.\nThe war in Gaza broke out after Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli figures.\nThe militants also took some 250 hostages, of whom Israel estimates 128 remain in Gaza. The army says 35 of them are dead.\nVowing to destroy Hamas, Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 34,683 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.\nAt Nir Oz, around 75 people were taken hostage on October 7, including Alex.\n\"It has been 212 days since he was taken and for 150 days we have had no news of him,\" said Yuval.\n\"I can only hope that he's doing okay.\"\nmib-amj/jj",

    "title": "GAO Warns of Quantum Threat to U.S. Cybersecurity Amid Leadership and Strategy Gaps",
    "text": "Insider Brief\n- A GAO report warns that the U.S. faces significant cybersecurity risks from quantum computing due to leadership gaps and an incomplete national strategy.\n- While efforts to develop post-quantum cryptography and secure federal systems are underway, critical infrastructure sectors lack clear guidance and support for the transition.\n- The report calls for the Office of the National Cyber Director to take charge, coordinate efforts, and address funding and accountability gaps to mitigate the growing threat.\nThe U.S. faces a critical cybersecurity threat as quantum computers edge closer to disrupting the cryptographic systems that secure vital government and infrastructure data, according to [a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report](https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-25-107703.pdf). Without clear leadership and a cohesive national strategy, experts warn, the nation remains vulnerable.\nWhat’s at Stake?\nCryptography is the backbone of modern cybersecurity, protecting everything from classified government communications to financial transactions and energy systems, the report states. It works by using complex mathematical puzzles that take conventional computers years — or even centuries — to solve. But quantum computers, with their unique capabilities, could theoretically bypass these defenses in hours, according to the GAO.\nThe report also recognizes a need for action now, even if quantum computers powerful enough to hack current cryptographic schemes remain in the future.\n“Adversaries could intercept sensitive information today, store it, and decrypt it later when quantum computers become more powerful,” GAO analysts wrote. Known as “harvest now, decrypt later,” this threat means action is needed now to secure data for the future.\nThe development of a cryptographically relevant quantum computer (CRQC) — one capable of breaking these mathematical defenses — could happen within the next 10 to 20 years, the report estimates. This timeline has left federal agencies and critical infrastructure owners scrambling to prepare.\nA Patchwork Strategy\nAlthough the U.S. has taken steps to address these risks, the GAO found the national quantum cybersecurity strategy lacking in several areas. Efforts so far have focused on three main goals: creating new cryptographic methods resistant to quantum attacks (post-quantum cryptography, or PQC), transitioning federal systems to these methods and encouraging private industries to follow suit.\nHowever, the GAO report points out that while the first two goals are partially addressed, the third — bringing industries like finance, healthcare, and utilities on board — has been neglected. Milestones for federal agencies are incomplete, and there are no performance measures to gauge progress.\nCritical infrastructure sectors have not received clear guidance or support for the transition to post-quantum cryptography, GAO analysts suggest, adding that this could leave some of the most essential systems unprotected.\nThe report states: “The government’s quantum computing cybersecurity strategy documents identified objectives and activities for the first two goals related to standardizing PQC and transitioning federal agency systems to PQC. However, the documents did not fully define objectives or activities for the\nother goal of encouraging all sectors — including critical infrastructure — to migrate to PQC.”\nLeadership Void\nOne of the report’s starkest findings is the lack of a central authority to oversee and coordinate these efforts. The GAO singled out the [Office of the National Cyber Director](https://www.whitehouse.gov/oncd/) (ONCD), established in 2021, as the agency best positioned to fill this gap. However, the ONCD has not yet embraced this role, leaving agencies and private companies without a unified direction.\nThe leadership vacuum could be slowing progress and increasing risks. Without clear accountability, participants may be left uncertain about their responsibilities and objectives, the report indicates.\nThe Price of Protection\nSecuring federal systems alone will come with a steep price tag. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) estimates that migrating government systems to quantum-safe cryptography could cost $7.1 billion over the next decade. However, even this figure is uncertain, with the GAO noting that agencies have yet to fully assess their needs and resources.\nReferring to the OMB report, the GAO analysts write: “According to the report, this figure represents an initial rough order of magnitude projection with a high level of uncertainty. OMB’s report added that agencies are required to update their cost estimates annually to allow for adjustments as they gain familiarity with their inventories of existing cryptography and costing methodologies, as well as the transition process.”\nPrivate industry faces an even larger challenge. Many critical infrastructure sectors operate on outdated or specialized equipment that was never designed to handle advanced cryptographic methods. These legacy systems, the report explains, will be particularly difficult and costly to upgrade.\nAn International Race\nThe U.S. is not alone in grappling with quantum threats. International organizations like [NATO](https://www.nato.int/docu/review/articles/2021/06/03/quantum-technologies-in-defence-security/index.html) and the [European Union](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/commission-publishes-recommendation-post-quantum-cryptography) are already pushing for quantum-safe encryption. Many have adopted a “hybrid” approach that combines existing cryptographic methods with post-quantum solutions to ensure better protection during the transition.\nMajor tech companies, including Amazon, Apple and Google, have also started incorporating hybrid cryptography into their products. The GAO notes that while these efforts are promising, they bring added complexity and cost, requiring organizations to effectively undergo two migrations: one to hybrid systems and another to fully quantum-safe cryptography.\nThe U.S. strategy, by contrast, lacks integration with these global efforts, leaving gaps that adversaries could exploit. Coordinating with international partners could strengthen protections and reduce duplication of effort, the GAO report suggests.\nWhat Needs to Happen Next\nThe GAO laid out several recommendations to address these vulnerabilities. As mentioned, one of the central recommendations is designating the ONCD as the lead agency for quantum cybersecurity efforts. The ONCD should coordinate with federal agencies, private industries, and international partners to create a unified, actionable strategy. This includes setting measurable goals, timelines, and accountability frameworks.\nThe report also calls for more robust funding plans. Agencies need clear budgets and staffing resources to complete the transition to quantum-safe cryptography. Private industries, meanwhile, could benefit from government incentives to offset the high costs of securing critical infrastructure.\nThis leadership is crucial for the U.S. to keep pace with a rapidly emerging technological area critical to national security, the analysts report.\nA Window of Opportunity\nWhile the threats posed by quantum computing are serious, the GAO emphasizes that there is still time to act. The 10-to-20-year timeline provides a window for federal agencies and private companies to prepare. But this will require decisive action now, the report concludes.\nThe report offers the following conclusion: “Federal agencies and critical infrastructure owners and operators face an urgent need to transition to PQC to address the threat to the cryptography that our nation relies on to protect sensitive information. This transition is particularly critical given the potential for adversaries to copy sensitive data today and access it once a CRQC becomes available. Federal agencies recognize the quantum computing threat and have taken some actions to partially address it. Designating leadership committed to fully implementing desirable characteristics of a national strategy is essential to ensure success. ONCD is well-positioned to fill this gap and provide a comprehensive roadmap for the transition to PQC.”\nThis article attempts to summarize the main points of the GAO analysis, but please read [the entire report for a more full analysis of the situation](https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-25-107703.pdf).",
