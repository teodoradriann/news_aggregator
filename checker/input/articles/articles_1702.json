If someone wins the jackpot, it would be the sixth largest in Powerball history.\nThe Powerball was last hit on Oct. 11 and Saturday’s drawing will be the 34th since a $1.7 billion jackpot was won on a ticket sold in California, according to officials at the Massachusetts Lottery.\nTwo $50,000 prizes were won Wednesday on Quic Pic tickets sold at Fast Freddie’s in Beverly and Wellesley Variety in Wellesley.\nTo win the full estimated Powerball prize, all five white numbers must match plus the Powerball . The Wednesday Powerball drawing , which was not hit, was an estimated $685 million.\nPowerball tickets are $2 each and can be played in 45 states, including Massachusetts, Washington, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Players can purchase tickets up until 9:50 p.m. Saturday at Massachusetts Lottery retailers.\nDrawings are held every Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday at 10:59 p.m. in Tallahassee, Florida.\nThe winning $1.7 billion ticket earlier this year was sold at Midway Market & Liquor in Frazier Park.",

    "text": "Alien: Earth is all set to become one of the hottest new TV series in the near future. It’s not hard to see why either. After all, showrunner Noah Hawley ( Fargo , Legion , Lucy in the Sky ) is both writing and directing the first Alien TV series in existence. Well, the first live-action series, that is. Alien: Isolation – The Digital Series holds the title of first series period due to it being an animated web series, but that’s a story for another day. This is the first live-action series in the Alien franchise, and that carries quite a bit of hype to go with it.\nThus, it’s not hard to see why FX would want to promote Alien: Earth any way they can. Trailers would be the next logical step, and that’s exactly what you see here. However, the brand new trailer on YouTube isn’t just to promote the TV series. No, it’s also promoting a full-on immersive experience involving an entire crashed spaceship as a massive set they can explore. Complete with exclusive Alien merch and photo ops, and all set in the heart of Austin, Texas from March 7-8, 2025 . You can find the exact dates and times below:\n318 E 5th St. Lot, Austin, TX 78701 (between Copper Tank and The Westin) Dates & Hours of Operation : Friday, March 7: 2:30 – 10:00pm Saturday, March 8: 2:30 – 10:00pm Alien: Earth Lands in Austin, Texas as Explorable Shipwreck Hopefully without the devatation and fire. Honestly, this whole thing just sounds like one big Alien festival combined with an escape room. And to be fair, FX does market it as such. It all sounds like a fun way to promote the upcoming Alien: Earth , which will make its debut sometime in Summer 2025 .

    "text": "Health & Wellness Newly identified chemical in drinking water is likely present in many homes and could be toxic, study finds The substance is a byproduct of the process of treating water with chloramine, a chemical used to kill viruses and bacteria. It’s not yet known whether it is dangerous. By Evan Bush | NBC News • Published 12 mins ago • Updated 12 mins ago Getty Images About a third of U.S. residents have been receiving tap water containing a previously unidentified chemical byproduct, a new study has found. Some scientists are now concerned — and actively investigating — whether that chemical could be toxic.\nThe newly identified substance, named “chloronitramide anion,” is produced when water is treated with chloramine, a chemical formed by mixing chlorine and ammonia. Chloramine is often used to kill viruses and bacteria in municipal water treatment systems.\nFree 24/7 Connecticut news stream: Watch NBC CT wherever you are\nResearchers said the existence of the byproduct was discovered about 40 years ago, but it was only identified now because analysis techniques have improved, which finally enabled scientists to determine the chemical’s structure.\nIt could take years to figure out whether chloronitramide anion is dangerous — it’s never been studied. The researchers reported their findings Thursday in the journal Science , in part to spur research to address safety concerns.\nGet top local stories in Connecticut delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC Connecticut's News Headlines newsletter. The scientists said they have no hard evidence to suggest that the compound represents a danger, but that it bears similarities to other chemicals of concern. They think it deserves scrutiny because it’s been detected so widely.\n“It has similarity to other toxic molecules,” said David Wahman, one of the study’s authors and a research environmental engineer at the Environmental Protection Agency. “We looked for it in 40 samples in 10 U.S. chlorinated drinking water systems located in seven states. We did find it in all the samples.”\nChloronitramide anion is produced as chloramine decays over time. It’s likely to be found in all drinking water treated via this method, he said.\nU.S. & World\nWisconsin 13 mins ago A kayaker faked his own death and fled overseas. Now he's telling how he did it Crime and Courts 1 hour ago Kansas woman found buried in a freezer in Oklahoma died from 30 stab wounds, report says The fact that a byproduct with unknown risks could be so ubiquitous and evade researchers for so long renews questions about potential health effects of the chemicals used to treat tap water.\nSome 113 million U.S. residents receive chloramine-treated water from their taps, according to the study. The chemical has been used for about a century to disinfect water. Today, it’s often used to protect a system’s “residual” — the water that remains in pipes for several days after it leaves a water treatment plant.\nIncreasingly, chloramine has been favored over chlorine because the latter also produces byproducts, some of which are associated with bladder cancer and are regulated by the EPA.\nDavid Reckhow, a research professor in civil and environmental engineering at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, who was not involved with the study, said the finding was an important step. The ultimate goal, he said, is understanding whether the substance is a hazard; he concurred that it was likely toxic.\n“It’s a pretty small molecule and it can probably for that reason enter into biological systems and into cells. And it is still a reactive molecule,” he said. “Those are the kinds of things you worry about.”\nThe authors of the new study arrived at their results after figuring out how to formulate high concentrations of the chemical for laboratory testing, said Julian Fairey, lead author and an associate professor at the University of Arkansas.\n“We don’t know the toxicity but this study has enabled us to be able to do that work now,” said Fairey, who studies drinking water byproducts. “Now, we can go about the hard work of trying to figure out what its toxicological relevance is in our water systems.”\nHe added that some past studies have suggested a link between drin king disinfected water and increased rates of certain cancers .\n“We don’t know what’s driving these. We have no idea if this compound is in any way related to those outcomes,” Fairey said. “But we have unexplained incidents of certain types of cancer from treated drinking water.”\nHowever, any conclusions about whether the newly identified substance is toxic are likely many years away. Potential regulation based on those eventual findings would take even longer.\n“It’s a lot — probably a decade of research once a funding source is found,” said Alan Roberson, executive director of the Association of State Drinking Water Administrators.\nReckhow said that in the meantime, water utilities should pay close attention to ongoing research and try to reduce people’s exposure.\n“You do what you can to minimize,” he said. “You make the best judgment you can on the toxicity and you run with incomplete information. That’s the world we live in, unfortunately.”\nThe EPA only regulates a handful of disinfectant byproducts, including several associated with the use of chlorine. Scientists said those regulations have pushed some water providers to increase the use of chloramine.\n“This study really calls into question whether or not this disinfection process is safer from a health perspective,” said David Andrews, a senior scientist at the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy organization that pushes for more scrutiny of chemicals.\nHe added that there are hundreds of disinfection byproducts found in water systems but that this one deserves scrutiny.\n“Many of those other contaminants are occurring at lower concentrations or less frequently,” Andrews said.\nAny treatment of drinking water involves some level of health risk, Roberson said. It’s a trade-off: Disinfection processes have largely vanquished waterborne diseases such as cholera and typhoid, but research suggests that some byproducts are associated with risks of cancer and miscarriage.\n“The reason you’re adding the chloramine — you want to kill the bacteria and viruses, you have a real risk-risk trade-off,” he said.\nMany U.S. water utilities disclose on their websites whether they treat the water they supply with chlorine or chloramine. Wahman said some research suggests that active carbon filters, such as those used in home water purification devices or refrigerator filters, can remove disinfectant byproducts but that more research is needed.\nThis story first appeared on NBCNews.com.

    "text": "Will Raccoons Eat My Pond Fish? A Pond Owner’s Guide to Predator Prevention Yes, absolutely, raccoons will eat your pond fish . These masked bandits are opportunistic omnivores with a knack for finding an easy meal, and your backyard pond, unfortunately, can be a prime target. Raccoons are particularly active at night, which often explains the mysterious overnight disappearance of your prized fish. They aren’t picky eaters either; whether you have goldfish, koi, or other types of pond fish, they’re all potentially on the menu. Let’s delve into the world of raccoons and your pond, exploring how to protect your aquatic pets from these hungry predators.\nUnderstanding the Raccoon Threat Why Are Raccoons Attracted to Ponds? Raccoons are drawn to ponds for several reasons:\nEasy Food Source: Ponds offer a relatively effortless food source. Catching fish, frogs, and other aquatic life requires minimal effort for these adaptable creatures. Water Source: Ponds provide a reliable source of fresh water, which is essential for raccoons, especially during dry periods. Omnivorous Diet: Raccoons are omnivores and eat nearly anything. Their diet includes fish, amphibians, insects, fruits, nuts, and even garbage. This diverse appetite makes your pond a tempting buffet. Identifying a Raccoon Predation Problem How do you know if raccoons are the culprits behind your disappearing fish? Look for these telltale signs:\nMissing Fish: This is the most obvious indicator. A sudden decrease in your fish population, especially overnight, should raise a red flag. Disturbed Pond Environment: Raccoons are messy eaters. Look for overturned rocks, scattered plants, or muddy edges around your pond. Raccoon Tracks: Raccoon footprints are distinctive, resembling small human hands. You may find them in the mud near your pond. Raccoon Droppings: Raccoon scat is tubular, dark, and may contain undigested food like seeds or berries. Sightings: Of course, directly spotting a raccoon near your pond is the most definitive evidence. Effective Strategies for Raccoon Deterrence Now that you know the threat, let’s explore practical strategies for keeping these predators away from your pond:\n1. Remove Nearby Food Sources Raccoons are drawn to areas with easy access to food. Eliminate potential attractants around your yard:\nSecure Garbage Cans: Use tight-fitting lids and consider bungee cords or weights to prevent raccoons from accessing your trash. Clean Up Pet Food: Don’t leave pet food outside, as this is a major attractant for raccoons and other wildlife. Pick Up Fallen Fruit: If you have fruit trees, promptly collect any fallen fruit to prevent raccoons from being drawn to your yard. 2. Make Access Tough Raccoons are agile climbers, but you can make it more difficult for them to access your pond:\nTrim Overhanging Branches: Cut back any tree branches that overhang your pond, as these provide easy access points. Remove Climbing Aids: Eliminate any potential climbing structures near your pond, such as fences, trellises, or stacked rocks. Install a Fence: A sturdy fence around your pond can be an effective barrier. Make sure it’s tall enough (at least 3-4 feet) and buried a few inches to prevent raccoons from digging underneath. 3. Provide Hiding Places for Fish Giving your fish places to hide will make it more difficult for raccoons to catch them:\nAquatic Plants: Add plenty of aquatic plants like water lilies, reeds, and submerged vegetation. These provide natural cover for your fish. Rock Piles: Create underwater rock piles or caves where fish can retreat when threatened. Artificial Shelters: Consider adding artificial shelters like PVC pipes or overturned plant pots to provide additional hiding spots. 4. Sensory Deterrents Raccoons have sensitive senses, and you can use this to your advantage:\nMotion-Activated Sprinklers: These devices detect movement and spray a burst of water, startling raccoons and deterring them from approaching your pond. Raccoon Deterrent Lights: These lights emit a flashing strobe that is unpleasant to raccoons, discouraging them from entering your yard. Scent Repellents: Certain scents can repel raccoons. Try using commercial raccoon repellents or homemade concoctions like a mixture of cayenne pepper and water. 5. Physical Barriers: Netting Netting is a simple yet highly effective way to keep raccoons out of your pond:\nPond Netting: Cover your pond with a fine mesh netting, securing it around the edges with rocks or stakes. This prevents raccoons from accessing the water and catching fish. Temporary Netting: If you don’t want to keep netting on your pond year-round, consider using it only during the night, when raccoons are most active. Long-Term Pond Management for Raccoon Prevention Beyond immediate deterrents, long-term pond management can also help reduce the risk of raccoon predation:\nMaintain a Healthy Fish Population: A thriving fish population is more resilient to predation. Ensure your fish are well-fed and have adequate space to grow. Regular Pond Cleaning: Keep your pond clean and free of debris to prevent it from becoming an attractive feeding ground for raccoons. Monitor Your Pond Regularly: Keep a close eye on your pond and fish population. Early detection of a predation problem is crucial for implementing effective solutions. Consider Pond Depth: Deeper ponds offer more refuge for fish. A pond with varying depths allows fish to escape to deeper water when threatened. Raccoons are a common threat to backyard ponds, but with a combination of preventative measures and vigilant monitoring, you can protect your fish and enjoy your pond without unwanted visitors. Understanding their behavior and implementing effective deterrents is the key to maintaining a healthy and thriving aquatic ecosystem. Remember to be persistent and adapt your strategies as needed to ensure the long-term safety of your pond inhabitants.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About Raccoons and Pond Fish 1. What other animals besides raccoons eat pond fish? Besides raccoons, other common pond predators include:\nHerons: These long-legged birds are skilled fishers. Egrets: Similar to herons, egrets are also adept at catching fish. Cats: Domestic and feral cats may prey on pond fish. Opossums: These nocturnal marsupials are opportunistic feeders. Snakes: Some snakes, like water snakes, will eat fish. Foxes: Foxes may occasionally hunt for fish in ponds. Otters: These aquatic mammals are excellent swimmers and fishers. Kingfishers: These birds dive into water to catch fish. Bullfrogs: Large bullfrogs can eat small fish. 2. Are koi more vulnerable to raccoon predation than goldfish? Koi are often more vulnerable due to their size and value. Raccoons are attracted to the larger size of koi, as they provide a more substantial meal. Goldfish, being smaller, may be less of a target.\n3. Will a dog deter raccoons from my pond? A dog can deter raccoons, especially if it barks and chases them away. However, some raccoons may become accustomed to the dog’s presence and continue to visit the pond when the dog is not around or is sleeping.\n4. Do raccoons eat tadpoles or frogs? Yes, raccoons will eat tadpoles and frogs. These amphibians are part of their natural diet, especially when they are readily available in ponds and wetlands.\n5. How can I tell if a heron is eating my fish instead of a raccoon? Herons typically leave behind different signs than raccoons. Look for:\nMissing fish with clean wounds: Herons use their sharp beaks to spear fish, leaving clean punctures. Feathers near the pond: Herons may leave behind feathers during their hunting attempts. Heron sightings: Spotting a heron near your pond is a strong indication of their presence. 6. Is it safe to relocate raccoons if they are bothering my pond? Relocating raccoons is generally not recommended and may even be illegal in some areas. Relocated raccoons often struggle to survive in new environments and can also spread diseases. It’s better to focus on deterrents to discourage them from visiting your pond. If you are having a major problem, consult a local wildlife professional.\n7. Will motion-activated sprinklers harm my fish? Motion-activated sprinklers are generally safe for fish, as the water spray is usually brief and not harmful. Position the sprinklers so that the spray is directed away from the pond surface to minimize disturbance to the fish.\n8. What are some natural raccoon repellents I can use around my pond? Some natural raccoon repellents include:\nCayenne pepper: Sprinkle cayenne pepper around the perimeter of your pond. Vinegar: Raccoons dislike the smell of vinegar. Soak rags in vinegar and place them near the pond. Garlic: Crushed garlic cloves can deter raccoons with their strong odor. Peppermint oil: Soak cotton balls in peppermint oil and place them around the pond. 9. Can raccoons contaminate my pond water? Yes, raccoons can contaminate pond water with their feces, which may contain harmful parasites like Baylisascaris procyonis (raccoon roundworm). It’s important to avoid direct contact with raccoon feces and to clean up any droppings promptly. The parasite is spread by swallowing Baylisascaris eggs, which are found in the feces of raccoons that are infected with Baylisascaris . People can be exposed to Baylisascaris eggs in soil, water, or on objects that have been contaminated with feces from an infected raccoon.\n10. Are there any plants that deter raccoons? Some plants are believed to deter raccoons due to their strong scents or prickly textures. These include:\nMint: Raccoons dislike the strong smell of mint. Marigolds: These flowers have a pungent odor that raccoons find unpleasant. Prickly shrubs: Thorny bushes can create a physical barrier that raccoons avoid. 11. How often should I clean my pond to prevent attracting raccoons? Regular pond cleaning is essential for maintaining a healthy ecosystem and discouraging raccoons. Clean your pond at least twice a year, in the spring and fall, to remove debris, decaying leaves, and excess algae.\n12. Will feeding raccoons keep them away from my fish? Never feed raccoons . While it might seem like a solution, feeding them will only encourage them to return to your property and become more reliant on human food sources. This can worsen the problem and make them bolder in their attempts to access your pond.\n13. Are raccoon deterrent lights effective? Raccoon deterrent lights can be effective as part of a comprehensive strategy. These lights emit flashing strobe lights that disorient and annoy raccoons, discouraging them from entering the area.\n14. What should I do if I find a sick or injured raccoon near my pond? If you find a sick or injured raccoon, do not approach it. Contact your local animal control or wildlife rehabilitation center for assistance. They are trained to handle wild animals safely and can provide appropriate care.\n15. Where can I learn more about raccoon behavior and pond ecosystem management? You can find valuable information about raccoon behavior and pond ecosystem management from various sources, including:\nLocal wildlife agencies: State and local wildlife agencies offer resources on raccoon management and wildlife conservation. The Environmental Literacy Council: This organization provides information on environmental science and ecological concepts. Visit enviroliteracy.org to learn more. Pond supply stores: Many pond supply stores offer advice on pond maintenance and predator control. University extension services: University extension services often have experts who can provide guidance on managing wildlife and ecosystems.",
