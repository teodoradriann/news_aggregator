    "title": "Arizona Military Museum CLOSES after Vietnam vet founder, 80, told tour: 'Eventually they will replace me with some gay, black, woman woke Jew' and claimed mannequin with hand on its hip represented gay soldiers | Daily Mail Online",
    "text": "A Vietnam War veteran has been ousted from the military museum he curated for decades after suggesting he would be replaced by 'some gay, black, woman, woke Jew.' Joe Abodeely, 80, spent half his life overseeing the Arizona Military Museum which was a personal passion for the Army veteran who served in the Vietnam War - his own uniform was even on display. But for more than four months, the museum has been closed to the public, and the nonprofit overseeing it no longer has state support. Arizona National Guard Brigadier General John Conley sent Abodeely a letter in February expressing concern about statements the senior made during a tour. 'Eventually they will replace me with some gay, Black, woman, woke Jew who will ruin the place,' Abodeely said, according to the letter obtained by the Arizona Republic. Joe Abodeely, 80, oversaw the Arizona Military Museum for 40 years - but was forced to step away due to 'unprofessional language'. He is pictured next to a mannequin of a soldier with its hand on its hip that he suggested was gay The museum was shuttered after the state severed ties with the nonprofit overseeing it and ordered them to vacate the building Abodeely, a Vietnam War veteran, had personal ties to the museum, even displaying his own uniform He was alleged to have called 'all Americans' stupid and 'told the members of the tour group that they knew nothing of the realities of the Vietnam era because they were too young, brainwashed, stupid, duped, uneducated, or uncaring.' The 86-year-old museum is run by the Arizona National Guard Historical Society, a nonprofit that Abodeely led for decades, and sits on military property. Following the incident, the state's Department of Emergency and Military Affairs ordered Abodeely to attend two hours of diversity, equity and inclusion training. He obliged. Major General Kerry Muehlenbeck, the adjutant general of the guard in Arizona, also wanted to meet with him. But the offensive language didn't stop there, despite Abodeely attaining a certificate of completion for the course. In an interview, he remarked that a museum mannequin with a 'hand on its hip' represented gay soldiers. A day later, Abodeely issued an apology, attributing his erratic behavior to the combined stress of undergoing tests for cancer and the museum fiasco. 'I'm arrogant, and I know that,' the 80-year-old said. 'I am somewhat egotistical, but I care about other people. I care about other things. I care about my nation, my state and I care about the museum.' Abodeely's remarks during the tour are at odds with posts on the museum's Facebook page where he condemned racists and spoke out about division in the country. Abodeely was reprimanded for telling a tour: 'Eventually they will replace me with some gay, Black, woman, woke Jew who will ruin the place' He allegedly told the group that they were 'too young, brainwashed, stupid, duped, uneducated, or uncaring' to understand the 'realities of the Vietnam era' The 86-year-old museum was formerly run by the Arizona National Guard Historical Society, a nonprofit that Abodeely led for decades 'It is not about economics, or politics, or ideology, or the haves vs. the have nots - it is clearly about RACE,' he wrote of the motivations behind the January 6 siege of the Capitol. 'Those people are simply ignorant, despicable racists; and their actions have brought the race issue to the forefront. It took a racist President and supporters to do it.' In an interview, he claimed he was being pushed out due to a personal vendetta held by Muehlenbeck, a claim that her spokesperson denied. Mike Snozek, a U.S. Army and National Guard veteran, was on the board of the Arizona National Guard Historical Society for more than a dozen years before the turmoil. He said Abodeely misrepresented Muehlenbeck's views about the museum to the board and the public. Snozek said he was acting at the request of the majority of board members when he called a meeting last summer and they voted him in as the new leader to replace Abodeely. Abodeely, in turn, held that the vote was illegitimate and named his own new board. The guard forbade him from interacting with guests at the museum, but spokesperson Captain Erin Hannigan said he continued to use 'unprofessional language.' 'In turn, the Adjutant General lost confidence in Mr. Abodeely's ability to interact professionally, and respectfully with members of the public,' she said. The army veteran was ousted from his leading role at the Arizona National Guard Historical Society (pictured: Abodeely, third from left, and his platoon) When he refused to step down alongside the newly-appointed leader, the state announced that it would find a new group to oversee the museum and reopen it The nonprofit must provide a written plan for the removal of its property from the museum by December 18 While Snozek expressed understanding for why Abodeely wouldn't want to part with the museum, he added: 'There's a way to conduct oneself and a way not to conduct oneself, and we have rules, and we follow them. 'And there's what's socially acceptable and there's what's absolutely not socially acceptable.' In an effort to preserve the museum in its current location, Snozek volunteered to step down if Abodeely would, too. But the Vietnam vet, who served as a deputy county attorney and a criminal defense lawyer later in his life, refused. Muehlenbeck ultimately announced her decision to sever state ties with the group on November 17. Now, the nonprofit must provide her with a written plan for the removal of its property from the museum by December 18, according to a spokesperson. The spokesperson added that the Arizona National Guard plans to find a new group to run the museum and reopen it.",

    "text": "Canicule : neuf départements toujours en vigilance orange La vigilance orange pour canicule déclenchée dimanche dans le sud-est de la France concernera toujours neuf départements ce vendredi 2 août, dont les Bouches-du-Rhône qui accueillent les épreuves olympiques de voile à Marseille, selon Météo-France. Twitter - VigiMétéoFrance on Twitter / X Trois départements d’Ile-de-France et de l’Est restent par ailleurs placés en vigilance orange pour les risques de crues (Seine-et-Marne, Meurthe-et-Moselle et Vosges). Le Vaucluse, les Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, l’Hérault, le Gard, le Var, les Alpes-Maritimes, les deux départements de Corse et les Bouches-du-Rhône sont maintenus en vigilance orange pour des températures élevées et « nettement au-dessus des normales », a indiqué l’institut météorologique. La vigilance orange a cependant été levée pour le Rhône, l’Isère, la Drôme et l’Ardèche. Des sites splendides… mais inadaptés en cas de canicule : le pari risqué des organisateurs des JO 2024 Les minimales de vendredi matin seront encore très élevées près de la Méditerranée, comprises entre 22 °C et 26 °C, localement 27 °C, et resteront élevées en journée, avec 35 °C à 39 °C. Une vague d’air chaud venue d’Espagne L’alerte déclenchée dimanche s’est ensuite étendue à une large moitié sud du pays, avec 39 départements concernés lundi et 45 mardi par cette vague d’air chaud venue d’Espagne qui a même touché la région parisienne et certains sites olympiques. Météo-France évoque un « épisode caniculaire de relativement courte durée mais particulièrement intense ». Pour faire face à cet épisode, il est notamment conseillé de boire de l’eau plusieurs fois par jour, d’éviter de sortir aux heures les plus chaudes de la journée, de limiter les activités sportives et physiques. A Marseille, les piscines municipales sont gratuites, tandis qu’à Nice les agents municipaux mènent des tournées téléphoniques pour s’assurer du bien-être des personnes âgées ou isolées. Météo-France, comment travaille la vigie du climat «Â Les vagues de chaleur sont une manifestation emblÃ©matique de notre changement climatique, elles sont de plus en plus intenses, frÃ©quentes, prÃ©coces et longuesÂ Â», souligne le climatologue Matthieu Sorel. En France, on observait avant 1989 « en moyenne une vague de chaleur tous les cinq ans », alors que « depuis 2000 elles se produisent à une fréquence annuelle ». Ces vagues de chaleur, prévient le spécialiste, « seront deux fois plus nombreuses d’ici trente ans ».",

    "text": "A HaloPSA, plataforma de gestão e automação de serviços para prestadores de TI, acaba de chegar ao Brasil por meio de uma parceria estratégica com a Addee. Reconhecida pelo Guia de Mercado Gartner 2025, a HaloPSA é utilizada por players de ponta, incluindo a equipe McLaren de Fórmula 1, para otimizar operações e potencializar a eficiência dos serviços de TI. Com essa aliança, a Addee amplia seu portfólio e reforça seu compromisso em oferecer tecnologia de ponta para o mercado brasileiro.\nA solução, que será oferecida com exclusividade no país pela Addee, chega para apoiar o amadurecimento das empresas brasileiras dedicadas à prestação de serviços gerenciados de TI (MSPs). De acordo com o estudo Panorama da Comunidade MSP, da própria Addee, em 2019, a maioria das organizações deste setor não possuía mais do que cinco funcionários, sendo que 19% delas eram operadas por uma única pessoa. Cinco anos depois, em 2024, o panorama se inverteu completamente. O segmento chegou ao final do ano passado com apenas 10% dessas organizações tendo apenas o fundador como o único responsável por todas as tarefas. Enquanto isso, 52% já emprega até 9 pessoas e 30% possuem entre 10 e 49 funcionários.\nO CEO e fundador da Addee, Rodrigo Gazola cita um estudo feito pela consultoria de gestão MarketsandMarkets, que estima um crescimento de 6,9% ao ano na movimentação financeira deste setor até 2029. Segundo o estudo, os MSPs ao redor do mundo passarão de um volume de transações calculado em US$ 365,33 bilhões em 2024 para US$ 511,03 bilhões cinco anos depois.\nGazola explica que o contexto econômico brasileiro, marcado pela volatilidade cambial e pela busca constante por redução de custos operacionais, torna o HaloPSA uma solução especialmente atrativa para os prestadores de serviço de TI.\nAlém disso, o executivo argumenta que o ambiente corporativo tem exigido cada vez mais agilidade e eficiência das áreas de TI, pois as empresas não podem se dar ao luxo de ter interrupções e precisam de parceiros que garantam continuidade operacional. \"Neste cenário, o HaloPSA responde à necessidade dos MSPs de aumentar a produtividade e automatizar processos, reduzindo o tempo gasto com tarefas manuais e possibilitando que as equipes técnicas se concentrem em atividades estratégicas e consultivas. A ferramenta se encaixa em um movimento crescente de digitalização e busca por eficiência, o que favorece sua adoção no mercado brasileiro\", diz.\nA Addee também é distribuidora exclusiva no Brasil da americana N-able, fornecedora de soluções de software baseadas em nuvem para provedores de serviços gerenciados, que em 2022 concluiu um processo de Spin-off junto à SolarWinds Corporation justamente para se dedicar ao mercado de MSPs.\nPara o Channel Partnerships Manager da HaloPSA, Luke Turton, a parceria com a Addee representa uma oportunidade de acelerar o planejamento estratégico da companhia de expansão da tecnologia pela América Latina.",

That something has given us the ability to experience many things it would be a gross oversight in logical thinking to believe it all just becomes nothing in moment of death and that this designed world is pointless if consciousness doesn't exist after death.\nAnyone with a iota of logic can deduce there must be something after death. Maybe not hell and heaven, maybe hell and heaven maybe something else entirely but a designed universe that give us these experiences is more then likely going to have a life of some type after death.\nAnonymous Coward (\nOP\n)\nUser ID: 77388516\nUnited States\n01/06/2024 03:58 PM\nReport Abusive Post\nReport Copyright Violation\nRe: The Vast Majority Of You Are Going To Hell\nAlways with the eternal torture.\nIf you're not on the GLORY Train you're on the Highway To HELL where you will be welcomed and maybe they will appreciate your foulmouthed evil intent.....\nQuoting:\nSaintVron\nGOD makes nobody or forces none of His children to love Him.

    "text": "Tecnología y sociedad\n2025: ¿el año en el que la desinformación en las plataformas tendrá vía libre?\nEn las redes sociales la moderación de contenidos falsos o francamente tóxicos está en declive desde hace años\nPascal Lapointe/Science-Presse/T21\nAl anunciar esta semana que Facebook ponía fin, por el momento en Estados Unidos, a la financiación de organizaciones dedicadas a la verificación de datos, Mark Zuckerberg destacó [su deseo de no disgustar al nuevo presidente Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jan/08/mark-zuckerberg-supporting-trump-maga). Pero también señaló que en las redes sociales la moderación de contenidos falsos o francamente tóxicos está en declive desde hace años.\nAsí, en Twitter, desde su adquisición por parte de Elon Musk en 2022, múltiples investigaciones han [demostrado](https://healthfeedback.org/misinformation-superspreaders-thriving-on-musk-owned-twitter/) un [crecimiento acelerado](https://www.euronews.com/green/20221117/how-climate-disinformation-is-spreading-after-elon-musks-twitter-takeover) de los insultos y [amenazas](https://www.francetvinfo.fr/monde/environnement/crise-climatique/rechauffement-climatique-sur-les-reseaux-sociaux-les-scientifiques-victimes-du-deferlement-de-haine-des-climatosceptiques_5996132.html) dirigidos contra científicos, médicos [o climatólogos](https://www.sciencepresse.qc.ca/actualite/detecteur-rumeurs/20231127/reseaux-sociaux-favorisent-discours-climatosceptique-vrai), entre otros. Además de mensajes racistas y comentarios de odio que se han [viralizado con mayor facilidad](https://www.sciencepresse.qc.ca/actualite/20231020/crochet-bleu-outil-verification-depasse).\nLos medios de comunicación especializados en fact-checking, a los que Mark Zuckerberg en su mensaje [acusó](https://www.reuters.com/technology/meta-ends-third-party-fact-checking-program-adopts-x-like-community-notes-model-2025-01-07/) de censura,[ reaccionaron rápidamente](https://www.reuters.com/technology/meta-ends-third-party-fact-checking-program-adopts-x-like-community-notes-model-2025-01-07/) para [recordarnos](https://www.cnn.com/20250108/media/fact-checkers-meta-zuckerberg-facebook-bias/index.html) que [nunca han tenido el poder](https://leadstories.com/analysis/2025/01/end-of-meta-partnership.html) de hacer desaparecer nada en Facebook: Facebook tiene pleno poder sobre las etiquetas que se pueden colocar en los mensajes (“falso” o “engañoso”), así como sobre los impactos de estas etiquetas (reducción del alcance o “desmonetización”).\nA lo largo de los años, informa el medio estadounidense Lead Stories, \"a menudo hemos recomendado a Meta cambios en el tamaño o en la redacción de las etiquetas\", pero sin éxito. A esto se suma el hecho de que los recursos limitados de las organizaciones de verificación de datos sólo les permiten verificar una pequeña porción de información cuestionable, [señala el presidente del Instituto Poynter](https://www.nytimes.com/20250107/business/mark-zuckerberg-meta-fact-check.html), que dirige el medio de noticias PolitiFact .\nCon este anuncio, “la batalla por la moderación de contenidos finalmente se ha perdido”, [escribió](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2462974-are-tech-firms-giving-up-on-policing-their-platforms/) el columnista de tecnología de la revista científica New Scientist el 7 de enero. Esta es también la [reacción del News Literacy Project](https://newslit.org/newsroom/press-release/response-to-metas-decision-to-end-fact-checking/), una organización estadounidense dedicada a la educación informacional: \"este gesto demuestra que Meta ha abandonado en gran medida los esfuerzos de moderación que recuerdan a la gente cuáles son los hechos y animan a la gente a buscar fuentes de información creíbles y basadas en estándares\". Sin embargo, los usuarios de Facebook \"son vulnerables a la manipulación por parte de actores maliciosos que promueven fuentes no confiables e información fabricada específicamente para explotar nuestros sesgos cognitivos, incluido nuestro deseo de confirmar nuestras ideas y creencias preconcebidas\".\nLos orígenes de una asociación con Facebook\nEsta “batalla” por la moderación de contenidos en las plataformas comenzó en parte a finales de 2016 con el shock que representó la elección de Donald Trump. Por primera vez, las plataformas se vieron obligadas a admitir que la proliferación de desinformación no era algo marginal, como habían afirmado anteriormente.[ En este contexto, Facebook creó en diciembre de 2016](https://www.cjr.org/tow_center_reports/partnership-press-facebook-news-outlets-team-fight-misinformation.php) un programa de verificación de datos confiado a “terceros”, es decir, [medios de comunicación acreditados por una organización independiente](https://www.sciencepresse.qc.ca/actualite/detecteur-rumeurs/20180625/lutte-aux-fausses-nouvelles-responsabilite-verificateurs), la Red Internacional de Verificación de Datos (IFCN), encargada de garantizar que firman un [Código de Principios](https://www.ifcncodeofprinciples.poynter.org/signatories): este es un compromiso de producir contenido “no partidista”.\nAmpliado en 2017 a otros países, el programa permitió el surgimiento de varios pequeños medios de comunicación que, como resultado, pasaron a depender de la financiación de la multinacional estadounidense: un medio recibe dinero en proporción a las verificaciones que puede realizar.\nCuando llegó la pandemia en 2020, la magnitud de la amenaza hizo creer que las plataformas habían tomado nota de [la peligrosa influencia](https://www.sciencepresse.qc.ca/opinions/plapointe/20201228/2020-annee-desinformation-epidemique-1-comment-combattre) que podían tener sobre la salud pública: por [primera vez](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01266-z), habían reaccionado de común acuerdo. Por ejemplo, cualquier búsqueda en Google que contenía palabras clave como “COVID” o “vacunas” iba rápidamente acompañada de enlaces a la Organización Mundial de la Salud o al Ministerio de Salud del país. Facebook y Twitter también habían destacado estos vínculos. YouTube había añadido carteles que conducían a fuentes creíbles y, sobre todo, apolíticas.\nSin embargo, rápidamente nos dimos cuenta de que el hecho de que el contenido fuera etiquetado como “falso” [no significaba que desapareciera del espacio público](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/types-sources-and-claims-covid-19-misinformation). Ya en el verano de 2020, un [estudio de la Universidad McGill](https://misinforeview.hks.harvard.edu/article/the-causes-and-consequences-of-covid-19-misperceptions-understanding-the-role-of-news-and-social-media/) concluyó que el nivel de exposición a las redes sociales parecía fomentar falsas creencias sobre el COVID y reducir el cumplimiento de las medidas sanitarias. Parecía faltar voluntad para actuar: los informes señalaban a menudo que podrían pasar meses antes de que se cerraran las cuentas denunciadas por incitación al odio.\nProblema aún más grave\nEn 2021 [supimos](https://www.sciencepresse.qc.ca/actualite/20210826/fausse-nouvelle-covid-gros-succes-pour-facebook) que las noticias sobre COVID más populares en Facebook durante el primer trimestre habían sido noticias falsas. Finalmente, en el otoño de 2021, [los “Documentos de Facebook](https://www.nytimes.com/20211024/business/media/facebook-leak-frances-haugen.html)” (decenas de miles de páginas distribuidas a los medios por una ex empleada, Frances Haugen) [revelaron](https://apnews.com/article/the-facebook-papers-covid-vaccine-misinformation-c8bbc569be7cc2ca583dadb4236a0613) que los ejecutivos de Facebook sabían [mucho más de lo que habían admitido públicamente](https://www.nytimes.com/20211023/technology/facebook-india-misinformation.html) sobre los impactos dañinos de los algoritmos, desde su influencia en las masacres en Myanmar hasta ayudar al surgimiento de QAnon y grupos antivacunas.\nSegún [una encuesta realizada en 54 países en 2023](https://www.ipie.info/research/sr2023-3) entre 300 académicos especializados en desinformación, dos tercios consideraron que “la incapacidad de responsabilizar a las empresas de redes sociales” por su inacción contra la desinformación y el discurso de odio, tarde o temprano plantearía un problema aún más grave. Una de las preocupaciones era que los políticos de países democráticos comenzaran a “tomar prestadas” estrategias de comunicación de aquellos en regímenes autoritarios, considerando el éxito que les reportaban los algoritmos.\nEn su anuncio del 7 de enero, Mark Zuckerberg afirmó que el programa de terceros sería reemplazado por un programa de “notas comunitarias” (notas escritas por los propios usuarios) como el que existe en Twitter desde 2021.\nSin embargo, su eficacia aún está por demostrar: según [un estudio](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3686967) publicado el pasado noviembre, la llegada de estas notas a Twitter (ahora X) no redujo el “compromiso” con la desinformación. Los investigadores califican el sistema de demasiado lento: un número indeterminado de participantes debe haber aprobado una nota para que se muestre en un mensaje, lo que puede tardar días, mientras que los lectores de este mensaje han pasado a otra cosa durante mucho tiempo. Además, para saber que un mensaje es verdadero o falso hay que investigar durante unas horas o unos días, algo que los periodistas remunerados pueden permitirse, pero no los ciudadanos voluntarios. En [un artículo](https://science.feedback.org/despite-community-notes-most-content-reviewed-eu-fact-checkers-goes-unaddressed-x-twitter/) publicado en diciembre, el sitio de verificación de datos Science Feedback escribió que el 69% de las 900 publicaciones sobre X que habían sido identificadas como falsas o engañosas no tenían calificación por parte de la comunidad.\n¿Un debate sobre la moderación a seguir en Europa?\nEn 2025, el debate sobre la moderación[ tal vez se traslade](https://www.politico.eu/article/mark-zuckerberg-full-elon-musk-dump-facebook-fact-checker/) a Europa. [Un aspecto](https://www.touteleurope.eu/economie-et-social/l-action-de-l-union-europeenne-contre-la-desinformation-en-3-minutes/) de la ley europea sobre tecnología digital adoptada en 2023 ( Ley de Servicios Digitales ) es que exige que las grandes plataformas sean [más transparentes](https://transparency.meta.com/sr/dsa-transparency-report-sep2024-facebook) sobre sus sistemas de recomendación de contenidos, es decir, sus algoritmos. En particular, la ley exige que las plataformas establezcan un sistema para denunciar contenidos problemáticos. Es en este contexto que la Comisión Europea [anunció en diciembre de 2023](https://www.ledevoir.com/monde/europe/804007/ue-declenche-enquete-formelle-desinformation-contre-x?) una [investigación sobre X](https://www.ledevoir.com/monde/europe/819219/suspendu-bresil-x-est-aussi-sellette-europe?) , por presuntas violaciones de las normas europeas sobre moderación de contenidos y transparencia.\n...\n[RRSS WhatsApp](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=2025%3A%20%C2%BFel%20a%C3%B1o%20en%20el%20que%20la%20desinformaci%C3%B3n%20en%20las%20plataformas%20tendr%C3%A1%20v%C3%ADa%20libre%3F%20https://www.epe.es/es/tendencias21/20250110/2025-ano-desinformacion-plataformas-tendra-113231387%3Futm_source%3Dwhatsapp%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dbtn-share)\n[RRSS Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.epe.es/es/tendencias21/20250110/2025-ano-desinformacion-plataformas-tendra-113231387%3Futm_source%3Dfacebook%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dbtn-share)\n[RRSS Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?original_referer=https://www.epe.es/es/tendencias21/20250110/2025-ano-desinformacion-plataformas-tendra-113231387&text=2025%3A%20%C2%BFel%20a%C3%B1o%20en%20el%20que%20la%20desinformaci%C3%B3n%20en%20las%20plataformas%20tendr%C3%A1%20v%C3%ADa%20libre%3F%20%20https://www.epe.es/es/tendencias21/20250110/2025-ano-desinformacion-plataformas-tendra-113231387%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dbtn-share%20a%20trav%C3%A9s%20de%20%40elperiodico_Esp)\n[RRSS email](mailto:?subject=2025%3A%20%C2%BFel%20a%C3%B1o%20en%20el%20que%20la%20desinformaci%C3%B3n%20en%20las%20plataformas%20tendr%C3%A1%20v%C3%ADa%20libre%3F%20&body=https://www.epe.es/es/tendencias21/20250110/2025-ano-desinformacion-plataformas-tendra-113231387%3Futm_source%3Dmail%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dbtn-share)\n[Copiar URL](javascript: void(0))\nNoticia guardada en tu perfil",

    "text": "Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh in an interview with PTI said that India would never give up on Pakistan-Occupied-Kashmir (PoK) but won't capture it with coercion. Singh claimed that PoK's citizens will themselves join India after seeing the development of Kashmir.\\\"I think India will not have to do anything. The way the ground situation has changed in Jammu and Kashmir, the way the region is witnessing economic progress, and the way peace has returned there, I think demands will emerge from people of PoK that they should merge with India,\\\" he said.'Don't read too much into it…': Rajnath Singh on PM's 'mangalsutra' remark\\\"We will not have to use force to take PoK as people would say that we must be merged with India. Such demands are now coming,\\\" he said. The defence minister asserted that \\\"PoK was, is, and will remain ours\\\".The Defence Minister reiterated the improved situation in Kashmir since the abrogation of Article 370. Rajnath Singh added that soon AFSPA (Armed Forces Special Powers Act) will also not be required in the Union Territory.\\\"The way the situation is improving in Jammu and Kashmir, I think a time will come when AFSPA will no longer be required there. It is my view and it is for the Home Ministry to decide on it,\\\" he said.‘Avoid escalation’: US responds to PM Modi's remarks on killing terroristsThe defence minister, referring to Pakistan's proxy war in Jammu and Kashmir, said Islamabad must stop cross-border terrorism. \\\"They are trying to destabilise India and we will not allow it to happen,\\\" he said.On eastern Ladakh border row, Singh said, “Talks with China going on; country's borders will remain safe”. “India has been developing infrastructure along border areas at a rapid speed,” he added.Rajnath Singh on Misa Bharti's threat to PM: 'Kisne maa ka dudh piya hai ki...'Further attacking the Congress party, Singh said, \\\"Rahul Gandhi has no fire but Congress is playing with fire by attempting Hindu-Muslim divide\\\".The defence minister also said that he was confident that the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) will cross 400 seats and the BJP will get over 370 as these projections were made after detailed assessment of the ground situation.",
