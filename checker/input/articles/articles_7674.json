    "text": "Belén Liotti\n(CNN) –– El director de un hospital en el norte de Gaza dijo que ya no pueden hacer frente a la afluencia de personas gravemente heridas y que tuvieron que trasladarlas a otro lugar.\nEl Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, director del hospital Kamal Adwan en el norte de Gaza, le dijo a CNN este jueves que civiles gravemente heridos por un ataque aéreo israelí que tuvo lugar el miércoles contra una casa en el área de Beit Lahia no habían podido ser recibidos en el hospital. “Esos casos fueron trasladados a otro hospital por la falta de especialidades necesarias para el manejo de este tipo de lesiones”.\nBlinken afirma que Israel aceptó los términos de la retirada de Gaza en una”propuesta puente”, a pesar de dichos de Netanyahu\nMuchos hospitales de Gaza carecen de personal y equipos después de diez meses de conflicto y la dificultad de acceso a gran parte de Gaza para las organizaciones de ayuda.\nAbu Safiya dijo que había escasez de combustible en Kamal Adwan.\n“Ahora estamos trabajando a la capacidad mínima en la prestación de servicios. La cantidad de combustible que tenemos no es suficiente para más de 24 horas”.\nDijo que alrededor de una decena de niños están en diálisis o con ventiladores. “La falta de combustible significa el fin de la vida de estos niños”.\nAbu Safiya dijo que el combustible llegaba en “cantidades que apenas alcanzan para unos días”.\nDijo que otro problema era la propagación de enfermedades, ya que los programas de vacunación se retrasaron debido al conflicto.\n“Nos han llegado un gran número de enfermedades de la piel e infecciones intestinales (…) Es necesario reactivar las vacunas y tomar las muestras necesarias”.\nA principios de este mes, el Ministro de Salud del Gobierno Autónomo Palestino, el Dr. Majed Abu Ramadan, dijo que Gaza estaba “enfrentando un desastre humanitario en todos los sentidos de la palabra. La agresión ha provocado la destrucción de más del 80% de la infraestructura sanitaria y la mayoría de los hospitales están fuera de servicio”.\nRecuperan en Gaza los cadáveres de seis rehenes israelíes, según las FDI y la Agencia de Seguridad Israelí\nRamadan dijo que los hospitales operativos “están funcionando parcialmente debido a los daños directos y la pérdida de personal médico calificado como consecuencia del desplazamiento forzado que enfrenta nuestro pueblo, así como a la falta de recursos, cortes de energía, escasez de combustible, falta de agua potable, alcantarillado, inundaciones, acumulación de desechos sólidos y propagación de epidemias”.\nEl Ministerio de Salud de Gaza informó el primer caso de polio la semana pasada, que atribuyó al desbordamiento de aguas residuales y a la falta de agua potable.\nDijo que “se han completado los preparativos y arreglos para la campaña de vacunación para combatir la polio, dirigida a niños menores de 10 años, y la campaña está esperando la llegada de vacunas a Gaza”.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

    "text": "Languages: Français | Deutsch Print Email Facebook X LinkedIn WhatsApp Telegram\nUpdates This post has been updated to add a post by X's global government affairs team. Social media giant X has suspended the processing of some personal data from EU users’ public posts to train AI models, two days after the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) launched court proceedings over the practice.\nThis was the first time a leading data protection authority had decided to seek a court order to suspend a platform’s data processing activities , the DPC said about it the court proceedings .\nFollowing the court filing, X agreed to suspend the processing of personal data from EU users’ public posts collected between 7 May and 1 August to train the Grok AI model, the DPC said.\nThe Irish DPC is responsible for overseeing compliance with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for many Big Tech platforms, as many of their European headquarters are in Dublin.\nThe timeframe for which the suspension applies relates to X’s request for consent, reported Irish Examiner .\nThe data processing started on 7 May to train Grok and X gradually introduced an opt-out option for users from 16 July, the judge hearing the case said, according to the Irish Examiner .\nX’s suspension will hold until the court decided on the DPC’s request, a lawyer representing X told the Irish newspaper.\nGrok is developed by Elon Musk-founded xAI and is a search assistant for premium accounts on the social media platform.\nAsked to comment on this story, X pointed Euractiv to a 9 August post from its government affairs team which reads: “We are pleased that people using X in the EU can continue to use Grok and control how their data is used with a simple privacy setting. We will continue to work with the DPC about Grok and other AI matters as we have been doing since last year. ”\nIn a Tuesday post, the same team said that the court case unfairly singled out X.\n“ X directly communicated to users how it uses data to train AI and X’s policies have been updated since 2023 to better reflect that,” the post reads.\nDigital rights activists praised the DPC’s decision to take X to court, saying it showed the authority appeared to have turned a new page on enforcement under new leadership.\nThe Irish DPC had engaged extensively with X on the issue prior to filing the court case, the data watchdog said.\nOn Monday (5 August), consumer groups alleged that X was in breach of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the EU’s landmark data protection law, in a complaint filed with the Irish DPC .\nIn June, Meta similarly halted plans to train AI models with the personal data of EU users from public posts, following data protection complaints .\n[Edited by Daniel Eck]\nRead more with Euractiv UK competition authority launches merger inquiry into Amazon-Anthropic partnership The UK's main competition watchdog has formally opened an investigation into the merger between Amazon and AI company Anthropic, a statement released on Thursday (8 August) reads.",

Daily challenges offer new puzzles every day, keeping the game fresh and exciting.\nWorldwide leaderboards introduce a competitive element, enabling players to benchmark their scores and track their progress against others from around the globe.\nSome platforms even incorporate multiplayer options, transforming Solitaire from a solitary experience into a social one where players can compete or cooperate with friends or strangers online.\nPersonalization of Visuals and Gameplay\nDigital Solitaire offers the flexibility for players to tailor the game’s visual elements to their liking.\nThis personalization includes options to modify card styles and backdrops, as well as the ability to alter the game’s challenge level.\nSuch customization not only enriches the player’s experience but also makes the game more engaging, as it can be adapted to suit personal preferences and playing styles.\nBoard Games Embrace The Online World\nThe digital era has ushered in a new life for classic board games, transforming them from physical tabletop experiences to interactive online adventures.\nThis digital revolution has not only preserved the essence of these traditional games but has also expanded their reach and appeal.\nTransition to Online Platforms\nIconic board games like Monopoly, Scrabble, and Risk have made a seamless transition to digital platforms.\nThis shift has involved adapting the physical elements of these games into virtual formats, ensuring that the core gameplay remains true to the original.\nBy going digital, these games have become more accessible to a broader audience, breaking down barriers related to physical game sets and geographical location.\nEnhanced Features and Gameplay\nThe digital versions of these classic board games often include enhanced features that are not possible in their physical counterparts.\nFor instance, Monopoly in its digital form can offer animated interactions, various board themes, and automated bank transactions.\nScrabble enthusiasts can enjoy features like built-in dictionaries and AI opponents. Risk, known for its strategic military conquests, benefits from streamlined gameplay and improved user interfaces in its online version.\nOnline Multiplayer and Connectivity\nA key benefit of digital board games is their capability to facilitate remote play.\nThe online multiplayer feature enables players to engage with friends and family, playing together seamlessly from different locations, thus overcoming the barriers of geographical distance.\nThis feature has been particularly valuable in maintaining social connections through gaming, especially during times when in-person interactions are limited.\nCustomizable Rules and Settings\nDigital board games often provide the flexibility to modify rules and settings, allowing players to customize their gaming experience.\nThis level of customization can range from altering the game’s difficulty to implementing house rules, making the games more adaptable to different player preferences and skill levels.\nPreservation and Nostalgia\nThe digitization of board games also plays a crucial role in preserving these classics for future generations.\nIt introduces these games to younger audiences who might be more inclined towards digital gaming.\nAdditionally, it offers a sense of nostalgia for those who grew up playing these games in their traditional form.\nConclusion: Classics Reimagined For The Future\nThe digital revival of classic games signifies a shift in gaming culture.
