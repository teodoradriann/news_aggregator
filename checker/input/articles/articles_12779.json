    "text": "A cat called Gizmo. Image by Tim Sandle. While some people remain uncertain about the benefits or risks of cultured meat (what is sometimes erroneously called ‘lab grown meat’), there is an option of feeding your pet some artificially created concoction. This is through the cultivation of fish, derived from cellular sources. Such technology represents a novel advancement within the food sector .\nUMAMI Bioworks and Friends & Family Pet Food Co. have partnered to launch the world’s first cat treats made from cultivated fish. This is designed to address both sustainability and pet nutrition, through the provision of an alternative protein source.\nThe company UMAMI Bioworks is a Singapore-headquartered biotech company that has developed an automated cultivated seafood production platform. The company combines novel stem cell biology, machine learning, and automation to create a scalable, cultivated fish production system.\nThe firm also seeks to address environmental stewardship amidst dwindling ocean resources and growing demand of sustainable pet food. Consequently, FnF’s new product line of cat treats are based on UMAMI Bioworks’ advanced cultivated technology and processes.\nThe treats are said to be rich in high-value microalgae, a blend of high-quality cultured proteins and essential nutrients, ensuring that cats receive optimal nutrition and seeks to offer an alternative to traditional fishing practices, reducing the strain on badly depleted ocean resources.\nThe new food will reduce reliance on traditional fishing methods, which often lead to overfishing and ocean depletion. Cultivated fish production is more resource-efficient, requiring less land, water, and feed compared to conventional aquaculture.\nMihir Pershad, CEO of UMAMI Bioworks states : “Our collaboration with Friends & Family is a genuine testament to the commercial potential of cultivated seafood in transforming pet nutrition and ultimately human food systems. These novel cat treats embody our mission to provide high-quality, sustainable protein sources while alleviating the ecological pressure on our oceans.”\nIn terms of seeking to improve pet nutrition, these treats and future products are intended provide cats with high-protein, high-fibre nutrition, supporting immunity, digestion, and overall health.\nThe new products are intended to be launched in Singapore and San Francisco in early 2025.",

    "text": "Last Updated on December 28, 2023 Since the October 7th attack against Israel by Hamas, Zionists have been pressuring the American public to support the war with possible U.S. intervention. PragerU, a neoconservative, Jewish-owned and operated “educational” resource, posted on X that anti-Zionism is antisemitism, leaving no unprejudiced stances against the foreign policy agenda that serves Israel. Anti-Zionism = Antisemitism — PragerU (@prageru) [December 28, 2023] [Related: Dennis Prager Says Bisexuality is ‘The Norm’](https://nationalfile.com/dennis-prager-says-bisexuality-is-the-norm/) The Anti-Defamation League (ADL), which many [Jewish conservatives have rebuked as “leftists” and not “Jewish,”](https://townhall.com/columnists/brianpfail/2023/09/11/column-n2628215) has longed to establish anti-Zionism as antisemitism in accordance with the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA). [Its working definition](https://www.holocaustremembrance.com/resources/working-definitions-charters/working-definition-antisemitism) is certainly broad and, of course, includes anti-Zionism. This conflating of anti-Zionism with antisemitism has been the ultimate crutch for the Zionist agenda, although [support for US intervention continues to dwindle](https://nationalfile.com/corporate-media-targets-social-media-amid-falling-support-for-israel/) despite corporate media’s unabashed cheerleading. Recall only a few months ago, during the #BanTheADL campaign, this appeared as a censorship problem. The Daily Wire’s Ben Shapiro ushered a space with Elon Musk and nine Jewish leaders to discuss “antisemitism, faith and free speech.” The two-hour space was purely dedicated to antisemitism, as the nine explicitly told the owner of X that he simply didn’t understand the “sensitively of the Jewish people.” Here's an edited version of the [@benshapiro] [@elonmusk]space on Antisemitism and free speech. This version removes the long pause at the beginning, weird transitions, pauses, etc. This version is ~30% shorter and flows better. Thanks [@DavidCarbutt_]and team for the work! [pic.twitter.com/Me2koBqJKN] — Farzad (@farzyness) [September 29, 2023] Rabbi Menachem Margolin of the European Jewish Association (EJA) insisted on the IHRA’s working definition and for the billionaire to visit the Auschwitz concentration camp to demonstrate “antisemitism and what it could lead to.” Rabbi Abraham Cooper, the Associate Dean and Director of Global Social Action for the Simon Wiesenthal Center, then pressured Musk further on the “nuanced” definition. Cooper even claimed the Holocaust could happen again through “organized hate, a crisis, and technology …” Musk agreed with the working definition but hasn’t implemented such a policy. It would essentially eliminate all opposition to the Zionists and the war in the Middle East that doesn’t have a drip of American agenda. Anti-Zionism is antisemitism. — Nikki Haley (@NikkiHaley) [October 23, 2023] This is pure, unadulterated abuse of power by a particular interest group and their compadres, making them and their concerns, including American foreign policy, immune to all criticism and any true public discourse. There are multiple Jewish anti-Zionist NGOs that promoted the idea of an “ [antisemitic racket](https://townhall.com/columnists/brianpfail/2023/09/23/orthodox-jews-expose-zionist-antisemitism-racket-of-adl-n2628846).” Still, their funding is minimal compared to Zionist nonprofits. [Related: Establishment Crucifies Musk Over Jewish Antiwhitism Post](https://nationalfile.com/establishment-crucifies-musk-over-jewish-antiwhitism-post/) There is also the fact that most Republicans are neoconservatives, an ideology that began primarily as a Jewish movement pitching [Israel as “morally exceptional.”](https://lobelog.com/neoconservativism-in-a-nutshell/) So, it is very likely that the IHRA’s working definition will be implemented in the future, especially due to the conflict in the Middle East and its growing negative appeal to the American public.",

    "text": "Un fuerte temporal causó destrozos en Bragado provincia de Buenos Aires donde se registraron voladuras de techos y hasta el desprendimiento de una carpa instalada para una fiesta de egresados. Ocho personas resultaron heridas. El fenómeno forma parte de las tormentas que aquejan al centro de la Argentina que ya dejó una impresionante granizada en el sur de Córdoba y que podrían llegar antes de lo esperado a la Ciudad y el Gran Buenos Aires.La localidad del centro noroeste de la provincia registró este jueves un fuerte fenómeno climático de lluvia y viento que ocasionó daños en diferentes puntos de la ciudad y hasta dejó heridos.El más significativo se dio en la zona de la pista de ciclismo local donde se había montado una carpa de cerca de 100 metros para una fiesta de egresados. Sin embargo las fuertes ráfagas embolsaron las lonas que terminaron arrollando a varias personas que estaban en el interior realizando el montaje del evento.Al menos ocho personas resultaron heridas y fueron atendidas por personal de emergencias médicas detalló Bragado Informa.Además se reportaron daños en el sistema de sonido luces y también en el cableado luces instaladas en la pista.Por otro lado el mismo medio indicó que autos que se encontraban cerca sufrieron daños por la caída de estructuras metálicas. Los bomberos trabajaban en otros puntos de la ciudad donde se registraron voladuras de techos en viviendas.Las tormentas que afectan al centro del país también dejaron tormentas severas en Córdoba y San Luis. Las imágenes más impresionantes llegaron desde Río Tercero y desde General Moldes en el sur de la provincia mediterránea.En la zona de Río Tercero se levantaron ráfagas de más de 100 kilómetros por hora y nubes de polvo avanzaron sobre las rutas reduciendo la visibilidad. Y también llegó el agua.En el caso de Moldes las precipitaciones aportaron una fuerte granizada que tiñó de blanco las calles de la localidad.Alerta amarilla en 12 provincias y ¿se adelantan las tormentas en la Ciudad de Buenos Aires?El Servicio Meteorológico Nacional (SMN) emitió este jueves por la tarde un alerta por tormentas para 12 provincias. Rige para la provincia de Buenos Aires norte de La Pampa noreste de San Luis Córdoba Santa Fe este de La Rioja y Catamarca sur de Santiago del Estero casi todo Chaco el este de Formosa Corrientes y Misiones.El color de la advertencia habla de posibles fenómenos meteorológicos con capacidad de daño y riesgo de interrupción momentánea de actividades cotidianas.En los casos de Córdoba (centro y sur) Santa Fe (centro) y Santiago del Estero (salvo el norte) es de color naranja por \\\"fenómenos meteorológicos peligrosos para la sociedad la vida los bienes y el medio ambiente\\\".La Ciudad de Buenos Aires y el Conurbano no quedaron bajo alerta para este jueves. Pero el mismo SMN sí las incluye con alerta amarillo para este viernes.En la zona metropolitana se esperaba que las tormentas llegaran el viernes. Pero esa posibilidad se adelantó y cerca de las 19 ya había probabilidad de tormentas aisladas.Lo que parece seguro es que el viernes estará pasado por agua en el AMBA. Tormentas fuertes se registrarán a lo largo de la madrugada y de la mañana y según el pronóstico pasarán a ser aisladas por la tarde. A la noche ya bajará a probabilidad de chaparrones.Habrá una baja en las temperaturas máximas y mínimas ya que se espera a un rango de entre 19 y 27 grados.El fin de semana podría traer algunos eventos de precipitaciones el domingo. El sábado el cielo estará de mayormente nublado a parcialmente nublado con una mínima de 19 grados y una máxima de 28. El domingo en tanto el termómetro irá de 16 a 28 grados y podría haber lluvias aisladas en las primeras horas del día mientras que luego el cielo pasaría a estar algo nublado.",

    "text": "25/07/2024 - 20:22\nA\nvitória da seleção feminina de futebol por 1 a 0 sobre a Nigéria, na estreia da Olimpíada de Paris, foi muito celebrada nesta quinta-feira(25) na Fanfest do Parque Villa-Lobos, na capital paulista. Apesar disso, os torcedores que acompanharam a partida afirmaram que será preciso melhorar alguns fundamentos para que, finalmente, o Brasil conquiste a medalha de ouro olímpica.\n“Foi uma vitória no sufoco, por 1 a 0. Foi importante a vitória porque os próximos jogos são contra o Japão e a Espanha, que são seleções fortíssimas. Creio em uma medalha, mas vai ter que melhorar muito ainda”, disse Eduardo da Silva, de 43 anos, que foi à fanfest acompanhado da esposa e do filho. “Pelo elenco, o Brasil poderia ter produzido mais, mas tem o lance do nervosismo de estreia.”\nNotícias relacionadas:\nTiro com arco: Brasil fatura vaga de duplas mistas na estreia em Paris. Handebol: Brasil estreia em Paris com vitória impecável contra Espanha.\nPara Eduardo, o grande destaque da seleção brasileira nesta tarde foi Marta. “A Marta é nosso ícone. Tomara que ainda surjam outras Martas [no Brasil] e que não fiquemos só nessa”, afirmou.\nQuem também acha que a seleção ainda pode melhorar é a torcedora Fernanda Zaguis, de 37 anos. “Vim aqui hoje torcer pelo Brasil. O jogo foi bom, mas temos uns pontos para melhorar, como o entrosamento da defesa. Tivemos boas oportunidades, e a Marta brilhou, como sempre, fazendo lances incríveis. Acho que, com o passar da competição, o entrosamento da equipe ainda vai melhorar.”\nPara Fernanda, a expectativa é que Marta possa encerrar seu ciclo na seleção com “chave de ouro, conquistando a inédita medalha de ouro”.\nEsporte e superação\nA corredora Ana Luiza dos Anjos Garcez, mais conhecida como Ana Animal, também esteve na fanfest do Parque Villa-Lobos para torcer pelo Brasil na tarde de hoje. Conhecida pelo público paulistano por sempre estar presente nas principais competições esportivas torcendo pelo Brasil, ela chegou à fanfest com uma produção especial: portava uma corneta e estava com os cabelos trançados nas cores da bandeira nacional. “Para fazer esse cabelo aqui dói. Mas eu não posso ficar sem meu look do Brasil”, brincou.\n“Vim correndo para cá. Nem almocei. Foi um desespero para chegar aqui, mas deu tempo de assistir [ao jogo]. Eu gostei do Brasil. As meninas são raçudas, mas precisam ter mais força para chutar. Precisam chegar mais perto para meter bica. Pode melhorar mais um pouco. Hoje eu estava aqui gritando, nervosa, arrancando meus cabelos”, enfatizou.\nAna Animal, que já viveu nas ruas de São Paulo, especialmente na região da Cracolândia, reconhece a importância do esporte. Foi nele que ela encontrou força e superação. “Sou ex-moradora de rua. Morei 23 anos na rua. Um ex-secretário de Esportes me viu na televisão e me perguntou se eu queria sair da rua. Ele me tirou de lá e me arranjou um lugar para ficar. Comecei a correr e larguei tudo. Graças ao esporte, eu estou aqui hoje, viva! Se não fosse pelo esporte, eu poderia estar morta ou na cadeia. Eu amo o esporte”, afirmou.\nEspaço do torcedor\nPela primeira na história dos Jogos Olímpicos, uma fanfest oficial ocorre\nfora da cidade-sede. Chamada de Festival Olímpico Parque Time Brasil, a fanfest que foi criada no Parque Villa-Lobos está acompanhando, ao vivo, o desempenho dos atletas brasileiros em Paris em sete telões instalados no local. A programação também conta com interação com atletas e ex-atletas, megashows e uma área gastronômica.\nNa tarde ensolarada desta quinta-feira, por exemplo, muitos pais levaram os filhos para acompanhar o jogo da seleção feminina de futebol. E, no intervalo das partidas, as crianças ainda puderam curtir as atrações promovidas por patrocinadores, como a piscina de surf, a parede de escalada e até uma apresentação de duas atletas da ginástica rítmica.\nO festival é uma iniciativa do Comitê Olímpico Brasileiro (COB, em parceria com o DC Set Group e a Agência Deponto e será realizado até o dia 11 de agosto, quando terminam os Jogos de Paris. A expectativa dos organizadores do evento é que mais de 200 mil pessoas frequentem o espaço nesse período.",
