    "text": "SACRAMENTO – Governor Gavin Newsom announced from Sacramento that California is ramping up its disaster response support to states grappling with severe weather and wildfires, with new emergency deployments headed to New Mexico, Oregon, and Texas. These deployments include highly trained Urban Search and Rescue teams, firefighter strike crews, and emergency coordination staff. The latest round of support includes a focused response to flooding in Ruidoso, New Mexico. According to Governor Newsom’s office, three additional Federal Emergency Management Agency incident support personnel from California are now on the ground helping local officials manage the crisis. “California stands ready to help all Americans in times of crisis. Whether it’s battling wildfires or conducting life-saving search and rescue operations, our state’s highly trained first responders are answering the call to serve communities in need,” said Governor Newsom in a statement issued in Sacramento. Oregon, currently battling intense wildfires, has received substantial support from California. Cal Fire has deployed a strike team of five fire engines, staffed by 19 personnel, along with 28 additional supervisory and incident management personnel. “We stand with Oregon during this critical time, just as they’ve stood with us during some of California’s toughest fire seasons,” said Anale Burlew, Chief Deputy Director of Cal Fire. She added that these mutual aid partnerships are built on “trust, coordination, and a shared commitment to public safety.” In Texas, which is facing ongoing and deadly flooding, California has sent nine federal incident support team members to help with disaster coordination. These individuals bring planning and logistics skills crucial for managing complex emergencies. In addition, 18 local California personnel have been sent as part of a second wave of canine search and recovery teams. Nancy Ward, Director of the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services, emphasized that mutual aid remains a cornerstone of the state’s approach to emergency response. “California’s emergency management system is built on mutual aid and the spirit of helping our neighbors,” Ward said from Sacramento. “Our highly trained teams stand ready to deploy wherever they’re needed, bringing critical expertise and resources to save lives and support communities in crisis.”",

    "title": "Bispos moçambicanos decidem não dar bênção a casais do mesmo sexo | Igreja Católica | PÚBLICO",
    "text": "Vaticano autorizou a 18 de Dezembro, oficialmente, a bênção dos casais do mesmo sexo, mas bispos de Moçambique não o irão fazer. Os bispos católicos moçambicanos anunciaram ter decidido que “não se dê bênção” a casais do \"mesmo sexo\", apesar da decisão contrária anunciada pelo Vaticano. “Nós, os bispos, decidimos que em Moçambique não se dê bênção a uniões irregulares e uniões do mesmo sexo. Que o modelo de Igreja Família de Deus continue a ser o que inspira o nosso ser Igreja em Moçambique, e que Maria, Rainha da Família, guie e proteja as nossas famílias”, de acordo com um comunicado divulgado pela Conferência Episcopal de Moçambique (CEM). O Vaticano autorizou a 18 de Dezembro, oficialmente, a bênção dos casais do mesmo sexo , \"em situação irregular\" para a Igreja, mantendo a oposição ao casamento homossexual e não abençoando a união. É a primeira vez que a Igreja se pronuncia claramente sobre a bênção dos casais do mesmo sexo, um assunto que gera tensões no interior da instituição, devido a uma forte oposição do sector conservador, nomeadamente nos Estados Unidos. A CEM diz que o documento que autoriza o \"ministro ordenado a abençoar casais irregulares ou do mesmo sexo, facto este que está a provocar no meio das nossas comunidades cristãs, e não só, questionamentos e perturbações”. “A doutrina sobre o matrimónio e a família permanece inalterada porque, a bênção de que fala a Declaração, nada tem a ver com a liturgia e a celebração do sacramento do matrimónio, e a celebração deste sacramento não pode ser substituída de nenhum modo com uma bênção, como é prática nalgumas igrejas não católicas”, acrescentam os bispos, na mesma declaração. Defendem, contudo, que as pessoas que vivem em “situação de união irregular não devem ser afastadas da comunidade cristã, mas devem ser ajudadas, como todo o fiel, a adequar a sua vida à vontade de Deus por meio da proximidade da Igreja que conforta, cuida e infunde coragem”. “A Declaração [do Vaticano] afirma que a bênção apresentada como possível a ser invocada sobre uma união irregular ou do mesmo sexo não pretende legitimar estas uniões. Porém, na mente de muitos fiéis e na linguagem comum, com o termo bênção entende-se o mesmo que legitimar o que se abençoa. Por isso, a CEM exorta todos os ministros ordenados para que manifestem proximidade e acompanhamento a quem vive em uniões irregulares”, conclui a declaração. Apesar do não reconhecimento da Santa Sé, a bênção dos casais do mesmo sexo era já praticada por alguns padres, nomeadamente na Bélgica e na Alemanha e em Portugal.",

    "title": "Seattle Orcas close out season falling to Super Kings by 37 runs",
    "text": "When the first season of Major League Cricket came to a close, the Seattle Orcas showed their class. This year, the result was much different for the team of the Pacific Northwest. Seattle fell in its final match of MLC 2 to the Texas Super Kings, losing by 37 runs. It capped a horrid season for the green and gray, as the Orcas managed just two points and finished at the bottom of the table. Seattle is very South African heavy with its international players, who are coming off a world cup semifinal appearance. To say there were tired legs, would be stating the obvious. “Most of our pros came over straight from the world cup. Even if they won’t agree, they looked a little bit exhausted,” said Orcas All-Rounder Harmeet Singh. Some of the best South African cricketers have been playing without more than a week’s break for over four months. This season just wasn’t to be for the Orcas. Like Seattle’s other bat-to-ball franchise, the Mariners, the Orcas could not put consistent runs on the board. Over the course of the seven games played this season, Seattle batted second in three of them and chased runs successfully in their lone victory. But when the Orcas were required to put up a high number, Seattle continuously dropped the ball. When opening with the batting, the Orcas have won just one game in their two years of existence. It was all the way back on July 15, 2023, in a win over San Fransisco. But since then, Seattle has lost seven in a row when opening with the paddle. Despite quite literally nothing bouncing the way of the Orcas in year two, in the final match there looked to be some positives. Ayan Desai made his MLC and Orcas debut taking the ball to start the first over. With his first ball he took the wicket of a top-class cricketer in Devon Conway via leg before wicket. That ball was later named the play of the game and was the start of a great first match for Desai. He finished with 2 wickets and 30 runs, and an economy of 7.50 which was the third lowest of all bowlers in the game. It was just a bleak day with the bat for the Orcas after holding the Super Kings to a pretty manageable 177 after the first innings. Seattle knew it was going to have to work hard after its top run-scorer Ryan Rickleton was dismissed for a golden duck for the second straight match. Rickleton looked to be the bright spot of the Orca’s 2024 season scoring a century and spent a lot of time on the top of the run scoring table, but in his last two matches never saw a second ball. No Orca scored more than 26 runs (Quentin de Kock 19 balls), which pales in comparison to the Super Kings’ three players who scored over 29 in the match. It is a season to forget based on results for the Orcas, but MLC season 2 is a year to look back on as the sport of cricket continues to grow in the United States.
