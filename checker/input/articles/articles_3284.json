    "text": "Man celebrates last day of work after 48 years at supermarket chain WEST DES MOINES, Iowa (KCCI) - For an Iowa man, the start of 2024 will bring a lot of change to his normal routine as he retires from supermarket chain Hy-Vee after almost five decades. It’s not every day Steve Mick gets chauffeured around, but after 48 years at Hy-Vee, Sunday was his last day and his boss insisted on the special ride to work. Outside the West Des Moines supermarket was a display celebrating Mick’s years of service. “That’s amazing,” Mick said. “Wow. It’s about all I can say.” Inside the store, countless hugs and congratulations from family, friends and former colleagues showed the impact Mick had on the community. He started at Hy-Vee behind the meat counter in 1975 when he was just 16. “He’s the same person today: extremely nice, extremely thoughtful, willing to help the customers,” longtime colleague Marilyn Cook said. “He’s been such a hard worker all his life, and today is kind of a bittersweet day for all of us,” said Mick’s daughter, Kerri Driscoll. Mick worked at different Hy-Vee locations throughout his career, his last being the store in West Des Moines on Jordan Creek Parkway. “It was just a place that fit for me,” Mick said. “Been a long haul, and it’s been well worth it.” As the chapter at Hy-Vee comes to an end, the cake at Mick’s party is a hint as to what part of retirement looks like: camping and time in nature with family. “I’m going to let life happen to me, enjoy every minute of it,” Mick said. Mick’s co-workers say he will be missed after bringing smiles to people during his nearly five decades on the job. Copyright 2024 KCCI via CNN Newsource. All rights reserved.",

    "title": "Nadella Celebrates Azure's 15 Years: $75B Revenue in AI-Driven Growth",
    "text": "In a recent internal memo, Microsoft Corp. Chief Executive Satya Nadella marked the 15th anniversary of Azure, the company’s cloud-computing platform, by calling on employees to embrace long-term thinking amid rapid technological shifts. The memo, obtained by GeekWire, reflects on Azure’s evolution from its 2010 launch as a nascent service to a powerhouse generating over $75 billion in annual revenue, up 34% year-over-year. Nadella highlighted how early investments in data centers and infrastructure laid the groundwork for today’s AI-driven growth, urging staff to focus on decades-long horizons rather than short-term fluctuations.\nThis emphasis comes at a pivotal moment for Microsoft, as it navigates record profits alongside significant workforce adjustments. Despite laying off over 15,000 employees in 2025, including about 9,000 in July alone, the company reported flat headcount overall while ramping up capital spending on AI infrastructure to an estimated $80 billion. Nadella’s message positions these moves as necessary for agility in an era where cloud services like Azure are integral to enterprise AI adoption.\nAzure’s Journey from Startup to Cloud Giant\nLaunched initially as Windows Azure in 2010, the platform has undergone multiple rebrandings and expansions, evolving into a comprehensive suite that includes computing, storage, and AI tools. Historical insights from posts on X, formerly Twitter, trace its roots back to a 2008 announcement, when Microsoft aimed to provide businesses with scalable cloud solutions without heavy coding requirements. By 2025, Azure has not only surpassed competitors in growth rates but also captured market share, with analysts like Dan Ives noting on X that its expansion will accelerate further in the year’s second half, driven by AI workloads.\nNadella’s memo draws parallels to Microsoft’s past reinventions, such as its pivot under his leadership since 2014. In a 10-page pitch to the board before becoming CEO, as recounted in podcast discussions shared on X, he emphasized concepts like “ambient intelligence” and “ubiquitous computing,” visions now manifesting in Azure’s AI integrations. This long-view approach has propelled Azure past $75 billion in revenue, outpacing Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud in quarterly share gains, according to Nadella’s own statements in earnings calls.\nThe Enigma of Success: Layoffs Amid Prosperity\nYet, the memo arrives against a backdrop of internal challenges. Nadella previously addressed the “enigma of success” in a July memo, as reported by CNBC, acknowledging that job cuts have weighed heavily on him personally. With over 15,000 positions eliminated this year despite booming profits, he defended the restructuring as essential for reallocating resources to high-growth areas like AI. Critics, including employee sentiments echoed in media like WebProNews, point to morale dips, but Nadella frames it as a tech imperative for constant reinvention.\nThe layoffs align with broader industry trends, where cloud providers are doubling down on AI amid projections of tripling revenues by 2025 for major players like Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud Platform, per analyses from firms like Battery Ventures referenced in X discussions. Microsoft’s strategy includes massive investments in quantum computing, which Nadella touted as the next cloud accelerator in recent earnings commentary.\nLooking Ahead: AI and Quantum on the Horizon\nFor industry insiders, Nadella’s latest memo signals a commitment to sustained innovation. He urges employees to think in terms of 15-year cycles, much like Azure’s own trajectory, which has seen it integrate cutting-edge AI models and support global enterprises in digital transformations. Recent X posts from investors like Highcroft Investment Advisors highlight Nadella’s view that “cloud and AI is the driving force of business transformation across every industry,” underscoring Azure’s role in this shift.\nAs Microsoft maintains flat headcount while expanding AI capabilities, the focus on long-term thinking could mitigate internal unrest. Projections suggest Azure’s growth will continue outstripping rivals, with monetization from AI services ramping up significantly in 2025, as Ives noted. This positions Microsoft not just as a cloud leader but as a architect of the next computing era, blending historical lessons with forward-looking investments.",

    "text": "A group of lay people under the banner of Mar Thoma Nasrani Sangham (Association of St. Thomas Christians) have claimed there will be serious consequences if the unified Mass system is not implemented by July 3. The decision to have a unified Mass liturgy in the Archdiocese of Ernakulam-Angamaly was taken by the synod of bishops. But it has not been implemented after considerable delay for various reasons.\nMajor Archbishop Raphael Thattil and synod members must end their “double game”, and the attempt to side with two opposing groups simultaneously must end, said Regi Elamatha, president, and Xavier Madavana, secretary of the central committee of the Sangham, on May 25 (Saturday).\nThe synod and the Major Archbishop have publicly declared that they were with the Vatican on the issue of unified Mass. At the same time, the major archbishop and the synod have not implemented the decision of the Vatican and were playing a double game, the group alleged.\n“Since the faithful are in no position to join the unified Mass celebration, arrangements should be made to facilitate them to attend the synod Mass, the group said.” The synod could also arrange online Mass to allow the faithful to participate in the unified Mass, they added.\nThe group demanded disciplinary action against priests, who abused the sacrament of the Holy Mass on December 22 and 23 inside the St. Mary’s Basilica here. The church hierarchy should also prevent rebel activities being carried out through publications like Sathyadeepam , the group said.\nMeanwhile, the lay people’s group in support of full people-facing Mass appealed to the major archbishop, who returned from Rome on Saturday, to stick to his promise for a reconciliatory approach to the Mass liturgy issue.\nRiju Kanjookkaran of Alamaya Munnettam, claimed that the Major Archbishop’s contention that as many as 34 dioceses had accepted the unified synod Mass was false. He alleged that the decision on the unified Mass was “imposed” unilaterally on several dioceses.\nThe group also said it expected further proceedings on the issue would be in keeping with the words of the Pope, who had called for unity in the Church.\nRead Comments Copy link Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit READ LATER Remove SEE ALL PRINT",

    "text": "La dana mantiene en alerta naranja a Mallorca. La Agencia Estatal de Meteorología avisa de que temporal que durante todo este viernes ha azotado a la isla aún continúa activo y podría dejar importantes precipitaciones durante la próxima madrugada. Por ello, el servicio de Emergencias 112 insiste en reclamar a la ciudadanía precaución y que siga atenta a los avisos meteorológicos. Las lluvias han sido intensas durante toda la tarde de este viernes, especialmente en la Serra d’Alfàbia, donde se han acumulado 102 litros por metro cuadrado hasta las 19:00 horas. En Llucmajor, en la zona de Cap Blanc, se han registrado 72 litros por metro cuadrado. En Calvià y Palma la dana ha dejado hasta 45 litros por metro cuadrado; 39, en Escorca; y 35 en Soller y en Andratx. La Aemet prevé que la inestabilidad provocada por la dana se mantenga hasta primeras horas de la mañana. Así, durante la madrugada de este sábado se esperan chubascos localmente fuertes o muy fuertes, que pueden ir acompañados de tormenta y ser persistentes. La alerta naranja permanecerá activa hasta las ocho de la mañana. A partir de entonces se prevé que la situación se estabilice, aunque aún podría registrarse algún chubasco ocasional y aislado en algunos puntos de la isla. Las temperaturas se mantendrán con pocos cambios, con máximas de 24 grados y mínimas de 16. El viento soplará entre flojo y moderado del este y nordeste. El Govern balear pide a los ciudadanos que extremen las precauciones mientras se mantenga activa la alerta naranja en la isla. Se recomienda que se tomen precauciones y mantenerse informado de la predicción meteorológica más actualizada. Las actividades habituales y al aire libre pueden verse alteradas. El Servicio de Emergencias 112 mantendrá a su vez activo el Índice de Gravedad 1 (IG1) del Plan Meteobal por lluvias y tormentas en Mallorca y Menorca hasta las ocho de la mañana de este sábado.",

    "title": "Enhancing Workplace Efficiency with PIR Insulation Boards",
    "text": "Creating a comfortable and energy-efficient workplace is vital for fostering productivity and ensuring employee well-being. Insulation plays a crucial role in regulating indoor temperatures and reducing energy costs, and among the many options available, PIR insulation boards stand out as one of the most effective solutions for commercial and workplace environments.\nThe Importance of Insulation in Workplaces Workplace environments require consistent and comfortable temperatures to keep employees focused and productive. Whether it’s a bustling office, a warehouse, or a temperature-sensitive facility, insulation ensures that heat is retained during colder months and excess heat is minimized during summer. Without proper insulation, businesses face higher energy costs and a less comfortable working environment, which can negatively affect productivity.\nHow PIR Insulation Boards Improve Workplace Comfort PIR insulation boards excel at regulating indoor temperatures by minimizing heat transfer through walls, floors, ceilings, and roofs. Their low thermal conductivity means that workplaces can maintain a stable indoor climate regardless of the weather outside. In office settings, this translates to fewer temperature fluctuations, making the space more comfortable for employees.\nIn warehouses and industrial facilities, where maintaining specific temperature ranges is often critical, PIR boards ensure that heating and cooling systems don’t have to work as hard. This not only preserves the comfort of the staff but also protects temperature-sensitive equipment or inventory. There are many different brands of PIR insulation boards. The most popular being Kingspan or Celotex.\nThe Energy Efficiency Advantage PIR insulation boards are renowned for their superior energy efficiency, making them an excellent choice for businesses looking to reduce operational costs. By preventing heat loss in winter and limiting heat gain in summer, they help to lower the workload on heating and cooling systems. Over time, the energy savings generated by PIR boards can result in significant cost reductions, freeing up resources for other areas of the business.\nFor larger commercial properties or facilities that operate around the clock, the savings are even more pronounced. Many businesses that install PIR insulation report noticeable reductions in their energy bills within the first year.\nDurability and Reliability in High-Use Environments In workplaces, durability is a key consideration when choosing insulation. PIR boards are designed to withstand the demands of high-use environments, offering excellent resistance to moisture and fire. This makes them suitable for a range of workplace applications, from office partitions to flooring in warehouses.\nUnlike other insulation materials that may degrade over time, PIR boards maintain their performance for decades. Their structural integrity ensures that they continue to provide thermal efficiency even in challenging conditions, reducing the need for frequent maintenance or replacement.\nApplications of PIR Insulation Boards in the Workplace The versatility of PIR insulation boards allows them to be used in various areas of a commercial property. They are ideal for insulating walls in office spaces, creating a more stable indoor environment that supports employee comfort. In suspended ceilings, PIR boards enhance thermal performance while contributing to soundproofing, reducing noise distractions in busy workplaces.\nFor businesses that require temperature-controlled spaces, such as server rooms or storage facilities, PIR boards are invaluable. Their ability to provide consistent insulation ensures that sensitive equipment or perishable goods are kept at optimal conditions without excessive energy use.\nSustainability Benefits for Businesses In addition to their cost and performance benefits, PIR insulation boards align with the sustainability goals of environmentally conscious businesses. By reducing energy consumption, they help lower a building’s carbon footprint. This is particularly important for companies aiming to meet green building standards or achieve certifications such as BREEAM or LEED.\nFurthermore, PIR boards are often manufactured with eco-friendly materials and processes, making them a sustainable choice from production to installation. Businesses that prioritize sustainability not only contribute to a healthier planet but also enhance their reputation among clients and employees.\nAn Investment in Workplace Efficiency PIR insulation boards offer a comprehensive solution for creating energy-efficient, comfortable, and sustainable workplaces. Their ability to regulate temperature, reduce energy costs, and withstand demanding environments makes them an excellent choice for a wide range of commercial applications.\nBy investing in PIR insulation, businesses can improve employee satisfaction, protect valuable assets, and achieve long-term savings. Whether for an office, warehouse, or specialised facility, PIR boards are an investment that pays dividends in comfort, efficiency, and sustainability.",

    "text": "L’Agence Nationale de Promotion de l’Emploi et des Compétences (ANAPEC) compte aujourd’hui plus de 140 agences à l’échelle nationale, avec 680 agents mobilisés. Elle prépare désormais une augmentation de ses effectifs pour atteindre un total de 2.000 collaborateurs, afin de mieux accompagner les personnes en recherche d’emploi, a affirmé le ministre de l’Inclusion économique, de la Petite entreprise, de l’Emploi et des Compétences, Younes Sekkouri.\nPilier du marché du travail marocain depuis sa création, l’ANAPEC joue un rôle de médiateur essentiel entre les chercheurs d’emploi et les entreprises en quête de compétences. L’agence s’illustre désormais comme un acteur proactif et territorialement ancré, œuvrant à la dynamisation du marché de l’emploi à travers une série de services intégrés. Grâce à une plateforme numérique avancée et à des procédures nationales unifiées, l’agence traite les offres d’emploi de manière transparente, rapide et équitable à l’échelle nationale. Elle accompagne également les porteurs de projets souhaitant créer leur propre entreprise dans le cadre des dispositifs d’auto-emploi, a souligné Sekkouri.\nDans sa réponse à une question parlementaire écrite, le ministre a précisé que ce repositionnement intervient dans un contexte de redéfinition des priorités gouvernementales, qui placent l’inclusion économique, le développement de la petite entreprise et la formalisation du secteur informel au centre de l’action publique. Dans ce cadre, le ministère de tutelle a engagé une importante restructuration de l’agence afin de l’adapter à ces nouvelles missions.\nSelon le responsable, la transformation de l’ANAPEC s’est traduite par l’adoption d’une nouvelle organisation administrative, marquée par une augmentation du nombre de directions centrales, passées de trois à six, visant à doter l’agence d’une capacité d’action renforcée pour accompagner plus efficacement la stratégie gouvernementale dans le domaine de l’emploi, conformément aux Hautes Orientations Royales et en lignée avec les engagements du programme gouvernemental en matière de relance de l’emploi.\nCette restructuration permet également de renforcer la capacité d’intervention de l’agence, notamment en matière d’appui à l’insertion professionnelle, de soutien à l’auto-emploi et de médiation ciblée selon les besoins territoriaux. Sekkouri a ainsi fait savoir que l’objectif est d’assurer une plus grande cohérence, une meilleure efficacité opérationnelle, et une réponse directe aux transformations structurelles du marché de l’emploi.\nL’un des atouts majeurs de l’ANAPEC reste son déploiement territorial, a-t-il poursuivi, notant qu’à ce jour, l’agence compte 12 agences régionales, 81 agences provinciales, 11 agences universitaires, 8 unités mobiles et 36 espaces collaboratifs, soit un total de plus de 140 structures actives à travers le Royaume. Ce réseau est animé par 680 agents, dont 400 conseillers en emploi et 120 conseillers en entrepreneuriat, formant une équipe de proximité chargée d’accompagner aussi bien les demandeurs d’emploi que les entreprises.\nPour accompagner cette dynamique, le ministère prévoit un renforcement massif des effectifs, en augmentant le nombre de conseillers en emploi pour passer à 2.000 afin d’assurer un accompagnement personnalisé et une couverture territoriale plus fine, notamment dans les zones rurales. Ce déploiement permettra, d’après le responsable, de rapprocher davantage les services des citoyens et de garantir une offre de médiation plus réactive, inclusive et sectoriellement adaptée.\nEn outre, la feuille de route déployée par l’agence intègre une série de programmes spécifiquement conçus pour accompagner les populations les plus vulnérables face à l’insertion professionnelle. Parmi les bénéficiaires ciblés figurent les personnes en situation de handicap, les migrants en situation régulière, les femmes en situation précaire, les jeunes NEET, les anciens détenus, les habitants des zones rurales, ainsi que les candidats marocains à la migration encadrée.\nA travers ces programmes, l’agence affirme sa vocation inclusive, en accompagnant les parcours vers l’emploi mais aussi vers l’entrepreneuriat, via des dispositifs adaptés à chaque profil, a-t-il expliqué. Une attention particulière est également portée à l’accompagnement sectoriel, notamment dans les métiers verts, le travail indépendant numérique, ou encore les chantiers liés à la Coupe du Monde. L’ANAPEC entend ainsi anticiper les mutations économiques et les évolutions des besoins en compétences.\nLa transformation de l’ANAPEC passe aussi par une modernisation en profondeur de ses outils de pilotage. Le ministre a insisté sur l’importance de la digitalisation des parcours, avec l’introduction de profils bénéficiaires intelligents, l’utilisation de plateformes de données intégrées, et la formation avancée des cadres à l’analyse du marché du travail. Cette transition numérique s’accompagne du passage d’un contrôle a priori à un contrôle a posteriori, d’une simplification des procédures administratives, et d’une amélioration de la capacité de réaction face aux besoins du terrain.\nPar ailleurs, l’agence prévoit d’étendre son réseau via des partenariats avec les collectivités territoriales et les acteurs associatifs, tout en renforçant la gestion déléguée ou institutionnelle des ressources humaines sur le terrain.\nD’une autre part, le chantier de la réforme statutaire du personnel de l’ANAPEC, amorcé dès 2004, entre lui aussi dans une phase décisive. Un projet de nouveau statut a été élaboré, en réponse aux recommandations du conseil d’administration de 2007 et aux attentes exprimées depuis plusieurs années. Ce projet, désormais soumis aux partenaires sociaux, vise à garantir des conditions de travail équitables, motivantes et adaptées aux défis actuels de l’agence. Il s’inscrit dans une logique de valorisation du capital humain, considéré comme la clé de voûte de l’efficacité opérationnelle de l’institution.",

    "text": "Christians devotees take part in a parade along a road ahead Christmas celebrations, in Islamabad on December on December 5, 2023.\nPakistan caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar on Thursday declared a ban on the New Year celebration in the country as a gesture of solidarity with the people of war-torn Gaza. In an address to the nation, Kakar urged to show solidarity with the Palestinians and exhibit sobriety and humility at the New Year.\n“Keeping in mind the seriously concerning situation in Palestine and to show solidarity with our Palestinian brothers and sisters, there will be a strict ban by the government on holding any kind of event for New Year,” he said.\nMore than 20,000 Palestinians, majority of them women and children, have been killed since the start of the war, according to the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza. The ongoing war has already driven around 85% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people from their homes and with Israel expanding its ground offensive, more Gazans are expected to be displaced.\nKakar alleged that the Israeli forces have “crossed all limits of violence and injustice” with around 9,000 children dead since the Israeli bombardment began on October 7.\n“The whole Pakistani nation and the Muslim world are in a sheer state of anguish over the massacre of innocent children and genocide of unarmed Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.”\nHe said Pakistan had sent two aid packages to Palestine, with a third one in preparation. Kakar also highlighted Pakistan’s ongoing efforts to raise awareness about the plight of the Palestinian people on global platforms and affirmed the country’s commitment to continuing these efforts to halt the bloodshed perpetrated by Israel.\nPakistan’s New Year celebrations are traditionally not huge due to the influence of Islamic groups who try to stop the festivities through various methods, including the use of force.\n(With inputs from agencies)\nRead more news like this on HindustanTimes.com",
