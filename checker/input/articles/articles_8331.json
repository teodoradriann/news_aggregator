    "text": "Do Painted Shells Hurt Hermit Crabs? The Truth Revealed Yes, painted shells can be significantly harmful, even deadly, to hermit crabs. While the vibrant colors might attract the eye, the paint itself poses several serious threats to these fascinating creatures. The chemicals in the paint can leach into their food and water, contaminate their environment, and be directly ingested as the crabs groom their shells. Furthermore, the paint can hinder the shell’s natural function in maintaining proper humidity and may even lead to shell abandonment, a potentially fatal situation for a hermit crab. Choosing natural, unpainted shells is always the safest and most responsible option for your shelled friend.\nThe Dangers of Painted Shells: A Deeper Dive Hermit crabs rely on their shells for protection, shelter, and maintaining a humid environment crucial for their survival. Painting these shells introduces a host of problems that can severely impact their health and well-being.\nToxicity: Many paints, even those marketed as “non-toxic,” contain chemicals that can be harmful to hermit crabs. These chemicals can leach into the crab’s water and food, poisoning them over time. Heavy metals, in particular, are extremely dangerous. Ingestion: Hermit crabs are meticulous groomers. They constantly clean and inspect their shells, and this behavior can lead to the ingestion of paint chips or dissolved paint. Shell Abandonment: Hermit crabs are very picky about their shells. The paint alters the texture and feel of the shell, making it less comfortable and potentially leading the crab to abandon it in search of a more suitable home. This leaves them vulnerable to predators and dehydration. Hindered Respiration: The paint can clog the pores and natural texture of the shell, hindering its ability to retain moisture. Hermit crabs need a humid environment to breathe properly, and a painted shell can disrupt this balance. Overheating: Dark-colored paints absorb more heat than lighter colors. In a humid environment, this can cause the crab to overheat, leading to stress and potential death. Shell Modification Interference: Hermit crabs often modify their shells to improve the fit. Paint prevents this natural behavior, potentially causing discomfort. Choosing the Right Shells: A Guide for Hermit Crab Keepers Providing your hermit crabs with the correct shells is essential for their health and happiness. Here are some tips for choosing the right shells:\nNatural is Best: Always opt for natural, unpainted shells . Variety is Key: Offer a variety of shell shapes and sizes to allow your crabs to find the perfect fit. Proper Size: Shells should be big enough for the crab to retreat into completely but not so large that they are difficult to carry. It’s best to offer a variety of sizes slightly larger and smaller than the one your crab is currently using. Appropriate Opening: Avoid shells with slit-like openings, such as those from Volute, Cypraea, Oliva, and Conus shells. Hermit crabs need a round opening to properly grip the inside of the shell. Cleanliness: Before introducing new shells, boil them for a few minutes to sterilize them. Addressing Existing Painted Shells: A Rescue Mission If you have hermit crabs in painted shells, it’s crucial to take action to rectify the situation.\nOffer New Shells: Provide a variety of natural shells in the tank to entice your crabs to switch. Removing Paint: If possible, try to remove the paint from the existing shells. Boiling the shell and gently scraping with a toothpick or nail file might work, but be extremely careful not to damage the shell. Monitor and Support: Keep a close eye on your crabs during the transition. Ensure that the humidity and temperature in the tank are optimal. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About Hermit Crab Shells 1. Why is it so important for hermit crabs to have shells? Hermit crabs are vulnerable without their shells. The shell provides protection from predators , helps maintain moisture , and offers a secure environment for growth and molting.\n2. What happens if a hermit crab doesn’t have a shell? A hermit crab without a shell is exposed to the elements, vulnerable to predators, and prone to dehydration. This stressful situation can quickly lead to death.\n3. How do I know if my hermit crab needs a new shell? Signs that your hermit crab needs a new shell include repeatedly digging, changing shells frequently, restlessness, and attempting to squeeze into smaller shells . You might also observe them carrying their shell awkwardly.\n4. Do hermit crabs prefer certain types of shells? Yes, hermit crabs often have preferences for certain shell types. They typically prefer shells that are lightweight, appropriately sized, and comfortable . The specific preference can vary depending on the species of crab. Studies suggest they may prefer darker colored shells.\n5. Can I use shells I find on the beach for my hermit crabs? Yes, but you must thoroughly clean and sterilize them first. Boil the shells for several minutes to kill any bacteria or parasites. Ensure the shells are of appropriate size and shape for your crabs.\n6. What types of shells should I avoid giving my hermit crabs? Avoid shells with slit-like openings, those that are too heavy, or those with sharp edges . Also, avoid using shells that have been treated with chemicals or sealants.\n7. How often should I change the shells in my hermit crab tank? You don’t need to change the shells unless they become damaged or contaminated. However, it’s a good idea to periodically add new shell options to the tank to provide your crabs with fresh choices.\n8. Is colored sand bad for hermit crabs? Yes, colored sand is often harmful . The dyes used to color the sand can be toxic to hermit crabs, and the small particles can be ingested, leading to health problems. Natural sand or coconut fiber is a much better substrate option.\n9. Can hermit crabs get stressed? Yes, hermit crabs can experience stress. Inappropriate temperature and humidity levels, lack of suitable shells, overcrowding, and excessive handling can all contribute to stress. Stressed crabs may exhibit decreased activity, loss of appetite, and shell abandonment.\n10. What are the ideal temperature and humidity levels for hermit crabs? Hermit crabs thrive in a warm and humid environment. The ideal temperature range is 70-85°F (21-29°C) , and the humidity should be maintained between 50-70% .\n11. How long do hermit crabs live? With proper care, hermit crabs can live for many years. Some species, like the Caribbean hermit crab ( Coenobita clypeatus ), can live 20 years or more in captivity.\n12. Are hermit crabs social animals? Yes, hermit crabs are social creatures and do best when kept in groups . Keeping them alone can lead to loneliness and stress.\n13. What do hermit crabs eat? Hermit crabs are omnivores and have a varied diet. They eat commercial hermit crab food, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and even small amounts of protein such as cooked chicken or fish.\n14. Why did my hermit crab leave its shell and die? Several factors can cause a hermit crab to leave its shell and die, including low humidity, high temperature, toxic environment, stress, illness, and the lack of suitable shells.\n15. What are the signs of a dying hermit crab? Signs of a dying hermit crab include lethargy, lack of appetite, foul odor, not responding to stimuli, and remaining outside of its shell.\nProtecting Hermit Crabs: A Call to Action By understanding the needs of hermit crabs and providing them with a safe and healthy environment, we can help ensure their well-being. Avoid purchasing painted shells and instead, focus on providing your crabs with a natural and stimulating habitat.

    "text": "GRAND RAPIDS, Mich — Driving up and down Alpine Ave. in Walker, plow truck drivers can be seen braving the blustery winds and late nights, keeping parking lots and roads clear. To thank them [Amore Trattoria Italiana](https://www.facebook.com/AmoreTrattoriaItaliana), run by Chef Jenna Arcidiacono, opened their doors for snow plowers, power company linemen, tow truck drivers and EMT's, giving them free Lasagna Soup and bread. Chef Jenna told 13 On Your Side that while on her way to work, she noticed how bad the roads were getting, and wanted to do something nice for those keeping the streets clean and safe on the first night of Michigan's first major winter storm. When 13 On Your Side stopped by the restaurant, we weren't able to talk with any drivers because they were already back on the roads. But Chef Jenna said they served about 20 workers Friday evening. \"I just don't think they get the love that they deserve,\" said Chef Jenna. People forget that they're away from their families for very long shifts. Like I asked one of the guys, he's like probably on an 18-hour shift. I'll take a couple of hour naps and then I'll be back on the road.

    "text": "Progressive Christianity’s Half-Jesus is No Jesus at All\n“On the Cross, Jesus sided with the marginalized, oppressed and despised. The resurrection was God’s affirmation of that choice and, in his ‘coming out’ of the tomb, Jesus offered hope, possibility, love and welcome.”\nSo\nsaid Professor Susan Shaw in a lecture last year to homosexual and transgender “welcoming and affirming” Baptist churches. So say a thousand others I’ve seen, taking pieces of truth about Jesus and trying to mold the whole of Him out of it. “Jesus’ mission was all about love, especially for the lesser among us. If He were alive today He would open His arms to everyone.” You have never met anyone who was so insistent on doing things his own way, while also being known for having great love for others.\nThat’s the kind of distorted version you get from taking part of the truth about Jesus and treating it as the whole truth about Him. The “affirming” churches aren’t the first to do it. Plenty of people in the Gospels thought they’d seen all they needed of Jesus when they’d only seen part of Him. It wasn’t just His enemies. His friends, His disciples, even His family made the mistake.\nMary: “Jesus, you’re our son. How could you treat us so?”\nMen of Nazareth: “Jesus, you’re Joseph’s son. That makes you one of ours, our hometown boy!”\nSatan: “Jesus, you’re the Son of God. You could jump off the roof of the temple and not get hurt. Scripture even says so!”\nThe crowds: “Jesus, You’re the King, so what are You waiting for? Let’s get on with it! Freedom!”\nPeter: “Jesus, you’re our Messiah. How could you even think of letting yourself be killed on the a cross?”\nPharisees: “Jesus, it’s the Sabbath. Behave yourself!”\nMore Pharisees: “Jesus, you claim to be a Man of God. How can you dine with sinners?”\nHalf Right Isn’t Right\nIf you’ve read the Gospels you know these incidents well enough. Did you notice they all start out perfectly true? Even the Devil got the first half right!\nThe account with Mary is especially interesting. It’s in Luke 2:41-49, where Jesus stays behind in Jerusalem while Joseph and Mary head home toward Nazareth. They find Him at last in the temple. Mary asks, “Son, why have you treated us so? … Your father and I have been searching for you.” Jesus answers, “Why were you looking for me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father’s house?”\nIt’s subtle but you’ll see it if you look: They were His parents. True, but not true enough. Joseph was His adoptive father, God was His true Father.\nPlease Support The Stream: Equipping Christians to Think Clearly About the Political, Economic, and Moral Issues of Our Day. []()\nThe second event was in Nazareth, the scene recorded in Luke 4:16-30. Jesus reads and teaches from Scripture, and “All spoke well of him … And they said, ‘Is this not Joseph’s son?'” Jesus says (paraphrased), “No one recognizes a prophet for who he is in his home town. So rather than comply with your ‘hometown boy’ plans for me, I’ll go ahead and remind you how much God loves Gentiles.”\nTrue, He grew up in Nazareth. Not true enough, though: He wasn’t going to be owned by them. They tried throwing Him off a cliff for it. The devil’s words to Jesus were true, but not true enough. Jesus answered with a firm and scriptural no of His own. Peter was right that Jesus was the Christ — but not right enough. He wanted Jesus safe from dying, but Jesus shot back at Him, “Get behind me, Satan!”\nLoving, Not Accommodating\nThey saw something true about Jesus, all right. Their mistake was making it the whole truth about Him. Read the Gospels and see how consistently, persistently, He insisted on being who He was, not who anyone else wanted Him to be. You can bet plenty of people walked away from Him scowling and muttering, “Stubborn, stubborn, stubborn! I wish the man would cooperate for a change.”\nJesus didn’t come to cooperate. He didn’t come to be who people wanted Him to be. God doesn’t need us telling Him who He should be. Jesus came to start a spiritual revolution in His name, done His way, according to His word and His standards, through His grace, by faith, including repentance. That’s who He was, that was His message and mission, and He refused to be budged off of it.\nYou have never met anyone with such great love for others, yet so insistent on doing things His way.\nYou have never met anyone with such great love for others, yet so insistent on doing things His way. The two traits stand in such great contrast to each other, you’d think no one could do it. Jesus did. It’s one more way in which He is just astonishingly unique.\nHe gladly accommodated Himself to others’ needs, but only up to a limit. He never budged one inch on His identity, His mission, His message, or His authority.\nTaking His Name in Vain\nMy last example in the list above (“More Pharisees”) is especially interesting in this light. The Pharisees in His day told Him in effect, “Enough of being so accepting toward sinners. You have to have standards!” Progressives in our day flip that backwards: “Enough of having those standards. Jesus accepted sinners, so if you’re going to be a Christian you have to accept sinners!” Both of them build their ethics on half-truths. Both of them are wrong.\nTrue enough, Jesus accepted sinners, but building an ethical system on your favorite parts of Jesus’ message is the same as building a “Jesus” who rubber-stamps your own beliefs. Why not pull from Matthew 21 instead, where Jesus pronounces woe after woe upon the Pharisees. That’s a an easy answer: No one says the Jesus of Matthew 21 is what Jesus really looks like, because no one wants a Jesus like that.\nProgressives in particular craft a “Jesus” to their liking, by pulling from the “loving” and “affirming” messages they prefer. They end up preaching their own views with Jesus’ name on it. Is that not taking His name in vain?\nYou cannot speak of His welcoming sinners without including the context, which always had to do with repentance. You cannot say He welcomes all without recalling that He welcomes us on His terms only, and His terms are not open for us to change.\nSee the True Jesus\nWe’re all prone to seeing less than the full truth of who Jesus was and is. The one best protection against it is to study Him closely. Read the Gospels, re-read them, and re-read them some more. Jesus Himself showed us, over and over again, how He would only be who He was, all of Him, in all His grace, all His truth, all His Kingliness, all the reality that He is the Judge, and all the rest of Him I do not have space to mention here.\nThe next best way to guard against the error is to listen to voices from different places and different eras. They may not see Jesus for all He is, for as C.S. Lewis pointed out once, we all make mistakes, but they made different mistakes. Seek what’s true in what they say.\nProgressive Christians claim the only right way to follow Jesus is to welcome sinners like He did. If only they did indeed welcome them as He did, with an invitation to follow Him in faith and repentance!\nDon’t let them shame you with their false virtue, their message that only they have Jesus right. Don’t settle for less than all of Him.\nTom Gilson (\n@TomGilsonAuthor) is a senior editor with The Stream and the author or editor of six books, including the highly acclaimed Too Good To Be False: How Jesus’ Incomparable Character Reveals His Reality.",

    "text": "Hit music games Beatstar and Country Star are now being run by just six staff after Duolingo swooped in to acquire 22 NextBeat staffers.\nNextBeat’s plans to raise funding and expand its roster of games are also on ice after the Duolingo deal, says outgoing boss Simon Hade.\nThe language app said last week that it had acquired the NextBeat team, but it wasn’t quite clear form the announcement what would be happening next to its games, Beatstar and Country Star.\nNeither game was part of the Duolingo deal, meaning that as 22 NextBeat staff transition over to the language (and now music) learning app, six staff will remain at NextBeat to continue operating Beatstar and Country Star, outgoing NextBeat boss Simon Hade told us.\n“Duolingo hasn’t bought NextBeat or the games,” he explained. “The entities remain entirely separate, and Duolingo doesn’t own any of the game assets or the publishing rights. This was a team acquisition, not an asset acquisition.”\n“Beatstar and Country Star are still published under Space Ape’s account and operated by NextBeat. That work is led by the six-person team who didn’t join Duolingo, so nothing has changed there operationally.”\nThe remaining NextBeat team will “share future plans when they’re ready”, Hade added, but for now, while the ambitious plans NextBeat announced in January, just after the firm spun out of Space Ape, are now paused.\n“Back in January, our roadmap was to launch new genre-specific versions of Beatstar and grow our brand in games as a stepping stone to something much bigger,” Hade explained. “Our north star was to expand into broader consumer apps – particularly learning, because Beatstar had already proven it could teach rhythm implicitly.”\n“Those standalone plans for NextBeat, including seeking investment and slate expansion, are now on ice. Our new mission is to help Duolingo deliver the best education in the world and make it universally available – starting with languages, but now also Math, Chess, and Music, which is where we come in.”\nAs for how the Duolingo deal came about, Hade says his and Space Ape’s relationship with Duolingo goes back to 2022, when Duolingo first spun up a music section in its app. “We connected to share notes on working with the music industry,” says Hade. “[NextBeat cofounder] Olly [Barnes] even helped them with licensing after leaving Space Ape. So when we started fundraising, we reached out hoping they’d join the round and formalise that connection.”\n“As the round progressed, discussions deepened,” Hade added. “Duo visited us in London, and we made trips to Pittsburgh and New York to learn how they worked. I was initially unsure—moving from a multi-game studio to a single app felt like it might be limiting. But once we saw their approach to product, and their broader vision, it clicked.”",

    "text": "El Papa Francisco, quien atraviesa un estado crítico debido a una neumonía doble, agradeció a los fieles por los numerosos mensajes de apoyo recibidos durante su hospitalización, en un comunicado emitido este domingo. El Pontífice, de 88 años, les aseguró que se encontraba descansando adecuadamente.\nTe puede interesar: Papa Francisco 'pasó una noche tranquila y pudo descansar', reportan médicos\n“En estos días he recibido muchos mensajes de afecto, y me han llamado especialmente la atención las cartas y los dibujos de los niños”, afirmó Francisco a través de la plataforma X.\n“¡Gracias por esta cercanía y por las oraciones de consuelo que he recibido de todo el mundo! Os encomiendo a todos a la intercesión de María y os pido que recéis por mí”, agregó.\nEl Papa fue ingresado en el hospital Gemelli de Roma el 14 de febrero después de presentar dificultades respiratorias durante varios días, y los médicos le diagnosticaron neumonía en ambos pulmones.\nEl sábado, el Vaticano informó que su condición era crítica por primera vez, detallando que el Pontífice necesitaba oxígeno suplementario y transfusiones de sangre tras una \"crisis respiratoria prolongada similar al asma\".\nA pesar de los problemas de salud, el Vaticano indicó que Francisco tuvo una noche de descanso “tranquilo”, y el Papa aseguró a los fieles que se encontraba en el camino hacia la recuperación.\n“Continúo con confianza mi internación en el Hospital Gemelli, siguiendo el tratamiento necesario; ¡también el descanso forma parte de la terapia!” afirmó en un comunicado oficial.\n“Agradezco sinceramente a los médicos y al personal sanitario de este hospital por la atención que me brindan y la dedicación con que desempeñan su labor entre los enfermos”, añadió.\nEl domingo, la diócesis de Roma celebró una misa especial por la salud del Papa Francisco. El arzobispo Rino Fisichella, alto funcionario del Vaticano, pidió a los fieles reunidos en la Basílica de San Pedro que hicieran sus oraciones por el Pontífice “más fuertes e intensas”.\nLos fieles acudieron en masa al Vaticano y a las inmediaciones del hospital Gemelli para rezar por la salud del Papa, dejando flores y mensajes en una estatua del difunto Papa Juan Pablo II.\n“Estoy muy, muy triste”, expresó Elvira Romana, de Italia. “No sé cómo se puede seguir con normalidad en este momento”. Por su parte, Matteo Licari, de Cerdeña, se mostró “muy preocupado”. “Esperemos que pueda seguir con vida”, comentó Licari. “Estamos esperando su regreso”.\nTambién puedes leer: Papa francisco sufre crisis respiratoria prolongada; con diagnóstico “reservado”\nLa neumonía doble es una infección grave que puede inflamar y cicatrizar ambos pulmones, dificultando la respiración. El Papa, debido a su historial médico, es especialmente vulnerable a este tipo de infecciones pulmonares, ya que sufrió de pleuresía en su juventud, lo que le obligó a extirparse parte de un pulmón.\nEl Dr. Sergio Alfieri, miembro destacado del personal médico del hospital Gemelli, advirtió que existía el riesgo de que la infección pulmonar pudiera propagarse al torrente sanguíneo del Papa, lo que podría llevar a una sepsis, una condición potencialmente mortal de difícil tratamiento.\nCONSULTA AQUÍ LAS NOTICIAS DE ÚLTIMA HORA\n*brc",

    "text": "A promoção da saúde mental se fortaleceu pela implementação das Práticas Integrativas e Complementares em Saúde (PICS), consideradas pela Organização Mundial da Saúde (OMS) como práticas voltadas à saúde e ao equilíbrio vital do homem. Entre elas, estão arteterapia, ludoterapia, biodança, meditação e bioenergética.\nAs PICS dialogam com a base teórico-prática pautada na medicina oriental, que objetiva o olhar “holístico” e “integral” do ser humano, estando em consonância com os pressupostos teórico-práticos da psicopedagogia em prol da promoção da saúde mental.\nOs jogos e atividades psicopedagógicos pautados nessas práticas desempenham um papel valioso no estímulo ao desenvolvimento humano integral e na promoção da saúde mental. Eles podem ajudar a melhorar a cognição, a criatividade, as habilidades emocionais e o bem-estar.\nAbaixo, confira algumas atividades que podem ser realizadas entre amigos, por terapeutas e na escola.\nPor Bianca Isabela Acampora (especialista em Arteterapia em Educação e Saúde, Psicopedagogia e Neurociências Cognitivas) e Silva Ferreira (doutora em Ciências da Educação)",
