    "text": "A severe thunderstorm that hit the region on Thursday evening has left several suburbs across the City of uMhlathuze without power.\nTechnicians are working to fix multiple faults caused by the storm as parts of Richards Bay and Empangeni are still without electricity.\nThese areas include Arboretum, Mandlazini, Meerensee, Wildenweide, parts of the Richards Bay CBD and Empangeni.\nFor some areas, this is the second consecutive day without power, following another outage caused by Wednesday night’s storm.\n“We had multiple faults across the city due to Wednesday and Thursday’s thunderstorms,” said uMhlathuze Deputy Mayor Christo Botha.\n“The city’s electrical team has been working around the clock on fault finding, which is a labour-intensive operation because the problem is widespread.\n“We have decided to engage contractors to assist because we want to avoid a situation where we sit for three to four days without electricity,” he said.\nBotha assured residents that work is ongoing and called for patience as the city exhausts all efforts to restore supply to the affected areas.\nThere are also reports of a protracted power outage in St Lucia.\nDon’t have the ZO app?

    "title": "George North: Why Welsh rugby may never see his like again | ITV News Wales",
    "text": "It feels like George North has been around forever, and so it feels almost unfathomable that Saturday will be his last game for Wales.Having made his debut aged 18, he’s lived his life in the brightest of spotlights.In 2010, he burst onto the scene as a bulldozing winger from Anglesey, rattling off two tries against South Africa on his debut standing opposite none-other than Bryan Habana.Welsh rugby had never seen such raw athleticism. The size, speed and nimbleness made for an explosive package.It didn’t take long for the hysteria to surround him. Hasty comparisons were drawn to All Black great Jonah Lomu. North’s modesty would never allow him to entertain such things.The spectacular start to his career - by the time the 2011 Rugby World Cup was over, he’d scored nine tries in his first 15 matches - made him a global superstar.In many ways, it is impressive that he simply kept his career on the straight and narrow, with countless commercial deals filling his inbox. Doors were being opened away from the rugby field, but his focus on what really mattered never wavered.In 2013 he took his game to another level. His carrying of Israel Folau during the Lions tour of Australia is now one of the sport’s most iconic images. For a month, he tormented Australian rugby, leaving as the tour’s joint-top try-scorer with Alex Cuthbert. His 60-metre solo try in the first Test, where he left yellow jerseys clutching at thin air, will go down as one of the greatest Lions scores in history.But it wouldn’t all be plain sailing.A series of concussions would present challenges. North appeared low on confidence and his form suffered as a result.HIs profile and the nature of the head injuries he suffered led to seemingly everyone having an opinion on whether he should continue playing.North has always maintained that he sought regular independent medical advice before deciding to continue his career.Heading through to the 2019 World Cup, critics seemed ever-present.He became a victim of his early success. Test rugby wasn’t ready for a player like North and the Welsh rugby public came to expect blockbusting runs on an all too regular basis.But the sport evolved. In many ways, it caught up.Professional rugby is now a land of giants. North is no longer an outlier.In recent years, if he’d made 10 yards with a carry, some would ponder why he did make 20. If he scored one try, why didn’t he score two.Criticism was unfair. Statistically, he was roughly as prolific in the second half of his career as he was in the first.In the latter years, he made the switch that Gatland always thought he could - from wing to centre.The transition was not always smooth. He had a tough outing against Ireland - a team who are masters at exposing the opposition’s outside centre - at the Aviva Stadium during the Covid pandemic.But he adapted and began showing some of the form of his career in 2021, helping Wales to another Six Nations title. It would be North’s fourth European success with his country, a haul that included the Grand Slams of 2012 and 2019.By the end of that Six Nations, he seemed a shoo-in to start at outside centre for the Lions on the impending tour of South Africa.But a heartbreaking ACL injury in a Rainbow Cup match at an empty Swansea.com Stadium ruined his hopes of making a third tour.To his credit, he fought back to earn a place at his fourth Rugby World Cup last year and was an ever-present in the starting XV until the very end.At one point in his career, you feared Welsh rugby would never know what they truly had in North until he was gone.Happily, in more recent years, there seems to have been a greater appreciation of his talents.He is undoubtedly a modern great. Third on Wales’ all-time caps list behind Alun Wyn Jones and Gethin Jenkins.He is the youngest ever player to reach 100 caps and second on the all-time try-scoring list behind Shane Williams.It is not hyperbole to ponder whether Welsh rugby will ever see another talent like his.Want a quick and expert briefing on the biggest news stories?

    "title": "'It is historic': US poised to see record drop in yearly homicides despite public concern over crime",
    "text": "The year is expected to end with over 2,000 fewer murders than in 2022.\nWith 2023 ticking down, the nation is poised to finish the year with its biggest annual drop in homicides on record, according to preliminary data from law enforcement agencies both large and small.\nThe homicide rate in the United States is expected to plummet nearly 13% compared to 2022, meaning more than 2,000 fewer people were the victims of homicide this year, Jeff Asher, a national crime analyst, told ABC News.\nThe drop in homicides comes as more than three-quarters of Americans say there is more crime in the U.S. than a year ago and more than half of Americans say the same about crime in their local area, according to a Gallup poll released last month. Adding to that perception is the annual National Crime Victimization Survey published this month by the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics that found the number of violent crime victims nationwide climbed from 16.5 per 1,000 people in 2021 to 23.5 per 1,000 in 2022.\nCities say the 2023 drop in homicides and other violent crimes can be attributed to expanded efforts to prevent crime, including working with community volunteers, targeting gun possession in high-crime areas and placing officers on foot and bike patrols.\n\"It is historic. It's the largest one-year decline,\" said Asher, co-founder of AH Datalytics and a former crime analyst for the CIA and the New Orleans Police Department. \"It's cities of every size, it's the suburbs, it's rural counties, tiny cities, it's large cities. It's really a national decline.\"\nAsher said his analysis is based on available preliminary crime data provided by 180 law enforcement agencies.\nHe said before this year, the largest year-over-year drop in homicides occurred in 1996 when murders fell by 9%.\nAn ABC News review of preliminary crime data from the 10 largest U.S. cities shows that heading into the last week of the year, seven of the municipalities have seen double-digit year-over-year declines in 2023 homicides -- including an 11% drop in New York City, a 16% decrease in Los Angeles, and a 13% reduction in Chicago.\nHouston, the country's fourth largest city, saw its homicide numbers fall by 11% and homicides in Philadelphia, the nation's sixth biggest city, have fallen by 21%, according to the preliminary data.\nThe challenge faced by local law enforcement to bring down the country's homicide numbers for the second consecutive year following a record jump in 2020 and a sizable increase in 2021, was achieved this year with a major assist from the U.S. Justice Department and bipartisan gun-control legislation passed by Congress, officials said.\n\"We're seeing double-digit declines in homicide across nearly 70 of America's largest cities,\" U.S. Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said in an exclusive interview with ABC News chief justice correspondent Pierre Thomas, citing information from the Major Cities Chiefs Association.\nMonaco said the federal government has played the role of \"force multiplier\" in helping local law enforcement drive down the nation's murder rate by identifying and removing the most prolific shooters and violent offenders from the streets.\n\"Something that we are doing is using new authorities from the most significant gun safety law that has passed in 30 years ... the bipartisan Safer Communities Act that passed last year. And with that tool, we've charged more than 300 defendants with new gun trafficking and illegal trafficking,\" Monaco told ABC News. \"We're using tools like crime-gun intelligence, the ability to trace the gun and the spent shell casing from a crime scene to identify who's that shooter, how many violent crimes have they been involved with.\"\nSmaller cities are also seeing dramatic decreases in homicides. New Orleans, which had the highest murder rate in the nation in 2022, has seen a 25% drop in homicides in 2023. Baltimore's homicide numbers have fallen by 25%, Atlanta's by 18%, and Miami's by 15%.\nBut not all cities have seen homicides fall. As of Dec. 26, Washington, D.C., has seen its homicides jump 36% and Dallas has seen a 14% increase. In Memphis, Tennessee, homicides rose 31% through the first six months of the year, the most recent data available.\n\"But those cities are especially notable because they are outliers this year, not the norm,\" Asher said.\nOne of the largest drops in homicides occurred in Detroit, which as of Dec. 26 has seen murders fall by 18% since last year, according to the police department's preliminary data.\n\"We're looking at some numbers that we haven't seen in close to 60 years in the city of Detroit,\" Detroit Police Chief James White told ABC News. \"But we're stopping short of celebrating because certainly we still have a lot of work to do.\"\nFollowing a rash of shootings in downtown Detroit in April, White immediately instituted a 12-point crimefighting program normally reserved for the hot summer months, he said.\n\"That involved just really having officers on foot patrol, bike patrol, engaging our community in a very positive way,\" said White.\nHe said the city, led by Mayor Mike Duggan, a former Wayne County prosecutor, has helped pave the way for an overall reduction in crime by boosting the number of police officers from 2,331 in 2022 to 2,486 in 2023 and giving cops a substantial pay raise. White said his department has been approved to hire another 200 officers in the coming year.\nLike other chiefs interviewed by ABC News, White attributed a large part of Detroit's crime turnaround to winning back the public's trust following widespread protests and calls for defunding police departments in the wake of the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police officers in 2020. White said the city forged relationships with \"community violence interrupters,\" civilians who work in the streets to help the police department pinpoint problem areas and solve crimes.\n\"They're sick and tired of the senseless, violent crime and they're cooperating. They're telling us where the problems are, and it's our responsibility to address them quickly and keep working to keep those relationships strong in the community,\" White said about community violence interrupters.\nThe result, he said, has been 55 fewer homicides in the city compared to this time last year.\n\"That's 55 lives, 55 people, 55 mothers, fathers, husbands, wives, brothers, sisters that don't have to bury a loved one,\" White said.\nWhite also noted that there have been 135 fewer non-fatal shootings in Detroit compared to last year.\n\"So if half of those had resulted in homicide, you can clearly see what the numbers would be, and the victimization that would have occurred, the families that would be impacted. But the fact that 135 people weren't shot this year is absolutely incredible,\" White said.\nBesides the tumbling homicide numbers nationwide, Asher said preliminary data shows significant decreases in nearly every type of violent and property crime, except for auto theft which has risen 10%. Through the first three quarters of the year, he said aggravated assaults were down 7%, robbery declined 9% and the number of rapes fell 15%.\n\"It's something that I think ideally deserves more attention. We certainly pay attention when things go up,\" Asher said. \"I think that we should be talking about it and writing about it, and discussing it when it goes down as well because there are important things to learn there, and we should be acknowledging what's happening.\"\nDespite the reductions in homicides and other violent crimes nationwide, recent polls indicate the majority of Americans believe overall crime is out of control.\n\"Seventy-something percent of Americans believe crime is rising this year. And seventy-something percent of Americans in this case just happen to be wrong,\" Asher said, citing the Gallup poll last month.\nAsher's analysis appears to correspond with a report released last week by the Council on Criminal Justice, a think tank comprised of policy leaders in the criminal justice field. The CCJ analyzed preliminary crime data from 30 large U.S. cities and found that homicides in the first half of the year fell 9.4%.\n\"If this trend continues through the end of 2023, the nation will have experienced one of the largest single-year homicide reductions in the era of modern record-keeping,\" the CCJ said in a statement.\nThe Gun Violence Archive, a website that tracks shootings across the nation, also reports a significant 9% drop in gun homicides this year. As of Dec. 26, 18,513 people had been victims of homicide, about 1,700 fewer than in 2022, according to the website.\nThe sizable fall in homicides comes after a record high in murders was set in 2020 at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic when courts were mostly closed and jail populations were being drastically reduced in an attempt to curb the spread of the virus.\n\"Certainly, after it hit, we saw backlogs of cases and delayed trials and things like that,\" White said. \"There was no real accountability for bad acts.\"\nAccording to the FBI's annual Uniform Crime Reporting Program, which analyzed data from 15,897 law enforcement agencies, the largest single-year jump in murders in more than a century occurred between 2019 and 2020 as murders and nonnegligent manslaughter offenses nationwide rose nearly 30%.\nHomicides across the country continued to increase in 2021 by 4.3% before falling by 6% in 2022, according to the FBI report.\nSan Antonio, Texas, the nation's seventh biggest city, has experienced a nearly 12% decline in homicides this year, after seeing murders rise by 43% in 2022 compared to 2021.\nSan Antonio Police Chief William McManus told ABC News that the 231 homicides that occurred in his city in 2022, included the deaths of 53 migrants found in the back of an abandoned tractor-trailer as part of a human smuggling operation.\n\"If you're looking at including those numbers, we're looking at about a 32% decrease. But if you extract those numbers, we're looking at a 12% decrease year-to-date,\" McManus said. \"But we're not complaining about 12% though.\"\nOne of the multiple crimefighting strategies McManus attributed to his city's falling homicide numbers was first suggested by a team of criminologists at the University of Texas at San Antonio.\n\"Actually, it was a very simple strategy that, quite frankly, I was somewhat skeptical of at first,\" McManus said.\nHe said by examining calls to the city's computer-aided dispatch system (CAD), the police department identified 28 areas of the city with the highest numbers of violent crime calls and even pinpointed certain days and times when the volume of calls is the highest.\n\"We will sit there at that location with our emergency lights on for 10 to 15 minutes. That's about as proactive as it gets,\" McManus said. \"We're not getting out stopping people or knocking on doors or anything like that. It's simply a high visibility, hot-spot policing effort.\"\nMcManus said that in the coming year, he plans to try other crimefighting strategies involving the city's public works department and animal control services.\n\"Specifically, to mention Animal Care Services, if you have a bunch of dogs running around, it brings the quality of life in that neighborhood down,\" McManus said. \"If you have a bunch of abandoned properties that are not being tended to, it brings the quality of life of that neighborhood down. Those properties could be used for drug sales, drug use, prostitution, all those things that make a neighborhood feel unsafe.\"\nAnother strategy is to \"address specific actors that are involved in violent crime,\" he said.\n\"We pull them in, most of them are under supervision, and we offer them services, we offer them possible employment. If you choose to accept that type of help, whatever it may be, then good for you,\" McManus said. \"But if you don't, then the next time you're arrested, we're going to throw the book at you.\"\nIn Phoenix, the nation's fifth largest city, interim Police Chief Michael Sullivan credited a 15% decline in homicides this year to a crimefighting strategy focused on clearing the streets of violent criminals in possession of guns.\n\"We know that if we focus on those areas, we're going to see reductions, and we did this year,\" Sullivan told ABC News.\nSullivan said his department launched \"Operation Summer Shield\" this year, which involved the help of federal and other local law enforcement agencies to round up people with warrants for their arrests. He said the operation resulted in the arrests of 580 people, with 70% wanted for felonies.\n\"I think we seized 40 guns from those prohibited possessors,\" Sullivan said.\nSullivan said he has also used the strategy of putting detectives on the streets during the summer months to help increase patrols, saying, such a move has \"been very important in helping us control the homicide number this year.\"\nLike in Detroit, Sullivan said non-fatal shootings, which he described as \"truly failed homicides,\" are down 18% this year and attributes that to the launch of a \"Non-Fatal Shooting Investigation Squad\" that responds whenever a bullet pierces the skin to assist or assume the investigation.\nBut like other police chiefs in cities with falling homicide numbers, Sullivan said community engagement has been the most beneficial in the post-pandemic era.\n\"Community engagement is much easier when you're not doing it on a Zoom call, when you're having face-to-face meetings with the community and being able to build that trust,\" Sullivan said. \"When I talk about community engagement, you put a lot of deposits in the bank before people trust enough to be able to give us the information to close crimes.\"\nSullivan said his agency has also focused on recruiting the best officers for the job.\n\"What we would expect from our police departments is to have a good strategy. But then you have to have women and men who can go out and execute that strategy,\" Sullivan said. \"That's what we have here at the Phoenix Police Department, and I believe that's a recipe for success.\"",

    "text": "By Jake Foster ,\n10 hours ago There are tons of fun things to do in Nashville, Tennessee, but seeing a movie may not be one of them—for one clear reason. While some may prefer to watch new releases on streaming services at home, I will always be a fan of movie theaters. I grew up going to the movies regularly, and in high school, I probably saw one film per week every summer. Even as an adult, I try to get there as often as possible to immerse myself in classic movie magic. Plus, the popcorn and soda refills are pretty cool too. That said, there is one city where even longtime moviegoers are likely to avoid—Nashville, Tennessee. Read full article\nRead in NewsBreak",

    "title": "Apparent gunshot wounds on Gaza hostages fuel questions over their fate | CNN",
    "text": "Tel Aviv CNN — Fury was palpable at the end of a demonstration in Tel Aviv on Thursday, as protesters demanded a deal to free Israeli hostages in Gaza and grieved this week’s news that the bodies of six captives had been retrieved.\nTheir tragic fate has raised fears that more Israeli hostages will not be retrieved alive either, said one protester. “We need to bring back those that we know were alive,” Daniel told CNN. Continuing war as negotiations for a ceasefire-hostage deal falter “will only bring more coffins to them and to us,” the 48-year-old added.\nThere has been no official explanation yet of how the six died.\nOn Thursday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that initial forensic tests suggest that all six hostages had been shot, but it has not determined whether the gunshot wounds were the cause of death. IDF also underlined that the findings are preliminary.\nThe IDF said four additional bodies were found next to the bodies of the six hostages, which were believed to be those of the Hamas militants who had been holding the hostages, but that no evidence of shooting was found on their bodies.\nThe IDF did not name any alleged shooter.\nBut standing outside Israel’s Ministry of Defense, Daniel said the IDF’s announcement that all six hostages had been shot underlines the potential danger in rescue operations that depend on force.\nIsraeli outlet Ynet had reported on Tuesday that an IDF preliminary assessment was that the hostages may have died due to suffocation after the IDF hit a nearby Hamas target and carbon dioxide flooded the tunnel where they were being held.\nAsked in a news conference on Tuesday whether the IDF had killed the hostages, spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari did not clarify whether the hostages had been killed as a result of Israeli military action. Instead, Hagari referred back to a statement he made in June, when he had said the “the hostages were killed while our forces were operating in Khan Younis.”\nUrgency and chaos The deaths have renewed urgency for a ceasefire among the protesters in Tel Aviv on Thursday.\nOmer, 46, who was at the protest with his two daughters, said that he believed the six hostages “could have been saved a lot earlier.” He accused the Israeli government of repeatedly stalling on inking a deal with Hamas, which he warned would only led to Israel paying a higher price for an agreement that could have been secured earlier.\nA ceasefire would also bring relief to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians living in the besieged enclave as Israel forges ahead with its military operation. The United Nations estimated in July that up to 1.9 million people in the strip have been displaced, almost the entire population of Gaza.\nAmid renewed Israeli evacuation orders, the IDF-designated “humanitarian zone” in the Strip has been steadily shrinking. In the past month alone, the IDF has reduced this zone by 38% – with the remaining space making up just over a tenth of Gaza’s total area, according to a CNN analysis.\nMourners attend the funeral of Yagev Buchshtab, one of the six hostages whose bodies were retrieved from Gazan captivity and brought to Israel in a military operation, in Kibbutz Nirim, southern Israel, August 21, 2024. REUTERS/Florion Goga Florion Goga/Reuters Related article Israeli hostage families to boycott October 7 memorial as ceasefire talks drag on\nAt least 22 Palestinians were killed in southern Gaza on Thursday, among them a child and four women, Dr. Mohammad Saqer told CNN from Nasser Hospital. An Israeli airstrike on a house in Bani Suhaila, east of Khan Younis, resulted in the killing of at least five members of a single family, whose bodies were taken to the hospital, according to a family member.\nThe family had tried to follow the IDF’s orders, according to Hamza Abu Shab, a relative of the victims. But an airstrike hit before they reached an evacuation zone, killing several family members, including his father.\nThere is skepticism within Israel about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s willingness to strike a deal in Gaza given fierce opposition from far-right ministers in his coalition. The Israeli prime minister’s political future largely depends on his far right coalition partners – several of whom have already threatened to leave the government and cause its collapse if he agrees to the deal.\n“Maybe Hamas kidnapped them (the hostages), but the one we can accuse of murdering them is Benjamin Netanyahu,” protester Omer said, adding that the prime minister is “the only one responsible.”\nTop row from left to right: Yoram Metzger, Alexander Dancyg, Avraham Munder. Bottom row from left to right: Chaim Peri, Nadav Popplewell, and Yagev Buchshtab Hostage and Missing Families Forum/Reuters A group representing the families of Israeli hostages, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, said in a Thursday statement that the forensic tests that found gunshot wounds amounted to “further proof of the cruelty of the terrorists” who held them in captivity.\nThe Forum also reiterated criticism of Israeli authorities, saying that the recovery of bodies “is no achievement.”\n“It is a testimony of the complete failure to reach a deal in time, as six hostages who were supposed to return alive have returned in coffins,” the Forum said.\nThe recovered bodies were identified by Israeli officials on Tuesday as belonging to Yoram Metzger, Alexander Dancyg, Avraham Munder, Chaim Peri, Nadav Popplewell and Yagev Buchshtab. All but Munder had been announced dead in recent months by the Israeli military.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Joe Biden. Getty Images Related article Biden spoke with Netanyahu Wednesday at a critical moment in Gaza talks\nIsrael’s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said the IDF and ISA had entered Hamas tunnels in a “complex operation” to retrieve their bodies.\nMunder was taken along with his wife, daughter and grandson, who were later freed during a temporary truce between Israel and Hamas in November. Munder’s son, Roee, was killed during the attack.\nNine-year-old Ohad Munder told Israel’s public broadcaster Kan 11 on Tuesday that the death of his grandfather and the other hostages “shouldn’t have happened.”\n“There have already been many times when there were negotiations for (a) deal… and then they say no – and in the end they don’t want it, and always regret it at the last minute. All the hostages could have returned alive even on the first day. They could have brought back grandfather and all the other hostages,” Ohad said.\nThere are currently 109 Israeli hostages that remain in Gaza, including 36 believed to be dead, according to data from the Israeli Government Press Office.\nCNN’s Kareem Khadder, Eyad Kourdi and Tamar Michaelis contributed reporting.",

    "text": "—\nUnfortunately, Martin Šoltys was injured in the final part of his preparation for the famous event and will be replaced by Dutchman Pascal de Baar. This is hopefully the final line-up of the team, which also consists of Aliyyah Koloc in the car category and Jaroslav Valtr and Daniel Stiblík in the truck category.\n\"We have to confirm that Martin Šoltys will miss his Dakar 2024 start due to his recovery from injury. However, we have managed to secure an adequate replacement to continue the testing programme with the new car. Pascal de Baar is a very experienced racer, and I believe that our cooperation collaboration on the EVO3 project will be successful,\" said Martin Koloc, Buggyra‘s Team Principal.\n\"To miss the debut of the Tatra Buggyra EVO3 just before the start is indescribable. I am very sorry to have made things so difficult for the team. It's a shame, but that's part of the sport. Now I have to focus on treating my injuries and I will keep my fingers crossed for the whole team, at least from home,\" said Martin Šoltys.\nPascal de Baar was originally scheduled to take on the role of fast assist for the Boucou Assistance team at the wheel of the MAN in January. He welcomed the opportunity to drive the Tatra with joy. \"I appreciate the fact that Buggyra boss Martin Koloc approached me. Tatra has had a great name in Dakar for decades, and it is an honour to drive such an exceptional vehicle as the new Tatra Buggyra EVO3. Even though I will only get to know it just before the start of the event, I believe I will be an asset to the team,\" said the Dutch driver, whose navigator will be compatriot Gijsbert Verschoor. Tomáš Šikola remains their mechanic.\nAfter her debut in the T3 Lightweight Prototype class in January, Aliyyah Koloc is set to make another debut. At only 19 years old, she will be racing in the elite T1+ class with the RedLined Revo T1+. Her navigator will be Frenchman Sébastien Delaunay. After recent testing in Abu Dhabi, she is ready to take on the car's elite. \"The races I did with this car before the Dakar definitely helped me improve as a racer, as did the final tests. Now I'm looking forward to the start of the rally where I want to show everything I have in me,\" said Aliyyah.\nBuggyra will once again field three race trucks. In addition to the aforementioned new EVO3, the experienced Jaroslav Valtr will be at the start of the Dakar Rally. He will defend his excellent fifth place in the Tatra Phoenix. \"The upcoming competition will be challenging. The route promises to be probably the toughest Dakar in Saudi Arabia. As a driver, I am of course looking forward to it, even though I know it will be hard work,\" said the 54-year-old driver.\nDaniel Stiblík will make his Dakar debut in January. The newcomer will be behind the wheel of the second Phoenix of Tatra Buggyra ZM Racing. \"I am very much looking forward to my debut. I will fulfill my childhood dream. It will be great to be a part of this legendary race, as a member of the Buggyra team,\" he said.\nThe Dakar Rally takes place from January 5 to 19, 2024, in Saudi Arabia. It starts in the city of Al-UIa, crosses the country towards the legendary Empty Quarter area, and finishes in Yanbu on the shores of the Red Sea.\nBuggyra at the Dakar Rally 2024:\nCars:\n#239 Aliyyah Koloc - Sébastien Delaunay, RedLined Revo T1+\nTrucks:\n#604 Jaroslav Valtr - René Kilián - David Kilián, Tatra Phoenix\n#605 Pascal de Baar - Gijsbert Verschoor - Tomáš Šikola, Tatra Buggyra Evo3\n#626 Daniel Stiblík - Lukáš Kvasnica - Jiří Tomec, Tatra Phoenix\nhttps://www.facebook.com/BUGGYRA\nhttps://twitter.com/buggyra_racing\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/buggyra-racing\nhttps://www.instagram.com/buggyra_racing/\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@buggyra\nContact Info:\nName: Buggyra Organisation\nEmail:\nSend Email\nOrganization: Buggyra Organisation\nAddress: Buggyra, La Villa 19, Galerie Charles III, 98000 Monaco\nPhone: +3778004459\nWebsite:\nhttp://www.buggyra.com\nRelease ID: 89117369",
