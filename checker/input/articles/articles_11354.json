    "text": "CONSHOHOCKEN, P.A. ( KYW Newsradio ) —- Allied Universal, the parent company of Universal Security Services, said in a notice sent to the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry that it would be laying off 72 employees from its Conshohocken headquarters between May and September this year. In the notice, Allied said the layoffs would involve support staff that included accountants, analysts, engineers, IT workers and those in the company’s accounting department. The company issued a statement that said in part, “the workforce reduction is a result of a company-wide centralization and standardization of all our business processes.” It also comes after Allied Universal completed six acquisitions in 2024 of various security companies in the U.S., Australia, the Netherlands, and Barbados, which were reported earlier this month. Those companies were reported to have revenues totaling $240 million. Allied employs 770,000 people worldwide and the Universal Protection Service branch is one of the top 30 employers in Pennsylvania. The Conshohocken office is one of two headquarters in the U.S. The other is in California. Late last year, the company also announced layoffs of more than 300 employees at four different locations in California.",

Several waterfronts have been flooded and many beaches have been closed: the alert announced by the weather services of the north and center of the state remains in effect until Friday morning.\nA series of storms and powerful winds in the Pacific Ocean are responsible for these waves, explains the New York Times . In a video shared on X (formerly Twitter), young children looking out over the ocean in Santa Cruz find themselves trapped in a wave crashing over passers-by and the road along the coast.\n\"Mavericks\" Another video, broadcast by the American media outlet BNO news, shows the appearance of a powerful wave apparently out of nowhere, under a bright sky: water spreads in the town of Ventura, moving cars while residents run away. Eight people were injured, according to local media.\n«\nThese conditions can be deadly ,\" the National Weather Service warned. The weather service also issued warnings to seasoned surfers who had come to take on the challenge of \" Mavericks \", a famous breaking wave off the coast of the town of Half Moon Bay, south of San Francisco. Some spectators perched on a hill admired the prowess of surfers attracted to the waves, some of which could reach up to 12 meters high, according to Reuters .",

    "text": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — A 67-year-old road construction worker has died five days after being critically injured in a hit-and-run crash in a construction zone in West Palm Beach.\nThe crash happened on Dec. 21 on North Congress Avenue and Executive Center Drive.\nWest Palm Beach police said Louis Vixon, of Miami, was working in a coned-off area where overnight road resurfacing was taking place, when he was struck by a dark-colored car. The impact catapulted him into a second worker.\nA passing West Palm Beach Fire Department rescue truck, responding to another call, stopped to render aid and took Vixon to St. Mary’s Medical Center. Vixon underwent hours of surgery for his internal injuries. The second worker was not injured.\nVixon remained in critical condition in the hospital’s trauma intensive care unit. He was declared brain dead on Christmas Eve, and died the morning after Christmas.\nWest Palm Beach Police Department Traffic Homicide Unit investigators are still looking for a dark passenger car with visible damage.\nAnyone who sees a car matching the description with recent damage, or has information about this crash, should call traffic homicide investigator Mark Hatfield at 561-822-1784, or report the information anonymously to Crime Stoppers of Palm Beach County at 800-458-TIPS (8477), or online at www.CrimeStoppersPBC.com .",

    "text": "\\nSitting too much may be linked to cardiovascular issues later in life regardless of how much you exercise, according to a study released Friday.\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s a lot of research supporting the importance of physical activity,\\u201d said Shaan Khurshid, a cardiac electrophysiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital and a co-senior author on the study. \\u201cIn contrast, there\\u2019s relatively little know about sedentary behavior, and because of that, the guidelines are not as specific about what we should be doing about sedentary behavior.\\u201d\n\\nThe study, published by the Journal of the American College of Cardiology , found that individuals who spend more than 10.6 hours per day in a sedentary state \\u2014 defined as sitting, reclining or laying down \\u2014 are 40% more likely to develop experience heart failure and 54% more likely to experience fatal cardiac events. The research also showed an increased likelihood of the development of heart attack and stroke, but to a lesser extent.\n\\nResearchers looked at data collected by a United Kingdom-based research center, UK Biobank, in which almost 90,000 individuals wore wrist-based activity trackers for a week. They then compared each individual\\u2019s recorded sedentary behavior with future diagnoses of various cardiac diseases.\n\\nThe study also suggested that going for a run before work won\\u2019t make up for sitting at your desk all day, Khurshid said.\n\\nPrevious studies that focused on the importance of exercise recommend at least 150 hours of moderate to vigorous physical activity per week. According to this new data, however, the consequences of excess sedentary behavior are independent of how much exercise an individual gets.\n\\n\\u201cInterestingly, we still saw those [negative] associations even among people who met those guideline-recommended levels of exercise,\\u201d Khurshid said. \\u201cAmong individuals that 150 minutes per week, we still saw substantially higher risks of [cardiovascular] death if they were also sedentary.\\u201d\n\\nAs a result, the researchers concluded that the best way to reduce the negative effects of sitting too much is by reducing the amount of time spent in a resting position.\n\\n\\nAccording to Ezim Ajufo, a cardiology fellow at Brigham and Women\\u2019s Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, and the lead author on the study, excess sitting causes inflammation, changes in metabolism and abnormalities in muscle structure. Exercise not only reduces those negative consequences, but strengthens the heart as well.\n\\n\\u201c[Exercise] has this really interesting positive remodeling effect on the heart,\\u201d Ajufo said. \\u201cIt makes your heart more efficient in giving blood to the body.\\u201d\n\\nEssentially, she said, consistent exercise teaches the heart to pump out more blood with each beat, decreasing the number of heartbeats needed to supply the body with a sufficient amount of blood for both functionality and recovery, and thus reducing the amount of work the heart needs to do.\n\\nThough the study did not focus on what kinds of exercise best mitigate the effects of sitting too much \\u2014 a question Khurshid hopes researchers will answer in the near future \\u2014 both he and Ajufo said it\\u2019s clear that substituting the time spent sitting with minimal physical activity can go a long way toward increasing heart health.\n\\n\\u201cWe found that, regardless of how [individuals] reallocated [sitting time], as long as they went from sedentary behavior to something else, they substantially lowered their risk of heart failure and [cardiovascular] death,\\u201d Khurshid said. \\u201cEven if you could work in a couple days of the week where you\\u2019re not above 10.6 [hours] when you used to be, that\\u2019s likely beneficial.\\u201d\n\\nIn a world that requires many people to be at a desk and in front of a computer all day, finding the chance to move around can be difficult \\u2014 even more so if your job is remote and doesn\\u2019t require a commute. With that in mind, Khurshid and Ajufo suggest things like taking a walk while you\\u2019re in a meeting, lightly using a treadmill or walking pad at your desk or even gardening.\n\\nBut before one can accurately reduce time spent in a resting position, the amount of time spent sitting needs to be measured, Ajufo said. Popular wrist-worn activity trackers have helped measure movement, but the same technology doesn\\u2019t exist \\u2014 or at least, isn\\u2019t nearly as accessible \\u2014 for measuring sedentary behavior.\n\\n\\u201cThe reason that a lot of us are better about taking steps and things like that is we can measure it now. You can see how you\\u2019re doing, and it\\u2019s almost a gamification of that lifestyle metric, Ajufo said. \\u201cWe now need to have sitting time be measured in a more mainstream way, in the way that we measure steps and other things.\\u201d\n\\nThough the study\\u2019s large sample size was helpful in providing an accurate picture of the effects of sedentary behavior, it\\u2019s important to note the questions that are left unanswered and the limitations of this particular data set, Khurshid said. A week is the standard metric used in similar wrist-based activity-monitoring studies, but future studies may want to consider using data collected over a longer period of time.\n\\nAjufo also noted that the data is also only observational, meaning that while the researchers can draw conclusions, a more formal, controlled study is necessary to verify the link between sedentary behavior and heart disease.\n\\nAdditionally, she said, because the data was collected in the United Kingdom, where the population is mostly white, it may not be representative of the more diverse population in the United States although it\\u2019s likely generally applicable.\n\\nIt\\u2019s important to remember that there is a silver lining, Ajufo said. Getting real exercise outside of the minimal activity you can weave into your workday is still good, and if you know you sit too much, you\\u2019re not doomed forever. Just get up and move.\n\\n\\u201cFolks that are wanting to implement these findings in their lives \\u2014 just do something that isn\\u2019t sitting,\\u201d she said. \\u201cWhether it\\u2019s jogging or something more vigorous, there is something you can do about it.\\u201d\n\\n",

    "text": "Nearly 2,900 buyers have embraced an often reviled form of ownership in a high-rise near the Magnificent Mile.\nHilton Grand Vacations Club’s first Chicago property, comprising the top six floors of the Doubletree Hotel at 300 East Ohio Street, has sold 2,862 timeshares since 2022, Crain’s reported, citing Chicago Cityscape.\nBuyers take part-time ownership rights and annual or biannual usage periods. These timeshare, priced between $20,500 and $70,000, have generated $126.6 million, which is just $44,000 per timeshare but over $1.6 million per unit.\nThe timeshare model provides limited ownership, attracting buyers seeking affordable options for vacation stays.\nEach timeshare in the building provides owners with a small fraction of the property and guaranteed use for a specified period. One buyer, for instance, paid $37,000 for 0.12 percent ownership, granting a week-long annual stay in a studio unit. Another paid $24,400 for 0.099 percent ownership, allowing biannual use of a similar unit.\nThe Florida-based timeshare company, led by CEO Mark Wang, acquired the six-story section of the building in 2019 for $54.5 million, later converting 122 hotel rooms into 78 studio and one-bedroom timeshare units. This marked Hilton Grand Vacations’ entry into Chicago, expanding its portfolio of 166 properties, including resorts in Hawaii and Florida and city locations like Paris and South Bend, Indiana.\nThe property’s location has also played a critical role in its appeal due to being within walking distance of Navy Pier, North Michigan Avenue and other cultural attractions like the Museum of Contemporary Art.\nTimeshares don’t compete directly with condos, but the robust sales indicate confidence in Chicago’s recovery, said Gail Lissner, managing director of Integra Realty Resources. Downtown condo sales grew 6 percent last year compared to the previous year, with areas like Streeterville and River North seeing a 6.7 percent increase.\nAlternative real estate models also gained momentum, including hotel-condos, where owners can use their units part-time and rent them as hotel rooms. At Trump International Hotel & Tower, sales of hotel-condos more than doubled last year.\n— Andrew Terrell",

    "text": "Justice Department says new Texas immigration law violates Constitution A new law that gives local law enforcement in Texas the authority to arrest migrants “violates the US Constitution,” the Department of Justice said in a letter to Gov. Greg Abbott on Thursday, threatening to sue unless Abbott backs down from enforcing it. The letter, obtained by CNN, marks the latest escalation between President Joe Biden and Abbott over the handling of the US-Mexico border. Earlier this month, Abbott, a Republican, signed into law the measure, known as [ Senate Bill 4](https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/19/politics/white-house-response-texas-law/index.html?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo), which gives local law enforcement the power to arrest migrants and gives judges the ability to issue orders to remove people from the United States. The White House slammed the law, calling it “incredibly extreme.” It’s expected to take effect in March. Principal deputy assistant attorney general Brian Boynton said in his letter to Abbott Thursday that “the United States intends to file suit to enjoin the enforcement of SB 4 unless Texas agrees to refrain from enforcing the law.” While the federal government is “committed to … securing the border,” Boynton wrote, the Texas law is “contrary to these goals.” The ongoing surge of migrants at the US-Mexico border has placed immense pressure on local and federal resources. Thursday’s legal threat follows a DOJ lawsuit against Texas earlier this year over the state’s use of [ floating barriers in the Rio Grande](https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/07/politics/texas-water-barriers-migrants-appeal/index.html?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo). That lawsuit is still making its way through the courts. The enforcement of immigration law is a federal responsibility, and opponents of the Texas measure argue it’s unconstitutional. The law has sent ripples of fear throughout the Latino community in Texas, which makes up [40% of the state’s population](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/TX/POP010210). Civil-rights groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, [filed a lawsuit](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-civil-rights-orgs-sue-texas-over-sb-4) seeking to block the measure. The Justice Department’s threat to sue comes on the heels of a [high-levels talks ](https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/27/politics/blinken-mayorkas-mexico-border-crossing-biden/index.html?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo)between senior US and Mexican officials this week Officials from both countries described talks as productive, and Mexican officials are [expected to visit Washington ](https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/28/politics/mexican-officials-washington-meeting-biden-administration/index.html?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo)next month to continue the discussions.
