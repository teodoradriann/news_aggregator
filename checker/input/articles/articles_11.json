    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II Saleen Martin USA TODAY During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle.\nThe Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\"\nTwo of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France.\nHis Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back.\nAva Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings.\nOn Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war.\n‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales.\n“It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.”\nCoogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums.\n“The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.”\nLt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled.\n“I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said.\nShe noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out.\nOnce they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away.\nAlthough there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called.\n“I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.”\nA car wreck took her 3 kids. Now through surrogacy, she is a mom again to a baby boy. A Georgia family was about to lose insurance for teen's cancer battle. Then they got help. Pedaling kindness: Massachusetts Peloton group leaves servers $7,200 tip 'Feed somebody you don’t know': Philadelphia man inspires, heals through food Why strangers raised $450,000 to help a dependable Burger King worker buy his first home Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York.\nLt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, online records show.\nFay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life.\n“He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said.\nOnce Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost.\n“He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.”\nIt ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said.\n“That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",

    "title": "Worker Dies in Yau Ma Tei Cargo Accident; Labour Department Launches Investigation",
    "text": "Labour Department highly concerned about fatal work accident that happened in Yau Ma Tei today The Labour Department (LD) is highly concerned about a fatal work accident that happened at a Cargo Working Area in Yau Ma Tei this afternoon (September 12), in which a male worker was pressed by an overturned cargo while assisting in unloading it. He was certified dead later in hospital. The LD is saddened by the death of the worker and expresses its deepest sympathy to his family. The LD's spokesman said, \"We commenced an immediate on-site investigation as soon as we were notified of the accident and have issued a suspension notice to the employer concerned, suspending the unloading and handling of cargos at the workplace concerned. The employer cannot resume the work process until the LD is satisfied that suitable measures to abate the relevant risks have been taken.\" The spokesman added, \"We will complete the investigation as soon as possible to identify the cause of the accident, ascertain the liability of the duty holders and recommend improvement measures. We will take actions pursuant to the law if there is any violation of the work safety legislation.\" To prevent employees from being pressed by the cargos while handling them, the LD reminds employers and occupiers of premises to take suitable safety measures, including selection of suitable mechanical aids and methods to support the cargos to ensure their stability. The general duty provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance require employers to provide safe working environments, plant and systems of work for their employees. Those who contravene the relevant provisions are liable to a maximum fine of $10 million and imprisonment for two years on conviction on indictment; or $3 million and imprisonment for six months on summary conviction. In regard to today's accident, the LD will issue a Work Safety Alert through its mobile application \"OSH 2.0\", website and email, giving a brief account of the accident concerned to duty holders, workers' unions, professional bodies of safety practitioners and others, and reminding the industry of the importance of following safety precautionary measures to prevent a recurrence of similar accidents. The LD will also remind the employer concerned of the liability for employees' compensation under the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, assist family members of the deceased to claim employees' compensation and closely follow up on the case. For those with financial difficulties, the LD will assist them to apply for appropriate emergency funds. Subject to the needs and wishes of family members of the deceased, the LD will also liaise with the Social Welfare Department for financial or other assistance. For the sake of securing the safety and health of employees at work, the LD appeals to employers to provide plant and systems of work that are safe and without risks to health. Employees should co-operate with their employers, adopt all safety measures and use personal protective equipment provided properly to avoid endangering their own work safety and that of other workers.

    "text": "- XRP funding rates’ decline suggests rising caution among investors as the crypto market correction extends.\n- Spot traders have managed to soak up the selling pressure with net outflows across Binance, OKX, Kraken and Bybit.\n- XRP could decline to find support near $2.17 after posting a double-top pattern in the recent market decline.\nRipple's XRP declined 4% on Friday following a decline in its funding rates. The remittance-based token could decline to test the $2.17 support level if the crypto market decline extends.\nXRP funding rates decline as spot traders attempt to weather selling pressure\nXRP's funding rate briefly flipped negative in the past 24 hours and is well below the stable 0.01% level following the extended decline in the crypto market, per Coinglass data.\nXRP Funding Rates. Source: Coinglass\nFunding rates are periodic payments between crypto futures traders to help keep the price of a derivatives contract close to its underlying asset's spot price. When funding rates are negative, it suggests rising bearish pressure and short traders pay a fee to long traders — and vice versa when funding rates are positive.\nAdditionally, XRP's open interest has remained at elevated levels since seeing a spike on Monday.\nThe recent XRP funding rates decline to 0.03% with open interest remaining at high levels, suggests a cautioned optimism among traders as bearish sentiments have continued to prevail in the market. Conversely, markets often rebound when funding rates decline below normal levels during bullish seasons.\nThis partially explains why XRP spot traders are buying the dip, with exchanges like Binance, OKX, Kraken and Bybit seeing net outflows. Net outflows in crypto exchanges indicate rising buying pressure.\nXRP Exchange Net Flows. Source: Coinglass\nMeanwhile, Ripple's President Monica Long has stated in an interview with Bloomberg Crypto that the firm's RLUSD stablecoin will expand into prominent exchanges in 2025, with Bitstamp as the latest to support the token. She also expressed that an XRP ETF could be next in line after Bitcoin and Ether ETFs launched last year.\nXRP could test the $2.17 support after posting a double-top pattern\nRipple's XRP sustained $11.76 million in futures liquidations in the past 24 hours, per Coinglass data. The total amount of liquidated long positions crossed $9.54 million, while short liquidations were $2.22 million.\nXRP formed a double top pattern after two rejections at the upper boundary of a pennant, subsequently falling below the $2.33 support level. Consequently, the remittance-focused token may decline further to find support around $2.17.\nXRP/USDT 8-hour chart\nIf XRP extends the decline and breaks below $2.17, it could bounce off the lower boundary support of the pennant. However, a move below the pennant and the support level at $1.96 will validate a rounding top pattern that could send XRP toward $1.71 — a level obtained by measuring the pattern's height and projecting it downward.\nOn the upside, XRP could rally to test the $2.90 resistance if it sustains a candlestick close above the pennant.\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Stochastic Oscillator (Stoch) are below their neutral levels, indicating dominant bearish momentum.\nA daily candlestick above $2.90 will invalidate the thesis.\nRipple FAQs\nRipple is a payments company that specializes in cross-border remittance. The company does this by leveraging blockchain technology. RippleNet is a network used for payments transfer created by Ripple Labs Inc. and is open to financial institutions worldwide. The company also leverages the XRP token.\nXRP is the native token of the decentralized blockchain XRPLedger. The token is used by Ripple Labs to facilitate transactions on the XRPLedger, helping financial institutions transfer value in a borderless manner. XRP therefore facilitates trustless and instant payments on the XRPLedger chain, helping financial firms save on the cost of transacting worldwide.\nXRPLedger is based on a distributed ledger technology and the blockchain using XRP to power transactions. The ledger is different from other blockchains as it has a built-in inflammatory protocol that helps fight spam and distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attacks. The XRPL is maintained by a peer-to-peer network known as the global XRP Ledger community.\nXRP uses the interledger standard. This is a blockchain protocol that aids payments across different networks. For instance, XRP’s blockchain can connect the ledgers of two or more banks. This effectively removes intermediaries and the need for centralization in the system. XRP acts as the native token of the XRPLedger blockchain engineered by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto and David Schwartz.\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

    "title": "Luz verde a una ampliación más rápida de las líneas eléctricas - MarketScreener",
    "text": "BERLÍN (dpa-AFX) - Para seguir avanzando en la transición energética, las redes eléctricas se ampliarán más rápidamente. El Bundestag dio luz verde a ello el viernes con una enmienda a la ley. De este modo, se adelantará la ampliación de dos líneas eléctricas que deben transportar electricidad verde del norte de Alemania al sur. En concreto, se trata de nueve líneas, que ahora se incluirán en el Plan Federal de Necesidades antes de lo previsto y, por tanto, se construirán más rápidamente. El momento exacto en que podrá comenzar la construcción dependerá de los planes de la Agencia Federal de Redes y de los operadores de los sistemas de transmisión. Sin embargo, la decisión del Bundestag significa que la ampliación podrá comenzar lo antes posible.\nLa electricidad llegará más rápidamente al sur y al oeste\nLa enmienda que ahora se ha aprobado afecta a nueve autopistas de la electricidad que están previstas como cables subterráneos, explicó el político del SPD especializado en energía Markus Hümpfer en el Bundestag. Forman parte del llamado Enlace Noreste, que transporta electricidad de Schleswig-Holstein a Mecklemburgo-Pomerania Occidental, y del Enlace Rin-Meno. El Enlace Rin-Meno está destinado a transportar mejor la electricidad de Baja Sajonia al sur en el futuro.\nLos costes para los clientes de electricidad podrían aumentar\nSegún el proyecto de ley, la ampliación de las líneas costará unos 47.000 millones de euros. También podría aumentar los costes de la electricidad para los consumidores. Según el proyecto, las tarifas de red, que se repercuten a todos los clientes de electricidad, aumentarán en unos 80 euros netos al año como consecuencia de las inversiones. Sin embargo, la política del Partido Verde Ingrid Nestle cree que este efecto se verá compensado por la reducción de costes en otros ámbitos. \"Todos nos beneficiaremos enormemente de la ampliación de la red\", declaró Nestle a la agencia de noticias dpa. Los costes adicionales debidos a las tarifas de la red se compensarían con ahorros, ya que las nuevas líneas reducirían los cuellos de botella energéticos y limitarían el uso de \"costosas centrales eléctricas de combustibles fósiles\". La mayoría de los hogares -especialmente los de rentas bajas- no se verán afectados por el aumento, aseguró.\nLukas Kohler, líder adjunto del grupo parlamentario del FDP, también cree que la ampliación de la red dará lugar a \"precios favorables\" a largo plazo para garantizar un suministro eléctrico seguro.\nAdemás de las nuevas líneas eléctricas, el Bundestag debía tratar el viernes otros cambios legislativos para la expansión de las energías renovables. Por ejemplo, se iban a debatir las normas generales para la transposición a la legislación nacional de la correspondiente directiva de la UE. Sin embargo, según el Ministerio Federal de Economía, este asunto se ha pospuesto a una \"fecha posterior\"./faa/DP/mis\nComparte Acceder al artículo original .\nAviso legal Aviso legal\nPóngase en contacto con nosotros para cualquier solicitud de corrección\nVolver © dpa-AFX - 2024",

    "title": "F-22 Raptor: Upgrades That Will Make You Think Again",
    "text": "Think The F-22 Raptor is Old News? These Upgrades Will Make You Think Again\nThe Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor is a single-seat, twin-engine, all-weather stealth tactical fighter aircraft developed for the United States Air Force (USAF). It is considered to be one of the most advanced and capable fighter aircraft in the world, and has been in service since 2005.\nDespite its age, the F-22 Raptor is constantly being upgraded with new weapons and technologies to ensure that it remains the dominant fighter in the skies. In recent years, the USAF and Lockheed Martin have been working on a number of upgrades to the F-22, including:\nNew weapons: The F-22 has been equipped with a number of new weapons, including the AIM-9X Sidewinder air-to-air missile, the AIM-120D Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM), and the GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb (SDB). Wider targeting envelope: The F-22’s targeting envelope has been expanded, allowing it to engage targets at longer ranges and from a wider variety of angles. Improved networking technology: The F-22 has been equipped with new networking technology that enables improved, real-time “collaborative targeting” between aircraft. These upgrades have significantly enhanced the F-22’s capabilities, and ensure that it will remain a formidable force in the skies for many years to come.\nHere are some additional details about the F-22 Raptor’s recent upgrades:\nAIM-9X Sidewinder: The AIM-9X Sidewinder is a short-range, heat-seeking air-to-air missile that is used by the F-22 Raptor. It is the latest in a series of Sidewinder missiles that have been in service since the 1950s. The AIM-9X is a highly maneuverable missile that can be used against targets at close range. AIM-120D AMRAAM: The AIM-120D AMRAAM is a medium-range, air-to-air missile that is used by the F-22 Raptor. It is the latest in a series of AMRAAM missiles that have been in service since the 1980s. The AIM-120D is a highly accurate missile that can be used against targets at long range. GBU-39 SDB: The GBU-39 SDB is a small, precision-guided bomb that is used by the F-22 Raptor. It is a lightweight bomb that can be carried in large numbers by the F-22. The GBU-39 SDB is a highly accurate bomb that can be used against targets on the ground. Wider targeting envelope: The F-22 Raptor’s targeting envelope has been expanded by 30%, allowing it to engage targets at longer ranges and from a wider variety of angles. This is a significant improvement that gives the F-22 a greater advantage in combat. Improved networking technology: The F-22 Raptor has been equipped with new networking technology that enables improved, real-time “collaborative targeting” between aircraft. This allows the F-22 to share targeting data with other aircraft, which can then attack the same target simultaneously. This is a major improvement that makes the F-22 more effective in combat. The F-22 Raptor is a truly remarkable aircraft that has been designed to dominate the skies. With its advanced weapons, wide targeting envelope, and improved networking technology, the F-22 is sure to remain a formidable force in the skies for many years to come.",

    "text": "Cómo dirige la UME desde su cuartel general los despliegues en emergencias\nDesde el centro de coordinación gestiona las peticiones de ayuda de las autoridades civiles, decide los medios y efectivos a desplegar y contacta con los responsables en el terreno\nLas fuertes lluvias en varios puntos del sur y este de España por la depresión aislada en niveles altos (DANA) derivó este martes 29 de octubre en unas graves inundaciones que ya el miércoles 30 reveló las consecuencias más dramáticas. Al cierre de esta edición se habían confirmado 95 personas muertas por las riadas.\nEsta catástrofe natural llevó a las comunidades autónomas afectadas a movilizar a los distintos servicios de emergencias. La Generalitat Valenciana solicitó al Gobierno de España la activación de la Unidad Militar de Emergencias (UME) para que los militares se desplegaran en los municipios de la provincia de Valencia más castigados, y auxiliaran a las personas afectadas.\nYa por la mañana del miércoles había más de mil efectivos de la UME, pero también del Ejército de Tierra y del Ejército del Aire desplegados en distintos puntos de las provincias afectadas. De la UME participaron en los trabajos no sólo militares del Tercer Batallón de Intervención en Emergencias (BIEM III), con sede en Bétera (Valencia), que fueron los primeros en desplegarse, sino también de los batallones de Torrejón de Ardoz, Madrid (BIEM I), de Zaragoza (BIEM IV), de San Andrés de Rabanedo en León (BIEM V)...\nDesde la base aérea de Gando (Gran Canaria), el rey Felipe contactó con el Cuartel General de la UME, con el batallón de Valencia y con los puestos avanzados de los destacamentos desplegados en varias zonas afectadas, para conocer de primera mano la situación.\nLa imagen desde el Cuartel General de la UME, en la base aérea de Torrejón de Ardoz, mostraba la “sala de conducción” (así aparecía rotulada), el centro desde el que la Unidad Militar de Emergencias dirige los despliegues de sus militares.\nSe trata de una sala muy similar a la que existe, por ejemplo, en el Mando de Operaciones, en ese caso en la base Retamares (Pozuelo de Alarcón, Madrid). El Mando de Operaciones cuenta con uno de esos centros para conducir las operaciones de las Fuerzas Armadas en las misiones en el exterior, y la UME dirige los despliegues en emergencias en España.\nLa sala, escalonada en sentido descendente, dispone de una serie de puestos de trabajo que los ocupan distintos militares destinados en distintas funciones dentro del cuartel general, según las necesidades del momento.\nEn ese lugar se coordinan las actuaciones de la UME cuando esta unidad es requerida.\nLa legislación contempla distintas formas de activación de la UME para intervenir en catástrofes y situaciones de emergencia de tipo civil. En las inundaciones de estos días, como se ha indicado, gobiernos autonómicos como el Consell de la Generalitat Valenciana, tomaron la iniciativa de solicitar la intervención de la UME.\nEstas solicitudes siguen una vía que pasa por las delegaciones del Gobierno, la Dirección General de Protección Civil y Emergencias del Ministerio del Interior y llega al Ministerio de Defensa, concretamente a la Dirección General de Política de Defensa (Digenpol), que tiene encomendadas las relaciones con las autoridades civiles.\nDe esa dirección general, la petición de ayuda llega al Cuartel General de la UME, que siempre tiene un grupo de militares activados para recibir este tipo de alertas. Se activa el centro de mando o coordinación, el mismo desde el que el segundo general jefe de la UME explicó al rey el despliegue por estas riadas.\nEsté al frente al general jefe de la UME -actualmente el teniente general Javier Marcos Izquierdo- u otro mando, se encarga de coordinar al resto de militares en la activación de los medios de que dispone repartidos en distintas unidades.\nDe acuerdo con el catálogo de capacidades humanas y materiales de esas unidades, se decide la activación de unas u otras. La UME cuenta con unidades con capacidad de salir en muy corto tiempo para intervenir en emergencias: incendios, inundaciones, incidentes en instalaciones nucleares, terremotos...\nExisten cinco batallones de intervención en emergencias en las provincias de Madrid, Sevilla, Valencia, Zaragoza y León, y algunas otras unidades especializadas también en Madrid.\nSegún las necesidades que haya trasladado las autoridades que hayan hecho la petición de auxilio, se activan unas u otras. Desde el centro de coordinación de Torrejón se contacta con las distintas unidades, y se les dan las instrucciones para ponerse en marcha.\nEn la emergencia actual, efectivos y vehículos se trasladaron desde Madrid, León, Zaragoza... hasta Cuenca, Valencia y otras provincias, lo que obligó a organizar el traslado de estos destacamentos.\nLa sala del Cuartel General desde la que se coordinan los desplieguen cuenta con una gran pantalla, como es habitual en este tipo de centros de coordinación, que sobre un mapa permite ver en tiempo real la ubicación de las unidades desplegadas en las zonas de emergencia.\nTambién facilita las comunicaciones por videoconferencia con las unidades de la UME en sus distintas bases, y con los puestos de mando ubicados en las zonas de intervención, ya sean incendios forestales, o en este caso inundaciones.",

    "text": "Nearly 1,000 AXA volunteers engaged in restoration and biodiversity efforts\nHONG KONG , July 5, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- AXA Hong Kong and Macau (\"AXA\") celebrated its \"Week for Good 2024\", AXA's annual global volunteer service campaign dedicated to sustainability. This year, the event centered on water and environment. Around 1,000 employees and financial consultants participated in a series of impactful activities, including coastal cleanup, upcycling workshops, which were aimed at raising awareness on the importance of clean water and advocating for the preservation of Hong Kong's marine ecosystem. Timed to coincide with World Environment Day on June 5th , these activities align with AXA's new climate strategy and commitments, reinforcing the company's efforts to combat climate change and enhance clean water and sanitation initiatives.\nAround 300 AXA volunteers, including AXA employees, financial consultants and their families, participated in the coastal cleanup in Shui Hau Wan, successfully clearing over 500kg of waste.\nWater is essential for human existence. As human population continues to grow, fresh water has become a globally scarce resource. Exacerbated by climate change, extreme weather events such as floods, droughts, landslides, and hailstorms present an escalating threat to global water resources. Among all natural disasters, 90% are water-related or have an impact on water resources[1]. By 2030, it is estimated that there will be a 40% deficit[2] in available freshwater resources. To address these challenges, it will require immediate action to educate the current and future generations about preserving this vital resource.",

    "title": "The first trailer of the series «Dune: The Prophecy» — Arrakis and the Sandworms 10,000 Years Before Paul Atrid (premiere date)",
    "text": "HBO has finally announced the release date and released the first full trailer for «Dune: The Prophecy» — prequel to Denis Villeneuve’s films.\nThe series is set 10,000 years before the events of «Dune» and tells the story of the formation of the mystical order of the Bene Gesserit, led by the Harkonnen sisters Vali (Emily Watson) and Tula (Olivia Williams). The cast also includes Mark Strong (Emperor Javikko), Chris Mason (swordmaster Keiran Atrid), Josh Huston (Constantine Corrino), Jodie May (Empress Natalia), Sarah-Sophie Boussnina (Princess Inez) and Travis Fimmel (the mysterious Desmond Hart).\nFrank Herbert has written a total of five sequel novels to «Dune» (the first of which is, «Messiah» already in the works by Denis Villeneuve), while his son Brian, together with Kevin J. Anderson, created a series of prequels after the writer’s death — including «The Order of the Sisters of Dune», which formed the basis of the series «Dune: The Prophecy».\nThe book was adapted for the television version by screenwriters Diane Ademu-John, Leah Benavidez, Jordan Goldberg and Carlito Rodriguez, while the directors were Anna Fester («Lou»), John Cameron («Severance») and Richard J. Lewis («Highly Dangerous»). The series has a long and difficult development history, including numerous showrunner changes and creative reboots: in November 2022, Diane Ademu-John stopped working as a co-creator of the series but remained as an executive producer, and in 2023, director Eugene Rank («Chernobyl») and one of the main roles, actress Shirley Henderson, left the project. Eventually, Alison Schapker became the showrunner.\nThe series «Dune: The» Prophecy will debut on HBO with the first episode on November 17 (probably also on Megogo MEGOGO is the exclusive partner of Warner Bros. Discovery's exclusive partner for HBO and Max in Ukraine with Ukrainian dubbing) — the rest of the six episodes will be released every Sunday.",
