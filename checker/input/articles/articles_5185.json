    "text": "By WV Daily News ,\n1 hours ago SOUTH CHARLESTON, W.Va. (WVDN) — Gov. Jim Justice announced today that the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources (WVDNR) has reported the state’s ninth record catch of the year — a blue catfish reeled in by an Indiana angler on the Ohio River in September.\n“With record-breaking catch after record-breaking catch, it’s no surprise that West Virginia’s world-class fishing continues to attract anglers from all over,” said Gov. Jim Justice. “I want to congratulate Kimberly Feltner on this amazing catch. It’s yet another example of why folks love coming to West Virginia to fish.”\nKimberly Feltner of Madison, Ind., caught the 50.82-inch, 64.15-pound blue catfish at the R.C. Byrd Pool on the Ohio River using cut mooneye bait. She was accompanied by local fishing guide Chris Souders. WVDNR Apple Grove Hatchery Manager Ryan Bosserman certified the record-breaking catch. Feltner’s catch surpasses the previous length record of 50.7 inches set by Steven Price in 2022. The weight record (69.45 pounds) is still held by Michael John Drake of St. Albans, W.Va.\n“Anglers have broken West Virginia’s blue catfish record multiple times over the last few years, which is a testament to the successful management efforts we’ve implemented,” said WVDNR Director Brett McMillion. “We’re excited to see what other records might be broken as resident and non-resident anglers continue to hear about our waters consistently producing trophy fish.”\nWith this catch, the WVDNR has reported nine record-breaking catches so far in 2024. In August, two anglers fishing together at Woodrum Lake in Jackson County each caught record-breaking black crappie . In July, an angler landed a record-breaking channel catfish in Wayne County. In June, anglers caught a record-breaking black crappie and redear sunfish at Woodrum Lake in Jackson County and Plum Orchard Lake in Fayette County, respectively. In March, an angler caught a record-breaking bowfin on the Ohio River in Mason County. In February, anglers caught record-breaking redbreast sunfish and tiger trout at New Creek Lake in Grant County. To learn more about state fish record categories, visit WVdnr.gov/state-records .\nAll anglers 15 and older must have a West Virginia fishing license, which can be purchased online at WVfish.com. Anglers are reminded that a trout stamp is required when fishing for trout. They are also encouraged to upgrade their fishing experience by opting for a physical license card when they purchase their 2024 fishing license.\nThe post Justice announces record blue catfish on the Ohio River appeared first on West Virginia Daily News .\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "text": "2024-09-13 09:17:31\nFew things have gone right for Boeing over the past five years. By this time tomorrow, the troubled company could add another mess to its growing list of problems: A mass strike by 33,000 workers that could halt aircraft production at America’s biggest exporter and deal a blow to U.S. economy. Boeing workers in Seattle voted 96 percent in favor of strike action, halting production of the company’s best-selling plane at a time when Boeing is grappling with chronic production delays and mounting debt.\nThe first strike of the company’s employees since 2008 will begin at midnight (local time, 10:00 Greek time), weeks after new CEO Kelly Ortberg took over in August to restore confidence in the company after a door was detached from a 737 MAX.\nAbout 30,000 workers who build Boeing’s 737 MAX and other jets in the Seattle and Portland areas were being asked to vote on their first full labor contract in 16 years.\nUnder International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) rules, at least two-thirds of unionized workers had to vote in favor of a strike to go ahead and reject the contract.\nThe agreement with the administration was also rejected Boeing workers voted 96% to strike and 94.6% to reject the deal.\nThe deal included a 25 percent across-the-board wage increase, a $3,000 signing bonus, and a promise to build the next commercial jet in the Seattle area, provided the construction program begins within four years of signing. of the agreement.\nAlthough IAM leadership recommended last Sunday that its members accept the contract, many workers responded angrily, backing the original demand for a 40 percent pay rise and lamenting the loss of an annual bonus.\nOn Wednesday, Ortberg sent a letter to workers urging them to approve the deal.\nSome workers were already preparing that day for picketing. A union member left a meeting Wednesday holding a “Strike Against Boeing” sign under his arm.\nSources: Reuters, AFP, APE-MPE, CNN\nBOEING BOEING 737 MAX STRIKE STRIKE MOVEMENTS USA Share: Share via Facebook Share via Twitter Share via LinkedIn Share via Email\nFollow us on Google News and be the first to know all the news!\nandroid\nFollow us on the official “N” channel on Viber\nFollow us on the official “N” YouTube channel",

    "title": "$750 a month, no questions asked, improved the lives of homeless people",
    "text": "LOS ANGELES — If 100 homeless people were given $750 per month for a year, no questions asked, what would they spend it on?\nThat question was at the core of a controlled study conducted by a San Francisco-based nonprofit and the USC Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work.\nThe results were so promising that the researchers decided to publish results after only six months. The answer: food, 36.6%; housing, 19.5%; transportation, 12.7%; clothing, 11.5%; and health care, 6.2%, leaving only 13.6% uncategorized.\nThose who got the stipend were less likely to be unsheltered after six months and able to meet more of their basic needs than a control group that got no money, and half as likely as the control group to have an episode of being unsheltered.\n“I felt there was enough interest and the initial findings were compelling enough that it was important to get those results out,” said Benjamin Henwood, director of the Center for Homelessness, Housing and Health Equity Research at the Dworak-Peck School, who led the study.\n“It may not be earth-shattering that providing money is going to help meet basic needs, but I do think it dispels this myth that people will use money for illicit purposes,” Henwood said. “We weren’t finding that in the study.”\nAbout 2% of the total went to alcohol, cigarettes and drug expenses — the largest portion of which was cigarettes, Henwood said.\nThe participants submit monthly reports on their spending and are surveyed in more detail quarterly.\nA follow-up report will be published after participants have received the funds for a full year. But Henwood said the main findings were robust enough that they were unlikely to change.\nThe study arose from Miracle Messages, a San Francisco-based nonprofit that sends volunteers to the streets and shelters to befriend homeless people and try to make connections with the loved ones who lost contact with them. Next founder and chief executive Kevin F. Adler started Miracle Friends, matching homeless people to volunteer phone buddies for weekly calls.\nThat evolved into Miracle Money when volunteers began asking Adler whether it was OK to give their buddies a few dollars.\n“You asked me to be a friend to this person, but they don’t know what they’re going to eat tonight,” Adler said they would tell him.\nAdler didn’t think the volunteers should hand out their own money. But the idea of cash support appealed to him.\nAfter a pilot showed promise, Adler got a grant to expand to Los Angeles. He hired two recruiters to canvass homeless shelters. They enlisted more than 200 clients who met the criteria of being at least 18 years old and homeless and expressed interest in having a phone buddy.\nRather than just give money away, Adler hoped to document its effect. He teamed up with Henwood, who devised the controlled study. The participants were divided randomly into two groups. One group of 103 received stipends. The others were told they were on a waiting list.\nAfter six months, only 12% of those who received funds reported being unsheltered at any time in the prior month, a dramatic decrease from 30% at the outset. Those on the waiting list also reported fewer unsheltered episodes, but by a much smaller margin, from 28% to 23%.\nThe cash recipients also said they were better able to meet their basic needs. On a scale of 1 (completely) to 5 (not at all), they dropped from about 3.75 on average to just over 3.25. The control group did not budge from 3.75.\nAmong those receiving the funds, some found permanent housing, even though the money fell far below average rents in the area, Henwood said.\n“It seems like it’s opening up possibilities in different ways,” he said. “They might have a friend or relative that may not be willing to support them completely, but if they have something to contribute that opens up a room.”\nIn other cases, the money created opportunities, even for people who remained unsheltered.\n“I spent a lot of the money on food on the go,” one participant told the researchers. “Simple, cheap things like bean and cheese burritos. I eat on the run while I bike/work for DoorDash. I also bought a membership to REI, so I could get my bike fixed for free.”\n“It’s not a single path forward,” Henwood said. “It’s a lot of resourcefulness and creativity.”\n20 facts about homelessness in the US\n20 facts about homelessness in the US\nAccording to HUD, there were 582,462 people experiencing homelessness in the U.S. in January 2022\nThe U.S. has seen a 0.3% increase in homelessness since 2020\nExperts from HUD believe that resources from the American Rescue Plan directed toward homelessness assistance lessened the impact of COVID-19 on homelessness\nThe end of the federal eviction moratorium in August 2021 made millions of Americans' housing situations more precarious during the long tail of the COVID-19 pandemic\nAs of August 2022, one year after the federal eviction moratorium was lifted, nearly 12% of Americans experienced a rent increase of $250 or more per month\nThe marked increase in rental prices during COVID-19 likely contributed to the recent rise in homelessness\nHUD's Emergency Rental Assistance program received more than 12 million applications for assistance between August 2021 and January 2022\n40% of all people experiencing homelessness in the U.S. during 2022 were unsheltered\nChronic homelessness has increased 15.5% since 2020\nVeteran homelessness has decreased by 11% since 2020 and more than 50% since 2010\nFamily and youth homelessness have both decreased since 2020\n50,767 families with children experienced homelessness in 2022\n6,398 parenting youth taking care of 7,898 children experienced homelessness in 2022, down 13% since 2020\nIn 2022, 37% of people experiencing homelessness identified as Black, while only 12% of the overall U.S. population identifies as Black\nFrom 2020 to 2022, the number of people who identified as Hispanic or Latino who experienced homelessness rose by 8%\nThe number of people who identify as Hispanic and experienced unsheltered homelessness in 2022 rose 16% since 2020",

    "text": "La isla Nyangai en Sierra Leona podría desaparecer en 15 años debido al aumento del nivel del mar (Google Earth)\nLa isla Nyangai, ubicada frente a la costa de Sierra Leona, enfrenta una amenaza inminente de desaparición debido al aumento del nivel del mar. Según informó The Economist, en los últimos diez años, su superficie se redujo drásticamente, pasando de 700 metros de longitud a apenas 90 metros. Este fenómeno ha provocado la pérdida de gran parte de su vegetación, incluidos árboles de mango y coco, que han sido arrasados por olas cada vez más intensas. Los pocos habitantes que permanecen allí se encuentran en un asentamiento reducido, constantemente afectado por las inundaciones.\nPor: Infobae\nA pesar de las adversidades, los residentes de Nyangai mantienen un fuerte vínculo emocional con su hogar y se resisten a abandonarlo. Sin embargo, las proyecciones científicas son desalentadoras: se estima que en aproximadamente 15 años, la isla podría quedar completamente sumergida bajo el agua.\nÁfrica, el continente más vulnerable al cambio climático\nA pesar de que África ha contribuido con solo el 3% de las emisiones globales de dióxido de carbono desde la Revolución Industrial, es una de las regiones más afectadas por el cambio climático. Factores como la pobreza, la falta de infraestructura adecuada y la limitada capacidad de adaptación agravan los impactos de este fenómeno en el continente.\nEl cambio climático está alterando los patrones tradicionales en África, lo que se traduce en sequías más prolongadas, olas de calor extremas y tormentas e inundaciones impredecibles. Estos fenómenos tienen un impacto directo en la agricultura, un sector clave para las economías africanas, aumentando el riesgo de inseguridad alimentaria en diversas regiones.\nAdemás, las costas africanas, como la de Nyangai, son especialmente vulnerables a la erosión y al aumento del nivel del mar, lo que podría desplazar a millones de personas en los próximos años. Esta situación coloca al continente en una paradoja: a pesar de su mínima contribución al calentamiento global, el continente soporta una carga desproporcionada de los costos humanos y económicos asociados al cambio climático.\nPara leer más, pulse aquí .",
