The infected cats died after severe worsening of their illness and subsequently tested positive for Influenza A - a rare result in cats, [officials say.](http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediapubhpdetail.cfm?prid=4901)\nThere have been no human cases of bird flu associated with exposure to these cats yet identified.\nWhile a confirmatory test is pending in these two cases, a nationwide H5 bird flu outbreak has seen other cats infected with the virus after consuming infected raw milk.\nHealth officials say cats may be exposed to H5 bird flu by consuming infected birds or other animals, being in environments contaminated with the virus, and consuming unpasteurized milk from infected cows.\n[Health officials](https://vhttp//publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediapubhpdetail.cfm?prid=4901) encourage residents to avoid consuming raw milk and to not feed it to their pets, including frozen raw milk products.\nSymptoms of H5 bird flu infection in humans include eye redness or discharge, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, diarrhea, vomiting, muscle or body aches, headaches, fatigue, trouble breathing and fever.\nAnyone who has consumed these specific recalled raw milk products and is experiencing symptoms should immediately contact their health care provider or local health department.\nCopyright 2024 Gray Local Media, Inc.

    "text": "Neighbors concerned about trash overflowing from home in Roanoke\nROANOKE, Va. (WDBJ) - Neighbors in Roanoke City are sounding the alarm about a house in their neighborhood that is overflowing with trash, which they say is an eyesore and a health hazard. Neighbors said they’ve been asking the city to take action for two years and reached out to WDBJ7 about the home in the 500 block of McDowell Avenue.\n“The city has said they’re taking them to court. I’m not being funny, but when the grass is overgrown, and they put a notice out, they come and cut the grass. So why couldn’t something be done with this? We’ve called the city’s code enforcement office, we’ve seen people come out, but nothing has ever been done,” said Tei Mann, who lives next door to the property.\nThe property on McDowell Avenue has trash and various items scattered all around the outside of the home. Mann said it’s not only an eyesore; it creates a bad smell and causes some health concerns for people living in the area.\n“It’s just getting worse. It’s on the sidewalks. It’s in the backyard. We’re having rats running through the yard. The neighbor can’t let her dogs out just due to the rats being out in the morning. I have a trampoline, and I can’t even put my children back there just for the fear of the rats,” she said.\nMann said the trash buildup on the property began in April 2023 and has only gotten worse since then, despite neighbors complaining to the homeowner and making calls to the city. She said when it rains, the problem becomes even worse.\n“It smells like mildew. It smells like a giant sock, like you’re sitting inside of a giant dirty gym sock. It’s just getting awful, and you can’t really walk down the sidewalk,” said Mann. “My children can’t ride their bicycles just because they’re going to run over stuff. I walked down through there, and there was kerosene, gas, spilled everywhere, and you wouldn’t even have known it was there if you hadn’t looked down.”\nMann said people driving by will sometimes stop to take pictures of the house.\n“It’s affecting everybody. I feel like it’s bringing the property values down. We just had a new house built across the street, and everybody else’s yards are kept neat. It’s becoming like a tourist attraction for Roanoke City. The city bus will stop and take pictures,” she said.\nMann said the property also attracts unwanted animals.\n“It’s not only just rats, it’s raccoons, it’s possums. We don’t know what else is left, and it’s a safety hazard because you never know what may blow over, if it’s a nail or anything. If it catches fire, my house is gone,” she said.\nThe City of Roanoke has taken legal action against the property owner for failing to comply with the city zoning code, and he has been fined four times over the last year, most recently last week when a judge fined him $1,000.\n“We’ve had the property owner in court as far back as May 2024. At that time, the property owner was found guilty and fined $500 due to non-compliance, a series of really not taking heed to the city’s requests to remove the items,” said Roanoke City Codes Compliance Administrator Jeff White.\nWhite said because the property has continued to violate the city code, the city has continued to pursue legal action against the property owner. The court case against the owner is ongoing and was presented to a grand jury on Monday. It is awaiting indictment.\n“We are staying ready. We are prepared to continue pursuing legal action and do what we are allowed to bring this issue into legal compliance. That may come in the form of the indictment and what unfolds from that decision, and our office working with that assistant commonwealth’s attorney’s office to ensure that we can resolve this issue,” said White.\nWhite said the city’s goal is to get the items removed from the property either by the property owner or by the city itself, depending on the court’s ruling.\n“We want to see those items removed from the property, or because it is outdoor storage, they could keep it, of course, but it would have to be in a fully enclosed building,” said White. “It is possible that at some point nearing the end of this legal pursuit or some time depending on the decision, that yeah, we may be in a position to go in there and actually remove it. But of course, at this point, it is in the court’s hands.”\nWhite thanked the people living in the neighborhood for their patience.\n“They have been extremely patient, and we definitely appreciate that. Anytime you’re dealing with an owner who is non-compliant and is simply not responding to city notices, there is a process, in this case, a legal process, which has to play out fully before we can see a complete resolution to this particular matter,” he said.\nWhite said he encourages concerned neighbors to reach out to the city about the property, and it will gladly communicate where things stand with the legal case.\nCopyright 2025 WDBJ.

    "text": "A woman in her 90s was rescued from beneath the rubble of a collapsed house Saturday in western Japan, five days after a powerful earthquake struck the region and killed more than 126 people. The woman, who has not been identified, had been trapped beneath the first floor of the two-story structure in the town of Suzu after the 7.56 magnitude earthquake rocked the area, The New York Times reported. She was rescued at about 8:20 p.m. local time and was taken to an area hospital, according to the officer of Ishikawa Prefecture. The Japanese newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun reported that the woman was responsive but was believed to be suffering from hypothermia, the BBC reported. On Sunday, a doctor told reporters that the woman was well enough to speak, but her legs were injured, according to CNN . Kume Takanori, a member of the emergency rescue team, told NHK that the woman’s knees had been stuck under furniture between the first and second floor, CNN reported. It took hours to free her, Takanori said. The Times , citing experts, reported that the window for finding survivors after an earthquake is typically three days. It is possible to survive for longer periods, depending on access to water and food, temperatures in the area and the extent of the person’s injuries. The death toll from the earthquake continues to rise, with at least 222 people still reported as missing, according to the newspaper. Wajima city has had the highest number of fatalities, with 69, The Guardian reported. Suzu has 38 deaths. © 2024 Cox Media Group",

La respuesta es clara: a costa del esfuerzo y sacrificio de los trabajadores\".

    "title": "Bélgica convoca al embajador israelí por el bombardeo contra la agencia belga de desarrollo en Gaza",
    "text": "MADRID, 2 Feb. (EUROPA PRESS) - El Gobierno de Bélgica ha anunciado este jueves que ha convocado al embajador israelí en el país para protestar por el bombardeo contra la sede de la Agencia Belga de Cooperación al Desarrollo (Enabel) en la Franja de Gaza, que ha quedado destruida. La ministra de Exteriores belga, Hadja Lahbib, ha afirmado que la convocatoria, realizada junto a la titular de Cooperación al Desarrollo, Caroline Gennez, tiene el objetivo de \"aclararlo todo\". \"Atacar edificios civiles es y sigue siendo totalmente inaceptable\", han subrayado a través de sus respectivos perfiles en la red social X, antes Twitter. El director ejecutivo de Enabel, Jean Van Wetter, ha señalado que el bombardeo de la oficina en Gaza se produjo en la víspera. \"Todos estamos sorprendidos en Enabel. Como agencia gubernamental que trabaja por el bien común en el marco del Derecho Internacional Humanitario, no podemos aceptar esto\", ha aseverado. Poco antes, la vice primera ministra, Petra de Sutter, afirmó que Bruselas mantendrá su financiación a la agencia de la ONU para los refugiados palestinos (UNRWA) después de que cerca de una veintena de gobiernos hayan anulado su financiación por la presunta implicación de varios trabajadores en el ataque del Movimiento de Resistencia Islámica (Hamás) del 7 de octubre. Gennez ya afirmó en la víspera que mantendrán los fondos \"dadas las importantes necesidades humanitarias y la amenaza de hambruna que pesa sobre Gaza\". \"Hay una crisis humanitaria gigantesca, dos millones de personas están atrapadas en la hambruna. La UNRWA es absolutamente necesaria para satisfacer esas necesidades\", manifestó. El Ejército de Israel lanzó su ofensiva contra el enclave palestino tras los ataques de Hamás, que dejaron unos 1.200 muertos y cerca de 240 secuestrados. Las autoridades del enclave, controladas por la milicia, han denunciado hasta ahora más de 27.000 palestinos muertos a causa de la ofensiva israelí, a los que se suman 370 muertos en operaciones de las fuerzas de seguridad y ataques por parte de colonos en Cisjordania y Jerusalén Este.",
