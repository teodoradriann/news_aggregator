    "title": "Hacia la huelga en las ITV de Andalucía: sindicatos y empresa, más distanciados que nunca",
    "text": "Las estaciones de ITV de\nAndalucía tienen previsto iniciar una huelga el próximo 19 de septiembre. Después de los últimos contactos entre la empresa que gestiona el servicio, Veiasa, y los sindicatos, no parece que de momento pueda evitarse.\nUGT y CCOO han informado de que la dirección de Veiasa ha solicitado a la Consejería de Empleo, Empresa y Trabajo Autónomo de la Junta de Andalucía que se autoricen servicios mínimos del 40% del personal los días de convocatoria de huelga, lo que los sindicatos consideran \"una nueva tomadura de pelo de esta dirección, todo por no ver la realidad ni querer reconocer que tiene un serio problema con su plantilla por la huelga convocada por UGT y CCOO\".\nLos sindicatos afirman que “es curioso que se solicite esta medida cuando en pandemia la actividad de Veiasa no fue catalogada como esencial. Ahora estamos a la espera de la decisión que va a tomar la Consejería después de las pertinentes alegaciones de las federaciones de CCOO y UGT”.\nLas secciones sindicales califican que “esta acción de la empresa, como otras de las que también somos conocedores, consigue que la plantilla de Veiasa secunde con más fuerza y contundencia la huelga que se iniciará el día 19 de septiembre”.\nLas centrales sindicales de CCOO y UGT aseguran que seguirán velando para que en todo momento se cumpla con la legislación vigente y el derecho a huelga, por lo que denunciaremos todas las acciones que se alejen de la misma. El próximo lunes, 16 de septiembre, se presentarán las movilizaciones previstas para esta semana en las estaciones de ITV de toda Andalucía.\n\"Tras numerosas reuniones de la mesa negociadora en las que la empresa, lejos de profundizar en las propuestas de CCOO y UGT, se empeña en empeorar las condiciones que actualmente tienen las trabajadoras y trabajadores de Veiasa, los sindicatos comenzarán con una huelga el 19 de septiembre con el único objetivo de conseguir la firma de un IV Convenio Colectivo acorde a la realidad laboral y social de las empleadas y empleados públicos de Andalucía\", inciden CCOO y UGT.",

    "text": "Ulfa faction signs peace accord with Indian govt A tripartite peace agreement was signed yesterday among the Indian government, the Assam state government, and the pro-talks faction of the United Liberation Front of Asom (Ulfa) in Delhi. In the accord, inked in the presence of Indian Home Minister Amit Shah and Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, the Ulfa faction has formally agreed to shun violence, disband the outfit and join mainstream politics. The peace deal with the oldest insurgent group of Assam aims to address issues such as illegal immigration, land rights for indigenous communities, and a financial package for Assam's development, reports NDTV. The Indian government and Assam authorities have been holding negotiations with the Arabinda Rajkhowa-led faction of Ulfa since 2010 after Bangladesh handed over to the Indian authorities Ulfa's chairman Rajkhowa, its armed wing's deputy chief Raju Baruah, and several other top leaders in 2009 in a major gesture of security cooperation with New Delhi. However, the hardline faction of Ulfa (Independent) headed by Paresh Baruah is still not part of the peace process. Baruah reportedly lives along China-Myanmar border. Amit Shah said the agreement marks a \"bright\" day for the future of Assam which for a long time suffered violence and ten thousand people lost their lives due to Ulfa-sponsored violence since 1997. Amit Shah said all the reasonable demands by Ulfa will be met in a time-bound manner, and Ulfa as an organisation will be disbanded. Ulfa was formed in 1979 to establish an independent sovereign state for the indigenous Assamese people. The group began its armed operations in the late 1980s, led by figures such as Paresh Baruah, Arabinda Rajkhowa, and Anup Chetia. It was banned by the Indian government in 1990 for taking part in subversive and violent activities. The Rajkhowa faction joined peace talks with the government on September 3, 2011, after an agreement for suspension of operations was signed between it and central and state governments. Without naming Dhaka's handing over the top leaders of Ulfa, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other senior Indian leaders have time and again recalled Bangladesh's exemplary cooperation in security matters that helped to restore peace in Assam. The Ulfa leader's hand over came after Sheikh Hasina returned to power in 2009.",

    "title": "Have Texas highways now become 'death' roads? Here's what TxDOT fatality data tells us",
    "text": "On Boxing Day, six people, including two children, were killed and three others injured in a two-vehicle crash in Johnson County.\n“Please say a prayer for the families of the deceased and injured. Also, please pray for our Deputies, Troopers and all other first responders working this accident. It’s a devastating scene and very emotional for all involved,” The Johnson County Sheriff’s Office said in a social media post.\nU.S. 67, the site of the wreck, is known for its fatal crashes. With only two lanes, the highway is dangerous to travel on as traffic volumes increase.\n“It’s just constant,” Mac Bone, a business owner in Glen Rose, told the Star-Telegram about the crashes, injuries and fatalities near her home. “It’s death after death after death.”\nHow many fatal crashes have happened on Texas highways?\nThe fatality rate on Texas roadways for 2022 was 1.55 deaths per hundred million vehicle miles traveled, according to the Texas Department of Transportation. This is a 1.99% decrease from 2021.\nTexas experienced a decrease in the number of motor vehicle traffic fatalities in 2022 compared with 2021. The 2022 death toll of 4,481 was a decrease of 0.36% from the 4,497 deaths recorded in 2021. Of those fatalities, 1,702 occurred on highways.\n There were 4,037 fatal crashes in 2022, 1,484 of which happened on highways.\nThe death toll on Texas roadways was much lower just a decade ago, with 1,064 fewer deaths. In 2012, 3,417 deaths were recorded.\nWhat’s causing the fatal crashes in Texas?\nTen people are killed every day on average on roads in Texas.\n“Texans can play a major role in ending fatal crashes with a few simple driving habits: wearing seatbelts, driving the speed limit, not texting or being distracted, and never driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs,” TxDOT says.\nAccording to TxDOT data, the leading cause of fatalities is failing to drive in a single lane, followed by being under the influence of alcohol, and failing to control speed. Unsafe speed, a pedestrian failing to yield right-of-way to a vehicle, being under the influence of drugs, speeding and driver inattention were other common causes.\n©2023 Fort Worth Star-Telegram.

    "title": "Female pastor faces backlash for draping 'un-Christian emblem' over Communion table",
    "text": "A female pastor at an Anglican church in northeast England is facing widespread criticism for placing the trans-inclusive Progress Pride flag on a Communion table.\nSome Anglicans have expressed outrage, stressing that the flag violates canon law and is “not a Christian emblem.”\nSunderland Minster, a Grade II-listed Church of England venue that is part of the progressive advocacy group “Inclusive Church Network,” has been displaying the multicolored banner in its Bede chapel, The Telegraph reported.\nThe Rev. Jacqui Tyson, the associate priest who presides there, posted photographs of the draped altar on social media. “I’m proud to serve in a church that is open to God and open to all. I love these folk and so does God,” she wrote on X.\nSunderland Minster, according to its website, advocates for a welcoming environment that affirms diverse backgrounds, genders and sexual orientations. With the stated motto of “Open to God: Open to All,” it describes itself as “a faithful and lively Christian community” dedicated to building an environment of acceptance.\nThe Rev. Ian Paul, associate minister at St Nic’s in Nottingham, called the flag’s presence on the Communion table “a violation of canon law.”\nThe display, he told The Telegraph, “is not inclusive, but exclusive — it excludes people who do not accept the false claims of transgender ideology.” He added that it also “distorts and misrepresents the purpose of the Communion table,” which, he said, is already open to all individuals regardless of their identity, as they are invited to share in the bread and wine.\nCanon law requires Communion tables to be covered with a plain cloth of white, silk or other suitable material.\nThe gender-critical advocacy group LGB Christians has also denounced the flag. “This distinctly un-Christian emblem should be removed since it is illegal, and utterly alien in the context of Anglican worship,” the group was quoted as saying. “Above all else the Progress flag symbolizes one of the greatest threats to safeguarding and an inducement to betray medical and educational good practice while also being theologically illiterate.”\nIn 2022, St. Nicholas’ Church in Leicester requested permission from the Diocese of Leicester to permanently display the Progress Pride flag on their altar. St. Nicholas’ staff argued that the flag symbolized the redemption of the world by God in Christ, including trans-identified individuals, people of color and the LGBT community through Christ’s Crucifixion, the Daily Mail reported at the time. The church further claimed that the hardships endured by Jesus during His Crucifixion mirrored the struggles faced by LGBTQ-identified individuals.\nIn February 2024, Chancellor Naomi Gyane refused permission for it, saying, “The Progress Pride flag is not a Christian emblem.” She described it as a secular symbol used for a variety of issues and noted that canon law mandates the table remain covered by a suitable cloth, preserving a focus on Jesus’ sacrifice for everyone who approaches the sacrament.",

    "text": "Good (Christian Nationalist) Friday Good Friday this year is an important opportunity to reflect not just on what Jesus Christ accomplished at Calvary, but the many sacrifices that enabled Americans to enjoy the benefits of U.S. citizenship and the “exceptionalism” that non-canceled history and the founding documents of the nation display clearly. For Christians, Christmas celebrates the birth of humanity’s savior. Good Friday commemorates the central event in the history of Christianity and Western civilization: the fulfillment of God’s redemptive plan for humanity, when that baby savior grew to manhood and was publicly misjudged, tortured, and crucified, and then rose again. This horrific tragedy had a silver, awe-inspiring “Good News” lining: Christ conquered not just physical death, but also human sin. The New Woke Religion Christ-hating atheists who place their faith in laughable “real science” embrace a fantastical alternative “faith” in unseen and never scientifically proven Big Bangs and spontaneous incarnation of life from not an omnipotent Designer, but a lifeless mud puddle. C.S. Lewis observed that believing in the Bible may be crazy, but it is much crazier to embrace this alternative faith — and it most certainly is not based in scientific fact. It is “theoretical,” like Critical Race Theory, Gender Theory, Queer Theory, and Climate Warming Theory . These poor souls believe in things unseen — just not in the human soul. This New Age deluded religion has usurped all others, in direct derogation of the First Amendment. Social/climate “justice” unjustly prohibits alternative views as misinformation because it cannot survive the light of truth and critical analysis. This intolerant, demonic cult parades as loving while crushing all individual liberties that dare cross its path. This directly offends the First Amendment, as well as most state constitutions safeguarding religious liberty. It is now the Established Church of the Christ-Hating Age, swapping equality for racist equity, free speech for compelled pronouns and stifling of dissent, equal protections for regressive “equity,” and love of country with hate for everything. The cross of Christ, celebrated joyfully this day, is the path to rescue the Bill Gateses and Klaus Schwabs of the world — and the nation — from their cognitive dissonance. They hiss at “Christian nationalism” because it is such an obvious fact, and because it dares to claim that men are men and women are women — assigned chromosomally by God (ACBG) at birth. It claims that abortion of viable human babies, to be left screaming on a gleaming, sterilized table, is a barbaric abomination (an inconvenient truth clearly acknowledged even by the vaunted unholy scrolls of Roe v. Wade ). It questions the morality of “same-sex” unions. It is anathema to the Establishment of Woke Theocracy . Real Christian Nationalism Today, Americans are told the greatest threat to their nation is “ Christian nationalism .” Yet these lies can never for a moment tarnish the truth of what transpired at the center of history: God became man, to die for man. This radical atonement is taken for granted by those who slander Christ yet enjoy the exceptional benefits of equality and human liberty that were achieved through His death...on Good Friday. This nation is covenantal, a unique pact between God and the young American nation: the fact of Christian nationalism. It infused the faith of Harriet Tubman and Martin Luther King, Jr. It championed the Declaration of Independence: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. ... And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor. This Declaration is itself a direct consequence of Good Friday, that radical intersectionality of Christ the man-god on a rugged cross — justice tempered by grace. The Threat of Anti-Christ Writer and philosopher Oz Guinness describes the fundamental tenets embraced by America’s founders as a triangle, or three-legged stool, constructed upon freedom, faith, and virtue. Without freedom of faith, there can be no virtue, without which there can be no freedom, and so on. All three of these foundational legs are being kicked at, viciously, by those who must be forgiven, for they know not what they do. (That’s Jesus’s appeal to the Father on behalf of those who had crucified Him — Luke 23:34). Should they succeed in their anti-Christian crusade, America’s anarchists and history-cancelers will devour themselves and the nation in the demonic bargain. GK Chesterton was amazed when he visited U.S. shores, proclaiming in What I Saw in America: The Declaration of Independence dogmatically bases all rights on the fact that God created all men equal; and it is right; for if they were not created equal, they were certainly evolved unequal. There is no basis for democracy except in a dogma about the divine origin of man. That is a perfectly simple fact which the modern world will find out more and more to be a fact. Every other basis is a sort of sentimental confusion, full of merely verbal echoes of the older creeds. Those verbal associations are always vain for the vital purpose of constraining the tyrant. Chesterton predicted that if America ever abandoned this creed, it would dissolve the covenantal cement that had bound it together. As Christians celebrate this Good Friday of gratitude and humility before their Creator, they do well to reflect not only upon their own sin, paid for by Christ at the cross, but the collective sin of their increasingly unstable and violent nation. Chesterton warned boldly in 1922: It would be the worst sort of insincerity ... to conclude even so hazy an outline of so great and majestic a matter as the American democratic experiment, without testifying my belief that to this also the same ultimate test will come. So far as that democracy becomes or remains Catholic and Christian, that democracy will remain democratic. In so far as it does not, it will become wildly and wickedly undemocratic. Its rich will riot with a brutal indifference far beyond the feeble feudalism which retains some shadow of responsibility or at least of patronage. Its wage-slaves will either sink into heathen slavery, or seek relief in theories that are destructive not merely in method but in aim; since they are but the negations of the human appetite of property and personality. Let Us Pray Let us pray that Chesterton’s prophecy may be avoided, that the pre-eminence and truth of Christian nationalism will prevail, and that America will spare itself from the consequences of rejecting so noble and great a heritage in favor of lies, hatred, and endless retribution. Social justice is not biblical justice. It contains no mercy. Attorney-farmer John Klar hosts the Small Farm Republic Substack and podcast from his Vermont farm.
