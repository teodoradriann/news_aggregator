    "text": "Un senador de La Libertad Avanza propuso castrar a los violadores: \"Habrá que hablar de cosas incómodas\" El formoseño Francisco Paoltroni quiere incluir esa práctica en la lucha contra los delitos contra la integridad sexual. Los detalles. El Senado comenzó a tratar este jueves la iniciativa para la ampliación del Registro Nacional de Datos Genéticos para investigar delitos contra la integridad sexual, que recibió media sanción en Diputados con algunos cambios, y así volvió a surgir el tema de la castración de personas condenadas por abuso sexual con acceso carnal. \"Tenemos que empezar a hablar de castración. Habrá que hablar de cosas incómodas que nunca se hablaron\", expresó el senador formoseño Francisco Paoltroni, de La Libertad Avanza, que luego aseguró en declaraciones radiales que \"hay que estudiar qué hicieron los países del primer mundo, hay que profundizar en el tema\". \"Es el inicio de un camino que hay que recorrer\", convino el senador de La Libertad Avanza por Formosa. Tras la sanción en Diputados -con algunas modificaciones al proyecto original- el Senado tiene que evaluar cómo sería modificación de la Ley 26.879, que creó en 2013 un registro de datos genéticos de personas condenadas por delitos contra la integridad sexual. La iniciativa actual busca que la Justicia pueda obtener muestras para crear el perfil genético de cualquier persona mayor de 18 años que esté imputada por un delito de abuso sexual agravado (violación), sin que haya condena. La información se guardaría durante un plazo de almacenamiento de cuatro meses. Sólo en el caso de las personas menores de edad sus perfiles genéticos \"sólo podrán ser incorporados si fueron declarados penalmente responsables por la comisión de un delito\", consta en el texto de la iniciativa. El Gobierno celebró la sanción en Diputados por tratarse de una \"medida impulsada por el Poder Ejecutivo y elaborada por el Ministerio de Seguridad de la Nación\", también de La Libertad Avanza. \"Este nuevo sistema incluye el aporte voluntario de familiares de personas en búsqueda, con el objetivo de comparar el perfil genético de un cuerpo o de una persona no identificada con aquellas huellas otorgadas por la familia\", expresaron desde la oficina del Presidente. La iniciativa fue aprobada con 146 votos positivos, 87 rechazos y ocho abstenciones en Diputados, y en el Senado ya tiene adeptos y hasta interesados en profundizar en la materia.

    "text": "Nicole Weider Shares Cancer Update: ‘God is a God of Peace’\nBy Movieguide® Contributor\nFormer Victoria’s Secret model Nicole Weider is asking for prayers for her children amid her cancer diagnosis.\n“I think one of the hardest parts about having a cancer diagnosis is worrying about my kids,” she\nwrote on Instagram. “But I’m trying to remember that God is a God of peace and not of fear! The past couple of nights I haven’t really been able to sleep because it keeps ruminating in my mind.”\n“I want them to see me be strong, courageous and not afraid of having cancer,” she\ncontinued. “Because if I am it won’t be as scary for them. I’ll be heavily relying on Jesus!! Can you also please pray for my kids that even if it gets hard, they will see mommy be strong, and that they feel Jesus’ love also like never before? Your prayers are working. And your kind comments mean SO much to me. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!”\nWhile Weider acknowledges this has been a difficult season, she’s seen her faith grow deeper.\n“If the devil thought giving me stage 4 cancer was going to make me doubt God or question his goodness he picked the wrong girl,” she\nshared. “I feel more close to God now more than ever before. I see His presence and love and little reminders all around me. I don’t know how people walk cancer journeys or serious illnesses without Jesus. That boggles my mind. I am scared- but I know that Jesus is with me.”\nShe also shared how being with family this Christmas helped distract her from the diagnosis.\n“It was such a blessing to spend time with our family for Christmas,” Weider\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/C1YWPguLKgf/. “Besides not feeling well two nights ago I haven’t been dwelling on the thought I have cancer with my family around which has been SO nice!”\nShe\nannounced that she will begin chemo this Friday.\n“I’m SO thankful my first chemo treatment was supposed to be on January 10th, but we prayed and persisted and now thank God it’s this Friday! I can tell my body really needs to fight this cancer now!”\nMovieguide® previously\nreported on Wieder’s diagnosis:\n“It’s so interesting because when I got this stage 4 cancer diagnosis, I really started to have flashbacks of when I was young and growing up, and then why things happened a certain way, and what God had in store instead,” she\nin an Instagram post.\nWeider continued, “Obviously, you don’t know the full plan until you get to heaven but at least in my case I’m really starting to see things from God’s point of view of why things unfolded in my life the way they did.”\nThe former model and actress said she was glad she didn’t make it big in Hollywood the way she planned when she was younger “because if I did, I probably wouldn’t have been married for 12 years with two kids. Wouldn’t have built my whole life centered on Jesus and creating the Christian ministry Project inspired for young women. And now because of that, I have an army of people praying for me!”\n“I feel so loved and encouraged by your prayers and kind messages,” Weider continued. “I don’t know how people go through something like this without God. So thankful Jesus is walking beside me through the unknown valley.”\nWe are a crowdfunded organization, supported by people like you. These are some of the reasons why our supporters choose to give.\n\"I am grateful for the wide range of Entertainment reviews and inside stories with a Christian perspective.\"\nYou can make a difference with as little as $7. It takes only a moment. If you can, consider supporting our ministry with a monthly gift. Thank you.\nMovieguide® is a 501c3 and all donations are tax-deductible.",
