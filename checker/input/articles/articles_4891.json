    "text": "CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Thursday said the deployment of a British warship to waters off the coast of Guyana breaches the \"spirit\" of an agreement reached between Venezuelan and Guyanese authorities. Guyana and Venezuela agreed earlier this month to avoid the use of force and avoid increasing tensions in the long border dispute over the oil-rich Essequibo territory. The 160,000-square-km (62,000-square-mile) Essequibo region is generally recognized as part of Guyana, but in recent years Venezuela has revived its claim to the territory and to offshore areas after major oil and gas discoveries. Royal Navy patrol vessel HMS Trent is visiting Guyana, a British ally and former colony, as part of a series of engagements in the region, the UK's defense ministry said in a statement earlier this month, without referring to Venezuela or the border dispute. \"It is the breaking of the spirit of dialogue, diplomacy and peace of the agreements,\" Maduro said on Thursday. He said the deployment was \"practically a military threat from London.\" Maduro has ordered \"the activation of a joint defensive action of the Bolivarian National Armed Forces\" off the coast of Essequibo, he said in a state televised broadcast, but did not give more information. Military leaders in Venezuela's east said during the broadcast that 5,600 uniformed personnel were ready for the operation. In a statement, Venezuela's Foreign Ministry said the country \"reserves all actions, within the framework of the Constitution and International Law, to defend its maritime and territorial integrity.\" (Reporting by Vivian Sequera and Mayela Armas; Writing by Oliver Griffin; Editing by Leslie Adler)",

    "title": "Hydrangea craze sweeps East Coast due to winter’s strong El Nino | Fox Weather",
    "text": "Gardeners with green thumbs and less experienced alike are noticing something of a remarkable trend: hydrangeas are having a particularly abundant year. Photos from Connecticut, Massachusetts, and other coastal communities show the massive plants blooming with bright colors of white, pink, blue and even purple. According to plant experts, the reason is because of weather conditions during the past winter and spring, which set the stage for a memorable year. \\\"A lot of the hydrangeas set their flower buds during the previous year, so if it’s a mild winter, they don’t lose any flower buds over the winter,\\\" Bill Donnelly, owner of the Behmerwald Nursery, told FOX Weather. The nursery is located outside of Philadelphia and offers dozens of varieties of the plant. Donnelly said that no matter the color, all are seemingly doing well, and it’s a direct response to the weather. WHAT SEASON DO FRUITS AND VEGETABLES GROW IN? A strong El Niño produced the warmest winter on record for the U.S., resulting in fewer freezes and frosts in many Northeastern cities. For example, Boston, which typically experiences its last freeze in early April, saw it occur in March during the winter of 2023-24. Without the impacts of winter weather, flowers did not experience widespread damage, which can alter or even delay growth and flowering. !function(e,n,i,s){var d=\\\"InfogramEmbeds\\\";var o=e.getElementsByTagName(n)[0];if(window[d]&&window[d].initialized)window[d].process&&window[d].process();else if(!e.getElementById(i)){var r=e.createElement(n);r.async=1,r.id=i,r.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,\\\"script\\\",\\\"infogram-async\\\",\\\"https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js\\\"); Additionally, a wet winter and spring, characterized by rain rather than snow showers, ensured that vegetation reached its peak condition for the summer months. A stretch of dry months can also affect the vibrancy of flowering, a challenge growers did not face during the peak season. Hydrangeas are a significant attraction in some parts of the country, where annual festivals celebrate this iconic plant. Cape Cod, Massachusetts, recently wrapped up its more than week-long celebration, where thousands attended and took part in tours, courses and other activities. NATIONAL PICKLE SHORTAGE TIED TO EXTREME WEATHER IN MEXICO Apart from weather conditions, the pH level of the soil is a key factor influencing the colors of hydrangea flowers, ranging from pink to purple and even blue. Soil that is more acidic, characterized by low pH levels, produces colors in the purple and blue range, while soil with higher pH levels tends to produce pink hues. Adjusting the soil's pH is possible, but horticulturists advise conducting thorough research before undertaking the endeavor. \\\"We never recommend people using homemade remedies to change their pH soil level. It is much better to use a commercial product than a homemade remedy,\\\" Donnelly stated. In many regions, the hydrangea flowering season starts to wind down in late summer as the plant prepares for the next cycle. Donnelly said that proper pruning and care are essential during the offseason to ensure the vegetation is as healthy as possible before the winter months and for new blooms in late spring and summer.",

    "text": "“灵魂画师”\n作者 | 本报记者 万景达\n实习生 朱晓岚\n即便已经工作了四年，山东省济南大学城实验学校地理教师袁晓还是经常会趁假期回到山东即墨的农村老家帮农，犁地、浇水、施肥、打药，1997年出生的他样样精通。\n家乡的大沽河和大片农田给了袁晓“最好的地理启蒙”，初二遇到的地理教师王维珍在他参加初中学业水平测试前给了他几本地理辅导资料，仔细研读后袁晓笃定这门学科是他的一生所爱。进入高中后，毫不费力考到90多分的地理成绩印证了热爱的力量，他便义无反顾地将山东师范大学和地理专业写进了志愿填报表。\n这位被央视新闻、《人民日报》等媒体“点名”多次的年轻教师皮肤白皙、穿着入时，放在学生群里很难分辨得出他教师的身份。与年纪不相符的，也是让袁晓走红的，正是他信手拈来画出地理学科中复杂示意图的“教师古典技艺”。\n被称为“灵魂画师”的袁晓在2022年末因为一段短视频爆火，如今在互联网上随便点开一支他上课的短视频，你会看见地球“三圈环流”活灵活现、“水循环示意图”清晰简洁、“板块碰撞与挤压图”流畅明了……“无论时代如何发展，板书、板画和版图都是教师最基本的技能。”袁晓谦虚地告诉记者。\n一切源于袁晓实习时与学生开的一个玩笑。那时的他比高中生大不了几岁，有学生质疑他的教学水平，激将之下，袁晓徒手画出地球圈层示意图，浑然一体的圆圈仿佛借助圆规画出，让在场的学生感到震惊。那时的袁晓还没有意识到自己的独特天赋，直到正式入职后，为提升上课百无聊赖的学生兴趣而绞尽脑汁的他又想到了这一“特长”。再次得到学生的惊叹甚至期待后，袁晓意识到“这或许是个办法”。\n袁晓手绘“水循环示意图”\n事实上，在教学实践中袁晓也发现，如果只用AI制图或课件授课，受制于现有资源和技术，往往不能完整体现出“自己想要的那个教学目的”，仔细调试也需要花费大量时间和精力，得不偿失；用课件教学时，袁晓感觉每堂课都是“知识的狂轰滥炸”，“一股脑地把知识摆在学生面前，他们的脑子一时接受不了”。\n袁晓手绘“海蚀地貌图”\n如何将枯燥抽象的地理知识让学生循序渐进地接受？只追热点、用数字化工具搞噱头行不通，袁晓决定拾起这些“古典技艺”。最初的实践后，他发现课堂效果出奇地好。\n为了达到更好的效果，没有美术功底的袁晓买来很多字帖，每天练习控笔，一年多时间练了8万多字、几百幅图画。不断精进的绘画技艺运用到教学中，孩子听得兴致高涨，上课的“抬头率”更高了。比起单独听讲，动手亲自参与或许更好。袁晓便让学生也跟着他画，帮助他们建立空间感，辅助理解的同时加深对知识的印象。\n图像之外，袁晓还想让孩子看真正的地理。童年的经历给了他灵感，他便把学生带到户外的原野农田、森林小溪，学生跟着他看星星、月亮，了解地球和宇宙，在河流旁了解冲积原理，在山林里学习地质变迁……\n在袁晓的坚持下，“很多孩子就跟开窍一样，上课可以通过眼神与我交流了”，反映到考试中，许多孩子的地理成绩突飞猛涨。\n更有一些学生爱上了这门课，学生张佳璐高考地理考了90多分，因为袁晓的课，高考后她毅然报考了海南大学地理相关专业。\n“她给我的微信备注叫‘得意门生张佳璐’。”袁晓得意地说。\n这让袁晓想起了在山东师范大学求学期间遇到的恩师朱承熙，袁晓现在还与他保持着联系。朱承熙曾在袁晓大三实习时坐公交车到青岛平度看望他，研究生期间给了袁晓许多教学实践方法的帮助，“比如怎么出题、做题、制作课件等技能，还有很多教育教学的思路、方法等，朱老师都会事无巨细地倾囊相授。”对于地理绘图的热爱也是从那时候开始的。\n在袁晓意外走红之后，朱承熙给他推荐了一本《教育哲学》，“如果现阶段你觉得不能持续进步的话，可以看看这种充满哲学思辨的书。”于是袁晓沉下心来看了两个多月，其间没有更新抖音，“收获非常大，朱老师对我的教育理念影响很深”。\n时间回到21年前，小学一年级的袁晓经历了人生第一次期末考试后，自认 “没有拿到好成绩”，但老师还是用端正大气的字体写下“改掉粗心的缺点，你将成为一个出类拔萃的学生”。这句话深深刻在他的脑海中。\n“我从小就碰到了好老师，我也想当一名好老师。”袁晓说。\n感谢阅读\n如果你觉得这篇文章不错的话\n欢迎 【关注】 & 【 星标 】 & 【转发朋友圈】\n来源 | 中国教师报\n视频 | 新华智见\n图片 | 人民日报新媒体\n编辑 | 白衣\n有变化",

    "text": "Deutsche Schulen: Schüler-Vertreter offenbaren „gravierende Missstände“\nEine Sprecherin der Bundesschülerkonferenz beschreibt bei Ippen.Media, woran es in Deutschlands Schulen fehlt - samt Forderungen an Kanzler Friedrich Merz.\nBerlin - Am Dienstag (24. Juni) war es so weit. Die schwarz-rote Bundesregierung aus CDU/CSU und SPD hat ihren Entwurf für den Bundeshaushalt 2025 vorgelegt. Darin sind im Umfeld von Ukraine-Krieg und Russland-Aggression nicht zuletzt immense Verteidigungsausgaben zur Aufrüstung der Bundeswehr enthalten.\nSchulen in Deutschland: Thema Bildung ging im Bundestagswahlkampf unter\nBis zu 95 Milliarden Euro sollen in die deutschen Streitkräfte fließen. Die Verteidigungspolitik war schließlich auch ein zentrales Thema im Wahlkampf zur Bundestagswahl 2025. Ganz im Gegensatz zur Bildung allgemein und zu Schulen im Speziellen. Dabei wird seit Jahren über eklatante Versäumnisse in der Ausstattung deutscher Bildungseinrichtungen berichtet.\nZum Beispiel bei ausreichend und zeitgemäßen digitalen Geräten. Im Umfeld von Bundeshaushalt und schwarz-roten Plänen für Deutschland hat die Sprecherin der Bundesschülerkonferenz auf Anfrage der Frankfurter Rundschau von Ippen.Media jetzt „gravierende Missstände“ benannt. Sie stellt eindringliche Forderungen an die Koalition von Bundeskanzler Friedrich Merz (CDU) und Bundesfinanzminister Lars Klingbeil (SPD).\nBildung in Deutschland: Expertin berichtet von Missständen an deutschen Schulen\n„Die Missstände an deutschen Schulen sind vielerorts gravierend und sie ziehen sich durch nahezu alle Bereiche: Vom akuten Lehrkräftemangel, über unzureichende digitale Infrastruktur bis hin zu baulichen Mängeln, die zum Teil gesundheitsgefährdend sind. Es ist keine Ausnahme, sondern bittere Realität, dass Schülerinnen und Schüler in Räumen mit Schimmelbefall, undichten Fenstern und defekten Böden unterrichtet werden“, erklärt Tilda Skerra – „Wenn überhaupt Lehrkräfte zur Verfügung stehen“. Digitale Endgeräte würden ebenso fehlen wie stabiles WLAN oder zeitgemäße Lernumgebungen, schildert sie.\nSkerra ist Mitglied im Bundessekretariat der Bundesschülerkonferenz (BSK), die sich als Vertretung von Schülerinnen und Schülern der Bildungspolitik in Deutschland annimmt. Und zwar bei Themen von überregionaler Bedeutung. So sollen Anliegen von Schülern und Schülerinnen bundesweit Gehör verschafft werden, während für das Thema Bildung im deutschen Föderalismus vorrangig die Bundesländer zuständig sind.\nEs ist keine Ausnahme, sondern bittere Realität, dass Schüler*innen in Räumen mit Schimmelbefall, undichten Fenstern und defekten Böden unterrichtet werden.\nDie Kulturhoheit der Länder im Bildungsbereich ist im Grundgesetz verankert. Der Bund nimmt durch Fördermittel und Subventionen, etwa bei Bauvorhaben, aber sehr wohl erheblichen Einfluss auf die Bildungspolitik und kann die Länder je nach Gewichtung des Themas bei der Budgetierung erheblich entlasten - oder eben nicht.\nSondervermögen der schwarz-roten Koalition: Schüler-Vertreter fordern viel mehr Geld von Merz\nNach Ansicht von Skerra und ihrer Mitstreiter kommen aus Berlin zu wenige Signale und vor allem zu wenig Geld, um frühere Versäumnisse anzugehen und bestenfalls zu beheben. „Wir fordern, dass mindestens zehn Prozent des geplanten Infrastruktur-Sondervermögens, also rund 50 Milliarden Euro, zweckgebunden in die Sanierung und Modernisierung von Schulen investiert werden“, erklärt Skerra unserer Redaktion. „Darüber hinaus braucht es ein langfristig angelegtes Förderprogramm, das die bauliche, digitale und strukturelle Weiterentwicklung unserer Schulen strategisch begleitet.“\nFerner müsse der schon unter der früheren Ampel-Bundesregierung so bezeichnete „DigitalPakt deutlich aufgestockt und ausgebaut werden, um Bildung endlich nachhaltig im 21. Jahrhundert anzukommen zu lassen“, meint die Expertin. Zu weiteren Forderungen der Bundesschülerkonferenz gehört die Sicherstellung der Finanzierung von verpflichtenden Fort- und Weiterbildungsbereichen, was etwa die Themen „mentale Gesundheit“ und „digitale Lehrformate“ betreffe. Und ein realistischer Betreuungsschlüssel, wie es die BSK-Sprecherin beschreibt: „Mindestens eine Schulsozialarbeiterin oder ein Schulsozialarbeiter auf 300 Schüler*innen und auf 150 Schüler*innen eine Schulpsychologin oder ein Schulpsychologe je Bundesland.“\nLars Klingbeil stellt Bundeshaushalt 2025 vor: Bildungsausgaben steigen leicht\nDas alles gebe es bislang nicht. Die Investitionen in die Bildung, die Vize-Kanzler Klingbeil im Bundeshaushalt 2025 vorstellte, dürften bei den Experten aus dem Bereich jedoch für überschaubare Begeisterung sorgen. Laut Website des Bundesfinanzministeriums entfallen von 488,60 Milliarden Euro aus dem Regierungsentwurf gerade mal 4,57 Prozent auf die Themen Bildung und Forschung - rund 22,31 Milliarden Euro.\nDas ist ein leichter Anstieg. Zum Vergleich: Die gescheiterte Ampel-Bundesregierung hatte für 2024 noch 21,49 Milliarden Euro eingeplant. Laut Bundesfinanzministerium sollen aus dem Sondervermögen zudem insgesamt 6,5 Milliarden Euro in Investitionen für die Kindertagesbetreuung und in die digitale Bildung fließen. In einem Zeitraum bis 2029. Von den geforderten 50 Milliarden Euro der BSK ist das weit entfernt. (pm)",

    "text": "By Tom Puckett ,\n4 hours ago\nBuffalo, N.Y. (WBEN) - Driving in lake effect snow is a challenge for any passenger vehicle, but it was also a challenge for those driving vehicles meant to go through the snow. In fact, Erie County's Department of Public Works Commissioner was stuck while clearing snow from the roads on Thursday.\nBill Geary tells WBEN the Evans/Lake View/Hamburg/Eden area was supposed to see snow rates of 1-to-2 inches an hour, but instead exceeded three inches an hour, and some even localized heavy bursts beyond the three inch an hour rate.\nThat made it a challenge for his crews, especially one driver in particular.\n\"One of our trucks in the dark and low-lit areas got on the side of the road and ended up in the ditch. That really hampered some of our operations,\" said Geary on Thursday. \"We were able to pivot and put another truck on that route to kind of keep up with it.\"\nEven Geary had an adventure himself.\n\"I went down on my way after checking on our driver and the truck that was in the ditch, I proceeded up to Eden-Evans Center Road, going down Route 20, and it was in that time period where you're seeing greater than three inches an hour. I had to avoid a vehicle coming at me,\" Geary said. \"I got over on the shoulder road, not quite in the ditch, but enough that my truck got hung up and stuck for a little while.\"\nGeary says he managed to get himself unstuck.\nBoth Geary and the other driver are OK.\nBe the first to react",

Lagos, Nigeria &#xf00e potret kota Lagos, Nigeria Photo : Joshua Doubek/Wikimedia Baca Juga : 8 Most Air Polluted Cities in the World, Dubai to Malaysia Lagos' low coastline continues to erode, and rising seas caused by global warming put Africa's largest city in danger of flooding.\nA 2012 study from the University of Plymouth found that a sea level rise of three to nine feet would \" have a catastrophic effect on the human activities in these regions.\" Global sea levels are expected to rise 6.6 feet by the end of this century.\n2. Houston, Texas &#xf00e Kota Houston, Amerika Serikat Photo : Businessinsider.com Parts of Houston are sinking at a rate of 2 inches per year due to excessive groundwater pumping.\nThe more Houston sinks, the more vulnerable it becomes to increasingly frequent disasters such as Hurricane Harvey, which damaged nearly 135,000 homes and displaced around 30,000 people.\n3. Dhaka, Bangladesh &#xf00e Ilustrasi Badai Bhola di Bangladesh, pada 1970 Photo : Bangladesh produces 0.3% of the emissions that contribute to climate change, but the country is facing some of the biggest consequences of rising sea levels.\nOceans could flood 17% of Bangladesh's land and displace about 18 million of its citizens by 2050.\n4. Venice, Italy Venice is sinking at a rate of 0.08 inches every year.\nItaly began building a flood barrier consisting of 78 gates across its three inlets in 2003. It's known as Mose. The barrier was supposed to be completed in 2011, but will likely not be ready until 2022.\nWhen a series of storms hit Venice in 2018, the $6.5 billion project was still incomplete. The flooding was the worst the city had seen in a decade.\n5. Virginia Beach, Virginia Virginia Beach has one of the fastest rates of sea-level rising on the East Coast, factoring in both rising water levels and sinking land.\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates that Virginia Beach could experience up to nearly 12 feet of sea level rise by 2100.\n6. Bangkok, Thailand &#xf00e Bangkok, Thailand Photo : huffpost.com Bangkok is sinking at a rate of more than 1 centimeter a year and could be below sea level by 2030, according to The Guardian.\nTo help prevent flooding, especially during Thailand's summer rainy season, an architecture firm built an 11-acre park that can hold up to 1 million gallons of rainwater called Chulalongkorn University Centenary Park.\n7. Jakarta, Indonesia &#xf00e Banjir di Pejaten Jakarta Photo : VIVA/M Ali Wafa Jakarta is sinking up to 6.7 inches per year due to excessive groundwater pumping (which creates a change in pressure and volume that causes the land to sink ). Much of the city could be underwater by 2050.\nThe Indonesian government recently approved a plan to move the capital 100 miles away from its current location on the island of Java in order to protect its 10 million residents from more flooding.\n8. New Orleans, Louisiana Parts of New Orleans are sinking at a rate of 2 inches per year and could be underwater by 2100, according to a 2016 NASA study.\nSome parts of New Orleans are also 15 feet below sea level, and its location on a river delta increases its exposure to sea-level rise and flooding.\n9. Alexandria, Egypt Alexandria's beaches have been disappearing as sea levels continue to rise. The Mediterranean Sea could rise as much as 2 feet by 2100.\n10. Miami, Florida Environmental author Jeff Goodell previously told Business Insider that \" there's virtually no scenario under which you can imagine [Miami] existing at the end of the century\" and referred to it as \"the poster child for a major city in big trouble.\"\nMiami's sea levels are rising at faster rates than in other areas of the world, resulting in floods, contaminated drinking water, and major damage to homes and roads.\nBaca Juga : Halaman Selanjutnya 2.
