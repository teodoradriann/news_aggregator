    "title": "Re: Stuttering Streams in various Apps",
    "text": "Sunday\nWhile using the new Google Streamer connected to a 2022 QLED Samsung TV various Streaming Apps are unwatchable because of constant micro lagging in the stream every few seconds. The audio is fine though. Netflix, Disney+ and Prime Video are affected. Double checked the issue by connecting the Box to a Hisense TV an everything worked fine. Not a HDMI issue. Internet is stable, Lan or WiFi - nothing changes.\nSo the problem seems to be between the TV an the Box.\nGoogle support wasn't able to deliver any useful insights so far.\nMonday\nI have the same issue, also on a Samsung QLED TV. Model QE65QN95AA\nMonday\nI should have added, the TV is also from 2022 and I experienced the same problem on the same TV with a 4k Chromecast. One of the reasons I bought the TV streamer is because I thought that it would fix the issue.\nThe issue does not seem to appear when watching Youtube on the TV via the streamer.\n9m ago\nReturned the box today - I'm not going to spend money on being s beta tester 💁🏻",
