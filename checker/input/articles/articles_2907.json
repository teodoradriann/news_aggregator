    "text": "Emily Levy isn’t surprised.\nNor is MacKenzie Price, Sari Factor or others on the frontlines of K-12 education and the uphill climb to rebound from students’ learning gaps and falling test scores since the COVID-19 pandemic began.\nThe recently released ‘National Report Card’ test scores show 40% of fourth graders don’t have basic reading skills, and 39% of eighth graders are behind in math. The numbers of lagging students are up 6 and 8 percentage points, respectively, since 2019, and the shutdowns and stressors of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSchool kids — across grade levels, demographics, geographies, types of school and economic class — have all seen math and reading test scores slide since before the pandemic.\nIn the 2024 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) tests, no U.S. state saw improvements in eighth-grade math scores from 2019, and only Louisiana saw gains in fourth-grade reading.\nStates such as Oregon, Maryland, Delaware, Washington and Florida saw double-digit drops in some of their test results from before the pandemic.\n“We have definitely seen significant learning loss,” said Levy, founder and director of EBL Coaching, which offers one-on-one tutoring services to kids in New York and New Jersey. “Pretty much from all kids.”\nLevy is especially concerned about learning loss among younger kids from COVID disruptions and post-pandemic hangovers.\n“Those are really when the foundations of learning are established,” Levy said of early elementary grades.\nKids who fall behind — or start behind — can struggle moving forward, she said.\nLevy sees a mixed bag when it comes to school districts and their post-COVID paths. The pandemic started in 2020 and officially ended in 2023.\n“Some schools are really trying to address those learning gaps,” she said. “Others have just continued to move forward” with their usual instruction approaches and pace, Levy said.\nThat’s problematic, and can be rooted in bureaucratic cultures and classroom teachers having too many students and not enough time to address individual students’ learning challenges.\nNhon Ma, CEO and co-founder of education technology startup Numerade, said it’s not just the NAEP test where U.S. students are struggling.\n“We are seeing STEM scores at 30-year lows. COVID certainly had lots to do with this. This in addition to the flood of AI inundating students with easily accessible answers over the past two-plus years,” Nhon said.\n“We are 27 points lower since prior to the pandemic on the average math performance on the international TIMSS exam. This is a tragic reality we must face head-on as a nation,” he said, referring to the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study.\n‘A BIG PAIN POINT’\nSari Factor, chief strategy officer for Imagine Learning LLC, an education technology firm that offers online learning curriculums to schools, said students fell behind, on average, more than four months with all the disruptions and stresses of COVID.\n“It’s a big pain point for all of us,” she said.\nShe said school districts and teachers weren’t really equipped to transfer over to online instruction during the pandemic, and now need to look at ways to catch up, such as high-dosage tutoring and more individualized instruction approaches.\n“Nobody was set up to Zoom school,” Factor said of districts, classroom teachers and populations of stu-dents who might not have had adequate internet or technology access at home.\nFactor said younger kids aren’t as equipped to learn online as their older counterparts.\n“For kids in (kindergarten through fifth grade), imagine teaching reading over Zoom,” Factor said. “It doesn’t work very well. They also missed the socialization. Learning is a human endeavor.”\nThere are continued scholastic gaps based on wealth and poverty, as well as with “English learners’ versus native speakers. But the post-COVID challenges persist for all students.\n“Both math and reading have really fallen,” said MacKenzie Price, founder of 2HR Learning and Alpha Schools, which offers a more condensed learning model and smaller classrooms at schools in Florida, Texas and California.\nDo you LOVE local news? Get Local News Headlines in your inbox daily.\nPrice said that kids who fall behind early and continue to struggle going forward lose confidence and engagement.\n“Competence breeds confidence,” she said, noting the challenges pre- and post-pandemic faced by kids with learning challenges or coming from underserved or marginalized communities.\n“Traditional schooling does a terrible job of motivating students,” Price said.\n‘URGENT WAKE-UP CALL’\nState school superintendents across the country recognized the test scores as a continued call for action.\n“The drop in eighth-grade reading scores is part of a broader national trend,” said Utah State Superintendent of Public Instruction Sydnee Dickson, who is stepping down from her appointed post in June, referring to her state’s 4 percentage point drop in reading proficiency since 2022 and 6 points since 2019.\n“More children are falling below the proficient level, underscoring the critical need to double down on effective reading interventions and support for our students.”\nIn Wyoming, State Superintendent of Public Instruction Megan Degenfelder, a Republican, noted her state outperformed the national average, stressing a continued focus on third-grade reading proficiency. In a statement, her office noted the post-pandemic need to find best practices for “early literacy instruction” and “growing mental health and behavior issues with students.”\nIn Wisconsin, Democratic State Superintendent of Public Instruction Jill Underly called the new NAEP test scores an “urgent wake-up call” and called for increased state education funding.\nAll this comes as President Donald Trump eyes a potential dismantling of the U.S. Department of Education as part of an austerity push, arguing education should be more at the state and local level, school districts navigate funding streams after federal infusions during COVID, and the teaching profession sees contemporary challenges with burnout and attrition.\n‘SUBSTANTIAL HIT’\nOther educators have seen a decline in reading among students and across society propelled by social media and technology.\n“Reading has taken a substantial hit; kids are, with certain exceptions, just not doing much of it anymore,” said Dan Ulin, CEO of Elite Student Coach, which helps students with their college paths.\nAmy Kirkcaldy, principal admissions counselor at IvyWise, which also helps students with their college plans and academic paths, agrees.\n“They just don’t read books anymore,” she said, pointing to the K-12 preference for electronic books.\nKatrina Gomez, a Florida-based instructor with tutoring service Kumon North America and a former elementary school teacher, said some students have struggled with learning consistency since the pandemic, and post-COVID inflation and economic stresses have challenged families’ ability to pay for tutoring programs.\n“Which can make it difficult for them to commit full to extracurricular learning,” Gomez said.\n‘CRACKING THE CODE’\nJess Reid Sliwerski, CEO of Ignite Reading (which offers one-on-one online tutoring), challenges traditional approaches to reading and reading comprehension. She said as many as 60% of young students need“super explicit instruction, plus lots of repetition.”\n“The brain literally has to be hardwired and almost remapped in order for reading to become an automatic process,” she said. “They need systematic, direct, explicit instruction in what are called foundational reading skills.”\n“The English language is code, and you have to learn how to crack that code,” Sliwerski said.\nUnfortunately, it’s hard for school systems to change their modus operandi.\n“School systems operate like factory models,” said Sli- werski, who sees the need for paradigm shifts and new approaches.\nShe’s not alone.\nNEXT STORY UP — SOLUTIONS.",

    "title": "The Strangelove effect - or how we are hoodwinked into accepting a new world war",
    "text": "The Strangelove effect - or how we are hoodwinked into accepting a new world war 18 April 2014 I watched Dr. Strangelove the other day. I have seen it perhaps a dozen times; it makes sense of senseless news. When Major T.J. 'King' Kong goes \"toe to toe with the Rooskies\" and flies his rogue B52 nuclear bomber to a target in Russia, it's left to General 'Buck' Turgidson to reassure the President. Strike first, says the general, and \"you got no more than 10 to 20 million killed, tops.\" President Merkin Muffley: \"I will not go down in history as the greatest mass-murderer since Adolf Hitler.\" General Turgidson: \"Perhaps it might be better, Mr. President, if you were more concerned with the American people than with your image in the history books.\" The genius of Stanley Kubrick's film is that it accurately represents the cold war's lunacy and dangers. Most of the characters are based on real people and real maniacs. There is no equivalent to Strangelove today, because popular culture is directed almost entirely at our interior lives, as if identity is the moral zeitgeist and true satire is redundant; yet the dangers are the same. The nuclear clock has remained at five minutes to midnight; the same false flags are hoisted above the same targets by the same \"invisible government\", as Edward Bernays, the inventor of public relations, described modern propaganda. In 1964, the year Strangelove was made, \"the missile gap\" was the false flag. In order to build more and bigger nuclear weapons and pursue an undeclared policy of domination, President John Kennedy approved the CIA's propaganda that the Soviet Union was well ahead of the US in the production of Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles. This filled front pages as the \"Russian threat\". In fact, the Americans were so far ahead in the production of ICBMs, the Russians never approached them. The cold war was based largely on this lie. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the US has ringed Russia with military bases, nuclear warplanes and missiles as part of its \"Nato Enlargement Project\". Reneging a US promise to Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in 1990 that Nato would not expand \"one inch to the east\", Nato has all but taken over eastern Europe. In the former Soviet Caucuses, Nato's military build-up is the most extensive since the second world war. In February, the United States mounted one of its proxy \"colour\" coups against the elected government of Ukraine; the shock troops were fascists. For the first time since 1945, a pro-Nazi, openly anti-Semitic party controls key areas of state power in a European capital. No Western European leader has condemned this revival of fascism on the border of Russia. Some 30 million Russians died in the invasion of their country by Hitler's Nazis, who were supported by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, the UPA, responsible for numerous Jewish and Polish massacres. The UPA was the military wing, inspiring today's Svoboda party. Since Washington's putsch in Kiev - and Moscow's inevitable response in Russian Crimea, to protect its Black Sea Fleet - the provocation and isolation of Russia have been inverted in the news to the \"Russian threat\". This is fossilised propaganda. The US Air Force general who runs Nato forces in Europe - General Breedlove, no less - claimed more than two weeks ago to have pictures showing 40,000 Russian troops \"massing\" on the border with Ukraine. So did Colin Powell claim to have pictures of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. What is certain is that Obama's rapacious, reckless coup in Ukraine has ignited a civil war and Vladimir Putin is being lured into a trap. Following a 13-year rampage that began in stricken Afghanistan well after Osama bin Laden had fled, then destroyed Iraq beneath a false flag, then invented a \"nuclear rogue\" in Iran, dispatched Libya to a Hobbesian anarchy and backed jihadists in Syria, the US finally has a new cold war to supplement its worldwide campaign of murder and terror by drone. A Nato Membership Action Plan or MAP - straight from the war room of Strangelove - is General Breedlove's gift to the new dictatorship in Ukraine. \"Rapid Trident\" will put US troops on Ukraine's Russian border and \"Sea Breeze\" will put US warships within sight of Russian ports. At the same time, Nato war games throughout eastern Europe are designed to intimidate Russia. Imagine the response if this madness was reversed and happened on America's borders. Cue General 'Buck' Turgidson. And there is China. On 24 April, President Obama will begin a tour of Asia to promote his \"Pivot to China\". The aim is to convince his \"allies\" in the region, principally Japan, to re-arm and prepare for the eventual possibility of war with China. By 2020, almost two-thirds of all US naval forces in the world will be transferred to the Asia-Pacific area. This is the greatest military concentration in that vast region since the second world war. In an arc extending from Australia to Japan, China will face US missiles and nuclear-armed bombers. A strategic naval base is being built on the Korean island of Jeju less than 400 miles from the Chinese metropolis of Shanghai and the industrial heartland of the only country whose economic power is likely to surpass that of the US. Obama's \"pivot\" is designed to undermine China's influence in its region. It is as if world war has begun by other means. This is not a Strangelove fantasy. Obama's defence secretary, Charles \"Chuck\" Hagel, was in Beijing last week to deliver a menacing warning that China, like Russia, could face isolation and war if it did not bow to US demands. He compared the annexation of Crimea with China's complex territorial dispute with Japan over uninhabited islands in the East China Sea. \"You cannot go around the world,\" said Hagel with a straight face, \"and violate the sovereignty of nations by force, coercion or intimidation\". As for America's massive movement of naval forces and nuclear weapons to Asia, that is \"a sign of the humanitarian assistance the US military can provide\". Obama is currently seeking a greater budget for nuclear weapons than the historical peak during the cold war, the era of Strangelove. The United States is pursuing its longstanding ambition to dominate the Eurasian landmass, stretching from China to Europe: a \"manifest destiny\" made right by might.

    "title": "Charoset: Endlessly customizable way to express Jewish identity | KCRW",
    "text": "Like many diasporic peoples, the movement of Jews all over the globe is reflected in the cuisine. The Eastern European canon most people in the United States are familiar with reflects just a small part of global Jewish cuisine. One really interesting lens with which to view the differences country to country (and even family to family) is the ritual Passover food known as charoset (also haroset or charoses). Charoset is most often a melange of dried and/or fresh fruits plus nuts — all chopped or ground to a paste. The most prevalent story of the paste’s meaning is that it represents the mortar used in the pyramids when the Jews were enslaved in Egypt. The custom of eating charoset is very old, with evidence that it dates to 200 C.E. The mixture of fruits and nuts often has the addition of spices, wine, jam, honey, or fruit molasses. The customization of charoset is nearly endless, and it’s become a wonderful canvas with which to express identity. Typically it is prepared for the seders or Passover ritual dinners, where it is part of the Passover plate of food. It also sits on the table, where it is eaten with matzo as an appetizer or side dish. I’ve chosen three examples of charoset from different traditions: Persian, a Yeminite-Moroccan family mash-up, and my borrowed tradition with Sephardi-Turkish roots. The Persian recipe I’m highlighting is from a woman who came from Iran to Rhode Island, moved to New York, and is now living in Mexico. Ehteram Barcohana, known as Etty, shared her recipe with the Jewish Food Society , a group that archives diasporic family recipes. What I like about this charoset is that she uses the familiar apples, but adds pears for sweetness and texture, as well as dates for the consistency, and bananas which was new for me. She adds a mixture of nuts: walnuts, pecans and pistachios, which each have distinct flavors. She also includes wine to form a “thick, coarse paste that still maintains some crunch.” The Yemenite-Moroccan mash-up charoset comes from Rinat Tzadok, and is in the Jewish Food Society’s new cookbook The Jewish Holiday Table , which is filled with stories and recipes from families all over the world. Her recipe (see below) features walnuts, almonds, hazelnuts, and sesame seeds — along with Medjool dates, wine, honey, cinnamon, and cardamom. Like many charoset recipes, she relies on the food processor to grind the ingredients, but cautions to keep it “uniform but not completely smooth.” She soaks the dates in hot water first for easier processing. The mixture is shaped into one-inch balls for serving, which is a nice touch. My charoset is a tradition borrowed from one of the most talented food stylists, directors, creatives in the business — Victoria Granof. Victoria and I worked together in the very early years of Angeli, where she was the pastry chef. She invited me to an unforgettable Passover dinner cooked by her grandmother, Victoria Rachel. They are Sephardi from Turkey and have been the source of much culinary inspiration for me. My charoset is made with dates, dried apricots, golden raisins, and fresh whole oranges, including the peel. I add pistachios, wine or pomegranate juice, cinnamon, ground coriander, and a hint of cayenne. I like a bit of heat. I choose to grind the ingredients in a grinder that attaches to my stand mixer. I prefer the texture to using a food processor, and find it much easier when making a lot. The oranges are cut up in pieces that will fit through the grinder. The use of the whole fruit, including peel and juice, adds another layer to the mixture and counteracts the cloying sweetness of the dried fruits. Charoset Balls Makes about 3 dozen 1-inch (2.5 cm) balls Ingredients - ½ cup (55 g) raw walnuts - ½ cup (55 g) blanched raw almonds - ⅓ cup (40 g) blanched raw hazelnuts - ¼ cup (30 g) raw sesame seeds - 1 cup (200 g) Medjool dates, pitted - ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon - ¼ teaspoon ground cardamom - ¼ cup (60 ml) sweet red wine - 1 tablespoon honey Instructions - Preheat the oven to 300°F (150°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. - Spread the walnuts, almonds, hazelnuts, and sesame seeds on the baking sheet and toast in the oven, stirring once or twice for even toasting, until aromatic and golden, about 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and set the nuts aside to cool. - Meanwhile, put the dates in a small heatproof bowl, cover with boiling water, and soak for 5 minutes to soften. Drain the dates thoroughly. - Put the dates, walnuts, almonds, hazelnuts, sesame seeds, cinnamon, cardamom, wine, and honey in a food processor and process the mixture until it forms a paste that’s uniform but not completely smooth. If the mixture seems too dry, add up to 1 tablespoon hot water and process a bit more (but you want the mixture to be stiff enough to roll into balls). Transfer the charoset to a bowl, cover tightly, and refrigerate for at least 20 minutes, and up to overnight. - To shape the balls, coat your hands with a bit of neutral oil, scoop up a heaping teaspoon of the mixture, and roll the charoset into 1-inch (2.5 cm) balls. The charoset balls can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. - Arrange the charoset balls on a serving plate and serve at room temperature.",

    "text": "Darina Georgieva, Pharm.D., and her colleagues from the department of pharmaceutical services at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, conducted a retrospective observational study to learn the costs avoided through specialty pharmacist interventions for patients at the Vanderbilt MS Clinic. The study results were published in the Journal of Managed Care and Specialty Pharmacy earlier this month. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, progressive autoimmune disease incurring healthcare costs almost five times higher in patients living with this condition compared to their healthy counterparts. Nearly 25% of these costs are associated with the use of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs), which are prescribed to slow disease progression, prevent relapses, and manage symptoms more effectively. Due to their high costs and complexity of treatment, DMTs are usually dispensed and managed through specialty pharmacies. Some are integrated into MS clinics with specialty pharmacists and technicians embedded into the healthcare ecosystem. These integrated health system specialty pharmacy (HSSP) models have been found to improve therapy adherence and persistence, decrease turnaround time, and increase patient satisfaction. However, it is unclear what impact HSSP pharmacist interventions have on healthcare utilization and cost reductions in patients with MS. Darina Georgieva, Pharm.D., and her colleagues from the department of pharmaceutical services at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, conducted a retrospective observational study to learn the costs avoided through specialty pharmacist interventions for patients at the Vanderbilt MS Clinic. The study results were published in the [Journal of Managed Care and Specialty Pharmacy](https://www.jmcp.org/doi/10.18553/jmcp.2024.30.4.336) earlier this month. The study included patients who received specialty pharmacist interventions at the Vanderbilt MS Clinic between February 1, 2022, and July 31, 2022. Interventions were grouped into the following categories: safety and efficacy monitoring, common side effects and other adverse events, healthcare use, disease-related concerns, drug interactions, lost productivity, medication change, dose change and drug discontinuation. Costs avoided were classified as direct, such as medication or laboratory test costs, or indirect, such as the costs associated with a potential consequence (i.e., self-care, hospital visit, or death). A total of 39 interventions among 38 patients resulted in 50 cost-avoidance opportunities. Of these, 13 were associated with direct costs and 37 involved indirect costs. The total estimated avoided costs for six months ranged from $123,733 to $156,265. Of these amounts, $138,410 was due to direct costs, and $1,890 was associated with indirect costs. The top two categories for direct cost avoidance were safety monitoring (69%) and management of common side effects (23%). Conversely, most indirect cost avoidance resulted from the management of common side effects (57%) followed by safety monitoring (22%). Although more interventions were associated with indirect cost avoidance, a majority of direct cost avoidance interventions (69%) resulted in savings of over $1,000 each. In comparison, 95% of indirect cost avoidance interventions yielded less than $100 in avoided costs per intervention. Most direct cost avoidance interventions were due to pharmacist recommendations to discontinue or change inappropriate therapies, resulting in savings in healthcare utilization. Given these results, the authors conclude that the integrated HSSP model can significantly reduce healthcare spending via pharmacist interventions that prevent inappropriate medication dispensing.

    "text": "Russian Shelling Strikes Ukrainian Settlements: Casualties and Destruction Ensue Russian forces shelled settlements west of Kherson in Ukraine, resulting in one death and one injury. Multiple rocket launcher strikes near Kharkiv caused extensive fire damage and raised concerns of trapped residents. The claims remain unverified, though Russia denies targeting civilians despite significant casualties since the invasion's onset. In a stark reminder of the ongoing conflict, Russian forces repeatedly shelled a settlement west of the Ukrainian-held city of Kherson, leading to one fatality and another person wounded, according to regional governor Vyacheslav Prokudin. Prokudin reported on Telegram that a woman lost her life after Russian forces targeted the village of Tomyna Balka on six separate occasions. The conflict spread beyond Kherson as a Russian multiple rocket launcher strike hit the town of Slatyne, near Ukraine's second largest city, Kharkiv. The attack initiated a fire that engulfed at least six homes, heightening fears of residents trapped under the debris. Vyacheslav Zadorenko, a local official, stated emergency services were tackling the blaze and undertaking rescue efforts. While these reports have not been independently confirmed by Reuters, the violence underscores the perilous conditions in Ukraine. Russia maintains it does not aim at civilians, yet over two and a half years since the invasion began, thousands of lives have been claimed. (With inputs from agencies.)
