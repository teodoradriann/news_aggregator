    "text": "Watch: Plane struggles to land in London amid storm. Credits: BigJetTVLive via CNN\nIt's been a stormy tail end to Christmas for the UK and Ireland, as the countries were hit by Storm Gerrit coming in from the Atlantic on Wednesday (local time), bringing gale force winds and flooding in its wake.\nIt caused havoc for aviation, with flights being cancelled across the countries. Air traffic restrictions saw major delays at Heathrow, with flight cancellations across the UK, including Manchester and Glasgow.\nThe UK's flag carrier British Airways cancelled 13 flights because of the weather. In Ireland, Dublin Airport remained unscathed, though Cork saw four diversions, to Dublin and Shannon.\nPlanes that managed to take off faced an equally difficult fate: trying to land in the storm.\nOne American Airlines flight was caught on camera during a particularly bumpy landing at Heathrow on December 27.\nThe Boeing 777, coming in from LA, was seen wobbling from side to side as it came down, toppling briefly towards the left, before appearing to bounce or \"bunny hop\" on the runway before sticking to terra firma and slowing down. The \"insane\" landing was filmed by Big Jet TV owner Jerry Dyer, who regularly sets up livestreams at airports around the world to watch flights coming in and has a particular soft spot for stormy weather.\nDyer told CNN in 2022 he's drawn to the \"battle\" between man and nature during a storm at an airport.\n\"Whenever there's windy conditions, stormy conditions, I'm always up at Heathrow,\" he said at the time. \"It's a lot more exciting to watch than aircraft just landing down and touching down and all that kind of stuff. It's the battle, isn't it? It's the forces of nature against an alloy tub with wings on it that we built and we have to control it down onto the ground in Mother Nature's winds.\n\"It's a fantastic thing to watch.\"\nHis livestream of Storm Eunice in 2022, in which planes battled to land at Heathrow despite 196 km-per-hour winds battering the UK, captivated the entire country.\nThere were more than 200 severe wind gust reports across the UK and Ireland on Wednesday, with a possible tornado sighting in Stalybridge, Greater Manchester. A level 2 of 3 threat for a severe storm remained for far southeastern Ireland and west-central UK until early Thursday morning, according to the European Storm Forecast Experiment.\nStreaming the AA flight, Dyer's famously enthusiastic commentary noted the air \"vortex\" around the wings as it came in, before lamenting \"oh stop it, stop that\" as the plane bounced down the runway.\n\"How he did not go around I just have no idea,\" he commented.\nDespite the conditions, flight AA134, which had departed LA on December 26, touched down just one minute late - at 11:41am on December 27, according to flight tracker FlightRadar.\nIt then took off again about two hours later, making its way to Dallas, where it landed early. Luckily with a different crew.",

    "text": "PRINCE WILLIAM COUNTY, Va. — Federal prosecutors in Virginia dropped charges against a man they say is an MS-13 gang leader on Wednesday.\nHenrry Josue Villatoro Santos, 24, was charged with unlawful possession of firearms by someone in the country illegally. On March 27, agents with the FBI surrounded his mother’s home in Dale City and used a stun grenade to take Santos into custody.\nIn court, officer Jason Klepec of Immigration and Customs Enforcement said on top of an outstanding administrative immigration warrant, there was also a criminal search warrant.\nInvestigators said they found guns, ammunition, suppressors and signs or marks of MS-13 association in his garage bedroom. In an interview with WUSA9, Santos’ mother denied knowledge of his alleged gang involvement.\nProsecutors dismissed charges without prejudice, meaning they're leaving the door open to charge him again.\nWUSA9 has reached out to federal authorities to ask why charges were dropped. But, we have not heard back at this time.",

    "text": "Who Is Satish Kumar? Lakshmi Narayan Temple Chief Whose House Was Attacked In Canada Satish Kumar is the president of Lakshmi Narayan Mandir, Canada. Satish Kumar is the president of Lakshmi Narayan Mandir in Surrey, Canada. On Friday, at least 14 rounds were fired at his son's residence. This is the third time that the Lakshmi Narayan temple or its members have come under attack from Khalistan supporters. Satish Kumar is the president of Lakshmi Narayan Mandir, Surrey. The attack is seen as a revenge attack over a protest held by the temple against Khalistani Extremist extremists. The counter-protest was organised against Khalistani extremists at this temple last month when they gathered to attack the temple premises. Speaking exclusively to Times Now, Satish Kumar said that the incident happened at his son's house and added that the police are investigating the matter at the moment. When asked about the possible suspect behind the attack, he said that he could not say anything at the moment. Speaking on the connection between this attack and the attack that took place on the temple, he said that it is not related and it could have been extortion. In August, the well-known Hindu temple in Canada’s British Columbia was vandalised with anti-India graffiti, drawing massive outrage within the Indian community. Khalistan referendum posters were also pasted on the main door of the temple at midnight, according to reports.

    "title": "California Announces Special Tribute to San Francisco Giants Legend Willie Mays",
    "text": "It's been a tough year for the San Francisco Giants . Not only have they struggled on the field , but they've also lost several legends off of it, including Hall of Famers Willie Mays and Orlando Cepeda. Mays, who passed away at age 93 on June 18, 2024, was arguably the greatest baseball player of all time. He spent 21 wonderful seasons with the Giants, including their first 15 after they moved from New York to San Francisco in 1958. Fittingly, the state of California is planning a special tribute to Mays in honor of everything he accomplished during his storied career, which included over 3,000 hits and 600 home runs. State legislators have approved a plan to name a portion of Interstate 80 after Mays, specifically the portion of the Bay Bridge that enters San Francisco and leads to Oracle Park. It will be called \"Willie Mays Highway,\" and the new signs will be paid for with private funding. Although Mays never played at Oracle Park, which opened in 2000, he visited plenty of times to watch his godson, Barry Bonds , and has a statue outside the park's main entrance. While Mays first rose to superstardom in New York, the captivating center fielder quickly lived up to the hype in the Bay Area. \"The Say Hey Kid\" helped the Giants win their first pennant after moving west in 1962 and won his second NL MVP award in 1965. He was also a perennial All-Star and 12-time Gold Glove winner. One of the best all-around players who ever lived, Mays routinely dazzled San Franciscans with his amazing catches, daring baserunning, impressive throws and titanic home runs. Between his patented basket catches and his hat constantly flying off, he was always worth the price of admission. Mays is gone now, but his immeasurable impact on the game he loved and the cities he played in will always remain.",

    "text": "Mikel Arteta was crestfallen after Arsenal’s defeat to West Ham (Photo: Amazon Prime)\nMikel Arteta says the technology VAR are using is ‘not good enough’ after West Ham scored a controversial goal in their win over Arsenal.\nThe Gunners missed an opportunity to got top of the Premier League after shockingly losing 2-0 to the Irons at the Emirates on Thursday night.\nTomas Soucek scored the opener before a goal from former Arsenal defender Konstantinos Mavropanos sealed the victory as Mikel Arteta’s side missed numerous chances.\nThere was controversy surrounding Soucek’s strike however, as the ball appeared to go out of play in the build-up but VAR could not rule it out as it could not conclusively prove it had fully crossed the line.\nThe incident echoed Newcastle’s winning goal against Arsenal earlier this season, which had prompted Arteta’s infamous rant on the referees.\nThe manager was far more reserved and measured this time around however, and when asked about the Soucek goal he repeatedly said he hadn’t seen it – reminiscent of legendary Gunners boss Arsene Wenger’s famous ‘I did not see it’ remark.\n‘I haven’t seen it. They’re saying it’s not conclusive from the images they have,’ Arteta said in his post-match press conference.\n‘It’s just a shame that with the technology that we have that we can’t say if it’s clearly in.\n‘The technology that we have at the moment is not good enough to give us that answer so we have to – without that – win the game with the amount of situations that we created in the game.\n‘It’s done, it’s gone and there’s nothing we can do about it now. It is [one of the most frustrating nights of my managerial career]. But it’s football.\n‘Normally when the team generates so much it’s going to win games. That’s the way we’ve done it. Against Brighton, we generated so much and against Liverpool as well, but we score goals in different ways.\n‘We have to make another step in that area to win games more comfortably that’s for sure because today the team deserves to win the game. There’s no question about that.’\nIt was West Ham star Jarrod Bowen who had kept the ball seemingly in play, andeven the forward admitted he had no idea whether it had crossed the line or not.\nJust like Arteta, the England star told Amazon Prime: ‘I haven’t seen it.\n‘It’s difficult because the ball was in the air. It was hard to tell. It would have been easier to tell if it had been on the ground.\n‘It was really important to get the first goal. We’ve won tonight. We need to take one game at a time. It sounds boring but we have to keep getting results.’\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nNever miss a beat throughout the season or transfer window with weekly Arsenal news updates, exclusives and analysis.

    "title": "Met Office New Year's Eve weather warning as Brits told 'travel today' to avoid chaos - Mirror Online",
    "text": "Brits planning New Year's Eve celebrations are being urged to travel today to avoid weather chaos as the Met Office issues new warnings.\nConditions across many parts of the UK could feel close to freezing as the clock strikes midnight.\nThe first weather of 2024 is expected to remain unsettled with further strong winds and heavy rain as the New Year gets started. A yellow weather warning for wind covering parts of Wales and the east of England has been issued and will come into force between 11am on Saturday, December 30 and 3am on Sunday, December 31.\nA spell of strong and gusty winds will move east across England and Wales, bringing some disruption to travel and services, the Met Office has said. Another yellow weather warning, this time for rain, has been issued covering Wales between 10am and 6pm on Saturday, December 30 which may lead to flooding and transport disruption.\nA yellow weather warning for rain will also come into effect at 4am on Saturday, December 30 for Northern Ireland, due to be in force until 11am the same day. The fresh warnings come on the heels of a Storm Gerrit, which caused destruction in parts of the country. Hundreds of homes in Scotland remain without power as the post-storm clean up begins, but electricity bosses are \"very confident\" that the remaining 750 properties will be reconnected today. Thousands of properties in Ceredigion were also without power on yesterday after lightning struck supplies in Wales.\nTrain passengers with tickets for December 31 were told to use them today on Northern rail and warned anyone using the rail service the day after should \"expect disruption\".\nCross Country said their services may be \"subject to last-minute cancellations\" as LNER, Avanti West Coast and London Northwestern Railway told passengers to check before they travel.\nThe Met Office said its Irish counterpart, Met Eireann, could name another storm - Storm Hank - as a \"deep area of low pressure\" pushes strong winds across the Republic of Ireland on Saturday. Meteorologist Alex Burkill said Saturday is going to turn \"wet and windy\" across the UK with a band of \"intense rain\" pushing its way eastwards and north-eastwards to bring a risk of gales and possibly \"severe gales\" in exposed spots.\nIn a forecast video, Mr Burkill said northern areas as well as high ground areas in Scotland are likely to see \"significant snow\", with possibly 10 to 20cm of snow building up on the highest grounds. \"There's a potential for some snow accumulations, even as low as perhaps 100m up, we could see some slushy snow, so likely to see some travel disruption again, because of the wind, the rain and some snow like we've seen over some recent days,\" he said.\nBlustery and showery conditions are set to continue into Sunday, with the heaviest and most frequent rainfall across western parts of the UK. And the mercury is expected to drop on Sunday. Mr Burkill said: \"As we look towards the end of the day on New Year's Eve, and the blustery showery theme does continue, some of those showers should start to ease as we head towards midnight.\n\"So perhaps a bit more drier weather around, some clearer skies but do watch out for those showers and you will also want to wrap up quite warm because although it hasn't been particularly chilly recently, when you factor in those strong blustery winds, it's going to feel close to freezing for many places. So definitely a chilly feel to things as the clock strikes midnight.\"\nNew Year's Day should turn drier for many, particularly across more central southern parts of England and across Scotland with the \"central slice\" of the UK most likely to have showery rain. \"As we look through the rest of the first week of 2024 and at the moment Tuesday looks like it'd be a largely dry day with some fine weather around before the return to something more unsettled - some heavy rain, some strong winds, and that does bring the potential for something a little bit colder and possibly wintry,\" Mr Burkill said.",
