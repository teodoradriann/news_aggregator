    "text": "Do you know what things make a man feel comfortable around you? Men feeling comfortable when they are with a woman can be influenced by various factors. Here are eight things that make a man feel comfortable around you:\nMen tend to feel comfortable when they can share their thoughts, feelings, and experiences with you without fear of judgment. Providing emotional support and listening attentively is key to creating emotional comfort.\nHonesty and sincerity are a strong foundation in a relationship. If men feel that you can speak openly and honestly, it creates a climate where they can feel comfortable doing the same.\nProviding unconditional acceptance and appreciating men for who they are, with their strengths and weaknesses, is an important factor. When they feel fully accepted, it can create feelings of comfort and security.\nRealizing and understanding shared interests, as well as having activities or hobbies that can be enjoyed together, can create strong bonds. Men feel comfortable when they feel there is a deeper connection other than a romantic relationship.\nGiving men space to live their lives, have independence, and trusting them to make their own decisions can create a sense of comfort. Trust is a key element in building healthy relationships.\nA life full of laughter and joy can make the atmosphere lighter. Men often feel comfortable when they can have fun together and share funny moments.\nMen, like\nwomen, often find comfort through touch, physical intimacy, and emotional connection. Maintaining a good balance between these two aspects is important for building a satisfying relationship.

Men feel comfortable when they can talk openly about their needs, hopes and feelings without fear of being judged or misunderstood.\nThose are some of the things that make a man feel comfortable around you. Building a comfortable and mutually supportive relationship involves cooperation from both parties. Awareness of each other’s needs and expectations can help create an environment that supports the development of healthy and sustainable relationships.\n2024-01-07 12:28:40\n#Men #Feel #Comfortable #Sincerely",

    "text": "'Bring back our religion’: Trump vows to support Christians during Nashville speech [Vivian Jones](https://www.tennessean.com/staff/11592672002/vivian-jones/) Former President Donald Trump called on Christians to support his presidential bid, pledging if elected to \"protect God in the public square,\" defend Christian broadcasters and their \"pro-God\" content from censorship, and appoint a task force to fight anti-Christian bias, including federal prosecutions. Trump spoke to an enthusiastic crowd of about 1,500 Thursday evening at a presidential forum at the annual conference of the National Religious Broadcasters at the Gaylord Opryland Resort and Convention Center in Nashville. The [nonprofit’s annual convention is in Music City this week](/story/news/religion/2024/02/22/national-religous-broadcasters-media-summit-defending-faith-in-public-donald-trump-speech/72687839007/). Many in the crowd wore red and white hats with the phrase “Make America Pray Again,” provided by conference sponsor Pray.com, as wild cheers broke out to welcome the former president. “I really believe it’s the biggest thing missing from this country, the biggest thing. We have to bring back our religion. We have to bring back Christianity,” Trump said, prompting a big cheer from the crowd. Despite a tight calendar of court appearances and campaigning, Trump appeared in Nashville with just two days to go before the South Carolina primary. The former president is the frontrunner against former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley in her home state – as he is here in Tennessee. Voters here in the Volunteer State will cast ballots on Super Tuesday on March 5. Early voting is already underway. NRB President Troy Miller said the organization invited all eligible candidates from both parties to participate in the presidential forum, and Trump was the only candidate who was available to attend. The NRB has not endorsed Trump’s presidential bid. Lines for the presidential forum already snaked through the Opryland hotel lobby just after 3 p.m. But Trump, who was scheduled to take the stage around 8 p.m. CT, kept the hyped crowd waiting. The room was far from packed. At about 8:40 p.m., nearly an hour before Trump took the stage, staff urgently began removing hundreds of chairs from the back corner of the room. About 200 empty seats on the far side of the room remained. Before Trump walked on stage, the crowd stood in recognition of “the January 6th hostages,\" referring to those who face federal charges for their role in storming the U.S. Capitol. His speech began at 9:42 p.m. and wrapped shortly before 11 p.m. During his opening comments, Trump blamed the delay on rough weather during his flight. 'We will protect God in our public square' Trump asked the crowd of Christian broadcasters and media to support his bid for the White House, pledging to defend Christians from domestic persecution, censorship, and infringements on their rights. He denounced the [recent convictions of six anti-abortion protesters arrested in 2021 for blockading the entrance to a Mt. Juliet reproductive health clinic where abortions are performed](/story/news/crime/2024/01/30/anti-abortion-protesters-felony-convictions-nashville-blockade/72397522007/). The group is facing up to 10.5 years in prison and fines of more than a quarter-million dollars for their actions. “Let’s call these brave Americans what they really are: persecuted Christians,” Trump said. Meanwhile, Trump accused the Biden administration of “targeting Christian believers” and pledged, if elected again, to appoint a special task force “to rapidly review the cases of every political prisoner.\" “Remember, every communist regime throughout history has tried to stamp out the churches – just like every fascist regime is trying to go up and control them,” he said. “In America, the radical left is trying to do both at the same time.” Trump pledged to establish a new federal task force on “fighting anti-Christian bias.” “Its mission will be to investigate all forms of illegal discrimination, harassment and persecution against Christians in America,” Trump said. “No one will be touching the cross of Christ under the Trump administration,” he added, to a big applause from the crowd. Trump also claimed without evidence that religious broadcasters are “under siege,” pledging if elected to “protect content that is pro-God.” “We will protect God in our public square,\" Trump said. \"I will not allow the media or left wing groups silence you, censor you, discriminate against you, or in any way tell you what you have to say.\" Trump briefly mentioned his multiple criminal indictments, claiming them as political persecution. “I take all these arrows for you and I’m so proud to take them,” he said. “I’m being indicted for you,” outstretching his arms as if on a cross. He touted efforts to support Israel during his presidency, citing his administration’s move to relocate the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem – and pledged to “stand strongly” with Israel – prompting a standing ovation from much of the crowd. During his speech, Trump invited former U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman up on stage to provide remarks. Friedman, who wore a medallion around his neck to remember the more than 100 Israeli hostages still in Hamas captivity, told Trump that the Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel “would not have happened,” had Trump still been in office. The crowd stood cheering several times as Trump rolled through a list of other priorities, including expanding school choice options, abolishing the U. S. Department of Education, securing the southern U.S. border with Mexico, defeating the “toxic force of gender ideology,” keeping “men out of women’s sports,” and “prohibiting child mutilation in all 50 states.” “In the end, we do not answer to bureaucrats in Washington, we answer to God in heaven,” Trump said. ‘He’s one of us’ Those attending were overwhelmingly supportive of the former president, and [ much of the conference carried similar themes as his speech.](/story/news/religion/2024/02/22/national-religous-broadcasters-media-summit-defending-faith-in-public-donald-trump-speech/72687839007/) Fritz Von Tagen, of Washington state, traveled to Nashville for the NRB conference to exhibit his company, which develops backgrounds for virtual reality television. Von Tagen, who was wearing a red MAGA hat and an Israeli flag lapel pin, said he hopes Trump is reelected for the sake of small business owners, like himself. “I want to hear his plan to put our country back together. We’re hurting badly,” Von Tagen told The Tennessean. “Our company really started growing until this last administration. It’s doing well, but not near as well as it would normally.” “There’s a lot more people working now that know nothing about the English language. They can’t speak English,\" Von Tagen added. \"I feel bad that all those illegal people are taking jobs away from the Americans.” Jim Sheldon, of Kentucky, whose company is also exhibiting at NRB, said he was looking forward to hearing directly from the former president with “no spin.” “Trump is just, I think, one of us, really,” Sheldon said. “He’s a billionaire, but he’s one of us.” Vivian Jones covers state politics and government for The Tennessean.

    "text": "New research has revealed that AI chatbots can be easily manipulated to encourage users to reveal even more personal information.\nAI Chatbots that provide human-like interactions are used by millions of people every day, however new research has revealed that they can be easily manipulated to encourage users to reveal even more personal information.\nIntentionally malicious AI chatbots can influence users to reveal up to 12.5 times more of their personal information, a new study by King's College London has found.\nFor the first time, the research shows how conversational AI (CAIs) programmed to deliberately extract data can successfully encourage users to reveal private information using known prompt techniques and psychological tools.\nThe study tested three types of malicious AIs that used different strategies (direct, user-benefit and reciprocal) to encourage disclosure of personal information from users. These were built using 'off the shelf' large language models, including Mistral and two different versions of Llama.\nThe researchers then asked 502 people to test the models, only telling them the goal of the study afterwards.\nThey found that the CAIs using reciprocal strategies to extract information emerged as the most effective, with users having minimal awareness of the privacy risks. This strategy reflects on users' inputs by offering empathetic responses and emotional support, sharing relatable stories from others' experiences, acknowledging and validating user feelings, and being non-judgmental while assuring confidentiality.\nThese findings show the serious risk of bad actors, like scammers, gathering large amounts of personal information from people - without them knowing how or where it might be used.\nLLM-based CAIs are being used across a variety of sectors, from customer service to healthcare, to provide human-like interactions through text or voice.\nHowever, previous research shows these types of models don't keep information secure, a limitation rooted in their architecture and training methods. LLMs typically require extensive training data sets, which often leads to personally identifiable information being memorised by the models.\nThe researchers are keen to emphasise that manipulating these models is not a difficult process. Many companies allow access to the base models underpinning their CAIs and people can easily adjust them without much programming knowledge or experience.\n\"AI chatbots are widespread in many different sectors as they can provide natural and engaging interactions. We already know these models aren't good at protecting information. \"Our study shows that manipulated AI Chatbots could pose an even bigger risk to people's privacy - and unfortunately, it's surprisingly easy to take advantage of.\"\nDr Xiao Zhan, a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Informatics at King's College London\n\"Our study shows that manipulated AI Chatbots could pose an even bigger risk to people's privacy - and unfortunately, it's surprisingly easy to take advantage of.\"\nThese AI chatbots are still relatively novel, which can make people less aware that there might be an ulterior motive to an interaction.\"\nDr William Seymour, a Lecturer in Cybersecurity at King's College London\n\"Our study shows the huge gap between users' awareness of the privacy risks and how they then share information. More needs to be done to help people spot the signs that there might be more to an online conversation than first seems. Regulators and platform providers can also help by doing early audits, being more transparent, and putting tighter rules in place to stop covert data collection.\"\nThe study is being presented for the first time at the 34th USENIX security symposium in Seattle.\nhere.",
