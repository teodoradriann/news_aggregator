    "text": "CMP gets $425 million for Northern Maine power corridor Central Maine Power’s parent company is in line to receive nearly half a billion dollars from the federal government to build a 111-mile power line in Northern Maine. The U.S. Department of Energy award is contingent on Avangrid [winning a state contract to build transmission](https://www.mainepublic.org/business-and-economy/2024-05-14/maine-utility-regulators-are-restarting-the-process-of-building-renewable-energy-in-northern-maine) that connects potential wind farms in Aroostook County to the regional grid. The money is part of the Biden administration’s push to develop new energy sources, said CMP spokesperson Jon Breed. It's one of the biggest federal investments in Maine energy development to date. \"Unlocking new renewable energy in different parts of the country is critical and transmission is the way to do it,\" Breed said. The Maine Public Utilities Commission earlier this year restarted a bidding process to generate and transmit 1.2 megawatts of clean power, called the Northern Maine Renewable Energy Development Program. Regulators [terminated a similar proposal ](https://www.mainepublic.org/environment-and-outdoors/2023-12-21/maine-public-utilities-commission-nixes-aroostook-powerline-contract)last year over concerns about project cost and land impacts. But the $425 million award could help solve the cost issues and Avangrid plans to build on existing power corridors, Breed said. \"At this point we don’t intend to use eminent domain like was discussed previously on the past project we can largely do this with areas we control,\" he said. The award would help cover the cost of building a new substation in Haynesville and a high-capacity transmission line that connects to an existing substation in Pittsfield, according to the energy department's grid deployment office. In a press release, Governor Janet Mills applauded the unprecedented funding that \"has the power to transform the energy future of northern Maine.\" \"By expanding our transmission infrastructure, this investment can make the electric grid more stable and reliable and allow us to harness affordable, clean energy generated right here in our own backyard instead of having to import expensive and harmful fossil fuels from out-of-state,\" Mills said. Maine Public’s Climate Desk is made possible by Androscoggin bank, with additional support from Evergreen Home Performance, Bigelow Laboratory, & Lee Auto Malls.",

In addition to those reports, 329 complaints were received of the blades breaking while in use, according to a [warning issued Thursday](https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2024/BlendJet-Recalls-4-8-Million-BlendJet-2-Portable-Blenders-Due-to-Fire-and-Laceration-Hazards) by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, from which one laceration injury was documented. Consumers also reported $150,000 in property damage as a result of the 17 instances of the units overheating, some resulting in house fires. Nearly 50 cases of minor burns were reported as well. Though the CPSC urges consumers to stop using these blenders immediately, the [company states](https://blendjet.com/safetyandrecall) that BlendJet 2's currently for sale are safe to use and not impacted by this recall.

    "title": "O preço do Bitcoin (BTC) está em terreno instável? Os sinais de mercado refletem padrões que previram a recente queda nas ações da mídia Trump",
    "text": "A distribuição de probabilidade implícita é distorcida para a esquerda, sugerindo expectativas de retração de preços. As ações da Trump Media passaram por uma dinâmica semelhante antes da recente queda de preço. Enquanto o preço do bitcoin (BTC) luta para garantir uma posição acima de US$ 90.000, os desenvolvimentos no mercado de opções listadas na Deribit vinculadas à Criptomoeda se assemelham aos padrões que prenunciaram a recente queda de preço nas ações da mídia Trump.\nO padrão aqui mencionado é a distribuição de probabilidade implícita, representando as expectativas dos Mercados para o preço futuro do ativo subjacente derivadas de preços de opções em diferentes preços de exercício e datas de vencimento. Ela mostra as probabilidades que os traders atribuem ao ativo atingindo diferentes níveis de preço.\nDe acordo com dados rastreados pela plataforma financeira de Cripto BloFin, a distribuição de probabilidade implícita agora mostra um \"deslocamento para a esquerda\", sugerindo que os participantes do mercado veem uma probabilidade maior de o BTC ser negociado a preços mais baixos a partir de agora.\n\"Um indicador típico é a distribuição de probabilidade implícita: seja MSTR, COIN ou opções de BTC da Deribit, a distribuição de probabilidade implícita de diferentes datas de expiração mostrou uma mudança significativa para a esquerda\", disse Griffin Ardern, chefe de negociação de opções e pesquisa na plataforma financeira de Cripto BloFin, ao CoinDesk em um chat do Telegram. \"Parece que os traders têm um consenso implícito de que os preços do BTC e das altcoins ainda estão altos, e mais recuos podem estar a caminho.\"\nArdern acrescentou que uma mudança semelhante para a esquerda foi vista no mercado de opções da DJT, prenunciando a recente queda de preço. O preço das ações caiu pela metade para US$ 27 em pouco mais de duas semanas, de acordo com a plataforma de gráficos TradingView. A DJT subiu para uma alta de US$ 54 no final de outubro, enquanto os Mercados precificavam uma potencial vitória do candidato republicano Donald Trump na eleição dos EUA realizada em 5 de novembro.\nBem, o pró-criptomoedas Trump saiu vitorioso, como esperado, e desde então, o BTC subiu mais de US$ 20.000, chegando à marca de US$ 93.000 em ONE momento.\nNo momento em que este artigo foi escrito, a Criptomoeda foi negociada a US$ 88.100, de acordo com dados do CoinDesk .\nComentários agressivos dos funcionários do Fed apoiam o caso de uma retração de preço sugerida pela distribuição de volatilidade implícita. Na quinta-feira, o presidente Jerome Powell disse que a economia não está enviando nenhum sinal de que precisamos ter pressa para reduzir as taxas, frustrando as esperanças de uma flexibilização mais rápida da liquidez. Desde setembro, o Fed já cortou as taxas em 75 pontos-base, oferecendo sinais otimistas para arriscar ativos.\nDito isso, a maioria dos participantes do mercado continua otimista, fazendo apostas que lucrariam com um possível aumento de preço acima da barreira de US$ 100.000.\nEditado por Parikshit Mishra.\nDisclosure\nObserve que nossa política de privacidade , termos de uso , cookies , e não venda minhas informações pessoais have been updated.\nCoinDesk é uma premiada meio de comunicação que cobre a indústria de criptomoedas.
