    "title": "RECAP: Top-seed Arizona overpowers (9) USC in 21-point win",
    "text": "LAS VEGAS — Thursday's game against 9-seed USC started off as a defensive struggle for Arizona with the score being 19 to 16 with a little over five minutes left in the half. But, the Wildcats' offense started to flow and ended the half with the 28-16 lead.\nThat momentum cared into the second half as the Wildcats opened things up on a 15 to 6 run and that became all she wrote. Arizona went on to win 70-49 over USC advancing to the semi-finals of the Pac-12 Tournament.\nArizona head coach Tommy Lloyd is now 7-0 in his Pac-12 Tournament career and the Wildcats as a team are now 2-1 versus USC on the season in what might be the final meeting between these two programs.\n\"Good win. Just how we liked it. Drew it up perfect. We obviously wanted to establish ourselves defensively, not just because it was USC and how we played last time,\" said Lloyd during his postgame press conference. \"Just because that's what you've got to do this time of year.Our guys came out with a defensive mindset, and offensively we were able to settle into the game. When maybe things weren't coming easy we hung with it. So really proud of them.\"\nAdvertisement Last time against USC, most of the Wildcats' starting lineup struggled against the zone and couldn't find the bottom of the next.\nThings changed the second time around as Arizona's starters scored 38 of the teams 70 points with three of the five scoring in double figures. Leading the starting group was center Oumar Ballo, who recorded yet another double-double with his 10 points and 13 rebounds.\nIt was the Ballo's 17th double-double of the season.\nOn the defensive side of the ball, the Wildcats held the Trojans to just 49 points, which was the lowest an opponent has scored against UA in the history of the conference tournament.\nThe Trojans shot 36% from the field and held USC to 6 of 26 from behind the 3-point line. Plus, the Wildcats forced them into 18 turnovers that resulted into 16 points the other way.\n\"We always try to make an excuse for our defense because we're a good offensive team,\" Lloyd said. \"Guys, two out of the last three years we've been the number one ranked defense in the Pac-12. Do a little research. We're a good defensive team. We're a great defensive team, and we're going to get better.\"\nBut, the real difference in the game for Arizona was points off the bench with 32 points and forward KJ Lewis knocking in 15 points on 6 of 10 shooting from the field.\nMeanwhile, guard Jaden Bradley was a spark with his 12 points on 4 of 4 shooting and snagged three rebounds in the process.\nUSC's bench was able to score just three points a the Trojans had to rely heavily on its starting unit.\n\"It's awesome. They both responded because they didn't play good at SC. And I'm really proud of how they responded, especially in a game like that, with a team switching defenses, playing a lot of zone, said Lloyd.\n\"Maybe they're not players you think traditionally would playgood against the zone, but they were opportunistic. Youfind some in transition, some late in the possession. You\nfind some on the offensive glass.\"\nArizona will await the winner of the Oregon-UCLA game to see who it plays on Friday night in the semifinals of the Pac-12 Tournament.\n> DISCUSS the article with other Arizona fans Inside McKale\n> WATCH the latest videos from GOAZCATS.com and subscribe to our YouTube channel\n> FOLLOW us on Twitter ( @goazcatscom , @MattRMoreno , @THutch1995 )\n> FOLLOW us on Instagram ( @goazcats )\n> LIKE us on Facebook\n> SUBSCRIBE for all the latest Arizona Wildcats team and recruiting news ( subscribe now )\ntrending {{ article.title }} premium-icon\n{{ timeAgo(article.live_at) }}",

    "text": "The unfortunate move follows a previous wave of staff cuts earlier this year, after the newly acquired Activision Blizzard division sought to reduce “areas of overlap.” [cut the roles](https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/microsoft-gaming-layoffs-650-employees-1236141947/) of about 650 workers, roughly 3% of its global workforce. The unfortunate move follows a [previous wave](https://www.awn.com/news/microsoft-layoff-1900-activision-blizzard-xbox-employees) of staff cuts earlier this year, after the [newly acquired](https://www.awn.com/news/its-done-deal-microsofts-activision-blizzard-purchase-approved) Activision Blizzard division sought to reduce “areas of overlap.” “For the past year, our goal has been to minimize disruption while welcoming new teams and enabling them to do their best work,” Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said in an email to staff Thursday. “As part of aligning our post-acquisition team structure and managing our business, we have made the decision to eliminate approximately 650 roles across Microsoft Gaming—mostly corporate and supporting functions—to organize our business for long term success.” Additionally, the Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile team will face both layoffs as well as a shift of staff to other teams. The recently launched Warcraft Rumble team will also be reduced. No titles, devices, studios, or “experiences” will be affected by the layoffs. Exiting U.S. workers will receive packages including severance, healthcare, and outplacement services. International employees will receive different exit packages depending on location.",

    "title": "Obituary: Joe Finnegan, retired High Court president and former Supreme Court judge who had a passion for horse racing and motorcycling",
    "text": "Former President of the High Court and judge of the Supreme Court Joe Finnegan, who has died at the age of 81, had a career in the legal system that covered six decades.\nBorn in Dublin on October 1, 1942, Joseph Gerard Finnegan lived initially at Mourne Road, Drimnagh, before his parents, Gerard and Charlotte, moved the family to Inchicore. He initially attended Synge Street CBS, transferring later as a boarder to St Mary’s College, Dundalk, where he acquired an impressive scholarly record.\nHis father traded at the vegetable markets behind the Four Courts and progressed from having his own stall to supplying other people’s. Accompanying him to the markets helped Finnegan acquire negotiating skills he later applied at a different level as a legal professional.\nFinnegan and Kay Gilligan met at an early stage in 1954. They were only 12 years old at the time and tried, in their late teenage years, to elope together. The couple were married in due course.\nHaving studied law at University College Dublin, Finnegan qualified as a solicitor in 1966, serving as assistant secretary of the Law Society from 1968 to 1973.\nAlthough doing well in that branch of the profession, he opted later for the rather more uncertain life of a barrister, qualifying in 1978 and appointed senior counsel in 1990.\nBarney Quirke SC, who delivered a eulogy for his father-in-law at the funeral in the Church of the Most Holy Redeemer in Bray, believes the career change might have been motivated in part by watching other barristers making a mess of his cases through asking the wrong questions. The move had short-term financial implications, and the family home had to be sold at the time, but in the opinion of his son-in-law: “Honour and duty were not merely words to him. Honour was more important than personal financial gain or advancement.”\nSolicitors moving over to the Law Library might not always have received the warmest of welcomes from other barristers, but this was not the case with Finnegan. He took cases that seemed unwinnable, but scored a victory in a significant number of them and represented, on a pro bono basis, colleagues who had fallen on hard times. Numerous cases he took on were complex in nature and involved novel points of law, but he was frequently successful.\nIn a tribute, solicitor Pól Ó Murchú said: “There are hundreds of solicitors who can tell remarkable stories about Joe as a barrister who, with his common sense and skill as a lawyer, helped their clients to get a positive outcome and helped them get justice.”\nOne of Finnegan’s more high-profile roles as a barrister was representing former Fianna Fáil minister Ray Burke at the Planning Tribunal. In 1991, he was appointed to the High Court Bench, becoming president of the court in 2001, the second-highest ranking judge in Ireland and an ex officio member of the Supreme Court.\n​In June 2005 he presided over proceedings that led to the Rossport Five, as they became known, spending more than 90 days in jail for civil contempt of court. They had refused to obey a temporary court injunction that forbade them from interfering with work being undertaken on the land three of them owned by multinational oil and gas company Shell, which planned to build a high-pressure raw gas pipeline across land in Rossport, Co Mayo, to transfer gas from the offshore Corrib Gas Field.\nIn November 2006, he imposed a €10,000 fine for contempt on a man who reportedly answered “The cat” when the judge asked who was responsible for snorting, apparently in derision, after he had announced a decision to jail another individual in a case before the court.\nSince there was no sign of a cat, Judge Finnegan said: “No one wants to silence you, but there are some things that, in a civilised society, you will not be permitted to do.” He later said he would “revisit” the fine if an apology was received.\nIn December 2006, he moved on to become a full member of the Supreme Court, succeeding Mr Justice Brian McCracken, who had retired earlier in the year. Finnegan himself retired from the court in 2012 and later maintained a mediation practice.\nSocially, he was equally comfortable meeting a world leader or an ordinary individual. He could be completely trusted to keep a professional secret, although he also enjoyed a good gossip on less-sensitive issues. Despite the realities of the law where advocates can be metaphorically at each other’s throats and a judge may have to deliver bad news, Finnegan remained widely popular.\nOn a personal level, he had a passion for motorcycling, and the mass-card at his funeral included a colour photo of him in full biking gear and helmet, heading along a motorway with a broad smile on his face. Finnegan’s wife was frequently a pillion passenger on the bike, and the couple breezed their way through France and Spain, with plenty of adventures along the way.\nA famous episode took place during a visit to northern Spain when he stopped at a service station. A man who looked vaguely familiar was admiring the motorbike and the two of them had a chat and a coffee. Having asked the stranger “So what do you do?”, he suddenly realised this was Spain’s King Juan Carlos I, who reigned from 1975 until his abdication in 2014.\nFinnegan was also a rugby enthusiast and was still playing for the Bar of Ireland team at the age of 56. On the soccer front, he played centre-forward at short notice for St Patrick’s Athletic in a League of Ireland match with Waterford (The Saints were beaten by The Blues on the day).\nHe had a talent for picking winners in horse racing and also served on the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee. Golf was another pastime, and Bray Golf Club hosted a post-funeral reception in his memory.\nHe and Kay owned a yacht for a time, and it ran into serious difficulty at sea at one point, but it all ended happily. He was a great fan of music, literature and art, and, in the words of his son-in-law, “would have preferred to be reading Finnegans Wake than attending it”.\nThree of his grandchildren, Ally, Charlotte and Rosamund Finnegan Quirke, sang at his funeral mass, concluding with a powerful operatic-style rendition of the Everly Brothers number Let it be Me.\nFinnegan became ill in Mallorca last August and was being cared for at the Beacon Hospital, Dublin. He died peacefully on December 16 after a short illness, surrounded by his family.\nHe is survived by his wife, children Gerald, Yvonne, Hazel and Charlotte, grandchildren Joe, Ally, Charlotte, Rosamund and William, sister Marie Bailey and other relatives and friends.\nSenior legal figures attending the mass included Chief Justice Donal O’Donnell, President of the Court of Appeal George Birmingham, President of the High Court David Barniville, Attorney General Rossa Fanning SC and Supreme Court judges Gerard Hogan and Séamus Woulfe.\nOther prominent names included former Chief Justice Ronan Keane, former Supreme Court judge Ms Justice Mary Finlay Geoghegan, president of the Law Reform Commission and former judge of the Supreme Court Ms Justice Mary Laffoy and former attorney general Paul Gallagher SC. President Michael D Higgins was represented by aide de camp Colonel Stephen Howard.\nGet ahead of the day with the morning headlines at 7.30am and Fionnán Sheahan’s exclusive take on the day’s news every afternoon, with our free daily newsletter.",

El edil supervisó junto con la Secretaría de Servicios Públicos y Medio Ambiente los primeros trabajos en el cruce de Jerónimo Treviño y Vasconcelos, en el casco del municipio. “Esto implica pues… los pedazos donde están los baches eliminados. No nos van a tapar el pocito y hacer un trabajo, un tipo de recarpeteo o repavimentación que aquí es un ejemplo, aquí lo pueden apreciar muy bien”. Habrá unidad especializada Fernández destacó que dejará reglamentada la existencia de una Unidad de Pavimentación, que se conformará con expertos certificados conforme a la legislación estatal en materia de pavimentos. Ellos serán los responsables de mantener en óptimas condiciones la carpeta asfáltica. “Vamos a hacer todo un programa para que esto se instituya. No andemos de inventos de alcaldes, de que uno hace una cosa y no le dejan ninguna programación a la siguiente”, detalló Fernández. En muchos temas, añadió, se tiene que hacer una programación que dure varios trienios. “Para darle una repavimentada a todo San Pedro”. Miguel Ángel Ávila Jaime, titular de la Secretaría de Servicios Públicos y Medio Ambiente, explicó que aumentará al doble las cuadrillas de bacheo para atender los reportes de manera más rápida. El repavimento de las calles de San Pedro es uno de los compromisos del alcalde en sus primeros 100 días de gobierno.",
