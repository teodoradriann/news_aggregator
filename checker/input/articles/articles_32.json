    "text": "American tennis star Frances Tiafoe is back in the semifinals of the US Open. The 20rh seeded Tiafoe advanced to the semifinals with a victory over Grigor Dimitrov, who had to stop playing due to injury in the fourth set of their quarterfinal match. Tiafoe led two sets to one and was up 4-1 in the fourth set at the time of the stoppage. It is the second time in three years that Tiafoe has advanced to the semifinal of the US Open. He advanced to the Final Four in 2022 when he was defeated by eventual champion Carlos Alcaraz of Spain. Tiafoe’s opponent in the semifinals will be fellow American Taylor Fritz, who is the No. 12 seed. Fritz defeated No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev in four sets to advance to his first major semifinal. The Tiafoe-Fritz semifinal match will take place on Friday at 2 p.m. at Arthur Ashe Stadium in Flushing Meadows, N.Y. For the first time in 18 years, an American will be guaranteed a spot in the championship of the tournament. Andy Roddick was the last American to play in the semifinals of the US Open in 2006. Tiafoe and Fritz have met seven times in the professional ranks with Fritz holding a 6-1 lead. *Young and Townsend advanced to mixed doubles finals Americans Donald Young and Taylor Townsend have advanced to the championship match of the mixed doubles competition. The Americans will face the Italian team of Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori today at Arthur Ashe Stadium, beginning at 2 p.m. (St. Louis time). Young and Townsend defeated Aldila and Rohan Bopanna in straight sets in the quarterfinals on Tuesday. The US Open is a swan song for Young, 35, who has already announced his retirement from professional tennis. Thursday’s championship match will be his final one as a pro. Young and Townsend were extended a wild card entry into the tournament and they have made the most of it with their run to the championship match. Townsend, 28, is seeking her second Grand Slam championship of the year. In July, she and Daterina Siniakova won the women’s doubles championship at Wimbledon. She has competed in a Grand Slam doubles final in each of the past three years with one title and two runner-up finishes.",

    "text": "8 Plants That Instantly Make Your Apartment Smell Divine\nHouseplants do more than just add a touch of beauty to your home with their colorful flowers and lush foliage. They can also work as natural air fresheners, providing pleasant scents without the need for artificial candles, essential oils, or aerosol sprays. Here are eight of the best-smelling houseplants to fill your home with delightful aromas year-round.\n1. Lavender (Lavandula)\nLavender is a classic favorite among scented plants, known for its calming fragrance and vibrant purple flowers. This hardy herb thrives in sunlight and can withstand cold temperatures, making it a versatile choice for any home. To enjoy its scent long-term, cut the flowers with unopened buds and hang them to dry. Lavender not only freshens your home but can also be used as a natural perfume.\n2. Calamondin Orange (Citrofortunella microcarpa)\nSmall citrus trees, like the Calamondin Orange, emit a wonderful fragrance along with producing tasty fruits. These plants need at least eight hours of sunlight daily, making a south-facing window ideal. If sunlight is scarce, consider using a special grow lamp to meet their needs.\n3. Lemongrass (Melissa officinalis)\nLemongrass is another sun-loving plant that brings a refreshing scent to your home. Its leaves can be used in teas, desserts, and for general air freshening. Place it in a sunny spot to enjoy its aroma and culinary benefits.\n4. Gardenia (Gardenia jasminoides)\nGardenias are known for their exquisite fragrance but are a bit more demanding in terms of care. They prefer cooler environments, indirect sunlight, and humidity. While they might require more attention, the reward is a strong, pleasant fragrance that can fill your home.\n5. Lily of the Valley (Convallaria majalis)\nLily of the Valley produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are highly fragrant. This plant can thrive both indoors and outdoors, making it a versatile option. It's perfect for an east or north-facing windowsill where it can receive indirect sunlight.\n6. Paperwhite Narcissus (Narcissus papyraceus)\nPaperwhite Narcissus is another excellent choice for a fragrant home. Initially, keep the bulbs in a shaded area until they root, then move them to a sunny spot. Keep the soil moist, and soon you'll enjoy its beautiful, scented blooms.\n7. Peppermint (Mentha × piperita)\nPeppermint is a versatile and common plant that can be grown in pots year-round. It prefers sunlight but can also tolerate colder temperatures, ensuring a fresh minty scent throughout the year. It's perfect for adding a refreshing touch to your home.\n8. Eucalyptus (Eucalyptus globulus)\nWhile Eucalyptus doesn't have flowers, it's well-known for its fresh scent, often used in essential oils and candles. This herb thrives in sunlight, so place it in a south-facing window to enjoy its invigorating aroma.\nTips for Maintaining Scented Plants\nTo keep your plants healthy and fragrant:\n- Ensure they get the right amount of sunlight.\n- Water them according to their needs, avoiding overwatering.\n- Provide proper humidity levels for those that require it.\n- Regularly prune and care for them to prevent overgrowth and promote flowering.",

    "text": "‘Somos reciclistadores’: Schwalbe publica su tercer informe de RSE\nLa empresa alemana experta en la fabricación de neumáticos ciclistas Schwalbe, acaba de publicar su tercer informe sobre la responsabilidad social de la empresa (RSE), que ha titulado ‘We are recyclists’ (lo que hemos traducido como ‘Somos reciclistadores’).\nEn él, la empresa presenta de forma transparente los progresos realizados en su camino hacia la responsabilidad social y ecológica. Schwalbe se centra especialmente en la promoción de la economía circular, el aumento constante de atributos respetuosos con el medio ambiente en todos los productos Schwalbe y la ampliación de su diverso compromiso con la justicia social.\nLas cifras 2023, resumidas\n- El 76% de las ventas anuales se generaron con productos respetuosos con el medio ambiente (fabricados con caucho justo, materias primas recicladas y/o renovables).\n- Dos millones de cámaras de bicicleta recicladas en todo el mundo y 550.000 neumáticos de bicicleta reciclados (en agosto de 2024 se alcanzó el millón de forma acumulada)\n- Reducción del 37% de las emisiones de CO2 en la producción (Alcance 1, 2 y 3) desde 2018. Solo el reciclaje de cámaras de aire ahorró 5.683 toneladas de CO2eq en 2023.\n- Cinco proyectos apoyados por el Consejo de la Infancia.\nGrandes proyectos\nUno de los aspectos más destacados de 2023 fue el lanzamiento del Green Marathon, el primer neumático del mundo fabricado, entre otras cosas, con neumáticos usados procedentes del sistema de reciclaje de Schwalbe.\nSchwalbe utiliza ahora negro de humo reciclado (rCB) en el 70% de todos los neumáticos, que es un producto directo del proceso de reciclado y sustituye al negro de humo fabricado a partir de petróleo crudo.\nSchwalbe también avanzó en su proyecto Fair Rubber. La proporción de neumáticos con caucho natural de comercio justo ha aumentado enormemente. A largo plazo, Schwalbe persigue el objetivo de abastecerse al 100% de caucho justo. Además de las comunidades locales y las condiciones de trabajo justas, este compromiso también promueve la cuestión de la biodiversidad. El caucho natural certificado procede de plantaciones selváticas. A diferencia de los monocultivos, este tipo de plantación preserva la elevada biodiversidad natural de la selva. El tema de la biodiversidad siempre ha desempeñado un papel central en Schwalbe: desde hace casi 15 años, la empresa familiar apoya a la Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation, comprometida con la supervivencia de los animales de Borneo y la protección de su hábitat natural en la selva tropical.",

    "text": "Team USA gymnastics star Jordan Chiles has broken her silence after learning she may have to give up the bronze medal she was awarded after finishing third in the floor exercise at the 2024 Paris Olympics.\nMajor controversy has swirled about whether Chiles’ score of 13.766 should be upheld, and the 23-year-old is speaking out about it now.\nChiles posted a lengthy statement on social media, first thanking everyone who has been on her side since the Olympics concluded, especially with the status of her bronze medal being in limbo.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\nChiles then addressed what everyone has been talking about since news broke that the International Olympic Committee has asked her to return her bronze medal after an arbitration court said her coach was too late to fix her score.\n\"While celebrating my Olympic accomplishments, I heard the devastating news that my bronze medal had been stripped away,\" Chiles wrote. \"I had confidence in the appeal brought by (USA Gymnastics), who gave conclusive evidence that my score followed all the rules. This appeal was unsuccessful.\"\nThe Court of Arbitration for Sport, or CAS, ruled that Chiles’ coach was four seconds late to request a review of her score during the floor exercise final. However, the inquiry was accepted, and a further review found Chiles was underscored, and she ended up winning bronze.\nJORDAN CHILES PARIS OLYMPICS BRONZE MEDAL CONTROVERSY IS ‘COMPLETELY DEVASTATING,' US GYMNASTICS GREAT SAYS\nBut the CAS said Chiles’ original score should stand, and the IOC requested she return the medal so Romanian gymnast Ana Bărbosu can be awarded third place. USA gymnastics is fighting that ruling.\n\"I have no words,\" Chiles said. \"This decision feels unjust and comes as a significant blow, not just to me, but to everyone who has championed my journey. To add to the heartbreak, the unprompted racially driven attacks on social media are wrong and extremely hurtful. I’ve poured my heart and soul into this sport and I am so proud to represent my culture and my country.\"\nUSA Gymnastics had noted its continued efforts to fight for Chiles, and it also mentioned having video proof that Chiles’ coach submitted the inquiry within the 47-second time frame that is allowed. However, the court noted in a statement that rules do not allow for a reconsideration of its rulings despite new evidence.\nThere was also word that USA officials were given late notice of the arbitration proceedings, saying the CAS notified the wrong people via email. The U.S. Olympic Committee claims it was given less than 24 hours to prepare for the CAS hearing because of the email error.\nChiles is hoping an ending with her retaining the bronze medal closes this case, and she said she will do everything in her power to \"ensure that justice is done.\"\n\"I will never waver from my values of competing with integrity, striving for excellence, upholding the values of sportsmanship and the rules that dictate fairness,\" she explained. \"I have taken pride in cheering on everyone regardless of team or country. Finding joy again has been a culture shift and I love seeing others embrace it. I feel like I have given everyone permission to be authentic to who they are.\n\"I am now confronted with one of the most challenging moments of my career. Believe me when I say I have had many. I will approach this challenge as I have others – and will make every effort to ensure that justice is done. I believe that at the end of this journey, the people in control will do the right thing.\"\nFox News' Ryan Gaydos contributed to this report.\nFollow Fox News Digital’s sports coverage on X , and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter .",
