    "text": "Exciting Drill Results at CV5 Pegmatite Boost Feasibility Study Plans\nHenry TurnerUpdated: 02-27-2025 05:12 PM\nSignificant Developments at the CV5 Pegmatite\nRecent drilling at the CV5 pegmatite has revealed wide, high-grade intercepts that are set to support the upcoming feasibility study and maiden ore reserve estimates from Patriot Battery Metals Inc. This impressive data comes from their extensive summer and fall 2024 in-fill drill program, which focused on the lithium-rich pegmatite.\nOverview of Drill Results\nHighlights from the program include notable intersections such as 153.8 meters at 2.00% Li2O, comprising a high-grade segment of 55.4 meters at 3.42% Li2O (CV24-733). Other significant intercepts reported are:\n- 142.9 meters at 1.77% Li2O, with highlights of 35.2 meters at 3.36% Li2O (CV24-719).\n- 186.0 meters at 1.08% Li2O, including 11.3 meters at 4.27% Li2O (CV24-704).\n- 129.8 meters at 1.36% Li2O, featuring 22.4 meters at 2.45% Li2O (CV24-688).\n- 142.3 meters at 1.12% Li2O, with a segment of 55.2 meters at 2.19% Li2O (CV24-769).\n- Additional intercepts of 118.4 meters at 1.27% Li2O, 101.9 meters at 1.75% Li2O, and many more are also reported.\nCompletion of the Drill Campaign\nThe recent batch of assay results from 98 drill holes, totaling 31,513 meters, concludes the data collection from a total of 431 holes, which sum up to 128,052 meters. These assays are essential for preparing the feasibility study along with inadequate ore reserve estimates for the CV5 pegmatite, targeted for completion in Q3-2025. The team at Patriot is thrilled to confirm that all necessary resource, geotechnical, and hydrogeological drilling is complete.\nPatriot’s Achievements in Lithium Exploration\nAs of now, Patriot Battery Metals has successfully executed 793 drill holes across the Shaakichiuwaanaan Property, accumulating over 233,884 meters of drilling effort. This makes it possible to claim the largest hard rock lithium resource in the Americas in less than three years, showcasing the company's commitment to innovation and exploration.\nExpert Insights\nDarren L. Smith, Vice President of Exploration at Patriot, expressed optimism regarding the drill program's results. He shared, \"The fall 2024 in-fill drill program at CV5 ended robustly, resulting in over ten well-mineralized intercepts exceeding 100 meters. Achieving this milestone on schedule and under budget demonstrates our team's dedication and efficiency.\" He also mentioned the collaboration with independent consultants, progressing geological models to support the forthcoming mineral resource update.\nMoving Forward: The Road to Feasibility Study\nThe outcomes of these drills not only enhance resource confidence but also lay the groundwork for the feasibility study alongside the maiden ore reserve for the CV5 pegmatite. Mr. Smith emphasized, “Our plans remain on target for Q3-2025, aiming to present a mineral resource update that reflects this exciting phase of development for Patriot Battery Metals.”\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat is the significance of the recent drill results at CV5?\nThe drill results provide critical data necessary for the feasibility study, indicating substantial lithium mineralization, which is crucial for planning future mining activities.\nWhen will the feasibility study results be released?\nThe feasibility study is scheduled for completion in Q3-2025, following the recent drill assessments and data collection.\nHow many drill holes have been completed at CV5?\nA total of 431 drill holes have been executed at CV5, amounting to 128,052 meters of drilling.\nWho is Darren L. Smith?\nDarren L. Smith is the Vice President of Exploration at Patriot Battery Metals, overseeing the exploration and development projects at the CV5 pegmatite and other sites.\nWhat is the next step for Patriot Battery Metals?\nFollowing the completion of drilling, the focus will shift to data analysis and preparing for the feasibility study and ore reserve estimates for the next phases of the CV5 project.\nAbout The Author\nContact Henry Turner privately here.

    "text": "How a club prepares Muslims who fast for the London Marathon Physical exercise can be a tiring experience during the month of Ramadan. But some people have taken up the challenge. Every year, tens of thousands of people put on their running shoes to participate in the 26-mile-long London Marathon. Participants start the run from Greenwich Park and pass by iconic landmarks such as The Tower of London and Big Ben before the marathon concludes in front of Buckingham Palace. Many Muslims are among them. The event is scheduled for April 21 but running enthusiasts started practising weeks ago. For the past couple of years, the marathon season has coincided with Ramadan, the month when Muslims fast from dawn to dusk. To train while fasting has become a challenge. “The motivation is lacking because one's body often feels weak,” says Shazmeen, a 33-year-old doctor, explaining how difficult it is to prepare for the marathon. With its Ramadan Run Club, it is bringing people who fast together so they back each other up with emotional support. “In my other running clubs, not everyone is fasting, so I end up running at a slower pace. However, having a supportive space like this where everyone cheers each other on, and everyone is in the same boat, fasting together, makes a significant difference,” says Shazmeen. “You can't simply use fasting as an excuse for feeling weak because everyone else is fasting alongside you.” Finding the right time Cultural taboos and the fear of getting dehydrated stop people from undertaking physically exhausting exercises during Ramadan. Ramadan Run Club was born to sidestep this issue, says Bilal Hussain, the project lead. During Ramadan, Muslim runners often found themselves training at unusual times. They would train after the night prayers, before dawn meals, before breaking their fast, or between iftar meals and the night prayer. “At such odd times, these runs have sometimes been described as lonely and demotivating, especially if you’re used to running with a group or a club,” Hussain tells TRT World. At the club, participants from diverse backgrounds come together. They include first-time runners, parents making a run post-pregnancy or those trying the marathon in Ramadan for the first time. \"For the past ten years before this one, I hardly engaged in any physical activity during Ramadan because I felt lazy and thought it wasn't feasible,” says Youness, a 30-year-old member of the club. “Now, even though we don't run long distances, I can feel that my body is energised, and it also enhances my spiritual connection.” Experts suggest that people who fast should keep their exercise routine light and brief like walking, Pilates, or yoga. Taking a month-long break from exercise doesn't necessarily cause muscle cells to disappear, but it can lead to a reduction in their size. As building muscle mass during Ramadan poses a challenge, individuals should maintain their current state rather than trying to increase it, experts say. The key lies in the importance of persisting with exercise during workouts to prevent muscle loss, says Afra Guner, a physiotherapist and trainer. “These activities are best done 1-2 hours before suhoor (pre-dawn meal) or iftar (breaking of fast). After iftar, individuals can continue the same exercise routine or high-intensity exercises and weight training can be incorporated,” she tells TRT World. Comprehensive well-being Some participants of the Ramadan Run Club say they had never considered running during Ramadan, but the club's inclusive invitation prompted them to give it a try. During Ramadan, the runs occur weekly and cover approximately 5 kilometres each. Starting and ending at an Open Iftar event, a cornerstone community event by RTP held at various public venues across the UK, the route changes every time, exploring different parts of London. “The aim is to create a free, community \"social run\" — not a race! — where attendees have the chance to chat with each other and meet new people,” says Bilal. And this, in turn, helps work towards the goal of \"turning strangers into friends,\" a motto that lies at the heart of the 11-year-old Ramadan Tent Project. Trainer Guner recommends avoiding long runs of 15-20 kilometres while fasting. “Instead, aim to keep the intensity and severity of the workout at a normal level, reducing it as much as possible, and continue with frequent exercises in your regular routine,” she says. Maintaining and integrating workout routines into the Ramadan schedule will help Muslims conclude the month with greater spiritual satisfaction, experts say. At the same time, it's important to remember that Ramadan is centred on cultivating mindfulness and spiritual nourishment and the goal is not to achieve any physical milestone or achievement, says Bilal. “Instead, the focus is on spiritual growth, and maintaining a regular exercise routine can contribute to building a healthy, mindful, and spiritually fit community, enabling individuals to better focus on their fasting, prayers, and acts of charity.”",

    "text": "By Frank Zufall Sawyer County Record ,\n11 hours ago\nHAYWARD — It’s not your imagination — this winter, so far, has been mostly a mirror of the 2023-24 winter: very little snow.\nAnd after weekend rains, much of the area is snowless — much like it was in 2023 at the end of the year.\nOn Jan. 3, 2024, the Sawyer County Record published the article “2023 Nov.-Dec. snow accumulation lowest in 52 years.” That article strictly focused on the months of November and December and reported the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather Data for the local climate of the “Hayward area” recorded, with missing data, was just 2 inches (it was actually 2.6 inches).\nThere was snowfall in the Hayward area late October 2023, so the snow accumulation from Oct. 1-Dec. 31, 2023, for the Hayward area actually was 6.1 inches.\nThe 2024 NOAA snow accumulation data for October through December for the Hayward area has so much missing data that no snow accumulation is shown.\nHowever, to the west, the Spooner Experimental Agricultural Research Station, where state employees record weather data for NOAA, the October-Dec. 28, 2024 snow accumulation is 3.7 inches (with some missing data). For that same period in 2023, 3.9 inches were recorded — almost the exact amount.\nTo the northwest, the Gordon Ranger Station NOAA snow accumulation data for October-Dec. 28, 2024, is 5.4 inches (with missing data), and for the same period in 2023, the recorded snow accumulation was 5 inches. Again, the snow accumulations for both winters are very close.\nTo the northeast, Clam Lake, which typically receives more snow than the Hayward area, is reporting 13 inches of snow accumulation for the three months in 2024, and for the same October-December period in 2023, it recorded 11.5 inches. Again, the snow accumulations for the two winter seasons are tracking very close to each other.\nBen Popp, executive director of the American Birkebeiner Ski Foundation, believes the northern half of Sawyer County received much more snow than the southern half in 2024 for October-December. He said there was enough snow to groom the Birkie Trail once from Cable to Gravel Pit (about 6 miles south of the OO Trailhead east of Seeley).\n“I think there has been somewhere between 5 to 9 inches of snow,” he said on Friday, Dec. 27, 2024, adding, “But with the rain, I think all the natural snow will be gone by Monday.”\nTaken together, all the data, so far, for the start of the 2024-25 winter seasons appears to be tracking very closely with the snow accumulation that occurred at the start of the 2023-24 winter season, which was followed by low snowfall for subsequent months, negatively impacting winter sports of snowmobiling and cross-country skiing.\nIn February, the 50th American Birkebeiner was held around the Birkie start line on a 10K loop of man-made snow surrounded by bare ground. There was no natural snow available for the race to end in Hayward.\nThe 2023-24 winter economy was severely impacted by the lack of snow, resulting in empty beds at area hotels and resorts and lack of clients for area restaurants and bars.\nTo fully appreciate how low the snowfall was for the 2023-24 season, the comparison of snow accumulation from Nov. 1 to March 31 for the five previous winter seasons, from 2018-23, reveals the 2023-24 accumulation was approximately half or less of any of the five preceding winters.\n2023-24: 23.4 inches2022-23: 85.1 inches2021-22: 61.5 inches2020-21: 39.5 inches2019-20: 57.8 inches2018-19: 58.9 inches\nBut what about those forecasts?\nOver the summer and early fall, there was a lot of talk of the upcoming winter, with above-average precipitation and below-normal temperatures and to skiers and snowmobilers, that sounds like snow … lots of snow.\nThe enthusiasm was bolstered by the prediction of a La Nina event in the Pacific Ocean with a cooling of ocean surface temperatures often resulting in the Midwest experiencing colder winters, with more snow accumulation.\nLast winter season, the area was impacted by warmer El Nino currents in the Pacific that predictably resulted in higher temps and less precipitation.\nOne could easily blame the 2023-24 sad winter on big bad El Nino, but it appears, so far, El Nino’s sister, La Nina, is not coming to turn the winter season around.\nAnd looking at long-range temperature and precipitation outlooks from NOAA isn’t offering much promise either:\n• Three to four weeks’ temperature outlook has our area in 50-60% below normal temperatures.\n• Three to four weeks precipitation outlook for our area is an equal chance for being above or below normal.\nBirkie preps?\nPopp was asked if the Birkie is already thinking alternative preparations for the 2025 event, or is it too early?\n“No, it’s not too early,” said Popp. “I mean, we are not looking necessarily at full-blown alternatives, but certainly after the first of the year, we will be starting to think if we do bring the snow guns out (for snow making) and more. We learned a lot from last year and we have a series of contingencies, everything from finishing on Duffy’s Field to focusing on the northern half between the start and OO.”\nHe added, “There are probably five or six different contingencies based on whatever Mother Nature will allow.”\nHe noted the next big event for the Birkie Tail is the Seeley Hills Classic the second week in February, about six weeks away.\nPopp noted a University of Wisconsin-River Falls economic impact study of the Birkie which shows it brings in $5 million to the area that week. He said everyone at the Birkie realizes just how important it is to have a typical Birkie, including ending the race in downtown Hayward, the classic finish of the race.\nThe Record has heard some concern from downtown Hayward businesses about ensuring the race finish downtown. The concern has arisen over whether Lake Hayward freezes sufficiently and the race ends on Duffy’s Field off Wheeler Road, far from the downtown.\nPopp said he hasn’t heard from any businesses but notes there are options for going around Lake Hayward, but it would involve at least bringing in a mile of snow for a groomed trail and it would be costly.\n“I mean, we could figure a way around Lake Hayward,” he said. “We could go down Wheeler Road to County Highway B or take Highway 77 to Duffy Road, but again, we are talking of upwards of a mile of snow. We are talking serious cash if someone wants to do that, but I think it is pretty unrealistic to think the only issue is Lake Hayward. It’s not just the lake ice. It’s the snow and a variety of issues, but I mean, we are open to all ideas. We want to get people here because when people come they support local businesses.”\nWith more events occurring at the Birkie start line outside Cable and last year’s 50th Birkie held totally up near the former Telemark property, Popp said he has heard some are saying the Birkie’s focus is entirely on the Cable area and not Hayward.\n“I tell people, ‘Are you kidding me?’” he said. “The number-one thing for skiers is to finish on Main Street and that’s our number-one goal, to finish on Main Street, but it all depends on what Mother Nature allows us to do.”\nGroomed and rolled snow\nAs noted, Popp said the Birkie Trail had been groomed once from the start line down to the Gravel Pit area and then from Gravel Pit to Wheeler Road, it had been rolled with a machine but not fully groomed.\n“I’ve actually skied on the Birkie Trail six times this year,” he said. “I skied zero times last year for the same period, so I would argue we are ahead of last year by quit a bit.”\nBut Popp also acknowledges the weekend rains would probably remove all the natural snow, leaving just 5K of man-made snow around the start line.\n1",

New Delhi, March 10 An intervention by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other top leaders helped to prevent a 'potential Russian nuclear attack', CNN reported. As the Russia-Ukraine war, which broke out in 2022, intensified, the report said, citing two senior officials, that the US started \"preparing rigorously\" for a potential nuclear strike by Moscow against Kiev. The Joe Biden administration was \"specifically concerned\" that Russia might use a tactical or battlefield nuclear weapon, leading to the first nuclear attack since the US dropped bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, officials said. It was then that the US sought to enlist the help of India and China to discourage Russia from such an attack. \"US officials say that outreach and public statements from Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi helped avert a crisis,\" the CNN report stated. \"One of the things we did was not only message them directly but strongly urge, press, encourage other countries, to whom they might be more attentive, to do the same thing,\" a senior administration official said. \"I think we believe showing the international community concern about this, particularly the concern from key countries for Russia and the Global South, was also a helpful, persuasive factor and showed them what the cost of all this could be,\" the report said, quoting the official. Meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Uzbekistan in 2022, PM Modi called for a peaceful solution to the conflict and told the Russian leader that \"this is not an era of war\". PM Modi had told President Putin that democracy, diplomacy, and dialogue have kept the world together. In response, the Russian leader said that he understands India's \"concerns\" and promised PM Modi that he would try and end the conflict even as he blamed Ukraine for prolonging it.
