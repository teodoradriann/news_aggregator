    "text": "HSINCHU (TVBS News) — Typhoon Kong-rey (康芮颱風) has wreaked havoc in Hsinchu (新竹), causing strong winds and heavy rain that left 1,117 households without power on Friday (Nov. 1). Taipower (台電) has mobilized teams, striving to restore electricity before the day's end.\nThe outages primarily affect the mountainous areas of Jianshi Township (尖石鄉), where landslides have severely disrupted roadways, complicating repair efforts.\nThe typhoon has caused significant damage throughout Hsinchu, with numerous trees toppling and damaging power cables. At the height of the storm, 12,649 households experienced power outages.\nTo enhance repair efficiency, Taipower's Hsinchu District Office convened a disaster response meeting at 7 a.m. Friday. Under the leadership of its Disaster Response Team Commander Luo Yuan-liang (羅元良), the team assessed available personnel and contractors, dispatching additional workers to support mountainous regions.\nResidents in the remote areas of Jianshi Township have faced severe challenges due to fallen trees and landslides triggered by strong winds and heavy rains. These conditions have damaged power lines and poles, exacerbating the crisis. Taipower's Hsinchu District Office has established communication channels with village chiefs to report outages. They urge residents to contact their village chiefs or call the Taipower customer service hotline at 1911 for assistance.",

    "text": "Un querido restaurante cubano cerrará sus puertas tras aproximadamente 45 años de actividad en el condado de Orange.\nFélix Continental Café estaba repleto de clientes hambrientos el miércoles, mientras sus seguidores disfrutaban de su última oportunidad de saborear los platillos del restaurante. El propietario Carlos Calderón citó los desafíos económicos y el hecho de estar en el negocio durante mucho tiempo como razones para la decisión.\n“Probablemente hace dos semanas se filtró la noticia de que íbamos a cerrar”, dijo.\nLos padres de Calderón, Ramón y Lilia, abrieron el restaurante junto con su primo Tomás Llera en 1979. Carlos ayudó a su familia con el restaurante como trabajo a tiempo parcial y desde entonces ha asumido el cargo de gerente.\nDijo que cuando su familia abrió el local, solo tenían un artículo cubano en su menú: el famoso sándwich cubano del restaurante. Fue gracias a un cliente leal que la familia amplió el menú para incluir comidas más tradicionales.\n“Uno de nuestros buenos clientes habló con nuestro padre y le dijo: ‘Tu origen es cubano. ¿Por qué no empiezas a introducir algunos de esos productos?’”, dijo Carlos.\nAhora, la familia está lista para cerrar definitivamente el jueves.\n“Queremos aprovechar este momento para agradecer a nuestro dedicado equipo por su arduo trabajo, a nuestros asociados y a nuestros clientes que han sido parte de nuestra historia”, decía el sitio web del restaurante. “Su apoyo y compromiso han significado mucho para nosotros”.\n“Lo extrañaré”, dijo Carlos. “Creo que mañana, que es nuestro último día, cuando… la última vez que cierre esa puerta, me emocionaré seguro”.\n¿En cuanto a lo que le espera al dueño del negocio? Dijo que está ansioso por descansar y pasar tiempo con su familia.\nSin embargo, el restaurante ha sido vendido a un restaurante de mariscos que abrirá en una fecha no especificada.\nEsta historia apareció por primera vez en la estación hermana de Telemundo 52, NBCLA.
