    "text": "Corte arbitral concede parecer favorável ao Fortaleza em caso envolvendo Lucero e Colo-Colo\nCom a decisão, o Leão não sofrerá punição\nA Corte Arbitral do Esporte (CAS) decidiu sobre o caso envolvendo o\nFortaleza, o Colo-Colo e Juan Martin Lucero. A instância máxima do futebol mundial informou, nesta quinta-feira (16), que tanto o Tricolor do Pici quanto o atleta atuaram de forma regular no desligamento do jogador do antigo clube dele. Além disso, desconsiderou qualquer possibilidade de punições. Também não cabe recurso da decisão, e o caso foi encerrado.\n“O Fortaleza vê com naturalidade o encerramento definitivo desse caso. O reconhecimento final da Corte Arbitral do Esporte reforça os valores do clube em todos os seus movimentos de mercado. Sempre baseados em convicção, eficiência, boa fé e firmeza jurídica”, ressalta Alex Santiago, diretor de futebol do Leão do Pici, em nota publicada pelo Tricolor.\nEntenda o processo\nO Colo-Colo acionou a Fifa para denunciar o Fortaleza e o centroavante Juan Martín Lucero, em abril de 2023. De acordo com a equipe chilena, o clube cearense teria incentivado Lucero a se desligar do time para assinar com o Leão, apesar de não haver cláusula para saída no contrato do jogador.\nO grupo chileno solicitou à Fifa que o atleta fosse impedido de mudar de clube durante o período de três meses. Além disso, pediu cerca de R$ 10 milhões e que o atacante fosse impedido de atuar por cerca de quatro meses. O Leão do Pici conseguiu a suspensão da decisão, e o atleta foi liberado para atuar.\nO Fortaleza realiza pré-temporada nos Estados Unidos. A equipe estreia em competição oficial somente no dia 27 de janeiro contra o Cariri, a partir das 20h (de Brasília). O duelo será no Estádio Presidente Vargas.\nVeja também",

    "text": "DUBLIN, Ga. — Dublin businesses are gearing up to welcome crowds of visitors this weekend for the city's St. Patrick's Day celebrations. At Williamson's Bakery , owner Perry Williamson said they're celebrating the holiday with green shamrock donuts all month long. \"What the festival does for local businesses is unbelievable. We need to hang onto the shamrock in Dublin, that's for sure,\" he said. In 2022, he said one of their St. Patrick's Day weekends did better than a Christmas weekend, and he does about four times in sales on Dublin's Super Saturday than on a regular Saturday. \"The month of March here for us in Dublin. We're so blessed to have this whole festival connection with St. Patrick's and the name Dublin and Ireland,\" he said. It's all hands on deck at the family bakery, as they get ready to serve tourists like Alisha Harper who said she drove about three hours from Douglasville to visit Dublin. She comes to visit her mom during the parade weekend each year, which she said is crazy in a good way. \"Just like the community. And that you get to deck out in all green. It's always fun,\" Harper said. At the boutique, Blush , owner Rachael Jarrard is planning to take her small business to the big crowds downtown. \"I have my old airstream, my old silver bullet. So I take it downtown for the St. Patrick's Arts and Crafts Show and I bring lots of pretty clothes, jewelry, all that fun stuff,\" Jarrard said. She said she will bring lots of Easter dresses, since that's right around the corner, and will keep her store on Veterans Boulevard open as well, so people can find even more options. The Dublin Visitor Center told us St. Patrick's weekend brings in visitors in the low thousands. Two hotels right by the Visitor Center told us they were completely booked for Saturday. \"People still come into our bakery, come into our town, and it's a pleasure to meet them because they're from all over,\" Williamson said. While St. Patrick's Day is on Sunday this year, Dublin's big parade is this Saturday at 10:00 a.m. downtown. After that, the city will continue its St. Patrick's events all month long.",

    "title": "Manhattan University Professor Grishma Shah debuts novel inspired by global experiences | The Riverdale Press | www.riverdalepress.com",
    "text": "The director of global business studies and management professor at Manhattan University is moonlighting as a storyteller. Grishma Shah just released her first novel, Anagram Destiny, and she wants the world to know a good story works just as hard as a classroom. The book was published by Spark Press and Simon & Schuster on Sept. 3, and Shah is excited for readers to experience the pieces of her woven into the literature. Shah’s life was entirely changed after a trip to Honduras when she was 16 that left her upset with the state of the world beyond her home. From that moment forward, she said, she spent her life studying international development and relations. In her classroom, she teaches her students about globalization and business around the world, especially how business is done in the global south. “One of the greatest joys of my job is getting to be in the classroom and I get to bring my classroom abroad every year,” Shah said. “I take students to a different country and we learn about doing business in that country.” Her family immigrated from India when she was just 7, but Shah has ventured back to her native country many times since, both with her family and her classroom. Shah’s book is split, with half of the story taking place in Mumbai, India, and the other half — inspired by her upbringing — being told from a roadside motel in the United States. After moving to the country in the 80s with her family, they lived in roadside motels in the south for many years. She said it’s common for Punjabi families — from the Punjab region in India and Pakistan — like her own to live and work in motels. Typically, one family purchases the motel and then helps establish the rest of their community by providing a place to work to get people on their feet before they purchase their own motel. Currently, roughly 60 to 70 percent of small and medium-sized motels across the country are owned by a Punjabi family, according to Shah. Traveling back and forth to India, and even living abroad in Delhi during her college years, allowed Shah to watch the growth of the country over nearly two decades as the nation and it’s people changed their values and belief systems, and adjusted to a new culture. Shah describes her book as a dual-time love story, with the two times being split between vastly different countries. Her own experience shaped the book’s characters, and she describes the motel itself as having an identity, symbolizing inclusivity and aspiration. The “rise of India” as she refers to it, is portrayed in the book at the same time as the family in her story pursues its own American dream. While her journey as a writer is new, Shah has been a storyteller in her classroom for years. Teaching at Manhattan University for the last 16 years has taught her students are rarely drawn to teaching elements like numbers, graphs or data, but relate to stories, rich with details, that inform on the same material. She often starts the year with her students out with an exercise asking them to identify all the words they know in English that mean love. Students typically come up with around 10 words. Then Shah adds she speaks both Punjabi and Hindi, and they have at least 70 different words for love. The emphasis in the exercise is not about love as much as it centers around language and how understanding the language of a culture brings an understanding of what that culture values. “If you’re going to do anything in terms of marketing or sales, you’re going to have either have to know that language or understand how that language works,” Shah said. During the exercise, Shah explains the way to say “I love you, mom” is different than the way you say “I love you, brother” but the countless ways to say love are indicative of the fact that relationships are important in the Punjabi and Hindi cultures. Her classroom is full of bilingual students who add their own perspectives on their native languages and how words matter in their culture. Shah uses the methodology of storytelling in her classroom because she finds it gets the point across to her students faster than any statistics on how language is disappearing from the world and why it is of such importance to keep it alive. “All I really need them to understand is trends and what’s important,” Shah said. Teaching them things like the percentage of people speaking Swahili in the east of Africa does not matter as much to her because they can just as easily search the statistic up, and it is bound to change over time, but the importance of language and understanding how it affects relationships informs her students on how to tackle business abroad. Shah’s teaching pedagogy was the first step in the creation of her novel, basing her writing on her upbringing and her time spent in her classroom.",

    "text": "Fernando Belhot, el abogado uruguayo con “dos mil y pico” empresas pantalla que entregó en bandeja a Zaplana LEER ESTE TEXTO EN CATALÁN Fernando Washington Belhot Fierro, abogado uruguayo, fue uno de los personajes clave en la presunta trama corrupta liderada por el exministro del PP Eduardo Zaplana. Su despacho en Montevideo se vio salpicado en el ' caso Odebrecht ', la mayor trama de corrupción en América Latina. Su nombre salió a la superficie con el estallido del 'caso Lezo' y, especialmente, con su implicación en el 'caso Erial'. “Toda esta situación generada con este procedimiento me afectó reputacionalmente y profesionalmente, la actividad que realizaba estaba basada en la confidencialidad fundamentalmente y en la absoluta tranquilidad de los clientes y a raíz de lo que sucedió la mayoría prefirieron finalizar la relación profesional con nuestro despacho”, explicó durante su declaración por videoconferencia en el juicio mientras que Zaplana observaba con atención la pantalla en la sala y gesticulaba indignado por momentos. “La prensa muchas veces se manifiesta en una forma que no es la más objetiva”, apuntó. El testigo se presentó como un experto en asesoría fiscal internacional de clientes 'offshore' y en inversiones. Sus actividades, según declaró, se dividían a medias entre el papel de fiduciario y la asesoría fiscal y en materia de inversiones. Belhot, según se desprende de la instrucción del 'caso Erial', mantenía una auténtica 'lavadora internacional', con una estructura societaria que incluía cuentas en Andorra, Panamá o Suiza y empresas pantallas . “Teníamos dos mil y pico sociedades”, dijo este jueves en el juicio. Tenía una “nota privada” de su “puño y letra” guardada en un “cofre” y dirigida a su entonces esposa con las instrucciones en caso de fallecimiento sobre los tinglados que montó para sus clientes (el documento “decía tal cuenta pertenece a fulano de tal”, precisó). “Para el hipotético caso que a mí me pasara algo y falleciera”, apostilló. “Afortunadamente”, dijo, no fue el caso y Belhot llegó vivo a su declaración en el juicio, una de las más dañinas para la defensa de Eduardo Zaplana. El despacho también contaba con una “figura muy común en Uruguay”, la de los “directores rentados”, que ejercía, entre otros, un primo suyo. Cada uno de los directores rentados tenían a su cargo unas “50 o 60 sociedades”, de las que ni siquiera sabían a quién pertenecían en realidad. Simplemente se les pagaba un salario mensual para que firmaran “semanalmente” cierta “cantidad de documentos”. Eduardo Zaplana lo conoció en Madrid en 2009. El uruguayo reconoció que se lo presentó Íñigo Herrera Martínez de Campos, empresario y exdiputado del PP en el Congreso, con el que Belhot mantuvo una “relación más personal que profesional”. El exministro le encargó en un primer momento que se hiciera cargo de optimizar los fondos de su amigo de la infancia y testaferro confeso, Joaquín Barceló 'Pachano' . Sin embargo, Fernando Belhot se dio cuenta de que el dinero escondido en Luxemburgo y Andorra pertenecía en realidad a Zaplana, quien tenía un completo “poder de decisión” . “Siempre pensé que eran fondos no declarados en España, según me manifestó el señor Zaplana”, declaró Belhot. El letrado ofreció al exministro y exdirectivo de Telefónica condiciones óptimas que Uruguay proporcionaba por ley: la “confidencialidad” y “uno de los secretos bancarios más fuertes del mundo”. Por su parte, Zaplana le presentó a empresarios del Ibex 35 (citó a “Acciona, Gas Natural o Telefónica”) y a políticos españoles. Tras la intervención de la Banca Privada d'Andorra (BPA), por blanqueo de capitales del crimen organizado, parte de la estructura opaca de Belhot salió a la luz . Zaplana le recomendó un despacho de abogados con el que, posteriormente, cortó “relación”. El exministro incluso se habría comprometido a abonar los gastos jurídicos para “poder limpiar” su “imagen”, según declaró Belhot. El abogado uruguayo se prestó finalmente a colaborar con la Fiscalía Anticorrupción después de que el exministro del PP y el resto de presuntos miembros de la trama fueran detenidos en 2018. “Me presenté voluntario en la UCO una sola vez”, dijo en el juicio. Fernando Belhot acabó entregando casi siete millones de euros de Zaplana a la justicia española y confesó los detalles de la trama en una declaración que supuso uno de los mayores quebraderos de cabeza a la defensa de Eduardo Zaplana. “Nunca denuncié a nadie”, añadió en el juicio.",
