    "text": "El Arsenal encajó su primera derrota en casa esta Premier al caer (0-2) contra el West Ham, cediendo así el liderato que asaltó el Liverpool en el 'Boxing Day', mientras que el Tottenham sufrió otro correctivo (4-2) ante el Brighton. Los de Mikel Arteta se vieron superados por un West Ham que sacó petróleo a sus pocas ocasiones y se defendió con uñas y dientes. El derbi londinense se lo quedaron los 'hammers' con el tanto a los 13 minutos de Tomas Soucek, mal defendido por los locales y validado con suspense por el VAR, y el cabezazo de Konstantinos Mavropanos. El Arsenal dominó y tuvo muchas ocasiones, sin acierto en especial Saka, y se vio con ese 2-0 en el minuto 55. Areola bajo palos mantuvo la renta de un West Ham que salió sexto de casa de su vecino y fallando de penalti el tercero. El Arsenal se queda en 40 puntos, por los 42 del Liverpool, con 39 Aston Villa y 37, pero con un partido menos por el Mundial de Clubes, el Manchester City. En el turno anterior, el Tottenham sufrió otro traspiés que le dejó fuera de la zona de Liga de Campeones (36), al final de la primera vuelta de liga. El equipo londinense cedió al sur de Inglaterra en una gran actuación de los locales en el Amex Stadium. Jack Hinshelwood y Joao Pedro pusieron un 2-0 a los 20 minutos y el tercero fue de Pervis Estupiñán en el 63'. Una losa para unos 'Spurs' que habían mejorado en el segundo tiempo, con un Richarlison sin puntería eso sí. Un nuevo penalti de Pedro supuso el 4-0, que maquilló el Tottenham en los últimos 10 minutos. El Brighton venció así tras tres jornadas sin hacerlo para sumar 30 puntos, octavo en la tabla. --RESULTADOS DE LA JORNADA 19 EN LA PREMIER LEAGUE. -Martes. Newcastle - Nottingham Forest 1-3.

    "title": "Who is your Good Friday scapegoat?",
    "text": "Last year, I attended a Good Friday service for the first time in more than 20 years. I was a little nervous to find myself back in the pews: as a young man, I had rejected the Midwestern Catholicism of my childhood, and instead embraced the agnosticism that seemed to be the spirit of the age. In recent years, though, I’d grown disillusioned with the modern secular worldview and had started attending Mass again. Still, my scepticism of Christianity lingered, and I sure didn’t feel like I belonged in this place on this day. In the Catholic church and many others, the holy day is “celebrated” with the Stations of the Cross and the Passion Play, both re-enactments of the horrific events leading up to Christ’s death on the cross. It was the Passion Play that got me. I had forgotten how the congregation is expected to participate in the drama. At key moments, we were asked to play the role of the murderous mob, shouting “Crucify him! Crucify him!” How utterly bizarre this is, I thought. And heart-breaking. The Christian tradition asks us to imagine that the son of God was tortured and murdered by a bloodthirsty horde, while the apostle Peter cowered out of sight. And then it asks us to identify not with the suffering Christ, but with the vicious mob that cheers his death. If you were a mad scientist designing a world religion in a lab, hoping that it might appeal to the masses and spread across the world, I think it’s unlikely you would have constructed it this way. What is this strange story doing? In my search for an answer, I looked to René Girard, the French polymath who spent the last 15 years of his life at Stanford in the French Department, presumably because they couldn’t figure out where else to put him. Girard is known primarily for his theory of “mimetic desire”, the idea that human beings come to want certain things because we see other people wanting them. This is a powerful idea, and Girard uses it to develop a provocative theory of culture and violence. But it is another aspect of his thinking that got my attention. Girard defied the reigning spirit of agnostic Jungianism in the humanities. It was fashionable, in his day, to look for the similarities between different world cultures. Joseph Campbell, for example, sought to prove that myths from around the world all tapped into the same archetypes, participating in the one great “monomyth” that shapes all of us. George Lucas used these ideas to create Star Wars, a mythology that has overtaken the world in the past 40 years. It was the perfect theology for a non-judgmental, multicultural age.",

    "text": "Cold air mass, monsoon rains hit Thailand, affecting 14 provinces\nThe [Meteorological Department](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_Meteorological_Department) of Thailand (TMD) warned of another cold air mass approaching, causing temperatures to drop by 1 to 3 degrees Celsius. The southern region faces heavy monsoon rains impacting 14 provinces, while Bangkok will experience rain and wind.\nThe forecast for the next 24 hours indicates that a high-pressure area or cold air mass from China is now covering the upper part of Thailand and the South China Sea. This weather pattern is expected to bring rain initially to upper Thailand, followed by cooler weather and strong winds. Residents in these areas should care for their health due to these changing weather conditions.\nFor the southern region, a strong northeast monsoon is sweeping over the Gulf of Thailand and the southern provinces. Coupled with a low-pressure area over the lower southern region and Malaysia, it is expected to move towards the Andaman Sea.\nConsequently, the south will experience increased rainfall, with heavy to very heavy rain in some areas. Residents in these regions should be cautious of potential flash floods and rapid water flow, especially in valleys near waterways and low-lying areas.\nThe Gulf of Thailand is experiencing strong winds with waves reaching 1 to 3 metres high, and areas with thunderstorms could see waves above 3 metres. The Andaman Sea has waves about 1 metre high, with offshore waves exceeding 1 metre and over 2 metres in stormy areas.\nMariners in the Gulf of Thailand and the Andaman Sea should exercise caution and avoid sailing in stormy areas. Small boats in the Gulf of Thailand are advised to stay ashore, and residents in the southern (eastern) provinces should be wary of strong waves hitting the shore during this period.\nCold air\nDust accumulation in upper Thailand is expected to decrease due to stronger winds and better air ventilation.\nThe [weather forecast](https://thethaiger.com/tag/thailand-weather-forcast) for Thailand from 6am today to 6am tomorrow is as follows:\nIn the northern region, the upper part will have cool weather with morning fog, and temperatures will rise by 1 to 2 degrees Celsius.

Southeast winds will reach speeds of 20 to 35 kilometres per hour, with waves about 1 metre high and offshore waves about 2 metres high.\nIn the southern region (eastern side), thunderstorms will affect 80% of the area, with heavy rain in many places and very heavy rain in some. This includes Prachuap Khiri Khan, Chumphon, Surat Thani, Nakhon Si Thammarat, Phatthalung, Songkhla, Pattani, Yala, and Narathiwat.\nThe minimum temperature will be 22 to 24 degrees Celsius, and the maximum 25 to 30 degrees Celsius. Northeast winds will blow at 20 to 40 kilometres per hour, with waves 2 to 3 metres high and over 3 metres in stormy areas.\nThe southern region (western side) will experience thunderstorms in 70% of the area, with heavy rain in some areas, such as Ranong, Phang Nga, Krabi, Trang, and Satun. The minimum temperature will be 23 to 25 degrees Celsius, and the maximum 26 to 29 degrees Celsius.\nWinds from the east will move at 15 to 35 kilometres per hour, with waves about 1 metre high and offshore waves over 1 metre.

The blaze, which occurred amid the archaeological ruins of the shuls, is being investigated by Israeli authorities.\nJewish activists have condemned the incident as a hate crime, alleging that the fire was deliberately set by individuals who arrived at the site early in the morning. A spokesperson for the Israel Police’s Yehuda District confirmed that the IDF had reported a fire in the area and said authorities are investigating the cause. The IDF has not yet commented on the fire’s origin.\nEliram Azoulai, head of the Har Chevron Regional Council, labeled the fire as “an act of terrorism” and claimed it was an attempt “to erase Jewish identity and symbols from the regions of our fathers.” Azoulai urged security forces to take firm action to protect the historic site.\nhttps://yeshivaworlds3.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/26115025/WhatsApp-Video-2024-09-26-at-11.42.25-AM.mp4 (YWN World Headquarters – NYC)",

    "title": "How Mountain Communities Prepare for Sudden Blizzards (See Their Smart Strategies) - NewsBreak",
    "text": "Mountain communities have transformed their approach to disaster preparedness, shifting from reactive to proactive strategies. Many households are accustomed to keeping emergency supplies due to frequent winter weather events. However, there are still disparities between urban areas with better store access and rural areas where residents may need to travel longer distances to stock up before a storm. Temperature variations exceeding 20% cause demand fluctuations for around 14% of major consumer packaged goods. Local residents have adapted by maintaining rolling inventories of essential supplies throughout the year, rather than waiting for storm warnings to trigger panic buying. Mountain towns are revolutionizing their emergency response through citizen-led initiatives. The Town of Black Mountain launches a Community Emergency Response Team program, which will train citizens to assist local first responders in emergency and non-emergency situations. Veteran EMT and firefighter David Billstrom is working with the Black Mountain Fire Department to establish a Community Emergency Response Team, which trains and coordinates citizens to assist first responders in emergency and non-emergency situations. While more than 7,000 CERTs are active throughout the country, including approximately 84 in N.C., Black Mountain will be the first in Western N.C. These programs have proven invaluable, with Billstrom, who coordinated communication for the town’s rescue and recovery efforts, was impressed with the specialized skills of his fellow volunteers. “In many ways, they had more training and experience with disasters than the police and fire chiefs,” he said. That · could include a small snow shovel, jumper cables, a flashlight, blankets and extra clothes, chargers for cell phones, water, food, a tow rope, a spare tire and a first aid kit. Mountain residents have learned to treat their vehicles as potential emergency shelters, recognizing that If you get stranded in your car during a blizzard, put your hazard lights on. New Hampshire officials · advise putting a distress flag in your window or on your antenna and staying put unless you can see a building where you know you can take shelter. Smart strategies include keeping A bag of sand or kitty litter is also helpful because it can weigh the vehicle down, making it easier to drive in the snow. Plus, if you get stuck, you can sprinkle it on the ground to help with traction. These preparations have proven life-saving during unexpected blizzards. Mountain communities have recognized that power outages during blizzards can last for extended periods. Palange has been through her fair share of winter storms in New Hampshire and Maine. She was once stuck with no power for two weeks after an ice storm in 1998. She had heat from a wood stove, but no way to cook or shower. This experience has shaped modern preparedness strategies. Liberty Utilities is preparing for potential power disruptions, according to posts on the utility company’s social media pages. Crews are standing by to respond to outages. They advise customers to ensure their contact information is up to date, keep electronic devices charged, fuel up automobiles, keep cash on hand and prepare at least a 48-hour supply of nonperishable food and water. Mountain communities have developed sophisticated communication networks to handle blizzard conditions. Members of CERT will be issued a radio through which they can communicate with the department, and also utilized in non-emergency situations, according to Billstrom. “We looked at other CERT teams, and one lesson from the ones that have thrived through the years is that they need to be deployed often,” he said. These communication systems serve multiple purposes, ensuring that emergency response teams can coordinate effectively even when traditional communication infrastructure fails. The approach recognizes that “This isn’t just get trained and wait for the next emergency, this helping out at the parade, festivals and perhaps, a large wildland fire. We’ll be looking for opportunities to deploy them, so they can use what they learn.” · One objective is to establish a multi-use resource for local first responders. Mountain residents have mastered the art of emergency food storage, moving beyond traditional “bread and milk” approaches. But if you stock your pantry with filling shelf-stable foods, you won’t go hungry while waiting for the snow to be cleared. Here are some of the most important snowstorm essentials to purchase well in advance of an impending storm: Bottled water (at least one gallon per person per day for at least three days) Canned goods, especially cozy, warming foods like soups and stews · Snack foods like chips, crackers and cookies in sealed packages. This strategic approach recognizes that While gathering all these supplies, don’t forget to fill up your car’s gas tank. Winter storms could interrupt fuel deliveries in your area. The emphasis on shelf-stable foods ensures families can maintain nutrition even during extended power outages when refrigeration becomes unavailable. Mountain communities have learned that relying on a single heating source during blizzards can be dangerous. Before the winter season begins, make sure you can heat your home safely. Prepare your home to keep out the cold with insulation, caulking, and weather stripping. Consider using an indoor thermometer or thermostat to monitor the temperature inside. These preparations have become standard practice in alpine regions. Install and test smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors with battery back-ups. Be ready to live without power, gas, and water. Learn how to keep pipes from freezing. The focus on backup heating systems and carbon monoxide detection reflects hard-learned lessons from past winter emergencies where residents faced life-threatening situations. Recent blizzards have demonstrated the critical importance of understanding road closure patterns. The snow has closed a 70-mile stretch of Interstate 80 near the Nevada state line for more than a day after highway officials reported stranded drivers Friday night. Some areas of the Sierra saw more than 7 feet of snow in a 72-hour period, according to the National Weather Service, including Sugar Bowl, California, which received 89 inches (7.42 feet) and Donner Peak, California, which got 87 inches (7.25 feet). Mountain communities have developed sophisticated systems for monitoring road conditions and coordinating with emergency services. “At one point, emergency personnel and tow trucks had a difficult time getting to motorists due to blizzard conditions,” the agency said. Many other roadways in the area are closed due to the weather and some are being chain controlled, requiring vehicles to have chains to proceed on the roadways. Mountain ski resorts have become integral to community emergency preparedness strategies. Ski resorts were thrilled with the impending snowfall but joined officials in warning that mountain roads could be closed during the worst of the storm. Ski resorts could face partial or full closures during the peak of the blizzard on Friday and Saturday. “We do expect that Sunday will be a day of patience as we dig out,” Palisades Tahoe said on social media. These facilities provide crucial resources during emergencies, including “It’s going to DUMP,” Mammoth Mountain said on social media. “It’s looking like we have a lot of digging to look forward to the next few days.” · “During these major storms expect DEEP snow, always ski and ride with a buddy, keep your buddy in sight and avoid the base of trees. Be aware of Snow Immersion Suffocation (SIS) dangers,” Mammoth Mountain said. Mountain communities have dramatically improved their weather monitoring capabilities, recognizing that “It’ll arrive with a vengeance,” said meteorologist Amanda Young of the National Weather Service’s Reno office, which issued a rare blizzard warning for the region, which is typically issued only once a year or every other year. This level of forecasting precision allows communities to prepare more effectively. A blizzard warning through Sunday morning covers a 300-mile stretch from north of Lake Tahoe to south of Yosemite National Park. “Your safe travel window is over in the Sierra,” the National Weather Service in Reno posted Thursday morning on social media. “Best to hunker down where you are.” Communities have learned to take these warnings seriously, with Meteorologists predict as much as 10 feet of snow is possible in the mountains around Lake Tahoe by the weekend, with 3 to 6 feet in the communities on the lake’s shores.

Photo by Emma Malinak/VTDigger MONTPELIER — Derek Malbroux has a question for residents of Vemont’s capital city: “If you were suddenly homeless, how would you want to be treated?”\nHe wrote the message in neon chalk in front of City Hall on Aug. 14, six days after he began a protest there.\nMalbroux, 28, said he started the protest to get the attention of local government officials who closed an encampment at the top of Country Club Road last week where Malbroux and roughly a dozen other people had been living.\n“I’m sick of being promised safe places to live, then getting evicted,” he said. “So I’m willing to do this as long as I have to, until we get some type of answer.”\nMalbroux said his primary demands are to find out where he, and other unhoused people, can camp safely for the summer and to be treated with respect.\nAccording to the Montpelier Police Department’s encampment response policy , city staff “shall take a general non-involvement approach to any found emergency sleeping camp sites, with the particular lens of not criminalizing people creating shelter due to a lack of housing.” Staff will only intervene in “high-sensitivity areas” — defined as “locations where the health and safety impacts of encampments have a heightened potential to degrade public safety, public health, environmental protection, or critical infrastructure” — according to the policy.\nDerek Malbroux and other community members gather on the steps of Montpelier City Hall for a hunger strike on Monday, August 12. Photo by Emma Malinak/VTDigger An estimated 12 to 15 people were camping at the former country club site when Montpelier city officials declared it a “high sensitivity area” on Aug. 7 and put barricades around the parking lot.\nIn an interview, Montpelier Mayor Jack McCullough said the site was closed “to protect public safety and and protect the safety of everyone who’s on the land, you know, from risk of some kind of confrontation.”\nMcCullough said the city has issued no official communication about where people who had been camping at the site should go.\nA seasonal shelter run by Good Samaritan, also located at the former country club lot, is closed for the summer and will not reopen until October. The city doesn’t have the money or staff to open a temporary shelter or secure an area as an encampment, McCullough said.\n“If we had unlimited resources and if we could do more, we would,” he said. “I know that’s not a satisfactory answer for someone whose needs are immediate.”\nMalbroux said he was living at the Good Samaritan shelter from February until May. But when the shelter closed for the summer — and with other local shelters at capacity — he had no choice but to begin camping outside.\nWhen he was evicted last week, he said he “knew words could only go so far” and decided to begin a hunger strike on Aug. 8.\nHe fasted for four days until the protest was interrupted Monday afternoon — when Malbroux was arrested by Montpelier police on a warrant for two unrelated alleged misdemeanors that occurred on May 7 and June 16, according to the arrest warrant provided by the Montpelier Police Department.\nMalbroux was bailed out of jail Monday and appeared in court on Tuesday, according to an arrest report. He told VTDigger on Wednesday that he was not charged and was instead offered a diversion program in which he has to write an apology letter to individuals involved in the situations.\nDerek Malbroux gets arrested by Montpelier Police officers on a warrant for previous misdemeanors outside Montpelier City Hall on Monday, August 12. Photo by Emma Malinak/VTDigger When asked if the arrest changed his mindset, Malbroux said, “Hell no. After court, I came right back here. Our work isn’t done here.”\nBy Wednesday, Malbroux and other local leaders had coordinated a group of about 25 community members to attend the Montpelier City Council meeting and share their concerns with city officials.\nValerie Coolidge, 48, said she joined the meeting to “help people see the reality” of homelessness. About seven years ago, Coolidge and her four children — ranging in age from 4 to 17 at the time — found themselves unhoused after Coolidge escaped an abusive relationship.\nThey lived in a tent and in Coolidge’s car as she attempted to navigate Montpelier’s “scattered resources,” she said. While she now has safe, stable housing, she said she is still haunted by the “feeling that no one cares.”\n“When you’re homeless, there’s a layer of invisibility. You’re not seen anymore,” she said. “So you have to claw your way out yourself.”\nMcCullough said he was thankful for the opportunity to hear everyone’s point of view at the meeting. “But I don’t think that people’s minds were necessarily changed,” he said, adding that council members have a limited budget to work with and will continue to prioritize public safety.\n“The resources of the city of Montpelier are never going to be enough to end homelessness in Montpelier,” he said. “We’re really looking to state government in particular to help provide the resources that are needed.”\nMeanwhile, Malbroux plans to continue his strike. He said he’s being supported by a few other strikers who are taking turns fasting. “If anyone feels fatigued, they can tag in someone else in,” he said. “We want people to stay safe.”\nFor Montpelier’s unhoused community, he said, looking out for each other is nothing new.\n“We’re a community of strangers, but we’re here for each other,” he said.\nI hope this article was valuable to you.
