    "text": "WASHINGTON: A group of chemical compounds used to disinfect water for one-third of the US population and millions of others globally produces a potentially toxic byproduct, according to new research published on Thursday, sparking calls for an “immediate” investigation into possible health impacts.\nInorganic chloramines have been used for decades to remove pathogens from public water supplies.\nThough chlorine remains the most widely used disinfectant in the US and globally, chloramines have increasingly replaced it in many systems to reduce certain byproducts linked to bladder and colon cancer, low birth weight, and miscarriage.\nToday, more than 113 million Americans rely on chloraminated drinking water, with the compound also in use across Canada, Asia, and Europe.\n“However, chloramines themselves decompose into products that are poorly characterized,” said Julian Fairey, lead author of the study published in the journal Science, during a press briefing.\nOne such product, identified more than 40 years ago but left chemically unresolved, was simply dubbed the “unidentified product.”\nFairey and his team have finally cracked the mystery.\nUsing a combination of traditional chemistry methods and modern tools like high-resolution mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, they identified the compound as “chloronitramide anion.”\nThe compound was detected in all 40 chloraminated drinking water samples tested, with concentrations reaching up to 100 micrograms per liter -- exceeding typical regulatory limits for disinfection byproducts, which range between 60 and 80 micrograms per liter. Although toxicological studies have yet to be conducted, the researchers sounded a warning.",

    "text": "Rate of stroke deaths among middle-age US adults hit two-decade high during COVID pandemic, report shows\nMiddle-aged people in the United States are more likely to die from a stroke than they have been in about two decades, according to a new report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nVideo above: Junk food is leading to memory problems and strokes\nAfter at least a decade of decline, the death rate from stroke for people ages 45 to 64 started to rise in 2012. By 2019, the stroke death rate for this age group had grown 7% from where it was seven years earlier, and it spiked another 12% in the early years of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nStroke deaths for this age group dipped slightly in 2022 but were still significantly higher than before the pandemic. More than 19,700 people ages 45 to 64 died from a stroke in 2022, according to the new report – about 24 deaths for every 100,000 people in this age group.\nStroke is the fifth leading cause of death in the U.S. overall, and most strokes happen to people 65 and older. Earlier\nresearch has found that Covid-19 infection raises the risk of stroke for people of all ages.\nBut the longer-term rise in stroke death rates among middle-aged people contrasts with the downward trend seen among seniors and elderly people over the past decade, says Sally Curtain, a statistician with the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics and author of the new report.\nAlso, racial and ethnic disparities in the death rate from stroke are much higher among middle-aged adults than they are for older adults, she said. Among those 65 and older, the stroke death rate for Black people was 24% higher than it was for White seniors; among those ages 45 to 64, it was 133% higher for Black people than White people.\nMiddle-aged men are more likely to die from a stroke than middle-aged women, and stroke death rates are higher in the South than in any other region, according to the new report.\nIn 2022, there were about 66 deaths from stroke for every 100,000 middle-aged Black men living in the South – nearly three times more than the overall rate for this age group.\nExperts warn that middle age is an important time to monitor your health and manage risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity.\n\"Many people think about stroke being an older person's disease, and it is. The longer you're alive, the longer the risk factors have to cause plaque to form in blood vessels,\" said Dr. Elisabeth Breese Marsh, a vascular neurologist and director of the Comprehensive Stroke Center at Johns Hopkins Bayview. But the arteries start to harden in middle age, which can exacerbate the build-up and lead to complications.\n\"All of these risk factors are so prevalent in society, and we're seeing them at earlier ages. It is not uncommon for younger people now to have strokes due to these comorbidities,\" said Marsh, who was not involved in the new report. \"No one wants to feel old, but it's taking care of yourself earlier on that really helps you to thrive in middle and later life.\"\nStroke diagnosis and treatment options have evolved greatly over the past decade, experts say. And new ways to address comorbidities – such as blockbuster GLP-1 drugs that are used to treat type 2 diabetes and obesity – hold promise in managing risk factors.\nBut it's crucial for people who are having a stroke to act fast – and to have equitable access to health care and treatment, experts say.\nStrokes are often identified by a sudden severe headache, vision problems in one or both eyes, trouble walking, paralysis or numbness in the face or limbs, and trouble speaking or understanding others, according to the Mayo Clinic.\nThe younger brains of middle-age adults have significant potential to recover if treated quickly and aggressively, Marsh said, but people in this age group may wait longer to seek care because they may be less likely to admit they need help.\n\"It's really important, whether it's the patient or their family, that they recognize the symptoms and get to the hospital as fast as possible,\" she said. \"Those first couple of hours are critical.\"",

    "text": "INDIANAPOLIS — People living at 36th and Wallace Ave. say every time it rains, water accumulates on the driveway forcing cars to drive into their yards, turn around and even trap some.\nThey call it Lake Wallace and have been reaching out for years, but haven't been able to get it resolved.\n\"Don't let it get cold and freeze! It turns into ice. It's hectic, and it's ugly. It's unnecessary, and it's not right,\" said Renita Trice.\nWhen it rains, it pours for Trice, her mother and her neighbors.\nUnder the water are potholes, some measuring 4 and a half inches deep.\n\"Transportation wouldn't come through this to come in our driveway to pick up my mother for her appointments. Now, that's bad,\" said Trice.\nThe transportation company confirmed to WRTV that when it rains, it is not safe and therefore not possible to reach passengers there.\nIt hopes the city will fix the pothole problem and the water issues.\n\"It's very frustrating. My mother is 84 years old. She should be able to have whatever transportation she needs. She is a taxpayer and a homeowner,\" said Trice.\nIt's a problem Trice said lingers.\n\"It dries up over time, but it takes time,\" she said.\n\"The kids gotta walk through the yard to get to their bus stop on 36th. Cars turn around and back out and won't come in because of all this water,\" said Trina Conwell.\nWRTV's Rachael Wilkerson watched as cars stopped.\n\"I didn't come over here to go swimming. This looks like a pool,\" said a passing driver.\nResidents have called Indy's Department of Public Works for help.\n\"For the last 10-15 years,\" said Trice.\n\"Yes, 10-15 years. I've called the city. They put the cone out there, and they never been back. It's been out here two to three years,\" said Conwell.\nDPW said resurfacing the road could help, but the decade-long issue revolves around a major stormwater infrastructure revamp. A project that is currently not on the radar.\nWhen formulating a capital project plan to address stormwater and road infrastructure needs of the community, Indy DPW utilizes stormwater data, councilor feedback, and Mayor's Action Center tickets. There is not a capital project assigned to that area at this time.\n\"It's unfair. I feel we pay taxes like everybody else. Why can't we get our street fixed,\" said Conwell.\nThe city told WRTV, the money needed to fund a project of that size would come from a stormwater user fee.",

    "text": "NASA's stranded astronauts issued a powerful five-word message to Americans concerned about their health and safety Thursday morning. NASA's stranded astronauts have given a rare interview in which they addressed concerns about their health and safety.\nSunita Williams and Butch Wilmore, who were only supposed to spend eight days aboard the International Space Station (ISS) when they arrived on June 6, spoke to Good Morning about their extended stay on Thursday.\nWhen asked if they had a message for people who have been worried about them, Wilmore said: 'We're thankful for your support.'\nThe interview comes just days after Elon Musk said the Starliner crew was abandoned in space by the Biden administration for 'political reasons.'\nWhen asked about Musk's remarks, Wilmore said: 'Political reasons — I have not heard that. I'm not sure that that could be the case based on what I know.'\nHe also explained that he and Williams do not view themselves as 'stranded', saying: 'That's not how we feel.'\nThe two astronauts have now been on the ISS for 266 days. They're currently scheduled to return to Earth on a SpaceX spacecraft in March, but by that time, they will have spent more than nine months in space.\nDuring a Thursday interview with Good Morning America, NASA's stranded astronauts issued a powerful five-word message to Americans: 'We're thankful for your support'\nAmericans have been concerned about Williams and Wilmore since their capsule, Boeing's Starliner, was plagued with issues while taking them to the ISS.\nNASA and Boeing spent months trying to fix helium leaks and other issues, but the craft was eventually deemed unsafe and sent back to Earth in September without the pair.\n'There's many ways to characterize it, stranded I don't think is one of them,' Wilmore told GMA.\n'We came up here with a plan to test out the spacecraft and return.

    "text": "Without legal protections, farmworkers rely on employers to survive extreme heat\nJohn Augustine runs a 90-acre nursery outside Phoenix specializing in desert-adapted plants, trees and shrubs, and in the 50 years of running the business, he recalls only about six cases of heat illness.\nAt Augustine's main operation, his Desert Tree Farm employs about 60 people. Crews have water coolers out in the field, \"go at a nice pace\" and take about three breaks.\nHe gives them this advice: Wear loose fitting, long-sleeved cotton shirts and a hat, start your work before daybreak, and avoid energy beverages. \"Drink plenty water and drink more plenty water,\" he says.\nLike most people\nworking outdoors in America's hottest city, Augustine and his crew know how to cope in the summer months, just like people employed in construction, roofing, cooling systems and other service providers.\nAgriculture is \"hard, skilled work,\" said Augustine. \"And it is necessary work.\"\nThere are about 1,527 farms in Maricopa County and about 30% of them hire farm labor, according to USDA\ncensus data. On about 260,000 acres of cropland, farms in the county produce cow milk, hay for cows that produce the milk, vegetables, melons, potatoes, other horticultural crops and nursery plants. Few farms hire more than 10 employees, both year-round and seasonal, and only 62 hire migrant workers.\nTo date there are no federal heat standards for outdoor or indoor workers, although the Occupational Safety and Health Administration published a\nproposed rule in July.\nLonger shifts mean more breaks\nFarmers who hire just a couple of full-time employees have longer shifts too. About 30 miles west of Phoenix in Waddell, Selwyn Justice ends his rounds at 3 or 4 a.m. and resumes at 8 a.m.\nHarvest is still ongoing at the 30 acres of grapefruit orchards from the historic family farm, operating since 1928. This year is the latest they've ever harvested. The season goes from November to May, but because they sell locally, the Justice Brothers Ranch can still pick about 25% of the fruit that is not over-ripe to supply schools and distribute to Phoenix, Flagstaff and Tucson through the Sun Produce Co-op.\nJustice starts the irrigation system at peak heat, around 4 p.m., and does rounds about every two hours to make sure it's running properly. He ends that shift about 12 hours later, taking some time for sleep, and restarts to do picking and tractor work, hopefully in two of the three machines that have AC in the cabin.\n\"Discretion is the better part of harvesting this year,\" which is why Justice, 35, does mostly all the picking himself this time of year. He has to be sensitive and choose fruit that is firm enough.\nThe farm has four full-time employees, and about two more in peak harvest season. One also works 12-hour shifts but there is an air conditioned office nearby for breaks. They take a one-hour lunch break and rest as much as possible. If they're not in the orchard, which provides shade, they set up a huge umbrella at the end of the field and use water stations. If it's above 113 degrees they call it quits.\n\"There's nothing that we do that is worth the health risk of being out in that kind of temperature,\" Justice said.\nA judgment call\nSome farmwork is necessarily more intensive.\n\"One thing about melons is that once it's ready, it's ready. You can't wait,\" said Augustine, a lifelong farmer, about the harvest season. He did some picking work in the late 1960s in Yuma, getting up at 3 a.m. to harvest before light. \"It's hard work.\"\nCanteloupes and honeydew peak harvest season matches the peak of summer. Seasonal workers usually start picking the fruit around July and finish by September, with temperatures often above three digits in Arizona, but there is fieldwork and preparation needed as early as April.\nThe season requires many workers and because it requires more physical labor, there is higher risk of heat-exhaustion.\nDel Bosque Farms' crews, in Fresno County, California, harvest from 6 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. A field person refills their jugs with water and ice along the day. During their break, workers jump to a retrofitted cotton trailer, a 30-foot long wagon with metal mesh, that has benches inside and a canopy for shade.\nSometimes, when scorching temperatures are sure to put someone at risk of heat illness, they cut the day short. It's undesirable for everyone: Workers don't get a full day's pay and the farm is likely to lose fruit in the fields. It's also not mandated by California\nheat standards, which have been in place since 2005.\n\"It's a judgment call,\" said farm owner Joe Del Bosque. When it's hot, more fruit ripens and there is more to pick. If workers go home early, that fruit stays in the field and gets scorched.\n\"When you lose crop you lose a lot of money. It's happened to me before,\" he said. But in most cases, he will choose to send people home for safety. He and his wife Maria Gloria were farmworkers, and are still in the field every day. \"We don't want anybody to get sick. We need everybody on the job.\"\nMost of the workers are recurring, but they still go through safety training every season, and every Monday, they have short refreshers on heat illness, food safety, machinery operation or other topics. Del Bosque also goes through many hours of training and certification and is chair emeritus of a nonprofit dedicated to farmworker safety.\nEven with no federal or state standard, it is farmers' responsibility to take care of their workers and provide safe working conditions, Del Bosque said.\nClara Migoya covers agriculture and water issues for The Arizona Republic, part of the USA TODAY Network, and can be reached at .\nOne week in the Phoenix heat:\nLiving and dying in America’s hottest big city\nWhen heat hurts:\nER doctors treat heatstroke, contact burns on Phoenix's hottest days\n'Hotter than it's ever been':\nHow this 93-year-old copes with Phoenix's 100-degree heat\nMeasuring heat:\nHow to do it correctly, according to scientists, and why it matters\nDying in America's hottest city:\nMeth and heat are a deadly mix.
