    "text": "As a concerned traveler, I have seen the discrimination and harassment that my Muslim friends have experienced at the hands of EL AL or Tel Aviv authorities. Each time they travel through Israel, they are subjected to over 5 hours of interrogation and humiliation - their phones searched, their dignity stripped away. This is not an isolated incident but a recurring pattern that has affected many innocent travelers.\nDelta Airlines recently expanded its partnership with Israel's EL AL airline. This move will likely result in more passengers being funneled through Tel Aviv for connecting flights in the future. Given the current discriminatory practices at this airport and at EL AL, it is highly probable that Muslim passengers will miss their connecting flights due to unnecessarily prolonged security checks.\nThis situation is not only unfair but also unjust. No one should be subjected to such treatment based on their religious beliefs or ethnicity. It goes against the principles of equality and respect for human rights which we all hold dear.\nAccording to a report by Haaretz, there were numerous complaints about ethnic profiling by EL AL or immigration authorities, where Arab passengers were often singled out for invasive security checks which include \"ridiculous, humiliatingly intimate questions.\"\nHere are some links to documented cases of discrimination:\nhttps://www.timesofisrael.com/us-said-to-investigation-el-als-alleged-discrimination-of-palestinian-american/#:~:text=The%20US%20Transportation%20Department%20has,to%20a%20Tuesday%20report%20on https://www.arabnews.com/node/2347711/world https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/01/renee-rabinowitz-sue-israeli-airline-el-al-orthodox-gender-discrimination https://www.haaretz.com/2010-05-02/ty-article/el-al-employees-complain-of-religious-discrimination/ 17f-ef2f-d3be-ad7f-ff2f5bc40000 https://adc.org/elal-airlines/ https://ceasefiremagazine.co.uk/entering-ben-gurion-airport-tel-aviv-skin-colour-ethnicity-religion-reasonable-suspicion/ https://www.globalvillagespace.com/muslim-travelers-ordeal-at-ben-gurion-airport-sparks-outrage/ https://www.cair.com/press_releases/cair-files-complaint-after-israeli-agents-detain-brutalize-american-citizen-at-ben-gurion-airport/ https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/2014-10-30/ty-article/.premium/what-racial-profiling-is-like/ 17f-f0c3-d223-a97f-fddf742a0000 https://www.haaretz.com/2012-02-17/ty-article/airport-security-cant-treat-arab-israelis-like-suspicious-objects/ 17f-df26-d3ff-a7ff-ffa615530000 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_profiling_in_Israel\nWe urge Delta Airlines to suspend its partnership agreement with EL AL until these discriminatory practices are stopped completely by Tel Aviv authorities. We believe this action will send a strong message about Delta's commitment towards ensuring fair treatment for all its passengers irrespective of their religion or ethnicity.\nPlease sign this petition if you stand against discrimination and support equal treatment for all travelers.",

    "text": "CAPITOLA — A Sacramento-based law firm filed a class action lawsuit against Pacific Gas and Electric Co. Tuesday, on behalf of Capitola Village home and business owners it says have suffered in the aftermath of a Christmas morning apartment explosion last year.\nThe lawsuit, filed in Santa Cruz County Superior Court by Kershaw Talley Barlow, alleges that the pre-dawn apartment building explosion was caused by a failure in PG&E’s underground infrastructure. According to the filing, the plaintiffs contend that electrical overheating in PG&E’s wiring melted through a gas service line it shared a utility trench with, causing gas to escape for nearly two hours before it found an ignition point and leveled the two-story residential building at 105 Lawn Way.\nThe Capitola Police Department reported that first responders were called to the residence, not far from the village’s Esplanade, around 5:10 a.m. on Christmas Day after receiving reports of a structure fire and possible gas explosion. Emergency personnel evacuated nearby residents and extinguished the flames later that morning.\n“This was an entirely preventable disaster caused by infrastructure that should have been safely maintained and compliant with the law,” said Bill Kershaw, founding partner at Kershaw Talley Barlow, in a media release. “This community deserves answers and improvements to bring non-compliant underground utility lines into compliance with the Public Utility Commissions General Orders and to make sure Capitola Village is safe and that this never happens again.”\nAccording to the firm’s court filing that was shared with the Sentinel, plaintiffs include village residents or homeowners Karin Anderson, Mary Locke and Julie Geraci as well as Anthony Guajardo, owner of Mijo’s Taqueria and chair of the Capitola Village Business Improvement Assessment.\nA spokesperson for PG&E told the Sentinel in a statement Wednesday that the utility giant was aware of existing lawsuits related to the village incident and that it had launched a pair of investigations to uncover additional information.\n“Safety remains our most important responsibility, and we are confident in the safety of the local gas system. We are currently conducting work in the area to expose and replace some facilities as an additional layer of protection for the community,” the spokesperson wrote. “We also have initiated two investigations to understand what factors contributed to this safety incident — an evaluation conducted by a specialized team within PG&E and an investigation conducted by an independent third-party engineering firm, Exponent.”\nThe building in which the explosion occurred, the plaintiffs’ lawyers wrote, was home to four units and three residents, two of whom were not at home on the day of the blast. The one resident that was in the building, according to the court complaint, suffered a severe concussion, potential traumatic brain injury and has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.\nAs for the rest of the residents and business owners in the village, the litigators wrote, many fear another leak and explosion is likely due, in part, to the fact that the village is known to flood during heavy storms and high tides and the saltwater may have contributed to more widespread degradation of utility trenches and equipment corrosion.\nIn addition to financial remedies, the plaintiffs have also asked that PG&E inspect subsurface gas and electric supply lines within the village area, and that it establish a joint task force with interested stakeholders to help determine placement and construction of underground utility lines throughout Capitola Village.",

    "text": "又到高考放榜季，各级教育部门又在三令五申“严禁炒作高分考生”时，社交平台上却涌动着更为喧嚣的“屏蔽生”狂欢。\n教育部门旨在淡化分数崇拜的初衷，在自媒体手中却异化为精准的“流量密码”。这一鲜明反差，暴露出多重深层困境：首先是政策传导机制失效，利益各方表面遵守却暗中泄密；其次监管存在明显盲区，教育部门对商业平台鞭长莫及；而最根本的症结，在于教育评价体系的制度性缺失，为“地下流量经济”提供了滋生的沃土。\n政策理想与现实操作间的巨大落差，催生出一套隐秘的传播“潜规则”。\n禁令在体制内的学校层面确乎形成刚性约束——校门不见喜报，官网撤下捷报，表彰活动也转为“低调进行”。\n然而，禁令一旦延伸至网络平台便迅速消解。自媒体化身“信息掮客”，以“大数据分析”之名，公然发布“屏蔽生分布图”，炒作区域或学校教育实力的“分析”、“比较”乃至“PK”。\n这种“明禁暗炒”的传播生态，使屏蔽生信息从官方渠道的“消失”反而强化了其稀缺价值，刺激了地下信息市场的繁荣。各种网络营销将公共教育成果私有化为商业筹码。\n自媒体流量经济的商业逻辑，正在解构教育公共政策的权威性。其实不仅仅是“屏蔽生”，一直以来，当各种教育政策和教育事件“禁止宣传”的行政指令遭遇“流量即收益”的市场法则，政策在自媒体场域从来都是被系统性架空。\n破解困局需要超越“一刀切”禁令，构建疏导结合的政令发布和执行机制。\n变“堵”为“疏”，提供权威信息替代品：教育部门加大推进教育评价改革，主动发布区域教育质量指标和信息，用详实的师资建设、课程创新、学生发展数据替代对“屏蔽生”的片面关注。\n唯有教育评价的深刻变革，方能重塑地方政府与学校的政绩观，建立科学的多元评价体系让公众、学校、家长摆脱分数依赖，让教育价值回归理性。\n教育评价改革确是一项浩繁艰巨的系统工程，然其意义深远——它不仅是治本之策，更是为教育主管部门、地方政府及学校实现真正的“解套”——“清北人数”“屏蔽生人数”的政绩指标继续下去，大家都痛苦。\n关于“公众为何爱追逐屏蔽生”的深层心理与制度原因解析，请点视频→\n文|记者 蒋隽",

    "text": "Fortinet ( FTNT Quick Quote FTNT - Free Report ) closed the latest trading day at $59.40, indicating a +0.1% change from the previous session's end. The stock outperformed the S&P 500, which registered a daily gain of 0.04%. At the same time, the Dow added 0.14%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.03%.\nThe network security company's shares have seen an increase of 10.71% over the last month, surpassing the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 4.9% and the S&P 500's gain of 5.28%.\nThe investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of Fortinet in its upcoming release. It is anticipated that the company will report an EPS of $0.43, marking a 2.27% fall compared to the same quarter of the previous year. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $1.41 billion, indicating a 9.67% growth compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.\nIn terms of the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates predict earnings of $1.56 per share and a revenue of $5.3 billion, indicating changes of +31.09% and +19.91%, respectively, from the former year.\nInvestors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Fortinet. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), possesses a remarkable history of outdoing, externally audited, with #1 stocks returning an average annual gain of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection remained stagnant. As of now, Fortinet holds a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\nLooking at valuation, Fortinet is presently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 37.98. This signifies a discount in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 39.88 for its industry.\nIt is also worth noting that FTNT currently has a PEG ratio of 2.2. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Internet - Software industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.81 as trading concluded yesterday.\nThe Internet - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 27, placing it within the top 11% of over 250 industries.\nThe Zacks Industry Rank evaluates the power of our distinct industry groups by determining the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks forming the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\nYou can find more information on all of these metrics, and much more, on Zacks.com.",

    "text": "SANT’OMERO – Sciopero “con adesione altissima” oggi al Magazzino Pregis di Sant’Omero (Teramo), che si occupa di logistica e distribuzione di prodotti alimentari per la ristorazione. A dirlo, in una nota, è il sindacato Sudd Cobas.\nAd incrociare le braccia e picchettare dalle prime ore della mattina i cancelli dello stabilimento sono i lavoratori in appalto dipendenti della cooperativa Logistic.\n“A questi lavoratori da anni viene applicato il contratto Multiservizi Pulizie, che non ha nulla a che fare con le loro reali mansioni. L’appalto riguarda infatti proprio le attività di magazzino e smistamento merci. Ma con questo sistema la cooperativa risparmia circa 400 euro al mese sullo stipendio di ogni dipendente rispetto all’applicazione del CCNL Trasporto Merci e logistica”.\n“A questo si somma poi il mancato pagamento degli straordinari e delle maggiorazioni per il lavoro notturno e festivo. Si tratta di una situazione che non è più tollerabile.\n“È inaccettabile che dopo un mese di lavoro faticoso e usurante (in molti lavorano in celle refrigerate a -20°) ci si trovi poco più di mille euro in busta paga”.\n“Oggi è sciopero quindi per richiedere l’applicazione del contratto a cui i lavoratori hanno diritto, ovvero quello della Logistica. Ma anche per richiedere la fine della precarietà infinita con un piano di stabilizzazione”.\n“Lo sfruttamento anche in questo caso si regge sulla precarietà e l’abuso di contratti a tempo determinato che non sono giustificati da nessuna esigenza temporanea. Per eludere i limiti di legge, i lavoratori vengono lasciati a casa per poche settimane, per essere di nuovo assunti con un contratto a scadenza”.\n“Lo sciopero proseguirà per tutta la giornata di oggi. E il 2 aprile si svolgerà un tavolo di trattativa a cui abbiamo richiesto la partecipazione anche di Pregis. Lo stato di agitazione continuerà finché non verranno riconosciuti ai lavoratori i loro diritti essenziali”.",

Most areas of the capital recorded an Air Quality Index (AQI) over 350, raising health concerns.\nAt the India Gate, where the AQI stood around 317 post-Diwali, a cyclist commented, “Because of the pollution, terrible things are happening. It came on very suddenly this time. Just a few days ago, there was nothing, and now my brother has fallen sick. I used to come here to cycle with him, but he has been severely affected by the pollution lately. And today, the pollution is extreme.”\nAround 7 am, Anand Vihar recorded an AQI of 395, Aya Nagar stood at 352, Jahangirpuri at 390, and Dwarka reached 376—each reporting “very poor” air quality, posing significant health risks.\nThe pollution problem extended beyond Delhi; several cities across India, including major metros like Chennai and Mumbai, reported similar post-Diwali conditions, with smog and poor air quality impacting large areas.\nData from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) highlighted the serious impact of pollution, particularly following the Diwali celebrations, raising concerns about air quality and public health nationwide.\nAdvertisement\nDelhi IMD Pollution Related posts # Cities Mayor Dr Shelly Oberoi takes stock of sanitation operations across Delhi The Mayor ordered an immediate cleanup of all vulnerable points in the city.",

    "text": "A winter lover's lament: No snow or cold, now what do I do? [Keith Uhlig](https://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/staff/4383061002/keith-uhlig/) It happened in a split second. One moment I was happily pedaling my bicycle on my favorite pathway along the Wisconsin River; the next I was lying on the ground, my legs tangled in the frame of my vintage Specialized Sirrus road bike. What happened? A quick appraisal determined that as I was turning through a bend on [Wausau's River Edge Parkway](https://www.wausauwi.gov/your-government/engineering/bicycling-and-walking), I hit a stretch of thin, invisible ice. The front wheel went to my right, my body went to the left and there I was, sprawling on the pavement. Every Wisconsin cyclist who rides through the winter months can expect these kinds of mishaps. Winter biking, while not quite edging into what I consider unreasonably dangerous territory, isn't safe, either. So I take on some blame for insisting on riding on Dec. 28. But in this case, the bulk of the fault rests on our unseasonably mild winter conditions. Why? Because with temperatures hovering around the freezing mark, most of the roads were wet but had plenty of traction. But this area of the River Edge Parkway, which runs adjacent to Wausau's [world-class whitewater course](/story/news/local/2022/08/23/whitewater-park-wausau-upgrades-more-freestyle-kayaking/10312510002/), features smooth and slick decorative concrete that was also, somehow, colder than the blacktop of most of the pathway. The whitewater course, which should be 80% iced over by now, is completely open and free. So there's bound to be more moisture covering the nearby surfaces. The result? Crash. It is unseemly to complain about moderate, comfortable weather conditions in the midst of a Wisconsin winter. But [these are unprecedented times](/story/news/local/2023/12/26/green-bay-christmas-hits-highest-temperatures-in-recorded-history/72031864007/). Ordinarily, I would be embracing this season with gusto, embracing [snow-covered trails through our forests on Nordic skis](/story/life/be-wisconsin/2022/03/10/american-birkebeiner-ernie-st-germaine-wisconsin-has-skied-every-race-since-1973/9341877002/). If there was no snow, I would be [wild skating on the area's river backwaters, lakes and ponds](/story/news/2020/12/15/nordic-skating-adventures-wild-ice-wisconsin/3858336001/). Beating the winter blues I dreaded winter for most of my life. I would plunge into a pit of gloom each February. My self-prescribed antidote is to [go outside for some form of exercise every day](/story/news/2019/03/18/wisconsin-outdoor-exercise-why-exercised-outside-every-day-year/2886141002/) and embrace the opportunities only winter has to offer, and I start looking forward to cross-country skiing and ice skating sometime in September, giving myself weeks to get psyched up for cold and snow. Which leads me all to the question: What do I do now? I'm feeling a bit unmoored by the cognitive dissonance of it all. The old winter-hating Keith would be rejoicing. Now I'm just floundering. And worrying, to be honest. While meteorologists say this bout of warm weather is related to El Niño, a short-term blip in weather patterns, one can't help but think of the long-term impact of the warming global climate. Whenever I start thinking about that particular problem, I immediately stop myself. It's just too big to grapple with on my own, other than trying limit the amount of pollution I create. Meanwhile, my aim is to make the most of each day, no matter the weather. For help on that front, I called [Minocqua Winter Park](https://www.minocquawinterpark.org/), a Northwoods cross-country skiing destination, to find out what winter lovers are doing up there. The park has no snow, I was told, but people were welcome to come for hiking, running and disc golf. Dan Clausen, the owner of the park's ski shop, said temperatures have been cold enough near Minocqua to allow him and other wild ice skaters to glide across area lakes. He didn't want to say which lakes, because conditions can change quickly. But, he said, forecasts call for a dose of colder weather through the New Year's holiday. \"I'm predicting world-class ice skating,\" Clausen said. Ooo. I feel better already, and I predict I'll be driving north sometime this holiday weekend, looking for ice-covered lakes. Take a cold-water plunge? I also spoke with Ben Ruyle of Baraboo. Ruyle is an ultramarathoner and [cold-water plunger](https://breakthrough-pt.com/blog/top-6-benefits-of-cold-plunges/) who hates hot weather and loves the cold. He's bummed there hasn't been any lasting snow so far this season, but he's also recovering from ankle surgery, so he hasn't been able to get out much anyway. But he said he will soon be jumping into the Baraboo River or nearby Devil's Lake. He's found that submerging his body to his neck for about five minutes leaves him feeling great, once he passes the initial shock of a cold-water dunk. \"I like to do things that are mentally tough,\" Ruyle said. \"I want to be comfortable doing things that are uncomfortable.\" Counterintuitively, the milder weather might extend his cold-water dunks. There's no ice to get through. Even so, he's hoping for snow and cold. \"I love winter,\" he said. \"And snow is beautiful.\" Although I've read about cold-water plunges and have jumped into cold water from time to time, I haven't felt the pull to do it on a regular basis. Talking with Ruyle has me thinking. Maybe? Probably not. My comfort level with discomfort is not as strong as Ruyle's. I won't rule it out, though. More trail running could be an antidote Maybe I will need to incorporate more trail running into my outdoor routine. Although I regularly jog around my neighborhood, I might be better served to get out on the bare cross-country ski trails at the nearby [Nine Mile County Recreation Area](https://www.marathoncounty.gov/Home/Components/FacilityDirectory/FacilityDirectory/134/164), like some other Wausau-area Nordic fanatics do. Rachel and Greg Kresse are top-notch Wausau-area Nordic skiing coaches and athletes. When I talked to Rachel about how they are coping with the warm weather, she sounded crestfallen. Last year by this time, she said, she and Greg had skied a dozen times. The Wausau area didn't have enough snow for skiing at that point, but they regularly traveled north, often to Michigan's Upper Peninsula, to get their ski legs. This year not even the U.P. has had consistent snow. So the Kresses are lifting weights and walking with ski poles. Greg is doing \"hill bounds\" with his poles on Nine Mile's ski trails. \"What else can you do?\" Rachel said. Wait. We can wait for snow. It's bound to come, right? It has to come. Meanwhile, I plan to add in some trail running to my regular jogs, and keep riding bikes. And doing my best to keep the wheels down and my body upright.
