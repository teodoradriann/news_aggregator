    "title": "Flooding: Retirement home in the district of Gifhorn evacuated, people in Meppen rescued with tractor - Teller Report",
    "text": "In parts of Germany, people are still struggling with the effects of the continuous rain. Lower Saxony, which has been severely affected, has asked the Bundeswehr for support. The water level measured on Friday morning continued to exceed the highest alert level in many areas. Fears of a storm surge have not yet been confirmed, said state fire director Dieter Rohrberg. The flood situation varies from region to region, and no all-clear can yet be given for the whole of Lower Saxony. Interior Minister Daniela Behrens (SPD) said that the focus of the floods had shifted from the southeast to the northwest of the country in recent days with the water masses. A retirement and nursing home in Müden (Aller) in the district of Gifhorn has been evacuated because water has penetrated the house. 13 residents were taken out of the home, said Horst Kraemer, head of the Gifhorn district association of the German Red Cross (DRK). On Thursday, volunteers from the German Red Cross and the volunteer fire brigade had already accommodated around 20 residents in other retirement homes. In Meppen (Emsland), five people were rescued from a house surrounded by water with the help of a tractor. Initially, the fire department tried to rescue the people from the house with a boat, said a spokesman for the fire department. A farmer was finally able to drive his trekker through the water and use the trailer to get the trapped people out of the house. According to the report, the farmer was on site because he was transporting sandbags for security and offered his help. Appeal for voluntary renunciation of firecrackers A ban on firecrackers has been issued in some flood regions – for example in parts of Bremen and the municipality of Lilienthal in the district of Osterholz. Environment Minister Christian Meyer (Greens) appealed for a renunciation of New Year's Eve firecrackers in the areas affected by the floods. As a result, fewer missions could be required for the heavily stressed forces. The district of Osterholz fears that many onlookers will be out and about in the flood area on New Year's Eve. \"Please be considerate of the people and their belongings in the affected area and do not enter these areas,\" appealed District Administrator Bernd Lütjen (SPD). The work of the emergency services should not be made even more difficult. \"There are plenty of other ways to go for a walk on New Year's Eve weekend in our county.\" Animals are also still threatened due to the flooding. With an emergency plan, Serengeti Park Hodenhagen is preparing for further evacuations of animals. Of particular concern is the house of antelopes and giraffes, which is surrounded by water, said a spokeswoman for the zoo. \"These animals would have to be anesthetized for evacuation, which is a big risk.\" In several regions of Brandenburg, the flood situation has calmed down. According to the State Environment Agency, only light precipitation is expected until New Year's Day. On the Lusatian rivers such as the Neisse and the Black Elster, the all-clear was given. Elbe near Wittenberge continues to rise The Spree, on the other hand, remains under observation, it said. At individual gauges, there could be short-term but uncritical exceedances of the guideline values of alert level 1. For the flood wave in the Oder, no aggravation is to be expected for Ratzdorf and Eisenhüttenstadt. However, the water level of the Elbe in Wittenberge in the district of Prignitz is likely to rise further. On Saturday, alert level 2 of a total of four levels will therefore be declared, the State Office for the Environment announced. The city made preparations for a swelling of the flood water and has a guard service on hand to check on the dike. The authorities do not expect the situation to develop dramatically. The water level at the Wittenberge gauge on Friday afternoon was 5.20 metres. According to the forecast of the State Environment Agency, the water level should not exceed 6 meters until New Year's Day. Rivers had previously burst their banks, especially in the foreland of the dike. Farmers had to take their animals from the meadows. The Nedwighafen on the banks of the Elbe in Wittenberge, where caravans are usually located, was flooded with mud and water. The flooding on the Elbe also affected the construction work on the new A14 bridge between Brandenburg and Saxony-Anhalt. Due to the risk of flooding, construction workers had to move some office containers to safety. Circus is allowed to stay The city of Dresden in Saxony has lifted alert level 3 due to the Elbe flooding. Alert level 1 is now expected to apply until January 2, the administration announced. Originally, it had been predicted that the Elbe would reach a water level of six meters and more. This is the threshold for the second highest alert level 3. On Thursday, however, only a high of 5.95 meters was reached, since then the water has been sinking again. In the meantime, the Dresden Christmas circus, which is standing in a flume, is allowed to stay. The city had ordered the eviction because the circus had not voluntarily dismantled its tents. In view of the slight easing of flooding, an evacuation would now be disproportionate, said Eva Jähnigen, head of the environmental department. In North Rhine-Westphalia, the Ministry of the Environment is not giving the all-clear despite stagnating or falling water levels. \"We still have a major flood situation,\" said Environment Minister Oliver Krischer (Greens). So far, the consequences have remained manageable, no victims to mourn. There was no threat of dam failures or uncontrolled overflows at the dams. The flood protection systems would have held. However, the dikes have softened in many places. It had become clear that there was a need for renovation. bbr/dpa/AFP",

    "title": "Ru Cha Mangrove Forest: A sleeping beauty of Hue",
    "text": "Ru Cha is a rare and precious primary mangrove forest in Tam Giang lagoon, located in Thuan Hoa village, Huong Phong commune of Hue City. The name is originally from the tree type that grows in the place: a forest (RÚ) planted with trees named CHÁ; the tree has a favourable water environment here, it thrives, turning it into a forest, and only allows some species to live. Since then, the name RÚ CHÁ was born.\nTo get to Ru Cha, visitors should depart from the centre of Hue City, following National Road 49 to the direction of Thuan An beach, about 9 km. There should be a sign directing vehicles to go straight to Thuan An beach, then turn left and cross Tam Giang bridge, and Ru Cha is about 4km to reach. Ru Cha mangrove forest is extremely easy to access. Visitors can rent a car or travel by their own vehicle. Ideally, go to Ru Cha forest early in the morning and participate in activities, then rest, enjoy delicious seafood dishes around.\nRu Cha is “one of a kind” mangrove forest that exists in the Tam Giang lagoon system and each season, the mangrove forest has its own colour, sometimes it is green, sometimes it is dyed yellow to signal autumn, sometimes it’s covered in white when the leaves fall.\nRu Cha Forest in autumn is one of the most romantic destinations in Hue. Visitors who wish to admire the wild beauty and captivating golden autumn landscape, visit Ru Cha from the end of September through October. During this time, Ru Cha mangrove forest is covered with a brilliant array of yellow leaves, serving to create a peaceful scene for visitors to enjoy. Fall foliage in Ru Cha mangrove forest turns the place into a brilliant picture of autumn.\nActivities for the visitors in Ru Cha forest\nTrekking through the forest\nSummer is a perfect time for a leisure walk through the forest. Family and friends can also cycle along the path through the mangroves. Under the golden sunshine of summer, the whole place is much the opposite in winter. Slender Cha trees with large, long roots, embrace the smooth paved road. The grey-white colour of the trees interlace with rays of sunshine, fresh air, give visitors a feeling of relaxation and a peace in mind.\nFree your soul on the boat\nGoing all the way through the forest, a Ru Cha with an immense river, a large lake of fish, shrimp and aquaculture ponds appears. Riding on a small wooden boat is the most popular way to explore Ru Cha. Visitors can rent a boat and the boatman will take you to explore every nook and cranny. Venturing through clusters of towering mangroves, capturing gorgeous autumn scenery, with its soft colours and tranquil atmosphere. The boat lazily flows in the lake. A whole area turns quiet enough to hear the chirping of birds and sometimes fish darting under the water.\nRu Cha Forest is also the paradise to nature lovers since it is a home to thousands of species of flora and fauna. The sound of birdsong, insects and aquatic animals plays a soothing symphony that encapsulates the vibrant life of the forest.\nEnjoy gorgeous view from the observatory\nIn recent years, Ru Cha has caught the attention of many photographers and growing numbers of visitors show up to enjoy the mesmerising colours of the forest. The roads leading to here have been upgraded and a small observation deck has been built to give visitors a panoramic view of Ru Cha from above.\nFrom dusk til’ dawn, Ru Cha unfolds like a golden carpet with the hues of the golden leaves changing as the sun gradually rises and sets.",

    "text": "The Japanese Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) has officially ruled that Unit 2 of the Tsuruga nuclear power plant, located in Japan’s Fukui prefecture, is non-compliant with the country's new nuclear safety standards. The NRA justified its decision saying that the Tsuruga nuclear plant is situated above an active fault line, which is prohibited by Japan's nuclear guidelines. The Tsuruga Unit 2, which started commercial operations in 1987, went offline in May 2011. This disqualification is the first rejection of a reactor under safety standards that were enacted in 2013, following the 2011 Fukushima disaster. Japan Atomic Power, the operator of the nuclear plant, had hoped it could restart the 1 GW Unit 2, as it is already decommissioning Unit 1 at the power plant in 2015. The NRA had already refused the restart of Tsuruga-2 in August 2024. Two other units (3&4) were announced, but the project is currently frozen. In 2013, the NRA issued new nuclear safety rules that limited the number of operational nuclear reactors from 54 before the Fukushima accident to 12, and the share of nuclear in the power mix dropping from 25% in 2010 to 1% in 2015. In 2023, the share of nuclear rose its highest level since 2015 to 9%, with 33 GW of nuclear capacity, of which only 11 GW is currently in operation.

    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Newberry County, South Carolina from 1901-2000 was 44.0. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Newberry County, South Carolina experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895.

    "text": "La Delegación de Limpieza Viaria y RSU del Ayuntamiento de Barbate muestra su satisfacción por la obtención de la Bandera Verde de Sostenibilidad de Ecovidrio, un reconocimiento que premia el esfuerzo colectivo por el reciclaje de envases de vidrio y el compromiso con el desarrollo sostenible. Barbate ha rivalizado con 46 municipios andaluces, consiguiendo un total de 2.325 puntos que le han colocado en tercer lugar en el ranking de municipios españoles. Junto a Algeciras, que también ha sido premiado con este importante galardón, ha logrado una de las dos banderas que se otorgan en Andalucía, convirtiendo a la provincia de Cádiz en referente en reciclaje de vidrio. Esta puntuación se ha logrado gracias al desarrollo de una campaña de comunicación, difusión y concienciación, que ha incluido diversas acciones encaminadas a informar e implicar a la ciudadanía. Este reconocimiento llega tras meses de intenso trabajo en la campaña estival ‘Banderas Verdes’ de Ecovidrio, en la que la Delegación de Limpieza Viaria y RSU del Ayuntamiento de Barbate, que gestiona el edil Francisco Muñoz Jarillo, ha jugado un papel fundamental. Gracias a su implicación, junto con el compromiso de los hosteleros, Barbate ha logrado superar el reto y alzarse con esta distinción que subraya su compromiso con el reciclaje de envases de vidrio. La campaña ‘Movimiento Banderas Verdes’ de Ecovidrio ha contado este 2024 con la colaboración de 116 bares, restaurantes y chiringuitos del término municipal de Barbate, que han sido pieza clave para alcanzar este reconocimiento. De hecho, se ha logrado el reciclaje de un total de 144.500 kilos de vidrio durante los meses de junio, julio y agosto. “El compromiso de la ciudadanía en general ha sido esencial en la difusión de buenas prácticas y en el impulso del reciclaje en el municipio, lo que ha permitido sumar los puntos necesarios para conseguir este prestigioso galardón”, ha señalado el delegado de Limpieza Viaria y RSU del Ayuntamiento de Barbate, Francisco Muñoz Jarillo, quien ha destacado la gestión realizada para “el refuerzo de la contenerización, la colocación de los puntos de depósito y el trabajo de concienciación y contacto con los hosteleros”. El edil ha expresado su satisfacción por la consecución de este galardón, señalando que “esta Bandera Verde es una apuesta personal y una muestra clara de la implicación de Barbate con el reciclaje”. “Nuestro municipio ha demostrado, una vez más, que está a la altura de los grandes retos medioambientales; este premio nos motiva a seguir trabajando para cuidar nuestro entorno y asegurar un futuro más sostenible para todos”. Finalmente, Francisco Muñoz Jarillo ha felicitado al Ayuntamiento de Algeciras, a su alcalde, José Ignacio Landaluce, y a su concejal Javier Vázquez Hueso, por conseguir también la Bandera Verde de la Sostenibilidad de Ecovidrio. La entrega oficial de la Bandera Verde de Sostenibilidad tendrá lugar el próximo 30 de octubre en Madrid, en un acto organizado por Ecovidrio que reunirá a los municipios ganadores a nivel nacional y que estará presidido por la Directora General de Políticas Turísticas de la Secretaría de Estado de Turismo, Ana Muñoz Llabrés.",
