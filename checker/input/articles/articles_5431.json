    "text": "PERRYSBURG, Ohio (WTVG) - As our First Alert Weather coverage continues, it’s important to take care of yourself and your car in these extreme cold temperatures.With dangerous temperatures and wind chills in the forecast for the next couple of days, it’s important to be prepared. One of those steps is making sure your vehicle is ready to go out in the freezing temps.“Some of the most important things to do would be to just have your vehicle regularly serviced. Have the maintenance done. Make sure before it gets really cold, like it is now, that you’re having your tires checked, tire pressure, make sure your battery’s good, your fluids are topped off and all your exterior lights are working and that you’ve got a good set of wiper blades,” Matt Keber, the general manager of AAA in Perrysburg said.Keber says to plan for the worst, that way you’re ready for anything.“In those kinds of events, it’s always good to have something similar to this (an emergency road kit). Something that’s got some signs, a flashlight, maybe a strobe light, jumper cables. Things like that inside of here even a first aid kit is in this,” Keber said.Keber says some things to keep in mind are:- Have a hat, gloves, and warm coat on hand in case you were to get stuck and need them.- Try not to let your car get below half a tank of gas. Because if the vehicle stops running, so does the heat.- Make sure your phone is charged and have a way to charge it.The bottom line: have a plan to safely brace the cold.“When it’s cold like this, and we get these subzero temperatures, mix in some wind, the windchill is really what’s going to chill you. So make sure your outer extremities are covered ears, fingers, hands a good hat to make sure that you can hold that heat in and protect yourself. You don’t have to be out of your vehicle for very long with wind like this to end up with frostbite or really serious health concerns,” Keber said. See a spelling or grammar error in our story?

    "text": "Chandigarh, May 3 (PTI) Former Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Friday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has removed \"thorns\" like Article 370 and terrorism sown by the Congress and strengthened the country during his 10 years in power.The country made rapid progress under Modi while the Congress only gave hollow slogans, he said.Khattar was addressing a gathering in support of Mohan Lal Badoli, the BJP's Lok Sabha candidate from Sonipat, after he filed his nomination papers on Friday.This election is like a fight between the Kauravas and the Pandavas of the Mahabharata. The character of the Congress is like that of the Kauravas, said Khattar, who is contesting the polls from Karnal parliamentary seat.Under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi, the country is moving rapidly on the path of becoming a developed nation, he said.The Congress had sown \"thorns\" like Article 370, Naxalism and terrorism in the country during its rule of 55-60 years, the former chief minister alleged.\"Tukde-tukde gangs had become active during the Congress rule and the problem of Naxalism emerged during its rule. Prime Minister Modi removed these thorns in 10 years and strengthened the country,\" he said.\"For the Congress, the country was limited to its family and after independence, it was the Nehru family that ruled,\" he added.During the past 10 years, Khattar said, people have seen the work done by the BJP's double-engine government.The Congress only gave slogans like \"Garibi Hatao\" but did not take any steps for poverty alleviation, he said, adding that the Modi government brought 25 crore Indians out of poverty.The Congress does not have an organisational structure in Haryana and the party wants to win with mere slogans.He termed the Congress' Lok Sabha manifesto an \"expired cheque\".All 10 Lok Sabha seats in Haryana go to polls in the fifth phase of the elections on May 25.While the Congress is contesting nine seats, its INDIA bloc ally AAP has fielded its candidate from Kurukshetra constituency.

Le manifestazioni, che hanno visto una partecipazione straordinaria, con oltre il 90% degli operai di Fincantieri e Leonardo in astensione dal lavoro, sottolineano una crescente domanda di giustizia salariale e dignità lavorativa. In queste ore, Napoli si erge a simbolo di una battaglia per la rivendicazione dei diritti, uniti nel richiamo a una ristrutturazione del sistema occupazionale.La voce dei sindacati: il bisogno di cambiamentoGiovanni Sgambati, segretario regionale della Uil in Campania, ha spiegato, durante una manifestazione a Napoli, le ragioni alla base di questa mobilitazione. Sgambati ha messo in luce le difficoltà affrontate da un numero crescente di lavoratori precari, accentuate da un mercato del lavoro caratterizzato da episodi di lavoro clandestino e da un’ampia diffusione di datori di lavoro che violano i diritti contrattuali.Leggi su Gaeta.it\nGaeta.it - Grande mobilitazione in Campania: oltre il 90% per gli scioperi indetti da Fincantieri e Leonardo\n- Sciopero: Sgambati, in Campania c'è una grande mobilitazione\n- Carlo Marino scrive ai sindaci della Campania dopo la sua riconferma: \"Ecco quali saranno le nostre battaglie\"\n- Auto, dalla Campania 5mila a Roma per lo sciopero di venerdì\n- Metalmeccanici: Uliano a Caserta, oltre 10mila lavoratori coinvolti nelle crisi in Campania, noi non lasciamo sole le persone, la politica dove sta?\n- Crisi Gesco, Sergio D’Angelo: “Chiediamo la mobilitazione dei napoletani contro i licenziamenti”\n- NOCERA SUPERIORE.

    "text": "Nature lovers are urging national park visitors to have greater respect for wildlife as videos of overly curious tourists — commonly known as \"tourons\" — have been circulating on social media.\nTourons are considered to be tourists who are disrespectful to the rules and regulations of national parks, often putting themselves or wildlife in harm's way for a photo.\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by @touronsofnationalparks\nA post shared by Tourons of National Parks (@touronsofnationalparks) showed a large group of tourists standing just feet away from two large moose at Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado.\nThe video captured several tourists attempting to take videos or photos of the wild animals as they grazed on the greenery around them. The park visitor who took the video revealed they were quite worried about how close the group of tourists were to the animals.\n\"Trying to maintain at least 30 yards away,\" the visitor told the Instagram account . \"I did yell at the group standing there notifying them they were way too close as the moose kept approaching … wish I was still recording. The tourons really are so disheartening to observe.\"\nNational park employees have urged tourists to keep a distance of at least 25 yards away from moose at all times. Older moose are known to be protective of their young, endangering humans and other animals.\nWatch now: Allbirds director reveals details on world's first carbon-free shoe Officials have also warned that, unlike other animals, moose can blend well into their habitat and environment, such as forested areas. This can make it more difficult for humans to see them and makes it more important for park visitors to be aware of their surroundings. Getting too close to the moose can startle the wildlife , causing them to charge and potentially harm those nearby.\nNational parks provide some of the best landscapes and views of nature throughout the United States. But, it is important to respect the wildlife and animals that reside in these areas to keep them and us safe. By sticking to designated paths, visitors can also better protect the areas where these animals live, helping support the surrounding ecosystem.\nCommenters on the post were left frustrated by how close the tourists got to the wild moose.\n\"So scary. Moose are so fast!\" one wrote.\n\"Play at their own risk. Let them play,\" another said. \"Sometimes playing hurts and you learn. Shaming is just dumb behavior no matter what.\"\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips , and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.",

    "text": "\nWoodlands Weekend Weather & Events – January 12 - 14, 2024 – Enjoy it while you can\nTHE WOODLANDS, TX – It seems like 2024 is hitting the ground running, with a couple of days’ worth of sub-zero – in Centigrade – temperatures. The first (and hopefully only) big freeze of 2024 will hit us early next week. In the meantime, you can pretty much enjoy a relatively quiet weekend, weather wise, and still have time to wrap your pipes.\nWe’re already well past today’s high of 70, which started off the morning after Thursday’s oddly muggy day. Except for a brief uptick in the mid-afternoon, temps will continue to drop all day until we hit an ‘overnight’ low (in reality, tomorrow mid-morning) right around the freezing point. We’ll be sunny all day, and fortunately the winds that are gusting up to 30 mph will start to settle down but still ruffle the hair.\nEnjoy some community spirit by cheering on your favorite team in tonight’s basketball matchup between Willis and Conroe; you can go in person, or catch our livestream of the game from the comfort of your home.\nOn Saturday, the temps will soar more than 30 degrees in just seven short hours as we crest a high of 64 in the early afternoon. Some clouds will wander in to help trap some of the warmer air at ground level, and our low will stay several degrees above freezing. Fortunately, the blowing winds of Friday will be much quieter today.\nIt’s probably a perfect time to get some outdoor shopping for provisions, and The Woodlands Farmer’s Market at Grogan’s Mill has everything locally grown, created, and crafter that you might need.\nOn Sunday, we’ll continue to enjoy a second full day of temperatures above freezing, but the skies will foretell the storms to come. We here at the Woodlands Online Weather Office strongly encourage you to take the day to prepare your house and possessions for the freeze that’s about to come.\nChances are, schools will be closed at some point next week, so indulge the kiddos now by taking them to Learning Express Toys for their Pokemon Trade-and-Play Day.\nWe’ll be giving you constant updates as best as we can, but plan for some burst pipes and power outages early next week. We’ll manage to make it up to 51 or so for the Sunday high temperature under grey, cloudy skies that will most likely start dumping rain late in the evening. Fortunately, the winds will remain low and we’ll stay well above freezing, but still be safe if you venture away from the house.\nUnfortunately, it won’t be all unicorns and rainbows next week, and you’ll definitely be hoping for some warmer weather…\nStay tuned for weather updates from Woodlands Online, and be sure to check us out on Monday for our “Week Ahead” forecast.\n[Weather](section.cfm?sid=57) [\nWoodlands Weekend Weather & Events – January 5 - 7, 2024 – First weekend fun\n](/npps/story.cfm?nppage=77559) [\nWOODLANDS WEATHER THIS WEEK – July 24 - 28, 2023 – Back to the 90s\n](/npps/story.cfm?nppage=76347) [\nWOODLANDS WEEKEND WEATHER & EVENTS – September 22 - 24, 2023 – Can you feel the heat tonight?\n](/npps/story.cfm?nppage=76782) [\nWoodlands Weather This Week – January 2 - 7, 2024 – A running start to the new year\n](/npps/story.cfm?nppage=77530)",

Over 400 intending pilgrims in the first batch, including state officials, have been airlifted from the airport. A total of 3,223 intending pilgrims are expected to be airlifted for the exercise, with eight flights scheduled from Niger State. The state governor, Mohammed Umaru Bago, while addressing them before departure, prayed fervently for the state in particular and the country in general for peace and prosperity. He advised them to be good ambassadors of the state and the country while in the holy land, saying the state government had already paid 200 dollars per pilgrim for ram slaughtering (Hidiya). The governor also urged the intending pilgrims to desist from spending extravagantly while encouraging them to channel any challenge they might encounter to the State Amirul Hajj or the chairman of the Hajj Commission for appropriate action. In his remarks, the State Amirul Hajj and Emir of Kagara, Alh. Ahmed Attahiru Gunna II appreciated the governor for his tireless efforts to ensure the safe airlifting of intending pilgrims.
