    "text": "New Battery Chemistry From Nyobolt Promises Faster Charging For Electric Cars [daily news updates from CleanTechnica](https://mailchi.mp/cleantechnica/daily-newsletter)on email. Or [follow us on Google News](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLQgKIidDQklTRndnTWFoTUtFV05zWldGdWRHVmphRzVwWTJFdVkyOXRLQUFQAQ)! First, a disclaimer. News about battery breakthroughs for electric cars pours into the teletype machines located in the subbasement of CleanTechnica world headquarters on a daily basis (we recently transitioned away from using the telegraph). We parse that flood of information and try to select stories that seem to have relevance to the real world, but that doesn’t mean we don’t sometimes get taken in by some announcement that turns out to be mostly a flimflam. With that proviso, here is an interesting bit of news about [Nyobolt](https://nyobolt.com/), a battery company located in Cambridge, UK, that came to our attention a few days ago, courtesy of [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/01/cars/electric-car-battery-charge/index.html). The story goes like this: Nyobolt claims to have developed a battery that can be charged in five minutes or less and is durable enough to power an electric car for 600,000 miles of driving. Yes, there are some caveats and we will get to them shortly. The good news here is that what Nyobolt has done could address one of the primary complaints about driving electric cars — they [take too long to charge](https://cleantechnica.com/2023/11/05/study-reveals-effects-of-fast-charging-on-electric-car-battery-health/). Nyobolt has built a battery electric car that looks like a Porsche Boxster powered by a 35 kWh battery using the technology it has developed. Last week during a live presentation, it charged the battery in that car from 10% to 80% in 4.5 minutes using a 350 kW DC fast charger. There are no official statistics about how long it takes to pump a tank of gas, because it depends on how large the tank is that is being filled. But a typical gas tank in a car today has a capacity of 10 gallons or so and can easily be filled in about 5 minutes. Comparatively, long charging times are a major drawback of electric cars currently on the market. They slow down road trips and they’re an inconvenience for owners who can’t charge their cars at home, the company suggests. “Our extensive research here in the UK and US has unlocked a novel battery technology that is ready and scalable right now,” Nyobolt co-founder and CEO Sai Shivareddy said in a statement Friday. “We are enabling the electrification of new products and services currently considered inviable or impossible.” Nyobolt’s technology builds on a decade of research led by University of Cambridge battery scientist Clare Grey and Shivareddy, who attended Cambridge, according to the company. One key to its batteries being able to charge rapidly without a big impact on longevity is a design that generates less heat during charging. That feature makes for a safer battery as well, since overheating can lead to thermal runaway, the polite term for a battery fire. In addition, the materials used to make the Nyobolt battery anodes allow for a faster transfer of electrons. Nyobolt is currently in talks to sell its batteries to eight electric car manufacturers. At 35 kWh, the battery is much smaller than the 85 kWh in a more typical American electric vehicle, yet the technology may be used in larger battery packs in the future. The battery innovation by Nyobolt is particularly encouraging for commercial EV fleets and drivers relying on electric cars in their jobs, according to Paul Marchment, who is a consultant at Arval, a vehicle leasing specialist owned by BNP Paribas. Nyobolt & Charging Infrastructure Another barrier to faster adoption of electric cars in the United States and Europe is a lack of public charging infrastructure. Jack Evans, a motoring specialist at Blackball Media, told CNN he welcomed the news about the Nyobolt battery. Referring to the high power charger used in the public demonstration, he said, “The units used to charge the Nyobolt battery are few and far between in the UK, so in order for this to really make an impact, there needs to be an increase in the provision of ultra-rapid chargers.” Shivareddy told CNN the number of fast chargers was rising both in the US and the European Union, and that he expects to “pretty much have them everywhere” by the end of the decade. In North America, three out of four fast chargers are Tesla Superchargers, and virtually every big automaker in the US has committed to making EVs compatible with Tesla’s charging technology, known as the North American Charging Standard. The Nyobolt battery is compatible with a Tesla Supercharger, the company told CNN. “We would love to work with Tesla and other leading (manufacturers) to bring our vision to life — with the aim of making recharging times the same as refueling times,” Shivareddy said. “This would require industry to collaborate for the rollout of a large number of such high-power chargers, along with the grid/off-grid power supply.” Nyobolt Negatives Nyobolt claims its battery technology has been tested by a leading global manufacturer, who found that it could achieve over 4,000 fast charge cycles — equivalent to 600,000 miles (965,600 km) of driving while retaining more than 80% of its original capacity. “This is many multiples higher than the warranties of much larger EV batteries on the road today,” the company said in a statement. So, what’s the downside? William Kephart, an e-mobility specialist at consultancy P3 Group and a former engineer, told CNN that batteries like the one Nyobolt has developed could “theoretically” be charged as fast as the firm is promising, but the challenge was manufacturing such batteries on an industrial scale. A crucial chemical element in Nyobolt’s batteries is niobium. Kephart pointed out that last year only an estimated 83,000 metric tons of niobium were mined worldwide. By contrast 1.6 million metric tons of graphite, which is the most commonly used anode material in lithium-ion batteries, was produced in 2023. In addition, there are currently “a lot of unknowns” with the niobium battery technology, he told CNN. “The industry will work it out (but) it’s not seen by the industry as a scalable technology just yet,” he added. The Takeaway Battery technology continues to evolve. What is currently the standard of the world may be yesterday’s news tomorrow. [Sodium-ion batteries](https://cleantechnica.com/2023/12/29/electric-cars-powered-by-sodium-ion-batteries-go-on-sale-in-china/) are beginning to become available that promise better low temperature performance and less risk of thermal runaway. A variety of new cathode and anode materials are being tested. It is fair to say that niobium batteries are in their infancy and the low production of the mineral is a concern. But a few years ago, people worried that there was not enough lithium available, yet today there might actually be an oversupply of the stuff, which has sent prices tumbling. It seems safe to say that if Nyobolt is correct and niobium becomes a popular choice for the batteries in electric cars, production will ramp up just as it has with lithium. And it’s not like lithium mining doesn’t come with its own little kit bag of [environmental and cultural issues](https://cleantechnica.com/2024/06/26/lithium-mining-in-argentina-jobs-vs-environment/). An additional benefit is that a transition to niobium would undercut China’s near monopoly on lithium supplies, altering the geopolitics of battery manufacturing in ways that cannot be fully anticipated. Other companies like [Storedot](https://cleantechnica.com/2022/12/13/storedot-fast-charging-technology-validated-in-independent-testing/) are also claiming fast charging times for their batteries, so Nyobolt is not the only company pursuing that challenge. The upshot is that somebody is likely to come up with new battery technologies that disrupt the status quo. Will Nyobolt be that company? “We’ll see,” said the Zen master.

    "text": "Teure Unwetter\nSturm und Hagel: 1,3 Milliarden Unwetterschäden an Autos\nBerlin (dpa)\nManche Autos haben nur eine Delle, andere sind nur noch ein Schrotthaufen: Ein Unwetter kann genauso schwere Schäden anrichten wie ein Autounfall.\nUnwetter haben Versicherern im vergangenen Jahr Gesamtkosten von rund 1,3 Milliarden Euro verursacht. Insgesamt wurden dabei 340.000 Autos in Deutschland beschädigt, wie der Gesamtverband der Deutschen Versicherungswirtschaft (GDV) mitteilte. Die Schäden reichten demnach von kleinen Dellen und Kratzern bis zur Zerstörung durch umstürzende Bäume oder Überschwemmungen.\nDie tatsächliche Zahl der von Sturm und Hagel getroffenen Autos war noch höher, denn die Unternehmen zahlen Unwetterschäden nur für kaskoversicherte Fahrzeuge. Gesetzlich vorgeschrieben ist nur die Kfz-Haftpflicht. Diese deckt nur Schäden ab, die Autofahrer an anderer Leute Eigentum verursachen.\nSüddeutschland am schwersten getroffen\nDie Unwetterschäden an den kaskoversicherten Autos waren regional sehr ungleich verteilt: «Spitzenreiter» war mit großem Abstand Baden-Württemberg. Im Südwesten allein beschädigten Unwetter 133.500 Fahrzeuge, ein überdurchschnittlicher Anteil von mehr als einem Drittel. Die Kosten beliefen sich auf 530 Millionen Euro. An zweiter Stelle folgte Bayern mit 65.000 Auto-Unwetterschäden - wobei diese im Deutschlandvergleich mit durchschnittlich 4.300 Euro am teuersten ausfielen.\nLaut Verband war 2024 in dieser Hinsicht ein durchschnittliches Jahr. Allerdings steigen die Unwetterschäden im längerfristigen Vergleich. «Wir sehen in den letzten Jahren, dass einzelne Sturmzellen und Hagelschauer heftiger werden», sagte GDV-Hauptgeschäftsführer Jörg Asmussen.",

    "text": "Cambio climático\nEl nivel del Mediterráneo aumenta en las costas tres veces más rápido de lo previsto\nUn estudio italiano revela que el ritmo es preocupante y mucho más rápido de lo previsto\nEl nivel del mar Mediterráneo está subiendo en la costa tres veces más rápido de lo previsto \"y a finales de siglo pondrá en peligro las actividades humanas y las infraestructuras\", según un informe publicado hoy por el Instituto Nacional de Geofísica y Vulcanología italiano (INGV)\nEl informe, en el que también ha colaborado el Radboud Radio Lab del Departamento de Astrofísica de la Universidad de Radboud (Países Bajos), explica que las proyecciones actuales de aumento del nivel del mar, publicadas en 2021 por el Grupo Intergubernamental de Expertos sobre el Cambio Climático (Ipcc) están \"subestimadas a lo largo de las costas\".\n\"La subsidencia, es decir, el lento movimiento descendente del suelo debido a causas naturales o antropogénicas, desempeña un papel crucial en la aceleración de la subida del nivel del mar a lo largo de las costas, desencadenada por el calentamiento global desde 1880\", explica Marco Anzidei, investigador del INGV en una nota.\n\"Nuestros análisis muestran que, precisamente debido al hundimiento, en algunas zonas del Mediterráneo el nivel del mar está aumentando casi tres veces más rápido que en zonas estables \", añade Antonio Vecchio, investigador de la Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen y primer autor del estudio.\nA la luz de estas evidencias, el equipo de investigadores recalculó las proyecciones del IPCC hasta 2150 en 265 zonas del Mediterráneo, correspondientes también a los 51 mareógrafos de las redes internacionales de vigilancia, incluyendo en los análisis datos relativos al hundimiento.\n¿Los resultados muestran diferencias máximas y mínimas con respecto al informe del IPCC que oscilan, respectivamente, entre aproximadamente más 109 cm y menos 77 cm, con un valor medio superior en aproximadamente 8 cm ¿, explica Vecchio.\nSe explica que, según estos datos, \"aproximadamente 38.500 km2 de costas mediterráneas - de los cuales aproximadamente 19.000 km2 sólo en el sector norte de la cuenca - pronto estarán más expuestas al riesgo de inundaciones marinas, con los consiguientes mayores impactos sobre el medio ambiente, actividades humanas e infraestructuras\".\n\"Por lo tanto, es necesario tomar medidas concretas para apoyar a las poblaciones costeras, que serán cada vez más vulnerables al aumento del nivel del mar y a los mayores riesgos asociados a él a finales de este siglo y en el futuro\" , concluye el informe.\nTras los acuerdos con el PSOE",

    "text": "Avant la guerre chez elle dans la bande de Gaza, Hanane Bayouk a accouché de triplées à Jérusalem où elle les a vues à peine, contrainte de retourner dans le territoire palestinien. Aujourd'hui, elle redoute de \"mourir sans les embrasser\".Cette Palestinienne de 26 ans a donné naissance à Najoua, Nour et Najmeh le 24 août 2023 à l'hôpital Makassed, le plus important de Jérusalem-Est occupée et annexée par Israël, après sept ans d'un parcours FIV compliqué.Elle les a entraperçues dans leurs couveuses \"une demi-heure à peine\" et a dû faire les 80 km de route en sens inverse vers Gaza, qu'elle avait pu quitter en raison d'un permis spécial, délivré à un nombre très limité de Gazaouis pour raison de santé par Israël.Mon permis \"avait expiré et l'hôpital m'a dit de partir\", explique-t-elle.Il était convenu qu'elle revienne début octobre chercher ses filles après plusieurs semaines en couveuse parce que, même avant la guerre, les hôpitaux de Gaza, sous blocus israélien depuis 17 ans, n'avaient pas les équipements nécessaires. - \"Ca me rend folle\" -Le 5 octobre, elle a fait une nouvelle demande de permis. Mais deux jours plus tard, des commandos du mouvement islamiste Hamas faisaient exploser le terminal d'Erez, l'unique point de sortie de Gaza vers Israël.Ces commandos sont entrés en Israël et ont commis des attaques qui ont entraîné la mort de 1.199 personnes, en majorité des civils, selon un décompte de l'AFP basé sur des données officielles israéliennes.En représailles, Israël a lancé une vaste offensive à Gaza qui a fait plus de 40.000 morts, d'après le ministère de la Santé du gouvernement de Gaza, dirigé par le Hamas.Heba Idriss, elle aussi, ne peut retourner chercher son unique fille, Saida, née deux mois avant le début de la guerre à l'hôpital Makassed, à seulement 27 semaines de grossesse.Son mari, Saleh Idriss, lui n'a jamais vu le bébé. Il espérait que Heba puisse la ramener à l'automne chez eux à al-Shajaiya, dans le nord de la bande de Gaza.Mais, depuis un an, le couple, déplacé neuf fois par les ordres d'évacuation israéliens et les bombardements, n'a pu la voir qu'en photo sur un téléphone.\"Je veux voir ma fille, je souffre tellement d'être séparée d'elle\", lâche Heba Idriss, 37 ans, entre deux sanglots. Hanane Bayouk, elle, a dû fuir Khan Younès, dans le sud de la bande de Gaza, et a échoué sous une tente avec sept membres de sa belle-famille où elle passe désormais ses journées à se ronger les sangs.\"Ca me rend folle. J'ai mis tellement longtemps à tomber enceinte et maintenant je pleure tout le temps\", raconte-t-elle à l'AFP un jour où elle est enfin joignable, après des mois de déplacements, de coupures d'électricité et de réseau téléphonique précaire.\"Des fois, je me dis que je voudrais que mes filles rentrent à Gaza avant que je meurs parce que je ne les ai encore jamais embrassées, mais je me reprends et me dis que c'est mieux qu'elles soient en sécurité loin de la guerre\", raconte-t-elle.A Makassed, en temps normal, on n'aurait pas trouvé de place pour garder les triplées aussi longtemps, raconte à l'AFP le directeur du département des soins intensifs pour nouveaux-nés, le docteur Hatem Khammach.- \"Je pleure à chaque fois\" -Mais avec la guerre, l'établissement dispose de plus de places disponibles. Israël a en effet drastiquement diminué le nombre de permis de visite à Jérusalem des Palestiniens de Cisjordanie occupée et de Gaza. Et avec des check-points fermés plus fréquemment, même ceux dotés d'un permis peinent parfois à rejoindre la Ville sainte.\"Avant la guerre, nous avions sept ou huit bébés de Gaza dans notre service qui peut en accueillir 30 en même temps\", dit-il. Mais il n'en a plus reçu depuis le 7 octobre. \"Et beaucoup de malades de Cisjordanie ne parviennent plus jusqu'à nous\".Certains soignants téléphonent régulièrement à Hanane pour qu'elle parle à ses filles.\"Mon mari n'y arrive pas, moi je le fais et je pleure à chaque fois qu'on raccroche, j'ai peur que mes filles grandissent sans me connaître\", affirme-t-elle.Mais si son esprit est à Jérusalem, son corps, lui, n'en finit pas de subir la peur, la soif et la faim à Gaza.A quoi s'ajoutent désormais les risques de gale, de varicelle, d'éruptions cutanées et de poux, disent des médecins sur place.\"Et ici, il n'y a aucun médicament\", soupire Hanane.",

    "text": "Leadership from Egg Innovations is pioneering the industry as the first company committed to utilize the in-ovo sexing technology, eliminating male chick culling.\nWARSAW, Ind. , April 4, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- As the continuous leader in animal welfare within the egg industry, Egg Innovations has committed to furthering its mission by being the first U.S. based company committed to implementing in-ovo sexing technology to populate their family farms. Introducing in-ovo sexing, which is only available in Europe today, Egg Innovations is determined to be the catalyst to help eliminate chick culling within the American egg industry.\nContinue Reading\nJohn Brunnquell , Ph.D., Founder and CEO of Egg Innovations, states, \"Humane care is the ethos in which Egg Innovations was founded. Humane care is centric to our mission, this commitment to in-ovo sexing is a huge step as we will be able to label our products 'free of chick culling.' While it's an unknown if the market is ready to embrace this, we know it's the right thing to do. We are excited to trailblaze with this technology in the U.S. for the well-being of our products, customers, and industry.\"\nEgg Innovations is pioneering the industry as the first company committed to utilize the in-ovo sexing technology.\nPost this By utilizing this in-ovo sexing technology, Egg Innovations will be able to implement practices for more humane egg production that avoids the practice of male chick culling. While Egg Innovations' present practices for raising chickens with higher-welfare standards starts with young hens at a day of life, this commitment allows them to extend the company's humane care mission to the egg before hatching. This is a true integration of a more ethical life cycle for egg production as Egg Innovations extends their commitment to \"Chickens. People. Planet.\" Egg Innovations plans to utilize their regenerative farming Helpful Hens™ brand as the vehicle to introduce this ethical commitment to egg consumers nationwide in 2025.\nRobert Yaman , CEO of Innovate Animal Ag said, \"We are excited to see Egg Innovations recognize the powerful business proposition of selling eggs produced without culling in the U.S. market. The introduction of in-ovo sexing technology will allow for specialty egg producers to create a new higher-margin category of more ethical eggs that will be better for the chicks, producers, and consumers. This is a large step towards eliminating chick culling in the U.S. egg industry.\"\nThis matters to animal care and celebrates what leadership in animal welfare looks like.\nNancy Roulston , Senior Director of Corporate Policy and Animal Science, ASPCA Farm Animal Welfare said, \"For decades now, billions of newly hatched male chicks have been culled every year—making this one of the most urgent farm animal welfare issues today. Now that in-ovo sexing technology is commercially available, we can envision a future that renders the routine culling of male chicks obsolete in egg production. We are thrilled that Egg Innovations has committed to just that, and we urge others across the egg industry to adopt this groundbreaking technology to advance animal welfare.\"\nIn-ovo sexing is available through innovative new technologies where the sex of a chicken egg can be determined while it's still developing, so that only females are hatched. Egg Innovations' mission for over 20 years is founded in expanding and investing in a more humane way to care for chickens.\nEgg Innovations is the pioneer in humane care for the laying hen industry and now the first egg producer to bring certified regeneratively farmed free range and pasture-raised eggs to a commercial scale. Additionally, Egg Innovations has been named the 2024 Ethical Farming Company of the Year and Most Sustainable Egg Farming Business 2023 – USA . Egg Innovations leads the way in regenerative agriculture practices and the ethical treatment of animals as the world's leader in 100% Free Range and Pasture-Raised eggs. With more than 100 family farms and thousands of acres of pastureland dedicated to egg-laying hens, Egg Innovations provides premium eggs under the Blue Sky Family Farms and Helpful Hens brands, which are American Humane Certified™, Certified Humane®, and recognized by the ASPCA®'s Shop With Your Heart Program, in addition to a strong private label business.\nInnovate Animal Ag is a 501(c)3 nonprofit think tank that promotes technology as a practical way to improve animal health and welfare while also restoring consumer trust in animal agriculture. We conduct research on cutting-edge technologies that can improve animal health and welfare, then publish high-quality, science-backed resources to demystify the technologies for business leaders and policymakers. We then work directly with the companies developing and implementing these technologies to ensure they are rewarded for the important work they do.\nSOURCE Egg Innovations",

It not only provides a seamless experience but also understands the motivations and context behind user actions, enabling it to proactively identify and address root causes.\"\nRozieAI's AI Insurance Concierge Team empowers organizations to scale personalized service cost-effectively.

Built-in quality validation ensures accuracy, while continuous monitoring maintains response auditability.\n\"As our organization aimed for growth, our customer experience needed to evolve. RozieAI introduced us to their AI Insurance Concierge Team, enabling us to transition from traditional chatbots to AI agents,\" said Nick Brierly, Co-Founder and COO of Indigo Insurance. \"The AI Insurance Concierge Team allows us to unify everything into a seamless experience that understands user context and uncovers motivations while enforcing business rules.
