    "text": "Toronto: A 41-year-old Indian-origin man has been arrested in connection with multiple robberies at Hindu temples in the Canadian province of Ontario in recent months, police said. Jagdish Pandher from Brampton is facing charges for numerous offences and is currently being held for a bail hearing, the Durham Regional Police said on Thursday. Investigators have linked Pandher to numerous break-and-enters at Hindu temples throughout the year, most of which occurred in Durham Region and around the Greater Toronto Area. In a media release, police said that on October 8 at approximately 12:45 am its officers responded to reports of a break-and-enter in progress at a Hindu temple in the area of Bayly Street and Krosno Boulevard in Pickering. A male was seen on security surveillance breaking into the temple and taking a large quantity of cash from the donation boxes, the release said, adding that he fled the area prior to police arrival. He was seen on surveillance footage later that morning committing additional break-and-enters at Hindu temples in Pickering and Ajax. “Although these offences occurred at places of worship, they do not appear to be hate crimes or motivated by hate,” Durham Regional Police said. At least six Hindu temples were reportedly robbed in the month of September and October alone, mostly in the Greater Toronto Area, which included the Chintpurni Temple in Brampton, Rameshwar Mandir in Caledon and the Hindu Heritage Centre in Mississauga. According to local media reports, last year, close to half-a-dozen Hindu temples in the Greater Toronto Area were reportedly robbed in a span of ten days. The Peel police in Toronto arrested three Canada-based Punjabi men in 2022 responsible for vandalism and theft in Hindu temples in the Greater Toronto Area from November 2021 until March 2022. Pandher was one of the three accused, which also included Gursharnjeet Dhindsa and Parminder Gill from Brampton. They were slapped with as many as 78 charges including Disguise with intent (13 counts each) and Break, enter and commit an indictable offence (13 counts each), according to media reports.",

    "text": "Arriverà una nuova pandemia dopo il Covid. Non si può fare finta che non accadrà. La virologa Ilaria Capua mette tutti in guardia . E aggiunge che potrebbe trascorrere meno tempo del previsto prima che il mondo debba affrontare questa nuova sfida medica e sanitaria globale. La scienziata ha rilasciato una intervista a Repubblica.\nLe previsioni Impossibile prevedere il momento con esattezza, ma tutti gli elementi dicono che questo fatto si verificherà. Sicuramente ci vorrà qualche anno, ma il nuovo Covid, chissà come si chiamerà, arriverà e terrà in scacco, almeno per un periodo, tutti quanti. Ci sarà bisogno di uno sforzo collettivo non indifferente della ricerca, per sviluppare vaccini e terapie innovative. «Non possiamo permetterci di abbassare la guardia - dice la virologa - Ogni momento è cruciale per rafforzare la nostra capacità di risposta».\nMalattia X, Ilaria Capua: \"Ci sarà un'altra pandemia e sarà più pesante del Covid\" 20 Marzo 2024\nIl mondo interconnesso La guardia deve restare alta, anche perché il mondo è sempre più interconesso, globalizzato e quello che si verifica a migliaia di chilometri di distanza, in brevissimo tempo ha influenze anche molto lontano.\nL’antibiotico resistenza Non solo. Un altro fattore è fondamentale e da tenere sotto controllo: la sempre maggiore antibiotico resistenza , ovvero una delle minacce più gravi per la salute globale. L'utilizzo sempre più ampio e in tanti casi sbagliato (senza controllo medico: per questo è necessario assumere questi farmaci soltanto dopo consiglio degli esperti e mai autonomamente) di antibiotici ha portato un aumento importante delle infezioni resistenti e questo può portare a estreme difficoltà di curare le persone. Le infezioni che non rispondono più agli antibiotici possono trasformarsi in epidemie. Con tutte le conseguenze del caso . Fondamentale dunque anche «tracciare le resistenze degli antibiotici e intervenire tempestivamente», ha detto la virologa Capua.\nCapua: “Sanità, tagliare i fondi è un autogol. Così l’Italia si impoverisce” flavia amabile 02 Gennaio 2024\nL’attenzione globale Importante, dunque, che la popolazione sia sempre più consapevole di tutti questi rischi e che adotti comportamenti più responsabili, anche per limitare il pericolo che eventuali virus si diffondano e possano portare pandemie. E investire nella ricerca, che è un'arma fondamentale per il futuro di tutti.\nQuesto è un articolo a pagamento, ma oggi te lo regaliamo.\nBuona lettura!

    "title": "Explosion Heard In Ukraine's Capital, Air Alerts Issued, Says Mayor Vitali Klitschko",
    "text": "Online air alert notification system was issued. (Representational) Russia launched a wave of missile strikes on Friday across Ukrainian cities, including the capital, authorities said as they raised a nationwide air alert. The overnight attacks came days after Ukraine struck a Russian warship in the occupied Crimean port of Feodosia. Explosions were reported in Kyiv, city mayor Vitali Klitschko said in a post on Telegram. Missiles also struck at least five other Ukrainian cities, including Kharkiv in the northeast, Lviv in the country's west as well as Odesa in the south, the cities' mayors and police said. \"Today, at five o'clock in the morning, the fascists' followers hit the peaceful city with S-300 missiles. 10 explosions rang out in Kharkiv. Specialized services quickly arrived at strike spots,\" Kharkiv region police said. Overnight attacks were also reported in Sumy and Konotop. In southern Odesa, a high-rise building caught fire after being struck by debris from a downed drone, the city's mayor said. \"As a result of another enemy attack, one of the high-rise buildings was damaged. The fire was promptly extinguished,\" mayor Gennady Trukhanov said in a social media post. The attacks came after Kremlin on Tuesday acknowledged a Ukrainian attack had damaged a warship in the occupied Crimean port of Feodosia in what Ukraine and its Western allies called a major setback for the Russian navy. Ukraine has said its air force destroyed the Novocherkassk landing ship, with President Volodymyr Zelensky joking on social media that the vessel had now joined \"the Russian underwater Black Sea fleet\". Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu informed \"about the damage to our large landing ship\" to President Vladimir Putin in \"a very detailed report\". Russia's defence ministry said that the ship was damaged by guided aerial missiles. Ukraine's military said its air force destroyed the Russian naval ship in a missile attack on the eastern Crimean port. On Thursday, Zelensky thanked the United States for releasing the last remaining package of weapons available for Ukraine under existing authorisation, as uncertainty surrounds further aid to his war-torn country. Zelensky had warned that any change in policy from the US -- Kyiv's main backer -- could have a strong impact on the course of the war. \"I thank President Joe Biden, Congress, and the American people for the $250 million military aid package announced yesterday,\" Zelensky said on social media. Promoted Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com \"To defend freedom and security not only in Ukraine and Europe but also in the United States, we must continue to respond to ongoing Russian aggression,\" he said.

He has also received massive support from his ardent fans, who believe WWE did him dirty on his way out.\n× Feedback Why did you not like this content?

He completed his MBA from the Symbiosis Institute of Telecom Management in 2016 and worked with multiple banking institutions, including Tech Mahindra. While he started writing WWE articles for Sportskeeda in 2019 as a hobby, it eventually became a significant part of his professional journey.\nAbhilash checks his articles thrice before sending them to the editing team, ensuring his work is highly accurate and reliable.\nHe has interviewed prominent pro wrestling personalities like Noam Dar, Angry Miz Girl, Brendan Cobbina, and Jesse Lambert. Abhilash is a big fan of AEW star Orange Cassidy, as he believes the former International Champion’s on-screen gimmick of an extremely lazy guy resonates with him.\nGiven the opportunity to script WWE’s next big storyline, Abhilash would treat fans to the second installment of The Bloodline Civil War. He would book Roman Reigns to re-form The Bloodline with The Usos and Sami Zayn upon his comeback. The angle would see The Tribal Chief-led group go head-to-head with The Rock, Solo Sikoa, Tama Tonga, and Jacob Fatu in a blockbuster family feud.\nWhen not reporting on pro wrestling, Abhilash likes to work out, go on walks, read, and explore new eateries.\nKnow More Big issue with Penta revealed HERE.",

    "title": "Una ONG denuncia la muerte de 14 personas en una zódiac al sur de Canarias - Diario de Ibiza",
    "text": "Al menos catorce personas han muerto ahogadas en una zódiac cuyos ocupantes llevan pidiendo auxilio desde las 14.00 horas de este jueves desde un punto del Atlántico situado a unos 55 kilómetros de Cabo Bojador, en la costa marroquí del Sáhara Occidental, al sur de [Canarias](/tags/islas-canarias/), porque su barca se desinfla y se hunden. Es la denuncia que realiza la activista Helena Maleno, fundadora de Caminando Fronteras, ONG que lleva toda la tarde de este jueves en contacto con los náufragos y que ha transmitido su posición a las autoridades españolas y marroquíes para que movilicen medios de rescate. Por la localización del incidente, ha asumido la emergencia Rabat. Maleno ha facilitado a EFE una foto enviada por los supervivientes que todavía siguen a flote, una imagen nocturna y borrosa en la que se ve a entre seis y siete personas sentadas a horcajadas sobre un flotador de una neumática, doblado y medio deshinchado. Y también un audio que le ha remitido una de las ocupantes de la patera. En él se escucha a una mujer decir en francés: \"Estamos aquí, Helena. Soy una mujer embarazada de nueve meses, estoy en el flotador (de la zódiac). Todos los chicos del medio (de la embarcación) han desaparecido, la gente está desapareciendo, hasta ahora no hemos visto a la Marina\". \"Toda la gente está desapareciendo. ¡Por favor ayúdennos, ayúdennos! ¡Estamos aquí, ayúdennos! Estamos sentados así en el flotador (se refiere a la imagen que adjunta con el audio). Es muy peligroso, el agua está entrando\", se lamenta la mujer Helena Maleno ha explicado a EFE que, según la información que han recabado sobre esa neumática, se trata de un grupo de 58 personas que salieron el miércoles desde la costa del Sahara hacia Canarias y que ahora se encuentran al suroeste de Cabo Bojador. Entre ellos, añade, hay siete mujeres (incluyendo a la embarazada) y dos niños. La portavoz de Caminando Fronteras denuncia que, hasta el momento, Marruecos no ha hecho llegar ayuda a los ocupantes de esa neumática, ni tampoco Salvamento Marítimo español ha intervenido. Por eso, expresa su temor a que ocurra lo mismo que el 21 de junio, cuando varias personas murieron al hundirse una zódiac al sur de Gran Canaria después de pasar toda la noche esperando a que llegara una patrullera de Marruecos, porque la emergencia la había asumido el Centro de Coordinación de Salvamento de Rabat. Y ello, a pesar de que un barco de rescate español había estado a solo una hora de distancia de navegación de ellos, socorriendo a otra patera, cuando ya se conocían sus coordenadas. Ese suceso dio lugar una denuncia de la Fiscalía de Canarias por presunto delito de omisión del deber de socorro contra los responsables del operativo en España, denuncia que desde este verano instruye un Juzgado de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, que ha declarado secretas las actuaciones.",
