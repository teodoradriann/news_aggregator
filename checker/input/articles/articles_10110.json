    "text": "Son nom est Leevi Merilainen. Le jeune portier de 22 ans est tout simplement intraitable depuis son rappel dans la Ligue nationale de hockey (LNH). «Il s’est vraiment bien adapté à la vitesse du jeu, surtout lors de ses trois derniers matchs. Il a l’air tellement calme et confiant devant son filet», a confié l’entraîneur-chef Travis Green.\nLa recrue affiche un dossier de cinq victoires et deux revers en sept rencontres cette saison. Ses statistiques personnelles sont tout aussi étincelantes avec une moyenne de buts alloués de 1,99 et un pourcentage d’arrêts de ,925.\n«Il tout simplement génial, a affirmé l’attaquant Drake Batherson. C’est un gars assez détendu, surtout pour un jeune gardien de but qui arrive. C’est aussi de cette façon qu’il joue. Même avant les matchs, il est assez calme. C’est un gardien spécial et il joue incroyablement bien.»\nLors de ses trois derniers départs, le Finlandais s’est surpassé. Il n’a accordé que deux buts aux puissants Stars de Dallas en plus de blanchir les Islanders de New York et les Penguins de Pittsburgh. Ottawa est d’ailleurs l'équipe qui a signé le plus de blanchissage cette saison avec sept.\n«Il est vraiment impressionnant. Son calme et sa confiance en lui, c’est vraiment agréable à voir. À seulement 22 ans, je n’ai jamais vu un gardien jouer de cette manière», a expliqué l’attaquant Shane Pinto.\nMerilainen respire la confiance actuellement. Celle-ci semble inébranlable, mais également contagieuse alors que ses coéquipiers jouent sans complexe devant lui.\n«Il ne parle pas beaucoup, mais je pense qu’il est tout simplement extrêmement mature. Pendant le match, tu le sais que même si un but est encaissé, il arrive à se ressaisir très rapidement. Je pense que c’est important pour un gardien de but. C’est vraiment impressionnant ce qu’il fait présentement», a mentionné Pinto.\nDes nouvelles en rafales\nAprès avoir reçu une rondelle au visage lors du dernier match, Thomas Chabot s’absentera pour la rencontre de jeudi soir face aux Capitals de Washington. Fraîchement rappelé des Senators de Belleville, l’Ottavien Donovan Sebrango effectuera ses débuts dans la LNH dans sa ville natale.\n«C’est exactement ce à quoi je rêvais en grandissant de jouer mon premier match à Ottawa, a souligné le défenseur de 23 ans. Je n’ai pas encore pris totalement conscience de ce qui va se dérouler ce soir. J’ai travaillé toute ma vie pour arriver à ce moment. Je suis excité de vivre cette expérience avec ma famille et mes coéquipiers.»\nL’attaquant Michael Amadio sera de retour dans la formation, lui qui est absent depuis le 21 décembre dernier en raison d’une blessure.\nDans le cas du Québécois David Perron, il s’approche tranquillement d’un retour au jeu. Le vétéran de 36 ans a été limité à seulement neuf rencontres cette saison.",

    "text": "You don’t need weights — these 5 bodyweight moves will sculpt your upper body\nLifting weight is not the only answer to building upper body strength. Using your body weight as a form of resistance is a great alternative to weight training. You just need to find the right exercises to effectively challenge your upper body muscles and look to implement progressive overload into your training to keep up your strength gains.\nTo help you get started, here’s a five move routine from fitness trainer, Joey Bronston. Since it’s a fuss free no equipment workout, the main thing you’ll need to consider before jumping into the upper body exercises is space and comfort.\nYou’ll need enough space to stretch your body out lengthways on the floor and you’ll want to place something padded underneath you, such as one of the best yoga mats, especially if you will be working out on a particularly hard surface.\nReady to see a breakdown of the routine? Keep reading to find out.\nWhat is the 5-move no equipment workout? This is an fairly straightforward workout to follow. You will complete 10 reps of all fve exercises and repeat the full circuit three times over. Bronston doesn’t mention any rest periods but don’t let this stop you from adding in your own break periods.\nWatch the video below for demonstrations of each exercise.\nIf you don’t have the spare cash to fork out on a gym membership or, you don’t enjoy training with weights, then you’ll lap up the simplicity and convenience that a bodyweight workout can bring.\nHaving the ability to perform a bodyweight workout anywhere also lessens the chance of talking yourself out of exercise, seeing as you can’t use the excuse of not having the right equipment or access to a gym to get moving.\nAdditionally, bodyweight exercises tend to be more joint-friendly compared to heavy weightlifting, making them safer for those with joint issues or those recovering from injury.\nWhile some may question whether bodyweight exercises can effectively build upper body muscle, the answer is yes, they can. As long as you are working to gradually and continually increase the intensity or volume of exercises in your bodyweight training, you can stimulate muscle growth and strength gains in your bodyweight training. This is what we call progressive overload.\nFor those ready to transition into weight training, don’t feel the pressure to throw yourself into the deep end of weight training. Gradually introduce an added force of resistance to your strength training with some of the best resistance bands and then if you feel comfortable, take things up a notch with some dumbbells.\nBe sure to speak to a fitness trainer for guidance on form and technique to help avoid injury and remember that exercise should be fun. So, if you aren’t enjoying one form of exercise, experiment with other forms until you find something you feel good doing.\nMore from Tom’s Guide",

    "title": "Trusaic CEO Robert Sheen Is Providing Solutions For Pay Equity And Salary Transparency",
    "text": "Here, Robert Sheen spoke with Haute Living about why he founded Trusaic and his advice for aspiring entrepreneurs. What was your journey to where you are today? After graduating from the University of Southern California and Loyola Law School, I began my career at KPMG, where I specialized in corporate reorganization, mergers and acquisitions, and tax product development. From there, I joined BDO Seidman in Los Angeles and led the company’s state and local tax practice. In 1999, I founded First Capitol Consulting, which eventually became Trusaic, concentrating on tax credits, data solutions, and the quality of the workplace. In 2003, I organized and founded U.S. Metro Bank, which was a disruptor in the field of mobile banking, and served as Vice Chair of the Board there until 2013. In 2006, I also developed TaxAdvantage in partnership with Intuit, which provided tax-centric data solutions for Intuit’s Employment Management Service’s 1.4 million customers. What inspired you to found Trusaic? When I was ten years old, my family moved to the Los Angeles area from Seoul, South Korea. Growing up in the ‘70s and ‘80s, I witnessed and experienced forms of discrimination and racial justice. Those experiences, among others, would come to influence the work I do today with Trusaic. Helping businesses with tax issues in the workplace laid the groundwork for the creation of the company and our eventual expansion into areas such as the Affordable Care Act and pay equity. Initially, I worked to help mid-sized and smaller companies receive tax credits for helping disadvantaged workers get hired. The government was encouraging employers to hire people who traditionally might have a harder time getting work, such as disabled veterans and individuals with a criminal record. Organizations that hired and retained these individuals were able to offer a leg up to these employees, level the playing field for these workers, and receive a tax benefit for the company. Today, we help organizations navigate compliance laws and regulations around pay equity, helping them do the right thing while ensuring they remain compliant. Can you explain pay equity and how the software works? Pay equity is an umbrella term related to the fairness of compensation employers pay their employees for performing comparable work without regard to gender or race/ethnicity, or other categories protected by law, such as national origin or sexual orientation. It includes fairness in base pay and in total compensation, including bonuses, overtime, employee benefits, and opportunities for advancement. While pay equity affects all working people, it’s of particular concern to women and members of racial and ethnic groups and other groups that have historically been victims of wage discrimination. Our solution, PayParity, conducts a pay equity audit across the workforce at the intersections of gender, race/ethnicity, age, disability, and other considerations. The platform identifies instances of pay inequity and pinpoints the root causes driving the issues so that employers can address the causes of inequitable pay, not just the symptoms. The software’s Salary Range Finder also helps organizations ensure that they are offering an equitable wage at the time of hire so pay inequity doesn’t get a foothold. What can other companies do to work towards more fair wages and work environments? Conducting a pay equity analysis is critical for eliminating gaps in employee compensation and is the first step a company should take. You can’t remedy a situation if you don’t have a complete understanding of where your issues might exist. We also tell companies that this isn’t a “one-and-done” solution. The makeup of your workforce is always changing, so you need to monitor pay on an ongoing basis, or you’ll soon find yourself backsliding. More states are also passing new laws around pay transparency, which we know positively impacts pay equity. More than 25% of the labor force, in fact, is covered by some form of pay transparency legislation ranging from a requirement to include salaries in their job postings to annual pay data reporting. As this legislation becomes more widespread, employers operating in multiple states should consider proactively developing a consistent policy around salary transparency across their workforce, whether or not they are currently obligated to do so because a law is likely coming their way soon. What is your philanthropic work, and why is it important to you? I have served as a member of the National Advisory Board for the Asian American Justice Center. I am a former President of the Korean American Bar Association. I’m also a former trustee for the USC Pacific Asia Museum, a former board member for MTV’s Rock the Vote, and was honored as a Man of L.A. by The Women’s Foundation. I’m drawn to causes that are centered around advancing gender, racial, and economic justice. What advice do you have for aspiring entrepreneurs? My father taught me, “Don’t chase money; let the money follow you.” You need a purpose, passion, hard work, discipline, and the desire to hone your craft. If you can concentrate on these, success will follow. For more information about Trusaic, please visit the website here: https://trusaic.com/.",

    "text": "Bill Gates reveló las tres profesiones clave que sobrevivirán a la Inteligencia Artificial El confundador de Microsoft dio su visión sobre el futuro de algunas profesiones y los cambios que llegarán con la Inteligencia Artificial. Cuáles son y qué podría pasar en los próximos años. La [Inteligencia Artificial](https://www.mdzol.com/temas/inteligencia-artificial-3428.html) (IA) ha llegado para quedarse, y su influencia en la sociedad y el mundo laboral es cada vez más evidente. Las empresas tecnológicas están adoptando esta innovación en sus productos, pero surge la preocupación sobre el reemplazo de trabajadores y cómo este avance transformará nuestra forma de vida. El cofundador de Microsoft, Bill Gates, es un destacado visionario en el ámbito tecnológico, y sus reflexiones sobre la Inteligencia Artificial destacan su potencial para transformar diversos sectores de la sociedad. Bill Gates compara la llegada de la IA con la creación de Internet y destaca su capacidad para revolucionar la educación, la salud y el mercado laboral. Según Bill Gates, la Inteligencia Artificial ofrece nuevas oportunidades y soluciones para enfrentar grandes desafíos. Visualiza un futuro en el que las máquinas asumirán tareas rutinarias, permitiendo a los humanos enfocarse en actividades más creativas y significativas. La capacidad de automatizar procesos, como la toma de notas en reuniones y la síntesis de ideas clave, cambiará la dinámica laboral. Qué trabajos no podrán ser reemplazados en el futuro por la inteligencia artificial, según Bill Gates El magnate filántropo pronostica que los trabajos esenciales en el futuro estarán centrados en tres áreas clave: la Inteligencia Artificial, la energía y la biología. Estas áreas se convertirán en pilares fundamentales para la sociedad, ofreciendo oportunidades profesionales significativas. En una publicación en su blog personal, [Gates's Notes](https://www.gatesnotes.com/), Bill Gates proyecta cambios significativos en la forma en que interactuamos con la tecnología en los próximos cinco años. Predice que las aplicaciones tradicionales, como Microsoft Word o Google Docs, perderán relevancia a medida que la Inteligencia Artificial asuma un papel más integral en nuestras vidas. Bill Gates visualiza un futuro donde cada individuo tendrá un asistente personal, denominado \"agente\", que se adapta al lenguaje natural y realiza tareas según los datos del usuario. Estos agentes cambiarán no solo la interacción con las computadoras, sino también la industria del software, marcando una revolución comparable a la transición de escribir comandos a tocar íconos.
