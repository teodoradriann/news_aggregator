    "text": "Thirty-two suspects, three of whom are alleged members of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), have been detained for allegedly plotting attacks on synagogues, churches and the Iraqi Embassy in Turkey, the state-run Anadolu news agency reported on Friday. According to Anadolu, the National Intelligence Organization (MİT) found that Micbel al-Shuveyhi, code-named “Abu Yakin al-Iraqi,” and Muhammed Hilaf Ibrahim Ibrahim, code-named “Abu Leys,” the intelligence officer for Turkey’s ISIL network, were plotting attacks on synagogues and churches in Turkey, while Iyheb Elani, code-named “Abdullah al-Jumaili,” was readying attacks on the Iraqi Embassy in Ankara. The three suspects and 29 others connected to them were captured in an operation carried out jointly by MİT and the police, according to a statement from Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya on X. The detentions took place across nine provinces as part of an İstanbul-based operation, the minister said.

    "text": "A chorus of greetings from a dozen smiling volunteers ushered three small children inside the suite beside the Chuluota Grocery store, their mother trailing behind them.\n“Go on and pick your chips,” one of the volunteers told them, helping the kids stuff grocery bags from boxes filled with potato chip varieties. Noticing how one of the children was unable to choose from the bin, a volunteer handed out a Frito-Lay variety mix box and told her she could take it home.\nVolunteers helped the mother of the family load her car with grocery bags filled with prepped meal kits, snacks and the children’s haul of potato chips, sending them off with a “see you next week”.\nChildren shuffle through the Resource Center’s boxes of potato chips to select snacks to take home. – Photo by Juno Le And instead of being 11 miles and two towns away – the distance between Chuluota and the nearest county-run summer lunch program – it’s all right around the corner at the newly-established Chuluota Resource Center .\nA lifeboat in a food desert\nBarbie and Denny Worswick began the food pantry with two small wooden cabinets bought off of Facebook Marketplace outside of the Chuluota Grocery store off of 7th Street in the summer of 2023. When a space beside the grocery store opened for rent in March, a door opened for the Worswicks to expand their operation.\nNow with a 700-square-foot location, the food pantry has become the Chuluota Resource Center .\nThe cabinet is still posted outside of the Resource Center, making items accessible to those who can’t make the Center’s hours (10 a.m. to 4 p.m.). It’s filled with non-perishable goods and is replenished on a daily basis. The new space has allowed them to stock the refill food and to keep perishable items.\nThe source of the Center’s supplies: the very neighborhood it serves.\n“The most incredible thing about our pantry is that it’s people in our community who can afford to get food are donating so the people who can’t afford it can get help, which is just absolutely beautiful,” Barbie said.\nChuluota Resource Center founder Barbie Worswick shows off jarred desserts donated by a community member. – Photo by Juno Le One of the community’s regular donors to the food pantry and the Resource Center is Donna Hatch.\nHatch’s relationship with the team at the Resource Center dates back to the wooden pantry days, when Hatch and her family’s business DynaFire donated a truckload of bikes for a local Christmas giveaway Barbie was hosting.\n“I try to go at least twice a month,” Hatch said. “More recently it’s been to support the summer lunch program, but continually throughout the year it’s whatever they’re working on at the time, whether it be just meals for the pantry, back-to-school supplies, whatever it is.”\nBarbie believes this outpost operates uniquely compared to other charity organizations.\n“Most pantries you have to apply before you can even take food. They want to know your income, just to qualify, just to make sure you’re needy enough to need it,” Barbie said. “I think if you come in to here, if you’re willing to do that, we’re not going to say no, we’re not going to question it. We don’t judge people.”\nA call to action\nThe first large operation from the newly opened Chuluota Resource Center: providing children in the neighborhood with breakfast and lunch throughout the summer.\nSeminole County Public Schools’ Red Apple Dining program announced in May that it has continued its partnership with Summer BreakSpot this year to provide all children, 18 years old or younger, breakfast and lunch starting June 2.\nThe issue for Chuluota families, however, was that the nearest school site at the beginning of this program was Oviedo High School, which is 6.4 miles away from the Chuluota Resource Center.\n“That’s a long way for us if you’re a parent who’s working and can’t drive them to that school every day,” Barbie said. “Then the idea was born that we’re gonna need to do something for our kids in our community.”\nSummer BreakSpot locations in Seminole County, according to SCPS Communications Officer Katherine Crnkovich, are selected if they are planning activities that support children during the summer and meet USDA guidelines (including service for low-income individuals), health department standards and district requirements.\nAccessibility is also part of the consideration for these locations.\n“Safety is always a priority. For example, we do not want kids to have to cross a busy street to have access to food,” Crnkovich stated.\nDining must occur on-site at these locations, a USDA requirement to ensure the children have a safe place to eat and others do not take their food.\nSCPS provided 23,892 breakfasts, 47,196 lunches and 6,444 snacks in June.\nOviedo High School stopped serving summer lunches once summer school ended, and the current nearest location for Chuluota families is Indian Trails Middle School, an 11-mile drive from the Chuluota Resource Center.\n“Dates and times typically correspond with the availability of activities for children/teens at each location. Some locations are open for only a few days and others are open for weeks,” Crnkovich stated in an email.\nSCPS locations stop providing meals the week before school starts, allowing teams to train and prepare for the upcoming school year service, according to Crnkovich.\nAn operation free of government funding, according to Barbie, the Center put together its own independent summer lunch program with nothing but community donations and resources.\nRight as the 2024-2025 academic year wrapped in May, the Resource Center posted sign-ups for community members in need of readily packed meals for children during the summer. Eighteen families in Chuluota have signed up for this program.\nStaff and volunteers pack bags with six days’ worth of food, ready for pickup on Saturdays. The food items included are primarily non-perishable to make packing and distribution easier, Barbie said. The Center does have weeks when families take home items that are perishable, including frozen pizza, salad, sausage and eggs.\nChuluota Resource Center volunteer Kim Nunnery pulls a meal bag off the shelf for a recently arrived family during Saturday pickup. – Photo by Juno Le Thus, Saturdays have become an exciting day for the Resource Center’s staff. Cheryl Drury, Chuluota Resource Center’s fundraising officer, excitedly looks forward to seeing familiar faces during lunch pickup.\n“People don’t see it, but when the people come in and they get it and those kids, we let them go back there and get their chips and whatever, pick them out,” Drury said. “The look is worth a million dollars. You look at their faces and the parents’ faces, they are so happy. I think that’s the best part.”\nChuluota Resource Center young volunteers prepare meal bags for families, each bag containing food intended to last the week until the next meal pickup. – Photo by Juno Le In June, the Resource Center gave out 694 lunches, Barbie said. As of mid-July, they have supplied families in the community with roughly 1,000 lunches.\n“I’m actually surprised to see how well it’s taken off,” Hatch said. “Sometimes it takes some time to develop a program like that, but I just think that our community was very open to it. I think it’s been warmly accepted by both the donating side of it and the recipients as well.”\nTaking extra care\nOn the sign-up sheet, families had the option to include dietary restrictions. April Longenbach, the food handler at Chuluota Resource Center, worked closely with families to ensure the food was safe to eat for their children.\nLongenbach, a mother of special needs children, has the background knowledge to assess what’s needed for certain dietary restrictions.\nWhen a child with a gluten-free restriction signed up for the program, Longenbach reached out to his mother.\n“I called her to just kind of figure out where his level was, because it’s really hard in a food pantry. If he has a full-on allergy, then obviously we are going to have to intentionally go out and buy his food, clean it and keep it completely separate,” Longenbach said.\nLongenbach sat on the phone with the child’s mother to confirm that he had a gluten sensitivity, asking her what foods they eat at home, what he likes, what he knows to cook and what he doesn’t.\n“We just kind of take extra care of them and, like, when I’m at the store and I see something, you know, gluten free, I know an 11-year-old’s gonna love, I just pick it up,” Longenbach said.\nA sticky note is posted on the shelf holding all of the school lunch bags.\n“August 2 last lunch giveaway,” it reads.\nChuluota Resource Center Volunteer Coordinator Angela Berthold Eakman hands off meal bags to one of the Center’s volunteers to carry out to a family’s car. – Photo by Juno Le The staff and volunteers are just about a month away from wrapping up the largest operation they have run since the Resource Center opened. The Center intends to distribute 1,400 lunches total by the end of the summer.\n“We’ve come a long way in a short period of time,” Drury said. “But as you know, with anything, as you grow you’ve got growing pains.”\nThe Worswicks and the rest of the Resource Center’s staff and volunteer team are getting by with what the community is willing to give back and share with their neighbors. In the four months that the Resource Center has been open, they took the donations and helping hands they’ve been given and hit the ground running.\n“I’m not a spotlight person, but I do want the center to be noticed so that we can keep going and growing,” Barbie said. “We don’t want it too big. We don’t want to be Second Harvest or Hope, that’s not our goal. Our goal is to help our community here in Chuluota.”",

    "title": "NC Supreme Court temporarily blocks order to throw out 60,000 votes in justice race",
    "text": "RALEIGH, N.C. — The North Carolina Supreme Court's 2024 election took another turn on Monday, with that court temporarily blocking a lower court decision that could invalidate over 60,000 ballots.\nOn Monday, the NC Supreme Court issued a temporary stay on a North Carolina Court of Appeals order that said the contested ballots needed to be reverified or thrown out.\nOn Friday, a state appeals court panel ruled 2-1 along party lines to favor of Republican candidate Jefferson Griffin against incumbent Allison Riggs.\nFor months, Griffin has been contesting the validity of around 60,000 North Carolina ballots cast during the November elections. He's largely targeting some mail-in and early voters, claiming incomplete registrations. However, others have pointed to a database issue.\nFriday's decision would require affected voters to verify their identity and registration. County election boards will identify these voters, giving them 15 business days from the mailing of the notice to respond. Voters who do not comply will have their ballots thrown out, only for this particular race.\nThe Monday order does not rule in favor of either side but allows the appeal from Riggs and the election board to follow through.\nAfter two recounts, Justice Riggs holds a 734-vote lead over Griffin. A majority of those challenged are Democrats, meaning if not enough ballots are verified, this decision could flip the seat back into GOP control. The State Supreme Court currently has a 5-2 Republican majority.\nRiggs has said her campaign would appeal the ruling, releasing a statement that says:\n“We will be promptly appealing this deeply misinformed decision that threatens to disenfranchise more than 65,000 lawful voters and sets a dangerous precedent, allowing disappointed politicians to thwart the will of the people. North Carolinians elected me to keep my seat and I swore an oath to the constitution and the rule of law — so I will continue to stand up for the rights of voters in this state and stand in the way of those who would take power from the people.”\nThis would likely bring the case before the state Supreme Court, the very bench with a seat on the line in the dispute. If the state Supreme Court hears the case, Riggs will recuse herself, leaving a 5-1 Republican majority to decide the matter.\nHowever, this could push a decision back for months. WCNC Charlotte spoke with former NC Supreme Court Justice Bob Orr about next steps. He says a decision from the State Supreme Court could take weeks or months.\n\"It has to be an incredibly uncomfortable position for the for both courts,\" Orr said. \"I think it tends to undermine public confidence in the judiciary and the independence of it.\"\nIf it doesn't go in Riggs's favor, her lawyers have indicated they are likely to appeal, sending it into federal court. This would start the process over again, in the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. There's potential for it to go all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court, but he said it's unlikely given how few cases they take on per year.\n\"It really is complicated. There's so many different paths that this can go down,\" Orr said. \"There's no, no time limit at this point.\"\nHe also mentioned some have floated the possibility of another election, further complicating the future.\n\"Do you have a new election in conjunction with the primaries in 2026?\" Orr said. \"We can all already See the kind of negative ads that are going to be put out there, many by independent groups or party groups. It just continues to tarnish and damage the judiciary.\"\nRegardless, he encourages all voters on this list to take the time to verify their registration now.\nThe months-long back and forth has led to statewide protests and pushback from other legal experts, including a letter from a coalition of over 200 North Carolina jurists, government officials and attorneys urging Griffin to concede.\n\"The arguments you have advanced ask our judicial system to change the rules in place for the 2024 election after it has run its course. Indeed, if you succeed, tens of thousands of voters will lose their voice after they voted,” the letter states. “For the sake of our judicial system, we ask you to terminate your litigation now.”\nThe North Carolina Supreme Court election remains the only undecided race nationally from the 2024 general election.\nContact Julie Kay at juliekay@wcnc.com and follow her on Facebook, X and Instagram.",

    "text": "The International Fellowship of Christians and Jews yesterday revealed its massive contributions to Israel following the outbreak of the war against Hamas, including $19 million in aid.\nAs the war reached its 100th day, the IFCJ marked the occasion by releasing details of its impactful initiatives throughout 2023. The organization has played a crucial role in providing emergency aid support to those affected by the ongoing conflict. Immediate response to the outbreak of the war\nBetween October 7 and December 31, 2023, IFCJ delivered $19 million in emergency aid and assistance to hundreds of thousands of Israelis impacted by the war. In addition to this immediate relief, the organization has consistently provided aid and security measures over the decades to safeguard and support Israelis across the country.\nYael Eckstein, president and CEO of IFCJ, expressed gratitude for the unwavering support from donors and millions of Christians worldwide during these challenging times. “It has been 100 days of war, sorrow, and uncertainty. But after these 100 days, and especially now with the global rise in antisemitism, the one thing I’m certain about – and gives us all tremendous hope – is the friendship and support from our hundreds of thousands of donors and the millions of Christians around the world who continue to stand with Israel and the Jewish people,” she said.\nIFCJ has contributed significantly to security efforts, including the transportation and installation of 30 portable bomb shelters along the northern border and in the Galilee region. Other measures include providing protective flak jackets, helmets, medical and equipment bags, and fortified security vehicles to various teams across affected regions. a firefighter receives a vest from IFCJ members (credit: GUY YECHIELI, IFCJ)\nThe organization has also established support locations, including a Casualty Identification Center in Ramle, support to evacuees from Ashkelon at the Givat Haviva campus, support to survivors of Kibbutz Nahal Oz at Kibbutz Mishmar Ha’emek, and support to evacuees from Ashkelon, Sderot, and Netivot at the Kiryat Ono Campus.\nIFCJ has allocated $7 million for various basic needs and assistance to local communities near the Gaza border , addressing aspects such as food, medicine, hygiene products, transportation, evacuation, caretakers, and housing. Additionally, the organization provided $400,000 in support of a trauma organization and its helpline, as well as over $500,000 to 400 families of IDF personnel wounded in combat.

Furthermore, $166,000 has been allocated for transportation and housing for the elderly and families, including those with special needs. Respite kits with games and toys have been distributed to 3,900 children, including those with special needs.\nIFCJ has been actively involved in distributing prepared meals and food boxes to various groups, including the elderly besieged in their homes, evacuees from communities around Gaza, and soldiers serving on the northern border.\n“The Fellowship has been on the ground for more than 40 years, helping provide for the people of Israel and the Jewish people. We were on the ground distributing aid on October 7 as terrorists were still roaming our streets, and we have been doing so every day since,” Eckstein said. “In many ways, our work is just beginning, but we will continue doing everything we can to help people begin to rebuild their lives.”",
