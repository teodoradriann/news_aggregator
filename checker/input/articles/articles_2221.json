    "text": "February 29, 2024 Fox Creek Health Care Centre recently welcomed three new RNs and an LPN to the staff through the Domestic Internationally Educated Nurses (DIEN) program.

Fox Creek Site Manager Tracy Brown, centre, believes welcoming new DIENs is as much about welcoming them to the community as it is about welcoming them to the workplace.

Valleyview Healthcare Centre nursing and support staff were recently recognized with an AHS CARES Award for going above and beyond to welcome new Domestic Internationally Educated Nurses to the team. Shown, from left, are: Cherry Pesquiza, RN; Marnelli Francisco, HCA; Julieto (JJ) Jasmin, LPN; Kiranjeet Kaur, RN; Gurbhinder Kaur, RN; Carol Caron, RN; Nyah Czaban, RN; and Hailey Turcotte, RN. Photo supplied. Story by Diana Rinne For new staff, there’s always a learning curve. For Site Manager Tracy Brown and her teams at both Valleyview Healthcare Centre and Fox Creek Healthcare Centre, this curve involves bringing new staff up to speed in their jobs as well as the ins and outs of life in a small rural community. Over the last six months, she’s hired 25 Domestic Internationally Educated Nurses (DIENs) to fill positions —three registered nurses (RNs) and one licensed practical nurse (LPN) in Fox Creek and 12 RNs, 4 LPNs and five healthcare aides (HCAs) in Valleyview. With these hires, Brown has seen the staff vacancy rate at both sites drop to zero from the previous 30 per cent at Valleyview and 50 per cent at Fox Creek. One arrival, Gurpreet Kaur moved to Valleyview from Calgary last July to take on a job as an RN. “I was looking for a job so I can start as an RN in Canada.” Though she found it challenging to start a job in a new town with people she’d never met, Kaur adds that the support she’s received from Brown and the Valleyview team has made all the difference. “I am thankful to Brown that she gave me an opportunity to get me into the new role. She trusted me and it’s been eight months that I’ve been working in Valleyview. Each day I see her, that makes my day.” Though some, such as Kaur, initially trained and worked in healthcare in a different country, some are just starting their journey, having come from abroad and taken training in other provinces, such as Quebec. With no onsite clinical educator in Valleyview or Fox Creek at the time, Brown turned to her team to help new staff with their learning. “We bring them in and do buddy shifts. Then we put them in a course, so they take the charge nurse, the Canadian Triage Acuity Scale (CTAS) Guidelines, Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS), Connect Care and more — and they’re all doing pretty good.” For Rajneet Kaur Gill, who came to Fox Creek from India, via Saskatchewan, Fox Creek is the perfect place to reignite her nursing career. “It proved to be the best decision I have ever made.” Though it’s been difficult to be far from family, she says the welcome she received from Fox Creek Healthcare Centre staff is making the transition much easier than she thought it might be. “I have learned a lot of things from them — and they are always ready to teach.” Gill adds the best part of her job is working with patients and being able to provide them with the best nursing care, using her knowledge and kindness. “I’m learning new things every day. There are lots of opportunities for education every month that have enhanced my nursing skills. Last, but not least, the site manager and staff have been extremely helpful to me.” Kiranjeet Kaur, an RN in Valleyview, agrees: “Choosing this place to work was my best decision because of the positive work environment. We have the opportunity to share openly our thoughts and perspectives.” What advice might new DIEN staff have for anyone who’s wondering whether to join Alberta Health Services? “Go ahead and do it,” says Valleyview RN Neethu Mohanan. “It’s not easy, but it’s not impossible.” Welcoming new staff has also been as much about merging cultures as it has been about healthcare, adds Brown. “There are a lot of life lessons,” she says, then laughs, about simple things like teaching newcomers about why there’s so much candy out at Halloween, to enlightening long-time staff about why fireworks are such a big part of Diwali. The nursing and support staff team in Valleyview were recently honoured as recipients of the AHS CARES Award which recognizes individuals and/or teams who go above and beyond their everyday job duties and demonstrate the CARES values to which all AHS colleagues aspire: Compassion, Accountability, Respect, Excellence and Safety. Brown and her team continue to work hard to ensure their new DIENs feel welcome and supported — from making sure newcomers have a place to live, to picking them up upon arrival, to taking them to get groceries and making sure they have rides to work, or transportation to training in Grande Prairie. “We’ve built such a welcoming culture here,” she says with pride. “We have a culture where if you ask a question, someone can say this is what’s happening, this is why it’s happening, and here are the resources and where you can find what you need to learn more.”",

    "text": "ZUG, Switzerland — Abby Stonehouse's record-setting performance kept Canada unbeaten at the world women's under-18 hockey championship. Stonehouse scored two short-handed goals and added three assists to lead Canada past Czechia 8-1 on Sunday. Both goals came in the second period, making the Blenheim, Ont., native the first player in tournament history to register two short-handed goals in both the same game and period. The Canadians scored three short-handed goals in the contest, also a tournament record. Canada (2-0) opened the tournament Saturday with an 11-0 victory over Germany. \"Today was faster than the Germany game for sure,\" Stonehouse said. \"But I think we adjusted to the pace quickly. \"We got into some penalty trouble, but our coaches preach to us that if our defensive zone is strong and we can get possession of the puck, we can turn it up on offence if we have the chance. We’re a tight group and you can see the chemistry between not just the penalty killers, but every line.\" Morgan Jackson and Caitlin Kraemer (two apiece), Emma Venusio and Mackenzie Alexander had the other goals for Canada. Aneta Paroubkova replied for Czechia (0-2). Kraemer opened the scoring with a short-handed goal at 12:28 of the first. But Canada broke the game open in the second, outscoring Czechia 4-1 in the period. Stonehouse put Canada ahead 2-0 at 1:43 before scoring her second of the period at 8:20. Venusio made it 4-0 with the man advantage at 16:15 before Paroubkova scored at 17:38. But Jackson countered at 19:27 to give the Canadians a four-goal advantage. Jackson added her second of the game at 7:47 of the third. Kraemer and Alexander scored at 10:39 and 15:55, respectively, to round out the scoring. \"Both games looked very different,\" said Canadian team coach Tara Watchorn. \"I’m proud that we faced different challenges each night, which has allowed us to grow in a meaningful way. \"The girls stepped up today in terms of how they work as teammates, and despite an early learning curve, I like how we finished the game. Our goalies are rock stars and it was great to see Rhyah (Stewart) step up when we needed her tonight, she was a big part of this victory.\" Stewart, of Antigonish, N.S., stopped 23 shots and was named Canada's player of the game. The Canadians outshot Czechia 41-24. Canada resumes tournament action Tuesday versus Finland. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 7, 2024. The Canadian Press",

    "text": "F.P. Report\nISLAMABAD: Chairman Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) began his address by welcoming the Peoples Lawyers Forum (PLF) to Zardari House. He said that the Party’s lawyers’ wing gave this country the 1973 Constitution and stood firm against every tyrant, whether in the form of dictators like Zia ul Haq and General Musharraf, or Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhary.\nBilawal highlighted that the struggle of the Party’s lawyers led to the restoration of the 1973 Constitution and the removal of oppressive laws. He recalled how Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto, even while in Dubai, would receive calls from the PLF. She would remark that if judges wished to engage in politics, they should form a political party and contact her in that capacity. She understood that politicising the courts would be detrimental to democracy, the Constitution, and the people.\nBilawal stated that Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto herself envisioned the formation of a constitutional court, designed to address the injustices suffered by the people and her family, especially after her father’s judicial murder. Her vision focused on establishing constitutional courts to handle cases with political and constitutional implications. The appointment of judges, which constitutionally lay with the Prime Minister, was later transferred to the Chief Justice through judicial intervention. Attempts were made to address this in the 18th Amendment, following global examples like the United States, where legislators hold such powers. However, this effort was derailed by the so-called “handshake” Chief Justice, who set a precedent for an insular judicial system. The doctrine of ‘political activism’ initiated by Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhary has since been propagated by figures like Saqib Nisar and Gulzar Ahmed. Articles of the Constitution, such as 58 -2B, have been weaponised.\nBilawal said his family waited fifty years to achieve justice for Quaid-e-Awam Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. While expressing gratitude to the entire bench of the case, including Justice Isa and Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, he questioned the plight of the common people if a former Prime Minister, his daughter, also a former Prime Minister, and her husband, a former President, had to wait five decades for justice. “We must fulfil Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto’s promises; come what may, we must establish the constitutional court in line with the Charter of Democracy,” Chairman Bilawal vowed. The process of judicial appointments needs reform, and the people of this country must receive justice.\nBilawal noted that 15 percent of the Supreme Court’s cases are constitutional, yet these occupy significant portions of time. He questioned whether it would not be appropriate to establish separate constitutional courts, representing the federation, to handle cases that currently consume 90 percent of the court’s time. Even the Parliament has two houses, he pointed out. Once constitutional courts are established, judges can perform their duties more effectively.\nBilawal suggested that the government’s proposals are perhaps insufficient, noting that provinces also need their own constitutional courts. In provincial courts, 50 percent of cases are related to constitutional matters. Legislation in this regard would provide meaningful relief to people seeking swift and timely justice. Chairman PPP stressed that there should be no opposition to constitutional amendments in this context. He reaffirmed his commitment to fighting for this cause, a promise of Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto.\nBilawal acknowledged that some voices from within the legal community may promote certain ideals under the guise of defending the state, often due to personal affiliations with judges. However, he warned that this would deceive the public and deny them their rights. These are the same individuals responsible for the passage of the 19th Amendment. In this context, Chairman Bilawal urged the PLF’s lawyers to make their voices heard and empower themselves, whether in provincial or federal constitutional courts. If the PPP succeeds in achieving its aims, the lawyers will also have a say in the process and contribute their expertise. He recalled that Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto initially set the minimum age for judges at 40, which was later raised to 45 by Zia ul Haq. Chairman said that he personally believes the age should be reduced to 35, but at the very least, the original limit set by Quaid-e-Awam should be retained. This would provide young lawyers with greater opportunities to advance as judges.\nBilawal emphasised that the PPP has consistently upheld its position regarding the judiciary, motivated by a desire for justice. The Party holds the judiciary in the highest regard and seeks to empower it to deliver justice in a timely manner. Addressing the PLF, Chairman Bilawal called for conventions to be organised. He reminded the audience of the sacrifices made by PPP’s lawyers, who have withstood bullets in defence of the judicial system and would do so again if needed.\nBilawal concluded by sharing that his own grandfather was a lawyer, and he holds the profession in great esteem. He expressed his concerns over the politicisation of the legal field, which has undermined democracy. Chairman Bilawal reiterated his determination to present his stance to the legal community and vowed to continue the fight on every front. He also issued directives to the relevant party organisations to begin preparations in this regard.",

    "text": "site.btaTeacher Salaries Increase by 8.4% as of January 1, 2024 The basic salaries of all teaching staff will increase by 8.4% as of January 1, 2024, the Ministry of Education and Science press service reported on December 28, 2023. The increase comes after a new collective agreement regarding the pre-school and school education system signed on December 28, 2023, by the Minister of Education and Science Galin Tzokov and the social partners in education. At the signing, Tzokov said: \"Good and constructive dialogue is crucial in seeking and adopting the best solutions for the system\". The increase means that the new monthly starting minimum basic salary for teachers will be BGN 1,853. The same rate applies to all other teaching professionals, such as resource teachers, educators, heads of Information and Communication Technologies, speech therapists, psychologists, pedagogical advisers, hearing and speech rehabilitators, sports coaches in schools and kindergartens. The monthly minimum basic salary for senior teachers and senior educators becomes BGN 1,911 and BGN 1,985 for head teachers and head educators. Principals will be paid a basic salary of at least BGN 2,257 per month, while their deputies will get BGN 2,088. The new collective agreement also provides for salary increases for both workers and non-teaching staff. Nearly BGN 290 million from the state budget has been provided for the salary increase of pedagogues. The agreement was signed by the Minister of Education and Science Tzokov, the head of the Bulgarian Union of Teachers with the Confederation of Independent Trade Unions in Bulgaria (CITUB) Yanka Takeva, the head of the Education trade union with the Confederation of Labour Podkrepa Julian Petrov, the head of the Independent Teachers' Trade Union with CITUB Asparuh Tomov and by representatives of the Union of Employers in the Public Education System (SRSNPB). Diyan Stamatov, head of the SRSNPB, told BTA on December 14, 2023, that the budget proposed for all education and science was is 4.1% of GDP, which is a reduction of 0.2%. Thus it will not be possible to increase teachers' salaries by a higher margin. Realistically, the increase should not be 8% but 15 to 18%, in order to maintain the trend of teachers' salaries being 125% of the national average salary, Stamatov said. /NZ/ news.modal.header news.modal.text",
