    "title": "FT: DeepSeek отложила запуск новой ИИ-модели из-за проблем с чипами Huawei",
    "text": "Китайская компания DeepSeek, специализирующаяся на искусственном интеллекте, перенесла релиз новой модели R2 с мая из-за неудач в обучении на чипах Huawei Ascend. Об этом сообщает The Financial Times (FT) со ссылкой на источники.\nПо данным издания, китайская компания использовала чипы Nvidia для обучения и Huawei — для вывода результатов, что привело к задержке запуска и потере позиций относительно конкурентов.\nТехнические сложности возникли на этапе обучения модели на больших наборах данных с использованием чипов из серии Ascend, где наблюдались проблемы со стабильностью, скоростью межчипового взаимодействия и программным обеспечением по сравнению с продуктами Nvidia.\nHuawei направила на помощь группу инженеров в офис DeepSeek, однако полноценный цикл обучения так и не удался, отметили два источника. В настоящее время продолжается работа над совместимостью модели с Ascend для этапа вывода, когда обученная система генерирует ответы на запросы, такие как в чат-ботах.\nИнсайдеры отрасли указывают на отставание китайских разработок в ключевых задачах ИИ. Основатель DeepSeek Лян Вэньфэн выразил внутреннее недовольство ходом проекта и настаивает на дополнительном времени для создания передовой модели, способной сохранить лидерство компании, добавили источники\nПо мнению эксперта по ИИ из Калифорнийского университета в Беркли Ритвика Гупта, Huawei переживает «проблемы роста» в обучении на Ascend, но со временем адаптируется. «То, что сейчас нет ведущих моделей на Huawei, не значит, что этого не будет в будущем. Это вопрос времени», — добавил он.\nРанее Nvidia согласилась делиться частью доходов от продаж H20 в Китае с правительством США для возобновления поставок. Глава Huawei до этого заявлял, что чипы его компании Ascend уступают американским аналогам на одно поколение. Это прозвучало после того, как гендиректор Nvidia Дженсен Хуанг назвал Huawei «грозным» конкурентом из-за ограничений США на экспорт чипов в Китай.",

    "title": "Climate change may allow the Earth’s oldest, tiniest creatures to dominate — and that's seriously bad news",
    "text": "The world&#039;s oceans are home to microscopic organisms invisible to the human eye. The tiny creatures, known as &quot;prokaryotes&quot;, comprise 30% of life in the world&#039;s oceans. These organisms play an important role in keeping the oceans in balance. But new research by myself and colleagues shows this balance is at risk. We found prokaryotes are remarkably resilient to climate change — and as a result, could increasingly dominate marine environments. This could reduce the availability of fish humans rely on for food, and hamper the ocean&#039;s ability to absorb carbon emissions. A fine balance Prokaryotes include both bacteria and &quot;archaea&quot;, another type of single-celled organism. These organisms are thought to be the oldest cell-based lifeforms on Earth. They thrive across the entire planet — on land and in water, from the tropics to the poles. What prokaryotes lack in size they make up in sheer abundance. Globally, about two tonnes of marine prokaryotes exist for every human on the planet. They play a crucial role in the world&#039;s food chains, helping support the nutrient needs of fish humans catch and eat. Marine prokaryotes grow extremely fast — a process that emits a lot of carbon. In fact, prokaryotes to an ocean depth of 200 metres produce about 20 billion tonnes of carbon a year: double that of humans. This massive carbon output is balanced by phytoplankton — another type of microscopic organism which turns sunlight and carbon dioxide into energy, through photosynthesis. Phytoplankton and other ocean processes also absorb up to one-third of the carbon humans release into the atmosphere each year. This helps limit the pace of global warming. How prokaryotes respond to warming is key to understanding how the fine balance of the world&#039;s oceans may change in a warmer world. This was the focus of our research. Prokaryotes are thought to be the oldest cell-based lifeforms on Earth. Pictured: a 3D illustration of marine bacteria. (Image credit: Kateryna Kon via Shutterstock) What we found We wanted to predict how climate change would affect the &quot;biomass&quot;, or total global weight, of marine prokaryotes. We also wanted to examine how it would affect their carbon output. To do this, we built computer models that integrated decades of observations from dozens of scientific surveys across the world&#039;s oceans. So what did we find? Prokaryotes are likely to be climate change winners, relative to other marine life. For each degree of ocean warming, their biomass will decline by about 1.5%. This is less than half the projected 3–5% decline we predicted for larger plankton, fish and mammals. It means future marine ecosystems will have lower overall biomass, and will increasingly be dominated by prokaryotes. This could divert a greater share of available nutrients and energy toward prokaryotes and away from fish, reducing the supply of fish humans eat. We discovered another important change. For every degree of warming, we predict prokaryotes in the top 200 metres of the world&#039;s oceans would produce an additional 800 million tonnes of carbon per year. This is equivalent to the present-day emissions of the entire European Union (after converting CO₂ to carbon). The biomass of prokaryotes will decline less than plankton. (Image credit: CHOKSAWATDIKORN / SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY via Getty Images) What does all this mean? Due to human-caused climate change, Earth&#039;s oceans are expected to warm by between 1°C and 3°C by the end of this century, unless humanity changes course. If the amount of carbon produced by prokaryotes does increase as predicted, it could reduce the potential of oceans to absorb human emissions. This means achieving global net-zero emissions will become even more difficult. What&#039;s more, present projections of declines in global fish stocks under climate change generally do not consider how warming may restructure marine food webs by favouring prokaryotes. This means the predicted declines are likely to be underestimated. Declines in fish populations present a major problem for global food supply, because the oceans are a major source of protein for about 3 billion people. What should happen now Our analysis is an important step in uncovering the changing role of marine prokaryotes. But significant uncertainties remain. Our analysis is built with existing observations. Climate change is already changing conditions in marine ecosystems in ways our models may not have captured. We also don&#039;t know how quickly prokaryotes will adapt and evolve to new environments. But existing research shows that in a matter of weeks, bacteria can develop new traits that make it easier for them to survive. Clearly, scientists must continue to improve their understanding of prokaryotes, and how they may be affected by climate change.

Le ministre met en garde contre les risques de « provocations» et les tentatives d'infiltration dans Gaza qui « mettront en danger la sécurité des soldats de Tsahal ».\nCela intervient après un départ lundi d’un convoi de 100 véhicules, composé de milliers de volontaires issus du Maroc, d’Algérie, de Tunisie, de Libye et d’Égypte, pour sensibiliser la communauté internationale à la crise humanitaire à Gaza, exiger la fin de la guerre génocidaire, briser le blocus israélien et acheminer de l'aide humanitaire vitale vers Gaza.\nLe convoi, qui comprend des personnalités syndicales et politiques, ainsi que des militants des droits de l'homme, des athlètes, des avocats, des médecins, des journalistes et des membres d'organisations de jeunesse, entre autres, devraient entrer en Égypte jeudi avant d'atteindre la ville frontalière de Rafah, dans le sud de la bande de Gaza.\nDans la nuit de dimanche à lundi, les forces israéliennes ont arraisonné le navire humanitaire Madleen, qui se dirigeait vers Gaza pour briser le siège et soutenir la cause palestinienne, après plus de vingt mois de génocide. Tous les 12 militants internationaux à bord, dont la militante suédoise Greta Thunberg, ont été arrêtés.\nCes dernières années, plusieurs navires ont tenté de briser le blocus terrestre, maritime et naval imposé par Israël sur la bande de Gaza, mais ils ont été tous repoussés par les forces israéliennes.\nEn 2010, la flottille Mavi Marmara a été pris d'assaut par des commandos israéliens qui ont ouvert le feu et tué dix militants.\nEn mai dernier, un autre navire de la Freedom Flotilla Coalition, le Conscience, n'a pas pu poursuivre son voyage vers Gaza après avoir été attaqué par des drones israéliens au large de Malte.\nLes Nations Unies ont désigné Gaza comme « l’endroit le plus affamé de la planète », avec près d’un demi-million de personnes dans une situation catastrophique de faim, de malnutrition aiguë, de famine, de maladie et de mort.\nSelon les données fournies par les responsables de la Santé du gouvernement palestinien, depuis le début de la guerre génocidaire en octobre 2023, plus de 54 000 Palestiniens, dont plus de 28 000 femmes et filles, ont été tués par les forces israéliennes.\nLes organisations de défense des droits de l’homme ont accusé Israël d’utiliser la famine comme arme de guerre contre la population palestinienne.",
