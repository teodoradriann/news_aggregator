    "text": "Bankrate: Women are more likely to tip than men WASHINGTON (Gray DC) - About 35% of Americans said tipping culture in America is out of control, an increase of 5% over last year, according to a Bankrate study. Ted Rossman with Bankrate said a lot of people are annoyed about pre-enter tip screens that pop up at coffee shops, food trucks, and elsewhere. “There’s a lot of tip creep that goes on as in being asked to tip in unconventional settings. And sometimes that leads to guilt tipping where you say yes even though you didn’t really want to,” Rossman explained. “And you hit 15 or 20% on the terminal. A lot of people leave feeling negative about these kinds of experiences. And a lot of people, about 4 in 10, think businesses should just pay their staff better.” Inflation is a big part of the story, because people already feel squeezed. Prices are up, money is tight, and the tip is just one more thing – sort of a hidden surcharge – at the end of a purchase. “I do think we should separate places where we ought to be tipping like restaurants and hair salons and barber shops from places where it’s more optional,” Rossman shared. “I don’t think you always need to tip at the counter where you’re just picking up a sandwich or a coffee. But if you’re not tipping well at a restaurant that’s a big deal, because the federal tip minimum wage is $2.13 an hour.” Rossman said waiters and waitresses rely on these tips. He said what surprised him most was that only a third of Gen-Zers who go to sit down restaurants are always tipping. He noted only about half of millennials are always tipping at restaurants, whereas it’s much higher for the older generations: 78% of Gen X and 80% of Boomers. Copyright 2024 Gray DC.

    "title": "Skull and Bones Map Expansion: Players Demand Relief from Chaos",
    "text": "Skull and Bones, Ubisoft’s high-seas adventure packed with the thrills of naval warfare and treasure hunting, has become a hotbed of discussion among players who are feeling overwhelmed by the chaotic nature of the game’s events. Players are particularly vocal about the need for a map expansion to alleviate the congestion of high-impact events that seem to overlap and clash with each other, leading to frustration rather than fun. With players navigating their ships alongside fierce foes like Elder Shadowbeasts and elite warships, those moments meant for strategic gameplay often devolve into a frantic “grab my loot and run” scenario. The Reddit post ignited a crucial conversation around the game’s current state and what changes players desire to ensure they can truly enjoy their naval escapade without the constant threat of impending doom.\nSummary\n- Players are feeling overwhelmed by the chaos of overlapping events in Skull and Bones.\n- Many are calling for a map expansion to alleviate the clutter and improve game flow.\n- Users suggest that staggering event timers may be a more feasible fix than a full-blown expansion.\n- There’s a mix of excitement for new content and skepticism about implementation effectiveness.\nThe Chaos of Tight Spaces\nThe Reddit post that stirred this discussion was authored by ShawnDraven, who shared a vivid episode from their gameplay experience. Imagine sailing smoothly, only to find themselves suddenly surrounded by a cacophony of threats—a convoy entangled with elite warships and ominous flying dragons, all while being pursued by an Elder Shadowbeast overhead. The sheer unpredictability of the environment can flip a casual treasure haul into frantic survival mode in a matter of seconds. This kind of chaos is often too much for players who prefer a more strategic, enjoyable gameplay experience. As Shawn highlights, the juxtaposition of these intense battles feels more like an endurance test than an adventure, leading players to fervently cry out for map expansion that can help segregate these frantic encounters.\nBalancing Complexity with Fun\nSeveral comments from players reveal a shared understanding of the chaos. User Substantial-Emu2728 humorously conveys their struggle, stating, “I love having a lot to do, but sometimes it gets a wee bit hectic. The ‘Damn. Respawn. Grab my stuff. Gtfo…’ kind of hectic.” Many players are experiencing the game’s events like a runaway train—thrilling yet dangerously unpredictable. Instead of a satisfying delve into treasure hunting, players feel like they are trapped in constant guerrilla warfare, fighting for survival against overlapping world events. The desire for more structure reflects a broader yearning for a gameplay experience that can mesh complexity with enjoyment.\nEvent Timing and Spawn Adjustments\nAs players brainstorm potential solutions to calm the chaotic seas, one popular suggestion is adjusting the timers and spawn areas for various events. LocoWolfe chimes in to echo this sentiment, suggesting that adjusting spawn areas could help to ideally prioritize specific map regions for different missions. The concept of staggering the timing of events creates the potential for players to participate in multiple events without being overwhelmed or thwarted by chaotic crossovers.\nHowever, not all players believe a map expansion is the panacea. User T0asterfrakker insists that it’s less about the map’s size and more about better organizing the events within it. The feeling of being ambushed in the middle of what should be a strategic fight is incredibly disheartening. The proposal of having players given the notification or option to “join” another event while already engaged in a fight feels like a reasonable compromise between chaos and coherence. Players’ desire for an immersive battle experience stands juxtaposed against the frustration of scenarios where a shipping convoy battling an elite pirate is abruptly interrupted by a dragon dive-bombing from above.\nA Pessimistic Glance at Future Updates\nDespite the community’s fervent calls for a map expansion, some players express skepticism regarding the chances of seeing major changes anytime soon. For instance, MalodorousFiend notes the development team has already had their plate full with the current season’s new game content, suggesting that a map expansion isn’t even on their radar for consideration. Rather than pouring time and resources into expansion, a temporary measure could help balance the current chaos until the developers can take a more holistic approach to the game’s structure.\nThe ongoing dialog reveals a few players wishing that instead of removing the chaos, developers could embrace it and allow interactions between overlapping events. Imagine a dragon swooping down to tussle with an elite pirate fleet while you’re trying to capture loot from a convoy! Users are seeing potential for an immersive world that feels alive if developers can find the right balance between event design and player engagement.\nSkull and Bones has captured players’ imaginations with its ambitious framework, but the current execution may feel akin to a pirate ship caught in tumultuous waters—a little too chaotic for comfort. As players band together to voice their requests for improved gameplay, a clearer structure for events may ultimately help salvage the experience. No one wants to feel like they’ve unintentionally hopped onto a mad pirate party where every corner has a surprise waiting to send you to Davy Jones’ locker. Whether through a full-blown map expansion, event staggering, or embracing chaos with a twist, players crave a smoother sail through Skull and Bones’ tumultuous seas. Let’s hope the developers hear their calls before everyone decides to abandon ship!",

With the new move, Canada will boost country’s highly qualified IT professionals, and the duration will be increased to 3 years.\nAs of early Jan, the government hinted at a new scheme and the detailed remote work, Immigration, Refugees, and details about citizenship will be revealed in the coming months.\nIt was learnt that number of US citizens who work as digital nomads soared to 17.3 million, moving up by 2percent in 2023.\nApply for Canada Visa from Pakistan\nPakistanis can also apply for Canada Visit, via a temporary resident visa that allows South Asians to travel for tourism, business meetings, or to visit family members.\nFor Pakistanis, Canada Visitor Visa offers multiple entries over 10 years, allowing stays of 180 days per entry. To apply for a visa, applicants must be without criminal or immigration convictions.\nThe financial statement should be prove job, own residence, or family, to demonstrate a temporary visit intention. Adequate funds for the stay is also pre-requisite.\nRequired documents include a valid passport, national ID, and possibly additional documents like bank statements. The application process involves submission of form, checking accuracy, uploading supporting documents, followed by appointment at the local visa center.\nVisa and biometric fees need to be paid at center, and tracking information is shared.\n[Canada work visa protector fee update in Pakistan December 2023]",

    "text": "Key Takeaways\n- Attackers use platforms such as YouTube and social media to share download links for fake installers to capitalize on user trust and drive clicks to malicious sites.\n- Threat actors often use reputable file hosting services like Mediafire and Mega.nz to conceal the origin of their malware and make detection and removal more difficult.\n- Many malicious downloads are password-protected and encoded, which complicates analysis in security environments such as sandboxes and allows malware to evade early detection.\n- Once infected, malware collects sensitive data from web browsers to steal credentials. This situation shows the serious risks of exposing your personal information by unknowingly downloading fraudulent software.\nIntroduction\nThe increase of fake installers bundled with info stealers is a growing threat for users looking for pirated software. These malicious programs disguise themselves as legitimate applications, often appearing in search results or\n[comments on platforms like GitHub](https://www.gendigital.com/blog/news/innovation/lumma-stealer-github). Unfortunately, many users fall prey to these tricks. The [Trend Micro™ Managed XDR](/en_gb/business/services/managed-xdr.html) service frequently sees the fallout, with the Lumma stealer being a prominent example. This highlights the hidden dangers of piracy that can jeopardize personal security and data integrity.\nInfo stealers are a type of malware that is designed to steal sensitive information from an infected system. This can include credentials, financial information, personal data, and other sensitive information that can be used for identity theft, fraud, or other malicious purposes.\nHow they lure their victims\nInfo stealers operate deceptively, luring victims into downloading the malware disguised as legitimate software installers. These download links often originate from fake websites or are shared as a link in messages from social platforms, as discussed in our\n[previous blog](/en_gb/research/23/j/beware-lumma-stealer-distributed-via-discord-cdn-.html).\nIn this blog, we want to highlight and break down how a typical user may stumble upon these download links of fake installers.\nVictims are lured into piracy by individuals posing as guides on popular video-sharing platforms like YouTube. These deceitful actors create a pretense of offering legitimate software installation tutorials to entice viewers to click on malicious links in the video descriptions or comments. This compromises users' devices and promotes a culture of theft. Here is an example.\nUpon accessing the link, a separate post on YouTube opens, revealing the download link for the fake installer.\nIn the following example, it leads to a download of the file from the Mediafire file hosting site:\nIn another case, the threat was uploaded to another file-hosting site called Mega.nz.\nIt's clear that the threat utilizes known file hosting services as another layer to obscure its download further and evade detection.\nIn the cases we will discuss in this blog, we observed that these threats are often distributed as fake installers or cracked software, which victims inadvertently encounter while searching for them on search engines.\nIn the sample below, specific keywords trigger search results for these entries.\nThe third item in the search results (refer to screenshot above) comes from OpenSea (an NFT marketplace), which is unusual because it hosted a downloadable file. The entry contains a shortened link that redirects to the actual link. One assumption is that they use shortened links to prevent scraping sites from accessing the download link.\nThe following link will prompt you for the actual download link and the zip file's password. Password-protecting the files can help prevent sandbox analysis of the initial file upon arrival, which can be a quick win for an adversary.\nThe fourth and last entry in the search results (refer to the search results screenshot above) came from SoundCloud, a music-sharing platform that hosted the download link with a corresponding description. In this case, the download link was shortened using Twitter.\nThe same user also posted additional entries that include means to download a specific file.\nContent from another entry made by the same user.\nSimilar to the first case, another site displays the download link and password.\nIn one of our download links, we discovered evidence of other entries they are attempting to fake, as shown in VirusTotal (VT).\nInfection analysis as seen by Managed XDR (post download)\nIn the next section, we will discuss instances where the download was successful and the content was executed. This case sample highlights the activities observed on the host.\nCase 1\nOne observation about the unpacked file is that its size is 900 MB. This large file size helps defense evasion and allows it to bypass sandbox analysis to appear more legitimate as an installer. Moreover, it is restricted from submission in VT.\nThe infection sequence is triggered upon executing the .exe file contained within the zip file.\nA threat has been detected involving the execution of batch files. The content of the batch file was sourced and, while different from the Managed XDR case, is still functionally similar.\nThe batch file contains obfuscated entries.\nThe first cleanup involves removing garbage entries.\nThe next step is to replace the variables, resulting in a clearer script.\nAccording to the batch file, it builds the AutoIt script by combining the multiple created files and executes it. Upon execution, we observed that it dropped several additional files.\nProcesses may be injected with its code, and a new legitimate binary is sometimes introduced for process injection.\nCollecting and preparing sensitive data from browser environments for credential access was completed through a copy file operation.\nThe process introduced by threat is also seen to establish connections to multiple command and control (C&C) addresses.\nBesides accessing its C&C, our investigation observed the threat committing a series of queries related to Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) domains.\nCase 2\nIn this second case, the infection started when a user downloaded a compressed file from a known file hosting site. Once downloaded, the user unpacks the file, which would require a password, and executes the installer. Upon execution, it proceeds to do a series of suspicious events, such as spawning a legitimate process and injecting its code into it. The threat also introduces a known scripting tool, AutoIt, to further obfuscate its execution, and later, it connects to its C&C to download and execute additional malware, typically different variants of infostealer.\nA snippet of the content of the zip file shows that, at a quick glance, it is just a standard application installer.\nSetup.exe is a version of rustdesk.exe, an open-source remote desktop access software identified on VirusTotal.\nThe zip file contains a trojanized file for rustdesk.exe, where one of the DLLs is tampered with. For this specific sample, the tampered DLL that was loaded by Setup.exe was flutter_gpu_texture_renderer_plugin.dll.\nWhen the file is executed, it displays an error but is already running in the background.\nIn the background, the following events have already taken place.\nInjecting malicious code into legitimate binaries, such as more.com, StrCmp.exe, SearchIndexer.exe, and explorer.exe, to evade detection by security defenses.\nIt drops additional files that are information stealers or malware from a different family.\nCreates autorun registry entry and scheduled tasks to ensure ongoing persistence.\nInjected processes were later observed, which initiated C&C communication.\nBundle of Stealers/Loaders\nThis time, it's not just a single info stealer but an army of recent noisy ones. This is not new, as it was also observed before with\n[raccoon stealers](https://threatpost.com/raccoon-stealer-google-seo/168301/).\nObserved stealers in the cases:\n- LUMMASTEALER\n- PRIVATELOADER\n- MARSSTEALER\n- AMADEY\n- PENGUISH\n- VIDAR\nRecap of the different methods of defense evasion observed in the case:\n- Utilization of large file size – a means to bypass sandbox capabilities\n- A password-protected zip file hinders content scanning and can complicate investigations if the password is unavailable.\n- The files are uploaded to known media-sharing sites, which most antivirus programs would only detect if the exact link is discovered before the download.\n- In some cases, download links are shortened, preventing scraping from sites.\n- The operation uses legitimate files and employs DLL sideloading or process injection to execute its payload.\nHow Managed XDR helps in the case of an info-stealer infection from fake installers\nDefense-in-depth is an important strategy that organizations use to protect their environments. In situations where a threat might have evaded some of these defense layers, Managed XDR can detect these incidents in real time. It offers the necessary analysis and actions to effectively contain the threat.\n- Threat hunting and human analyst augmented alerting - Some activities may not be captured by alerts or could generate low-severity alerts, which Trend Vision One users might overlook. Threat hunting proactively searches for known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) or emerging threats, ensuring that alerts are issued. Additionally, Managed Detection and Response (MDR) analysts can determine whether certain detections require further attention from the customer, reducing the burden on Trend Vision One users to check every alert.\n- Understanding the context of the alert – When a threat activity generates a detection, further correlation is necessary to provide context and capture the complete narrative of the events. Upon linking our findings to the initial alert, it becomes evident that most of the findings in the draft are not included in a single alert or detection. Additionally, some instances lack any related detection and were only connected through further investigation using the search application. As illustrated in the case findings shared earlier, these insights are obtained through the MXDR analyst's deeper investigation of the initial triggers, which may include threat hunting or alerts generated from a workbench.\n- Implementing response actions – As the fake installer infection progresses, MXDR analysts can initiate response actions to contain the threat on behalf of the customer. In the case we are dealing with, we have isolated the affected machines to prevent further spread. Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) have been added to the Suspicions Objects (SO) list to block any additional execution, and the suspicious files have been submitted to the analysis team for accurate detection.\nConclusion\nThreat actors continue to use social engineering tactics to target its victims and apply different methods to avoid security defenses, including: DLL sideloading, using large installer files, password-protected ZIP files, process injection into legitimate processes, connections to legitimate websites, and creating copies of files and renaming them to appear benign.\nIt is important to stay updated on current threats and to remain vigilant regarding detection and alert systems. Visibility is important because solely relying on detection can result in many malicious activities going unnoticed. Organizations should consider the following to stay ahead of these threats:\n- Implement a multi-layered defense approach for in-depth defense.\n- Provide user education.\n- Establish an incident response plan.\n- Engage in threat hunting.\n- Use a Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP).\nOrganizations can take advantage of\n[Trend Vision One™ – Endpoint Security](/en_gb/business/products/endpoint-security.html) for prevention, detection, and response for user endpoints, servers, cloud workloads, and data centers.\nManaged XDR offers a 24/7 managed detection and response (MDR) for email, endpoint, server, cloud workloads, and networks from our world-class MDR team\nTrend Vision One Threat Intelligence\nTo stay ahead of evolving threats, Trend Micro customers can also access a range of Intelligence Reports and Threat Insights within\n[Trend Vision One](/en_gb/business/products/one-platform.html). Threat Insights helps customers stay ahead of cyber threats before they happen and be better prepared for emerging threats. It offers comprehensive information on threat actors, their malicious activities, and the techniques they use.
