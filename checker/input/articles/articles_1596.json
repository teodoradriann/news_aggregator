    "title": "Jennifer Lopez Says She's 'Done' With Marriage After 4 Divorces | Us Weekly",
    "text": "Jennifer Lopez says she’s “done” with marriage following four divorces.\nWhen Lopez, 55, took the stage for her concert in Bilbao, Spain, on Wednesday, July 16, she noticed a fan sign that read, “J. Lo, marry me?”\n“I think I’m done with that,” the singer and actress replied, laughing. “I’ve tried that a few times.”\nFootage of Lopez’s response was posted via X, where a fan remarked, “She is soooo real for this.”\nShe is currently in Europe for her Up All Night Tour, which kicked off earlier this month and winds down in Kazakhstan on August 10.\nLopez has been married four times, with each union ending in divorce. In February, she and Ben Affleck finalized their split five months after Lopez filed paperwork to end their marriage.\nThe exes’ relationship had spanned more than 20 years. They first sparked a romance on the set of Gigli in 2001 and got engaged the following year. They were scheduled to walk down the aisle in September 2023, but called off their wedding several days ahead of the ceremony.\nLopez and Affleck rekindled the flame in May 2021 and tied the knot in July 2022.\nBy the spring of 2024, speculation swirled about their marital status. The pair had not been seen together for nearly two months. Us Weekly confirmed that May that Affleck moved out of their Beverly Hills home.\nA source exclusively told Us in June 2024 that they couldn’t “get on the same page [and had] been discussing divorce as an option.”\nThe following month, another source told Us, “They are going through so much individually and as a couple. They may take some time to see if this complicated moment can resolve itself and they come back to each other [as] better people.”\nLast August, Lopez submitted her divorce filing herself, without using an attorney. As celebrity divorce lawyer attorney Chris Melcher told Us at the time, her solo move was “intentional to send a message that this will not be a fight.”\nToday's Top Deals\nShe was previously married to Ojani Noa from 1997 to 1998, Cris Judd from 2001 to 2003 and Marc Anthony — with whom she shares twins Max and Emme — from 2004 to 2014. (Affleck, for his part, was married to Jennifer Garner from 2005 to 2018, and they coparent their three children, Violet, Seraphina and Samuel.)\nEarlier this month, Lopez invited 30 of her Los Angeles-based fans to a listening party where she debuted six new songs, including the pop ballad “Wreckage of You,” which she is currently performing on tour.\nEdgardo Luis Rivera, who attended the event, told Us that Lopez “said she was lying in bed after a long day of tour rehearsals when the idea of [“Wreckage of You”] came to her. She mentioned how last year was a very difficult time for her both personally and professionally. She had to cancel her tour and really focus on herself. Fast-forward to one year later, and she feels better and stronger than ever, so she wanted to write a song about coming out of a bad situation much stronger.”",

    "title": "Kelly Doran, Twin Cities real estate developer, dead at 66",
    "text": "Twin Cities real estate developer Kelly Doran, who founded both Doran Cos. and Doran Group, died overnight Thursday, Dec. 28, following a fight with cancer, a press release from the Doran Group announced. He was 66 years old. Doran, born in Duluth, was a leader in the multifamily housing industry, as well as in retail space. In 2007, he founded the powerhouse commercial real estate firm Doran Cos., which has three divisions — Doran Development, Doran Construction and Doran Management. In 2019, he sold his majority share in Doran Cos., before selling his final stakes in the company in 2021. He left the firm, now helmed by Anne Behrendt and Ryan Johnson, and started Doran Group, which he said at the time was so he could get back to building “the buildings that we own,” and that he “never liked doing third-party design and build work” that was performed at Doran Cos. Doran Group was a venture by Doran that he started with his son Evan Doran. Evan Doran is expected to take over the group, which he has helped lead since 2022 as president, according to the press release. “We are all saddened by my dad’s passing,” Evan Doran said. “He was not only an exceptional businessman, but also a loving father, grandfather and friend. He built this company from the ground up and instilled in all who worked with him a commitment to excellence, integrity and looking out for one another.” In an interview with Finance & Commerce earlier this month, Kelly Doran said Doran Group expects they will see 700 units in 2023, many of them luxury apartments. Some projects underway include The Reserve at Arbor Lakes in Maple Grove and a second building at The Triple Crown Residences at Canterbury in Shakopee. In the same interview, Kelly Doran said the processes for handing the reins to his son were underway and that he felt good about them. “He’s already doing a great job with what he’s taken on so far and I have no doubt that the future is bright for the company,” Kelly Doran said earlier this month. Prior to starting Doran Cos. in 2007, Doran was also the president of the Robert Muir Company from 1992 to 2005. In 2006, he launched a failed bid for the DFL nomination for governor.

    "text": "The speed at which news travels these days is breakneck. Unfortunately, though, that is also true about false narratives. For instance a fan posted a video on twitter that showed Raiders safety Trey Taylor picking up a Kermit The Frog puppet wearing a curly wig and wearing a Patrick Mahomes jersey.\nYou know, because people have long said that Mahomes’s voice sounds like Kermit. It does. He laughs about it. It’s funny.\nTaylor thought it was funny too. The 23-year-old rookie put the puppet on his hand and played with it a bit. And the media has utterly lost their collective minds over it.\nIt quickly became the Raiders who had the doll. As if it was theirs.\nThe #Raiders appear to have a Patrick Mahomes Kermit the Frog doll at training camp. 👀\n(🎥 @RaidersAQ )\npic.twitter.com/vaOs2TNrQh\n— Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate) July 25, 2024\nIf Ari had actually looked at the timeline of the fan who posted it, he’d see where he shows that he brought it to camp.\nOut here at training camp with Patrick Mahomes pic.twitter.com/YDw4AXBmM6\n— Q (@RaidersAQ) July 25, 2024\nBut that would require work and it would ruin all the fun. Others quickly joined the party, calling it “the Raiders Kermit Mahomes doll” which is to imply it was players on the team who were responsible for it. And that it was “dumb”.\nWell I’m sure there was a dumber thing to do…but I can’t seem to think of it at the moment https://t.co/ljiLAdsPxR\n— trey wingo (@wingoz) July 25, 2024\nAnd why is it so dumb? Well, because it could provoke Patrick Mahomes and the champs.\nAs we all know, definitely nothing bad ever happens to teams that give Patrick Mahomes even the slightest reason to get angry. https://t.co/kZq0Qxukty\n— Brett Kollmann (@BrettKollmann) July 25, 2024\nAnd that’s fine, if you think Trey Taylor playing with the puppet was a bad move. He’s a rookie. A kid. He’s never donned a Raiders game jersey or been part of this rivalry.\nThe problem is the lie that the puppet belongs to the Raiders. And it isn’t just tweets telling it. At least one site put that blatant lie in an actual headline about it.\nNew lows: Raiders bring 'Kermit the Frog' puppet to training camp, tease Patrick Mahomes https://t.co/EUuc7SmU8x pic.twitter.com/QRIETTaKMB\n— Chiefs Wire (@TheChiefsWire) July 25, 2024\nSo, will Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs take the (click) bait and use this silly puppet as some kind of motivation in their games against the Raiders? Who knows. Maybe when you’ve won the last two Super Bowls you have to dig deep to find new motivations.\nSeems to me their last loss coming to the Raiders on Christmas would be a much bigger motivation, so not sure this little puppet matters, really. But there’s sure a lot of folks in the media who *reeeeaally* want it to matter.",
