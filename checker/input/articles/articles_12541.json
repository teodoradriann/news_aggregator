    "title": "Bethlehem ‘without Christmas trees, without lights’ due to Israel-Hamas war | Watford Observer",
    "text": "Bethlehem, the normally bustling biblical birthplace of Jesus, resembles a ghost town this Christmas Eve, with celebrations called off due to the Israel-Hamas war. The festive lights and Christmas tree that normally decorate Manger Square are missing, as are the foreign tourists who gather each year to mark the holiday. Dozens of Palestinian security forces patrol the empty square. Gift shops have been slow to open on Christmas Eve, although a few did open their doors once the rain stopped pouring down. There are few visitors, however. Brother John Vinh, a Franciscan monk from Vietnam who has lived in Jerusalem for six years, said: “This year, without the Christmas tree and without lights, there’s just darkness.” He said he always comes to Bethlehem to mark Christmas, but this year was especially sobering, as he gazed at a nativity scene in Manger Square with a baby Jesus wrapped in a white shroud, symbolising the hundreds of children killed in the fighting in Gaza. Barbed wire surrounds the scene, with grey rubble added to the spectacle reflecting none of the lights and bursts of colour that normally fill the square during the Christmas season. Ala’a Salameh, one of the owners of Afteem Restaurant, a family-owned falafel restaurant just steps from the square, said: “We can’t justify putting out a tree and celebrating as normal, when some people (in Gaza) don’t even have houses to go to.” Mr Salameh said Christmas Eve is usually the busiest day of the year. “Normally, you can’t find a single chair to sit, we’re full from morning till midnight,” he said. This year, just one table was taken – by journalists sheltering from the rain. He said his restaurant was operating at about 15% of normal business and was not able to cover operating costs. Mr Salameh estimated that even after the war ends, it will take another year for tourism to return to Bethlehem as normal. The cancellation of Christmas festivities is a severe blow to the town’s economy. Tourism accounts for an estimated 70% of Bethlehem’s income – almost all of that during the Christmas season. With many major airlines cancelling flights to Israel, few foreigners are visiting. Local officials say around 70 hotels in Bethlehem have been forced to close, leaving thousands of people unemployed. More than 20,000 Palestinians have been killed and more than 50,000 wounded during Israel’s air and ground offensive against Gaza’s Hamas rulers, according to health officials there, while some 85% of the territory’s 2.3 million residents have been displaced. The war was triggered by Hamas’ deadly assault October 7 on southern Israel in which militants killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took more than 240 hostages. The fighting in Gaza has also affected life in the West Bank. Since October 7, access to Bethlehem and other Palestinian towns in the Israeli-occupied territory has been difficult, with long lines of motorists waiting to pass military checkpoints. The restrictions have also prevented tens of thousands of Palestinians from exiting the territory to work in Israel.

Read our privacy policy Newly-identified dinosaur footprints on the Isle of Skye reveal herbivores and carnivores coexisted at freshwater lagoons some 167 million years ago.\nA University of Edinburgh team analysed 131 footprints at Prince Charles’s Point, on the island’s Trotternish Peninsula, uncovering evidence of a diverse ecosystem.\nAmong the tracks were rare prints of megalosaurs – a jeep-sized theropod and cousin and ancestor of the T.Rex – alongside those of plant-eating sauropods - long-necked herbivores possibly two or three times the size of an elephant, identifiable by their large, circular footprints.\nThe footprints were once considered by geologists to have been resting burrows of fish.\nThe researchers said the site provides a “fascinating insight” into the environmental preferences and behaviours of dinosaurs from the Middle Jurassic period.\nopen image in gallery A pair of theropod footprints, as seen on site a Prince Charles's Point on the Isle of Skye in 2021 (Paige E. de Polo/University of Edinburgh/PA Wire) Analysis of the multi-directional tracks and walking gaits, they explained, suggest the prehistoric beasts milled around the lagoon’s margins, similar to how animals congregate around watering holes today.\nThey added that the tracks show that regardless of dominance, the meat-eating therapods and plant-eating sauropods habitually spent time in lagoons, as opposed to exposed, drier mudflats.\nResearch lead Tone Blakesley said: “The footprints at Prince Charles’s Point provide a fascinating insight into the behaviours and environmental distributions of meat-eating theropods and plant-eating, long-necked sauropods during an important time in their evolution.\n“On Skye, these dinosaurs clearly preferred shallowly submerged lagoon environments over subaerially exposed mudflats.”\nopen image in gallery An artist rendition of meat eating megalosaurs and plant eating sauropods mingling at a site on Prince Charles's Point on the Isle of Skye (Tone Blakesley/Scott Reid/University of Edinburgh/PA Wire) The first three footprints at the site were discovered five years ago by a University of Edinburgh student and colleagues during a visit to the shoreline.\nSubsequent discoveries of other footprints in the area made it one of the most extensive dinosaur track sites in Scotland, with scientists saying they expect to find more.\nThe research team studied the tracks by taking thousands of overlapping photographs of the entire site with a drone, before using specialist software software to construct 3D models of the footprints via a technique called photogrammetry.\nSteve Brusatte, personal chair of palaeontology and evolution at the University of Edinburgh, reflected on the fact the remote bay on the Trotternish Peninsula was also where Bonnie Prince Charlie hid in 1746 while on the run from British troops.\n“Prince Charles’s Point is a place where Scottish history and prehistory blend together,” he said.\n“It’s astounding to think that when Bonnie Prince Charlie was running for his life, he might have been sprinting in the footsteps of dinosaurs.”\nThe research, published in PLOS One, was funded by the Leverhulme Trust and National Geographic Society.\nMore about University Of Edinburgh Isle of Skye palaeontology Dinosaurs Join our commenting forum Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\nComments\nMost Popular Popular videos Sponsored Features",
