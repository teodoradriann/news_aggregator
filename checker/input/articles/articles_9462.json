    "title": "MEC Nonkqubela Pieters hands over spring water protection projects to Zweledinga village",
    "text": "The government is changing people’s lives for better\nEastern Cape MEC for the department of Rural Development and Agrarian Reform (DRDAR) Nonkqubela Pieters yesterday (subs; 14 February 2024) said the government was bringing change to the people’s lives so that they could live better.\nSpeaking during the official handover of spring water protection project constructed by her Department for more than 380 Zweledinga village households in Whittlesea, the MEC stressed that changes made by government were visible.\n“Whoever says yesterday is same like today might suffering from a poor eyesight, we can get that person spectacles from the Phelophepha train (a government healthcare train).\n“Today is much different, it’s spectacular and tomorrow will be much different because things are changing. There was no water in Zweledinga previously but today there’s water. That means what you don’t have today, you will get tomorrow,” Pieters said.\nThe delivery of spring water protection projects by MEC Pieters marks the completion of infrastructure work done by the Department in a number of rural communities of the Eastern Cape that will now have reliable access to clean fresh water as part of the implementation of the province’s rural development programme.\nShe said when the mandate of the then agriculture department was changed to include rural development, government saw a need for developmental programmes like provision of water to support agricultural activities.\n“This is meant to develop the farming activities here so that people can become sustainable business people. Farming is business that should be treated as such not something to boost about during traditional ceremonies. People of Zweledinga, you now have enablers, you have the land and water now you must work even harder,” Pieters said.\nShe explained that government was not waking people up from their beds and force development but people should take initiatives to be supported. “We want to see your commitment so that when we intervene and invest so that you can make money,” she added.\nThe Department constructed these projects following the announcement by the MEC during the tabling of the Department’s Policy Speech at the Eastern Cape Legislature, where she announced that R5,3 million was aside for 8 projects across the province.\nBecause of this investment in water infrastructure rural communities that previously had no access to water will now get access to clean fresh drinking water for consumption and agriculture activities.\nDRDAR’s Rural Appropriation Technology Unit (RATU) implement this project, trains locals to be labourers, procure material for the construction of this project which will now provide access to clean fresh water for Zweledinga villagers, a local school, local farmers producing vegetables and livestock farming who will now have reliable water to irrigate their vegetables and livestock.\nDuring this project about 59 local residents were trained and employed for the rollout of the project, including maintenance when there are challenges with infrastructure.\n“In this programme we don’t have a middleman and spend millions on contractors for something that will not be operational. We employ and train local people and in that way we create opportunities for people to fend for their families,” said Pieters.\nA jubilant resident and farmer, Bukiwe Ntathawe said she was glad that they have access to clean fresh water and she thanked government’s support.\n“We have been battling for a long time for water but our government has heard our pleas hence this assistance. We are now able to produce vegetables like cabbages something that was impossible before and our livestock also have access to water. Our gardens are now flourishing and this water tastes nice as they are not salty like the water from boreholes,” Ntathawe said.\nAnother resident, Lwando Sikeyi said he had no words to explain his joy and that of his community.\n“The provision of this water has assisted us a lot, we are able to do things that we could not do before. As a farmer, I’m now producing good crops and vegetables because of I’m able to irrigate my produce. I am very thankful about what government has done us,” Sikeyi said, adding that the water tasting “good.”\nIn delivering these spring water protection projects DRDAR identifies nearby hills and mountains with spring water, connect infrastructure channeling water to installed communal taps for use by households and 40 taps were installed in Zweledinga.\nTo date a total of 757 water taps have been installed in 36 villages across the province, benefitting 8 781 households, 4 schools, 1 clinic and 1 youth co-operative\nThe programme is aligned with food security program in each village as it is meant to support communities to produce their own food.\nFor more information please contact:\nMvusiwekhaya Sicwetsha (Chief Director Communications and Customer Care Services)\nCell: 082 955 8833",

    "text": "Good morning. This is the Thursday, Dec. 28 edition of First Up, the Star’s daily morning digest. Sign up\nto get it earlier each day, in your inbox.\nHere’s the latest on the recent spike in labour trafficking prosecutions, the future of Toronto’s parking meters and Toronto churches’ struggle to shelter refugees.\nDON’T MISS:\nThis Mountie helped dismantle a suspected labour trafficking ring — now he’s accused of starting his own\nIn late 2019, investigators had just dismantled what they alleged was a large labour trafficking ring in the Hamilton area. Officers criminally charged six people under worker exploitation laws after finding as many as 80 foreign workers housed in bug- and vermin-infested conditions, and being sent to work across southern Ontario, police said at the time. Now, police allege RCMP Const. Yahsif Israel Mane Monter learned how the Hamilton trafficking scheme operated — and then started his own, Sara Mojtehedzadeh and Rachel Mendleson report.\nHere’s what else police material obtained by the Star reveals.\nWait, what? Monter was arrested in May 2022 on human trafficking and several other charges, including firearm violations and animal cruelty related to his dog-breeding business, “Taskforce Rottweilers.”\nWord from Monter: Monter, who has been released on bail ahead of his scheduled May 2024 trial, declined to comment. His lawyer said he “will be pleading not guilty.”\nTime’s up for Toronto’s coin-only parking meters\nYou might be interested in\nIn 2000, Toronto had 16,000 coin-only parking meters. Today, only 178 remain — but their time is up, David Rider reports. The technological dinosaurs will be gone in the new year in the name of progress and city finances. They could be replaced with pay-and-display boxes, the city’s new “pay by plate” machines or even a new “mobile only” zones with no device at all.\nHere’s how the relics made their way into the city — and why they’re on their way out.\nWait, what? “We are collecting, on average, about 18 cents a day at single-space meters that cost about 87 cents a day to operate,” said Jeff Dea, the Toronto Parking Authority’s vice-president of business development. “They are really old, they’re at the end of their service life, they’re not running well and require continual maintenance so it’s time to pull them off the street and replace them with something better.”\nMore: Dea said the parking authority’s modernization plan also foresees the use of cameras to automatically record licence plates and bill the vehicle’s owner.\nCiting dwindling government support, Toronto churches are forced to close their doors to refugees\nFor nearly six months, volunteers and staff at two Toronto churches have worked overtime to shelter, support and feed hundreds of refugees arriving at their doors. But church leaders have seen the growing toll, from shelter workers experiencing psychological breakdowns to mounting personal credit card debt as the churches wrack up more than $800,000 in bills, Emily Fagan reports. Meanwhile, donations are dwindling and government support is sparse.\nHere’s why one church leader was shocked to hear the government wouldn’t be helping more.\nWord from Toronto: A spokesperson for the city said Toronto is working to support refugee claimants — but the absence of $97 million in promised federal funding has been challenging. The city estimates it will have spent $103 million supporting refugees this year, with hopes the federal government reimburses the money.\nWord from Ottawa: An Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada spokesperson said minister Marc Miller is in touch with Mayor Olivia Chow to discuss solutions, citing the $7 million asylum seekers reception centre in Peel Region announced last month.\nWHAT ELSE:\n-\nWant to see Doug Ford and Pierre Poilievre lose? Then the left needs to get its act together, Martin Regg Cohn writes.\n-\nThe UN is warning of impeded aid deliveries to Gaza as Israel expands its offensive. Here’s the latest.\n-\nPeel police are investigating a potential link between a gold seizure in Montreal and gold heist at Pearson Airport.\n-\nDonald Trump says he didn’t know his immigration rhetoric echoes Hitler. That’s part of a broader pattern.\n-\nProfits, losses and the bottom line. Here are five Canadian stocks to watch in 2024.\n-\nWhen did so many famous faces start looking the same? The look has never been mor e common — or achievable.\n-\nHere’s what will be trending in cruising in 2024, from the rise of boutique ships to the extra-extra long stay.\nPOV:\nCLOSE-UP:\nSOUTHERN GAZA: Palestinian journalists attempt to connect to the internet in Rafah on Wednesday, amid continuing battles between Israel and Hamas. Power cuts have become a fact of life in war-torn Gaza, but embedded SIM cards allow Palestinians to access the internet and stay in touch with loved ones abroad.\nThank you for reading First Up.

    "text": "【大紀元2025年04月17日訊】（大紀元記者李馨綜合報導）美國《時代》（Time）週刊週三（4月16日）公布了該雜誌「全球百名最具影響力人物」名單，美國總統川普（特朗普）及其政府的五名成員上榜，這也是自2009年以來單一政府入選人數最多的一次。\n在《時代》週刊公布的2025年度全球100位最具影響力人物（100 Most Influential People of 2025）名單上，川普及其政府的五名成員入選，他們是：副總統萬斯（JD Vance）、總統高級顧問埃隆‧馬斯克（Elon Musk）、衛生與公眾服務部（HHS）部長小羅伯特‧肯尼迪（Robert F. Kennedy Jr.）、商務部長霍華德‧盧特尼克（Howard Lutnick），以及白宮行政管理和預算局（Office of Management and Budget，簡稱OMB）局長拉塞爾‧沃特（Russell Vought）。\n在一屆政府中共有六名官員入選《時代》雜誌年度「全球百名最具影響力人物」名單，這是最大的單一政府入選陣營，也是自2009年以來的首次。上一次的紀錄是由美國前總統奧巴馬的政府創下的，當時正值其第一任期之初。\n《時代》週刊這一百強榜的評選與該雜誌的「年度風雲人物」（Person of the Year）評選是分開的。\n川普也是《時代》週刊2024年的「年度風雲人物」，該雜誌於去年12月宣布了這一評選結果。\n到4月30日，川普的第二任期將滿100天，儘管時間不長，但他的議程已經對美國的移民、外交政策、國際貿易和聯邦勞動力等問題產生了巨大影響。\n《時代》雜誌資深記者布萊恩‧貝內特（Brian Bennett）在談到川普的影響力時寫道，「沒有哪位現代總統像唐納德‧川普那樣強有力地控制了美國政府。」他補充說，在接下來的任期中，川普將繼續展現他能對美國和全世界施加多大的影響力。\n《時代》週刊華盛頓分社社長馬西莫‧卡拉布雷西（Massimo Calabresi）在談到萬斯的入選時強調，萬斯作為川普政府的二把手發揮了重要作用。\n馬斯克正在領導政府效率部（DOGE）對聯邦機構進行大刀闊斧的改革，並因大量裁減政府雇員、縮減聯邦機構規模而引發了巨大爭議。\n肯尼迪是一名反疫苗倡導者，《時代》指出，他在改變美國醫療政策方面正在發揮重大作用。\n盧特尼克長期以來一直主張對從其它國家進口的商品徵收關稅，以刺激美國製造業的發展，並對那些他認為不利的貿易政策進行懲罰。在當前川普政府的關稅戰中，盧特尼克所處的地位和作用尤其重要。\n沃特是川普團隊中不太引人注目的成員之一，但《時代》週刊指出，他是「川普令人震驚的第二任期議程的設計師」。\n《時代》雜誌資深政治記者埃里克‧科特萊薩（Eric Cortellessa）寫道：「沃特也許會保持低調，但他是這場顛覆華盛頓的革命的思想燈塔。」\n（本文參考了《國會山報》報導）\n責任編輯：林妍#",

La regione resterà parzialmente isolata per almeno 2 settimane Le auto sommerse dalla furia degli elementi (Keystone) 1 novembre 2024 | Ats, a cura di Red.Web A tre giorni dalla catastrofe causata dalla Dana nella regione di Valencia, che ha provocato finora 158 morti, continuano senza sosta le ricerche dei dispersi, il cui numero resta ancora imprecisato.\nL'emergenza resta alta dopo che circa 366'000 abitanti di una ventina di municipi sono ancora senza acqua potabile mentre 50'000 sono al buio.\nPer la mancanza di acqua a causa delle condotte scoppiate per l'inondazione, in alcuni comuni non è possibile procedere con la pulizia del fango che nel frattempo si è seccato. Altri 500 soldati si uniranno oggi agli oltre 1'200 impegnati nell'emergenza nella regione dove è previsto anche l'arrivo del ministro dell'Interno, Fernando Grande-Marlaska. La priorità è garantire beni di prima necessità, come acqua, cibo e medicine, alle popolazioni colpite.\nLa Comunità Valenciana resterà isolata dai collegamenti ferroviari con Madrid e in parte dalla Catalogna per almeno 2 settimane dopo i danni notevoli alla ferrovia: inoltre, 150 arterie della rete stradale sono devastate, mentre restano interrotti vari tratti dell'autostrada A7 di collegamento con Madrid, con colonne di decine di camion e auto fermi ai margini dell'autostrada.\nAl momento sono state recuperate 158 vittime. I medici hanno effettuato le autopsie nell'obitorio allestito in un parcheggio: 15 le persone già identificate. Un secondo obitorio è stato allestito nella Fiera di Valencia, dove saranno trasferite le altre salme recuperate.\nResta connesso con la tua comunità leggendo laRegione: ora siamo anche su Whatsapp!

    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Middlesex County, Connecticut from 1901-2000 was 30.6. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Middlesex County, Connecticut experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Middlesex County, Connecticut history.",
