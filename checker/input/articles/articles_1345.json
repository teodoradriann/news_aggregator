    "text": "Two tornadoes were confirmed to have touched down a minute apart in Randolph County during the early morning storms Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service. No injuries were reported. The first tornado, an EF-1 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale , touched down west of County Road 2160 at 1:43 a.m. and lifted near Moberly at 1:56 a.m., according to the NWS. It reached speeds of 90 miles per hour and had a length of 8.65 miles. The tornado damaged and downed trees along its path, also downing several power lines and poles and causing damage to homes and barns.It also destroyed a water tank, blowing part of its remnants 100 yards to the northeast. The second tornado, an EF-0, developed just southwest of Higbee at 1:44 a.m. and caused damage to a large part of the town's southern portion, the NWS reported. It had a length of 2.06 miles, lifting near County Road 2560 northeast of town at 1:47 a.m. Most of the tornadoes' damage was limited to trees. Several large trees were downed, with some falling onto property causing damage to cars and residences along Route A. It also displaced a car several feet in a parking lot and blew a trailer into a business property, which had significant roof damage. Two tornadoes were reported in the Kansas City area and three tornadoes in the St. Louis area, all of them resulting from the same group of storms.",

    "text": "Urgent: New Agent Compensation Rules Threaten Black Real Estate Professionals, Create Barriers to Black Homeownership\nDr. Courtney Johnson Rose, NAREB President\nBlack real estate agents) who serve on behalf of the buyers over 70% of the time, will potentially suffer the most financial hardship within the industry\nThis is harmful to the entire real estate industry, from agents to appraisers to loan officers...because, with white homeownership at 74%, substantial growth will have to come from people of color” — Dr. Courtney Johnson Rose WASHINGTON, DC, UNITED STATES, August 15, 2024 / EINPresswire.com / -- Dr. Courtney Johnson Rose, President of the National Association of Real Estate Brokers (NAREB), warned today that imminent changes in the agent compensation formula for home purchases threaten the financial stability of Black real estate professionals while creating new barriers to increasing homeownership for African Americans.\n“We are entering an uncertain period for Black families and the real estate professionals who serve them,” cautioned Dr. Rose. “For decades, the public, private, and non-profit sectors have worked to overcome the blatant racism that prevented many Black families from becoming homeowners and building generational wealth. We must ensure that new barriers are not constructed that stall or jeopardize our progress.”\nThe real estate industry is aligning with a negotiated settlement in a Missouri case that challenged a decades-old system requiring the agents of home sellers to split the commission on sales with the agents of home buyers. Starting Saturday, August 17, home sellers and their agents can no longer outline compensation for agents representing buyers within their MLS listings. They can, however, negotiate outside of the official listing.\nIn practice, buyer agents can no longer depend on the seller's payment from the sales proceeds. That burden may now fall upon the buyers, adding to the cash they need at closing. With average commissions ranging between five and six percent of the home sales price, even a modest home of $300,000 requires an additional payment of $15,000 to close the deal. This can be a challenge for Black homebuyers, who often struggle to save for their downpayment. Adding the agent commission could be even more burdensome for the buyers.\nMeanwhile, Black real estate agents (members of NAREB are known as Realtists), who serve on behalf of the buyers over 70% of the time, will potentially suffer the most financial hardship within the industry. Their livelihoods may be at stake.\n“This is a devastating hit for our Realtists and other Black real estate professionals,” Dr. Rose said. “Hispanic and Asian agents, who also disproportionately serve as agents for buyers, will also be impacted. This is harmful to the entire real estate industry, from agents to appraisers to loan officers to mortgage companies, because, with white homeownership at 74%, substantial growth will have to come from people of color. Increasing our homeownership will become more difficult once these rules are in place.”\nSpecifically, Dr. Rose cited a study by the National Association of Realtors projecting that 1.5 million Black households, 775,000 Asian households, and 2.2 million Hispanic households are expected to reach the median homebuying age over the next five years. She warned that changes that disrupt this projection could have far-reaching impacts on the nation’s economy.\nMoreover, Dr. Rose is concerned that Black homebuyers, many of whom will be purchasing homes for the first time, may proceed without the assistance of an agent because they can’t afford the cost. “Predatory lending scams target Black communities the hardest,” she said. “Our families badly need financial literacy counseling and other information about the steps to buying a home. They need Realtists by their side.”\nFurther, Dr. Rose said these changes are not the only threat. Recently, she met with the U.S. Department of Justice, which is reviewing the practices within the real estate industry. She asserted that many families and agents could be hurt by their actions and specifically mentioned the vulnerabilities of Black families and real estate professionals.\n“Today, we are devising ways to survive the hand that the settlement has dealt us,” Dr. Rose said. “It will be a major adjustment and shift for agents. I receive calls from agents worried that they won’t survive in the business as buyers' agents. We are assisting and tooling our members with the resources and training they need to continue despite these recent changes. We hosted several sessions on these issues at our recent conferences and are releasing a toolkit to assist our Realtists further.”\nDr. Rose said, “The goal of all parties is to increase homeownership because of the societal benefits from building wealth to safer neighborhoods. That should be the priority by all entities and stakeholders rather than altering the industry.”\n****\nFor print or broadcast interviews with NAREB President Courtney Johnson Rose, contact Michael Frisby at Mike@frisbyassociates.com or 202-625-4328.)\nABOUT THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REAL ESTATE BROKERS\nNAREB was formed in 1947 to secure equal housing opportunities regardless of race, creed, or color. NAREB has advocated for legislation and supported or instigated legal challenges that ensure fair housing, sustainable homeownership, and access to credit for Black Americans. Simultaneously, NAREB advocates for and promotes access to business opportunities for Black real estate professionals in each real estate discipline. From the past to the present, NAREB remains an association that is proud of its history, dedicated to its chosen struggle, and unrelenting in its pursuit of the REALTIST ® ’s mission/vision embedded goal, “Democracy in Housing.”\nMichael K.

The enemy lost much of the ability to see and eavesdrop to target the resistance and monitor their movements.”\n1703805731\n#Israel #penetrates #cameras #homes #shops #south.. #Hezbollah #asked #citizens\nRead more: We are waiting for Prime Minister Mishustin and a lot of Kazakh food: online from the first day of Innoprom | e1.ru",

    "text": "One of the nation’ top children’s hospitals must pay $45,000 to settle a religious discrimination lawsuit filed by a maintenance worker who refused to get a flu shot for religious reasons.\nDeMaurius Jackson worked at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta (CHOA) in Georgia as a maintenance assistant. According to court documents, Jackson’s duties primarily consisted of groundskeeping in outdoor parking lots, which required minimal interaction with the public. Jackson said his work involved no close proximity to patients, visitors, or staff.\nAccording to Jackson’s complaint, he converted to Judaism in November of 2016. In 2017 and 2018, Jackson requested and received a religious accommodation exemption from the CHOA’s flu vaccination requirement. However, in 2019, the hospital denied Jackson’s written request and fired him.\nJackson filed a complaint with the U.S. Equal Employ­ment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and said that in addition to denying the exemption, his supervisor “began trying to convince Jackson not to convert, telling him he was not a ‘real Jew,’ calling him a gentile, and purposefully ordering pork products for employee appreciation lunches despite Jackson’s objections.”\n...\nAccording to the complaint, Jackson is a member of the New Covenant Congregation of Israel, a “Messianic Hebrew Israelite” organization that believes “in the teachings of both the Old and New Testaments of the Holy Bible.” All major denominations of Judaism have rejected Messianic Judaism as a form of Judaism.\nThe EEOC sued in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia for violation of Jackson’s civil rights under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits firing an employee because of their religion and requires that employers reasonably accommodate the sincerely held religious beliefs of their employees. The case proceeded before U.S. District Judge Michael L. Brown, a Donald Trump appointee.\nThe agency announced Friday that CHOA will pay $45,000 to Jackson settle the case. Per the consent decree, CHOA will also adjust its flu vaccine policy to pre­sume a religious exemption for employees with remote workstations or who otherwise work away from the presence of other employees or patients. Further, CHOA agreed to protect ability of employees to seek transfer to alternative positions if a religious vaccine exemption request is denied. CHOA also agreed to train its employees on religious accommodation rights under Title VII. CHOA also agreed to provide Jackson with a “neutral letter of recommendation” for his employment files.\n“It is the responsibility of an employer to accommodate its employees’ sincerely held religious beliefs,” said Marcus G. Keegan, the regional attorney for the EEOC’s Atlanta District Office. “Unless doing so would require more than a minimal cost, an employer may not deny requested religious accommodations, let alone revoke those previously granted without issue. The EEOC is pleased that the employee has been compensated and that CHOA has agreed to take steps to ensure that it meets its obligation to evaluate religious accommodation requests in a manner consistent with federal law.”\nDarrell Graham, district director of the Atlanta office, said, “The arbitrary denial of religious accommodations drives religious discrimination in the workplace. The EEOC remains committed to enforcing the laws that protect employees’ religious practices.”\nThe settlement between CHOA and the EEOC occurred before the completion of the discovery process. Therefore, Jackson’s allegations, including those relating to comments made by his supervisor, were not specifically proven as part of the litigation process.\nAttorneys for the parties did not immediately respond to request for comment.\nJackson’s employment case raised two subjects that have been hotly contested in the nation’s appellate courts in recent years: the scope of religious liberty and discrimination, and the legality of various vaccine mandates.\nThe United States Supreme Court has sided with an evangelical Christian postal worker who said that his religious freedom was violated when he was forced to surrender his job as the only means of avoiding delivering Amazon packages on weekends. Similarly, the Court ruled in 2022 that Maine must subsidize tuition at religious schools.\nJustice Neil Gorsuch wrote the decision that formally overruled the 1971 case of Lemon v. Kurtzman, which had limited the extent to which public schoolteachers could lead or participate in prayers with students on school grounds. Justice Samuel Alito, meanwhile, said publicly last summer that religion is “under attack” in the United States.\nVaccine requirements have become more common at both public and private workplaces in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, and lawsuits challenging those requirements have seen mixed results.",

    "text": "Religious scholars from various schools of thought on Saturday denounced the convictions of PTI founder Imran Khan and his spouse Bushra Bibi in the iddat case, terming the court’s verdict “controversial” and “against Shariah”. They further demanded that all the persons involved in the case, including the petitioner, be brought to justice and offer an apology to the affected party. They expressed their unanimous view that the iddat case lacked any basis in religious, Sharia, or legal jurisprudence. They collectively believed that the case was politically motivated. Imran and his wife Bushra Bibi were convicted in a case concerning their marriage during the iddat period. Addressing a news conference alongside Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) Chairman Hamid Raza and Majlis Wahdatal Muslimeen Pakistan (MWMP) President Allama Raja Nasir Abbas at the National Press Club Islamabad, former religious affairs minister Noorul Haq Qadri observed that the court verdict in the iddat case had violated the Shariah orders and subjected a “veiled woman” (Bushra Bibi) to character assassination. He termed the court’s decision “controversial” and “against Shariat” and urged the superior judiciary to withdraw it. Qadri demanded that that all the persons involved in the case, including the petitioner, be brought to justice and offer an apology to Imran and Bushra Bibi. Speaking on the occasion, Raza lamented that the “honour” of a woman was targeted. “In our society, women are kept away from such matters even during hostilities. No one has the authority to change the given Shariah orders but the moderate class gave an abominable decision,” he said. The SIC chief maintained that an opinion could be sought from the Council of Islamic Ideology on such a “sensitive issue”. Abbas noted that according to fiqah, only the woman’s testimony was deemed credible in matters of iddat. He said Bushra Bibi observed purdah and “humiliating her” was a reprehensible act.
