    "text": "01 dicembre 2024 a a a Tra i grandi scornati dello sciopero flop di venerdì non ci sono solo Maurizio Landini e Pierpaolo Bombardieri, ma anche la leader del Pd Elly Schlein. Ringalluzzita dai risultati dell’ultimo turno delle regionali, con le vittorie in Emilia Romagna e Umbria, la dem si è ributtata nella mischia con due grandi classici della sinistra: la Sanità e la Scuola. Solo pochi giorni fa, replicando al premier Meloni, la segretaria Pd spiegava che «è bellissima una sanità pubblica che cura indipendentemente da quanti soldi hai in tasca; è bellissima una scuola pubblica che dia istruzione di qualità». Posizione ribadita anche nell’ultima direzione del partito, al termine della quale Schlein ha annunciato una nuova «mobilitazione di piazza» proprio su questi temi. E condivisa con la sinistra estrema di Avs, che con Angelo Bonelli rilancia: «Ci troviamo difronte a una manovra che aggredisce la sanità pubblica, la scuola, i servizi di trasporto e il ceto medio di questo Paese».

    "title": "Never Look Away Review: Lucy Lawless' Kinetic War Journo Doc",
    "text": "Lucy Lawless’ Kinetic Doc Debut, Never Look Away Puts a Face to War Journalism [Movies](/movies) [Reviews](/articles/movies/reviews) [Sundance 2024](/search?q=Sundance+2024) While we’re currently inundated with troubling, heartbreaking photos and videos from around the world thanks to social media, it wasn’t so long ago that the only way the outside world got a sense of the sheer scope and human cost of geopolitical atrocities was by journalists traveling in, and getting their footage out. The Vietnam War moved our cultural images of war away from the powerful still images of WWII and towards the painful reality of action. You can know there’s violence when you see it, but you can feel the violence when there’s movement. Camerawoman Margaret Moth was one of those braving war zones to inform the world, this time filling the groundbreaking 24-hour needs of the newly founded CNN with the conflicts of the ‘90s. Directed by Lucy Lawless in her debut, Never Look Away documents the life and career of the spitfire with the same relentless energy as its adrenaline-junkie subject—and gives us a sense of what kind of person was putting themselves in danger to bring us the news. Never Look Away alternates between interview subjects and harrowing footage describing the life of a cameraperson covering war, and interview subjects and harrowing footage describing Moth. The two blur together before we have much sense of the latter, caught up in the blustery bravado of a combat zone montage set to [Heart’s “Barracuda.”](https://www.pastemagazine.com/music/heart/heart-1977-live-performance-concert) It’s here that Lawless, documenting the life of fellow Kiwi Moth, gives in most to the least generous reading of her subject: The rocker adrenaline junkie who got a headbanging rush from tanks rolling in, explosions detonating and civilians grieving. It’s not that Heart is a bad touchstone—though Moth’s pitch-black ‘80s shag and dark eyeliner more precisely channeled Joan Jett, or Elvira in combat boots—but that the juxtaposition is willfully blunt. Lawless sees Moth as a complex, wounded, principled figure. Introducing Never Look Away with a snuff music video grabs us by the collar, but it’s a disingenuously uncritical stance the rest of the movie doesn’t hold. Most of the doc shows real empathy for the rebellious trailblazer (a bit too much, perhaps, when we learn she was dating a 17-year-old at age 30) who died of cancer in 2010. Never Look Away clearly admires Moth’s confident convictions: A “lion tamer” in the circus of her life, she fled New Zealand to pound psychedelics in Houston before becoming one of CNN’s first camerawomen. Moth was skateboarding, skydiving and ever-seeking excitement. As one of her lovers notes, if you got boring, you were gone. That’s a kind of person we all know, and the familiarity these descriptors hold can give way to some simple, indulgent metaphors. “War coverage was just a different drug,” that kind of thing. These accompany repeated adjectives (“fearless” comes up a lot, possibly taken from the first doc about Moth, CNN’s 2009 film Fearless: the Margaret Moth Story) and speculation from the people, mostly men, who knew her in life. Watching her colleagues wonder about her life before she stood on Lebanese rooftops waiting for the missiles to strike or smoked cigars in Kuwait with General Schwarzkopf is just as insufficient as actually hearing her siblings recount their upbringing. It all feels antithetical to a woman whose self-actualizing reinvention put a premium on the here and now. On the work. Anything we hear from her exes, her friends, her family, it’s all struggling for the same elegance as the copious, affecting footage Moth captured with her camera. Lawless’ most promising skill is in her wrangling of all this archival material. She and editors Whetham Allpress and Tim Woodhouse craft kinetic, high-intensity rundowns of ‘80s and ‘90s world events. Tiananmen Square runs headlong into Desert Storm, which collides into the Bosnian War and Israeli airstrikes. When we finally come up for air, listening to one of the talking heads emphasize how overwhelming (and addicting) war can be, we’re just grateful to get a second to ourselves. We’re also more tapped into Moth’s headspace than ever. This is where she thrived, where she brought her camera in tight and stared violence in the face, daring it to blink. Her work and personal life combined in one of these games of geopolitical chicken: When filming in Sniper Alley in Bosnia’s Sarajevo, where journalists became explicit targets, she was shot in the face. Lawless attempts a little stylistic flourish here, bringing us into the scene with one of her colleagues (who was in the same car, spattered by Moth’s blood) narrating over a diorama-like setting that’s got the smoothness and single-color palette of a 3-D printed creation. This—and some weird actorly interludes representing Moth’s inner strength—mostly miss. Nothing was ever going to come close to the brutal, graphic detail of the narration and images, and you get the sense that this is how Moth would want the event described: Bold, matter-of-fact, no pussyfooting around. A sniper nearly took her head off. In fact, he almost shot her lower jaw completely off. Gory surgical photos and post-op interviews—as she learns to speak through a reconstructed jaw, no teeth and a partially missing tongue—ground us in her pain. Our experience with her so far, of how desperate she is to work and how meticulously she crafts her image, enhances our empathy. Watching her get back in the field less than a year later, overcoming the ableism now augmenting the sexism that already confronted her, is downright amazing. Never Look Away’s final message, not about Moth, but about the necessity of journalistic images is, like Moth, a time capsule of a past we’ll never return to. Moth’s footage, uniquely visceral, once shaped the opinions and emotions of nations. Now, as we have become so numbed by the on-the-ground images shot by amateurs and distributed over social media, the idea that a single piece of footage could enact change feels like an idealistic pipe dream. To Moth—a witchy badass straight out of a journalism giallo—it was, and she lived her life trying to fulfill it. But as we watch her policy-changing coverage of the IDF firing tear gas at journalists, ramming CNN’s Land Rover and, eventually, murdering over a hundred civilians with an air strike, you can’t help but notice the pit in your stomach. War hasn’t changed, but the bar for accountability has. No amount of evidence seems satisfactory to stop genocide, to stop war crimes. Never Look Away is a testament to a time when justice was just an act of bravery and a rolling camera away.

    "text": "Le président vénézuélien Nicolas Maduro a annoncé ce jeudi 28 décembre que son armée lançait une action militaire de nature \"défensive\" en réaction à l'arrivée d'un navire britannique aux abords du Guyana. Quelque 5.600 soldats vénézuéliens participent à des manoeuvres militaires de nature \"défensive\" ordonnés jeudi par le président Nicolas Maduro en \"réponse à la provocation et à la menace du Royaume-Uni\", qui a envoyé un navire de guerre au Guyana en pleine crise sur l'Essequibo.\n\"J'ai ordonné l'activation d'une action conjointe de toutes les Forces Armées nationales bolivariennes (vénézuéliennes) dans les Caraïbes orientales, sur la côte atlantique, une action conjointe de nature défensive, en réponse à la provocation et à la menace du Royaume-Uni contre la paix et la souveraineté de notre pays\", a déclaré le président Maduro lors d'une émission de radio et de télévision.\nAu cours de cette émission, il a montré des images de navires de guerre et d'avions de combat patrouillant dans la zone.\nLe Guyana apaise les tensions Cette première phase d'exercices militaires réunit 5.682 militaires et des avions de chasse F-16 (américain) et Soukhoï (russes), a-t-il précisé.\nLe vice-président guyanien, Bharrat Jagdeo, a réagi peu après lors d'une conférence de presse.\n\"Nous n'avons aucun plan pour prendre des mesures offensives contre le Venezuela (...) Nous n'avons pas l'intention d'envahir le Venezuela. Le président Maduro le sait et ne doit pas s'inquiéter\", a-t-il dit, précisant que l'arrivée du patrouilleur britannique entrait dans le cadre \"d'exercices de routine planifiés depuis longtemps\".\nCe navire, le \"HMS Trent\", doit arriver au Guyana vendredi et participer à des exercices militaires dans les eaux guyaniennes pendant \"moins d'une semaine\". Il n'est pas prévu qu'il accoste à Georgetown, a souligné une source du ministère des Affaires étrangères guyanien.\nD'habitude basé en Méditerranée, le \"HMS Trent\" a été envoyé début décembre dans les Caraïbes pour lutter contre les trafics de drogue.\nTensions pétrolières La tension entre Caracas et Georgetown était montée après le lancement en septembre d'appels d'offres pétroliers par le Guyana, puis le référendum organisé en réaction le 3 décembre au Venezuela sur un rattachement de l'Essequibo, territoire de 160.000 km2 riche en pétrole et ressources naturelles, administré par Georgetown et revendiqué par le Venezuela.\nQuelque 125.000 personnes, soit un cinquième de la population du Guyana, vivent dans l'Essequibo, qui couvre les deux tiers de la superficie du pays.\nLe Venezuela soutient que le fleuve Essequibo doit être la frontière naturelle, comme en 1777 à l'époque de l'empire espagnol. Le Guyana argue que la frontière, datant de l'époque coloniale anglaise, a été entérinée en 1899 par une cour d'arbitrage à Paris.\nLes présidents guyanien Irfaan Ali et vénézuélien Nicolas Maduro se sont ensuite rencontrés le 14 décembre lors d'un sommet qui a contribué à faire baisser la tension, avec engagement à ne pas utiliser la force, mais qui n'a pas résolu le différend, les deux pays campant sur leurs positions.\nUn \"ex-empire décadent et pourri\" \"Nous croyons à la diplomatie, au dialogue, à la paix. Mais personne ne doit menacer le Venezuela, personne ne doit s'en prendre au Venezuela\", a ajouté jeudi Nicolas Maduro\n\"La menace de l'ex-empire décadent et pourri du Royaume-Uni est inacceptable. Nous ne l'acceptons pas\", a-t-il ajouté, rappelant que le Royaume-Uni était l'ancienne puissance coloniale du Guyana. De son côté, le vice-président guyanien a insisté: \"nous soutenons leur déclaration (commune du sommet entre les deux présidents), dans la lettre et dans l'esprit, selon laquelle rien de ce que nous avons fait dans le passé ou de ce que nous ferons à l'avenir ne nuira ou n'affectera le Venezuela\".\nBharrat Jagdeo a toutefois précisé que le président Irfaan Ali n'avait pas donné de consignes pour annuler la venue du bateau.\nDans un communiqué dans la matinée, le gouvernement vénézuélien avait \"rejeté catégoriquement l'arrivée du navire\", la qualifiant d'\"acte de provocation hostile\".\nSur le même sujet Le Guyana autorise des forages pétroliers dans les eaux revendiquées par le Venezuela Sa présence \"est extrêmement grave\", c'est pourquoi \"le Venezuela exhorte les autorités guyaniennes à prendre des mesures immédiates pour le retrait du HMS Trent, et à s'abstenir de continuer à impliquer des puissances militaires dans le différend territorial\", ajoute le texte.\nT.P. avec AFP Les plus lus\nFamille tuée à Meaux: le père explique avoir \"entendu des voix\" lui demandant de \"faire du mal\"",

    "text": "Durante el evento se celebraron también el 49 aniversario de la Liberación del Sur y la Reunificación Nacional (30 de abril de 1975) y el 70 aniversario de la Victoria de Dien Bien Phu (7 de mayo de 1954) de Vietnam. Esta actividad anual constituye una ocasión para que los pueblos de Vietnam y Rusia expresen su respeto y honren a los héroes que sacrificaron sus vidas por la libertad y la paz nacional. También, se aprovecha el evento para educar a la generación joven sobre el patriotismo y el orgullo nacional. En su discurso, el embajador de Rusia en Vietnam, G.S. Bezdetko, enfatizó en el significado de la Gran Guerra Patria del pueblo soviético, que ahora es la Comunidad de Estados Independientes (SNG). Afirmó que la victoria sobre el fascismo en la Gran Guerra Patria de 1945 cambió el mapa del mundo, abriendo un nuevo capítulo en la historia y marcando el colapso del sistema colonial mundial. En el contexto internacional actual, el embajador G.S. Bezdetko señaló la importancia de no olvidar las lecciones del pasado y evitar tragedias similares.También, recordó la contribución de los soldados vietnamitas, quienes lucharon con el pueblo soviético entre 1941 y 1945. Sus nombres están eternamente honrados en la lista del Museo Conmemorativo \"El Camino de la Memoria\", ubicado en las afueras de Kubinka, en Moscú. En esta ocasión, el embajador ruso además expresó su aprecio por los sacrificios y pérdidas del pueblo vietnamita en la lucha por la liberación y la unificación nacional, lo cual llevó a importantes triunfos históricos, como la Victoria de Dien Bien Phu y el Día de la Liberación del Sur y la Reunificación Nacional. Por su parte, el profesor y el mayor general Trinh Quoc Khanh, vicepresidente permanente de la Asociación de Amistad Vietnam - Rusia, se refirió a las relaciones tradicionales entre la antigua Unión Soviética y la actual Rusia con Vietnam. En la lucha contra Estados Unidos, muchos expertos soviéticos vinieron para ayudar al pueblo vietnamita contra el imperialismo y el colonialismo.Esta es una hermosa tradición entre los dos pueblos que debe ser preservada. Antes de la ceremonia conmemorativa, los delegados participaron en el desfile \"Batallón Inmortal\", una actividad realizada por los rusos en muchos países del mundo para recordar a los fallecidos en la Gran Guerra Patria.",

    "text": "Yaël Braun-Pivet confirme, dans un courrier consulté par BFMTV, l'exclusion de Ritchy Thibault en raison d'un \"risque de trouble à l'ordre public\". La présidente de l'Assemblée nationale Yaël Braun-Pivet, dans un courrier adressé à la députée LFI Ersilia Soudais et consulté par BFMTV, refuse la requête de cette dernière qui demandait à ce qu'elle reconsidère sa décision d'exclure son collaborateur Ritchy Thibault .\nElle confirme l'exclusion de ce dernier en raison d'un \"risque de trouble à l'ordre public\": \"Lorsqu’un risque de trouble à l’ordre public est avéré, un refus d’entrée peut être opposé, fut-ce à titre conservatoire. C’est le cas en l’espèce.\" Dans ce courrier adressé à l’élue, Yaël Braun-Pivet explique qu'elle a souhaité une \"interdiction proportionnée (…) circonscrite aux espaces les plus fréquentés par les députés, les membres du Gouvernement et le public, où de fait, le risque de trouble à l’ordre public est le plus élevé\".\nPlainte pour \"injure publique\" Ritchy Thibault a été interdit d'accès au Palais Bourbon par l'administration de l'Assemblée nationale.\nAncien gilet jaune, il avait déclaré début octobre lors d'une manifestation pour la Palestine: \"Le seul chemin dans les rues de Paris, c'est l'intifada.\" Le mot arabe, qui se traduit par \"soulèvement\" en français, renvoie à la révolte des Palestiniens de Cisjordanie et de Gaza contre Israël, déclenchée en décembre 1987 et en septembre 2000.\nLe coordinateur de La France insoumise, Manuel Bompard, avait par la suite pris ses distances avec ces propos, sans explicitement les condamner. Plus récemment, Bruno Retailleau a déposé plainte pour \"injure publique\" contre ce collaborateur parlementaire , qui avait qualifié les policiers d'\"enfants de Pétain\".\nAnne Saurat-Dubois avec Clément Boutin Les plus lus\nSantiago: pourquoi l’alerte enlèvement est-elle levée alors que le nourrisson n'a pas été retrouvé?",
