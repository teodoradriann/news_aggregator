    "text": "Mesa burglary victim believes suspect is tied to another East Valley break-in\nMESA, AZ (AZFamily) — The owner of JBB Barber & Beauty Salon in Mesa near Southern Avenue believes the person who burglarized his shop is the same suspect who broke into a burger joint in Tempe.\nThe break-in happened on July 5 at 2:20 a.m. The security video shows the suspect smashing the glass door, stealing the cash register and running away in 15 seconds.\n“That was mostly frustration because I wasn’t expecting that. I’ve been here in the plaza for 10 years and that was the first time this happened,” said Elmer Mendez.\nHe said the suspect stole $120 and caused nearly $600 in damage. “I think they need to find a job. That’s all they need to do instead of doing that stuff,” said Mendez.\nHe said after watching surveillance video from a July 7 burglary at Johnny’s Burgers & Dogs in Tempe, he noticed some similarities with the suspect.\nIn a side-by-side comparison of both burglary security videos, the suspect was wearing all black and broke the windows with a rock. He went straight for the registers.\nThe biggest giveaway is what he was wearing on his hands: bright, green gloves. Mendez said he showed the videos to Mesa police and said a detective told him it’s believed to be the same suspect.\nMendez’s shop is just an 11-minute drive away from the Tempe business down Southern Avenue. He thinks the suspect is casing out small businesses in the East Valley before striking.\nMendez said an employee from a business next door told him they noticed a car waiting nearby around 1 a.m. He said they have security guards at the plaza and he isn’t sure how the suspect slipped past them.\n“I don’t know if he done a couple more people in those places, or if he keep doing them right now,” said Mendez.\nMendez wants other businesses to be cautious while police work on making an arrest. “A lot of people work hard for their stuff and it doesn’t feel good when someone takes it away from you,” he said.\nArizona’s Family shared Mendez’s security video with Tempe police, who said they will be looking into it. A Mesa police spokesperson said they are working to get a status on the case from detectives.\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

    "text": "The Amir and National Head of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Jama’at of Nigeria, Alhaji Alatoye AbdulAzeez has expressed concerns that recent discussions surrounding Sharia law enforcement in the Southwest might be driven by political motivations rather than genuine religious intentions.\nThe Amir stated this at a press conference on “World Crisis and the Pathway to Peace”, where he received the managing director of Muslim Television Ahmadiyya (MTA) International, Sir Munir-ud-Din Shams, at Ahmadiyya Muslim Jama’at headquarters in Lagos.\nAlhaji AbdulAzeez described the comments as overly sentimental, clarifying that Sharia courts have long been established in the Southwest region.\nHe cited a Sharia court in Ojokoro as an example, noting recent disagreements on marital issues where individuals chose between customary and Sharia courts.\nAlhaji AbdulAzeez affirmed that Nigeria remains a secular state, with Sharia courts serving only Muslims, adding that, “The Southwest is peaceful, with various religious groups living harmoniously. Sharia courts resolve issues between Muslims who opt to use them. No non-Muslim can be forced to adhere to Sharia law.”\nHe suggested that the recent discussions might be politically motivated, reiterating that Sharia has existed in Nigeria long before anyone began mobilising for crises and wars. According to him, this is a case of political Sharia rather than religious.\nThe Amir highlighted concerns over the wrongful application of Sharia such as stoning individuals to death for expressing themselves, which is a criminal offence under Nigerian law.\nHe stressed that Sharia courts in states like Lagos, Ogun and Kwara primarily handle marital and inheritance laws, not criminal offences.\nDrawing from the recently published book by the worldwide head of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, His Holiness Hazrat Mirza Masroor Ahmad, Sir Munir-ud-Din Shams assessed the current world situation, describing it as a turbulent time marked by a continuing global economic crisis and alarming parallels to the period preceding the Second World War.",

    "title": "Salesforce hiring freeze: No company for coders. Salesforce won't hire engineers, thanks to AI gains - The Economic Times",
    "text": "San Francisco-based Salesforce, among the world's most-valued software companies, said it will not be hiring any more engineers this year amid significant productivity boosts from AI, its chief executive officer (CEO) Marc Benioff revealed last month.Benioff told the 20 VC with Harry Stebbings podcast that the cloud giant was in the midst of doing its business plan for next year, and Agentforce - the company's flagship artificial intelligence (AI) product - was the only thing that really matters today. In a long-ranging conversation with the venture capitalist, Benioff outlined the reasons why his company decided to implement the hiring freeze. When asked if Salesforce would have more or fewer employees in five years, he said he thinks the company will probably be larger . We're not adding any more software engineers next year because we have increased the productivity this year with Agentforce and with other AI technology that we're using for engineering teams by more than 30% to the point where our engineering velocity is incredible. I can't believe what we're achieving in engineering, the CEO said. And then, we will have less support engineers next year because we have an agentic layer. We will have more salespeople next year because we really need to explain to people exactly the value that we can achieve with AI. So, we will probably add another 1,000 to 2,000 salespeople in the short term, he added.Arundhati Bhattacharya, chairperson and CEO, Salesforce India, also told ET last month that AI will enable the workforce to expand their capabilities. If you look at people, consumers, all our demands are not met. You go into a state hospital, the doctors are overworked. Workforce is limited by the number of hours that they have at their disposal. What AI actually can do is to unlimit this limitation. Your employment opportunities will go up, maybe the roles will be different. Transition would be a little painful, but it will happen. Salesforce doubled its India headcount in the country in the last few years, Bhattacharya told ET in September.",

    "text": "[Join the fight and contribute to our war chest.](https://donate.revolver.news/) [Ditch the ads for $5 per month or $49 per year.](https://revolver.news/subscribe/) Recently, Steve Bannon had Revolver’s own Darren Beattie on the War Room show, and together they exposed Nikki Haley’s latest 2024 plot. That’s right, you thought she had slithered away, didn’t you? Nope. It turns out she’s just been lying in wait, ready to pounce. Well, if you thought you had heard the last of Nikki Haley after she slithered out of the campaign, tired of being humiliated by the American people over and over, you were sadly mistaken. She’s back, or better yet, according to Revolver’s Darren Beattie, she never actually left. She’s just regrouping for her next big 2024 move. That’s what Darren and WarRoom’s Steve Bannon discussed in depth when they uncovered what Nikki is up to with her next sneaky 2024 move and all the people lining up to fund her and her latest schemes. Well, Steve is back, and this time he’s teaming up with Senator Tommy Tuberville, and together these two have pieced together the Dems three-part strategy to take 2024. It involves the following options: - Lawfare against President Trump and all his allies to take them off the chessboard. - Outright steal the election like 2020 with fraudulent mail-in balloting, ballot harvesting, and drop boxes. - Wag the dog by starting World War III with Russia. Watch: Bannon and Tuberville reveal Dems 3-part plan to take 2024 and how Biden's failed foreign policy will play a role, too. [pic.twitter.com/4Fmpub2Dx8] — Amy Moreno (@VivaLaAmes11) [June 5, 2024] For those that don’t know, here’s what “wag the dog” means. Wag the dog is, as a political term, the act of creating a diversion from a damaging issue usually through military force. It stems from the generic use of the term to mean a small and seemingly unimportant entity (the tail) controls a bigger, more important one (the dog). It is usually used by a politician when they are in a scandal, in hopes that people forget about the scandal and focus on the more important issue. The phrase originates in the saying “a dog is smarter than its tail, but if the tail were smarter, then it would wag the dog.”[1] The concept has strong intersections with many other aspects of Diversionary foreign policy, particularly the rally ’round the flag effect, as wag the dog actions tend to both distract and seek to bolster support through these actions. The logic is that if Joe Biden starts World War III with Russia, then the American electorate will decide that they don’t want to make a change in the middle of a war. Senator Tuberville, as he explains above, thinks that is exactly what might happen. There’s a lot more to the amazing interview, however. We love how Senator Tuberville shared the story of his father, who, at just 16, lied about his age to join the Army and stormed the beaches at Normandy. He also shared his thoughts on the military recruiting crisis and his concerns about the military’s apparent disinterest in Southerners. You can watch the entire captivating interview here: Excellent interview of Senator Tommy Tuberville 🇺🇸 [pic.twitter.com/1ginpxWPC5] — Karli Bonne’ 🇺🇸 (@KarluskaP) [June 5, 2024] We all know by now that the Democrats aren’t just going to roll over and let President Trump claim what’s rightfully his. They’ll throw every possible roadblock in his way—from so-called “pandemics” to sham trials and another epic cheating scam that will make the last one seem like a Sunday stroll in the park. Surprise attacks are the Democrats’ best weapon, so we can’t rule anything out. Everything is on the table when your enemy is at their most desperate. Stay alert, expect the unexpected, and keep fighting.

    "title": "Ozempic and Seasonal Health Goals: Adjusting Your Plan for Summer and Winter",
    "text": "As more people turn to Ozempic as a part of their weight loss journey, understanding how to adapt lifestyle and health goals to fit the changing seasons can maximize results. Weight loss and wellness needs can shift from summer to winter, so tailoring your approach with Ozempic for each season can keep you on track year-round.\nThe Influence of Seasons on Health and Weight Loss Our bodies react differently to each season. In the summer, we tend to have more energy, spend more time outdoors, and gravitate toward lighter foods. In contrast, winter often brings cravings for comfort foods, reduced physical activity, and a tendency to spend more time indoors. Adapting to these shifts can help you continue making progress with Ozempic without feeling restricted or off-balance.\nSummer with Ozempic: Tips for Staying Active and Energized Summer is the season of outdoor activities, fresh produce, and sunshine. Here’s how to make the most of it:\nBoost Physical Activity\nTake advantage of the warmer weather to increase your activity level. Whether it’s hiking, swimming, or even walking, being active outdoors not only helps with weight management but can also improve mental well-being. Pairing regular exercise with Ozempic can enhance its effects, supporting your energy levels and overall motivation. Embrace Seasonal Foods\nFresh fruits and vegetables are abundant in summer, making it easier to stick to nutrient-rich, low-calorie foods. Foods like leafy greens, berries, cucumbers, and zucchini are hydrating and packed with nutrients, complementing Ozempic’s appetite-suppressing benefits without adding excessive calories. Stay Hydrated\nSummer heat increases the need for hydration. Ozempic users should aim to drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration, which can also help manage any potential side effects. Staying well-hydrated supports metabolism and can help you feel full, making it easier to stick to portion control. Manage Appetite Fluctuations\nOzempic is known to curb appetite, which can be especially helpful in the summer when lighter meals are often preferred. By focusing on refreshing, whole foods, you can keep energy up without feeling overly full or sluggish. Winter Adjustments with Ozempic: Maintaining Momentum The winter months bring unique challenges, from holiday gatherings to shorter daylight hours. Here’s how to adjust your approach to stay aligned with your health goals:\nStay Active Indoors\nWhile outdoor activities may be limited in winter, finding ways to stay active is essential. Consider indoor workouts, like yoga, strength training, or using an at-home treadmill. Keeping active will help maintain your weight loss momentum and counter the effects of reduced daylight on energy levels. Plan for Holiday Eating\nHolidays often bring indulgent meals and tempting treats, which can make sticking to a health plan challenging. Ozempic users can benefit from mindful eating strategies, like smaller portions and focusing on protein and vegetables. Preparing in advance for holiday gatherings can prevent overeating and keep your progress on track. Combat Winter Cravings\nColder months may prompt cravings for comfort foods, often higher in calories and carbs. Ozempic can help manage these cravings, but it’s still essential to plan satisfying meals that won’t hinder progress. Try incorporating healthy, warming dishes, like soups filled with lean proteins and vegetables, to stay full without overindulging. Focus on Long-Term Goals\nWinter can be a season for setting goals and reflecting on progress. Consider using this time to create a health plan that aligns with your longer-term objectives, especially if you’re considering Ozempic as a sustainable part of your journey. For those curious about starting on Ozempic, you can learn more about how to get prescribed Ozempic for weight loss and take that first step with confidence. Embracing Ozempic for Year-Round Success Seasonal changes can influence every part of a weight loss plan, including dietary habits, activity levels, and even mood. By making seasonal adjustments with Ozempic, you can stay committed to your goals and enjoy a balanced approach that works all year long.",

    "title": "Meet The Women Using Drones To Help Prevent Forest Fires In Bolivia",
    "text": "A team led by two women from Bolivia have used their drone skills to help map fires and work with local authorities there.\nIn 2023, more than 42,100 wildfires were recorded in Bolivia , the highest level in the last five years, in part contributing to the almost 700,000 hectares of natural forest lost in that year.\nErika Lopez Coca , founder and CEO of the GAIA Center, and former co-founder and strategic planning coordinator at Bolivia Flying Labs explains that the Firehawk Project, based in remote and rural communities in Bolivia, was created to utilize drones for mapping and monitoring forest areas, providing vital information to identify high-risk zones susceptible to fires.\nThe project conducted drone flights in El Portón and the Peniel communities in Bolivia, covering over 100 hectares each and after image processing, the team shared the results with Roboré Municipal Government Forest Fire Task Force, only to have a planned on-site discussion disrupted by a dire fire season.\n\"Firehawk was a pilot project that showcased the potential of accessible information to empower local communities in combating forest fires,\" Lopez says, adding that the project was a crucial step towards preserving the precious ecosystem in the La Chiquitania region and protecting the communities that rely on it.\nLopez explains that she and Laura Arianne Parada Hoyos , a gender and environment specialist at the GAIA Center and Bolivia Flying Labs, are taking this vision further, transforming the GAIA Center into community-led and community-owned hubs that address local needs.\nMORE FOR YOU Is Leadership an Art or a Science Apple Confirms Major iPhone Changes With New App Features Enabled O J Simpson Dies Of Cancer At 76 \"Technology and accessible information are essential to democratize responses to environmental challenges,\" Lopez says.\nParada says that GAIA arose from the experiences and challenges faced in the Firehawk project.\n\"The main objective is to foster a culture of environmentally responsible stewardship and to serve as a meeting point between communities, financial institutions and new technologies, especially in marginalized communities, to ensure technological accessibility for all,\" she says, adding that the project faces significant challenges, such as establishing effective communication between stakeholders and overcoming technological barriers in marginalized communities.\n\"However, these difficulties also provide opportunities to innovate inclusive and sustainable approaches that can set a valuable precedent for similar initiatives,\" Parada says.\nBolivia's Women in STEM Parada grew up in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia, with experiences in the Chiquitania region and the department of El Beni as a volunteer in environmental projects.\n\"I collaborated with Bolivia's first park ranger, Carola Vaca, participating in conservation and environmental education campaigns,\" she says, \"I participated in a stage of the caravan for a Bolivia without Forest Fires, interacting with women leaders in the region and these experiences have guided my commitment to environmental conservation.\"\nLopez says the urgency of addressing climate-related challenges requires a shift in how we approach solutions.\n\"It is not about where the solution comes from but the holistic and inclusive approach we take to safeguard our planet,\" she says, \"We need global collaboration, and my unique perspective and abilities aim to bridge gaps, fostering a collective effort to protect our shared home.\"\nParada explains that the relevance of science from the Global South lies in the capacity of local communities to address their own challenges.\n\"It is essential to empower these communities to actively participate in their development, meeting their needs from local knowledge and training,\" she says.\nStudying Forest Fires And Pangolins in Nepal On the other side of the world, Tulshi Laxmi Suwal , the founder of Small Mammals Conservation and Research Foundation (SMCRF) in Kathmandu, Nepal, is studying the impact of forest fires on scaly mammals called pangolins—and inspiring a whole new generation of researchers to appreciate them.\nNepal is home to two of the eight species of pangolin — the Chinese pangolin and the Indian pangolin and they are known as “friends of farmers” for the vital ecosystem services they provide, with a single pangolin eating 70 million ants and termites a year.\nShe says that a study in 2016 found that that pangolin habitat in Nepal is increasingly being threatened by forest fire, with over 3,000 forest fire incidents occur every year. Her project will create ten sustainable Community Pangolin Conservation Groups to monitor pangolin populations and their habitats and equip them to manage fires and plant 20,000 local mixed broad-leaved trees.\n\"This project will help other species, address gender inequality, climate change and so much more,\" she says, \"Nature-based solutions will help to provide alternative livelihoods for local communities in the form of leaf-plate-making for example.\"\nAndrew Wight",

    "title": "Baby Jelanee's heart: A Wyoming family's push for organ donation in Aurora",
    "text": "AURORA, Colo. — A Wyoming family now calls Colorado home as they wait for an organ donor to help their 8-month-old child, who was born with an uncommon heart condition. “It's just not the Christmas, you know, or the firsts we thought we were gonna have,” mom Sarah Bahige said as she held her baby inside Children's Hospital in Aurora. Bahige and her family are from Wyoming. Yet, Colorado is now home for her and her son Jelanee, after he was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy and life-flighted to Children’s in September. “His heart was really enlarged. It was like two thirds of the size of his chest,” she explained. Tubes and hospital equipment have been keeping Jelanee’s blood pumping for the last two months, as he waits for a new heart, via donation. “There’s not really an update, which is hard, because it's just waiting indefinitely it seems like,” Bahige said. That waiting, and the world of organ donation, is entirely new to this family. “It doesn't start at the bottom and you move up the list,” Bahige explained. “Jelanee is what’s called a ‘Status 1A,’ which is the top of the list. And just here in this hospital, there's like six other kids that are 1A.” So the Bahige family started a social media campaign to raise awareness. They took to Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok, sharing Jelanee’s story and pushing the importance of organ donation. “Through organ donation, he can have a future, you know. He can grow up, he can go do all the things that every other kid is going to do,” Bahige said. Jelanee needs a specific age and size of a heart, which is a difficult idea to cope with for this family, as another child would need to pass away to be able to donate a heart to their son. But for the Bahiges, they recognize that if someone of any age were to pass away regardless, that a choice to be an organ donor could make a world of difference for someone else. “Everyone should be a donor, just to give all other kids on the list chance that a real life, you know, a full life outside of a hospital,” she said. The family has started a GoFundMe to help with hospital expenses as mom Sarah stays in Colorado, while the rest of the family travels back and forth. To donate, click here .
