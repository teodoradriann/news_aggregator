Readers will be transported into the life of veteran Border Patrol Agent Kelly Smith, a character navigating not only the complexities of border security but also the profound emotions of love, loss, and sacrifice.\nThe narrative unfolds against the backdrop of a glorious and militarized plan to breach the U.S./Mexican border—a threat unlike any seen before. As Kelly Smith confronts this challenge alongside his partner and best friend, Ruben Garcia, and the new love of his life, Cristina Chavez, the trio becomes embroiled in a web of power, corruption, and a ruthless foe. Herrick’s storytelling beautifully weaves action, suspense, romance, and humour, offering readers a unique perspective from a real-life Border Agent who has witnessed the harsh realities of the frontlines.\nHerrick, known for his deep insights into border and security operations, brilliantly captures the potential flashpoints of a disturbing reality should the situation at the U.S./Mexico border remain unchecked. The novel not only entertains but also serves as a thought-provoking exploration of the challenges faced by those who dedicate their lives to protecting our borders.\n“ War on the Rio Grande: Laredo Under Fire ” goes beyond the action-packed narrative, addressing themes of love and loss on the frontlines, shedding light on the personal toll borne by individuals committed to border security. The novel is a testament to Herrick’s creative imagination, offering an insider’s peek into events that feel all too real.\nReaders are invited to immerse themselves in this compelling narrative, experiencing the highs and lows of a life dedicated to securing our borders. “ War on the Rio Grande: Laredo Under Fire ” is now available for purchase at major retailers and online platforms.\nAbout the Author\nJim Herrick is a retired 25-year veteran of the U.S. Border Patrol. He recently completed a tour in Afghanistan as a contractor for the Department of State/CBP as a mentor to Afghan Border and Customs Police advising on border security operations. He has a “Secret” security clearance and has been actively involved in a broad spectrum of border and security operations including anti-terrorism, tracking and surveillance, weapons and canine handling, and the investigation and apprehension of aliens and contraband that enter the U.S. illegally. Jim’s acquired knowledge and experience give him keen insights into the possible scenarios that can occur when you put powerful, callous, and violent drug cartels together with corrupt foreign military powers and governments, a permissive, and ineffectual Mexican buffer, and a weak U.S. border. His creative imagination gives us an insider’s peek into major events that are just waiting to happen, often based on real people and events that have “almost” happened. Still active as a border and security consultant, Jim now lives in New Mexico with his family.\nBook Name: War On The Rio Grande\nAuthor Name: James Herrick\nISBN Number: 0996395210\nEbook Version: Click Here\nPaperback Version: Click Here\nMedia Contact\nCompany Name: Amazon Publishing Company\nEmail: Send Email\nPhone: +1-877-311-2129\nCountry: United States\nWebsite: https://amzpublishingcompany.com/\nData & News supplied by www.cloudquote.io\nStock quotes supplied by Barchart\nQuotes delayed at least 20 minutes.\nBy accessing this page, you agree to the following\nPrivacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .",

    "text": "When companies merge or acquire others, combining different software systems is a key element that shapes success. Shiva Gangaraju, a senior enterprise systems engineer at Ping Identity, manages projects that solve complex technology alignment challenges.\nThe U.S. software integration market will reach $9.08 billion by 2030, growing 18.5% each year, showing strong demand for experts like Shiva Gangaraju. He and other specialists in the field help companies navigate complicated technology changes after acquisitions, influencing how modern businesses operate in the digital space.\nBridging Technical Divides\nCombining separate software systems after an acquisition requires technical expertise and careful planning. Shiva Gangaraju developed a “universal translator” method that preserves data integrity and context when moving information between platforms. This technique successfully merged over 10 million customer records from three separate systems, boosting cross-selling opportunities by 30% and reducing data redundancy by 25%.\nThe success of this method shows the importance of maintaining data context during migrations. A company can uncover new business opportunities and improve operational efficiency by preserving information accuracy across different platforms. This process involves detailed mapping of data structures and thorough cleansing to find and fix discrepancies before integration.\nMarket analysts predict substantial global software integration market growth by 2030, highlighting how crucial unified systems are for success after acquisitions. These projections reflect the rising importance of integrated software platforms for business operations, especially as a company aligns its digital infrastructure after mergers.\nLeveraging AI for Seamless Integration\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is a landmark advancement in combining software systems after acquisitions. In 2024, 65% of companies use platforms with AI capabilities, indicating AI’s shift from an optional feature to an essential system component. At Ping Identity, Shiva Gangaraju uses natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to analyze data across various platforms, creating a more unified approach to system integration.\nAI application extends beyond basic data analysis. NLP algorithms can interpret and categorize unstructured data from various sources, making it possible to build comprehensive customer profiles that capture both explicit information and underlying relationships. This capability proves particularly valuable when merging customer databases from different companies, where data formats and categories often conflict.\nCompanies adopting these AI-enhanced integration strategies report notable improvements: overall system efficiency increased by 20%, while cross-platform functionality improved by 15%. Comprehensive data models that capture both explicit information and implicit relationships help connect previously isolated systems, regardless of the original architecture.\nPrioritizing the Human Element\nDespite technological advances, successful software system integration depends heavily on employee adoption and engagement. Shiva Gangaraju discusses that encouraging staff to embrace new, unified systems remains one of the biggest challenges in post-acquisition digital transformation. His projects at Ping Identity have achieved adoption rates 25% above industry standards, thanks to an implementation strategy focusing on hands-on training and clear communication about the integrated system’s benefits.\nThis people-focused approach recognizes that technology transitions depend as much on people as on systems. Employees need to understand how to use new tools and why these changes benefit their work and the company. Shiva Gangaraju’s strategy includes creating comprehensive training programs that address the technical aspects of new systems and their strategic importance to the organization.\nThis approach also often includes creating user groups or champions within different departments who can provide peer support and feedback during the transition. By involving employees in the process and addressing concerns proactively, a company can significantly reduce resistance to change and speed up the adoption of new systems.\nEnhancing Security in Unified Systems\nUnifying software systems following acquisitions raises important questions about data privacy and system independence. In response, Ping Identity incorporates strict privacy guidelines and transparency measures into its unification strategy rather than addressing these issues later.\nBlockchain technology is an essential development in this area, with market projections showing revenue reaching $5,798 million by 2027. This secure digital ledger system promises to enhance data integrity across unified systems, creating verifiable records of system interactions spanning entire organizations. Implementing blockchain in software system integration offers several advantages, including improved traceability of data changes, enhanced security against unauthorized modifications, and increased trust among different parties involved in the merger.\nShiva Gangaraju and his team at Ping Identity focus on balancing technological advancement with maintaining system integrity during the integration process. This involves implementing new security measures, conducting thorough risk assessments, and creating comprehensive data governance policies that span the newly integrated system.",

    "title": "Rep. Armstrong Joins Colleagues To Protect Clean Water and Drinking Water Projects | Representative Kelly Armstrong",
    "text": "WASHINGTON— This week, U.S. Representative Kelly Armstrong (ND-AL) joined Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Senator Michael Bennet (D-CO), and Representative Brittany Pettersen (CO-07) and penned a bipartisan, bicameral letter to the leaders of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees over concerns with the federal financing of our nation's water infrastructure.\nThe Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) and the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) have been the principal financing programs for drinking water, wastewater, and stormwater projects for nearly three decades. Since the 2021, more than $3.7 billion dollars has been redirected from CWSRF and DWSRF to fund the Community Project Funding/Congressionally Directed Spending (CPF/CDS) process. While CPF/CDS projects are critical investments to support local water infrastructure needs, redirecting money away from the State Revolving Funds means that states will experience significant shortfalls in funding important water infrastructure projects.\nIn the letter, the Members urge Appropriators to provide a more sustainable funding source for critical water projects, particularly one that does not siphon off funds from essential projects that rely on SRF financing.\n“The Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds have been critical to expand access to clean water, modernize aging water infrastructure, and safeguard our public health,” wrote the Members. “If funding shortfalls and diversions continue, a major lifeline of our federal water infrastructure funding will run dry at a time when costs for infrastructure, design, and planning are skyrocketing.”\nPettersen led this charge after hearing from water experts across Colorado and the 7th Congressional District – including members of her Water Advisory Council – about the devastating impact these funding shortfalls could have on Colorado water infrastructure.\n“Robust funding through the annual appropriations bills are essential for SRF borrowers to maintain their access to financing for critical infrastructure and ensure clean water for years to come.” said Keith McLaughlin, Executive Director of the Colorado Water Resources and Power Development Authority.\n“The Colorado Water Congress has long supported legislation and appropriations processes to fund our nation’s clean water and drinking water infrastructure,” said Chane Polo, Deputy Director of the Colorado Water Congress. “It is our policy to support efforts that maximize the ability of water funding entities, including the Colorado Water Resources and Power Development Authority, to finance water projects. SRFs provide more communities with access to affordable financing for water infrastructure that protects public health needs.”\n“The changes to the amounts of revolving fund financing available to states have had a direct impact on Cañon City,” said Leo Evans, Canon City Water Public Works Director . “When we first started working with the state, we were in line for $5M in principal forgiveness through the program paired with a $5M low-interest loan. We went to work and based the next three years of capital planning and budgeting on those figures. When we reached the next stage of the application process, we were informed that the principal forgiveness amounts available to us had been reduced to a maximum of $1M. That change has thrown a lot of our capital planning up in the air and left the city with uncertainty on how best to proceed with our planned improvements. Restoring the program funding back to the original levels envisioned in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law would help Cañon City ensure that we can bring the benefits of this program to our community.”\nThe letter has been endorsed by the Colorado Water Congress, Colorado Rural Water, Colorado Water Utility Council (CWUC), Metro Water Recovery, National Governors Association (NGA), American Water Works Association (AWWA), Council of Infrastructure Financing Authorities (CIFA), National Association of Counties (NACo), National Special Districts Coalition (NSDC), Association of State Drinking Water Administrators (ASDWA), Association of Clean Water Administrators (ACWA), Clean Water Action, Water Environment Federation, Texas Water Conservation Association, Water & Wastewater Equipment Manufacturers Association, Western States Water Council, American Rivers, National Water Resources Association, Alliance for Water Efficiency, River Network, National Municipal Stormwater Alliance, National Association of Clean Water Agencies (NACWA), Association of Clean Water Administrators, Green Infrastructure Leadership Exchange, American Public Works Association, Texas Water Infrastructure Network, Water Environment Association of Texas (WEAT), Texas American Water Works Association, Texas Water Foundation, Association of Water Board Directors-Texas, Freshwater Future, Environmental Policy Innovation Center (EPIC), Clean Water Construction Coalition, Western Recycled Water Coalition, Natural Resources Defense Council, Distribution Contractors Association, Pennsylvania Utility Contractors Association, Minnesota Utility Contractors Association.\nThe full text of the letter can be found HERE and below\nDear Chair Murray, Vice Chair Collins, Chair Cole, Ranking Member DeLauro, Chair Merkley, Ranking Member Murkowski, Chair Simpson, and Ranking Member Pingree:\nWe write concerning current state allocations for the Clean Water and the Drinking Water State Revolving Funds (SRF), which were reduced as a result of redirecting funds to the Community Project Funding and Congressionally Directed Spending (CPF/CDS) process. The CPF/CDS process is part of federal aging water infrastructure financing programs; however, if broader SRF resources continue to be diverted to CPF/CDS, states will experience significant shortfalls in funding water infrastructure projects.\nAs you develop the Fiscal Year 2025 (FY25) Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill, we urge the Committee to take two steps. First, increase funding for SRFs to account for CPF/CDS. Second, provide a more sustainable funding source for critical water projects through the CPF/CDS process, particularly one that does not siphon funds from essential projects reliant on SRF financing.\nThe SRFs have been the principal water financing programs for more than three decades, supporting water infrastructure projects – such as drinking water, wastewater, and stormwater projects – through low-cost loans and limited grants to underserved communities to cities and towns across our nation. These funds have been critical to expand access to clean water, modernize aging water infrastructure, and safeguard our public health. After Congress resumed the CPF/CDS process in the 117th Congress, annual Appropriations Acts reduced funding for state SRFs by more than $3.7 billion in FY22, FY23, and FY24 to fund CPF/CDS.\nIn FY22 and FY23, 56% of funds for both SRFs in aggregate were diverted to CPF/CDS (not including supplemental appropriations in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL)); meaning that during this time, only 44% of SRF funds supported low-cost loans and limited grants for water infrastructure projects. In FY24, Congress provided a total of $2,764,962,000 for the SRFs. Of this amount, 51.3% or $1,419,312,172 was dedicated to CPF/CDS. If funding shortfalls and diversions continue, a major lifeline of our federal water infrastructure funding will run dry at a time when costs for infrastructure, design, and planning are skyrocketing.\nCongress made a concerted effort to invest in our aging water infrastructure through the BIL. The law seeded $43 billion for the Clean Water State Revolving Fund and the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund, funding a critical boost for dire repairs. However significant, this historic one-time infusion will eventually run out. SRFs pay dividends for our water infrastructure and are necessary to further BIL investments. For these reasons, we urge the Committee to invest in sustainable funding sources for SRFs.\nWe are grateful for the Committee's commitment to fund our nation's clean water and drinking water infrastructure through the annual Appropriations process, but we are increasingly concerned about SRFs’ solvency in years to come. Through the FY25 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill, we urge the Committee to ensure the longevity of SRFs by fully funding the programs and to provide a more sustainable funding source for CPF/CDS.\nThank you for your consideration of this request.\nSincerely,",
