The wave is expected to move near or over Cuba throughout the day and then emerge over the Straits of Florida tonight or Saturday. Environmental conditions are expected to be conducive for additional development after that time, and a tropical depression is likely to form this weekend over the Straits of Florida or eastern Gulf of Mexico near the Florida Peninsula. Tropical storm watches or warnings could be required for portions of Florida later today. Regardless of development, heavy rains could cause areas of flash flooding across Florida, Cuba, and the Bahamas through the weekend. Residents in these locations should continue to monitor the progress of this system. A NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft is scheduled to investigate this system later today. - Formation chance through 48 hours: medium, 60 percent. - Formation chance through 7 days: high, 90 percent.

See latest predictions \"The latest models show it going into the eastern Gulf and then exploding there,\" said AccuWeather Lead Long-Range Expert Paul Pastelok. \"There is low steering flow in the eastern Gulf so once it gets there, it's kind of stuck and over warm water, it can intensify.

If the center migrates farther to the northwest, then surf conditions will build along the Gulf Coast.\" Florida Gov. DeSantis issues state of emergency for 54 counties Gov. Ron DeSantis issued a [ state of emergency](https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/hurricane/2024/08/01/desantis-declares-florida-state-of-emergency-for-gulf-storm-97l-track-debby/74639334007/) Thursday in preparation for the potential landfall of a storm that could become the first \"significant threat\" to the state. In a [post on X Thursday afternoon](https://x.com/GovRonDeSantis/status/1819083175509086278?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet), DeSantis said \"Florida is monitoring Invest 97L in the Atlantic, which is expected to strengthen and potentially make landfall as early as this weekend. It will be slow-moving and bring lots of rain that could cause significant flooding. I encourage all residents to prepare for the storm and follow all guidance issued by [@FLSERT](https://x.com/FLSERT) and local emergency management officials.\" What does the colored area on the NOAA map mean? The striped areas on a tropical outlook map indicate \"areas where a tropical cyclone — which could be a tropical depression, tropical storm or hurricane — could develop,\" said National Hurricane Center Deputy Director Jamie Rhome. The colors make it visibly clear how likely a system could develop, with yellow being low, orange medium and red high. The National Hurricane Center generally doesn't issue tropical advisories until a there is a named storm, but there is an exception. \"If a system is near land and there is potential for development, the National Hurricane Center won't wait before it issues advisories, even if the system hasn't become an actual storm. This gives residents time to prepare,\" Rhome said. National Weather Service forecasts for Florida, what to expect and when South Florida: Rain chances will increase heading into the upcoming weekend as a tropical wave approaches the region, according to the National Weather Service Miami. The s [trongest storms could produce gusty winds, and heavy downpours.](https://forecast.weather.gov/showsigwx.php?warnzone=FLZ069&warncounty=FLC021&firewxzone=FLZ069&local_place1=Naples%20FL&product1=Hazardous+Weather+Outlook&lat=26.1475&lon=-81.7955) Multiple rounds of heavy downpours could create the potential for localized flooding on Saturday and Sunday. Minor to moderate coastal flooding will be possible on Sunday during the high tide cycle along the Gulf Coast and the southern portion of the peninsula along Florida Bay. West Coast: Regardless of development, the tropical wave will bring plenty of deep tropical moisture across the area and allow for a slight risk of [excessive rainfall ](https://forecast.weather.gov/product.php?site=TBW&issuedby=TBW&product=AFD&format=CI&version=1&glossary=1)across portions of the area over the weekend and into Monday, with the highest totals expected near the coast, according to the National Weather Service Tampa Bay. Models Friday are showing a more progressive movement with the system as compared to Thursday, but still varying quite a bit in strength and organization. East Coast: The tropical wave remains shrouded in mystery in terms of [placement, track and strength, ](https://forecast.weather.gov/product.php?site=MLB&issuedby=MLB&product=AFD&format=CI&version=1&glossary=1)according to the National Weather Service Melbourne. Latest model guidance does focus greatest potential for development over the eastern Gulf and likely becoming a tropical depression sometime this weekend or early next week. Confidence in details, especially track and forecast intensity remain low at this time. Expect deteriorating boating conditions likely into the weekend with forecast now showing speeds up to 15-20 knots Saturday night into Sunday. Seas generally 2-3 feet through Friday night, with the potential to build 3-4 [feet](https://forecast.weather.gov/glossary.php?word=ft) near shore and 4-5 feet offshore this weekend. Mariners should remain aware of the potential for additional deterioration of boating conditions in the forecast for later this weekend, with the potential of tropical cyclone development over the eastern Gulf. Northeast: Sunday's weather is highly dependent on what Invest 97L does, according to the National Weather Service Jacksonville. Models are showing the low in the eastern Gulf of Mexico Sunday morning but have quite a bit of disagreement in its strength. What is known is that ample moisture in the area coupled with this feature will provide [increased chances for heavy rainfall ](https://forecast.weather.gov/product.php?site=JAX&issuedby=JAX&product=AFD&format=CI&version=1&glossary=1)over the region as it makes its way through. Rainfall amounts and temperature are highly dependent on how this feature forms Sunday. Tallahassee: The main focus of the forecast continues to zero in on a tropical cyclone that is likely to be moving northward through the far eastern Gulf on Sunday, according to the National Weather Service Tallahassee. \"Keep in mind the tropical cyclone will be strengthening as it moves north, so the farther north it gets before landfall, the better of a shot that it has to attain hurricane status. \"Landfall could occur sometime between late Sunday and early Monday just about anywhere from Apalachicola to the Tampa Bay area,\" NWS forecasters said. Pensacola, Panhandle: It is too soon to say if this system will have any impacts for the local area. Impacts are NOT expected locally this weekend, according to the National Weather Service Mobile. NWS said there are two scenarios for Invest 97L, with forecasters leaning toward this scenario: \"This system develops in the eastern Gulf of Mexico this weekend and lifts over the Florida peninsula or Big Bend region late in the weekend or early next week. This would potentially [ increase our rip current risk ](https://forecast.weather.gov/product.php?site=MOB&issuedby=MOB&product=AFD&format=CI&version=1&glossary=1)(if enough swell is generated), but [impacts would be minimal here locally.\"](https://forecast.weather.gov/product.php?site=MOB&issuedby=MOB&product=AFD&format=CI&version=1&glossary=1) The second scenario: \"The system is slower to develop which allows it to move farther west into the Gulf of Mexico.

    "text": "MILANO - Nel 2025, il panorama delle minacce informatiche si evolverà rapidamente con l'ascesa di tecnologie come l'intelligenza artificiale e l'informatica quantistica.\n Secondo Check Point Software, organizzazione che si occupa di cybersecurity, gli hacker sfrutteranno le recenti tecnologie di IA per ampliare il raggio d'azione dei loro attacchi. Le previsioni degli esperti parlano di malware adattivi e campagne di phishing altamente personalizzate, capaci di ingannare anche i navigatori più attenti. I ransomware, che bloccano i sistemi richiedendo riscatti per il ripristino, diventeranno più sofisticati e automatizzati, prendendo di mira le catene di approvvigionamento globali.\nL'uso improprio di strumenti di intelligenza artificiale, come ChatGpt potrebbe inoltre portare all'esposizione accidentale di dati sensibili, mentre l'informatica quantistica minaccerà i metodi di crittografia attuali, considerati i migliori per proteggere informazioni e sistemi. Non mancheranno, per Check Point Software, le problematiche ai social media, dove i contenuti fasulli generati dall'IA, i deepfake, saranno sfruttati per attacchi mirati e truffe. I criminali aumenteranno la diffusione di foto, video e file audio artefatti per alzare il livello delle loro attività.\n Per contrastare queste minacce, i centri operativi di difesa adotteranno dei supporti, anch'essi dotati di IA e chiamati \"copilot\", così da migliorare l'efficienza del rilevamento e delle risposte agli attacchi. Alcuni ruoli tecnici evolveranno, come i responsabili dell'informazione e della sicurezza (Cio e Ciso), per lavorare di concerto e gestire in maniera integrata i rischi.",

    "text": "MAGA conservatives constantly try to rewrite history, and Newsmax guest Jessie Jane Duff went there, too. As much as MAGA would like to change the fact that former President Donald Trump was impeached twice, they cannot do that. They tried in retaliation to impeach President Joe Biden, but that failed. The thing is, a President needs to do something wrong in order to impeach him. It can't be because he curb-stomped your candidate in 2020 and hurt your feewings. They cannot change the fact that Donald was convicted of 34 counts. Trump is now a felon. But not if you're Ms. Duff. \"Well, obviously, Judge Merchan, an authoritarian type of judge, has obviously opposed Donald Trump every step of the way,\" co-host Mercedes Schlapp falsely said, according to [Media Matters](https://www.mediamatters.org/newsmax/newsmax-guest-falsely-claims-donald-trump-has-not-been-convicted). \"I mean, you were nodding your head when Daniel was speaking, Jesse Jane —\" \"I did,\" Duff explained. \"Just nodding in disagreement, to clarify here...\" \"Is that a new type of nodding?\" co-host Daniel Lippman asked. Yes, yes, it's a new type of nodding,\" Duff said. \"I wasn't agreeing; I was disagreeing because Judge Merchan is not going to be intimidated. He's already run the trial. It's over.\" \"He obviously disregarded every indication that he shouldn't have been on the trial,\" she continued. \"Everyone knows that he had made contributions to the Biden campaign, which no judge is supposed to do.\" Note: For the record, Judge Merchan donated a whopping $15 to the Biden campaign. \"We all know about what was going on with his family and profiting off of this,\" she continued as if she couldn't stop herself. \"So I dare to say that Donald Trump is probably going to disregard this gag order.\" \"It should — if they should not lift it, he'll pay the fine,\" she added. \"You know? And if they — you know, they are also — let's clarify. He has not been convicted. He will have a — potentially a stay to get through the appeals until the conviction is handed down. So right now, he is not convicted.\" He was convicted, you weirdo. These people are a font of disinformation slathered in some sort of hallucinogenic.",

They learned the woman had fallen elsewhere days prior, and she was in a great deal of pain Thursday morning, according to Schmitke.\nThe Vancouver Fire Department and Clark County’s Technical Rescue Team, a regional team that comprises Fire District 6, Vancouver Fire and Clark-Cowlitz Fire Rescue, also responded.\nRescue crews secured the woman to a backboard, Schmitke said, and used a rope system to haul her up the embankment.\nSchmitke said the rescue operation took about an hour; he called it a team effort.",

Here are a few possible reasons why you may not be seeing it on your account at this time:\nEligibility Reviews: PayPal periodically assesses account eligibility for 'Pay in 4' based on factors like your credit standing, account activity, and transaction history. This may affect availability even if you previously had access.\nAccount Verification: Please ensure your PayPal account is fully verified (e.g., with a linked and confirmed bank account or card). This can sometimes affect feature access.\nMerchant and Purchase Type: Not all merchants or purchase types support 'Pay in 4,' so the option may not appear if the transaction does not meet these criteria.\nLocation Restrictions: Availability of 'Pay in 4' varies by region, so ensure your account location aligns with eligible regions for this feature.\nIf none of these reasons seem to apply, it might be helpful to contact PayPal Support directly for more information on your account-specific eligibility. They can give more detailed guidance on reactivation steps if applicable.\nBest regards,\nSamuel\n[Login to Me Too](/plugins/common/feature/oauth2sso/sso_login_redirect?dest_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paypal-community.com%2F)\nHaven't Found your Answer?\nIt happens.
