    "text": "I’m delighted to report that we’ve just crossed 5,000 subscribers. It’s not a huge number by today’s standards, but it’s spectacular for a project that embraced a losing formula. I deliberately stepped outside my professional comfort zone to write for a new audience — and promised myself to avoid daily punditry and clickbait.\nWriting a newsletter is weird . You feel close to your subscribers: you see who’s signing up in the wake of a post that goes viral on Hacker News, and you’re occasionally bummed out to see a friend or a colleague leave. But these are the only signals you get. The nature of the internet is such that we almost never reach out to authors to say what we think.\nIn other words, I’m not sure what content will make your day and what will finally drive you to unsubscribe. That said, because the bulk of subscriptions happened in 2024 and 2025, I figured it might be a good opportunity to dust off three older articles that ended up below the fold:\nNot so fast, Mr. Fourier! — the discrete Fourier transform is one of the most important algorithms in computing, but you’d be hard-pressed to find an accessible explanation of what it does. I put a lot of effort into this one — complete with animations and sample code — and I think it’s without peer. The article doesn’t really show up in Google Search, so consider it this Substack’s secret.\nFractals: understanding Mandelbrot — fractals were a bit of a pop-cultural phenomenon in my youth. Numerous philosophical treatises were written and many serious mathematicians stared at them intently for years. Eventually, we said “well, that’s that then” and never spoke of fractals again.\nPrimer: core concepts in electronic circuits — if you read this one when it originally came out, you should give it another look. I revised it extensively to explain some of the key math behind analog circuits without leaning on any prior knowledge of calculus — something that no other source bothers to do.\nIn any case — thank you for giving this newsletter a chance. Here’s to tens more subscribers down the line!",

    "text": "В Белгородской области за последние сутки системы ПВО сбили и подавили более 50 беспилотников, запущенных со стороны Украины. Об этом сообщил в Telegram-канале губернатор региона Вячеслав Гладков.\nПо данным властей, атаки зафиксированы в 38 населённых пунктах, расположенных в 12 муниципалитетах. В результате обстрелов и атак дронов пострадали семь мирных жителей. Один из них находится в тяжёлом состоянии — мужчину госпитализировали в белгородскую больницу №2 после удара беспилотника по автомобилю в селе Вознесеновка.\nБольше всего атак пришлось на Шебекинский округ. По словам губернатора, дроны и боеприпасы были применены против таких населенных пунктов, как Шебекино, Шамино, Белянка, Купино, Доброе и других. Всего в этом районе зафиксированы удары 23 дронов — 10 из них удалось сбить. В городе Шебекино шесть человек получили ранения на территории одного из предприятий после попадания FPV-дрона.\nТакже атаки зафиксированы в Белгородском районе, где обстрелу подверглись восемь населённых пунктов, и в других округах области — Борисовском, Валуйском, Грайворонском, Краснояружском, Чернянском, Волоконовском, Губкинском, Новооскольском и Старооскольском.\nВсего, по данным губернатора, с украинской стороны выпущено 55 боеприпасов и применено 94 дрона, из которых 54 удалось сбить. Повреждения получили частные дома, административные здания, предприятия, автомобили и объекты инфраструктуры.\nРанее Минобороны сообщило, что более 50 украинских беспилотников атаковали Россию ночью.",

    "title": "Brock Purdy Gets Honest About Marrying a Farmer’s Daughter in New Commercial",
    "text": "Contrary to the bad-boy image of NFL players,\n[Brock Purdy](/tag/brock-purdy/) is a thorough gentleman. A devout Christian, rooted in country culture, the star QB’s earnest image made him a fitting choice for an endorsement deal with Pioneer Seeds. And as part of this partnership, Purdy recently released a promo video, in which he revealed the pre-requisite knowledge before marrying a farmer’s daughter, Jenna Brandt.\nAdvertisement\nIn the promo posted on Pioneer Seeds’ social media handles, Brock Purdy is seen recreating the currently viral “Of Course” trend but with country-themed dialogues. The main intention of the promo was to show Brock and Pioneer Seeds’ appreciation for farmers by establishing the former as an entity with an emotional connection with the farmers.\nThus, the promo saw Brock revealing that he got to marry Jenna, a farmer’s daughter, only after her dad approved his corn-picking skills. “I married a farmer’s daughter. Of course, I had to pick corn before her dad approved,” a proud Brock said.\nBrock also expressed his love for farmers, noting that, like them, he rises early and works late into the night. Concluding his speech, the NFL star quipped that he partnered with Pioneer Seeds, thus he surely knows how to excel on the field [pun intended].\n“I lived in the Midwest, of course, I appreciate America’s farmers. I married a farmer’s daughter, of course, I had to pick corn before her dad approved,” Brock said. “I’ve got a hard work ethic full of early mornings and late nights, of course, I share that with farmers. I played for lowa State and now the 49ers, of course I bleed Cardinal and gold. I partner with Pioneer Seeds, of course, I know how to excel on the field.”\nView this post on Instagram\nFans were super impressed with Brock’s participation in the viral trend. Moreover, they were impressed with Brock’s humility and earnestness while delivering the dialogue.\n“Class Act”: Fans Are Loving Brock Purdy in His Latest Promo for Pioneer Seeds\nThe majority of reactions to Purdy hopping on the trend were positive. But what stole the show for some was the star QB’s constant humility and sincerity while he expressed his connection with the farmers of America. This led to netizens labeling him a “class act”. Here’s how several others reacted:\n— Suresh (@sureshhmenonn)\n[May 31, 2024]\n— Suresh (@sureshhmenonn)\n[May 31, 2024]\n— Suresh (@sureshhmenonn)\n[May 31, 2024]\nSeveral NFL and Purdy fans, meanwhile, loved the QB in this new avatar and joked about buying corn seeds despite not being into farming. Safe to say, Purdy sure shows convincing skills.\n— Suresh (@sureshhmenonn)\n[May 31, 2024]\nWhat helped the video get traction is the fact that, with Pioneer Seeds, fans can see Brock Purdy in a completely different form. For instance, the previous Purdy-Pioneer promo video saw the QB answer the\ninternet’s questions on corn, farming, and football.\nBefore the Q&A video was the official partnership\nannouncement video, which saw the 49ers star talk more about his personal life by sharing how he uses Pioneer Seeds at his in-laws’ farm. It ended with him boldly and confidently earmarking this partnership for success in the years to come.\nThis glimpse of a bold Purdy is a far cry from the humility he naturally exudes in press conferences. Thus, seeing Purdy in different avatars thanks to the endorsement deal makes these promotional videos a hit amongst his fans. Fans, therefore, must be sincerely hoping for more.",
