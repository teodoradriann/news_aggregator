    "title": "'Making baseless allegations on Mahakumbh is like playing with faith of 56 crore devotees: CM Yogi in UP Assembly",
    "text": "Key Points\n- Over 56 crore devotees participated in Mahakumbh holy dip\n\"While we are participating in the discussion here, more than 56.25 crore devotees have already taken their holy dip in Prayagraj... When we make baseless allegations or spread fake videos against Sanatan Dharma, Maa Ganga, India, or the Maha Kumbh, it is like playing with the faith of these 56 crore people,\" he said.\nChief Minister further asserted that 'MahaKumbh belongs to society, not any political entity'. He dismissed claims that any specific group organizes Maha Kumbh.\n\"Any particular party or organisation does not organise this event... This event is of the society, the government is there as a servant to complete its responsibilities... It is our good fortune that our government got the opportunity to associate with the Maha Kumbh of this century... The country and the world have participated in this event and have taken it to new heights of success, ignoring all the false campaigns. \"\nAddressing the Mahakumbh stampede incidents, CM Yogi expressed his sympathies for the victims and their families while criticizing attempts to politicize the tragedies.\n\"Seven days of the Maha Kumbh are left, and as per the figures, more than 56 crore devotees have taken a holy dip till this afternoon... Our sympathies are with all those who were victims of the stampede on 29 January... and those who lost their lives in road accidents while travelling for Kumbh. Our condolences are with the family members, the government stands with them, the government will help them in every possible way but how appropriate is it to politicise this?..\" he concluded.\nThe UP CM accused the opposition led by the SP of being against the Kumbh and not participating in discussion on the preparations for the festival during the last assembly session.\n\"They (Opposition) have been against the Maha Kumbh since day 1... In the last session, the discussions and preparations for the Maha Kumbh were underway... We would have discussed the plans and taken your suggestions, but you did not let the House run... The National President of the Samajwadi Party asked what was the need to spend money on the Maha Kumbh... The social media handles of the Samajwadi Party used language which any civilised society would not use... Lalu Yadav called the Kumbh 'Faltu'. Another partner of the SP said the Maha Kumbh has become the 'Mrityu Kumbh'... Congress, Samajwadi Party, RJD and TMC leaders made irresponsible statements... If organising events related to the Sanatana Dharma is a crime, then our government will keep committing that crime,\" the CM said.",

    "title": "Dangerous waves hit California coastline | The Hill",
    "text": "State Watch Massive waves hit California’s beaches Thursday, as much of the coastline remains under coastal flood and high surf warnings and meteorologists warn residents to stay away from the water. The National Weather Service (NWS) warned that waves in some Northern California locations could reach 40 feet. In the Los Angeles area, NWS branches cautioned that beach conditions were becoming “extremely dangerous,” with “life-threatening rip currents,” and that the waves could also cause “significant beach erosion.” By late morning local time, the NWS and nearby observers began posting videos to social media of waves towering over piers and flooding boardwalks. “Tremendous wave energy entering the coastal waters has begun to generate EXTREMELY DANGEROUS conditions at the beaches this morning through this weekend,” the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reported Thursday morning. “Powerful cyclones over the northern Pacific waters are sending this long-period swell … towards Southern California waters,” the NOAA continued. “Swell heights and periods will drop off briefly tonight into Friday, before the next strong wave front arrives for this weekend.” “The ocean is NOT your friend today!” the NWS for the Bay Area warned Thursday on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. “Please use extreme caution and stay far from the water. NEVER turn your back on the ocean, stay off jetties, rocks, or piers, and do not go into the water!” the post continued, in response to photos of the damage the waves were already causing. High surf warnings began early Thursday morning in several areas on the coast. They remain in effect until early Monday morning for beaches in San Diego and Ventura counties and late Saturday evening for beaches in San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties. High surf warnings are set to expire earlier along much of the Northern California coast. They will end early Friday morning in Coastal North Bay, including Point Reyes National Seashore, Northern Monterey Bay, San Francisco, San Francisco Peninsula Coast, Southern Monterey Bay and Big Sur Coast. In Coastal Del Norte, Mendocino Coast, Southwestern Humboldt and Northern Humboldt Coast, the warnings will expire Thursday evening. High surf advisories also began Thursday morning in several areas. Orange County Coastal areas will remain under advisory until early Monday morning, while advisories expire late Saturday for Catalina and Santa Barbara Islands, Los Angeles County Beaches, Malibu Coast, Santa Barbara County Southeastern Coast and Santa Barbara County Southwestern Coast. Coastal flood warnings and advisories existed in many of the same areas for the same duration.

    "title": "“Des sales types” : cette colère froide d’Emmanuel Macron contre ses plus proches conseillers - Closer",
    "text": "6 mois seulement après son arrivée, le départ de Gabriel Attal de Matignon avait déjà été programmé. Une situation qui ne l’a aucunement meurtri, comme l’expliquait Le Monde , en juillet dernier. D’ailleurs, après sa sortie de l’Elysée , Gabriel Attal avait lancé : \" J’ai sauvé la République ! \". Le chef du gouvernement savourait un triomphe personnel, selon le média. Irrité par celui surnommé \" bébé Macron \", Emmanuel Macron n’a même pas voulu le regarder. Cela alors que Gabriel Attal annonçait son émancipation de la tutelle du président de la République. \" Cette dissolution , je ne l’ai pas choisie, mais j’ai choisi de ne pas la subir \", annonçait Gabriel Attal depuis le perron de Matignon face caméras. Juillet dernier, la position d’Emmanuel Macron n’avançait que de peu. Une conséquence de la lettre du Président aux Français qui n’a pas eu l’effet escompté, selon Libération . \" Un spectacle désastreux \", avait lancé le président de la République devant les dirigeants de son camp, le vendredi 12 juillet dernier. Des mots motivés par la colère , lancés en direction de Gabriel Attal. Comme le rapporte Le Monde , Emmanuel Macron s’est agacé à plusieurs reprises contre ses collaborateurs. Ces derniers ayant été jugés trop pessimistes après l’annonce de la dissolution. Dans le cas de Bruno Roger-Petit , il aurait été jugé trop bavard. Une source du palais a confié à nos confrères la raison de la distance entre lui et Emmanuel Macron . Une situation qui serait due à \" la grosse soufflante \" du président. \" Il a été tout près de la porte \", a ajouté une autre source au média. Une scène qui rappelle les sermons d’Alexis Kohler, secrétaire général de l’Elysée, en direction du conseiller. Rappelons qu’en 2020, il avait pris l’initiative de déjeuner en catimini avec Marion Maréchal .",
