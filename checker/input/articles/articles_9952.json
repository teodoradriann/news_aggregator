    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "text": "HYDERABAD - Jamshoro district police have booked a former Manager Auqaf and a private employee posted at the shrine of Hazrat Lal Shahbaz Qalandar (RA) in the FIR of theft of gold and silver worth around Rs 25.7 million from the shrine. The FIR was lodged on Saturday at Sehwan police station on the complaint of Irshad Ali Samo, Administrator Auqaf for the Sukkur and Larkana divisions. He nominated recently suspended Manager Muhammad Zubair Baloch and his private employee Ali Raza Gopang under sections 407, 409, 380, 457, 427 and 34 of the Pakistan Penal Code. The complainant alleged that the 2 accused persons stole over 57 tolas of gold and 3,133 tolas of silver from the shrine’s malkhana (store). According to him, 210.6 tolas of gold were placed in the store over almost 20 years starting from November 22, 2004, to August 17, 2023. He stated that 141 tolas of gold were deposited in a locker of the National Bank of Pakistan’s (NBP) main branch in Hyderabad while 68.15 tolas of gold and 4836.13 of silver were supposed to be the storage in the shrine. However, he added, when a jeweller was called to weigh gold and silver on December 19 only 11.8 tolas of gold and 1703.4 tolas of silver were found in the store. The administrator stated that during the departmental investigation, the manager Baloch admitted his negligence that he entrusted Gopang with the store’s key. He told the police that since the surfacing of the incident Gopang was at large while Baloch had been suspended from his job. He requested the police to arrest both the accused and to recover the stolen gold and silver.",
