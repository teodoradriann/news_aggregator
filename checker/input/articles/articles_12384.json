    "text": "La Copa Sevilla Tenis se está disputando en el Real Club de Tenis de la ciudad desde este pasado 1 de septiembre. La final está prevista para este domingo, por lo que tenemos por delante un fin de semana de tenis al más alto nivel en la ciudad.Los jugadores vienen de jugar del Open de Estados Unidos Este torneo celebra su edición número 61, se trata del torneo con más prestigioso de Andalucía y el tercero de España, sólo por detrás del Conde Godó y el Master 1000 de Madrid. Este año también cuenta con la novedad de la tierra batida en sus pistas. Un terreno que ya han probado estos días grandes tenistas como Albert Ramos o Roberto Carballés. Santiago Pérez, director de la Copa Sevilla, ha atendido a 7TV para valorar el papel de este tenista y su importancia en la historia de este torneo: “Es favorito desde el momento en que ha sido finalista y campeón en dos ocasiones aquí”. El único inconveniente que se le puede buscar a este torneo es la fecha, que suele ser un problema a nivel logístico para los tenistas. De cara a la próxima edición, la organización se plantea cambiarlo: “Los jugadores vienen de jugar del Open de Estados Unidos, llegan aquí con jet lag. Yo que hablo con ellos percibo lo complicado que es jugar un torneo como este cuando apenas han dormido tres horas”, añade Santiago Pérez a los micrófonos de 7TV. Aunque la Copa Sevilla se juega desde el año 1963, esta obtuvo la denominación de Challenger en el 1991, convirtiéndola así en puntuable para la ATP. A lo largo de su historia han pasado por sus pistas estrellas como Rafa Nadal, Carlos Alcaraz o Manolo Santana.

    "title": "GM Sues San Francisco Over Cruise Tax Bill, Which It Says Is Unfair",
    "text": "General Motors, the parent company of autonomous taxi outfit Cruise, has filed suit against the City of San Francisco over a $108 million tax bill that it says was incorrectly charged. And this may be some sort of revenge for the city and state's treatment of the company. San Francisco has charged GM business taxes over seven years, for its subsidiary Cruise LLC, that were based on a percentage of GM's $3 billion in global revenue, a bill that totaled $108 million. It's not clear if they tried to negotiate this previously behind the scenes, but GM has now gone to court over the matter, saying it should only be charged taxes based on the actual business it did in the city. As [Bloomberg first reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-27/gm-blasts-san-francisco-in-lawsuit-over-108-million-tax-bill?sref=9NMGxlsd), the lawsuit was filed last Friday in San Francisco Superior Court. GM wants their tax bill based on what they, via Cruise, actually sold in \"retail goods\" in the city, and they want $13 million in interest repaid on what they say was an unfairly charged tax bill. \"GM’s core automotive business does not employ anyone in the city, has no plants or other physical locations in the city, has no dealerships in the city, and sells only a de minimis amount of retail goods (approximately $677,000 in 2022) in the city,\" the lawsuit says. While Cruise, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of GM, is headquartered in San Francisco, GM's lawsuit now contends that it has only generated a small amount of revenue here. Still, they must have made more than $677,000 in 2023, given the expansion of their commercial business here this year — and that figure seems to just be for 2022, and it's not clear if that was rider revenue, or what \"retail sales\" means. But why is GM only now seeking this refund, weeks after it laid off nearly a quarter of its staff, when it's apparently been aware of how SF was charging it taxes for seven years? [NBC Bay Area reports](https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/gm-sues-san-francisco-refund-taxes/3407586/) that GM is seeking to recover all this money from SF — maybe in some kind of parting shot? — totaling $121 million, in a year when SF is facing an $800 million budget deficit. Cruise was doing business in San Francisco in 2022 and for much of 2023 — with the company quickly scaling up its number of autonomous taxis over the summer. Cruise took on more customers from the broader public starting in August, after the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) made their controversial decision to allow both Cruise and Waymo to widely expand their paid taxi services across San Francisco. Cruise would, as you likely know, go on to have a number of high-profile incidents that made the California DMV, and ultimately the PUC, doubt the safety of its vehicles. And this led to cruise [suspending all driverless operations](https://sfist.com/2023/10/27/cruise-suspends-all-driverless-operations-in-multiple-cities-following-ca-dmv-suspension/) in late October, [recalling all of its AVs](https://sfist.com/2023/11/08/cruise-recalling-self-driving-robotaxis-nationwide-amidst-report-vehicles-had-safety-issues-around-children/) nationwide, and [laying off 900 employees](https://sfist.com/2023/12/14/protesters-outside-public-utilities-commission-call-for-ouster-of-commissioner-who-worked-for-cruise/) just before Christmas. CEO Kyle Vogt also [resigned in mid-November](https://sfist.com/2023/11/20/monday-morning-headlines-ceo-of-cruise-resigns-after-robotaxi-recall/) — just two months after saying that [San Francisco aught to be \"rolling out the red carpet\"](https://sfist.com/2023/09/21/cruise-ceo-says-sf-should-be-rolling-out-the-red-carpet-for-robotaxis-threatens-to-maybe-leave-town/) for Cruise's AVs instead of being so persnickety about safety issues. So now, ahead of paying the bill for 2023, they are seeking a refund and a recalculation of how Cruise is being charged. Neither GM nor the SF City Attorney's Office have publicly commented on the suit as of yet. Meanwhile, it's unclear when or if we'll see Cruise's robotaxis on SF's streets again. There was talk about scaling up in Los Angeles when the company announced its layoffs earlier this month — but it has obviously spent a lot of money teaching its cars how to navigate SF's complicated city streets, so... they'll likely be back? Maybe not unless SF cuts them a break on the taxes.",

    "text": "OTTAWA — Health Canada is reminding Canadians about a recall of home bed assist handles after learning of an additional death. Four models of bed handles distributed by Drive Medical were first recalled two years ago after two reported deaths — one in Canada and one in the U.S. Health Canada says as of Dec. 19, the company has received a report of a second death in this country. The metal handles are affixed alongside the mattress to help people get in and out of their regular bed at home. The products are not designed for hospital beds. Health Canada says more than 68,000 of the affected handles were sold between 2016 and 2021 in Canada. It says consumers should stop using them and contact Drive Medical Canada to get a refund. The recalled home bed assist model numbers are 15064, 15062, RTL15073 and RTL15063-ADJ. No information has been provided about what caused any of the deaths, but the recall notice says that retention straps were not properly secured in the initial cases in Canada and the U.S. Drive Medical has also learned of an additional three deaths in the U.S. that happened before Dec. 6, 2021, when the recall was first issued. More than 496,000 of the bed assist products were distributed in the U.S. between 2007 and 2021. The products were sold on Amazon. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 28, 2023.

    "title": "The Pinkowitz Gift Adds 300 Mexican Prints to the Met’s Collection | Observer",
    "text": "While volunteering at Boston’s Museum of Fine Arts in 2009, JoAnn Pinkowitz was struck by the institution’s “Vida y Drama: Modern Mexican Prints,” an exhibition celebrating socially engaged printmakers like [Diego Rivera](https://observer.com/person/diego-rivera/), Leopoldo Méndez and [Francisco Dosamantes](https://observer.com/person/francisco-dosamantes/). These names would go on to dominate Pinkowitz’s art collection, which focused on revolutionary prints from both Mexican artists and Americans inspired by the nation’s culture. “It was JoAnn’s vision to build a world-class collection, and she went about it quite methodically,” her husband Richard told Observer. “Her mantra, to each dealer, curator and auction house, was: ‘Is it museum quality?’ She accepted no less.” To carry out the wishes of JoAnn Pinkowitz, who died in 2022, the more than 300-piece collection will now find a new home at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (Met). “Combined with our outstanding existing collection, the Pinkowitz gift makes the Met one of the most important repositories of Mexican prints in the United States, one that is quickly becoming a resource much used by artists, students and scholars alike,” said [Max Hollein](https://observer.com/person/max-hollein/), the museum’s director, in a statement. Addressing social issues with woodcuts and linocuts The gift will fill gaps in the Mexican holdings of the Met’s drawing and prints department, which has more than 2,000 works spanning the 18th and 20th Centuries. Pinkowitz’s collection largely draws from members of the Taller de Gráfica Popular or Workshop of Popular Graphic Art, a Mexican prints collective founded in 1937 that focused on art for social causes. Included in the donation is the 1948 Rio Escondido series by Mendéz, one of the collective’s founders. His [linocuts](https://portlandartmuseum.org/blog/daily-art-moment-leopoldo-mendez/) were used as a backdrop for the opening and closing sequences of Emilio Fernández’s film of the same name. The Workshop wasn’t limited to Mexican artists but included Americans like Elizabeth Catlett, who moved to Mexico in the 1940s. Her 1952 Sharecropper, a testament to the lives of Black women in the South, is also part of Pinkowitz’s gift. Pinkowitz, who previously donated works to the Museum of Fine Arts and Harvard Art Museums, validated the quality of each piece with museum curators. “After the first five or ten years, JoAnn personally knew most of the curators in the print field and befriended them all,” said Richard. “Most of her calls to curators ended with, ‘Let’s have lunch soon.’ And she did.” JoAnn Pinkowitz also became interested in Chinese Revolutionary prints after discovering the political and visionary similarities they had with Mexican artists, he said. Pinkowitz focused on works by artists involved in China’s Modern Woodcut Movement, which used inexpensive art materials to disseminate political messages during the 1930s and 1940s. A group of 31 woodcuts by the likes of printmakers [Gu Yuan](https://observer.com/person/gu-yuan/), [Wo Zha](https://observer.com/person/wo-zha/), [Yan Han](https://observer.com/person/yan-han/) and [Chen Yanqiao](https://observer.com/person/chen-yanqiao/) will also be gifted to the Met. “The Modern Woodcut Movement is an important but understudied chapter in the history of 20th-century Chinese art,” said [Joseph Scheier-Dolberg](https://observer.com/person/joseph-scheier-dolberg/), curator of Chinese paintings in the Met’s Asian art department, in a statement. “Thanks to the Pinkowitzs, these excellent and well-preserved examples help make the Met a necessary destination for any student of this significant movement.” Selections from the Pinkowitz collection will go on display in early 2025 in the Met’s Robert Wood Johnson, Jr. Gallery.",

    "text": "After a 20-year break, the Southeastern Conference will relaunch the SEC Volleyball Championship beginning in 2025 and has signed a three-year agreement to host the event at Enmarket Arena in Savannah, Georgia. The 2025 tournament is slated to take place on November 21–25, 2025, at Enmarket Arena. In addition, upcoming tournaments at the venue are scheduled for November 20–24, 2026, and November 19–23, 2027. “With the restoration of the SEC Volleyball Tournament, we will now host a championship event in every conference sport, providing our programs additional competitive opportunities as they prepare for NCAA postseason competition,” said [SEC](https://www.sportstravelmagazine.com/tag/sec/) Commissioner Greg Sankey. “We look forward to providing a memorable experience for SEC student-athletes, coaches and fans as we make Savannah home to the SEC Volleyball Tournament for the next three years.” The SEC Volleyball Championship previously took place from 1979 to 2005. The tournament was held on campus sites from 1979–1987 and 1994–2005, while the event took place at neutral locations from 1988–1993. Earlier tournament champions include Florida (12 titles), Kentucky (5), LSU and Tennessee (4 each) and Arkansas and Georgia (1 each). “Welcoming the SEC Women’s Volleyball Championships for the next three years marks one of Savannah’s most significant sports milestones,” said Joseph Marinelli, president and chief executive officer of [Visit Savannah](https://www.sportstravelmagazine.com/tag/visit-savannah/) and [Savannah Sports Council](https://www.sportstravelmagazine.com/tag/savannah-sports-council/). “Hosting these exceptional athletes and this prestigious event is a tremendous honor for our city. It will draw visitors nationwide and provide fun, inspirational family entertainment for our community and Low Country.” Enmarket Arena, which is a part of the [Oak View Group](https://sportstravelmagazine.com/tag/oak-view-group/), is a multi-purpose complex that opened in February 2022. It includes a 9,500-seat arena and is home to the Savannah Ghost Pirates of the East Coast Hockey League. “We at OVG are thrilled to host the SEC Volleyball Tournament at Enmarket Arena and we thank the SEC for choosing us as the site of the championship these next few years,” said Monty Jones Jr., general manager of Enmarket Arena. “Our partnership with Visit Savannah and the Savannah Sports Council underscores our commitment to bringing high-caliber sports to Savannah and will help elevate Savannah’s status as a premier destination for major sports and entertainment.” The Savannah Convention Center will serve as the official practice facility for the tournament. “The Savannah Convention Center is proud to be the official practice facility for the 2025, 2026, and 2027 SEC Volleyball Tournaments,” said Kelvin Moore, senior vice president and general manager of the Savannah Convention Center. “We’re excited to showcase our newly expanded venue, now better equipped to host even more premier sporting events.”",

    "text": "En medio de una niebla tremenda en Liverpool y con el escenario del ‘Boxing Day’ de fondo, el líder de la Premier League amplió su ventaja al remontar al Leicester City (3-1) y, pese a tener un partido menos, tiene una ventaja de siete puntos sobre el Chelsea y de catorce sobre el Manchester City.\nLeer más: [Díaz, Durán, Muñoz y Lerma ven acción en el tradicional ‘Boxing Day’ de la Premier League](https://www.elheraldo.co/deportes/2024/12/25/diaz-duran-munoz-y-lerma-ven-accion-en-el-tradicional-boxing-day-de-la-premier-league/)\nLos de Arne Slot cerraron la jornada del ‘Boxing Day’ con un trabajado triunfo ante el Leicester City, que sólo necesitó seis minutos para adelantarse por medio de Jordan Ayew, pero que acabó notando la presión y arrollo del mejor equipo de Europa.\nLe costó, eso sí, a los ‘Reds’ sacudirse el susto inicial, cuando Ayew bailó en el área a Andy Robertson y sacó un disparo a la media vuelta que tocó en Van Dijk lo justo para desviar la trayectoria a Alisson.\nFue un tanto sorprendente en un Anfield que tras una racha de nueve victorias seguidas en casa pinchó la jornada pasada contra el Fulham y se temió un resultado parecido ante el conjunto de Ruud Van Nistelrooy.\nLeer más: [Duras sanciones de la Dimayor al América por los disturbios en la final de la Copa Colombia ante Nacional](https://www.elheraldo.co/deportes/2024/12/25/duras-sanciones-de-la-dimayor-al-america-por-los-disturbios-en-la-final-de-la-copa-colombia-ante-nacional/)\nLos ‘Foxes’, candidatos claros a descender, se aliaron con la fortuna y sortearon tres veces el empate gracias a la madera. Mohamed Salah, en dos ocasiones, y Andy Robertson, en un cabezazo, se estrellaron en el palo, hasta que antes del descanso, en el tiempo de descuento, Cody Gakpo dibujó una parábola a la escuadra para cimentar la remontada del Liverpool.\nEl golazo del holandés, que ya lleva once dianas esta temporada, alivió a los de Slot, que se fueron al descanso sabiendo que la segunda parte dictaminaría sentencia para un Leicester que se había conformado desde el 0-1 y que pensaba que ese gol de Ayew le podría valer para llegar hasta el final con vida.\nLeer más: [Luis Díaz habló sobre su desempeño en Liverpool, Arne Slot y la actualidad de Jhon Jader Durán](https://www.elheraldo.co/deportes/2024/12/25/luis-diaz-hablo-sobre-su-desempeno-en-liverpool-arne-slot-y-la-actualidad-de-jhon-jader-duran/)\nPero no tardó ni cinco minutos el Liverpool en poner el 2-1. Curtis Jones en el primer palo culminó una gran combinación iniciada por Salah y continuada con un pase raso de Alexis Mac Allister. Jones empujó la pelota de primeras y, pese a que el VAR revisó un posible fuera de juego, el tanto subió al marcador y el Liverpool respiró tranquilo.\nLas ocasiones empezaron a fluir y, aunque a Gakpo le anularon su doblete por un fuera de juego de Darwin Núñez, lo que no se pudo evitar fue el tanto de Salah, el decimosexto de esta Premier League.\nLeer más: [¡Qué frío! Cristiano Ronaldo pasa Navidad en casa de Papá Noel y se baña a 20 grados bajo cero](https://www.elheraldo.co/deportes/2024/12/25/que-frio-cristiano-ronaldo-pasa-navidad-en-casa-de-papa-noel-y-se-bana-a-20-grados-bajo-cero/)\nEl egipcio encaró a su par y su nivel de confianza es tal que no le importó tener a dos jugadores por delante. Clavó la pelota en el palo largo y se dirigió a la grada con los brazos abiertos. Esta le respondió con su cántico habitual y solo queda que la directiva de Anfield le ofrezca un nuevo contrato.\nEs el mejor jugador de la liga y, pese a llevar un partido menos que el resto, ha generado 16 goles y once asistencias. Es, con diferencia, el mejor goleador y el mejor asistente de la competición.\nA nivel grupal, el Liverpool, con un partido menos, tiene 42 puntos, siete más que el Chelsea y ocho más que el Nottingham Forest. Si ganara el Arsenal al Ipswich Town este viernes, el equipo de Mikel Arteta se colocaría como el máximo perseguidor, con una desventaja de seis unidades.",

    "text": "QUEENS (WABC) -- Doctors say gene therapy is something the medical community has been working toward for decades. They say it's a game changer, not just for one particular disorder but for other similar disorders. In many ways, Yusef is just your average 8-year-old. He loves dinosaurs, watching TV, and playing with his twin sister. But now, he's making history as the first patient in the state of New York to undergo an FDA-approved gene therapy for a rare inherited blood disorder called beta-thalassemia. \"Speaking personally as a medical professional, but especially a pediatric hematologist and colleges and transplant doctor, this is just such an unbelievable time to be practicing, literally watching medicine change on a day-by-day basis in front of our eyes,\" said Dr. John Fish, Head of Stem Cell Transplant and Therapy at Cohen Children's Medical Center. Previously, the only treatment options were a bone marrow transplant from a donor, usually a compatible family member, or blood infusions every two to four weeks. Yusef, unable to find a match, has received transfusions at Cohen Children's since he was 2 months old. This new therapy changes that. \"The patient is his own donor. We actually collect the patient's own stem cells and send them to a lab where a gene is added into the blood cells so the patient can start producing the normal adult hemoglobin. When the cells are ready, we receive the cells back and infuse them back to the patient,\" said Dr. Banu Aygun, Associate Chief of hematology at Cohen Children's Medical Center. Fifteen years ago, in this very hospital, Yusef's aunt, Aleeza, underwent a bone marrow transplant for the same disorder. His mom, Yusara Ahmed, says the advancements since then are astonishing, and it now gives Yusef and the family a chance at a life without monthly visits to the hospital. \"Very relieved and very happy that we're, you know, back to like a more normal setting and a more and more normal life where it's not just like, Oh, we have to take out a whole day for a transfusion or any trip that we're planning. We have to, like, make sure that we know or if we're going anywhere,\" Ahmed said. \"So it was really great that, you know, we were able to finally, you know, just have this opportunity to, you know, get him to treatment. So and we're just very thankful.\"",

    "text": "Tempest Therapeutics, Inc. announced that Cancer Research Communications published positive clinical data from the dose-escalation Phase 1 trial of TPST-1120 in an article titled \"First-in-Human Phase I Trial of TPST-1120, an inhibitor of PPARa, as Monotherapy or in Combination with Nivolumab, in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors\". The data showed that TPST-1120 demonstrated clinical activity, including tumor shrinkage, even in PD-1 inhibitor refractory and immune compromised cancers, and was well tolerated both as monotherapy and in combination with nivolumab. These earlier Phase 1 data complement the positive Phase 1b/2 data reported in October 2023 from a global randomized study of TPST-1120 In combination with atezolizumab and bevacizumab in first-line patients with advanced HCC, which showed clinical superiority of the TPST-1120 arm across multiple study endpoints and relevant biomarker-defined patient subpopulations.\nTPST-1120 Phase 1 Study: In this first-in-human Phase 1 study, 35 patients were treated with escalating doses of TPST-1120 either as monotherapy (20 patients) or in combination with the anti-PD-1 therapy, nivolumab (15 patients). TPST-1120 was well-tolerated as monotherapy and in combination, with a maximum tolerated dose not identified and predominantly low-grade toxicity. Notwithstanding the late-line stage of these patients and difficult to treat tumor types, clinical benefit was observed as both a monotherapy and combination.2 In monotherapy, a best response of stable disease (SD) was observed in 53% (10/19) of evaluable patients, with 5 of those patients staying on treatment for more than 5 months.\nTumor shrinkage of target lesions on treatment occurred in 21% (4 patients) and a best response of no target lesion growth was seen in 3 additional patients. In the combination therapy cohorts, including patients with heavily pretreated cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC), the objective response rate (ORR) was 23% (3/13, all partial responses, or PRs) across all dose levels and 30% (3/10) at the two highest dose levels of TPST-1120, suggesting dose-responsive anti-cancer activity. These responses included a 50% ORR in patients with RCC (2/4 evaluable) who had previously progressed on anti-PD-1 therapy, and one patient with heavily pre-treated CCA.\nAnalysis of whole blood specimens revealed changes in expression of PPARa-associated immune genes that were related to TPST-1120 dose levels. Some of these changes were only observed in patients who had partial responses, linking TPST-1120 biological activity to clinical outcome.\nShare © S&P Capital IQ - 2024",
