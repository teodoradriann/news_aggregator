    "title": "Scotland faces more snow and rain as Met Office issues warnings ahead of New Year - Daily Record",
    "text": "People in Scotland have been warned that they could face a final bout of [wild weather](https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/weather) before the year is out. The Met Office has issued two new weather warnings that could see huge swathes of the country battered by snow and rain in the final weekend of 2023. Forecasters warned that an 'active frontal system' may bring periods of snow across the north of the country, with as much as 10cm falling on higher ground. Motorists travelling across the New Year weekend have warned over potential traffic jams on roads, with the chance of stranded cars and passengers. It comes after Storm Gerrit wreaked havoc on Scotland and much of the UK this week, with thousands left without power and cars stranded on the A90 due to heavy snowfall resulting in a 'major incident' being declared. And it looks like further disruption is on the cards for Saturday, December 30 due to two new alerts for snow and rain are due to come into force. Both warnings are set to begin at 8am, although their impact and end times differ. The first warning, which lasts until 3pm in the afternoon, has been issued due to a period of sleet and snow of up to 5cm that is forecast which will turn into rain, and may cause some flooding and public transport disruption. It covers Dumfries and Galloway, East Lothian, Midlothian, the Borders, East Ayrshire, South Ayrshire and South Lanarkshire. During this time, people in this area should be prepared for public transport journeys taking longer than usual, with some flooding on the roads and disruption to services such as power cuts. The Met Office said: \"A band of rain, with snow on high ground for a time, will extend northeast across southern Scotland on Saturday morning, clearing from the west in the afternoon. Rainfall totals of 15 to 25 mm are expected across the warning area in a few hours, and 30 to 40 mm possible over hills, along with 2-5 cm of snow above 250-300 metres.\" A second warning is also in place which covers more of the country, due to last from 8am until 11.59pm on Saturday, December 31. Rural communities are at risk of being cut off, with the chance of travel delays and stranded vehicles on the roads. Forecasters said: \"Snow accumulations are expected largely above 250-300 metres, where 5 to 10 cm may accumulate. At lower levels mostly rain is expected with 15-25 mm, although some snow accumulations may occur for a time over northwestern areas, with perhaps 1 to 3 cm in places. \"Snow turning to rain in the south early afternoon and melting snow over high ground along with some heavy rain and saturated ground may lead to some flooding of roads and railways. Rain and snow clearing from the south through the afternoon and evening.\" Regions and local authorities affected Central, Tayside & Fife - Angus - Clackmannanshire - Dundee - Fife - Perth and Kinross - Stirling Grampian - Aberdeen - Aberdeenshire - Moray Highlands & Eilean Siar - Eilean Siar - Highland Strathclyde - Argyll and Bute - East Dunbartonshire - Inverclyde - North Ayrshire - Renfrewshire - West Dunbartonshire Don't miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond.

    "text": "IMD issues red alert for dense fog in north India as travel remains chaotic Story highlights A thick blanket of fog enveloped the national capital which led to a delay of more than a hundred flights and trains A thick blanket of fog enveloped the national capital which led to a delay of more than a hundred flights and trains The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a red alert for dense fog which has blanketed parts of north India in the past few days – especially Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, and Chandigarh. “Dense Fog Advisory for Punjab, Haryana, Delhi Uttar Pradesh, north Rajasthan and north Madhya Pradesh: Be careful while driving or outing through any transport. Use fog lights while driving. Be in touch with airlines, railways, and state transport for your journey schedule,\" wrote the weather office on social media platform X. The national capital remained covered with a thick blanket of fog which led to a delay of more than a hundred flights as the visibility remained low in the national capital. The Delhi airport on Thursday (Dec 28) reported that nearly 134 domestic and international flights were delayed, and 35 international departures and 28 international arrivals remained affected. Meanwhile, there were delays in 43 domestic departures and 28 domestic arrivals on Friday (Dec 28). The New Delhi Railway Station also faced a similar situation when 22 trains were delayed which left passengers stranded in the biting cold.

Even though there was little improvement, the air quality continued to remain in the \"very poor\" category for the next two days. “The reason the fog situation saw some improvement on Thursday was due to overnight winds in several areas. The wind speed on Wednesday night reached up to 8 kmph, so the fog dissipated. However, on Friday the wind speed will drop,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, a scientist with India Meteorological Department (IMD), while speaking to The Times Of India. “We have issued the red warning for Friday, suggesting that the time between 4 am to 10 am could see accidents as visibility will be very low. So, unless it’s very essential, do not take out your vehicle at this time,” Srivastava added. Meanwhile, the IMF issued an orange alert for dense to moderate fog on Saturday (Dec 30). trending now Air quality likely to deteriorate further The Met department on Thursday (Dec 28) released INSAT imagery in which a dense fog layer was seen over north India, which affected the regions in Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and northwest Madhya Pradesh. The dense fog created low visibility conditions in these regions which led to traffic disruptions and accidents. Extending its warning, the IMD predicted dense fog over Punjab and Haryana for the next five days. For the next three days, Uttar Pradesh is likely to witness dense fog due to which guidelines have been issued by the UP State Road Transport Corporation for bus operations in low visibility conditions. Watch: Intense cold wave continues in North India, red alert issued in several states due to fog An advisory was issued by the Delhi Airport Authority in which it was said that flights, which are not compliant with CAT III standards, are likely to face disruptions. Further, potential health risks related to dense fog were also highlighted by the IMD, which emphasised the presence of pollutants and particulate matter which can adversely affect respiratory health. “Weather conditions are not favourable for effective dispersion of pollutants. Emissions from firecrackers if burnt on December 31 will further deteriorate air quality… The predominant surface wind is likely to be from the east-southeast direction in Delhi-NCR with a wind speed of 6-4 kmph with partly cloudy sky with dense to very dense fog at most places in the morning on December 29,” predicted the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology's air quality early warning system.

    "text": "news Apr 02, 2025 3 mins Generative AI Healthcare Industry ROI and Metrics From 40% to 57% of healthcare industry organizations have already put generative AI tools into use, according to a survey by McKinsey & Co.\nCredit: Shutterstock/raker Generative AI (genAI) is quickly transforming healthcare, according to a survey by consultancy McKinsey & Co. released today. The survey of 150 healthcare industry organizations found 85% are exploring or had already adopted genAI.\nThe organizations, which included insurers, health systems, and health services and technology (HST) groups, found that 40% or more from each group had already implemented genAI. Not surprisingly, HST organizations have the highest rate of genAI implementations at 57%. The least? Healthcare providers with a 40% implementation rate.\nGenAI has already been proven in studies using historical patient data to be more accurate at diagnosing illnesses and other conditions. For example, OpenAI’s GPT-4 Turbo model not only outperformed physicians, but also outdid every single AI system developed for healthcare over the last 50 years, according to the lead doctor in one study at Beth Israel Medical Center in Boston. And it did so without any medical training.\nHealthcare stakeholders are also using genAI to explore ways to create value and reduce costs, despite ongoing challenges such as evolving regulations and capability gaps.\nOf the respondents that have already implemented genAI tools, 64% reported that they anticipated or had already quantified positive ROI, “suggesting high expectations for genAI technology,” McKinsey said.\nMany organizations are also forming partnerships to access external talent while customizing AI solutions, and partnerships with hyperscalers could ensure successful implementations, McKinsey said.\nEarly genAI use cases have focused on improving administrative efficiency, dealing with IT gaps, and boosting clinical productivity. As capabilities grow, other uses could expand to patient engagement and quality-of-care improvements. Leaders recognize the importance of AI risk management and governance for safe implementation.\nOrganizations that have developed their genAI capabilities are seeing success with large-scale implementations, b ut future success will depend on a value-driven strategy, strong execution, and effective management, McKinsey said.\nMost respondents reported their organizations had implemented or were developing genAI use cases, with more in the implementation phase than the proof-of-concept stage. However, 15% had not started proof-of-concept work.\nOther prominent findings include:\nNearly half (47%) of payers, health systems and HST groups have already rolled out genAI tools. About three-quarters of healthcare leaders believe the technology could help most with administrative efficiencies and clinical productivity — and more than half (55%) believe it has value for patient/member engagement and IT/infrastructure. Sixty-one percent of payers and providers expect to collaborate with partners on building out their genAI capabilities; 20% said they’d build their own; 19% said they’d buy a program. GenAI may create “tremendous value” in areas that could fundamentally improve patient experience and streamline operations to generate cost savings, the report said.\nRelated content News Analysis AI chatbots outperform doctors in diagnosing patients, study finds By Lucas Mearian Feb 13, 2025 6 mins Chatbots Generative AI Telemedicine",

The aircraft and crew will aid search efforts after flash flooding in Texas. (Photo by Spc. Armani Wilson/U.S. Army National Guard) North Dakota National Guard equipment and personnel will assist the search for victims of flash flooding in Texas. North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong authorized the National Guard’s MQ-9 Reaper, a remotely piloted surveillance drone, and its support team to assist in search operations in response to an Emergency Management Assistance Compact request from Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. The central Texas floods killed 120 people with more than 170 people still reported as missing, according to the news release. The authorization marks the first time the state’s National Guard unmanned aerial vehicle team has supported a request for assistance through the emergency compact, Armstrong’s office said Thursday. “Other states have come to our aid in extremely challenging times, and North Dakota stands ready to help Texas through this catastrophe however we can,” Armstrong said. The Fargo-based 119th Wing of the North Dakota Air National Guard will remotely pilot the unmanned aircraft from Fargo, said Brig. Gen. Mitchell Johnson, adjutant general of the North Dakota National Guard and director of the Department of Emergency Services.

    "text": "After practicing with a thin secondary and offensive line Wednesday, the Ravens returned Thursday with almost the full active roster. The only player missing from practice, outside of those with long-term injuries, was Sala Aumavae-Laulu, a reserve offensive lineman. He missed Wednesday’s practice for personal reasons, according to the injury report. The defensive backs saw the return of Pro Bowl safety Kyle Hamilton (back), cornerback Jalyn Armour-Davis (personal) and first-round pick cornerback Nate Wiggins (neck/concussion). Hamilton and Armour-Davis played in the first two games. Hamilton was the starting safety, while Armour-Davis contributed mostly on special teams. Wiggins played in the first game, mostly on special teams, before a car accident sidelined him from practice and games for the next week. Wiggins was in a red no-contact jersey. On the offensive line, starting left tackle Ronnie Stanley (ankle) returned to practice. He played every snap of the first two games. In the Week 2 game against the Las Vegas Raiders, he grabbed his leg a few times but finished the game. Coach John Harbaugh said Wednesday that the team was working through things but Stanley would be good to go for Sunday’s game against the Dallas Cowboys. Outside linebacker Kyle Van Noy (eye/groin) fractured his orbital bone against the Kansas City Chiefs but made it back for the Raiders game. The groin injury was new to his injury report, but he returned Thursday. The Ravens have one player, cornerback Arthur Maulet, designated to return from injured reserve. Running back Keaton Mitchell is on the physically-unable-to-perform list. There are six other players on IR, but all are depth players.",

    "text": "Tesla shares plummeted more than 10% Thursday, wiping billions off the company’s valuation after CEO Elon Musk failed to allay concerns about stagnating growth and persistent price cuts on the company’s earnings call.\nThe electric vehicle maker ushered in steep price cuts to maintain demand throughout 2023, resulting in 38% growth in vehicle deliveries that hardly translated into additional revenue, prompting worry from investors and analysts.\nOn Wednesday, Tesla reported quarterly results that missed analysts’ expectations, including annual revenue that grew by merely 3% despite significantly higher sales volume, and a forecast for a potential “notably lower growth rate” than in 2023 as it invests in a next-generation vehicle it says it will begin building in 2025.\nMeanwhile, Musk is asking for more control over the company after drawing down a significant portion of his Tesla stock amid his purchase of Twitter in 2022.\n“Tesla is currently between two major growth waves,” Musk told investors Wednesday. The company is preparing to ship a new iteration of its driver-assistance system, he said, and is making progress toward its next vehicle.\nWall Street observers expected better news out of the earnings call. Dan Ives, a tech analyst with Wedbush Securities, said executives failed to address short-term concerns, even though he remains sold on the company’s long-term value.\n“We were dead wrong expecting Musk and team to step up like adults in the room on the call and give a strategic and financial overview of the ongoing price cuts, margin structure and fluctuating demand. … instead we got a high-level Tesla long-term view with another train wreck conference call,” Ives wrote Thursday.\nThe company’s falling margins and “constant never-ending price cuts” are concerns, Ives wrote.\nGene Munster, managing partner of Deepwater Asset Management, said the company’s outlook gave investors pause.\n“This was the most sobering guidance I’ve seen from Tesla,” he said.\nMusk also faced questions about his public demand for 25% of the company’s voting shares. Musk said Wednesday he wants the power to resist activist investors who may have “strange ideas” about how to run Tesla.\n“I don’t want to control it, but if I have so little influence over the company at that stage, I could sort of be booted out by some random shareholder advisory firm,” Musk said.\nTesla laid out other plans for 2024 on the call, including rolling out the latest version of its Full Self-Driving Beta software, the company’s advanced driver-assistance system, to around 400,000 users.\nBut the company has faced new challenges with regulators when it comes to its driver-assistance software, Autopilot, which can maneuver its vehicles from highway on-ramp to off-ramp, maintaining a set distance and speed and even making lane changes. Full Self-Driving brings those capabilities to surface streets, allowing the vehicles to navigate from point to point, following road signs and making turns. Drivers must pay full attention at all times while using the software.\nTesla agreed last month to recall 2 million vehicles, nearly every car it has produced, over concerns that Autopilot did not adequately safeguard against driver misuse. The recall, conducted via a remote update, followed a series of meetings with regulators in late 2023 amid a larger investigation into Autopilot.\nDays before the recall was announced, The Washington Post published an investigation identifying at least eight fatal or serious crashes involving Autopilot in locations where the software was not intended to be used.\nSuccess.

    "text": "El sindicato de enfermería de Málaga (SATSE) ha denunciado la anulación de los permisos de jornada reducida para aquellas madres con hijos que padecen enfermedades graves. Un derecho adquirido en el año 2017 que permitía conciliar la vida familiar de las trabajadoras del hospital. El centro médico todavía no se ha pronunciado al respecto, pero desde el sindicato acusan que no solo salen perjudicadas las enfermeras, sino que también están privando a los niños de recibir la atención requerida. El caso más sonoro es el de Virginia, la madre de un niño que padece Epidermólisis Bullosa, más conocida como Piel de Mariposa. El chico necesita cuidados constantes y curas diarias ya que su enfermedad está bastante avanzada. Desde el Sindicato confían en que los tribunales hagan justicia. Las trabajadoras, tras no recibir respuesta por parte de la Delegación de Salud, han acudido al Defensor del Pueblo Andaluz. La plantilla critica que la decisión únicamente ha tenido una motivación económica y que en ningún momento se ha tenido en cuenta las necesidades de cuidado permanente que tienen los niños. La imagen del Hospital queda dañada tras esta decisión que perjudica a las enfermeras con hijos que padecen cáncer u otras enfermedades graves. Desde el Sindicato insisten en que no solo están dañando a las trabajadoras del Hospital, sino que son los niños los más perjudicados con esta medida, a los que se les priva de recibir los cuidados que necesitan.",

    "text": "Matthew Mare–Herald Correspondent His desire for power at times eclipses his sense of reasoning and judgment. Today you dump your MPs and Senators because of Tshabangu and form another political party and yesteryear you dumped MDC- T for MDC-Alliance. The basis for the formation of all these parties from MDC T, MDC-Alliance, CCC and now the Democratic Alliance party, is the desire to consolidate power. A normal political party in this 21st century era cannot be a one-man band, no congress, no structures, and the party is formed through press conference and the leader just resigns no congress or extra-ordinary congress so that the decision has ownership. Today, “God is in CCC” and the next day, “I no longer have anything to do with CCC”. These are the pitfalls of dumping legitimate structures and stakeholders like labour, CSOs, NGOs, academics and instead listening to student activists who are even novices in politics. Chamisa has reduced the whole opposition spectrum to student activism and instead of honouring his mistakes he rushed to blame Zanu PF as if it sits in his meetings. Chamisa has trust issues, everyone around him especially those who challenge his authority are Zanu PF projects and state infiltrators. If infiltration is that easy, why not reciprocate it to Zanu PF. The danger is that the traditional funders now understand him well and his blame game antics. He has lost trust and credibility from his funders, stakeholders, and founders of the MDC at its inception in 1999. This political confusion of forming four political parties in a span of six years, has never been witnessed in the entire history of politics and political philosophy. Political dementia is a serious threat to politics. Who went to former President Mugabe and who made a pact with him, and Jonathan Moyo post 2017. What had Chamisa promised the former President for him to openly declare in 2018 that he was going to vote for Chamisa. This shows Chamisa is deliberately Zanu PF by night and opposition by the day. Social media is awash with Chamisa’s cries, wanting to be accorded an opportunity to meet President Mnangagwa so that, he gets projection. He thinks and dreams power, a dangerous political character. He should be straightforward as a leader; political meandering is dangerous. What was Chamisa doing with the G4O political renegades during the 2018 elections? All he cares about is power, even if it means betraying the electorate and these are dangerous signs of a dictator. There is no democracy in Chamisa’s character and political manoeuvres. The way Chamisa grabbed power upon the demise of Tsvangirai are the same tactics he is deploying to smuggle himself into the State House. The late musician, Simon Chimbetu was right that, the longest distance in Zimbabwe is getting to State House in his song “ku State House kure”. I think we need to adopt the approach by other jurisdictions of mental examination to political candidates before they are allowed to assume political leadership. The cumulative effects of the actions by Chamisa point to political insanity. Has Chamisa calculated the implication his decision has made to the electorate, funders, sitting MPs and Senators elected under the CCC. By resigning and by operation of the law he has expelled all the remaining MPs and Senators from Parliament and Senate respectively just because he wants to shield himself from Tshabangu. This decision to resign has nothing to do with the interests of the electorate but purely selfish move. A true leader does not betray his own but instead stands up to protect own supporters. By quitting CCC he has inadvertently recalled all his MPs and Senators from Parliament and Senate for selfish gains. If they are in Parliament and Senate on the CCC card, by distancing himself from that party, he is also distancing himself from them. What a great betrayal to his own political colleagues? Chamisa has caused more extensive damage than the one cause by Tshabangu, if the principle of reasoning and quantitative damage is to be applied. In politics never take the electorate for fools that you make dance to your tune willy-nilly.",
