    "text": "Puerta del Sol, en Madrid (Shutterstock España). Agosto transforma Madrid en una ciudad inusualmente apacible y llena de oportunidades para descubrir su lado más auténtico y cercano. Mientras muchos residentes hacen las maletas rumbo a las costas, la capital despliega una programación veraniega vibrante , salpicada de fiestas populares, cultura al aire libre y experiencias únicas que seducen a quienes deciden quedarse o visitarla en pleno verano. Esta combinación de ambiente relajado y oferta cultural diversifica la manera de vivir Madrid en agosto, cuando sus calles y plazas rebosan planes para todos los gustos.\nFiestas populares de agosto: tradición y alegría en todos los barrios El mes de agosto en Madrid no sería el mismo sin sus legendarias verbenas y celebraciones patronales. Estas fiestas, repartidas por barrios históricos, llenan la ciudad de mantones, claveles, música y ambiente familiar desde principios hasta mediados de mes. Todo arranca con la festividad de San Cayetano en Lavapiés, donde la plaza Vara del Rey acoge conciertos y actividades, seguida de San Lorenzo , con bailes y celebraciones en las plazas de Nelson Mandela, Cabestreros y Arturo Barea. El ciclo culmina con la esperada Virgen de la Paloma , que convierte la carrera de San Francisco y la plaza de los Carros en escenarios irrepetibles, mientras los conciertos en las Vistillas animan las noches más calurosas.\nLope a la fresca: poesía y arte en las noches veraniegas\nCasa Museo Lope de Vega, en Madrid (Web del Museo). Quienes buscan planes diferentes pueden acudir a las sesiones de Lope a la fresca , organizadas por la Casa Museo de Lope de Vega durante todos los viernes de agosto. En el jardín del museo, ubicado en pleno centro histórico, las noches se visten de poesía, música en directo y encuentros teatrales que honran la tradición de “salir a la fresca” y compartir vivencias bajo la brisa nocturna madrileña. El acceso es libre hasta completar aforo y la propuesta abarca desde charlas sosegadas hasta la declamación de versos, en un entorno tan literario como acogedor.\nPerseidas: las lágrimas de San Lorenzo iluminan el cielo de agosto Uno de los fenómenos astronómicos más esperados del verano es la lluvia de estrellas conocida como las Perseidas, que suele alcanzar su punto álgido sobre el 12 de agosto. Bajo las condiciones idóneas, lejos de la contaminación lumínica, es posible observar entre 50 y 100 meteoros por hora en el cielo madrileño. El Observatorio Astronómico Nacional prevé el máximo a partir de las 22:00 horas, permitiendo a curiosos y aficionados disfrutar del espectáculo de la naturaleza desde cualquier rincón de la ciudad.\nVeranos de la Villa 2025: la gran cita cultural del estío Los Veranos de la Villa representan el corazón de la programación de agosto en Madrid. Este festival multidisciplinar moviliza la ciudad con talleres, conciertos, exposiciones , proyecciones y espectáculos para todos los públicos. Entre las propuestas destacan rutas olfativas para explorar Madrid de forma distinta, teatro en el Circo Price o música al aire libre en el Conde Duque. Además, el “Cine Caliente” en el Parque de la Bombilla, y festivales musicales como los conciertos de Yerai Cortés, Pasión Vega o la fiesta Stereo Party, con bandas de los años 90, mantienen viva la energía colectiva. La mayoría de las actividades son gratuitas o con precios muy accesibles, haciendo del verano una oportunidad especial para redescubrir la ciudad.\nREUTERS/Ana Beltran REFILE - QUALITY REPEAT Museo Banksy: arte contemporáneo en estado puro\nMuseo Banksy de Madrid (Web del museo). Otra novedad del verano es el Museo Banksy , un espacio permanente y monográfico dedicado al inconfundible artista urbano. El museo alberga 170 réplicas de sus obras más conocidas en 1.500 metros cuadrados de exposición interactiva. Su colección permite navegar por el universo combativo, irónico y reivindicativo de Banksy, posicionando a Madrid como uno de los grandes referentes europeos del arte contemporáneo y alternativo.\nBuenas Noches 2025: festival cultural a la fresca en Hoyo de Manzanares A pocos kilómetros de la capital, la localidad de Hoyo de Manzanares se suma también a la oferta estival gracias a su festival de artes escénicas Buenas Noches 2025 . Del 12 de julio al 23 de agosto, la plaza Cervantes será escenario de espectáculos gratuitos que abarcan desde la música clásica y el jazz hasta el flamenco, la danza y las artes circenses. Este evento convierte las veladas del municipio en encuentros llenos de cultura y convivencia bajo las estrellas.\nCines de verano: noches refrescantes bajo las estrellas\nAutocine Madrid Race, en Madrid Para quienes buscan un plan relajado y familiar, los cines de verano son una de las joyas de agosto en Madrid. Basta con esperar a que baje el sol y acudir a las proyecciones al aire libre de CinePlaza en Matadero, los grandes éxitos del Parque de la Bombilla o las funciones comentadas del Cine Caliente. Incluso el Autocine Madrid ofrece una experiencia vintage pensada para todas las edades y gustos, perfecta para combatir las altas temperaturas y despedir el día entre risas y palomitas.\nEl concierto sorpresa de los Veranos de la Villa: misterio y música Una de las citas más esperadas de agosto es el concierto secreto de los Veranos de la Villa. Como ya es tradición, el 14 de agosto se revelará en el Centro Cultural Conde Duque el protagonista de un directo único cuya identidad se mantiene en secreto hasta su aparición en el escenario. Las entradas para este evento se pueden descargar gratuitamente desde el 11 de agosto, añadiendo un aura de expectación y sorpresa inigualable a la programación estival.\nFestival de San Lorenzo: música y patrimonio en la sierra La sierra madrileña también vibra en agosto con el Festival de San Lorenzo, que reúne trece espectáculos musicales en enclaves patrimoniales como el Teatro Auditorio , la Capilla de Nuestra Señora de Abantos, la Lonja del Monasterio o el Teatro La Antigua Mina en Zarzalejo. Propuestas como “1 piano y 2000 velas” de David Gómez, el Ballet flamenco de Madrid con la Orquesta Ciudad de Alcalá o el Living Room Room de Fátima Miranda muestran la rica diversidad artística de la región.\nEsta es la historia de San Isidro Labrador: cinco milagros, sus restos están en una iglesia de Madrid y tiene una moneda de Enrique IV en la garganta. Festival Escenas de Verano: cultura en todos los rincones de la región El Festival Escenas de Verano complementa el calendario con más de 250 actividades de danza, teatro, cine y circo que se despliegan en plazas y espacios de toda la Comunidad de Madrid. Esta apuesta garantiza que la cultura y el entretenimiento lleguen a localidades grandes y pequeñas, democratizando el acceso a las artes en los meses de mayor calma y calor.",

    "text": "‘Oito Ducati não deviam ser permitidos; não é bom para o Mundial’ – Massimo Rivola\nA Ducati é o construtor mais representado no atual pelotão de MotoGP, tendo oito motos: as duas da equipa satélite e seis distribuídas por três equipas satélite. Por isso mesmo, tem muito mais possibilidades de testar e experimentar soluções inclusive durante os Grandes Prémios, o que só favorece uma Desmosedici GP já bastante veloz. Massimo Rivola, diretor-executivo da Aprilia Racing, contesta a grande vastidão de Ducati que há no MotoGP.\nO dirigente disse citado pelo site SPEEDWEEK.com que a RS-GP irá melhorar, mas há depois que ver o que isso representa em relação aos restantes construtores: ‘A moto do próximo ano tem de ser melhor, e não há motivo para duvidar disso. Portanto, a questão será: o quão melhor irá ficar a KTM, o quanto irá melhorar a Ducati, com a vantagem que já teve? E a Yamaha. O que eles mostraram em Sepang foi um pouco preocupante. Eles vão receber concessões e vamos ter de os deixar fazer isso, mas pareço um pouco idiota, porque – por que é que faríamos isso? Mas o maior problema é que temos oito Ducati super velozes no pelotão’.\nA Aprilia quer ser pelo menos o segundo construtor na hierarquia, mas Rivola realçou que com oito motos em pista a Ducati tem muitas vantagens no desenvolvimento e preparação da moto. O italiano admitiu que não devia ser permitido ter tantas motos: ‘Não quero ofender ninguém, porque eles o fizeram e nós não. O problema é que não deviam ser permitidos. É o que digo todos os dias a Carmelo [Ezpeleta, diretor-executivo da Dorna]. Não digo que eles não estão certos. Eles fizeram-no, investiram muito – e bem. Mas não é bom para o Mundial’.\nO conteúdo ‘Oito Ducati não deviam ser permitidos; não é bom para o Mundial’ – Massimo Rivola aparece primeiro em Motorcycle Sports.",
