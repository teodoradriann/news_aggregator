    "text": "The U.S. Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, issued a reminder warning citizens to “reconsider” any travel plans to the country, amid rising tensions between Israel and Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed terror group in southern Lebanon.\nIn a statement issued on Thursday, the embassy explained that the “security environment” in Lebanon was “complex” and could “change quickly,” adding that the Lebanese government could not “guarantee the protection of U.S. citizens.”\n“We remind U.S. citizens to strongly reconsider travel to Lebanon,” the embassy said in the statement. “The security environment remains complex and can change quickly.”\nLebanon: U.S. citizens should review the current Travel Advisory and strongly reconsider travel to Lebanon.

Israel responded by firing at several terrorist sites located in southern Lebanon.\nAs Breitbart News previously reported :\nHezbollah is violating United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, the resolution that ended the Second Lebanon War in 2006 and prohibited Hezbollah from locating military installations south of the Litani River.\nHezbollah again fired rockets at Israel overnight on Tuesday, June 11, and into Wednesday after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) carried out a strike that eliminated Sami Taleb Abdullah, a senior commander of the Nasr Unit in Hezbollah’s organization.\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has suggested that a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza would be the “best way to” de-escalate “the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah.”\nOther countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, and Canada have issued warnings for their citizens to leave Lebanon in light of the rising tensions and conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.\nIsrael / Middle East Politics Antony Blinken Hezbollah Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Lebanon Middle East travel warning U.S. embassy",

    "text": "LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Europe's commercial real estate market is defying expectations of a recovery as investor caution pins property sales to near-decade lows.\nSome investors and banks, recognising that the outlook remains weak, are even beginning to step in to offload or restructure distressed assets, one executive said, though they added that an \"extend and pretend\" approach to bad debts is still commonplace.\nIt is a marked change in mood from the beginning of 2025 when there were hopes for an end to a three-year pandemic-induced downturn, but unpredictable U.S. trade policy, the promise of stronger returns in other private markets and a refusal by sellers to recognise lower prices have hit activity.\nYear-on-year commercial property sales in Europe were flat in the first quarter of 2025 at 47.8 billion euros ($55.6 billion), less than half the level of three years earlier, according to the latest revised MSCI data.\n Early indicators suggest a poor second quarter - cross-border investment into property in Europe, the Middle East and Africa fell about a fifth from a year earlier to 17.2 billion euros, the worst April-June period in a decade, property agency Knight Frank said, citing preliminary MSCI data.\nSluggish sales have affected most sectors including hard-hit offices and even data centres, a previous bright spot, although the under-supplied rental housing market continues to attract interest.\n \"We have 'zombieland' ... no recovery, stranded assets, no liquidity coming back,\" said Sebastiano Ferrante, head of European real estate at U.S. fund giant PGIM.\nWhile logistics and hotels also presented buying opportunities, out-of-town offices and old shopping malls are among assets struggling to find buyers, Ferrante added.\nCanada's Brookfield asked bondholders to approve the restructuring of a loan secured against its London CityPoint office tower in April, according to a regulatory filing, after shelving a sale when bids fell short of its expectations.\nIn Germany, one of the country's most prominent property casualties - the Trianon skyscraper in Frankfurt - has been put up for sale by its administrator, Reuters reported last week, in a rare test of the fragile German market.\nThere is also fierce competition for funds from other private markets such as credit.\nPrivate credit funds in Europe raised $39.9 billion in the first half of 2025, nearly double the $20.6 billion for real estate funds, according to Preqin data.\nHowever, both were on track to top their 2024 totals, with property already ahead of last year's poor tally.\nSurvey data nonetheless points to ongoing caution. Investor sentiment towards European real estate fell to its lowest in over a year in June, according to trade body INREV, mirroring the U.S. market, where sentiment has also soured this year.\n\"In some parts of the market the recovery is well under way... However there are out of favour assets and sectors where there is almost no liquidity and more pain to come,\" said Cecile Retaureau, head of private markets at the investment arm of insurer Phoenix.\nGermany, Europe's largest economy, has been particularly hard hit by the property slump, with sales down another 2% in the first half of this year, according to data from CBRE.\n\"Transaction volumes will not jump. It will not kickstart in a very dynamic way,\" said Konstantin Kortmann, CEO of property agency JLL in Germany, who expects a gradual recovery.\nWhile still-high interest rates mean property investors have to be selective to make money, the prospect of international cash shifting to Europe from the volatile U.S. market could help, the property executives said.\nAt least two of PGIM's German clients have cancelled planned property investments in the United States, reprioritising Europe and Asia, Ferrante said.\n($1 = 0.8602 euros)\n(Reporting by Iain Withers in London and Tom Sims and John O'Donnell in Frankfurt, Editing by Tommy Reggiori Wilkes, Kirsten Donovan)\nBy Iain Withers, Tom Sims and John O'Donnell\n© Reuters - 2025",

Photo: UM Tommy Martino TOPICS:\nData analytics Beer sales University of Montana Dram Shop Marketing Social media Sales data Real-world experience MISSOULA, Mont. — A University of Montana data analytics course for business students is using beer sale data to make the course more engaging.\nA clinical professor of marketing in the College of Business, Dr. John Chandler partnered with the Dram Shop to access hundreds of megabytes of sales data.\nUM students use the data that includes sales by day, hour and type of beverage to resolve real world business problems.\nWhen students were analyzing the Dram Shop's social media they discovered an Instagram post about a Seattle-based beer led to a spike in sales.\nAnalysis from the students is shared with the Dram Shop to help track their business and decide where to allocate resources.\n“The neat thing about doing it year over year is it gives us an opportunity to compile historical data and see how things change over time... We can make conjectures about what we think is going on and then we can check the data to see if that is actually true or not,” Zachary Millar, UM alumni and owner of the Dram Shop said in a press release.\nThe University of Montana sent out the following:\nIn an effort to make data analytics less dry, a University of Montana business course introduced beer. Beer sales data, that is.\nDr. John Chandler, a clinical professor of marketing in the College of Business, wanted to give students in his Telling Stories with Big Data class a real-life data set to analyze.\nSo seven years ago Chandler partnered with the Dram Shop, a taproom and growler fill station in Missoula with 40 taps of draught beer, wine, cider and soda. The local business is owned by UM alumni Zachary and Sarah Millar, who gave Chandler full access to hundreds of megabytes of data in their point of sales system. The raw data includes sales by day, hour and type of beverages sold.\nThe partnership allows UM students to use the data to answer important questions and solve real world problems for the local business.\n“The College of Business is where academia meets the real world,” Chandler said. “The students can meet with Zachary and Sarah and try to help them, which I think is something you don’t always get in analytics programs.”\nEach fall semester, Chandler breaks his class into groups who work to answer different questions using the sales data. The analysis helped the Dram Shop track their business through the COVID-19 pandemic, develop the Dram Fam customer club and make price changes.\nZachary Millar visits the class each year to hear from the students and get their data-driven insights. The results help Millar decide where to put his energy and resources, he said.\n“The neat thing about doing it year over year is it gives us an opportunity to compile historical data and see how things change over time,” Millar said. “We can make conjectures about what we think is going on and then we can check the data to see if that is actually true or not.”\nMillar graduated from UM in 1999 with a creative writing degree. He spent 11 years working for Big Sky Brewing in Missoula, including six years as the distribution coordinator. He and his wife opened the Dram Shop on Front St. in 2015 and opened a second location off Paxson St. in 2019.\nMillar said he’s always felt supported by UM. His original business plan for the Dram Shop was developed with the help from UM’s Blackstone LaunchPad, a nonprofit organization supported by the Blackstone Charitable Foundation that helps students and alumni build entrepreneurial skills.\nWhen he was approached by Chandler about helping with the data class, Millar didn’t hesitate. He sees the partnership as a win-win for his business and the students’ experience.\n“I think it has more impact for the students when they can look at us and we are real. We are not some data model somebody built,” Millar said. “It gives them more ownership over the work they are doing and it makes them feel like they can have a real impact, which is inspiring as a student.”\nChandler’s class draws interest from a variety of graduate and undergraduate students who are studying journalism, math, computer science or earning an MBA or master’s in analytics.\n“I’m trying to get a diverse group in there,” Chandler said. “The more viewpoints you have, the more you have different ways of understanding information.”\nUM student Kapono Mossman, a senior marketing major from Pukalani, Hawai’i, enrolled in Chandler’s class this past semester. He was interested in learning how to use data in a marketing plan and also had interest as a math minor.\nFor the Dram Shop project, Mossman worked in a group focused on marketing and growth. The group analyzed the Dram Shop’s social media and looked to see if there was a correlation with sales.\nMossman’s group studied an Instagram post from May 22 that advertised a new beer from Seattle-based Fremont Brewing that was newly available at the Dram Shop. The students looked at the sales data from that week and discovered sales for the beer grew by 20%, showing the impact of social media.\nMossman shared his findings with the Dram Shop and encouraged them to keep posting regularly on their social media channels since it leads to higher sales.\n“To put in this work and an actual business in the city is taking your feedback, it’s pretty cool,” Mossman said.\nMossman said he’s never had a class that offered so much real-world experience from working with a local business to actually providing the business beneficial feedback. Getting hands-on experiences like that is a big reason Mossman decided to become a marketing major.\n“I chose to change my major and go to the College of Business because they pride themselves on their partnerships with businesses and giving you real world experience through the classroom,” he said.

Les Américains ont confirmé officiellement. \"Entre début et mi-octobre, la Corée du Nord a envoyé au moins 3 000 soldats dans l’est de la Russie. Nous estimons que ces soldats ont voyagé par bateau\", a déclaré John Kirby, le porte-parole du Conseil de sécurité nationale américain. Les soldats actuellement sur des sites d’entraînement, selon la BBC Les Ukrainiens ont diffusé une vidéo à l’attention des soldats nord-coréens, dans leur langue. Le message les invite à se rendre aux autorités ukrainiennes. Images de prison à l’appui, on leur promet qu’ils seront bien traités et recevront \"trois repas par jour avec de la viande, des légumes frais et du pain\". Les soldats se trouvent actuellement sur des sites d’entraînement, notamment à Oulan-Oudé et Oussouriisk (Russie), selon la BBC. La Corée du Nord, qui fournissait déjà des armes à la Russie, envisagerait d’envoyer au total 12 000 hommes, selon la Corée du Sud.

    "text": "Key Takeaways - Cloud Imperium Games reportedly lays off staff amid Star Citizen's ongoing development. - The layoffs reportedly impact about 1% of the company's workforce, following mandated seven-day work weeks. - No full release date for the game has been announced. Cloud Imperium Games, the studio behind the in-development space trading and combat game, Star Citizen, has reportedly laid off an unspecified number of staff members. The layoffs come amid Star Citizen 's annual ship showcase, the Intergalactic Aerospace Expo, the run-up to which saw Cloud Imperium staff working consecutive seven-day weeks. The space simulator has raised an eye-watering $700 million in funds over the past 12 years, making Star Citizen far and away the most expensive game ever put into production. Despite the extended timeline and enormous expense, the game remains in early-access alpha, with only limited content available, and the inability to maintain persistent Star Citizen character stats . [Related 3:58 ](/most-expensive-games-ever-made-total-cost/) [ The 18 Most Expensive Games Ever Made (& How Much it Cost to Make Them) ](/most-expensive-games-ever-made-total-cost/) Just as the power of home consoles and high-end gaming rigs has increased in recent years, so too has the cost of developing cutting edge games. As first reported by Insider Gaming , sources have confirmed that a number of employees have been released over the past several days, though the extent of the layoffs remains unclear. One of Insider Gaming's sources put the number of those affected at 12, representing about 1% of the company's workforce. While those purported numbers are still low, the studio has a history of letting employees go over periods of time, with the Star Citizen developer's last round of layoffs occurring over several weeks. More Layoffs but No Timeline for Full Release The move reportedly comes with no compensation for released employees and is occurring right on the heels of an intensive period of mandated seven-day work weeks that led up to the IAE event. The IAE is one of many similar in-game events that showcase new ships available in Star Citizen , and allow prospective players to play the game free for a short period of time. With no formal announcement from the company at present, the full scope of the layoffs, and the reason behind them, remains unknown. Having let around a hundred employees go in early 2024 amid accusations of fostering a toxic work environment, and despite failing to announce a release date for the full version of the game, Cloud Imperium Games continues to pile up cash . The company's financial reports show development costs hitting over $100 million annually for the past several years. How long that kind of spending can continue without a fully published title remains to be seen. Even without a clear roadmap for a full release, development appears to be moving forward, with a new star system and other content slated for Star Citizen's latest update. However, the massive game originally pitched to crowdfunding investors still seems light years away, with some critics wondering if the finished game will ever go live.",

    "text": "Gaming GTA GTA 6 fan recreates trailer in Minecraft John Esposito 54:36 54:48 YouTube: EvilGame GTA 6 isn’t coming until 2025, and fans are getting restless waiting for new content. One fan took the time to recreate the reveal trailer in Minecraft, with the result rather impressive.\nIt feels like eons ago, but after a massive leak in 2022 and a series of leaks before the reveal, Rockstar finally lifted the lid and showed the world GTA 6 in early December. While the trailer didn’t show any gameplay, it racked up an otherwordly viewer count , an impressive display of how far the series reaches.\n Since then, it’s been radio silent, and rightfully so since GTA 6 is still a little under two years away, Rockstar is holding all the cards, barring more catastrophic leaks. That hasn’t stopped fans from spending hours combing over the trailer for an ounce of new content while others have recreated it in various ways .\n A new recreation of the trailer has gone live, this time calling on the power of Minecraft.\nGTA 6 official trailer recreated in Minecraft YouTube creator EvilGame shared their creation to their account , and it’s amazing how well the recreation is. Everything perfectly matches, at least the best it can with Minecraft’s style, as scenic shots showed off the Florida Joker, the mud-girl, and more.\n The YouTube comments loved the recreation, as plenty of praise was given to EvilGame for taking the time to recreate the full trailer. GTA 6 subreddit users caught the trailer and shared it to the platform, with the reactions echoing the YouTube comments, albeit a little bit funnier.\nSign up to Dexerto for free and receive: Fewer Ads | Dark Mode | Deals in Gaming, TV and Movies, and Tech Email Sign up Gta 6 trailer but its Minecraft\nby u/ForzaLeclerc806 in GTA6 “The thought……the time devoted…….my guy you are a serial killer,” one reply eerily replied. Another felt the same and bluntly stated: “Where do people find the time to do this sh*t?”\n Of course, videos like these open up the floodgates for hardware jokes, and there was no shortage of those. “Damn didn’t know the Switch was getting a version,” while another said: “This is how the graphics are going to look like on my Asus work laptop.”\nAlong with that, the timeless GTA 6 release joke made an appearance: “We really got GTA 6 in Minecraft before GTA 6.”\n Impressive feat nonetheless, but be sure the Florida Joker doesn’t see this , or else his demands are going to reach GTA Online bank account levels of absurdity.\n Related Topics GTA 6 Minecraft About The Author John Esposito John graduated with a degree in Sport Management in 2017, before discovering he had a hidden joy for writing.

    "text": "Il conto alla rovescia è iniziato: il 14 ottobre 2025 Windows 10 dirà addio al supporto gratuito . Da quel giorno, chi vorrà continuare a ricevere aggiornamenti di sicurezza dovrà passare a Windows 11 oppure pagare per il supporto esteso. Ma non tutti ci stanno. Anzi, in California , qualcuno ha deciso di portare Microsoft in tribunale.\nMicrosoft sotto accusa per Windows 10: ecco perché Il protagonista è Lawrence Klein , un utente che accusa Microsoft di aver violato il codice per la tutela dei consumatori e la legge contro la pubblicità ingannevole , interrompendo il supporto a Windows 10 troppo presto. Secondo Klein, circa 240 milioni di dispositivi nel mondo non sono compatibili con Windows 11 a causa di requisiti hardware troppo severi, come il famigerato Trusted Platform Module 2.0 (Tpm) e l’esclusione di alcuni processori ancora relativamente recenti.\nIl risultato è che chi non può aggiornare si trova costretto a comprare un nuovo Pc , spesso già predisposto per l’IA Copilot, con un conseguente aumento dei rifiuti elettronici.\nKlein sostiene che questa scelta rientra in una strategia per spingere gli utenti a investire in nuovi dispositivi. La campagna di marketing non è certo discreta: molti utenti Windows 10 hanno già visto annunci a tutto schermo che promuovono il passaggio al nuovo sistema.\nFine di Windows 10: causa e polemiche Al momento, Microsoft offre un anno di supporto esteso a 30 dollari , gratuito però se si utilizza un account Microsoft e si sincronizzano i dati su OneDrive. Klein chiede invece che un tribunale obblighi l’azienda a mantenere il supporto gratuito “finché la quota di Pc con Windows 10 non scenderà sotto il 10% degli utenti Windows totali”.\nIl tema non è banale: a meno di un anno dalla scadenza, Windows 10 è ancora installato sul 43% dei Pc nel mondo, secondo StatCounter. Per fare un confronto, al termine del ciclo di vita di Windows 7 la quota era già scesa al 25%. Microsoft sembra contare su una “migrazione dell’ultimo minuto” verso Windows 11, ma con i requisiti hardware attuali non è così semplice per molti utenti.\nAnche se la causa non dovesse avere successo, il clamore mediatico rappresenta già un problema per Microsoft. La questione dei requisiti hardware e del rischio di e-waste è destinata a rimanere al centro del dibattito. Chissà: forse questa pressione spingerà Microsoft a rivedere le sue mosse, regalando a Windows 10 un’ultima, inattesa proroga .",
