    "text": "1/1 Swipe or click to see more COURTESY OF KAREN WOOD\nWorkers clean up the Wailua River to unblock the bridge area in April.\nLIHUE >> A federal disaster declaration from President Joe Biden was hailed by local and federal lawmakers, who said the decision would bring much-needed relief to communities on Kauai affected by severe weather and flooding in April.\nThe decision, which was announced Tuesday, sets forth the release of federal assistance through the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Public Assistance and Hazard Mitigation programs. Total funding is not known and is determined based on projects eligible for assistance from FEMA.\nThe disaster declaration stems from a storm that\nbarreled into the island on April 11 and produced roughly 12 inches of rain in some areas over a 12-hour period.\n“We are incredibly grateful to our federal partners for recognizing the significant damages sustained to our island’s infrastructure as a result of the severe flooding this past April,” said Mayor Derek S.K. Kawakami in a statement.\n“Through this crucial support, we remain on course to address needed repairs, rebuild, and enhance our resiliency against future disasters. We thank all partners who continue to work tirelessly during this recovery period, and most of all to our residents and all impacted for their ongoing patience.”\nFederal lawmakers from Hawaii were appreciative of the Biden administration for moving swiftly.\n“FEMA has been a key partner in this process, and we thank the Biden administration for moving fast to approve this disaster declaration,” said U.S. Sens. Brian Schatz and Mazie K. Hirono and U.S. Reps. Ed Case and Jill Tokuda in a joint statement earlier this week. “This declaration will help our state and county governments rebuild and recover.”\nThe Kauai Emergency Management Agency will take the lead on the coordination and application process of the federal programs.\n“FEMA’s Public Assistance program ensures that the County of Kauai can recover from the immediate impacts of the disaster by funding emergency work and repairs to public infrastructure,” the county said in announcing the disaster declaration. “In addition, the agency’s funds from the Hazard Mitigation Grant aim to prevent future disasters or reduce their impact by investing in long-term resilience projects.”\nThe April storm dumped 12.51 inches of rain in Kalaheo, 12.05 inches in North Wailua Ditch, 11.8 inches at Lihue Airport, 11.35 inches in Omao, 11.26 inches in Wailua, 10.59 inches in Poipu and 10 inches in Kapahi all between 6 p.m. April 11 and 6 a.m. April 12, the National Weather Service said.\nAs a result, Kawakami and Gov. Josh Green signed emergency proclamations, which prompted the American Red Cross to dispatch volunteers and open two shelters during the early hours of April 12.\nThe Kauai Police Department said water rescues did occur due to rising flood­waters, but there were no reports of any serious injuries.",

    "title": "Biden Administration Spent Nearly $1 Billion On Inaccurate COVID Messaging | OutKick",
    "text": "The party of \\\"science\\\" misled hundreds of millions of people on the actual science surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. Stop the presses. Starting in early-2020, the combined efforts of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the CDC, the Department of Health and Human Services and their partners in the media caused an untold amount of damage to society, public health and might have even created conditions for increased COVID spread. How? They repeatedly, profoundly, and often purposefully communicated inaccurate information, spending hundreds of millions of dollars to get their preferred messages across. Now, a new, massive, 113-page report from the U.S. House of Representatives Energy & Commerce Committee has detailed the remarkable abuses from the Biden-Harris administration and how they communicated during COVID. Biden, CDC Partners Wasted A Fortune To Lie To The American People The report details a number of unbelievable inaccuracies in 2021 coming from the Biden administration's communications team and the CDC's messaging apparatus. Fauci and Francis Collins' National Institutes of Health were also responsible, creating guidance using taxpayer money, nearly $1 billion, per the report, that misled millions of people and caused unimaginable harm in the process. \\\"While the Biden-Harris administration’s public health guidance led to prolonged closures of schools and businesses, the NIH was spending nearly a billion dollars of taxpayer money trying to manipulate Americans with advertisements—sometimes containing erroneous or unproven information. By overpromising what the COVID-19 vaccines could do—in direct contradiction of the FDA’s authorizations—and over emphasizing the virus’s risk to children and young adults, the Biden-Harris administration caused Americans to lose trust in the public health system,\\\" Committee Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) said after the report's release. \\\"Our investigation also uncovered the extent to which public funding went to Big Tech companies to track and monitor Americans, underscoring the need for stronger online data privacy protections.\\\" One of the most damaging, and woefully incorrect messaging campaigns centered on vaccine efficacy against infection. As the report details, Biden's \\\"Stop the Spread\\\" campaign was a pervasive marketing effort, in conjunction with the CDC, that claimed vaccines would end the pandemic by reducing infections. That had enormous knock-on effects, including decreasing trust in all vaccinations and ultimately harming public health. \\\"The entire premise of the Biden-Harris ‘Stop the Spread’ campaign was that if you got vaccinated for COVID-19, you could resume daily activities because they said vaccinated people would not spread the disease,\\\" said Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations Chair Morgan Griffith (R-VA). \\\"Despite lacking scientific basis, the administration bought into this CDC claim and misled the American public. As a result, vaccination coverage with other vaccines appears to have declined, I believe because of a growing distrust of information coming from our public health institutions.\\\" This campaign was even more disingenuous and purposefully misleading than previously realized. The \\\"Stop the Spread\\\" publicity blitz hid in plain sight a message from the CDC that even they didn't know whether the vaccines actually did stop infection or transmission. The report shared a screenshot of a page from the Biden administration's marketing that specifically said \\\"science\\\" wasn't sure how well the vaccines worked against infection. Yet the Biden administration made life-altering policy decisions like vaccine mandates, discriminatory entry processes, and military vaccination requirements regardless. On top of the less quantifiable impacts like nudging millions of people to follow their preferred course of action. CDC Guidance Exacerbated Existing Problems The report also explains how the Biden administration relied heavily on guidance from the CDC, an organization that thoroughly disgraced itself during the pandemic. There were several examples highlighted, chief among them that CDC \\\"experts\\\" went far beyond what even the FDA claimed COVID vaccines could do. Without evidence, the report says Biden's marketing claimed that \\\"COVID vaccines were highly effective against transmission.\\\" Within just a few months, it was clear that all the available evidence pointed in the exact opposite direction. Per the report, this had a \\\"negative impact on vaccine confidence and the CDC’s credibility when proven untrue.\\\" The CDC also had \\\"inconsistent and flawed messaging about the effectiveness of masks,\\\" which created seemingly endless mandates and again, overconfidence in an ineffective policy. Some of those mandates even continue to this day. READ: Mask Mandates Are Back In California, As Endless Cycle Continues That's just the start of their misinformation. A wealth of data and public embarrassments for the CDC confirmed that the organization \\\"consistently overstated the risk of COVID-19 to children,\\\" the report says. That fearmongering had disastrous consequences, from unnecessarily terrifying parents to prolonged school closures and lack of socialization. Setting an entire generation of children back in the process. Still, after being repeatedly and profoundly proven wrong, the CDC has demonstrated they've yet to learn their lesson. In late-2024, the CDC continues to recommend COVID-19 vaccines for babies starting at six months old. That makes the US a global outlier compared to European nations who have maintained at least some level of intellectual honesty. How Do We Fix CDC Abuses? The report detailed several recommendations to fix these organizations after their disastrous work during the pandemic. Even implementing just a select few, listed below, would do wonders for fixing the institutional rot that influenced these mistakes. Also highlighted in the report is how the CDC and NIH put their weight behind attempts to censor scientists who dissented from their preferred narratives. Beyond their mistakes, profound inaccuracies and nearly unlimited spending, their censorship efforts are equally concerning. As we learned during COVID, if there's one thing \\\"experts\\\" hate, it's being told that they were proven wrong. Instead of learning, adjusting and apologizing, they move to censor, criticize and mislead. This new report is the latest confirmation of these unacceptable \\\"mistakes.\\\" And reaffirms the importance of ensuring they never happen again.",

There are differing reports on the accident, with insidethegames.biz reporting that the 29-year-old was struck by an “unlicensed motorcyclist,” while AgenciaBrasil reports that she was struck by a car. (Based on CNN’s reporting, it would appear that the driver collided with both Baptista and another motorcycle.)\nBaptista’s team said that she had “suffered an accident when she was training on Saturday morning on a road in the district of Santa Eudoxia, in São Paulo,” according to the AgenciaBrasil report. “A car that was coming along the track collided head-on with the bicycle the athlete was riding and the driver fled the scene without providing assistance.”\nhttps://www.instagram.com/ge.globo/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=808b8e4e-73f2-4074-adea-1f8b3b0ea3fa\nBaptista is currently 52nd in the World Triathlon Olympic rankings. In addition to her individual gold medal from the Pan Am Games, Baptista helped the Brazilian team take gold in the mixed relay at the 2019 Games, too. Baptista has also excelled at middle-distance races, taking the win at Ironman 70.3 Pucon in 2022 and finishing eighth at this year’s Professional Triathletes Organization European Open last May.\nThis article originally appeared in\nTriathlon Magazine",

    "text": "Ciudad de México.- Las expectativas del próximo año para el empleo en México son optimistas, gracias al nearshoring. Se espera que se generen entre 700 y 750 mil puestos de trabajo , 100 mil más que en 2023, de acuerdo con Manpower. Mónica Flores, presidente para América Latina de la empresa de capital humano, manifestó que la llegada de inversiones por la relocalización dará estabilidad al mercado laboral. “ El nearshoring da un impulso único a la generación de empleo, es una ventana de oportunidad que como país debemos aprovechar. “ Veo con optimismo el 2024, más en unos estados que en otros, por supuesto el norte siempre es mucho más positivo que el sureste, pero aún con esto, el sureste sigue siendo positivo en cuanto a la expectativa de contratación”, consideró. Afirmó que no se anticipa un periodo de inestabilidad por el cambio de Gobierno, ya que las inversiones seguirán llegando. “ El nearshoring es una fuerza muy poderosa que no se va a ver afectada por las elecciones. “ En este sentido no creo que se vea una disminución del empleo por ser año electoral ni que haya gran incertidumbre en el país de qué vaya a pasar, gane quien gane”, señaló Flores. Mencionó que las inversiones del nearshoring se consolidarán en un lapso de cinco años y luego habrá un periodo de estabilidad. Para la experta, 2 023 cerrará de manera positiva en términos de registros de empleados en el IMSS. Martha Hernández, directora de Consultoría en Capital Humano de AON, México, coincidió en que hay inversión que está llegando al país, desde este año y para el próximo.",

    "title": "5 tips for evangelizing on social media",
    "text": "ACI Prensa Staff, Mar 28, 2024 / 08:00 am (CNA). Friar Nelson Medina, a Dominican known for his extensive apostolate on the internet, offered five tips for Catholics to do a better job evangelizing on social media. The Colombian priest, who holds a doctorate in fundamental theology, shared the following recommendations with ACI Prensa, CNA’s Spanish-language news partner. 1. Practice gratitude. “Consider it a privilege and a great opportunity to use these new means of communication to bear witness and reach many people,” Medina said, encouraging the faithful to be grateful. 2. God doesn’t need a perfect façade. The Dominican also encouraged internet evangelists to avoid “the temptation to present your life or person as if you never had problems, because the people you are addressing certainly do.” 3. Be aware of your responsibility. Medina also pointed out that anyone presenting himself or herself as a Catholic evangelizing on social media “somehow represents the body of Christ.” “Consequently, the immense price of his blood is at stake in everything we do with our social media,” he emphasized. Consequently, the Colombian priest stressed: “Stay faithful to the sound doctrine and morality of the Church.” 4. Don’t give too much importance to haters or trolls. “You may encounter ridicule or attacks. In such cases we must remember that Christ told us that this was going to happen,” Medina noted. So, “we shouldn’t give it utmost importance but rather handle the situation with the tools that social media itself gives us and move on,” he said. 5. Always nourish your personal life as a Catholic. “Remember that nothing can replace the life of prayer, the sacraments, and belonging to a real community of people like yourself who are on their journey to the Lord,” he concluded.

    "text": "As the world grapples with the need to combat climate change, green energy has become a pivotal area of focus. India, with its vast population and burgeoning economy, stands at a critical juncture as our energy consumption patterns evolve, with a noticeable shift towards renewable sources. Today, India's green energy sector is at a nascent stage but poised for exponential growth. The expectation from the upcoming Budget is high as stakeholders anticipate strategic initiatives from the Indian government to accelerate this transition.India's commitment to green energy sector is evident from its ambitious target of achieving 175 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2022, and the more recent goal of achieving 500 GW by 2030. Renewable energy accounts for over 42% of the country's installed power capacity at present with solar and wind energy with the largest share in the green energy mix. However, to sustain this momentum and meet future requirements, a robust policy framework and financial support are imperative.India is the third-largest energy consumer globally and the fourth-largest in renewable energy installed capacity. Many countries are taking aggressive steps to promote green energy. For instance, the US offers tax credits for renewable energy investments, and China has a comprehensive system of subsidies and quotas. In comparison, India's green energy incentives are modest. However, the country's vast market potential and strategic initiatives like the International Solar Alliance (ISA) position it as a significant player in the global arena.Green financing, which helps in aligning financial investments with environmentally friendly projects, has emerged as a crucial factor in enhancing the scope of green energy in India. The issuance of green bonds has been on the rise, with the government and private entities leveraging them to fund environmentally sustainable projects. In FY24, sovereign green bonds of Rs 20,000 crore were issued as against Rs 16,000 crore in FY23. Moreover, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has included renewable energy under priority sector lending, making it easier for businesses to access finance for green projects. The expectation is that Budget 2024 will support these initiatives further by providing additional incentives for green financing.The upcoming Budget is also expected to address several other key areas to bolster green energy growth. Of primary importance is the need to enhance the allocation of funds towards R&D in renewable technologies. Innovation in storage solutions, such as batteries and pumped storage, is particularly crucial to manage the intermittent nature of solar and wind energy. Incentives in forms of Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for such storage solutions will enhance development in the sector.Apart from storage solutions, sharper focus is needed on scaling up the manufacturing capacity for renewable energy equipment within the country. The PLI scheme plays a vital role here too as it incentivizes domestic manufacturing of solar PV modules and has the potential to make India a global hub for renewable energy production. There are expectations of a similar thrust to the bio energy sector, which also holds huge potential in India.Tax incentives are powerful tools to encourage investment in green energy. Expectations are, therefore, high for the government to introduce or enhance tax benefits for producers of renewable energy. The concessional income-tax of 15%, currently under sunset date, should be extended. Additionally, investment-linked tax deductions or accelerated depreciation for development of green energy projects and exemption of income from green bonds could be considered.It is anticipated that rationalisation of rates from GST perspective on renewable energy equipment and services will be announced. Currently, solar modules attract 12% GST, while services related to installation of solar power plants are taxed at 18%. A uniform lower rate would reduce the overall cost of green energy projects. Alternatively, roll-back of GST rate of 5% on solar equipment will assist in reducing project costs significantly.Budget 2024 is highly anticipated as it can catalyse the country's green energy aspirations. By addressing the financial, regulatory, and policy frameworks, it can lay a solid foundation for sustainable growth. Tax incentives, PLI scheme, and developments in green financing are all critical components that need to be strategically enhanced. As India charts its path towards a greener future, the actions taken today will determine the country’s role in the global energy landscape and its success in achieving a sustainable and prosperous economy.(Neetu Vinayek, Tax Leader - Oil & Gas, EY India)",
