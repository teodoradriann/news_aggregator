    "title": "Convicted Rapist Puts Beach Volleyball Under Spotlight At Olympics | IBTimes",
    "text": "Beach volleyball begins at the Paris Olympics on Saturday in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower and with the sport under the spotlight because of the inclusion of a Dutch player convicted of rape.Steven van de Velde was convicted in 2016 of raping an underage girl and sentenced to four years in prison.He served part of his sentence in Britain and was then transferred to the Netherlands, where he was eventually released and took up volleyball again in 2017.The Netherlands' decision to pick the 29-year-old sparked outrage in the lead-up to the Games. He is not staying at the athletes' village, according to Dutch press agency ANP, in order to \"establish calm\".Officials said they would also take the unusual step of isolating him from his teammates during the Games and he has been banned from talking to the media.His selection has drawn criticism from women's and sports safety groups.Australia said they would not pick anyone for the Olympics with a criminal conviction of that nature.Van de Velde will first appear on the sand with teammate Matthew Immers on Sunday, the second day of beach volleyball, when the Netherlands take on an Italian pair.Twenty-four teams start in both the men's and women's events, before being whittled down to 16 for the knockout stages, with the finals taking place on August 9 and 10.Beach volleyball has grown to become one of the most popular events at the Olympics since its inclusion for the first time in 1996.This time, the event will be held at a temporary venue in the heart of the French capital, near the foot of the \"Iron Lady\".\"I don't mind rubbing it into everyone's faces that we are playing at the Eiffel Tower,\" said Taliqua Clancy, silver medallist in Tokyo three years ago with the Australian women's team.\"It's just an absolute wow factor,\" said US women's player Kristen Nuss.The US pair of Miles Partain and Andrew Benesh will kickstart the action against Cuba's Noslen Diaz Amaro and Jorge Luis Alayo Moliner on Saturday, launching a bid to take home America's first men's gold since Beijing in 2008.The US team have high hopes for Chase Budinger, a former NBA competitor who left basketball to become a professional beach volleyball player.Budinger believes his NBA work ethic is an advantage.\"When I switched to beach volleyball I kind of learned that a lot of players choose this as a lifestyle more than a profession,\" he said. \"I really wanted to instil that this is my profession, sport, and treat it that way -- so that means practising five days a week... just doing all the little tangible things that you don't see very often in beach volleyball players.\"The women's tournament also starts on Saturday when China face Tokyo silver medallists Australia.China have never won beach volleyball gold but in Xue Chen and Xia Xinyi they have the top seeds and reigning Asian Games champions.The United States are the current Olympic women's champions, with Norway the men's holders.",

    "text": "Canada’s Public Health Agency is expected to write off $1.2 billion for COVID-19 vaccines that have expired, according to budget documents.\n[said](https://budget.canada.ca/update-miseajour/2024/report-rapport/anx1-en.html).\n“The government expects to record $1.2 billion in 2023-24 for the write-down by the Public Health Agency of Canada of expired COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics,” the documents said, as first reported by Blacklock’s Reporter.\nCanada’s auditor general noted in 2022 that the federal government signed seven contracts with COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers that obliged Ottawa to commit to advance purchase agreements of doses, causing an excess during the pandemic.\n[report](https://www.oag-bvg.gc.ca/internet/English/att__e_44177.html)said. “The agreements ranged from 20 to 76 million total doses. By signing several advance purchase agreements, there were more chances to obtain the sufficient number of vaccines for Canada’s needs, but there was also the possibility that, should all vaccines receive Health Canada’s authorization, Canada would have a surplus of vaccine doses.”\nThe report estimates about 169 million vaccine doses were purchased from December 2020 to May 2022. About 124.9 million of those were delivered to Canada, it said, and the majority of those doses were used to vaccinate Canadians.\nSix of seven COVID-19 vaccines had been authorized for use in Canada, meaning the government was purchasing an excess of stock.\n“With each authorized vaccine came an obligation to purchase a specific quantity of doses,” the auditor general’s office wrote.\nMost of the contracts had the option to purchase additional doses, which the Liberal government did for Pfizer and Moderna, adding to the oversupply, the report said.\n“This led to vaccine wastage as some of the doses expired before they could be used or donated.”\nThe report did not blame the government for the contracts, saying that there had been a high demand for vaccines and it put pressure on global governments to secure agreements.\n“In such an environment, advance payments and obligations for minimum purchase were required. Furthermore, Canada had very limited domestic capacity to produce vaccines and therefore was reliant on international imported products.”\nHowever, the report did hold the Public Health Agency accountable for not minimizing the waste of the vaccine.\n“We also found that minimizing wastage was affected by the agency’s delay in implementing important functionalities of VaccineConnect, the information technology system intended to support planning and managing the COVID‑19 vaccines and decision making around vaccine wastage,” the auditor general’s office wrote.\nOne dose of the vaccine was estimated to cost $30, excluding taxes, according to the report.\n“As a result, at the end of our audit period, the Government of Canada had spent approximately $5 billion on vaccines for the 169 million doses paid for between December 2020 and May 2022,” the report said.\n[directed](https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/provinces-told-to-dispose-of-covid-19-vaccine-stock-ahead-of-new-shots-5718795?ea_src=frontpage&ea_cnt=a&ea_med=latest-news-posts-6)provinces to destroy their inventories of XBB COVID-19 vaccines. These shots targeted the Omicron variant, as opposed to the vaccines targeting the initial variants of the coronavirus.\nThe department told The Epoch Times that it was working on a transition plan with the provinces and territories to switch to updated vaccines.",

    "text": "The Municipal Plaza lighting upgrade supports safer downtown public spaces\nStarting July 4, Calgarians and visitors will see updated lighting in the Municipal Plaza. The need for lighting updates came from a crime prevention through environmental design (CPTED) review that suggested increasing lighting levels of the exterior plaza to meet new building code standards. The upgrades also support the Downtown Safety initiatives to ensure physical design principles are applied to improve real and perceived safety in public spaces.\nThe lighting upgrades work towards our goals of creating a fun and inviting destination for Calgarians to visit, as well as provide the ability to show support for community and city events, as the new light fixtures have also been designed to incorporate some limited ability for coloured accent lighting.\n“We continue to invest in improvements to our existing infrastructure that are responsive to the needs and uses for Calgarians, in ways that are fiscally responsible and environmentally conscious” says Susan Specht, Acting Manager of Building Infrastructure, Facilities.\nThe plaza upgrade project, which included the installation of 20 new lights among other lifecycle activities, was scheduled to align with existing operational funding for lifecycle sustainment and cost nearly $445,000. In the long term, the upgrades will reduce both the operational costs in terms of power usage, lower maintenance costs and service time as the upgrades use higher-efficiency lighting.",

    "title": "Indonesia unveils AI roadmap to lure investors",
    "text": "There’s a global race among countries seeking technological advancement in artificial intelligence, and Indonesia is showing interest in securing a prominent position specifically in the chip supply chain . This competition is particularly taking place with Indonesia’s neighboring countries, which are benchmarks in development and innovation. What can we expect from this new national AI strategy?\nNational strategy for AI growth Indonesia will finish work next month on its first national strategy on artificial intelligence in a bid to attract foreign investment, an official said, as Southeast Asia’s largest economy looks to join the global AI and chip-making race. The move follows neighbouring Malaysia’s push to establish itself as a regional hub for AI development, securing billions of dollars from global tech firms seeking to build critical infrastructure to meet growing demand for cloud and AI services.\nIndonesia’s AI roadmap will be the first comprehensive AI document in the country, the fourth largest in the world by population, since a smaller ethics guideline in 2023, Deputy Minister of Communications and Digital Nezar Patria told Reuters in an interview at his office on Monday. “The roadmap will help AI developers navigate (Indonesia’s market), including on infrastructure and also on computational clusters,” he said, adding that it would detail AI adoption in sectors such as health and agriculture.\nNezar said the roadmap was designed to establish the country’s AI ecosystem . “This will give an idea to investors about the potential of AI use in Indonesia,” he said. “We’re hoping they are interested in investing their capital in Indonesia.” An April report by Boston Consulting Group said ASEAN nations were positioned for substantial AI-driven gains, with GDP contributions ranging from 2.3% to 3.1% by 2027, and Indonesia projected to see the highest impact in terms of absolute gross domestic output growth.\nBeginning of investments in AI Despite having major technology companies operating in the country, such as Microsoft and Nvidia, advances in infrastructure and production capacity are still slow. The country faces the challenge of transforming specific initiatives, such as the development of local businesses, into structured and lasting policies.\nBut despite some investments, development has been slow in Indonesia compared to other parts of the region.NvidiaNVDA.O was involved with Indonesia’s biggest tech company GoTo Gojek Tokopedia GOTO.JK for a large language model service last year, and supplied its chips to the telecommunications company Indosat ISAT.JK.\nMicrosoft MSFT.O also said last year it would invest $1.7 billion over the next few years into expanding cloud services and AI in Indonesia. Separately, Indonesia is also pitching foreign firms on its critical minerals, which are needed for hardware development, in order to secure a bigger share of the global semiconductor supply chain, he added. Indonesia has offered the United States the chance to jointly invest in a critical minerals project as part of its tariff negotiations. Washington has sought to find alternative suppliers to China, which dominates the sector but in April added some rare earths to its export restriction list in retaliation for U.S. tariffs\nThe US’s strategic interest in diversifying its partnerships may align with Indonesia’s plans. Opening this gateway to joint projects strengthens diplomatic ties and may lend more weight to tariff negotiations with other strong economies. Given the US’s recent conflicts with China, Indonesia’s position may be favorable for the production of technological inputs.\nAn integrated effort to lead in Asia Indonesia is now seeking to align politics, economics, and innovation in a unified direction, and with this national artificial intelligence strategy, the country is taking a positive first step toward a promising future . The plan’s success will depend not only on attracting investment but also on ensuring effective implementation, regulatory transparency, and the development of local talent.",

    "text": "¡Y los que faltan! Otra vez se rompe récord de calor en la CDMX La CDMX experimentó uno de los días más calurosos en la última década según el monitoreo de la Comisión Nacional del Agua [Janet Gómez](https://www.reporteindigo.com/author/janet-gomez/) El Servicio Meteorológico Nacional anunció que la Ciudad de México otra vez rompió un récord de calor al superar los 34 grados Celsius, de acuerdo con el monitoreo del Observatorio de Tacubaya. De acuerdo con la dependencia de la Conagua, este jueves se estableció la [temperatura máxima histórica](https://www.reporteindigo.com/reporte/calor-en-cdmx-batio-record-historico-con-mas-de-32-grados-proteccion-civil-emite-alertas/), la cual superó a la máxima registrada el pasado 15 de abril de 34.2 grados. Del mismo modo, el organismo anunció que se estableció un récord para un 9 de mayo, ya que la temperatura máxima se había registrado en un día como hoy pero de 1998 con 33.9 grados. ¿Por qué subió la temperatura en la CDMX? El registro de aumento en las temperaturas en ciertas regiones en el mundo está vinculado al cambio climático, el cual fue provocando un aumento de la temperatura en el planeta debido a una serie de [factores interrelacionados](https://www.reporteindigo.com/reporte/quitar-el-calor-como-ahorrar-en-el-pago-recibo-de-luz/). Uno de los principales impulsores es el aumento de gases de [efecto invernadero en la atmósfera](https://www.reporteindigo.com/reporte/advierte-especialista-de-la-unam-5-olas-de-calor-para-cdmx-con-mas-de-34-grados/), como el dióxido de carbono (CO2), el metano (CH4) y el óxido nitroso (N2O), liberados principalmente por la quema de combustibles fósiles, la deforestación y la agricultura intensiva. Estos gases atrapan el calor del sol en la atmósfera, creando un efecto invernadero que eleva gradualmente la [temperatura global](https://climate.nasa.gov/en-espanol/signos-vitales/temperatura-global/?intent=111). ¿Qué produce una ola de calor? Además, la deforestación y la degradación de los ecosistemas naturales también contribuyen al calentamiento global al reducir la capacidad de absorción de carbono de la Tierra. Otros factores, como la urbanización, el aumento de la actividad industrial y la [emisión de gases contaminantes](https://www.reporteindigo.com/reporte/puestos-comida-callejeros-contaminan-el-aire-ambiental/) también desempeñan un papel significativo en el aumento de la temperatura global. En conjunto, estos procesos están alterando el equilibrio climático del planeta, lo que se traduce en un calentamiento generalizado que tiene impactos profundos en los ecosistemas, el clima regional y la vida humana.",
