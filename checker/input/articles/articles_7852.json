Это выглядит иронично, учитывая, что оригинал всё ещё находится в центре судебного разбирательства Nintendo и The Pokémon Company по делу о нарушении патентов, что уже вынудило авторов изменить часть механик. Palland представляет собой выживание с постройкой базы, сбором ресурсов и простой боевой системой, явно играя на сходстве с Palworld: название, кадры в трейлерах и облик героини выглядят подозрительно знакомо, хотя технически проект заметно скромнее.

Following rumors that suggested Kevin De Bruyne and Ederson might leave the English club, it now seems that one of their biggest stars also wants to depart to secure more playing time.\nDrama in Bordeaux! Historic Girondins Bordeaux Renounces Professional Football Club Status\nJulián Álvarez, formerly of River Plate and World Cup champion, is reportedly considering leaving Manchester City not only to find a club that offers him more game time but also one that meets his expectations in terms of environment, as it is said he is looking for \"a warmer climate.\"\nManchester City's stance is clear: Álvarez will leave if an offer of $77.1 million or more is made. The talented Argentine player has been living in the shadow of Erling Haaland, a forward who has not had the best season with the “Citizens.”\n“We’ll see, I don’t know if at the last moment someone will come for one of our players and they will end up leaving, which would force us to replace those departures,” said Pep Guardiola, which could explain his stance on these rumors.\nWhich club should a player who has practically won everything at 24 years old go to? For now, Julián Álvarez’s focus is on seeking Olympic gold with Argentina.",

El quarterback de segundo año cumplía su primera aparición de inicio por Notre Dame (15).\nReemplazó a Sam Hartman, uno de varios jugadores que decidieron asentarse del encuentro.\n“Éste es un momento que recordaré por el resto de mi vida”, dijo Angeli. “Pero realmente lo que importa no soy yo, sino los chicos que me rodean. Todos estos chicos que han estado en ese vestuario me han nutrido, especialmente Sam Hartman, quien ha hecho un trabajo grandioso para enseñarme cómo se hace esto y permitirme salir con esta oportunidad”.\nFaison, el jugador más valioso del duelo, realizó cinco recepciones para 115 yardas y un touchdown por los Irish (10-3). El corredor Jadarian Price añadió 106 yardas en 13 acarreos con una anotación.\nOregon State (23 con 8-5) finalizó la temporada con una racha de tres derrotas.",

    "text": "A expectativa de Israel aceitar o cessar-fogo durou apenas o tempo do voo de Telavive a Nova Iorque. Ao chegar, Netanyahu dissipou as esperanças, tanto pelas palavras como pelas ações. A pressão vinda dos parceiros de governo mais radicais também contribuiu para essa decisão. \"Durante o voo, aprovei a demissão do chefe da unidade de UAV (Veículos Aéreos Não Tripulados) e outras coisas. A minha política, a nossa política é clara. Continuamos a atacar o Hezbollah com força total\", referiu. As dúvidas, que ainda subsistiam depois das declarações do porta-voz do governo israelita sobre a proposta de cessar-fogo apresentada na véspera por França e Estados Unidos, foram desfeitas. Apesar dos apelos ao cessar-fogo, os Estados Unidos disponibilizaram mais 8,7 mil milhões de dólares em apoio militar a Israel, conforme anunciado pelo secretário de Defesa norte-americano, reiterando o apoio contínuo dos EUA. Na Assembleia Geral da ONU, Mahmoud Abbas, presidente da Autoridade Palestiniana, criticou os três vetos dos Estados Unidos no Conselho de Segurança da ONU relacionados com o cessar-fogo. Abbas afirmou que Israel deve deixar os territórios ocupados e que os Estados Unidos precisam de parar de fornecer armas a Israel. O líder palestiniano também se disse pronto para assumir o controlo das fronteiras de Gaza e realizar eleições.",

    "text": "Former Cowboys Still Alive in NFL Playoffs\nOklahoma State has some players still in the hunt for a Super Bowl ring.\nOver the weekend, the NFL Wild Card round took place and eliminated three teams from the playoffs in each conference. That leaves eight teams across the league left to compete for a title going into the divisional round.\nAlthough OSU football hasn’t had a game in a month and a half, OSU fans still have some clear rooting interests in the professional world. Of the handfuls of former Cowboys in the NFL, three remain in the NFL playoff race.\nA fan favorite for the Cowboys, Malcolm Rodriguez, still has an opportunity to win the championship with the NFC’s top-seeded Detroit Lions. However, he suffered a torn ACL on Thanksgiving and will be out for the Lions’ playoff run.\nRodriguez’s unfortunate injury leaves only two Cowboys left available in the postseason, and they could make a run at the title as well. Both of OSU’s active players in the NFL are on the Baltimore Ravens and could form a dangerous offensive duo.\nFormer Cowboy stars Justice Hill and Tylan Wallace have contributed to the Ravens throughout this season and helped them become one of the top teams in the league. Alongside likely MVP Lamar Jackson, Hill and Wallace could have enough to get to the Super Bowl.\nIn the Wild Card matchup against the Pittsburgh Steelers, both players made contributions. Hill had six rushes for 12 yards and another four catches for 13 yards, including a 5-yard touchdown catch in the final moments of the first half to push his team’s lead to 21-0. Meanwhile, Wallace made one catch for 21 yards to help set up a third-quarter touchdown in the victory.\nIn the late 2010s, Hill and Wallace were instrumental pieces of the OSU offense and are remembered as some of the top talents who traveled through Stillwater in recent history. So, it’s no surprise those two are still in the mix going into the Divisional round and have a chance to be the next Cowboys to earn Super Bowl rings.\nThe Ravens will continue their playoff journey on Sunday at the Buffalo Bills. Meanwhile, the Lions, with Rodriguez on the sidelines, will host the Washington Commanders on Saturday.\nWant to join the discussion?
