    "text": "Ramadan: What happens during Laylat al-Qadr and the last 10 nights? More about the holy month [Mariyam Muhammad](https://www.cincinnati.com/staff/72841210007/mariyam-muhammad/) [Ramadan began](/story/news/2024/03/07/when-is-ramadan-2024-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-holy-month/72877705007/) on the night of March 10. Muslims worldwide celebrate the holy month of fasting with spiritual cleansing, self-reflection, acts of kindness and avoiding wrongdoings. Two-thirds of Ramadan have flown by, and the night of March 30 signifies the beginning of the [final 10 nights of Ramadan](https://www.islamchannel.tv/blog-posts/why-are-the-last-ten-days-of-ramadan-so-important). During one of these nights comes a special night — Laylat al-Qadr. Why are the final days of Ramadan so important? How will Muslims worship leading up to Eid al-Fitr? Here's what to know. Ramadan: [How long do Muslims in Ohio fast? When do Muslims break their fast?](/story/news/2024/03/13/ramadan-when-muslims-break-fast/72955873007/) What is Laylat al-Qadr? [Laylat al-Qadr](https://www.middleeasteye.net/discover/islam-laylat-qadr-night-power-holiest-night-explained) means ‘the night of decree’ in Arabic. This night signifies when the Holy Quran was revealed to Prophet Muhammad. Laylat al-Qadr is one of the most sacred nights on the Islamic calendar. It only occurs during Ramadan, and will last one night from sunset to sunrise. This divine night falls sometime during the last 10 nights of Ramadan. When does Laylat al-Qadr happen during Ramadan? There is never a definite date for when Laylat al-Qadr occurs, but it is believed to fall during an odd-numbered night during the last 10 nights of Ramadan, with the odd-numbered nights being measured from the holy month's starting day. Laylat al-Qadr is sometimes predicted to be on the 27th night of Ramadan. According to scholars, some signs of Laylat al-Qadr are feelings of tranquility, a comfortable breeze in the air, and the sun will rise without rays the following morning. What is the significance of Laylat al-Qadr? The Quran was revealed to Prophet Muhammad through Angel Gabriel this night. The Quran is the direct word of God and contains moral code, spiritual guidance, and prophetic narratives. Qadr, in Arabic, literally translates to ‘destiny’ or ‘decree’. In the Quran, it says a night of worship during Laylat al-Qadr is equivalent to a thousand nights of worship — any acts of worship performed on this night carries greater reward than on any other day. It is believed that Muslims can change their fate and what was written for them by God through prayer and supplication. How do Muslims worship during the last 10 nights of Ramadan? Because no one knows which day Laylat al-Qadr falls on, Muslims are encouraged to take advantage of every night during the final one-third of Ramadan. The last 10 nights are said to be overflowing with God’s mercy and forgiveness. Ramadan: [Muslims will feast after breaking fast at suhoor festivals in Ohio this weekend](/story/news/2024/03/28/ohio-muslims-ramadan-suhoor-festivals-weekend/73121358007/) Everyday Ramadan rituals remain, such as fasting, reading the Quran, and taraweeh (special Ramadan night prayers). Muslims will spend a lot of time focusing on more worship and repentance, and will spend entire nights praying instead of sleeping. Muslims also perform i’tikaf during these last 10 nights, which is the act of spending days and nights in a mosque to perform devout worship. Muslims will use these nights to ask for forgiveness for previous sins, and pray for what they want in this world and the next. Generosity is heavily encouraged during the last 10 nights. This is called sadaqah, or voluntary charity, and can be in many forms, such as feeding someone a meal, donating to charity, performing a good deed, or doing an act of kindness.",

    "text": "春暖花开，正是出门活动的好时候。为了让居民们更加方便地运动，近年来，越来越多的城市“见缝插针”地利用各种边角地、闲置地改造成居民们的运动角、生活角。比如，高架桥下建起了篮球场、社区夹缝中出现了口袋公园、废弃厂房改造成了健身场所等等。这些城市空间的改造虽然微小，却和提升群众生活幸福感息息相关。在深圳市，无论是地铁站还是工厂的楼顶，空间都被尽可能地利用起来改造成了运动场所。\n地铁站里打羽毛球 通勤运动两不误\n在深圳市黄木岗地铁站的负一层，这三块羽毛球场地是上班族们经常光顾的地方。不用出地铁，就可以约上同事朋友挥拍打球。\n市民 孙先生：你路上的时间节省了就可以再多打半个小时，现在可能一周能打到四五次了。而且地铁站里很宽敞很舒服，这个形式还挺不错的。\n这家运动馆是深圳市首个地铁站内的运动馆，这处空间原本是负一层出行通道交会的闲置区域。去年10月底，深圳地铁将这片长120米、宽28米的廊道转化为可容纳三块羽毛球场加两块网球发球练习场的复合运动区。这种“地铁+运动”的模式，正好满足了上班族想用碎片化时间健身的需求。\n黄木岗地铁站运动场馆工作人员 何娉婷：通过线上问卷以及走进周边社区和居民面对面交谈这种方式，我们发现周边的居民对羽毛球就特别感兴趣，哪怕是小区楼下的一小片空地他们都可以打起来，因此我们就果断增设了三片羽毛球场。\n地铁站里的球馆不仅交通方便，还不受天气影响。在采光上，球馆利用地铁站原本的中庭天窗结构，场地80%的日间照明可以依赖自然光。这种空间改造模式不仅迎来了客流，还大大节省了场馆的建设成本。目前，这家运动场馆营业时间是早上8时至晚上10时，羽毛球场的日均订场率接近90%。\n市区寸土寸金 在房顶上想办法\n00:00\n03:08\n蓝光\n03:08\n确认 取消\n蓝光\n超清\n高清\n流畅\n继续播放\n当前非Wi-Fi网络，继续播放将产生流量费用\n除了在地铁站内想办法，房顶也存在着很多可以利用的边角空间，特别是像深圳这样寸土寸金的地方，向天空要空间可以大幅度提高土地资源的利用效率。在福田区和光明区，一些体育运动场所就建在了这样的房顶空间上。\n福田区是深圳市的中心城区，这个占地7.6万平方米的生态体育公园就建在福田水质净化厂的屋顶上。在寸土寸金的福田区，想要找到一块面积较大的足球场并不容易。而这个屋顶上的运动公园，建成了2个标准足球场、4个8人足球场和2个5人足球场。“屋顶踢球、屋内处理污水”的巧妙设计让这块地“见缝插绿”，把更多的城市空间还给了市民。\n市民 平先生：我觉得足球是一个很好的运动，小孩子可以锻炼自己的身体，可以交朋友。在学习之余也是一个很好的放松方式。\n市民 付先生：其实老人都还挺喜欢来，这里感觉比较舒畅。\n据了解，自2021年9月11日这个生态体育公园正式开园以来，“屋顶上的足球场”累计接待市民超300万人次，先后举办足球赛、全民健身节等赛事活动约1700场次。\n深圳市福田区文化广电旅游体育局工作人员 傅东阳：我们现在提倡利用城市空间的“金边银角”闲置空间，向公园、楼宇、学校、市政设施要空间，我们叫发挥空间潜力突破建设思维，来解决市民群众“健身去哪儿”的问题。\n污水处理厂的屋顶变身足球场，而在光明区，深圳地铁在6号线长圳车辆段的地铁列车检修库楼顶建成了一座运动中心，它夹在小区居民楼和企业员工宿舍的缝隙中，有三块网球场地和三块篮球场地。\n市民 王先生：原来没有运动场，去外面比较远比较麻烦，所以一直没有运动。自从这边运动场开业后，比较方便，然后就一个星期运动两次这样子。\n记者从深圳市住房和建设局了解到，深圳市拥有约2亿平方米的屋顶存量空间，这为城市进一步挖掘空间立体复合使用、拓展文体活动空间等提供了巨大的潜力空间资源。对此，深圳市还印发了《深圳市城市第六立面提升设计导则》，所谓“第六立面”，主要包括建筑屋顶、立面、周边场地、开放空间等元素，提升第六立面，是多元化探索城市空间的一种方式。\n深圳市城市规划设计研究院二所副所长 李理：我们叫作第六立面提升计划，在去年其实就已经完成了首批试点，大概有20个片区，我们做这些事情也是有利于生态，有利于我们城市文化的延续，也有利于我们产业经济的这样蓬勃的发展，探索一种更先进的城市文明的这样的一种路径。",

In an interview with the media, Keidanren Chairman Tokura expressed his intention to work to achieve better results than last year. In an interview with the media at the beginning of the year, Keidanren Chairman Tokura said, \"The enthusiasm and enthusiasm for the spring training are not inferior to last year's, so it is desirable that the outcomes and results are naturally higher,\" and expressed his intention to work to achieve better results than last year. In addition, he reiterated the importance of continuous wage increases, saying, \"A virtuous cycle of wages and prices will not occur unless we continue not only this year but also next year.\" On the other hand, Mr. Sina, Representative Secretary of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives, said in an interview with the media that raising the national average minimum wage to 2000,2000 yen should lead to the realization of structural wage increases. In addition, he said, \"If we aim for an economy where the minimum wage is , yen, the way we proceed will change, such as using digital technology more effectively,\" and expressed his recognition that companies will be required to respond on the premise of wage increases.",

    "text": "As we stand on the threshold of another new year, some look back wistfully at the past year. Most of us would probably say the year has been one of mixed blessings, with some successes interlaced with some failures. For others, it was a year of “what might have been.” There are things we wish we had done differently—things we probably regretted saying and doing. Regardless of where we direct our thoughts, one thing is clear: we cannot go back in time and change anything that was or was not done. In his reflection on time, American poet and educator Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (1807–1882) writes, “Look not mournfully into the past. It comes not back again. Wisely improve the present. It is thine. Go forth to meet the shadowy future, without fear.” However, centuries before, Isaiah spoke words to the same effect to the nation of Israel: “Thus says the LORD… remember not the former things, nor consider the things of old. Behold, I am doing a new thing; now it springs forth, do you not perceive it? I will make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert” (Isaiah 43: [16a](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+43%3A16&version=ESV), [18–19, ESV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+43%3A18-19&version=ESV)). Reflecting on the past can sometimes lead to a state of complacency. We can become thoroughly satisfied with our successes or mentally and emotionally crippled by our failures. Excessive focus on the past can hinder our ability to move forward promptly and efficiently. The rearview mirror in vehicles is smaller than the windshield for a specific purpose. We occasionally cast a glance behind, but our primary focus is directed forward. While there are important lessons we can and should learn from our experiences, let us not camp out around those experiences. The present and the future are calling us to action. What are some of the things God wants us to “forget”? Our failures, losses, sorrows, and sufferings; associations and traditions that hindered His working in our lives; the focus on ourselves; past accomplishments that would distract us from giving Him glory, to name a few. As we stand on the threshold of a new year, God stands poised yet again to do new things that shall “spring forth.” If 2023 has been a year of failure and broken dreams, 2024 can be the opposite; if it was successful, there are more victories to be celebrated. We serve an awesome God to whom nothing is impossible ( [Jeremiah 32:26–27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah+32%3A26%E2%80%9327&version=ESV); [Matthew 19:26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+19%3A26&version=ESV)). Let us take God at His word and start moving beyond the past. Forgetting the former things and looking forward to the “new thing” He will be doing in our hearts and lives. It is my prayer that He surprises you and me in ways far beyond anything we could ever ask or think ( [Ephesians 3:20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+3%3A20&version=ESV)), and I pray that especially for you and yours for this New Year. He is faithful, as He promised ( [Hebrews 10:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+10%3A23&version=ESV)).",

    "text": "经济观察网讯 当地时间6月18日，央视记者获悉，美联储官员预计未来几个月美国通胀情况将恶化，但仍预计在2025年年底前将降息两次，与3月份的预测一致。\n美联储预计，相比于3月份的预测，到2025年年底美国经济增长将明显放缓，通胀将上升，失业率将略有上升。美联储官员预计，美国通胀率到2025年年底将升至3%，失业率将升至4.5%，经济增长率将放缓至1.4%。\n美联储主席鲍威尔当日警告称，不要过分相信美联储的利率预测，因为预测可能会根据公布的数据而发生变化，尤其是通胀数据。鲍威尔在美联储政策会议后的新闻发布会上表示，没有人对这些利率预测抱有绝对的信心，这些都将取决于数据。\n18日，美国联邦储备委员会结束为期两天的货币政策会议，宣布将联邦基金利率目标区间维持在4.25%至4.50%之间不变。这是美联储货币政策会议连续第四次决定维持利率不变。",
