However, it is also susceptible to several natural hazards that can pose significant threats to the lives and livelihoods of its people. The three major hazards affecting the Caribbean are hurricanes, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions.\n1. Hurricanes\nThe Caribbean is located in the Atlantic hurricane basin, making it highly susceptible to hurricanes. These powerful storms can cause widespread destruction, with strong winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges that can result in flooding, landslides, and infrastructure damage. The hurricane season in the Caribbean typically runs from June to November, with the peak activity occurring between August and October. Over the past decades, the region has witnessed devastating hurricanes like Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria, highlighting the urgent need for preparedness and mitigation measures.\n2. Earthquakes\nThe Caribbean sits on several tectonic plate boundaries, making it vulnerable to earthquakes. These seismic events occur due to the movement of these plates, resulting in shaking of the ground. While the region is not as seismically active as some other parts of the world, earthquakes can still cause significant damage and pose risks to buildings, infrastructure, and human lives. The most seismically active areas in the Caribbean include the countries along the Eastern Caribbean Arc, such as Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Dominica.\n3. Volcanic Eruptions\nThe Caribbean is home to several volcanic islands, including Montserrat, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Dominica. These volcanoes, although mostly dormant, can occasionally erupt, posing hazards to nearby communities. Volcanic eruptions can release ash clouds, pyroclastic flows, and lahars, which can cause severe damage to infrastructure, agriculture, and the environment. The eruption of the Soufrière Hills Volcano in Montserrat during the 1990s and early 2000s serves as a reminder of the potential dangers volcanic activity can pose.\nFrequently Asked Questions about the hazards affecting the Caribbean:\n1. How can individuals prepare for hurricanes in the Caribbean?\nPreparing for hurricanes in the Caribbean involves creating an emergency plan, stocking up on supplies, and staying informed about weather updates and evacuation orders. It is also important to secure your property and have a reliable communication plan in place.\n2. Are there warning systems in place for earthquakes in the Caribbean?\nYes, many countries in the Caribbean have implemented earthquake early warning systems to detect seismic activity and provide alerts to the public. These systems aim to give people a few seconds to minutes of warning before the shaking reaches their location.\n3. What are the long-term effects of volcanic eruptions in the Caribbean?\nVolcanic eruptions can have long-lasting effects on the affected areas. These include the destruction of infrastructure, displacement of communities, environmental damage, and potential health issues due to ashfall and respiratory problems. Recovery and rebuilding efforts can take years or even decades.\n4. How does climate change impact the frequency and intensity of hurricanes in the Caribbean?\nClimate change is believed to contribute to the increased frequency and intensity of hurricanes in the Caribbean. Warmer sea surface temperatures provide more energy for hurricanes, leading to potential stronger storms. Additionally, changes in atmospheric patterns and moisture content can influence hurricane formation and behavior.\n5. Are there any evacuation plans in place for volcanic eruptions in the Caribbean?\nYes, many volcanic-prone islands in the Caribbean have established evacuation plans to ensure the safety of residents and visitors in the event of a volcanic eruption. These plans involve identifying safe zones, setting up emergency shelters, and coordinating transportation for evacuees.\n6. How do communities recover after a major natural disaster in the Caribbean?\nRecovery after a major natural disaster in the Caribbean involves a combination of local, national, and international efforts. It includes rebuilding infrastructure, restoring basic services, providing assistance to affected communities, and implementing disaster risk reduction measures to enhance resilience.\n7. Are there any measures in place to reduce the impact of earthquakes in the Caribbean?\nCountries in the Caribbean have been working towards improving building codes and standards to ensure better earthquake resistance. Public education and awareness campaigns are also conducted to promote earthquake safety measures, such as drop, cover, and hold on during an earthquake.\n8. Can volcanic eruptions in the Caribbean be predicted?\nVolcanic eruptions cannot be predicted with absolute certainty. However, monitoring systems, such as seismometers and gas sensors, can provide valuable data and indicators of volcanic activity, which can enable scientists to make informed assessments and issue warnings.\n9. How do the hazards in the Caribbean affect the tourism industry?\nThe hazards in the Caribbean can have a significant impact on the tourism industry. Hurricanes, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions can disrupt travel plans, damage infrastructure, and affect the perception of safety in the region. However, many tourism-dependent countries have implemented measures to enhance resilience and recover quickly from such events.\n10. What role does international collaboration play in mitigating the hazards in the Caribbean?\nInternational collaboration plays a crucial role in mitigating the hazards in the Caribbean. It includes sharing knowledge, expertise, and resources among countries and organizations to develop and implement effective disaster risk reduction strategies, improve early warning systems, and provide humanitarian aid and assistance during and after disasters.",

    "text": "The Telegraph Richard Rampton, legendary libel lawyer who took on the Holocaust denier David Irving – obituary Read full article Telegraph Obituaries 29 December 2023 at 11:00 pm · 9-min read Richard Rampton, QC, pictured in 1987 - TopFoto\nRichard Rampton, KC, who has died aged 82, was widely regarded as one of the greatest defamation lawyers of his generation; a deceptively avuncular yet formidably incisive advocate, he was also a leading authority on libel law as co-author of the seminal textbook on the subject, Duncan and Neill on Defamation.\nIn courtroom exchanges he invariably proved himself better versed than opponents and judges and for many years he was the go-to barrister for both plaintiffs and defendants.\nThe many famous libel trials in which Rampton appeared included Lord Aldington vs Count Nikolai Tolstoy (1989); Andrew Neil vs Peregrine Worsthorne (1990); Gillian Taylforth vs News of the World (1994); the so-called “McLibel” trial (1997, the longest libel case in English legal history, involving McDonald’s and two environmental activists); and George Galloway vs The Daily Telegraph (2004).\nBut the most dramatic and emotive of all his cases was Irving vs Penguin Books and Lipstadt (2000), in which Rampton defended the Jewish American academic Deborah Lipstadt and her publishers against David Irving’s assertion that she had libelled him in her book Denying the Holocaust (1993).\nLipstadt had described the British self-taught historian of Nazi Germany as “one of the most dangerous spokespersons for Holocaust denial”, accusing him of bending historical evidence to suit his neo-fascist purposes, and of seeking to exonerate Hitler from responsibility for the Final Solution, and denying the existence of the gas chambers.\nRichard Rampton leaving court in 1996 during the 'McLibel trial', the longest libel case in English legal history - PETER ORME English libel law is heavily weighted in favour of the plaintiff, who does not have to show that what was written was either false or malicious, so for corporate defendants especially there is often a strong temptation to settle, which Irving gave Penguin the option to do for £500 and an apology.\nBut, instructed by Penguin’s solicitor Anthony Julius, Rampton ensured that the publishers not only stood firm and fought the case but that they also used the perilous defence of justification, insisting that what Lipstadt had written was the plain truth. As he said in his opening remarks: “My Lord, Mr Irving calls himself a historian. The truth is, however, that he is not a historian at all but a falsifier of history. To put it bluntly, he is a liar.”\nStory continues The preparation for the trial took Rampton two years and involved, among other things, his learning the history of the Third Reich, and also to read German so that so he could not be outwitted by Irving on the source material.\nBy day one of the trial, Rampton felt as confident of victory as he had ever been, recalling: “I don’t think I’ve ever gone into court with such a beltful of bullets.”\nDavid Irving arrives at the High Court in April 2000 to hear the verdict in his libel case - MARTYN HAYHOW The defence team’s historians had found more than 30 major historical falsifications in Irving’s books, “which could only have been deliberate”, said Rampton, “and which all converged in the same direction – the exoneration of Hitler, and eventually Holocaust denial”.\nThe ammunition that Rampton used to devastating effect also included the fact that Irving had regaled far-Right gatherings with a “joke” about a one-man gas chamber mistaken for a telephone booth, and a poem that he had written in his personal diary in 1994 and sung to his nine-month-old daughter: “I am a Baby Aryan / Not Jewish or Sectarian / I have no plans to marry an / Ape or Rastafarian.”\n“Racist, Mr Irving?” Rampton asked after reading out the poem. “Anti-Semitic, Mr Irving?”\n“I don’t think so,” replied Irving.\n“Teaching your little child this kind of poison?” asked Rampton.\n“Do you think a nine-month-old can understand?” said Irving.\n“This poor little child is being taught a racist ditty by her perverted, racist father,” replied Rampton.\nAfter several weeks the judge, Mr Justice Gray , handed complete victory to Lipstadt and Penguin, deciding that Irving had “for his own ideological reasons persistently and deliberately misrepresented and manipulated historical evidence”. After the judgment, Irving approached Rampton to shake his hand, but as Rampton explained later, he found that he could not: “It wasn’t a game of tennis.”\nThe case was seen as extremely important for Jewish communities around the world, its significance reflected in the fact that it gave rise to three separate non-fiction books and some years later a film, Denial (2016), scripted by David Hare and directed by Mike Jackson. Rampton was played by the actor Tom Wilkinson, who brilliantly captured everything from the manner in which he walked to the way in which he smoked his Gitanes cigarettes, and the forensic and authoritative manner in which he conducted himself in court – refusing for instance to look Irving in the eye in order to better “get under his skin”.\nTom Wilkinson as Richard Rampton in the 2016 film Denial - Laurie Sparham As Rampton’s son, the journalist James Rampton, wrote later: “Even the way Wilkinson opens a very agreeable bottle of red over lunch and delivers the line ‘a famous Attorney-General once told me that one becomes a much more effective advocate after a few glasses of claret’ is eerily reminiscent of him.”\nJohn Richard Anthony Rampton was born on January 8 1941, the eldest of four children of the businessman and philanthropist Anthony Rampton, who was away in India for much of the war and on his return intended to become a barrister. His wife was Joan, née Shanks.\nBut he was persuaded instead to join Freemans, the mail-order company established by his grandfather, and was so successful in this venture that when Freemans went public in 1963, he and his wife worried that their new wealth might unsettle their lives and corrupt their children. Their solution was to divert much of it to the charitable Hilden Trust, which to this day dispenses grants to a variety of unfashionable causes.\nRichard Rampton was educated at Bryanston, where he was an accomplished clarinettist and actor, bowled off-spin in the cricket XI and was a notably quick centre in the rugby XV. He later read Greats at Queen’s College, Oxford.\nRichard Rampton with Lord Windlesham, whom he assisted with his independent inquiry into the programme Death on the Rock, about the SAS’s shooting in Gibraltar in 1988 of three IRA members - PA Called to the Bar by Inner Temple in 1965, Rampton joined the leading libel set at 1 Brick Court in the Temple, and within a few years he was the most sought-after junior defamation counsel at the Bar. He was known as a fearless and extraordinarily succinct advocate with a powerful intellect, highly persuasive with both judges and juries.\nHe regularly acted for Associated Newspapers, and in 1976 he was junior counsel for James Goldsmith in his long-running libel action – eventually settled – against Private Eye, which had accused him of conspiring to obstruct the course of justice in relation to his friend Lord Lucan.\nIn 1988 he won “substantial” though undisclosed damages for Robert Maxwell for “a devastating catalogue of libels” in a biography.\nRampton assisted Lord Windlesham in his independent inquiry into the programme “Death on the Rock”, an investigation by This Week into the SAS’s shooting in Gibraltar in March 1988 of three members of an IRA active service unit. The programme had incensed government ministers by suggesting that the military’s account of events was untruthful and that the three might have been unlawfully killed. Margaret Thatcher condemned it as “trial by television” and a propaganda coup for the IRA.\nThe Foreign Office and Ministry of Defence complained of 39 serious inaccuracies in the programme, and when Windlesham and Rampton’s report found only three minor flaws, the government turned on them, issuing a 17-page dossier of rebuttal, although they won the support of the Independent Broadcasting Authority.\nThe same year Rampton defended Count Nikolai Tolstoy, who had compared Lord Aldington to “the worst butchers of Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia” for issuing the orders that resulted in the massacre of 70,000 Cossacks and anti-Tito Yugoslavs handed over to Tito’s forces in 1945.\nThe case resulted in an award of £1.5 million libel damages to Aldington, three times more than any previous libel award, although not a penny was paid by Tolstoy, who promptly declared himself bankrupt.\nRampton returned to winning ways the next year, helping Andrew Neil, then editor of The Sunday Times, to secure libel damages against Peregrine Worsthorne over a “hurtful” article in The Sunday Telegraph suggesting that he knew Pamela Bordes was a prostitute when he began an affair with her.\nRampton acted successfully for McDonald's against Dave Morris and Helen Steel - LYNNE SLADKY He was also victorious when acting for McDonald’s in its 10-year case against two “eco-warriors” whose claims that McDonald’s was responsible for starvation and deforestation the judge deemed to be false and libellous. And he successfully represented politician George Galloway against The Daily Telegraph over allegations that he took £375,000 from Saddam Hussein ’s Iraqi regime.\nDespite his professional pre-eminence, Rampton was never remotely pompous or pleased with himself. He always maintained a healthy balance between hard work and having fun. Arduous weeks of case preparation would be regularly interrupted by good lunches and games of corridor cricket.\nFor many summers he played in his chambers’ cricket team, the Brickbats. He was very knowledgeable about Mozart and considered writing a book about him, built up an impressive collection of fine wine in the cellar he made in his garage, and was a passionate fly fisherman on the River Itchen in Hampshire.\nMindful of his own good fortune, he was privately generous, regularly offering financial help to those less well-off than himself, besides the many grants that he helped distribute as a trustee of his family’s charitable trust.\nRichard Rampton married, in 1963, Carolyn Clarke. She survives him, along with their sons James and Patrick, and daughter Catherine.\nRichard Rampton, born January 8 1941, died December 23 2023\nTRENDING Davina McCall stormed off Masked Singer after close friend was unmasked Yahoo TV UK · 2-min read Ant and Dec 'almost bankrupt' ITV with Limitless Win Yahoo TV UK · 4-min read Man arrested after images show vehicle going 180mph on M4 PA Media: UK News · 1-min read 'Sudden stratospheric warming' forecast to hit northern Europe in January - but experts unsure where it will strike Sky News · 3-min read Protest at Catholic girls school a sign of ‘deeper malaise’ in Northern Ireland PA Media: UK News · 4-min read",

    "text": "By Sarah Reinsel\nWant to help thousands of LCMS youth and adults have a safe and enjoyable time at the 2025 LCMS Youth Gathering? Applications to serve as a Gathering Ambassador are due March 15.\nIn this essential role, volunteers serve as a trusted guide for all Gathering participants. Gathering Ambassadors are on the ground everywhere during the week to answer questions, help participants navigate events and activities, and ensure everyone is safe and able to make the most of the experience.\nMost importantly, “volunteers are making an opportunity for youth to grow in their faith,” said DCE Melissa Luepke, who manages Gathering Ambassadors.\n“We’re looking for servant leaders who want to make a difference for Jesus. This is a great way to be a part of the Gathering and to serve the church at large.”\nHighly visible in their yellow T-shirts, Gathering Ambassadors are stationed wherever official Gathering events are happening — in hotels, at the convention center, working the interactive floor and helping direct traffic at stadium events.\nGathering Ambassadors are LCMS church workers or laypeople. Any adult age 26 or older is invited to apply.\nGathering Ambassadors come to the Gathering for training a few days before it begins and then serve for the duration of the week. Once their application is accepted, Gathering Ambassadors pay a volunteer registration fee of $400, which goes toward travel, hotels and meals.\nAn event as big as the Gathering would not be possible without the help of the small army of volunteers who give of their time and talent to be servant leaders for a week.\nLuepke, who went to her first Gathering as a youth in 1992, has attended 11 more Gatherings since then. She emphasized how formative this week is for youth as they spend time in God’s Word and grow in their faith.\n“There is such power in seeing the Body of Christ come together in such a big way,” said Luepke.\nTo apply to be a Gathering Ambassador, visit\nlcmsgathering.com/volunteer.\nPosted Feb. 29, 2024",

Por ello, ha pedido consultar el estado del tiempo y de las carreteras si se va a emprender un viaje.\nDel Campo ha explicado que la situación más complicada de este viernes estará en el suroeste peninsular. En concreto, Huelva (Andalucía) registrará chubascos muy fuertes y podrá superar los 40 litros por metro cuadrado (l/m2). A su vez, también caerán probablemente chubascos fuertes en otras zonas de Andalucía occidental y sur de Extremadura.\nAdemás, ha añadido que la situación seguirá siendo complicada en el área mediterránea, en el sur de Cataluña especialmente y en el norte de la Comunidad Valenciana. Allí, los chubascos podrán ser persistentes y los acumulados podrán superar los 100 l/m2. Esto puede provocar de nuevo crecidas en cauces e inundaciones en zonas bajas, por lo que el portavoz de AEMET ha recomendado alejarse de este tipo de zonas.\nA su vez, ha advertido sobre el clima en Baleares durante la jornada de mañana. En las islas, las lluvias podrán ser muy intensas y podrán dejar 50 l/m2 en sólo una hora o incluso 120 l/m2 en unas pocos horas. Al igual que en el caso de la Comunidad Valenciana, Del Campo ha pedido precaución en el archipiélago, dado que también pueden producirse crecidas e inundaciones en zonas bajas.\nEl sábado continuará la inestabilidad con chubascos de nuevo fuertes y persistentes en el sur de Cataluña, en la Comunidad Valenciana y de nuevo en el archipiélago Balear. De forma más débil, se podrán registrar en puntos del tercio sur de la península.\nEl portavoz de AEMET ha avanzado que la tendencia para el domingo y el lunes es la de que la DANA vaya desapareciendo y que la situación sea más estable. Aún así, ha indicado que todavía se producirán chubascos en el Levante, en Cataluña, en el área del Estrecho y en Baleares. Estos podrán ser fuertes aún durante el lunes, en especial en el sur de Cataluña, en la Comunidad Valenciana y en el sur de Aragón.\nDe cara al martes y días siguientes probablemente se dará una situación más estable en todo el país, aunque a día de hoy, Del Campo no descarta posibles chubascos, una vez más, en el área Mediterránea. Todo esto estará acompañado con unas temperaturas que no van a variar demasiado y que serán en general algo más cálidas de lo habitual para esta época del año.",

    "text": "Jornada federal de lucha por la universidad pública: paro y protestas en el país\nEsta tarde habrá movilizaciones, clases públicas y un paro docente de 48 horas en defensa del sistema universitario.\nEste jueves 26 de junio comienza una nueva jornada nacional de lucha universitaria. Docentes, no docentes, estudiantes y autoridades de las 61 universidades públicas del país convocaron a protestas en todo el territorio en reclamo de una solución urgente a la crisis presupuestaria que atraviesa el sistema. Además, se inicia un paro de 48 horas impulsado por las principales federaciones docentes del país: Conadu y Conadu Histórica.\nEn la Ciudad de Buenos Aires, la jornada comenzará con un abrazo simbólico al Hospital de Clínicas a las 10 de la mañana. Más tarde, a las 17, se realizará una marcha de antorchas desde Plaza Houssay hasta el Palacio Pizzurno. Desde el Consejo Interuniversitario Nacional (CIN) exigieron la aprobación de la Ley de Financiamiento Universitario, presentada el 28 de mayo. “Si no hay una solución, el sistema puede colapsar”, advirtió su presidente, Oscar Alpa. Además, se impulsa una campaña para reunir un millón de firmas en apoyo al proyecto.\nRepresentantes de la comunidad universitaria insisten en que la falta de presupuesto, los bajos salarios y la paralización de obras ponen en riesgo la continuidad del sistema.",

    "text": "Tim Bontemps, ESPN Dec 28, 2023, 10:24 PM ET Email BOSTON -- When the Detroit Pistons entered the visiting locker room at halftime of Thursday night's matchup with the Boston Celtics , it looked like the Pistons had a chance to not only shock the basketball world but avoid landing in a dubious place in the history books in the process.\nDetroit, a 16.5-point underdog after losing 27 consecutive games, found itself leading Boston -- the NBA's best team with a perfect 14-0 record at TD Garden -- by 19 points.\nThen the second half began. And as quickly as Detroit had taken control of the game, Boston surged right back into it. By the end of the third quarter, the Celtics had erased that halftime deficit. And despite the Pistons fighting back valiantly to force overtime, ultimately it was Boston that would claim a 128-122 victory .\nWith the defeat, the Pistons tied the 76ers for the longest overall losing streak, which Philadelphia set across the end of the 2014-15 season and the beginning of the 2015-16 campaign with 28 consecutive losses. The Pistons can set a new record for futility on Saturday, when they face the Toronto Raptors back home in Detroit.\nEditor's Picks Pistons' 27-game losing streak now tops NBA's longest single-season droughts 2d Kalan Hooks Pistons set NBA record with 27th straight loss 2d Eric Woodyard NBA Power Rankings: Luka, Mavs impress in West; Celtics still the team to beat 2d ESPN 2 Related \"I just told them that it takes a lot of character and integrity to do what they're doing,\" said Pistons coach Monty Williams. \"I've been in the league for a while, and I've seen teams give into circumstances that are less than what we're dealing with. That was admirable; obviously, we had a tough third quarter, and the ability to fight back and have it even in the fourth was tremendous.\n\"I hurt for them. We feel like we're just getting so close to not just winning one game but winning a lot of games if we play that way.\"\nFor much of the contest, it looked like the 2-29 Pistons would finally get back in the win column. Boston (24-6), back home after winning the final three games of a four-game West Coast swing, appeared to do exactly what Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla warned of before the game: taking its struggling opponent lightly.\n\"I think just the expectation of it's supposed to go a certain way or it's supposed to be easy,\" Mazzulla said when asked what the challenge was in facing a team in Detroit's position. \"It's just not the case.\n\"It's another game, regardless of the other team's record. And I think sometimes you get caught up in -- because it's this team, we should be up by this amount at first quarter, halftime -- and it's just not how it works.\"\nIt certainly wasn't how it worked Thursday, as Mazzulla's players went out and promptly looked like a team expecting to sleepwalk its way to a victory.\nInstead, Boston found itself in a dogfight with Detroit that extended into an extra five minutes after Pistons forward Bojan Bogdanovic tied the score with a putback with 4.6 seconds remaining in regulation. Eventually, though, Boston was able to pull away in overtime, as Kristaps Porzingis (35 points) and Jayson Tatum (31) proved to be too much for Detroit to handle.\nIn so many ways, Detroit did enough to win. The league's worst 3-point shooting team made more treys (13) than Boston (11), which entered the game as the league's most prolific squad from deep. The Pistons had 31 second-chance points and repeatedly fought for extra shots. Detroit got strong performances from Cade Cunningham (31 points, 6 rebounds and 9 assists) and Jaden Ivey (22 points, 10 rebounds and 4 assists, before fouling out in overtime).\nBut it wound up being not quite enough to either break Boston's undefeated start to the season at home or stop Detroit's seemingly never-ending losing streak.\n\"I'm not interested in just winning one more game this year, to stop this. That would be soft, in my opinion. I think our goals are a lot higher than that. We have what it takes to win a game. That's nothing. But to put games together and to find our system, find what's clicking and allow us to sustain winning ... that's what we're looking for right now.\" Cade Cunningham Nevertheless, Williams lauded his team's effort.\n\"With everything that this team was been through ... they bring a spirit and integrity and toughness to the gym every single day,\" he said. \"They hear everything that people have to say about them and us because they're on social media. It doesn't sway them from doing their jobs but also playing to the level and standard that we talk about every day.\n\"We can't do anything about the noise; we can control how we approach our jobs. And as bad as they hurt right now, I hurt for them. But I told them if we bring that kind of grit and toughness and execution, minus the turnovers, we're not just going to win one game, we're going to put something together. It doesn't matter what people say, we don't have to shut people up. We just have to continue to get better and grind and produce or put something on the floor that's productive that our fans can be happy about.\"\nAfter the Pistons led by as many as 21 points in the first half, Boston outscored Detroit 35-16 in the third quarter to storm back, tying the score going into the fourth quarter.\nYet even after coughing up that lead, Detroit showed an impressive level of fight. The Pistons responded to Boston taking the lead to begin the fourth by pushing themselves back out in front by as many as four points on multiple occasions -- the latest being when Ivey split a pair of free throws with 4:23 remaining.\nBoston, however, immediately responded with back-to-back buckets by Porzingis to retake the lead, before a Tatum layup and a Porzingis 3-pointer pushed Boston's advantage to 106-100.\nIvey then scored six straight points -- first on an and-1 then on a corner 3 -- to tie it back up with 1:02 to play. Bogdanovic then missed a wide-open 3 with 36 seconds left that would've given Detroit the lead, and Tatum was credited a layup with 8.7 seconds to go when Cunningham was called for goaltending.\nStill, that left the Pistons with one more chance to tie or win. But when Cunningham's 3-pointer missed short, Bogdanovic was there to make a putback for the tie. After Tatum missed a potential winner at the other end, the contest went to overtime.\nAnd from there, Boston did just enough to survive -- and send Detroit home with yet another defeat.\nBut after the Pistons had a fifth straight competitive loss -- and, in this case, went to overtime with the league's top team -- Cunningham and the Pistons believe a breakthrough might finally be around the corner.\n\"That's what we're going for, man,\" Cunningham said. \"I'm not interested in just winning one more game this year, to stop this. That would be soft, in my opinion. I think our goals are a lot higher than that. We have what it takes to win a game. That's nothing. But to put games together and to find our system, find what's clicking and allow us to sustain winning ... that's what we're looking for right now.\"",
