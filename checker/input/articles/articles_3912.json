    "text": "LAVAL, QC , March 12, 2025 /CNW/ - Residents of several regions in Quebec will benefit from expanded access to active transportation options with an investment of more than $17.3 million from the federal government which will help implement 13 projects across the province.\nA federal investment of more than $10.2 million will help the City of Laval to transform a section of Saint-Martin Boulevard, a major artery used daily by over 30,000 people, into a safer, greener, and more resilient urban corridor. Safety will be enhanced for all road users through the renewal of sidewalks and the physical separation of existing bike lanes. Additionally, new strategic connections totaling 4.3 km, between Montée Champagne and 100th Avenue, will further strengthen Laval's transportation network. With the planting of 525 trees and the creation of more than 15,000 m² of green buffer zones, these new developments will improve quality of life and promote active transportation in Quebec's third-largest city.\nThe municipality of Grenville will receive $502,437 to develop a new 510 meter pedestrian and cycling path, connecting the urban core to businesses on Maple Street/Route 344, allowing residents to travel without using their vehicles. Furthermore, two existing sections totaling 280 meters will be redeveloped to improve access to sports facilities and repair damage caused by time.\nFederal funding of $406,672 will also enable the City of Granby to implement an active transportation project on its territory. A 3.75 meter-wide multifunctional path will be built north of Route 139, facilitating travel for cyclists, walkers, and inline skating enthusiasts.\nThe funding announced today supports Canada's National Active Transportation Strategy by expanding networks of trails, bike lanes, and pedestrian bridges, in addition to supporting active transportation planning and stakeholder engagement activities.\nQuotes\n\"This investment of more than $17.3 million demonstrates our commitment to modern and sustainable infrastructure that directly benefits communities in Quebec . By promoting active mobility, user safety, and the greening of our living environments, we are building more inclusive, dynamic, and resilient cities in the face of today's environmental and urban challenges. Together, we are creating more pleasant living spaces where families, seniors, and workers can move safely while encouraging healthier and more sustainable modes of transport.\"\nThe Honourable Jean-Yves Duclos, Minister of Public Services and Procurement and Quebec Lieutenant\n\"The pedestrian and cycling development project in Grenville perfectly illustrates our commitment to promoting more sustainable and accessible modes of transportation. By providing citizens with a safe and practical alternative for getting around, we are contributing to local vitality while reducing environmental impact. These investments enhance accessibility to services and encourage active commuting, while supporting community development in the region.\"\nStéphane Lauzon, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Citizens' Services and Member of Parliament for Argenteuil—La Petite-Nation\n\"By transforming this major corridor in Laval , we are not only beautifying the neighborhood, but we are also creating a safer and more resilient living environment in the face of climate change. The 12 kilometers of landscaped curbs and the 525 new trees will retain the equivalent of an Olympic-sized swimming pool of water during heavy rainfall, thus reducing pressure on the sewer system. This $10.2 million investment from the federal government and $29 million from the City of Laval will have a tangible impact on the quality of life for thousands of Laval residents.\"\nStéphane Boyer, Mayor of Laval\nRelated products\nLink Backgrounder: The federal government is investing more than $17.3M for greener urban environments and improved mobility in Quebec Quick Facts\nThe federal government is investing $17,351,321 in these projects through the Active Transportation Fund (ATF). Active transportation refers to the movement of people or goods powered by human activity. It includes walking, cycling and the use of human-powered or hybrid mobility aids such as wheelchairs, scooters, e-bikes, rollerblades, snowshoes, cross-country skis, and more. Applications from eligible Indigenous applicants and applicants located in the territories are currently being accepted under the Active Transportation Fund's Capital Project stream until April 9, 2025 . For more information, please visit https://housing-infrastructure.canada.ca/trans/index-eng.html . In support of Canada's National Active Transportation Strategy, the Active Transportation Fund was launched in 2021 to provide $400 million to make travel by active transportation easier, safer, more convenient, and more enjoyable. The National Active Transportation Strategy is the country's first coast-to-coast-to-coast strategic approach for promoting active transportation and its benefits. The strategy's aim is to make data-driven and evidence-based investments to build new and expanded active transportation networks, while supporting equitable, healthy, active, and sustainable travel options. Investing in active transportation infrastructure provides many tangible benefits, such as creating employment opportunities, strengthening the economy, promoting healthier lifestyles, ensuring equitable access to services and opportunities, cutting air and noise pollution, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The new Canada Public Transit Fund (CPTF) will provide an average of $3 billion a year of permanent funding to respond to local transit needs by enhancing integrated planning, improving access to public transit and active transportation, and supporting the development of more affordable, sustainable, and inclusive communities. The CPTF supports transit and active transportation investments in three streams: Metro Region Agreements, Baseline Funding, and Targeted Funding.

    "text": "(agrega testimonios de pasajeros afectados a la ec5418)\nBuenos Aires, 13 sep (EFECOM).- Trabajadores de la aerolínea pública argentina secundan este viernes un paro por 24 horas, en medio de protestas para reclamar mejoras salariales, que afecta a unos 37.000 pasajeros y tendrá un impacto económico de 2,5 millones de dólares, según informaron fuentes oficiales.\nEl paro encabezado por la Asociación de Pilotos de Líneas Aéreas y la Asociación Argentina de Aeronavegantes afecta a decenas de miles de pasajeros tanto de Aerolíneas Argentinas como de otras compañías aéreas, pues también se resienten los servicios de rampa por las asambleas de trabajadores, informó la compañía de bandera.\nEl baceñonés Mario Valero, de 35 años, contó a EFE que había ahorrado para ir a El Calafate, en la Patagonia argentina, y \"de repente\" se encontró con la huelga: \"No sabemos cómo actuar y qué solución nos van a dar\".\nReconoció que \"no\" le van a \"compensar toda la pérdida y menos el tiempo\", porque ya tenía reservadas la noche de hotel y la excursión en El Calafate, pero \"al menos\" deseaba que lo alojen esta noche y expresó su temor por \"si el vuelo de mañana sale\".\n\"Entiendo que todo el mundo tenga derecho al paro, pero al menos un servicio mínimo deberían de tener\", porque \"24 horas sin un solo vuelo me parece una falta de respeto a los turistas y a la gente de aquí\", opinó.\nUn turista alemán procedente de Uruguay, Michael van Bevern, contó a EFE que se enteró del paro \"de casualidad\", pero estaba \"contento\" con la amabilidad de Aerolíneas Argentinas, que le programó otro vuelo también a El Calafate para el sábado: \"Más no podía esperar\", \"perdimos un solo día y chau, no pasa nada\".\nEn este marco, el Gobierno confirmó que habrá \"multas y sanciones\" y habló de \"profunda inmoralidad\" en el comportamiento de los pilotos de la línea de bandera, según dijo el portavoz presidencial, Manuel Adorni, en su habitual comparecencia en la Casa Rosada (sede del Ejecutivo).\n\"Los que paran hoy (...) van a ser, como corresponde, multados y sancionados. Además, tres pilotos de Aerolíneas Argentinas fueron despedidos por negarse a operar un avión\", afirmó.\nEl presidente argentino, Javier Milei, va a firmar hoy la reglamentación del artículo 182 del mega decreto de necesidad y urgencia (DNU), emitido en diciembre pasado, que \"establece los lineamientos para declarar la aeronáutico civil y comercial como servicio esencial\", adelantó el portavoz\nDías atrás, el Ministerio de Capital Humano explicó en un comunicado que \"se ha definido reglamentar la esencialidad de la actividad aeronáutico civil, aerocomercial pública y privada en todo el territorio nacional\" para garantizar \"servicios mínimos a la población\".\nEl sector aeronáutico está envuelto en protestas por la reclamación por mejoras salariales; entre ellas, el paro del 6 de agosto, que afectó a unos 15.000 pasajeros y 185 vuelos.\n\"Quienes no quieren resignar sus privilegios van a terminar fundiendo la empresa que tanto dicen querer defender\", concluyó Adorni, quien enumeró los \"privilegios\" corporativos de los pilotos.\nUn sindicalista que impulsa la protesta está de vacaciones en España junto a su familia \"haciendo uso de los beneficios corporativos que pagamos todos los argentinos\", denunció el portavoz, en alusión a Edgardo Llano, secretario general de la Asociación del Personal Aeronáutico (APA), quienes, según medios locales, se encuentra en ese país europeo.\nPor contra, añadió Adorni, \"hay gente que perdió por la medida (de fuerza) seguramente ahorros, tiempo, días de trabajo\".\nPor su parte, el secretario general de la Asociación Argentina de Aeronavegantes, Juan Pablo Brey, explicó a la radio Urbana Play que desde que asumió el Gobierno de Milei Aerolíneas Argentinas se encamina \"a la privatización\" y señaló que hay una estrategia del Ejecutivo \"de asfixiar\" a la compañía y a sus trabajadores.\nPese a que la privatización de Aerolíneas Argentinas era una aspiración del mandatario, la compañía quedó fuera del listado de empresas públicas susceptibles de ello que el Ejecutivo incluyó en su Ley de Bases y Puntos de Partida para la Libertad de los Argentinos -más conocida como 'ley bases'-.\nNo obstante, el partido Propuesta Republicana (PRO, centroderecha), fundado por el expresidente Mauricio Macri (2015-2019), presentó recientemente un proyecto de ley para su privatización.
