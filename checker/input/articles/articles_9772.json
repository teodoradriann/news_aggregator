    "title": "2024 Trends: Brands Embrace User-Generated Content in Influencer Marketing",
    "text": "Inc describes how brands will usher in a new era in influencer marketing in 2024 with user-generated content and engaging real customers. The article highlights how brands in 2024 are increasingly leveraging everyday people instead of professional content creators. This tactic, which includes giving away products and affiliate revenue, aims to strengthen relationships with customers and involve brand superfans more closely in product development.\nExperts in the influencer marketing industry were the first to notice this trend. Chris Jacks from the agency HireInfluence emphasizes that user generated content (UGC) is particularly suitable for companies with limited marketing budgets. Changing algorithms and social platforms, as well as consumers’ preference for less polished and produced content, have contributed to this change.\nBrands like Perelel and Beauty Stat work with existing customers to generate UGC by offering free products. This strategy not only leads to conversion but also long-term visibility. Additionally, brands emphasize the importance of building lasting relationships through rewards such as invitations to brand events or being featured on the website or social media.\nGifting strategies are also an important part of this approach, with brands able to offer incentives such as affiliate commissions on TikTok or advertising discounts for creating UGC. It’s also important to strategically decide who to send products to, with a focus on micro-influencers in relevant niches.\nWhile traditional influencer marketing still has its place, the article emphasizes that diversity in marketing strategy, including incorporating UGC, is beneficial for brands. Especially for brands with limited budgets or those looking to diversify their influencer marketing campaigns, this approach offers a solid option.\n2023-12-28 20:06:37\n#Revolution #Influencer #Marketing #Power #Superfans",

    "text": "Chanel West Coast Told Cheeky Cowgirl Underwear Photos Are 'Embarrassing'\nBy Evie Scott on April 30, 2025 at 6:00 PM EDT\nChanel West Coast's popularity took a hit this week as she updated her Instagram with a Western-themed look. The TV star and rapper, 36, has been steadily posting cowgirl-themed looks as she promotes her latest \"Lil Bit Country\" single, but it didn't look like many of her fans were feeling it.\nChanel's photos marked her attendance at the Stagecoach Festival, where she showed up in a cheeky two-piece and cowboy boots, plus a hat.\nThe West Coast Hustle star, who has already had her Instagram fans questioning if she really is \"country,\" faced more of the same criticism in these snaps, although not all users were hurtful.\nChanel West Coast Sizzles In Cheeky Cowgirl Undies\nView this post on Instagram\nScroll for the photos. Offering a rear view in her opening slide, Chanel flaunted her curvy backside and toned legs in a tight pair of boy-short briefs in black.\nAdding a black halter bra top with double straps at the back, the \"No Plans\" hitmaker showed off her shapely waist and muscular back, also going full throttle with her cowgirl vibes as her bottoms came with \"YEE HAW\" written across them.\nRocking black leather cowboy boots and a tan hat, Chanel completed her figure-flaunting outfit with a hand-held shawl, posing outdoors and in the dark.\nSee More Photos Below!\nView this post on Instagram\nChanel struck a similar pose in a swipe right, once again showcasing her fit figure as she stood backed by tall palms and a lit-up sign. In a caption, she wrote: \"Yee-haw @stagecoach\" before asking fans which of the two photos they preferred. The post has now topped 16,000 likes, but the comments section is rocky.\nMocking Chanel, one fan replied: \"Yeah all the top female country stars pose like that, NOT...\" Over 15 fans agreed when a user said: \"Ya because that's country # embarrassing.\" Chanel West Coast was even targeted on the motherhood front as one fan suggested that her skimpy look wasn't appropriate for a mom. In November 2022, the L.A. native welcomed daughter Bowie Breeze with boyfriend Dom Fenison.\nStunning In Swimsuit And Cowboy Boots\nView this post on Instagram\nChanel West Coast has even been using her latest cowgirl era to promote her Coasty Swim brand, founded in 2022.\nIn the above photo, she struck a pose in a busty yellow swimsuit, flaunting her cleavage and hourglass waistline while soaking up the sun outdoors. Adding white boots and a cowboy hat, Chanel told fans that it was a \"Coasty Swim kinda day.\"\nThat Leggy Valentine's Day Dress\nView this post on Instagram\nThis share brought a more positive response. Comparing Chanel's country music to singer Beyoncé's Cowboy Carter album, one fan said: \"Your new song is amazing!!! Hell of a lot better than Beyoncés attempt at country music.\"\nChanel delighted fans with this lacy look in February, going girly in a pink minidress and strappy heels as she marked Valentine's Day. She also tagged Fashion Nova for her cute look.",

Snowmobiling has been steadily growing in popularity in Colorado. Colorado Parks and Wildlife issues snowmobile registrations and shows that 29,505 machines were licensed in 2022, up from 24,789 in 2020.\nThe CSA is composed of 36 clubs. Its members groom about 3,000 miles of trails which also are used for Nordic skiing, dog sledding, snow biking and other winter fun. The CSA website has details on current conditions, where to take safety lessons, and the ins and outs of buying a permit.\nHere’s an introductory look at this winter activity in Colorado.\nJordan Valente of Denver enjoys a morning of fresh snow on Jan. 17, 2012, as he rides at Vail Pass Winter Recreation Area.

The Klondike tour follows a groomed trail in the White River National Forest to the Klondike cabin where a gourmet lunch awaits. (OK, the lunch features cheeseburgers, but they’re really good ones!) Kids as young as 4 can ride. Snowmobile drivers must be at least 18 years old and have a valid driver’s license.\nAlthough Independence Pass is closed to road traffic in winter, the Majestic Tour leads you to the town of Independence near the Continental Divide . The Lost Man Cabin welcomes you with a lunch and spectacular views. This ride is best for those with some experience riding. Riders must be at least 7.\nYou can combine a nice hot springs soak with your snowmobiling adventure at Mount Princeton Hot Springs near Salida. The concierge at Mount Princeton can arrange a guided snowmobile tour with a local operator. Upon your return, slide into the warm waters for a soothing soak.\nSteamboat Snowmobile Tours offers First Tracks tours on Rabbit Ears Pass, which can be a real treat on a powder day. It also offers four-hour Backcountry Adventure tours that take riders to the Continental Divide and include lunch. White Mountain Snowmobile Tours in Leadville combines snowmobiling with ziplining. The day starts with ziplining, then it’s time for lunch in town. You’ll round out the day with an afternoon of snowmobiling. Keep in mind that Leadville is 10,158 feet above sea level and you’ll be riding higher than that during this day of adventure.\nMark T. Osler, The Denver Post Mark Allen takes off on his snowmobile during a tour of Battle Mountain, south of Minturn, on Feb. 21, 2008. (Denver Post file) Rent and go Many companies rent snowmobiles, so you can explore Colorado’s winter wonderland on your own even if you don’t own a snow machine. This also means you are in charge of your own safety, so keep these safety tips in mind:\n1. Call ahead and ask what gear is included with your rental. Snowsuit or bib? Heated handlebars? Goggles? Gloves? If they’re not included, arrange to rent or buy them for your trip.\n2. Take an avalanche safety course. Carry necessary gear, including a snow shovel, and know how to complete a rescue. Avalanche risk varies from day to day. It’s up to you to research current conditions. You should set out with an alternative plan in mind in case you venture into an area where the avalanche risk appears too great.\n3. Bring water and sunscreen.\n4. Have reliable communication, which probably means something other than a cellphone.\nDon’t put yourself, your trip mates and rescue teams at risk. Most rescue teams include many volunteers. They risk their own safety when they attempt to save people who are stuck or lost.\n“Some people want to go to the expert areas right off,” Calhoun said. “Normally that’s when you get in a problem with this stuff, and avalanches are the Number One danger for snowmobiling.”\nPopular spots for snowmobilers include Leadville, Grand Lake, Vail Pass Winter Recreation Area and Rabbit Ears Pass near Steamboat Springs.\nGrand Lake is considered Colorado’s snowmobiling capital and features more than 300 miles of trails for every level of snowmobiler. There are another 700 miles of trails in surrounding Grand County. Snow machines are allowed in only a small area of Rocky Mountain National Park, but the region’s trails offer views of the park’s famous peaks and grandeur. It’s legal to ride a snowmobile in Grand Lake, provided the streets have enough packed snow.\nRelated Articles Travel | How to travel with your pet responsibly Travel | What Gen Z and millennial travelers are seeking in 2024 Travel | Accessible travel, a $58 billion market, gets its first one-stop shop Travel | Where would you live if you won the lottery? Travel | Traveling internationally? Order foreign currency before you go There are numerous outfitters to rent from in Grand Lake, and some lodges have snowmobiles available for rent.\nThe Rabbit Ears Pass area offers trails across meadows and through snow-covered trees as you ride up and over the mountainous terrain.\n“I live in Steamboat,” Calhoun said. “People come here to ski, and they ski like crazy at high altitude, and then have to rest for a day or two. During that time, they can go snowmobiling with their families.”\nAs with all winter sports, research conditions before you set out, wear appropriate gear, and always tell someone reliable where you are going and when you plan to return.\nSubscribe to our weekly newsletter, The Adventurist, to get outdoors news sent straight to your inbox.\nShare this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window) More Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Submit to Stumbleupon (Opens in new window) Most Popular Most Popular Man who shot Burnsville officers and firefighter tried to have gun rights restored after assault conviction Man who shot Burnsville officers and firefighter tried to have gun rights restored after assault conviction Children were in room with man who killed Burnsville officers and firefighter, and shot himself, mother says Children were in room with man who killed Burnsville officers and firefighter, and shot himself, mother says Twin Cities executive convicted of insider trading involving company’s acquisition by Medtronic Twin Cities executive convicted of insider trading involving company's acquisition by Medtronic ‘Heroic actions’ of law enforcement meant safety for family in Burnsville home, says relative of gunman’s girlfriend 'Heroic actions' of law enforcement meant safety for family in Burnsville home, says relative of gunman's girlfriend St. Catherine University to shutter 93-year-old early learning center in May St. Catherine University to shutter 93-year-old early learning center in May Metro Transit bus driver fatally strikes pedestrian in St. Paul’s Highland Park Metro Transit bus driver fatally strikes pedestrian in St. Paul's Highland Park Stillwater school board approves later start time for high-schoolers in 2025-26 Stillwater school board approves later start time for high-schoolers in 2025-26 The 2024 Minnesota girls state hockey tournament brackets The 2024 Minnesota girls state hockey tournament brackets Donation platform announced for families of Burnsville’s fallen first responders as second vigil is held Donation platform announced for families of Burnsville's fallen first responders as second vigil is held Magnolias Restaurant, popular Payne Avenue diner, damaged in Monday evening fire Magnolias Restaurant, popular Payne Avenue diner, damaged in Monday evening fire Trending Nationally Largest COVID vaccine study yet finds links to health conditions Girl killed in sand hole on Lauderdale-by-the-Sea identified; lifeguards could have prevented tragedy, experts say After killing sex worker in SoHo hotel, man busted in Arizona stabbings: cops Syphilis cases spike in Florida, especially in Orange County Brooklyn-born ‘Porky’s’ star Tony Ganios dead at 64 from cardiac arrest after spinal cord surgery",
