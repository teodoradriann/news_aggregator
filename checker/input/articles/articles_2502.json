El gol, un remate con el pie derecho desde el corazón del área tras asistencia de Nuno Mendes, supone un hito más en la carrera de récord del jugador. Cristiano Ronaldo.— UEFA EURO 2024 (@EURO2024) 900 career goals 🤯 [#NationsLeague] [pic.twitter.com/5WFKOfvXkC] [September 5, 2024] El delantero suma 900 goles en 1238 partidos oficiales, con una media de casi 0,73 tantos por encuentro, que ha marcado con las camisetas de Sporting (5), del Manchester United (145), del Real Madrid (450), del Juventus (101) y del Al-Nassr (67). Publicidad A su periplo en estos clubes se suman los 131 tantos que ha firmado con la selección de Portugal.

    "text": "Sono finiti i giorni soleggiati di questo periodo natalizio, favoriti dall’alta pressione delle Azzorre , e ora il meteo lascia spazio a due perturbazioni che vedranno un’Epifania segnata dal maltempo. Fino all’Epifania, il 6 gennaio, l’Italia sarà attraversata da venti, piogge e neve, in attesa poi di una possibile ondata di gelo artico in quota. La prima inizierà a interessare l’Italia venerdì 3 con piogge sull’Emilia Romagna, poi al Centro e quindi in Campania .\nGià il 4 gennaio, l’aria fredda polare favorirà la caduta della neve fin sopra i 900-1000 metri sui rilievi emiliano-romagnoli e dai 1400 metri nel Centro Italia . Il giorno dopo sarà invece in arrivo la seconda perturbazione , che proseguirà anche nel giorno dell’ Epifania e renderà i mari molto mossi , con la complicità di Libeccio e Scirocco , che soffieranno forti. Sono inoltre previste piogge su tutto il Nord e sulla Toscana , mentre la neve tornerà a cadere sulle Alpi sopra i 6-800 metri. Possibile però che arrivi anche su Piemonte , Lombardia ed Emilia . E dal 9 e 10 gennaio si attende l’arrivo di un forte gelo proveniente dal Nord Europa, che potrebbe provocare maltempo su molte regioni italiane.\nSabato 4 gennaio – Al Nord giornata stabile e in prevalenza soleggiata, salvo nebbie in Pianura Padana , a tratti anche persistenti. Il cielo tenderà a coprirsi in serata al Nordovest , preludio a un nuovo peggioramento del tempo. Al Centro giornata asciutta con sole prevalente, ma il cielo sarà molto più nuvoloso o coperto sulle regioni adriatiche. Venti deboli di Maestrale . Al Sud giornata con il passaggio veloce di una perturbazione che provocherà delle piogge sparse sulle regioni peninsulari. Più sole in Sicilia .\nDomenica 5 gennaio – Al Nord graduale peggioramento del tempo con cielo via via più coperto ovunque e precipitazioni in arrivo dai settori occidentali verso sera. Al Centro tempo che tenderà a peggiorare con cielo via via più coperto su molte regioni e precipitazioni in arrivo sulla Toscana settentrionale. Al Sud invece la giornata trascorrerà con un cielo più coperto su Campania e Calabria , altrove sarà poco o irregolarmente nuvoloso. Venti deboli da direzioni variabili e mari mossi.\n(immagine d’archivio)",

    "title": "'Dismal failure, whining everywhere,' Martha Karua gives verdict on President Ruto's first year in office",
    "text": "Azimio la Umoja co-principal Martha Karua has given a damning assessment of President William Ruto's first year in office branding it a 'dismal failure'.\nSpeaking in an interview on Citizen TV on Thursday, the Narc-Kenya frontman faulted President Ruto's regime of persistently complaining and inculpating former President Uhuru Kenyatta for the nation's dire economic state.\n\"Dismal failure, whining everywhere, complaining and blaming Uhuru Kenyatta in a government that Ruto was. Most of the cronies he is with were also in that government,\" said Karua.\nReflecting on the past, Karua recalled her tenure under the late President Mwai Kibaki in 2003, emphasising that despite inheriting a troubled treasury and economy neither the president nor his ministers abstained from duty due to the failings of the previous administration.\n\"When we came in as a government under President Kibaki in 2003, we found the coffers empty. Not once did I ever hear President Kibaki or his ministers saying because we found empty coffers we cannot work,\" she said.\n\"We were so busy trying to put things together, trying to bring up the economy. We concentrated on the job that we had persuaded Kenyans to give us and there were results which came almost immediately. The Kenya Kwanza rogue-regime has been whining and continues to whine even today.\"\nTo reinforce her argument, Karua referenced the roof leakage incident at JKIA in November and the negative effects of the El-Nino rains, issues she seemingly acknowledged could have been prevented if the Kenya Kwanza government had been fulfilling its responsibilities.\n\"Recently there was a leak at the airport and I heard them blame the Uhuru regime. A year later you want to tell us you didn't hear the structure had a leak? They might as well tell us that the deaths of El-Nino were caused by the regime that left. They had been warned of El-Nino and yet Ruto announced that there would be no rains,\" she said.\n\"The elements are not under him; they only relate to themselves. So El-Nino has come and the results have been disastrous. I would say the one year is calamity upon Kenyans. I haven't seen anything positive.\"\nWhen asked whether the Kenya Kwanza government deserves to be given some slack since it inherited a troubled economy exacerbated by the Kenyan shilling's depreciation against the dollar, Karua underscored that the Azimio la Umoja One Kenya Alliance was ready to assume Kenya's leadership despite its challenges.\n\"We wished to inherit the country as it was, as Azimio because we had ideas on how to do it. We do not have a revenue problem, we have an expenditure problem so the first stop is not to whine about yesterday, it is to cut all unnecessary spending, prioritise essential services to the people and servicing of debt, not prioritising robbing Peter to pay Paul,\" Karua told interviewer Sam Gituku. host\n\"Ruto has gone on a borrowing spree, within a year he has borrowed more than his predecessor borrowed within a year so he can't talk about the ills if he has borrowed more. There is nothing to show for it (borrowing) because nothing has been accomplished. All that this regime has done in the first year is to enrich themselves.\"\nTags: Citizen Digital William Ruto Martha Karua Kenya Kwanza Azimio Citizen TV Kenya Want to send us a story?

    "text": "The Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists, and Dentists Union (KMPDU) has threatened to down tools beginning in December should the government fail to disburse the remaining funds owed to them.\nKMPDU Secretary General Davji Atellah, who spoke during the union’s delegates conference held in Nairobi on Saturday, November 30, said the Ksh965 million disbursed by the government today was inadequate to pay all the intern doctors.\nWhile expressing the union’s frustration with the government, Atellah noted that the [KMPDU would not agree to talks](https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/106869-clinical-officers-threaten-strike-over-shif-rollout-issue-three-week-notice) with the government until it agreed to disburse the remaining amount.\nAccording to the union leaders, the government’s decision to disburse Ksh965 million for arrears payment and November salary meant that each intern doctor would only receive Ksh40,000, stating that the funds were less than the agreed amount.\n“The Ministry of Health has released a notice that violates the tents of the Collective Bargain Agreement (CBA), it has released a letter that makes every doctor afraid to go to work,” Atellah said.\n“We are deliberating, we have had a discussion for the last three hours to see how we are going on strike. That shall be a big strike, and you can take my word to the banks,” he added.\nAddressing journalists after the meeting, KMPDU Deputy Secretary General Dennis Miskellah revealed that some of the intern doctors were yet to receive their monthly pay despite the government’s announcement that it had disbursed the funds.\nMiskellah went ahead to take a swipe at Health Cabinet Secretary Deborah Barasa for allegedly lying to the medical fraternity and the country as a whole through her early-morning presser.\n“The health minister wakes up early and does a press conference lying to Kenyans that the government has released money and paid interns. We are disappointed that they do not have that money in the account,” Miskellah claimed.\nKMPDU's stance comes hours after CS Deborah Barasa announced that the [government has already disbursed Ksh965 million ](https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/106876-ministry-health-announces-payment-salaries-arrears-intern-health-workers)to pay all intern doctors across the country.\nSpeaking to members of the press on Saturday morning, Barasa said the move marked a significant milestone in the government's commitment to supporting healthcare professionals at the foundation of their careers.\n“Internship programs are a critical component of Kenya's healthcare system, providing hands-on experience to bridge the gap between theory and practice,” CS Barasa stated.\n“By ensuring timely remuneration, the Ministry affirms its commitment to fostering a conducive environment for professional growth, thereby enhancing the quality of care delivered to Kenyans,” she added.",
