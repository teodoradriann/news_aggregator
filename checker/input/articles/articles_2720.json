    "text": "Empowering Catechists as collaborators against Human Trafficking Sr Oluwakemi Akinleye fsp Prophetic voices against human trafficking The great works of many religious sisters in various parts of the world, with many collaborators, in the fight against human trafficking continue to be admirable and appreciated. Their daring and amazing skills in organizing and carrying out several antitrafficking activities from creating awareness, to forming antitrafficking ambassadors and empowering minors and women are remarkable and worth emulating. The sisters give of themselves in this noble and courageous task of eradicating human trafficking because they are convinced that it is an evil and that no one must be made to go through its horrors and trauma. They work mostly in teams and take great risks in rescuing survivors and exposing perpetrators of abuse and trafficking. They too are often in danger of being attacked, contradicted and assaulted. Yet they move on as courageous foot soldiers, focused on saving lives and promoting true freedom for their fellow brothers and sisters. Every effort counts in ending human trafficking Catechists in many African Catholic parishes are men and women who dedicate their time, energy and resources, in collaboration with priests, to build up the local parish community in its faith journey. They prepare candidates for the Sacraments, lead prayer services without a priest and participate actively in the Small Christian Communities. Since these are community leaders, the Daughters of St Paul in West Africa (Nigeria and Ghana) have committed themselves to the formation of Catechists as collaborators in the fight against human trafficking. The Sisters usually organize with the local Bishop and chaplain for Catechists of a diocese and give the input on abuse and trafficking during the annual training program for the Catechists. Sr Josephine Idowu, the Delegate Superior of the Daughters of St Paul in West Africa, states that, “Today, it is the responsibility of everyone to join in the fight against human trafficking and our sisters cannot be exempted. They gladly carry out this task even in difficult and challenging places.” The Daughters of Saint Paul have animated over a thousand Catechists in different dioceses in the north and south of Nigeria. Working together to eradicate this scourge One of the many reasons why human trafficking continues to thrive in Africa is the reality of poverty on the continent. The poor and less educated are often the first targets, even though some young people from wealthy homes have also fallen victim. The question one asks is, must the poor in Africa continue to fall victim because they are poor? There is so much already being done by various groups to curb trafficking but how can we hasten the education and empowerment of our people so as to prevent them from continuously being trafficked? Today the victims may be persons living in the next building or village, and tomorrow they might be your relatives or dear ones. Therefore, all hands must be on deck to rid society of the evil of trafficking in persons. As Sr Mary Baron OLA, the president of the International Union of Superior General (UISG) states, “the support to fight together against this scourge is always needed of all committed people, of whatever creed, of whatever gender.” Thank you for reading our article.

    "title": "Dementia Risk Higher for Stroke Survivors",
    "text": "Edited by Anushree Chaphalkar\nJanuary 10, 2025\n0 0 TOPLINE: Risk for dementia is nearly 80% higher in stroke survivors than in those without stroke, a new study reveals. The data suggest risk declines within 1 year after stroke but remains elevated for up to 20 years.\nMETHODOLOGY: Researchers conducted a population-wide analysis of over 15 million people in Canada between 2002 and 2022. The study focused on adults hospitalized for ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, or acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Of 175,980 stroke survivors, 99% were matched 1:1 to residents without stroke on the basis of age, sex, rural residence, neighborhood deprivation, and vascular comorbidities. Additionally, 90% of patients were matched to those with AMI. Incident dementia diagnoses were tracked starting 90 days after stroke until death, emigration, or the end of the study, using a validated algorithm based on hospitalization for dementia, prescriptions for cholinesterase inhibitors, or physician claims within 2 years. The mean follow-up duration was 5.6 years. TAKEAWAY : Among stroke survivors, 19% were diagnosed with dementia vs 12.5% in the reference population. The dementia rate per 100 person-years was higher among stroke survivors than in the reference population over the entire follow-up period (3.34 vs 1.89). Over the entire study period, dementia was 76% more likely among stroke patients (hazard ratio [HR], 1.76; 95% CI, 1.73-1.79) and 82% more likely in the AMI cohort (HR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.79-1.85) than in the reference population. Time-varying analysis revealed that dementia risk was highest within the first year after stroke, with a > 2.5-fold increase at 6 months (HR, 2.51; 95% CI, 2.42-2.59), which decreased to a 1.5-fold increase at 5 years (HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.48-1.56) but remained elevated compared with the reference population even 20 years after the index stroke. Recurrent stroke was associated with an approximately threefold increased risk for dementia (single recurrent stroke adjusted HR, 2.64; 95% CI, 2.54-2.74; multiple recurrent strokes adjusted HR, 3.05; 95% CI, 2.81-3.33). IN PRACTICE: “While much research has been focused on reducing the risk of a second stroke, our findings make it clear that more research also is needed on developing interventions to help prevent dementia after stroke,” lead author Raed A. Joundi, MD, DPhil, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, said in a press release .\n“There is a need to accelerate the implementation of promising interventions or multipronged approaches into large randomized controlled trials to lower the risk of dementia,” the investigators wrote.\nSOURCE: The study was published online on December 4 in Neurology .\nLIMITATIONS: The study’s limitations included reliance on administrative coding without imaging data, potential underestimation of mild dementia, and lack of granular information on stroke severity, disability, and prestroke cognitive decline. While adjustments were made for healthcare contact and secondary prevention medications, residual biases may have persisted.\nDISCLOSURES: This study received funding from the Canada Brain Research Fund, Heart & Stroke Foundation of Canada, and Canadian Stroke Consortium. Two authors hold awards and positions from national organizations and academic institutions in Canada. Additional details are provided in the original article.\nThis article was created using several editorial tools, including AI, as part of the process.

    "text": "These Stackable Tupperware Containers Will Save You So Much Cabinet Space — and They’re on Sale\nindependentlyselect these products—if you buy from one of our links, we may earn a commission. All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.\nI love a good cleaning video, and since I downloaded TikTok a few years back, I’ve learned about everything from the best way to\nscrape caked-on grease off of a frying pan to what steps to take to make a cutting board look like new. Considering how popular CleanTok is, a lot of social media users appear to share my interest. After all, these kinds of videos are not only satisfying to watch, but also seriously inspiring and useful. The tips and tricks they share can have a drastic effect on your cleaning routine.\nBut my favorite kind of cleaning video, above all? The gratifying before-and-afters of people organizing their kitchens. Specifically, the ones where they ditch all of the packaging their food comes in for aesthetically pleasing, space-efficient containers. If you’ve been itching to follow in their footsteps like I have, this is your sign to do just that —\nTupperware is offering major deals on their Modular Mates collection right now, which will completely transform your shelves visually and functionally.\nWhat is the Modular Mates Collection?\nWhether you’re looking to do a complete pantry overhaul in the New Year or start out smaller, there’s something for you in the Modular Mates collection. There are nearly 70 options to choose from, including singular pieces that vary in shape and size like the\n9-inch tall oval container or the shorter and wider version. You can mix and match depending on the size of your shelves, and best of all, their stackable design will save you valuable space.\nThe deals on the bundles, however, might just be too good to pass up. With black and white lid options, you can opt for a set designed to hold a specific kind of food, like\npasta or baking ingredients. Tupperware is even offering a bundle for beverages — which, as a regular tea and coffee drinker, I’m definitely eyeing, along with the Snack Center. I’m a serious snacker, so I’m completely sold on the six-piece set. Each piece — all of which vary in size — come with securely sealed lids (as does the rest of the Modular collection), so its contents will stay fresh longer.\nOn the\nModular Mate square container listing on Amazon, one reviewer described how they’ve sworn by them for over two decades. “I’ve always liked how the big containers fit an entire 5 lb. bag of flour and how they snugly on top of each other,” they wrote. “I was so glad that I can still find Modular Mates that fit on top of the old ones or next to them. The style is so good because of their square shape — no cabinet space wasted. The old seals from 25 years ago are just as good as my new ones, too.” Consider me sold.\nThe Modular Mates sale is the perfect opportunity to say goodbye to chaotic cabinets in the New Year, so don’t wait too long to start organizing!",
