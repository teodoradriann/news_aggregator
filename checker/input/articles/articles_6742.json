    "title": "Tiny frog the size of a PEA is the world's smallest vertebrate - WhatsNew2Day",
    "text": "Scientists have discovered a pea-sized frog hidden in a Brazilian forest that could be the world’s smallest vertebrate. The ‘flea toad’ measures just 7.1 millimeters, on average, making it now the smallest in the world, after researchers successfully measured a total of 46 specimens of the tiny amphibian found in its forest habitat in the hilltop in southern Bahia, Brazil. The little frog’s upward-facing back blends into its surroundings in a “background color” of different browns, unlike many of the bright yellow or orange frogs in similar locations. Male flea toads proved to be competitively the smallest half of the species, with their female counterparts measuring an average of 8.15 mm, or slightly larger than the previous record holder: the Paedophryne amauensis Papua New Guinea frog. While biologists have been aware of the existence of the pea-sized flea toad (above) since it was first identified in 2011, it took an exhaustive study of 46 specimens to confirm that it was actually the world’s smallest . To illustrate how small Brazil’s new record-breaking flea toad really is, researchers also photographed the tiny creature on a 1 Brazilian real coin. The coin has a diameter of 27 mm and a thickness of 1.95 mm. More than a dozen adult flea toads could fit in a single Real Biologists have been aware of the existence of the pea-sized flea toad since it was first discovered living in the Atlantic rainforest of Bahia in 2011, as first published in [zootaxa](https://doi.org/10.11646/zootaxa.2739.1.3). But this new, more comprehensive study of specimens served to show that the team had obtained enough samples of adult frogs to draw a firm conclusion about the average size of the species. “Sub-average sizes should be confirmed as adults,” the new study reads, “which can be done by direct observation of the gonads.” Their measurements, the researchers reported in the peer-reviewed journal. [Scripta Zoo](https://doi.org/10.1111/zsc.12654) in January, helped them quickly assess whether the toads were adults by determining “whether they are reproductively mature or not.” The scientists, who included herpetologists affiliated with German and Brazilian universities, also examined the frogs for the presence of vocal slits in their throats – a feature only males of the species have. The results were “absolutely clear,” according to Mark Scherz, who studies amphibians and reptiles as curator of herpetology at the Natural History Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen. “These are actually potentially the smallest frogs that exist in the world, which is surprising,” Scherz said. [new scientist](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2416854-brazilian-flea-toad-may-be-the-worlds-smallest-vertebrate/#:~:text=A%20tiny%20Brazilian%20frog%20about,described%20by%20scientists%20in%202011.). Above, one of the flea toad’s losing competitors, the pumpkin toad or Brachycephalus ephippiumHe also posed with another 1 Brazilian real coin. Above, another of the flea toad’s losing competitors, the Izecksohn’s flea toad. Brachycephalus didactylusposing on a small mushroom Scherz, an independent expert not affiliated with the authors of the new study, told the publication that he was impressed by how small the smallest of the adult flea toads could be. “It’s 6.45 millimeters (long), 30 percent smaller than any adult male frog I’ve ever seen,” Scherz said. “It’s almost a millimeter smaller than the next smallest frog.” The researchers found that the length range of the adult male flea toad was between 6.45 mm and 7.90 mm. For adult female flea toads, the range was 7.38 mm to 9.87 mm. To better illustrate how small Brazil’s new record-breaking flea toad really is, researchers also photographed the tiny creature on a 1 Brazilian real coin. The seven gram coin has a diameter of 27 mm and a thickness of 1.95 mm. More than a dozen adult flea toads, formally known as Pulex brachycephalycould fit on the obverse of a single real coin. “Identifying the world’s smallest frog has not been an easy challenge,” the team confessed in their new report. To begin with, the species only appears to exist in two forested hills in the southern Bahia region of Brazil. The lead author of the study, herpetologist Dr. [Mirco Solé](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mirco-Sole) at Santa Cruz State University in Brazil, had to obtain permission to work on the property of the owners of the Serra Bonita Private Reserve, Clemira Souza and Vitor Osmar Becker. They also need to get more flea toads or B. pulex samples of the [Célio Fernando Bautista Haddad](https://bv.fapesp.br/en/pesquisador/297/celio-fernando-baptista-haddad/) Amphibian collection. Solé and his co-authors noted that it was surprising that even in the case of these tiny pea-sized frogs, the males were smaller than the females, a form of “sexual dimorphism” that applies to 90 percent of all species. of frogs and toads, both. ‘Anuran’ amphibians. The researchers were also impressed that the smallness of B. pulex meant that it effectively had no hard “bony elements” other than a very hard and thick or “hypersified” skull and spine. But, as Solé and his team suggested in their paper, the flea toad may not retain its crown for long, and they wonder, “Has the lower limit of vertebrates really been reached?”",

And he’s an excellent mentor. I mean, he’s an even better friend, too. So watching him out here [and] picking his brain is always good. But you know, Travis Kelce [is] Travis Kelce, for a reason. I’m just trying to do my job to the best of my ability and, you know, not try to do too much more than that.” Gray added: “He’s just very intelligent and knowledgeable, and he’s been in the league for 10-plus years. “So, a guy like that sees the defenses differently, and it’s just really cool to see him talk through how he looks at defenses and safeties and corners and what he’s thinking, you know, mid-route, so, you know, getting the firsthand take of that every day in a meeting room.

    "title": "A Case for Love",
    "text": "In director-writer Brian Ide’s documentary A Case for Love , Episcopal Bishop Michael Curry discusses his teachings on how unconditional, sacrificial love can be practiced in the United States. Curry famously hijacked the royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in 2018 to give a 13-minute sermon on how love can change the world. The film also features interviews with different people, including well-known personalities such as Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg and actor Sam Waterston,\nStories are presented by individuals who have seen extremely hard times. One woman describes being trapped in addiction and prostitution. Former NFL player Tim Shaw is profiled, along with his parents. Shaw was diagnosed with ALS in 2014, and his condition has been deteriorating ever since. A warrior with PTSD after combat is interviewed. All of these people describe how they were healed from their trauma by focusing outside themselves to help others. Of course, what Curry is talking about is altruism.\nThe film points out how coarse and uncaring our society has become. We see acts of violence routinely on our screens and have become immune to it to such a degree that we often feel nothing. We have also become intensely tribal. Social media has allowed us to gather virtually in like-minded groups where the greatest evil is to be “other.”\nUltimately, the documentary is a long-form version of Curry’s Royal Wedding sermon. There’s a strong focus on giving a Christian deity credit for the human impulse to help others. That is not going to resonate with everyone. Curry does make some problematic assertions. He calls out “critical race theory” as “not helping” people get along. The idea being, I suppose, that we all need to forget the past, ignore systemic inequality, and “go along to get along.” This approach radically favors the dominant paradigm. As a plan to heal society, that’s a non-starter.\n“…how unconditional, sacrificial love can be practiced…”\nA Case for Love is reductive, where there’s a poor definition of what precisely is meant by “love.” The film uses the word in a way that could mean a variety of things. If what Curry (through Ide) is driving at is basic compassion and kindness, then it makes sense. However, if the argument is that, in the name of peace and quiet, people should stop making a fuss by pushing for social justice, then we should bear in mind that graveyards are quiet and, indeed, peaceful. That’s not the peace the world needs. There’s been some commentary lately that “wokeness” pushing back on racism, sexism, misogyny, transphobia, homophobia, etc, is intolerant. That’s a weird take, given that the original positions are ones of intolerance. To paraphrase a quote: “Tolerance of intolerance is not tolerance. It’s suicide.” Justice is not hate. Capitulation is not love.\nThat said, Curry’s acceptance of a broad spectrum of people is commendable. Ide’s stories exemplifying selfless love for others are inspiring, particularly from those who have survived horrific trauma. Curry also has practical advice for each individual to do as much good as possible each day. This is the Stoic approach, and requires nothing more than baseline human empathy.\nThe message of the film, calling for kindness and openness to others and the meditation on how to turn away from narcissism, clearly has power. Pinning this to a particular religious tradition is less interesting. The viewer will ultimately decide whether A Case for Love makes a compelling case as stated or whether the film is essentially another sermon from a particular religious practice. It is, perhaps, a bit of both.",

Acá están las claves. El penal de Russo. En un partido que se encaminaba a definirse por detalles, la Gloria dejó pasar una chance clarísima. Tras recibir una falta dentro del área “Nacho” Russo quiso patear un penal que luego le tapó Durso. A partir de ahí empezó otra historia. Poco fútbol. Los encargados de generar fútbol en Instituto no tuvieron su mejor noche. Así, se abusó del pelotazo y costó encontrar a los delanteros bien posicionados. Golpe letal. Cuando todo indicaba que la Gloria se volvía a Córdoba con un 0 a 0 de sabor agridulce, llegó el golazo de Marcelo Estigarribia. Roffo no pudo hacer nada para sacar un potente remate con destino de red. Puntos bajos. Tanto Puebla como Acevedo tuvieron una floja actuación. A Lodico le costó varios minutos hacer pie. Y los delanteros tuvieron pocas chances que no supieron aprovechar. Puños de acero. Si la Gloria se quedó con el grito de gol atragantado en gran parte fue porque el arquero Tomás Durso fue la figura de la cancha. Además del penal sacó un par de pelotas importantes. Fue el mejor de toda la cancha.",

    "title": "Himanta Sarma's post on 'natural duties' of Vaishyas and Shudras trigger row, apologizes later - India News | The Financial Express",
    "text": "Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma’s social media post on the “natural duties” of Vaishyas and Shudras has triggered a massive row. Sarma later issued an apology on Thursday saying that one of his teammates had posted the verse from the Bhagwat Gita with an “incorrect translation”.In a post on X, the CM wrote, “As a routine I upload one sloka of Bhagavad Gita every morning on my social media handles. Till date, I have posted 668 slokas. Recently one of my team members posted a sloka from Chapter 18 verse 44 with an incorrect translation. As soon as I noticed the mistake, I promptly deleted the post. The state of Assam reflects a perfect picture of a casteless society, thanks to the reform movement led by Mahapurush Srimanta Sankardeva.”“If the deleted post has offended anyone, I sincerely apologize,” he added.Sarma on Thursday had posted a verse from the Bhagwat Gita which translated to “Bhagwan Shri Krishna himself describes the natural duties of Vaishya and Shudras”.He posted the video citing the 44th verse from the “Sanyas Jog” in the 18th chapter of Gita. The video explained that while agriculture, cow rearing and business are the “natural duties” of the Vaishyas, the “natural duty” of the Shudras, is to “serve” the three varnas – Brahmins, Kshtriyas and Vaishyas.Following the post, the Communist Party of India -Marxist (CPI-M) shared a screenshot of the BJP leader’s post and wrote, “We strongly denounce Assam CM Himanta Biswas’ tweet claiming that “Shudras are to serve Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas. BJP’s Manuvadi ideology in full play!”All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) leader and Lok Sabha MP Asaduddin Owaisi too launched a sharp attack on Sarma’s post reminding him that he held a constitutional post.“In a recently deleted post, Assam CM elaborated on his vision of society. “…farming, cow rearing, and commerce are natural duties of the Vaishya and serving the Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas is the natural duty of the Shudras,” Owaisi said.“Holding a constitutional position, your oath is to treat every citizen equally. It’s reflected in the unfortunate cruelty that Assam’s Muslims have faced in the past few years. Hindutva is antithetical to Liberty, Equality, Fraternity and Justice,” he added.",
