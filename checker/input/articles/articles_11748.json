    "title": "If you felt way too killable in the first Battlefield 6 beta weekend, you might not have imagined it: BF6 devs are investigating reports of instakill 'super bullets' | PC Gamer",
    "text": "(Image credit: EA) In terms of numbers, it'd be hard to argue that the first Battlefield 6 beta weekend was anything other than a success. At times, the beta attracted more than half a million concurrent Steam players —enough to beat Call of Duty's peak player count record since 2022. Our Morgan Park was impressed enough to declare that 2025 is Battlefield's year to lose .\nBut as you'd expect for a beta test, the enthusiasm came with some caveats. Throughout the weekend, frustrated players said their enjoyment of the tank shelling and shotgunning festivities was being interrupted by the so-called \"super bullet\": They'd be in a firefight where they were sinking rounds into an enemy, only to die immediately when they took what seemed like one shot in return.\nDoes something feel off about this game? from r/Battlefield On the Battlefield subreddit, beta feedback threads mention kill time inconsistency, with some players noting that \"TTK feels fine, but the 'Time to death' can feel instantaneous.\" Anecdotally, I experienced the issue throughout my beta playtime: I'd hear a single, lethal thwip and drop dead, but my post-death damage log would show that I'd taken five or six hits. That disparity has led players to speculate there's a bullet damage desync happening somewhere between the game client and multiplayer server.\nRelated Articles\nThe Battlefield 6 beta probably is running worse for you this time around: 'We'll follow up with additional updates as soon as possible'\nThe Battlefield subreddit is an endless feed of leaked Battlefield 6 gameplay, and it might be the best marketing campaign of 2025\nPeople are flipping out over recoil in Battlefield 6 because of one gun specifically designed to have no recoil in real life That's assuming, of course, that it's not just a skill issue that we're all trying to rationalize.\nThankfully, Battlefield 6 devs have provided some hope for our collective self-esteem: Yesterday, Dice principal gameplay designer Florian Le Bihan said on X that Battlefield Studios is collecting evidence of the super bullet phenomenon for investigation (via GamesRadar ).\npic.twitter.com/XIXuZPVFUy August 11, 2025\n\"If some of you have some video examples of suspected super bullet / unexpectedly fast TTD that you've recorded in the Battlefield 6 Open Beta - send my way,\" Le Bihan tweeted .\nIn his replies, you can find some clips that pretty clearly indicate something is up. The videos from users @FINAL1DY and @benbit13 are most representative of my experience: Before they're even able to pull their sights up, they've been casually deleted by what looks like one bullet that the game's treating as four.",

    "text": "近日国际金价因中东冲突等因素持续备受市场关注，不过金价走强的同时，黄金首饰股也在下挫。截至发稿， 六福集团 (00590.HK)、 周大福 (01929.HK)、 周生生 (00116.HK)分别下跌5.02%、3.51%、3.24%。\n　　以 六福集团 为例，该公司在6月17日到18日期间累计跌幅达到9.36%。若算上当前的表现，这一跌幅已超14%。\n　　根据 六福集团 近日的公告，该公司预计2025财年年内溢利较去年同期下跌约四成。\n　　公告中还指出，利润下滑主要是由于金价飙升导致的黄金对冲损失扩大，以及去年因收购 金至尊集团 而录得的一次性相关收益造成的高基数效应。\n　　撇除黄金对冲损失影响，经调整后溢利跌幅收窄至少于20%；再扣除去年一次性收益，溢利跌幅进一步收窄至少于10%。\n　　从其他公司的一季度报中也发现黄金珠宝企业在一季度的业绩表现承压。\n　　 周大福 在今年一季度的零售值同比下降11.6%，其中中国内地市场同店销售下降13.2%； 中国黄金 营收110.03亿元、同比下降39.71%，归母净利润1.35亿元、同比下降62.96%； 周大生 营收26.73亿元、同比下降47.28%，归母净利润2.52亿元、同比下滑26.12%。\n　　根据相关报道，今年一季度， 周大福 主品牌净关店397家至6423家， 周大生 净关店177家至4831家。\n　　 为何金价飙升，金店表现不佳？\n　　金价飙升直接推高企业原料采购成本，但终端售价受市场接受度限制难以同步上调，导致利润空间被挤压。例如，国际金价涨至每克560-580元时，金店零售价需覆盖加工费、租金、人工等成本，但消费者对单价超700元/克的金饰接受度骤降，销量断崖式下滑。\n　　再者金饰非刚需，消费者对高价敏感。例如，原本5000元的金链涨至6000元后，购买意愿下降。同时，消费者预期金价回调而持币观望，导致短期客流锐减。\n　　消费者转向 银行 金条或黄金ETF等金融产品，避开实体店溢价。根据相关数据，2024年国内金饰需求同比减少24%，而投资金条需求增长20%。年轻人更倾向二手金饰或K金等替代品，传统婚庆黄金消费占比从52%降至37%。\n（文章来源：财联社）",
