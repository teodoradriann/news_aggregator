    "title": "Warm weather wreaks havoc on some B.C. ski hills as lack of snow leaves trails barren - Prince George Citizen",
    "text": "VANCOUVER — British Columbia's abnormally warm winter has left local ski resorts grappling with a lack of snow during the holiday tourism season, as resorts struggle to keep runs open. Fewer than half of Whistler Blackcomb's trails are open, while Vancouver's Mount Seymour is closed entirely while it waits for better conditions. Warmth related to the El Niño climate phenomenon this week has pushed temperatures to record highs in regions including Metro Vancouver, Greater Victoria, the Sunshine Coast and the Okanagan. In Whistler, 120 kilometres north of Vancouver, Environment Canada was reporting no snow on the ground on Christmas Day, compared to 40 centimetres last Christmas. On Thursday, the Whistler Blackcomb resort reported 117 of its 275 trails were open, as well as only 42 per cent of its terrain. Warm weather has hit Metro Vancouver's three main ski hills even harder, with Cypress and Grouse mountains operating only one or two runs each. Mount Seymour closed entirely on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, pending more snow. James Shalman, general manager at Apex Mountain Resort in the Okanagans, says resorts across the province are \"definitely behind the 8-ball\" because of the warm weather, with visitors lost during the holidays unlikely to return later in the season. \"All resorts in B.C. are very reliant on the Christmas holidays as a significant portion of their financial picture for the season,\" Shalman said. \"This is not something where you can make up what you're down during Christmas break. You won't make that up later in the season, even if we get amazing snowfall in January, February, March.\" Apex on Thursday had about a third of its roughly 79 runs open, a stark contrast from 2022 when every run was open in the first week of December thanks to heavy snowfalls. Shalman said Apex had significant snow-making capacity and used it to combat the lack of precipitation, but there were weeks this month where the temperatures were too warm to make snow. \"I mean, we are essentially snow farmers,\" he says. \"We're Mother Nature-dependent, and we just have to take what we get.\" At Cypress Mountain in West Vancouver, management warned skiers of \"thin snow coverage\" for what little of the hill was open. Several resorts have been offering discounted passes and tickets to entice skiers to visit. \"Rain's the star of the show today,\" Cypress Mountain's update on Thursday said, noting that night skiing had been cancelled. Environment Canada meteorologist Brian Proctor said that in addition to El Niño, a ridge of high pressure had created a \"blocking pattern\" across much of North America. That was preventing the warm air generated by El Niño from passing over mountains and continuing inland. Proctor said it meant the warm air mass had lingered over B.C., unable to go east due to high pressure acting like \"a wall.\" He said Environment Canada's long-term forecast called for more seasonal temperatures to return for the first week of January, bringing potential snowfall to higher elevations in the Interior. But Proctor said snowfall was less certain for coastal areas in coming weeks, adding that skiers and resorts should temper expectations. \"We may see potential for some snowfall,\" Proctor says. \"But really longer term it does look like an El Niño winter at this point in time, continuing and remaining fairly significant into the early spring.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 29, 2023.

    "title": "A Tiny, Rice-Sized Pacemaker Can Biodegrade in Time, Helping Newborns",
    "text": "There is now a pacemaker smaller than a grain of rice that is designed to help the tiniest of hearts. Researchers from Northwestern University have successfully developed a pacemaker that fits in the tip of a syringe and can be inserted non-invasively into the hearts of newborn babies with congenital heart issues, according to a new study published in Nature.\nThe pacemaker works with an external flexible chest piece that monitors the heart and sends a beam of light into the chest when it detects heart rhythm issues, triggering the pacemaker. This new, biodegradable device could save countless lives in the future.\nDeveloping the World’s Smallest Pacemaker\nAccording to Columbia University, the average size of a healthy newborn baby’s heart is that of a walnut. If there is an issue with the heart, it can be difficult for doctors to give the child the care they need, as traditional pacemakers can be roughly the same size and often need some form of surgery to be implanted.\nHowever, the device the Northwestern University researcher team has created will help mitigate the risks of surgery as it can be non-invasively implanted and will biodegrade after enough time has passed.\n“We have developed what is, to our knowledge, the world’s smallest pacemaker,” said John A. Rogers, a Northwestern bioelectronics pioneer who led the device development, in a press release. “There’s a crucial need for temporary pacemakers in the context of pediatric heart surgeries, and that’s a use case where size miniaturization is incredibly important. In terms of the device load on the body — the smaller, the better.”\nThe researcher team tested their model on rodents and organ donors from deceased individuals. The study findings indicate that the tiny device works on a variety of heart sizes, not just children’s, though researchers conducted the study with children in mind.\nRead More: It May be Possible to Power Implantable Generators with Our Bodies\nCreating a Biodegradable Pacemaker\nThe idea for the device came from previous research by Rogers and colleague Igor Efimov, who is the study co-author and professor of biomedical engineering and professor of medicine (cardiology) at Northwestern.\nIn a previous study published in Nature Biotechnology, the duo worked on a different temporary pacemaker that was also biodegradable. According to the researchers, many people require pacemakers after they’ve had heart surgery to help get their hearts back into the right rhythm. These pacemakers often require wires that connect to the heart and can lead to a variety of issues when they are removed, such as infection, tissue damage, and blood clots.\nDesigned for temporary pacing, the tiny pacemaker simply dissolves when it's no longer needed. By harmlessly degrading within the body, it bypasses the need for surgical extraction\n“Wires literally protrude from the body, attached to a pacemaker outside the body,” Efimov said in a press release.\n“When the pacemaker is no longer needed, a physician pulls it out. The wires can become enveloped in scar tissue. So, when the wires are pulled out, that can potentially damage the heart muscle. That’s actually how Neil Armstrong died. He had a temporary pacemaker after a bypass surgery. When the wires were removed, he experienced internal bleeding, “ Efimov added in a press release.\nThe duo’s first biodegradable devices eliminated the need for wires that could cause damage, making pacemakers safer and more efficient. However, doctors wondered if their quarter-sized pacemaker could be made smaller so that it was less invasive to implant.\nUsing the Body’s Energy\nTo produce a smaller pacemaker, the duo had to rethink the device's power source. Their original device used near-field communication protocols, similar to what smartphones use for payment apps, and required an antenna. The antenna is what added extra space to the device.\nTo reduce the size, the duo designed a light-based scheme that would turn the pacemaker on and create the pulses the heart needed. They also used a battery that could transform the body's chemical energy into electrical energy.\n“When the pacemaker is implanted into the body, the surrounding biofluids act as the conducting electrolyte that electrically joins those two metal pads to form the battery,” Rogers said in a press release. “A very tiny light-activated switch on the opposite side from the battery allows us to turn the device from its ‘off’ state to an ‘on’ state upon delivery of light that passes through the patient’s body from the skin-mounted patch.”\nThis new device could open an array of other doors when it comes to creating other non-invasive medical devices.

    "text": "On Good Friday, behold the man\nThroughout Jesus’ ministry on Earth, he told people he was the Son of God. He demonstrated it with his words and his actions. He forgave sins and healed disease. He taught with authority and drove out demons. And yet, many didn’t believe.\nIronically, one of the most profound declarations of who Jesus was didn’t come from Jesus. It came from Pontius Pilate – the Roman governor of Judea who would preside over Jesus’ trial and hand him over to be crucified.\nThe moment comes in John 19:5 when Pilate presents Jesus to the raging crowd with the words, “Behold the man.”\nThis statement may seem insignificant, but it reflects a paradox at the heart of Christianity – a paradox that is both deeply human and divinely transcendent.\nGOOD FRIDAY: GOD TURNED ‘MORAL EVIL’ OF CHRIST’S CRUCIFIXION INTO A GIFT TO HUMANITY, SAYS CATHOLIC MISSIONARY\nWith these words, Pilate unwittingly points to the essence of Christ’s mission and the central mystery of the Christian faith. For in Jesus we behold not just a man, but the incarnate Son of God, who willingly embraced suffering and death for the redemption of humanity.\nREAD ON THE FOX NEWS APP\nFor centuries, this moment has captured the imaginations of artists all over the world, resulting in thousands of works that give us unique insight into the suffering of Jesus during his trial and crucifixion. Each is a testament to the enduring power of art to capture the profound truths of the Gospel narrative, challenging us to engage the heart together with the mind.\nThis is the inspiration behind the Museum of the Bible’s exhibit “Ecce Homo: Behold the Man.” The exhibit’s 21 pieces – including a piece by Salvador Dalí – offer a different artist’s interpretation of the concept of suffering.\nWHAT IS GOOD FRIDAY? EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW\nSome elegant and beautiful, others surreal and haunting, each painting causes us to imagine the deeper spiritual realities behind what Christ went through on Good Friday. Or, in the words of hymn writer Stuart Townsend, to “Behold the man upon the cross, my sin upon his shoulders.”\nThe crucifixion story confronts us with the humanity of Christ – his vulnerability, his anguish, his willingness to endure suffering for the sake of love. These are profoundly human experiences and emotions, things all of us are familiar with. That’s why Isaiah prophesied that Jesus would be “a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.”\nGood Friday, however, isn’t only about Jesus. We have a part to play.\nWHY GOOD FRIDAY OFFERS ‘THE BEST NEWS EVER’ FOR EASTER AND ALWAYS\nIsaiah goes on to say why Jesus suffered: “Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows.”\nLike our exhibit’s 21 artists who paint to find a reflection of ourselves in Jesus, Isaiah leads us to see ourselves in the story. He is reminding us that Christ didn’t go to the cross for himself – he went for us.\nThat is Paul’s message to believers in the book of Romans when he writes, “But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.” Jesus knew we couldn’t come to him, so in the incarnation, he came down to us even though he knew it would cost him his life.\nOn Good Friday, we behold the man – we relate to Jesus’ humanness.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nBut if that was the whole story, we’d have no reason to call Good Friday good. If Jesus was only human, we’d have no cause to hope because he would just be another of death’s victims. But it isn’t the whole story. Three days later, Christ did something else for us: He rose from the grave.\nOn Easter, we behold the risen man – we stand in awe of Christ’s divinity.\nChrist’s divine nature accomplished that which human nature by itself cannot; it defied death. That’s why Easter is the day of triumph.\nThe resurrection demonstrated beyond any doubt that Jesus was who he said he was: the Son of God. But it did something else as well. It fulfilled God’s promise of redemption.\nIt is the contrast between Good Friday and Easter Sunday that helps us grasp the weight and wonder of Christ’s passion. We will truly understand the triumph and glory of the resurrection when we have also walked with Christ through the depths of His suffering, only when we “behold the man.”\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM HARRY HARGRAVE\nOriginal article source: On Good Friday, behold the man",

    "text": "International\nQueen of Jordan: Time for US to use ‘political leverage’ to end war in Gaza\nQueen Rania al Abdullah of Jordan on Sunday called on the international community to use its “political leverage” to compel Israel to let more aid into Gaza and bring an end to the ongoing war.\nIn a pre-recorded interview on CBS News’s “Face the Nation,” moderator Margaret Brennan noted that President Biden warned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about a month ago that U.S. policy would change if Israel’s tactics didn’t. She asked whether Queen Rania thinks the U.S. is starting to use its leverage.\n“Well, look, there’s definitely been a change in tone and language. And you’re right; the President has been warning and has been trying very hard to persuade Netanyahu, for example, to not enter Rafah. But we’ve seen time and again, Israeli officials, not heeding the warnings or counsel or advice of allies,” she said.\n“So, I think it’s time that the international community, including the U.S., really use this political leverage to compel Israel to end the war and to let aid in,” she continued.\nIn recent weeks, Israel has\nexpedited the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza, although international leaders still say more is needed to stave off famine in the strip.\nQueen Rania’s comments also come amid talks of a cease-fire, as Secretary of State Antony Blinken and other U.S. officials have pressured officials in Hamas to accept the terms of a cease-fire.\n[Antony Blinken](\nhttps://thehill.com/people/antony-blinken/ ) [Benjamin Netanyahu](\nhttps://thehill.com/people/benjamin-netanyahu/ ) [Israel](\nhttps://thehill.com/tag/israel/ ) [Joe Biden](\nhttps://thehill.com/people/joe-biden/ ) [Jordan](\nhttps://thehill.com/tag/jordan/ ) [Margaret Brennan](\nhttps://thehill.com/people/margaret-brennan/ ) [queen rania](\nhttps://thehill.com/tag/queen-rania/ )\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc.

    "text": "--All CIT patients maintained platelet counts >75 x 10 9 /L at 1-week following chemotherapy plus a single dose of SCB-219M, with durable responses through at least 3-weeks--\n--Durable efficacy and PK profile expected to support convenient dosing interval of ≥2-weeks, compared to daily or weekly dosing for current treatment options in China [1] and globally [2] --\n--Phase Ⅰ b trial in CIT and CTIT (cancer treatment-induced thrombocytopenia) patients evaluating repeated dosing of SCB-219M is planned to initiate in 2024--\nCHENGDU, China , Dec. 28, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Clover Biopharmaceuticals, Ltd. (Clover; HKEX: 02197), a global commercial-stage biotechnology company, today announced positive preliminary safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics data in a Phase Ⅰ clinical trial evaluating SCB-219M, an innovative thrombopoietin receptor agonist (TPO-RA) mimetic bispecific Fc-fusion protein produced from CHO cells, for the treatment of cancer patients with chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia (CIT).\nAll cancer patients enrolled to-date (n=9) receiving chemotherapy plus a single subcutaneous dose of SCB-219M observed platelet counts maintained or recovered at >75 x 10 9 /L (threshold level for CIT) after one week, with responses durable through at least three weeks (i.e. through the chemotherapy cycle). In comparison, following administration of the same chemotherapy (but without SCB-219M) in the same cancer patients prior to enrolling into the trial, all evaluable patients had observed platelet counts drop to <75 x 10 9 /L between one and three weeks. The durable preliminary efficacy and pharmacokinetic profile observed for SCB-219M are potentially supportive of dosing intervals ≥2-weeks. If further confirmed, this profile could enable convenient dosing of SCB-219M synchronized with any given patient's chemotherapy regimen, typically 2-3 weeks per cycle. A favorable safety and tolerability profile for SCB-219M has also been observed to-date, with no serious adverse events (SAEs) and no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) identified.\nDr. Yongsheng Wang , Associate Director of West China Hospital Cancer Center at Sichuan University and Principal Investigator for the SCB-219M Phase Ⅰ Trial commented: \"We are encouraged by the Phase Ⅰ results to-date for SCB-219M, and we look forward to the continued evaluation of SCB-219M, as we believe the management of CIT remains a pressing unmet medical need for patients undergoing cancer treatment.\"\n\"We are pleased to announce positive Phase Ⅰ results for SCB-219M demonstrating rapid and durable efficacy along with a favorable safety profile,\" said Dr. Peng Liang , Chairman, Chief Scientific Officer of Clover and inventor of SCB-219M. \"The preliminary results suggest that SCB-219M has a potentially differentiated profile compared to the current standard of care treatments for CIT and CTIT. In contrast to current biologic treatment options for CIT in China requiring daily injections [1] and globally requiring weekly injections [2] , the durable efficacy and pharmacokinetics of SCB-219M observed to-date could enable convenient dosing synchronized with any given patient's chemotherapy regimen.\"\nThe Phase Ⅰ trial is a multi-center, open-label, dose escalation and dose expansion study, that is exploring the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of SCB-219M administered subcutaneously in cancer patients with CIT. In addition to West China Hospital Cancer Center at Sichuan University, other participating sites in this clinical trial include Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital and Chengdu No. 6 People's Hospital. A Phase Ⅰb trial evaluating repeated dosing of SCB-219M in CIT and CTIT patients is planned to initiate in 2024.\nCIT is a serious, chemotherapy-associated complication observed in a wide range of cancer patients. Incidence of CIT can occur in greater than 50% [3] of patients undergoing standard chemotherapy regiments, and can have detrimental impacts on treatment outcome, resulting in chemotherapy dose delay or dose reduction, and potentially fatal bleeding events.\n1.

    "text": "New Hampshire’s population grew by a higher percentage than every New England state except Maine and outpaced the nation between 2020 and 2023, according to new Census Bureau estimates. The ramifications include more potential workers — and more people looking for housing in a tight market. “Presumably more bodies mean more bodies available to work,” said Realtor Greg Powers. Growth also can put more strain on community infrastructure, requiring more sewer and water lines as shops and houses are added, said Powers, who works at Keller Williams Realty Metropolitan in Bedford. New Hampshire’s population reached 1,402,054 on July 1, an increase of 24,500 residents or 1.8% since April 1, 2020. All 10 New Hampshire counties gained population during those years, compared with 52% of counties nationwide, according to Ken Johnson, senior demographer with the Carsey School of Public Policy at the University of New Hampshire. “Migration fueled all the population growth, a net influx of nearly 31,000 — most from other areas of the U.S.,” Johnson said in an email. “Nearly 80 percent of these migrants came from within the United States, but the state also received a significant number of immigrants,” Johnson wrote in a separate research brief. “Such migration gains result both from attracting migrants to the state and retaining existing residents,” Johnson wrote. “This emphasizes the importance of developing policies that encourage current residents to remain and new migrants to come to New Hampshire, as well as policies that ensure New Hampshire communities are prepared to support these migrants.” The state experienced 6,600 more deaths than births in the past three years, he said. Powers pointed out that many of the new arrivals came from states with higher home prices. “They had a different perception of value,” Powers said. “What they spent $700,000 on in Massachusetts might be 450 to 500 (thousand) here. They didn’t blink at making an offer over the list price because it was still cheaper than they could get in Mass.” Slower growth in 2023 New Hampshire’s population grew at a slower rate last year. The state gained 3,100 residents last year, compared with 11,500 and 8,800 in the two preceding years, according to Johnson. Carroll County had the largest percentage gain, growing by 4.7% since 2020. Rockingham County had the largest numerical gain — 6,500. Powers called Rockingham County, which includes Portsmouth and the Seacoast, “a very appealing area, and people coming up from Massachusetts, Connecticut and New York, those prices, although high for New Hampshire, didn’t seem all that high for what they could get here.” That, however, makes it more difficult for many people living in the state to buy a new house. Eight counties saw population gains between July 2022 and July 2023. Hillsborough County, which includes Manchester and Nashua, and Coos County had “minimal population losses” that year, but overall gains during the three-year period, Johnson said. Even before the pandemic hit in March 2020, the state was recording more annual deaths than births. ‘Largest migration’ Hillsborough was the only county that recorded more births than deaths in that three-year span. “The largest migration gain (6.9%) was in Carroll County, which has long attracted recreational and amenity migrants, including many from large urban areas,” Johnson wrote. Coos County’s overall population grew by 0.4%. “In northernmost Coos County, where deaths far exceeded births, migration was sufficient to produce a modest population gain,” Johnson wrote. “Even in Hillsborough County, where births exceeded deaths, migration produced nearly 90 percent of the population gain.”",

    "text": "Internacional El papa necesita “reposo absoluto” y no pronunciará el Ángelus mañana domingo Ante el padecimiento de una bronquitis persistente, al papa Francisco se le ha imposibilitado participar en actividades.\nACAN-EFE\n15 de febrero de 2025\n|\n16:03h El papa Francisco interrumpió su homilía el 9 de febrero de 2025 por dificultades respiratorias. (Foto Prensa Libre: EFE) El papa Francisco necesita “reposo absoluto” para facilitar su recuperación, por lo que no pronunciará la oración del Ángelus el domingo 16 de febrero, luego de ser ingresado este viernes al hospital Gemelli de Roma por una infección en las vías respiratorias, informó el Vaticano.\n“Para facilitar su recuperación, el personal médico le ha prescrito reposo absoluto, por lo que el Santo Padre no dirigirá la oración del Ángelus mañana domingo 16 de febrero, aunque ha decidido enviar el texto para su publicación”, indicó.\nEl pontífice, de 88 años, “descansó toda la noche” y “no presentó ningún episodio febril”, mientras que “las pruebas realizadas durante el día confirmaron la infección de las vías respiratorias”.\n“La terapia se modificó ligeramente sobre la base de nuevos hallazgos microbiológicos. Los exámenes de laboratorio de hoy constataron la mejora de algunos valores”, indica un comunicado, que añade que “durante la mañana recibió la Sagrada Eucaristía, luego alternó el reposo con la oración y la lectura”.\nAdemás, Francisco “ha sido informado de los numerosos mensajes de cercanía y afecto que ha recibido y expresa su gratitud, al tiempo que pide que se siga rezando por él”, concluye el comunicado.\nEl portavoz vaticano, Matteo Bruni, ya había explicado al mediodía que el papa había pasado una primera noche “tranquila” en el hospital, donde pudo “dormir bien”, mientras que por la mañana desayunó con normalidad y leyó los periódicos.\nFrancisco sufre una bronquitis persistente que en los últimos días le había imposibilitado leer algunos discursos y que finalmente obligó a hospitalizarle para someterle a exámenes diagnósticos y continuar el tratamiento.\n“El Santo Padre, tras la persistencia de la bronquitis de estos días, se ha sometido a unos análisis especializados y ha comenzado la terapia farmacológica hospitalaria”, indicó anoche el Vaticano.\nLos análisis “demuestran una infección en las vías respiratorias”, detalló en un comunicado, en el que añadía que sus condiciones clínicas eran “discretas” (moderadas) y que presentaba “una alteración febril leve”.\nA principios de febrero, el papa explicó que sufría un “fuerte resfriado”, como él mismo dijo en la audiencia general del miércoles 5 de febrero y en los días sucesivos mantuvo sus audiencias, pero en su residencia, la Casa Santa Marta, para no trasladarse al palacio pontificio “debido a una bronquitis”, informó la Santa Sede.\nAunque las dificultades respiratorias le habían obligado a interrumpir sus lecturas en varios actos, el papa quería evitar el ingreso hospitalario, según varios medios, que afirman que Francisco visitó hace unos días el centro del Gemelli en la céntrica isla Tiberina para examinarse los bronquios, aunque sin que trascendiese públicamente.\nA pesar de la persistencia de la bronquitis, Francisco presidió el pasado domingo en la plaza de San Pedro, en un fría jornada ventosa, la misa para las fuerzas de seguridad.\nSin embargo, el Jubileo de los Artistas, que comienza hoy, le imponía tres días de intensa actividad, incluyendo una visita el lunes próximo a los famosos estudios de cine de Cinecittà, que ha quedada cancelada.\nFinalmente, para evitar que la afección se agudizara y derivase en una neumonía, el papa aceptó el consejo de sus médicos para ingresar en el Gemelli y seguir allí el tratamiento más adecuado, según las mismas fuentes.\nEsta es la cuarta vez que el papa tiene que ser hospitalizado en el Gemelli.\nEn el pasado, el pontífice argentino ha sufrido problemas de gripe y respiratorios que incluso le obligaron a estar ingresado tres días en marzo de 2023 y en noviembre de 2023 estos problemas respiratorios le obligaron a cancelar su viaje a Dubái.",

    "title": "80% in just 21 minutes: Hyundai expands ultra-fast EV charging network in India",
    "text": "[Hyundai](/topic/hyundai)Motor India is taking a significant leap towards making electric vehicles more accessible across the country. The company has recently expanded its ultra-fast [EV charging network](/topic/ev-charging-network)by setting up 11 new charging stations in various cities and along major highways. These new charging stations are strategically placed to benefit cities like Mumbai, Pune, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Gurugram, and Bangalore. They are also located along highways such as Delhi-Chandigarh, Delhi-Jaipur, Hyderabad-Vijayawada, Mumbai-Surat, and Mumbai-Nashik.\nThe aim of these charging stations is to provide quick and convenient charging options for electric vehicle owners. Most of them operate 24/7, catering to both city dwellers and long-distance travelers. The charging stations utilize advanced technology that enables vehicles to be charged rapidly and efficiently. For example, the Hyundai IONIQ 5, one of Hyundai's electric vehicle models, can be charged from 10% to 80% in just 21 minutes using these chargers.\nTo make the charging process even more convenient, customers can use the MyHyundai app. The app allows users to discover charging stations, navigate to them, pre-book charging slots, make digital payments, and monitor the charging status. Looking ahead, Hyundai plans to further expand its ultra-fast charging network to 10 or more new locations by 2024. Additionally, as part of an agreement with the Government of Tamil Nadu, Hyundai aims to install 100 charging stations by 2027.\n(You can now subscribe to our\nEconomic Times WhatsApp channel) [Business News](/news), [Breaking News](/breakingnewslist.cms) [Budget 2024 News](/budget), [Budget 2024 Live Coverage](/news/newsblogs/budget-live-news-updates-india-budget-2024-nirmala-sitharaman-live-speech-announcements-interim-budget-impacts-railways-education-auto-healthcare-latest-news-1-feb-2024/liveblog/107302765.cms), Events and [Latest News](/news/latest-news)Updates on [The Economic Times](/).)\nDownload\nThe Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.

    "text": "Ancora caldo record nelle Marche, ecco le città più roventi. Oggi scatta l’ordinanza Ancona, 1 agosto 2024 - Continua il caldo record nelle Marche. Lorenzo Tedici, meteorologo del sito www.iLMeteo.it, conferma l&#039;ingombrante presenza di Caronte al Centro-Sud: ad Ascoli Piceno e Macerata, le città della regione in cui si registrano le temperature più roventi, saranno raggiunti almeno i 38 gradi. Per il resto i 37 gradi saranno diffusi e “normali” un po’ su tutto il territorio. Un caldo eccezionale in aperto contrasto con i temporali anche forti previsti invece nel Nord Italia. Condizioni meteo a rischio Tra oggi e domani, in base alle previsioni meteo della Protezione civile regionale, sono previste “temperature e condizioni meteorologiche a rischio in particolare per i sottosistemi di persone suscettibili”. Con la relativa allerta dei servizi sanitari e sociali. In pratica il livello di pericolo da ondate di calore segna arancione e bisogna prestare attenzione soprattutto per anziani e bambini. Media anche la previsione di pericolosità di incendi boschivi. Caldo: ecco le città più roventi Il termometro tra oggi e domani segna picchi di 39 gradi a Ascoli Piceno, 38 a Fabriano (Ancona), 37 a Fermo, 39 a Jesi (Ancona). Fino a domenica per Ascoli e Jesi si prevedono costantemente 38 gradi. I consigli per proteggersi dal caldo Si raccomanda di seguire i dieci consigli utili da parte del ministero della salute per contrastare le ondate di calore sono: - Non uscire nelle ore più calde (evitare l’esposizione diretta al sole nelle ore più calde della giornata, ovvero tra le 11 e le 18); - Migliorare l’ambiente domestico e di lavoro: la misura più semplice è la schermatura delle finestre esposte a sud e a sud-ovest con tende e oscuranti regolabili (persiane, veneziane) che blocchino il passaggio della luce, ma non quello dell’aria; - Bere molti liquidi; - Moderare l’assunzione di bevande contenenti caffeina, evitare bevande alcoliche; - Fare pasti leggeri; - Vestire comodi e leggeri; - In auto ricordarsi di ventilare l’abitacolo prima di iniziare un viaggio, anche se la vettura è dotata di un impianto di ventilazione. In questo caso, regolare la temperatura su valori di circa 5 gradi inferiori alla temperatura esterna evitando di orientare le bocchette della climatizzazione direttamente sui passeggeri. Se ci si deve mettere in viaggio, evitare le ore più calde della giornata (specie se l’auto non è climatizzata) e tenere sempre in macchia una scorta d’acqua. Non lasciare mai neonati, bambini o animali in macchina, neanche per brevi periodi; - Evitare l’esercizio fisico nelle ore più calde della giornata; - Offrire assistenza a persone con maggiore rischio (come gli anziani che vivono da soli, i lattanti ecc.); - Dare molta acqua fresca agli animali domestici e lasciarla in una zona ombreggiata. L’ordinanza anticaldo di Acquaroli Tra l’altro si ricorda che da oggi è entrata in vigore l’ordinanza anticaldo del presidente della Regione Francesco Acquaroli sulle “misure di prevenzione per l’attività lavorativa all’aperto e in condizioni di esposizione prolungata al sole nel settore agricolo e florovivaistico, nonché nei cantieri edili e stradali”. Il provvedimento è valido fino alle ore 24 del 31 agosto, limitatamente ai giorni e alle aree del territorio regionale in cui la mappa del rischio indicata sul sito e riferita a: “lavoratori esposti al sole” con “attività fisica intensa” ore 12, segnali un livello di rischio “alto”. In questo specifico caso sarà vietata l&#039;attività lavorativa all&#039;aperto e in condizioni di esposizione prolungata al sole, dalle 12.30 alle 16.",
