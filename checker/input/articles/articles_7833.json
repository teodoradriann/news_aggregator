    "title": "White supremacist pleads guilty to murder in sprawling jailhouse conspiracy as Aryan Brotherhood trial looms",
    "text": "Brant “Two Scoops” Daniel, a member of the Aryan Brotherhood prison gang in California , copped a deal with prosecutors and pleaded guilty to murder in aid of racketeering this week, making him the latest gang member to peel off from a group of over a dozen white supremacists indicted in a sweeping multistate drug-and-murder-fueled jailhouse conspiracy. Sixteen members of the prison gang, allegedly led by Ronald “Renegade” Yandell and William “Billy” Sylvester, were charged in 2019, according to unsealed court records obtained Thursday by Law&Crime. Federal prosecutors indicted them and 14 others — including Daniel — that June, alleging they engaged in schemes from 2011 to 2016 that relied on contraband cellphones smuggled into their prison cells to sell heroin or peddle methamphetamines. And when the gang members weren’t selling drugs, DEA investigators claim they were busy ordering hits on their enemies and anyone they deemed in violation of the so-called Aryan Brotherhood “code of conduct.” Investigators said they were able to uncover evidence to bring the charges through an extensive seizure of the defendant’s devices as well as widespread wiretapping. In court records that offer explicit detail of his confession to murder in aid of racketeering, Daniel admitted that while incarcerated at the Salinas Valley Prison in October 2016, he stabbed fellow inmate Zachary Scott to death while they were both “on the yard.” Ignoring commands to stand down from swarming guards as he stabbed Scott 17 times throughout his “arms, shoulders, abdomen, chest, ribcage and face,” Daniel admitted in the plea that he inflicted puncture wounds so severe that at one point, he watched his prison-made weapon go through Scott’s back and “out his chest.” “Right through him,” Daniel told one investigator. “Right through him.” He recalled telling approaching guards: “Yeah I did it. It was me. I did it and that’s all I have to say about that.” He hit Scott so hard, he broke his knuckle, he added. Daniel also admitted that there was another individual he would have killed that day and boasted during a police interview, court records show, that “you guys would have had a double homicide.” Daniel said he and another inmate murdered Scott because the man had “failed to carry out the killing of fellow inmate that Daniel had assigned to [him] as a white inmate subordinate” to the Aryan Brotherhood, Daniel himself and others at Salinas. An intercepted “kite” or a secret message passed from Daniel to another inmate during this time also showed him taking credit for Scott’s murder, the plea deal notes, while lamenting how Scott had failed to kill another inmate in his prison cell versus “on the yard” as Daniel had ordered him. Scott had also lost valuable drugs that belonged to him and the Brotherhood, Daniel admitted as part of the plea deal. Several of the defendants have pleaded guilty already as the racketeering case slowly snakes its way to trial. The trial is expected to start in late February 2024 and according to a statement from prosecutors, with Daniel’s plea out of the way, only five of the 16 originally charged gang members are now on track to face a jury before presiding Chief U.S. District Judge Kimberly J. Mueller. The defendants who will stand trial — for now — include accused leaders Yandell and Sylvester as well as codefendants Daniel “Danny” Troxell, Pat “Big Pat” Brady, and Jason “Jake” Corbett. As for Daniel, 49, by pleading guilty to murder in aid of racketeering this week, he received a sentence of life in federal prison instead of state prison. He is currently detained at a California State Prison facility known as “New Folsom.” Federal prisons typically have higher security measures in place and are more restrictive to inmates given that the population is usually serving longer sentences for more violent or serious offenses. An attorney for Daniel did not immediately return a request for comment to Law&Crime seeking further detail on why Daniel went this route, but The Sacramento Bee reported that Daniel has historically accused state guards of harassing him or even attempting to frame him for the death of other inmates. Daniel’s lawyer also told the California-based outlet that while Daniel may have struck a deal, it wasn’t to cooperate with prosecutors when they make their case next year. Daniel had already pleaded guilty to Scott’s murder in 2017, the lawyer said, and he was already serving 30 years to life for that charge. Daniel struck a deal to spare himself and his family the “expense and burden” of a jury trial, the attorney said. Daniel was also previously convicted for attempted murder in 1995. Prosecutors opted not to seek the death penalty against the defendants — who are suspected in the brutal murders of at least five inmates — this fall. Have a tip we should know? [email protected]",

    "title": "Anti-Semitism: Federal Criminal Police Office reports significantly more crimes since Hamas attack - Teller Report",
    "text": "Enlarge image Police cordon after a Molotov cocktail attack on a synagogue in Berlin (October 18) Photo: Fabrizio Bensch / REUTERS The German Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) has recorded a drastic increase in anti-Semitic crimes since Hamas' terrorist attack on Israel on October 7. In connection with the Israel-Gaza war alone, more than 21,1100 offenses were registered in the criminal police reporting service for cases of politically motivated crime by December , as a BKA spokesman told the dpa news agency on request. It was mainly a matter of damage to property and incitement to hatred. This is significantly more than in each of the first three quarters of this year, for which the Federal Ministry of the Interior last published exact figures in November. According to the report, 558 anti-Semitic crimes were registered in the first quarter, 609 in the second quarter and 540 in the third. These figures include all offences – those motivated by left-wing and right-wing extremists as well as those from the categories of \"religious ideology\" and \"foreign ideology\". The more than 1100,2023 crimes since the beginning of October, on the other hand, are only those recorded in connection with the escalation of the Middle East conflict. The total number is therefore likely to be significantly higher. As of November 2874, a total of 88, anti-Semitic crimes were recorded last year, including acts of violence. Warnings against open anti-Semitism Shortly before Christmas, the Federal Government Commissioner for Anti-Semitism, Felix Klein, expressed concern about the security situation of Jews in Germany. \"Not since the Holocaust have Jews in Germany been in such great danger as they are today,\" he told the Funke newspapers. Central Council President Josef Schuster also declared that since Hamas' attack on Israel, there has been a \"dramatic intensification of open anti-Semitism on German streets.\" Schuster told the Rheinische Post that attacks on Jews had recently \"unfortunately become more numerous.\" It is \"worrying that there is now more palpable anti-Semitism than in previous years.\" Especially since the attack on Israel, there has been a \"dramatic intensification of open anti-Semitism on German streets.\" According to Schuster, this is particularly about Islamist anti-Semitism. jok/dpa",

    "text": "Subscribe to Our Newsletter\nSACRAMENTO – California Attorney General Rob Bonta today announced the sentencing of Chris Vrame, who embezzled over $4.3 million from investors and a nonprofit. From 2013 through 2017, Vrame embezzled about $3.6 million in investor money from a real estate venture named KV Sierra Vista where he was the managing member. Over the same time period, Vrame embezzled approximately $731,000 from a nonprofit named Conservancy to Protect the Land (CPL), where he served as executive director. Vrame paid full restitution to both KV Sierra Vista and CPL prior to sentencing.\n“This case was an excellent example of the justice system working how it was intended,” said Attorney General Bonta. “The victims of this embezzlement have been given back what was stolen and the guilty party has taken responsibility and been held responsible. I am proud of my team for all their work on this case and am glad this was a positive outcome.”\nVrame pleaded no contest to two felony counts of embezzlement and was sentenced to 364 days in jail, two years felony probation, and was ordered to pay $30,000 in restitution fines. The prosecution of Vrame was handled by the California Department of Justice’s Special Prosecution Section (SPS). SPS investigates and prosecutes complex criminal cases, primarily related to financial, securities, mortgage, and environmental fraud.",

    "text": "NORTH CASTLE, New York (WABC) -- A North Castle homeowner is fed up over a rat infestation that has taken over her property and the neighborhood. Holly Mottola spoke to Eyewitness News about how her backyard is now full of bat stations and traps. She also acknowledged the horrible body count of rats she's found. \"We would catch about 16 in one night,\" Mottola said. Mottola says she spent over $1,000 trying to mitigate the infestation that started a month ago. Her house borders a gas station, where recent video showed rats scattering when the fence was kicked in. \"I tried to notify the gas station owner,\" she said. \"Two days I went in there to speak to him, I couldn't get in touch with him.\" Mottola says the rodents have built tunnels to her property, but the owner of the gas station, Asif Muhammad, insisted he's keeping the area clean. \"We've been taking care of everything,\" Muhammad said. \"These guys are coming every week. This is the best we can do. You can't just eliminate them in a day.\" Muhammad acknowledged he is also working with an exterminator, and blames the restaurant that just opened next door to his station as to why the rodents presence has increased. Neighbors say they doubt the restaurant is the source. \"I just want everything maintained so we can use our properties again, because all the neighbors are being impacted, it's not just myself... it's the whole neighborhood,\" Mottola said. The Westchester County Health Department conducted a surprise inspection on Wednesday, and said they are monitoring the situation to see if the mitigation efforts are working.

    "text": "Photo: 4u4me / iStock / Getty Images\nResidents in North Jersey are bracing themselves for a wet weekend. The National Weather Service issued a flood watch for Sussex and Warren Counties from tomorrow morning through Sunday morning. Other areas, including Bergen, Morris, and Passaic Counties, could see up to three inches of rainfall tonight through tomorrow night.\nThe rain is expected to start pouring across North Jersey by tomorrow morning and should end by Sunday morning. While Sussex and Warren Counties may see some snow mixed with the rain, no accumulation is forecasted.\nAccording to the National Weather Service, parts of the shore may be hit even harder with up to four inches of rain during the storm. As the system moves out of the area Saturday night, strong winds are also expected to develop which may result in downed trees and power outages.\nDespite these weather conditions marking a soggy start to spring, there's good news on the horizon. The forecast for Sunday throughout the region calls for sunny skies with temperatures in the upper 40s. This will lead into highs in the 50s at the start of next week.\nThis upcoming forecast continues a trend of heavy bouts of rain in North Jersey since late 2023. The wet weather has previously prompted visits from Gov. Phil Murphy to areas like Little Falls amid storms that caused flooding in nearby rivers such as Passaic River.\nListen to 102.3 WSUS , 103.7 NNJ , and 106.3 The Bear for the latest weather updates.",
