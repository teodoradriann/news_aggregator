    "text": "The It Ends With Us movie ending is sure to ruffle some feathers.\nNow that It Ends With Us is premiering , both longtime fans of the book and people new to the story will be watching the film adaptation.\nThe novel, inspired by the author’s own experiences with her parents’ abusive relationship, is controversial. The film was always going to ignite controversy, too.\nPerhaps the most incendiary part of It Ends With Us is the ending itself. What should movie-goers expect?\nBlake Lively attends the “It Ends With Us” New York Premiere at AMC Lincoln Square Theater on August 06, 2024. (Photo Credit: Cindy Ord/Getty Images) What is the ‘It Ends With Us’ movie about? (Spoiler Warning!) It Ends With Us is an adaptation of the 2016 novel by the same name. The novel is by Colleen Hoover. The screenplay is by Christy Hall.\nThe film stars Blake Lively as the main character, Lily Bloom. Initially appearing as a romance story, Lily falls in love with Ryle Kincaid and the two hit it off right away.\nHowever, the story quickly takes a dark turn, as Lily notices too many similarities between her marriage to Ryle and her parents’ abusive marriage. At one point, he pushes her. Another time, he shoves her down the stairs.\nHugh Jackman , Blake Lively, and Ryan Reynolds attend the “It Ends With Us” New York Premiere at AMC Lincoln Square Theater on August 06, 2024. (Photo Credit: Cindy Ord/Getty Images) In addition to spoilers, beware of graphic depictions of domestic violence and sexual assault Every abuser has a sob story, some genuine and others fabricated. In Ryle’s case, he accidentally shot and killed his brother as a child. Now, as an adult, he has outbursts of intense rage — flying into abusive fits and directing his explosive violence at his wife.\nOne particularly horrific moment is when Ryle invades Lily’s privacy, rifling through her journals. This is an extremely common behavior in abusive partners (and abusive parents, exes, and more). In this case, her childhood diaries mention her platonic friend, Atlas Corrigan — and he becomes convinced that she is having an affair.\nRyle’s abuse escalates. He sexually assaults her and, when she attempts to fend him off, headbutts her with such force that she loses consciousness.\nBlake Lively attends the UK Gala Screening of “It Ends With Us” at the Odeon Luxe Leicester Square on August 08, 2024. (Photo Credit: Lia Toby/Getty Images) ‘It Ends With Us’ describes an all-too-realistic nightmare Lily does escape Ryle, calling Atlas to come to her rescue. Atlas takes her to the hospital — where Lily discovers that she is pregnant with her abuser’s child.\nUnderstandably, Lily does not want to raise her child in an abusive household. That is how she grew up.\nHowever, she ultimately decides to stay with Ryle through the final months of her pregnancy. She does confide in Atlas about Ryle’s abuse, which he had already suspected. And, after giving birth to their daughter, she files to divorce the monster so that her daughter will not have to grow up in the same household. Later, co-parenting with Ryle, she and Atlas signal a desire to form a relationship as adults.\nWhy is ‘It Ends With Us’ controversial? Any story about domestic abuse is going to ignite controversy. No one’s experience is the same. Some survivors will have had it worse (always, always, someone had it worse). Others may find that the abuser is too sympathetic, or less sympathetic than the abusers they’ve experienced.\nMany book-readers do not understand why Lily allowed Ryle to remain in her life for as long as she did. Critics say that they would have ended the relationship as soon as he shoved her, or at least as soon as he pushed her down the stairs.\nAdditionally, there is controversy over Lily’s decision to allow Ryle to co-parent their daughter. Obviously, an abuser is an abuser. Even if he never directs his violent rage at Emmy (which is a big if ), she’s sure to witness it when he dates again.\nWhy did the author make these choices? Unfortunately, in the book and in the movie, It Ends With Us ‘ ending is painfully realistic for millions of domestic violence survivors.\nAbusers often target people who have experienced abuse in the past. That is realistic, and what Ryle does in teh book and in the movie. Even though Lily resented her parents for their abusive marriage, it clearly paved the way for Ryle to try to convince her that his treatment of her was somehow normal or okay.\nColleen Hoover, who took inspiration from her father’s abuse of her mother when writing It Ends With Us , clearly understood that. Abusers are manipulative people, and survivors can still make bizarre choices. It’s always good to remember that fictional stories are not guidebooks to how real people should behave. This is not a morality play.\nOh Queen Jenny Slate… so something DEFINITELY happened on the set of It Ends With Us and everyone hates Justin Baldoni. I need to get to the bottom of it pic.twitter.com/d28z41dHpP\n— Meech (@MediumSizeMeech) August 8, 2024 Is there ‘It Ends With Us’ movie drama? It appears that there’s major behind-the-scenes drama on It Ends With Us . One of the lead actors (Justin Baldoni) is also the director, but appears to be at odds with much of the cast. Or … maybe fans on Twitter and Instagram are just reading too much into it.\nWhatever is afoot, people are comparing this press tour to the Don’t Worry Darling debacle.\nCan’t we all just enjoy a Blake Lively film? Well, given the subject matter, “enjoy” might not be the right word. But the early reviews say that solid acting is one of the movie’s succeses.",

    "title": "High Court to re-hear case over $230k Islamic law dower payment",
    "text": "One of New Zealand's higher courts has for the first time had to consider the rules around Islamic marriage contracts.\nThe Court of Appeal this month ordered that a case about a Muslim couple and their marriage agreement be re-heard by the High Court.\nThe former couple were married in United Arab Emirates (UAE) a decade ago, and both continue to live in New Zealand as they intended at the time of their wedding - despite their divorce in 2016.\nThe terms of their nikah, or marriage contract, stated Rafid Salih would be required to pay his wife Rahla Almarzooqi about NZ$230,000 upon his death or divorce.\n\"The husband is required to provide a gift (mahr) to the wife. The mahr is usually of monetary value and is given in part before the marriage (the \"prompt\" mahr) and in part on the earlier of death or divorce (the \"deferred\" mahr),\" the Court of Appeal judgment explained.\n\"It is the first time the question of enforceability of a nikah has been considered by this Court.\"\nThe case hinges on which law is most applicable - UAE law, New Zealand law or Sharia law.\nA court in Dubai found Salih mistreated his wife, and ordered him to pay in full. However, his lawyers argue that he should only be liable if Almarzooqi can prove her allegations of misconduct in a New Zealand court.\nThe High Court earlier ruled the contract should be considered under the UAE law, because that was where the couple chose to be married.\n\"As it happens, however, the form of the marriage and the applicable law is not unique to UAE but is common to Muslim marriages wherever they occur. The reality is that had they married in New Zealand the form, and the nikah, would be the same,\" a judgment from May last year said.\n\"[Salih] submits that the mahr is only payable under Sharia law if the husband initiates the divorce or the wife obtains divorce via the proof of harm route. If that were correct it would suggest that divorce processes and grounds are significant to the terms of the contract. That in turn would suggest, in my view, that a Sharia law system is more likely to be the proper law of the contract, since those concepts are not, for example, part of New Zealand divorce law, and would be unlikely to be recognised.\"\nIt noted UAE law was sourced in Sharia law. Justice Simon France also found the nikah would be similarly enforceable and the mahr payable, if New Zealand law applied.\nHowever, the Court of Appeal has ruled the nikah should be considered under New Zealand law, instead of relying on the findings of the Dubai court. Experts could help inform the court of the relevant principles of Sharia law.\n\"The nikah is enforceable under New Zealand law and expert evidence as to the cultural context in which the contract was entered into may be relied on to interpret its meaning,\" the court said in a judgment this month.\n\"If the High Court ultimately finds that, properly interpreted, the nikah requires Mr Salih to pay the mahr only upon proof of his misconduct, Ms Almarzooqi will need to prove that fact.\"",

    "title": "California Bans ‘Reusable’ Plastic Grocery Bags, Sues Exxon for Alleged Decades of Deception About Plastic Recycling",
    "text": "An X-ray of the world would reveal plastic in nearly every corner. Brightly colored litter is even found in our bodies; humans consume a considerable amount of microplastics each week — usually not enough to equal a credit card, as often claimed , but still enough to be detected in human lung tissue and linked to cardiovascular risks .\nWhile it may be too late to fully reverse the world’s rampant plastic pollution, it is not too late to reduce it and pursue reparations. California is leading the charge in the war against plastic with new battlefronts at grocery stores and in the courtroom.\nChecking Out Governor Gavin Newsom just signed SB 1053, from Sen. Catherine Blakespear (D-Encinitas), into law, which will eliminate plastic bags at California grocery store checkout lanes.\nThose heavy-duty, supposedly “reusable” plastic bags — a product of a loophole in the state’s first 2016 ban against single-use plastic bags — will be a thing of the past come January 2026.\nAfter that, no more “paper or plastic.” The only options for hauling your groceries will be recyclable paper bags or certified reusable bags.\nAs for Santa Barbara’s plastic-bag stock and stake in the matter, it is unclear. Plastic bags do not stay whole when thrown into the trash, so knowing how many are in our landfill is difficult to determine, said the County’s recycling czar Carlyle Johnston.\n“I can say that film plastic accounts for 7.07 percent of what is in our trash cans,” he said.\nStill, the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors endorsed the new bill back in August , and Santa Barbara–based environmental groups, such as the Community Environmental Council (CEC), are “thrilled” with the bill’s passing.\n“CEC supported this law, as we have supported and advocated for many state and regional laws that reduce single-use plastic at the source,” said Kathi King, CEC’s director of climate education and leadership.\n“With less than 10 percent of plastic getting recycled, it’s clear that we are not going to recycle our way out of the human health, marine health, and litter impacts of plastic and that corporations need to be held accountable.”\nRecycling Fallacy In the courtroom, Attorney General Rob Bonta filed a lawsuit against oil giant ExxonMobil — the world’s largest producer of polymers used to make single-use plastic — for the company’s role in “exacerbating the global plastics pollution crisis.”\nOver the course of a “decades-long campaign of deception,” the Department of Justice alleges, Exxon cooked up a plastic-pollution solution. But it was all just a mirage sold by “slick marketing,” the DOJ says.\nThe public was led to believe that it was a-okay to buy and use as much plastic stuff as they wanted, as long as they recycled it afterward.\nIn reality, no more than 9 percent of plastic waste in the U.S. has ever been recycled. A lot of it could not be recycled in the first place.\nSince at least 1998, Exxon has peddled a false reality designed to mislead consumers that recycling “could and would solve the ever-growing plastic waste crisis,” while knowing that mechanical, or “advanced” recycling — using heat to break down and reuse plastics — will “never be able to process more than a tiny fraction of plastic waste it produces,” the lawsuit states.\nEnter: fruit cups. In June, ProPublica challenged Exxon’s claims that it had transformed discarded plastic into new fruit cups through an “advanced” chemical recycling method, and showed just how little recycled content actually winds up in products made that way. However, companies like Exxon inflate that percentage in their marketing — a part of what Bonta calls the company’s “biggest greenwashing campaign.”\nIn April 2022, Bonta launched his investigation into the role of oil companies in worsening the plastic pollution crisis. That included subpoenaing “never-before-seen” documents allegedly proving ExxonMobil knew about the ineffectiveness of plastic recycling.\nDuring a press conference last Monday, Bonta called plastic recycling “a farce, a lie, a deceit.” He said, “One thing ExxonMobil actually does is recycle its lies.”\nThe truth is that the infrastructure, market, and technology for recycling the fossil-fuel-based plastic products, especially those of the single-use variety (like plastic bags), are “woefully inadequate” for the amount of plastic Exxon produces, according to court documents.\nIn 2021, Exxon contributed more “virgin” plastic polymers (a k a the raw, non-recycled stuff) bound for single-use plastic than any other petrochemical company — more than six million tons, or roughly equivalent to two trillion single-use plastic cups in 2021 alone.\nIn a statement to reporters, an ExxonMobil spokesperson argued that advanced recycling works. “To date, we’ve processed more than 60 million pounds of plastic waste into usable raw materials, keeping it out of landfills,” they said. Instead, the statement blamed California officials for an ineffective state recycling system. “Instead of suing us, they could have worked with us to fix the problem,” the statement said.\nIn 2022 alone, plastic waste in California amounted to the equivalent of dumping 20 to 30 garbage trucks of plastic waste per day into the state’s landscapes and waterways.\nAdditionally, the Attorney General’s office says that most of the plastic items collected on the annual California Coastal Cleanup Day can be traced to ExxonMobil’s polymer resins .\nAnd the consequences on the state’s environment, wildlife, and residents seem woefully insurmountable.\nCalifornia’s brown pelicans, for example, mistake plastic waste for food, filling their stomachs with a salad of garbage and starving them in the process.\nOnce this rainbow-colored, toxic plastic waste enters the environment, it does not biodegrade.\nInstead, court documents say, it is “extremely costly and difficult to eradicate,” especially when it disintegrates into microplastics — those tiny plastic bits measuring five millimeters or less that have been found everywhere, from tidal swells to human guts, lungs, blood, and breast milk.\nMeanwhile, the Attorney General alleges, Exxon has been the world’s largest contributor to single-use plastic waste, concealing and misrepresenting the dangers of plastic and the inefficiency of plastics recycling.\nAnd they’ve been incentivized to do so: Exxon reported record profits of $36 billion in 2023 alone.\nThe state’s lawsuit alleges that ExxonMobil’s decades-long campaign of deception violated state nuisance, natural resources, water pollution, false advertisement, and unfair competition laws.\nAccording to Bonta’s office, the Attorney General seeks to compel Exxon to “end its deceptive practices,” and pay out restitution in the form of an abatement fund, disgorgement, and civil penalties — to potentially fund educational efforts, protection of natural resources, and reuse infrastructure.\nIt’s a move being applauded by environmental groups around the state, four of which, including the Sierra Club, filed a separate lawsuit against Exxon, similarly accusing it of misleading the public about plastic recyclability.\nOn the Local Front For decades, ExxonMobil has been operating in Santa Barbara County’s backyard, and is currently trying to hand over its legacy to its metaphorical progeny — Sable Offshore. But while the fight over oil drilling and formerly ruptured pipelines continues , the region has been taking small steps to sever ties with its oily past and address its plastic waste.\nIn the last 10 years, the City of Santa Barbara got ahead of the ban-curve by adopting an ordinance to limit the use of single-use plastic bags at certain stores in 2015 and prohibiting the distribution and sale of plastic straws and stirrers in 2019. The city’s creeks division is also partnering with the University of Southern California to research how to intercept microplastic pollution from reaching waterways .\nSpork-Dumping: Superintendent/Principal of Peabody Charter School Demian Barnett showing how many sporks Peabody Charter\nhas used since the beginning of the 2024-2025 school year. | Credit: Courtesy Similarly, in 2023, the City of Goleta enacted strict new regulations in order to go “plastic free,” requiring reusable foodware for on-site dining, prohibiting single-use plastic straws and utensils, and banning polystyrene foodware products and certain balloons.\nFor countywide action , the Board of Supervisors just adopted the 2030 Climate Action Plan , which includes a focus on reducing non-recyclable and single-use items, chasing a goal to reduce landfilled inorganic waste 35 percent by 2030 and 90 percent by 2045. The county also recently received an Innovation Grant from CalRecycle to add new recycling methods like reverse vending machines, mobile recycling, and bag-drop sites to make cashing in empty (and actually recyclable) beverage containers easier.\nAnd on a smaller scale, kids have been making a difference, too — in April, Kellogg Elementary in Goleta became the first in their school district to ditch the plastic sporks . Shortly after, 5th-graders at Peabody Charter School in Santa Barbara called on their school to follow suit. On September 20, the school held a plastic spork-dumping ceremony, celebrating their breakup with single-use cutlery and the switch to stainless steel alternatives.\nRelated Posts Legislators and Enviros Call for Fresh Environmental Review of Plans to Restart Offshore Oil Drilling in Santa Barbara County By Margaux Lovely | Wed Oct 02, 2024 Scientists Use Drones to Track White Sharks Along California Beaches By Harrison Tasoff, UCSB's 'The Current' | Mon Sep 30, 2024 New California Law Will Speed Cleanup of Idle Oil Wells By Alejandro Lazo, CalMatters | Sat Sep 28, 2024 Most Read Recent News Kate Hudson Brings Her ‘Glorious’ Music to Mattei’s By Leslie Dinaberg | Fri Sep 27, 2024 Update: Man Arrested on Suspicion of Arson for Ridge Fire Near Gaviota By Ryan P.

    "text": "From high school seniors to senior citizens, more than 100,000 people will need a shoulder replacement each year.\nFor older adults, arthritis is the main reason for severe shoulder pain. For younger people, rotator cuff tears can lead to a replacement, but the younger you have surgery, the more likely the replacement parts will wear out or fail.\nA new FDA-approved implant is changing the game.\nFather Jordan Brown knew he wanted to be a priest since he was 16.\n“I love serving the church,” he said.\nHowever, Father Brown was also just a teenager when he first hurt his left shoulder. Decades later, the pain almost cost him his calling.\n“I’ll start with the baptism; holding an infant was excruciating pain,” he said.\nFather Brown was the perfect candidate for a newly FDA-approved shoulder replacement made of a pyrocarbon, not the traditional metallic and plastic.\n“The weak link is that plastic, so if you’re older and you’re not very active, that plastic’s fine. It’ll last your whole life, but when you’re young, like Father Brown, he was 59 when I did his shoulder replacement. You have years to live with a shoulder and that’s a complication,” said Dr. Armand Hatzidakis, orthopedic surgeon, at Rose Medical Center.\nThe ball will move, causing wear and tear, and patients end up needing a second replacement surgery, but the new pyrocarbon head has the same feel as bone.\n“The biocarbon graphite substrate is a lot more like bone than metal is, so it cooperates better with the native bone. that’s the real breakthrough in the technology,” Hatzidakis said.\nNow, Father Brown is not only back in the pulpit, but also physically stronger than he’s been in years.\n“A year ago, my arms were shaking to do a pushup. Now, I have no problem. This Sunday, I’ll be holding the challis for 30 to 45 minutes,” Brown said.",

He’s saying in three years we will be able to see an effect. So if businesses believe, you can pass a tax or regulation and stop the earth’s rotation or climate change or the earth’s temperature.

    "text": "Tyler Cross\nPublished on: November 14, 2024\nPublished on: November 14, 2024\nJonathan Edge, a 29-year-old Liverpool resident, is facing three years and four months for illegally loading and distributing jailbroken Amazon Fire Sticks. This is concurrent with a two-year and three-month sentence for viewing and accessing his supplied content. Jonathan plead guilty to three offenses under the Fraud Act.\nJonathan loaded streaming services such as Premier League football and exchanged the firestick for cash. The sticks would then give people access to the channels without them needing to pay any subscription fees.\nHe advertised his services on websites like Facebook, creating a digital trail that was easily discoverable. Even after receiving multiple warnings about his illegal activity, he kept selling the Fire Sticks online. This eventually acted as an aggregating factor in court, leading to his long sentence.\nThe court explains that it’s a blatant example of copyright abuse and that the consequences serve to highlight how serious these violations are.\n“Many people see no harm in illegally streaming TV services but they are wrong, and this outcome should serve as a further warning how seriously such copyright theft continues to be taken,” said Detective Sergeant Steve Frame from the Merseyside Police.\nIn 2019, the UK reported that copyright abuse leads to over 9 billion pounds and the loss of more than 80,000 jobs per year. Since this report was published, the problem has gotten worse worldwide. Despite that, the general public doesn’t take the problem very seriously.\nThe prosecution team included experts from the Premier League, the Merseyside Police, the Federation Against Copyright Theft, and several other organizations interested in blocking copyright abuse.\nThe Premier League declared that it will continue fighting against illegal distributors.\n“We will continue to pursue legal action against those supplying unauthorized access to Premier League football, regardless of the scale or mode of operation,” it said. “Ignoring warnings to stop only served to make the consequences worse for the individual.”\nThey’re not alone. International governments and companies have been ramping up their battle against copyright abuse, including charging distributors, taking down duplicate articles, and shutting down infringing websites.",

    "text": "- Some of Britain's biggest stores are set to publish holiday trading figures. - Marks & Spencer is set to have a great Christmas - Supermarket giants are also expected to perform strongly The high street's winners and losers will be revealed this week as some of the UK's biggest stores publish festive trading figures. As The Mail on Sunday revealed, M&S is likely to have a great Christmas and will update investors on Thursday. Supermarket giants are also expected to perform strongly with Sainsbury's and Tesco due to release figures on Wednesday and Thursday respectively. But others may have fared less well. While Next published strong figures last week, JD Sports was forced to slash its profit expectations in an unexpected twist. The 'King of Trainers' admitted it no longer expects to reach its target of £1bn annual profits despite bosses' confidence last year. Demand from buyers was weaker than anticipated, 'reflecting more cautious consumer spending.' Winner: In the festive supermarket battle, Britain's biggest grocer and its number two – Tesco and Sainsbury's – are expected to come out on top But Lord Wolfson-run Next saw its shares surge after raising profit expectations for the fifth time since June amid better-than-expected sales. Data from retail specialist Kantar, seen by The Mail on Sunday, shows that in the four weeks to Christmas Eve, grocery sales at M&S rose 14.2 per cent compared with last year. Analysts expect the company to post sales growth in its food and clothing and household divisions. Shares ended 2019 at their highest level since 2023 after the retailer returned to the FTSE 100 in September. Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Sophie Lund-Yates said that in the festive supermarket battle, the UK's biggest grocer and its number two – Tesco and Sainsbury's – are expected to come out on top.
