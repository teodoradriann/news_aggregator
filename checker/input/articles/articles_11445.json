    "title": "Padres Encouraged by Yu Darvish's Return, Despite 'Rust'",
    "text": "Padres Encouraged by Yu Darvish's Return, Despite 'Rust' Yu Darvish is back. In a [season filled with adversity](https://www.si.com/mlb/padres/san-diego-padres-news/padres-could-be-without-yu-darvish-for-extended-period-01j281pmzzsk) for the starting pitcher, Darvish only had 11 games this season under his belt before returning to the mound Wednesday. The 38-year-old right-hander had not appeared in a major league game since May 29 until his first pitch Wednesday against the Detroit Tigers. Although Darvish didn't figure into the Padres’ 6-5 victory, the team was happy to have him back. The 2021 National League All-Star logged a 3.51 ERA, allowing four hits, three runs, and one home run across 2.2 innings. He struck out four batters and walked two. “There was a lot of adrenaline going into this game, maybe a little trying to do too much, kind of getting used to the pitch clock again,” Darvish said to [The Athletic’s Dennis Lin.](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5746369/2024/09/05/yu-darvish-padres-return-il/) “I think a key (going forward) would be to try to be a little bit calmer.” Darvish’s unimpressive final line (2.2 innings, three runs, all earned) saw his ERA for the season jump to 3.51. But Padres manager Mike Shildt was satisfied with Darvish’s performance. He understands the newly returned pitcher needs time to get back into the groove of the major leagues. “The stuff was great,” Shildt [ said to Lin](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5746369/2024/09/05/yu-darvish-padres-return-il/). “It was coming out easy. The secondary pitches looked like they were there. As you can expect the first game back in a big-league game, it was a little bit of just missing either off (the plate) or just missing too much on. Command does speak for itself, but I thought the ball came out well. He said he felt good. His arm felt good. His body felt good. Just knocked a little bit of the proverbial rust off. But I was really encouraged by how it was coming out.” The addition of Darvish into the Padres’ rotation will be beneficial as the team prepares for the postseason. Before Darvish returned, San Diego had major question marks outside its top four starters — Dylan Cease, Michael King, Joe Musgrove, and Martín Pérez. Second-year pitcher Randy Vasquez had been shuffling in and out of the fifth starter's spot amid Darvish's absence. While he gave the Padres a chance to win on most nights, Vasquez was also terribly inconsistent. In his last outing before being optioned to Triple-A, the right-hander allowed 11 hits and nine runs in 4.1 innings against the Tampa Bay Rays. Across the 11 games Darvish pitched before his hiatus, he accrued a 3.20 ERA while throwing 53 strikeouts and 15 walks. “You give a guy three months off basically, and he’s doing what he can to get back and healthy, and obviously, he grinded to do it. It’s not easy,\" Padres outfielder Jackson Merrill [ said to Lin](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5746369/2024/09/05/yu-darvish-padres-return-il/). \"Getting him now at the strength he has and how healthy he is, it’s huge for us.” With his return, Darvish will serve as an additional reliable starter for the Padres' rotation.",

    "title": "Winter fuel payment cut will save less than Reeves needs, say experts",
    "text": "Winter fuel payments - Neil Bussey/iStockphoto Scrapping winter fuel payments for millions of pensioners could save a third less than the Chancellor has claimed, a former pensions minister has warned. The Government has said restricting the extra support to those on means-tested benefits – leaving almost 10 million pensioners worse off – will retain £1.4 billion for Treasury coffers in the first year. But Sir Steve Webb, a Liberal Democrat pensions minister in the coalition government, estimated that those savings could be cut by £490 million as retirees hit by the change seek extra support from the state. Currently, all 11.4 million pensioners receive an extra £200 to help heat their homes every winter, with those over 80 receiving a blanket £300 payment. Under Rachel Reeves’ plans, announced last week, only those receiving pension credit or other means-tested benefits will be eligible for the additional support. However many retirees do not claim pension credit despite being eligible, with the latest statistics suggesting that between 720,000 and 880,000 people are missing out. If one in four of these pensioners were to put in a claim, Sir Steve estimates that a third of the Treasury’s expected savings could be wiped out, with the Government forking out an extra £440 million in benefits and no longer able to bank £50 million in axed winter fuel payments. The former minister cited the 2019 decision to restrict free TV licences for the over-75s to those who qualify for pension credit – which was followed by a surge in people claiming the benefit – as a possible precedent. He said the impact of the winter fuel change could be even bigger because it affects all pensioners, not just those over 75, and the amount potentially lost – between £200 and £300 – is more than the cost of a TV licence five years ago. Sir Steve said it was “highly likely” that the winter fuel announcement would lead to “a flurry of new claims for pension credit”, adding: “This is exactly what happened when entitlement to a free TV licence for the over-75s was restricted to those on benefit. “But a big surge in take-up could slash the savings from this measure. If just one in four of those currently missing out on their entitlement to pension credit now makes a claim, this could cut the Chancellor’s savings by around one third. One consequence of this is that additional cuts might be required to make up for the shortfall.” Ms Reeves’ plan is part of a wider drive to fill a “black hole” in the nation’s finances, with Labour aiming to save £5.5 billion this year alone. Pollsters have reported a “real depth of anger” from pensioners over the spending cut. Luke Tryl, the UK director of More in Common, said feedback from retirees in Leigh, Greater Manchester, had been even more negative than expected. Some called the change “disgusting”, claimed to feel like “second-class citizens” and accused Labour of betraying its principles. Pension credit is sometimes referred to as a “gateway benefit”, with claimants also gaining access to council tax reduction, housing benefit and support for mortgage interest, along with free eye tests. Separately to Sir Steve’s calculations, Baroness Ros Altmann, a Tory peer and leading pensions expert, warned that this would amount to an extra cost of “thousands of pounds per person”. She argued that “trying to balance the books off the back of pensioners is flawed”, and that retirees could end up “seriously ill” if they assume, like the Government, that “if we can’t afford it, we can’t pay it”. She said: “That will mean more cost to NHS, more people in hospital and more calls on GPs. That element of the extra costs also needs to be factored into any potential saving.” Simon Francis, of the End Fuel Poverty charity collective, also argued that the savings made by scrapping the universal winter fuel benefit would be eclipsed by added costs for the NHS. He said: “It’s a false economy because they are cutting back on winter fuel payments but will push elderly people living in cold, damp homes into the arms of the NHS. “Illnesses linked to cold, damp and dangerous homes already cost the NHS more than £2.5 billion a year, according to UCL’s Institute of Health Equity. “If you add another two million pensioners into fuel poverty, and millions more struggling with their bills, then this cost could soar. So the minister may save on the winter fuel payments only to see the cost of treating the ill-health caused by the move increase.” A Government spokesman said: “This Government is committed to pensioners – protecting the triple lock, keeping energy bills low through our Warm Homes Plan, and cutting NHS waiting lists, bringing real stability to people’s lives. “We said we would be honest with the public and, given the dire state of the public finances we have inherited, this Government must take difficult decisions to fix the foundations of the economy. “In these circumstances, it is right that winter fuel payments are targeted at those in most need, and we will work with local authorities to boost the uptake of pension credit, reaching the many pensioners who could still benefit from this year’s winter fuel payments.” Play The Telegraph’s brilliant range of Puzzles - and feel brighter every day.

Yo que soy de mente científica le he preguntado por qué”, ha empezado contando.\nÉl le ha dicho que es argentino y que en su país “hay 200 psicólogos por habitante” y que había ido varias veces a terapia pero nunca le había funcionado. “Cuando le pregunté, desde su punto de vista, qué hacía un psicólogo, él me respondió ‘te sientas ahí, les cuentas tu vida, al final ellos sólo te escuchan y te plantean dudas para que resuelvas tus propios problemas'”, ha explicado.\nElla le ha dicho que no le extraña que no le haya funcionado y que hay mucha gente que no cree en los psicólogos porque está extendida la creencia, que viene del psicoanálisis, que consiste en que “a consulta vas a sentarte a hablar, a contar tus problemas y desahogarte o a rascar sobre tu infancia y tu pasado y no es así, por los menos en las terapias con evidencia científica”.\nCuando le ha dicho todo esto el hombre se ha quedado “del revés” pero aún así no le ha creído: “La terapia que funciona que no consiste en rascar en tus heridas de la infancia y charlas con tu niño interior. Eso, lo siento mucho a quien le duela, son magufadas”.",

It also requires only a second of audio to perform a verification.\nParikh adds, \"We have purposely opened our new Hiya Deepfake Voice Detector tool to everyone for free during this time to help people stay vigilant, informed, and safe.

    "text": "Six killed, 15 injured in Nyeri-Nyahururu highway crash Six people have died while 15 others were injured in a road accident in Solio area on the Nyeri-Nyahururu highway. The Thursday 6pm accident involved a 14-seater matatu, a saloon car and a motorcycle. Confirming the incident to Nation.Africa, Kieni West Deputy Sub County Police Commander Bernard Muthomi said one of the motorists had swerved to avoid hitting a pothole when the accident occurred. \"The accident occurred in Solio area and six people died, 14 are seriously injured while one sustained minor injuries,\" Mr Muthomi said by phone. \"The driver of the saloon car was avoiding potholes on the highway and this is believed to have caused the accident,\" he added. He urged motorists to drive carefully during and after the festive season. Mr Stephen Ndegwa, an eyewitness and a regular motorist on the route, said the road had claimed the lives of many motorists and appealed to the government to fill the potholes. \"So many people have lost their lives along this bridge. It is a sharp bend and a very dangerous black spot at the entrance to Solio Ranch. Something should be done by the Kenya National Highway Authority to ensure the safety of most of us who use this road regularly,\" said Mr Ndegwa.",
