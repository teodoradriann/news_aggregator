    "text": "Une année scolaire sous tension : c’est le bilan dressé par les syndicats des enseignants. Les représentants syndicaux du SE-UNE SA Guyane tirent la sonnette d’alarme sur une situation qui ne cesse de se dégrader.\nOn est face à une école totalement insécurisée dans ses murs... puisqu'on a un bâti scolaire vieillissant, en déliquescence [...] On est en baisse d'attractivité, le métier d'enseignant n'attire plus.\nEmmanuel OCTAVIE, secrétaire général SE-UNSA Guyane\nEn Guyane, 70% des postes ouvert au concours sont vacants. Afin de pallier les déficits, l’académie a recours au recrutement de 1.600 contractuels. Une solution qui ne fait pas l’unanimité.\nCe que nous réclamons, c'est qu'il y ait un recrutement par voie de concours. Parce que qui dit par voie de concours, traduit la sécurité de l'emploie [...] Face à nos élèves, nous devons avoir des personnels formés, des fonctionnaires. On ne peut pas dire aujourd'hui, parce qu'on est en Guyane, que nos élèves peuvent avoir devant eux des personnes qui ne sont pas formées.\nSuley JAÏR, co-secrétaire départementale de la FSU SNUIPP Guyane\nMais ce n’est pas tout. Pour le secrétaire général du STEG UTG, la rotation fréquente des recteurs pose aussi problème.\n▶ Guillaume Gellé, nouveau recteur de Guyane a commencé ses visites de terrain\nOn a un turn-over, au niveau des têtes, qui empêche qu'il y ait des véritables plans, sur des années, qui soient construits pour avoir des bases solides pour l'éducation en Guyane. Les gouvernances que l'on constate dans le Rectorat font parfois obstruction à une avancée significatives sur les dossiers urgents de l'académie.\nAnatole DARIO, secrétaire général du STEG UTG\nAvec près de 3.000 jeunes non scolarisés, selon l’Observatoire de la scolarisation, les défis sont d'autant plus importants pour le territoire. La rentrée 2025 s’annonce déjà comme l’une des plus difficiles de ces dernières années, selon les syndicats.",

    "text": "AnaptysBio (ANAB) Shares Surge 37% on Positive RA Trial Results\nAnaptysBio (ANAB) shares experienced a significant intraday gain of 3.29%, reaching their highest level since December 2024, despite a 5.38% decline in the overall market sentiment.\nWells Fargo has maintained a Buy rating for [anaptysbio], with a price target of $51.00, reflecting positive analyst sentiment and potential investor confidence in the stock. This rating suggests that analysts believe the company has strong growth prospects, which can attract more investors and drive the stock price higher.\nAnaptysBio's shares surged after the company authorized a buyback program. This move is generally seen as a positive signal by investors, as it indicates that the company's management believes the stock is undervalued and has the potential for future growth. Buyback programs can also reduce the number of shares outstanding, potentially increasing earnings per share and making the stock more attractive to investors.\nAnaptysBio's mid-stage rheumatoid arthritis trial met its primary goal, leading to a 37% surge in the company's shares. This positive clinical trial result suggests that the company's drug candidate is effective, which can increase investor optimism and potentially lead to future revenue growth. Successful clinical trials are crucial for biotech companies, as they validate the company's research and development efforts and pave the way for regulatory approval and commercialization.\nThe stock holds buy signals from both short and long-term moving averages, indicating a positive outlook for the company. Moving averages are technical indicators that help investors identify trends and potential price movements. Buy signals from both short and long-term moving averages suggest that the stock is in an uptrend and may continue to rise in the future. This positive outlook can attract investors looking for growth opportunities and contribute to the stock's upward movement.\nAnaptysBio announced positive results in the RA Phase 2b trial with Rosnilimab, achieving the highest ever reported CDAI LDA response over 6 months. This promising clinical data further contributes to the stock's positive momentum, as it demonstrates the efficacy of the company's drug candidate in treating rheumatoid arthritis. Positive clinical trial results are essential for biotech companies, as they provide evidence of the drug's safety and efficacy, which can lead to regulatory approval and commercialization.",

    "title": "Cap on international students equals 'moratorium': Colleges",
    "text": "Canada's new cap on international students is already being felt, as study permit applicants are starting to get refusal letters from visa posts, says the body representing Ontario's 24 public colleges. Marketa Evans, CEO of Colleges Ontario, told the Star on Thursday that the federal government has imposed a moratorium \"by stealth,\" with its new measures, and that it is \"wreaking havoc on people's lives.\" \"That's very arbitrary, very unfair. And we're calling on the government to end that moratorium and really bring some empathy and understanding to this situation.\" While it's too early for Evans to gauge the potential lost enrolment for her members, Ontario's colleges — and possibly universities — are expected to be the biggest losers after Immigration Minister [Marc Miller announced a plan to slash the number of new study permits](https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/an-indictment-of-what-the-program-became-canada-sets-new-limits-on-work-permits-for/article_0206b92a-b929-11ee-a3d7-c33ab63f9e70.html) issued across Canada this year by 35 per cent from last year's level, to 364,000, while leaving the number of applicants accepted in master's and doctoral programs uncapped. Each province will be allotted a fixed number of new study permits relative to its population and will have to decide how to divvy up the spots among institutions authorized to accept international students. Ontario is the home to 51 per cent of Canada's international students, and most of the recent international enrolment growth has been with the college system, which offers shorter and cheaper programs than universities but still provides international students with access to postgraduation work permits that can lead to permanent residence. With declining provincial funding for post-secondary education, international students, who pay three to four times more in tuition fees than domestic students, have become a financial lifeline for many institutions — especially those in smaller communities outside Greater Toronto — that had struggled with declining domestic enrolment over the years. Saying that her focus now is to plead for the suspension of the federal government's cap, Evans did not provide a direct answer to how the colleges are going to fill the revenue gaps, which could potentially lead to a huge spike in already substantial international tuition fees. Such fees are unregulated. You might be interested in However, in a public statement Thursday, Colleges Ontario asked the province to step up by approving a modest $135 increase in per-student annual tuition and raising provincial grants by 10 per cent as [recommended recently by a blue-ribbon panel created by the Ontario government](https://www.thestar.com/politics/provincial/almost-half-of-ontario-universities-are-running-deficits-putting-student-services-at-risk-council-says/article_639ebedc-af31-11ee-bdce-47e37d4e1808.html) to look at the financial future of post-secondary institutions. \"There are modest changes the Ontario government can make right now to help us stabilize the system and keep programs and campuses open for domestic students as we work through this disruption,\" said the four-page statement. Public pressure on immigration Facing public pushback over high levels of immigration and criticism over their impact on affordable housing, Miller has been under the gun to restrict the number of temporary residents in Canada, and international students and postgraduation work permit holders make up a chunk of that population. On Monday, he implemented an immediate requirement for a letter of attestation from provincial governments to accompany all study permit applications even though, other than Quebec, no provinces have the process in place for generating such letters. \"What we're hearing from members is that students are getting a rejection without any explanation or without being told what to do about it,\" Evans said. \"Should you sit and wait? Should you apply somewhere else? It's very unclear.\" As opposed to universities, said Evans, public colleges have a year-round intake of students and many are well into the application process, ready to start in programs in May for key sectors of Ontario's economy; college graduates fill many of the jobs in advanced manufacturing, mining, the electrical vehicle industry, early childhood education, health care and housing construction, among others. \"Ending the moratorium would give us the runway to make the adjustments, at least, for the spring term,\" Evans noted. Starting Sept. 1, Ottawa will also stop issuing post-graduation work permits to international students who complete programs provided under so-called Public College-Private Partnerships. Further, the spouses of most international students will no longer be granted work permits, with the exception of those studying in graduate schools or in a professional programs such as medicine or law. Public-private partnership debate The public-private college partnerships, which allow graduates from private colleges to receive public college credentials and coveted post-graduation work permits, are sanctioned by the Ontario government and have become a growing concern for the quality of education delivered through some of the private partners. Sault College in northern Ontario brings in about $40 million in revenue and 2,800 students from its partnership with triOS, a private college with campuses in Toronto and Brampton, about one-third of its entire budget. Sault College president David Orazietti said post-secondary schools were urged to go out and raise revenue from the private sector to build partnerships. \"Those partnerships are driving revenue to support our operations,\" said Orazietti, a former Ontario Liberal cabinet minister. \"They support jobs at our college and they support the ability to train workers for our workforce, in our community, for our employers.\" Currently some 15 public colleges in Ontario have public-private partnerships, and of those, he said, 12 will face serious financial hardship as a result of reduced enrolments. \"There are certainly some unintended consequences,\" added Orazietti. \"I don't believe that Minister Miller was intending to undermine the financial stability of half of the public colleges in Ontario, but nevertheless, that's what he’s managed to do.\" The province has capped the number of international students enrolled in the public-private partnership programs for each public college at 7,500, but he said some schools were knowingly violating the rule and the provincial government has not followed through on threats to reduce their funding. A post-secondary international student compliance team should be established \"to actually enforce their policy directives,\" he added. Evans, however, criticized the federal government for \"conflating\" the challenge with the public college system and maintained that these partnerships are \"robustly\" regulated and audited from recruitment to programming, credential assessment and graduation, under strict ministerial directive by the province. That's supplemented, she said, by the [international education standards rolled out last year by Colleges Ontario](https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/ontario-colleges-move-to-protect-international-students-before-and-after-they-come-to-canada/article_d27a9a48-7881-582a-bb12-748b2f0b3c89.html) that also apply to its members' private college partners. \"We want to really be careful and nuanced about not lumping everybody together, and understanding that this (cap) is a very blunt instrument, which on the face of it, does not actually improve quality,\" Evans said. \"Every college is going to feel this differently. So again, a blunt instrument really fails to take into account the fact that one size does absolutely not fit all.\"",

    "text": "Trabajador camarero (Adobe Stock) La precariedad está enquistada e n la hostería. Las largas jornadas laborales, el maltrato a los camareros por parte de clientes y empleadores, y los contratos por debajo de la ley son una constante en el sector. Ante esta realidad, cada vez más trabajadores deciden denunciar su situación públicamente.\nJesús Soriano, conocido en redes sociales como Soy Camarero , se ha convertido en un referente en la defensa de los derechos laborales del gremio. Desde hace siete años, utiliza sus plataformas para visibilizar las experiencias de sus compañeros. Con cerca de 70.000 seguidores en TikTok, Soriano ha vuelto a ser tendencia tras exponer las condiciones laborales de una polém ica oferta de empleo.\nLa última denuncia de ‘Soy Camarero’ “Hoy os traigo unas condiciones de trabajo que vais a ver ahora y bueno, comentadme que os parece”, así empieza Jesús Soriano uno de sus últimos videos de TikTok. Como de costumbre, a sus palabras les acompañan varias capturas de pantalla de una conversación de WhatsApp entre un jefe y un camarero.\nComo puede verse, la primera parte de la conversación se centra en el horario de la oferta. “De lunes a jueves de 11 a 16 horas y de 20 a 00 horas”. En el caso de viernes, sábados y domingos, el horario se amplía de 11 a 17 horas y de 20 horas a cierre. “Se libran los domingos por la tarde y los lunes al completo”, apuntan.\nEn cuanto a las condiciones económicas, el cobro será de 1.300 euros netos al mes, aunque el empleador asegura que “pueden ser más según valía”. Ante esto, el camarero ha explicado que el cobro de cada hora está en los cinco euros, lo que estaría por debajo del Salario Mínimo Interprofesional (SMI).\nLa última denuncia de 'Soy Camarero' (Captura de pantalla) Ante esta situación, han sido muchos los usuarios que han querido presentar su opinión sobre esto. “Se lo voy a mandar a inspección de trabajo a ver que opinan ellos y con lo que me digan ya te cuento”, escribe Ana. “Me hace gracia lo de “según valía”. El primero que demuestra que no es válido para ser empresario es él, ya que no gana dinero con su empresa, sino que lo gana de los sueldos que debería de pagar”, añade otro usuario.\n@soycamarero #Recuerdos\n♬ sonido original - Soycamarero Cuánto es el número máximo de horas que se puede trabajar a la semana en España En este contexto, la cantidad de horas de trabajo semanales también ha supuesto un punto de conflicto entre los usuarios. Según el Estatuto de los Trabajadores, el máxim o permitido es de 40 horas semanales, calculadas como promedio anual. No obstante, los convenios colectivos o los acuerdos entre empresas y representantes de los empleados pueden establecer una distribución irregular de las horas a lo largo del año.\nEn ausencia de pactos específicos, la normativa permite a las empresas distribuir de manera irregular hasta un 10% de la jornada anual, siempre que se respeten los descansos mínimos diarios y semanales. El incumplimiento de estas disposiciones puede derivar en sanciones administrativas para las empresas, además de la obligación de indemnizar al trabajador afectado.",

(WVLT) - The Tennessee Wildlife Resources Association says they believe an alcohol ban inside all wildlife management areas is working. The law was put into place back on April 15. Previous Coverage: TWRA set to ban alcohol on Wildlife Management Areas Before then, the TWRA investigated three different crashes involving alcohol this year. Since April 15, there haven’t been any crashes, and officials said they see more people coming out to visit the areas. “There are lives being saved and people are being safer. We’re having more families come out. I’m checking more people with their kids and their families. And they’re happy and praise that this law has went into effect because they feel more safe bringing their kids and and families out to enjoy this recreational activity,” said TWRA Sgt. Dustin Burke. TWRA officers issue citations for alcohol possession. Burke added that Tennessee DUI laws also apply on local roads and managed trails within the Wildlife Management Areas. Exceptions to the law where you can have alcohol include designated campgrounds and waterways on agency property. Copyright 2024 WVLT. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "2023-12-28 17:57:47\nA young man in “severe hypothermia” was discovered Thursday, December 28 late in the morning at Orly airport in the landing gear of an Air Algérie flight arriving from Oran, Agence France-Presse learned from the Créteil prosecutor’s office. This is a person without identity documents and whose age is estimated between 20 and 30 years old, he said.\nThe man was transported in serious condition to Henri-Mondor hospital in Créteil, according to the prosecution, which specified that the air transport gendarmerie (GTA) was in charge of the investigation.\nEarlier Thursday, an airport source explained that the young man was “alive but in absolute emergency because of severe hypothermia”. The GTA has confirmed a “seriously injured person” at Orly, without further details immediately.\nA mortality rate of 77%\nSeveral cases of stowaways hidden in the landing gear of planes, unheated or pressurized spaces, have marked the news in recent years. In April, the body of a man was found at Amsterdam-Schiphol upon the arrival of a plane from Toronto (Canada), but apparently had previously passed through Nigeria. Four months earlier, two stowaways, also dead, were discovered hidden in the storage space of the landing gear of a plane coming from Santiago de Chile to Bogota.\nAt the cruising altitude of commercial aircraft, 12 kilometers, the air temperature plunges below −50°C, while the lack of oxygen can be fatal.\nAccording to global statistics from the American Civil Aviation Authority (FAA) cited in January 2022 by the New York Times, between 1947 and 2021, 132 people attempted to travel clandestinely by hiding in airplane landing gears. One hundred and two of them died, a mortality rate of 77%, according to the same source.\n1703803929\n#man #landing #gear #plane #Orly",

A Roma, Cgil e Uil hanno scelto piazza Gandhi, la Cisl è andata a largo Argentina\nI lavoratori e le lavoratrici del settore\nturismo, dipendenti di aziende affiliate a Federturismo di Confindustria e Aica, sono in agitazione. Il 12 settembre c'è stato un primo giorno di sciopero e una protesta organizzata dai sindacati. Anzi, due.\nSciopero lavoratori turismo\nPartiamo dalle motivazioni dello sciopero. Le aziende che si rifanno a Federturismo e Aica (per citarne solo alcune: NH Hotels, Marriott, Alpitour) non sono ancora arrivate a un accordo relativamente al rinnovo contrattuale, atteso da sei anni. Come spiegano i sindacati \"le trattative, interrotte il 23 luglio, hanno subito una battuta di arresto a causa delle richieste irricevibili delle parti datoriali, che miravano a precarizzare ulteriormente il settore e a indebolire il valore economico del rinnovo contrattuale\".\nSindacati divisi\nPer questo tutte le sigle sindacali che si occupano del settore, hanno indetto lo sciopero (una prima giornata, ce ne sarà un'altra) e lanciato la protesta nei confronti della parte datoriale. Impossibile non notare, però, che lo hanno fatto separatamente. Da una parte Filcams CGIL e UIltucs (singolare connubio, data la distanza politica netta), da un'altra Fisascat Cisl.\nCgil e Uil all'Eur\nIl 12 settembre Filcams e Uiltucs hanno scelto piazza Gandhi all'Eur, a pochi passi dalla sede Federturismo-Confindustria. E quella piazza l'ha scelta anche Alessandro Onorato, assessore al turismo di Roma Capitale, che ha portato solidarietà e ribadito \"l'importanza del settore nella crescita del Lazio che si è registrata nel 2023\" auspicando infine \"buste paga più pesanti\". D'altronde a Roma e nel Lazio ci sono circa 8mila persone impiegate nel settore e facenti riferimento a Federturismo e Aica e siamo inoltre alle porte di un periodo, quello del Giubileo, che richiederà uno sforzo eccezionale a livello ricettivo. Presente anche Stefano Sampaolo, capo staff dell'assessora alla scuola, formazione e lavoro Claudia Pratelli.\nLa Cisl a largo Argentina\nMentre Cgil e Uil mostravano le loro bandiere all'Eur, a svariati chilometri di distanza c'era la Cisl, con la Fisascat. In questo caso la scelta è caduta su largo Argentina, non distante dalla sede di Confindustria. \"I lavoratori del settore, passati da un periodo di pandemia al rilancio del settore, costato dedizione e sforzi - rivendicano da Fisascat Cisl -, attendono da anni un adeguamento salariale e migliori condizioni normative!\". \"Abbiamo atteso anni per poterci sedere al tavolo negoziale - proseguono -, passando da una pandemia alla ripresa netta del settore, ma nulla è cambiato. In questi sei anni i lavoratori hanno continuato a garantire la salvaguardia del settore\".\nIn ogni caso, nonostante le evidenti divisioni, gli scopi sono gli stessi. Un nuovo contratto, stipendi più alti, maggiori tutele.",

    "title": "Catholic Bishop of Jerusalem Tells How Christians Suffer Israeli Invasion of Gaza",
    "text": "(ZENIT News / Jerusalem, 23.05.2024).- In an interview with Aid to the Church in Need-Italy (ACN- Italy), Monsignor William Shomali, Auxiliary Bishop of Jerusalem, Patriarchal Vicar for Jordan and Apostolic Administrator of the Latin Patriarchate, gave an update on the dramatic situation of Christians in the Holy Land. In regard to the faithful of the Gaza Strip, the Prelate said that “there were 1,017 Christians living in Gaza before the war.” After the outbreak of the conflict, “the majority of them sought refuge in the Latin parish complex and a minority in the Greek Orthodox.” These displaced people “suffer the lack of electricity, potable water and food. Fortunately, over the last days, they have been able to buy sacks of flour. Once they received frozen chickens, which they had to cook and consume the same day as they had no fridges.” As regards housing, “the majority of Christians have seen their homes destroyed. They live in our schools’ classrooms. One or two families fit in a classroom. Hence we cannot resume school activities until families have reconstructed their apartments. Who will reconstruct? No one knows what the situation will be like in Gaza after the war. Not to mention that we have to continue paying the full salaries of the teachers of our two schools, otherwise they would lose the only income they have,” said Monsignor Shomali. Needless to say, there are not only material damages. “Thirty people died in the various explosions that occurred. Moreover, more than 250 people have now left, among them people with dual nationality, some sick people and students who intend to continue their studies. An Association, whose members are unknown, asks between US$7,000-8,000 per person for the permit to leave Rafah and go to Egypt. Some families have been able to pay, others try to collect funds for this end. Now the Rafah border-pass is closed. Gaza’s inhabitants are in a great prison.” Despite the conflict being centered in the Gaza Strip, it has also had a strong impact on Palestinian Christians in the West Bank and those of East Jerusalem. In regard to Christians of these communities, the Bishop said that “close to 40% of them work, directly or indirectly, in tourism. They are guides, drivers of tourist buses, hotel employees, etc.” COVID dealt a hard blow to this sector. It had hardly recovered when October 7 happened. Since then, there have been no pilgrims, and these Christians have suffered the loss of their jobs and a drastic drop in their income. Based on studies and statistics, the Latin Patriarchate estimates that in the tourist sector alone more than 3,000 families have lost their employment, not to mention the hundreds of people employed as manpower in construction or other sectors.” On an international scale, the ideological confrontation between the supporters of Israel and those of Palestine worsens and, as a consequence, the voice of the Christian communities runs the risk of being drowned or distorted for political ends. In face of this, Bishop Shomali underscores the true intention of the local Christian community. The two peoples in conflict wish to live in peace.” However, one wonders, “how can a conflict be resolved that has a strong ideological background in relation to ownership of the land? The same land is claimed by both peoples, the Jews for biblical reasons, the Palestinians for historical reasons. The solution would be that of two States, with Jerusalem as an open and shared city. The Christian community doesn’t think the conflict can be resolved by force, which only increases hatred and prepares another cycle of violence. Only a just solution can bring peace and reconciliation,” he said. The Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem helps the Christian communities with different projects, several of them also financed by Aid to the Church in Need. “The humanitarian appeal, launched by the Patriarch after October 7, had a favourable response, thanks to which we were able to establish a program of humanitarian aid for Gaza and Palestine. With this program, we help the sick to get medications, we subsidize medical operations, scholarships, housing rentals, and help families in economic difficulties. With the Saint Yves enterprise, legal branch of the Latin Patriarchate, we work to improve the situation at the checkpoints. The majority of these checkpoints closed after October 7. Saint Yves was able to open more than one. The Churches have been able to increase somewhat the quota of permits granted by Israel for the entry of various Palestinian workers, although not all requests are attended. We have also created work scholarships so that people can have an income. In the framework of this program, 400 workers have been contracted, who receive a salary of US$650 a month. We know that this aid is insufficient to compensate for the loss of income, but at least we keep families out of destitution, in the hope of better days.” The Auxiliary Bishop concluded addressing ACN’s benefactors. “We thank the benefactors of Aid to the Church in Need for their closeness to the Holy Land. We continue receiving great support from them for our pastoral projects, as well as for our humanitarian needs. The only way to thank them is to pray for them in the Holy Places. The Lord, who knows everything, will be able to give them a hundredfold.” [ this ",
