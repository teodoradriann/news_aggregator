    "text": "The government must declare July 12 as West Philippine Sea Victor Day to mark the country’s historic triumph against China before the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in 2016, Senator Risa Hontiveros said yesterday as the country marked the 8th anniversary of the arbitral award.\nHontiveros’ call followed the approval of the Palawan provincial board of an ordinance that declares July 12 as “West Philippine Sea Victory Day.”\nPalawan Liga ng mga Barangay President and Board Member Ferdinand Zaballa, who authored the measure, said that the arbitration tribunal’s decision is a “resounding affirmation” of the Philippines’ sovereignty and sovereign rights in the WPS.\n“The ruling definitively settled historic rights and maritime entitlements in the region, rejecting claims that exceeded the limits set by UNCLOS. It now stands as a pivotal part of international law,” he said.\nPalawan province has jurisdiction over a substantial portion of the waters being claimed by China, including the Kalayaan group of islands.\nOn Friday, government officials, lawmakers and foreign allies hailed the arbitral ruling, saying it has become even more consequential amid China’s increased bullying in the WPS.\n“We should celebrate WPS Victory Day every year, not just to remember our 2016 win, but also as a way to assert our just and rightful ownership of the WPS,” Hontiveros said.\n“The 2016 victory showed the world that a small country like the Philippines can legally, peacefully, and diplomatically stand up to a big, autocratic country like China…But Beijing’s continued threats and intimidation despite the ruling are also a sober reminder to the world that all those who believe in the international, rules-based order must actively come together to safeguard peace and security across the globe,” she added.\nUnited States Ambassador to the Philippines MaryKay Carlson said the arbitral award, which invalidated Beijing’s massive claim over the entire South China Sea, was significant not just to the Philippines but to all stakeholders in the Indo-Pacific region.\n“The arbitral award was a milestone in setting up the legal rights and lawful maritime entitlements of the Philippines and the People’s Republic of China in the South China Sea, clarifying extensive maritime areas where the Philippines enjoys sovereign rights and jurisdiction over natural resources in its Exclusive Economic Zone and on its continental shelf,” Carlson said during a conference organized by the Stratbase ADR Institute.\n“At the same time, it memorialized vast maritime areas where all nations enjoy freedom of navigation and overflight under international law, providing the legal foundation for trade, investment, and economic activity to thrive in the Indo-Pacific region.”\nCanadian Ambassador to Philippines David Hartman added: “Let me be unequivocally clear that the Philippines must be able to exercise freedom of navigation as well as enjoy the sovereign rights to which it is entitled within its exclusive economic zone.”\nJapanese Ambassador to the Philippines Endo Kazuya said Tojyo has consistently upheld that the arbitral award is “final and legally binding on the parties concerned.”\n“While the 2016 arbitral award showed crystal clear directions in navigating the turbulent waters of the South China Sea, the actual situations on the sea remain challenging and complex…In this regard, Japan is undeterred to fulfill its commitment. As Japan and the Philippines are neighboring maritime nations, we have a shared responsibility in upholding and protecting the peace and stability across the region,” he said.\nNational Security Adviser Eduardo Año said the 2016 legal victory “remains at the core of (the country’s) foreign and national security policies.”\n“Eight years ago today, in a battle akin to David versus Goliath, victory was handed to the Philippines,” Año said, noting that China’s coercion and aggressive activities threaten the safety and free passage of all stakeholders in the area.\nDefense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr. said the government will keep standing behind the arbitral award for the welfare of the Filipinos.\nFor his part, Stratbase Institute President Professor Dindo Manhit underscored the importance of the arbitral ruling and cooperation with like-minded states amid China’s continuous aggression in the West Philippine Sea.\n“This year, we witnessed actions – the most aggressive by far – performed against our fellow Filipinos at sea…We have the whole of Philippine society behind us as we assert our rights in the West Philippine Sea, and the support of like-minded states in the community of nations. These give us hope and confidence that we will be able to safeguard our national sovereignty, territorial integrity, and economic rights in the West Philippine Sea. Our collective efforts, whether big or small, have a great impact on our collective pursuit of security and stability,” he said.\n“The legally binding arbitral ruling is clear: the West Philippine Sea is ours. It is the responsibility of all parties to abide by and recognize their obligations under international law. The position and the direction of our government are firm: we will not yield. We will never yield. We will be steadfast,” Manhit added.\nEditor’s Note: This is an updated article.

    "title": "'The worst possible time of year': Doctors warn about asthma inhaler switch coming in January",
    "text": "Manufacturer GSK has said it's discontinuing the branded asthma inhaler Flovent.\nStarting January 1, a drug that thousands of patients depend on to help them breathe will disappear from pharmacy shelves, and doctors are concerned patients may have delays switching to alternatives and getting them covered by insurance.\nManufacturer GSK has said it's discontinuing the branded asthma inhaler Flovent, and instead is making an \"authorized generic\" version, which is identical but without the same branding.\nPhysicians who treat patients with asthma say the authorized generic will work just as well as the branded drug, but it doesn't appear to be covered as widely by insurers. That may mean patients will have to obtain new prescriptions and sort out coverage hurdles at the height of respiratory virus season.\n\"This medication has been the most commonly used inhaled medication for the past 25 or 30 years,\" said Dr. Robyn Cohen, a pediatric pulmonologist at Boston Medical Center. \"It's the one that, overwhelmingly, pediatricians reach for when they decide that their patient needs a daily preventive medication. ... The fact that it's being discontinued is going to be a huge shock to the system for patients, for families and for doctors.\"\nDoctors are urging patients to take action now to ensure they've got their medicine heading into the new year and advocacy groups have been trying to get the word out.\nBut the story of why Flovent is disappearing, and the lack of insurance coverage for its ostensibly identical replacement, touches on some of the most complex facets of American health care and drug pricing.\nA spokeswoman for GSK said the company is making the change \"as part of our commitment to be ambitious for patients.\"\nShe noted the company introduced the authorized generics of Flovent HFA, an inhalation aerosol, and Flovent Diskus, an inhalation powder, in May 2022 and October 2023, and that, subsequently, it would discontinue manufacturing the branded versions in the United States on January 1, 2024.\nThe authorized generics, she said, \"will provide patients in the US with potentially lower cost alternatives of these medically important products.\"\nExperts who follow the industry both on Wall Street and in academia, though, point out GSK is making the switch at precisely the time a change in Medicaid rebates could cause the company to have to pay large penalties because of price increases on Flovent over a number of years.\nThe legal change coming into effect on the first of the year removes a cap on Medicaid rebates that companies are required to pay if they raise the price of medicines more than inflation.\n\"Flovent Diskus has been on the market since 2000 and Flovent HFA since 2004, and GSK has hiked the price on both products numerous times since their launch,\" Dr. William Feldman, an associate physician in the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital who studies asthma drugs, told CNN. \"These are precisely the sort of drugs that will be affected by the new policy eliminating the Medicaid rebate cap.\"\nUntil now, the rebates were capped at the total price of a drug, so manufacturers would never pay more than a drug costs back to Medicaid.\nBut under a provision in the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act, that limit was removed, and starting January 1, 2024, drugs that have been subject to large price increases over time could end up incurring rebates to Medicaid that are greater than their price - meaning pharmaceutical companies would sell those drugs to Medicaid at a loss.\n\"Obviously pharma doesn't want to be selling at a loss on anything in its portfolio,\" said Andrew Baum, an analyst who covers the stock of GSK and other pharmaceutical companies for the financial firm Citi. \"So it seeks to evade impact by, one: discontinuation; two: authorized generic.\"\nAn authorized generic, Baum told CNN, is viewed as a separate product, \"but still enables pharma to collect some of the economics.\"\nOr, put another way, it's the same product without the branding and also without the history of price increases that would leave the medicine vulnerable to such large rebates to Medicaid.\nAccording to data from GoodRx, the price of branded Flovent has gone up about 47% since 2014.\nOther drugmakers have made changes ahead of the January 1 rebate cap removal as well; makers of insulin this year announced major price cuts - of 70% or more - on their products, a move analysts estimate will save them hundreds of millions of dollars a year.\nThe authorized generic strategy GSK is employing \"is a way, broadly speaking, to maximize the profitability of the product in question,\" said David Amsellem, a financial analyst who covers the industry at investment firm Piper Sandler.\nHe noted there are currently no other generic versions of Flovent approved by the FDA.\nGSK did price the authorized generic lower than branded Flovent; one package of Flovent HFA in the 110 microgram dose, for example, costs $273.83, about 50% more than the $177.99 wholesale acquisition cost of its authorized generic counterpart, according to prices the company shared with CNN. The wholesale acquisition cost is the price before insurance and rebates.\nBut CVS Caremark, a major pharmacy benefit manager that determines which medicines are covered by insurance for its members, is giving preferential placement to another branded inhaler, Pulmicort, on its formulary, instead of the authorized generic versions of Flovent.\n\"In this case, the authorized generics were more expensive than the brand name medications,\" a CVS spokesman told CNN. He noted that's based on net prices, rather than the wholesale acquisition cost, meaning Pulmicort could be less expensive because of rebates its manufacturer, AstraZeneca, pays to obtain better insurance coverage.\nThe fact that insurance plans aren't broadly covering the authorized generic of Flovent, said BMC's Cohen, \"means that patients are going to need to get a brand new prescription for a completely different medication in the middle of the worst possible time of year, which is the winter respiratory virus season.\"\nFor patients with persistent asthma, Cohen said, Flovent has been the most commonly used daily preventive anti-inflammatory medication for decades. It shrinks swelling in the airways and reduces the body's exaggerated response to triggers that make it hard to breathe.\nDuring cold and flu season, she said, it becomes even more crucial to have that daily medicine.\n\"Flu, Covid, RSV - all these circulating viruses that are going around right now - are one of the biggest, if not the biggest, triggers for asthma attacks in kids,\" Cohen said. \"This is what leads to kids being in the emergency room.\"\nCohen said she's concerned that patients, as well as physicians and pharmacists, don't know this change with Flovent is coming, and they need to act now to work out alternatives and determine insurance coverage.\nFor some groups, the alternatives are more limited. For patients with a more rare inflammatory condition, called eosinophilic esophagitis, Flovent HFA is one of the most commonly prescribed topical steroids, and other medicines don't have as much data supporting their use in the condition, said Dr. Erin Syverson, an attending physician in the Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition at Boston Children's Hospital.\nAs EoE affects the esophagus, patients swallow the medicine instead of breathing it in, and it can tame the inflammation that can cause pain with swallowing or food getting stuck, requiring procedures to remove it. In kids, Syverson said, EoE can lead to recurrent vomiting, heartburn, belly aches, and trouble making progress starting solid foods, and Flovent can help keep the condition under control.\n\"With the discontinuation coming up, I worry it's going to just be one more hurdle for this patient population that already has very limited medications available to them,\" Syverson told CNN. \"I don't know what January is going to be like, but I'm worried.\"\nCNN's Tami Luhby contributed to this report.\nThe-CNN-Wire & 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

    "title": "Estes Park’s nonprofit center: “Baby sister” with big role",
    "text": "Estes Park’s nonprofit center: “Baby sister” with big role\nESTES PARK – More than 70 charitable and other nonprofit organizations make their home in Estes Park.\nGiven that Estes’ estimated 2021 population was 5,880, that’s one nonprofit for every 84 permanent residents of the tourism-dependent mountain village.\n“There are about 109 in total that are either located in Estes or in service to it,” said Caitlin “Cato” Kraft, executive director of the\nEstes Park Nonprofit Resource Center. “Compare that with Weld County, which has a population of 325,000 but 318 nonprofits. We have 109.”\nWhy have so many such groups sprung up and gravitated to such a small town? For Kraft, there are several easy answers.\n“We’re geographically isolated, with a lack of traditional government services, so there’s a natural inclination of people to do good,” she said. “Also, we have the oldest population in the state; we average 63.7 years old. For Larimer County as a whole, it’s 36, so we’re almost double that age. We have a ton of retirees, college-educated people who finally accomplished their lifelong dream of moving to the mountains and now they want to give back.”\nEstes’ nonprofit resource center was founded 21 years ago,” she said, “started by community members who saw the extreme growth of nonprofits in the Estes Valley and that they needed a centralized repository of nonprofits to help them meet their localized education, compliance and resource needs. The organization was created out of the need for a renewal and a refresh to support the nonprofit industry of Estes Park.\n“We’re almost like a chamber of commerce for nonprofits,” said Kraft, who was a BizWest Northern Colorado 40 Under Forty honoree in 2022 and a BizWest Women of Distinction nominee in 2023. “There’s not many micro-community-driven nonprofit resource centers like ours. If the Colorado Nonprofit Association had a baby sister and she ran away to the mountains, that would be us.”\nThe center’s intense focus on being “local” comes from the fact that negotiating the winding roads to get, as Estes Park residents say, “down valley” to resources in Fort Collins, Loveland, Longmont, Denver or other locations along the Front Range urban corridor can be a formidable and time-consuming chore, especially in inclement weather.\n“That’s why we work to provide training up here,” Kraft said, “so people don’t have to use their time to get down to Fort Collins or Denver, or on their computers when they could be doing other things.”\nThe center provides such services as a Better Business Bureau accreditation program and training in grant writing, marketing and board governance. It operates a grant-seeking database and a lending library, conducts monthly networking events and convenes separate meetings by sector.\nIt also offers a six-week workshop in diversity, equity and inclusion because, according to its website, the “Estes Park Nonprofit Resource Center stands against racism and harassment in every form. We believe an inclusive community is a strong community. We believe in working to make Estes Park a community where individuals of all ethnicities, identities and cultures can live, work and play safely without fear of discrimination or harassment.”\n“We’re also matchmakers,” she said. “We help to connect volunteers with nonprofits that need them. Because we have such close ties, we can connect those local voices and nonprofit resources together.\n“Nonprofits touch every single person in this community, either through volunteerism, philanthropy or being a recipient.”\nThat philanthropy piece looks a bit different in Estes Park, she said, because “nonprofits are the only sector that tourism doesn’t directly benefit.”\nThe center’s response is the fledgling “Giving Guest Program,” in which customers at businesses catering to tourists can round up their purchases at the point of sale. “This way, a lot of people who love to visit Estes year after year can support the ecosystem,” Kraft said.\nSo far, Trendz on the Park downtown and the Mountain Shop on east U.S. Highway 34 are participating in the roundup program, and two others label some of their offerings to indicate that part of the purchase price will benefit nonprofits. She said she hopes lodging guests would also be willing to contribute $1 to $2 extra in addition to their nightly room rates.\nThe center’s main annual fundraiser is the Nonprofit Prom. This year’s event will be held from 6:30 until 10 p.m. Jan. 20 at the Stanley Hotel. Tickets are on sale for $50 each through Jan. 12 or $65 thereafter, which includes what Kraft called a “procrastinator fee.”\nThe hotel is offering a $99 room deal for prom attendees, Kraft said, making it “a nice thing for our down-valley friends.”\nKraft sees the work of nonprofits as no less important in Estes Park than it is in Larimer County cities along the Interstate 25 urban corridor.",

    "text": "RICHBORO, Pa. (WPVI) - A family in Pennsylvania says they have a quick-thinking Taco Bell manager to thank for saving their child’s life. Natasha Long says the situation started when her 11-week-old baby suddenly stopped breathing while she was in the drive-thru at the fast-food restaurant. “It was the scariest moment of my entire life,” Long said. The mother of two had just finished some errands and decided to grab food when she says she noticed baby Myles struggling for air in the back seat of the car. “I pulled him out and he turned completely blue and was lifeless. At that point I just completely blacked out. I didn’t know what to do,” she said. Fortunately, Long was in earshot of Taco Bell manager Becky Arbaugh, who heard the mother’s screams and quickly jumped in to give baby Myles CPR. “I ran outside and took the baby,” Arbaugh said. “I then started to do chest compressions on the baby, and he finally started to breathe.” Long said the manager appeared out of nowhere like a guardian angel. According to Arbaugh, her own scares as a mother helped her prepare for a moment like this. “When my kids were little, my daughter had similar incidents. So, I knew what she was feeling, and there was no thought in my mind that the baby wasn’t going to breathe again,” Arbaugh said. Baby Myles did regain his breath and was rushed to Saint Christopher’s Hospital for treatment. The next day Long said she called Taco Bell to thank Arbaugh, who she calls her hero. “We couldn’t be more grateful to Becky. She saved my son’s life,” Long said. Baby Myles remains in the hospital as doctors try to understand what happened to him. Meanwhile, Long has been sending videos and pictures to Arbaugh -- who now has a deep bond with the family.

Also absent are the thousands of pilgrims who come annually from around the world to join in the celebrations, kept away by the war and suspension of most flights to Israel.\nIsraeli Jewish tourists, for their part, are also unlikely to visit the predominantly Arab town of Nazareth to enjoy the colorful decorations, parades and Christmas markets, as they grieve for those slaughtered by Hamas on Oct. 7 and process the national trauma.\nMost of the councils and religious associations representing the estimated 150,000 Arab Christians in Israel have announced plans to hold limited religious ceremonies or rituals in church buildings and compounds.\nAccess the Middle East news and analysis you can trust Join our community of Middle East readers to experience all of Al-Monitor, including 24/7 news, analyses, memos, reports and newsletters.\nSubscribe Only $100 for annual access.\nSign up for our newsletter Email Daily AM\nDaily Briefing New Weekly\nThe Takeaway Weekly\nWeek in Review Weekly\nBusiness & Tech Briefing Weekly\nSecurity Briefing Weekly\nChina-Middle East Briefing Weekly\nGulf Briefing Weekly\nTurkey Briefing Weekly\nIsrael Briefing Weekly\nPalestine Briefing Leave this field blank Videos The Israel-Hamas War: Live Q&A with Amb.
