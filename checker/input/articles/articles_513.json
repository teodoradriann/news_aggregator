    "text": "Angelenos hoping to cozy up by the fireplace this week should make other plans.\nThe South Coast Air Quality Management District has extended a no-burn order for much of Southern California through Thursday amid poor air quality. The agency chalks up the bad air to — coincidentally — residents enjoying holiday fires as well as \"stagnant\" weather.\nThe burn ban, which covers most of the region from the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys to just north of Oceanside, was first put into effect on Christmas Day.\n\"We've seen high levels of fine particle pollution over the past few days due to stagnant weather conditions and increased emissions from wood burning due to the holiday season,\" the South Coast AQMD said in a statement to The Times.\nStagnation occurs when an air mass lingers over an area, according to the National Weather Service. With little to no onshore or offshore air flow, particles from fires and other pollution, such as vehicle emissions, become concentrated in the atmosphere.\nThe AQMD ban prohibits the burning of wood and manufactured logs in fireplaces and outdoor wood-burning devices. Mountain communities above 3,000 feet and homes that rely on wood-burning furnaces are exempt.\nParticles from burning wood build up in the air and can cause asthma attacks and other respiratory issues, which can lead to an increase in hospitalizations and emergency room visits.\nIf the agency doesn't see an improvement in air quality, the burn ban could be extended to Friday.\nBut wet weather is in the forecast and could help clear the air.\nLos Angeles could see as much as an inch of rain in a storm set to arrive Friday and continue through Saturday.\n\"Rain showers expected over the holiday weekend should help reduce fine particle concentrations, making a No-Burn Alert unlikely on Saturday,\" the agency said.\n©2023 Los Angeles Times.

    "text": "Senate President Pro Tempore Martin Looney, D-New Haven, Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, and Sen. Matt Lesser, D-Middletown, Thursday said they want “a more detailed explanation” from the state Department of Social Services on the\nsix week delay in the Summer EBT program.\nFamilies in need in Connecticut were set to receive millions of dollars in federal food assistance this week, but a day before the funds were scheduled to arrive, the State Department of Social Services announced that disbursements for the\nnew summer program will be delayed until August.\nThe senators’ joint statement said. “Families expecting these benefits during the summer will be unable to access them until their children will already be preparing for the new school year.\n“Delays and issues happen, but the lack of explanation surrounding this change does not answer our constituents’ questions. The last-minute announcement will have a detrimental effect for thousands of families and will increase food insecurity across our communities,” they said. “Summer programs need to be active during the summer, not near the end of it – we hope the Department of Social Services can provide more information regarding this delay and find ways to help the families who may struggle in its absence.”\nDSS told families that eligible households would receive an extra $120 per child on Sunday, June 23, through the Summer Electronic Benefits for Children Program — a federal grocery benefit that launched this year to address summertime food insecurity among students who receive free and reduced-price meals during the school year.\nAs many as 273,000 children in the state qualify for the program, according to DSS. But on Saturday, June 22, the department announced in a Facebook post that “unexpected delays” pushed back the start of the program. With no further explanation, DSS said families will not receive the $120 deposits until early August.\nIn a statement emailed to the Courant, DSS Deputy Communications Director Christine Stuart said Connecticut is in possession of the federal money required for the program. Stuart said the state received its portion of the Summer EBT allocation in May after the USDA approved the state’s initial plan for operations and management of the program in late April.\nRead more about the\n EBT issue here.",

    "text": "Honey Recall: Foreign Sugars Detected in Latvian Honey Products RIGA — May 9, 2024 — Latvian authorities have taken action following laboratory findings. Five honey products are being pulled from shelves after tests revealed the presence of foreign sugars, a key indicator of potential honey adulteration. The plant Products Division is leading investigations into the source of the tainted honey, working to ensure the integrity of the supply chain. For further updates on this developing story, stay tuned.\nHoney Recall: Foreign Sugars Detected in Latvian Honey Products Latvian authorities have suspended the sale of five honey products after laboratory tests revealed the presence of foreign sugars. The Plant Products Division (PVD) took action following analyses conducted by a specialized laboratory in Austria, raising concerns about potential tampering and the integrity of the honey supply.\nThe Discovery Maris Eiklons, head of the PVD’s Plant Products Division, explained the rationale behind the suspension: The five samples show that there is something wrong with the honey. The presence of foreign sugars. Honey is honey, there should be nothing foreign present in honey, so the service decided to suspend these suspicious batches. He further elaborated, The honey may have been tampered with, and some cheaper sugars may have been added.\nDid you know? Honey is primarily composed of glucose and fructose. The presence of other sugars, such as sucrose or high-fructose corn syrup, can indicate adulteration. Why the Adulteration? According to Eiklons, the addition of cheaper sugars is highly likely a cost-saving measure. While the PVD assures consumers that the adulterated honey is not harmful to human health, the practice raises ethical and economic concerns within the beekeeping industry.\nRetailer Response Major retailers like Rimi Latvia emphasize their commitment to quality control. Inga Bite, public relations manager at Rimi Latvia, stated:\nWe ourselves request laboratory tests from our suppliers who produce and supply honey to our stores. Simultaneously occurring, we carry out random checks on products in Rimi stores, testing in laboratories that are properly certified, and our checks have not revealed any tampering.\nInga Bite, public relations manager at Rimi Latvia\nDespite these assurances, the PVD’s findings highlight potential gaps in the supply chain monitoring.\nBeekeepers’ Perspective Local beekeepers express concerns about the influx of unnatural honey imports into Europe. Valters Brusbārdis,head of the Latvian Beekeeping Society,highlighted the economic challenges faced by domestic producers:\nThe retail chains are not really aware of the seriousness of the problem. So I think it’s a good signal for these chains too to think and rethink the product they are importing and selling. I think it is more ignorance.The problem is EU-wide.\nvalters Brusbārdis, head of the Latvian Beekeeping Society\nBrusbārdis noted that imported honey can be significantly cheaper, sometimes up to half the price of locally produced honey, making it tough for Latvian beekeepers to compete.\nPro Tip: Support local beekeepers by purchasing honey directly from farmers’ markets or local producers. This ensures you’re getting pure, unadulterated honey and helps sustain local agriculture. The Source of the Problem The EU imports significant quantities of honey from third countries, with China being identified as a notably problematic source, according to Brusbārdis. The lower production costs in these countries can lead to unfair competition and incentivize adulteration.\nOngoing Investigation The PVD is conducting further investigations into the withdrawn honey, tracing its origin and distribution. To date, 13 samples of honey from Latvian shops have been tested, and these checks are ongoing, signaling a continued effort to ensure the quality and authenticity of honey available to consumers.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Why was the honey recalled? The honey was recalled due to the presence of foreign sugars, indicating potential adulteration. Is the adulterated honey harmful? The PVD assures that the adulterated honey is not harmful to human health. Where did the adulterated honey come from? The PVD is currently investigating the origin of the honey. What are retailers doing to prevent this? Retailers like Rimi Latvia conduct laboratory tests on their suppliers’ honey and perform random checks in stores. How can I ensure I’m buying pure honey? Purchase honey from local beekeepers or trusted sources,and look for certifications of purity.",
