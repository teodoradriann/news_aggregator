    "text": "Silent Threat: Osteoporosis Affects Millions of American Women Millions of American women face a hidden health risk: osteoporosis, a condition that weakens bones and increases the risk of fractures. ⁣Frequently⁢ enough called ⁢a “silent disease,” osteoporosis doesn’t present noticeable symptoms until a bone breaks, making early detection crucial.\nWhile some illnesses announce themselves with⁣ clear warning signs, others remain hidden, leading to delayed diagnoses. The Spanish Society of Endocrinology and nutrition (SEEN) highlights the silent threat of osteoporosis, a condition affecting 80% of women over 80.This alarming statistic underscores the‌ importance of understanding and preventing this often-overlooked disease.\nA Fractured Reality The ⁣biggest challenge with osteoporosis is ‌its lack‍ of symptoms. ‌ Many women only discover they have ‌the condition‍ after experiencing a fracture from a ​minor fall.”How can a simple stumble lead to a broken bone?” you might ask.The answer‍ often lies in weakened bones, a hallmark of osteoporosis.\nOsteoporosis doesn’t cause pain or discomfort, and ‌it doesn’t offer any obvious signs of ⁤its presence.diagnosis typically occurs after a fracture prompts further examination, revealing lower-than-normal bone mineral density. Even minor bumps or falls can result in fractures as the bones have become fragile.\nMenopause and Bone Health The fact that 80% of ​women over 80 suffer from osteoporosis is no coincidence. Women entering menopause are also‌ at increased⁣ risk of⁤ bone loss, further highlighting the link between hormonal ​changes and bone health.\nDr. María Cortés Berdonces, coordinator of the Bone Mineral ‌Metabolism Group at SEEN, explains, “Menopause is characterized by a decline in estrogen levels,‌ which disrupts the balance between bone formation and breakdown, leading to bone loss.”\n[Image: Illustration of a healthy bone vs. a bone affected by osteoporosis]\nThis ‌delicate balance is essential for maintaining strong bones throughout life. As‍ estrogen levels decrease during menopause, bone breakdown outpaces bone formation, increasing‍ the risk of osteoporosis and fractures.\nSilent Bone Loss: Understanding Osteoporosis and Protecting Your Health Millions of americans, particularly women, face an increased risk of osteoporosis, a condition that weakens bones and increases fracture risk. While age and menopause are inevitable contributors, experts say proactive steps can help slow its progression and maintain bone health.\nOsteoporosis, frequently enough called a “silent‍ disease,” develops gradually, often without noticeable symptoms until a fracture⁢ occurs. Dr.⁤ Emily Carter,a leading endocrinologist,explains,”Bone loss accelerates in the first 5-7⁣ years after menopause​ and can⁣ worsen with age due to additional ‌factors that contribute to osteoporosis.”\nWhile the natural‍ decline in bone density is unavoidable,‍ Dr. Carter⁢ emphasizes that “we can partially prevent osteoporosis or at least slow its progression by protecting our bones from negative factors and providing them with the nutrients they need.”\nLifestyle Choices Play‍ a Crucial Role\nRegular physical activity and ⁢avoiding ‌a sedentary​ lifestyle are vital at all ages, but become even more ‌critical after 50. ‍\n“Exercise, especially weight-bearing activities, helps build and maintain bone density,” says Dr. ⁣Carter. “A ⁤balanced diet rich in ⁤calcium, vitamin D,‌ and magnesium is also essential for bone health.”\nEarly Detection and prevention are Key\nOsteoporosis has no cure, but its progression can be slowed, and bone strength can be maintained.Dr. Carter stresses the importance ​of proactive measures after age 50 and during menopause. “Up to 65% of people who experience an osteoporosis-related fracture were unaware they had the‍ condition. Taking steps to protect ​bone health can considerably reduce fracture risk.”\nTalk to​ your​ doctor about your risk factors for‌ osteoporosis and discuss strategies for prevention and early detection.\nA⁣ Silent Threat: Unlocking the ⁤Secrets of ⁣Osteoporosis with Dr. Emily carter By: [Yoru Name], News Director, NewsDirectory3.com\nOsteoporosis, a silent ​threat affecting millions of American women,​ is a growing public health concern. Frequently enough called‌ a “silent disease,” osteoporosis weakens bones, making them ‌prone to fractures, and often revealing itself only after a debilitating break.\nTo shed⁣ light on this frequently enough-overlooked condition, we spoke with Dr. Emily Carter, a leading expert in bone health and a dedicated advocate for osteoporosis prevention and treatment.\nNewsDirectory3.com: Dr. Carter, ‍thank you for joining ⁢us.Can you elaborate on ⁣how‌ widespread ​the problem of osteoporosis is ‌among American women?\nDr. Emily Carter: ‌Absolutely. osteoporosis ‌is incredibly‍ common. It‍ affects an estimated 8⁣ million women in the United ​States alone, and another 26 million are at ​risk. That means nearly one in three women over the age of⁢ 50 will suffer a fracture due to osteoporosis in their lifetime.Sadly, many are unaware they have the condition until after a fracture occurs.\nNewsDirectory3.com: What are the primary ‍causes of osteoporosis?\nDr.‌ Emily Carter: Several factors contribute to osteoporosis.\n⁣Age is ​a important one. ‍As we age, bone density naturally declines. ⁢\nOther key factors ​include genetics, family⁤ history,​ weight, physical ​inactivity, and ⁢nutritional deficiencies, particularly lack‍ of calcium and vitamin D.\n* Certain medications and medical conditions, like hormonal imbalances, can also play a role.\nNewsDirectory3.com: ‍What are the early warning signs, and how can women‍ be proactive about their bone health?\nDr. Emily Carter: The challenge is that osteoporosis frequently enough has no noticeable symptoms​ until a fracture occurs. Early detection is vital.​ Women should talk to their doctors about their⁤ risk factors and consider a bone density test,especially after age 65.\nLifestyle changes are critical for prevention.Building strong bones throughout life‍ with a diet rich in ⁤calcium and vitamin⁣ D,regular weight-bearing exercise like walking or dancing,and avoiding smoking and⁢ excessive alcohol consumption are all essential.\nNewsDirectory3.com: What treatment options ‌are available for women diagnosed with osteoporosis?\nDr. Emily Carter: Several effective treatments can help slow bone loss and reduce fracture risk. These include medication like bisphosphates, hormone therapy, and other bone-strengthening drugs. In ⁤addition, maintaining a healthy lifestyle and engaging in regular physical activity remain essential.\nNewsDirectory3.com: What⁤ message⁤ would you like to share with​ our‍ readers about osteoporosis?\nDr. Emily Carter: My message is simple: Don’t ignore your bone health.Talk to your doctor about your risk factors, prioritize a healthy lifestyle, ⁣and don’t hesitate to get tested if‌ needed. Preventing fractures and maintaining mobility as we age is within our reach.\nNewsDirectory3.com: ⁢Thank you for your insightful comments, Dr. Carter.\nWe ‍hope this interview raises awareness about osteoporosis and​ encourages women to​ take‍ charge of​ their bone health.

Dada su recurrente estulticia se nota que el mapa de su pensamiento está desmingado, tampoco bochan una contimás dos.\nY no son pocos aunque tampoco la mar de muchos, el típico blabisblebloblusaurio luce estar entre estrechos límites; yo no soy un Schemel pero apuesto a que los susodichos medran entre 0 y 2% que votó no a la recuperación del Estado Bolivariano Esequibo por parte de Venezuela.\nTal aproximable 2 % de ique venezolanos me llaman la atención porque a mi modo de ver constituyen un núcleo de fascismo y a eso hay que prestarle atención y de ser posible, tocarlos como a hermanos por si enderezan el rumbo.\nCuando me lo contaron yo pensé que se trataba de una mamadera´e gallo pero al escarbar la evidencia tuve que creerlo.\n–Mira, #)&8=¿¡∞§*€‡π, sácale punta a esta vaina… (me dijeron copete´epellejo y cara´e repuesto).\nUn Blabis de entre ese mar de tales que se manifiestan en la red asevera y con lujo de detalles, años, meses, semanas, días y minutos en que no ha comido pollo por culpa de Maduro, y por ahí se va echando pestes contra la ique dictadura, dice también que sobrevive a merced de una remesa de 100 $ que le vienen del exterior.\nYo no me eché a llorar por esa tragedia debido a que el hombre puja pero no llora, a menos que sea por culpa de una mujer ingrata que lo ha botado a uno y en cuyo caso uno jipea pero escondido en un rincón y abrazado a un frasco de cocuy; pero montar una llorica en la red por no comer pollo es recrearse en la sandez.\nAdemás, comer pollo no es recomendable para los hombres (el que entendió entendió).\nYo soy bruto, no lo niego, pero sé que escarbar la causa prima sobre recrearse en la consecuencia; de ahí que considero que el desmingado blabis de marras haga un replanteamiento de su discurso de intrigas.\nTodo Blabis hace como una culebra, se estira y se enrolla, se vuelve a estirar y prosigue rumiando su veneno antes de lanzar su ataque contra el Presidente Maduro y cual el más ilustrado guionista teje con erudita filigrana su drama a tal punto que mereciera un Oscar porque se las trae.\nPero se les ven las costuras, de tanto odiar terminan por odiarse a sí mismos.",

Naturally, Apple is fighting the allegations.\nSiOnyx is a company that manufactures image sensors and camera components for low light vision applications. Their products are used in a variety of fields, including boating, hunting, surveillance, and imaging and camera technology for the U.S. Department of Defense.\nAs noted by AppleInsider , the lawsuit claims that Apple had infringed on the patents, referred to as “Pixel Isolation Elements, Devices, and Associated Methods,” discussing improvements to photosensitive devices. By using silicon-based photonics, the complaint said that companies could create smaller, lower-cost, and higher-performance photonic devices for imaging purposes.\nIn December, SiOnyx amended the complaint to include that Apple had pre-suit knowledge of three patents, reports law.com (a subscription is required to read the entire article).\nYesterday Apple responded to the complaint by filing a motion to strike some of the new allegations, the article adds. Working for Apple, attorney Michael D. Strapp of DLA Piper wanted for some of the case to be dismissed, because SiOnyx failed to state a claim.",

It also hacks any communication mechanisms you have on your phone. It steals all the information from the Gmail application, all the Facebook messages, all the Facebook information, your Facebook contacts, everything on Skype, WhatsApp, Viber, WeChat, Telegram, etc. August 2016, Lookout Vice President of Research Mike Murray and Citizen Lab, a digital rights watchdog at the University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs, set foot in the biggest cyberespionage case in history.\nAt the helm, the Israeli company NSO Group , born in 2010 and discreetly established in Luxembourg via a string of companies four years later. A global outcry against a backdrop of revelations about the spying on journalists and activists in different countries: some were killed, others tortured and others constantly spied on.\nState technology or not state technology? And, eight years later, the irony has changed in nature: if the affair forced the NSO group to reinvent itself in another string of companies, always in Israel, always in Luxembourg and always in the United States, the giant Apple once again, at the end of October, asked the American justice system to forget its complaint. Too afraid that a trial will bring to light the security flaws of the technological company which has long marketed the inviolability of its technologies. However, it was via flaws that Apple engineers did not themselves know that the Israeli stars carried out their espionage.\nIronically, NSO Group’s American lawyers first tried to defend the idea that their company was linked to the Israeli state and that Apple could therefore not act against it, which the American justice system rejected. rejected, before the Israeli state decided, this year, to confiscate all the documents that NSO should have brought to it on a platter.\nThe end of the legal troubles is not for tomorrow, for NSO: at the end of September, four men residing in Great Britain (a Bahraini activist tortured by the Bahraini government, Yusuf al-Jamri; the founder and CEO of the Cordoba Foundation based in United Kingdom, Anas Altikriti; the British-Palestinian academic and activist, Azzam Tamimi, and the president of the Finsbury Park mosque in London, Mohammed Kozbar) seized British justice via a complaint prepared by Leanna Burnard, lawyer at the Global Legal Action Network, based in the United Kingdom, and supported by Monika Sobiecki, partner at the law firm Bindmans based in London. Targeted, according to certain media, are NSO Group (Israel); its parent company, Q Cyber ​​Technologies (Luxembourg), and Novalpina Capital (London-based private equity firm that purchased NSO in 2019). In total, around thirty complaints of this type are awaiting legal action, in Israel, Spain, the United States and Colombia.\nThis week, as part of the bloody operations carried out in the Gaza Strip in response to the attack on Israel by Hamas a little over a year ago, the Committee for a Just Peace in the Middle East, associated to Action Solidarité Tiers Monde and Amnesty International, demanded that the Luxembourg government refer the matter to the authorities concerned by human rights violations so that they prevent NSO Group from continuing to serve its customers.\nProperty Discussions According to the Public Prosecutor’s Office and public data in the Commercial Register, Novalpina is still in voluntary liquidation in Luxembourg after having paid a final dividend of almost 18 million euros to its shareholders in January 2021.\nBut one of the founders, Omri Lavie, regained control of the company, via his creditors and his new Luxembourg holding company, Dufresne Holding, according to the Israeli media Calcalist and according to documents registered in the Register of beneficial owners.\nOmri Lavie has regained control of the three key entities of NSO Group, via its new holding company, Dufresne Holding. (Photo: Modern House)\nNeither NSO Group nor the Americans from Treo Asset Management came back to us to take stock of the situation.\nHaving a foot directly in the United States would allow the group to get off the American blacklist by passing under American capital.

It becomes important as we get into like the treacherous weather territory,\" Fay noted.\nStaying weather aware into this weekend, Fay urges people to carry cash, especially in the event of power outages.\n\"When we face power outages, we're looking at banking systems going down, ATMs, card machines not working, and we really don't, especially these days, we don't have cash on us, so it's always good to have a couple hundred bucks set aside,\" Fay said.\nAccording to Fay, if you have that cash in that situation, keep this in mind.\n\"General rule of thumb when you go to like a small business, most of the time they have a sign that they can't break 50 or 100 dollar bills, so keep things under 20 dollar bills just to make sure you have something in there,\" Fay noted.\nIn the latter part of the week, Fay addressed the overall outlook for Be Ready Lexington and forecast late this weekend.\n\"Just a general preparedness, for getting some of that, being prepared to salt driveways, shovel yourself out. It's very broad at this point and that's the frustrating part,\" Fay said.\nFay emphasizes her biggest takeaway.\n\"Information is your biggest friend when it comes to severe weather, knowing what's coming, knowing when it's coming and how you can be prepared,\" Fay noted.\nThe overall message from Fay?

    "text": "Philadelphia, PA, July 11, 2024 — Today, the Senate passed the 2024-25 PA Budget, which Senator Sharif Street (SD-3) lauded as “historic” in its investments in the people of Pennsylvania. Despite missed opportunities to increase the minimum wage, end cannabis prohibition, invest in paid sick leave, and expand funding for Whole Home Repairs, Senator Street expressed his overall satisfaction with the budget. “I am proud to vote for a PA Budget that prioritizes the people of Pennsylvania, doesn’t increase taxes, and better reflects our moral responsibility to provide safety for our communities, meet every day needs, and provide a quality education for our students,” said Senator Street. Education Pennsylvania’s school funding system has been inadequate and unconstitutional, but this budget makes a significant down payment toward righting the wrongs that have impacted countless students across the commonwealth, including in Philadelphia. Over $1 billion is being added for Pre-K to 12 education, including: - $526 million increase for Ready to Learn - $285 million increase for Basic Education Funding - $100 million increase for Special Education - $100 million in new funding for Cyber Charter Transition Senator Street praised investments in the Philadelphia School District and Career Technical Education stating that “a $220 million allocation for Philadelphia’s School District is significant, and the authorization of another $100 million for school infrastructure will allow us to address the aging and toxic school environments that continue to put our students and educators at risk. I have long advocated for increased funding of Career Technical Education to ensure our students have multiple avenues to post-secondary success. I’m proud to see investments of $30 million in Career Technical Education. Higher Education This budget permanently invests in Community Colleges ($277 million) and prioritizes funding to public institutions of higher education that seek to expand dual-enrollment programs. It also requires institutions to make financial aid counseling available to every student while establishing the Grow Pennsylvania Scholarship Grant Program within the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency (PHEAA). Beginning in 2024-2025, PHEAA will be responsible for awarding grants up to $5,000 per academic year to Pennsylvania students who agree to work in the Commonwealth for 12 months for every year of the grant the student accepts. PHEAA will be required to conduct public outreach to traditionally underserved communities. Overall, the budget allocates $35 million for PASSHE schools, a 6% increase from last year, and includes over $140 million for grants, scholarships, and other programs that will make higher education more affordable in Pennsylvania. Community Safety Investments in violence prevention groups have proven effective, as Philadelphia has seen the largest decline in gun violence nationwide following historic funding (FY22-23) of these programs. Senator Street, who has advocated for these increases including funding for Safe School Corridors called an additional $21.5 million in community safety funding ($85M statewide), “investments we know will save lives”, adding that “student safety is imperative to learning, and the allocation of $120 million for School Safety and Security are critical resources we can put toward providing better security to our students to and from school.” Child Care Tax Credits Starting in 2025, Pennsylvania businesses can receive a tax credit for helping employees with childcare costs. For every dollar an employer contributes to an employee’s childcare expenses, they can get back 30 cents in tax credits, up to $500 per employee. This new policy aims to make childcare more affordable for working families while encouraging employers to support their staff’s childcare needs. Healthcare Affordability Senator Street joined Governor Shapiro in signing policy to expand Telemedicine, bringing access to medical services to some of our most vulnerable communities. This budget also establishes the Affordability Assistance Program under the Pennsylvania Health Insurance Exchange Authority. People purchasing a health insurance plan on the exchange will receive financial assistance to cover the cost of the insurance based on their income. “Together, we have taken significant steps forward in serving the people of Pennsylvania without increasing taxes,” said Street “we’ve made significant investments into education and building safer communities.
