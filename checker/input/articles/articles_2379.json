    "text": "AUBURN, Maine — Several hundred athletes, coaches, and supporters from across Maine got a chance to showcase their winter sports skills at the annual [Special Olympics Maine](https://www.somaine.org/) Winter Games. The two-day event kicked off Wednesday in Auburn. But unseasonably warm temperatures and a lack of snow left organizers of the celebration of inclusivity scrambling to find a new venue for some events. Under a brilliant sun Thursday, more than 300 Special Olympics athletes came together to showcase their hard work and determination. Clicking into ski bindings, athletes from across the state made their way up the slopes of Lost Valley in Auburn. At the bottom of the hill, Special Olympians did some carving of their own on the cross-country trails. Others tore it up racing in snowshoes. \"What do you like about the Special Olympics Winter Games? It's awesome, awesome,\" snowshoe competitor Amanda Fecteau enthused. The annual competition is also helping build confidence. \"At first I was kind of worried about my leg getting cramped up, but it wasn't that bad after a while,\" Nick Neptune explained. Jennifer Cativera is coached by her mom, Regina Kahkonen. Both are members of [Central Maine Adaptive Sports.](https://centralmaineadaptivesports.org/) The nonprofit based at Lost Valley provides year-round sports and recreational opportunities, like skiing and snowboarding, for people of all abilities. \"She loves the camaraderie with everybody and competition of course,\" Regina added. Cross-country and snowshoe events were originally scheduled to be held at Pineland Farm in New Gloucester, but a serious lack of snow forced the events to relocate last minute to Lost Valley. On Wednesday, dozens of athletes skated for glory on the speed skating track at Norway Savings Bank Arena. There were also free health screenings at Edward Little High School, including blood pressure checks, to help people with developmental disabilities from falling through the cracks when it comes to getting preventative health care. Grace Stults is the health and wellness manager for Special Olympics Maine. \"I follow up with them to see if they need a primary care doctor, if they need follow-up care, and help with their insurance,\" Stults explained. Two thousand athletes, coaches, and supporters are expected to attend the Special Olympics Maine State Summer Games at the University of Maine on June 7, 8, and 9.",

Image Credits : X-@GautengHealth-1 Simphiwe Mabhena 19 September 2024, 21:40 [SAST]\n3 minutes The Gauteng Health Department says it’s bringing back retired staff to assist with the healthcare backlogs at its hospitals.\nThis is part of their commitment towards working on the poor state of the public health facilities in the province.\nGauteng Health MEC Nomantu Nkomo-Ralehoko was speaking at the launch of new wards at the Mamelodi Regional Hospital in Gauteng.\nThe department says it is trying to speed up processes to improve the state of some of the province’s health facilities like the Steve Biko Academic Hospital, the Tembisa Tertiary Hospital and Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital, among others.\nMEC Nkomo-Ralehoko says, “Gauteng provincial government is committed to improve the infrastructure of hospitals and clinics. We understand that infrastructure is the backbone of our healthcare system. We are officially unveiling five newly refurbished areas and three extended wards here at Mamelodi Regional Hospital. This will ease the pressure and allow us to cater for more patients.”\nThis comes as a video by broadcaster Tom London exposed alleged maltreatment of patients by staff and neglected infrastructure at the Helen Joseph Hospital in Johannesburg.\nLondon said this in his video which has since gone viral on social media. “The doctors run around here, they treat patients like cockroaches. I haven’t seen one doctor walk up to a patient and greet.”\nGauteng Health Head of Department Lesiba Malotana admits that they don’t have enough funds for refurbishments.\nBut he says they are working around the clock to resolve it. “There is a R250 million maintenance shortfall budget, just for the upkeep. That is the argument that we are taking to the province to say that there is an old and ailing infrastructure how then do we maintain that without building new, just to make it work? The province has responded by saying please quantify those needs and come and see how can we help on that.”\nThe Democratic Nursing Organisation of South Africa (DENOSA) weighs in on the MEC’s pronouncements.\n“As DENOSA in Gauteng, we welcome the pronouncement by the MEC to say that they are attending to infrastructure issues. Because we have long cried out to say that the infrastructure needs urgent attention. In terms of employment, we will wait and see because currently, we are still engaging the department in terms of addressing the issue of nurses who are said to be out of contracts.”\n“Because the issue of shortage of nurses is a reality that our members live with on the ground and we are hoping that the department will be true to their words and fill those vacant positions”\nWhile working on infrastructure, the department says they are aware of the shortage of staff in their institutions, and bringing back retired staff to help with training programmes is one of their resolutions.\nThe video below is reporting more on the story:\nAuthor Simphiwe Mabhena\nView all posts MOST READ",

The United States, with the support of the United Kingdom, Japan, and Canada, proposed to continue preparatory work so that the options would be ready for consideration by G7 leaders at a potential meeting around February 24. Although no decisions have been made, and the issue remains a subject of heated debate in European capitals, the acceleration of work on the confiscation of Russian assets for Ukraine emphasizes its growing importance to the West, the article says. [Bridgestone sells its assets in Russia](/rubric-economy/3803043-bridgestone-sells-its-assets-in-russia.html) According to informed sources, this topic was discussed this month by both G7 finance ministers and their deputies. The three working groups proposed by Washington will examine the legal issues surrounding confiscation; how to implement such a policy and mitigate the risks; and options for how best to target support to Ukraine. Germany, France, Italy, and the EU expressed some reservations, as well as the need to carefully assess the legality of Moscow's asset confiscation before making a decision. Several European ministers emphasized the need to maintain a high level of secrecy in this work. [Germany wants to seize EUR 720M worth of Russian assets](/rubric-economy/3802770-germany-wants-to-seize-eur-720m-worth-of-russian-assets.html) According to the newspaper, Western capitals are considering various options, ranging from direct confiscation and spending of the Russian central bank's assets to earning income from frozen assets or using them as collateral for loans. The EU has not yet confiscated Russian assets but is instead exploring ways to seize profits earned by financial institutions such as Euroclear, which holds sovereign assets worth €191 billion, the publication says. Washington has not yet publicly supported the seizure of Russian assets. However, this year, the United States privately circulated a discussion paper within the G7, suggesting that the seizure of Moscow's frozen assets would be legitimate as a countermeasure to encourage Russia to stop its war of aggression. [Recovery of $5B from Russia for Crimean assets of Naftogaz: UK court recognizes Hague decision](/rubric-economy/3802230-recovery-of-5b-from-russia-for-crimean-assets-of-naftogaz-uk-court-recognizes-hague-decision.html) However, Europe, where most of the assets are located, is much more cautious, fearing possible consequences for financial stability and retaliation from Russia. Italy, which will hold the G7 presidency in 2024, is among those concerned about potential retaliation against its companies operating in Russia, which Moscow has already threatened. Russia has also warned that it will cut off diplomatic relations with the United States in response to any asset confiscation. The EU, Britain, and France also emphasized that this money would not be readily available, would not be sufficient to cover Ukraine's reconstruction needs, and that the seizure of assets should not come at the expense of financial support for Kyiv in 2024. [Putin turns West's boycott into super-profits for his elite - media](/rubric-economy/3801763-putin-turns-wests-boycott-into-superprofits-for-his-elite-media.html) According to the publication, over the past two years, the G7 has been able to overcome disagreements among its members several times over economic measures against Russia, including the initial broad package of sanctions and the establishment of a cap on the price of Russian oil. As Ukrinform reported, Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani assured that Ukraine will remain in the spotlight during Italy's G7 presidency next year.

    "text": "Features | Health and Wellness Work impacts our mental health. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared the theme for this year’s World Mental Health Day to be “Mental Health at Work”. Conversely, mental health can also affect work. According to the WHO, poor mental health costs the global economy nearly US$1 trillion. There is increasing emphasis on the need for better care of employees’ mental health. Singapore is among the top three markets in South-East Asia with the highest levels of burnout. Another study revealed that 61% of Singaporean employees are struggling with burnout. Although employers are paying more attention to supporting their workforce’s mental health, more can be done. While some organisations offer Employee Assistance Programmes (EAPs), the scope and services provided can vary. As a result, employees may not receive adequate support. AI, already enhancing numerous industries, could play a part in plugging this gap. AI-assisted therapy addresses the soaring demand for mental healthcare, at a time when there are not enough mental health professionals. More cost-effective than traditional therapy, AI-assisted therapy enables employers to provide more extensive support to their employees at lower financial cost. As people become more accustomed to interacting with chatbots, millions are seeking therapeutic support through therapy chatbots. By no means is a therapy chatbot meant to replace therapy with a healthcare professional. Nothing can replace the presence of a compassionate, attuned fellow human being in alleviating human suffering. However, for many people, therapy chatbots can be an accessible tool for managing their mental health. “AI-assisted therapy addresses the soaring demand for mental healthcare, at a time when there are not enough mental health professionals.” – Sarah Poh, CEO, The Therapy Platform The nature of chatbots allows them to provide client education and support in a conversational way. By gathering context from client interactions, they adjust their messaging to align with an individual’s specific communication preferences, problems and goals. This can help clients feel more comfortable and engaged with a chatbot, leading to more open discussions and better therapeutic outcomes. In the United States, a study of 1,200 users of a therapy chatbot found that a “therapeutic alliance” between bot and user formed within five days. Users believed that the bot not only liked and respected them, but that it cared. This led to feelings of “honesty, safety and comfort” with the chatbot. Unlike human therapists, the AI chatbot is accessible 24/7, providing support without the need for appointments or travel. When clients come with a given problem or stressor, the bot responds in ways a real therapist might — asking questions, suggesting coping mechanisms, setting goals and offering to hold them accountable. In between therapy sessions, the chatbot can offer personalised advice and coping strategies — such as breathing exercises, journal prompts and words of affirmations. Ironically, some clients may feel more comfortable sharing sensitive information with the chatbot over a human therapist. In one study of 500 therapy-goers, more than 90 percent confessed to having lied to their therapist at least once. But with a chatbot, clients feel empowered to say what they want without the fear of offending or burdening anyone. They can safely and anonymously discuss their darkest moments without fear of judgment. Despite their advantages, therapy chatbots are not a substitute for real therapists. They cannot make diagnoses or prescribe medication, and they are not held to the same ethical and legal standards as licensed healthcare professionals. More importantly, they lack the emotional intelligence and sophisticated understanding of trained mental health professionals. At The Therapy Platform, we see AI as a useful tool to support our therapists’ work, but certainly not a replacement for our therapists. By reducing their administration work by 90%, AI frees our therapists’ time to focus on building quality connections with our clients. Trained on Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, an evidence-based psychotherapy modality, our therapy chatbot nudges clients to identify their thinking patterns as well as elicit reflection and perspective-taking while monitoring their mental health progress. Using data from the chatbot, our therapists can also detect potential issues before they become more serious. This supports our therapists in accurate case formulation and designing more comprehensive treatment plans. This data-driven approach not only helps our therapists to be updated on our clients’ mental states and response to therapy, but it can also provide employers with valuable information about their employees’ mental health. Employers who sign up for our service as part of their EAP are provided reports with quantitative insights based on employee usage of the chatbot and qualitative reports on their wellbeing. We go a step further by designing guidelines and coaching programmes for leaders and managers, based on anonymised input from the team members and the results of their personality assessments. READ MORE: Singapore’s AI growth: A game changer for talent management There is good reason for the increasing focus on workplace mental health. Amid mounting geopolitical tensions, heightened uncertainties and the AI revolution that is changing the future of work, to say that workers are stressed is an understatement. People are feeling that the job demands made on them often outstrip their resources. In such times, having a therapeutic resource in the form of an intelligent chatbot that offers a listening ear, personalised advice, psychological safety and 24/7 availability can make all the difference to employee mental health.

    "text": "Vermilion Parish, KATC - It’s a common sight after a heavy rainstorm to see streets submerged under murky floodwaters, and cars trying to muscle their way through them. But before pressing the gas pedal, drivers may want to consider what it could cost them.\n“It ain’t a good idea, it can get very expensive,” said Marlin Istre, owner of Cajun Pro Automotive Repair in Abbeville.\nIstre has run his shop for nearly two decades, and he’s seen the consequences of water inside the engines and flooded electrical systems time and time again.\n“Some people bring them in and we can save them, and they’ll drive it for a while and get rid of it, or insurance will tow them out,” he said.\nFlood-related repairs are a regular part of business in the area. One of the most persistent issues? Long-term electrical damage.\n“Long-term electrical is always the issue because the connector gets water in them and it corrodes,” Istre said. “It causes more problems than it’s worth.”\nThe cost of those repairs can quickly climb into the thousands of dollars.\nWhile taking a detour may be inconvenient, Istre said it’s often the smarter and safer option.\n“It’s dangerous at the end of the day,” he said. “I would not recommend it. If you’re not familiar with the roads, you can fall into a ditch, and it can snowball into a lot of different things. It’s not a good idea.”",

    "text": "As you may know, the hero shooter Concord, developed by Firewalk Studios and officially launched on August 23, was not received very well by gamers, with launch numbers that were dramatically low (we are talking about less than 700 concurrent players at peak). Unfortunately, the situation has not improved over the days and the number of players on the servers has decreased even more. For example, at the time of writing this news there are 71 concurrent players on Steam, with the peak of the last 24 hours being 178. Considering that only six days have passed since the launch and that we are talking about an online game, a big problem is therefore being created for the few remaining: they cannot find games to play, with waiting times between one and the other that are getting longer and longer. Biblical waiting times Some have reported waiting times of up to 8 minutes to play, sometimes with sudden disconnections mid-game. The situation on PlayStation 5 is not good either. According to the True Trophies website, the game only reached 147th place in its ranking, which measures the popularity of games on the PlayStation Network (calculated on more than 3 million active accounts). In short, at the moment the situation is really tragic for Concord that will hardly be able to recover from these conditions. Probably in the medium term Firewalk and Sony will try the solution adopted by Square Enix with Foamstars, that is the transition to the free-to-play model, in the hope of increasing the number of players.",

    "text": "28 dezembro 2023 23:00 Com a reposição do IVA e as novas tabelas de preços, o cabaz alimentar básico vai atingir o valor mais alto de sempre 28 dezembro 2023 23:00 Daqui a uma semana, quando for ao supermercado, vai notar que a fatura será substancialmente mais cara. A partir do dia 5, o IVA será reposto em 46 produtos essenciais, o que se traduzirá num aumento direto de 6%. Só isso já seria o suficiente para que o preço do cabaz básico de alimentos saltasse para o valor mais alto de sempre. Mas ao regresso do imposto ainda vai somar-se uma atualização generalizada do preço de vários produtos. Feitas as contas, a mesma lista de compras, monitorizada pela Deco Proteste, vai custar cerca de €250, mais €20 do que esta semana. “Na maioria dos produtos, os aumentos poderão andar à volta dos 5%, o que, juntando aos 6% da reposição do IVA, vai traduzir-se num aumento superior a 10%. Mas há produtos que aumentarão mais. O azeite, por exemplo, poderá subir mais de 15%”, diz o diretor-geral da Associação Portuguesa das Empresas de Distribuição (APED), que representa as principais cadeias de súper e hipermercados. Gonçalo Lobo Xavier explica que estas lojas já receberam as novas tabelas de preços da indústria alimentar, “que refletem a subida de todos os custos de produção, impondo inevitavelmente um aumento dos preços finais”. O maior impacto junto do consumidor vai fazer-se sentir no final de janeiro, quando já tiverem sido escoados das prateleiras todos os produtos que ainda tinham os preços antigos.",
