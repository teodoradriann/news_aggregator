    "title": "How to Get Shiny Meloetta in Pokémon GO",
    "text": "Catching Shiny Pokémon in Pokémon GO is always an exciting challenge for players, and getting your hands on Shiny Meloetta adds an extra thrill since it’s a rare and Mythical Pokémon. However, Shiny Meloetta is not yet directly available to catch in Pokémon GO. Instead, players can still obtain Meloetta, and if they want to transfer it to other Pokémon games like Pokémon HOME, they will need to follow some specific steps. Here’s everything you need to know about Shiny Meloetta in Pokémon GO and how to potentially get it through other means.\nCredits – SportsIllustrated Meloetta in Pokémon GO Meloetta was first introduced in Pokémon GO during the Pokémon GO Fest 2021 event. Players who participated in the “Finding Your Voice” Special Research were able to encounter Meloetta in its Aria Forme. While this event gave players a chance to catch Meloetta, it was not available as a Shiny version. As of now, Niantic, the developer of Pokémon GO, has not released a Shiny Meloetta in the game itself.\nLike other Mythical Pokémon, Meloetta is considered to be a rare encounter, and whenever it has been available in events or research, the Shiny form has remained “Shiny-locked” – meaning it couldn’t appear as a Shiny variant.\nCurrent Methods for Getting Shiny Meloetta While catching Shiny Meloetta directly in Pokémon GO isn’t possible at the moment, there are still other ways to obtain this rare Pokémon in its Shiny form in the broader Pokémon ecosystem. The primary option is to complete specific challenges in Pokémon HOME, the cloud-based storage and transfer system for Pokémon.\nRecently, a new opportunity arose where Shiny Meloetta became obtainable as a reward for completing particular Pokédex challenges in Pokémon HOME. This includes finishing the following regional Pokédexes within the app:\nPaldea Region Pokédex (Scarlet and Violet): 400 Pokémon Kitakami Pokédex : 200 Pokémon Blueberry Academy Pokédex : 243 Pokémon Players need to transfer the required Pokémon into Pokémon HOME from their games to complete these Pokédex entries. Once all the required Pokédexes are filled, players can claim Shiny Meloetta as a Mystery Gift in the Pokémon HOME app.\nSteps to Obtain Shiny Meloetta through Pokémon HOME Transfer Pokémon: First, gather and transfer Pokémon from Scarlet and Violet or other compatible titles into Pokémon HOME. You will need to make sure you have one of each required species for all three regional Pokédexes. Complete the Pokédex Entries: Ensure you have filled out each entry for the Paldea, Kitakami, and Blueberry Academy Pokédexes within Pokémon HOME. Claim the Mystery Gift: Open Pokémon HOME, navigate to the Mystery Gift section, and claim Shiny Meloetta. Once you have Shiny Meloetta in Pokémon HOME, you can then transfer it to compatible games such as Scarlet and Violet. However, transferring it back into Pokémon GO is not yet possible since Shiny Meloetta is not allowed in the game at this point.\nShiny Hunting and Odds in Pokémon GO Although you can’t currently find Shiny Meloetta directly in Pokémon GO, players can participate in various events and strategies to hunt for other Shiny Pokémon. The base Shiny rate in Pokémon GO is approximately 1 in 512 for most wild Pokémon. Certain events, such as Community Days and Raid Days, often boost these odds significantly.\nCommunity Day Events: These feature specific Pokémon with a much higher Shiny rate of about 1 in 25. Raid Events: Legendary and Mythical Pokémon available in 5-Star Raids often have Shiny odds around 1 in 20, making them one of the best opportunities for Shiny hunters. Special Research Tasks: Some tasks during limited-time events may also provide boosted Shiny rates. Will Shiny Meloetta Ever Be Available in Pokémon GO? There is always a chance that Niantic will introduce Shiny Meloetta in the future, perhaps during a special event like a Pokémon GO Fest or a specific Mythical Pokémon-themed event. If this happens, expect the Shiny odds to be increased for event ticket holders or during a limited time frame, following a pattern similar to previous events.\nFor now, players who want to add Shiny Meloetta to their collection should focus on using Pokémon HOME as described above and keep an eye out for future announcements from Niantic regarding Mythical Pokémon events in Pokémon GO.",

    "title": "A new book talks about the rich legacy of Zoroastrian fire temples in Udwada, Gujarat",
    "text": "An evening walk through the town gives one an opportunity to stop and greet the mobeds (ordained priests) who have made Udwada their home for many generations. In their flowing white muslin jamas (robes), their heads covered in paghris (turbans), and a padan of fine mull cloth covering the nose and mouth, they serve the divine fire several times a day. They are also often requested to pray for the souls of departed family members and conduct ceremonies in gratitude for celebratory events.\nMost of the permanent residents of Udwada are members of the nine families who have been serving as boiwalas (priests who tend to the fire) at the Iranshah Atash Behram for generations. Ervad Kekobad Mogul belongs to one of these nine families and is the seventh generation of a family to make Udwada their home. Today, he is the most experienced boiwala, having spent seventy years bowing to the revered fire five times a day. “My family has been serving the Iranshah since the Maratha regime. The earliest was Ervad Bhikha Dastur Rustom,” says Ervad Mogul.\nDressed in white always, the octogenarian navigates his way to the Iranshah Atash Behram every morning on his trusted bicycle, and claims that the power of the manthravani (prayers) is immense for those who have faith. Much respected for his knowledge in conducting rituals and much loved for his good humour, he is often consulted by Zoroastrian priests and academicians. “Everyone is surprised to see me still working part-time. And I tell them, it is all by the grace of the Iranshah,” he says.\nNumerous portraits of his venerable ancestors grace his quaint house. One afternoon he and his wife, Freny Mogul, were our gracious hosts, as he recalled memories of being a full-time priest at the Atash Behram with wit, joviality and satisfaction at being part of such a distinguished legacy.\n“My life is dedicated to the service of my Atash Padshah. l became a navar (first level of priesthood) while I was in school. Before becoming a navar, our senior mobeds would test us to discover how well we knew our prayers. By the age of ten, I had learnt all the prayers of the higher liturgical ceremonies of Ijeshne, Vendidad and Visperad which are extensive. The mobeds who took my test predicted that I would be performing these ceremonies until it was time to retire, and I did!” Ervad Mogul laughed, crediting his father for the knowledge he imparted to him.\n“My father supported me immensely, and I am continuing his legacy. As a full-time priest, I would conduct the boi ceremonies of all five gahs (the day is divided into five periods or gahs), beginning from the midnight Ushahin gah. In my lifetime, I have conducted thousands of pav mahal (high inner liturgical ceremonies) prayers such as Ijeshne and Vendidad which last for hours and there is no break for drinking water or visiting the restroom.” On the days he was on duty, his resting place at home would be a cot which was kept secluded from all.\nMaintaining such a devout lifestyle is only possible with the help of family who believe in the cause. “My wife has followed every ritual and offered me support to carry on with my work,” Ervad Mogul acknowledges.\nHe is a firm believer in the divine power of the Iranshah. “Our Atash Padshah was consecrated in Sanjan, and for the first seven hundred years there, the aura of lranshah was such that only the spiritually enlightened would be able to see the full glory of the fire, while for us perhaps a small part of the fire was visible.”\nHe is witness to thousands of Zoroastrians from far and wide paying their respects at the Ätash Behram. “You must have faith. Faith moves mountains. In my seventy years as a full-time priest, I have seen many miracles.”\nTo become a “perfect” mobed, education in religious methods is required. The first step is to become a navär, then a marätab and then a samel. “Samel means being a perfect mobed. When we complete all our education, we reach out to the senior mobeds to take our exam. For this exam, forty or fifty senior mobeds as well as Dasturjis test the aspiring young priests on several prayers, and rituals,” said Elvad Mogul. Citing the example of one such ritual he said, “We have to cut our own hair as a barber cannot touch us. There is a prayer and ritual before and after taking haircuts, consuming food and daily baths.” Those who excel must undergo the seclusion of a sacred nähn (purification ceremony) for nine days and nine nights and conduct the required rituals. And then it is announced that the student is ready to conduct all ceremonies.” Not all the mobeds excel in the first round. If a candidate does not fare well, he is requested to continue studying for another six months before he can reappear for the exam.\n“Earlier, we used to have around forty students who would study to become perfect mobeds. Over the years, these young children grew up to become engineers, and doctors and joined other professions where they would excel. Many of them, after their retirement, have come back to give boi at the Iranshah. Today, we need them. Previously, there would be twelve to fourteen mobeds from each of the nine families, now there are only one or two practising priests. My brothers too know all the ceremonies and prayers although they are not practicing priests. The number of mobeds has reduced and perfect mobeds like us are even fewer,” Ervad Mogul says regretfully.\nGratitude, appreciation, and faith imbued the conversations. The opportunity to serve the Iranshan he says is a blessing. “I have served the Iranshah for seventy years, day and night. Now I am retired, but still pray at Iranshah every day. Today, I am satisfied, happy and grateful to dedicate my life to my Atash Padshah.\nExcerpted with permission from Iranshah: A Legacy Restored, Zarin Amrolia, Shapoorji Pallonji and Company Private Limited.",

    "text": "Coringão está buscando novos jogadores para seu plantel de 2024\nCorinthians vive altos e baixos nos bastidores O Corinthians vai terminar o ano de 2023 com inúmeras situações para serem definidas. Isto é, além dos problemas financeiros no pagamento dos direitos de imagem de alguns atletas, o Clube precisa pensar em reforços.\nAfinal, sem conquistar nenhum troféu desde o Paulistão de 2019, o Corinthians está vivendo um jejum incômodo e quer voltar a ser protagonista em 2024. Até por isso, o Alvinegro está movimentando o mercado.\nSó a título de exemplo, o Timão se acertou com o Santos Laguna (MEX) e se aproximou da contratação do zagueiro Félix Torres, que deve custar 5,5 milhões de dólares (cerca de R$ 26 milhões).\nAlém disso, outro nome que está mais perto de vestir a camisa do Corinthians é o meia Rodrigo Garro, do Talleres (ARG). Ele já até se acertou com o Alvinegro, mas os valores ainda estão em discussão.\nCorinthians ainda quer Rollheiser em 2024 Dito isso, por mais que conte com Matías Rojas em seu elenco e esteja muito perto de contratar Garro, o Corinthians ainda não desistiu da contratação do meia Benjamín Rollheiser, do Estudiantes (ARG).\nRodrigo Garro em ação pelo Talleres, de Córdoba. Jogador está perto de fechar com o Timão. Foto: Marcelo Endelli/Getty Images.\nO atleta de 23 anos teve sua vinda praticamente descartada há alguns dias, mas houve uma reviravolta e o atleta segue na mira. Segundo o portal Meu Timão, a diretoria sonha com um acordo nos próximos dias.\nEntretanto, vale frisar que o negócio não é considerado simples, mas a nova diretoria alvinegra (Augusto Melo e CIA) já apresentou uma oferta ao estafe do camisa 10. Vale frisar que seu valor de mercado é 10 milhões de euros (R$ 53 milhões). Por fim, a tendência é que o Timão siga agitando o mercado.\nTorcedores do Corinthians falam de Rollheiser\nLeitura recomendada:",

    "text": "MANHATTAN - The build-up to New Year&apos;s Eve is usually one of the busiest periods for Ambassador Wines and Spirits, but that&apos;s not the case right now. The store is at the corner of East 54th and 2nd Avenue, right in the middle of the cleanup of Wednesday&apos;s steam leak. \"We stand to lose a very large sum of money and after COVID and all the hits we've taken, it just keeps coming. It's difficult.\" — Shop owner Leonard Phillips 2nd Avenue and the lower 50&apos;s streets remain blocked off. Part of the perimeter was established Wednesday morning. Around 2 a.m., Con Ed officials say steam started spewing from a pipe near E 52nd and 2nd Avenue. Crews quickly cordoned off the area blocks in each direction amidst fears of asbestos contamination. Officials say air quality tests came back negative, but the cleanup is expected to take days. Inside Louie&apos;s Chicken, there were more employees than customers for the second straight day. \"Walking traffic is now zero because of what's going on with the city warning people to stay away and obviously people are.\" — Store owner Tom Citro Philips understands why the area is closed, but as a small business owner, he&apos;s just hoping it reopens soon. \"We don&apos;t know how long it&apos;s going to be. If I can get a Friday, Saturday we&apos;re ok. But if we&apos;re going to lose the weekend, it&apos;s well over $100,000 for me,\" Phillips said.",
