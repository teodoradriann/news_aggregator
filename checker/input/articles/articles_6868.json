    "title": "‘Exciting time’ to be a family lawyer in 2024 - Lawyers Weekly",
    "text": "‘Exciting time’ to be a family lawyer in 2024 Family lawyers will work in a bit of a “grey area” until significant legislative reforms come into effect in mid-2024, but when they do, it will be a “really exciting time”, one practitioner predicts. The Family Law Amendment Bill 2023 and Family Law Amendment (Information Sharing) Bill 2023 will bring about the “biggest reforms” in the space in close to two decades, [Barry Nilsson principal Genevieve Morgan said on an episode of The Lawyers Weekly Show](https://www.lawyersweekly.com.au/podcast/38606-unpacking-the-passage-of-the-family-law-amendment-bill). To continue reading the rest of this article, please log in. Create free account to get unlimited news articles and more! In the episode, Ms Morgan explained the amendments – first proposed by the Australian Law Reform Commission in an April 2019 report – will not only remove a “bad law” but will also give the court even greater discretion on how to deal with parenting arrangements. This has been a “long time coming”, Ms Morgan said. “It’s good to see some of these reports that have been sitting in the bottom drawer actually being implemented by the government, and these amendments being passed should help families navigate the system, should make it simpler, should make it more straightforward.” Ms Morgan said the amendments will not only help clients navigate the complex family law system but will also be a major advantage to lawyers. “It’s a really exciting time to be a family lawyer. “[The changes are] all really good, and it makes me proud to be a family lawyer, to be able to work in a system that people can navigate more easily than they had previously,” Ms Morgan said. While the first half of 2024 will be a bit of a “grey area” for practitioners, Ms Morgan said lawyers will need to use this period to educate themselves on the changes – including reading the legislation amendments in detail and [examining what it will mean for them](https://www.lawyersweekly.com.au/politics/38409-legislative-amendments-could-reshape-family-law-matters). “While the principles are largely the same, the act is substantially amended, so practitioners are going to have to be on top of that. “Lawyers are going to have to be across all the amendments, and specifically what the court is going to be looking at when they do deal with those cases, and make sure their evidence hits all the points the court will be looking at,” Ms Morgan explained. As part of the amendments, Ms Morgan said there will be a “massive push” – and even more so than before – for lawyers to help their clients through mediation procedures with the court. “The court should be the last resort for everybody, and that’s well accepted by family lawyers,” Ms Morgan said. “Practitioners should be using their skills to mediate where possible and empower clients to make arrangements they think are best.” Ms Morgan added family lawyers have “such an important role” in their client’s life, and they will be needed more than ever to assist in mediation, negotiations, or navigating the stress of the court system. “I feel very privileged to be able to help people through that process and be there for them through all that entails,” Ms Morgan said.

    "text": "A girl shared how she was on a date with a guy she met online, and he managed to turn every conversation explicit.“There was this guy I matched with on OK Cupid. He gave off a cheerful and happy-go-lucky vibe… until he just started being a perverted freak lmao. He found a way to turn everything explicit. Some examples are:He would say he just ate dinner and I’d ask him what he ate and he’d reply “(name of food he ate) but I rather eat you instead”I got caught up in the rain and told him I got drenched. His reply? “I like it when you’re wet too”And mind you, we never even did anything explicit together so I don’t even know what was up with that. He was in NS though so that probably explains it.He also talked about how he would always do naughty things with his ex in public places such as handicapped toilets and the cinema.He also mentioned how he was really good at f–gering girls and the explanation he gave to support that was “I f–gered my ex on a carpark rooftop and made her — 3 times”.Needless to say, we didn’t “date” for long.”Editor’s note: He most definitely lied about his girlfriend.",

    "title": "DaRon Holmes II etching name all over Dayton Flyers record book in junior season",
    "text": "DaRon Holmes II received a new tablet from his grandma but mostly clothes for Christmas back home in Goodyear, Ariz. Of course, no one can wrap what he and the Dayton Flyers truly want as a gift in the months ahead: continued winning; an Atlantic 10 Conference championship; and a NCAA tournament berth.Holmes and the Flyers returned to campus Tuesday and to practice Wednesday, hoping to pick up right where they left off Dec. 20 when they beat Oakland 91-67 . Dayton (9-2) takes a six-game winning streak into its final non-conference game at 2 p.m. Saturday against Longwood (12-2) at UD Arena. The 18-game A-10 schedule starts next week with a game Wednesday at Davidson.“We’re very excited to move forward again and get back,” Holmes said. “We’ve got some good competition coming up.”Holmes, a 6-foot-10 junior forward, could add to a growing legacy in the months ahead. Already this season, he has become the owner of two school records.Holmes is now Dayton’s all-time leader in blocked shots with 173 in 80 games. Chris Wright ranks second with 162 in 123 games. Holmes, Wright, Sean Finn (139), Roosevelt Chapman (124) and Erv Giddings (116) are the only Flyers with more than 100 blocks.Holmes broke another record in the 82-68 victory against Cincinnati on Dec. 16. He passed Obi Toppin in the career dunks category. Toppin dunked 190 times in two season. Holmes has 193 career dunks: 82 as a freshman; 89 as a sophomore and 22 this season.“It’s a great accomplishment,” Holmes said of the records. “Obviously, I’m very excited that I was able to do that. There are great guys ahead of me that previously had the records, so it’s amazing to keep that legacy going. The fact that we’re winning with it, it means a lot.”Dayton’s DaRon Holmes II broke the school record for career dunks with this dunk in the second half against Cincinnati. He now has 192 dunks in three seasons. Obi Toppin had 190 in two seasons. pic.twitter.com/A7KY2NFNiA Winning is the only thing that matters in the end. Dayton was 46-23 in Holmes’ first two seasons but fell short of A-10 championships and NCAA tournament berths in both seasons. That’s one reason Dayton coach Anthony Grant said “the picture’s still being painted” when it comes to Holmes’ legacy.“It’s one day at a time,” Grant said. “We’re going to keep our focus there and try to keep his focus there.”Meanwhile, Holmes continues to climb the UD record book. He has moved into the top 30 in career scoring . He has 1,258 points in 80 games. He passed Mike Sylvester (1,248) and Ed Young (1,253) with 10 points in Dayton’s last game. Holmes ranks 29th, just behind Marcus Johnson (1,286) and Scoochie Smith (1,289).At his current pace of 16.6 points per games, Holmes would rank 17th after 30 regular-season games. He would become the seventh player in school history to reach the 1,500-point mark in fewer than 100 games.Holmes also fares well in the record book in career field-goal percentage. He’s shooting 60.4%. Only Toppin (64.73), Finn (64.68), Josh Cunningham (63.9), Chris Daniels (63.0) and Henry Finkel (61.9) have shot better than 60%.Holmes is on pace to become the first player to lead the Flyers in scoring three straight seasons since Chris Wright (2008-11) and the first player in school history to lead the team in scoring as a freshman, sophomore and junior.Dayton’s 3-point shooting accuracy has helped Holmes this season, he said. The Flyers rank second in the country in 3-point shooting percentage (41.8). He has played a part in that by making 7 of 18 3-pointers (38.9%). UD’s success from behind the arc limits how much teams can double teams Holmes in the post.“It’s helped me my game a lot,” he said. “I’m feeding off of the guys who are excellent shooters, and sometimes I can step out and hit one. Being able to mix it up and having them do that creates open space for me in the paint.” Roster news: On Thursday, Grant said UD is probably going to redshirt freshman guard Marvel Allen, who has not appeared in a game this season. He suffered a lower-body injury in the week before the season opener and returned to practice Dec. 12.“This is not like football,” Grant said, “where you get to play a percentage of the games and you can kind of feel your way through and see what’s best for you. Once you play one second of one game in basketball, you’ve kind of blown the redshirt.”Allen would be second of three freshman on the roster to redshirt. Grant announced after the second game this season forward Jaiun Simon would redshirt . SATURDAY’S GAME Longwood at Dayton, 2 p.m., Spectrum News 1, 1290, 95.7",

    "text": "With large-scale accumulation by whales, bullish technical indicators, and shifting market sentiment, DOGE appears to be at a crucial turning point. Can it surpass key resistance levels and trigger a massive rally ?\nWhale Accumulation Signals Strong Buying Pressure One of the key drivers behind Dogecoin’s recent surge is the notable accumulation by large investors. Reports indicate that whales acquired over 220 million DOGE in March 2025, reflecting heightened confidence in the cryptocurrency’s future trajectory . As a result, DOGE experienced a 7.3% price increase in the last 24 hours, trading at around $0.174.\nWhales accumulated over 220 million DOGE in March. Source: Ali Martinez via X\nThe increase in whale activity suggests that institutional and high-net-worth investors are positioning themselves for a bullish move. If this trend continues, Dogecoin could see further upside as demand outpaces supply.\nTechnical Analysis Points to a Bullish Breakout Market enthusiasts are keenly aware of Dogecoin price charts for indications of an expected rally. The recent breakout from a falling wedge pattern—a classically bullish technical pattern —has fueled speculation about significant upward action.\nDOGE is forming higher lows, historically signaling a price surge to new highs. Source: Javon Marks via X\nCrypto analyst Javon Marks noted that DOGE is building a pattern of higher lows, which is usually the harbinger of strong rallies. Based on this trend, he predicted a possible 270% price increase, which would make the price of Dogecoin reach around $0.6533.\nWith a target of $0.6533, DOGE could be gearing up for a 270% rally to break above this level. Source: Javon Marks via X\nAlso, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) crossed into positive terrain, showing renewed buying strength. If Bitcoin persists in staying above, DOGE can look up to the $0.22–$0.25 region in the upcoming weeks.\nKey Resistance Levels to Watch Despite the bullish outlook, Dogecoin faces crucial resistance at $0.18 and $0.21. Analyst Ali Martinez has identified these levels as major barriers, where a significant portion of DOGE supply was last transacted. Breaking through these areas of resistance can serve as a catalyst for the next phase of the bull run.\nDOGE is either in a consolidation phase, awaiting a breakout after wave Z, or poised for a bullish or bearish impulse wave. Source: Mochoa777 on TradingView\nMartinez also said, “Breaking these resistance levels could unleash a strong upward movement for Dogecoin, as there are no major supply barriers ahead.” If DOGE breaks above $0.21, it could pave the way for a rush toward $0.36 and beyond .\nMarket Sentiment: Are Investors Bullish on DOGE? The sentiment in the markets also appears to shift in Dogecoin’s favor as investors and traders show renewed interest . Dogecoin derivatives market has also demonstrated significant growth as options volume witnessed a rise of 84.21% while Open Interest saw a rise of 8% to $804,000. Additionally, the volume traded rose by 22%, indicating higher trading activity.\nDogecoin (DOGE) was trading at around $0.17, up 4.12% in the last 24 hours at press time. Source: Source: Brave New Coin\nThe Long/Short Ratio indicates long positions now predominate at 71.47% of the futures contracts. That indicates there is growing confidence on the part of traders that DOGE will experience further up-side.\nTechnical indicators such as the Stochastic RSI also point to Dogecoin being near a tipping point. If a bullish flip occurs, it could validate the recent uptrend and further strengthen DOGE’s position.\nCan Dogecoin Reclaim Its All-Time High? Dogecoin’s price has been on a recovery path since its all-time high of $0.74 in 2021. While it has faced several corrections, recent developments suggest a potential return to previous highs. Analysts argue that breaking above $0.36 could set the stage for DOGE to reclaim its former glory.\nDogecoin (DOGEUSD) broke above the two-month lower highs trendline, signaling the start of a new bullish leg, with the potential to reach a new all-time high of $0.800. Source: TradingShot on TradingView\nCrypto strategist Balo emphasized that “DOGE appears to have bottomed out and could be gearing up for a 2x move before reaching major resistance at $0.36. Once we reclaim that level, discussions about new all-time highs will be back on the table.”\nLooking Forward: Is a 270% Surge on the Horizon? Dogecoin’s recent bullish signals indicate that a major price movement may be imminent. Whale accumulation, technical breakouts, and improving market confidence all point to the possibility of a large rally. However, DOGE must overcome significant resistance levels at $0.18 and $0.21 before a sustained bull run can be confirmed.\nIf momentum continues and DOGE overcomes these obstacles, a 270% surge is possible. Investors will need to watch trends in the market and breakouts at resistance closely, as the next few weeks could be pivotal for the long-term direction of Dogecoin.",

    "text": "New Delhi, Oct 3: The Baansera Park on the banks of Yamuna river will soon harvest its first crop of ‘Lakadong turmeric’, a rare variety brought in from Meghalaya and it available to people of the national capital, according to official sources here today.\nLakadong turmeric is a rare and prized variety of turmeric that is native to the Jaintia Hills region of Meghalaya. It is known for its high curcumin content, which gives it a bright yellow colour and a distinct aroma and earthy flavour.\nAn official said that on the direction of Lieutenant Governor VK Saxena, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) had implemented a pilot project for planting turmeric on the banks of Yumuna at Baansera four months back, which exhibited an 80% success rate. Now, a decision has been taken to replicate the plantation at its other green spaces too.\nThe trial cultivation of Lakadong turmeric was in line with DDA’s persistent innovative approach aimed at adding diversity to its flora. Earlier, there were plantations of chandan, chinar, cherry blossom, water apple, green apple and grapes with success, the sources said.\nThe DDA had planted the turmeric under the thick bamboo groves over two acres of land at Baansera, a sustainability-themed bamboo park, that has shown good growth. The DDA procured the turmeric seeds from Meghalaya and cultivated it at Baansera under the bamboo groves that are considered conducive for the survival and growth of this turmeric.\nConsidered to be one of the best varieties of turmeric worldwide, it is highly valued and most sought-after in the medicinal and wellness sectors. Additionally, its volatile oil content, ranging from 3.6 per cent to 4.8 per cent, increases its appeal across various industries, they said.\nLakadong a tiny, nondescript village at the foothills of West Jaintia Hills district in Meghalaya, where the world’s finest variety of turmeric grows. It is most favoured for its high curcumin content of more than 7%, as against 2 to 3% found in regular varieties available in the market.\nOnly recently, the Meghalaya Collectives, an initiative of the Meghalaya government, showcased 20 exclusive brands and value added products made from renowned Lakadong Turmeric, Khasi Mandarin, Kew Pineapple, local ginger, cashew nuts, and many other indigenous produce, during the ‘World Food India 2024’ event held in the national capital.\nDuring the event, farmer-producer organisations, rural entrepreneurship, and sustainable agriculture practices were also promoted.\nThis approach was aimed to enhance farmers’ income, improve agricultural productivity, and promote Meghalaya’s organic products.",
