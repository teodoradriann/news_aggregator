    "title": "Le chanvre, plante du futur ? Elle est économe en eau et produit suffisamment sans avoir recours aux pesticides",
    "text": "Depuis quelques années, Grand Poitiers a décidé de mettre en place une filière de culture du chanvre. Cette plante permet de préserver la ressource en eau et offre de nombreux débouchés dans le secteur du bâtiment ou celui de l'alimentation. C’est une plante économe en eau, qui ne nécessite pas de traitements chimiques et qu’on peut transformer de multiples manières. Le chanvre possède beaucoup d’atouts et il est cultivé actuellement par une dizaine d’agriculteurs autour de Poitiers. Le chanvre, une plante économe en eau Depuis 2021, la communauté d’agglomération de Grand Poitiers a décidé de développer cette filière pour préserver la ressource en eau. Frédy Poirier est vice-président de Grand Poitiers en charge de l'agriculture et de l'alimentation : « En matière de production d’eau potable, on doit arriver à mettre en œuvre sur notre territoire des cultures qui sont moins exigeantes en matière de pesticides et le chanvre a cet avantage-là. Il peut produire suffisamment avec un équilibre économique sans avoir recours aux pesticides. » On a des murs qui respirent et qui permettent de gérer la chaleur, l’humidité ou le froid. AlexiaHabitante de Blanzay (86) Le chanvre ne manque pas de débouchés, à commencer par le secteur du bâtiment. La plante, une fois transformée, est utilisée comme isolant et séduit certains particuliers, comme Alexia de Blanzay, dans la Vienne : « On a des murs qui respirent et qui permettent de gérer la chaleur, gérer l’humidité, gérer le froid et en plus, ça crée quelque chose de très chaud, de très agréable à vivre à l’intérieur. On est dans quelque chose de doux, de très confortable, on est comme dans un nid. » À LIRE AUSSI : [Bois, chanvre, résine : ces nouveaux bâtiments qui s'adaptent aux changements climatiques](/nouvelle-aquitaine/haute-vienne/limoges/en-images-bois-chanvre-resine-ces-nouveaux-batiments-qui-s-adaptent-aux-changements-climatiques-2950136.html) Moi, j'aime bien travailler le chanvre en pâtisserie, mais il y a aussi l’huile qu’on peut utiliser en vinaigrette, la farine pour faire du pain. Stéphane BoucardCuisinier de l'école Charles Perrault de Poitiers Un autre débouché du chanvre qui peut être plus inattendu se trouve dans l’alimentation. Ce matin-là, à l’école Charles-Perrault de Poitiers, le cuisinier Stéphane Boucard prépare un broyé du Poitou à base de farine de chanvre pour le dessert des enfants. « Ça a des vertus. D’abord, ça apporte des oméga 3 et pour les enfants, ce sont des protéines. Moi, j'aime bien travailler le chanvre en pâtisserie, mais il y a aussi l’huile qu’on peut utiliser en vinaigrette, la farine pour faire du pain. » Avec ses multiples utilisations possibles, le chanvre serait-il la plante du futur ? Sans doute pas encore, selon Jean-Frédéric Granger. Il est agriculteur à Celle-Lévescault, dans la Vienne : « Ça reste un marché de niche aujourd’hui. Il faut être en phase avec le marché, ça veut dire qu’il faut qu’on développe notre production au fur et à mesure que la demande se développe. Et la demande est là, elle va arriver. » Actuellement, la culture du chanvre couvre 37 hectares sur le territoire de Grand Poitiers. À terme, l’agglomération vise les 200 hectares d'exploitation de cette plante.",

    "text": "( MENAFN ) In a remarkable display of resilience and investor confidence, the Egyptian Stock Exchange showcased a stellar performance throughout 2023, marking its most impressive annual surge since 2016. The benchmark Egyptian index surged by 0.8 percent, culminating in an astounding 70.5 percent uptick over the year, a feat unparalleled since 2016. This remarkable trajectory was significantly bolstered by notable gains in key sectors, particularly the banking and tobacco industries.\nNotably, shares of the Commercial International Bank, Egypt's premier lending institution, escalated by an impressive 75 percent throughout the year. Concurrently, Eastern Tobacco Company witnessed an even more substantial appreciation, with its shares soaring by an astonishing 98.5 percent.\nThis robust upswing in stock valuations unfolds against a backdrop of formidable economic headwinds confronting Egypt. The nation grappled with burgeoning inflationary pressures, with the inflation rate surging to alarming heights, eclipsing 38 percent by September. Furthermore, the local currency experienced pronounced volatility, depreciating significantly to approximately 50 Egyptian pounds against the U.S. dollar in the informal market. Amidst this challenging economic milieu, the Egyptian Stock Exchange's formidable performance assumes heightened significance.\nBeyond serving as a barometer of investor sentiment, this buoyant market performance plays a pivotal role in bolstering confidence in Egypt's financial landscape. By showcasing resilience and offering attractive investment avenues, the stock exchange fortifies its position as a beacon of stability, fostering an environment conducive to investor participation and capital mobilization.\nMENAFN02012024000045015682ID1107676386\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the information “as is” without warranty of any kind.

    "text": "Joel Bitonio relishes Browns playoff berth after years 'where there was no hope' [Chris Easterling](https://www.beaconjournal.com/staff/5854570002/chris-easterling/) CLEVELAND — [Joel Bitonio](/story/sports/pro/browns/2022/09/04/cleveland-browns-joel-bitonio-perspective-all-pro-talent-nfl/65467608007/) looked and sounded like a man doomed to a certain fate. It was Christmas Eve, 2022. The Browns had just seen their playoff hopes officially go into the deep freeze with a [home loss to the New Orleans Saints](/story/sports/pro/browns/2022/12/24/cleveland-browns-eliminated-playoffs-17-10-loss-new-orleans-saints-nfl-week-16-deshaun-watson/69738294007/), and the All-Pro left guard was wearing his emotions on his face in a way he rarely does. “Yeah, we have had too many games that we have not been able to close out this year — Jets, Falcons, Chargers and this game — four or five games,\" Bitonio [said that frigid day last December](/story/sports/pro/browns/2022/12/25/browns-vs-saints-takeaways-cleveland-ends-home-schedule-with-loss/69738304007/). \"It is the NFL. Games are close. Good teams find a way to win those close ones and find a way to close the door, and we have not done that enough this year, which you see in our record.” A year and a couple of days made a world of difference, for both the Browns and their longest-tenured player. Thursday night, Bitonio was a man who was realizing a different fate. The Browns (11-5) clinched just their third playoff berth since they returned to the NFL in 1999 with a [37-20 win over the New York Jets](/story/sports/pro/browns/2023/12/28/browns-vs-jets-instant-analysis-live-game-score-updates-thursday-night-football-nfl-week-17-playoffs/72037806007/). For Bitonio, the excitement of the moment was also colored by the scars of so many disappointments since coming into the league with the Browns in 2014. \"No, for me it's almost like a whole career goes,\" Bitonio said after Thursday's playoff-clincher. \"You remember the 0-16, 1-15, 3-13 years where there was no hope at the time. When you look back on it, it's like, hey, we're turning this team into a winning culture and we're expected to compete and go to the playoffs every year, and it is cool to be a part of that.\" It's not the first time Bitonio has been a part of a Browns playoff team. However, there's nothing about this journey to the postseason and the previous one he went through in 2020 that are quite the same. For one thing, that playoff berth was secured by essentially beating the Pittsburgh Steelers backups in front of roughly 12,000 fans in Cleveland due to COVID restrictions. Beyond that, once the Browns got in, Bitonio wasn't able to even play in the AFC Wild Card Game against the Steelers because of a positive COVID test. Bitonio was able to return in time for the Browns' AFC Divisional Round game at the Kansas City Chiefs. However, that's where the journey also came to an end. \"Oh, yeah, it was disappointing,\" Bitonio said of the 2020 experience. \"Obviously the guys stepped up there and I got to play in the playoffs after that. We didn't win that one in Kansas City, but you want a chance at it every year, but it was definitely disappointing. A little bittersweet last time, so hopefully we can just keep this one sweet.\" The Browns still have one more game to play before the playoffs officially begin, next weekend at the Cincinnati Bengals. Depending on what happens in Sunday's Miami Dolphins at Baltimore Ravens game, they could be playing for a chance at an AFC North title or they could essentially have a chance to treat the Bengals game like a preseason game. If it's the latter scenario, there's always a chance Bitonio, who's fought a back issue the last three weeks, could get that rare regular-season gameday off. The trade-off in that specific case would be a chance to be a little bit fresher for wherever the Browns' postseason journey begins, be it Jacksonville, Indianapolis or Houston. Bitonio isn't thinking that far ahead. He, like the rest of the Browns players, have bought into the mantra of \"1-0 each week\" that coach Kevin Stefanski has preached all season long. It's allowed the Browns to overcome an injury list that should've crippled them months ago. Instead, they've overcome those to get back into the playoffs. Bitonio, if any of his younger teammates need some perspective, can tell them these kind of moments are the furthest things from guarantees. It's why he's stressing striking while the iron is hot. \"I think the guys are focused on the task at hand,\" Bitonio said. \"We're taking it one week at a time. But we only have so many opportunities as this team. You only have one opportunity with this team because NFL is such a turnover league where guys are going to be gone no matter what. So we only have one opportunity with this team, and we're going to try and make the most out of it.\" Chris Easterling can be reached at ceasterling@thebeaconjournal.com.

Por: Alexandra Amao Ante la ola cálida presente en Nuevo León y en diversas partes del país, especialistas de la [Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León](http://uanl.mx) advirtieron sobre las consecuencias en la salud que puede desencadenar este fenómeno ya que un golpe de calor puede causar daños severos en el ser humano. David de Jesús Luna Salinas, coordinador de Servicios Médicos de la UANL, mencionó que la exposición prolongada a la radiación solar puede causar deshidratación de forma inmediata y con ello efectos graves en su salud. Las personas empiezan a tener una elevación de la temperatura corporal mayor a 40 grados. Pueden sentir una sudoración intensa y presentar fatiga, dolores de cabeza, mareos, náuseas y boca seca que, al ir progresando, van desgastando el estado general del cuerpo al punto de presentar un deterioro neurológico en el que pueden convulsionar y llegar incluso a un estado de coma”. De presentarse algún síntoma anormal, el médico refirió que es necesario regular la temperatura corporal con ayuda de fomentos frescos y el consumo de agua simple y no de bebidas azucaradas que pueden ocasionar más sed de lo habitual. Hay que colocar a la persona en un lugar ventilado y a la sombra para que su temperatura corporal vaya disminuyendo. Atomizar el cuerpo con agua fresca o utilizar compresas en el cuello, la frente y las axilas y reposar luego de darse un baño para lograr una mejoría”. Y agregó que, en caso de no mostrar alivio, es necesario acudir al médico cuanto antes para evitar que el golpe de calor pueda ocasionar escenarios fatales. Clave el ajustar horarios Además de las alteraciones internas en el cuerpo, la piel puede presentar daños severos debido a la falta de humectación. Las complicaciones cutáneas van desde quemaduras hasta la aparición de manchas, por lo que es necesario ajustar un horario para determinadas actividades. Se recomienda utilizar un protector solar con un factor arriba de 50 y aplicarlo cada dos horas de forma uniforme en el rostro, cuello, brazos y piernas. En casos extremos, la exposición prolongada al sol durante varias jornadas puede causar lesiones o cáncer de piel”. En cuanto al manejo de los alimentos y su correcto almacenamiento, destacó que es importante tener cuidado especial con las carnes, ya que suelen descomponerse con mayor facilidad. “El pollo, carne de res o mariscos deben estar refrigerados de forma adecuada, y al retirarlos, obtener solo las porciones que se vayan a consumir. Estas deben estar cien por ciento cocinadas, ya que suelen desprender bacterias de forma rápida debido al intenso calor y, si las ingerimos, corremos el riesgo de sufrir una intoxicación alimentaria que trae consigo vómitos o diarreas”, informó el coordinador de Servicios Médicos de la UANL. Recomendaciones para evitar el golpe de calor - Beber agua simple de forma constante. - Utilizar ropa de telas frescas y colores claros. - Usar protector solar con factor 50+. - Mantenerse en la sombra. - Evitar realizar actividades deportivas entre 12:00 y 15:00 horas.",
