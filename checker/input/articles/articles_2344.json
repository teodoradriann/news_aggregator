    "text": "In a policy shift, Air India has extended the service tenure for pilots and non-flying staff.Know more\nNew Delhi: Air India will increase the retirement age for its pilots to 65 and for non-flying staff to 60, up from the current limit of 58 for both groups, according to sources on Friday.\nThe change was announced during a meeting led by CEO and MD Campbell Wilson, the sources said. The move aligns Air India’s superannuation age with that of Vistara, the former Tata Group–Singapore Airlines joint venture.\nAir India employs about 24,000 people, including roughly 3,600 pilots and nearly 9,500 cabin crew. It remains unclear whether the retirement age for cabin crew, currently 58, will also be increased.\nWhile the formal retirement age for Air India pilots has been 58, many have had their service extended until 65, the maximum allowed by India’s aviation regulator, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA).\nThe merger with Vistara prompted discontent among some Air India pilots over differing retirement ages between the two airlines.\nThere was no immediate official comment from the Tata Group–owned carrier.\nPTI sources\nSubscribe to our Newsletter\nGet Latest Mathrubhumi Updates in English\nFollow\nDisclaimer: Kindly avoid objectionable, derogatory, unlawful and lewd comments, while responding to reports.

    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Alexander County, North Carolina from 1901-2000 was 39.5. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Alexander County, North Carolina experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Alexander County, North Carolina history.",

    "text": "VANCOUVER, Wash. — The manager of American Legion Post 176 in Vancouver is facing multiple charges including theft for allegedly stealing $153,590 from the post. In a text message, Rene Cavenaile admitted to her colleagues that she had been stealing from the post, court documents say. The alleged theft happened between April 2022 and December 2023. Cavenaile worked at the post for more than two years, according to the Washington State Gambling Commission (WSGC) , which licenses the post's gambling activities. WSGC agents conducted a routine compliance investigation at the post on Dec. 5, 2023. They requested to review check registers and bank statements for the post's gambling account. Cavenaile \"appeared nervous and frustrated\" when asked for the records, according to a probable cause document filed earlier this month. She told agents that she would have to look for some of the requested documents and would provide them later. Cavenaile told investigators that she was leaving to care for her sick husband before the inspection could be completed. According to the probable cause document, Cavenaile then sent a group text message to several members of the post, telling them that she had been stealing money from a gambling account and transferring it to her personal account. Her text said, in part, \"I have a serious gambling problem that led me to do the unthinkable, by taking from the mouth that feeds me. I tried to stop but the urge was too strong for me. The gambling commission will find out the truth today.\" On January 2, 2024, a WSGC agent obtained a search warrant for Cavenaile's bank accounts. The agent determined that Cavenaile wrongfully obtained money from nine different American Legion Post 176 accounts and made 136 unauthorized mobile banking transfer withdrawals to her personal banking accounts, the probably cause document says. Cavenaile has been charged with theft in the first degree, theft in the second degree-access device, theft in the second degree, forgery and violations relating to fraud, deceit, altering or misrepresenting, betting or gambling.",

    "text": "Following record-breaking warm temperatures and extreme winds to close out October, Milwaukee is in for another week of wild weather. Near-constant rain, with periods of heavy rainfall and possible thunderstorms, is in the forecast from Saturday night through the end of the day Tuesday, said Milwaukee-Sullivan National Weather Service meteorologist Kevin Wagner. Things should be cool and dry for remaining Halloween festivities on Friday and Saturday before a system moving across the Plains into the Upper Great Lakes region brings the rain and warmer temperatures, Wagner said. Friday and Saturday are expected to be mostly sunny in Milwaukee, with afternoon highs of 48 and 55 degrees, respectively. Highs will be in the upper 50s to mid-60s Sunday through Tuesday. Precipitation chances in Milwaukee climb throughout Saturday night to over 50% by 1 a.m. Sunday. Chances of rain continue to rise throughout the morning to between 90% and 100% from 1 p.m. Sunday to noon Tuesday. Periods of heavy rainfall should be expected, with daily totals in some areas between 1 and 1.5 inches, Wagner said. According to the NWS forecast, there is a possibility of thunderstorms from late Sunday night to noon Tuesday. Chances are highest between 7 p.m. on Monday and midnight on Tuesday. Rain remains likely through midnight Wednesday before a cold front moves in, calming the system and bringing cooler temperatures. Wednesday is expected to be sunny with a high of around 55 degrees.",

    "text": "Baterías de la ciberguerra\nLa explosión de diferentes aparatos de comunicación acaecida hace dos semanas en El Líbano exhibe una nueva faceta de la guerra híbrida donde todas las esferas de lo cotidiano, sobre todo las vinculadas con el ciberespacio, se pueden reconvertir en aparatología bélica. Los tres mil buscapersonas (pagers o beepers) y la centena de walkie talkies que estallaron el martes y miércoles pasados fueron modificados para introducirles explosivos plásticos, pero su detonación simultánea apeló a un software remoto capaz de recalentar la batería para su posterior deflagración. Esta última posibilidad es la que nos interpela sobre los estándares de seguridad de los celulares y demás dispositivos informáticos, en relación con su posible voladura a distancia, incluso sin encontrarse acompañados por explosivos.\nLa conectividad global supone crecientes desafíos a las soberanías naciones. Dichos retos incluyen el seguimiento y monitoreo de actores políticos, militares o comunicacionales, la planificación de operaciones de espionaje sobre poblaciones enteras y la implantación de campañas propagandísticas destinadas a influir, condicionar y determinar formatos cognitivos y conductas sociales. En una primera etapa, el Mossad detectó el pedido que la empresa taiwanesa decidió otorgar a su licenciataria, la firma húngara BAC Consulting KFT, radicada en Budapest. El territorio chino de Taiwán, parte indisoluble de la soberanía de la República Popular, se comporta como socio estratégico de los EEUU, mientras que Viktor Orbán es uno de los pocos líderes europeos que defiende de forma consecuente a Bibi Netanyahu.\nEn ambos polos de la cadena productiva de los buscapersonas, aparecen confidentes de los servicios secretos del régimen israelí. El vocero del gobierno húngaro, Zoltan Kovacs, informó el jueves que los aparatos no habían sido producidos en su país y que BAC Consulting era solo \"un revendedor”: los aparatos de comunicación reconvertidos en explosivos personales fueron fabricados en Israel, derivados a Budapest y luego embarcados a Beirut. El material plástico de alrededor de cincuenta gramos fue implantado junto a la batería y se lo asoció a un interruptor que se activó en forma remota.\nEl Mossad y la Unidad 8200 de las Fuerzas de Defensa de Israel son dos de los responsables del entramado C4ISR, sigla que refiere a las actividades de comando, control, comunicaciones, inteligencia, vigilancia y reconocimiento ligadas al ciberespacio. Los insumos provistos por ambas organizaciones fueron centrales en la detección de la solicitud presentada en octubre pasado, por parte de las autoridades libanesas de Hizbolá, a la empresa taiwanesa Gold Apollo, radicada en Taipéi.\nLas plataformas a través de la cuales se llevan a cabo los procesos de vigilancia global son las mismas que se utilizan para monetizar las elecciones y aficiones individuales. Las redes sociales con las que nos comunicamos se inscriben en servidores que no controlamos y son requeridos –llegado el caso– para sugerirnos contenidos o ubicarnos como destinatarios de determinadas visiones del mundo. Todos estos datos, ajenos a nuestro control, son insumos de esta guerra globalizada que lucha por la apropiación de las ciencias y la geolocalización de disidencias.\nPara hacer más eficiente y exitosa esa confrontación bélica, se apela a la Inteligencia Artificial (IA) –que de “inteligencia” no tiene nada– para procesar de forma más veloz los datos recolectados, ofreciendo de esta manera respuestas más veloces y funcionales. Esta operación gigantesca se lleva a cabo gracias a una sistemática sustracción de la propiedad intelectual individual y pormenorizada de miles de millones de internautas, usuarios de computadoras y/o celulares.\nGlenn Gerstell, actual referente de los estudios de ciberdefensa del Centro de Estudios Estratégicos e Internacionales (CSIS) y ex consejero de la Agencia de Seguridad Nacional durante el gobierno de Donald Trump, consideró en la última semana que “nuestra sensación de vulnerabilidad sobre cómo los aparatos conectados a internet pueden convertirse en armas mortales puede estar iniciándose”. Su apreciación no deja en claro si se trata de una premonición o es directamente un anuncio de futuras tecnologías disponibles para la ejecución remota de oponentes.\nLa tecnología que usamos está cada vez más intervenida por formatos de espionaje y de operaciones encubiertas. Dado que la desconexión aparece como infructuosa e improductiva, los gobiernos deben plantearse medidas en relación con el control soberano de las infraestructuras digitales y las regulaciones institucionales de los contenidos. Eso es lo que están llevando a cabo Brasil (respecto a Elon Musk), EEUU (respecto a TiK Tok y Huawei) y la Unión Europea (en torno a Meta y Google). Para ellos –igual que para Rusia o China– la soberanía es una categoría relevante. Solo los portadores de mentes coloniales desechan sus atributos.",

    "text": "Un procès accusant Elon Musk d'avoir truqué le dogecoin prend fin. Les investisseurs de la crypto-monnaie qui ont déclaré que la personne la plus riche du monde et son entreprise de voitures électriques Tesla ont commis des fraudes et des délits d'initiés ont retiré leur appel du rejet de leur affaire le 29 août.\nIls retirent également leur demande de sanction à l'encontre des avocats de M. Musk pour avoir prétendument interféré avec l'appel, notamment en exigeant le paiement de leurs importants frais de justice.\nMusk et Tesla, quant à eux, ont retiré leur requête visant à sanctionner l'avocat des investisseurs pour avoir prétendument poursuivi une affaire \"frivole\" avec des théories juridiques en constante évolution afin \"d'extorquer une aide rapide\".\nUne stipulation rejetant l'appel et les requêtes des deux parties a été déposée jeudi soir au tribunal fédéral de Manhattan. Elle doit être approuvée par le juge de district Alvin Hellerstein.\nLes avocats des investisseurs et de M. Musk n'ont pas répondu immédiatement vendredi aux demandes de commentaires.\nLes investisseurs accusent M. Musk d'avoir utilisé des messages sur Twitter, une apparition dans l'émission \"Saturday Night Live\" de la chaîne NBC et d'autres coups d'éclat pour négocier des dogecoins à leurs dépens, notamment en calant les transactions sur les déclarations publiques et les activités de M. Musk.\nDans sa décision de rejet du 29 août, M. Hellerstein a déclaré que des investisseurs raisonnables ne pouvaient pas prouver qu'ils avaient commis une fraude en se fiant aux tweets de M. Musk, qui affirmait notamment que le dogecoin était la future monnaie de la Terre et que sa société SpaceX pourrait l'envoyer sur la lune.\nLe juge a également déclaré qu'il ne comprenait pas les allégations de manipulation du marché et de délit d'initié formulées par les investisseurs.\nLes investisseurs réclamaient à l'origine 258 milliards de dollars et ont modifié leur plainte quatre fois en deux ans.\nMusk a racheté Twitter en 2022 et l'a rebaptisé X.\nMardi, le président élu Donald Trump a choisi Musk et le fondateur d'une société de biotechnologie, Vivek Ramaswany, pour diriger le nouveau ministère de l'efficacité gouvernementale, dont l'acronyme fait écho au nom du dogecoin.\nL'affaire est Gorog et al v. Musk et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 22-05037.",

    "title": "If you don’t want life to be so hard, say goodbye to these 13 behaviors",
    "text": "Stop doing these things for an easier life.\nLife is hard. There’s no getting away from that fact.\nBut there are many ways you might be making it harder for yourself, without even realizing it.\nIf you do any of the following, it’s time for a change. It’s time to make life easier by turning these things on their heads and doing the complete opposite.\n1. Stop being afraid to ask for help.\nMany people struggle with asking for help. Whether it’s due to pride, fear of rejection or embarrassment, or a belief that they should be able to handle everything on their own, refusing to ask for help can make life much harder than it has to be.\nWhen you don’t ask for help, you may end up spending more time and energy trying to solve a problem than is necessary. This can lead to frustration and burnout, and sometimes even make the problem worse.\nRefusing to ask for help can also lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness. You may start to believe that no one else understands or cares about your struggles.\nRemember, asking for help is not a sign of weakness. It takes courage and strength to admit that you need assistance, and seeking help can often lead to better outcomes and a more fulfilling life.\n2. Stop thinking you can find happiness outside of you.\nMany people believe that happiness comes from external fac\ntors such as money, relationships, and material possessions. However, these things only provide temporary happiness and do not lead to long-term fulfillment.\nWhen we rely on external factors for our happiness, we give away our power and control over our lives. We become dependent on things and people outside of ourselves, which can lead to disappointment and frustration when those things do not meet our expectations.\nTo find true happiness, we must look within ourselves. Only here can we discover the never-ending source of peace and contentment that we’re looking for.\n3. Stop saying yes when you want to say no.\nDo you find yourself constantly saying yes to things you don’t want to do? Maybe it’s because you don’t want to disappoint someone or you feel like you have to say yes to be polite. Whatever the reason, saying yes when you want to say no can make your life harder than it has to be.\nSaying yes creates responsibility, and meeting that responsibility eats up your time, energy, and other precious resources.\nIt’s okay to say no. You don’t have to do everything that’s asked of you. Saying no doesn’t make you a bad person. It’s important to prioritize your own needs and boundaries.\n4. Stop taking everything personally.\nDo you often feel like people are out to get you? Do you take every little thing that happens in your life as a personal attack? If so, you may be making life harder than it has to be.\nTaking everything personally can lead to unnecessary stress and anxiety, and it can strain your relationships with others. It’s easy to fall into the trap of thinking that everything that happens is about you. But the truth is, most people are focused on their own lives and problems, and they’re not thinking about you at all.\nWhen you take everything personally, you’re essentially giving other people the power to control your emotions. You’re allowing their words and actions to dictate how you feel, which can be exhausting and disempowering.\nTaking everything personally can lead to a narrow, self-centered view of the world. You may be missing out on opportunities for growth and learning because you’re too focused on your own feelings.\n5. Stop having unrealistic expectations of others.\nWhether it’s your family, friends, or coworkers, expecting too much from them can lead to disappointment and frustration.\nFor example, you might expect your partner to always know what you’re thinking or want without having to communicate it clearly. Or you might expect your coworkers to always meet your high standards without giving them the necessary resources or support.\nIt’s important to remember that everyone has their own limitations and strengths. It’s unfair to expect others to meet your expectations without taking into account their own abilities and circumstances.\nBy having more realistic expectations of others, you can avoid unnecessary stress and conflict in your relationships.\n6. Stop waiting for the next bad thing to happen.\nDo you always expect the worst to happen? Do you find yourself constantly worrying about what could go wrong? This kind of negative thinking is exhausting.\nWhen you’re always waiting for the next bad thing to happen, you’re not living in the present moment. Instead, you’re stuck in a cycle of fear and anxiety about the future. This can lead to a lack of motivation and a feeling of helplessness.\nThe truth is, bad things do happen and you can’t always avoid them. But there’s no point spending your life constantly on alert for the next catastrophe.\n7. Stop trying to be the person others want you to be.\nOne of the biggest mistakes you can make in life is trying to be the person others want you to be.\nIt’s natural to want to fit in and be accepted, but when you prioritize other people’s expectations over your own needs and desires, you’re setting yourself up for a lot of unnecessary stress and frustration.\nWhen you try to be the person others want you to be, you’re essentially living your life for them instead of yourself. You’re constantly seeking validation and approval from others, and you’re never truly happy because you’re not living in alignment with your own values and beliefs.\nIt’s important to remember that you’re the only person who knows what’s best for you. You have your own unique talents, passions, and interests, and you should never feel like you have to hide or suppress them to fit in with others.\n8. Stop participating in other people’s drama.\nIt’s easy to get caught up in other people’s drama. Whether it’s a co-worker’s gossip, a friend’s relationship issues, or a family member’s financial problems, it can be tempting to get involved and offer your opinion or help.\nHowever, participating in other people’s drama can make your life harder than it has to be.\nWhen you get involved in other people’s drama, you’re taking on their problems as your own. You’re investing your time, energy, and emotions into something that doesn’t directly affect you. This can be draining and stressful, and it can take away from your own happiness and well-being.\nWhat’s more, getting involved in other people’s drama can cause conflict and tension in your own relationships. If you’re constantly talking about other people’s problems or taking sides in conflicts, it can create negativity and drama in your own life.\n9. Stop worrying that you’ll lose everything.\nDo you often worry about losing your job, your relationship, your health, or your possessions? This kind of thinking can be paralyzing and prevent you from enjoying the present moment.\nWhile it’s natural to have some concerns about the future, excessive worrying can lead to anxiety, stress, and even depression.\nDo you focus on the worst-case scenarios and ignore the positive possibilities? Do you assume that you can’t handle adversity or that you won’t be able to cope with change? Do you believe that your worth is determined by external factors, such as your job title, your income, or your social status?\nIf you recognize yourself in any of these thought patterns, try to shift your mindset and adopt a more optimistic and realistic view of the world. Instead of worrying about what could go wrong, focus on what you can do to improve your situation and build resilience.\nRemember, worrying won’t change the outcome, but it can rob you of your peace of mind and prevent you from living your life to the fullest.\n10. Stop cutting corners.\nDo you often find yourself taking shortcuts to get things done quickly? While this may seem like a good idea at the time, it can actually make your life harder in the long run.\nRushing through tasks without paying attention to detail can lead to mistakes that need to be fixed later on. Skipping steps in a process can cause you to miss important information or overlook critical details. Ignoring warning signs or red flags can lead to bigger problems down the road. Choosing the easy way out instead of doing what is right can damage your reputation and relationships.\nBy cutting corners, you may be sacrificing quality for speed or convenience. This can ultimately lead to more stress, frustration, and even failure.\n11. Stop lying to yourself.\nOne of the most common ways we make our lives harder than they have to be is by lying to ourselves. We tell ourselves things that aren’t true, and we believe them. These lies can be about anything from our abilities to our relationships to our goals.\nOne common lie we tell ourselves is that we’re not good enough. We think we’re not smart enough or talented enough or attractive enough to achieve our goals, so we don’t even try. We convince ourselves that we’re not capable of success, and we give up before we even start.\nAnother lie we tell ourselves is that we don’t have enough time. We say we’re too busy to exercise or learn a new skill or spend time with our loved ones. But the truth is, we all have the same 24 hours in a day. It’s up to us to decide how we use them.\nWe also lie to ourselves about our relationships. We stay in toxic relationships because we tell ourselves that we’re not worthy of something better. We convince ourselves that we need the other person to be happy, even though they’re making us miserable.\nIt’s important to recognize when we’re lying to ourselves so we can stop. We need to be honest with ourselves about our abilities, our goals, and our relationships. Only then can we start making real progress and living our best lives.\n12. Stop being passive and reactive.\nYou wait for things to happen to you instead of taking control of your life and making things happen for yourself. You’re always reacting to situations instead of being proactive and taking action to prevent problems from occurring in the first place.\nBeing passive and reactive can lead to missed opportunities and a lack of progress in your personal and professional life. You may find yourself stuck in a rut, unable to move forward or make any significant changes. You may also find yourself constantly dealing with problems and putting out fires instead of focusing on your goals and aspirations.\n13. Stop playing it safe.\nPlaying it safe is a natural human tendency. We all want to avoid risks and protect ourselves from failure. But sometimes, playing it safe can hold us back from achieving our goals and enjoying life to the fullest.\nIt’s easy to stick to what you know and avoid trying new things. But this can prevent you from discovering new passions and expanding your horizons.\nYou might like to feel comfortable, but don’t mistake stagnation for comfort. With stagnation, everything stays the same, but the absence of change can leave you feeling uncomfortable. You’ll experience an inner unrest that stems from a lack of excitement and growth.",
