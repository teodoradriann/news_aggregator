    "text": "Covid-19: casos em Rio Branco aumentam 426% em 14 dias, e saúde acende sinal de alerta\nO avanço da Covid-19 em Rio Branco se destaca nas últimas semanas epidemiológicas, com dados recentes preocupando autoridades de saúde da região. Nas semanas 49 e 50, observou-se um aumento expressivo nos casos confirmados da doença. Até agora, em 2024, foram identificados 1.369 casos, com nove mortes registradas. Além disso, há 16 pacientes atualmente em isolamento.\nA Secretaria Municipal de Saúde (Semsa) reforça a necessidade de uma vigilância constante por parte dos profissionais de saúde. A identificação precoce dos casos é fundamental para evitar a progressão para quadros graves e para a implementação de medidas eficazes de controle e prevenção. Neste cenário, é essencial que a população participe ativamente das estratégias de mitigação propostas.\nOnde realizar testes para Covid-19 em Rio Branco?\nA coordenadora da Vigilância em Saúde de Rio Branco, Socorro Martins, informa ao g1 que os testes para Covid-19 estão disponíveis nas Unidades de Referência de Atenção Primária (Urap). Contudo, a recomendação é que somente indivíduos sintomáticos procurem essas unidades para testagem, evitando assim a superlotação e a possível disseminação do vírus para pessoas saudáveis.\nA orientação visa proteger a população e o ambiente dos centros de saúde. Martins enfatiza que os testes devem ser realizados após pelo menos três dias de sintomas, como medida para garantir maior precisão no diagnóstico. Assim, a busca precoce por exames pode ajudar a controlar a disseminação do vírus sem expor indivíduos assintomáticos a riscos desnecessários.\nDurante a época de chuvas intensas, o risco de transmissão de doenças como a Covid-19, além de outras infecções respiratórias, aumenta significativamente. Socorro Martins destaca a importância de redobrar os cuidados nesse período. O uso de máscaras, o respeito ao distanciamento social e a higienização frequente das mãos são medidas fundamentais para impedir a disseminação do vírus.\nAdicionalmente, a coordenadora alerta sobre outros males como a dengue, chikungunya e malária, que também podem prejudicar a saúde da população. As condições climáticas favorecem a propagação desses agentes patogênicos e, por isso, os cuidados devem ser adaptados para abrangê-los, mantendo-se vigilantes e preparados para lidar com múltiplas ameaças à saúde pública.",

    "title": "Co. Says Geoprobe Drilling Found 'Consistent' Lithium, Boron Concentrations - Canter Resources (OTC:CNRCF",
    "text": "Source: Streetwise Reports 10/15/2024 Canter Resources Corp. CNRCF announced promising brine assay results from Phase II geoprobe drilling at its Columbus Lithium-Boron Project near Tonopah, Nevada. The company said the results show \"consistent lithium and boron concentrations identified across an expanded widespread area\" with initial multi-element analysis strengthening the project's \"potential for significant lithium and boron brine development.\" \"We completed two phases of shallow drilling for a total of 20 drill holes . . . proving the basin's ability to generate mineralized brines from the surrounding source rocks and guiding our deeper discovery drilling\" Chief Executive Officer Joness Lang told Streetwise Reports. Canter said solid sediment assays expected mid-Q4 will contribute to an updated 3D model of the basin and lead the way for Phase III exploration plans. According to the company, the phased shallow drilling program shows that the Columbus Basin can generate the same lithium-boron mix in brines as Ioneer's (CA$300 million market cap) nearby Rhyolite Ridge sediment deposit. Rhyolite Ridge shares volcanic source rocks with Columbus. \"Rhyolite Ridge is at feasibility stage, and we are building the foundation for a major discovery at Columbus, but these shallow results certainly support our vision for value creation\" Lang said. \"The lithium results at this depth are as expected and fit the widely adopted basin deposit model (Clayton Valley), while the boron results have exceeded expectations and point to the significant co-product multi-commodity potential at Columbus.\" Lithium on its Way Up? The lithium sector has been on a roller coaster this year. It peaked at a high of more than US$79,637 per ton in 2022, but expected sales of electric vehicles (EVs) did not materialize, and prices hit their lowest point in three years in 2024. But in an article for Reuters, Andy Home wrote that the slowdown could easily be reversed. \"One critical facilitator will be the build-out of EV charging infrastructure, a sector which has attracted far less investment than battery manufacturing\" he wrote. \"Car buyers in Europe and the United States are choosing hybrids because of range anxiety, and they will continue to do so until they see more charging points. The second key factor is price.\" Jeff Clark, in The Gold Advisor, pointed out the strategic importance of the company's drilling efforts. \"There is a lot of activity ahead for this young company on a project that shows the potential to match what its neighbors have\" he wrote. However, \"the seeds of the next lithium upswing are already being sown in the current low-price environment\" Home wrote. Clearly, one major mining company is taking that bet. Rio Tinto has agreed to a US$6.7 billion takeover of Arcadium Lithium, offering US$5.85 per share in cash for the company a 90% premium to the stock's closing price at the end of last week, David Winning and Julie Steinberg wrote for Reuters on Wednesday. \"Rio Tinto expects demand for lithium to rise in the decade ahead because of the metal's importance to EVs and in large batteries that store electricity that can be released into the grid when consumption surges\" the authors noted. \"The U.S. has designated lithium as a critical mineral.\" Boron is also essential to the energy transition. The Business Research Co. reports the global market has grown \"exponentially in recent years\" and forecasts it will reach US$7.99 billion this year, up from US$6.57 billion in 2023, reflecting a 21.7% CAGR. Rapid growth is expected to continue in the sector through 2028, at which time the market is projected to reach US$12.68 billion. 'Very Encouraging Signs' In the new Phase II results, Canter said infill drill hole CB24-023G returned 871 milligrams per liter (mg/L) boron and the highest dissolved boron concentration from Canter's drilling to date, 820 mg/L. This provides further \"evidence of significant boron concentrations with increasing grades at depth\" the company said in a release. The Phase II lithium results also continued to demonstrate the consistent, widespread anomalous lithium mineralization in brines. Shallow drilling to-date has returned several brine samples greater than 40 mg/L and a peak value of 76.4 mg/L in the upper 30 meters, Canter said. Data from Albemarle's Silver Peak lithium brine operation in Clayton Valley show lithium concentrations increase with depth, and Canter's lithium concentrations in the upper 100 feet (~30 meters) are \"very comparable, with higher peak values than historically observed in Clayton Valley from the upper 100 meters\" Lang said. The company believes there should be \"higher-grade lithium in the reservoirs and structural traps in this basin as we drill deeper\" he noted. \"That would fit the basin deposit model methodology used throughout the western U.S.A.\" he added. These are \"all really encouraging signs from very cost-effective shallow drilling that's all intended to help vector us towards the best places to take our discovery shots when drilling deeper in subsequent campaigns\" Lang said. \"So, we're really encouraged with what we've seen.\" Elements Vital to Energy Transition Lithium is a critical metal vital in the energy transition for its use in batteries for EVs and other applications. It also is used in electronics, medicine and other industries. According to a report by Grand View Research, market size for the metal was estimated at US$31.75 billion last year and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.7% from this year through 2030. \"The automotive application segment is expected to witness substantial growth, driven by stringent regulations imposed by government bodies on ICE automakers to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from vehicles\" researchers at Grand View said. \"This has shifted the interest of automakers toward producing EVs, which is anticipated to benefit the demand for lithium and related products.\" EVs and battery storage primarily will fuel future growth of the lithium market, Marin Katusa of Katusa Research wrote recently. He pointed out that all major electric vehicle batteries require lithium, about 1.55 pounds per kilowatt hour of battery capacity, on average. \"I think the data speaks for itself that there's more growth and opportunity on the horizon\" Katusa wrote. Boron/borates are used in applications in agriculture, metallurgy, nuclear energy, and advanced materials, Mordor Intelligence noted. The increasing use of fiberglass in various end-user industries is also boosting demand for the element. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, borates are also used in abrasives, cleaning products, insecticides, insulation, ceramics, and semiconductors. \"Growing demand for electronic products and increasing penetration of fiberglass in markets conventionally held by concrete and steel are expected to drive boron market growth\" Grand View Research noted. \"Fiberglass penetration in turbine blades in wind power generation is also expected to have positive influence on boron market development. An increase in construction spending, leading to fiberglass demand for a communal structure such as bridges and roads is expected to come up as a new opportunity for the global market. The scarcity of boron, very concentrated reserves, and multifaceted manufacturing process may be a challenge for participants in the global market.\" 'A Great Basin of Lithium and Boron' Chen Lin wrote in his newsletter What Is Chen Buying? What Is Chen Selling? that Canter \"is looking good [and the Columbus project] hosts a great basin of lithium and boron though the market is not looking at it.\" Jeff Clark, in The Gold Advisor, pointed out the strategic importance of the company's drilling efforts. \"There is a lot of activity ahead for this young company on a project that shows the potential to match what its neighbors have\" he wrote.

    "text": "Nach Statement: Schlagerstar enthüllt Klinikaufenthalt – „Psychosomatisches Problem“\nEs sind Enthüllungen mit Tiefgang: Schlagersänger Eric Philippi spricht erstmals über seine psychischen Probleme und seinen Aufenthalt in einer Klinik.\nKöln – Schlagerstar Eric Philippi (28) hat sich zu einem schwerwiegenden persönlichen Thema geäußert. Nach monatelangem Schweigen macht der Verlobte von Michelle (53) nun öffentlich, warum er sich aus der Öffentlichkeit zurückgezogen hatte. Seine ehrlichen Worte sollen anderen Betroffenen Mut machen und ein wichtiges gesellschaftliches Thema in den Fokus rücken.\nSchlagerstar öffnet sich: Eric Philippi lässt auf Worte Taten folgen\nWie unter anderem wa.de berichtet, hatte Eric Philippi kürzlich über Instagram angekündigt, über „Dinge, die sich immer hinter den Kulissen abgespielt haben“ sprechen zu wollen. Der 28-jährige Schlagerkünstler deutete damals an, dass es jahrelange Kämpfe gegeben habe, während nach außen hin alles perfekt erschien. Seine Fans fragten sich schon länger, warum Eric Philippi immer wieder von der Bildfläche verschwand.\nJetzt hat der Musiker gegenüber der Bild-Zeitung erstmals über seine mentalen Probleme gesprochen. „Ich habe seit langer Zeit ein psychosomatisches Problem, das sich vor allen Dingen durch Panikattacken äußert. Ich konnte nicht mehr am normalen Leben teilnehmen“, erklärte der „Schockverliebt“-Interpret. Anfang des Jahres hatte er sich für drei Monate in eine Privatklinik begeben.\nEric Philippi spricht offen über Panikattacken: Sie verhinderten seine Auftritte\nDie Erkrankung hatte massive Auswirkungen auf die Karriere des Schlagersängers. „Die letzten Auftritte vor meiner Therapie waren kaum noch zu bewältigen und ich konnte gar nicht mehr allein unterwegs sein“, berichtete er weiter. Die Panikattacken begannen mit schwitzigen Händen und einem Puls von 150, gefolgt von Atemnot und der ständigen Angst zu sterben. Diese Symptome machten es zeitweise unmöglich, weiterhin als Entertainer zu arbeiten. Immer wieder hatte der Saarländer Konzerte absagen müssen – teils recht spontan.\nWährend seines Klinikaufenthalts erhielt Eric Philippi Unterstützung von seiner Verlobten Michelle. Die 53-jährige Schlagersängerin besuchte ihn regelmäßig in der Klinik. Rückblickend bezeichnet Philippi die Entscheidung für die Therapie als „eine der besten Entscheidungen meines Lebens“ – ein Schritt, von dem er sich inzwischen wünscht, ihn früher gegangen zu sein. Heute geht es ihm nach eigenen Angaben „so gut wie noch nie“. Übrigens: Die Hochzeit von Michelle und ihrem Eric muss wohl noch ein wenig warten.

    "text": "Nationwide recovery of radioactive devices by Los Alamos National Lab hits major milestone\nPartnership helps mitigate risk of terrorist attacks using a “dirty bomb”\nFebruary 27, 2025\nTwo Los Alamos National Laboratory teams that travel nationwide recovering potentially harmful radioactive material from devices at hospitals, universities, and research facilities completed a momentous milestone in January — their 100th shipment of such material since the partnership began in 2019.\nSince then, the teams have removed 190,023 curies — units of radioactivity — of material from across the United States in sealed sources, disposing of the material at Department of Energy facilities. These recovery and disposal missions enhance national security by preventing the material from being stolen, smuggled, and used in acts of terrorism.\n\"Since our first shipment three-and-a-half years ago, we've completed 100 shipments,\" said Wade Weyerman of Los Alamos’s Repository Science and Operations division, noting that safety is the team's top priority.\nReducing radiological risk\nLeading these operations is the Lab's Mobile Loading Source Recovery Team, launched in 2019 as part of the Repository Science and Operations division, and the long-standing Off-Site Source Recovery Program (OSRP) in the Lab’s Nuclear Engineering and Nonproliferation division. Established in 1997 and expanded following the September 11 terrorist attacks, OSRP provides direction and oversight to the Recovery Team and receives funding from the Office of Radiological Security within the Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration’s (DOE/NNSA).\n\"We're trying to reduce the amount of radioactive material in the public sphere that could be used in a dirty bomb,\" said Bill Stewart, program manager for OSRP.\nOne key device that has been the focus of recent removal efforts is the blood irradiator, which uses cesium-137 to treat donated blood, primarily by deactivating problematic cells, prior to transfusions. Removing these devices from facilities is part of the Office of Radiological Security's Cesium Irradiator Replacement Project, which also promotes the development and adoption of alternative technologies, such as X-ray devices and linear accelerators, via financial incentives for U.S. institutions.\n\"The collaboration between the Mobile Loading Source Recovery Team and OSRP is highly effective and successful as demonstrated by the completion of 100 shipments,\" said Doug Weaver, the Repository Science and Operations division leader. \"The Recovery Team brings expertise in Type B packaging and operations, working closely with OSRP to ensure the successful removal of unwanted sealed radioactive sources.\"\nFirst used in 2021, LANL’s 380-B package provides shielding from radiation during transport of sealed radioactive sources. The container was designed, tested, and certified with OSRP's expertise in response to a nationwide shortage of such containers. This shortage had been a major impediment to the program's work.\nLeft: The blood irradiator removed from the University of California San Diego was placed into a container that provides shielding from radiation during transport. Right: Sealed radioactive sources are removed from the devices in a hot cell facility for interim storage before disposal.\nWhile some Recovery Team staff are stationed in the Lab's Carlsbad offices, others work in various locations across the country, then deploy to the sites in question when a recovery job begins. In addition to planning removals—which sometimes includes coordinating surveillance with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) teams—the team loads, leak-tests, and facilitates transport of the radioactive material.\nThey typically work during non-peak hours, especially in big cities such as Los Angeles, Boston and Philadelphia, so they don't impact roadways, loading docks or shipping facilities with their oversized cranes and trucks.\nThe Mobile Loading Source Recovery Team’s 100th removal and shipment included an irradiator with 1,275 curies of cesium from the University of California San Diego. Like every project, it entailed a site- and device-specific hazard analysis plan, along with a risk-mitigation plan to keep the public, workers, and environment safe.\nFollowing completion of this milestone, OSRP is continuing to move forward with the mission, with a total of 35 removals planned this year.\nLA-UR-25-21263\nContact\nPublic Affairs | media_relations@lanl.gov",

    "text": "El exterior de la Real Casa de Correos ha acogido este lunes, el solemne acto de homenaje a las v\\u00edctimas del 11 de marzo, el atentado yihadista en el que murieron 193 personas y hubo 2.000 heridos cuando se cumplen 20 a\\u00f1os.La presidenta de la Comunidad de Madrid, Isabel D\\u00edaz Ayuso, y el alcalde de Madrid, Jos\\u00e9 Luis Mart\\u00ednez-Almeida, han depositado una corona de laurel ante la placa situada en la fachada del edificio en recuerdo a las v\\u00edctimas, as\\u00ed como a los servicios de emergencias y ciudadanos que las auxiliaron.De forma simultanea la Orquesta y Coro de la Comunidad de Madrid ha interpretado los acordes del 'Adagio for strings' de Samuel Barber.La ceremonia ha comenzado con el sonido de las campanas del reloj de la sede de la Presidencia regional, a las que se han sumado las de las iglesias cercanas a la Puerta del Sol.Ayuso: \"Hoy lo que cabe es sobre todo la unidad en contra del terrorismo\"Al acto han asistido, entre otros, el presidente del Senado, Pedro Roll\\u00e1n; el delegado del Gobierno en Madrid, Francisco Mart\\u00edn; el l\\u00edder del PP, Alberto N\\u00fa\\u00f1ez Feij\\u00f3o; consejeros del Gobierno regional, diputados de la Asamblea, expresidentes de la Comunidad, alcaldes y concejales. Adem\\u00e1s, han estado las asociaciones de v\\u00edctimas y una representaci\\u00f3n de las Fuerzas y Cuerpos de Seguridad del Estado as\\u00ed como de profesionales de los servicios de emergencias que ayudaron en la tragedia.ALMEIDA CLAMA CONTRA \"LA DESMEMORIA\"El primero en intervenir ha sido el alcalde de Madrid, Jos\\u00e9 Lu\\u00eds Mart\\u00ednez-Almeida quien ha hecho hincapi\\u00e9 en que tal d\\u00eda como hoy se cumplen \"20 a\\u00f1os de un d\\u00eda de infamia\", en el que \"el terrorismo caus\\u00f3 un inmenso dolor y una profunda tristeza\" pero ha incidido en que entonces este no consigui\\u00f3 \"poner de rodillas a la ciudad de Madrid\".TMDALV20240311_0002\"Esta ciudad, 20 a\\u00f1os despu\\u00e9s, sigue firme en que debemos acompa\\u00f1ar siempre a las v\\u00edctimas de aquel atentado, que deben ocupar siempre el primer lugar en nuestros pensamientos y en nuestras oraciones\", ha subrayado, al tiempo que ha sostenido que es necesario \"mantener vivo el recuerdo de las v\\u00edctimas\", que \"es un faro de luz que gu\\u00eda al conjunto de la sociedad\". Para Almeida, \"la desmemoria ser\\u00eda darle una victoria a la barbarie\" y esta \"ya no se cobrar\\u00e1 ni una victoria m\\u00e1s, no en Madrid\". \"Ese es por tanto nuestro compromiso. Que el recuerdo de vuestros familiares seguir\\u00e1 vivo en la ciudad de Madrid (...) Vuestra memoria, v\\u00edctimas, supervivientes y familiares se mantendr\\u00e1 intacta y que esta ciudad siempre os tendr\\u00e1 en el coraz\\u00f3n\", ha manifestado. El regidor ha incidido en que, en todo caso, \"a\\u00fan en los peores momentos\" la llama de la esperanza \"se mantuvo siempre viva, por un bien mejor\" con madrile\\u00f1os que pusieron \"lo m\\u00e1s concreto que ten\\u00edan al servicio de quienes m\\u00e1s sufr\\u00edan en aquel momento\". As\\u00ed, ha recordado \"las im\\u00e1genes de los pabellones de Ifema, de los hospitales inundados de gente que quer\\u00eda donar sangre, de aquel polideportivo Dao\\u00edz y Velarde... im\\u00e1genes del horror, pero tambi\\u00e9n de la esperanza m\\u00e1s poderosa\". \"Todo terrorismo es inadmisible, no existen gradaciones ni excepciones de ning\\u00fan tipo y en Espa\\u00f1a lo sabemos bien, demasiado bien. Somos una naci\\u00f3n que desgraciadamente sabe lo que es el dolor inmenso de los atentados terroristas. La historia de la Espa\\u00f1a democr\\u00e1tica se ha forjado sobre el coraz\\u00f3n, el valor y el sacrificio de quienes perdieron su vida por el terrorismo y es de las v\\u00edctimas de quienes cada d\\u00eda obtenemos una ense\\u00f1anza indeleble, inolvidable y que debe permanecer siempre en nuestra memoria\", ha subrayado.Almeida: \"20 a\\u00f1os despu\\u00e9s el dolor permanece\"Tras \\u00e9l ha tomado la palabra Vera de Benito, quien aquella ma\\u00f1ana de jueves, con 10 a\\u00f1os, se convert\\u00eda en v\\u00edctima del terrorismo al perder a su padre, Esteban, en los atentados. De Benito ha puesto el foco en c\\u00f3mo Espa\\u00f1a ha sido \"diana\" de la violencia \"por demasiado tiempo\", pero ha reivindicado que tras \"cada disparo o bomba\" la sociedad ha sabido dar una \"airada respuesta\" estando \"siempre a la altura\". \"Recuerdo las eternas filas para donar sangre en aquel marzo cuando la Comunidad de Madrid\", ha proseguido De Benito, quien ha apuntado tambi\\u00e9n la \"enorme generosidad\" y el \"enorme trabajo\" de las Fuerzas y Cuerpos de Seguridad del Estado que \"antepusieron su integridad a la incertidumbre\" de aquellos momentos.TMDALV20240311_0004A rengl\\u00f3n seguido, ha expuesto c\\u00f3mo el pa\\u00eds ha visto \"fraguarse una recomposici\\u00f3n de las almas\" de los afectados por lo que este lunes se pone en valor \"la memoria y la unidad de todo un pa\\u00eds\". Asimismo, ha dedicado unas palabras a su padre. Sobre \\u00e9l ha destacado los recuerdos como sus vacaciones o las tardes viendo pel\\u00edculas. \"Ojal\\u00e1 estuviera aqu\\u00ed, viera el primer libro publicado o me llevara al altar en septiembre\", ha lamentado. \"Agradezco mis 10 a\\u00f1os junto a \\u00e9l. El aprendizaje profundo del amor de mi familia. Lo importante que es contar con los que son como un b\\u00e1lsamo (...) Pueden habernos quitado f\\u00edsicamente a nuestros familiares, pero jam\\u00e1s podr\\u00e1n quitarnos su memoria\", ha trasladado, visiblemente emocionada.AYUSO: \"NADIE PUEDE CONDICIONAR NUESTRO CAMINO\" \"Nos reunimos en la Puerta del Sol con el coraz\\u00f3n encogido, a\\u00fan incapaces de asimilar tanto dolor y crueldad, pero comprometidos con el recuerdo de todas y cada una de las v\\u00edctimas, sus familias y amigos. Siempre estaremos con ellos\", ha comenzado a continuaci\\u00f3n la presidenta de la Comunidad, Isabel D\\u00edaz Ayuso. La dirigente regional ha incidido en que a\\u00fan en estas circunstancias, \"Madrid se hizo uno\", de la misma forma que siempre responde la regi\\u00f3n \"cuando alguien se pierde, cae, necesita, sufre, cuando alza las manos blancas contra el terror o extiende los brazos para acurrucar a una v\\u00edctima\".TMDALV20240311_0001Ayuso ha recordado a las \"familias rotas, amigos que no volver\\u00e1n, secuelas f\\u00edsicas y emocionales\". \"El terrorismo quiso cambiarnos, acobardarnos y someternos. No cabe mejor resistencia que el seguir siendo como somos, el de las calles de Madrid hoy rebosantes de gentes de toda condici\\u00f3n, dispuestas a seguir con sus vidas adelante. La libertad se defiende ejerci\\u00e9ndola, cada d\\u00eda, en cada circunstancia. Nada ni nadie puede, por medio de la amenaza, el miedo o el chantaje, condicionar nuestro camino. Aquel 11 de marzo lo recordamos como si fuera ayer\", ha subrayado. Para la presidenta de la Comunidad, \"el amor y el compromiso con la libertad y la vida solo pueden multiplicarse cuando se ponen en riesgo\" por \"dignidad\" y por saberse \"m\\u00e1s fuertes y mejores que el odio y el fanatismo\". \"Cada 11 de marzo todos los espa\\u00f1oles tenemos el alma con las v\\u00edctimas y con sus seres queridos. Una ma\\u00f1ana de marzo el terrorismo les apag\\u00f3 la luz cobardemente. Desde entonces esta vibra con fuerza dentro de todos los que ahora y siempre estaremos a su lado\", ha concluido.TMDALV20240311_0005A continuaci\\u00f3n la cantante Diana Navarro ha interpretado el tema 'Adios' junto a la Orquesta y Coro de la Comunidad de Madrid.El acto ha finalizado con las notas del himno nacional.",

    "text": "The laboratory-grown diamond industry is at a pivotal moment, facing challenges like falling prices, oversupply, and declining trust in certain areas. At the same time, it seeks to capitalise on emerging opportunities within and beyond the jewellery market.\\nNatural diamonds down 30 per cent The diamond industry is facing dramatic shifts, with the price of natural diamonds seeing a significant decline over the past decade.\\n“Over the past 10 years, the price of a slightly-better-than-medium-quality 1-carat, round, polished natural diamond is down about 25-30 per cent at retail,\\u0026quot; a report by Financial Times quoted industry analyst Paul Zimnisky as saying.\\nAdvertisement This price drop reflects changing market dynamics, where the competition from lab-grown diamonds has impacted the traditional diamond market.\\nLab-grown diamonds down 90 per cent Lab-grown diamonds, which were once seen as a niche market, have experienced an even more dramatic price decline.\\nZimnisky explains, “An equivalent lab-grown diamond is down about 90-95 per cent. Today, a generic lab-grown diamond can be bought for as little as one-20th the price of an equivalent natural diamond.”\\nWhile falling prices have led to significant growth in consumer sales, with lab-grown diamonds now accounting for about 20 per cent of global diamond jewellery sales, the market still struggles with issues of oversupply and consumer trust.\\nDemand-supply mismatch The lab-grown diamond industry is also dealing with a mismatch between production and demand. As production volumes increase, prices continue to fall, with some companies struggling to maintain profitability.\\nChina and India have emerged as the largest producers of lab-grown diamonds, but the US remains the biggest retail market.\\nDespite this growth, there are still challenges, including consumer confusion over diamond classifications and concerns about fraud.\\nThe Gem and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) of India has sought to address these issues by calling on the Indian government to adopt updated diamond terminology and guidelines, modeled after the US Federal Trade Commission\\u0026rsquo;s (FTC) standards.\\nSeveral companies have gone bankrupt Amid the rising competition, several lab-grown diamond companies have failed. One of the most high-profile casualties was WD Lab Grown Diamonds, which filed for bankruptcy in October last year. It was once a leading US producer.\\nZimnisky noted that it has become “very difficult for anyone to compete with Chinese and Indian producers.”\\nThe challenges of oversupply and falling prices have taken their toll on companies, with the growing presence of cheap synthetic diamonds raising concerns about fraud and even money laundering activities. Examples include cases of fraudulent swapping of natural diamonds for lab-grown stones, and the discovery of lab-grown diamonds being mis-declared as natural ones for money laundering purposes.\\nAdvertisement As the market continues to evolve, industry experts suggest that product innovation will be key to surviving in the competitive lab-grown diamond sector.\\nWith inputs from Financial Times.\\n",

    "text": "Cronaca meteo - Anomala inondazione invernale di Budapest dalle acque del Danubio. Foto e video Troppa pioggia e clima eccessivamente mite che ha sciolto la neve caduta in precedenza. ore 13:56 [di Carlo Migliore](/community/utente/carlom-12223) 1 minuto, 5 secondi A detta degli abitati della capitale Ungherese l'ultima volta che il livello del Danubio è salito di 6 metri in un mese è stato nel dicembre del 1987, ben 36 anni fa ma allora l'acqua non aveva allagato le strade di Budapest. Questo significa che l'evento iniziato due giorni fa può essere considerato un evento eccezionale. Secondo gli scienziati che si stanno occupando dell'anomalia questo è un chiaro segnale di quanto il cambiamento climatico stia influenzando l'andamento della stagione invernale nel Paese. Le esondazioni non sono inconsuete ma non accadono mai nel periodo invernale, solitamente ciò avviene nella stagione primaverile quando la neve accumulata durante l'inverno fonde e l'acqua di fusione va ad aggiungersi a quella di abbondante precipitazione ingrossando l'alveo. Se ciò capita a dicembre quando la superficie del fiume dovrebbe addirittura essere ghiacciata c'è evidentemente qualcosa che non va. Al di la delle cause questa inondazione precoce ha creato non pochi problemi in città tanto che le autorità ungheresi hanno dichiarato lo stato di emergenza. La situazione è particolarmente critica vicino al Parlamento, dove il fiume ha rotto gli argini, allagando la banchina inferiore e le strade che normalmente sarebbero trafficate dalle auto.

The contract, secured by Teamsters Local 120, includes a 30 percent wage increase, expanded vacation time, increased pension contributions, and Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a paid holiday. The new agreement also includes strong strike protections and new language to guard against job loss from automation.\n\"We made it clear to Sysco we were ready to walk if they didn't come to the table with a fair contract,\" said Andy Ketcher , a Sysco driver and Local 120 steward. \"Because we stood together, we won a deal that rewards our hard work and gives us the respect we deserve.\"\nSysco is one of the largest and most profitable food service companies in the United States . In 2024, it reported $1.95 billion in net profits — up more than 10 percent from the year prior. Just days before the deal, Local 120 members voted unanimously to authorize a strike , pressuring Sysco to return with a contract that reflects its record profits.\n\"This is a huge win for our members and their families,\" said Brandon Brink , a Local 120 business agent. \"Our members stood tall and didn't back down in the face of corporate greed. That solidarity delivered real results.\"\nTeamsters Local 120 proudly represents over 15,000 workers in Wisconsin , Minnesota , Iowa , North Dakota , and South Dakota .
