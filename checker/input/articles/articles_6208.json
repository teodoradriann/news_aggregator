    "text": "House where University of Idaho students killed torn down. Victims' families opposed it Published in [News & Features](/currentnews/newsheadlines/) Demolition of the off-campus home where four University of Idaho students were killed last year began Thursday morning over continued protests from at least half of the victims’ families. Work to bring down the unique property got underway before dawn. The noise from the heavy machinery pierced the nearby campus as a local construction firm used an excavator to rip away portions of the facade, starting at the front door. By the scheduled start time of 7 a.m. Pacific, as dozens of members of the media arrived to encircle the boarded-up property and train their cameras toward the wreckage, half of the King Road home was on the ground. About an hour later, the former residence was almost entirely gone. The house, a six-bedroom, three-bathroom rental located less than 600 feet from the university’s new Greek row, was the site of the November 2022 quadruple homicide — one of the most talked-about crimes in state history. The victims were U. of I. seniors Kaylee Goncalves and Madison Mogen, both 21, junior Xana Kernodle and freshman Ethan Chapin, both 20. The three women were tenants of the home with two female housemates who were not physically harmed in the fatal stabbings. Chapin was Kernodle’s boyfriend and stayed over for the night. Bryan Kohberger, a graduate student at Washington State University in neighboring Pullman, Washington, at the time, was arrested and charged with the crime in late December 2022. He stood silent when asked to enter a plea, which led to a not guilty plea on his behalf. Kohberger, 29, a Pennsylvania native, could face the death penalty if convicted. A trial date has yet to be set. In the spring, the private owner of the house at 1122 King Road donated the property to the university, and the school made plans for its destruction. After the home was left standing for more than a year, U. of I. committed to knocking it down and announced earlier this month a Thursday demolition date. “It is the grim reminder of the heinous act that took place there,” Scott Green, U. of I.’s president, said in a statement at the time. “While we appreciate the emotional connection some family members of the victims may have to this house, it is time for its removal and to allow the collective healing of our community to continue.” Debate over U. of I.’s decision ...continued ©2023 The Idaho Statesman.

    "text": "Epaminondas Korkoneas, the cop who murdered 15-year-old Alexandros Grigoropoulos on December 6, 2008, setting off a near month of riots in Athens and several other Greek cities, will face yet another trial after the Supreme Court threw out an appeals court decision reducing his initial life sentence because of lack of criminal record up to that event.\\r\\nIt is the second time the high court invalidates an appeals court decision on Korkoneas. The new trial will focus on whether there are mitigating factors that would affect his sentence.\\r\\nKorkoneas has been found as a beneficiary of the mitigating factors – having lived a “lawful life” - twice by the appeals court in the city of Lamia, Central Greece, in July 2019 and June 2022, receiving a 13-year-sentence. He was initially released in 2019, re-arrested in 2022 and released again the same year. In his third trial, the four jurors voted for the lesser sentence and the three judges dissented.\\r\\nThe night of the murder, Korkoneas and a colleague were on patrol in the Athens neighborhood of Exarchia, a gathering spot for anarchists and other leftists, when a group of youths threw objects at their patrol car, apparently without threatening to cause injury.. In the resulting confrontation, there was an apparent exchange of words between Grigoropoulos and Korkoneas, with the latter shooting the unarmed youth.",

Photo courtesy UW-Stevens Point. STEVENS POINT – A University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point emeritus biology professor and founding member of a local conservation organization was honored July 17 for his lifelong environment work.\nProfessor Emeritus Robert Freckmann was presented the 2024 Harold “Bud” Jordahl Lifetime Achievement Award by the North Central Conservancy Trust and Gathering Waters, Wisconsin’s Alliance for Land Trusts. The ceremony was held July 17 at Schmeeckle Reserve in Stevens Point.\nFreckmann taught plant taxonomy and agrostology at UW-Stevens Point for 32 years before his retirement in 2001. He and Professor Frank Bowers began a herbarium collection of plant and grass specimens in 1969, which was named the Robert W. Freckman Herbarium upon his retirement. It includes a quarter of a million specimen records and is the second largest herbarium in Wisconsin.\nHe was a founding member of the NCCT, which has protected more than 5,000 acres in eight counties, creating conservation easements that are protected from development. Freckmann and his late wife, Sally, created a protected easement on their property that served as an outdoor classroom for his biology students. He continues to serve on the NCCT Properties Committee and conduct botany surveys for landowners interested in conservation easements.\n“Bob has dedicated his life to conservation and contributed to the scientific body of knowledge and he is still curating today,” said Chris Radford, NCCT executive director. The lifetime achievement award shows the organization’s gratitude towards Freckmann for his decades of service leading interpretive hikes for the public, identifying native plant species and sharing resources, he said.\nSource: UW-Stevens Point\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "title": "Popular EPCOT Ride Suddenly Ceases Operations After Almost Four Years",
    "text": "Guests arriving at EPCOT on January 28 were met with unexpected disappointment when one of the park’s most popular attractions, Remy’s Ratatouille Adventure, never opened for the day. The sudden closure left many scrambling to adjust their plans, and Walt Disney World Resort issued an apology but offered little explanation for the ride’s extended downtime.\nAn Unwelcome Surprise for EPCOT Visitors Credit: Disney Since its opening in 2021, Remy’s Ratatouille Adventure has been a must-visit attraction for EPCOT guests. The trackless dark ride, inspired by the Pixar classic Ratatouille (2007), regularly commands lengthy wait times and remains one of the most in-demand experiences in the World Showcase.\nBut on Tuesday, guests eager to start their day in the France Pavilion were met with an unfortunate surprise. Remy’s Ratatouille Adventure was closed from park open to park close—with no prior warning. Cast Members stationed outside the attraction informed guests that technical issues had rendered the ride inoperable and that they could not provide an estimated reopening time.\nCrowds Surge at Other EPCOT Attractions The unexpected loss of a major ride caused a ripple effect across EPCOT, leading to surging wait times at other attractions. Soarin’ Around the World, Frozen Ever After, and other attractions saw increased demand as guests scrambled to fill the gap left by Remy’s closure.\nCredit: Screenshot via the My Disney Experience app The situation was further complicated by the ongoing closure of Test Track , which is currently undergoing a lengthy refurbishment. With fewer high-capacity attractions available, EPCOT guests were left with limited options.\nSome Disney Park guests held out hope that the ride would reopen later in the day, lingering around the entrance in case operations resumed. But as the day progressed, it became clear that Remy’s Ratatouille Adventure would remain closed for the entire operating day.\nDisney Issues a Formal Apology By mid-afternoon, EPCOT Vice President Kartika S. Rodriguez issued a statement to Walt Disney World Resort guests through the My Disney Experience app , formally apologizing for the closure.\nCredit: Screenshot via the My Disney Experience app “Pardon the Inconvenience,” the notification read.\n“On behalf of the entire team at EPCOT, I’d like to apologize that Remy’s Ratatouille Adventure is currently unavailable,” Rodriguez wrote. “Our Cast Members are working diligently to get the attraction up and running again, and we are sorry you are not able to experience this attraction at this time. I hope you will enjoy some of our other attractions during your experience in the park today.”\nWhile attraction breakdowns are common at Walt Disney World Resort , a ride being out of service for an entire day—with a formal apology from park leadership—is unusual.\nNo Explanation for the Remy’s Ratatouille Adventure Closure Credit: Screenshot via the My Disney Experience app By 7:30 p.m., wait times for other EPCOT attractions remained elevated, with many Walt Disney World Resort guests still feeling the effects of Remy’s Ratatouille Adventure’s absence. The ride remained closed from 8:30 a.m. early entry until EPCOT’s 9:00 p.m. closing time, leaving families wondering what could have caused such an extended outage.\nDespite the unexpected closure, Remy’s Ratatouille Adventure quietly reopened the following morning on January 29. Walt Disney World Resort has not provided an official explanation for the sudden and prolonged downtime.\nHave you missed out on a Walt Disney World Resort ride because of a breakdown? Let Disney Dining know in the comments.",

    "text": "La dimisión de Errejón fuerza un nuevo cambio de planes en Sumar y profundiza su crisis en su peor momento La [dimisión de Íñigo Errejón](https://www.eldiario.es/politica/inigo-errejon-deja-escano-abandona-politica-termino-etapa-importante-vida_1_11760464.html) es una bomba de racimo que impacta en todas las capas posibles a Sumar. La ejecutiva inició una investigación cuando fue consciente de las denuncias anónimas que atribuían a su portavoz en el Congreso comportamientos machistas. Pero el caso deja muy tocada a la alianza de izquierdas en general y obliga a una nueva reestructuración del grupo parlamentario. Sumar pierde a su principal referente parlamentario y deberá buscar entre sus filas a una nueva voz, la tercera en poco más de un año de legislatura. Errejón se introdujo en la órbita de Sumar en las negociaciones para la coalición de las elecciones del 23 de julio. Con un papel discreto al principio de la legislatura fue ganando peso en el grupo parlamentario hasta que Yolanda Díaz lo eligió portavoz tras la salida de Marta Lois. Su papel también fue creciendo en la parte orgánica de la coalición y del partido, primero con su participación en la ponencia política de la asamblea y después con los cuadros que trajo de Más País y terminó integrando en el proyecto de la vicepresidenta segunda. Desde entonces, Errejón se había convertido en el principal referente de la coalición en el Congreso. A su rol como portavoz acompañaba la negociación con los grupos parlamentarios y el liderazgo en buena parte de las decisiones que terminaban consensuándose dentro del grupo. Esta misma semana había protagonizado un giro estratégico negociando con el PP un intercambio de apoyos para sacar adelante una iniciativa propia. Es por eso que su salida, más allá de las evidentes repercusiones políticas y éticas que implica, deja un gran agujero a Sumar que tendrá que analizar ahora cómo lo reemplaza. La discusión se dará en los próximos días porque la prioridad en estas últimas horas ha sido la gestión de la crisis. Desde que en el seno de la coalición conocieron las denuncias que supuestamente lo implicaban [iniciaron una investigación.](https://www.eldiario.es/politica/sumar-anuncia-proceso-recabar-informacion-acusaciones-errejon-aceptar-dimision_1_11761609.html) La llamada de Yolanda Díaz Después de que Errejón admitiera que los mensajes anónimos hablaban de él y contaban la verdad, varios partidos de la coalición fueron presionándolo para que dimitiera. El ruido interno fue creciendo hasta que la propia Yolanda Díaz lo telefoneó, aunque la decisión era ya irreversible. “Tras las informaciones aparecidas esta semana, desde Sumar iniciamos un proceso para recabar información sobre las declaraciones que se habían vertido, fundamentalmente en redes sociales, sobre Íñigo Errejón. En la mañana de hoy, Íñigo Errejón envió a la ejecutiva de Sumar el comunicado que acaba de hacer público, presentando su dimisión irrevocable como miembro de la ejecutiva, diputado y portavoz del Grupo Parlamentario Plurinacional de Sumar”, ha explicado el partido en un comunicado. “La ejecutiva de Movimiento Sumar se ha reunido de manera inmediata y, tras haber escuchado las razones expuestas por Íñigo Errejón, ha aceptado de forma unánime su dimisión”, ha añadido. Pero Sumar tampoco tiene demasiado tiempo para solucionar el agujero que deja Errejón, más en un momento clave en lo que va de legislatura, cuando empiezan a moverse las negociaciones para los Presupuestos Generales del Estado y repunta la actividad parlamentaria. La próxima semana, de hecho, va una importante ley para la coalición al Congreso: el primer paso para desbloquear la ley mordaza, después del acuerdo que el Gobierno alcanzó con EH Bildu hace unas semanas. Algunos dirigentes del grupo parlamentario piden abordar este tema con serenidad y pasando rápido de pantalla, sobre todo después de la celeridad con la que se ha actuado, defienden. Uno de los primeros pasos dentro del grupo parlamentario será elegir a una nueva voz en el Congreso, lo que vuelve a abrir las quinielas que empezaron a funcionar cuando Marta Lois dejó al cargo para encabezar la candidatura de Sumar a las elecciones gallegas. Sumar ya tiene portavoces parlamentarios con experiencia, aunque la mayoría pertenecen a formaciones políticas de la coalición que no son de la cuota de diputados propia de Yolanda Díaz, como Aina Vidal de los comuns, Enrique Santiago de Izquierda Unida o Àgueda Micó de Compromís. Por otro lado, Movimiento Sumar debe cubrir el hueco que deja el dirigente en la ejecutiva, en la que había asumido la tarea de elaborar las tesis políticas, cuando quedan apenas dos meses para la nueva asamblea de la formación. La noticia impacta a la coalición después de unos meses muy complicados, con resultados muy pobres en las autonómicas que cerraron el curso político y también en las europeas del 9 de junio. Las encuestas tampoco mejoran desde entonces y muestran que Sumar ha perdido aproximadamente la mitad de los apoyos que reunió hace algo más de un año en las elecciones del 23 de julio. [El último CIS](https://www.eldiario.es/politica/cis-reduce-ventaja-psoe-pp-2-5-puntos-caen-sumar-vox_1_11749690.html) refleja un 6,3% de apoyos frente al 12,3% que sacó en las generales.",

    "text": "Crisi KTM, Debiti Miliardari e Posti di Lavoro a Rischio\nArticolo Precedente\nArticolo Successivo\nLa KTM, gigante europeo delle due ruote, ha recentemente presentato istanza di fallimento presso il tribunale di Ried im Innkreis, in Austria, a causa di un debito complessivo di 2,9 miliardi di euro. La crisi finanziaria, che ha colpito KTM AG e le sue sussidiarie KTM Components GmbH e KTM Forschungs und Entwicklungs GmbH, è stata causata da una combinazione di fattori, tra cui l'aumento dei costi e il calo della domanda, che hanno portato l'azienda ad accumulare un'eccedenza di oltre 130.000 moto invendute.\nIl debito dichiarato da KTM AG ammonta a 1,8 miliardi di euro, ma l'Associazione dei creditori alpini (AKV) stima che il debito totale delle tre entità raggiunga i 2,9 miliardi di euro. La situazione è particolarmente grave per i dipendenti, con circa tremila posti di lavoro a rischio. La crisi ha avuto un impatto significativo sull'industria dei motori, dimostrando come anche un colosso come KTM possa trovarsi in difficoltà in un mercato in rapida evoluzione.\nLa documentazione presentata al tribunale evidenzia la gravità della situazione finanziaria di KTM, che ha visto un aumento esponenziale dei costi operativi e una diminuzione delle vendite. Questo squilibrio ha portato l'azienda a non essere in grado di far fronte ai propri obblighi finanziari, costringendola a ricorrere alla procedura di insolvenza.\nLa crisi di KTM rappresenta un duro colpo per l'industria motociclistica europea, che dovrà affrontare le conseguenze di questa situazione nei prossimi mesi.",

    "text": "Justice Department says new Texas immigration law violates Constitution\nWashington (CNN) — A new law that gives local law enforcement in Texas the authority to arrest migrants “violates the US Constitution,” the Department of Justice said in a letter to Gov. Greg Abbott on Thursday, threatening to sue unless Abbott backs down from enforcing it.\nThe letter, obtained by CNN, marks the latest escalation between President Joe Biden and Abbott over the handling of the US-Mexico border.\nEarlier this month, Abbott, a Republican, signed into law the measure, known as\n Senate Bill 4, which gives local law enforcement the power to arrest migrants and gives judges the ability to issue orders to remove people from the United States. The White House slammed the law, calling it “incredibly extreme.” It’s expected to take effect in March.\nPrincipal deputy assistant attorney general Brian Boynton said in his letter to Abbott Thursday that “the United States intends to file suit to enjoin the enforcement of SB 4 unless Texas agrees to refrain from enforcing the law.”\nWhile the federal government is “committed to … securing the border,” Boynton wrote, the Texas law is “contrary to these goals.”\nThe ongoing surge of migrants at the US-Mexico border has placed immense pressure on local and federal resources. Thursday’s legal threat follows a DOJ lawsuit against Texas earlier this year over the state’s use of\n floating barriers in the Rio Grande. That lawsuit is still making its way through the courts.\nThe enforcement of immigration law is a federal responsibility, and opponents of the Texas measure argue it’s unconstitutional.\nThe law has sent ripples of fear throughout the Latino community in Texas, which makes up\n40% of the state’s population. Civil-rights groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, filed a lawsuit seeking to block the measure.\nThe Justice Department’s threat to sue comes on the heels of a\nhigh-levels talks between senior US and Mexican officials this week\nOfficials from both countries described talks as productive, and Mexican officials are\nexpected to visit Washington next month to continue the discussions.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.
