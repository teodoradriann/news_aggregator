    "text": "Trump: ‘Crazy’ for any Christian to vote for Democrat\nFormer President Trump told attendees at a Christian media convention Thursday that it would be “crazy” for any Christian to vote for a Democratic candidate, framing the 2024 election as a broader fight against a “radical left” intent on going after patriotic Christians.\n“How any Christian can vote for a Democrat, Christian or person of faith, person of faith — how you can vote for a Democrat is crazy. It’s crazy,” Trump said at the National Religious Broadcasters (NRB) International Christian Media Convention in Nashville.\nTrump made the remark while railing against his multiple indictments, characterizing himself as the victim of “the radical left” that he claimed is “coming after all of us” due to “allegiance to our country” and “our creator.”\nThe former president has sought to shore up support among Christian conservatives, who were key to his 2016 electoral rise, as he works to clinch the Republican presidential nomination this year and go head-to-head against President Biden in November.\nA recent poll found more Republican respondents saying Trump is a person of faith in comparison to other GOP figures. The survey, conducted by HarrisX for Deseret News, found 64 percent of Republicans saying Trump is a person of faith.\nThat was higher than the 56 percent of Republicans who said they think former Vice President Mike Pence, an evangelical Christian, is a person of faith. Trump soured on Pence after he played a largely ceremonial role formalizing the 2020 election results on Jan. 6, 2021.\nThe former president in his speech Thursday said Christians “can’t afford to sit on the sidelines” in what he said is a fight against political opponents — “whether you call it the radical left, or the communists or the fascists.”\n“They have to really get out there, and they have to do what they have to do, and they have to win,” Trump said.\nBiden’s campaign recently said that a second Trump presidential term would be “straight out of the Handmaid’s Tale,” in the wake of a Politico report detailing how the former president’s allies are working to incorporate “Christian nationalist ideas” into another term.\n“This is straight out of the Handmaid’s Tale. Nationwide abortion bans, attacks on same-sex marriage, and restrictions on contraception — this is the horrifying reality being openly discussed by Team Trump and the likely architects of his second term agenda,” Biden campaign spokesperson Lauren Hitt said Tuesday.\nFor the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to The Hill.",

    "title": "Bitcoin Miner Stocks Beat Blue-Chips In Trading Volumes, Analyst Says Miners To Peak As BTC Rallies - Benzinga",
    "text": " Bitcoin miner stocks have witnessed a significant rally in trading volumes compared to blue-chip stocks on the exchange amidst the rise in traders’ interest in Bitcoin.\nWhat Happened: Based on data, Bitcoin miners such as Marathon Digital Holdings Inc MARA reported a trading volume of 98 million at the time of writing compared to 81.3 million of Tesla Inc TSLA , Apple Inc AAPL at 19.9 million and Nio Inc - ADR NIO with 71.5 million. Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN , Meta Platforms Inc. META and Palantir Technologies PLTR reported 16.5 million, 7.2 million, and 28.1 million, respectively.\nAmong the other Bitcoin miners, TerraWulf Inc WULF reported 49.4 million, Riot Platforms Inc RIOT stood at 36.7 million followed by Bitfarms Ltd BITF at 29.5 million, CleanSpark Inc CLSK at 20.2 million and Bit Digital Inc BTBT at 18.6 million.\nMike Alfred, an engaged value investor, took to X and said , \"Heavy algo activity after hours in the select group of miners I watch outside regular market hours. Every time I've seen this recently, it's had a perfect record calling a big move up the following day. The big squeeze is already on but we may see even more participation tomorrow\"\nBitcoin mining companies are looking to expand operations on the heels of a likely spot Bitcoin ETF approval and the scheduled Bitcoin halving event in April 2024.\nWhy It Matters: Marathon Digital announced purchasing new mining sites for $178.6 million adding 390 MW capacity. This will reduce the cost per coin mined by around 30%.\nTerraWulf today reported a fully funded 7.9 EH/s expansion, increasing self-mining capacity by 58%. It also highlighted future expansion plans which are likely to bring total operational capacity to ~10 EH/s.\nBit Digital announced to target the doubling of its operating fleet in its Bitcoin mining operations, to around 6.0 EH/s, during 2024. Bitfarms is expected to receive delivery of 35,888 Bitmain T21 miners in 1H24. It has the option to acquire an additional 28,000 Bitmain T21 miners. These expansions could take the company’s operational capacity to 17 EH/s during 2H24.\nBased on data from Blockchain.com, Bitcoin miners’ revenue as of Dec. 28 stood at $46.8 million, the highest in 2023. The revenue has not reached that level since March 2022.\nCrypto quant trader Charles Edwards went on X on Dec. 27, writing , “Bitcoin miners are absolutely printing. With Miner Price at $64K, they are making 50% extra on top of the Bitcoin price.”\nAnother user, cycle forecaster and chartist MortensenBach said , “Bears keep telling me that the miners won’t reach ATH due to share dilution. Let me tell you, when Bitcoin is trading at 100,000-150,000, many of the miners will definitely be at ATH. As an example; In the last bull run $MARA gained 2,500% in 4.5 months from Nov 2020 to March 2021!”\nRead Next: Tired Of Shady Stablecoins?

    "text": "California's first huge swells of the winter are wreaking havoc on the state's coastline as an incoming atmospheric river storm is forcing evacuations amid flooding of beach and coastal roads.\nMarin County residents in the Calles Pinos, Pradero, Sierra, Onda Resaca, Ribera and Embarcadero areas as well as Calle de Arroyo were\nordered to temporarily evacuate Thursday morning due to high risk of wave damage and coastal flooding. Evacuated residents were told to head to the Stinson Beach Community Center.\nSanta Cruz County issued an\nevacuation warning Thursday on X, formerly known as Twitter, for coastal areas near Seacliff State Beach because of flooding.\nWithin the evacuation area, the tourist hot spot known as the Rio del Mar Esplanade is currently flooded with several inches of storm water.\nOn X, the California Highway Patrol cautions that residents avoid the area and not attempt to drive across or through.\nAccording to the\nNational Weather Service's coastal flood warning for the Bay Area, large breaking waves are causing significant flooding of beach and coastal roads. The waves are depositing large amounts of debris and causing road closures.\nThe San Francisco Bay Area coast could see waves up to 40 feet in some locations. The National Weather Service issued a warning for residents to stay away from rocks, jetties, piers and other waterside infrastructure.\nIn Southern California, the waves aren't expected to be as big, but high surf is expected through Saturday, meteorologists said. In Ventura County, waves of up to 12 feet have already been reported, and the Central Coast has seen 18- to 20-foot swells, said Mike Wofford with the National Weather Service's Oxnard office.\nIn a beachside community in Ventura,\nresidents watched as waves washed trash bins away, sending foaming streams of seawater into neighborhood streets.\nA high surf advisory went into effect at 4 a.m. Thursday for Point Conception in Santa Barbara County and Hermosa Beach, Manhattan Beach and Palos Verdes Peninsula beaches in Los Angeles County, all of which can expect sets of 15- to 20-foot waves and dangerous rip currents.\n\"We're expecting the highest waves today to be arriving either late morning or early afternoon and then, maybe some drops in height tomorrow, but still well above normal,\" Wofford said.\nThe waves will pick back up Saturday when another surge of higher swells arrives.\nThere have been\nreally strong storms over the Pacific Ocean that \"we don't necessarily see because they move up to the north or go in some other direction,\" Wofford said.\nWhile the storms are moving through, strong winds can form big waves, which \"propagate out along, and the waves just come barreling right in,\" he said.\nAlong with the high surf advisory, the National Weather Service issued a coastal flood advisory through 10 p.m. Saturday.\nAlthough no structural or road damage is expected, there is an increased risk for drowning, the agency warned. Rip currents can pull swimmers and surfers out to sea, and large breaking waves can cause injuries, wash people off beaches or rocks and capsize small boats.\n\"Never turn your back to the ocean,\" the\nNational Weather Service said on X.\nRain won't be compounding the waves in the Los Angeles County area, as the forecast doesn't call for rain until early Saturday and will continue for most of the day until it tapers off, Wofford said.\nThere's a 30% to 40% chance of rain Sunday into Monday, but it will be in the form of light showers.\n©2023 Los Angeles Times.

    "text": "Il fuoco epifanico sulla spiaggia di Lignano conferma gli auspici: sarà un buon 2024\nLa Foghera, rinviata per la pioggia, è stata realizzata dal gruppo alpini. Acceso anche il falò a Latisanotta visibile dalla strada e dall’argineSara Del Sal\nLIGNANO. Buona la seconda data, sia per Lignano sia per Latisanotta, che si sono trovate costrette a fare slittare di un giorno le loro foghere. Previste infatti per sabato, con Lignano che per la prima volta aveva scelto il giorno dell’Epifania e non il tradizionale pomeriggio del 5, a causa delle previsioni metereologiche che indicavano pioggia forte e vento, sono arrivate nella domenica che ufficialmente ha chiuso le festività.\nUn pomeriggio intero di gioco dedicato ai bambini a Lignano, proprio all’altezza dell’Ufficio 5, ha fatto da apripista all’accensione vera e propria del fuoco epifanico. Alle 18, quindi, sulla spiaggia, a pochi metri dalla Terrazza a Mare illuminata, è stata accesa la Foghera-Pignarûl del gruppo alpini di Lignano creando una suggestione emozionante. Il fumo ha puntato dritto verso Pineta e il “vecchio Venerando” di Lignano ha spiegato al numerosissimo pubblico presente che quando il fumo si dirige a Ovest l’annata che si apre sarà soddisfacente. La passeggiata per raggiungere l’area del fuoco epifanico ha permesso anche un ultimo passaggio per il Villaggio del Gusto che ha saputo accogliere i presenti con infinite proposte. Ora per il Lignano d’A…mare si prosegue con il presepe di sabbia che resterà aperto fino al prossimo 4 febbraio.\nA Latisanotta la festa è partita alle 17 con l’accensione della foghera nel nuovo campo che la rendeva visibile sia dall’argine sia dalla strada. Tante persone hanno voluto riunirsi per lasciarsi incantare dal fuoco, ma anche dallo spettacolo pirotecnico, con una fetta di pinsa e del vin brulé. Il ricavato della manifestazione andrà al progetto “Bolle di Vita” della Croce Rossa",

    "text": "Conheça novo gel que imita pele humana e tem capacidade regenerativa\nO hidrogel tornou-se o primeiro a combinar a rigidez e as propriedades de regeneração da pele humana; entenda como pesquisa foi desenvolvidaUma publicação de pesquisadores da Universidade de Aalto, na Finlândia, e da Universidade de Bayreuth, na Alemanha, apresentou um hidrogel com estrutura capaz de replicar a rigidez e as propriedades de autocura da pele humana.\nO estudo, compartilhado na sexta-feira, 7, no periódico científico Nature Materials, destaca que os hidrogéis sintéticos não mostraram anteriormente as duas combinações ao mesmo tempo.\nÉ + que streaming. É arte, cultura e história.\n“As abordagens atuais de enrijecimento inevitavelmente suprimem a dinâmica de cadeia/ligação necessária para a autocura”, indica o artigo sobre os desafios.\nContudo, a nova proposição superou as limitações prévias ao adicionar “nanofolhas de argila específicas excepcionalmente grandes e ultrafinas aos hidrogéis, que são tipicamente macios e esponjosos”.\nPaís sem borboletas? Estudo indica declínio desses insetos nos EUA | SAIBA MAIS\nNovo gel que imita pele humana: conheça estudo\nO resultado conduz a “uma estrutura altamente ordenada com polímeros densamente emaranhados entre as nanofolhas”. Na prática, além das capacidades mecânicas encontradas no hidrogel, a produção também permite que o material possa ser auto-reparado.\nEm nota, um dos pesquisadores da universidade finlandesa, Hang Zhang, argumenta que “quando os polímeros estão completamente emaranhados, eles são indistinguíveis uns dos outros”.\n“Eles são muito dinâmicos e móveis no nível molecular, e quando você os corta, eles começam a se entrelaçar novamente”, acrescenta.\nMamutes de volta? Empresa cria rato com genes de animais extintos | ENTENDA\nO material, após ser cortado com uma faca, apresentou de 80% a 90% de regeneração cerca de quatro horas depois. Após 24 horas, normalmente estava “completamente reparado”.\nOutro ponto explorado destaca que um hidrogel de um milímetro de espessura contém 10 mil camadas de nanofolhas. Logo, o material seria “tão rígido quanto a pele humana”, oferecendo ainda um “grau comparável de elasticidade e flexibilidade”.\n“Hidrogéis rígidos, fortes e auto-regenerativos têm sido um desafio há muito tempo. Descobrimos um mecanismo para fortalecer os hidrogéis convencionalmente macios”, diz Zhang. “Isso pode revolucionar o desenvolvimento de novos materiais com propriedades bioinspiradas”.\nErupção do Vesúvio formou vidro a partir de cérebro humano; ENTENDA\nFale com a gente",
