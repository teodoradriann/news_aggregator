    "title": "As antisemitism rises, Hanukkah's message of Jewish pride shines brighter than ever",
    "text": "The annual custom and ancient tradition of lighting the Hanukkah menorah takes on profound significance this year as Jewish communities worldwide face rising antisemitism . At the heart of this festival lies a powerful concept, referred to in the ancient Aramaic of the Talmud as pirsumei nisa , the obligation to publicize the miracle. But this commandment extends far beyond simply retelling an ancient story of military victory and miraculous oil that burned eight times longer than it was supposed to. It represents the Jewish people’s enduring mission to serve as a light unto the nations, even in the darkest of times.\nA story that I recently heard while I was on a trip to London beautifully illustrates this principle. A newly converted Jewish woman from Hungary, just three weeks into her Jewish journey, experienced what could have been a threatening moment. She was walking on her way to the synagogue on the first Shabbat after she converted when someone from a passing car rolled down their window and shouted “Jew!” at her. Instead of shrinking in fear, she paused and thought, “Oh yes, I am,” her heart swelling with pride in her new identity. This simple yet profound response embodies the spirit of Hanukkah: standing tall in our Jewish identity, transforming moments of darkness into opportunities for light.\nAnother telling anecdote comes from the former Soviet Union, where hecklers were constantly yelling, “Zhid! Zhid!” (Jew! Jew!) at a Jewish woman. She asked a Chabad rabbi whom she knew and who was more outwardly identifiable as a Jew how he endured constant insults. He told her that he saw such remarks as compliments and that it really didn’t often happen to him, seeing as they probably realized that he wouldn’t be insulted by their words. These stories teach us about the power of unwavering Jewish pride. This attitude doesn’t just deflect hatred — it transforms it.\nThe miracle of Hanukkah isn’t just about the oil that burned for eight days. The true miracle is the survival and thriving of the Jewish people against all odds throughout history. Like the Maccabees who refused to abandon their faith and values in the face of overwhelming pressure to assimilate, today’s Jews proudly continue to kindle their menorahs in windows and public spaces worldwide, declaring their unshakeable commitment to their heritage.\nThere’s a profound lesson in the physics of candlelight that perfectly captures the Jewish approach to spreading light in the world. When you share material possessions, such as apples, even though you are doing something good, you end up with less. But when you use one candle to light another, the original flame isn’t diminished. Instead, the total amount of light in the world increases. This principle perfectly encapsulates the Jewish mission of spreading the miracle. By sharing our light — our values, our wisdom, our kindness — we don’t diminish our own flame; we multiply the light in the world.\nAntisemitism has once again reared its ugly head in universities , streets, and social media, and this is indeed a challenging time in Jewish history, as our people are attacked on all fronts. It is specifically at this time that the message of Hanukkah becomes more relevant than ever. Each menorah lit in a window, each dreidel spun in public, and each proud display of Jewish identity serves as a powerful response to those who would prefer we hide in the shadows.\nThe obligation of spreading the miracle reminds us that our response to hatred and darkness must never be to dim our own light. Instead, we must shine brighter, stand taller, and continue our ancient mission of bringing light to the world. By doing so, we don’t just commemorate an ancient miracle, we become part of the miracle of Jewish survival and the triumph of light over darkness.\nRabbi Dov Ber Cohen is a senior lecturer at the Aish World Center in Jerusalem and founder and director of Living in Tune: Authentic Jewish Mindfulness .",

    "title": "Transition bonds poised to shine: report",
    "text": "Amid hopes that climate “transition bonds” will finally take off this year, the International Capital Market Association (ICMA) has published a new paper on transition finance in the debt markets, highlighting developments that may underpin the market’s growth. According the global industry trade group most recent paper, while the sustainable bond market has largely focused on climate finance, it has not yet been a major source of funding for the transition to a lower-carbon economy in sectors with major abatement challenges — a finding that it attributes primarily to greenwashing fears. Indeed, a recent report from Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC said that market’s growth has been stalled by the lack of a single definition for transition finance, and the absence of widely accepted transition bond principles for issuers to rely on. “This may have disincentivized issuers and investors alike,” it said, noting that issuance has only accounted for about 1% of the overall green and sustainable bond market offerings, since the first transition bond was launched in 2019. However, S&P said it believes transition bonds could have their strongest year ever in 2024. “Transition bonds have the potential to provide access to the sustainable bond market for issuers in sectors that do not generally qualify for green bonds, but still want to reach climate and other environmental goals,” it said. And, in its new paper, the ICMA said the adoption of new reporting standards — including both the initial standards from the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) and the latest European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) — represent an opportunity for companies to pursue transition plans and “the potential to unlock transition finance in the sustainable bond market.” With its paper, the ICMA is also aiming to bring greater clarity to the transition bond market. “Climate transition finance is at the top of the agenda among both policymakers and market participants,” said Nicholas Pfaff, deputy CEO and head of sustainable finance at ICMA, in a release. “We also propose a model structure for integrated transition plans to help unlock further the potential of the sustainable bond market to finance transition especially in the fossil fuel and hard-to-abate sectors,” he added. In its report, S&P said the majority of transition bonds issued to date have come from Japanese companies. “The country is looking to further establish itself as the global leader in transition bond issuance by committing up to US$130 billion of transition bonds in the next decade, including US$11 billion in February 2024,” it noted. To that end, Japan published the world’s first sovereign transition bond framework in November 2023, and the government has published transition roadmaps for several carbon-intensive sectors, “underlining its commitment to tackling the transition for hard-to-abate sectors that have a high dependence on fossil fuels and no simple solutions for reducing emissions,” S&P said.",

    "title": "Putin says Russia has tested new intermediate range missile in strike on Ukraine",
    "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia has tested a new intermediate range missile in a strike on Ukraine on Thursday.\nAnd he warned that Moscow could use it against countries that have allowed Kyiv to use their missiles to strike Russia.\nMr Putin said in a nationwide TV address that the Russian strike on Ukraine came in response to Ukrainian strikes on the Russian territory with US and British missiles earlier this week.\nHe warned that US air defence systems would not be capable of intercepting Russian missiles.\nMr Putin’s announcement came hours after Ukraine claimed that Russia launched an intercontinental ballistic missile overnight at the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro.\nBut American officials said an initial US assessment indicated the strike was carried out with an intermediate-range ballistic missile.\nTwo people were wounded in the attack, and an industrial facility and a rehabilitation centre for people with disabilities were damaged, according to local officials.\nThe attack comes in a week when tensions have repeatedly soared, as the US eased restrictions on Ukraine’s use of American-made longer-range missiles inside Russia and Mr Putin lowered the threshold for launching nuclear weapons.\n“Today, our crazy neighbor once again showed what he really is,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said.\n“And how afraid he is.”\nBallistic missiles can have a range of anywhere from under 300 miles to more than 3,400 miles in the case of intercontinental ones. “Ballistic” refers to the shape of their trajectory.\nThe attack comes during a week of soaring tensions in the war.\nEarlier this week, the Biden administration authorised Ukraine to use US-supplied, longer-range missiles to strike deeper inside Russia — a move that drew an angry response from Moscow.\nDays later, Ukraine fired several of the missiles into Russia, according to the Kremlin.\nThe same day, Mr Putin signed a new doctrine that allows for a potential nuclear response even to a conventional attack on Russia by any nation that is supported by a nuclear power.\nThe doctrine is formulated broadly to avoid a firm commitment to use nuclear weapons. In response, Western countries, including the US, said Russia has used irresponsible nuclear rhetoric and behaviour throughout the war to intimidate Ukraine and other nations.\nThey have also expressed dismay at the deployment of thousands of North Korean troops to Russia to fight against Ukraine.\nAlso on Thursday, Russia struck Mr Zelensky’s home city of Kryvyi Rih, wounding 26 people, said the head of regional administration, Serhii Lysak.\nThe missile strike caused damage to an administrative building, at least five multistory residential buildings, and civilian vehicles.\nThe Russian Defence Ministry, meanwhile, said in a statement that its air defence systems shot down two British-made Storm Shadow missiles, six Himars rockets, and 67 drones.\nMore than 1,000 days into war, Russia has the upper hand, with its larger army advancing in Donetsk and Ukrainian civilians suffering from relentless drone and missile strikes.\nAnalysts and observers say that the loosening of restrictions on Ukraine’s use of Western missiles is unlikely to change the the course of the war, but it puts the Russian army in a more vulnerable position and could complicate the logistics that are crucial in warfare.\nMr Putin has also warned the move would mean that Russia and Nato are at war.\n“It is an important move and it pulls against, undermines the narrative that Putin had been trying to establish that it was fine for Russia to rain down Iranian drones and North Korean missiles on Ukraine but a reckless escalation for Ukraine to use Western-supplied weapons at legitimate targets in Russia,” said Peter Ricketts, a former UK national security adviser who now sits in the House of Lords.",
