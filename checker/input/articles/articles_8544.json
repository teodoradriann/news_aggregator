    "text": "Technology & Science\nGoogle Chrome Users In India Are At High Risk Of Hacking, Indian Government Warns: Here's What You Should Do\nCERT-In has alerted users of Google Chrome for Desktop about vulnerabilities that could lead to hacking risks. These vulnerabilities affect versions prior to 139.0.7258/.128 for Windows and MacOS, and 139.0.7258.127 for Linux.\nThe Indian Computer Emergency Response Team of India (CERT-In) has issued a warning for all Google Chrome for Desktop users, as their PC or laptop is at risk of getting hacked. With the latest vulnerabilities detected in Chrome, the attackers can exploit the system by executing arbitrary code, induce a denial of service attack, or even obtain sensitive information related to the users.\nGoogle Chrome Security Alert\nGoogle Vulnerability Details\nFirst things first, the users should know that the versions affected by the vulnerability are Google Chrome versions prior to 139.0.7258/.128 for Windows and MacOS and Google Chrome versions prior to 139.0.7258.127 for Linux. The target audience for the attack is anyone who possesses any of the mentioned versions of Chrome for Desktop on their system.\nAnd yes, there were a total of five vulnerabilities, out of which three were deemed high risk and the other two possessed medium risk. Google worked with multiple security researchers to identify and remove the vulnerabilities in the system.\nThe risks associated with the same suggest that the attackers can get unauthorised access to the sensitive data of the users, which could ultimately lead to data theft. As mentioned by CERT-In, the user can be persuaded by the attacker to visit a specially crafted request on their PC.\nHow To Stay Safe From The Same?\nYou need to get the stable channel update for both Windows and Mac. As for the Linux version, Google has mentioned in an official blog that the stable update will roll out in the coming days. Apart from that, the users should be alert and identify if there is anything wrong with their system or if it is behaving in a strange way. The best practice will be to set Chrome on your PC to automatic updates so that you can get the new version if and when they launch.\nGet\nLatest Newslive on Times Now along with Breaking News and Top Headlines fromTechnology Scienceand around the world.End Article\nNishit Singh Raghuwanshi author\nA career journalist who spent six years playing around with smartphones, apps and gaming.

    "title": "本港多處沙灘現大量「綠色麵條」 漁護署警告「有毒」：切勿觸碰",
    "text": "近日，香港多個沙灘出現一堆堆「綠色麵條」，其晶瑩剔透的外觀引起網民熱議。然而，這些看似特別的「麵條」背後卻暗藏危機！漁農自然護理署提醒市民，切勿觸碰，以免引致不適。\n沙灘上驚現「綠色麵條」\n早前，有網民在Facebook群組「香港自然生態論壇」上傳了一張攝於欣澳沙灘的「綠色麵條」照片，並留言詢問：「沙灘上見到不少，似麵條，又似粗橡筋繩，是否海洋生物的一種？被沖上砂礫灘邊呢？」。\n網民紛紛猜測\n照片一出，引發網民熱烈討論。有網民發揮創意，留言表示「我以為有人嘔」、「似珍多冰！」、「海龍皇開party，煮緊菠菜麵」，甚至有人開玩笑說「加點醬油，吸一口試試看」。\n真身為「海蛞蝓的卵鞘」\n不過，也有網民認真回應，指出這些「綠色麵條」其實是海蛞蝓的卵鞘，即卵塊。有人留言解釋：「係海兔（sea hare）呀，每年呢個時間香港好多沙灘都會有，佢哋會集體上岸交配產卵，唔係垃圾，唔好錯手執走呀！」另有網民補充，這些卵鞘可能是絲足蠕蟲或海蛞蝓的產物。\n漁護署不建議觸碰：有毒\n漁農自然護理署確實，這些「綠色麵條」真的是海蛞蝓卵鞘，在春季海蛞蝓繁殖期間尤為常見。署方提醒市民，若在野外見到這些卵鞘，不建議觸碰，因為一些海蛞蝓會從食物中攝取有毒物質，並將毒素傳遞到卵鞘中，作為防禦捕食者的手段，觸碰可能會引致不適。\n卵子黏附岩石成「綠色麵條」\n根據漁護署網站介紹，海蛞蝓是一種雌雄同體的海洋生物，包括裸鰓海蛞蝓、海兔、側鰓海蛞蝓等種類。在演化過程中，海蛞蝓的硬殼逐漸退化，甚至完全消失。牠們同時擁有雌性和雄性生殖器官，能夠製造精子和卵子。交配時，一對海蛞蝓會互相貼近，交換精子，並將卵子黏附在堅硬的岩石表面，形成如卷曲絲帶狀的卵子束。",
