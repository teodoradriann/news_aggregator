    "text": "Thousands of homes remain without power as the post-storm cleanup begins in the wake of Storm Gerrit. Around 1,500 homes in Scotland experienced their second night without power in Scotland while a lightning strike hit supplies in Wales on Thursday. Power company Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks said it had restored supply to more than 46,000 properties that lost power due to the storm, with people in the north east and Shetland worst affected. They said the remaining homes should be reconnected on Friday with welfare vans serving hot food and drink to affected customers from 9am. Operations director Andy Smith said: “This has been a difficult couple of days for the communities affected and I’m grateful to them for their patience and support as our teams work extremely hard to restore power.” National Grid UK said 36,000 properties were without power in Ceredigion on Thursday after lightning struck. Three men died after their 4×4 vehicle was submerged in the River Esk, near Glaisdale, on Thursday, North Yorkshire Police said. A supercell thunderstorm moved across the northwest of England on Thursday after a similar storm is thought to have resulted in a tornado that damaged homes in Greater Manchester on Wednesday. Around 100 properties were damaged by what police called a “localised tornado” in Stalybridge, Tameside and in the badly-hit village of Carrbrook. Hayley McCaffer, 40, who lives in Carrbrook, told the PA news agency that some of her neighbours’ houses “are an absolute disaster” with missing roofs and “squished” cars. Damage will be covered by standard property insurance policies, the Association of British Insurers has said. ScotRail said many lines have been reopened but urged passengers to check for the latest information before travelling, a message echoed by LNER, Avanti West Coast and London Northwestern Railway who suspensed or cancelled services due to damage or system faults. Friday will see significant disruption for travellers wishing to travel on the London Euston and Watford Junction lines with services expected to be up and running by the end of the day. In Wales, the aftermath of the recent severe weather will see rail services hampered until Monday. Ferry services also experienced cancellations and delays due to storm activity with operator DFDS confirming sailings between Dover and France were delayed due to strong winds in the English Channel. Air travel in and out of the UK saw cancellations but most services have returned to normal. The Met Office reported the worst of Storm Gerrit had passed with the last few days of 2023 forecast to be unsettled with strong winds, rain and even snow on higher ground. Met Office chief forecaster Steven Ramsdale said: “Heavy rain will spread across all but the far north on Saturday, affecting similar areas previously affected by Storm Gerrit. However, this rainfall will be a step down from that seen during Storm Gerrit.” Comments: Our rules We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

    "text": "Comparte en Twitter Constanza Martínez, delegada presidencial de la Región Metropolitana respondió a las críticas que surgieron por parte del arzobispo de Santiago, Fernando Chomalí, quien respondió un antiguo tuit de la autoridad, en el que aludía a “quemar la Iglesia”.\n“Si quiero prenderle fuego a algo, que sea a la Iglesia y a la Constitución de Pinochet”, fue la frase de Martínez. Frente a lo cual el religioso -cinco años después de la publicación original- respondió: “Dios la bendiga, Constanza”.\nLa delegada asistió este viernes a la actividad de lanzamiento del plan Verano Seguro, donde fue consultada por la interpelación: “Vengo de un ambiente que también es de mucho respeto a las distintas creencias y creo que mis hechos ya han dado cuenta de eso. Un tuit respecto a una canción me parece que no representa lo que he hecho ni lo que soy”.\n“Este es un tuit bien antiguo, de hace 5 años, lo había hablado cuando asumí el cargo hace más de 2 años”, dijo. Y explicó que “hace alusión a una canción de un artista nacional que se llama Alex Andwanter, de una canción que se llama ‘siempre es viernes en mi corazón’, que recomiendo mucho que la escuchen”.\nLa canción “tiene una crítica importante a la política, al congreso y también a las instituciones eclesiásticas respecto al trato que se le ha dado a la población homosexual y de las disidencias sexuales. Por lo tanto, primero, una invitación a todos a que puedan escuchar esa canción. Eso fue en el día en que se declaró inconstitucional la ley que prohibía el lucro en las universidades y en la educación en general, una demanda que varios de nosotros hemos peleado a lo largo de nuestra historia política”.\nLa autoridad fue enfática en señalar que “si ustedes revisan mi experiencia política, lo que he hecho en estos dos años, pero también lo que he hecho en mi experiencia política como dirigente estudiantil, es siempre velar por las manifestaciones pacíficas. Lo he demostrado, he demostrado que no creo en el camino de la violencia y además, tengo un profundo respeto por todas las creencias”.\nLos hechos\nEl recientemente asumido Arzobispo de Santiago,\nFernando Chomalí, respondió a una antigua publicación de la actual delegada presidencial de la Región Metropolitana, Constanza Martínez.\nEl texto de la ahora autoridad corresponde a 2018, donde alude a quemar la Iglesia y la actual Constitución.\n“Si quiero prenderle fuego a algo, que sea a la Iglesia y a la Constitución de Pinochet #TC #lucro”, señaló la abogada y exdirigenta estudiantil en dicha oportunidad.\nCinco años después y el pasado lunes, el actual Arzobispo de Santiago le respondió: “Dios la bendiga, Constanza”.",

    "title": "Advocates urge Court to end hair discrimination in Texas schools",
    "text": "Allies file amicus brief in support of students deprived of education due to hair length Today, a multiracial, intergenerational coalition of advocates filed a friend-of-the-court brief urging a Texas appellate court to end a Houston-area school district’s years-long practice of discriminating against Black students wearing racially and culturally significant hairstyles. The brief, filed in support of the George family in George v. Barbers Hill Independent School District , urged the court to uphold the Texas CROWN Act and protect students from the severe harms caused by discriminatory policing of students’ dress and grooming.\nThe brief was filed by Black Parents and Families Collective, National Congress of American Indians, Students Engaged in Advancing Texas, Texas NAACP, the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas, and IDRA, represented by counsel at the Native American Rights Fund, ACLU of Texas, and IDRA, in the First Court of Appeals in Texas.\nThe brief advocates for Darryl George, a Black Texas high school student unlawfully denied access to public education because of the length of his hair, which he wears in locs. “This Court can and must put an end to this unnecessary and painful litigation – initiated by a school district against a minor child,” the brief states.\nBarbers Hill ISD suspended George for having long hair, which violates Texas law. The 2023 Texas CROWN Act prohibits public school districts from discriminating against hair textures and protective hairstyles commonly or historically associated with race and was enacted to allow students to express their cultural identities through their hair.\nThe brief provides critical context for the court to properly interpret and enforce the Texas CROWN Act, offering a historical and sociolegal analysis of the significance of protecting hair length to realize the statute’s purpose.\n“Scholars and the courts have expressly recognized that long hairstyles are common expressions of racial and cultural identity, and the Texas Legislature enacted the CROWN Act to prohibit discrimination against them,” said IDRA Chief Legal Analyst Paige Duggins-Clay. “Any interpretation of the Texas CROWN Act that would permit the destruction of long protective styles would thwart the Act’s inherent purpose and legislative intent.”\nBlack students often wear protective hairstyles such as locs, braids, Bantu knots, and twists to maintain healthy natural hair and celebrate their cultural identity. The brief demonstrates that leaving one’s hair uncut is historically associated with ancestral connection, cultural identity, and spiritual strength in many African and Indigenous communities.\n“Neither Darryl George, nor any student, should ever have their education disrupted because of the way they wear their hair,” said ACLU of Texas Staff Attorney Chloe Kempf. “The CROWN Act exists to protect Black, Indigenous, and other students of color from discrimination, and we urge the court to fully enforce this law. All students must feel free to express themselves and their cultural and family backgrounds in school.”\nMany Black and Indigenous students wear long hair as a form of spiritual protection and symbol of moral strength and cultural pride. Indigenous students also often need their hair to remain long enough to wear items of regalia in cultural and religious ceremonies.\n“Hair length rules force Native students to violate tenets of their religious and cultural beliefs in order to receive a public education. While cultural practices vary, many Native peoples regard hair as akin to an appendage, a visible expression of spiritual protection and cultural belonging, and only cut their hair under specific circumstances,” said NARF Legal Fellow Malia Gesuale . “Indian boarding schools once cut Native boys’ hair to prevent their students from practicing these beliefs and connecting with their Native culture. Then and now, no student should be targeted by their educators because of their hair.”\nIn addition to the Texas CROWN Act, the First and Fourteenth Amendments afford students protections against dress and grooming codes that violate their rights to liberty, equal treatment, freedom of religion, and freedom of expression. Courts have also affirmed that parents have the right to direct the upbringing of their child, including in religious, cultural, and health practices related to hairstyle and hair length. In Texas and across the country, federal courts have ruled that school children’s rights to free speech, free exercise of religion, and an educational environment free from race and gender discrimination allow them to wear long hair, and other culturally significant hair styles, in school.\nMore about NARF’s work around the CROWN Act .",
