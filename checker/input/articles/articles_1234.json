    "text": "We all have ups and downs, At first glance, it may seem other people live a much happier life than we do. But nobody knows how much time and effort it takes for other people to get a successful job or build a happy family. It’s pointless to compare ourselves to others because you never know what you go through to get the same result. The desire to compare ourselves with someone else is a normal function of the brain. It makes it easier to determine our significance and motivates us to self-development. However, comparing yourself to others can be harmful , especially if you have low self-esteem.[[[replace_first_article_add_2]]] RELATED: 21 Ways To Build Self-Esteem & Uplift Your Confidence Here are eight useful things to do instead of comparing yourself to others. 1. Focus on your strengths. No matter what we achieve, it's natural to feel victory and a sense of failure, at the same time. After all, there are always examples of successful people on social networks who have achieved more and do not look tired in the photo while you're exhausted. Because of this, it may appear an illusion that self-improvement is necessary, as it's aimed to help us overcome weaknesses. As a result, people stop doing what they are good at and focus on endless self-improvement. There are only 24 hours in a day to be successful, and we need to prioritize achieving our goals. You should stop focusing on others because you drastically reduce your chances of success if you spend time focusing on your weaknesses. Therefore, you need to focus on your strengths , not your weaknesses, to reach your full potential.[[[replace_first_article_add_1]]] 2. Learn to love yourself. Your life is formed by what you do. If you work at a boring job, live with the wrong person, and regret spending money on yourself while making sacrifices for others — this is not from kindness but low self-esteem. You need to understand a simple thing. It’s natural to love yourself unconditionally. A person with healthy self-esteem does not look for explanations and does not say there is no way out. If you don't compare yourself to anyone , you're focused on yourself — it's not about being selfish. People with high self-evaluation feelings do what they want and are not afraid of the consequences. They live the way they like and do what they love. If they are married, it’s exclusively for love. And if love is gone, they get divorced. Loving yourself is the ability to live the way you want. If we care about ourselves, we don’t compare ourselves with others.

When you look at other people's accomplishments and don't feel anything except envy, you are just wasting time. Instead of just dreaming about a new life, use this time to reevaluate your goals. It would be best if you never compare yourself to others in terms that you're not lucky. If you want to live differently, you first need to understand how to achieve this and avoid self-doubt . Ask yourself, \\\"What do I want?\\\" The next step is to collect information, decide what needs to be changed, and do it. This will make you feel like you are in control of your life. And you will not have time to be concerned about someone else's life. 4. Remember your uniqueness. People are unique when they act outside common patterns, stereotypes, rules, and norms . The key to not comparing yourself to others is there. A child shows their uniqueness, then tries to be like everyone else and begins to hide it diligently when it doesn't work out. As a result, adults comply with the norms and rules, although they would like to live differently and engage in entirely different tasks. An excellent and non-traumatic way to find your uniqueness is a hobby. You need to specify what you would like to do. Often, a hobby develops into full-time employment. The main rule is not to make theoretical discussions but to start. Self-love is not a one-time practice, you must practice it every day.

Social media gives you updates from friends and acquaintances, photos of achievements, and other happy moments. It isn't easy to understand how to stop comparing yourself to others physically or by other parameters in such conditions. Because of this, it seems that others’ lives are continuously positive while yours is nothing outstanding. But happy pictures from social networks reflect the situation on the surface. They do not show the colossal work behind it. So, social media detox is essential. One more answer to how to stop comparing your life to others is to spend time and energy thinking about what you have. You should be busy with family, friends, work, and all the things that matter in your life. Then, you will simply no longer need to compare yourself. Photo: Pablo Calvog via Shutterstock 6. Control your thoughts. As you know, where thought goes, energy flows. If thought reacts to the surrounding signals, then a negative, grumpy, critical thought is dramatized. You can't stop thinking, but you should change your thinking process . The first step is to face reality and make a statement, \\\"I compare myself to a thing.\\\" The next step is to change the situation. If you deny the fact and are afraid to face reality, you can't move forward. Switch your attention from negative thoughts to positive ones. At first, it won't be easy. But over time, you form a new habit. It is believed that it takes 21 days to create a new stable pattern . So why not do an experiment that promises a qualitative change in life?

It is normal to worry about a crisis, virus, job change, or home situation. But it's not OK to worry someone else has a more exciting and colorful life. This approach does not solve the problem because nothing changes in your life; only negative things are added. It would be best if you first calm your mind and learn to perceive the success of others evenly. Then, try meditation, breathing exercises , light sports, creativity, and find your method of calming the brain. RELATED: 8 Ways To Immediately Stop Anxiety From Sucking The Life Out Of You 8. Learn to accept your flaws. If you think about what to say to someone who compares themselves to others, there is one more great hint. No one is perfect, yet it is common for most to strive for this imaginary ideal. There are many reasons for this, and the roots of the problem are in childhood and the education system. But even grown-ups very often don't accept themselves. As a result, a person develops toxic shame. When you learn to accept your shortcomings, you will know what it is like to be satisfied with yourself and calmly move forward. You will stop comparing yourself to the success of others, and you will no longer feel doubt about yourself and your achievements.

    "title": "My ‘Swiftie Dad’ moment was a window into the Creator Era",
    "text": "By Ben Gunn, co-founder and chief revenue officer at [Fabulate](https://www.fabulate.com.au) I took my 13-year-old daughter to one of Taylor Swift’s Sydney concerts. The Swift pandemonium didn’t just mark a kind of pop culture milestone I have never experienced; it signified the dawn of a new era in media — the Creator Era. In this era, traditional institutions take a backseat as digitally native individuals, known as creators, forge direct connections with their audiences across various media channels. Swift is ultimately a creator, a brand. And the value of that brand has exploded, as she has had an astronomical rise as a central figure in culture, even being recognised as TIME Magazine’s 2023 Person of the Year. An RMIT professor has been quoted as saying that the [concerts across Sydney and Melbourne have injected $558M+ into the economy](http://www.forbes.com.au/life/entertainment/taylor-swift-australian-eras-tour-sparks-558m-economy-boost). Taylor Swift’s ability to transcend traditional boundaries and connect directly with fans epitomises the essence of the Creator Era. Events and moments like what we have experienced over the last couple of weeks highlight the evolving landscape: traditional media institutions face mounting challenges while new paradigms emerge. Creators across platforms like TikTok, Instagram and YouTube are redefining the media value chain. The traditional media model of bundling content shifted to unbundling, with the launch of players like Google and Facebook about 20 years ago, but we are now moving towards rebundling, driven by the influence of creators. These individuals wield immense power, shaping culture, commerce, and community through their authentic engagement with audiences. Swift’s journey illustrates the transformative potential of creators. From breaking the mould as a young songwriter in Nashville to breaking through as a global superstar, her success demonstrates how creators are disrupting industries and rewriting the rules of engagement. By leveraging their unique voice and vision, creators like Taylor Swift can shape consumer behaviour and preferences, exerting influence across various platforms and industries. The [value these creators can bring to brands is phenomenal](https://www.mediaweek.com.au/taylor-swift-mediaweek-look-at-brands-on-the-swiftie-bandwagon/). Think of the visitors Sydney Zoo will now see off the back of Taylor Swift visiting that destination twice last week. The media value was calculated to be in the hundreds of millions and we saw [creators jumping on it too](https://www.tiktok.com/@sussan_mourad/video/7338143641791188266?lang=en&q=taylor%20swift%20zoo&t=1708927303357). In this new media landscape, streaming TV, professional sports, physical stores, TikTok, and creators themselves emerge as the new centres of the media universe. Brands and marketers must adapt to this shifting landscape by embracing the power of creators and understanding their pivotal role in shaping the future of marketing. To thrive in the Creator Era, marketers need to rethink their strategies and embrace authenticity, creativity, and community-driven engagement. Collaborating with creators who resonate with their target audience can provide brands with unparalleled access and credibility. And by harnessing the influence of creators, brands can amplify their message, drive engagement, and foster meaningful connections with consumers. As we navigate this Creator Era, embracing the power of creators will be essential for brands looking to stay relevant and resonate with today’s digital-savvy consumers.",

    "title": "Investors bet on three rate cuts this year as the UK economy tips into recession | Express Digest",
    "text": "Investors are betting on three interest rate cuts in the UK this year after the economy tipped into recession. At the end of a week of crucial economic data, the Bank of England is now expected to lower headline borrowing costs from 5.25 per cent to 4.5 per cent by Christmas. The timing of the first move remains uncertain, with bets on financial markets suggesting a 20 per cent chance it will come in May, 60 per cent in June and 80 per cent in August. The pound fell to $1.2591 and €1.1696, while gilt yields dipped on the bond markets as investors ramped up bets on rate cuts. Thomas Pugh, UK economist at consultant RSM UK, said: ‘A recession gives the Bank more cover to pivot towards cutting interest rates as early as the spring.’ Recession: At the end of a week of crucial economic data, the Bank of England is now expected to lower headline borrowing costs from 5.25% to 4.5% by Christmas Megan Greene, who sits on the Bank of England’s rate-setting monetary policy committee (MPC), said she needs to see more evidence that inflation is returning to target before voting for rate cuts. The economist, who until this month was voting to raise rates, said they will need to ‘remain restrictive for some time for inflation to sustainably return’ to 2 per cent. Expectations are likely to shift again, however, after wild swings this week as investors grappled with a flurry of official figures. On Tuesday, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) revealed that wages are rising at a faster-than-anticipated 6.2 per cent year-on-year, fuelling fears that pay growth is too strong for the Bank of England to cut interest rates soon. And data in the United States showed inflation in the world’s biggest economy running ‘hot’ at 3.1 per cent– dashing hopes of an early rate cut by the Federal Reserve. However, a UK rate cut this spring or early summer seemed possible again on Wednesday when the ONS said that inflation had held firm at 4 per cent in January – bucking expectations of a rise. And pressure mounted on the Bank yesterday after the ONS said the economy shrank by 0.3 per cent in the final three months of 2023, meaning that the UK is in recession following a contraction of 0.1 per cent in the previous quarter. The figures will be pored over by the MPC as it weighs up when and if rate cuts are appropriate. Julian Jessop, economics fellow at the Institute of Economic Affairs, said: ‘The MPC’s job is to worry about inflation, not growth, but the case for early rate cuts is now even stronger.’ And Nicholas Hyett, an investment analyst at Wealth Club, said: ‘With inflation lower than expected this week, the news that the UK is in recession will lead to growing pressure for the Bank of England to cut interest rates. ‘But while recession is clearly bad news for the UK economy, it’s worth bearing in mind that, as recessions go, this is still a very mild one and might yet get revised out of existence altogether. ‘Whether today’s recession transforms into something that’s remembered outside the pages of an economic history textbook remains to be seen.’ *** [Read more at DailyMail.co.uk](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/markets/article-13089179/Investors-bet-three-rate-cuts-year-UK-economy-tips-recession.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490)",

    "title": "The first startup to receive carbon credits in Europe plans to plant 2 million trees by this summer. of trees per year | Commercial activity",
    "text": "Hold.earth, an emissions offsetting start-up that helps companies offset CO2 emissions through sustainable forest restoration projects, received its first carbon credits for a forestry project a few months ago in Lithuania . This recognition indicates that the company is in the top 1%. of all green projects certified in Europe in the forestry projects category. High-quality certified carbon credits are provided by the Open Forest Protocol platform, known for its stringent requirements.\nIn recent years the startup, in collaboration with several companies, has planted more than 50 hectares of new forests in Lithuania, which comply with local environmental regulations and are registered on the Open Forest Protocol platform. According to Greta Šidlauskienė, co-founder and head of the startup, the granted carbon credits will allow the company to expand into new markets and will help companies around the world obtain certified carbon credits that meet the strict standards of the Open Forest Protocol.\n“This certificate is the result of three years, which we achieved by implementing continuous monitoring and reporting methods in our projects, monitoring tree growth, survival rates, biomass and soil carbon levels,” says G. Šidlauskienė. – Our goal is to plant at least 100 hectares of new forests every year and actively expand the scope of project certification. Until 2050 we will aim to offset 10 million tonnes of carbon every year, which means we will plant more than 2 million trees per year.”\nThe startup works with large and medium-sized companies in the industrial, logistics and energy sectors looking to reduce their carbon footprint and implement sustainable climate solutions. During the project, all responsibility for forest management lies with the startup and companies engage in the project by participating in team-level training events, receiving certified carbon credits and reputational benefits, and having a real impact on the environment.\nThe Swiss Open Forest Protocol platform validates and issues carbon credits. To be certified, the project must last at least 40 years and the developer must be entitled to land ownership and carbon credits for the life of the project. At the request of the certifying authority, local plant species must be planted during the projects, avoiding plantations of the same species, and the trees must be adequately distributed throughout the project field. It can take up to three years to prepare a project to Open Forest Protocol standards, three months to obtain a certificate and 12 months to generate credits.\nCredible solutions for offsetting carbon emissions are still lacking The carbon offsetting credit system works according to a simple principle: every ton of CO2 released into the environment must be offset with the corresponding number of carbon credits. Offsetting is done by planting trees or locking up blue carbon in the ocean or coastal ecosystems. However, according to G. Šidlauskienė, there is still a lack of reliable solutions that can actually help compensate for exhaust gases.\n“Companies often cannot provide accurate compensation data because the projects are not viable or long-term. Therefore, investments in unproven carbon offsetting initiatives are not sustainable. Certified projects represent only about 20-30% . global reforestation and restoration initiatives. Certification ensures sustainability, biodiversity and carbon sequestration,” says the company head.\nAlthough Europe generates a smaller share of certified projects than Africa or Latin America, the quality of the initiatives themselves is significantly higher. In Europe, carbon credit prices are higher than the global average and range from 30 euros per ton. The price is determined by stricter legislation, high environmental standards and high business demand. According to G. Šidlauskienė, prices will increase in the future due to the entry into force of EU regulations and the growing desire of companies to achieve carbon neutrality goals. Currently, the price of credits for the company’s projects is around 36 euros per tonne/one carbon dioxide credit.\nHowever, although such initiatives and their real impact on the environment are often viewed with skepticism due to a lack of transparency and various examples of “greenwashing” projects in Africa and Latin America, companies are increasingly taking on social and environmental responsibilities . This is also confirmed by the startup’s growing customer base – 100% fixed from 2022. customer growth.\n“From 2022 until 2024 sales of afforestation projects have increased significantly. Businesses are looking for reliable investment opportunities and we are opening up a whole new market for quality credit in Europe. Although we manage projects from start to finish, we allow the company to be actively involved in the entire planting process and make sure that the forest not only grows, but is maintained for many years to come.\nTherefore, in the coming years we intend to carry out new reforestation projects and implement the latest monitoring technologies, – says the startup’s manager. “Additionally, as a strategic partner of the Open Forest Protocol platform, we will search for suitable land in Europe for forestry projects and certifications, thus expanding the network of sustainable projects across the region.”\nwindow.fbAsyncInit = function() {\nFB.init({\nappId: ‘117218911630016’,\nversion: ‘v2.10’,\nstatus: true,\ncookie: false,\nxfbml: true\n});\n};\n(function(d, s, id) {\nvar js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\nif (d.getElementById(id)) {\nreturn;\n}\njs = d.createElement(s);\njs.id = id;\njs.src = “https://connect.facebook.net/lt_LT/sdk.js”;\nfjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);\n}(document, ‘script’, ‘facebook-jssdk’));\n#startup #receive #carbon #credits #Europe #plans #plant #million #trees #summer #trees #year #Commercial #activity\n2024-10-03 23:34:07",

    "text": "Al Nolen spoke from a place of empathy during the radio broadcast of the Gophers men’s basketball game on Dec. 12.\nGophers sophomore guard Braeden Carrington had stepped away from the program earlier that day to address his mental health. And just after tipoff, Nolen, the new KFAN analyst, briefly shared his own struggles playing for the Gophers from 2007-11.\n“It was just being in a dark space,” Nolen later described to the Pioneer Press in a Dec. 15 interview.\nNolen said his issues came to a head during his sophomore season in 2008-09, when he felt acute pressure of being a Minnesotan playing for the home-state Big Ten school.\n“People want to see you do well, obviously,” said Nolen, who attended Patrick Henry High School in Minneapolis. “But at the same time, they have a standard for you and what they want out of you as a Division I athlete.”\nGophers men’s basketball coach Ben Johnson has been sympathetic and supportive to Carrington’s situation, granting him the space he needs.\nOn Wednesday, Johnson said Carrington has returned to practice. Carrington won’t play in the final nonconference game against Maine on Friday, but might play when Big Ten play resumes at Michigan next Thursday.\nFor Nolen, his struggles continued into his junior year when he was ruled academically ineligible halfway through the season. The team knew well before the public, he said.\n“It was a very unfortunate situation,” Nolen said. “However, I was able to learn from it. It was extremely tough. I had a lot of fans saying nasty stuff to me on social media and different things of that nature.\n“So I disabled my social medias, and stopped looking at all those different things. I just kind of isolated myself on campus. I felt bad and just had a lot of negative energy.”\nCarrington’s story also has had social media implications.\nLast weekend, Pioneer Press columnist Charley Walters wrote: “People close to the Gophers will be surprised if … Carrington … doesn’t enter the NCAA transfer portal.”\nWalters’ sourced speculation was then construed by Gopher Hole into it being an intention by Carrrington. The blog and message board altered Walters’ reporting to say: “Carrington expected to hit the transfer portal.”\nReaction to Gopher Hole’s post reached Johnson on Tuesday — soon after he had met with Carrington. Carrington was “glowing,” Johnson relayed, when the Brooklyn Park guard said he was ready to rejoin the team.\n“It’s disappointing that some people ran with a narrative that is not fair to that kid,” Johnson said Thursday. “I don’t want to get on a big soap box, but I feel like you’ve got to stand up for your guys when you need to stand up for your guys.”\nJohnson said Carrington has done “everything right” on and off the court and came to the practice facility “every day” during his respite.\n“However that (report) got out by whoever — it couldn’t be farther from the truth for a kid that could have left last year and didn’t and stuck with it,” Johnson said. “… When I first got the job, he was the first guy that committed to me and has shown unbelievable loyalty to myself and the program, for that to even remotely come out is just not fair to him.\n“It bothered him ‘cause he cares.”\nIn Nolen’s situation, he thought about transferring and even sat down with an assistant coach to talk about it. Academic ineligibility stood in his way, he said.\n“I was ready to go,” Nolen recalled. “I wanted a new start. I wanted somewhere fresh.”\nNolen’s mother counseled him into finishing what he started with the Gophers, and Al came back for his senior season. In one game in 2010-11, Nolen was at the free-throw line when he recalled hearing a chant: “Go to class!”\nThat January, he broke a bone in his right foot and was done for the year. Amid that setback, Nolen’s improved mental health aided him.\n“I was OK with that because I said I put my all into getting back into the sport,” Nolen said. “Breaking your foot, or getting an injury or something, is out of your control.”\nNolen, who credited teammates, coaches and support staff for helping him feel better, played in the NBA’s minor league and abroad in Europe after college. He returned to Minnesota to complete the six final credits needed for graduation. He has since started the Al Nolen Foundation to help at-risk youth in underprivileged communities.\nAfter stepping away from sports with his career, Nolen is moonlighting in his first year as radio analyst next to play-by-play commentator Mike Grimm.\n“I love it so much,” Nolen said of his radio gig. “I focused on different things, but to be sort of back engulfed in sports and have a job talking about the Gophers, I love it.”",
