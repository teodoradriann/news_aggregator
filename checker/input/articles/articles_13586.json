    "title": "Hamid Ansari backstabbed India, romanced with Pakistani and Iranian spy agencies",
    "text": "Hamid Ansari, former vice president of India though is known for his notorious role of leaking secret information to Iranian intelligence and taking Iran’s side on a number of issues defying India’s stands, Indians are yet to know lots of his secrets that would place him amongst the top enemies of the country. Before digging into his dark secrets, let us first recall some of the disturbing facts. As a scholar, Hamid Ansari has taken positions inconvenient to the India’s official line on Iraq and Iran. He has questioned India’s vote in the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on Iran’s nuclear program, where New Delhi voted against Tehran. He said that though the Indian government claimed to have acted on “its own judgement”, this was not borne out by facts. Ansari has been accused of inviting Nusrat Mirza, a Pakistani spy agency ISI’s deep-cover agent working as journalist to travel to India – five times during 2005-2011, although he dismissed the accusations as “litany of falsehood” and claimed to have never met or invited him. But Ansari was proven to be a damn liar when Nusrat Mirza himself told the media that he met Hamid Ansari several times and shared many sensitive and highly-classified information. During his stay in Afghanistan as India’s ambassador, Hamid Ansari was frequently visiting Pakistan – meeting key figures in Pakistani ISI and even held secret meetings with anti-India terrorists in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK). According to credible sources, Ansari, despite being Indian envoy, was actively working against the country and was also sharing intelligence secrets with Pakistani ISI. There also are serious allegations against Hamid Ansari during his tenure as Indian ambassador to Iran during 1990-1992. According to an ex-Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) officer NK Sood, Hamid Ansari had a crucial hand in the exposure of many field agents in the Tehran setup. This had left the lives of these agents in grave danger. NK Sood in his 2019 tweet stated , “I was in Tehran; Iran. Hamid Ansari was the ambassador in Tehran. Ansari had played a crucial role in exposing RAW set-up in Tehran endangering lives of RAW unit members. But this very man was made Vice President for two consecutive terms”. Sood also called for a detailed enquiry into the Ansari’s activities during the Tehran tenure and the latter’s damage to RAW. Later in a letter to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, NK Sood stated, [Hamid Ansari], while being posted in Tehran, “not only failed to protect India’s national interest, but cooperated with the Iranian government and its intelligence agency SAVAK to cause serious dent to R&AW and its operations. According to Sood, there were four major incidents when Indian Embassy officials, diplomats were kidnapped by SAVAK and Ansari deliberately failed in his duties to protect India’s interest. In an interview to The Sunday Guardian, NK Soon said, “In May 1991, one Indian official, Sandeep Kapoor, was kidnapped from the Tehran airport, ostensibly by SAVAK. When the issue was brought before Ansari, he played it down despite the R&AW station chief—who was in Dubai when the incident took place, but flew back considering the emergency situation – briefing him personally on the matter. “Ansari did not take any steps to trace Kapoor, but sent a confidential report to the MEA that Kapoor was missing and that his activities were suspected in Iran as he was said to be involved with some local woman. He deliberately failed to mention that R&AW had reported about involvement of SAVAK in this case”. Three days later, an anonymous phone call to the Indian Embassy informed the receiver that Kapoor was lying at a particular place on the road side. He was drugged, the effects of which lasted for several years. Despite R&AW’s advice to report and lodge a protest with the Iranian foreign office, Ansari did not take any action. In August 1991, R&AW was keeping eyes on Kashmiri youths who were regularly visiting Qom, a religious center of Iran, and were taking arms training. Despite the old R&AW staff advising him not to do so, the new station chief of R&AW told Ansari about his operation. “Ansari gave the name of the officer who was handling this operation, D.B. Mathur, to the Iranian Foreign office, who passed it to SAVAK, and Mathur was picked up by them on a morning while coming to the Indian embassy. By the evening, it was clear that he had been picked up by SAVAK”. When Hamid Ansari refused to take any concrete action, apart from registering a missing report about Mathur with the Iranian Foreign office and sharing it with Delhi without mentioning that he was likely to be picked by SAVAK, the R&AW officers, on the second day, through a scene out of a spy movie, managed to inform Atal Bihari Vajpayee in Delhi, who then told this to P.V. Narasimha Rao, the then Prime Minister, led to the release of Mathur from Evin prison, where he was kept, on the fourth day of his kidnapping, but he was given 72 hours to leave the country. Once inside the Indian Embassy, Mathur disclosed what had happened to him and how the SAVAK was already aware of the identity of NK Sood and the station chief. According to another report published in OpIndia, NK Soon even alleged that Hamid Ansari teamed up with Ratan Sehgal, Additional Secretary in the IB to destroy Gulf units of the RAW prior to 1992 Bombay blasts. [OpIndia editor’s note: He perhaps meant 1993 blasts, but mistakenly tweeted the wrong year]. NK Sood in a tweet https://x.com/rawnksood/status/1147109495551565825?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1147109495551565825%7Ctwgr%5E11b16df25483d09bfb11416e701a8b21903cf54b%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.opindia.com%2F2019%2F07%2Fhamid-ansari-raw-officer-tehran-iran%2F, “Ratan. Sehgal was Addl. Secretary in IB n he was later found to be working for CIA and held passing on documents to a CIA lady agent in Delhi. He should have been arrested; jailed and dismissed. But was asked to resign and allowed to go. Now he is settled in the US”. Meanwhile, on condition of anonymity, an intelligence official said, as Pakistani ISI was aware of Hamid Ansari’s anti-Hindu mindset, it has taken full advantage of it during Ansari’s stay in Afghanistan and Iran, in extracting several key-information centering India’s military strategies as well as its counterterrorism measures particularly in the Jammu and Kashmir. It further said, even after becoming vice president of India, Hamid Ansari was maintaining connections with Iranian and Pakistani intelligence officials thus causing unimaginable damage to India’s national interest.",

    "title": "How This Entrepreneur Balances Multiple Income Streams Working 10 Hours a Week",
    "text": "Grace Ryu is a 23-year-old entrepreneur based in Houston. She quit a job in the tech industry to focus on creating streams of mostly passive income. Find Out: How To Earn $4,000 a Month in Passive Income Read More: 6 Unusual Ways To Make Extra Money (That Actually Work) The results have been great, according to Ryu, who says she now earns six figures working just 10 hours a week. Here’s a look at her many income streams and how she manages them. Sponsored: Protect Your Wealth With A Gold IRA. Take advantage of the timeless appeal of gold in a Gold IRA recommended by Sean Hannity. How Ryu Earns Money Ryu says she currently has eight income streams. She earns over six figures annually through the following hustles: Her luxury picnic business Social media brand deals Affiliate marketing User-generated content Pet sitting Airbnb arbitrage Selling digital products Nannying Ryu estimates she spends an average of just 10 hours on all eight of these jobs combined. So how does she do it? Breaking Down Grace Ryu’s Strategy You need great time management skills to work as many jobs as Ryu has. But there are also only so many hours in a week. So, Ryu uses a few really smart strategies to make her lifestyle possible. More Work Upfront First, it’s important to recognize that Ryu’s 10-hour work week is the end product of a lot of upfront work. For example, she only spends about an hour on her luxury picnic business weekly. But that’s only possible because she has a team of employees that can handle events independently now. Before reaching this stage, Ryu says she and her partners reinvested all of their profits into the business. They also had to build a name for themselves over time and did so through labor-intensive advertising like posting flyers around their high school and town. Similarly, Ryu earns passive income by selling digital products like her e-book. This requires no weekly work but took her time to write. This just shows that although you can reach a 10-hour work week, you’ll likely need to work significantly more than that for a while before you get there. The Power of a Social Following Ryu calls herself a micro-influencer on TikTok, where she posts about her life and financial strategies. She also leverages her following to earn more income. For example, Ryu partners with brands to promote products on her TikTok page. She says she used to make content for brands for free, but now charges at least $1,000 per post. Ryu also earns income through affiliate marketing deals. She creates social media content that features products, which she includes links to in her posts. When a follower clicks on the link and buys the product, she gets a percentage of their purchase through Amazon’s influencer program. Ryu says she earns $500 to $2,000 monthly from this. She also makes $6,000 to $8,000 per month creating user-generated content, which is often social posts that brands share directly on their pages. These strategies each reveal how your income-earning potential increases after you’ve built a social following. Ryu even sells digital content like her e-book through her social media posts. Once you have an audience, you can monetize it in many different ways. Jobs With Downtime Ryu also chooses some jobs because of the built-in downtime they have. For example, she started pet-sitting while working remotely in the tech industry. During that time, she was getting paid for her day job and her side gig during the same hours. Nannying is another job Ryu has that fits this mold. She does it three or four times per year for a family in New York that pays her $1,200 weekly. Ryu has much of the day to herself while the children she watches are at school and uses those hours to make more money. Applying Ryu’s Ideas to Your Life Grace Ryu has gone all-in on diversifying her income with work she can do in just 10 hours a week. You may not want to go as far as she does. But there are still some takeaways from her lifestyle that can help you get ahead on your financial goals. Think Low Maintenance, Not Low Barrier to Entry Ryu looks for opportunities that will generate income without much ongoing work, even if they take some significant time to set up. You see this in the e-books she sells, her luxury picnic business and her social following. Each took time and effort to create but now let her earn money with minimal weekly work. These kinds of jobs are what make it possible to earn a lot of money without much work. Focus On Your Strengths It’s also important to focus on your strengths when looking for passive income opportunities. Ryu enjoyed social media, got good at it, and then turned her following into a business. She’s also a great writer and decided to turn that skill into income by writing e-books. Whether you’re great at working on cars or love to play music, there’s often a way to turn your passion into money. Keep Your Eyes Open Finally, Ryu’s story is a good reminder to always keep your eyes open for new side hustles. If she had settled at just pet-sitting while working her tech job, Ryu would never have gotten to the point of earning six figures in 10 hours a week. It’s a reminder that you have to keep looking for opportunities if you want to continue improving your financial situation. The Bottom Line There have never been more ways to earn passive income. Ryu’s story shows us how far you can take these opportunities to improve your quality of life. Just make sure you allocate the passive income you generate effectively, with regular contributions to your retirement accounts. The best way to make sure your money always goes where it should is to create a budget.

    "text": "Wisconsin squeaks past Minnesota for the top spot in voter turnout\n“In a heartbreakingly close contest, Minnesota lost the title of number one in voter turnout to Wisconsin for the 2024 election,” said Secretary of State Steve Simon\nST. PAUL — In the race between Gophers and Badgers for voter turnout, the Badgers won.\nVoters in Wisconsin narrowly outperformed Minnesota voters in the 2024 election. The University of Florida’s Election Lab\nreported\nthat 76.35% of the voting-eligible population cast ballots in Minnesota. In Wisconsin, 76.64% of the voting-eligible population cast ballots.\nADVERTISEMENT\nSecretary of State Steve Simon regularly touts Minnesota’s long-running first-place voter turnout position. And he said while turnout was strong in the 2024 general election, it came up just a little bit short.\n“In a heartbreakingly close contest, Minnesota lost the title of number one in voter turnout to Wisconsin for the 2024 election,” he said in a statement. “We congratulate our neighbors to the east on this victory and we’ll continue our work to earn the top spot back in 2026.”\nWisconsin was one of a handful of battleground states in last year’s presidential election. Campaigns spent tens of millions of dollars in Wisconsin, and voters sent a mixed message back by reelecting Republican President Donald Trump and Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin.\nMinnesota stayed in the Democratic column. Former Vice President Kamala Harris won the presidential vote in Minnesota with Gov. Tim Walz on the ticket. DFL Sen. Amy Klobuchar easily defeated her Republican opponent.\nThis story was originally published on MPRNews.org\n_________________________________________________",
