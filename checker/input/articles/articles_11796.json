    "text": "As emergências adulto e pediátrica do Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre vão operar com restrição de 13 de janeiro a 17 de março de 2025 para execução de obras estruturais urgentes . Durante esse período, todos os atendimentos da unidade serão suspensos, pois é preciso que o local esteja vazio para a realização dos serviços. LEIA TAMBÉM: Banco de sangue do HPS está com estoques críticos e precisa de doações Conforme acertado com a Secretaria Municipal de Saúde, a instituição elaborou um plano de contingência de forma a garantir assistência a pacientes graves e urgentes regulados via Serviço de Atendimento Móvel de Urgência (Samu) durante todo o período da obra, e a assegurar a continuidade do atendimento de pacientes transplantados e oncológicos, e também para aqueles com complicações cirúrgicas de pós-operatório. Na estratégia elaborada, após os primeiros 36 dias de obras serão retomadas parcialmente as atividades na emergência adulto.\nNo escopo da obra está a reconstrução completa do piso, incluindo a substituição do contrapiso por material de resistência superior, e instalação de revestimentos em paredes já desgastadas . Também ocorrerá a implantação de espaços de triagem e acolhimento, e criação de nova sala de prescrição para pacientes de curta permanência.\nDe forma concomitante será realizada limpeza de dutos do sistema de ar condicionado em ambas as emergências conforme exigência do plano de manutenção, operação e controle (PMOC), em conformidade com a Lei Federal 13.589/18. A aquisição de novo aparelho de angiografia vai exigir instalação robusta para passagem de cabos, que será feita no mesmo período.\nDe acordo com o secretário municipal de Saúde, Fernando Ritter, instituições de alta complexidade da Capital estarão preparadas para absorver pacientes encaminhados pela Samu. \"A execução dos serviços neste momento é crucial para assegurar ambiente seguro a todos\", reforça.\nOs três prontos-atendimentos de Porto Alegre – UPAs Bom Jesus, Lomba do Pinheiro e Cruzeiro do Sul – e a UPA Moacyr Scliar também estarão de sobreaviso às demandas que surgirem no período.",
