    "text": "Hey there! Are you struggling with a cluttered iPhone 11 and need to free up some space? Well, you're in luck! In this article, we'll explore a variety of effective methods to help you declutter your device and maximize its storage capacity. Whether it's clearing out unnecessary apps, managing your photo library, or optimizing your device's settings, we've got you covered. By the end of this article, you'll be equipped with the knowledge and tools to streamline your iPhone 11's storage, ensuring that you have ample space for all your important files and apps. So, let's dive in and discover how to free up space on your iPhone 11!\nInside This Article\n[Understanding Your iPhone Storage](#toc-0) [Managing Photos and Videos](#toc-1) [Deleting Unused Apps](#toc-2) [Clearing Safari Cache](#toc-3) [Conclusion](#conclusion) [FAQs](#faqs)\nUnderstanding Your iPhone Storage\nWhen you own an\niPhone 11, it’s essential to understand how your device’s storage works. The storage on your iPhone is where all your apps, photos, videos, and other data are stored. It’s crucial to keep an eye on your storage space to ensure your device runs smoothly and efficiently.\nYour iPhone’s\nstorage capacity can vary depending on the model you have. The iPhone 11 comes in different storage options, such as 64GB, 128GB, and 256GB. The amount of storage you have will determine how much content you can store on your device. It’s important to manage your storage effectively to prevent running out of space and encountering performance issues.\nUnderstanding your\niPhone storage also involves knowing how much space different types of content consume. For example, high-resolution photos and 4K videos can take up a significant amount of storage compared to text-based documents or emails. By being mindful of the storage requirements of different file types, you can better manage your available space.\nManaging Photos and Videos\nOne of the main culprits for consuming significant storage space on your iPhone 11 is the accumulation of photos and videos. These\nmedia files can quickly add up, especially if you’re fond of capturing every moment of your life. However, there are several effective strategies for managing and optimizing the storage occupied by these visual memories.\nFirst, consider utilizing cloud storage services such as iCloud, Google Photos, or\nDropbox. These platforms offer free and paid options for storing your photos and videos in the cloud, thereby freeing up space on your device. Additionally, they provide features for organizing and accessing your media from anywhere, ensuring that your precious memories are securely backed up.\nAnother approach is to regularly review and delete unnecessary photos and videos from your iPhone. This can be a daunting task, but it’s essential for reclaiming valuable storage space. Take the time to sift through your camera roll and identify redundant or unremarkable media that can be safely removed. You may be surprised by the amount of space you can recover by decluttering your photo and video library.\nFurthermore, consider optimizing your photo and video settings to capture and store media more efficiently. For instance, you can enable High Efficiency\nmode for photos, which utilizes the HEIF and HEVC formats to reduce file sizes without compromising quality. Additionally, adjusting the video recording resolution to a lower setting can help conserve storage space while still capturing memorable moments with satisfactory clarity.\nFinally, take advantage of the “Recently Deleted” album in the Photos\napp. When you delete a photo or video, it isn’t immediately removed from your device. Instead, it goes to the “Recently Deleted” album where it remains for a designated period before being permanently erased. This safety net allows you to recover mistakenly deleted media and provides a buffer before the files are permanently expunged from your device.\nDeleting Unused Apps\nOne of the quickest ways to free up space on your iPhone 11 is by removing apps that you no longer use. Over time, we tend to accumulate a multitude of apps that end up taking valuable space on our devices. Take a moment to assess which apps you no longer need or use regularly. This could include games that have lost their appeal, productivity apps that have been replaced by more efficient alternatives, or utilities that have become redundant.\nStart by identifying these unused apps on your home screen. Press and hold an app until it starts jiggling, then tap the “X” icon in the corner to delete it. Alternatively, you can go to Settings > General > iPhone Storage, where you’ll find a list of all your apps sorted by size. This allows you to easily pinpoint the largest space-hogging apps that you can consider removing.\nHowever, before deleting an app, consider whether it contains any important data. Some apps store valuable information such as documents, photos, or messages. Ensure that you have backed up any crucial data from the app before proceeding with the deletion. Once you’ve safeguarded the necessary data, feel free to remove the app to reclaim the space it occupies on your device.\nClearing Safari Cache\nWhen you browse the internet on your iPhone,\nSafari stores temporary data such as images, cookies, and browsing history to help websites load faster on subsequent visits. However, this cache can accumulate over time and consume a significant amount of storage space on your device.\nTo clear the Safari cache and free up space on your iPhone 11, start by opening the Settings app and\nscrolling down to find Safari. Tap on Safari, and then scroll down to the “Clear History and Website Data” option. Tap on it, and confirm your decision when prompted. This will remove all cached data, cookies, and browsing history from Safari, effectively freeing up space on your device.\nIt’s important to note that clearing the Safari cache will log you out of any websites you are currently signed into, and it will also remove any stored website data. However, this can be a small price to pay for reclaiming valuable storage space on your iPhone.\nConclusion\nFreeing up space on your iPhone 11 is essential for maintaining optimal performance and ensuring that you can continue capturing memories, downloading apps, and enjoying\nmultimedia content without limitations. By implementing the strategies outlined in this article, you can reclaim valuable storage space and streamline your device’s functionality. From managing your photos and videos to optimizing app usage and leveraging cloud storage solutions, there are various approaches to decluttering your iPhone 11. Remember, regular maintenance and mindful storage habits will contribute to a seamless user experience and prevent storage-related frustrations. With these techniques at your disposal, you can make the most of your iPhone 11 without being hindered by storage constraints.\nFAQs\n-\nHow do I free up space on my iPhone 11?\nTo free up space on your iPhone 11, you can start by deleting unused apps, offloading unused apps, clearing cache and temporary files, optimizing photo and video storage, and managing your downloads and files.\n-\nWhat happens if my iPhone 11 runs out of storage?\nWhen your iPhone 11 runs out of storage, you may experience slow performance, inability to download or\nupdateapps, inability to capture photos or videos, and issues with receiving new emails and messages.\n-\nShould I use iCloud to free up space on my iPhone 11?\nUsing iCloud can help free up space on your iPhone 11 by storing your photos, videos, and files in the cloud.

    "title": "Gli acquisti di energia pulita segnano il record: 46GW nel 2023",
    "text": "Il Corporate Energy Market Outlook del primo semestre 2024 di BNEF\n(Rinnovabili.it) – Gli acquisti di energia pulita nel mondo segnano un nuovo record. Nel 2023 i contratti di compravendita energetica a lungo termine, noti anche come Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), stipulati tra produttori e aziende, sono cresciuti del 12% rispetto al 2022. Contrattualizzando 41 GW di nuova potenza verde. Il dato è globale, ma a fare da traino sono state più che altro due regioni: il Nord America e l’Europa. Il Vecchio Continente, in particolare, si è fatto notare per la rapidità di crescita: i suoi corporate PPA eolici e fotovoltaici hanno registrato una vera e propria impennata, aumentando nel 2023 del 74%. A fare il punto della situazione è il Corporate Energy Market Outlook del primo semestre 2024, pubblicato qualche giorno fa da\nBloombergNEF (BNEF).\nIl rapporto mostra come il miglioramento dell’economia in regioni chiave come quella europea, insieme agli imminenti obiettivi aziendali in materia di sostenibilità, siano stati i principali fattori alla base dei nuovi acquisti di energia pulita. E posiziona il mercato dei PPA aziendali su un trend 2024 addirittura migliore. “Non è mai stato così facile per un’azienda acquistare energia pulita”, spiega Kyle Harrison, responsabile della ricerca sulla sostenibilità presso BloombergNEF e autore principale del rapporto. “Per la prima volta, una varietà di strutture contrattuali sono ampiamente disponibili a livello globale per aiutare le aziende a decarbonizzare i propri consumi di energia. Questi contratti sono ora il fulcro delle strategie di sostenibilità di molte società, piuttosto che qualcosa di utile ma non necessario”.\nAcquisti di energia pulita, chi sono i grandi venditori?\nIl quadro europeo – nel 2023 sono stati stretti PPA rinnovabili per 15,4 GW – deve la sua dinamicità al repentino calo dei prezzi che ha reso le condizioni di stipula più allettanti in mercati come Spagna, Germania, Regno Unito e Paesi Bassi. Basti pensare che questi 4 paesi da soli rappresentano oltre la metà degli accordi di compravendita annunciati nella regione lo scorso anno.\nleggi anche\nPPA rinnovabili, per l’Europa è il momento dell’ottimismo\nMa se focalizziamo la lente sulle singole realtà aziendali emergono altri dati interessanti. Amazon si conferma il maggior compratore di energia pulita al mondo tramite PPA solari ed eolici oltre 200 aziende monitorate da BNEF. Nel 2023 la società ha annunciato 8,8 GW di Power Purchase Agreement in 16 paesi. Nuovi acquisti che portano il portafoglio aziendale a quota 33,6 GW di potenza rinnovabile contrattualizzata. Tra i grandi compratori 2023 appaiono anche Meta, LyondellBasell e Google. “Con l’ascesa dell’intelligenza artificiale, l’elettrificazione dei trasporti e l’aumento della necessità di produzione, prevediamo che la domanda di energia da parte del settore privato aumenterà nei prossimi anni”, ha affermato Harrison. “L’energia pulita, soprattutto attraverso i PPA, sarà probabilmente la prima e migliore opzione per molte aziende”.\nE tra i venditori? La francese Engie ha venduto la maggior parte dell’energia pulita tramite PPA aziendali lo scorso anno: ben 2,4 GW di accordi. Rappresenta anche l’unico grande sviluppatore ad aver firmato un PPA fotovoltaico legato ad impianti a terra e in mare. Seguono in classifica AES, che ha annunciato accordi per 1,9 GW (primo della lista nei due anni passati), Tata Power con 1,2 GW, Lightsource BP (1 GW) ed Eneco (0,9 GW).",

    "text": "By Saurabh Sharma and Anushree Fadnavis\nAYODHYA, India (Reuters) - Less than a month before a grand Hindu temple opens, India's northern town of Ayodhya is buzzing with activity as finishing touches are put on a project seen as the centrepiece of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's re-election campaign.\nOnce a sleepy temple town in the most populous state of Uttar Pradesh, Ayodhya has received a new airport and roads in a $6-billion facelift as Modi prepares to inaugurate the temple to Lord Ram, one of Hinduism's most revered deities.\nA day before Modi was set to inaugurate the airport and a renovated train station, workers decorated the streets with flowers, amid a swarm of police.\n\"Soon our Lord will be in his original place,\" said Girish Sahastrabhojane, who worked on the design of the temple, which forms part of a sprawling 70-acre (28-hectare) complex of carved pink sandstone and white marble.\n\"Our Lord Ram was born here and the Hindus of India, and also abroad, have been waiting for it since 1992,\" the engineer involved in the construction told visiting reporters.\nBut Modi's opponents have accused him of stoking religious sentiment to further his political ambitions, and several opposition leaders have declined an invitation to attend the temple's inauguration.\nOn Jan. 22, Modi will pray for the first time before an idol of Lord Ram at the project, which cost more than 20 billion rupees ($240 million), and where more than 4,500 workers are labouring round the clock to complete the ground floor.\nWearing hardhats and safety shoes, they worked on Friday to carve pillars and lift stones amid cranes towering over the site, which Sahastrabhojane said could accommodate 125,000 people in a day.\nModi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party has long pledged completion of the temple as one of its core aims.\nHe has made its construction an emotive issue in many speeches ahead of next year's general elections, widely expected to secure him a third term.\nNationwide riots that killed 2,000 people, most of them minority Muslims, broke out in 1992 after a Hindu mob razed the Babri mosque - where the temple will stand - saying it was built on the site of an earlier Hindu temple.\nIn 2019, the Supreme Court ordered that Hindus be allowed to build a temple there, ending years of litigation.\n($1=83.1875 Indian rupees)\n(Reporting by Saurabh Sharma and Anushree Fadnavis in Ayodhya; Writing by Shilpa Jamkhandikar; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)",

    "text": "They could be ticking timebombs.\nWestchester County health officials are imploring a pair of good Samaritans who dropped a rabid cat off at a Yonkers animal hospital to come forward — because they could be infected with the fatal disease.\nThe anonymous pair was caught on surveillance video pulling off their good deed last week, but left without giving shelter workers their names — and could now face a lethal health hazard.\n3 Health officials said this woman carried an injured cat to the Yonkers Animal Hospital last week and could now be infected with rabies. Westchester Gov 3 This man and a woman may have been infected after dropping a rabid cat off at a Yonkers animal hospital. Westchester Gov “Rabies is fatal, but it is also 100% preventable with post-exposure treatment,” county Health Commissioner Dr. Sherlita Amler said in a statement this week .\nExplore More Democrats and GOP hardliners tank Trump-backed House bill to avert government shutdown White House aides hid Biden's apparent mental decline from Day 1 of his presidency, explosive report reveals Luigi Mangione makes first appearance in Manhattan federal court on murder charges in death of UnitedHealthcare CEO “If you see an injured or sick animal, call police,” Amler said. “Teach your children to not approach or handle animals they don’t know, even if they appear young, injured or friendly, and to tell you right away if they are bitten or scratched by any animal.”\nBut the cautionary advice comes too late for the Yonkers do-gooders, who county officials said were only trying to help the year-old feline after it was possibly struck by a car.\nThe cat, which was left at the Yonkers Animal Hospital on Saw Mill River Road shortly before 4:30 pm on Dec. 12, later tested positive for rabies, the health department said.\nSecurity camera footage from the site showed a man wearing a red checkered jacket, khaki pants and a black hat, and a woman in a black jacket who carried the cat in a beige tote bag.\n3 Rabies is a viral infection carried by animals that can prove fatal to humans without treatment with a rabies vaccine. Steve Heaslip/Cape Cod Times / USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 60,000 people in the US receive medical treatment every year after exposure to rabig animals.\nRabies is a viral disease transmitted to humans by animals and can be fatal if untreated.\nWhile there is no indication the Yonkers good Samaritans were infected, the county wants to make sure.\n“Unusual behavior may be the first sign of rabies in an animal,” the county said in a press release. “A rabid animal may become either abnormally aggressive or unusually tame.\n“It may lose fear of people and become excited and irritable, or appear particularly passive and lethargic,” the release said. “Staggering and frothing at the mouth are sometimes noted.”",
