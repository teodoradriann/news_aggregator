    "text": "Ottawa’s emissions policies will impose huge costs on Albertans\nThe federal NDP recently ended its support for the consumer carbon tax citing its significant cost to everyday Canadians. But Canada’s costly climate change policies extend beyond the carbon tax. Indeed, the Trudeau government has introduced numerous policies in an attempt to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which impose major costs on Albertans.\nThe consumer carbon tax is perhaps the most widely known GHG reduction policy, which places a price on carbon (currently at $80 per tonne) and is set to rise to $170 per tonne by 2030. However, the Trudeau government has also imposed other regulations and mandates, including clean fuel regulations, electric vehicle mandates, the phase-out of coal-based electrical generation and building efficiency mandates.\nThe costs? According to a recent study, these GHG policies will shrink the Alberta economy (as measured by GDP) by an estimated 6.0 per cent by 2030. And employment in the province is expected to decline by 0.9 per cent. To put these figures into perspective, a 6.0 per cent contraction in 2024 would have shrunk the provincial economy by $27.7 billion, while a 0.9 per cent decrease in employment would have meant a loss of approximately 22,837 jobs (based on data for August 2024).\nWhile these policies are expected to reduce GHG emissions, they fall short of meeting the government's national GHG reduction targets. As a result, further economic pain will be required if the federal government implements additional measures to further reduce GHGs emissions.\nThese findings echo other studies that measure the effects of various climate change policies. According to a report by Deloitte, for instance, Trudeau’s policy to cap GHG emissions in the oil and gas sector (to 35 to 38 per cent below 2019 levels by 2030) will lead to less investment, nearly 70,000 fewer jobs, and a 4.5 per cent decrease in economic output (i.e. GDP) among the provinces by 2040. Unsurprisingly, Alberta is projected to be the hardest hit province.\nAnd here’s the kicker—these huge economic costs come with little to no actual environmental benefit. Even if Canada shut down its entire oil and gas sector by 2030, thus eliminating all GHG emissions from the sector, the resulting reduction would equal four-tenths of 1 per cent of global emissions, which would have an undetectable impact on the climate. Meanwhile, as demand for fossil fuels continues to increase, constraining oil and gas production and exports in Canada merely shifts production to other countries, which have lower environmental and human rights standards such as Iran, Russia and Venezuela.\nThe Trudeau government’s climate change regulations are imposing huge costs on Albertans with little to no actual environmental benefit. While support for some of these policies—particularly the consumer carbon tax—is waning, federal policymakers should seriously rethink numerous other regulations.\nAuthors:\nSubscribe to the Fraser Institute\nGet the latest news from the Fraser Institute on the latest research studies, news and events.",

    "title": "New water quality technology makes its debut in Buzzards Bay | GBH",
    "text": "Every five days, Lisa Kingston, a 62-year-old critical care nurse, drives to the Onset pier to collect samples in the murky waters of Buzzards Bay. “This is our oxygen bottle and this is our salinity bottle. We pull this — bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop —” she says, imitating the sound of water, “and that fills up.” At the end of this dock, Kingston performs an hour-and-a-half-long data collection routine — just as she has done 22 times a summer for the past two years. She and fellow volunteer Susan Scott are here to take measurements on oxygen, water temperature, salinity, and more. Scott, a 77-year-old retired arts administrator, rips open a reagent packet and adds it to a glass vial. “There’s a certain sort of MacGyver-ish quality to it,” she said. “While there’s a process and you have to do it in a certain way, anyone could do it. You don’t have to be a trained scientist.” Kingston and Scott are among dozens of volunteers who take part in one of the longest-running water quality programs in the region. Their work helps scientists understand how much septic systems and lawn fertilizers are polluting Buzzards Bay with nitrogen. Excess nitrogen can cause toxic algae blooms and dangerously low oxygen levels that make it nearly impossible for marine life to survive. So, Kingston said, the work is meaningful to volunteers. “You want to take care of the things that bring you joy,” she said. “And I couldn’t imagine not being able to be part of this bay, or not wanting to be in it.” For more than three decades, volunteers have been essential to monitoring the health of the bay. But now the Buzzards Bay Coalition is experimenting with a new system, one where technology is used to continuously test the water. It means fewer data gaps and less human error, but it also means volunteers are a smaller part of the process. The new tech “So we’ll pull up a logger and show you what it does,” said Chris Neill, a senior scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center. With him was researcher Kristin Huizenga of the Buzzards Bay Coalition. The two organizations are collaborating on this project. Huizenga crouched at the end of the pier and hauled up an algae-covered milk crate filled with scientific instruments. “They’re basically little cylinders,” she explained, pointing to the so-called data loggers; each is about the size and shape of a glasses case. “There’s one that has a copper cap on top — that’s the dissolved oxygen sensor. And then there’s another one that’s all black, and that is our conductivity and temperature sensor.” All Huizenga has to do is connect a cable and download the data. “We can hook it up to our computer,” she said. “And then we can see that data and how it changes throughout the day and over weeks.” Forget the era of volunteers getting water quality data every five days. These loggers are collecting information every 10 minutes. They’re still pretty new, but they’ve already begun to show that dangerously low oxygen events have gone undetected as much as 40% of the time. Now, Neill says, findings like these could be used to create better protections for the bay. They could, for example, push policy that limits major nearby developments that rely on septic systems, or policy that phases in nitrogen-reducing septic systems for homeowners. “So just knowing that these bays are impaired, there’s this connection to those kinds of actions,” he said. The Buzzards Bay Coalition will spend the summer testing data loggers at 19 of the 200 volunteer stations around the bay. But the new technology could bring a not-so-welcome change for a community of volunteers who’ve been essential to the coalition’s mission since 1992. It’s something retired arts administrator Susan Scott is thinking about. “I’d like to be helpful wherever I can be,” she said. “So if they say, ‘There’s something else you could do in lieu of that,’ that’d be great. Or if they said, ‘We’ve got the high-tech sensors and so forth, so none of this is necessary,’ I’d find somewhere else to go and help in some way.” But the human touch will be necessary to collect some kinds of data for the foreseeable future. So, even as researchers rely more heavily on technology, the work of protecting the bay will still depend on volunteers. Copyright 2024 CAI",

    "title": "Explained: Strategic importance of Sela Tunnel in Arunachal Pradesh - The Week",
    "text": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi, today, inaugurated the strategically important Sela Tunnel, along with a host of other projects worth Rs 55,600 crore spread across Manipur, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Sikkim, Tripura and Arunachal Pradesh, at a programme in Itanagar. The tunnel, constructed by the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) at an altitude of 13,000 ft and at a cost of about Rs 825 crore, will provide all-weather connectivity to Tawang across Sela pass on the Balipara-Chariduar-Tawang Road in Arunachal Pradesh, a statement said. Specifications of the Sela Tunnel The construction work was completed in five years, and is said to be the world’s longest twin-lane tunnel above 13,000 ft. It consists of two tunnels - Tunnel 1 of 980m and Twin Tube Tunnel 1,555m long, with 8.6km approach and link roads. The second tunnel has an escape tube adjacent to the main one as per international norms. In case of emergency, this escape tube can be used for the movement of rescue vehicles and evacuation of stranded people. The tunnel has been designed for a traffic density of 3,000 cars and 2,000 trucks per day with a maximum speed of 80 km/hr. It was constructed using the New Austrian Tunneling Method (NATM). Strategic importance of Sela Tunnel Lack of road and rail connectivity in in Arunachal Pradesh have always been a disadvantage for India, with China breathing down its neck at the border, having better infrastructure to and along the LAC, thus giving it a strategic advantage. The earlier route to Sela pass had only single-lane connectivity, and heavy vehicles and container trucks could not go to Tawang because of the treacherous terrain. The Sela Tunnel is one of the several high-altitude infrastructure that India is building to enhance connectivity to areas close to the Line of Actual Control (LAC). It will help the Indian Army mobilise resources quickly in case of an emergency in the Tawang sector, irrespective of the weather. The tunnel will facilitate Army movement in an area where India lost to China in the 1962 war. It will also reduce the travelling time between Tawang and Tezpur by an hour.",

    "text": "The US is said to have approved plans to strike Iranian personnel and facilities in Iraq and Syria in response to a drone attack that killed three US soldiers in Jordan on Sunday.\nUS officials have characterised the response as a “campaign” that could last “weeks”, and will include both airstrikes and cyberattacks, according to NBC. It would target both the Iran-backed militias that carried out the deadly attack and Iranian forces that support them in the region, officials told ABC separately.\nThe decision to attack Iranian personnel directly in Iraq and Syria marks a significant escalation in a volatile regional power struggle that pits the US against Iran and a network of allied militias in the Middle East.\nUS forces in the region have come under frequent attacks by Iran-backed militias opposed to the US presence in the region for years, but those attacks increased dramatically following Israel’s invasion of Gaza, and Washington’s unyielding support for the war.\nUS bases have been struck by more than 160 rocket and drone attacks in Iraq and Syria since mid-October. US warships and international merchant vessels have also come under attack from Yemen’s Houthi rebels, who are also backed by Iran.\nConcerns have been growing over the spread of violence across the Middle East linked to Israel’s war in Gaza, which was triggered by an attack by Hamas inside Israel in which around 1,200 people were killed and another 240 taken hostage. Israel’s war against Hamas, which is allied with Iran, has drawn in Iran’s allies from across the region – from Yemen’s Houthis to Lebanon’s Hezbollah. Israel’s war has killed more than 26,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run Palestinian health ministry.\nThe Biden administration has said repeatedly that it hoped to prevent a wider regional escalation as a result of the Israel-Hamas war but the intervention of the Houthis and the killing of US soldiers has resulted in a series of military confrontations that resemble a low-level regional war. The US now regularly carries out strikes against the Houthis in Yemen, as well as Iran-backed militias in Iraq and Syria.\nWhen questioned by The Independent about whether the US classifies the fighting on multiple fronts as a war, White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said he disagreed.\nNewly-recruited Houthi fighters hold up weapons during a protest against the US-UK air strikes, in Sana’a, Yemen (EPA)\n“There were attacks against our troops and facilities in Iraq and Syria well before 7 October – certainly in the last administration as well,” he said on Thursday. “And as for the Houthis, they can claim all they want that this is linked to Gaza but two-thirds of the ships that they’re hitting have no connection to Israel whatsoever. So, it’s just not true. It’s a falsehood.”\nThree US service personnel were killed and 34 wounded last week after a drone hit a military outpost in Jordan known as Tower 22, on the border between Iraq and Syria. It marked the first time US soldiers have been killed by the attacks since the start of the Israel-Hamas war.\nThe White House determined that the attack was carried out by a loose alliance of Iran-backed militias in the region.\n“We believe that the attack in Jordan was a plan resourced and facilitated by an umbrella group called the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, which contains multiple groups, including Kataib Hezbollah,” Mr Kirby said.\nUS secretary of defence Lloyd Austin said on Thursday that the military response to those deaths will be “multi-tiered”.\n“Again, we have the ability to respond a number of times, depending on what the situation is,” he added.\nLloyd Austin addresses the media at the Pentagon (AFP/Getty)\nPresident Joe Biden told reporters on Wednesday that he had decided on a response to the attacks but did not want an escalation in fighting.\n“I don’t think we need a wider war in the Middle East. That’s not what I’m looking for,” he said.\nMeanwhile, US forces struck a Houthi drone base in Yemen in the early hours of Thursday morning after determining it presented an “imminent threat” to merchant and navy vessels in the region.\nThe Pentagon said in a statement that it had conducted strikes “against an Iranian-backed Houthi UAV ground control station and 10 Houthi one-way UAVs” at around 1.30am local time.\nThe Houthis have repeatedly attacked merchant and US navy ships in the region since November.\nThe group’s spokesperson said the attacks on vessels in one of the world’s busiest shipping routes would continue “until the aggression is stopped, and the siege is lifted on the people of Palestine in the Gaza Strip”.\nFrom news to politics, travel to sport, culture to climate – The Independent has a host of free newsletters to suit your interests.

    "text": "Había muchas ganas de ver a Carolina Marín tras el sabor amargo que dejaron los Juegos Olímpicos de París y, por fin, Huelva ha podido encontrarse con su campeona y rendirle el homenaje que se merece. Ha sido este jueves en el Ayuntamiento de la capital onubense, hasta donde la volantista onubense se ha desplazado, primero para ser recibida por la alcaldesa, Pilar Miranda, y tener un encuentro con los medios de comunicación en el Salón de Plenos, y más tarde para saludar y dedicar unas palabras a sus paisanos desde uno de los balcones de la Casa Consistorial. Antes cientos de personas que se congregaron en la plaza de La Constitución y que recibieron a la volantista al son de las palmas onubenses y al grito de campeona, Marín recordaba con emoción sus comienzos: “En 2007 salí de Huelva rumbo a Madrid, en el coche de mis padres, con la intención de aprovechar una oportunidad que se me presentaba: podía entrenar con los mejores de España y un entrenador apostaba por mí para hacerme crecer. No sabía entonces que ya no volvería a vivir aquí, de momento. Atrás quedaban la avenida de Santa Marta, el pabellón Diego Lobato, mi casa y mi familia”. “Tenía muchos sueños por cumplir y he conseguido cumplir prácticamente todos. Lo que no sabía entonces aquella niña que salió de aquí es que un trocito de esta ciudad y de todos vosotros me acompañaría en Madrid y en cualquier lugar del mundo en el que estuviese”, añadía con emoción. Y por último, un deseo: “No sé que me deparará el futuro, quiero cuidarme, recuperarme bien y rodearme de los míos. Ojalá ese proceso me lleve a poder colgar la raqueta en una pista y que, si se dan las circunstancias, eso pueda suceder aquí, en nuestro Palacio de Deportes”. Y precisamente, la alcaldesa también aprovechaba la ocasión para recordar que el Ayuntamiento está gestionando la candidatura de Huelva como sede para albergar el Campeonato Europeo de Bádminton de 2026, un proyecto que, según la propia Miranda, sería “un homenaje al legado de Carolina Marín”.
