    "text": "Kent McCord remembered the first time he met his Adam-12 costar, Martin Milner How McCord and Milner went from costars to friends. Beginning a new job can be a daunting experience for anyone. It's a new environment, new rules, and a whole new group of people who you have no idea if you'll get along with. For Kent McCord, that case of new-job jitters was only further emphasized by the fact that in his new series, Adam-12, he would be starring with seasoned actor, Martin Milner. Milner was already a well-known television star for his role as Tod Stiles in Route 66, a series with four seasons under its belt, and Milner had appeared in every single one. So, when the pair were thrust together by Universal, to say that McCord was nervous was an understatement. Luckily, according to an interview between McCord and the Athol Daily News, Milner put McCord's fears at ease, just a little bit, by reminding him that even experienced actors experience some nerves. McCord said that when the two met, \"Marty was yawning and told me how he couldn't sleep the night before beginning a new show. I'd had a restless evening too, so hearing that from a veteran actor was very reassuring. From that moment on, our relationship was cemented.\" The actor was also able to speak on the success of the series as well. He said, \"The charm of Adam-12 was its simplicity. Just two cops in a black-and-white patrolling the streets of Los Angeles. The moral of the stories was simply — crime doesn't pay.\" He continued, \"To this day, I get police officers telling me they became cops because of Adam-12. Others remember how kids approached them differently before and after the show aired. Its positive impact meant a lot to Marty and me.\" [Watch Adam-12 on MeTV!](/shows/adam-12) One Full Hour Weekdays at 4 PM*available in most MeTV markets [Svengoolie® T-Shirt ](https://metvmall.com/products/svengoolie-t-shirt?utm_source=metv&utm_medium=affinity&utm_campaign=bestselling&utm_content=svengoolietshirt) [Women's Svengoolie® T-Shirt ](https://metvmall.com/products/ladies-svengoolie-t-shirt?utm_source=metv&utm_medium=affinity&utm_campaign=bestselling&utm_content=ladiessvengoolietshirt) [Woody Woodpecker - Woody ](https://metvmall.com/products/woody-woodpecker-woody?utm_source=metv&utm_medium=affinity&utm_campaign=bestselling&utm_content=woodywoodpeckerwoody) [Svengoolie® Logo Travel Mug ](https://metvmall.com/products/svengoolie-travel-mug?utm_source=metv&utm_medium=affinity&utm_campaign=recentlyadded&utm_content=svengoolietravelmug) [Svengoolie® Die-Cut Magnet ](https://metvmall.com/products/svengoolie-die-cut-magnet?utm_source=metv&utm_medium=affinity&utm_campaign=recentlyadded&utm_content=svengooliediecutmagnet) 4 Comments [Newest](#!)| [Oldest](#!)| [Top Comments](#!)",

    "title": "Sordo afirma que la aritmética parlamentaria complica la aprobación de normas del diálogo social",
    "text": "En un momento de alta complejidad política en España, el Sindicato Confederal de Comisiones Obreras (CCOO) ha enfatizado la necesidad de una acción sindical proactiva y movilizadora. Unai Sordo, secretario general de CCOO, reconoce que la actual coyuntura parlamentaria dificulta la convalidación de normativas acordadas entre el Gobierno y los agentes sociales.\nDurante el reciente Consejo Confederal de CCOO, se ha debatido sobre la situación política y económica , donde Sordo ha advertido que «este no va a ser un curso más». La dificultad política actual afectará de manera directa al desarrollo del diálogo social y a la acción gubernamental.\nMovilización por la Reducción de Jornada Laboral Ante este panorama, CCOO ha reivindicado la necesidad de un proceso de movilización creciente en torno a la reducción de la jornada laboral. Esto tendrá su primer hito el próximo 26 de septiembre, cuando CCOO y UGT convocarán movilizaciones en todas las capitales de provincia españolas para exigir la reducción de la jornada a 37,5 horas semanales para el año 2025. Sordo ha expresado que esta movilización es solo el inicio, y que continuarán instando a los partidos políticos a que clarifiquen su postura sobre esta reforma laboral.\nAgenda Sindical Ampliada Más allá de la jornada laboral, Sordo ha abogado por reforzar la agenda sindical en otras áreas clave , como la vivienda, la política fiscal y las infraestructuras de transporte. Estas serán áreas prioritarias en la acción de CCOO en los próximos tiempos.\nAsimismo, el líder sindical ha destacado la aprobación de los próximos Presupuestos Generales del Estado (PGE) y el plan fiscal y estructural que España deberá presentar a la Unión Europea como hitos fundamentales. Desde CCOO insisten en la necesidad de un proyecto presupuestario « expansivo » que, junto a los fondos europeos, impulse la actividad productiva , refuerce los servicios públicos y aborde las desigualdades y la precariedad .\nTemas Clave en la Agenda Sindical Finalmente, Sordo ha señalado dos temas que serán « muy relevantes » en los próximos tiempos y sobre los cuales CCOO deberá posicionarse: la situación de la inmigración y la necesaria reforma de la financiación autonómica .\nEn cuanto a la inmigración , CCOO considera necesario fortalecer los acuerdos y recursos que impulsen políticas públicas como la contratación en origen , la migración circular y los procedimientos administrativos de arraigo , ante la realidad de que España requerirá más de 20 millones de personas migrantes en las próximas décadas.\nRespecto a la financiación autonómica , CCOO aboga por abordar este debate desde conceptos distintos a los utilizados hasta ahora, que han estado muy condicionados por el agravio comparativo , el conflicto interterritorial y el tacticismo político .\nEn resumen, el Sindicato CCOO ha trazado una agenda sindical expansiva y proactiva en un contexto político complejo, con la movilización por la reducción de jornada como hito inicial, y una estrategia ampliada que incluye áreas como la vivienda , la fiscalidad y las infraestructuras , así como temas clave como la inmigración y la financiación autonómica .",

    "title": "Lilavati Hospital to tap PE, pension funds for its Rs 4k-cr expansion plan - The Economic Times",
    "text": "MUMBAI: Promoters of Mumbai-based Lilavati Hospital are in talks with private equity investors and pension funds for its proposed Rs 4,000-crore pan-India expansion plan which entails setting up five to six multispecialty hospitals over the next five years. We will be funding the expansion through internal accruals, and are also in discussions with PE investors, pension funds and donors, said Prashant Mehta, promoter, Lilavati Hospital. We will retain the controlling stake, Mehta added.He said Lilavati is looking at both greenfield and brownfield hospitals as part of its expansion strategy. The proposed expansion will be carried out by Lilavati Foundation, a distinct and separate entity from Lilavati Hospital, Mumbai. We believe there is still a huge potential for growth of healthcare services in India, Mehta said.The expansion will encompass 3,000 hospital beds. Lilavati is setting up a greenfield 300-bed multi-specialty hospital in GIFT City, Gujarat with an investment of Rs 300 crore. The hospital is slated to open by 2025-end. Lilavati is also considering opening hospitals in Dharamshala (Himachal Pradesh), Noida (Uttar Pradesh), Pune (Maharashtra), and Bengaluru (Karnataka) and Guwahati (Assam), Mehta said. He said they are also looking at expanding the 319-bed Lilavati Hospital & Research Centre in Bandra, Mumbai by adding a 150-bed oncology block, which might involve acquiring adjoining property. The expansion would cost anywhere between Rs 350 crore and Rs 400 crore, said Mehta, also the permanent trustee on the board of Lilavati Kirtilal Mehta Medical Trust that runs Lilavati Hospital in Mumbai.Mehta said Lilavati Hospital in Mumbai will remain a public charitable trust. Mehta's parents Kishor and Charu Mehta were instrumental in setting up super-speciality Lilavati Hospital in Mumbai 25 years ago. Lilavati is also planning to start a pharmacy chain comprising 500 stores across India in next five years with an investment of ?200 crore. The first store was launched in Ahmedabad in September last year.Mehta said pharmacy expansion will be done via company-owned pharmacies and franchisees.",

    "title": "Lancaster County breaks Halloween heat record, records second driest October in history | Local News | lancasteronline.com",
    "text": "Despite an early morning sprinkling Friday, Lancaster County remains in a drought, as October finished up as the second driest month since record-keeping began. According to Millersville Weather Information Center, just 0.04 inches of rain fell in October. In the 110 years since meteorologists began tracking that data, only October 1963 was drier. No rain fell that month. October culminated in the hottest Halloween on record , with a high of 84 degrees, eclipsing the 1946 record of 81. Temperatures fell to the upper 40s overnight. The first day of November started with some light rain, but Millersville Weather Information Center Director Kyle Elliott said there was not enough to be measurable at Millersville, and no more than a few hundredths of an inch fell in other parts of the county. Lancaster is under a drought watch alongside 32 other counties in the state, with Berks and Schuylkill counties under a drought warning, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection’s Drought Task Force. Under these conditions, county residents are encouraged to reduce their water usage by 5% to 10%. The U.S. Drought Monitor last week classified Lancaster and surrounding counties in a moderate drought stage, with severe drought conditions creeping in from the east through Chester and Berks counties. There is little relief on the horizon, as the jet stream, a weather current that brings rain, is abnormally far north this year, Elliott said. While this is happening, any potential storms and rain likely will be weak and short in duration. A dry harvest Jeff Graybill, an agronomy educator at Penn State Extension, said with dry conditions during harvest, the ground around fields is essentially a tinderbox. “Corn fodder can be quite flammable,” Graybill said, with thin leaves fueling fast fires. “It can march across a field pretty darn quickly.” More than 40 brush and woodland fires have kept emergency crews across the county busy throughout October. The National Weather Service in State College on Friday issued a red flag warning for Lancaster and surrounding counties throughout the day, saying conditions for wildfire growth and spread were dangerously high. Along with flammable conditions, cover crops that are planted in the fall may not root as easily in dry and dusty conditions. Cover crops, such as clover and rye, protect soil over the winter from heavy rains and freezes. With dry fields, those crops may not take, leaving parts of the land unprotected. “If (a crop) hasn't germinated and grown, or if it's just been so dry that it's only a couple of inches tall, it's not going to protect the soil as much as you would want it to,” Graybill said. State Agriculture Secretary Russell Redding in a news release said water restrictions proposed by the DEP do not apply to farms and advised farmers to be prepared to take advantage of crop insurance in extreme weather. “Water is essential for growing food. Voluntary restrictions do not apply to farms and other businesses that rely on it to produce food,” Redding said. “Risks and volatility in farming are weather-related more than in any other business. Pennsylvania’s beneficial natural average rainfall has been upended by weather extremes and unpredictability in recent years, and 2024 is no exception.\" While a dry fall can make harvesting grown crops easier, at this point all farmers can do is hope for a change in the weather to fortify the next season. “Pray for rain, really,” Graybill said. “That’s all you can really do, unfortunately.”",

Por Alan Alberdi\nEl próximo Clásico Nacional entre América y Chivas no solo será especial por la histórica rivalidad entre ambos equipos, sino también por un cambio inesperado en el escenario. Debido a las obras de remodelación en el Estadio Azteca, el enfrentamiento se jugará en el Estadio Ciudad de los Deportes.\nEste movimiento no tiene conformes a los aficionados del América, ya que el ingreso no tiene las comodidades que tenía el Coloso de Santa Úrsula . La cuenta oficial de las Águilas confirmó los costos que tendrán los boletos para el próximo Clásico Nacional y en redes sociales no reaccionaron de buena manera.\nver también\nEl inesperado premio para Cade Cowell gracias a su buen rendimiento en Chivas\n¿La peor pesadilla del América? Chivas puede ser local en el Ciudad de los Deportes El malestar con el inmueble elegido y los altos precios se suman al mal momento que vive el América en el Apertura 2024 , donde ha tenido un decepcionante inicio a pesar de tener una de las plantillas más potentes de la Liga MX.\nTodos estos factores pueden llevar a que la peor pesadilla americanista se haga realidad en el próximo Clásico Nacional: la de ver cómo el Estadio Ciudad de los Deportes se pinte de rojiblanco , algo que comúnmente ocurre cuando el Rebaño Sagrado sale de Guadalajara.\n¿Chivas será local en el Estadio Ciudad de Deportes? (Imago7) Chivas tiene la posibilidad de aprovechar todo este contexto para intentar darle un golpe anímico a su eterno rival, profundizando así su crisis. La afición rojiblanca, además, es conocida por su lealtad y capacidad para llenar estadios, por lo que podría hacer sentir su presencia en el Ciudad de los Deportes generando un clima positivo a pesar de ser visitantes.\nEl mal momento del América y la baja de Diego Valdés Las Águilas atraviesan un momento delicado en el Apertura 2024, con solo dos victorias y cuatro derrotas , incluyendo la última goleada sufrida por 4-1 frente a Cruz Azul en la jornada pasada, la cual resultó inaceptable para la afición y el propio cuerpo técnico.\nValdés se lesionó ante Cruz Azul y no llegaría al Clásico Nacional (Imago7) Para peor, a esta situación se le suma la baja de Diego Valdés, una de las figuras del equipo y quien siempre le genera muchos problemas a Chivas. El chileno sufrió una lesión en uno de sus hombros y causó baja con su selección de cara a la fecha FIFA, pero además se perdería el Clásico Nacional.\nAlan Alberdi Licenciado y Profesor en Comunicación Social, egresado en la Universidad Nacional de La Plata (UNLP).

    "title": "The next solar cycle – Solar Cycle 26 – is already beginning",
    "text": "View at EarthSky Community Photos . | Mario Rana in Hampton, Virginia, captured this filtered image of the sun on July 17, 2024. Thank you, Mario! According to new research, the next solar cycle is already beginning, despite the fact that the sun’s only halfway through its current cycle. The sun is at the peak of Solar Cycle 25 . We’re at solar maximum, when the sun has the most sunspots, flares and coronal mass ejections. You might also say that we’re “halfway through” Solar Cycle 25. Yet researchers announced this week they already see Solar Cycle 26 beginning . Using helioseismology – a study of the sun via its oscillations (mostly caused by sound waves driven by convection near the sun’s surface) – the researchers can see a pattern of bands moving toward the sun’s equator along with the sunspots. These bands what they’ve seen at the beginning of past solar cycles. So, these researchers say, we’re seeing the first traces of Solar Cycle 26 . Meanwhile, Solar Cycle 25 rages on, with a very active sun expected in the coming several years. The sun will die down in activity later in this decade. And the new cycle won’t officially start until around 2030. Solar physicist C. Alex Young of Goddard Spaceflight Center – part of the team that produces EarthSky’s daily sun news post – had this to say about the announcement:\nSo, even now as we’re now observing the greatest number of sunspots in Solar Cycle 25 so far, researchers are detecting the barest beginnings of Solar Cycle 26. It’s exciting to see this work. Extended and overlapping solar cycles were first brought to the attention of the solar community by P.R. Wilson of the University of Sydney in the late 1980s. Nowadays, one can use the technique of helioseismology – the study of what are, essentially, sound waves inside the sun – to begin to get to the physics.\nAnd, thanks to NASA’s SOHO and SDO sun-observing spacecraft, we are currently amassing the necessary data to observe and understand our billion-year-old star’s short-but-critical 11- and 22-year cycles.\nBelow is the announcement of the start of Solar Cycle 26, observed via helioseismology, from the Royal Astronomical Society on July 18, 2024. Edits by EarthSky.\nThe next solar cycle is already beginning Scientists have detected the first rumblings of the sun’s next 11-year solar cycle in sound waves inside our home star … even though it is only halfway through its current one.\nThis existing cycle is now at its peak, or solar maximum . Solar maximum is when the sun’s magnetic field flips and its poles swap places. This solar max will continue until mid-2025.\nSolar max affects activity on the sun’s surface. Sunspots, flares and coronal mass ejections are all more rampant at solar maximum. This leads to a surge in electromagnetic energy hurtling toward Earth, making auroras visible more often and at lower altitudes.\nThe current solar cycle – Cycle 25 – started in 2019. It has the name Cycle 25 because it’s the 25th since 1755, when extensive recording of solar sunspot activity began.\nSpotting the beginnings of Cycle 26 It is not expected to end for another six years, but researchers have spotted the first signs that the next solar cycle is beginning. Researchers from the University of Birmingham presented their findings at the Royal Astronomical Society’s National Astronomy Meeting in Hull on July 18, 2024.\nAstronomers use the sun’s internal sound waves to measure how it rotates, making visible a pattern of bands (solar torsional oscillation) that rotate slightly faster or slower. These move toward the sun’s equator and its poles during the activity cycle.\nThe faster-rotation belts tend to show up before the next solar cycle officially begins.\nDr. Rachel Howe of the University of Birmingham and her international collaborators have discovered a faint indication that the next solar cycle is starting to show up in the data they have been analyzing from the rotation bands. Howe said:\nIf you go back one solar cycle – 11 years – on the plot, you can see something similar that seems to join up with the shape that we saw in 2017. It went on to be a feature of the present solar cycle, Cycle 25.\nWe’re likely seeing the first traces of Cycle 26, which won’t officially start until about 2030.\nUsing helioseismic data to see inside the sun Astronomers have been studying solar torsional oscillation signals using helioseismic data from the Global Oscillation Network Group ( GONG ), the Michelson Doppler Imager ( MDI ) onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, and the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager ( HMI ) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory since 1995.\nThe data now covers the first four years of Solar Cycles 23, 24 and 25. This allows researchers to compare the rising phases of these cycles.\nHowe has been following the changes in the sun’s rotation for about 25 years, when scientists only had a portion of data from Solar Cycle 23 from GONG and MDI.\nThey could see the pattern of faster-moving material drifting toward the equator along with the sunspots. Since then, they have watched the pattern repeat (but not exactly) as Cycle 24 came and went and again as Cycle 25 grew. Howe said:\nIt’s exciting to see the first hint that the pattern will repeat again in Cycle 26, which is due to start in about six years.\nWith more data, I hope we can understand more about the part these flows play in the intricate dance of plasma and magnetic fields that form the solar cycle.\nBottom line: Astronomers using helioseismology have peered into the sun to see a pattern indicating the next solar cycle – Solar Cycle 26 – is already beginning.",

Jim Pillen spent Christmas in the hospital, as Nebraska Medicine doctors finished up another surgery overnight after he was bucked off a horse.\nIt’s hard to say if the governor will remain in the hospital into the new year. [Pillen was hospitalized](https://www.1011now.com/2024/12/23/governor-transported-unmc-following-fall-horse/) after getting bucked off a new horse he was breaking in Sunday on a ride with his daughter, his son-in-law, and his granddaughter on family land near Columbus.\nThe governor’s [trauma doctors](https://www.wowt.com/2024/12/23/doctors-give-update-gov-pillens-condition-after-accident/) said he wanted to go home the next night, that he was already walking the halls working to recover, but they cautioned that the big uncertainty was whether or not his breathing would be impacted by his seven broken ribs. Pillen, who is 68, opted to get surgery to help that.\nThen on [Wednesday night](https://www.wowt.com/2024/12/25/gov-pillen-undergoes-procedure-christmas-day-after-horse-riding-accident/), Pillen received what’s known as “rib fixation” — a four-hour procedure in which surgeons stabilize broken ribs with metal plates, with the goal of easing pain, promoting stronger long-term healing, and limiting future complications.\nAround 2 a.m. Thursday, the governor’s team sent First Alert 6 a statement calling the second surgery a success, and included that there have been no new issues with Pillen’s bruised kidney, punctured lung or damaged spleen suffered in the accident.\nThe statement also said that Gov. Pillen will remain in the hospital for “several more days” as he continues to recover so the doctors can watch for any surprises.\n—\nGet a first alert on breaking news delivered to your inbox.
