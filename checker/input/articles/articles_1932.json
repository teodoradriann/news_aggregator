    "title": "RBI should target headline CPI as high food inflation persists: Economists",
    "text": "Notwithstanding the Economic Survey 2023-24 making a pitch for an inflation targeting “excluding food”, Reserve Bank of India governor Shaktikanta Das on Wednesday said the Monetary Policy Committee can’t afford to do so “in (the current) environment of persisting high food inflation.” He, however, added that the RBI-MPC may “look through high food inflation if it is transitory.”\nEconomists who FE spoke to on Thursday said that as high food inflation “adversely affects” households inflation expectations, and subsequently underlying (core) inflation, it’s only logical for the Reserve Bank of India to target the headline CPI inflation rate, which includes the food component, for its monetary policy actions.\nThe MPC has to remain “vigilant” to prevent spillovers or second round effects from persistent food inflation and preserve the gains made so far in monetary policy credibility, the governor added.\nGarima Kapoor, economist, Elara Securities said that food prices tend to have a 60% correlation with households’ inflation expectations, suggesting “one cannot ignore food prices in setting monetary policy decisions”.\nAlso, calculation shows that every 1% increase in food inflation impacts core inflation by 15-18 bps. “One can certainly make a case for a reduced weight for food prices in the CPI basket in line with changing consumption dynamics, but completely eliminating food prices from RBI’s reaction function would be incorrect,” said Kapoor.\nDas said that persistently high food inflation and unanchored inflation expectations – if they materialise – could lead to spillovers to core inflation through pick-up in wages on cost-of-living considerations. “This, in turn, could be passed on by firms in the form of higher prices for services as well as goods, especially in a scenario of strong aggregate demand,” he said while adding that these behavioural changes can then result in overall inflation becoming sticky, even after food inflation recedes.\nAlso Read RBI MPC meet: Here are 4 areas of concern outlined by Governor Shaktikanta Das It is appropriate to have headline inflation as target for monetary policy rather than core inflation for all the reasons the Governor mentioned, and to manage the fiscal and supply side appropriately, noted Abhishek Upadhyay, senior economist, ICICI Securities Primary Dealership.\nSakshi Gupta, principal economist, HDFC Bank said that food inflation has stayed above the 6% mark, with certain items like cereals and pulses also seeing double digits inflation, for more than a year. Any continued persistence in food inflation is a risk for household expectations, which is being highlighted by the Governor.\nThe Economic Survey had said that higher food prices are, more often, not demand-induced but supply-induced, while short-run monetary policy tools are meant to counteract price pressures arising out of excess aggregate demand growth, it noted. Therefore, “deploying them to deal with inflation caused by supply constraints may be counterproductive,” the survey had noted.\nAs per the extant framework, introduced in 2016, the RBI is mandated to keep CPI inflation at 4%, with a margin of 2% on either side. Currently, the headline print stands at 5.08% (June); and for the full fiscal year FY25, it’s projected to average 4.5%.\nAlso Read Real GDP growth for current fiscal at 7.2%: RBI Food inflation, based on the Consumer Food Price Index (CFPI), stood at 9.36% in June, and stayed above the 6%-mark for 12 straight months. In FY24, food inflation had averaged 7.5%, and so far in Q1, it has averaged 8.9%. The headline rate, on the other hand, averaged 5.4% and 4.9%, in the respective periods. Core inflation, however, has been hovering around 3% since January.\nGupta said that unless the share of food drastically reduces in the CPI basket from the current level (of 40%), there is a weak case of excluding food from the inflation targeting regime.",

    "text": "MLSD celebrates inaugural graduation of Digital Learning Center\nMOSES LAKE — The Moses Lake School District marked a historic milestone May 4, as the Digital Learning Center proudly held its inaugural graduation ceremony at Lions Field. The school has had two other graduating classes, but they have been previously combined with Moses Lake High School.\nThe event celebrated the academic achievements of the first graduating class, comprising a diverse group of students who had successfully completed their high school education through innovative digital learning methods.\nAttended by family, friends, educators and community members, the ceremony featured heartfelt speeches, reflections on personal growth, and acknowledgments of the challenges faced throughout the academic year.\n“Your accomplishment marks not only a personal achievement but also the promise of a new beginning,” said Superintendent Carol Lewis during her opening remarks, emphasizing the importance of community support and perseverance throughout the students’ educational journeys.\nThe evening was a tribute to the faculty and staff who guided the graduates over the years, particularly during a challenging final year. Lewis acknowledged the steadfast dedication of counselors and faculty members.\n“Without their belief in your potential and their unwavering support, this graduation would not have been possible,” she said.\nKeynote speaker Veronica “Ronnie” Roylance, a staff member known for her caring approach to students, shared insights about personal growth and resilience. In a candid address, she addressed the common uncertainties faced by graduates regarding their future paths.\n“It’s perfectly normal to feel unsure about your next steps. Remember that life is not a race; it’s a journey filled with valuable lessons,” she said, encouraging students to embrace their unique paths with confidence.\nThe ceremony also highlighted the achievements of students who participated in various programs, including the Seal of Biliteracy, Running Start and vocational training initiatives.\nAs graduates were called to the stage to receive their diplomas, applause erupted from the audience, reflecting pride and encouragement.\nIn closing, Lewis commended the graduates for their resilience and echoed the sentiments of unity within the community.\n“Together, we celebrate not just your graduation, but the bonds formed and memories created here at the Digital Learning Center,” she said.\nAfter the ceremony, graduates exited the field in celebration, ready to embark on their next adventures as proud representatives of their school and community.",

Fue precisamente el ingreso de esta última el que puso a temblar al resto de los participantes no solo por su trayectoria y reconocimiento internacional, también por su belleza.\nCon respecto a las expectativas sobre el recibimiento de sus compañeros, la famosa aseguró que no se lo tomaría personal si este no fuera el más “amistoso”, pues ya se encuentran en un nivel avanzado de la competencia.\n“No creo que vaya a ser demasiado amistoso. Creo que va haber un poco de reacción porque llevan bastantes semanas adentro y que lleguen nuevos habitantes… no creo que estén tan contentos”, contó a Jimena Gállego minutos antes de entrar.\nSi bien la reacción de sus compañeros se mantuvo hermética, hubo alguien que no pudo evitar contener su emoción: Lupillo Rivera. Y es que los gestos del cantante llamaron la atención de la audiencia, pues estos denotaron su sorpresa y nerviosismo al ver entrar a la actriz\n¿La razón de dicho nerviosismo? Desde hace varios meses, ambos famosos se vieron involucrados en una ola de especulaciones sobre un posible romance. No obstante, se dieron el tiempo de mandar a callar los rumores argumentando que lo único que existía entre ellos era una amistad. Por su parte, el hermano de Jenni Rivera la llenó de halagos e indicó que no tenía el placer de conocerla.\nGabriel Soto reacciona al ingreso de Geraldine Bazán a “La Casa de los Famosos”\nUna de las reacciones que más se hizo esperar fue la de su ex pareja, el actor Gabriel Soto, con quien procreó dos hijas durante su matrimonio. Al respecto, contó que la despedida entre Geraldine Bazán y su hija menor, Miranda del 10 años, fue muy difícil.\n“Trataré de controlar que no vean mucho, evidentemente a través de mi hay una persona del proyecto que es el vínculo entre la comunicación de ella y mis hijas por cualquier cosa. Tratar que vean lo menos posible, ellas saben que es un reality… un proyecto complejo“, expresó ante los medios de comunicación.\nGabriel Soto evitó revelar “de más” durante la entrevista, pero aseguró que la decisión de ingresar a “La Casa de los Famosos” no fue tomada a la ligera: “Ella es adulta, y sabe perfectamente que está expuesta a que mis hijas vean el contenido del programa“.\nSeguir leyendo:\n•\nVideo: Así es la casa que dejó Geraldine Bazán para entrar a ‘La Casa de los Famosos 4’\n•\nGeraldine Bazán confiesa si ya tiene nuevo galán\n•\nDesde las alturas, Geraldine Bazán presume su figura enfundada en un look playero",

    "text": "13/09/2024 - 8:59 Funcionários da Boeing na região de Seattle, noroeste dos Estados Unidos, votaram em massa a favor de uma greve nesta sexta-feira (13) e rejeitaram o novo acordo da gigante da aviação, que se declarou “comprometida” com as negociações apesar de sua difícil situação financeira. O acordo foi rejeitado com 94,6% dos votos e a greve aprovada com 96%, disse Jon Holden, presidente do sindicato ‘International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751’. “Nossos membros falaram claramente esta noite”, disse o líder deste sindicato que representa mais de 30 mil trabalhadores da fabricante aeronáutica nesta região. “Começaremos a greve à meia-noite”, disse ele. O protesto afetará duas grandes montadoras no estreito de Puget Sound e paralisará a produção dos aviões 737, 777 e 767, cujas entregas já estão atrasadas. Isto representa um problema adicional à fabricante que recebe a maior parte do pagamento (cerca de 60%) quando a aeronave é entregue. Apesar da votação esmagadora a favor da greve, o grupo Boeing afirmou em um comunicado que está “comprometido” com as negociações. “Continuamos empenhados em restabelecer nossa relação com nossos colaboradores e com o sindicato e estamos prontos para voltar à mesa de negociações para chegar a um novo acordo”, afirmou a empresa. Segundo analistas da TD Cowen, uma greve de 50 dias privaria a Boeing de entre 3 bilhões e 3,5 bilhões de dólares (16,9 a 19,79 bilhões de reais) em liquidez e teria um impacto de 5,5 bilhões de dólares (31,10 bilhões de reais) nas receitas. A proposta inicial previa um aumento salarial de 25% ao longo de quatro anos e a promessa de investimentos nesta região. Previa também a construção da próxima aeronave, anunciada para 2035, na região de Seattle, berço histórico da fabricante, que deverá garantir empregos para as próximas décadas. Porém, os trabalhadores consideraram que o acordo não era tão generoso e apontaram, por exemplo, que o aumento de 25% era ilusório porque, ao mesmo tempo, cortava um bônus anual. “Estão falando de um aumento de 25% e esse não é o caso”, disse Paul Janousek, eletricista da fábrica em Everett que votou pela greve. Janousek, de 55 anos e há 13 anos na Boeing, estima que o aumento seria de 9% com a eliminação do bônus anual. A greve ocorre em um contexto delicado para a Boeing, cuja reputação foi manchada por vários incidentes de segurança aérea. A fabricante enfrenta uma situação econômica complicada após os acidentes de dois 737 MAX 8 em 2018 e 2019, que tiraram a vida a 346 pessoas, além de vários outros problemas. “Não é segredo que nosso negócio está passando por um momento difícil, em parte devido aos nossos próprios erros do passado. (…) Uma greve colocaria em risco a nossa recuperação”, alertou Kelly Ortberg, CEO da empresa desde agosto. jmb/sw/dbh/jm/es/jc/fp",
