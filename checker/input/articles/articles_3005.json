    "text": "Power outages in parts of south-east Queensland were expected to last nearly a week after deadly wild weather cut supplies and weather conditions remained hot and stormy.\nTens of thousands of people on the Gold Coast and other regions south of Brisbane were expected to be without electricity on the New Year weekend after damage caused by storms that lashed a vast swath of Australia’s east coast starting around Christmas.\nStorms cut power in south-east Queensland.\nMaking things worse, the region was due to be hit by a heatwave that forecasters said would extend across northern Australia and could bring temperatures in the 40s.\nWinton in Queensland’s west is expecting 43 degrees on Friday, while temperatures of up to 37 degrees were forecast for Gympie in the storm-ravaged south-east and 36 degrees in Brisbane, the Bureau of Meteorology said.\nIn the Northern Territory, it was predicted to reach 40 degrees in Katherine and 43 degrees in Tennant Creek, while at Marble Bar in Western Australia’s Pilbara region 49 degrees was expected.\nAdvertisement Seven people died in Queensland as wild weather lashed the south-east, including at least people caught in stormwater drains. In Victoria, two people were killed by falling branches and a third drowned in flash flooding after wild weather lashed the state around Christmas.\nFederal Disaster and Emergency Management Minister Murray Watt said south-east Queensland residents should look out for neighbours who were elderly or living with disability.\n“If you have fans or air conditioning available and have got the power on, today is the day to use it,” Senator Watt said on Thursday.\n“If you don’t have that, today is the day to think about using those public libraries, public pools, other spaces to stay safe.”\nMore than 120,000 homes and businesses lost power during extreme rain, lightning and wind.\nQueensland Energy Minister Mick de Brenni said 63 per cent of customers without power since Monday and Tuesday’s “unprecedented” storms now had their services restored, and officials aimed to increase that rate to 80 per cent by Saturday.\nAdvertisement But more than 43,000 people were still without power on Thursday afternoon.\nHealth Minister Shannon Fentiman said this was “incredibly concerning”, with high temperatures expected over the coming days.\n“Use a cold towel or if there is power on at the local library or at a shopping centre, go there and just keep your temperature down if you’re starting to experience some signs and symptoms of heat stress,” she said.\nThe Gold Coast council announced its pools would be open and made free on Friday during the extreme heat.\nAAP\nSave Log in or Subscribe to save article\nShare Introducing your Newsfeed\nFollow the topics, people and companies that matter to you.\nFind out more\nRead More Extreme weather\nGold Coast\nClimate crisis\nSponsored Advertisement Latest In Energy Fetching latest articles\nMost Viewed In Companies",

    "text": "清明假期要开始了，此时草木萌动，满城春色，正是扫墓祭祖、踏青赏春的时节。如果闲暇之余，您还没有想好去哪里，正在国家博物馆对公众展出的“九天揽月——中国探月工程20年”展览是一个不错的选择↓↓↓\n石头做的国旗、月球的挖土工具、月球正反面的月壤等，这些记录中国探月工程成就的实物。在本次展览上，上百件珍贵实物与图文史料首度集体亮相，系统展示了中国探月工程所走过的月球探测之路。\n展览中，全球首次对比展出月球正面、背面样品，上百件珍贵实物与图文史料首度集体亮相。同时，展览以“科技+科普、成就+文化”为主线，围绕工程历史背景、研制历程、主要成就、未来任务等，以实物实证与历史档案相结合的叙事方式，展示中国探月工程自2004年立项以来，以“绕、落、回”三步走战略为引领，走出一条高质量高效益的月球探测之路。\n除了已经展出的成就之外，中国探月工程还有哪些最新的进展？记者就此专访了中国探月工程总设计师、中国工程院院士吴伟仁。\n中国探月工程总设计师、中国工程院院士吴伟仁：20年来，我们能够把月球背面的样品采回来，这是首次，我们第一个在月球背面着陆，这是世界首次，而且我们在地月拉格朗日L2点和日地拉格朗日L2点都分别部署了中继星，这在世界上也是第一次。\n从“嫦娥一号”开启中国深空探测篇章，到“嫦娥三号”携“玉兔号”月球车首次烙下中国月面印记，从突破月背中继通信技术架设地月“鹊桥”，到“嫦娥五号”携月壤凯旋。工程研制团队一条龙攻关攻坚，一张蓝图绘到底，一步步实现从“跟跑”“并跑”到部分“领跑”，走出了有中国特色的探月之路。我们在科学发现、技术创新、工程实施、产业带动、国际合作等多方面取得了系统性成果。\n中国探月工程总设计师、中国工程院院士吴伟仁：我们是起步晚，但是我们起点高，是我们采用了最新的技术。第二个是我们发射次数少，但是我们成功率很高，达到了100%，第三个特点就是我们国家投入少、产出多，获得了一系列世界上首次的成果。\n吴伟仁表示，中国探月工程实现了“三不一超”——20年来技术指标不降，经费不超，进度不拖，超额完成了任务。现在嫦娥七号任务进展顺利，预计在2026年前后发射，将对月球南极环境和水冰资源进行勘察探测。\n嫦娥八号预计在2028年前后发射，将开展月面科学试验和资源开发利用技术验证。嫦娥八号的另一项重要工作就是尝试开展在月球上建造建筑的试验，在月球上就地取材建造“广寒宫”已经不再是神话。\n中国探月工程总设计师、中国工程院院士吴伟仁：当前，已开展研制第一台在月球“打砖”的机器。它可以把太阳能聚集起来工作，产生1400至1500摄氏度的高温把月壤熔融。这样可以“就地取材”，通过3D打印技术将月壤“打印”成不同规格的“月壤砖”，这样的话不需要地上带水去，不需要带其他配方配料去，完全是就地取材。\n作为探月工程20年系列活动的首站，本次展览为期2个月。后续，还将启动探月精神宣讲、全国巡展等系列活动。",

    "text": "Researchers have figured out how to grow tomatoes that consume less water without compromising the yield, quality, or taste, Phys.org [reported](https://phys.org/news/2024-01-crispr-technology-succeed-tomatoes-consume.html). The researchers used something called CRISPR [technology](https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/) to genetically alter the tomato plants to be able to grow them more efficiently. Their findings were [published](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2309006120) in the scientific journal PNAS. … To create tomatoes that required less water — especially important in the face of increasingly [frequent and intense droughts](https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/drought-resistant-grains-morocco-icarda/) — the scientists removed a gene called ROP9, which functions as a switch that toggles the plants between an active and inactive state. By removing that switch, the tomato plants’ stomata remained partially closed during the day, allowing them to retain more water. “There is great similarity between the ROP9 in tomatoes and ROP proteins found in other crop plants such as pepper, eggplant, and wheat. Therefore, the discoveries detailed in our article could form the basis for the development of additional crop plants with enhanced water use efficiency, and for a deeper understanding of the mechanisms behind stomatal opening and closing,” [said](https://phys.org/news/2024-01-crispr-technology-succeed-tomatoes-consume.html#google_vignette) Dr. Nir Sade, one of the researchers.",

    "text": "CNN - Spanish Rescatan a 31 trabajadores tras el colapso parcial de un túnel en Los Ángeles, dicen las autoridades By CNN Newsource Published July 10, 2025 2:18 AM Por Kathleen Magramo, CNN\nTreinta y una personas que trabajaban en un enorme túnel subterráneo en Los Ángeles fueron rescatadas el miércoles por la noche después de que una parte de la estructura se derrumbara, dijeron las autoridades.\nLos rescatados no tenían lesiones visibles, dijo el Departamento de Bomberos de Los Ángeles en un comunicado , poco después de una operación en la que varios de los atrapados en el túnel industrial fueron sacados a un lugar seguro con una grúa.\nMás de 100 bomberos del Departamento de Bomberos de Los Ángeles acudieron rápidamente a la escena en el vecindario de Wilmington de la ciudad para ayudar en la operación, incluidos los equipos de búsqueda y rescate urbano, dijo la alcaldesa de Los Ángeles, Karen Bass, en X.\nEl derrumbe se produjo aproximadamente a 8 a 10 punto de entrada y salida del túnel y a unos 121 metros bajo tierra, según informaron las autoridades. El túnel forma parte de un proyecto municipal de aguas residuales.\nLos trabajadores atrapados lograron trepar un montón de tierra suelta de entre 3,6 y 4,5 metros de altura para alcanzar a sus compañeros al otro lado, según informes preliminares. Desde allí, fueron transportados en un vehículo de túnel hasta el punto de acceso, según el departamento de bomberos.\nLos bomberos utilizaron grúas y jaulas de rescate para sacar a varios trabajadores, según un video de la afiliada de CNN, KCBS/KCAL .\nLa alcaldesa de Los Ángeles, Karen Bass, se reunió con los trabajadores rescatados y los servicios de emergencia en el lugar, según un video publicado en su cuenta X. “Gracias nuevamente a todos nuestros socorristas que trabajan para poner a salvo a los angelinos”, dijo Bass.\nLa falla ocurrió cuando los trabajadores estaban operando la tuneladora y una sección que ya habían construido se derrumbó debido al “apretamiento del suelo”, dijo Robert Ferrante, ingeniero jefe y gerente general de los Distritos de Saneamiento del Condado de Los Ángeles, en una conferencia de prensa el miércoles por la noche.\nEl aplastamiento del suelo se produce cuando el suelo o la tierra se deforma significativamente durante una excavación.\nLos trabajos en el lugar se detendrán y serán inspeccionados, agregó Ferrante, pero no dio detalles sobre cuánto tiempo tomará.\nLa supervisora ​​​​de la Junta del Condado de Los Ángeles, Janice Hahn, dijo que el incidente sirve como recordatorio de los riesgos que implican estos proyectos y que los distritos de saneamiento “investigarían” qué causó el incidente.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

    "text": "Los ocho sindicatos que representan a la función pública han enviado una carta conjunta al nuevo primer ministro en la que exigen aumentos salariales y la suspensión de la reforma de las pensiones. Los ocho sindicatos que representan a la función pública pidieron este viernes a Michel Barnier que suspenda la última reforma de las pensiones y proceda “rápidamente” a los aumentos salariales, en una carta conjunta al nuevo primer ministro. “Esperamos que todos los empleados del sector público vean aumentar rápidamente sus salarios, en particular mediante un aumento del valor del punto índice”, el mecanismo utilizado para calcular el salario base de los funcionarios, escriben la CGT, la FO, la CFDT, la Unsa, la FSU, Solidaires, la CFE-CGC y la FA-FP. Tras más de diez años de congelación, el gobierno había aumentado el salario mínimo un 3,5% en 2022 y un 1,5% en 2023. Estos aumentos fueron considerados insuficientes por los sindicatos, en un contexto en el que la inflación media rondaba el 5% en 2022 y 2023. Además, “esperamos que la reforma de las pensiones de 2023”, que aumentó la edad legal de jubilación de 62 a 64 años pese a la oposición unánime de los sindicatos, “se suspenda para iniciar nuevos debates”, prosiguen los firmantes. Solicitud de mantenimiento de un ministerio a tiempo completo Los sindicatos piden finalmente “el mantenimiento de un ministerio pleno de la función pública” en el futuro gobierno, en lugar de un simple ministerio delegado o una secretaría de Estado. Para ellos, se trata de una condición “indispensable” pero no “suficiente” para un “diálogo social de calidad para responder a los retos de los servicios públicos en nuestro país y a las expectativas de 5,5 millones de agentes públicos”. En el gobierno que dimite, Stanislas Guerini estaba al frente de un Ministerio de Transformación y Función Pública de pleno derecho. Michel Barnier, nombrado primer ministro el 5 de septiembre, se ha comprometido a formar su gobierno la semana próxima.",
