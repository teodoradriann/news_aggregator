    "text": "Dark areas have best chance to see Northern Lights, expert says. PHOENIX (AZFamily) — Some Arizonans were treated to a light show on Friday night, as a geomagnetic storm caused the northern lights to shine bright colors in the sky. The lights were seen as the NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center issued a geomagnetic storm watch for the first time since 2005. View of the aurora borealis, also known as the northern lights, may continue for the next several nights as well. Viewers posted photos of the northern lights on AZFamily’s First Alert Weather page of a pink and purple glow in the sky that could be seen from areas like Show Low, Prescott, Sun City West and Queen Creek. This watch has been issued because something called a coronal mass ejection (CME) was released from the sun earlier this week. So, how does this cause a geomagnetic storm? Arizona’s Family spoke with Katrina Bossert, assistant professor in the Arizona State University School of Earth and Space Exploration, who said the CME causes the “Earth’s magnetic field to be displaced” and that you can “end up with these magnetic field lines causing material to be thrown towards the earth’s atmosphere.” While the best views will be at northern latitudes, Bossert said Arizona may be treated to a light show as well. “If you look to the north, you may be able to see some red aurora on the horizon,” she said. “If it’s really strong, you may be able to see some green aurora on the horizon.” She also suggests being in a dark area for the best possible chance of a good view. While geomagnetic storms have been known to affect the Earth’s power grid, Bossert said that’s more likely to happen more in northern latitudes. Even though this type of impact is unlikely in Arizona, “it is still something to look out for,” Bossert said.

    "text": "Um novo relatório do Observatório do Clima divulgado nesta quinta-feira, 7, aponta que o Brasil registrou uma redução de 12% nas emissões de gases de efeito estufa em comparação com o ano anterior, totalizando 2,3 bilhões de toneladas de CO2 equivalente (GtCO2e). Essa diminuição é a maior desde 2009 e está principalmente relacionada ao menor desmatamento da Amazônia, que contribuiu para uma queda de 37% nas emissões provenientes da floresta tropical. Contudo, o desmatamento em outros biomas aumentou – com destaque para o crescimento de 86% no Pantanal -, o que favorece a emissão de gases tóxicos, representando um desafio contínuo para o cumprimento das metas climáticas do país.\nA agropecuária segue sendo a maior responsável pelas emissões, com 46% do total, sendo a fermentação entérica do rebanho bovino uma das principais fontes. O setor agropecuário, além de enfrentar desafios relacionados à mitigação das emissões de metano, continua a registrar aumentos nos gases poluentes, principalmente devido à ampliação do rebanho e ao uso de fertilizantes e calcário.\nEm relação aos setores de energia e resíduos, houve variação modesta nas emissões, com destaque para o setor de transportes, que registrou um salto de 3,2% devido ao crescimento no consumo de combustíveis fósseis. Além disso, as emissões de queimadas também apresentaram diminuição, mas o risco de incêndios em áreas de vegetação nativa continua a crescer com as mudanças climáticas.",

    "text": "The Department of History and Theory of Fine Arts at the Faculty of Decorative and Applied Arts of the State Academy of Arts of Turkmenistan is actively involved in commemorating significant events and personalities in the history of national culture. This year, the department released a series of publications dedicated to important dates and anniversaries of outstanding figures in fine arts.\nFor instance, postcards with reproductions of the most famous works by Ayhan Hajiev, People's Artist of Turkmenistan, were issued for his 100th birthday. Among them is the canonical portrait of Magtymguly Fragi, which was recognized in 1947 as the best artistic embodiment of the great Turkmen poet's image.\nEach postcard offers a unique excursion into the history of Turkmen portrait painting, allowing viewers to appreciate Hajiev's distinctive works. The project author, Guljeren Mammedaliyeva, compiled key facts from the artist's biography in the publication, enabling not only enjoyment of his art but also a deeper study of his life path and contribution to art.\nMonumental works by Saragt Babaev, Hero of Turkmenistan, People's Artist of the country, two-time laureate of the Magtymguly International Prize, and honorary elder, were meticulously studied by future art historian Oguljan Dayyeva.\nThe series of informative postcards includes photographic images of monuments and sculptures created by this outstanding sculptor. One of his latest significant works is a giant statue of Magtymguly Fragi that adorned the foothills of Kopetdag during the 300th anniversary celebration of the poet's birth.\nEqually interesting are calendars, booklets, brochures and albums highlighting significant events in the life of the creative university. For example, following the \"Türkmen alabaýy\" exhibition-competition, a catalog with students' works was published. Among new publications is a booklet created from Persian painting master classes that concluded with an exhibition by students studying miniature, graphics and calligraphy.\n\"Our future art historians make great efforts to ensure that no event in the life of the country and the Academy goes unnoticed,\" says Ayjan Kadyrova, head of the Department of History and Theory of Fine Arts.\nYoung specialists independently develop concepts and designs for books, calendars and postcards, striving to convey not only visual but also informative context to readers. All these publications are added to the Academy's library so that future generations can study the stages of development of Turkmenistan's fine arts.\nThese days, a creative exhibition \"Gujurly ýaşlar\" (\"Energetic Youth\") is taking place at the gallery of the State Academy of Arts. It has become a true celebration for showcasing innovative art by young authors. Visitors can also explore printed materials created by talented art historians.",

    "text": "By Nicoco Chan, Xihao Jiang and Bernard Orr HANGZHOU, China (Reuters) – Mega-cities on China’s eastern coast are facing another spell of scorching heat as temperatures hovered around 40 Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) on Friday and prolonged extreme temperatures were expected to run into next week. The Shanghai Meteorological Center on Thursday issued the first red warning signal for high temperatures this year after the sprawling metropolis hit 40C, logging the 22nd day of temperatures over 40C since its Xujiahui weather station began tracking data in 1873. In nearby Hangzhou, officials issued a red warning early on Friday, with some areas in Shangcheng district, Binjiang district, Gongshu district, and Xihu district hitting 40C. A red warning is the most severe in a three-tiered warning temperature system. “It’s so hot, like fire falling from the sky,” said Wang, a 60-year-old tourist who travelled to Hangzhou from the cooler northern province of Hebei. “I’m sweating all over. There is wind but it is hot.” China recorded its hottest July in recent history on record, while July 22 was the hottest day ever recorded, according to the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service, which has tracked such global weather patterns since 1940. Chinese weather forecasters also issued warnings for high temperatures for many parts of the country with Anhui, Jiangsu, Hubei, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Fujian provinces, Chongqing and Shanghai expected to see temperatures around 37-39C, and some areas at 40C or higher. Treacherous heatwaves are becoming the norm in China as experts blame global climate changes for extreme weather conditions across the world. “It’s so hot and I am sweating all the time,” said Li Wen, a 22-year-old tourist visiting Shanghai. “Everyone is wearing sun protection shirts, holding parasols, and taking precautions against the sunshine.” The country is bearing through yet another summer of torrid heat and weather experts expect more hotter and longer heatwaves for the foreseeable future.

Es gibt Tote, eine Geiselnahme wird befürchtet.\nDie Hamas möchte nicht, dass die israelisch-amerikanische Hilfsorganisation Essen an die Palästinenser verteilt.GETTYIMAGES/Ayman Alhesi/Anadolu\nDie Tat zeigt einmal mehr das brutale Gesicht der Hamas: Im Gazastreifen sind nach Angaben der von den USA und Israel unterstützten Stiftung GHF mindestens fünf ihrer Helfer bei einem Angriff der islamistischen Terrororganisation Hamas getötet worden. Mehr als zwei Dutzend Mitarbeiter der Hilfsorganisation seien auf dem Weg zu einer Verteilstelle gewesen, als ihr Bus von der Hamas gegen 22.00 Uhr (Ortszeit, 21.00 Uhr MESZ) „brutal angegriffen” worden sei, erklärte die in Washington ansässige GHF am Mittwoch (Ortszeit).\nNach vorläufigen Erkenntnissen gebe es „mindestens fünf Todesopfer, zahlreiche Verletzte und die Befürchtung, dass einige unserer Teammitglieder als Geiseln genommen wurden”, hieß es.",

    "title": "\"The Worst Day of My Life\": Survivor of Tragedy in Dominican Nightclub Shares How They Managed to Escape",
    "text": "What was supposed to be a night of joy and music at the Jet Set nightclub in the Dominican Republic turned into a nightmare for attendees early Tuesday morning, when the ceiling of the venue collapsed during a concert by the renowned merengue artist Rubby Pérez.\nOne of the survivors of the tragedy is Cristóbal Moya, a man whose shocking image, injured, went viral on social media. However, he survived, though he has not hesitated to describe what he experienced as the worst day of his life.\n“The worst day of my life”, summarized the tough experience from the hospital where he is recovering.\n\"I was able to get out because I was at the same door. God gave me a second chance. That's how I see it,\" he stated in remarks to Univision.\nCristóbal Moya, like many others that night, was enjoying the festive atmosphere of the Jet Set.\nNothing seemed out of the ordinary until an unexpected signal marked the beginning of the disaster.\n“I saw the ceiling break, a panel, and it started to fall like fine sand, and I lost consciousness in an instant,” the man recounted to the mentioned news outlet.\nThe collapse left no time to react. According to accounts, he barely felt \"a hit to the back of the neck\" and fell to the ground, unconscious.\nWhen he woke up, he found himself trapped in the rubble, with unbearable pain and unable to move.\n“At that moment, it felt as if a heavy burden had fallen on me, but the burden landed on a piece of furniture and what it did was compress me. I was there with my knees to my chest, unable to move backward or forward, the weight from behind was too great,” he recounted.\nThe Good Samaritan\nIn the midst of chaos, dust, and the desperate cries of those who were injured or asking about their family members, Moya found a ray of hope: a voice amid the rubble.\n“There was a good Samaritan who came up to me and said, ‘don’t worry, I’ll get you out, what’s your name? My name is so-and-so, don’t worry, don’t worry’”, she said about the person who became her saving angel.\nMoya, still moved by his experience, now has a new concern: he has not been able to locate the three people he was with that night.\nA national tragedy\nThe collapse of the Jet Set has shocked the Dominican Republic. Authorities have declared three days of national mourning and have confirmed a preliminary toll of 124 dead and 155 injured.\nAccording to José Antonio Matos, Deputy Minister of Health, the incident occurred around 1 a.m., while the merengue concert was in full swing.\nRescue teams have been working tirelessly to remove debris and rescue trapped individuals, transferring the injured to various hospitals in the area.\nThe images shared from the scene are breathtaking: piles of collapsed concrete, emergency lights, and bodies covered, waiting for medical assistance.\nOutside the establishment, relatives have gathered, chanting songs of hope while waiting for news about their loved ones.\nOn social media, photographs and lists with the names of individuals who attended the event and have not yet been found have been shared.\nThe Public Health Network (SNS) has released lists of the injured along with the hospitals where they are being treated and has urgently requested blood donations. Additionally, a phone line, *462 option 3, has been set up to provide updated information about the injured.\nOne of the deceased in the tragedy was the singer Rubby Pérez, 68 years old. Another of the deceased is the former Major League Baseball player, Octavio Dotel.\nFrequently Asked Questions about the tragedy at Jet Set nightclub in the Dominican Republic\nWhat happened at the Jet Set nightclub in the Dominican Republic?\nIn the early hours of Tuesday, during a concert by merenguero Rubby Pérez, the roof of the Jet Set nightclub collapsed, causing a tragedy that left at least 124 dead and 155 injured. The collapse triggered scenes of chaos and shock among the attendees and the entire country.\nHow did Cristóbal Moya manage to survive the roof collapse?\nCristóbal Moya survived because he was near the exit door when the collapse occurred. Despite being trapped under the rubble, a good Samaritan helped him out, offering hope amidst the disaster.\nWhat was the reaction of the Dominican Republic government to the tragedy?\nThe president of the Dominican Republic, Luis Abinader, declared three days of national mourning and assured that the government is closely monitoring the situation.

    "title": "Independiente del Valle: El secreto detrás de su exitoso proceso de formativas",
    "text": "El Independiente del Valle, finalista de la Liga Pro 2024, no solo es un equipo exitoso en el campo de juego, sino una verdadera fábrica de talentos. Conocido por ser el club ecuatoriano que más futbolistas exporta al extranjero, su modelo de formación es el pilar que sostiene su proyecto deportivo y su identidad.\nLas divisiones formativas de IDV están diseñadas para identificar y desarrollar jóvenes promesas desde los 10 u 11 años. Con entrenadores distribuidos en todas las provincias del país, el club selecciona a los mejores talentos en torneos barriales, cantonales y locales.\nAquellos que llegan al complejo inician un proceso de prueba de hasta cuatro meses, permitiendo evaluar su potencial completo antes de ser admitidos.\nUna vez seleccionados, los jugadores reciben atención integral. Son sometidos a chequeos médicos y se les asigna un tutor académico, ya que la educación escolar es obligatoria.\nAdemás, residen en las instalaciones del club, con visitas programadas de sus familiares y monitoreo constante de su evolución física. Los padres de los jugadores destacados firman contratos de largo plazo con el club, asegurando su desarrollo y continuidad en el proceso.\nDe esta cantera que conquista al fútbol mundial han salido jugadores como Moisés Caicedo (Chelsea), Piero Hincapié (Bayer Leverkusen), Willian Pacho (PSG), entre otros.\nLa metodología formativa de IDV está dirigida por dos especialistas españoles, que han trabajado en grandes clubes como el Real Madrid y el Barcelona, además de los mejores clubes de Europa y Asia. Su enfoque no solo busca desarrollar habilidades futbolísticas, sino también formar seres humanos íntegros con valores sólidos.\nAndoni Bombín, jefe de scouting, dice que \"Independiente del Valle no envidia a ningún club europeo en cuanto proyecto e infraestructuras\".\nArkaits Mota es el director de formativas y señala que en tres años de trabajo en IDV, se han dado cuenta del potencial que hay en Esmeraldas, pero resalta que también han encontrado buenos prospectos en otras partes del país.\nEl modelo de juego es otro de los aspectos distintivos. Desde las categorías juveniles hasta los equipos profesionales, todos los planteles siguen un estilo definido: posesión de balón, solidez defensiva y prioridad al ataque. Este sello de identidad es lo que diferencia al club y lo posiciona como un referente.\nAdemás, las formativas de IDV participan frecuentemente en torneos internacionales, enfrentando a clubes de América, Europa y Asia. Esta experiencia fortalece a los jóvenes, quienes se convierten en la base de las selecciones nacionales Sub-15, Sub-17 y Sub-20, tanto en equipos masculinos como femeninos.\nUn ejemplo del éxito de este sistema es Junior Sornoza, quien llegó a IDV desde Portoviejo cuando era niño. Ahora, a sus 30 años, es capitán y referente del club. Sornoza jugó en importantes ligas de Brasil y México y, actualmente, su hijo también forma parte de las formativas del equipo.\nIndependiente del Valle sigue demostrando que su compromiso con el desarrollo integral de jóvenes talentos no solo beneficia al club, sino también al fútbol ecuatoriano y mundial. Con una metodología sólida y un enfoque humano, IDV continúa alimentando el sueño de cientos de niños y consolidándose como una cantera ejemplar.",
