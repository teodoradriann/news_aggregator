    "text": "Blue Jay girls can't catch Mandan, looking to the next one\nThe Jamestown High School basketball teams hosted Mandan on Jan. 30.\nJAMESTOWN — Traditionally, Jamestown has no problem finding success on the basketball court.\nJust look at the records.\nADVERTISEMENT\nBetween the Jamestown High School girls and boys programs, the Blue Jays have been to 16 State Championship games and have won nine of them.\nThat makes this year kind of — nontraditional.\nIn total, the Blue Jays have won four conference games. The Blue Jays girls most recent loss came on Thursday night against Mandan. Andy Skunberg and the Blue Jay girls dropped 71-30. The Blue Jay girls are now sitting at 3-8 in the West Region.\nThe Jays will host a doubleheader against St. Mary's on Tuesday. Tipoff for the girls is scheduled for 5:45 p.m. The boys game is set to follow at 7:45 p.m.\nIn a year like this, it may be easy for players, coaches and the community to lose heart.\nHow do you do that?\nFor one thing, focus on the positives, like the fact that there hasn't been very many injuries for either team.\nADVERTISEMENT\nOther than Mari Anderson, every member on the girls team, is healthy and injury free. Because of this, every one of them got to play on Thursday night.\nJamestown had eight scorers record points in the opening half. Senior Leah Trumbauer was the top scorer with four points.\nMandan came out hot and went on a 10-0 run before Trumbauer was sent to the line. The senior drained both shots and cut Mandan's lead to eight. Mandan controlled possession for the next several minutes to go up 14-3 with 10:49 left to play in the opening half.\nTrumbauer scored the Jays' first field goal with 10:30 gone in the first half. With the layup from the senior. the score stood at 18-6. Another positive came in the form of Haley Attleson. In the final minute, Attleson stole the ball and laid it in for two to make it 29-18 Braves entering the break.\nMandan was led by senior McKenna Johnson with 10 points. Johnson wound up leading all scorers with 14 points. Jamestown's Milan Martin and Adisyn Yunck led the Jays, both scoring seven points.\nThe Blue Jays almost had as many rebounds as they did points on Thursday, recording 28 total boards — another positive. Sophomore Hannah Attleson was credited with 12 of the team's rebounds.\nIt may be a bit of a tough year but the Blue Jays are improving, developing and on their way to winning some games on the hardwood.\nADVERTISEMENT\nSo chin up Blue Jays, good things are coming your way.\nMandan 71, Jamestown 30\nMAN 29 42 — 71\nJHS 18 12 — 30\nMAN — McKenna Johnson 14, Sarah Helderop 12, Ziah GreyBull 10, Mimi McAllister 8, Sierra Gustavsson 6, AnnaClaire Bugbee 6, Alli Reiner 5, Kaelynn Talley 3, Sapphire LaBlanc 3, Madyson Schwind 2, Anna Lyles 2. Totals: 29 FG, 10-14 FT, 16 fouls. 3-pointers: Talley 1, LaBlanc 1, McAllister 1.\nJHS — Milan Martin 7, Adisyn Yunck 7, Macey Neumiller 5, Leah Trumbauer 4, Amelia Newman 2, Haley Attleson 2, Claire Marker 2, Hannah Attleson 1.

    "text": "Another strong jobs report finished off a remarkably solid year for labor in 2023. Among the highlights: - Job growth continued. The Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows the U.S. economy once again beat expectations for jobs gains at 216,000 for December, the latest in a 36-month trend of growth. For 2023, job growth came in at 2.7 million, with an average monthly gain of 225,000. By comparison, 4.8 million jobs were added in 2022, with an average monthly gain of 399,000. - Unemployment remained low. The unemployment rate stayed steady at 3.7%, and rates are on a streak of 23 months below 4% — a stretch unseen since the late 1960s, Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows. - Wage growth remains elevated. Wage growth came in at 4.1% over the prior 12 months — that’s good news for workers, but higher than the Federal Reserve might like as it determines when it begins cutting rates in 2024. A tight labor market, falling inflation and persisting economic growth all form a strong economic picture heading into 2024. But high interest rates remain, as do elevated prices. NerdWallet spoke with Jared Bernstein, chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers to get his take on Friday's jobs report, consumer sentiment and the economic look ahead. The following interview has been edited for length and clarity. NerdWallet: In 2023, inflation fell, the labor market steadily cooled, we saw higher-than-expected GDP growth and avoided a recession. Many economists seem surprised that the Fed was able to ease inflation without tanking the job market or tipping us into a recession. Are you surprised at where we stand right now? Jared Bernstein: I wouldn't say I'm particularly surprised. And in fact, we've long argued publicly that the goal was to maintain the tight labor market while easing inflationary pressures. I think President Biden views that as a key way to both empower workers with the maintenance of the tight job market while giving families some breathing room with easing inflation and even some lower prices . Substantively, an important piece of this is recognizing that supply chain normalization and the improvement of the economy's supply side — whether it's logistical supply chains or the increase in labor supply — have also helped in that regard. And that's a good way to reduce inflationary pressures without dinging the demand side of the equation. NerdWallet: Last year, job gains were mainly in three areas: health care, government, as well as leisure and hospitality. How much of the 2023 job growth can we attribute to a rebound from the pandemic, and how much can we attribute to underlying economic growth? Jared Bernstein: I think by the time you're in 2023 a chunk of the rebounding is behind you. Certainly the biggest numbers. One way to think about this is that in '21 the average monthly job gain was 600,000 a month — so that's huge and it has some rebounding clearly embedded in it. And in '22 the analogous number that's the average monthly job growth was about 400,000. And in '23 it was around 200,000 and 225,000. So there's kind of a stepladder there that gets you more into a steady, stable growth path. I think by the time we got into '23, we really executed on the president's plan to maintain a tight job market and to get wages rising. That is such a key — real wages beating prices. Look, in an economy that's 70% consumer spending like this one, if American consumers are at the tail end of a strong job market and easing prices, rising real pay, that's a pretty good forward-motion machine. I think that's a lot of what we saw in '23. NerdWallet: So is there some economic vulnerability in having growth concentrated in so few sectors? Some of the more interest-rate-dependent industries, for example, have shown little to no growth. And other areas like transportation and warehousing that boomed during the pandemic are now seeing some decline. Jared Bernstein: Well, I get paid to worry about everything, so I'll never say, ‘Oh, nothing to see there,’ but I think that caution has been somewhat overplayed. Lots of industries created jobs. I think 70% of the industries contributed in '23, some more than others, as you say. If you think interest rates are more likely to be down than up next year, then that should be helpful to some of the interest rate-sensitive sectors that you mentioned, upwardly speaking. If I look at the sectors that did create the most jobs, some of them are very large and significant sectors — private services, for example. We saw some great manufacturing numbers this year, more in the first half than in the second half of the year. We also know that we had good construction numbers, and not so much in residential buildings, but more in nonresidential. And I think some of that really links up to factories that are being built. There's hundreds of billions of capital that's come in from the sidelines supported by the Inflation Reduction Act and the Chips Act. We're actively building manufacturing facilities in this country to stand up the domestic industry of chips with electric vehicles, batteries and that should lead to more manufacturing jobs once those factories come online. “ Executing on the president's agenda has led to a situation where things are looking a lot better than people thought they would. And I think as time goes on, we'll see more positive reporting when it comes to consumer sentiment.”Jared Bernstein, chair of the Council of Economic Advisers NerdWallet: I want to shift to consumer sentiment and approval of President Biden's economic management — both slumped for most of the year, but at least one recent poll shows that the tide may be turning in that respect. How do you understand the disparity between the economy's many objective strengths and consumer discontent? Jared Bernstein: Well, I think it takes some time for the dynamics that you and I have been talking about to reach into people's lives, and there's a consciousness deep enough that it shows up in some of these indices of confidence and sentiment. And that's why the December numbers, as you suggest, are a positive glimmer there. It's one month, so it's not a new trend, but the consumer confidence survey was up 10%; the University of Michigan sentiment survey was up a whopping 14%; there was some other polling that began to show this morphing in the way you suggested. I think one of the things that's going on there, again, has to do with this intersection of the very strong job market while inflation is easing. So we see real wage gains; wages are beating prices now for 10 months in a row for middle-wage workers. A lot of economists and I think it was 90% of CEOs a year ago said we would be in a recession. So executing on the president's agenda has led to a situation where things are looking a lot better than people thought they would. And I think as time goes on, we'll see more positive reporting when it comes to consumer sentiment. NerdWallet: Interest rates are something that's obviously on the mind of the market and consumers. Can you comment on the effect today's jobs report might have on the timing of Fed’s rate cuts? Jared Bernstein: Yeah, no I can’t. We have much respect for the independence of the Federal Reserve. So I'm certainly not going to talk about that. But I can talk to you a little bit about inflation because, of course, it's relevant. At the end of the day, inflation is going to drive a lot of the result of that kind of question. So we know that inflation is down two-thirds from its peak. We know that the six-month annualized rate of one of the inflation gauges the Fed watches most carefully, the core PCE , is growing at just below 2%. So that's a good sign for them. We also know that actual prices probably get more into sentiment than the Fed. And we know that actual prices — not lower inflation, actually lower prices — are in place whether we're talking about gas or bread, milk, eggs , toys, TVs, airfares, used cars, a lot of things that really spiked in price have come down in price. So we've had some deflation there. That helps with breathing room and, of course, that helps on the inflation side as well. NerdWallet: Can you talk a little bit about the populations that fueled labor force growth in the last year, specifically women? Jared Bernstein: When President Biden talks about empowering workers — and that's a key pillar of Bidenomics — one of the things he's really thinking about is the benefit of running a tight labor market, and the way they cascade to groups that have historically been underserved or even left behind. So here's a number you haven't probably heard too much today, but it comes out of the report: If you look at the average Black unemployment rate for 2023, it’s 5.5% — that's the lowest Black unemployment rate on record for an annual average going back to 1972, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics started collecting that data. If you look at the employment results for disabled workers, they're shooting up very nicely. And, of course, women, in what we call prime age: 25 to 54. If you look at folks in their prime working years, women's labor force participation broke records in 2023. This is just what happens when you have a persistently tight labor market with the unemployment rate below 4% for 23 months in a row, 14.3 million jobs, 36 months in a row of job creation. It's a great labor market. And it's reaching folks who too often are left behind under weaker conditions.

    "title": "Can puffer fish go with angelfish?",
    "text": "Can Puffer Fish and Angelfish Coexist? A Deep Dive into Compatibility The short answer is a resounding NO. Keeping puffer fish and angelfish together is generally a recipe for disaster. While both species are captivating additions to any aquarium, their temperaments, environmental needs, and feeding habits clash significantly, leading to stress, injury, and even death. The prevailing advice from experienced aquarists is to avoid this combination.\nWhy the Mix Doesn’t Work: Understanding the Core Issues Before diving into specific puffer varieties and potential exceptions (which are few and far between), it’s crucial to understand the fundamental incompatibilities.\nTemperament and Aggression Puffer fish , regardless of their “cute” appearance, are notorious for their aggressive tendencies , particularly toward long-finned fish . Angelfish , with their elegant, flowing fins, are prime targets for fin-nipping . This constant harassment causes immense stress to the angelfish , weakening their immune system and making them susceptible to disease. Even seemingly “peaceful” puffer species can become territorial and aggressive in a confined aquarium environment.\nWater Parameters and Environment While some puffer fish can tolerate freshwater conditions, many species, like the Figure 8 puffer , thrive in brackish water , a mix of fresh and saltwater. Angelfish , on the other hand, are strictly freshwater inhabitants. Trying to compromise on water parameters to accommodate both species will ultimately harm both, as neither will thrive in suboptimal conditions.\nDietary Needs Puffer fish have unique dietary requirements, often including crunchy foods like snails and crustaceans to keep their teeth from overgrowing. While angelfish also require a varied diet, their needs are significantly different. Furthermore, puffer fish are often messy eaters, which can negatively impact water quality, further stressing the angelfish . Puffer fish are also prone to eating invertebrates like snails and shrimp. Also, given how large they can grow, don’t buy any nano fish or small creatures that can be eaten by your angelfish (like microrasboras or dwarf shrimp).\nSpecies-Specific Considerations The term “puffer fish” encompasses a wide range of species, each with its own specific needs and temperament. Some, like the Dwarf Pea Puffer , might be considered less aggressive, but even these small puffers can become nippy towards angelfish fins. Larger puffer fish , such as the Mbu puffer , are solitary predators that should never be kept with other fish, especially not the relatively delicate angelfish .\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About Puffer Fish and Angelfish Here are 15 frequently asked questions that provide further insight into the compatibility of puffer fish and angelfish, as well as information on suitable tankmates for each species.\n1. Are there any puffer fish species that can be kept with angelfish? It’s highly inadvisable. While some sources might suggest the possibility of keeping very young, peaceful dwarf puffers with large angelfish in a very large, heavily planted tank, the risk of fin-nipping and aggression remains significant. This is a scenario best left to extremely experienced aquarists who can meticulously monitor the tank and intervene immediately if problems arise.\n2. What are the best tank mates for angelfish? Suitable tank mates include larger tetras and rasboras, gouramis, peaceful barbs, rainbowfish, corydoras and other medium-sized catfish. Also we’ve had good luck with black skirt tetras, adult cardinal tetras, and cory catfish.\n3. What fish should never be kept with angelfish? Aggressive or fin-nipping species, such as tiger barbs, most cichlids (other than carefully selected dwarf species), and, of course, puffer fish, should be avoided. It’s also best to avoid keeping them with fin-nipping or aggressive species to ensure the well-being of all the inhabitants in the tank. Any very small fish that could be seen as food should also be avoided.\n4. What are suitable tank mates for Dwarf Pea Puffers? Suitable tank-mates for dwarf pufferfish include small snails, ghost shrimp, and other peaceful, non-aggressive fish such as small tetras or guppies. But, even small dwarf puffers can be nippy.\n5. Can I keep snails with puffer fish? It depends on the puffer species. Many puffers, especially larger ones, will readily eat snails. Dwarf puffers might tolerate certain snail species, but it’s not guaranteed.\n6. What water parameters do angelfish prefer? Angelfish thrive in warm, slightly acidic water. A temperature of 78-84°F (26-29°C) and a pH of 6.0-7.0 are ideal. You need to make sure the tank is at the proper temperature and pH level.\n7. How big do angelfish get? In time, angelfish can grow up to 4″ long and 6″ tall so it’s important to have a tank that’s large enough to accommodate their large size.\n8. How long do angelfish live? When kept in ideal conditions these beautiful fish can live as long as 10-12 years.\n9. What size tank do angelfish need? A tank size of at least 20 gallons is recommended for a small group of angelfish, but larger tanks are preferable for a more stable environment. You can even keep six angelfish together in a 55-gallon tank or larger and they’ll be fine.\n10. Are angelfish aggressive? Yes and no. It depends on what type of tank mates you are keeping with angelfish and how big is your fish. Now, angelfish are cichlids so a bit of aggression is something which is not uncommon. Yes, they are in the lower spectrum of aggression as compared to other big or same sized cichlids but they are aggressive.\n11. What do angelfish eat? Angelfish are omnivores and enjoy a varied diet of flakes, pellets, frozen foods (like bloodworms and brine shrimp), and live foods.\n12. How long do puffer fish live? The lifespan of a pufferfish can range from three to 20 years, with an average of 10 years. Their lifespan can depend on many things, including the species and their environment.\n13. What do puffer fish eat? Pufferfish eat other fish, algae, and shellfish. Pufferfish eat mollusks, algae, small invertebrates, and other fish. They are omnivores that consume a variety of foods depending on their location.\n14. What are signs of stress in angelfish? Signs of stress include clamped fins, hiding, loss of appetite, and increased susceptibility to disease (like ich).\n15. Where can I learn more about responsible fishkeeping? Responsible fishkeeping requires a commitment to understanding the needs of each species and providing a suitable environment. Visit The Environmental Literacy Council for resources on ecosystems and environmental stewardship: https://enviroliteracy.org/ . Understanding the broader ecological context of your aquarium hobby is crucial.\nConclusion: Prioritizing Fish Welfare Ultimately, the decision of which fish to keep together should always prioritize the well-being of the animals. Given the inherent incompatibilities between puffer fish and angelfish , it’s best to avoid keeping them in the same tank. By understanding the needs of each species and choosing appropriate tank mates, you can create a thriving and harmonious aquarium environment for your aquatic companions.",
