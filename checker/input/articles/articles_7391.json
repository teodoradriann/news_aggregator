    "text": "2023-12-28 09:21:56 After Corona, many people are drawn to the screen again. Film funding boss Peter Dinges explains what “Barbenheimer” has to do with it and why the numbers will probably still be below 2019. Berlin. People in Germany are drawn to the big screen more often again – but still less often than before the pandemic. “The cinemas are doing much better than expected,” said the board of directors of the Film Funding Agency (FFA), Peter Dinges. The film theaters have recovered significantly after the corona pandemic. “Cinema is on everyone’s lips again.” Final figures for 2023 will not be published until next year. So far it is foreseeable that the ticket numbers will not yet be at the pre-Corona level of 2019, but will be below it, said Dinges. In the first six months of this year, 45.2 million tickets were sold at the box office, as the FFA announced in its half-year balance sheet. In 2019 there were 53.7 million cinema tickets in the same period. In a dpa interview in January 2021, Dinges expected that there would be a cinema boom after the end of the pandemic. Did that come true? “If you look closely, there is a cinema boom,” emphasized the film funding boss. “We haven’t reached the previous numbers yet, but if we look at what the cinema has offered this year and how people have received the cinema, I think it’s a good start for the future.” Older moviegoers are still hesitant There were ticket numbers and sales that were higher than in 2019 in various months. People are coming back – but not as quickly as the industry had hoped. A closer look shows that young people were going to the cinema more again. Older people, on the other hand, would not yet come back as strongly as they did in 2019. There could be several reasons for this, said Dinges – such as higher prices and costs of living. This year you also had to dig deeper into your pockets when it came to ticket prices. The average admission price was over ten euros for the first time, as Dinges noted. That was in the first half of 2023. “This price has to be put into perspective in the context, because it was due to films like “Avatar” and “Guardians of the Galaxy”. For them there was a 3D and an extra length surcharge.” This had a significant impact on the average price. This has now fallen again. Cinema operators also felt higher energy costs and, in some cases, higher wage costs. According to Dinges, they would have to factor this into the admission price in some way in order to recoup the costs. Recipe for success from “Barbenheimer” Nevertheless, from his point of view, films this year were “unusual: unusually beautiful and unusually good.” For example, the two blockbusters “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer,” which were released in theaters on the same day in July. The neologism “Barbenheimer” quickly made the rounds. According to Media Control, the lurid satire with Margot Robbie as a stereotypical Barbie was the most visited in 2023. From Dinges’ point of view, it’s a phenomenon in summer – a time of year when people don’t actually like to go to the cinema that much. “What was particularly special about these films was the way they addressed the audience. This was an address via social media, which actually made the films a cult even before they were released.” In addition, both are crossover films, meaning they appeal to multiple target groups and are shown in multiplexes as well as in art house cinemas. Crossover films in general would have worked this year. “This is modern cinema. This is how people want to be addressed. It worked, and worked very, very well. That seems to me to be a recipe for the future.” Some blockbusters won’t be shown until 2025 because of Hollywood strikes Speaking of the future: Looking ahead to next year, some blockbusters may have to be compromised. Screenwriters and actors in Hollywood had been on strike for months – this has also led to delays in the delivery of films and their programming for 2024 in this country. “We will of course feel this in terms of the number of visitors. But: postponed does not mean lifted,” said Dinges. Films like the new part of “Mission Impossible” and “Avatar” will be on screens in 2025. Will the consequences of the strike mean that more German films will come to the fore? “German film and international film have actually always worked together,” explained Dinges. “If one is missing, the other has stepped forward.” This could already be seen during the pandemic, when many US blockbusters were not released and there was a “phenomenal” German market share.

    "title": "Sustainable Cloud Computing: A path to greener business operations",
    "text": "Cloud computing has significantly changed how businesses handle their data and applications. Offering benefits such as cost savings, scalability, and flexibility, it has become an essential tool for enterprises aiming to stay competitive. However, beyond these operational advantages, cloud computing is increasingly playing a crucial role in sustainability, helping companies reduce their environmental impact. The Sustainability Impact of Cloud Computing Traditional data centers and on-premises servers consume substantial amounts of energy, resulting in high carbon emissions. Maintaining and cooling these servers requires significant power, often leading to wasted physical and digital resources. According to Naresh Purohit, Senior Director of Sales Engineering at Nutanix, “The demands on data centers are rapidly evolving, with artificial intelligence (AI) models becoming increasingly sophisticated and power-hungry. As organisations in India strive to maintain a competitive edge in the global AI race, they must ensure their data centers are flexible and scalable, configured appropriately to meet current and future demands, as well as sustainability targets.” In response to these concerns, major cloud providers are investing in renewable energy and enhancing their infrastructure for greater efficiency. For example, companies like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud are actively working towards powering their data centers with renewable energy, significantly reducing their carbon footprints. The scalability of cloud computing allows organisations to use only the necessary computing power, reducing excess hardware and energy consumption. Shifting to cloud-based solutions not only minimises dependence on physical infrastructure but also decreases electronic waste (e-waste) and overall energy usage. The shared infrastructure model inherent in cloud computing means that fewer resources are needed per organisation, resulting in lower energy consumption, reduced operational costs, and a smaller environmental footprint. Ranganath Sadasiva, Chief Technology Officer at HPE India, said, “The technology industry embraces renewable energy, carbon-neutral strategies, and advanced technologies like AI to monitor and reduce resource consumption. These initiatives aim to cut emissions and foster long-term change, ensuring cloud computing becomes a catalyst for a sustainable future.” What Is Green Cloud Computing? Green cloud computing focuses on using cloud services in a way that minimises environmental impact. This involves utilising energy-efficient technologies, renewable energy sources, and strategies that aim to reduce waste. As businesses grow, the demand for data centers increases, raising concerns about sustainability. Green cloud computing helps address these concerns by offering solutions that lower the carbon footprint of data centers. By adopting green cloud computing, organisations can optimise their operations while meeting their environmental sustainability goals. This involves using energy-efficient servers, advanced cooling systems, and sustainable IT resources to reduce energy consumption and operational costs. Devroop Dhar, Co-founder and Managing Director at Primus Partners, said, “Data centers contribute significantly to energy consumption and carbon emissions. As organisations shift towards cloud computing, the need to balance cloud requirements with sustainability is gaining traction. With India set to double its data center capacity, the need to reduce carbon emissions is urgent, making sustainable cloud computing increasingly important.” Reducing E-Waste Managing e-waste is a critical challenge for the tech industry as technology advances. Cloud providers are tackling this by implementing e-waste management programs that focus on recycling and responsibly disposing of outdated hardware. By extending the lifecycle of equipment and ensuring responsible disposal, cloud providers contribute to reducing the negative impact of e-waste on the environment. Additionally, the strategic location of data centers plays a role in reducing energy use. Cloud providers are establishing data centers in regions with abundant renewable energy sources and optimising their designs for energy efficiency. Sandeep Bhargava, Senior Vice President of Global Services and Solutions at Rackspace Technology, said, “Data contributes to cloud waste, often due to underutilised network equipment or servers. Companies are also facing the issue of unnecessary data backups and the costs of cooling powered-on servers that are not in use. This is why companies are shifting to more sustainable, greener cloud computing options.” Aneesh Jain, Chief Technology Officer at Thrivepass, said, “By taking advantage of shared resources, we can ensure the proper utilisation of servers to minimise idle capacity and subsequently reduce carbon emissions. Energy-efficient data centers, built by cloud providers using sophisticated cooling systems and renewable energy, can save considerable amounts of energy.” The Role of Edge Computing Edge computing is another development influencing the sustainability of cloud services. It brings computational power closer to end users, reducing the need for data to travel long distances. This reduces both energy consumption and latency, making operations more efficient. By processing data at the edge, businesses can lessen their dependence on central data centers, which further decreases energy requirements. While still in its early stages, edge computing is expected to become a mainstream solution that can contribute in reducing cloud-related energy consumption. The Bottom Line Sustainable cloud computing offers a pathway for businesses to manage their digital transformation while also meeting environmental sustainability targets. By reducing energy consumption, limiting e-waste, and incorporating renewable energy sources, green cloud computing aligns business efficiency with environmental responsibility. As sustainability becomes a core business priority, adopting green cloud solutions is evolving from a choice to a necessity. By embracing these technologies, companies can significantly lower their environmental impact while benefiting from cost savings and operational efficiency.",

    "title": "Maternal deaths lead to 50% drop in Ballari hospital deliveries, ET HealthWorld",
    "text": "Ballari: Following the deaths of lactating mothers, the district hospital witnessed a substantial decrease in deliveries over the past six weeks. Concerned about the situation at the govt facility, expectant mothers are now opting for private hospitals to ensure safer deliveries.\\\"The district hospital typically averages over 550 deliveries each month, but this has now fallen to less than 300. For example, there were 585 deliveries in September and 577 in Oct, but only 289 in Nov,\\\" according to information from the district hospital. Dr Basareddy, the District Surgeon, also confirmed that the number of deliveries decreased by 50% following recent maternal deaths.Previously, the govt district hospital was renowned for its high standards of care. Patients from neighbouring states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana sought treatment here due to the excellent service provided by the medical staff. The facility gained prominence as the preferred choice for childbirth among wives of IAS and IPS officers, judges, and various elected representatives.According to an anonymous physician, the district hospital was honoured with various awards from both the central and state govts. However, the alarming number of deaths among lactating mothers raised concerns among the public regarding the safety of delivering babies at this hospital.Many doctors voiced similar concerns. It is not just the public; many medical professionals at the district hospital are also troubled by the fatalities among nursing mothers. \\\"These deaths have tarnished the reputation of the entire hospital. We are receiving stringent directives, and there is a palpable sense of anxiety among us,\\\" lamented several doctors.Former patients of the district hospital and BIMS hospitals are now seeking care at private facilities. Private maternity hospitals in the city are operating at full capacity. While private hospital administrators are reluctant to share precise figures, the increased presence of pregnant women at these facilities indicates the shift.\\\"To mitigate risks, we decided to admit our daughter-in-law to this private hospital,\\\" explains Srinivasalu of Hosapete. \\\"Although the delivery expenses are quite high, the safety it provides is worth it.\\\" On the other hand, Dr Basareddy insists that this is a temporary issue. \\\"Even amid the turmoil, we managed 75 deliveries in our hospital by Dec 14. The district hospital still offers excellent treatment options, and there is no need for the public to be alarmed,\\\" he reassures.",
