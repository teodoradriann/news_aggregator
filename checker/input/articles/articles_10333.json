    "title": "Muslim Council of Britain Commends South Africa’s Referral of Israel, to the International Court of Justice | Muslim Council of Britain",
    "text": "The Muslim Council of Britain welcomes South Africa’s referral of Israel to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) for genocidal intent related to the atrocities in Gaza. This is an important reflection of the situation in Gaza and indiscriminate violence by Israeli forces. The ongoing bombing and killings in Palestine has resulted in immense suffering for innocent civilians with over 21,500 Palestinians killed and near 2 million displaced, by the Israeli state. In the last week alone, there has been attacks on the Christian communities, refugee camps and UN aid convoy, with countless members of the press also being killed. Settler violence has remained rampant, involving the illegal and forcible taking of Palestinian land and homes, resulting in the recent killings of over 300 Palestinians in the West Bank. MCB Secretary General, Zara Mohammed said: “South Africa’s referral to the International Court of Justice is a powerful statement from a nation familiar with the lived reality of apartheid. The South African state outline a strong case for genocidal intent by the actions and omissions of the Israeli Government, showing these are violations of the convention. While this is an important step towards justice, the violence must now cease.” In light of the recent [UN Resolution. 2720,](https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/12/1145022) which demands immediate, safe, and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance at scale directly to the Palestinian civilian population throughout the Gaza Strip, our government must do more to ensure civilians are not only receiving aid but working to end the violence permanently. As we approach the new year, sadly many will continue to suffer as a result of this siege and wars across the world. We urge our government to play its part in creating a lasting peace for this new year, upholding its moral duty to those afflicted by this unnecessary bloodshed. We need a permanent ceasefire now.” [ENDS] [MCB Updates](https://mcb.org.uk/category/mcb-updates/), [Press Releases](https://mcb.org.uk/category/press-releases/)",

    "text": "Fewer people are enrolling in ACA marketplace plans than last year, according to CMS data.\nAs of Dec. 4, 5.4 million people had enrolled in federal ACA marketplace plans. During the same time last year, 7.3 million people had enrolled in individual coverage.\nThe agency reported about 988,000 new consumers on the marketplace, down from 1.6 million new enrollees in 2023.\nEnrollment in the ACA marketplace has grown rapidly since 2021, when enhanced subsidies were introduced, making premiums more affordable for many. In 2024, 21.5 million people enrolled in ACA coverage, the highest number since the marketplace launched in 2014.\nHere are three things to know:\n- CMS\n[extended](https://www.beckerspayer.com/policy-updates/cms-extends-aca-enrollment-deadline.html)the deadline to enroll in coverage that begins Jan. 1 by three days in response to slow enrollment. Open enrollment runs until Jan. 15. - In July, CMS\n[issued](https://www.beckerspayer.com/policy-updates/cms-cracks-down-on-unauthorized-aca-broker-activity.html)new policies intended to block agents and brokers from making unauthorized changes to individual splan enrollment. In the first half of 2024, the agency received more than 100,000 complaints from individuals enrolled in an ACA plan without their knowledge. - A federal judge\n[halted](https://www.beckerspayer.com/policy-updates/judge-blocks-aca-coverage-for-daca-recipients-3-things-to-know.html)new regulations allowing individuals who are part of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program to enroll in ACA marketplace plans in the middle of open enrollment. CMS estimated 100,000 uninsured DACA recipients could have received coverage throught the marketplace.",

    "text": "MADRID, 26 (EUROPA PRESS)\nEl Ejército israelí ha llevado a cabo este jueves una nueva oleada de bombardeos contra objetivos del partido-milicia chií libanés Hezbolá en el sur de Líbano en el marco de la campaña intensificada de ataques aéreos contra el país desde el lunes.\nLos ataques han afectado a las localidades de Salaa, Abbasiyé, Tura y Selá, en el distrito de Tiro, ubicado en la gobernación de Líbano Sur. Asimismo, se han registrado otros cuatro bombardeos en Ghaziye, al sur de Beirut, según ha recogido 'L'Orient Le-Jour'.\nPor su parte, Hezbolá ha anunciado en un comunicado que ha atacado la ciudad israelí de Kiriat Ata, situada a pocos kilómetros al este de Haifa, con cerca de 50 misiles, según ha recogido la cadena de televisión libanesa Al Manar, vinculada a la milicia.\nEstados Unidos y Francia hicieron un llamamiento el miércoles a una tregua \"temporal\" de 21 días entre Israel y Hezbolá, si bien el primer ministro israelí, Benjamin Netanyahu, ha recalcado este mismo jueves que ha dado orden al Ejército para que continúe \"con todas sus fuerzas\" las operaciones contra el país vecino.",
