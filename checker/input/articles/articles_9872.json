    "text": "維他命C怎麼吃？ 醫曝一天半顆芭樂或一顆奇異果就夠\n維他命C有助於抗發炎、助排毒、改善心血管等，能提升身體的防禦能力，其來源主要為各種蔬菜水果，尤其是芭樂、奇異果。根據「2017-2020年國民營養健康狀況變遷調查」發現，台灣人每日水果攝取量嚴重不足，九成未達每日2份水果的建議攝取量，而7至12歲學童僅6.4%人數達標。\n台灣兒童糖尿病協會理事長羅福松表示，維生素C攝取充足對於兒童學習表現有益處，許多研究顯示，維生素C在血漿的濃度高，協助身體在各項功能中發揮核心作用。包括認知功能上升、加快反應速度、強化免疫系統、幫助骨骼生長等，若攝取不足，容易影響孩童生長發育、學習力下降、注意力不集中。\n羅福松指出，早餐空腹攝取維生素C，可以讓維生素C的利用率達到最大化。不過，家長常忽略水果攝取的重要性，早餐匆匆忙忙以三明治、飯糰、麥片解決。如果能以全穀類搭配優質的蛋白質以及高纖的蔬果，多樣化飲食就不會有缺乏營養素的危機；一天半顆芭樂或一顆奇異果就有足夠的維他命C。\n另外，透過早餐空腹攝取高維生素C的水果，可直接與鈣、鐵等其他營養素產生協同作用，並有效的提升血漿維生素C濃度。羅福松說，補充水果對兒童至關重要，健康應從「早餐」開始，豐富膳食纖維促進腸道蠕動、幫助血糖穩定，亦是控制體重的好幫手。\n水果除了富含維生素C外，高水溶性膳食纖維可增進腸道益菌種多元性，羅福松強調，水果的營養價值促進腦腸軸的健康循環，其機制為強化腸道益菌生環境，腸道中的微生物透過分泌化學物質與大腦交流，兩者相互影響，保護大腦免於發炎。\n董氏基金會食品營養中心主任許惠玉表示，健康飲食習慣要從小培養，鼓勵學童每天從早餐開始吃足水果，小番茄、奇異果、橘子、木瓜、香蕉都是不錯的選擇，熱量低但營養價值高。她提醒，應避免以果汁取代水果，短時間內會讓血糖上升，水果的膳食纖維也流失，建議搭配乳品與全麥麵包一起食用，均衡飲食。",

    "text": "FILE PHOTO: United Airlines planes land and prepare to take off at Newark Liberty International Airport in Newark, New Jersey, , U.S., January 27, 2025. REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch/File Photo(Reuters) - United Airlines shares rose on Wednesday in premarket trading, lifting up peers, after it said forward bookings were stable so far in the current quarter despite tariff-induced economic uncertainty.Shares of the carrier were up nearly 6% premarket and on track to recover some of their losses from what has been a tumultuous last few months for U.S. airlines. United shares have fallen 31% this year.Trump\\'s trade policies and sweeping tariffs have sparked a global trade war and raised the odds of the world spiraling into recession, making customers hesitant to spend on travel.Expectations of a gloomy demand environment prompted airlines to take a prudent approach with capacity and cost controls. Several U.S. airlines have started cutting flights to avoid lowering fares and to protect margins.United on Tuesday reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings and said forward bookings for high-margin premium cabins rose 17% over the past two weeks, with international reservations up 5% during the same period.This lifted peers American Airlines and Delta Air up 1.6% and 3.4% respectively. Domestic rival Southwest Airlines also rose 2.6%.United, however, warned its financial forecast for the year was dependent on the macro environment, which it added was \\\"impossible to predict this year with any degree of confidence.\\\"If recession occurs, it would lead to a 5-percentage point drop in its revenue and translate into a full-year adjusted profit of $7 to $9 a share.In January, it had forecast 2025 adjusted profit of $11.50 to $13.50 per share.It still expects to hit its full-year forecast if demand remains stable and fuel prices stay around the current levels.\\\"The prepared remarks encouragingly note demand has stabilized over the past 6 weeks. That factor combined with favorable fuel leads the company to believe it can achieve its initial FY25 EPS guidance,\\\" TD Cowen said in a note.This stands in contrast to rival Delta Air Lines, which withdrew its full-year outlook last week, citing \\\"stalled\\\" demand growth.(Reporting by Shivansh Tiwary in Bengaluru; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli)",

    "title": "Edmonton man loses finger in shooting outside Kingsway Mall | CTV News",
    "text": "[Skip to main content](#main) **Warning the details in this story may be disturbing to some readers** A man who was shot outside an Edmonton shopping mall earlier this month says he doesn't know if he'll ever fully recover from his injuries. Tyler Marshall was locking his bike up outside Walmart at Kingsway Mall around 7:15 p.m. on Dec. 5 when he was approached by a stranger. \"I was trying to get away from them. Tell them 'I'm sorry. I don't understand what you're saying,'\" he told CTV News Edmonton. \"When that conversation went nowhere I started walking away. As I was walking away, he said something and I turned around and that's when he shot me.\" Police say Marshall's attacker went on to carjack a truck and drove it to the traffic circle at 101 Street and 118 Avenue, where he drove it into a building. Dakota Grey, 28, is facing more than 20 criminal charges in connection to the shooting and carjacking. He's scheduled to appear in court on Jan. 4. Marshall suffered injuries to his torso, legs and hand as a result of the single shot fired from a sawed-off shotgun. The pellets destroyed most of his index finger. \"I did not realize that at the time. I had initially tried to grab my phone. And that's when I realized they couldn't grab my phone, and I thought 'Hang on, what's going on.'\" He says he's currently undergoing treatment on his hand and doesn't know how much he'll be able to use it when the bandages come off. Tyler Marshall speaks to CTV News Edmonton's Miriam Valdes-Carletti on Dec. 28, 2023. (Matt Marshall/CTV News Edmonton) \"We had to amputate the index finger and part of the middle finger had to be reattached; the bone near the joint is broken. So currently it's pinned in place right now. And the thumb was the most minor part. It just had some stuff in the tip of it, the pad of the thumb.\" It's also taken him weeks to be able to walk again after the injuries to his legs. \"The first few days in the hospital, it was very difficult. To walk to the washroom was all I was capable of. It took a couple more days to go down the hall.\" Marshall works at a restaurant in the parking lot of Kingsway Mall, but he's unable to work because of his injuries. \"I had very little savings to begin with. And with expenses, I've spent them all already,\" he said. \"AHS was very quick to send the ambulance bill, and medication is expensive.\" He says he's now borrowing money from friends and family to pay rent and bills. His brother started a GoFundMe page to help Marshall cover his expenses. Marshall doesn't know how long he'll be in rehabilitation for his injuries. \"We have no idea if the hand will actually be good after this. And potentially I could have to have a new joint or something else. And that could lead to more surgeries down the road.\" He doesn't know if he'll ever be able to go back to Kingsway. \"I don't feel comfortable going back there. The thought of it still worries me.\" With files from CTV News Edmonton's Miriam Valdes-Carletti Edmonton Top Stories CTVNews.ca Top Stories U.S., U.K. militaries launch massive retaliatory strike against Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen The U.S. and British militaries bombed more than a dozen sites used by the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen on Thursday, in a massive retaliatory strike using warship and submarine-launched Tomahawk missiles and fighter jets, U.S. officials said.

    "text": "One robbed a bank in Douglasville at the age of 16 and watched it turn into a comedy of errors when a dye pack mixed in with the cash exploded as soon as he reached the parking lot. Another was just 14 when he joined two older teens in robbing delivery drivers in DeKalb County of cash, pizzas and Chinese food, threatening them with a broken gun.\nYet another was 26 and working at a Publix warehouse when he and a co-worker went on a crime spree in Gwinnett County that included a home invasion and two armed robberies. They were caught when police pulled them over for speeding and noticed liquor bottles, including pour spouts, from the Applebee’s they’d just robbed.\nArthur Lee Cofield Jr., Nathan Weekes and Ryan Brandt received lengthy sentences in the Georgia Department of Corrections for brazen but amateurish criminal attempts to get easy money. When they arrived, they weren’t notable criminals, murderers or gang leaders. But in prison, the three were transformed into allegedly powerful crime lords who, with the help of corrupt prison employees, built lucrative criminal enterprises that orchestrated violent attacks that occurred outside the walls.\nAn Atlanta Journal-Constitution examination of their stories, including new reporting on their past conduct, demonstrates how Georgia’s prisons aren’t just failing to reform people. They are allowing prisoners to keep offending — often for years and sometimes in deadly ways — while they’re behind bars.\nCofield was sentenced to 14 years in prison for the bungled bank robbery. Now he’s known as the astonishingly adept scammer who, from inside Georgia’s most secure facility, stole $11 million from the Charles Schwab account of billionaire movie producer Sidney Kimmel, turned the money into gold coins and used a portion to buy a $4.4 million mansion in Buckhead.\nWeekes, who received a 17-year prison sentence for robbing the delivery drivers, is now in far deeper trouble. He faces the death penalty and is accused of ordering the murders of three people on the outside to protect a lucrative contraband ring. One victim, an 88-year-old man, was shot to death in his bed in what prosecutors say was a case of mistaken identity.\nBrandt received a life sentence for his role in the Gwinnett crime spree. Although the crimes that sent him to prison 15 years ago weren’t gang-related, he’s now the top defendant in a massive federal gang indictment that says members of Sex Money Murder, a subset of the Bloods, engaged in murders, drug trafficking and fraud from inside Georgia prisons.\nThe circumstances in each case shed light on the realities of an incredibly expensive prison system that isn’t working, said Michele Deitch, an attorney and a distinguished senior lecturer at the University of Texas at Austin’s LBJ School of Public Affairs who directs the school’s Prison and Jail Innovation Lab.\n“Georgia’s prison system is not accomplishing a goal of public safety because people are still committing crimes both while they’re incarcerated and after they get out,” Deitch said. “It is clearly not serving to rehabilitate people, if incarcerated people are still involved in these kinds of criminal behavior. There is no meaningful incapacitation if they still have the ability to be involved in criminal activities while they are locked up. And no one appears to be deterred from criminal behavior just because they are incarcerated. The public is getting nothing for its money, except a worse outcome.”\nThe cases also demonstrate how, even when the GDC has evidence of illegal activity, it’s often unable to shut it down. The AJC’s yearlong investigation of the Georgia state prison system has found hundreds of corrupt guards have smuggled in contraband, prisoners dying from drug overdoses at alarming rates, drug rings operating with abandon and understaffing to the point that it has led to record numbers of homicides.\nBy 2018, the GDC had learned, through a forensic analysis of a confiscated cellphone, that Cofield had amassed nearly $1.5 million from financial crimes, according to a copy of the analysis report obtained by the AJC. But Cofield wasn’t charged with a crime until 2020, when federal authorities uncovered the $11 million theft from Kimmel’s Charles Schwab account.\nSimilarly, a whistleblower lawsuit filed by an officer at Smith State Prison suggests the GDC had reason to look closer at contraband issues that could have pointed to Weekes, yet the department failed to do so. According to the lawsuit, GDC officials were told the warden, Brian Adams, wasn’t policing contraband months before he was fired and arrested on charges that he was involved in a multimillion-dollar contraband scheme directed by Weekes.\nCredit: AJC photo illustration\nBrian Adams is the former warden at Smith State Prison. He was arrested in February for allegedly being involved in a multimillion-dollar contraband scheme directed by prisoner Nathan Weekes. (AJC photo illustration) The officer who filed the suit, Julia Roberts, told the AJC that Adams was allowing packages that should have been blocked to come into the prison. But when she reported him, she said, investigators brushed off her tip. She said GDC officials then informed Adams, prompting the warden to berate her for going over his head.\n“He just flat told me if I had an issue that I was to take it to him, that I was not to go over his head again,” said Roberts, who worked in the prison’s mailroom at the time.\nThe federal charges in Brandt’s case also raise the issue of what the GDC knew — or should have known. One of the matters detailed in the indictment, unsealed in November, dates to 2013, when, by the government’s account, Brandt and two other members of Sex Money Murder distributed heroin to a man then in federal prison in Pennsylvania.\nProsecutors say Brandt’s crimes continued for a decade, as he directed drug sales in the Atlanta area, told corrupt guards to smuggle drugs into prison, orchestrated financial crimes and gave the go-ahead for violent attacks on other inmates.\n`So many different scams’ Jose Morales, a retired Georgia prison warden , said prisons have always been places where people can learn to become more polished criminals. He saw it firsthand as the warden at the Special Management Unit , Georgia’s so-called super max prison in Butts County, when Cofield was there. That a teenager with a seventh-grade education and a long prison sentence could become a criminal mastermind isn’t too farfetched, given the environment, he said.\n“You get some of the shrewdest criminal minds in the prison system, and people learn from them,” Morales said. “There are so many different scams they’re running in there, it’s unbelievable.”\nMorales said the GDC’s acute staffing shortages and its inability to stem the tide of contraband cellphones have enabled prisoners in their criminal pursuits. Beyond providing communication with the outside world, smartphones provide prisoners with access to social media, which, in turn, allows them to promote their exploits, he said.\n“They become popular,” Morales said of the people with outside access through use of the phones. “It feeds their egos, and so the (criminal) lifestyle continues while they’re doing life in prison.”\n“You get some of the shrewdest criminal minds in the prison system, and people learn from them.\"\n- Jose Morales, a retired Georgia prison warden For many who arrive in Georgia’s prisons, it’s hard to focus on preparing for release. Georgia’s sentences tend to be extraordinarily long, with parole often not even an option, especially for violent offenses. That’s especially true for Brandt, who was sentenced in 2007 to a stunning seven consecutive life sentences plus 265 years, then a record in Georgia, for the home invasion and two armed robberies.\n“Without some hope or belief that they’re not marking their days until they die, they will find ways to spend their time and not always in ways beneficial to the public at large,” said Mark Yurachek, one of Brandt’s attorneys.\nAs time behind bars passed for Cofield, Weekes and Brandt, they came up with schemes that empowered them and endangered others, prosecutors say.\n‘Young and Paid’ Less than three weeks after his 16th birthday, Arthur Lee Cofield Jr. walked into a branch of First Choice Community Bank in Douglasville, pulled out a Lorcin .380 handgun and demanded money from the tellers. He got $2,600 and made it to the parking lot before the episode went south.\nAs soon as he got into a cohort’s stolen Dodge station wagon, Cofield was covered with red dye. Not long after that, his cohort crashed the vehicle. Running, the two had to navigate a wooden fence. It took Cofield several tries to get over it.\nNot surprisingly, police quickly put the pieces together and built the case that sent Cofield, aka “Little Co,” to prison. He was still 16. Nothing about him screamed “master criminal” — until he entered the Department of Corrections and became one.\nDocuments recently obtained by the AJC show Cofield was raking in cash through financial scams years before he was caught by the feds and that the GDC had compelling evidence of it.\n“[Georgia's prison system] is clearly not serving to rehabilitate people, if incarcerated people are still involved in these kinds of criminal behavior.\"\n- Michele Deitch, director of the Prison and Jail Innovation Lab at the University of Texas at Austin In 2014, a confidential informant told law enforcement officers from Atlanta and surrounding communities that Cofield was leading a fraud ring that stole people’s identities, then purchased items at Home Depot, Best Buy, Apple stores and other retail outlets, using the victims’ store accounts. The stolen items were picked up at the stores and fenced, the informant said.\n“The (informant) believes Cofield has made many thousands of dollars from this operation, and in fact has thousands of dollars inside the prison,” states a memo outlining the meeting with the informant.\nFour years later, Cofield was engaged in more sophisticated and apparently lucrative scams , according to the GDC’s forensic analysis of a cellphone confiscated from him at the now-closed Georgia State Prison in Reidsville.\nThe analysis showed Cofield had accumulated $1.473 million in assets and cash transactions. At least seven other prisoners and three outsiders were identified as working with Cofield in what was described as a “large scale, multi-faced, multi-victim” fraud.\nThe analysis found photos of mail and checks stolen from an Atlanta construction company executive, a bill of sale for a $449,080 Lamborghini Aventador and email exchanges regarding purchases of gold coins. It also found that Cofield, using an alias, had been in email contact with a private investigator, seeking to obtain rap artist Young Thug’s personal banking information.\nBy that time, Cofield was openly flaunting his wealth with a crew he’d put together in prison known as YAP, short for Young and Paid. Cofield, the leader, was called YAP Lavish. Photos of a gem-encrusted YAP necklace amid piles of cash were among those on the phone analyzed by the GDC in 2018.\nThe group became known for renting out clubs for parties and promoting itself on social media. At one point, it was even incorporated. Filings with the Georgia Secretary of State in 2017 and 2018 listed Cofield as a general partner in YAP Entertainment LLLP and gave his address as a house in Decatur.\nThe money and the status also brought women, and Fulton County prosecutors believe Cofield’s relationship with one — 25-year-old Selena Holmes — led to a shooting that left an Atlanta man paralyzed from the waist down.\nProsecutors believe Cofield ordered the shooting of the 37-year-old man, shot nine times in the parking lot outside a southwest Atlanta recording studio shortly after noon Sept. 21, 2018, because he believed the man was involved with Holmes. Although Holmes’ only contact with Cofield was by phone, she was known as YAP Missus and was living in the Skyhouse Apartments in Buckhead — rent, $2,887 a month — at Cofield’s expense.\nCredit: AJC photo illustration\nProsecutors say that 25-year-old Selena Holmes was in a relationship with Arthur Cofield and lived at Skyhouse Buckhead at Cofield's expense. Holmes was convicted for her role in the 2018 shooting of an Atlanta man, allegedly on Cofield’s orders. (AJC photo illustration) “I’ve known Mr. Cofield for a long time,” Marissa Viverito, an investigator with the Fulton district attorney’s office, stated during a court hearing related to the shooting. “He finds these women from the outside and kind of pretends like he owns them from the inside using money and things like that, and they enjoy the lifestyle, so they go along with it, and they go along with it as long as the money is good, which is what Ms. Holmes was doing.”\nProsecutors contend that Cofield was on the phone with the shooter and another man, both of whom had been part of his YAP crew in prison, during the drive-by. Holmes was there, too, as a lookout. The two men and Holmes have pleaded guilty to their roles in the shooting and received lengthy prison sentences. Cofield has pleaded not guilty.\nAfter the shooting, the GDC moved Cofield to the Special Management Unit, where he was confined to a single-man cell and allowed only limited interaction with other prisoners. Even there, he was able to steal the $11 million , turn it into gold and use a portion to buy a mansion before Morales seized the phone that allowed federal investigators to uncover the scheme.\nThe total of what Cofield made from his scams is not clear in court documents. But Morales says he saw a bank statement for $31 million on the screen of one of the many cellphones he confiscated from Cofield. He said he was able to view the screen only briefly before the phone automatically locked.\n“Cofield was smart,” Morales said. “He let other people do his bidding. I mean, the guy knows how to play the role. He didn’t draw attention to himself. He was so quiet you wouldn’t even know he was there. But every other day, we found a phone on him. So he had people in his pocket.”\nCofield, now 32, has been in federal custody since his state sentence ended in October 2021. In April, he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit bank fraud and aggravated identity theft. He’s due to be sentenced in January, and the government is recommending a prison sentence of 151 months.\nCredit: U.S. District Court\nIn this transcript from the plea hearing of Arthur Lee Cofield, Cofield describes how he transferred $11 million from a Charles Schwab account and arranged a delivery of gold coins. (U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia) At the plea hearing, Cofield admitted to the $11 million Charles Schwab scam and another, in which he siphoned cash from a PNC Bank account and also turned it into gold.\nThe second scenario matches a 2018 theft of $650,000 from the PNC Bank account of a prominent Birmingham, Alabama, orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Kenneth Bramlett, that was subsequently investigated by local and federal authorities.\nRecently interviewed for this story, Bramlett said he learned from authorities that a Georgia prison inmate was behind the heist, but Bramlett was never given that person’s name. Asked to describe what went through his mind when he heard that a prisoner was the mastermind, he responded with sarcasm.\n“That’s very comforting,” he said. “Yeah, I mean, who knows what else is going on, right?”\nA decade-long conspiracy? Filling two boxes, the documents from Ryan Brandt’s court case in Gwinnett County describe in stark detail how he and another man robbed and terrorized a family in their home, then days later robbed two restaurants — a Fuddruckers and an Applebee’s. But nowhere in any of those documents does the word “gang” appear.\nIt took 15 years in Georgia prisons for that label to attach itself to Brandt, now 44. It’s a label that may say as much about life inside as it does about Brandt himself.\nIn the recently unsealed federal indictment, the government alleges that Brandt, along with 22 other members and associates of Sex Money Murder, took part in a decade-long conspiracy that includes a series of murders — both inside and outside prison walls — as well as drug trafficking and financial crimes.\nBrandt is the first defendant listed in the 31-page indictment, which also identifies him by his street names: “Street Life” and “Robert Kraft.” The reference to the owner of the six-time Super Bowl champion New England Patriots is an apparent nod to Brandt’s stature within the SMM hierarchy.\nIf, as the feds allege, Brandt is indeed now a high-ranking member of Sex Money Murder, the extraordinary sentence has to be considered a factor, said Yurachek, who represented Brandt in his appeal.\n“For you to tell me he’s tied up with a gang, that stuns me, quite frankly,” Yurachek said. “But the line I draw pretty quickly is you have put this guy away forever (and) given him a sentence that might be called ‘death by incarceration.’”\nThe crime spree that sent Brandt to prison started when he and William Kollie, a co-worker, forced their way into the home of a Snellville couple and their 6-year-old daughter. When the man answered the door, Kollie shot him in the arm. Brandt and Kollie then bound the man, his wife and the 6-year-old with duct tape and stole a variety of items, including guns, jewelry and the family’s Toyota Sequoia.\nThirteen days later, they robbed the restaurants. They were caught after the Applebee’s robbery, when police stopped Kollie’s Ford F-150 Harley-Davidson for speeding at roughly the same time they received an alert to be on the lookout for the distinctive black truck.\nAfter rejecting a plea that carried a 40-year prison sentence, the pair was convicted at trial. In handing down the seven consecutive life sentences, Judge Debra K. Turner said of the two men: “All I know is the behavior you’ve exhibited is inhumane, it is amoral, it shows no regard for life — not yours and not anyone else’s.”\n“Without some hope or belief that they're not marking their days until they die, they will find ways to spend their time and not always in ways beneficial to the public at large.\"\n- Mark Yurachek, one of Brandt’s attorneys Lisa Jones, who prosecuted the case, said she remembers Brandt and Kollie as warehouse workers in their 20s who simply saw an opportunity to enrich themselves at the expense of others. They weren’t motivated by drugs or gang ties, she said.\n“I think they just wanted power,” she said. “They wanted to take what they wanted. It was just like, `What the hell?’”\nGiven the violence in the home invasion, she said, the sentence was appropriate.\nBut it didn’t achieve the goal of stopping further crime.\nThe federal indictment, in fact, paints the picture of a much more dangerous criminal. It puts Brandt in the middle of a broad and deadly conspiracy in which SMM members used contraband cellphones to orchestrate a variety of criminal activities from inside multiple GDC facilities.\nOne of the more chilling matters included in the indictment is the fatal shooting in 2014 of 9-month-old Kendarius Edwards Jr., a killing that occurred during a retaliatory hit at his mother’s home in DeKalb County. Although an SMM member has been convicted for ordering the shooting from inside Autry State Prison, the indictment suggests that others will also be prosecuted.\nBrandt is directly cited multiple times in the allegations. The most serious of them contends he was dealing meth and “sheets” — paper soaked with drugs, most often a synthetic form of marijuana. In several instances, he allegedly had help from three officers at Baldwin State Prison: Tracey Wise, Shounnette Wooten and Kierra Williams. Wise, a lieutenant, admitted when he was fired in 2021 that he had smuggled in drug-laced papers for Brandt three times and received $2,500 each time.\nCredit: AJC photo illustration\nThree former officers at Baldwin State Prison — from left, Shounnette Wooten, Kierra Williams, and Tracey Wise — are accused of helping Ryan Brandt smuggle into the prison paper soaked with drugs, most often a synthetic form of marijuana. (AJC photo illustration) The indictment also states that Brandt gave another SMM member permission to delay stabbing an inmate, another sign of Brandt’s key role in the gang.\nBrandt’s sister Melanie Yancy said she doesn’t know the details of her brother’s life in prison. But she knows dealing with a lengthy prison sentence means figuring out a way to survive.\n“You’ve got a corrupt system,” she said. “You’re in prison. It’s do-or-die. You’ve got the Muslims. You’ve got the white folks. You’ve got the Black folks. And you’ve got the guards. Which side do you want to be on? That’s the lay of the land. And with the amount of time you have, it’s live or die in there. If you want to stay alive, you’ve got to pick a side.”\n`It seems unfathomable’ Nathan Weekes was 14 when, in 2010, DeKalb County police officers investigating a holdup found him hiding in the attic at a friend’s house four days after Christmas.\nWeekes quickly confessed, describing how he and two older friends had held up a series of delivery drivers over several weeks that December, netting cash and food. He admitted he had been the one who pointed a broken gun at the drivers and that one of his friends had used a rock inside a sock to beat a man delivering Chinese food.\n“He was bleeding real bad and I grabbed the food and ran off,” Weekes told police.\nAt the time of the holdups, Weekes had been in the U.S. for just four years, having immigrated with his family from the South American country of Guyana. Adjusting to a new life hadn’t been easy. He was doing well in school but had trouble fitting in and making friends. He started hanging out with the two older kids, one 16 and the other 18, who were part of the crime spree. Together, they committed 11 armed robberies over a few weeks.\nAfter pleading guilty in 2012, Weekes was sentenced to 17 years in prison — more time than he’d been alive at that point. At the sentencing, his mother, Beverly Weekes, told the judge she didn’t raise her son to be a criminal. “He was never a child like this. He was always loving,” she said. She was hopeful about what might happen to her son someday, saying she left things in God’s hands. “I know he will place my son back into my arms,” she said. “I know.”\nIt hasn’t worked out that way. Raised, more or less, by the Department of Corrections, Weekes, now 27, is a man accused of deadly crimes that have left a South Georgia town unnerved.\nIt was a botched crime, the murder of 88-year-old Bobby Kicklighter, that allowed investigators to identify Weekes as a prison crime lord. According to investigators, Weekes sent a crew of associates to the Glennville home of a Smith State Prison officer who had been aggressively cracking down on contraband. But the crew went to the wrong house and shot Kicklighter, who was in bed at the time.\nA critical piece of evidence discovered at the scene, a COVID-19 style mask with a name on it, eventually led investigators to the getaway driver, Aerial Deshay Murphy, and to the alleged triggerman, former prisoner Christopher Sumlin.\nPhone records tied the crimes to Weekes and a former correctional officer, Keisha Janae Jones, described by investigators as Weekes’ girlfriend.\nWhen investigators announced they had solved the case, the town was shocked to learn that someone inside the local prison was responsible for killing their neighbor.\nCredit: AJC photo illustration\n88-year-old Bobby Kicklighter was murdered in his Glennville home, shown at center, in what investigators say was a botched assassination that was intended to target a correctional officer. Investigators connected Kicklighter's murder to Aerial Deshay Murphy, bottom left, who has pleaded guilty to playing a role in the murder. Prosecutors say that Nathan Weekes hired former prisoner Christopher Sumlin, at right, to be the triggerman. (AJC photo illustration) “You could have given us 1,000 guesses over 1,000 years and nobody could have ever thought of something like this,” said Dylan Mulligan, a Glennville attorney and friend of the Kicklighter family who has served as their spokesman. “It seems unfathomable that something like that could have actually happened.”\nKicklighter’s killing was one of three that prosecutors believe were part of a plan by Weekes to protect the “Yves Saint Laurent” squad, the thriving contraband enterprise he was operating inside Smith State Prison. Weekes is also charged with ordering the murders of Jerry Lee Davis, who had a job delivering supplies to the prison, and Jessica Gerling, a former correctional officer who has been tied to the contraband scheme.\nWeekes, who went by “Kash” or “Da President,” had figured out how to pay off or threaten guards as well as recruit other prisoners and people on the outside to help him smuggle in drugs, jewelry, weapons and cellphones, all of which he sold at a profit. Adams, the warden, was also in on the scheme, according to the charges that cost him his job.\nIn videos filmed inside Smith State Prison and posted on social media, Weekes bragged about the squad’s ability to continue criminal activity behind bars.\nWeekes was eventually moved to the Special Management Unit, but, like Cofield, he wasn’t deterred by the added security.\nCredit: AJC photo illustration\nLt. Sharie Clark was a veteran correctional officer at the maximum security Special Management Unit in Jackson. She is accused of accepting $2,000 in Cash App payments from Nathan Weekes in exchange for moving $30,000 to multiple subjects. (AJC photo illustration) Not long after Weekes arrived at his new facility, multiple criminal charges were filed against a veteran correctional officer there, Lt. Sharie Clark. The basis for the charges: She had accepted $2,000 in Cash App payments from Weekes in exchange for moving $30,000 to multiple subjects.\nWhen Weekes was sent to prison, the superior court judge who sentenced him, Cynthia Becker, said she understood how the length of a 17-year sentence would sound to teenagers. She said she had a teenage son herself.\n“Justice requires justice, not only for defendants but for victims in the community,” she said, speaking to Weekes and one of the other teens. “And while I’m not comfortable with the sentence — I’m never comfortable sending young men off — I do believe it is just. Now, the two of you, I’m going to impose sentence on you and it’s harsh. But you will still have love, support and a lifetime to make amends. OK?”\n“Yes, ma’am,” Weekes replied.\nAbout This Investigation This is the latest installment of an Atlanta Journal-Constitution investigation into the extensive problems in the Georgia prison system. To see whether the prison system is fulfilling its mission, AJC reporters explored the stories of three men serving long sentences who have gained notoriety behind bars. All three are accused of committing crimes while incarcerated that are more serious than those that sent them to prison.\nThe AJC also examined whether the prison system is impeding the public’s understanding of what’s happening in Georgia prisons through a lack of transparency.\nThe stories in this installment are based on court records, trial and hearing transcripts, police and other law enforcement reports, Georgia Department of Corrections records and responses to requests for information as well as interviews with experts, officials and those involved with the cases the AJC studied.\nThe first installment of this investigation, published in September, revealed extensive corruption by Georgia prison employees and its role in triggering violence. In October, the AJC’s second installment revealed how fatal drug overdoses have dramatically increased in Georgia prisons. In November, the third installment revealed grim new records for homicides and suicides amid drastic understaffing at many of the state’s most violent prisons.",

    "text": "Mother and friend of woman killed by husband honoured for work on domestic abuse By Press Association December 29 2023, 10.36pm Share Mother and friend of woman killed by husband honoured for work on domestic abuse Share via Facebook Twitter Whatsapp Messenger Linkedin Email Post link https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/news/uk/6312289/mother-and-friend-of-woman-killed-by-husband-honoured-for-work-on-domestic-abuse/ Copy Link Joanna Simpson’s mother, Diana Parkes (left) and best friend Hetti Barkworth-Nanton, have been honoured for their work against domestic violence (Aaron Chown/PA)\nThe best friend of a woman who was bludgeoned to death by her husband said she is “deeply moved and overwhelmed” to feature in the New Year Honours list as she called for more to be done to tackle domestic abuse.\nHetti Barkworth-Nanton, who has been made a CBE for services to people affected by domestic abuse and homicide, acknowledged that the honour would not be happening “were it not for my beautiful friend Joanna Simpson, who lost her life so brutally at the hands of her estranged husband”.\nMs Simpson was beaten to death with a claw hammer by Robert Brown in their family home in October 2010, as their two young children cowered in a playroom.\nJoanna Simpson was bludgeoned to death by her husband one week before the finalisation of their divorce (Thames Valley Police/PA) Ms Simpson’s mother Diana Parkes has also been made a CBE, for services to vulnerable children suffering from domestic abuse and domestic homicide.\nBrown was cleared of Ms Simpson’s murder, having admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility, and was due to be released on licence in November this year after serving 13 years of a 26-year sentence.\nThe former British Airways captain, formerly of Winkfield in Berkshire, was sentenced to 24 years for manslaughter and a further two years for an offence of obstructing a coroner in the execution of his duty.\nHe killed Ms Simpson one week before the finalisation of their divorce and dumped her body in a makeshift coffin in Windsor Great Park.\nHis automatic release from prison was blocked by the Justice Secretary in October.\nRelatives and friends of Ms Simpson had called on Alex Chalk to block her killer’s automatic release, saying he remained a danger to the public, and to refer the case to the Parole Board – something he did after pledging to “give this case my closest personal attention”.\nThe Ministry of Justice said the board, an independent body that carries out risk assessments on prisoners to determine whether they can be safely released, would make a decision on whether to release Brown “in due course”.\nMs Barkworth-Nanton co-founded the Joanna Simpson Foundation alongside Ms Parkes and is also chair of domestic abuse charity Refuge.\nShe thanked Ms Parkes for “working so bravely together with me for much-needed change”.\nMs Barkworth-Nanton, who also thanked her own family for their support, hailed the honour as a “testament to those many individuals who dedicate themselves to this cause, survivors of domestic abuse who bravely tell their story, and the family and friends who support them”.\nTelling how “deeply moved and overwhelmed” she was when she found out she was to be included in the honours list, she also paid tribute to all those working in criminal justice, health and social care, law, education and human resources, who “continue to ask the right questions, and be there for survivors when they so badly need help”.\nShe said: “Today I work with and alongside many incredible colleagues, who work and volunteer for Refuge, The Joanna Simpson Foundation, and sister organisations throughout the VAWG (violence against women and girls) sector who work tirelessly to support women and children experiencing domestic abuse and whose commitment inspires me every day.\n“Whilst domestic abuse is predominantly perpetrated on women, I also recognise and applaud the work of Respect and others who provide much-needed support to men who are experiencing abuse.”\nBut she said while many things have “changed for the better”, there remains “a huge amount of work still to be done” regarding domestic abuse and violence.\nShe added: “Change must be everyone’s challenge because changing societal attitudes takes all of us. It could be affecting your sister, your mother, your daughter, your niece, your friend, your colleague, your neighbour – changing attitudes and creating a generation free from abuse is down to every one of us today.\n“We have to reach more women sooner so they can get help earlier, we have to raise awareness to help women spot the signs, we must change laws, attitudes, and behaviours in society, and that way we will ultimately save lives. I will not rest until domestic abuse is eliminated.”",

    "text": "Nigerian record label owner and musician Don Jazzy has urged entrepreneurs not to give up on their dreams and goals.\nSharing a video on Instagram, the music emperor said that it is imperative for entrepreneurs to work on their projects and implement their strategies, no matter how small.\nHe admitted that starting and maintaining a business is not easy. However, Don Jazzy believes the result is worth it.\n“Dear entrepreneurs, dream big, start small, but most importantly, get started. Know why you started and keep going, no matter how hard it is, trust me, there will be hard times. Might be a distraction but you see me, I mind my own business,” he wrote.\nDon Jazzy's comments come after Universal Music Group announced a majority investment in Nigeria-based Afrobeats powerhouse label Mavin Global (Mavin).\nThe deal is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close later this year.\nThe Mavin team in Nigeria will be supported by UMG's global network of labels and businesses.\nCurrently distributed internationally (except Africa) through Virgin Music Group with Rema, Mavin and its roster have already been integrated into UMG's unmatched network, which includes several signings on US labels, including Ayra. Republic Partnership for Star and Interscope for Lifesize Teddy.\nAccording to the announcement, Mavin will maintain autonomy over its strategy and future talent development. As part of the agreement, Founder and CEO Don Jazzy and COO Tega Oghenejobo will continue to lead the company.\nDisclaimer: The views, comments, opinions, contributions and statements made by readers and contributors on this forum do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\nSource: www.myjoyonline.com",

    "text": "Dominic Solanke will miss Tottenham's trip to Newcastle on Sunday / © AFP\nTottenham will be without both Dominic Solanke and Richarlison for Sunday's Premier League trip to Newcastle.\nManager Ange Postecoglou said he would not risk new signing Solanke's ankle injury with a north London derby to come against Arsenal on September 15.\nRicharlison's injury issues persist with the Brazilian picking up a muscle problem that means captain Son Heung-min will likely start as a centre-forward.\n\"Dom is close but we're going to be a bit cautious with him, we've got a big programme post the international break, so he'll miss out on Sunday,\" said Postecoglou.\n\"The only other one we got midweek is Richarlison, who unfortunately picked up an injury in training, so he'll probably miss the next few weeks.\"\nTottenham have suffered 6-1 and 4-0 thrashings on their last two trips to St James' Park and Postecoglou is hoping his side have learned from the second of those humiliations, which came on his watch.\n\"It was a good learning curve for us that (4-0) game because we started OK, but we conceded and lost probably for the first time all year our composure in a game,\" said the Australian.\n\"We allowed them to score quickly and we know what it is like up there.\n\"The crowd create a brilliant atmosphere for their team and we just didn't handle it at all well.\"\nBoth Tottenham and Newcastle are aiming to get back into the Champions League next season.\nBut it is Europa League football for Spurs this campaign and they were handed some enticing ties in Friday's draw for the new-look league phase.\nFormer Celtic boss Postecoglou faces a frosty reception away to Rangers, while Roma will make the trip to London.\n\"Exciting. It's good to be a part of. Some good games,\" added Postecoglou.\n\"I am sure I will get a warm reception at Ibrox and they'll look forward to seeing me.\"",
