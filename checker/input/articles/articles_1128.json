    "title": "Water woes linger in New Orleans after wayward balloon causes power glitch, pressure drop",
    "text": "By Kevin McGill ,\n21 minutes ago\nUtility companies have warned for years about the hazards of Mylar balloons and that message was resounding Thursday across New Orleans as most of the city's nearly 370,000 residents remained under a boil water advisory after a wayward balloon hit power lines near a treatment plant.\nThe metallic, film-coated balloons are pretty, shiny things when they leave one's hand. Balloon releases are a popular way to celebrate big events. But they are litter when they come down. And environmentalists have long complained about the dangers they pose to wildlife. And, as New Orleans was reminded this week, they can be a big problem for utilities.\nWhat happened in New Orleans?\nEntergy New Orleans, which supplies electricity in the city, said a floating Mylar balloon struck a power line near the water plant Tuesday night. It just caused a momentary “flicker” of power at the facility. But the head of the agency that runs the city's drinking water, sewerage and street drainage systems said that was enough to knock out four key pumps that keep the water flowing.\nAn unspecified injury to one of the workers tasked with getting pumps started again caused a delay that allowed water pressure to drop. Low pressure can allow bacteria to enter leaks in the system, so, as a precaution, a boil-water advisory was issued Tuesday night. Officials lifted the advisory for a small area on the west bank of the Mississippi River on Thursday. But test results showed possible contamination on the east bank where the advisory remained in effect for the majority of the city's nearly 370,000 people.\nDoes this happen often?\nIt happens often enough that many utility companies have been taking note for years.\n“They are a very big hazard to our system,” said Shelton Hudson, director of reliability for Entergy. “Typically in the seasons of folks having graduations and birthdays and different things like that.”\nSt. Louis-based Ameren Corporation, which provides electrical service in Illinois and Missouri , said there were 582 balloon-related outages nationwide last year, affecting 800,000 customers. Public Service Electric & Gas, New Jersey’s largest utility, reported in 2020 that it had experienced a 26% increase in outages caused by Mylar balloons over a five-year period.\nEntergy and other utilities have safety tips on their websites that include keeping Mylar balloons indoors, tying them down with weights or anchoring them to secure objects and deflating and disposing of them once the celebration is over.\nOther concerns\nUtility lines aren't the only worry. Environmentalists and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service say balloon remnants are a hazard to wildlife. Birds , turtles and other animals sometimes try to eat the remnants, causing injury or death, according to the USFWS.\nRemedies\nSome communities have gone so far as to ban balloon releases. Galveston, Texas, for instance, outlawed outdoor balloon releases in 2021, Texas news outlets reported. But there has been pushback from business interests. The Balloon Council, an industry group, says on its website that it endorses a California law passed in 1990 that regulates helium-filled Mylar balloons. But the group has been critical of other laws in recent years that it says have been too restrictive and harmful to business.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "title": "‘It was like coming from hell’: Gaza residents return to kites in Aotearoa | The Spinoff",
    "text": "Last Saturday, at Takaparawhā, Kites flew in solidarity with Gaza as Palestinians spoke of their experiences. Benjamin Everitt was there to document. Sami Salman and his two children, Yakoub and Abraham, watched as a soar of kites flew over the grass at Bastion Point Park in Mission Bay. The kites were all colours, but red and green were particularly strong. The event, which saw a turnout in the hundreds, was part of a social media global movement of kite flying in solidarity with those suffering an ongoing genocide in Gaza. For Salman and his sons, it was particularly close to home: They had just arrived in New Zealand last week from Gaza. People at the park had picnics and flew kites with messages demanding Israel to hold a ceasefire. One kite that particularly stood out, was a kite raising a pennant of South African flags, referencing the country’s [claims against Israel of committing genocidal](https://apnews.com/article/world-court-israel-genocide-gaza-south-africa-774ab3c3d57fd7bcc627602eaf47fd98) acts towards the Palestinian people during the war with Hamas. The case was brought on December 29, 2023, with a request for provisional measures held this week on January 11 and 12. Yakoub Salman, Sami’s eldest son, was born in Ōtāhuhu but calls Gaza his home. He and his brother Arbaham have lived between Aotearoa and occupied Palestine throughout their lives. He described the experience of leaving Gaza: “It was like coming from hell, and there was very little food and water. You’re just searching for food everyday. It’s hard to find. The water is not pure, but that’s all you can find.” In Gaza, “we were having a very hard time. Our neighbours were beheaded by rockets. My best friend passed away,” said Salman. His younger son Abraham was born in 2012 in Gaza, and throughout his life he has witnessed five wars. The brothers hold New Zealand citizenship, and have lived between Aotearoa New Zealand and Occupied Palestine. The family were able to return to Aotearoa by contacting the embassy in Cairo. As Israel checks the names and identification of every person that enters and leaves the Gaza Strip, it took them a month and ten days for their sons to be enrolled and approved to leave the border. “Once [my sons] were enrolled in the embassy, I felt better,” Salman said. But due to issues with citizenship, his sister and mother are still in Gaza. “As of two days ago, the [Israeli Defence Force] cut the internet in Gaza and I don’t know anything about them.” He worried that because many of Gaza and the West Bank’s roads aren’t documented on Google maps, the IDF will destroy much of them “without the media knowing about them”. To conclude their time at the event, the Salman family and friends called for prayer, looking outwards towards the sunset glistening on the water along the Waitematā Harbour. Since October 7, over 24,620 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces, according to [figures](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/jan/18/middle-east-crisis-live-updates-latest-news-us-military-strikes-houthi-rebels-yemen-pakistan-attack-iran?page=with:block-65a92b878f08c266d9820267#block-65a92b878f08c266d9820267) from the Gaza Health Authority on Thursday. Last Monday, the day after the kites flew, marked 100 days of relentless attacks on their home.",

    "title": "A rebel group in the Indian state of Assam signs a peace accord with the government",
    "text": "A rebel group that fought for decades to free India’s northeastern state of Assam from New Delhi’s rule on Friday signed a peace accord with the government pledging to end the insurgency in the region. The United Liberation Front of Asom or ULFA, led by Arabinda Rajkhowa, concluded 12 years of negotiations with the Indian government. The signing ceremony in New Delhi was attended by India’s Home Minister Amit Shah and the top elected official of Assam state Himanta Biswa Sarma. However, the group’s hard-line faction, led by Paresh Baruah, is not part of the agreement. Baruah is believed to be hiding somewhere along the China-Myanmar border, the Press Trust of India news agency said. ULFA, formed in 1979 demanding a “sovereign Assam,” carried out a reign of terror in Assam state in the late 1980s, including extortion, kidnappings and killings, especially targeting the state’s flourishing tea companies. It killed several tea planters. India banned ULFA in 1990. It then set up bases in neighboring Bangladesh and coordinated with several other insurgent groups in India’s northeast. Indian military operations against ULFA began in 1990 and have continued until the present. In 2011, ULFA split after Bangladesh handed over several top ULFA leaders, including Rajkhowa, to Indian authorities. The Rajkhowa faction joined peace talks with the Indian government that year. ULFA shifted its base to Bhutan, but in 2003 it was attacked by the Indian and Bhutanese armies. Rebels were dislodged from 30 camps in the Bhutanese jungles. Indian forces are battling dozens of ethnic insurgent groups in India’s remote northeast who are pushing demands ranging from independent homelands to maximum autonomy within India. In 2020, more than 600 insurgents belonging to different rebel groups surrendered to Indian authorities in the northeast in response to a government peace initiative that will allow them to rejoin mainstream society, police said. They laid down assault rifles, grenades, bombs and other weapons and were kept in government-run camps and taught technical skills to equip them to take up jobs. ___ Wasbir Hussain reported from Guwahati, India.",

    "text": "- \"I want to ensure workers that we are alert and we will not abandon them.\" - Further, the head of state proposed a deduction of House Levy from salaried Kenyans under the Finance Act 2023. Central Organisation of Trade Unions (COTU-K) Secretary General Francis Atwoli has urged employers to increase the salaries of their employees in 2024. Atwoli said the new year will not be the same as Kenyans have lost their purchasing power due to the poor economy, as it requires a lot of panel beating. \"I want to urge our employers to consider increasing the salaries of workers for the hard work Kenyans are trying to display; we must improve the working conditions of our workers,\" he said. He further added that as a responsible trade union in the continent and the world, the body will ensure the workers' double efforts to ensure they supplement the work being done. \"As we redouble our efforts, we need to be compensated; that is our policy. I want to ensure workers that we are alert and we will not abandon them.\" Additionally, Atwoli said the union will vigorously 'fight' for the rights of the workers in 2024 to ensure they are comfortable, even as the country experiences different dynamics. \"We must do something for our people.\" The country has experienced a skyrocketing cost of living, with increased taxes as most employee's salaries remained the same. President William Ruto's administration announced an increase in the National Social Security Fund (NSSF) deduction for employed Kenyans. Further, salaried Kenyans are still being deducted 1.5 per cent of their gross salary for the housing levy under the Finance Act 2023.",
