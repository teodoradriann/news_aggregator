    "title": "Online lender slapped for allegedly deploying unlicensed LOs",
    "text": "California-headquartered\nLoanSnap was hit with a temporary order to cease and desist from Connecticut’s Department of Banking for “systemic” unlicensed mortgage loan origination activity.\nConnecticut Banking Commissioner Jorge Perez alleged that LoanSnap violated the\nTruth in Lending Act (TILA) and Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). But the crux of the commissioner’s findings focuses on unlicensed origination activities.\nFrom at least August 29, 2022 to December 2, 2022, individuals who were not licensed as\n loan officers (LOs) in Connecticut acted as LOs by taking residential mortgage loan applications, soliciting Connecticut borrowers for mortgages and offering or negotiating terms of mortgages, according to the order issued earlier this month.\nUnlicensed LOs made the first contact with a potential borrower by using purchased leads from lead generators, such as\nLendingTree, to make outbound calls to potential borrowers. These individuals also received inbound calls from individuals interested in obtaining mortgage loans, the order stated.\nThe commissioner alleged unlicensed LOs discussed the available products offered by SnapDoc based on the information obtained from the potential borrower. The individuals then made an initial determination as to whether there is a loan product available to the potential borrower.\nOnce an unlicensed LO deemed a potential borrower qualified for one of LoanSnap’s loan products based on the information gathered – via text, electronic mail, telephone call and additional verification documentation he or she required the potential borrower to submit – the unlicensed MLO then sent the file to a licensed LO.\nThe bulk of the origination work was performed by unlicensed LOs, generally titled as “sales development representatives” or “call center representatives,” according to commissioner Perez.\nOn LinkedIn, unlicensed individuals represented their job titles as a “mortgage loan officer” or included job descriptions including “prequalified inbound leads for the senior mortgage loan officers – over 100 calls per day” or “connection point between potential mortgage and refi-takers,” the order stated.\nConnecticut’s Banking Department provided LoanSnap an opportunity to show compliance for the retention of its mortgage lender license in Connecticut before issuing the order but received a written response from the lender denying the allegations asserted in the compliance letter.\nPerez directed LoanSnap to cease unlicensed LOs from taking any mortgage applications and for unlicensed LOs to disclose their Connecticut licensing status to a potential borrower, the regulator said.\nA hearing – scheduled for March 14 – was granted to LoanSnap within 14 days following the lender’s receipt of the temporary order to cease and desist and a failure to request a hearing will result in the allegations deemed admitted, according to the order.\nLoanSnap requested a hearing, according to Connecticut’s Department of Banking.\nLoanSnap didn’t respond to HousingWire’s requests for comment.\nThe California-headquartered lender has 44 state licenses with 6 sponsored LOs, according to the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System (NMLS).\nLoanSnap originated $3 million in production volume over the past year across 32 units, data from mortgage technology platform Modex showed.\nIn 2021, LoanSnap secured $30 million in series B financing led by True Ventures. Also participating in the funding included prior investors Baseline Ventures, Richard Branson’s Virgin Group, and MANTIS, according to the company’s previous release.",

    "text": "--News Direct-- Geneva, Switzerland, December 28, 2023 – TRON DAO is at the forefront of the evolving cryptocurrency payments landscape, as seen in the recent release of the insightful Messari Report: Crypto Theses 2024 . This pivotal report highlights the accelerating shift towards USDT on TRON DAO, particularly for store of value and payment functionalities, predominantly in developing nations. This recent Messari report reveals that an impressive 40% of USDT demand now stems from its use as a stable store of value and a reliable payment method. This trend is especially pronounced in emerging economies, indicating a leap towards more equitable Payment opportunities and stability. TRON DAO, with its robust infrastructure and commitment to accessibility, is pivotal in facilitating this global Payment paradigm shift. With over 200 million accounts and in excess of 6 billion transactions to date, TRON DAO is leading the charge towards a global crypto payment network. Its mission is to create an ecosystem where opportunities and access are universal, breaking down the traditional barriers of payment. \"Understanding the crucial role of blockchain technology in shaping the future, TRON DAO contributors are committed to fostering a more inclusive and efficient global system,\" shared by Dave Uhryniak, Ecosystem Lead at the TRON DAO. His sentiment reflects a broader vision, one where digital assets like USDT on TRON DAO become tools for empowerment and payment inclusion. The Messari Report also sheds light on the significant user migration from traditional stablecoins like USDC to USDT on TRON DAO. Users are increasingly drawn to TRON DAO for its proven efficiency, lower costs, and faster transaction speeds, marking a notable shift in user preference and trust. As TRON DAO continues to navigate and shape the digital payment landscape, it remains dedicated to innovation, user empowerment, and the continuous expansion of its network. The insights from the Messari Report affirm the significant role TRON DAO plays in the global shift towards digital solutions. About TRON DAO TRON DAO is a community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet via blockchain technology and dApps. Founded in September 2017 by H.E. Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of December 2023, it has over 202.59 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 6.89 billion total transactions, and over $20.53 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government’s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (“DMC”), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica’s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.

    "title": "Former Border Officials Slam Biden After Arrests of 8 Illegal Aliens with Suspected Ties to ISIS",
    "text": "Eight Tajikistan nationals with suspected ties to the Islamic State were arrested across three U.S. cities in recent days.\nAll eight men entered the U.S. illegally through the southern border and passed initial background checks, according to federal sources that told Fox News the men were “fully vetted.” But passing a background check often does not mean much, according to Thomas Homan, the former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement under former President Donald Trump.\n“Thousands of terrorists in the world are not found in any database,” Homan told The Daily Signal. “That is why we need to end catch and release and reestablish the Remain in Mexico [policy].”\nHoman said he has been raising concerns about the vulnerability of the southern border for three years because the sheer numbers arriving at the southern border daily are preventing Border Patrol from conducting proper vetting of illegal aliens through deep dive interviews and other means.\n“Federal law requires that illegal aliens that enter the U.S. llegally ‘shall be detained,’” Homan said. “The Biden administration needs to stop ignoring the law, stop violating the law and secure our border. You will never have strong national security without strong border security.”\nFormer Border Patrol Chief Rodney Scott echoed Homan, telling The Daily Signal that border security “has always been fundamentally” about preventing illegal entry.\n“The entire purpose is to identify and prevent threats from ever entering our home,” Scott said. “The Biden administration soundly rejected this common sense public safety principle in favor of a reactionary strategy that lets everyone into our home and then tries to sort out the threats afterwards. Now we are seeing the results.”\nThe White House did not respond to The Daily Signal’s request for comment.\nICE worked with the FBI to make the arrests of the Tajikistan nationals in Los Angeles, New York and Philadelphia, the New York Post’s Jennie Taer first reported .\nICE arrested six of the men after the FBI flagged their suspected ties to the radical Islamic terrorist groups. The two other men in the group were apprehended following surveillance over the course of several months, according to NBC.\nA wiretap was a part of the investigation into the illegal aliens, which revealed one of the now apprehended men reportedly talking about bombs.\nThe Department of Homeland Security and FBI told The New York Post in a joint statement that the arrests were “carried out in close coordination with the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Forces. The individuals arrested are detained in ICE custody pending removal proceedings.”\nBetween the beginning of fiscal year 2017 and end of fiscal year 2020, Border Patrol apprehended 11 individuals on America’s terrorist watch list between ports of entry at the southern border. Since the beginning of fiscal year 2021 to present, Border Patrol has apprehended 362 illegal aliens on the terror watch list between ports at the southern border.",

    "title": "AI Companies Exhaust Human Knowledge, Run Out of Training Data, Musk Warns",
    "text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) companies are grappling with a pressing dilemma: the depletion of human-generated data needed to train their models. Elon Musk, the renowned entrepreneur and tech innovator, recently shed light on this issue, declaring that the “cumulative sum of human knowledge has been exhausted” for AI progress. Musk believes the future lies in synthetic data—facts created by AI itself—to sustain the growth of these systems. This transition is already in motion, with industry giants like Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI embracing synthetic data to enhance their AI models.\nDuring a live discussion on his social media platform, X, Musk elaborated, “The cumulative sum of human knowledge has been exhausted in the formation of artificial intelligence (AI). That happened basically last year.” His remarks highlight the growing urgency for AI developers to seek alternative data sources as conventional datasets become increasingly scarce.\nHow AI Training Works AI models, such as OpenAI’s GPT-4, depend on massive datasets to learn and predict patterns. These systems are trained on data harvested from the internet, enabling them to perform tasks like generating text or predicting the next word in a sentence.However,as Musk noted,the supply of high-quality,human-generated data is shrinking. “The only way to fill this data is with synthetic ones,” he emphasized,underscoring the necessity for AI to produce its own training material.\nMusk further explained the process, stating, “He will write some kind of essay or come up with a thesis and then he will qualify and … go through this self-learning process.” this self-referential method allows AI systems to generate and refine their own datasets, ensuring continuous improvement even as conventional data sources diminish.\nThe Rise of Synthetic Data Major tech companies are already harnessing synthetic data to bolster their AI capabilities. Meta, such as, utilized synthetic data to refine its Llama AI model, while microsoft incorporated AI-generated content into its Phi-4 model. Similarly, Google and OpenAI have integrated synthetic data into their AI development pipelines.\nThough, this approach is not without its challenges.Musk cautioned against the phenomenon of AI “hallucinations,” where models produce inaccurate or nonsensical outputs. “How do you know if … he’s hallucinating the answer or if it’s a real answer?” Musk questioned during his interview with mark Penn, chairman of advertising group Stagwell. This unpredictability presents a meaningful hurdle for developers relying on synthetic data.\nLegal and Ethical Implications The rapid advancement of AI has also ignited legal disputes over data ownership and usage. As synthetic data becomes more prevalent, questions arise about intellectual property rights and the ethical implications of AI-generated content. Developers must navigate these complexities to ensure compliance with evolving regulations and maintain public trust.\nWhat Are Some of the Ethical Considerations Surrounding the Use of Synthetic Data in AI Development? The use of synthetic data raises several ethical concerns. One major issue is the potential for bias. If AI systems generate their own training data, they may inadvertently perpetuate or amplify existing biases. Additionally, the lack of transparency in how synthetic data is created and used can lead to accountability challenges. Developers must prioritize fairness, transparency, and accountability to address these concerns effectively.\nAs the AI industry continues to evolve, the shift toward synthetic data represents both an opportunity and a challenge.While it offers a solution to the scarcity of human-generated data, it also demands careful consideration of the legal, ethical, and technical implications. By addressing these issues head-on,developers can pave the way for a more lasting and responsible future for AI.\nThe future of AI development: Navigating the Shift to Synthetic Data As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to evolve, the industry faces a critical juncture: the exhaustion of human-generated data. OpenAI has openly acknowledged that tools like ChatGPT would not exist without access to copyrighted material. This revelation has sparked a heated debate,with creative industries and publishers demanding compensation for the use of their content in AI training processes.The control and quality of data have become central issues in this ongoing discussion,raising questions about ethics,innovation,and the future of AI.\nWith the demand for AI technologies skyrocketing, the industry must address these challenges while maintaining ethical and sustainable practices. Synthetic data has emerged as a promising solution, offering a way to bypass the limitations of human-generated data. Though, its potential pitfalls and limitations underscore the need for careful oversight and continuous innovation.\nElon Musk recently highlighted the importance of this shift, stating that the cumulative sum of human knowledge has been exhausted for training AI models. This observation marks a turning point in AI development.

Here’s what she had to say:\nInterviewer: Good afternoon, Dr. Carter. thank you for joining us today. as an expert in AI and synthetic data, what are your thoughts on Elon Musk’s recent statement about the exhaustion of human-generated data for training AI models?\nDr. Evelyn Carter: Thank you for having me. Elon Musk’s observation is both timely and critical. The rapid advancement of AI has indeed led to a situation where the vast reservoirs of human-generated data—text,images,videos,and more—are being fully utilized. This is not just a theoretical concern; it’s a practical bottleneck. AI models, especially large language models, require enormous amounts of data to learn and improve. If we’ve reached a point where human-generated data is no longer sufficient, it’s imperative that we explore alternative solutions. Synthetic data is one such solution,and it’s already gaining traction in the industry.\nInterviewer: Can you explain what synthetic data is and how it differs from human-generated data?\nDr.Evelyn Carter: Absolutely. Synthetic data is artificially generated information that mimics real-world data. It’s created by algorithms rather than collected from human activities. For example, instead of using millions of real photographs to train an image recognition system, we can generate synthetic images that simulate the same conditions—lighting, angles, objects, etc.The key advantage is that synthetic data can be tailored to specific needs, free from biases or privacy concerns that frequently enough accompany human-generated data.\nInterviewer: That sounds promising. But are there any risks or limitations associated with relying on synthetic data?\nDr. Evelyn carter: There are certainly challenges. One major concern is the potential for synthetic data to introduce its own biases or inaccuracies. If the algorithms generating the data are flawed, the resulting data could perpetuate or even amplify those flaws. Additionally, synthetic data must be rigorously validated to ensure it accurately represents real-world scenarios. Or else, AI models trained on such data might perform poorly when deployed in practical applications. It’s a delicate balance, and the industry is still learning how to navigate these complexities.\nThe Road Ahead: Balancing Innovation and Responsibility As the AI industry grapples with the shift to synthetic data, the stakes are high. While synthetic data offers a way to overcome the limitations of human-generated data, it also introduces new challenges that must be addressed. Companies must prioritize transparency, validation, and ethical practices to ensure that AI models remain reliable and effective.\nDr. Carter’s insights highlight the importance of careful oversight and innovation in this rapidly evolving field. As Elon Musk aptly put it, the journey ahead is both exciting and uncertain. The future of AI will depend on how well the industry can balance the promise of synthetic data with the responsibility of addressing its risks.\nthe exhaustion of human-generated data marks a pivotal moment in AI development. Synthetic data offers a path forward, but its success will depend on the industry’s ability to innovate responsibly. by addressing the ethical considerations and technical challenges, we can ensure that AI continues to evolve in a way that benefits society as a whole.\nThe Rise of Synthetic Data: Shaping the Future of AI Development In a rapidly evolving technological landscape, synthetic data is emerging as a game-changer for artificial intelligence (AI) development.Industry leaders like Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI are already leveraging this innovative approach to refine their AI systems.

    "text": "Los fuertes vientos asociados a un frente frío que se adentró este jueves en el occidente cubano derribó un gigantesco árbol en El Vedado que era conocido por sus residentes como \"El Coloso\". El fotógrafo Pedro Luis García publicó en \"Se cayó el coloso que daba sombra a las colas del CUPET de Línea y E\", expresó un internauta en la sección de comentarios al post. Otra usuaria de la red dijo que también \"el fuerte viento sacó una cama balinesa de la piscina del hotel Cohiba, que estaba en un tercer piso, y la lanzó a la calle 3ra\". Un vecino de la zona agregó que \"ahora se mete ese árbol ahí unos cuantos meses hecho trozos como pasó en E entre Línea y 11. Y para sembrar uno se meterán 50 años si es que siembran alguno en el hueco que quedó\". Este jueves también se reportó [un tornado en el municipio matancero Los Arabos](https://www.cibercuba.com/noticias/2023-12-28-u1-e199894-s27061-tornado-causa-destrozos-arabos-matanzas), que ocasionó afectaciones en casas y las redes eléctricas. El [Instituto de Meteorología](http://www.insmet.cu/asp/genesis.asp?TB0=PLANTILLAS&TB1=NI&TB2=/Pronostico/NI.txt) afirmó que estos hechos están asociados al séptimo frente frío de la actual temporada invernal, y que a consecuencia del cual se reportan condiciones severas del tiempo. El frente frío generó \"una vaguada prefrontal que se desplazó al este desde horas de la madrugada con áreas de chubascos, lluvias y tormentas eléctricas, que llegaron a ser fuertes en algunas localidades con la ocurrencia de tiempo severo\", precisó el último parte meteorológico. Agrega que entre las 3 y las 3:30 AM, se produjo caída de granizos del tamaño de un chícharo, además de vientos lineales fuertes en Pinar del Río por un área de tormenta. Esta luego se desplazó a La Habana y generó una racha de viento fuerte del Norte a las 9 de la mañana de 92 kilómetros por horas, en la estación meteorológica de Casablanca. \"Posteriormente, en su avance sobre el occidente, se reportó la afectación de un tornado en la comunidad de Los Arabos, Matanzas a las 10:40 AM\", y se \"reportan daños en las viviendas, arbolado y tendidos eléctricos\", precisó la información. El fotógrafo cubano Carlos Espinosa Betancourt, moderador del grupo de Facebook \"Fotos de La Habana\", captó este jueves el [impresionante momento en que el frente frío entró](https://www.cibercuba.com/noticias/2023-12-28-u1-e199894-s27061-impresionante-foto-frente-frio-entrando-habana) en La Habana. En su grupo de la red social el [artista](https://www.cibercuba.com/noticias/2023-03-11-u1-e43231-s27061-revelan-quedaria-bandera-hormigon-construida-tribuna) publicó una imagen del frente frío entrando a la isla que fue captada en el malecón habanero, aparentemente después del amanecer. La fotografía fue publicada aproximadamente a las 08:30 am y muestra una densa nube de aire frío sobre el mar, casi posicionándose sobre la ciudad. Una seguidora dijo que la imagen también fue replicada al inicio del noticiero del mediodía en Cuba, donde la llegada del fenómeno meteorológico ha traído asociado fuertes vientos que ocasionaron la caída de árboles en la capital. ¿Qué opinas?
