    "title": "News | Bay Area Scraps $20 Billion Housing Bond From November's Ballot",
    "text": "A $20 billion bond touted as California's largest affordable housing measure in history has been pulled from November’s election ballot amid fears that it wouldn’t garner enough votes to pass. The Bay Area Housing Finance Authority decided at its meeting Wednesday to delay a vote on the [bond proposal](https://www.costar.com/article/30162848/bay-area-residents-to-vote-on-20-billion-housing-bond) intended to raise up to $20 billion for affordable housing in the San Francisco Bay Area until at least 2026. Authority members worried about the prospects of a separate referendum on the statewide ballot, Proposition 5, to lower the threshold for a bond to pass to 55% of voters. If that failed, the housing bond would need support from two-thirds of voters. “The challenge we’re having is the tie that our bond measure has to State Proposition 5,” Andrew Fremier, executive director of the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, which helps with future planning for the Bay Area, told the authority before the vote. “We all felt it had a chance at 55%.” [Authority members were more optimistic in June](https://www.costar.com/article/30162848/bay-area-residents-to-vote-on-20-billion-housing-bond) when they opted to put the housing bond on the ballot in San Francisco and eight adjoining counties. The measure could make funding available to develop or preserve about 70,000 residences for households with low or moderate incomes. An authority survey found that 55% of voters seemed likely to support the regional bond, though some had misgivings about paying higher taxes to do so. Besides questions about [the statewide referendum](http://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_5,_Lower_Supermajority_Requirement_to_55%25_for_Local_Bond_Measures_to_Fund_Housing_and_Public_Infrastructure_Amendment_(2024)), the authority faced a recent lawsuit filed by a group of individuals opposed to the bond who said the authority had misled the public about the measure’s cost. Amie Fishman, executive director of the Nonprofit Housing Association of Northern California, said at Wednesday’s meeting that “legal and campaign challenges from extremist anti-housing and anti-government activists” led to the move to withdraw the ballot proposal. She said if Proposition 5 passes, the housing measure could be tried again in 2026. But Jim Sperling, an authority member, was skeptical of that timing since voters will be deciding that year on a regional bond for spending on transportation. “If I’d had my way, I would have rolled the dice” by leaving the bond on the ballot this year, Sperling said at the meeting.",

It's no longer serving the demands of modern hiring — especially in high-volume, high-turnover industries, such as retail and manufacturing. We needed something more adaptive, more human, and that’s Winston. He’s not just a feature; he's the future of recruitment technology, designed to remove the manual, administrative burden from hiring teams, giving them back the time to focus on the heart of hiring: connecting with great talent.”\nWinston: Elevating Recruitment Efficiency\nIn a market crowded with half-baked AI tools that only address limited aspects of the hiring process, Winston stands apart by being a truly comprehensive, AI-driven solution built on the foundational strength of SmartRecruiters' ATS workflow and data model. From intelligent scheduling to real-time agentic insights to an adaptive ui that evolves based on user behavior and context, Winston enables teams to run leaner, faster, and more effectively than ever before. He doesn’t just assist; he eliminates the most time-consuming, low-value tasks and constantly optimizes the hiring process to ensure maximum efficiency. While high-volume, high-turnover hiring is Winston's initial core focus, long-term plans call for continued feature development, unlocking possibilities across a wide range of additional industries and hiring scenarios\nPowering the New SmartRecruiters Platform\nAs the driving force behind SmartRecruiters 3.0, Winston redefines how recruitment technology serves businesses. By pushing the boundaries of what talent acquisition software can do, SmartRecruiters is creating a smarter, more intuitive platform that adapts to the evolving needs of hiring teams. Winston will power SmartRecruiters at every touchpoint, transforming traditionally cumbersome recruitment processes into seamless, even joyful, experiences for both recruiters and candidates.\nShiran Yaroslavsky, SVP of Product at SmartRecruiters, reinforced this vision: \"Winston represents a seismic shift in recruitment technology. We're not just automating tasks; we're eliminating the inefficiencies that have plagued this industry for decades.

    "text": "PARK FIELDHOUSE — Through the first 17 minutes, the highly anticipated showdown between two of Racine’s top teams lived up to the hype.\nPark, ranked No. 4 in the Division 2 Coaches Poll, entered the final minute of an exciting first half with a 34-33 lead over Racine Lutheran, ranked No. 3 in the Division 3 poll.\nTwo minutes of game time later, it was all but over. The Panthers hit the Crusaders with a 12-0 run, and Racine Lutheran never recovered.\nIn front of a standing-room-only crowd, Park (11-1) used its suffocating defense to pull away from the Crusaders (14-1) for an 83-69 victory Wednesday night.\n“It’s always fun playing another team from the city,” Park coach Casey Robbins said. “I think we played really well. We know how we’re going to play. We just can’t let other teams dictate our tempo.”\nDespite a one-day postponement and a gameday blizzard, Park Fieldhouse was packed by tipoff Wednesday night. Not only were stands full for both sides, but nearly every other varsity boys basketball coach in the city also attended to see how this matchup would play out.\nPark sophomore Zare Gwinn reacts to a foul call in the second half of his team’s 83-69 win over Racine Lutheran Wednesday night at Park Fieldhouse.

Credit: Matt Hardesty / Racine County Eye A frantic first half flips at the end With a loud and energized crowd, both teams had plenty of early nerves. Despite playing at a breakneck pace, the game remained scoreless for the first three minutes. But once Racine Lutheran junior Sam Pitrof got a putback attempt to fall, the race was on.\nThe teams traded baskets and runs throughout the half until the final minute. Pitrof pulled the Crusaders within one point by tipping in a half-court lob, but Park quickly responded with their own basket.\nOn the next possession, the Panthers double-teamed Pitrof and forced a turnover. On the ensuing fastbreak, senior Isaiah Robinson threw a no-look pass to sophomore Cole Betker for an open layup. The ensuing inbounds pass was not high enough to get over the defending Betker, who intercepted the pass and laid it in for another easy bucket in the final seconds of the half.\n“That was pretty impressive,” Robbins said about the end of the first half. “Cole just times it really well. He’s not the most athletic, but he’s one of the smartest kids. He’s a great teammate.”\nAfter playing hard for the entire first half, Racine Lutheran suddenly found itself on the ropes.\n“That wasn’t anything new,” Robinson said. “We like getting after teams and diving on loose balls. We’re a great second-half team.”\nPanthers land a quick knockout after halftime Park started the second half with possession, and Betker picked up where he left off by burying a three-pointer. The Panthers then forced a stop and within seconds, senior Jaxson Moss hit another shot from deep.\nThe Crusaders settled in after the slow start but couldn’t make up any ground until it was too late. Turnovers and struggles at the free-throw line stalled any comeback.\n“We knew what they are capable of, so we had to just keep playing our game,” Betker said.\nWith relentless pressure from the start, Park finished with 17 steals. Statistics have yet to be finalized for Racine Lutheran, but there were many unforced turnovers as well.\nBoth teams were in foul trouble throughout the game, with 38 fouls called. The Crusaders had chances to cut into the deficit at the foul line but made just seven of 26 free-throw attempts. Racine Lutheran entered the game shooting 67 percent on free throws.\n“Things like that happen in city games,” Racine Lutheran coach Justin Hullum said. “I’ve been doing this for a little while and seen it, that’s what happened. The lid was on the hoop for us tonight.”\nThe Crusaders pulled within nine in the final two minutes and had several chances to get closer, but they could not get enough shots to fall. Racine Lutheran, which made 13 three-pointers in a 111-46 win over Milwaukee Lifelong Learning on Saturday, was held to two made shots from deep and none in the second half.\nRobinson led all players with 29 points and added six assists and four rebounds. Betker scored a career-high 15 points and had four steals. Jaxson Moss finished with 17 points, 10 rebounds, five steals, three blocks and two assists.\nThe Crusaders were led by senior Justin Jones, who was held scoreless in the first half but scored 21 in the second half. Pitrof finished with 17 points, 15 of which were in the first half. Sophomore Bryce Austin added 10 points.\nA statement made by Park On Wednesday night, the Panthers showed that they are a team still capable of meeting big moments. Facing a team that was playing as well as any in the state up to this point, Park dictated the style of the game and used a balanced attack to stay in control.\nThe Panthers are no strangers to big games in recent years. Last season ended with Park playing admirably in a loss to Wisconsin Lutheran, the top team in the state at any level that also featured Wisconsin’s 2024 Mr. Basketball.\nWith nearly every piece returning from that team, there is a sense of confidence throughout the program that no challenge faced this season will compare to the one they ended last year against.\n“Last year we got all of our nerves out playing against Wisconsin Lutheran and other big schools,” Robinson said. “These feel like a normal game for us now.”\nWith four players averaging more than eight points per game, the Panthers have shown enough experience, depth, and talent to potentially reach the WIAA State Basketball Tournament for the first time in 65 years.\nLessons Learned for Racine Lutheran Wednesday’s loss could be a blessing in disguise for the Crusaders. Every game against a quality opponent is a learning opportunity, and there is plenty to learn from for Hullum and his team.\n“We have to get mentally tougher,” Hullum said. “Mental toughness is hard to teach because it’s not an X’s and O’s thing, it’s a mentality. The only way to get mentally tough is to play tough opponents like this, get put into situations, and then grow.”\nPlaying in one of the toughest conferences in the state, Racine Lutheran will get plenty more opportunities to play great teams and grow. The Crusaders have experience but still are on the younger side with just two seniors on the roster. Finding comfort and confidence in stressful moments would go a long way in their development.\nA fitting result With the loss, Racine Lutheran fell just short of completing a rare feat: beating all five teams in the Racine area. The Crusaders had previously beaten Case, St. Catherine’s (in overtime), and Horlick, and will face Prairie twice in the upcoming month.\nPark’s win also means that no team will finish undefeated against the rest of the city. The Panthers have wins over Case, Horlick and now Racine Lutheran, but lost in overtime to St. Catherine’s. In a year where basketball across the city seems better than ever, it’s only fitting that there is also parity throughout.",

    "text": "PASCO COUNTY — Christina Goodwin’s post-Army life hasn’t been easy. “I was just kind of existing. I was struggling. I couldn’t find a place to work. I couldn’t do anything and the stresses of everyday life,” said Goodwin. Christina says those stresses were exacerbated by trauma from her time in the Army and drug addiction. “I finally said I needed something better. I can’t keep living like this,” she said. That’s when she found help from Pasco County’s One Community Now and its Veteran’s Support Center. It’s a place where veterans can get direction in life and the resources they need to get back on their feet. Army Veteran Stephen Petrosino is the director and says many who come are homeless. “It tugs at your heart. It tugs at my heart a bit. I’m red, white, and blue through. Nothing I can do about that so what I do here is God's blessing. It’s a blessing for me to continue serving,” said Petrosino. The biggest event One Community Now holds for veterans is Operation Stand Down on April 19th and 20th. All in one place, veterans can find everything from medical help to hair cuts, and even a special veterans court. “Just in all a morale booster. And the thing is a lot of veterans don’t know what’s out there to help them,” said Petrosino. Christina’s situation is getting better. She says she’s been clean for 15 months, has a new job, and will be at Stand Down as a volunteer. “I love the life I have now versus what I had before. And I just keep going and try to help everybody,” said Goodwin. For more information on Operation Stand Down go to https://www.ocnstanddown.org/index.html .",

    "title": "CEO of telehealth company Done charged in online Adderall distribution scheme",
    "text": "The founder and CEO of a California-based telehealth company was arrested and charged on Thursday for her involvement in an alleged scheme to distribute Adderall over the internet and commit healthcare fraud. Ruthia He, the founder and CEO of Done Global Inc., allegedly conspired with the company&#039;s clinical president, David Brody, and others to provide easy access to stimulants, including Adderall, a drug used to treat ADHD, in exchange for payment of a monthly subscription fee, the Justice Department said in a news release. He was arrested in Los Angeles and Brody in San Rafael, California on charges of conspiracy to distribute controlled substances and distribution of controlled substances. If convicted, they each face a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. It’s not clear if He and Brody have obtained attorneys who can speak on their behalf. He and Brody ran the scheme to &quot;unlawfully enrich themselves&quot; and made over $100 million by increasing monthly subscription revenue, which therefore increased the value of the company, federal officials said. Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri accused He and Brody of exploiting telemedicine &quot;and spending millions on deceptive advertisements on social media.&quot; &quot;They generated over $100 million in revenue by arranging for the prescription of over 40 million pills,&quot; Argentieri said in a statement. &quot;These charges are the Justice Department’s first criminal drug distribution prosecutions related to telemedicine prescribing through a digital health company. As these charges make clear, corporate executives who put profit over the health and safety of patients — including by using technological innovation — will be held to account.&quot; The pair allegedly obtained subscribers by spending millions on what officials called deceptive social media advertisements, targeting drug seekers, and intentionally structuring the Done platform to facilitate access to Adderall and other stimulants, the news release alleges. Part of the scheme allegedly included limiting the information available to Done prescribers and instructing them to prescribe Adderall and other stimulants even if the Done member did not qualify. He tried to maximize profits by adding an &quot;auto-refill&quot; function that allowed subscribers to elect to have a message requesting a refill of the drug every month, the Justice Department said. He and Brody are also accused of conspiring to defraud pharmacies as well as Medicare and Medicaid. The Justice Department said that He and Brody allegedly continued with the scheme even after being made aware that Done members had overdosed and died and that there was material posted online about how people could obtain Adderall and other stimulants from the company. Done, which says it makes high-quality psychiatric chronic care more affordable and accessible, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday. He and Brody could not be reached at phone numbers listed for them. In 2022, the Wall Street Journal reported that some clinicians said they felt that the company was pressuring them into prescribing stimulants. That same year, the Drug Enforcement Administration opened an investigation looking at Done&#039;s practice of prescribing controlled substances, the WSJ reported. The DEA lists Adderall as a schedule II drug with a high potential for abuse. It is included in the same category as Vicodin, OxyContin, and methamphetamine.

    "text": "29 mar, 2024 - 14:38 • [Aura Miguel](https://rr.sapo.pt/artigo/33576/aura-miguel) Nas [reflexões que escreveu para as 14 estações da Via Sacra desta Sexta-feira Santa](https://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/2024/documents/ns_lit_doc_20240329_via-crucis-meditazioni_po.html), o Papa propõe um caminho de diálogo com Jesus. Perante as incompreensões, incoerências e tantas cruzes pesadas que encontramos na vida; face aos medos, sofrimentos injustiças e angústias que nos afetam, Francisco fixa os olhos em Cristo e pede ajuda. O percurso até à Cruz é o pretexto para o Santo Padre refletir sobre o silêncio fecundo de Jesus quando, “no frenesim de correr e fazer, absorvido pelas coisas, tomado pelo medo de não continuar a figurar ou pela mania de me pôr no centro, não encontro tempo para parar e ficar convosco, para Vos deixar agir a Vós”. Ao meditar na paixão, reconhece que “a oração não nasce dos lábios que se movem, mas de um coração que sabe permanecer à escuta”. No conjunto destas 14 meditações, não faltam propostas de oração: “Venho até Vós, Senhor, com a minha história, com as minhas canseiras, com as minhas limitações e fragilidades, com os meus temores…” Ou então: “ajudai-me a baixar as defesas e deixar-me amar por Vós, precisamente no ponto onde tenho mais vergonha de mim mesmo. Curai-me de toda a presunção de auto-suficiência, de pensar que consigo sem Vós e sem os outros, da mania do perfeccionismo, curai-me, Jesus! “. Francisco recorda que muitos acompanham o espetáculo bárbaro da execução de Jesus e mesmo sem O conhecer nem conhecer a verdade, proferem sentenças e condenações, lançando sobre Ele infâmia e desprezo. “O mesmo acontece hoje, Senhor, e nem sequer é preciso um cortejo macabro: basta um teclado para insultar e publicar sentenças”, afirma. A propósito das mulheres de Jerusalém que lamentavam a morte de Jesus, o Papa implora: “Ajudai-nos a reconhecer a grandeza das mulheres, daquelas que foram fiéis e estiveram perto de Vós na Páscoa, mas também daquelas que ainda hoje são descartadas, sofrendo ultrajes e violências”. E, neste contexto, interroga: “À vista das tragédias do mundo, o meu coração permanece gelado ou enternece-se? Como reajo à loucura da guerra, a rostos de crianças que já não sabem sorrir, a mães que as veem desnutridas e famintas e não têm mais lágrimas para derramar?” Quando na Cruz, Jesus sente o abandono, Francisco reflete: “na escuridão dos meus porquês, encontro-Vos a Vós, luz na noite. E, no grito de tantas pessoas sozinhas e excluídas, oprimidas e abandonadas, revejo-Vos a Vós, meu Deus: fazei que Vos reconheça e Vos ame” E o Papa convida todos a repetir com ele: . “Jesus, fazei que Vos reconheça e vos ame nas crianças não nascidas e nas abandonadas, em tantos jovens à espera de alguém que ouça o seu grito de dor, nos inúmeros idosos descartados, nos presos e em quem vive sozinho, nos povos mais explorados e esquecidos”. Na meditação sobre o bom ladrão que, na última hora, vai para o paraíso, Francisco sublinha que “a oração pode mudar a história” e, porque “somos pobres de sins e ricos de ses“, o Papa pede ajuda a Maria para que nos leve pela mão, sempre que \"sou indulgente comigo mesmo e inflexível com os outros, quando deixo de lutar aceitando conviver com as minhas falsidades” ou “quando quero que a Igreja e o mundo mudem, mas eu não mudo.” Por fim, o Santo Padre pede que o Senhor “tenha piedade de mim, preguiçoso para me converter, de mim, que gosto muito de receber e pouco de dar, de mim, incapaz de me render ao vosso amor” e “do nosso mundo, infestado pelos túmulos do egoísmo”. A Via Sacra termina com 14 invocações finais a Jesus, com destaque para “os que estão sozinhos, os doentes, jóias da Igreja que unem os seus sofrimentos ao Vosso”. E também para ”as irmãs e os irmãos que, em muitas partes do mundo, sofrem perseguições por causa do vosso nome; aqueles que sofrem o drama da guerra e quantos, com a força que lhes vem de Vós, carregam cruzes pesadas.”",
