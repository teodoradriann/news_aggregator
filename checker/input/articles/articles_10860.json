    "text": "In the ever-evolving landscape of healthcare,\nMedical Assistant Training play a crucial role in ensuring smooth operations within medical facilities. From administrative tasks to patient care, these professionals are the backbone of any medical practice. However, stepping into this role requires specialized training to excel in the field.\nUnderstanding Medical Assistant Training\nMedical assistant training programs are designed to equip individuals with the knowledge and skills necessary to thrive in this demanding profession. These programs typically cover a wide range of subjects including medical terminology, anatomy, physiology, medical office procedures, patient care techniques, and basic pharmacology. Additionally, students may also receive training in medical billing and coding, electronic health records management, and laboratory procedures.\nChoosing the Right Program\nWith a multitude of options available, choosing the right training program can seem overwhelming. Prospective students should consider factors such as accreditation, program length, curriculum, clinical experience opportunities, and job placement assistance. Accreditation from reputable organizations ensures that the program meets certain standards of quality and excellence. Additionally, hands-on clinical experience is invaluable for gaining practical skills and building confidence in a real-world healthcare setting.\nOnline vs. On-Campus Training\nIn recent years, online medical assistant training programs have gained popularity due to their flexibility and convenience. These programs allow students to complete coursework at their own pace and from the comfort of their own homes. However, it's important to ensure that online programs are accredited and offer sufficient opportunities for hands-on training through clinical placements or externships. On the other hand, traditional on-campus programs provide face-to-face instruction and hands-on training in a classroom setting, which may be preferred by some students.\nCertification and Licensure\nWhile certification is not always required to work as a medical assistant, obtaining certification can enhance job prospects and demonstrate competence in the field. The most recognized certifications for medical assistants include the Certified Medical Assistant (CMA) credential offered by the American Association of Medical Assistants (AAMA) and the Registered Medical Assistant (RMA) credential offered by American Medical Technologists (AMT). Additionally, some states may require licensure or registration to practice as a medical assistant, so it's important to research the requirements in your state.\nCareer Opportunities\nMedical assistants are in high demand across various healthcare settings including physician's offices, hospitals, clinics, and long-term care facilities. Beyond entry-level positions, experienced medical assistants may advance to roles such as medical office manager, clinical coordinator, or specialty medical assistant in fields such as podiatry, optometry, or dermatology. Furthermore, the skills and knowledge gained through medical assistant training provide a solid foundation for further education and career advancement in healthcare.\nFor more info:-\nMedical Assistant School\nMedical Assisting",

    "text": "PHILADELPHIA (KYW Newsradio) — The drought is over. After 715 days without seeing significant snowfall, the Philadelphia region got several inches overnight. So far, 3.3 inches of snow has been measured by Philadelphia International Airport. Bethel Township in Delaware County is leading the snow total with 4 inches. Norristown, Montgomery County is right behind it with 3.9 inches. About 2.5 inches fell overnight in King of Prussia. Some snow, sleet and freezing rain are expected in the midday hours but with little additional accumulation. However, slippery conditions may lead to travel disruptions. A winter weather advisory remains in effect until 1 p.m. Temperatures will drop to the teens overnight, creating icy conditions. Looking ahead, the forecast calls for more snow on Friday. CLICK HERE FOR SCHOOLS CLOSING AND DELAYS AAA Mid-Atlantic is urging drivers to keep a snow emergency kit in their cars — and if they already have one, make sure it’s stocked. “People get out of practice, especially during that first snow of the season,” said AAA Mid-Atlantic spokesperson Jana Tidwell. She said drivers should keep a shovel and extra road traction material on hand, like a bag of sand or kitty litter, which can be used to free a vehicle if it gets stuck. If you are stranded and waiting for help to arrive, it’s useful to have things like flashlights, blankets, sweatshirts, gloves, nonperishable food, and drinking water. If possible, drivers should stay off the roads during a winter storm altogether. Tidwell said AAA experiences an increase in calls for roadside assistance during these weather events. Priority is given to those stranded in the most dangerous conditions. If you must hit the road, slow down and allow plenty of room between you and the vehicles around you. “If you have to brake, please don’t slam on your brakes,” Tidwell advised. “Brake gradually. Having room between the cars around you will give you the room to do that. Be very careful on- and off-ramps, as they have a tendency to freeze over before the roads do.\" “Primarily, we want to give road crews and emergency responders the room they need to do their jobs — to clear the roads, to help any stranded motorists who are out there. So if you can stay off the roads during this kind of weather event, please do so for your safety and the safety of others.”",

    "text": "From the No. 177 selection in the 2023 NFL Draft to No. 1 in the rookie record books, Puka Nacua has become an instant sensation.\nNacua, the Los Angeles Rams fifth-round pick, set a new rookie record for receiving yards during Sunday's 21-20 win over the San Francisco 49ers.\nNacua surpassed Bill Groman's 1960 rookie mark of 1,473 yards on a 6-yard catch in the third quarter. He needed 29 yards coming into Week 17 to get past Groman and did so, recording his seventh 100-plus-yard game of the season.\nIn doing so, Nacua has also passed by some of his big-name current receiving brethren: Justin Jefferson (2020, 1,400 yards) and Ja’Marr Chase (2021, 1,455).\nNot content with one rookie record on Sunday, on the very next play, Nacua hauled in his fourth reception of the game for his 105th catch of the season, surpassing Miami Dolphins wide receiver Jaylen Waddle 's 2021 mark of 104. He's just the third rookie to catch 100 or more passes -- joining Waddle and Anquan Boldin (2003).\n\"Really happy for Puka Nacua, head coach Sean McVay said after the game. \"God, was that frustrating to try to figure that out. After the first drive, thought we would be able to do that, and I thought our guys just did a great job. For him to be able to break both of those records, is such a credit to this team but also his consistency and his body of work over a 17-game season. I'm really happy for him.\"\nNacua finished his day with four catches for 41 yards and a touchdown, getting pulled for playoff preservation after he wrote his name into the record books.\nHaving filled in spectacularly at the onset of the season for an injured Cooper Kupp , Nacua has officially turned in one of the greatest rookie seasons in league history for a receiver.\nThe BYU product will now focus on the Rams' postseason return to build on his blockbuster rookie run.",

    "text": "HILLSBORO, Ore. (KATU) — A Hillsboro man was convicted on robbery charges last Thursday, according to the Washington County District Attorney's Office. Officials found Cristian Michael Abarca guilty of two counts of first-degree robbery. On Aug. 12, 2022, two brothers parked in front of a convenience store near Southeast 10th Ave and Southeast Baseline. When the driver got out to go inside Abarca approached and got into the car with a large fixed-blade knife. Abarca then threatened the brother in the passenger seat, the man was able to get out of the car. After, Abarca drove off in the car which contained the victims' paycheck and a phone. These items were recovered when the brothers spotted their car abandoned nearby, police say. At the time no one knew who the robber was. On Sept. 22, 2022, Abarca approached a man getting off the bus carrying groceries on a bus near the same convenience store where the first incident first occurred. According to officials, Abarca pulled a large, fixed-blade knife out of his sock and threatened to stab the victim if he didn’t hand over his phone and wallet. Police say the victim gave the defendant his wallet and all the groceries he had just purchased. Police say Abarca left the area on foot while the victim ran to the Hillsboro police station and reported the robbery. Police immediately searched the area. They quickly found and arrested the suspect. According to Hillsboro police, he had the victim's wallet along with two fixed-blade knives. Investigators later linked DNA evidence found on the steering wheel from the stolen car incident to the defendant and determined he had committed both robberies. While in detention at the Washington County Jail, the defendant assaulted two inmates in separate, unprovoked incidents. These actions, together with other factors include the defendant’s prior failure on domestic violence probation. Abarca was sentenced to 150 months in prison. Abarca will be transferred to the Oregon Department of Corrections to begin serving his sentence.",

    "text": "Todos sabían que ocurriría. La oposición al Presidente Milei se empeñó en declararlo y denunciarlo desde el primer día, y el gobierno y sus aliados de la derecha conservadora lo relativizaban y ocultaban. Las consecuencias sociales del “plan de ajuste más grande de la historia” son catastróficas para la vida de la gran mayoría del pueblo y para la Nación como comunidad político-cultural.\nNo debiera sorprender, ya que la aplicación de estas ideas propias de la “moderna” derecha thatcheriana, siempre generó similares resultados. Cierto es que desde el primer discurso presidencial, de espaldas al Congreso, al que luego denigraría calificándolo de “nido de ratas”, explicitó que se aplicaría un programa extremo de destrucción del Estado, reduciendo o eliminando sus funciones sociales, educativas, de fomento a la industria nacional, ajuste de los salarios públicos y privados, incluyendo un severo recorte a las jubilaciones.\nEl argumento principal no tenía ninguna originalidad, reiteraba la idea macrista de la “herencia recibida”, ahora mutada “al desastre kirchnerista”, con el agregado de que la decadencia venía desde un siglo atrás, a partir del primer gobierno surgido de la ley del sufragio secreto, universal y obligatorio (con la exclusión de la mujer).\nLa ultraderecha mileista, seguida por la otra vertiente del PRO, se proponía refundar la Nación, instaurando un proyecto político, económico y cultural de subordinación a EEUU, la gran potencia capitalista de la época; asumiendo la línea ultraísta inspirada en la marginal escuela austríaca, aggiornada a conceptos políticos y económicos neocoloniales, junto a un componente de irracionalismo cultural y científico.\nSus hitos principales e inmediatos fueron el DNU 70/23, que restringió al funcionamiento democrático, y la súper devaluación del 118%, reclamada por el antiquísimo partido devaluador con su inevitable impacto en los precios.\nDecíamos que era esperable una caída de los indicadores sociales; sin embargo, la radicalidad deliberada de la actual fase del proyecto de las corporaciones empresarias y sus partidos políticos subordinados, fueron generando un impacto destructivo en el tejido social, con consecuencias dramáticas para la vida ciudadana.\nSegún la EPH (encuesta permanente de hogares) del Indec, la pobreza creció violentamente, alcanzando al 54,8% de las personas, de ese total el 20,3% están en situación de indigencia, o sea que pasan hambre. Si los símbolos porcentuales los expresamos en seres humanos, veremos que equivalen a 25,5 millones de personas, de las cuales 9 millones carecen de ingresos para adquirir alimentos básicos, se evidencia la violencia de la destrucción del trabajo y los ingresos de millones de personas: los nuevos pobres alcanzan los 4,7 millones. Pero hay más: sobre 11 millones de menores de 14 años, 7,7 millones viven en hogares pobres, de los cuales 3.300.000 pasan hambre.\nEstos datos arrasadores incluyen a la “rica ciudad capital” donde la pobreza alcanzó, en el primer trimestre, a 1.083.000 personas y la indigencia a 472.000 de seres humanos.\nEn suma, la pobreza y el hambre son el fruto más amargo del proyecto de la ultraderecha, pero los guarismos muestran el poder destructivo del modelo, que arrastra también a la industria a una caída vertical, con sus graves consecuencias para la vida y el trabajo, muy particularmente para las pequeñas empresas, responsables de la mayor generación de trabajo y riqueza. En esta cuestión crucial del empleo, en los primeros 6 meses de Milei se redujo en 612.000 el número de trabajadores aportantes a los regímenes de seguridad social como consecuencia de las cesantías, o pase a la informalidad.\nEn sólo 7 meses de gobierno libertario-PRO y aledaños que votan “gobernabilidad”, la amenaza de la pérdida de trabajo se va transformando en realidad para cientos de miles de ciudadanos/as.\nPero las corporaciones empresarias van por más desde la convicción de que es el momento político oportuno para avanzar sobre los derechos de los trabajadores. Desde el fondo de los tiempos reclaman y exigen “modernizar la legislación laboral”, así editorializaba La Nación allá por el 26/04/16.\nLo interesante de traer al presente esa nota doctrinaria es la constatación del clásico argumento: “la legislación actual genera aumento del costo laboral y mayor riesgo empresario”, critica a las paritarias y al sindicato único por actividad y demanda descentralizar las negociaciones y llevarlas a nivel de empresas.\nCorona su postura “doctrinaria” criticando al dictador Onganía por su concesión de las obras sociales a los sindicatos y se ataja de posibles modificaciones de la “legislación del trabajo logrados por el incansable diputado Héctor Recalde”. Como vemos, la acción del lobista F. de Rioja, la UIA, AEA, la CAC, y sus legisladores pro-empresa no aportan nada novedoso. “El incansable Recalde” sigue con lo suyo incansablemente y los empresarios siempre van por más riqueza con Lavoisier como estandarte: nada se pierde, todo se “les” transfiere.\nLos retos del presente de los sectores populares y progresistas son enormes, y demandan de grandeza y audacia intelectual para crear nuevas respuestas ante estos desafíos, distintos a las experiencias anteriores. Resulta vital y urgente, no solo avanzar en la construcción de un polo político amplísimo y unitario, sino también, elaborar y presentar a la sociedad un cuerpo de ideas y un programa básico que enfrente la emergencia del drama social, educativo, industrial, cultural y de destrucción de nuestra soberanía como Nación.\nSe trata de recuperar los valores humanistas y solidarios, enfrentando la cultura de lo individual como proyecto de vida y de la sociedad. Los sectores medios, muchos de los cuales también sufren las consecuencias de esta política, y otros núcleos que logran sostener sus niveles de vida, deben afirmarse en un ideario fraternal y comprensivo hacia los millones de humildes, particularmente castigados por el mileismo y las otras expresiones conservadoras. La derecha se propone, como siempre, arrastrar a las clases medias al lugar político de lo antipopular, del antiperonismo y antizquierdismo cerril, ahora con el agregado del odio.\nEl pueblo argentino superará esta instancia histórica, sobre la base de recuperar y potenciar lo mejor de nuestros valores democráticos y humanistas, provenientes de los diversos afluentes políticos y culturales.\n*Secretario general del Partido Solidario.

    "title": "Mayor Deegan: Jacksonville 'avoided the worst' from Hurricane Milton",
    "text": "JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — Jacksonville Mayor Donna Deegan said the city was \"extraordinarily fortunate\" Thursday after Hurricane Milton left behind minimal impacts to the area, and avoided significant implications from two major hurricanes in mere weeks. \"I am just absolutely beyond grateful that we continue to be so blessed in this city, that we have yet again avoided the worst of one of these monster storms,\" Deegan said in the final press conference on Milton Thursday afternoon. The city remained under a Tropical Storm Warning and Tropical Storm Surge Warning at the time of the noon conference. The hurricane and flood watches were dropped and the local state of emergency will end Friday at 5 p.m. However, Deegan said there is still a concern about road flooding and closures from afternoon high tides and King tides. \"San Marco, Riverside, South Hampton, you need to stay alert if you are in one of the typical flood zones,\" she said. Officials anticipate Ken Knight Drive to see flooding Thursday afternoon into the evening, and urged residents in the area to seek alternative shelter. \"Street flooding, as I said, will continue Friday afternoon and into next week during high tides, as water from Central Florida moves up the river,\" Deegan said, and asked drivers not to go into flood waters. City response, storm impacts and closures Deegan hailed emergency responders for their efforts during and after Milton. The city had 435 customers reporting power outages as of 11 a.m. Thursday. The peak outages were reported around 3 a.m. with more than 13,000 customers without power. JEA restored power to 39, 000 customers in total throughout the storm. \"That's amazing,\" Deegan said. The outages were nowhere near what residents felt during and after Hurricane Helene which knocked out power to hundreds of thousands. In terms of calls for service, the Jacksonville Fire and Rescue Department responded to 30 weather-related calls, and the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office responded to 384. Tree crews were responding to 17 open tickets after Milton. For Helene, crews responded to 293 tickets. \"All these numbers are way down from Helene,\" Deegan noted. The city's six shelters housed 777 people at the storm's peak, with 724 people in general population and 53 people with special medical needs. As of 11 a.m. Thursday, 534 people remained in shelters. Deegan said a number of those staying in shelters came from areas hard-hit by the storm. The shelters will remain open until 8 a.m. Friday and will begin closing by noon. Anyone with a car inside the city-owned garage can keep them there for free through Friday, Deegan said. Non-essential city employees will return to work Monday. Duval County Public Schools will reopen Monday for a scheduled teacher planning day, and students will return to school Tuesday. The City of Neptune Beach offices will remain closed Friday, the Jacksonville Beach and Atlantic Beach offices will reopen. Deegan said there was \"good feedback\" on the Tiger Dams that were put in place on the beaches to deter storm surges and flooding. However, she said there were reports of people standing on dunes, which can implicate the recent beach renourishment. \"It is extraordinarily important that you stay off those dunes,\" Deegan said. Waste pickup Trash and recycling pickup scheduled for Thursday will be rescheduled for Saturday. The city anticipates Friday collection will remain on schedule. Yard waste and debris collection will resume in an \"ongoing manner\" Friday until all debris is removed. Residents are asked not to put out more debris, and to continue following the five cubic yard limit. \"I know everybody wants the debris picked up as soon as possible, and we are doing our very best to make sure that we can do that,\" Deegan said, noting it could take two to three cycles for everything to be removed.",

    "text": "Across the country, colleges have faced increasing pressure in recent years to end diversity, equity, and inclusion programs on their campuses. Since President Donald Trump returned to office with a campaign promise to end such efforts, colleges in North Carolina and elsewhere have scrubbed the three politically charged words—and a growing list of others deemed related—from websites, job titles, and research proposals.\nIn this project, The Assembly and five student newspapers— The Daily Tar Heel of UNC-Chapel Hill, The Chronicle of Duke University, the Niner Times of UNC Charlotte, the Old Gold & Black of Wake Forest University, and The Seahawk of UNC Wilmington—explore how public and private colleges in North Carolina have responded to the rapidly changing landscape.\nOur reporting reveals that schools across the state are struggling to find the balance between complying with federal directives, contending with state-level demands, and meeting the needs of diverse student bodies and workforces. Featured stories from our student newspaper partners go deeper on how changes to DEI-related programs have impacted students and their college experiences in North Carolina.\nAssembly Feature In North Carolina, It’s Do or DEI Federal and state officials have declared war on DEI at North Carolina’s colleges and universities. But what their orders mean is sometimes far from clear.\nby The Assembly and Partners Student Reporting",
