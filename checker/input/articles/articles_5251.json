    "text": "Pioli su Leao: \"Continuo a pensare che possa diventare un giocatore da Pallone d'Oro\"\nLunghissima intervista per Stefano Pioli, oggi tecnico dell'Al Nassr, che torna a parlare ai microfoni di Radio TV Serie A. Tra i tanti temi toccati, c'è anche un pensiero su Theo Hernandez e Leao: \"Hanno di speciale che sono due ragazzi con i quali siamo cresciuti insieme, due ragazzi ai quali ho voluto un bene dell'anima e due ragazzi che secondo me avevano bisogno di certi tipi di rapporti ma al contempo due ragazzi che sono solari, belli, difficili perché non così continui, a volte un po' indolenti. Io con loro ho avuto un bellissimo rapporto, poi a volte mi facevano arrabbiare, perché sono due giocatori che potevano condizionare il risultato della partita sia in positivo che in negativo. Quando li ho conosciuti io erano molto giovani, soprattutto Rafa.\nTheo forse era il secondo anno che giocava con continuità, perché era andato dal Real Madrid in prestito ancora in Spagna. E quindi, secondo me, soprattutto arrivando in un campionato così complicato, in un ambiente così dove c'è così tanta pressione, tanta aspettativa, hanno bisogno di essere aiutati, spronati, stimolati. Perché poi aiutarli non vuol dire coccolarli sempre, a volte sì ma a volte vuol dire dargli bastone e carota in ufficio e altre volte davanti a tutti. Insomma è stato un bel lavoro e credo che abbiamo ottenuto successi importanti. Io mi sento il padre calcistico di tutti i giocatori che ho avuto, perché per me e per lo staff il primo obiettivo è sempre stato a fine anno quanti giocatori siamo riusciti a far crescere, secondo chiaramente i nostri principi calcistici ma anche morali. Questo è sempre stato il primo obiettivo. Poi è chiaro che di pari passo va il rispetto delle aspettative del club e quindi di ottenere risultati, ma da allenatore se tu mi chiedi qual è la mia priorità è migliorare il giocatore che ho a disposizione. E per migliorare il giocatore che ho a disposizione non è sufficiente solamente tutto quello che riguarda il campo, ci vuole anche altro secondo me\".\nAncora su Leao. \"Rafa è un ragazzo stupendo. Ha di brutto (per modo di dire), il suo body language che inganna, ma Rafa è un ragazzo molto intelligente, molto sensibile, molto buono d'animo e che va un po' spronato, stimolato, aiutato. Quello che vedo è che a volte le critiche e gli elogi nel calcio sono sempre eccessivi. Io personalmente continuo a vedere una crescita continua di Rafa. Poi non so se riuscirà a diventare un top e a poter vincere un giorno un pallone d'oro. Io l'ho sempre sostenuto, l'ho sempre detto, continuo a pensare che lui possa diventare un giocatore da pallone d'oro, che la sua crescita sia continua ma dentro la crescita si possono avere a volte dei bassi, ma sarà sempre comunque un giocatore così perché certe caratteristiche rimangono, sempre crescendo e migliorando\".",
