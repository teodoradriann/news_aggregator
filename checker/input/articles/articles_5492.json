    "title": "'Lord Shiva Doesn't Need Our Protection': Delhi HC On Plea Against Demolition Of Unauthorised Temple",
    "text": "The high court said Lord Shiva would be happier if the Yamuna river bed and flood plains are cleared of all encroachments and unauthorised construction. (PTI photo) Lord Shiva does not need anyone’s protection, the Delhi High Court observed on Wednesday while refusing to make the deity a party to a petition relating to removal of a temple constructed in an unauthorised way on the Yamuna river bed. The high court said Lord Shiva would be happier if the Yamuna river bed and flood plains are cleared of all encroachments and unauthorised construction. The court made the observations while refusing to set aside an order for demolition of the Pracheen Shiv Mandir situated at Geeta Colony close to the flood plains. “The half-hearted plea by the counsel for the petitioner that Lord Shiva, being the deity of the temple, must be also impleaded in the present matter is a desperate attempt to give an altogether different colour to the entire dispute to subserve the vested interest of its members,” Justice Dharmesh Sharma said. The high court further said, “It goes without saying that Lord Shiva does not need our protection; rather, we, the people, seek his protection and blessings. There could be no iota of doubt that Lord Shiva would be happier if the Yamuna river bed and the flood plains areas are cleared of all encroachments and unauthorised construction”. The petitioner claimed that the temple acts as a hub of spiritual activities, drawing around 300 to 400 devotees regularly. The plea claimed the petitioner society was registered in 2018 with the aim of upholding transparency, accountability and responsible management of the temple’s assets. The court said the land in dispute is meant for larger public interest and the petitioner society cannot claim any vested rights to continue to occupy and use it. It said the land falls under Zonal Development Plan for Zone-‘O’ as approved by the Ministry of Urban Development. The Master Plan Delhi, 2021, also envisages rejuvenation of the Yamuna through a number of measures including ensuring adequate flow of river by releasing water by riparian states, refurbishing trunk sewers, treating the drains, sewering unsewered areas, treating industrial effluent, recycling of treated effluent and removal of coliforms at Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) besides creating ecological balance by planting trees, it noted. The court said the petitioner society has miserably failed to show any documents with regard to its title, right or interest over the land and there is no proof of the temple having any historical significance. “Mere fact that prayers are offered at the temple every day and for that matter there are special events on certain festive occasions does not convert the temple in question to a place of public significance,” it said. It granted the society 15 days to remove the idols and other religious objects in the temple and shift them to some other shrine. If they fail to do so, the Delhi Development Authority is directed to ensure that the idols are placed in some other temple, the court said. “DDA shall be at liberty to carry out demolition of the unauthorised construction and the petitioner society and its members shall not cause any impediment or obstacles in such a demolition process. The local police and the administration shall render full assistance in the said process in order to maintain law and order,” the court said.

    "text": "Padraic Ward discusses the innovation-environment in Europe.\nInnovation drives the pharma industry forward. Padraic Ward, head of pharma international at Roche, spoke about the issues Europe is facing with promoting pharma innovation at the Financial Times’ 2024 Global Pharma and Biotech Summit. During the conversation, which was hosted by the Financial Times’ global pharmaceutical correspondent Ian Johnston, Ward explained how he’s the seen the innovation-friendly environment change in recent years.\n“I was here (at a summit) two years ago and I talked then about the fact that I was really worried about the hollowing out of Europe as a pillar of research and development in healthcare,” he said. “In the two years since, the storm clouds have definitely not gone away. There is at least a silver lining at the moment. There's two ways we can look at this: there's the data which are pretty clear. It says in 2010, Europe represented 40% share of worldwide R&D in healthcare. By 2020, it was down to 30% and on the road to 25% by 2030. That might not seem like a big change, but it's actually really meaningful and important.”\nHe continued, “The second way to look at is this: over the past couple of years, I've been traveling around, and I've been in Asia, Canada, South America, and around Europe, and the pace of innovation that I see it's just accelerating all the time in those parts of the world. That's the wake-up call really. It's important that we take stock of where we are and actually begin to act. Two years have gone past.”\nJohnston asked if Ward believed that the problem throughout the entire industry and which members of the industry needed to wake up to these concerns.\n“I talked about a silver lining” Ward answered. “A report was published a couple of months ago and while it doesn’t tell us anything that we didn’t already know, it puts it out there in a very clear and concise way that is telling us exactly what needs to be done.”\nHe continued, “It's telling all of this is to the audience that may not have been following it. The dragging competitiveness report really looked sector by sector at different industries and how Europe is falling behind, pharmaceutical being one of the examples. It's interesting because when we look at the pharmaceutical sector, it is perhaps one of the markets in which Europe is globally competitive, due to companies like Roche, Novo Nordisk, and Seneca (although not part of the European Union).”\nJohnston followed up by asking if it’s possible that the pharma industry was simply punching above its weight compared to other its performance in other regions.\nWard responded, “The pharmaceutical part of it is really important, along with diagnostics, surveillance, and sustainability of healthcare systems. It's all important, and we're going to take it all together and figure out how to make it all more sustainable and stronger than it already is.”\n[Vaccines After COVID: Biopharma's Renewed Public Health and Commercial Push](/view/vaccines-after-covid-biopharma-renewed-public-health-commercial-push?utm_source=www.pharmexec.com&utm_medium=relatedContent)\nAt the Financial Times’ Global Pharma and Biotech Summit 2024, a panel discussed the potential of mRNA technology in developing cancer vaccines amid distrust from the public.",

    "title": "Il coraggio di amare - L'Osservatore Romano",
    "text": "«Ci vuole coraggio per amare». Papa Francesco ha ricordato questa verità nel discorso del 21 dicembre scorso alla Curia Romana. All'interno del suo ragionamento ha affermato il criterio per distinguere i cristiani, «non tra progressisti e conservatori, ma tra innamorati e abituati». E con queste due affermazioni ha ricordato i due grandi nemici dell'amore: la paura e l’abitudine. Non è infatti l’odio l’opposto dell'amore quanto invece la paura e quel subdolo surrogato che è l’abitudine. È un’esperienza che si fa quotidianamente: quando nasce nel cuore di un uomo l’amore verso qualcosa o qualcuno ecco che emerge subito anche la paura, paura dell’incertezza (cioè della libertà) che l’amore porta con sé, della perdita, delle ferite che possono scaturire da quell’amore. Come dice lo scrittore C.S. Lewis «Non esiste investimento sicuro: amare significa, in ogni caso, essere vulnerabili». E come esempio di questo investimento non sicuro cita la parabola dei talenti, alcuni rischiano e “vivono” cioè generano, ma c’è chi sceglie di “morire”, seppellendo il talento. Qui spunta l’altro grande tema collegato con la paura: la sicurezza. Che spiega perché l’abitudine è il surrogato della paura: l’abitudine infatti conferma, rassicura l’animo umano, mentre la novità, ciò che spezza le abitudini finisce per agitare il cuore dell’uomo che sempre deve fare i conti con la paura, lo smarrimento. Il cuore dell’uomo, ha ricordato il Papa nell’Urbi et Orbi di Natale, «è instabile e ferito» e se «si trova strumenti di morte tra le mani, prima o poi li userà». Le armi, come il denaro, alimentano il miraggio della forza e del potere e così offrono sicurezza a questo cuore impaurito. Ma la sicurezza è un falso amico che non può appagare la sete d'infinito nascosta nel cuore dell’uomo, quel cuore che è sì impaurito ma perché ha scoperto un desiderio infinito di amare e di essere amato. Non è un caso che si può parlare di “sesso sicuro” ma non di “amore sicuro”, sarebbe un ossimoro, un controsenso. E l’uomo è fatto per amare, senza riserve, senza protezione e senza misura, accogliendone il rischio; per amare: quella cosa per cui bisogna avere coraggio. * * * Sul paradosso della sicurezza ha riflettuto in modo efficace Alessandro Gisotti nell'editoriale del 28 dicembre sottolineando quel circolo vizioso per cui «ci si arma per sentirsi più sicuri e come risultato il mondo è sempre più insicuro». È la “paura liquida” di cui parlava nel 2006 il sociologo Zygmunt Bauman che sottolineava come invece «siamo “oggettivamente” le persone più al sicuro nella storia dell’umanità. Come le statistiche dimostrano, i pericoli che minacciano di abbreviare la nostra vita sono più scarsi e lontani di quanto generalmente non lo fossero nel passato o non lo siano in altre parti del pianeta» e due anni dopo il padre domenicano Timothy Radcliffe facendolgi eco osservava che: «Sotto molti aspetti, viviamo in un mondo molto più sicuro dei nostri antenati. Almeno in Occidente, siamo più protetti da malattie, violenza e povertà. E tuttavia abbiamo paura. Siamo ansiosi riguardo a pericoli che abbiamo creato noi: disastro ecologico, bse , energia nucleare, piante geneticamente modificate. Sono stato in Paesi in Africa dove le persone sopportano pericoli terribili ogni giorno con calma e fiducia, mentre in Occidente il più vago accenno di rischio produce il panico». Conclude padre Giovanni Cucci nel 2012 su «La civiltà cattolica» che «le attuali società occidentali presentano a questo riguardo uno strano paradosso. Da un lato vi si nota una situazione di benessere senza precedenti, che consente di risolvere con facilità la maggior parte dei problemi legati alla sopravvivenza, offrendo a un sempre maggior numero di persone possibilità di istruzione e di cura. D’altra parte questa aumentata sicurezza presenta un costo molto alto: la proliferazione della paura. Per uno strano meccanismo psicologico, la ricerca eccessiva di sicurezza non elimina la paura, ma porta piuttosto a incentivarla». Come si esce da questo circolo vizioso, dal pozzo senza fondo della richiesta di sicurezza? Il Papa sempre nel discorso alla Curia ci ricorda che dai labirinti si esce dal “di sopra”, “guardando in alto”. È un compito questo per tutti e in particolare per chi ha grandi responsabilità. Nel 1961 il presidente statunitense Dwight Eisenhower, lo ricorda Gisotti nell’articolo citato, «metteva in guardia dal “complesso militare-industriale” e dalla sua indebita ingerenza nelle scelte della politica americana in senso militarista». Sette anni dopo Robert Kennedy tenne il famoso discorso sul Pil all'università del Kansas, invitando ad una vera “conversione”, cambio di prospettiva, abbandonando il paradigma efficentista e puramente economico: «Non troveremo mai un fine per la nazione né una nostra personale soddisfazione nel mero perseguimento del benessere economico, nell’ammassare senza fine beni terreni. […] Il Pil comprende anche l’inquinamento dell’aria e la pubblicità delle sigarette... […] mette nel conto le serrature speciali per le nostre porte di casa […] Cresce con la produzione di napalm, missili e testate nucleari», tutto questo in piena guerra del Viet-Nam, e concludeva parlando della gioia, quella forza che non può essere misurata dentro un Pil che «non comprende la bellezza della nostra poesia o la solidità dei valori familiari, l’intelligenza del nostro dibattere o l’onestà dei nostri pubblici dipendenti […] né la nostra compassione né la devozione al nostro paese. Misura tutto, in breve, eccetto ciò che rende la vita veramente degna di essere vissuta. Può dirci tutto sull’America, ma non se possiamo essere orgogliosi di essere americani». L'essere umano è fatto per la vita e la vita non sta dentro nessun tipo di “misura”. L’essere umano desidera la vita in pienezza, e solo l'amore lo fa accedere a questa pienezza che è appunto “dis-misura”. * * * Colpisce, è l’ultimo punto di questa lunga riflessione che arriva a conclusione di un anno particolarmente drammatico, il riferimento di Bob Kennedy alla «onestà dei nostri pubblici dipendenti», un’altra cosa “incalcolabile”, si potrebbe aggiungere: di una preziosità incalcolabile. Il lavoro quotidiano, nascosto, delle persone del popolo che al lavoro come in famiglia, fanno semplicemente e pazientemente il loro dovere, fa parte senza dubbio di quella “corrente” di cui parla Edith Stein, quella «corrente vivificante della vita mistica» che spesso rimane invisibile; «sicuramente» aggiunge, «gli avvenimenti decisivi della storia del mondo sono stati essenzialmente influenzati da anime sulle quali nulla viene detto nei libri di storia». Il 27 marzo 2020, durante la Statio Orbis in piazza San Pietro, Francesco ci ha ricordato come abbiamo potuto sperimentare, proprio in questi tempi drammatici, che «le nostre vite sono tessute e sostenute da persone comuni — solitamente dimenticate — che non compaiono nei titoli dei giornali e delle riviste né nelle grandi passerelle dell’ultimo show ma, senza dubbio, stanno scrivendo oggi gli avvenimenti decisivi della nostra storia: medici, infermiere e infermieri, addetti dei supermercati, addetti alle pulizie, badanti […] e tanti ma tanti altri che hanno compreso che nessuno si salva da solo. […] Quanta gente esercita ogni giorno pazienza e infonde speranza, avendo cura di non seminare panico ma corresponsabilità. Quanti padri, madri, nonni e nonne, insegnanti, mostrano ai nostri bambini, con gesti piccoli e quotidiani, come affrontare e attraversare una crisi riadattando abitudini, alzando gli sguardi e stimolando la preghiera. Quante persone pregano, offrono e intercedono per il bene di tutti». Ancora una volta l'invito ad alzare lo sguardo: dal “basso” della storia queste persone, guardando in alto, spingono quella storia e la grande Storia del mondo in avanti, facendola uscire dai labirinti spesso mortali in cui a volte gli uomini, dal cuore instabile e ferito, si vengono a trovare. Sono per lo più persone semplici, invisibili, ma che vedono gli altri, le loro esigenze, e se ne prendono cura. Tra queste persone ci sono anche quei cristiani “migliori” di cui parlava il teologo gesuita De Lubac nella sua Meditazione sulla Chiesa: «I cristiani migliori, più vivaci non si trovano necessariamente e neppure generalmente tra i sapienti, o tra gli abili maneggiatori, tra gli intellettuali o tra i politici, tra le “autorità sociali”. Per conseguenza la loro voce non risuona nella stampa, e i loro atti non interessano il pubblico. La loro vita è nascosta agli occhi del mondo, sicché solo tardi ed eccezionalmente alcuni giungono a qualche notorietà, e sempre con il rischio di strane deformazioni. All’interno stesso della Chiesa, sarà per lo più soltanto dopo la morte che qualcuno acquisterà un prestigio incontestato. Eppure sono proprio loro che contribuiscono, più di tutti gli altri, ad impedire che la nostra terra sia un inferno. I più non si domandano se la loro fede sia adeguata, né se essa sia efficace. Si contentano di viverla, come la realtà più vera e sempre attuale, e i frutti che ne derivano, anch’essi spesso nascosti, non sono per questo meno meravigliosi. Anche se non si sono direttamente impegnati in un’attività esterna, essi sono all’origine di tutte le iniziative, di tutte le attività, di tutte le istituzioni che non sono condannate alla sterilità. E sono loro che conservano in noi, che ci ridonano, qualche speranza». La speranza cristiana è quella che spinge un cattolico come J.R.R.Tolkien a scrivere nel pieno della seconda guerra mondiale, queste parole al figlio Christopher impegnato a combattere al fronte: «...ciò che è veramente importante è sempre nascosto ai contemporanei, e i semi di ciò che deve essere germogliano tranquillamente nel buio in qualche angolo dimenticato, mentre tutti guardano Stalin o Hitler. Nessun uomo può sapere ciò che sta accadendo realmente sub specie aeternitatis. Tutto ciò che sappiamo, e in gran parte per esperienza diretta, è che il male lavora con grande potenza e continuo successo — ma invano: prepara sempre e solo il terreno per il germogliare di un bene inaspettato. Così è in generale, e così è nella nostra vita». Questa speranza cristiana, tenace e paradossale, ha qualcosa da dire a tutti gli uomini che vivono quel contrasto tra desiderio di amare e di essere amati e la spinta opposta, paralizzante, della paura. Inquietante compagna di strada che si camuffa con molte maschere ma che poi rivela infine di quale paura si tratta. Lo esprime bene, come sanno fare i poeti, Raymond Carver in una poesia intitolata appunto Paura in cui, in forma di catalogo, elenca 25 “oggetti” di questo sentimento insaziabile, dalla «Paura di addormentarsi la notte» alla «Paura di non addormentarsi», dalla «Paura del ritorno del passato» alla «Paura del presente che fugge», dalla «Paura dell'ansia» alla «Paura della confusione» per poi arrivare al finale: «Paura di non amare o di non amare abbastanza/ Paura che quel che amo risulterà letale per quelli che amo / Paura della morte / Paura di vivere troppo/ Paura della morte. / L'ho già detta». Alla paura della morte, madre di tutte le altre, il Vangelo di Gesù ha dato una risposta, il bambino che nasce a Betlemme, soffre l’angoscia nell'Orto degli Ulivi e offre la vita sul Golgota per poi risorgere come Primogenito dei risorti, è la risposta, è quella luce nel buio che dona all'uomo il bene più necessario: il coraggio per amare. di Andrea Monda",

    "text": "Thousands of workers took part in a general strike in Italy on Friday. It forced the Italian national airline company to cancel dozens of domestic and international flights and closed schools, hospitals and local transport systems. Thousands of teachers, healthcare workers, rubbish collectors and others walked off their jobs across Italy. They took to the streets to protest against a cost of living crisis, low salaries and cuts in public services. Italian unions called the eight-hour strike and mobilised marches in cities across the country. The strike was ignited by fascist prime minister Giorgia Meloni’s latest budget, which cut spending on schools, healthcare and other services. Strikers are also demanding a fairer share of profits from private companies. “These protests don’t just speak to the government,” Maurizio Landini, head of the CGIL trade union federation, told reporters in Bologna. “They speak also to entrepreneurs, managers and businesses, who in these years have made profits like never before.” Transport minister Matteo Salvini imposed an injunction limiting the strike in the transport sector to four hours. It was the first general strike since last November. Unions faced possible sanctions for involving the healthcare and justice sectors. Italy’s healthcare sector has been suffering staffing shortages, with care in the poorer south particularly lagging that in the more prosperous north. “There are many people who go abroad because the salaries are too low,” said Anna Salsa, a member of the UIL healthcare union, at the demonstration in Rome. “We are forced to do double shifts to give the minimal levels of essential care.” This strike is part of the resistance to Meloni’s government and its attempts to impose greater austerity on Italian workers.
