    "text": "SANTA CLARA, Calif. — With great promise comes potential peril. And while artificial intelligence (AI) is looked upon as a panacea for enterprises, it also poses an existential security threat.\n“We stand at the intersection of human ingenuity and technological innovation, where the game of cybersecurity has evolved into a high-stakes match,” Nir Zuk , founder and chief technology officer at Palo Alto Networks Inc., said at the company’s 2025 Cybersecurity and AI Predictions event here late Thursday.\nAs AI becomes the driving force in security operations centers (SOC), with human analysts playing a crucial but secondary role, SOCs will increasingly rely on AI-driven processes to automate tasks such as vulnerability scanning and threat detection while reserving advanced analytics and response strategies for human experts, according to the annual threat assessment.\nSecure operations are increasingly essential in the age of AI hype because more than 40% of business and technology leaders admit to lacking a full understanding of cyber-risks associated with generative AI, according to PwC’s 2024 Global Digital Trust Insights survey.\nThe rising concern over data breaches necessitates tighter control over corporate resources, Palo Alto Networks’ report cautions. Consumer web browsers are inherently insecure, with 95% of organizations reporting security incidents originating from the browser across all devices, underscoring the lack of necessary security measures to protect organizations and their employees, no matter where they work.\nThe AI arms race is a “double-edged sword” that brings a new attack surface that can expose greater sensitive information more quickly, Sam Rubin, vice president and global head of operations, Unit 42, at Palo Alto Networks, said in an interview. The good news, he added, is that AI can be used for security enhancements and as an asymmetrical defense.\nCompanies face a 2025 cybersecurity landscape, according to Palo Alto Networks, which offered several predictions. Among them:\nCybersecurity will shift toward a unified data platform. Platforms will encompass everything from code development, cloud environments and SOCs. Current fragmented systems, burdened with isolated workflows and manual processes, cannot match the speed and sophistication of modern cyberthreats.\nLarge incumbent organizations with vast data stores will take the lead in AI-driven innovation, gaining a powerful advantage over new entrants. Companies like Palo Alto Networks, which processes seven petabytes of data daily across multiple platforms and serves 85,000 customers, are positioned to dominate in a data-centric AI landscape, the company claimed. AI’s success hinges on data quality and volume, with nearly 90% of model performance relying on these elements.\nEnergy is a concern, especially in cybersecurity. A surge in AI workloads has triggered a corresponding increase in data centers worldwide, with enterprise cloud storage projected to more than double to $128 billion by 2028, according to Omdia research. This growth brings a significant rise in electricity consumption, with Big Tech’s energy demands escalating. In response, the industry will need to adopt energy-conscious strategies that include platformization, energy-efficient AI models, and quantum-based AI models, said Palo Alto Networks.",

[Sign up for NBC South Florida newsletters.] A warm front is coming our way. An area of low pressure is working across the northern Gulf of Mexico and pushing a warm front across our area on Friday. This will spread tropical air across South Florida, with the heaviest rain and best chance for thunderstorms by the second half of the day. With the low-pressure center, there is a chance for isolated tornadoes, strong wind, and flooding. Heavy rain will move in midday, but the most intense storms are expected to move in late Friday evening. A Flood Watch is in effect through Saturday for 2-4 inches of rainfall and 6+ inches locally. A Wind Advisory is also in effect until 8 p.m. Saturday with sustained winds expected at 20-25 mph with gusts up to or over 40 mph.

    "title": "Ruto allies claim Gachagua isolating Mt Kenya",
    "text": "President William Ruto’s allies in Mt Kenya have accused Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua of isolating central Kenya. The Kenya Kwanza leaders, led by Laikipia East MP Mwangi Kiunjuri claimed that [Gachagua is plotting](https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/2001501418/stop-politicking-and-push-farmers-interests-gachagua-tells-leaders?utm_cmp_rs=amp-next-page) to isolate Mt Kenya communities from the rest of the country ahead of the 2027 General Election. Speaking in Eldoret, Kiunjuri alleged that there was a scheme by the DP and a section of politicians to cause a rift in the Kenya Kwanza government to weaken the President's political influence in the region. The leaders who held a meeting with members of the Kikuyu community from the North Rift region at a hotel in Kapseret, Uasin Gishu county said they will not sit and watch as the Gachagua attempts to pit the Mt Kenya community against the rest of the country. Kiunjuri insisted that the country had been united through the broad-based government and Central should not be isolated. “Those in Kenya Kwanza should not be the ones giving the President a hard time. Even if you are a shareholder, hold your horses knowing that the shares have been divided equitably. I will write a text message to Rigathi informing him that people in the Rift Valley want peace; they do not want wrangles in the government. If a woman is married, she should be satisfied with her husband,” he said. Kiunjuri who is The Service Party leader has vowed to ensure Mt Kenya remains steadfast in the ruling Kenya Kwanza Alliance. “The in-fights in the Kenya Kwanza divide are not helpful at all. We fight while others are taking advantage of our differences. If a husband and wife are fighting, there will be no stability in their home, if a community is in constant fights, passersby will draw in, steal from them and they will know no peace,” he said. The leaders accused Gachagua of rocking the government from within instead of helping the president unite Kenyans from across the political divide. “We are going to oppose attempts by the DP to try and isolate members of the [Mt Kenya region](https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/business/politics/article/2001501136/gachagua-i-have-grown-thick-skin-to-survive-politics?utm_cmp_rs=amp-next-page) from the rest of Kenyans for his own political gain. While the country is united through the broad-based government, why should we be the ones anticipating disunity?” Posed Kiunjuri. The meeting that was hosted by UDA Nominated MP Joseph Wainaina, was attended by MPs Duncan Mathenge (Nyeri Central), John Kiarie (Dagoretti), James Githua (Kabete) and John Kiragu (Limuru). Kiunjuri said that they will pick a leader from Gema to champion their unity. He revealed that the Eldoret meeting was just one of the forums they have lined up across the country to preach peace and undo the political damage to the Mt Kenya community that has settled and is doing business in other counties. “The DP should not concentrate his politics in Mt Kenya because we have members of our community living across the 47 counties of the country. He (Gachagua) should instead focus on helping the President to deliver on his pre-election pledge to Kenyans,” said Kiunjuri. Dagoretti MP reiterated Mt Kenya leaders commitment to support President Ruto’s transformation agenda to enable all regions to enjoy the fruits of the Kenya Kwanza government. “Let us support the broad-based government lest we be locked out as a community. We have to unite with other Kenyans because we cannot isolate ourselves. We cannot act as if we are an island. We need others and we will continue supporting President Ruto because he is a great leader, he only needs time,” he said. Wainaina claimed that Gachagua was endangering his political career by championing the interests of only one region. “It hurts to see the DP championing the interests of one region yet he holds a public office where he should be helping the President to ensure every part of the country gets a share of the national cake,” he said. The nominated MP urged the Mt Kenya community to coexist peacefully with others. “In as much as we have the numbers from Mt Kenya region, our people are spread out in all counties, and in these counties, they are the minority. What happens if we isolate ourselves instead of embracing other communities?” Wainana posed.",

You’ll get no preaching about fireworks from me. I’ve probably done every bad thing you can do with fireworks, so I don’t have much room to talk. And I’m not here to lecture you about stuff you’d rather ignore. Let's just protect Texas kids.",

Aun no han sido identificadas.\nLas autoridades del municipio de Guarne, en el Oriente antioqueño, investigan el asesinato de dos hombres cuyos cuerpos fueron encontrados en la vereda Guamito, sector La Antena, una zona rural ubicada a unos 25 minutos del casco urbano. El hallazgo se produjo este martes 8 de abril, alrededor de las 3:30 p. m.\nSegún información recopilada en el lugar de los hechos, las víctimas presentaban múltiples heridas causadas por arma de fuego. Aunque aún no han sido identificadas, una de las hipótesis que manejan los investigadores es que los hombres, que se movilizaban en una motocicleta, habrían sido seguidos por otros dos sujetos en moto, quienes les dispararon minutos después de una aparente persecución.

    "text": "Arsenal denied a return to Premier League summit as they are beaten by West Ham\nThe Gunners went down 2-0 at home\nArsenal missed the chance to return to the top of the Premier League as they slipped to a disappointing defeat to West Ham amid more VAR controversy.\nThe Gunners needed victory to replace Liverpool at the summit but lost 2-0 by the Hammers on a night where David Moyes finally landed a victory at the Emirates Stadium.\nHis West Ham side lost Kurt Zouma ahead of the game and Lucas Paqueta after just over half an hour but hit the front through Tomas Soucek’s strike, awarded after VAR could not determine whether the whole ball had gone out of play in the build-up.\nA second-half header from former Arsenal defender Konstantinos Mavropanos secured the points and things could have been even better for the visitors had Said Benrahma not seen a last-gasp penalty saved by David Raya.\nMoyes had failed to secure victory in his previous 72 Premier League away games at Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool or Manchester United, so this was a long time coming for the Scot.\nArsenal laboured when they needed to continue their recent winning run in London derbies to go back to the top of the table.\nInstead, only captain Martin Odegaard could hold his head high on a night where their defence creaked and Gabriel Jesus was guilty of missing a couple of very good chances.\nArsenal started well, with some great touches in and around the West Ham box from Odegaard in particular.\nBut at the other end their defending left a lot to be desired, as Oleksandr Zinchenko and Gabriel Magalhaes failed to deal with a simple ball into the middle.\nJarrod Bowen capitalised by latching onto the miscue and teed up Soucek to finish – the goal surviving a lengthy VAR check which could not ultimately make a call on if the ball had not gone out of play before Bowen’s cutback.\nArsenal looked to respond although the goal gave West Ham something to defend, although Jesus found a way in behind with a subtle flick into Bukayo Saka, whose header was brilliantly saved by Alphonse Areola.\nPaqueta had been hurt in the warm-up and lasted just over half an hour, with his fellow Brazilian Gabriel Martinelli curling an effort just wide for Arsenal as they continued in vain to find a leveller.\nThe hosts were getting closer, West Ham gifting possession as two passes saw Arsenal in on goal once more, this time Saka hitting the base of the post from an acute angle.\nFormer West Ham captain Declan Rice fired just over from 25 yards but it was another player coming back to haunt his former club who would find the back of the net soon after.\nMavropanos made just seven league starts in three years as an Arsenal player but returned to the Premier League last summer with the Hammers and headed them two goals ahead before the hour.\nJesus then headed straight at Areola before sending another fine chance well over the bar moments after Arteta introduced Eddie Nketiah and Reiss Nelson off the bench.\nAreola was on hand again to keep out a Leandro Trossard effort, with Vladimir Coufal clearing a William Saliba header off the line from the resulting corner.\nRice had come off the bench during a 3-0 Carabao Cup defeat on his return to West Ham earlier in the season and endured another night to forget here as he conceded a late penalty for tripping Emerson Palmieri in the box – only for Raya to keep out substitute Benrahma’s tame spot-kick.",
