    "title": "Meet Andy Farrell's Biggest Fan - His Wife Colleen",
    "text": "He's carried the hopes of the nation on his shoulders through a Grand Slam Six Nations win and our most emotionally charged Rugby World Cup bid to date but the person Andy Farrell can depend on the most is his wife Colleen.\nThe couple have been teammates in life for over two decades weathering the highs and lows of parenthood, career gains and setbacks and uprooting their family for a move across the Irish sea.\nToday's top videos\nThrough it all Colleen has been the behind-the-scenes rock of support driving her other half on but just who is the blonde beauty who has captured his heart. Well, Colleen prefers to remain out of the spotlight but here's what we do know about her:\nEarly life Rugby Union's Andy Farrell is joined by his wife Colleen, son Owen and mother Carol (left) as he collects his OBE. Pic: PA Images Both Colleen and Andy grew up in Wigan in Manchester but have Irish roots that stretch back generations.\nThe Ireland coach and former England captain has indicated that their families originally hailed from Dublin previously telling the Irish Times : 'Everyone from the north-west of England is from Ireland.\n'You go from Liverpool straight across the easy Lancs to Manchester and it's full of Irish, I've got [Dublin] ancestry that goes back three or four generations, and so has my wife.'\nHow they met The low-key couple has never opened up about how they first crossed paths but it might just have been through Andy's Wigan teammate Sean O'Loughlin who also happens to be Colleen's brother.\nStarting a family\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Elleshia Farrell ✨ (@elleshiafarrell)\nThe young couple found themselves having to grow up very quickly when they became pregnant at just 16 years of age and certainly rose to the challenge.\nTheir son Owen arrived in September 1991 and has inherited his dad's incredible talent with the pair even playing together on the same team in 2008. Little wonder seeing as he grew up immersed in the sport.\nAndy's former teammate Kris Radlinksi recalled his early years of parenthood when he would bring his son to training and how the team rallied around him and Colleen.\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Elleshia Farrell ✨ (@elleshiafarrell)\n'Andrew and Colleen were young parents and that brings its different issues, but Andrew bringing Owen to work was great - he wasn't any trouble to anybody. At the end of training everyone had time for him. The players respected that Faz had Owen really young, so we were part of his support network,' he told The Telegraph .\nThey tied the knot in 1995 and went on to have two daughters Gracie and Elleshia followed by their youngest son Gabriel who by the sounds of things has a promising career on the pitch ahead of him.\nDivided loyalties President Michael D. Higgins with Andy and Colleen Farrell during the Ireland Rugby Team's Visit to Aras An Uachtarain in 2018. Pic: INPHO Andy has commended his wife and kids for the commitment they made leaving their lives behind to move to Ireland but with Owen kitting out for England family loyalties are often divided in the household.\nWhile the coach says he and his son get on with things and can even wind each other up about being on opposing sides, it's understandably not as straightforward for his wife.\n'The hardest part is certainly for Colleen. Yeah, 100 per cent. And Owen's sisters, and the young fella Gabriel, it's weird for them.\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Elleshia Farrell ✨ (@elleshiafarrell)\n'They've got unbelievably mixed emotions, I've no doubt, because they're only human but I suppose how do they try and come to terms with it? I suppose they think that, they hope that, both sides do well. And that's not going to happen, is it? So it's a difficult one for them,' he told the Irish Independent in 2020.\nColleen it seems has a great sense of humour and can also see the funny side of the situation. She previously posted a snap of Gabriel wearing two jerseys ahead of an England match and wrote: 'This ok for Twickenham? Not Gabe with two tops on' alongside a laughing emoji\nOne glam granny Ireland head coach Andy Farrell with his wife Colleen, left, grandson Freddie, son Gabriel and daughter Elleshia during the Guinness Six Nations Rugby Championship match between Ireland and England at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin. Pic: Sportsfile At 48 years of age but looking years younger Colleen might just be the most glamorous granny of all time.\nThe blonde bombshell holds her own next to the players' wives in the style stakes and is granny to Owen's two little boys whom he shares with his wife Georgie.\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Elleshia Farrell ✨ (@elleshiafarrell)\nGiving insight into the hilarious family rivalry, the England player revealed that he discovered his son had an Irish jersey and asked him why and was told because 'it's grandad's team.' In reply he told him: 'Well, you can wear a suit like grandad does then not the kit.'\nIn response, Andy said ahead of the Six Nations: 'The grandkids are coming over today as well, so we'll be trying to poach them into our captain's run tomorrow and see if we can squeeze them to cheer for Ireland. We'll see how that goes.'",

    "text": "The decomposed body found in the search for Brian Tarrence earlier this month in Turks and Caicos was identified on Wednesday as the missing Manhattan man, authorities revealed. Officials said no foul play is suspected in the death of Tarrence, who went missing on June 25 while vacationing on the Caribbean island with his wife. While searching for the 52-year-old, police discovered the “body of a deceased male in a decomposed state” in the area of Grace Bay on July 5. The Royal Turks and Caicos Islands Police Force announced Wednesday that the body was the remains of Tarrence. Police investigate ‘suspicious disappearance’ of California man linked to cryptocurrency fortune “An autopsy conducted on July 11th revealed no signs of trauma, and at this time, there is no suspicion of foul play,” the police department said in a statement. Tarrence disappeared on the third night of an anniversary getaway vacation with his wife of one year. German tourist Carolina Wilga found alive 12 days after she was lost in the Australian Outback The body was found just a short walk from the Paradise Inn in Grace Bay, where Tarrence was staying with his wife before disappearing into the night. “[The body] was found a 20-minute walk from where he was last seen,” private investigator Carl DeFazio, a former Marine and NYPD cop, told People Magazine last week. “I would say about a block off of Leeward Highway in a little residential commercial area,” DeFazio said. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR METRO DAILY NEWSLETTER Officials have not detailed the extent of the body’s decomposition, but used dental analysis to determine that the remains belonged to the 52-year-old. Local officials have not announced a cause of death, which will be determined by a full autopsy, according to police. Tarrence was seen leaving the inn on home surveillance cameras in the early morning hours of June 25 as his wife, Maria, was asleep. The couple had moved to Manhattan last year from upstate Monroe to be close to Tarrence’s stepson, who attends college in the city.

    "text": "It’s looking good for New Year’s Day on Colorado Boulevard. A forecast of a slight chance of rain earlier in the week has turned into mostly sunny skies, boding well for the Tournament of Roses’ streak of years since of 2006 with no rain.\nIn fact, it’s shaping up to be quite a nice morning for the Rose Parade, which runs from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. Monday, with the Rose Bowl Game in the afternoon.\nAccording to the National Weather Service, Monday will be mostly sunny, with a high near 64.\nRead more Rose Parade coverage here Even if there is rain, it likely won’t be much. The next in a series of storms will impact Southern California, but the core of the storm will stay off the cost on its way to norther Baja, according to the Weather Service.\n“Any area that receives rain will generally stay under 0.10 inches, with a local amount to 0.25 inches possible,” according to the National Weather Service.\nAnd it’s unlikely it cause the kind of problems other parts of the region are seeing.\nParts of Los Angeles County experienced flooding this morning as a strong one-day rainstorm hit the area, creating dangerous conditions on roads and at beaches.\nA flood advisory was in effect until 11 a.m. for a portion of southwest California, including central and southern Los Angeles County, and far eastern Ventura County, according to the National Weather Service.\nLocal law enforcement agencies reported some urban and small stream flooding in the advisory area. Some locations that were warned about possible flooding include Long Beach, Malibu, Griffith Park, Hollywood, downtown Los Angeles, Universal City, Burbank, Beverly Hills, North Hollywood, Culver City, Alhambra, Inglewood, Pasadena, Van Nuys, Venice, Santa Monica and Encino.\nThe NWS also issued a special weather statement for the areas of Santa Clarita, Newhall and San Fernando, where winds up to 50 mph were expected.\nMeanwhile, a high surf warning was in effect until 10 p.m. Saturday for all Los Angeles County beaches, including the Malibu Coast and Catalina Island.\nSo, you might pack an umbrella or poncho, just in case. But bottom line: You likely won’t need it in Pasadena. Fingers crossed.\nOrganizers don’t like to talk much about the rain, for fear of jinxing the giant annual spectacle, which from its beginnings was all about promoting the region’s sunny weather disposition and its flowers. That may be a good strategy.\nIn fact, over the course of its 134-year history, the event has had 124 sunny iterations and just 10 soggy ones. And it looks like the 135th year will follow that pattern.\nThe answer is part odds, part science, explained Daniel Swain, climate scientist at UCLA’s Institute of the Environment & Sustainability in a recent interview with the Southern California News Group.\nRelated links A powwow and float at the Rose Parade?

But, that only happens “a relative handful of times” in any given winter.\nIn L.A. County, there is approximately a 10% to 15% chance of experiencing rainfall on any given day in January, he said. In comparison, it has only rained on approximately 8% of Rose Parades, according to information provided by the Tournament of Roses.\nIt doesn’t hurt, experts say, that the parade only takes up a morning fraction of a day when rain could happen before or after.\nGet ready to smell the roses, instead of a rain-soaked pavement.\nStaff writers Clara Harter and Ryan Carter, and City News Service, contributed to this article.",

    "text": "Esto supone consecuencias negativas en las condiciones laborales de los trabajadores y en la calidad del servicio postal, según CCOO\nJuan Francisco Rivas Martín, secretario provincial de Comisiones Obreras (CCOO) en Correos, ha denunciado este jueves el desmedido ajuste de plantilla que está afectando a la empresa en diversas localidades de la provincia. Esta situación, según el sindicato, está impactando negativamente en las condiciones laborales de los trabajadores y en la calidad del servicio postal que se ofrece a la ciudadanía.\nRivas Martín ha señalado que la falta de contratación y la no cobertura de vacantes están generando un deterioro significativo en el servicio postal público, lo que se traduce en dificultades para la recepción de notificaciones, paquetes y otros envíos postales. Esta problemática se agrava en el contexto de la inminente campaña de Navidad, donde la demanda de servicios postales suele aumentar considerablemente.\nEl sindicato ha manifestado su preocupación por la gestión de la empresa, que ha arrastrado pérdidas de aproximadamente 1.200 millones de euros en los últimos años, resultado de una \"nefasta gestión\" del anterior presidente, Juan Manuel Serrano. Aunque se ha nombrado un nuevo presidente, Pedro Saura, y se ha firmado un acuerdo marco estratégico para el periodo 2024-2028, CCOO considera que las medidas adoptadas hasta ahora son insuficientes.\nRivas Martín ha subrayado que la situación actual se traduce en un ajuste severo de contratación en todas las oficinas de Correos, lo que está llevando a los trabajadores a realizar un esfuerzo considerable para mantener el servicio. \"Si Correos sigue funcionando es gracias a los trabajadores, que están haciendo mucho más de lo que deberían\", ha afirmado.\nEl sindicato ha advertido que, si la empresa y el Gobierno no rectifican su política de inacción, no descartan llevar a cabo movilizaciones, incluyendo concentraciones y huelgas. \"Queremos que se respete el derecho de todos los ciudadanos a un servicio postal de calidad\", ha enfatizado Rivas Martín.\nAdemás, CCOO ha denunciado la falta de cobertura de bajas estructurales y el deterioro del parque móvil de la empresa, que afecta la seguridad de los trabajadores. En localidades como Vitigudino, Tamames y Ciudad Rodrigo, entre otras, se han reportado carencias en la plantilla que han llevado a situaciones de colas y demoras en la atención al público.",

Built on the belief that success requires more than just funding, Elemental provides a comprehensive suite of services, resources and events to drive commercial success and social impact.\nElemental is investing up to $3 million in catalytic capital per company for the 15-20 companies it will accept into its latest cohort – its largest project investment to date. This presents a significant opportunity for high-impact climate innovators to access the necessary capital and tailored support required to achieve widespread adoption of their promising and essential climate technology. Additionally, Elemental is expanding its co-investor-network, fostering relationships with public and private funders, philanthropy and project partners to support companies as they scale.\nThe Elemental Interactive event, hosted by Emmy-nominated actor, writer, producer, and former Associate Director of the White House Office of Public Engagement, Kal Penn , featured esteemed speakers within the climate sector, including Laurene Powell Jobs , Founder of Emerson Collective, and Tom Steyer , Co-Executive Chair of Galvanize Climate Solutions. During the event, Elemental highlighted the remarkable projects of several portfolio companies. Among these were notable representatives from previous cohorts, such as Joshua Aviv of SparkCharge, Rebecca Hu from Glacier, Tim Latimer representing Fervo Energy, Megan O'Connor from Nth Cycle and Kameale C. Terry of ChargerHelp!, sharing firsthand accounts of how Elemental's support has positively impacted their businesses.\n\"As climate financing evolves, we're committed to addressing critical funding gaps and expanding opportunities for impactful projects,\" said Danya Hakeem , VP of Portfolio at Elemental Excelerator. \"Over the past five years, we've observed a growing disparity between early- and late stage funding, particularly for project deployments. To bridge this gap, Elemental is rolling out its largest capital opportunity yet, along with expanded services for project development, finance and community engagement. We are thrilled to open applications and welcome new additions to our portfolio.\"\nThe nonprofit investor is growing its suite of services to provide comprehensive support for project development and financing, offering coaching in project finance, strategic guidance on deal structures, engineering, procurement, construction and offtake advisory, as well as fractional CFO support to bolster capacity. In addition, Elemental is providing coaching in community engagement and policy, focusing on workforce development, community benefits plans and government affairs strategies.\nMatt Leducq , CEO of Forum Mobility, an Elemental portfolio company, shared, \"The partnership with Elemental not only aided significantly in funding the development of our project but the team at Elemental was instrumental in working with communities, policymakers, and stakeholders - ensuring the project does well by doing right. Since our first project, Elemental has also doubled down, investing in Forum beyond our initial project and helping us unlock other funding.\"\nFor over 14 years, Elemental has been fostering a vibrant community of entrepreneurs, having made investments in over 150 companies to date. Not only has the organization invested over $79 million in its portfolio companies, but these ventures have also collectively raised over $10 billion in follow-on funding.\nElemental Excelerator invites eligible entrepreneurs with innovative climate solutions to apply for their latest investment cycle before the application deadline on May 31st . As a partner to winning coalitions of the EPA's recently announced $20B Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF), a self-sustaining fund focused on investing in climate projects, Elemental anticipates having access to increased capital this summer to expand our community-centered climate strategy and invest in additional companies with qualified projects. If you are interested in joining the Elemental portfolio, apply now to receive preferential review for GGRF investments made this year. Further details and expanded investment opportunities will be announced in the upcoming months.\nAbout Elemental Excelerator Elemental is a nonprofit investor in climate technologies with deep community impact.
