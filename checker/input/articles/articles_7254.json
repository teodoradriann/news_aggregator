(KCTV) - Investigators are searching for a man who attempted to steal a liquor bottle before he attacked a man on a Lawrence street and bit the tip of his finger off.\nThe Lawrence, Kansas, Police Department has asked for the community’s help to identify the suspect following after multiple witnesses reported the incident.\nLaw enforcement officials said they were called to the area of 7th and Massachusetts St. around 1 a.m. on Sunday, March 29, with reports of the crime. Managers at a nearby bar reported the man walked out with a bottle of Fireball before they caught up with him outside and retrieved it.\nAs the suspect ran off, witnesses indicated that he bumped into a man walking past. As the bystander continued on, the suspect turned around and allegedly attacked him from behind before he proceeded to bite off the tip of the victim’s pinky.\nAnyone with information about who the man may be has been asked to report it to the Crime Stoppers Hotline at 785-843-TIPS. No further information has been released.\nCopyright 2025 KCTV. All rights reserved.",

The [Alabama](https://www.on3.com/teams/alabama-crimson-tide/) guard told reporters he feels “100%” ahead of the matchup against [UConn](https://www.on3.com/college/connecticut-huskies/). Wrightsell has missed time with a head injury as the Crimson Tide rattled off a run to Phoenix. He said he has “passed a few of the tests already” and still has “to pass a couple more” before being cleared to play in Saturday’s game, providing some optimism about his availability. [You can watch the tournament live on Prime Video, add on your favorite channels and watch at home or on your phone and laptop at work!](https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/storefront/ref=atv_hm_spo_c_rEmqNT_6_2?contentType=tournament&contentId=amzn1.dv.icid.64a44c0e-3ac7-4b14-ad4d-c2a438001f2c&jic=8%7CEgNhbGw%3D) Wrightsell [returned to practice](https://www.on3.com/college/alabama-crimson-tide/news/nate-oats-shares-injury-update-on-latrell-wrightsell-confirms-he-practiced-tuesday/) earlier this week, head coach [Nate Oats](https://www.on3.com/db/coach/nate-oats-131645/) said, which was a big step toward getting back on the court for game action. “Today was the first day Wrightsell was able to practice,” Oats [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgtHquBBLNA&ab_channel=BamaOnLine). “He was limited in what he could do but glad he was out there. He’s got day-to-day evaluations. Based on how tomorrow morning’s evaluation goes, we’ll see where he goes the rest of the week. Our hopes are that he’s going to play on Saturday.” Latrell Wrightsell last played in the second-round against Grand Canyon, scoring just two points in 11 minutes. Getting hit in the head near the Alabama bench kept him on the ground before quickly being ruled out in the first-half. The Crimson Tide face quite a task in the Final Four, facing a UConn team that has yet to allow 60 points in a tournament game, and in the Elite Eight against [Illinois](https://www.on3.com/college/illinois-fighting-illini/), opened up a 30-0 run to start the second half. Oats knows his team is the underdog, but embracing that mentality, especially considering the Tide have been dealing with it [the whole tournament](https://www.on3.com/college/alabama-crimson-tide/news/nate-oats-on-underdog-mentality-vs-uconn-nobodys-going-to-pick-us-to-win/). “Nobody’s gonna pick us to win,” [Oats said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=061tXkm_3go). “We’re kind of playing with house money a little bit, if you will. We weren’t supposed to beat Clemson. We weren’t supposed to beat North Carolina. A lot of people were picking against us against Grand Canyon. “… We’re not gonna be picked to win, I know that, but sometimes the best team, the one that’s picked, doesn’t always win. We were the underdog against Carolina – not as big as we are now – but we figured out a way to win. I don’t think our guys are gonna relax to the point where they’re not gonna play hard and be ready to play. We played hard these last four games.”",

    "text": "Chinese brand Deepal has locked in the electric S05 SUV for Australia, due here during the second half of 2025.\nThis move follows the launch of the larger S07 SUV and Deepal's commitment to expanding its electric vehicle (EV) lineup in Australia under the Inchcape distributorship.\nThe Deepal S05 is set to compete directly with established models such as the BYD Atto 3, offering Australian consumers a new option in the fast-growing small electric SUV segment.\nMeasuring 4620mm in length, 1900mm in width, and 1600mm in height, with a wheelbase of 2880mm, the S05 maintains the Deepal family look with a modern exterior design that includes features like frameless windows and hidden door handles.\nCompared to the BYD Atto 3, the S05 has a 160mm longer wheelbase.\nHundreds of new car deals are available through CarExpert right now. Get the experts on your side and score a great deal. Browse now.\nAlthough exact details are yet to be officially confirmed for the Australian market, the Deepal S05 offers two powertrain options in other markets.\nThe pure electric variant has a 175kW/320Nm rear-mounted electric motor, delivering 320Nm of torque, powered by a 56.12kWh lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery.\nIt boasts an estimated range of up to 510 kilometres on the CLTC cycle.\nThe S05 also comes in a range-extended electric vehicle (EREV) version, which combines a 1.5-litre petrol engine acting as a generator with a 160kW electric motor.\nThis gives it a pure electric range of approximately 200 kilometres and a total range exceeding 1200 kilometres when utilising both power sources.\nInside the cabin, the S05 boasts a 15.4-inch central touchscreen powered by the Qualcomm SA8155P chip, running Deepal OS 3.0.\nLike a Tesla, there's no traditional instrument cluster but, unlike a Tesla, a useful head-up display (HUD) provides drivers with essential information directly on the windshield.\nDepending on the variant, the interior design includes a two-tone colour scheme with chrome accents, hidden air vents, and a panoramic sunroof.\nThe confirmation of another Deepal model will add to the growing list of new Chinese vehicles appearing in 2025, with brands such as MG, Chery, GWM, and BYD, as well as newcomers like Zeekr, Leapmotor, and Aion, all set to expand their lineups.\nAdditional information regarding the S05's specifications, pricing, and availability will be available toward the end of March.\nContent originally sourced from: CarExpert.com.au",

    "text": "Azerbaijan said Thursday that its military positions in the autonomous Nakhchivan exclave came under fire from neighboring Armenia. The Defense Ministry said positions near the settlement of Lakatagh, located about 8 kilometers (5 miles) from the border, were fired upon by Armenian forces at around 4.10 p.m. local time (1210GMT). \"Response measures were taken in the mentioned direction by units of our army,\" it said in a statement. Armenia's Defense Ministry later said the statement issued by Baku \"doesn't correspond to reality.\" Before the shooting, Azerbaijan last reported that its military positions were fired upon on Sept. 12. Relations between Baku and Yerevan have been tense since 1991 when the Armenian military occupied Karabakh -- a territory internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan, and seven adjacent regions. Most of the territory was liberated by Azerbaijan during a 44-day war in the fall of 2020, which ended after a Russian-brokered peace agreement that opened the door to normalization and the demarcation of their border. In September 2023, Azerbaijan established full sovereignty in Karabakh following an \"anti-terrorist operation\" after which separatist forces in the region surrendered.",

По его сведениям, это является одной из причин того, что Госдепартамент предписал части сотрудников американского посольства покинуть арабскую страну.\nВ публикации уточняется, что спецпосланник президента США Дональда Трампа Стивен Уиткофф по-прежнему планирует встретиться с представителями Ирана для проведения очередного раунда переговоров по ядерному досье Тегерана.\nРанее представитель военных кругов США сообщил СМИ, что министр обороны Пит Хегсет разрешил «добровольный отъезд» членов семей американских военнослужащих с Ближнего Востока по соображениям безопасности. В свою очередь Госдепартамент заявил, что предписал части сотрудников посольства США в Ираке покинуть страну из-за «роста напряженности в регионе». Трамп, комментируя эти шаги, заявил: «Их вывозят, поскольку это место может быть опасным. Увидим, что будет». Говоря об Иране, американский лидер подчеркнул: «Нельзя, чтобы они получили ядерное оружие. Очень просто. Нельзя, чтобы они получили ядерное оружие. Мы этого не допустим».\nВ последние недели вашингтонская администрация была обеспокоена тем, что Израиль готовится нанести удар по Ирану, несмотря на продолжающиеся переговоры по ядерной программе Тегерана. По сведениям интернет-портала Axios, Трамп в телефонном разговоре 9 июня предостерег премьер-министра еврейского государства Биньямина Нетаньяху от такого шага.\nРанее в среду министр обороны Ирана Азиз Насирзаде заявил, что в случае войны с США исламская республика атакует все американские военные базы на Ближнем Востоке.",

    "text": "原标题：国补叠加旧车回收多重优惠 “小电驴”市场掀起换新热潮\n“顾客不仅能享受国补，还能根据旧车的具体情况进行相应抵扣，厂家有时还会对特定车型给予额外优惠。”近日，在北京市东城区一家电动自行车专卖店内，有不少消费者前来选车。该门店负责人周女士告诉记者，自从今年电动自行车以旧换新活动启动后，迎来一波换购新车热潮，门店销量比去年同期增长约30%。\n根据商务部等5部门联合印发的《关于做好2025年度电动自行车以旧换新工作的通知》(以下简称《通知》)，自今年1月1日起延续开展电动自行车以旧换新工作。“往年2月都是销售淡季，但今年我们的销量很不错，现在天气逐渐暖和了，接下来要更忙了。”周女士说。\n国补叠加旧车回收多重优惠\n“我这辆旧电动自行车骑了5年，看到今年以旧换新活动又上新了，正好置换一辆。”在上述门店提车的王女士给记者算了一笔账：目标新车的标价是3500元，可以申领500元国补，旧车抵扣400元，最后实际提车只花了2600元，“省了900元”。\n为鼓励电动自行车以旧换新，《通知》提出，对个人消费者交售报废老旧电动自行车并换购合格新车的，给予以旧换新补贴。\n“我们主要根据电动自行车的车身完好程度、使用年份、电池容量等来确定回收金额，普遍在100元至500元不等，有部分车型的回收价格甚至高达1000元。”周女士介绍说。\n截至目前，已有多个省份出台实施细则，各地在具体的补贴标准上有所不同。例如，北京市2025年电动自行车以旧换新补贴标准为每辆新购车辆补贴500元。\n带动非标旧车加速淘汰\n来源权属明确且配备车载电池的报废老旧电动自行车可参加以旧换新(含无牌)；交售的老旧电动自行车必须交由具备相关资质的回收企业报废处置，并完善交接手续；推动增加回收企业数量，合理提高交售旧车的价格，激励消费者选择正规渠道交售报废旧车……电动自行车收旧环节的诸多优化举措，吸引了不少消费者逐步淘汰旧车，推动电动自行车领域向安全规范的方向“提速前行”。\n日前，电动自行车强制性国家标准修订后正式对外发布，新国标将替代2018年版本标准，于今年9月1日实施。同时，工信部明确，消费者已经购买的不符合新标准的车辆不会被强制淘汰，可借助以旧换新等政策加速更新换代。\n对此，广州市电动自行车行业协会秘书长巫立东分析认为，今年电动自行车以旧换新政策通过扩大收旧范围、强制报废拆解等举措，在扩大参与受众的同时兼顾了安全规范，对淘汰不符合新国标的非规范电动自行车具有显著推动作用。\n推动行业提质升级\n“消费者对于更智能、续航里程更长、安全系数更高的电动自行车换购需求旺盛。”周女士说，以旧换新让顾客有了更大的选择空间，在同样的预算下，顾客可以购买到性能更好、配置更全的电动自行车。\n巫立东认为，以旧换新可以加速淘汰落后产能，倒逼生产企业转型生产符合新国标的车型，促进智能控制系统等核心部件的升级，推动产业链向高质量方向发展。\n据悉，2024年全国电动自行车以旧换新超过138万辆，发放补贴资金6亿多元，带动销售37.4亿元。“今年延续去年的以旧换新工作，通过经济激励、扩大覆盖范围、强制报废的组合拳，将加速淘汰存量非标电动车，同时推动行业向安全化、智能化、标准化、绿色化转型。”巫立东表示。\n本报记者 赵欢《工人日报》(2025年03月13日 04版)",
