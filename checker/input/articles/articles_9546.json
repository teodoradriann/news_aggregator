    "title": "Global sea levels jumped due to El Nino and warming climate, says NASA | Tuoi Tre News",
    "text": "Global average sea level rose by about 0.3 inches (0.76 centimeters) from 2022 to 2023 -- nearly four times the increase of the previous year -- NASA said Thursday, attributing the \"significant jump\" to a strong El Nino and a warming climate. The NASA-led analysis is based on more than 30 years of satellite observations, with the initial satellite launching in 1992 and the latest in 2020. Overall, sea levels have risen by around four inches since 1993. The rate of increase has also accelerated, more than doubling from 0.07 inches per year in 1993, to the current rate of 0.17 inches per year. \"Current rates of acceleration mean that we are on track to add another 20 centimetres of global mean sea level by 2050,\" said Nadya Vinogradova Shiffer, director for the NASA sea level change team and the ocean physics program in Washington. That would be double the amount of change in the next three decades compared to the previous century, she said, creating a future where flooding is far more frequent and catastrophic than today. The immediate cause of the spike is the El Nino weather effect, which replaced the La Nina from 2021 to 2022, when the sea level rose around 0.08 inches. El Nino involves warmer-than-average ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific. \"In El Nino years, a lot of the rain that normally falls on land ends up in the ocean, which raises sea levels temporarily,\" said Josh Willis, a sea level researcher at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). But there is also a clear human footprint evident in the underlying trend of acceleration. \"Long-term datasets like this 30-year satellite record allow us to differentiate between short-term effects on sea level, like El Nino, and trends that let us know where sea level is heading,\" said Ben Hamlington, lead for NASA's sea level change team at JPL. Technological innovations have brought greater accuracy of measurements over the years. For example, radar altimeters bounce microwaves off the sea surface, then record the time the signal takes to travel back to the satellite, as well as the strength of the return signal. They also cross-check their data with other sources like tide gauges and satellite measurements of atmospheric water vapor and Earth's gravity field.",

    "text": "Gaza City, May 7: Hamas has accepted a proposal mediated by Qatar and Egypt, marking a potential breakthrough in the ongoing conflict in Gaza, CNN reported. mThe proposal, outlined in a document obtained by CNN from a reliable source in the region, lays out a comprehensive plan aimed at de-escalating tensions and paving the way for sustainable peace. According to the document, the agreement will be implemented in three phases, each lasting 42 days. The first phase entails the release of 33 Israeli hostages, including women, children, the elderly, and the sick, over the course of six weeks. In exchange, Israeli forces will gradually withdraw from parts of Gaza, reconnaissance flights will be halted for 10 hours daily, and disarmed Palestinians will be allowed free movement throughout the Gaza Strip. Additionally, hundreds of Palestinian prisoners are set to be released, with specific criteria outlined for the exchange process, as reported by CNN. Hamas Accepts Egyptian-Qatari Ceasefire Proposal for Gaza After Israel Orders Rafah Evacuation Ahead of Attack Notably, the agreement stipulates that for every Israeli hostage released by Hamas, 30 Palestinian women and children will be released, along with 30 Palestinian prisoners over the age of 50 for each Israeli hostage in the same age group. Furthermore, female IDF soldiers are included in the 33 hostages, with Israel agreeing to release 50 Palestinian prisoners for every IDF woman soldier released, including 30 serving life sentences. The humanitarian aspect of the agreement is underscored by an extensive effort to facilitate the entry of aid into Gaza, including makeshift shelters and homes, as well as the rehabilitation of key infrastructure such as hospitals and the electric plant. The second phase of the agreement is set to focus on achieving a sustainable period of calm in Gaza, along with the release of the remaining hostages, including civilian men and IDF male soldiers. While specific details of this phase were not fully disclosed in the document, it is anticipated to build upon the progress made in the first phase, according to CNN. The third and final phase of the agreement outlines a comprehensive rebuilding plan for Gaza, spanning three to five years. This phase underscores the long-term commitment to rebuilding the region and fostering stability and prosperity for its inhabitants. International efforts to broker a ceasefire and facilitate the implementation of the agreement are underway, with a Qatari delegation scheduled to continue indirect negotiations in Cairo. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has called on both the Israeli government and Hamas to agree to a ceasefire deal, following Hamas&#039;s acceptance of the proposal put forth by Egypt and Qatar. Israel-Hamas War: UN Chief Antonio Guterres Warns Against Ground Invasion of Rafah Amid Escalating Tensions in Gaza The developments have sparked hope among officials and stakeholders, with Qatar expressing optimism for a swift resolution to the conflict and the sustainable flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza. Jordanian Minister of Foreign Affairs Ayman Safadi has also echoed these sentiments, emphasising the urgent need for a comprehensive agreement to be reached, CNN reported.

    "text": "Rise of the Demonic: Derek Prince’s Warning in Today’s Culture\nWe must ask ourselves: Have we ignored the warning signs?\nDecades ago, Bible teacher Derek Prince warned of the dangers of seeking supernatural knowledge outside of God. Today, his words ring truer than ever as the occult infiltrates mainstream culture, from Taylor Swift’s music laced with dark spiritual themes to Blizzard Entertainment’s ‘Diablo IV’ online gamin community normalizing demonic imagery, and Hocus Pocus teaching young audiences that witchcraft is harmless fun. The enemy is no longer hiding in the shadows—he is flaunting his influence in broad daylight.\nPrince made one thing clear: “Almost any form of supernatural knowledge is very, very dangerous.” He emphasized that there are only two sources of supernatural power—God or Satan. “If it doesn’t come from God, it does come from the devil.” Yet, today’s culture encourages people, particularly young audiences, to explore the dark arts. From Ouija boards to tarot cards, these practices are no longer just lurking in obscure corners of occult bookstores; they are sold in mainstream retailers, promoted on social media and glamorized in entertainment.\nBreaking News. Spirit-Filled Stories. Subscribe to Charisma on YouTube now!\nWe see evidence of this in music, movies and video games with companies and artists incorporating occultic imagery and lyrics that openly reference summoning spirits. Taylor Swift’s “Willow” music video, for instance, showcases ritualistic imagery that mirrors actual pagan, aka demonic, practices. Prince warned of this deception, explaining that many unknowingly tie themselves to false gods through supernatural pursuits: “If we get into any other supernatural realm of visions or revelations or knowledge or prediction, and we didn’t go by Jesus Christ, we got into the realm of evil and of Satan.”\nPrince also noted how the occult often follows generational lines, passing through family bloodlines: “A grandmother who’s a fortune-teller or a clairvoyant is liable to have one favorite grandchild… that favorite grandchild will be the recipient of that evil supernatural power.” This warning should make parents and grandparents take notice—what spiritual doors are being opened in their children’s lives through exposure to modern occultic trends?\nGet your FREE CHARISMA NEWSLETTERS today! Stay up-to-date with current issues, Holy Spirit news, Christian teachings, Charisma videos & more!\nThe modern world has embraced the demonic without discernment, dismissing biblical warnings as outdated superstition. But as Prince rightly stated, “We need to repent, we need to revoke the claim that they have over us, and we need to loose ourselves from their dark evil influence.”\nThe question now is: Will we heed this warning, or continue to let darkness infiltrate our homes, our schools and our entertainment?\nJoin Charisma Magazine Online to follow everything the Holy Spirit is doing around the world!\nJames Lasher is staff writer for Charisma Media.",

    "title": "The warmest December in Howard County history",
    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Howard County, Nebraska from 1901-2000 was 25.1. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Howard County, Nebraska experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Howard County, Nebraska history.",

In this pilot phase, all screenings will be free. The BBMP plans to launch the kiosks by December, with the company selected for the contract required to set them up within 30 days of receiving the supply order.</p>.<p>Like a bank ATM, the kiosks feature touchscreens for input and display and can check vital health parameters with tools like a 12-lead ECG, digital stethoscope, and blood pressure monitor. They’ll also include kits for testing dengue, pregnancy, typhoid, malaria, and HIV, along with contactless temperature measurement and automated height and weight readings.</p>.<p>Each unit costs around Rs 10 lakh, and the tender specifies that the company must provide a one-month supply of reagents upon installation. The kiosks will be connected to an online platform, allowing patients and doctors to access health data for follow-up consultations.</p>.<p>BBMP staff will be trained on the machines to assist users, and telemedicine services will be integrated later to provide access to specialists. “This is similar to the model launched last year in Kalaburagi, where health ATMs screen for up to 50 parameters,” said BBMP's Suralkar Vikas Kishore.</p>",
