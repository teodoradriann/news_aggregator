    "text": "The Guardian ‘It’s a golden age’: poetry flourishes in Ukraine – but at a terrible price Read full article Luke Harding in Kyiv December 29, 2023 at 7:00 a.m. · 7 min read Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The Guardian\nA year ago, the poet Borys Humenyuk sent a final message. For 24 hours, he and two fellow Ukrainian soldiers had been under relentless Russian fire. Shells rained down on their trench outside the eastern city of Bakhmut. “We’re running out of ammo. Down to the last bullet,” Humenyuk said over a crackling radio. Those were his last words.\nHumenyuk had volunteered to relieve a group of exhausted service personnel at “zero”, the hottest part of the frontline. Now, he explained, he was wounded in the shoulder and unable to drag his injured comrade to safety. “We are stuck,” he reported. By the time an evacuation team reached the trench in the village of Klishchiivka , Humenyuk had disappeared.\n“There was no sign of him,” said Serhii Pantiuk , another poet and soldier. “We didn’t find a body.” Pantiuk said he believed the Russians had captured his friend. Using an artillery barrage as cover, they had overrun his company’s forward position, stealing across an open field with a few small, bare trees. Such were the vicissitudes of war, he said.\n“I believe Borys is alive. He is an adventurous spirit and a clever, artistic guy,” Pantiuk said. “The Russians don’t retrieve the corpses of their own soldiers. We have never seen them pick up the bodies of dead Ukrainians. So Borys must be in a Russian prison.” He conceded there was no proof of this, since Moscow refuses to release a list of those it has captured.\nHumenyuk was 57 when he vanished on 27 December 2022. He had been fighting as a volunteer since 2014, soon after Russia began its covert takeover of the Donbas region. Last year, he rejoined the military and became a deputy commander, in charge of a machine-gun unit. In his last interview , Humenyuk said he had been preparing for a war with Russia “my whole life”.\n“I don’t expect to come back from it. If I do, it will be a miracle,” he said.\nAmid booms and explosions, Humenyuk wrote poetry and posted it regularly on Facebook .\nPantiuk said he composed his own verse on a smartphone during breaks from active duty. He scribbled one haiku on the back of a Winston cigarette packet. “You can’t sleep for the first day. Your brain whirs,” he said. He emailed his material via a Starlink satellite connection to his wife in Kyiv.\nStory continues Pantiuk’s latest volume of poetry, his 19th, is titled The Disappearing Winter. He described Humenyuk as one of his country’s best modern poets. “Borys’s work superficially resembles prose. But when you read word by word, you realise it’s like a sacred text. Each poem is a mini-novel,” he reflected. Before last year’s full-scale invasion, Humenyuk had published two collections from the trenches, one of them called Poems from War.\nThe experience of conflict has changed Ukrainian poets and their use of language. “It’s crisper, sharper and with the potential to turn toxic,” observed Oksana Maksymchuk, a poet and translator based in Chicago, writing in an anthology of recent Ukrainian poetry called Words for War . It features several pieces by Humenyuk , and other notable writers including the novelist and poet Serhiy Zhadan.\n“Borys’s was a remarkable voice. Despite its complexity, it spoke to so many. He was far more widely read than most other poets in the volume. He also loved painting and was very prolific ,” Maksymchuk said. Divorced, Humenyuk had adult daughters and looked after a number of cats.\nMaksymchuk said Ukrainian poets had abandoned conventional Russian literary devices such as metre and alliteration. There was a new emphasis on storytelling and narrative, often expressed via the medium of free verse. Maksymchuk’s co-editor and fellow poet Max Rosochinsky said there was a move against embellishment and musicality in favour of plainer poems similar to diaries or memoirs.\n“The aestheticising of war experience is seen as suspect and morally problematic,” Rosochinsky explained. “There is resistance to the idea that war poetry should be beautiful.” Instead, the new forms of Ukrainian poetry stressed the importance of truth, and experimented with the “decomposition” of words during a period when Russian bombs were turning Ukrainian homes and cities into rubble and ripping apart soldiers and civilians.\nHumenyuk’s life and possible death invite comparison with Wilfred Owen and other English poets who fought in the trenches of the first world war. Maksymchuk, however, said contemporary Ukrainian poetry included more civilian voices, especially those of women watching the war unfold from afar. Videos and news reports allowed them to reflect on what was happening in a way that was rare in the 20th century.\nAgainst a backdrop of daily missile attacks, poetry readings are extremely popular. In October, hundreds of people crowded into the basement of Lviv’s puppet theatre to hear the poet and scholar Halyna Kruk recite her work. Zhadan and other writers have toured the front, giving readings to combatants. In Kherson, the southern city recaptured by Ukraine last year, a poetry festival was held in an anonymous building.\n#Kherson : The most unusual poetry reading.\nThe place couldn't be named. Invitations couldn't be sent. The basement was full. It was in the morning. Sirens and artillery strikes never stopped. pic.twitter.com/xqJDQUUYbj\n— Zarina Zabrisky 🇺🇸🇺🇦 (@ZarinaZabrisky) November 7, 2023\n“It was mind-blowing. You could hear sirens and explosions going on,” said Zarina Zabrisky, a journalist and poet. She posted video of the event on social media. There were regular Kherson open mic readingswhose locations were shared at the last minute by word of mouth. Local poets read lyrics, as well as prose and humorous stories. “Everyone laughs. About 10 to 20 people come. It’s very sweet,” Zabrisky said, adding that Russia had targeted venues afterwards.\nMaksymchuk said: “Poetry readings are a good way of feeling solidarity. You feel disoriented and confused and want to be attuned to a collective feeling. The poems are an emotional discharge. That’s why people come in such big numbers.” There were similarities with Greek tragedies, performed at a moment of tension, when ancient Athens and other city states were under threat from Persian invasion, she said.\nThere are also Russophone poets writing from the other side of the frontline. Until 2022, there was dialogue between pro-Ukrainian writers and their counterparts in the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics in the east of the country. This stopped last year. “They unfriended us,” Maksymchuk said, and added that the LNR and DNR poets became ideological cheerleaders for Putin’s war, and these days mostly wrote propaganda.\nEurope’s biggest conflict since 1945 has boosted the international market for Ukrainian writing and verse. It is easier for poets to get their work published in journals and magazines. “It’s a golden age. We don’t know how long it will last,” Rosochinsky said. In February, Jonathan Cape will publish Food for the Dead by Charlotte Shevchenko Knight, a British-Ukrainian poet. Her book is described as “an eloquent, moving counter-song against Russian totalitarianism”.\nThis flourishing has come at a terrible price. In July, a Russian missile strike killed the Ukrainian novelist Victoria Amelina in the eastern city of Kramatorsk. She had started writing poetry in response to the war . A few months earlier, Russian soldiers abducted and executed Volodymyr Vakulenko , a poet and children’s writer. His diary of occupation was found hidden under a cherry tree at his home in Izium when the city was liberated.\nIn a Facebook post, Humenyuk said he hated meeting new people on the frontline because when he called them a few weeks later, nobody picked up. If he is still alive and in prison, he will not have access to books or paper, Pantiuk posited. But he added: “I have no doubt Borys is writing poems in his head.”\nFrom Not a Poem in 40 Days … by Borys Humenyuk Translated from the Ukrainian by Oksana Maksymchuk and Max Rosochinsky.\nPoetry saw people die.\nPoetry put spent bullet shells in its ears.\nPoetry would rather go blind\nThan see corpses every day.\nPoetry is the shortcut to heaven.\nPoetry sees into the void.\nWhen you fall\nIt lets you remember your way back.\nPoetry went places\nWhere there isn’t place for poetry.\nPoetry witnessed it all.\nPoetry witnessed it all.\nTRENDING 1.

Posing with her [kids ](https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/helen-flanagan)and a close pal at the check-in desk, Helen revealed that they were all excited to spend time together after a few days apart. The actress grinned as she held Delilah in her arms, while her friend carried Charlie, and Matilda stood next to her luggage trolley for the photo. She documented the gruelling 16-hour flight on her Instagram, as Helen admitted she was \"so tired\" as she struggled to keep her kids occupied. Sharing a clip of her with Charlie sat on her lap, Helen looked exhausted as she tried to get the toddler to sleep. Next, she posted a video a few minutes later, of Delilah sitting on her knee, as Charlie slept soundly on the seat next to her. Helen then shared a short clip showing her cradling Charlie as she assured one of her daughter’s that they were \"going to the hotel in a minute\". The actress wrote alongside the video: \"20 million hour flight done. Charlie was a dream, it was really hard work, all the other flights this year, but my boy is 3 in March so starting to watch films and wear headphones.\" Helen did choose to share her feelings of spending Christmas away from her kids this year, as she revealed she wasn't in the mood to celebrate without them. The actress spent seven days without them, and confessed she felt \"weird without the kids\" this year, but vowed to have a different experience in 2024. She wrote earlier this month: \"Wasn’t really feeling Christmas this year, felt weird without the kids but next year I’ll be festive.\" In another snap, Helen revealed that she had \"drank too much\" on a night out, and ended up in a bath nursing her hangover. She flashed a peace sign in another video as she spoke about her battle with premenstrual dysphoric disorder, as she thanked Vicky Pattison for encouraging her to get help with the condition. Helen wrote: \"Finally doing something about my PMDD Thankyou @vickypattison for being a support.\" Join the Daily Record WhatsApp community!

    "title": "White supremacist pleads guilty to murder in sprawling jailhouse conspiracy as Aryan Brotherhood trial looms",
    "text": "Brant “Two Scoops” Daniel, a member of the Aryan Brotherhood prison gang in California , copped a deal with prosecutors and pleaded guilty to murder in aid of racketeering this week, making him the latest gang member to peel off from a group of over a dozen white supremacists indicted in a sweeping multistate drug-and-murder-fueled jailhouse conspiracy. Sixteen members of the prison gang, allegedly led by Ronald “Renegade” Yandell and William “Billy” Sylvester, were charged in 2019, according to unsealed court records obtained Thursday by Law&Crime. Federal prosecutors indicted them and 14 others — including Daniel — that June, alleging they engaged in schemes from 2011 to 2016 that relied on contraband cellphones smuggled into their prison cells to sell heroin or peddle methamphetamines. And when the gang members weren’t selling drugs, DEA investigators claim they were busy ordering hits on their enemies and anyone they deemed in violation of the so-called Aryan Brotherhood “code of conduct.” Investigators said they were able to uncover evidence to bring the charges through an extensive seizure of the defendant’s devices as well as widespread wiretapping. In court records that offer explicit detail of his confession to murder in aid of racketeering, Daniel admitted that while incarcerated at the Salinas Valley Prison in October 2016, he stabbed fellow inmate Zachary Scott to death while they were both “on the yard.” Ignoring commands to stand down from swarming guards as he stabbed Scott 17 times throughout his “arms, shoulders, abdomen, chest, ribcage and face,” Daniel admitted in the plea that he inflicted puncture wounds so severe that at one point, he watched his prison-made weapon go through Scott’s back and “out his chest.” “Right through him,” Daniel told one investigator. “Right through him.” He recalled telling approaching guards: “Yeah I did it. It was me. I did it and that’s all I have to say about that.” He hit Scott so hard, he broke his knuckle, he added. Daniel also admitted that there was another individual he would have killed that day and boasted during a police interview, court records show, that “you guys would have had a double homicide.” Daniel said he and another inmate murdered Scott because the man had “failed to carry out the killing of fellow inmate that Daniel had assigned to [him] as a white inmate subordinate” to the Aryan Brotherhood, Daniel himself and others at Salinas. An intercepted “kite” or a secret message passed from Daniel to another inmate during this time also showed him taking credit for Scott’s murder, the plea deal notes, while lamenting how Scott had failed to kill another inmate in his prison cell versus “on the yard” as Daniel had ordered him. Scott had also lost valuable drugs that belonged to him and the Brotherhood, Daniel admitted as part of the plea deal. Several of the defendants have pleaded guilty already as the racketeering case slowly snakes its way to trial. The trial is expected to start in late February 2024 and according to a statement from prosecutors, with Daniel’s plea out of the way, only five of the 16 originally charged gang members are now on track to face a jury before presiding Chief U.S. District Judge Kimberly J. Mueller. The defendants who will stand trial — for now — include accused leaders Yandell and Sylvester as well as codefendants Daniel “Danny” Troxell, Pat “Big Pat” Brady, and Jason “Jake” Corbett. As for Daniel, 49, by pleading guilty to murder in aid of racketeering this week, he received a sentence of life in federal prison instead of state prison. He is currently detained at a California State Prison facility known as “New Folsom.” Federal prisons typically have higher security measures in place and are more restrictive to inmates given that the population is usually serving longer sentences for more violent or serious offenses. An attorney for Daniel did not immediately return a request for comment to Law&Crime seeking further detail on why Daniel went this route, but The Sacramento Bee reported that Daniel has historically accused state guards of harassing him or even attempting to frame him for the death of other inmates. Daniel’s lawyer also told the California-based outlet that while Daniel may have struck a deal, it wasn’t to cooperate with prosecutors when they make their case next year. Daniel had already pleaded guilty to Scott’s murder in 2017, the lawyer said, and he was already serving 30 years to life for that charge. Daniel struck a deal to spare himself and his family the “expense and burden” of a jury trial, the attorney said. Daniel was also previously convicted for attempted murder in 1995. Prosecutors opted not to seek the death penalty against the defendants — who are suspected in the brutal murders of at least five inmates — this fall. Have a tip we should know? [email protected]",

    "text": "Una de las singularidades de la música cubana en su vertiente popular es la línea melódica conformada por dos voces, las cuales se nombran primera y segunda; esta última, la más compleja. Cuando hablamos de esta tipicidad hay que destacar a un cantante imprescindible: Adriano Rodríguez, uno de los mejores «segundos» de Cuba.\nLa rumba ha sido un elemento catalizador de nuestra cultura musical, al hibridar géneros que aún llevan sus fundamentos; la utilización de la voz solista y, en específico, los ancestrales coros de claves, son eslabones fundamentales en esa adaptación sonora hacia zonas trovadorescas, que podemos identificar incluso desde el primer bolero cubano reconocido, compuesto en 1883 por Pepe Sánchez y titulado Tristezas.\nComo dato interesante debemos añadir que muchos han considerado (y me incluyo) que esta obra es a la vez nuestra primera canción trovadoresca, pues estilísticamente marcó líneas definitorias. Con la llegada del siglo xx, esa tendencia musical afianzaría sus recursos expresivos y marcaría, hasta hoy, la utilización de las mencionadas dos voces como un culto invariable de su entronización morfológica.\nAdriano Rodríguez (27 de septiembre de 1924-23 de julio de 2015) nació en Guanabacoa, donde un entorno casi único le hizo converger con santeros, soneros, trovadores y compositores líricos, lo cual influyó notablemente en él. Se conoce que un cercano amigo de su familia y personalidad dentro de la música afrocubana, Alberto Zayas, director del grupo folclórico Lulú Yonkori, le invitó a formar parte de este para que hiciera coros y cantara como solista.\nEn ese mismo espacio sonoro, Adriano colabora con figuras como Fernando Ortiz, Odilio Urfé y Argeliers León, al formar parte de conferencias dictadas por ellos, lo que constituyó un camino de aprendizaje y de superación constante. Como muestra de su versatilidad, también trabaja bajo las tutelas de Gonzalo Roig y de Enrique González Mántici, figuras referenciales del arte lírico y sinfónico cubano, e incluso comparte escenario con Rita Montaner en varias oportunidades.\nSu ductilidad artística no tiene límites e integra el Coro Polifónico Nacional en 1961, bajo la dirección de Serafín Pro (hoy Coro Nacional de Cuba), y mantiene sus trabajos trovadorescos con diversos artistas y formatos, entre los que destaca el grupo Trovadores Cubanos, en el que compartió junto a Guarionex Garay (uno de los hijos de Sindo), Dominica Verges y Octavio e Ismael Sánchez.\nPero, sin duda, una colaboración inesperada para muchos fue la que mantuvo durante más de 15 años –y hasta su muerte en 2015– con Edesio Alejandro, en la que Adriano mezclaba su potente voz de barítono junto a elementos electrónicos y de beat cubano diseñados por Edesio, rompiendo esquemas sonoros e incluso visuales: un añejo trovador vestido de blanco se fundía en la modernidad de estos tiempos al interpretar boleros, guarachas y sones con ribetes electroacústicos.\nAdriano fue la esencia misma de un artista comprometido y cabal con su tiempo, sin temor a experimentaciones musicales de ningún tipo.",

    "text": "The Opposition NDP is renewing its call for an investigation of claims made by Speaker Randy Weekes regarding a gun in the legislature and bullying by Sask. Party members.On Thursday, Official Opposition Deputy Leader Vicki Mowat responded to a letter from Weekes on a potential investigation into the allegations he made May 16.Opposition members are calling for the House Services Committee to meet as soon as possible to appoint an independent investigator and hear the testimony of four key witnesses.“The public deserves answers. Minister Harrison has been caught lying at least three times now. We can’t trust a word he says — we need an investigation,” said Mowat. “At the end of the day, this is about trust and accountability. You can’t have members of the Sask. Party openly lying to the public and trying to bully the independent Speaker. After 17 years, the Sask. Party clearly feels the rules don’t apply to them.”Mowat gave the Speaker notice Thursday that NDP members will introduce and discuss two resolutions if a date is struck for the next meeting of the House Services Committee:\"That the committee order pursuant to Rule 132(1) that the following witnesses appear at a future meeting of the committee to answer questions related to the allegations made by the Speaker on May 16, 2024:Scott Moe, Premier of Saskatchewan;Jeremy Harrison, Minister of Trade and Export Development;Lori Carr, Government House Leader; andReg Downs, Senior Advisor to the Premier.\"That the committee appoint an independent investigator to carry out an investigation into all the allegations made by the Speaker on May 16, 2024.\"An investigation initiated by the all-party House Services Committee could have the power to subpoena witnesses and compel them to testify under oath.Weekes alleged that Government House Leader Jeremy Harrison brought a long gun into the legislature, and tried to get permission to bring a handgun in. He alleged Harrison had bullied him and two previous speakers to get rulings favourable to the Sask Party.Weekes also read texts into the record from Carr during her role as Deputy House Leader from debate on the Parental Rights Act last October. He also reported an uncomfortable encounter with Downs in a hallway after the texts calling for him to act in certain ways prompted him to leave the legislative chamber and allow the Deputy Speaker to preside.On May 28, Official Opposition Critic for Ethics and Democracy Meara Conway wrote Weekes to request the House Services Committee to convene and appoint an independent investigator.On June 3, Weekes, who chairs the committee, forwarded the correspondence to the committee to ask, \"Please advise as to how committee members would like to proceed with this request.\"Mowat said Harrison, who resigned as Government House Leader, should be removed from his cabinet roles as Minister of Trade and Export Development and Minister of Immigration and Career Training. She alleged the governing Sask. Party of being less than forthright.",

    "text": "JENIN, Palestinian Territories — The Palestinian Freedom Theatre in the occupied West Bank will welcome actors back this weekend, just over a fortnight after an Israeli raid on the centre sparked an international outcry.\nIts artistic director Ahmed Tobasi told AFP the theatre in Jenin refugee camp had become a symbol of Palestinian resistance against Israel’s occupation of the West Bank.\nHe said troops broke into and vandalised the small cultural centre earlier this month during a wider raid on Jenin, leaving behind a trail of damage and Stars of David graffitied across the walls. The theatre said soldiers also arrested several employees in their homes.\nTobasi, who said he was among those detained, is now back at work and determined to keep the centre open.\n“For me, this is resistance,” the 39-year-old said as he gave AFP a tour of the theatre, which was set up in 2006.\nSoon after the raid on December 13 a Freedom Theatre appeal for the release of its staff won international support, with demonstrations in the streets of New York and Paris and playwrights, actors and directors from Britain to Mexico expressing their support.\nSince its founding, the unassuming performance space has become symbolic for Palestinians and their supporters, with its actors touring the world staging plays.\nStaff said they believed Israeli forces had gone out of their way to target the theatre.\nThe Israeli forces described the wider raid on Jenin, which Palestinian health authorities say killed 11 people, as designed to combat “terrorists” in the camp.\n“This is a theatre — there are no weapons or terrorists here,” Tobasi said.\nWhile the raid targeted a number of buildings in the camp, Tobasi said that to reach the theatre troops would have needed to turn off the main road and walk around 20 metres towards its entrance.\nAnother staff member, Ranin Odeh, said the centre was singled out for its reputation as “a place of resistance through art”.\n“I felt so angry to see Israeli soldiers inside. The theatre is like my home. They want to kill everything — not just people, but ideas too,” said the 31-year-old, who runs the theatre’s youth programme.\nStaff spent several days clearing up and plan to stage their first big event, an end-of-year workshop for young actors, on Sunday.\nThe army has not responded to AFP’s request for comment.\nDoor-to-door arrests\nAt the scene, Tobasi led AFP journalists past broken locks, splintered doorframes and smashed black and white photos.\n“What kind of behaviour is this from soldiers?” he said, standing next to a red Star of David sprayed across a projector screen.\nThe theatre posted an image on social media which appears to show troops and a military vehicle just outside the building. AFP has not been able to verify the picture.\nSoldiers went door to door arresting members of staff from their homes, the Freedom Theatre said in a series of online statements, adding they were among more than 100 Palestinians detained in Jenin.\nDrama graduate Jamal Abu Joas was released after more than a week in detention, while producer and manager Mustafa Sheta remains in custody, said Tobasi, who was still shaken from his own ordeal.\nTobasi said he was blindfolded, had his hands cuffed behind his back and was held for more than 12 hours at the Salam checkpoint west of Jenin. He accused army reservists of beating him.\nViolence in the West Bank — captured by Israel during the 1967 June War and occupied ever since — has surged following October 7.\nIsraeli forces and settlers have killed at least 314 people in the territory, Palestinian health officials say.\nJenin’s refugee camp, a stronghold for Palestinian armed groups, is regularly targeted by Israel in deadly raids. The Palestinian health ministry says many of those killed have been civilians.\nTobasi, who was born in and grew up in the camp, said the theatre had given him a way to resist occupation without violence. It was a break from the reality of life in the camp and a chance to imagine an alternative.\nFollowing the raid, he was more convinced than ever of the centre’s power.\n“Theatre is the place where we can express, fight and resist all,” Tobasi said.",

    "text": "Cologne police acting on indications of a possible attack searched Germany’s landmark cathedral with sniffer dogs on Saturday and said worshippers attending Christmas Eve Mass would undergo security screening before being allowed in. In Austria, police in Vienna also said they were taking heightened security measures around churches and Christmas markets, deploying both uniformed and plainclothes officers. Neither police agency specified the threat, but the German news agency dpa said authorities were responding to signs of a possible attack by Islamic extremists, without citing a specific source. Michael Esser, head of the criminal investigation department of the Cologne police, said in a news release that the threat indications pointed to New Year’s Eve rather than Christmas, but added that “we are putting everything possible in motion for the security of cathedral visitors on Christmas Eve”. Cologne’s towering cathedral, whose twin spires are 157 metres (515 feet) tall, is a major tourist destination visited by some six million people a year. Police and cathedral officials urged those attending Mass on Sunday evening to arrive early and not bring bags or purses. The European Union’s home affairs commissioner, Ylva Johansson, warned on December 5 that Europe faces a “huge risk of terrorist attacks” over the Christmas holidays due to fall-out from the war between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

    "title": "Why Corvette is Threatening to Ban Some 2025 ZR1 Buyers From Ever Buying a Future Corvette",
    "text": "Production for the 2025 Chevrolet Corvette ZR1, one of the most anticipated vehicles in American history, is expected to begin as early as next week. The Chevrolet Corvette Plant in Bowling Green, Kentucky, has been making other versions of the C8, but the ZR1 has been delayed because of supply chain issues. Now, there is word that buyers are being sent letters telling them that Corvette will not tolerate anyone buying the supercar just to flip it. Corvette is threatening to void the vehicle’s warranty if it is sold within the first year and the seller will be banned from ever buying another Corvette.\nCorvette Means Business\nAll Corvettes are high-demand vehicles but the ZR1 is truly special. As I have reported previously, General Motors President Mark Reuss drove the ZR1, in Germany, setting the top speed of 233 mph. The 1,064-horsepower beauty does 0-60 in an astonishing 2.3 seconds. That makes the ZR1 the fastest street legal car ever produced by a North American automaker.\nChevrolet confirms that the 2025 Corvette ZR1 equipped with the ZTK Performance Package can reach new records, running the quarter mile in 9.6 seconds. Based on these figures, no current production car under $1 million rivals the Corvette ZR1.\nThe 2025 Corvette ZR1’s quick performance is enabled by Corvette’s standard Launch Control and Custom Launch Control features, found throughout the lineup from Stingray to ZR1. Launch Control is programmed to manage tire spin and transmission clutch application rate. Custom Launch Control allows the driver to have more control to adjust for real-time conditions, optimizing acceleration runs by adjusting launch RPM and wheel slip targets from the steering wheel controls.\nC8 Versions and 0-60 Comparison Numbers\n- Stingray with available Z51 package: 2.9 seconds\n- Z06 with available Z07 package: 2.6 seconds\n- E-Ray: 2.5 seconds\n- ZR1 with available ZTK package: 2.3 seconds\nNew Record-Setting Lap Times at Different Tracks\nChevrolet wants to make sure that people understand the recently set records are not one-off circumstances. So, Chevy took the Corvette ZR1 to several different tracks and set new lap times at each of the tracks. Chevy even used four different drivers to drive home the point that the ZR1 is an extraordinary vehicle. With four different professional General Motors drivers behind the wheel, the Corvette ZR1 has set five new production car lap records during a U.S. track tour.\nAccording to Chevrolet, these are the five tracks and the Corvette ZR1’s lap times, each with a GM driver at the wheel:\n- Watkins Glen Long Course: 1:52.7. Driver: Bill Wise, Lead Performance Engineer, Chassis Controls.\n- Road America: 2:08.6. Driver: Brian Wallace, Lead Vehicle Dynamics Engineer.\n- Road Atlanta: 1:22.8. Driver: Chris Barber, Lead Development Engineer.\n- Virginia International Raceway Full Course: 1:47.7. Driver: Aaron Link, Global Vehicle Performance Manager.\n- Virginia International Raceway Grand Course: 2:32.3. Driver: Aaron Link.\nRecords Set with Pre-Production ZR1\nThe Corvette ZR1 used to set the records is equipped with the optional ZTK Performance Package. The ZTK Package notably adds an aggressive, high-downforce rear wing, front dive planes, and a tall hood Gurney lip – all constructed from woven carbon fiber. Underbody strakes replace the standard front underwing, to substantially increase front downforce. The suspension tuning included in the ZTK package incorporates stiffer springs and adds Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2R ZP tires.\n“Corvette ZR1 continues to showcase how this nameplate elevates at every corner,” Corvette executive chief engineer Tony Roma said. “From design, engineering, development, validation, to driving and setting incredible lap records like these – we do it all in house.”\nThe 2025 Corvette ZR1 Key Performance Details\n- It has a 5.5L, twin-turbocharged LT7 DOHC flat-plane crank V8 engine\n- 1,064 horsepower at 7,000 rpm\n- 828 lb.-ft. of torque at 6,000 rpm\n- The most power ever from a factory Corvette\n- The most powerful V8 ever produced in America from an auto manufacturer\n- The fastest car ever built by an American auto manufacturer, capable of 233 mph\n- Carbon fiber aero package creating over 1,200 pounds of downforce at top speed\nThe incredible performance and high demand is why Corvette is setting special rules about anyone trying to make a quick buck by selling the highly coveted Corvette. The ZR1 is a collector’s vehicle. It is unlikely that you will see many of them on the streets. Most will be locked away. Some very wealthy people may actually drive theirs. Corvette wants to make sure the people who buy them really want the supercar, not just the profit. If you are lucky enough to land one of the special beauties, be prepared to keep it for at least a year. If the sports car is sold too quickly, the person buying the Corvette will be punished as well. The quick sale will void the ZR1’s warranty, which could really become very expensive.\nIt is not unheard of for automakers to set restrictions on sales. When Ford sold its GT supercar, buyers had to sign contracts promising not to sell them within two years. Buyers also had to agree to allow Ford to show off the vehicles in certain events.\nThe MSRP for the Corvette ZR1 starts at $174,995 for the 1LZ coupe and $184,995 for the 1LZ hardtop convertible. Those prices include destination charges. However, individual dealers will set the final prices.\nChevrolet Photo\nMary Conway is a professional automotive journalist and has decades of experience specializing in automotive news analysis.

    "text": "OTTAWA — Health Canada is reminding Canadians about a recall of home bed assist handles after learning of an additional death. Four models of bed handles distributed by Drive Medical were first recalled two years ago after two reported deaths — one in Canada and one in the U.S. Health Canada says as of Dec. 19, the company has received a report of a second death in this country. The metal handles are affixed alongside the mattress to help people get in and out of their regular bed at home. The products are not designed for hospital beds. Health Canada says more than 68,000 of the affected handles were sold between 2016 and 2021 in Canada. It says consumers should stop using them and contact Drive Medical Canada to get a refund. The recalled home bed assist model numbers are 15064, 15062, RTL15073 and RTL15063-ADJ. No information has been provided about what caused any of the deaths, but the recall notice says that retention straps were not properly secured in the initial cases in Canada and the U.S. Drive Medical has also learned of an additional three deaths in the U.S. that happened before Dec. 6, 2021, when the recall was first issued. More than 496,000 of the bed assist products were distributed in the U.S. between 2007 and 2021. The products were sold on Amazon. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 28, 2023.
