    "text": "This Cinnamon Swirl Bundt Cake is my classic and–dare I say–perfect cream cheese pound cake with a cinnamon-sugar layer in the center and a sweet glaze drizzled on top. It’s perfectly moist and dense, with spiced flavor in every bite! I could happily enjoy this cake any time, whether as a breakfast treat with my coffee, a holiday dessert, or an afternoon snack all year round! If you love the warm, spiced flavors in this bundt cake, you have to try my Cinnamon Roll Blondies , too! They’re another cinnamon-sugar treat with a soft, chewy texture and that irresistible cinnamon roll flavor.\nIngredients & Substitutions Room Temperature Ingredients: Before starting this recipe, make sure the ingredients are at room temperature. This is especially true for the cream cheese, butter, eggs, and buttermilk. Cream Cheese: The cream cheese in the cake gives the cake so much moisture. It is part of the reason this cake is so amazing! Butter: Butter is a key ingredient in bundt cakes, giving them a rich, buttery flavor and moist crumb. You will need 2 1/2 sticks of salted butter. If using unsalted butter, add a pinch of kosher salt (about 1/4 teaspoon) to the cake batter. Eggs: Six large eggs bind the ingredients and give the cake structure. Cake Flour: This recipe requires cake flour. (Using all-purpose flour will yield different results.) You can make ‘homemade’ cake flour in a pinch if you don’t have cake flour . Buttermilk : Buttermilk adds moisture and a little tangy flavor to the cake, making it taste better. It also helps the cake rise and gives it a softer, lighter texture. If you don’t have any on hand, make homemade buttermilk. I have four ways to make buttermilk–use the sour cream version for this bundt cake recipe. Filling: The ‘cinnamon swirl’ comes from the cinnamon sugar mixture that is in the middle of the cake. Glaze: The simple sweet glaze is made with confectioners’ sugar (powdered sugar) and whole milk. Drizzle it over the cooled cake. How To Tell When A Bundt Cake Is Done Baking To tell when the Cinnamon Swirl Bundt Cake is done baking, insert a toothpick into the center of the cake. (Start checking around the 60-minute mark.) If it comes out with a few moist crumbs but no wet batter, the cake is ready. The edges of the cake should also be golden brown, and the top should spring back when gently pressed. If you’re unsure, you can bake it for a few more minutes, but be sure to check regularly to avoid overbaking.\nCan I Use A Different Pan For My Cinnamon Swirl Bundt Cake? Yes, If you don’t have a Bundt pan, you can use two loaf pans, a 9×13-inch baking dish, or a tube pan. Just remember, the baking time may change, so start checking the cake with a toothpick around 45-50 minutes. Once the toothpick comes out clean or with a few crumbs, the cake (or loaves) is done!\nHow To Store Cinnamon Swirl Bundt Cake Once the cake has set and is completely cooled, store it in an airtight container at room temperature. You can also wrap the cake in plastic wrap and aluminum foil, but be careful not to disturb the glaze. It will last up to 2 days. For longer storage, freeze the cake.\nHow To Freeze Cinnamon Swirl Bundt Cake If you can, freeze the cinnamon swirl bundt cake without the glaze. (You can add the glaze when you’re ready to serve.) After the cake has cooled completely, wrap it in plastic wrap. Then wrap it in aluminum foil for extra protection. The cake will stay good in the freezer for 2-3 months. When you’re ready to eat it, take the cake out of the freezer and let it thaw in the refrigerator for a few hours or overnight. Thawing in the fridge helps keep the cake’s texture and flavor. Once it’s thawed, add the glaze. Make sure the cake is at room temperature or a little chilled before adding the glaze.\nCinnamon Swirl Bundt Cake Prep Time 15 minutes mins Cook Time 1 hour hr 15 minutes mins Total Time 1 hour hr 30 minutes mins This Cinnamon Swirl Bundt Cake is my classic and–dare I say–perfect cream cheese pound cake with a cinnamon-sugar layer in the center and a sweet glaze drizzled on top.

Print Rate Comment Ingredients ▢ 1 package (8 ounces) cream cheese, room temperature ▢ 1 ¼ cups (2 ½ sticks / 284 g) salted butter, room temperature ▢ 3 cups (600 g) granulated sugar ▢ 6 large eggs, room temperature ▢ 2 teaspoons vanilla extract ▢ 3 cups (375 g) cake flour ▢ ¼ cup (60 g) buttermilk, room temperature Filling ▢ ¼ cup (50 g) light brown sugar, packed ▢ 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon Topping ▢ 1 cup (120 g) confectioners' sugar ▢ 2-3 tablespoons whole milk Instructions Preheat oven to 325°F. Spray a 10-inch bundt pan with non-stick spray. Set aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the cream cheese and butter, mixing on medium speed until smooth, about 3 minutes. Gradually add the granulated sugar. Continue mixing until the mixture is light and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Then add the vanilla extract. With the mixer on low speed, gradually add the cake flour, mixing until just combined. Remove the bowl from the mixer and pour in the buttermilk. Use a rubber spatula to fold the buttermilk into the batter gently, scraping down the sides and bottom of the bowl to incorporate all ingredients. Pour half of the batter into the prepared bundt pan, spreading it evenly. In a small bowl, combine the light brown sugar and cinnamon. Sprinkle this mixture evenly over the batter in the pan. Carefully pour the remaining batter over the cinnamon mixture, spreading it to cover as much of the cinnamon layer as possible. Bake for 75-80 minutes, checking for doneness at 1 hour. The cake is done when a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few crumbs but no wet batter. The crust should be a dark golden brown around the edges and lighter in the center. Allow the cake to cool to room temperature in the pan, then invert it onto a serving plate. Topping In a medium bowl, whisk together the confectioners’ sugar, whole milk, and vanilla extract until smooth and pourable. Adjust the milk if needed to reach a drizzle consistency. Drizzle the glaze over the cooled cake, allowing it to run down the sides.

    "text": "[6 things you may not know about End of Heat](/a/202408/22/WS6122e4b6a310efa1bd66a589.html) Ukraine launches drone attacks on Moscow By REN QI IN MOSCOW | chinadaily.com.cn | Updated: 2024-08-22 21:03 Ukraine attacked Moscow on Wednesday with at least 11 drones that were shot down by air defenses in what Russian officials called one of the biggest drone strikes on the capital since its special military operation in Ukraine began in February 2022. The conflict, largely a grinding artillery and drone battle across the fields, forests and villages of eastern Ukraine, escalated on August 6 when Ukraine sent thousands of soldiers over the border into Russia's western Kursk region. For months, Ukraine has also fought an increasingly damaging drone war against the refineries and airfields of Russia, the world's second largest oil exporter, though major drone attacks on the Moscow region - with a population of over 21 million - have been rarer. Russia's defense ministry said its air defenses destroyed a total of 45 drones over Russian territory, including 11 over the Moscow region, 23 over the border region of Bryansk, six over the Belgorod region, three over the Kaluga region and two over the Kursk region. Some of the drones were shot down over the city of Podolsk, Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin said. The city, located in the Moscow region, is some 38 km south of the Kremlin. \"This is one of the largest attempts to attack Moscow using drones ever,\" Sobyanin said on the Telegram messaging app in the early hours of Wednesday. \"The layered defense of Moscow that was created made it possible to successfully repel all the attacks from the enemy UAVs.\" Along Moscow's boulevards, cafes, restaurants and shops of the capital - which has been carefully insulated from the conflict - were crowded with little signs of concern. Moscow's airports, Vnukovo, Domodedovo and Zhukovsky, limited flights for four hours but restarted normal operations early in the morning, Russia's aviation watchdog said. Sobyanin said that according to preliminary information, there were no injuries or damage reported in the aftermath of the attacks. There were also no casualties or damage reported following the attack on Bryansk in Russia's southwest, the governor of the region, Alexander Bogomaz, wrote on Telegram. Ukrainian military's General Staff said in a statement that it struck an S-300 anti-aircraft missile system based in Russia's southern Rostov region overnight. Rostov governor Vasily Golubev said air defense forces had destroyed a Ukraine-launched missile over his region, but Russia's defense ministry made no mention of the incident in its daily statement on destroyed air weapons. In Russia's north Murmansk region, local authorities issued a drone attack warning on Wednesday, as local airports imposed flight restrictions following unverified reports of an unmanned aircraft being shot down. Shortly before the announcement, civil aviation authorities introduced flight restrictions at airports in the regional capital, Murmansk, and the town of Apatity. No drone attacks have previously been reported in the Murmansk region before. If confirmed, Wednesday's reported drone downing would mark the furthest a Ukrainian drone has flown into Russian territory. Russia meanwhile is advancing in eastern Ukraine, where it controls about 18 percent of the territory, and battling to repel Ukraine's incursion into the Kursk region, the biggest foreign attack on Russian territory since World War II. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Wednesday Ukraine had not consulted Berlin about its August 6 shock incursion into Russia and that he expected that military operation to be limited in time and territory. \"Ukraine has prepared its military operation in the Kursk region very secretly and without feedback, which is certainly due to the situation,\" Scholz said. \"This is a very limited operation in terms of space and probably also in terms of time.\" Separately, Scholz said Germany would continue to be what he said was Ukraine's biggest supporter in Europe after controversy in recent days over what some have called wavering German support for Kyiv over domestic politicking.",

    "title": "Una ONG denuncia la muerte de 14 personas en una zódiac al sur de Canarias",
    "text": "Al menos catorce personas han muerto ahogadas en una zódiac cuyos ocupantes llevan pidiendo auxilio desde las 14.00 horas de este jueves desde un punto del Atlántico situado a unos 55 kilómetros de Cabo Bojador, en la costa marroquí del Sáhara Occidental, al sur de\n[Canarias](/tags/islas-canarias/), porque su barca se desinfla y se hunden.\nEs la denuncia que realiza la activista Helena Maleno, fundadora de Caminando Fronteras, ONG que lleva toda la tarde de este jueves en contacto con los náufragos y que ha transmitido su posición a las autoridades españolas y marroquíes para que movilicen medios de rescate. Por la localización del incidente, ha asumido la emergencia Rabat.\nMaleno ha facilitado a EFE una foto enviada por los supervivientes que todavía siguen a flote, una imagen nocturna y borrosa en la que se ve a entre seis y siete personas sentadas a horcajadas sobre un flotador de una neumática, doblado y medio deshinchado.\nY también un audio que le ha remitido una de las ocupantes de la patera. En él se escucha a una mujer decir en francés: \"Estamos aquí, Helena. Soy una mujer embarazada de nueve meses, estoy en el flotador (de la zódiac). Todos los chicos del medio (de la embarcación) han desaparecido, la gente está desapareciendo, hasta ahora no hemos visto a la Marina\".\n\"Toda la gente está desapareciendo. ¡Por favor ayúdennos, ayúdennos! ¡Estamos aquí, ayúdennos! Estamos sentados así en el flotador (se refiere a la imagen que adjunta con el audio). Es muy peligroso, el agua está entrando\", se lamenta la mujer\nHelena Maleno ha explicado a EFE que, según la información que han recabado sobre esa neumática, se trata de un grupo de 58 personas que salieron el miércoles desde la costa del Sahara hacia Canarias y que ahora se encuentran al suroeste de Cabo Bojador.\nEntre ellos, añade, hay siete mujeres (incluyendo a la embarazada) y dos niños.\nLa portavoz de Caminando Fronteras denuncia que, hasta el momento, Marruecos no ha hecho llegar ayuda a los ocupantes de esa neumática, ni tampoco Salvamento Marítimo español ha intervenido.\nPor eso, expresa su temor a que ocurra lo mismo que el 21 de junio, cuando varias personas murieron al hundirse una zódiac al sur de Gran Canaria después de pasar toda la noche esperando a que llegara una patrullera de Marruecos, porque la emergencia la había asumido el Centro de Coordinación de Salvamento de Rabat.\nY ello, a pesar de que un barco de rescate español había estado a solo una hora de distancia de navegación de ellos, socorriendo a otra patera, cuando ya se conocían sus coordenadas.\nEse suceso dio lugar una denuncia de la Fiscalía de Canarias por presunto delito de omisión del deber de socorro contra los responsables del operativo en España, denuncia que desde este verano instruye un Juzgado de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, que ha declarado secretas las actuaciones.",
