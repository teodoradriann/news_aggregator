    "title": "Farrier hails ‘incredible’ 2023 after horseshoes captivate millions on TikTok | This Is Local London",
    "text": "A farrier whose horseshoe videos have attracted celebrity endorsement and made him one of the UK’s most viewed TikTokers for a third year running has hailed 2023 as “incredible”. Sam Dracott, who smiths shoes for horses and treats infected hooves, appeared in the top 10 most-viewed TikTok videos in 2021 then was the UK’s number one most-viewed account of 2022 – and has now followed up the feat as the UK’s second-most viewed TikToker in 2023. The 34-year-old, from Weybridge, Surrey, boasts more than four million followers and more than 59.5 million likes – second only to Tool Tips which went viral for its staple creation – and said his success provides “huge recognition” for his often misunderstood job. “To be in the top 10 TikTok list once was incredible, twice was unbelievable and this third win three years in a row is just absolutely unreal,” the farrier told the PA news agency. “I can’t get over how the content continues to fascinate and inspire others. “It shows me huge recognition for everything we do and, that finally, it is becoming understood! “So many people have told me they are now considering a career becoming a farrier and that is something really special.” Mr Dracott’s videos, which have become a source of satisfaction for TikTok users, show how he changes horseshoes, removes debris, shaves down hooves and treats infections. His content even caught the attention of celebrities this year – including American singer Jason Derulo. “It’s been an incredible year… I got a message (from Jason Derulo) saying ‘I love your content, am I able to post it on my channel because I can’t stop watching it?’,” the TikToker said. “To have an international star tagging and seeing your videos, it’s a great feeling. It’s unbelievable.” Mr Dracott called his time working alongside broadcaster Alan Titchmarsh a career highlight and “a great experience” after he appeared on the gardener’s Love Your Weekend programme on ITV to showcase farriery. Mr Dracott posted his first video in April 2021 on the short-form app, which he said “exploded” after it was viewed by millions within four hours and earned him one million followers in one month. He was inspired to post footage of his day-to-day work after constantly being quizzed about his job but said it is rewarding to educate people about his profession. “It’s very rewarding,” he said. “When you’re in the equestrian world, you see it day in and day out so you don’t really think about it. “As soon as I posted the first video, it actually just blew up.” He added his job “sounds simple” but takes “years of practice” to master. “It’s an art that most people think has been lost, but it’s still there, still strong and there’s a lot more educational side to it – more than people think,” he said. “It’s a great feeling to educate people on that.” Mr Dracott’s main challenge as a content creator is debunking myths about the horses’ welfare as users often question if farriery hurts the animals. “A lot of people think horses don’t like having this or it hurts, but as farriers as our jobs, we’re increasing the horse’s working life and welfare, so we’re only there to help the animals,” he explained. He aims to use his platform to raise the profile of farriers in the UK to an international audience. “I’m trying to get people to realise that in the UK, farriers are training to such a high level compared to the rest of the world,” he said. “I’m trying to expose how highly qualified we are so it will be nice to do some international stuff.” The viral farrier described TikTok as a platform to help people “relieve a bit of stress” and urged creators to use the app for “good reasons”. He explained: “I think TikTok, used in the right way, is a fantastic way of educating and escaping reality. “Life’s quite stressful and it’s a nice way to escape and learn about how other people live and what they do. It’s exposing different angles and certain styles of living in, hopefully, a good way. “Keep trying to use the platform for good reasons rather than trying to expose it.” Comments: Our rules We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

    "title": "Jack Nicklaus still earning roars ahead of Hoag Classic in Newport Beach - Orange County Register",
    "text": "NEWPORT BEACH – Jack Nicklaus, arguably the greatest golfer of all time, knows how to make a ballroom full of avid golfers — weekend hackers and country club members alike — feel better about their game.\nAs the featured speaker at the annual Hoag Classic community breakfast on Tuesday at Balboa Bay Club, Nicklaus casually mentioned the state of his golf game these days. The winner of a record 18 major championships and 120 tournaments around the world said he has played one round this year. Keep in mind that he turned 85 in January.“I played in the father-son (event) at The Bear’s Club, because my grandkids wanted to play,” Nicklaus said, referring to his family’s exclusive private club that he designed in Jupiter, Fla., not far from his longtime home in West Palm Beach. “So, they gave me a 14 handicap, and I shot 91. That’s about what I shoot.”There you go. Feel better now?There’s more. At a charity fundraiser called “The Jake” that was named after a 17-month-old grandson he lost in a drowning accident years ago, Nicklaus “came out of retirement” last winter to auction off a round of golf with him “at a golf course of my choice.”To make a long story short, the bidding started at $500,000, and Nicklaus eventually agreed to play with three groups at $700,000 apiece.“The course of my choice ended up being Augusta (National),” Nicklaus revealed, “so I took these three groups to Augusta, three days in a row in April last year (after The Masters). I shot 88, 90 and 91 – that’s my game now. And you know what? I never hit an iron to (reach) a par-3, par-4 or par-5; that’s how far I hit it now.“Anyway, I had a great time, and we raised a lot of money for our foundation – about $4.8 million for one event. Pretty good. I’m proud of that.”That elicited one of many thunderous ovations from the audience of 500 who shelled out $5,000 for a table to hear “The Golden Bear” tell stories, this time benefiting the Hoag Orthopedic Institute. And Nicklaus clearly loves hospital charities, because he and his wife Barbara have raised more than $200 million for the Nicklaus Children’s Health Care Foundation over the past 20 years.Nicklaus seems to enjoy reciting those numbers even more than the numbers that have made him one of the most famous athletes in sports history and earned him Sports Illustrated’s distinction as the “Individual Male Athlete of the 20th Century” and one of the “10 Greatest Athletes of the Century” by ESPN.Perhaps that helps explain why he also received a standing ovation Tuesday when he announced, midway through his Q&A: “I’m embarrassed, but I need to use the little boys room. Give me two minutes, and I’ll be right back.” (This also led to a ballroom stampede by dozens who felt a similar urge, or merely wanted to emulate Nicklaus.)Upon his return, Nicklaus did tell a few golf stories to entertain the audience, and suffice to say he has a zero handicap when remembering the details of tournaments he played in 60 years ago. He remembered his first check as a professional, the season-opening 1962 LA Open at Rancho Park. “Hauled in a big check of $333.33 for tying for 50th place,” he quipped, adding that he made $440 at Torrey Pines, $330 at Pebble Beach, $256 at Palm Springs and $3,200 for second place in Phoenix.The 1962 Phoenix Open also was memorable to him, because he played in the last group with Arnold Palmer, then the world’s most popular and successful pro golfer and 10 years older than Jack. “We walked off the 17th green, and Arnie says, ‘If you birdie the last hole, you can finish second, if you play it smart. That was a really nice gesture. So, I birdied the last hole and finished second – and he won by 12 shots!”Later that year, in his 17th pro tournament, Nicklaus won his first of 73 PGA Tour titles, beating Palmer in an 18-hole playoff to win the U.S. Open at Oakmont Country Club in Pennsylvania, essentially in Arnie’s backyard, where everyone was loudly cheering for Palmer and against Nicklaus.“I didn’t mind it; I was a young kid with blinders on,” Nicklaus recalled. “I didn’t hear anything.” That, however, was not the case in the gallery, where fiery Ohio State football coach Woody Hayes was walking with Jack’s father. “My dad had to restrain Woody,” Nicklaus added, smirking.Naturally, the conversation eventually turned to Nicklaus’ victory for the ages — or was it for the aged? — at the 1986 Masters, where he won the last of his 18 majors at age 46. All the details are still fresh in his mind, hole by hole, shot by shot. He shot 74 in the first round, 71 in the second round, 69 in the third round.“Sunday morning, I looked at the leaderboard, and I was four shots behind with eight guys ahead of me,” he recalled. When his son, Steve, called that day, he asked, “Pops, what do you think it will take today?” Jack answered: “I think 66 will tie; 65 will win.”But Nicklaus, in his own words, said, “I screwed up the front nine,” missing two short putts and treading water at even par through eight holes.As he lined up a birdie putt on No. 9, a roar from behind him, at the eighth green, startled him. Then came another roar. Turned out, Seve Ballesteros and Tom Kite had both holed third-shot pitch shots for eagle.“I knew what had happened,” Nicklaus recalled Tuesday. “I turned to the gallery and said, ‘They made some noise; let’s see if we can make some noise here. I made the birdie putt, and the crowd loved it.”But Nicklaus didn’t think he had a chance at that point. “It made me 1-under – 9,000 shots behind,” he said.But that was before he played the back nine in 6-under: birdie at No. 10, birdie at No.11, bogey at No. 12, birdie at No. 13, eagle at No. 15, birdie at No. 16, birdie at 17 en route to a record-tying back-nine 30 and 7-under 65, to finish at 9-under for the tournament. He recited his shots and distances on every hole.Then he went to Butler Cabin, plopped down on the couch and watched as Kite missed a birdie putt on No. 18 and and Greg Norman bogied No. 18 after making five birdies in a row. Nicklaus was a Masters champion again – after the greatest comeback of his career.“I gave my son a hug,” he said, referring to his caddie Jackie. “That’s what I remember most.”Another ovation in the ballroom. Jack Nicklaus is still a closer, at age 85, even if he doesn’t shoot his age.",

    "text": "[Juegos Paralímpicos](/temas/juegos-paralimpicos) Así queda el medallero latinoamericano tras nuevo oro histórico de Colombia en uno de los deportes más llamativos de los Juegos Paralímpicos Colombia sigue sumando oros en los Juegos Paralímpicos, en la jornada de este jueves consiguió un nuevo metal dorado gracias a la boccia, un deporte en el que la delegación cafetera nunca había conseguido medalla en unas justas. La pareja de hermanos, Edilson y Leydi Chica consiguieron un triunfo histórico en la modalidad de dobles mixto y se colgaron una nueva medalla de oro para Colombia y la segunda individual. Cabe recordar que ambos deportistas ya habían conseguido en días pasados medallas de oro y plata. Leydi se llevó el metal dorado y su hermano la plata en la modalidad individual BC4. Este triunfo significa mucho para el deporte colombiano dado que nunca en la historia, la delegación colombiana había conseguido metales en esta disciplina. Cabe resaltar que este deporte consiste en ubicar la mayor cantidad de bolas cerca de una blanca. Este deporte es practicado a nivel mundial por deportistas en silla de ruedas con lesión cerebral o discapacidad física severa, como distrofia muscular. De esa manera, Colombia consigue su mejor participación en la historia de los Juegos Paralímpicos tras conseguir cinco medallas de oro y superar así las tres obtenidas en Tokio 2020. Colombia acumula 20 medallas en total, de las cuales cinco son de oro, seis de plata y nueve de bronce. Así va la tabla de medallas latinoamericana en los Juegos Paralímpicos - Brasil (15 oros, 18 platas y 29 bronces) - Colombia (5 oros, 6 platas, 9 bronces) - México (3 oro, 3 platas, 5 bronces) - Venezuela (2 oro, 1 plata, 1 bronce) - Argentina (2 oro, 7 bronces) - Ecuador (1 oro, 2 bronce) - Costa Rica (1 oro) - Perú (1 oro) - Cuba (1 plata) - Chile (3 bronces)",

    "text": "Estudio señala que algunos somníferos interrumpen la limpieza del cerebro y podrían aumentar el riesgo de alzhéimer\npor a publicado:\nAlgunos somníferos alteran el sistema de limpieza del cerebro durante el sueño, lo que podría afectar la función cognitiva a largo plazo y favorecer la aparición de enfermedades neurodegenerativas como el alzhéimer.\nEs una de las advertencias que realizan los autores de una investigación publicada este miércoles en la revista Cell, en la que se describe por primera vez con gran detalle en ratones el mecanismo por el que el cerebro elimina los desechos mientras dormimos y se libra de proteínas cuya acumulación puede ser dañina a largo plazo.\nEs una de las advertencias que realizan los autores de una investigación publicada este miércoles en la revista Cell, en la que se describe por primera vez con gran detalle en ratones el mecanismo por el que el cerebro elimina los desechos mientras dormimos y se libra de proteínas cuya acumulación puede ser dañina a largo plazo.\n|\n#1\"cortan el oxígeno celular\"\n¿Mande? Creo que confundes conceptos.\nLas benzos actúan sobre los receptores GABA e interactúan también modulando el estrés oxidativo celular, no \"cortándoles el oxígeno\".\n#8El zolpidem es una pseudobenzodiazepina pero no es lo mismo.\nDe todas formas, aunque me duermo en el pincho de una pita, cuando necesito algo suelo recurrir a los antihistamínicos tipo hidroxina que, en mi cuñada opinión, creo que producen menos tolerancia y adicción.\n#12hidroxizina*\nCon eso te vas durmiendo por todas las esquinas durante todo el día. Yo lo estuve tomando un tiempo y casi me caigo en la bañera...\n#21Si, hablaba de cabeza, pero ese es el nombre del moléculo\n#12Si lo que quieres es quedarte dormido es mejor tomar melantonina, pero solo sirve para quedarse, no para dormir toda la noche.\n#16Yo no la he probado. No tengo problemas para dormir pero cuando me meto más de diez horas en un avión y no me da el presupuesto para business, opto por algo más fuerte.\n#17La teoría dice que tu cuerpo a ciertas horas libera melantonina para empezar el sueño, si te cuesta conciliar el sueño tomar melantonina ayuda a dar ese paso, pero claro, el insomnio es algo muy complejo.\nComo ya he dicho varias veces, soy extrabajador del mar, los cambios de ritmo de estar de guardia 6 horas y dormir 3, volver a estar 6 horas, y dormir 5 durante meses y luego al llegar a casa y dormir toda la noche es jodido.\nLos primeros días me despertaba después de 3 horas de sueño y luego a media tarde estaba muerto, lógicamente.\nA mi me ayudó a las transiciones, aunque he de decir que yo puedo dormir hasta de pie en un barco con balance...\n#22yo estoy tomando ahora 4mg de melatonina y medio diazepam. No dormía tan bien desde hace 20 años pero llevo dos días fatal otra vez.. Al final no sabes si es por las pirulas por lo que duermes o daría igual no tomarlas.\n#2¿Hay estudios que digan algo parecido de los porros? Es para una amiga\n#1Zolpiden es un análogo de las benzo, como tú dices, pero no una benzo en sí.\nLo que pasa es que hay numerosos estudios que demuestran que dormir poco aumenta mucho el riesgo de demencia.\nEntonces tendríamos que saber si, respecto a dormir poco, tomando el somnífero el riesgo de demencia es mayor o menor que sin hacerlo y durmiendo poco.\nPorque el estudio me compara dos cosas absurdas. Quién toma somníferos, con la población que no los toma que normalmente no tiene problemas de sueño. Y esa comparación es incorrecta.\nEntonces tendríamos que saber si, respecto a dormir poco, tomando el somnífero el riesgo de demencia es mayor o menor que sin hacerlo y durmiendo poco.\nPorque el estudio me compara dos cosas absurdas. Quién toma somníferos, con la población que no los toma que normalmente no tiene problemas de sueño. Y esa comparación es incorrecta.\n#6Totalmente de acuerdo. Ya hay estudios anteriores que muestran que quienes toman somníferos tienen más riesgo de demencia, pero eso no significa que si no los tomaran su riesgo disminuiría.\nTambién se debería ver el riesgo de distintos tratamientos comparados entre sí. Si se demuestra que este medicamento en concreto presenta más riesgos que otros, lo ideal sería que no fuera de primera elección en casos de insomnio.\nCC\n#7\n#10el Ambien o Zolpiden ni siquiera creo que se prescriba en España. Pero sí me llama la atención del estudio que \"sólo\" midan ese somnífero y no los más comunes\nHace tiempo que existen estudios que demuestran que las benzodiazepinas aumentan el riesgo de Alzheimer, el problema es que no dormir también aumenta el riesgo de padecer un montón de enfermedades. Yo cuando me tomo un somnífero (y consigo dormir, que no es siempre) me levanto descansado, pero cuando no duermo estoy que me muero, así que elijo tomar somníferos. Lo que no hay que hacer es tomarlos diariamente porque entonces si que la cagarás de lo lindo.\n#7Aquí uno que lleva mucho con zolpiden y diazepan, y eso pq conseguí que me quitaran todo lo demás. Será malo, pero entre dormir 6-7h con suerte y no dormir nada pues me quedo con lo primero.\n#9es que totalmente.\nYo el Zolpidem no lo he probado, pero de las benzos he probado Diazepam, trankimazin, lexatin, noctamid, sedotime… me he quedado con lexatin que es la que mejor me sienta y más descansado me deja.\n#13\n#34\n#27Mi primo tenía una entrevista de trabajo y estaba muy nervioso, así que se tomó dos pastillas de Orfidal. De camino a las oficinas se quedó dormido y tuvo un accidente de coche, se salió de la carretera y acabó en la acequia. Cuando llegó la policía le hicieron el test de alcoholemia porque creían que iba borracho.\n#13sabes si ese es su nombre comercial? Es que con el nombre de las benzos me pierdo un poco, siempre me guío mejor por su nombre comercial.\n#23\nComo dijo\n#27un nombre comercial común del Lorazepam es \"Orfidal\" y otro es \"Ativan\". El nombre Orfidal al parecer era el común desde los años 90 en España... pero hoy en día es bastante habitual que se recete y se venda con su nombre científico, como genérico Lorazepam, del laboratorio que sea.\nCc:\n#29\n#29tengo entendido, pero mejor te lo diría un medico, que el Orfidal es bastante cañero, ya que es relajante muscular también. De los que hemos ido nombrando, el Lexatin de 1,5 es el más suave.\n#34Todas ls benzodiazepinas tienen 3 efectos:\n1. Hipnótico\n2. Ansiolítico\n3. Relajante muscular\nEl efecto de cada una de ellas puede variar en ese sentido:\n- Orfidal (lorazepam) 1-2mg: Hipnótico y ansiolítico, no se usa como relajante muscular.\n- Lormetazepam 2mg: fundamentalmente hipnótico.\n- Valium (diazepam): los tres efectos por igual, es el que más se usa como relajante muscular. Vida media larga.\n- Alprazolam: fundamentalmente ansiolítico, habitual en quienes requieren una BZD más…\n[» ver todo el comentario](javascript:get_votes('get_comment.php','comment','cid-42130254',0,42130254))\n#37gracias por comentar con conocimiento y así conseguir que deje de hacer el cuñao\nDesde tu punto de vista de medico, piensas que los pros de las benzodiazepinas superan los contras?\n#41Depende. Las BZD tienen muchos pro para controlar síntomas y a veces son indirectamente preventivos.\nPor ejemplo, si un paciente con cardiopatía isquémica ingresa con una angina inestable o con un infarto te dice que está muy nervioso y no puede dormir, le pongo la BZD sin dudarlo ya que el insomnio les puede generar una descarga de catecolaminas que haga progresar una isquemia (un infarto).\nSi un paciente sé que no tiene ese riesgo y se pone muy insistente diciéndote que quiere \"la…\n[» ver todo el comentario](javascript:get_votes('get_comment.php','comment','cid-42131067',0,42131067))\n#13Pues otra benzo. Es cuestión de que lo pruebes. Yo lo pongo en rachas y una dosis muy baja: 1/6.\n#13El lorazepam, vendido bajo el nombre comercial Orfidal o Ativan...\nPor si los conoces por nombre comercial.\nDejan \"kao\" pero en algunos casos no despiertas hasta el café.\nPrueba melantonina. Es diferente, funciona de otra forma.\n#9Bueno, con la Ley de Autonomía del Paciente en la mano, tú puedes negarte a cualquier tratamiento (y además, tienes derecho a ser informado, en términos comprensibles, para que des tu consentimiento o no). No hace falta \"suplicar a la autoridad\" para que \"te quiten\" algo; más bien es cuestión de estar informado y tener una relación más o menos \"horizontal\" con los médicos a los que consultes.\nLos tiempos de la medicina paternalista ya pasaron...\n#9Yo probaría con los antihistamínicos, una pastilla entera de atarax me deja ko un montonazo de horas así que en caso de necesidad (la clase business de los pobres) me tomo media o una si el viaje es muy largo.\n#14En un par de semanas de uso continuado desarrollaría tolerancia y le dejaría de hacer efecto. Además, los antihistamínicos de primera generación (como el que mencionas) solo están indicados para casos específicos.\n#15\nRespuesta breve:\nEl cuerpo humano es muy complejo y no se sabe todo (todavía).\nMás detalles:\n1. Hay muchos fármacos.\nEs posible que unos afecten (al 100% de personas) y otros no (a nadie).\nLo que tomó tu abuela puede ser de los que NO afecten...\nEl meneo este habla del somnífero \"zolpidem\" y el titular dice \"algunos fármacos\" (no todos)... y\n#7menciona \"benzodiazepinas\" que es un grupo amplio de somníferos...\nPero ni todos los somníferos…\n[» ver todo el comentario](javascript:get_votes('get_comment.php','comment','cid-42129732',0,42129732))\n#15ya no se hacen las cosas como antaño.\n#15Si. La noticia habla del riesgo. El riesgo no te permite saber si una persona va a tener o no el problema. Pero si te permite saber que en un grupo de personas va a aumentar el problema.\nEstá explicación es de enseñanza básica y fundamental para entender muchas cosas del mundo.\n#15Siempre ha dormido bien. Eso es un plus.\n#15que done su cuerpo a la ciencia.\nAhora en serio como ya te han comentado, cada persona es un mundo. Santiago Carrillo era conocido entre otras cosas por ser un político que entre otras cosas estaba todo el dia fumando, y llegó relativamente bien a los 97 años. Creo que no tuvo cancer en su vida.\n#15Ni todos los que fuman desde los 14 acaban con cáncer, EPOC o infarto. La ciencia no funciona así, en resumen, parece un factor de riesgo, aumenta las probabilidades de padecer la enfermedad.\nEl problema es nuestro ritmo de vida.\nMi mujer se levanta antes de las 4 para entrar a currar a las 5.\nTeniendo un niño pequeño podemos acostarle relativamente temprano pero no lo suficiente como para dormir 8 horas y que ella se levante como una rosa por lo que ha recurrido alguna vez a la melatonina, que supongo no tiene el efecto de los medicamentos que menciona el artículo pero ... A lo que voy, es insano levantarse tan temprano, el cuerpo se resiente a lo largo del tiempo y el cerebro no puede completar su limpieza igual que quien se levanta a las 7.\nMi mujer se levanta antes de las 4 para entrar a currar a las 5.\nTeniendo un niño pequeño podemos acostarle relativamente temprano pero no lo suficiente como para dormir 8 horas y que ella se levante como una rosa por lo que ha recurrido alguna vez a la melatonina, que supongo no tiene el efecto de los medicamentos que menciona el artículo pero ...
