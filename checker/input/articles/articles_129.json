    "text": "Getty Images Weston McKennie's revival at Juventus has gone so well that he's the highest-rated player of the season so far for the Turin club, per TuttoSport . The Italian outlet have published all the ratings for each game of the season so far, and USMNT star Weston McKennie was the player with the highest number among the Bianconeri players.\nGolazo Starting XI Newsletter Get your Soccer Fix from Around the Globe Your ultimate guide to the Beautiful Game as our experts take you beyond the pitch and around the globe with news that matters.\nI agree to receive the \"Golazo Starting XI Newsletter\" and marketing communications, updates, special offers (including partner offers), and other information from CBS Sports and the Paramount family of companies.

From one to ten, McKennie ranked first with a 6.44 ahead of goalkeeper Wojciech Szczęsny (6.32).\n\"In the summer, he was on the market, now he is untouchable. He convinced [Massimo] Allegri with the work starting with the tour in United States. As a midfielder or full back, he played in all 17 matches,\" the review said.\nIn fact, McKennie played all the games with the Bianconeri this season in multiple positions. He started as a right winger in the 3-5-2 but also played as midfielder since Paul Pogba and Nicolò Fagioli were suspended and forced coach Massimiliano Allegri to bring McKennie back in the midfield.\nMcKennie, always with a flair of comedy, spoke about helping change the belief in American soccer players abroad on the podcast of his teammate Moise Kean .\n\"I've been in Italy for three and a half years. I suffered the cultural shock, yes,\" McKennie said.\n\"In Italy, the mentality is closed, it's tradition. That's fine, but you need to be more open-minded with others. An example? I eat pasta with tomato, pesto with chicken. All of [the people] in Italy [think], 'How disgusting!' But they have never tried it. I like that we have more Americans now playing here because everyone thinks we play football, basketball and so on ... Since I arrived, everyone thought, 'But he's American and he can't play football.' Now there is [Christian] Pulisic, [Yunus] Musah, [Gianluca] Busio, [Tim] Weah ... Everyone thinks in Italy Americans can play football.\"\nIt seemed like the story between Juventus and McKennie ended last season when he was loaned six months to Leeds United, but the player went back to Turin after the English side was relegated. In the summer of 2023, the USMNT star worked hard to be back in the plans of Allegri, who started to play him as a winger, rotating with another UMSNT player, Weah. After a few games, McKennie gained a starting role in that position, but then shifted to his original role after both Pogba and Fagioli were suspended for the rest of the season.\nMcKennie is now key for Allegri, who can use him in multiple positions of the pitch. He has yet to score his first goal of the season but provided two assists, including one in the last away game against Frosinone. Despite the initial doubts and the criticism, McKennie deserved to be back in the starting 11 of Juventus and as TuttoSport showed, his performances were crucial for the team coached by Allegri this season. He demonstrated that things can quickly change in the world of football since a few months ago he was transfer listed and now he's critical.\n Osimhen extends deal to '26 with $140 million release Francesco Porzio • 1 min read Where Juventus and Italy legend Chiellini retires from soccer Francesco Porzio • 3 min read Watch Now: How McKennie rebounded at Juventus Francesco Porzio 2 min read WATCH: Pulisic scores winner for Milan Chuck Booth 1 min read Sommer Rudi Fagioli Tonali ",

    "title": "Employee Q&A: Biodiversity Around Our Asan, South Korea Plant",
    "text": "( MENAFN - 3BL) Our people making a difference is a series featured throughout Owens Corning's 2023 Sustainability Report .\nWith approximately 30 years' experience at Owens Corning, SD Kim has an in-depth understanding of our operations in general and our Asan, South Korea, Roofing plant in particular. His expertise has been instrumental as we have sought to increase our positive impacts throughout the region, including our work to protect biodiversity around the plant. SD became especially interested in this topic after reviewing data provided by the Wildlife Habitat Council in 2022, and he has been actively involved in several projects that take concrete action toward our biodiversity aspirations.\nOn the importance of protecting biodiversity\nWhen the Earth's natural ecosystems maintain relationships with each other and achieve balance based on biodiversity, everything can flow more naturally. Protecting biodiversity is important globally as we work toward meeting the needs of today's generations while preserving our world for future generations.\nThis goes beyond environmental issues - it relates to social ethics and morality as well as the sustainability and self-preservation of humanity. Efforts that preserve biodiversity are essential for companies and are valuable in terms of conserving nature and ensuring coexistence between humans and the planet. Therefore, we believe that sustainable management is critical for all companies that develop resources and utilize them for business.\nOn the initiatives underway at the Asan plant\nI have shared the importance of protecting biodiversity with plant employees, and it has become part of our sustainability efforts. We have initiated several projects to protect birds, including the installation of film on office windows, which prevents collision. We also adjusted the angle of the streetlights so as not to obstruct the view of migrating birds.\nIn 2024, we will install birdhouses and noise reduction equipment. We are actively working on improving internal plant processes for reducing waste scrap and achieving zero waste-to-landfill using the Focused Improvement pillar of Total Productive Maintenance. In addition, we are installing solar panels on our roof in 2024, and we have targets to reduce energy intensity within the plant. Earth has a finite number of resources, and once they are gone, they cannot be used again. Therefore, we must take responsibility for sustainability and constantly think about it.\nOn tying biodiversity to the overall Owens Corning sustainability mission\nRecently, interest in the environment, ecosystems, and animal welfare appears to be increasing, and people recognize a need for consumption to be more sustainable and ethical. Improving the environment has now become a necessity rather than an option. I believe that sustainability is not only my responsibility, but also the responsibility of Owens Corning. As a company, we are making great efforts in manufacturing with the recycling of waste across all our businesses, as well as energy reduction, developing environment-friendly products, and supporting communities. I feel these are all definitely connected to protecting biodiversity around the world.\nMENAFN18072024007202015466ID1108457445",

Marta Rovira ha entrado ya en Cataluña desde la frontera francesa que da acceso a La Jonquera (Girona) tras más de seis años residiendo en Suiza huida de la justicia española por el procés, así como el diputado Rubén Wagensberg; el vicepresidente primero de Òmnium Cultural, Oleguer Serra; el empresario Josep Campmajó y el periodista Jesús Rodríguez. \"Con exiliados, encarcelados y perseguidos no se puede hacer política en igualdad de condiciones. Esto afecta a la democracia, y mientras dure la represión política no existirá ninguna normalidad posible\", ha añadido Puigdemont en X. El expresidente de la Generalitat, que se encuentra en Bruselas (Bélgica) desde otoño de 2017, todavía no puede regresar a Cataluña con garantías de no ser detenido después de que el Tribunal Supremo haya decidido no aplicarle la ley de amnistía, si bien ha asegurado que estará presente en el primer debate de investidura que se celebre en el Parlament. A pesar del regreso de Rovira, Puigdemont considera que el independentismo todavía está \"lejos\" de tener \"las condiciones que permitan hacer política con normalidad\". \"Que de alguna manera podáis recuperar los años y los meses que os han robado, y que nos pongamos a trabajar lo más rápido posible. Porque hay mucho trabajo pendiente\", ha expresado. Envía tu noticia a: [participa@andaluciainformacion.es](mailto:participa@andaluciainformacion.es)",

    "text": "By Chinelo Obogo\n The National Association of Aircraft Pilots and Engineers (NAAPE) has appealed to the Minister of Aviation and Aerospace Development, Festus Keyamo, to intervene in the ongoing labour dispute involving Dana Air. The union is concerned about the airline’s failure to pay outstanding salaries and allowances to its former employees. In a communiqué issued following its recent National Executive Council meeting and symposium in Abuja, NAAPE President, Abednego Galadima urged all employers in the aviation sector, including the government and airlines, to prioritise the well-being of their workers. He emphasised the vital role of aviation in the nation’s economy and the need for improved working conditions. Dana Air was grounded by the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) in April due to safety concerns. Subsequently, the airline laid off over 1,000 employees, including permanent staff and expatriates. Reports indicate that many of these former employees have yet to receive their pensions, despite deductions being made, dating back to the tragic 2012 crash. Additionally, the airline has been unable to refund ticket costs to numerous passengers, leaving them in a state of uncertainty. Addressing the issue during the NAAPE conference, Galadima expressed deep concern over the unpaid salaries and allowances owed to Dana Air’s staff since April. He called on the Aviation Minister to take immediate action to resolve the situation. Galadima stated, “Given the economic realities and the critical role of aviation in our nation’s economy, NEC appeals to all employers, including the government and airlines, to provide better working conditions for their employees. We urge the Minister of Aviation and Aerospace Development to intervene and ensure that Dana Air promptly settles all outstanding salaries, allowances, and financial obligations owed to its employees from April 2024. We also advocate for the inclusion of the union’s national organs in the ongoing review of the Nigerian Safety Investigation Bureau’s Conditions of Service, in alignment with international best practices and collective bargaining principles.”",

The ASUS ROG Ally Z1 is cheaper than budget gaming laptops and the Extreme version, although its processing power and graphics are limited. You can see whether the [budget version or the Z1 Extreme is better for you here](https://lifehacker.com/asus-rog-ally-z1-versus-z1-extreme-comparison-1850981011). Don’t expect to play every AAA smoothly without having some kind of problem. For most big AAA games, you will need a full-sized desktop or gaming laptop to run without hiccups. While you can play some on the ASUS ROG Ally Z1, you will have to accept playing with lower frames per second to make them run (our readers claim to be able to play AAA games at 60FPS without issues). If you’re not familiar with the Windows 11 operating system, this can be tricky to do. The ASUS ROG Ally Z1 brings you 512GB of memory with a micro SD memory card slot if you want to expand it, an AMD Ryzen Z1 processor, 16GB RAM, and a seven-inch touchscreen LED with a maximum video resolution of 1080p. The rechargeable battery will give you about eight and a half hours of battery time. You can read the full [PCMag review of the ASUS ROG Ally Z1 here](https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/asus-rog-ally). While the ASUS ROG Ally is not objectively better or worse than the Steam Deck, at its current price, the Ally Z1 can be a better option than the Steam Deck for most people.",
