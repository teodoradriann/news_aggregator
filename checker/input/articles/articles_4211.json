    "text": "The BJP launched a broadside on opposition parties over the alleged targeting of Hindus in West Bengal, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, claiming this goes on to prove that the assertion about the eradication of 'Sanatan Dharma' is not merely a statement but a campaign.\nBJP national spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi hit out at the Trinamool Congress government for not allowing his party's leaders, including a group of women comprising legislators and others to visit trouble-torn Sandeshkhali and not arresting Shajahan Sheikh, a local TMC strongman.\nMr. Sheikh has been accused by some women in Sandeshkhali of running a ring of TMC members involved in land grabs and sexual assault.\nALSO READ Enforcement Directorate raids residences of associates of absconding TMC leader Shajahan Sheikh Mr. Trivedi told reporters that it was not only about the West Bengal government protecting him but there was a particular mindset which believes in \"secular protection\" of some people irrespective of crimes and atrocities they commit.\nWhile \"secular parties\" are keeping mum because they weigh the complaints of women against their vote-bank politics even the self-proclaimed champions of women's rights have maintained silence, he said.\nThis is not merely an incident but a phenomenon which has destroyed Bengal for over two centuries, the Rajya Sabha member said as he referred to targeting of women and Hindus in the past.\nAlso Read | Fresh protests rock West Bengal’s Sandeshkhali\nIt is not about Hindus and Muslims. Some parties believe in protecting radicals and criminal elements among Muslims to maintain their hold on power and are not concerned about the future, he alleged.\nCiting a new law passed in Karnataka which mandates that the state government will collect 10% of the income of temples that have revenues of more than ₹1 crore and the earlier comments of some DMK leaders in Tamil Nadu criticising 'Sanatan Dharma', he said all these developments, including the Sandeshkhali incident, show that the \"eradication of Sanatan Dharma is not merely a statement but a campaign\".\nThese parties gave Haj subsidy, now scrapped, and imposed taxes on temples, he said.\nCOMMents\nSHARE\nCopy link Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",

    "text": "Taipei, July 10 (CNA) Power has been restored to nearly 907,600 homes hit by a blackout due to the record damage to utility poles during Typhoon Danas over the past weekend, as of 7 p.m. Thursday, the state-run Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) said.\nDanas, which made landfall in Chiayi County Sunday night, has toppled a total of 2,454 power poles across Taiwan, leading to power outages at 964,301 households, according to Taipower's website.\nThe record number of damaged power poles, each weighing over 1 metric ton, created the biggest challenge in the company's efforts to restore power supply to affected clients since Monday, especially those in remote areas, Taipower said in a statement Thursday.\nWhile power has been restored in nearly 94% of homes hit by a blackout, there were still 56,705 households without power as of 7 p.m. Thursday, and Taipower said those were mostly at the end of power lines and in mountainous areas.\nAccording to Taipower, restoring power supply to the last few homes can be more difficult than the work required in a blackout that hits 10,000 clients in ordinary days.\nFor example, Taipower said it had to rebuild 20 power poles along 3 kilometers to reestablish power supply to just five homes.\nThe company said over 90 percent of its staff from across Taiwan are in Chiayi and Tainan to repair the main power line, with work expected to be completed on Friday.\nTaipower's top priority is to restore power supply to residential clients with its ongoing works fixing the main power line, the company said.\nHowever, the days of rain that followed Danas' departure continued to hamper its ongoing works, according to Taipower.\nSeveral districts and townships in Tainan, Kaohsiung and Pingtung County in southern Taiwan closed schools and government offices over heavy downpours on Thursday, while the Central Weather Administration (CWA) still has an extremely heavy rain advisory in place for the southern cities and counties, along with Taitung.\nThe CWA weather advisories issued at 5:15 p.m. Thursday warned of more than 100 millimeters of rainfall in three hours or 24-hour rainfall exceeding 200 mm in Tainan, Kaohsiung, Pingtung and Taitung until Friday morning.\nThe weather agency also warned of heavy rainfall exceeding 40 mm in one hour or 24-hour rainfall of over 80 mm in Chiayi during the same period.",

    "title": "‘No limits’ to Ukraine support, Macron tells party leaders",
    "text": "PARIS: President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday said France would not rule out any option to support Ukraine two years into Russia’s invasion, leaders of several major French political parties said. Speaking after the two-and-a-half-hour meeting, the party chiefs said the talks with Macron left them concerned, with some accusing him of using the conflict to boost his coalition’s standing ahead of crucial European elections this summer. The president had last week stunned many in Europe by refusing to rule out the dispatch of Western ground troops to Ukraine, pointing to Russia’s hardening stance. And earlier this week Macron urged Ukraine’s allies not to be “cowards” in supporting the ex-Soviet country to fight off the Russian invasion. Some party leaders on Thursday said Macron advocated a “no limits” approach to counter Russian President Vladimir Putin. Green party leader Marine Tondelier recounted Macron saying Putin “obviously has no limits.” She said it was “extremely worrying” to see Macron tell the meeting “we must show we have no limits,” too. Jordan Bardella, president of the far-right National Rally (RN) party, said he had pleaded with Macron “not to go to war with Russia.” The president’s thinking includes “no limits and no red lines”, said Bardella. Far-left heavyweight Manuel Bompard added: “I arrived worried and I left even more worried.” Weighing in from Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Thursday that Macron “continues to raise the level of France’s direct involvement” in the Ukraine war. France’s parliament will have a chance to vote on the country’s Ukraine strategy, including a bilateral security treaty signed with Kyiv last month. Debates and non-binding votes will take place next Tuesday in the National Assembly lower house and in the Senate upper house on Wednesday. On Thursday, Macron also met with Moldovan President Maia Sandu, pledging France’s “unwavering support” for her ex-Soviet country as tensions mount between Chisinau and pro-Russian separatists. During the meeting the two signed a bilateral defence deal, as well as an “economic roadmap”, although no details were provided. Later Thursday, France was also set to host a video conference of nearly 30 countries including Ukraine, which will follow up on the initiatives discussed at an international Ukraine summit hosted by Macron last week.",
