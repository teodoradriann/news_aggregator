    "text": "Melbourne, March 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Melbourne, Victoria -\nFix-It Right Plumbing is calling on homeowners to take immediate action to ensure their stormwater drains are adequately maintained. With the approaching winter season, the company warns that increasingly unpredictable weather patterns are expected to bring heavier rainfall, and adequate stormwater drainage is essential to protecting homes from flooding and water damage.\n\"Homeowners need to be proactive in addressing their stormwater drainage systems, particularly as we head into the storm season,\" said a representative for Fix-It Right Plumbing. \"As we've seen with Cyclone Alfred and the upcoming winter rains, the risk of severe weather events is real, and inadequate stormwater drainage systems can lead to costly damage to properties.\"\nFix-It Right Plumbing is dedicated to raising awareness among homeowners about the crucial role that properly maintained stormwater drains play in preventing flooding and water damage during extreme weather events. As Australia faces more drastic weather pattern changes, the risk of intense rainfall, cyclones, and storms has grown significantly.\n\"With the growing frequency of extreme weather events, it's more important than ever to ensure that your stormwater drainage system is in top condition,\" said a representative for Fix-It Right Plumbing. \"A blocked or inadequate drain can turn a heavy rainfall into a flood emergency. Preparation is key.\"\nEnsuring that stormwater drainage systems are transparent and functioning efficiently is one of the most effective ways homeowners can protect their properties from the adverse impacts of these events. Regular inspections and drain clearing are necessary to avoid blockages that could lead to backups and flooding. Fix-It Right Plumbing is encouraging homeowners to act now rather than waiting for a storm to strike, ensuring their drains are fully prepared for the weather ahead.\n\"Ensuring your drains are clear today can save you from costly damage tomorrow,\" said the representative for Fix-It Right Plumbing.\nFix-It Right Plumbing, an industry leader in plumbing services since 2007, offers an array of services, including blocked drain clearing, drain relining, leak detection, and tap repairs. The company has built a strong reputation across Australia, particularly in Melbourne, Geelong, Canberra, and surrounding areas, for its dedication to quality service and customer satisfaction.\nThe company stresses that, with the increase in rainfall expected during the coming months, ensuring stormwater drains are clear and functioning properly is a critical step in preventing flooding. Blocked or inadequate drains can quickly result in water overflow, leading to potential property damage and expensive repairs. Fix-It Right Plumbing recommends regular inspections and maintenance to avoid these risks.\nFix-It Right Plumbing has earned a stellar reputation for customer satisfaction, with a 4.9-star rating on Google from over 2,000 reviews. Customers consistently commend the company for its professionalism, responsiveness, and quality of work. The company's full range of plumbing services ensures homes remain safe and functional year-round.\nIn addition to blocked drain clearing, Fix-It Right Plumbing offers a variety of services to maintain and repair plumbing systems, including hot water access, gas leaks, and burst pipes.

Ciudad de México.- [Frida Sofía](https://www.elimparcial.com/tags/frida-sofa/) sorprendió al aparecer en México, después de que trascendiera que no podía visitar el país azteca por problemas migratorios en Estados Unidos. Después de que se mostraran imágenes donde se veía a la artista con su familia paterna, ahora Ventaneando informó que la influencer estaría en la ciudad con otro motivo. Nos estamos enterando de que vino a México a denunciar a su mamá, a Alejandra Guzmán, y no a ratificar la denuncia en contra de su abuelo Enrique Guzmán” Reveló Pati Chapoy.

Ante la duda sobre el motivo por el que Frida decidió actuar legalmente en contra de la mujer que le dio la vida, Pedro Sola comentó: “debe ser cuestiones de dinero”, a lo que Chapoy contestó: “seguramente”. Acto seguido, la titular de Ventaneando retomó parte de la entrevista que le hizo a Alejandra Guzmán en 2023, cuando la cantante lanzó el sencillo “Milagros”, dedicado a su descendiente. Arreglar diferencias A pesar de que en ese momento la rockera externó su deseo de arreglar sus diferencias con la joven, en esa ocasión la hija de Silvia Pinal y Enrique Guzmán contó el motivo por el que iniciaron las diferencias entre madre e hija. “Empezó el distanciamiento cuando yo le quite el dinero, cuando yo le dije ‘quiero que generes tu carrera, que hagas algo de tu vida’, y ya no le gustó que hubiese esa mensualidad (sic). Estudió en Miami, vivió en Miami, tiene un departamento que le regalé, un coche que le regalé, o sea, yo le di todo lo que mi mamá y mi papá nunca me dieron”, dijo Alejandra en ese momento. Tras estas declaraciones de La Guzmán, Pati Chapoy finalmente agregó: “ya veremos en qué para todo este asunto lamentable del caso de Frida Sofía, que está demandando y denunciando a su mamá, tampoco sabemos cuáles son las razones que tiene Frida Sofía, seguiremos muy al pendiente en este caso”.",

Director Imtiaz Ali recently opened up in a recent interview about being ‘moved’ when he read the Rig Veda and Bhagavad Gita at a very young age. Talking to [Ranveer Allahbadia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Rn5kEiSSQs), the director got candid about why he picked up these holy texts in the first place.

Bhagavad Gita has also been an important book in my life, it’s still that book I keep on my table. In sixth grade, I was travelling alone by train and money was tight. And ironically it was the only book I could afford to buy at the railway station. I also thought people around me would find it weird and wonder why I was reading it,” he said. ‘I’m after the simplicity of expression’ [Imtiaz](https://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/bollywood/did-kareena-kapoor-and-shahid-kapoors-breakup-affect-the-jab-we-met-shoot-imtiaz-ali-breaks-silence-101715070268833.html) also shared that when he started reading Bhagavad Gita, he was surprised by how easy it was to understand. “There were a few things I had to re-read ten times to understand, but I understood it. I would read a few pages every day. It’s now deep within me; I'm lucky I was exposed at such a young age. It has helped me understand people better. I’ve read other religious texts too. They’re interesting and entertaining, if I find a nugget that resonates with me, it makes my day,” he said. Recent work Imtiaz recently directed [Amar Singh Chamkila](https://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/bollywood/diljit-dosanjh-thanks-veere-karthi-for-showering-praise-on-amar-singh-chamkila-101715857448774.html), which starred Diljit Dosanjh and Parineeti Chopra in the lead roles. The film, which was released on Netflix, is a biographical drama based on the life of the Punjabi singer. It charts the rise to fame and assassination of the titular performer and his wife, Amarjot Kaur. The film received good reviews from fans and critics.

    "title": "Toronto on the brink of transit strike as negotiations tick down to midnight deadline",
    "text": "TORONTO — Toronto was on the brink of its first major transit strike in 16 years as union leadership vowed it was ready to shut down service while the city's transit agency said there was still enough goodwill left to get a deal done before a midnight strike deadline. A strike could bring Canada's most populous city to a grinding halt. It would upend regular travel plans for tens of thousands of commuters who depend on its subways, streetcars and buses, while choking the city's already congested roadways. And unlike some Toronto transit strikes of the past, speedy back-to-work legislation from the province may not be a foregone conclusion. Ontario would not introduce a bill to end the strike unless Toronto requests it since the province is not directly involved in negotiations, a senior government source said, and any bill would likely not be introduced for weeks. The city's largest union of transit workers issued a statement that said as of 5 p.m. no progress had been made in its negotiations with the Toronto Transit Commission. \"ATU Local 113 will be moving forward with strike action tomorrow at 12:01 a.m.,\" read the union's statement. \"The TTC has left us no other choice, as we still need to prioritize a new fair agreement for our transit workers.\" If workers strike, a deal between the union and TTC would keep the system running until subway service ends, between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. Wheel-Trans, the paratransit service for people with disabilities, would also continue uninterrupted. \"We're not trying to harshly remove service so that people are stranded or abandoned,\" ATU Local 113 president Marvin Alfred said at a news conference earlier Thursday. \"But we are doing our best to signal if you don't have to be in the system at midnight, why would you enter the system?\" The last TTC strike in 2008 ended after less than two days when the provincial government held a special weekend sitting to legislate the union members back to work. Several other ATU Local 113 job actions, including a record 23-day strike in 1970 and a 45-day work-to-rule campaign in 1989, have ended with legislation. TTC chair Jamaal Myers said early Thursday that he was \"encouraged\" that both sides remained at the bargaining table. He said the TTC was committed to securing a deal that avoids any job action that would be \"disruptive to the lives of millions of Torontonians.\" TTC spokesperson Stuart Green said the agency believes there is \"enough progress and goodwill that we can get an agreement without job action.\" Alfred dismissed those assurances and said the union was \"ready to pull the pin.\" Wages, benefits, and a number of job security issues are top sticking points for the union, Alfred said. The union wants protections against contracting jobs out to third parties and from cross-boundary service getting handed over to other Greater Toronto Area transit operators. Neither side has offered specifics on any proposed negotiating terms. A more than decade-long strike ban on TTC workers was recently lifted after a judge found a provincial law that labelled them essential workers was unconstitutional. Last month, the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissed an appeal brought by the province and upheld the workers' right to strike. Transit workers were backed Thursday by the Ontario Federation of Labour. \"These workers lost the right to strike for 12 years but they didn't just go to sleep,\" OFL president Laura Walton said at the same news conference where Alfred spoke. \"For the last 12 years, they have been building the power that they needed. They were building the solidarity that they needed. And on behalf of 54 unions and one million members, I stand here proudly in full support of what ATU 113 needs to do.\" - With files from Allison Jones and Paola Loriggio.

    "title": "Javier Milei volvió a cargar contra la herencia del kirchnerismo y recordó que Axel Kicillof creía \"estigmatizante\" medir la pobreza",
    "text": "Javier Milei dio un discurso este jueves en el Congreso de Inversiones Inmobiliarias, en el que criticó con dureza al kirchnerismo. Apuntó sus cuestionamientos más fuertes contra Axel Kicillof, a quien le recordó que tildaba de \"estigmatizante\" la medición de la pobreza. También lo llamó soviético y afirmó: \"No sabe hacer las cuentitas ni con un ábaco\". El Presidente anticipó que daría un discurso \"más técnico que político\" y explicó que el kirchnerismo (\"Los horcos\", volvió a denominarlos) le dejaron \"la peor herencia de la historia argentina\", una \"verdadera catástrofe\". \"Aquellos que tanto se jactan de cuidar y proteger a los trabajadores, crearon más empleo informal que formal. ¡Qué linda forma de cuidar a los trabajadores tiene el movimiento nacional de los trabajadores!\", exclamó. Y añadió: \"Como si fuera poco, los empleados públicos fueron llevados a 4 millones de personas... Una mentira para maquillar los números\". \"Parece que están preocupados por la pobreza y los indigentes, pero en los cuatro años anteriores no había pobres ni indigentes y cuando habían estado antes los escondieron abajo de la alfombra porque era estigmatizante\", ironizó Milei. Sus palabras estuvieron dedicadas directamente a Kicillof, autor de ese calificativo para la medición de pobres en 2015. \"Dos de cada tres chicos ya eran pobre [en el kirchnerismo] y una de las ofensas más grandes que generó el kirchnerismo es que 1/3 de los trabajadores eran pobres aun teniendo trabajo. No solo eso, sino que además a ese cuadro de actividad, empleo y salarios tan lamentable se acompaña con tasa de inflación creciente. Parece que ahora descubrieron que apareció la inflación\", siguió el Presidente. Al hablar del aumento de precios volvió a aludir al gobernador bonaerense. \"Como quiere hacer creer el soviético, que es una ficción y sólo una cuestión de cuentitas. El problema es que él no las sabe hacer ni siquiera con un ábaco, porque no sabe sumar ni con un ábaco\", enfatizó el libertario, ante su audiencia en el Hotel Hilton de Puerto Madero. Un rato después, hubo otra chicana contra Kicillof, traspié oral mediante. \"Vamos a hablar los dos pilares de acá hacia adelante son dos\", dijo el Presidente, cayendo en una falacia. Se dio cuenta rápido. \"Perdón. Es que estuve nombrando al soviético y se me pegó... Bueno, me pueden acusar de redundante, no de bruto\", salió del paso el Presidente, buscando complicidad en el público que lo escuchaba. En otro tramo extendió sus críticas al Ministerio de las Mujeres y al INADI, a los que tachó de \"siniestros\" y acusó de \"perseguir opositores\". \"Dicho sea de paso, estoy orgulloso que de dentro de las cosas que eliminamos están el siniestro Ministerio de la Mujer y el siniestro INADI que se utilizaban para perseguir ideológicamente\", dijo. Al respecto, luego cuestionó -sin nombrarla- a la conductora radial Julia Mengolini. \"En estos días fui reivindicado. Una periodista kirchnerista dijo que el 'yo te creo hermana' era una cuestión retórica. Es decir que era una forma de perseguir opositores, cargándoles a los opositores delitos aberrantes que después nos enteramos que son los delitos aberrantes que cometen ellos\", continuó Milei, haciendo referencia a la denuncia de Fabiola Yañez contra Alberto Fernández por violencia de género: Más tarde revisitó sus críticas contra los \"econochantas\", centrado en Carlos Melconian, al que llamó \"pasado de tintura negra\". Los señaló por calificar de \"inconsistente\" al programa económico y por dudar del ajuste. En cambio, volvió a tildar de \"gigante\" a Luis Caputo, actual ministro de Economía, porque \"llegó al déficit cero en el primer mes de gestión\". Hubo también halagos para Patricia Bullrich: dijo que su trabajo es \"enorme\", que ella es \"generosa\" y que \"la historia le dará su reconocimiento, no solo por el apoyo para la segunda vuelta en las elecciones\". Prolongó sus elogios al resto del gabinete. \"Recuerdo ir a Casa Rosada todos los días llegando a las 8 de la mañana y yéndome a las 12 de la noche. Fueron momentos muy duros, pero es cierto que creó un espíritu de cuerpo con todo el gabinete, un gabinete del que estoy orgulloso. Estamos llevando a cabo una gesta heroica que quedará marcada en los libros de texto, porque estamos comprometidos a ser el mejor gobierno de la historia argentina\", expresó Milei. Y siguió sacando pecho: \"Dejamos las bases para que argentina pueda crecer a largo plazo. empezamos a parecernos e algunos países europeos. Pero no me alcanza parecerme a Alemania, Francia o Italia. Quiero que sea el país más libre del mundo y nos quedan miles de modificaciones estructurales\". Continuó con sus enojos y exabruptos, al hablar de la gestión del tipo de cambio. \"Aquellos que querían el dólar entre 1800 y 2000\", aludió a los pronósticos que lo acompañaron en sus primeros días de gobierno, \"lloran y caminan como mandriles porque hoy tipo de cambio está en 1250\". Luego, más cerca del cierre de su discurso, avisó que iba a \"hablar en latín\". \"Los que me dicen que los dólares los tengo que comprar con emisión monetaria... Es decir esa manga de hijos de re mil puta... Todavía no justifiqué por qué lo son... Lo que me están diciendo es que yo le rompa el culo al pueblo argentino con el impuesto inflacionario para pagar la deuda, por eso son tremendos hijos de re mil puta\", se despachó Milei Si bien confirmó que el impuesto PAIS pasará del 17,5 al 7,5% en septiembre y será eliminado en diciembre, evitó dar precisiones sobre la salida del cepo. \"Son tan imbéciles que no se dan cuenta que somos liberales, que no tenemos fechas. No ponemos plazos, no somos dirigistas. Dependo de cumplir metas en función de que los agentes lo quieran lograr\", explicó. Los mayores aplausos llegaron cuando destacó la derogación de la Ley de Alquileres. \"De hecho, siendo que ustedes están en el sector de Real Estate, no me pueden negar que fue un verdadero éxito eliminar la Ley de Alquileres\", dijo. El auditorio se vino abajo, con palmas y chifildos. Anduvo cerca el tramo inmediatamente siguiente. \"Cuando llegamos había cuatro grifos que estaban abiertos de forma inundante\", indicó Milei, saboreando esa última palabra. \"No me van a decir que no uso bien las metáforas, jajaja... Debe haber algo que me tiene hecho un poeta\", sugirió, con movimiento de cejas, revoleo de ojos y pulgares arriba, acaso por su romance confirmado con Yuyito González. El Presidente habló el día después de que el INDEC publicara dos datos clave para el Gobierno: el Índice de Precios al Consumidor y las Canastas Básicas. La inflación de julio fue del 4% que, si bien se ubicó apenas por encima de las previsiones oficiales, es el índice más bajo desde enero de 2022. Además, el INDEC informó el miércoles que una familia de cuatro integrantes necesitó $ 900.647 en el séptimo mes del año para no ser pobre. En las últimas semanas también se supo que, en el primer trimestre de 2024, la pobreza alcanzó al 54,8% de las personas que viven en los principales centros urbanos. Proyectado a todo el país, equivale a 25,5 millones de pobres.",

Inc. a not-for-profit organization which has been operated by Davy Lloyd’s parents for more than two decades, according to the group’s website. Mission in Haiti, Inc., runs a Christian mission including orphanages, schools and churches. On behalf of the Haitian Diaspora and the people of Haiti, the Haitian Diaspora Political Action Committee, ( [HDPAC](http://www.hdpac.org)) and the Office of the Haitian Diaspora (ODIHA) present their sincere condolences to the LLOYD and MONTIS family whose losses are irreplaceable. We share in their sorrow, and their grief as they mourn the senseless killing of three brave individuals who selflessly gave themselves to the service of others. These senseless and barbaric killings must stop NOW. Nathalie and Davy were two young Americans who could have been doing something else, but they chose to care for young abandoned Haitian children because of their love and admiration for Haiti and its people. Mission Haiti Inc., has been operating in Haiti for the last two decades and during that time they have cared for thousands of Haitian children and for that we thank them. Ben Baker, Nathalie Loyd’s father, who is a State Representative in Missouri, told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on “The Source.” “I don’t think you can find a better example of people who truly had a deep love for the people of Haiti and had a vision to help them in any way that they could and made such an impact there among the different ministries they were involved in.” What happened to the LOYDS and MONTIS is exactly what the people of Haiti experience daily from criminal gangs (senseless killings, raping of young women, kidnapping and torturing). We are calling on the Biden administration to immediately provide all needed resources to fight gang violence in Haiti, including the designation of a White House Special Envoy to Haiti, the deployment of US Military specialists to coordinate the international mission led by Kenya, provide technical support and intelligence to the Haitian security forces in the fight against the gangs. HDPAC and ODIHA are specifically calling on Haiti Transitional Presidential Council (TPC)to appoint a prime minister ready to take on the challenges of fighting gang violence. The Haitian Diaspora under the leadership of ODIHA and HDPAC are committed to working with the Haitian government, the U.S. government and all stakeholders to meet heads on the challenges of restoring peace and security in Haiti. “We are deeply saddened by the senseless killing of these three individuals. Our hearts and prayers go to the Lloyd, Baker and Montis family who are experiencing unimaginable grief. We hope that the perpetrators will be brought to justice soon.” Dorothy Dupuy, Vice President, HDPAC.

    "title": "Portugal vence e Cristiano Ronaldo chegou aos 900 golos | Futebol internacional | PÚBLICO",
    "text": "A selecção nacional bateu a Croácia no primeiro jogo da Liga das Nações, com o “capitão” a chegar a um número histórico de golos. Portugal entrou com um triunfo importante no arranque da Liga das Nações, batendo a Croácia por 2-1, com golos de Dalot e Ronaldo, posicionando-se da melhor forma no Grupo A1, que apura para os quartos-de-final os dois primeiros classificados. Inspirado no equipamento, Cristiano Ronaldo deu mais uma pincelada na obra-prima do maior goleador da história do futebol, colocando o 900.º \"azulejo\" num painel pintado a golos. Roberto Martínez surpreendeu quando anunciou o \"onze\" inicial, de que não constava nenhum médio defensivo, surgindo antes o ala Pedro Neto — jogador entre os titulares com menos minutos de competição. Nesse momento ganhou força a narrativa de uma selecção portuguesa empenhada em mandar na bola, precisamente o que não tinha conseguido no jogo de preparação para o Europeu que perdeu no Jamor frente aos croatas , confiando essa missão a homens exímios na arte de \"esconder o couro\", como Vitinha, Bruno Fernandes e Bernardo Silva. Uma opção com riscos associados, mas que Portugal procurou reduzir ao transformar Pedro Neto num engodo, ficando o extremo de guarda ao corredor enquanto Diogo Dalot se aventurava em terrenos mais adiantados. E foram precisamente duas diagonais de Dalot a denunciarem o desconforto de uma Croácia sustentada em dois blocos, com cinco defesas (três centrais apoiados por falsos laterais) e uma linha de quatro em que Modric avançava para apoiar Kramaric. Da primeira resultou uma ameaça consumada com o remate de Bruno Fernandes para defesa de Livakovic. Na segunda, a dupla do Manchester United rompeu mesmo a barreira do som da Luz. Bruno assistiu e Diogo fez o golo. Em apenas sete minutos, Portugal conseguia o primeiro objectivo, colocando-se na frente do marcador. Mas havia ainda outro passo fundamental a dar, sendo que a Croácia não é propriamente um adversário submisso ou resignado perante a primeira adversidade. Modric e companhia fizeram questão de vincar esse traço de carácter e Portugal foi brevemente chamado a mostrar uma faceta menos inebriante e um pouco mais operária. Apesar da declaração de intenções croata, Portugal voltou ao acelerador e Cristiano Ronaldo deixou, de imediato, a promessa de cravar o 900.º golo da carreira, número só ao alcance dos eleitos. Indiferente à voracidade do “capitão” português, Livakovic prolongou por mais uns instantes o jejum iniciado por Ronaldo no Alemanha 2024 com uma defesa de andebol. Mas o guarda-redes de José Mourinho nada pôde fazer quando Nuno Mendes cruzou para a finalização impecável (34’) de “El bicho”. O Youtube implodia e Ronaldo até se esqueceu do festejo da praxe. Portugal era imenso, num suave azulejo, como no “Fado Tropical” de Chico Buarque, apesar de os números da noite indiciarem um equilíbrio que a Croácia reforçou com um autogolo de Diogo Dalot (41’) praticamente a caminho dos balneários, ainda com o estrondo da bola de Pedro Neto à barra da Croácia a ferir os tímpanos. Em vantagem, Roberto Martínez repensou a estratégia e começou o segundo acto sem os alas Neto e Leão, equilibrando a equipa defensivamente com João Neves e Nelson Semedo. A Croácia já tinha mostrado as garras e era preciso evitar uma réplica. Mas para uma gestão perfeita - até a pensar um pouco no jogo com a Escócia - faltava o conforto de uma almofada: um golo que Cristiano Ronaldo perseguiu, mas que Livakovic não autorizou, nem ao \"capitão\" nem a Bruno Fernandes, os mais empenhados. Os croatas também não desarmavam no ataque, construindo situações suficientes para evitar a derrota depois de um Europeu de má memória, em que a equipa de Dalic não passou da fase de grupos. E foi já com o acumular do cansaço dos nervos que Portugal acabou por selar um triunfo sofrido na parte final, aligeirado pelo regresso de Pedro Gonçalves à selecção.",

    "text": "Una nueva normalidad climática para la temperatura y el hielo marino en el Ártico se espera en un futuro próximo, antes de 2050, mientras que la lluvia alcanzará un estado análogo a final de siglo.\nCientíficos de la Universidad de Groninga y del Real Instituto Meteorológico de los Países Bajos (KNMI) han desarrollado un método para predecir esta nueva normalidad climática -que denominan ToE (Tiempo de Emergencia) y supera el umbral del clima anómalo- en diversas regiones árticas, basándose en el calentamiento, la humedad y el derretimiento del hielo marino. Los resultados se han publicado en la revista Scientific Reports.\nLos autores han utilizado 14 modelos climáticos globales y los han alimentado con diversos escenarios de emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero y cantidades de aerosoles para reconstruir el pasado y predecir los cambios climáticos futuros en el Ártico. El TdE se definió como el momento en que los valores de una variable climática han sido superiores al 97,5% de los valores históricos durante diez años consecutivos.\nLos resultados muestran que, si bien el Ártico se está calentando rápidamente, en general, aún no se ha alcanzado el ToE para la temperatura y la capa de hielo marino. Esto se debe principalmente a la altísima variabilidad natural de estas variables árticas.\nEl predictor más sensible del cambio climático\nExisten grandes diferencias regionales. Por ejemplo, el espesor del hielo marino ya ha alcanzado un nuevo estado climático en la región central del Ártico, dado que la variabilidad interanual del espesor es relativamente pequeña. Esto convierte al hielo marino en el predictor más sensible del cambio climático.\n\"Nos emocionó ver que pudimos estimar la TdE de forma consistente y robusta\", afirma Richard Bintanja, profesor de Cambio Climático y Ambiental de la Universidad de Groninga y autor correspondiente del estudio. Las nuevas predicciones de la TdE ayudarán a los habitantes locales del Ártico a adaptarse al nuevo clima. \"El siguiente paso es aplicar estos conocimientos en la sociedad, las políticas y la ecología\".",
