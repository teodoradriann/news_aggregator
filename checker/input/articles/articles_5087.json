    "text": "New Delhi, July 10 : As relentless rains lashed the Northeast, swallowing homes and marooning thousands, the Indian Army has launched extensive Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) operations under 'Operation Jal Rahat 2', with coordinated deployment across Nagaland, Assam, and Manipur.\nNew Delhi, July 10 (IANS) As relentless rains lashed the Northeast, swallowing homes and marooning thousands, the Indian Army has launched extensive Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) operations under â€˜Operation Jal Rahat 2â€™, with coordinated deployment across Nagaland, Assam, and Manipur.\nOn 10 July, the Deputy Commissioner of Dimapur formally requisitioned assistance from the Indian Army to provide immediate flood relief in Singrijan Colony, one of the worst-hit areas.\nThe Army swiftly responded with the deployment of an Engineer Task Force (ETF) team. While a verbal de-requisition was received later in the day, the Army remains on standby with resources mobilised through the Flood Relief Control Centre at HQ IGAR (N).\nIn Upper Assam, the Dhansiri River in Golaghat district has breached danger levels. Although water levels are now receding, the Indian Army continues to monitor the situation closely and is ready to intervene, should the need arise.\nIn Manipur, the Nambol River flowing through Imphal West and Bishnupur districts has also surpassed danger levels. While floodwaters are beginning to recede, the Army remains actively engaged in relief operations in coordination with civil authorities.\nAs of today, the Indian Army has deployed 40 Relief Columns (24 Main + 16 Reserve) across the region.\nSimilarly, the Indian Army has rescued 3,820 people, distributed over 1,300 food packets, supplied more than 15,000 water bottles and over 2,000 individuals have received medical aid.\nFor the Indian Army these are not merely statistics - the main mission lies in rescuing the flood affected countrymen and women and bringing smiles to their faces.\nThe timely intervention by the Indian Army has proved to be a catalyst in saving the people whose lives have been impacted by these relentless rains, proving that the Armyâ€™s role is not just limited to safeguarding the borders but also in rescuing citizens during any such crisis.\nThrough timely intervention, rapid mobilisation, and seamless coordination with civil authorities, the Army continues to provide life-saving support and essential relief to the affected population across the Northeast.",

González señaló que “este acuerdo se enmarca en la política institucional impulsada por esta conducción desde el año 2017, que busca dotar a cada localidad patagónica con una sede propia que permita una mejor atención a los afiliados, contención, un espacio para reuniones y actividades de esparcimiento, y un vínculo más directo con la comunidad”. El Intendente Bórquez celebró esta iniciativa, destacando que representa un beneficio concreto para las trabajadoras y trabajadores del sector, y subrayó la importancia de que los afiliados de Luz y Fuerza cuenten con un lugar propio para reunirse, compartir y fortalecer la vida institucional del gremio. La concreción de este avance fue posible gracias a las gestiones realizadas por el Secretario Adjunto del Sindicato, Juan Domingo Espinoza, junto al Gobernador de la Provincia de Santa Cruz, Claudio Vidal, quienes acompañaron con firme compromiso este proyecto. Sobre este punto, González expresó su reconocimiento y agradecimiento “al Gobernador Claudio Vidal, cuya gestión nos permite, con iniciativas como esta, seguir dotando a cada localidad donde el Sindicato tiene jurisdicción de una sede propia en beneficio de los trabajadores y sus familias”. \"Desde Luz y Fuerza de la Patagonia seguimos construyendo organización, presencia y representación en todo el territorio, convencidos de que una sede en cada localidad es una herramienta fundamental de defensa y crecimiento para nuestros afiliados\", concluyó el gremio en un comunicado.",

(Courtesy New York Landmarks Conservancy) Advertisement Three historic synagogues received Sacred Sites grants from the New York Landmarks Conservancy, a private non-profit organization dedicated to preserving and restoring New York’s historic architecture.\nThe grant program, which this year allocated more than $228,000 to 14 historic religious properties across the state, provides matching grants to congregations “for planning and implementing exterior restoration projects,” according to Thursday’s announcement. Half of the grantees are congregations in New York City.\nIn Manhattan, Kehila Kedosha Janina at 280 Broome St. — the only Greek-Jewish Romaniote synagogue in the Western Hemisphere — received $10,000 toward replacing its roof. The congregation, founded in 1906 by Jewish immigrants from Ioannina, erected the Lower East Side building in 1927.\nThe synagogue, which also operates as a museum, offers guided tours and holds services for Shabbat and holidays. They also host the annual Greek Jewish Festival with other Lower East Side Jewish institutions every spring. The building was declared a New York City Landmark in 2004.\nSign up for our newsletter to get must-read New York stories each day By submitting, I agree to the JTA/New York Jewish Week privacy policy & terms of use .\nPlease accept the JTA Privacy Policy By submitting the above I agree to the privacy policy and terms of use of JTA.org\nIn Brooklyn, Crown Heights’ Congregation Kol Israel has been granted $25,000 for roof replacement, skylight restoration and parapet repair. Founded in 1924 and claiming to be the “ oldest continuously practicing Orthodox community in Brooklyn, ” per their website, the Modern Orthodox congregation serves 75 member households and reaches hundreds more each year through programming such as community meals.\nThe building, located at 603 St. Johns Pl., was designed by Brooklyn architect Tobias Goldstone in 1927. The facade reflects the “Semitic style” popular at the time, which combines “Moorish and Byzantine Revival ornament[s] with Judaic motifs,” according to a New York Landmarks Conservancy press release. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2009.\nYoung Israel Beth El, an Orthodox synagogue in Borough Park, was granted $20,000 towards masonry restoration. The building, located at 4802 15th Ave., was designed in 1923 with acoustics in mind. It has been called “Brooklyn’s Carnegie Hall” for its history of inviting renowned cantors to pray at its pulpit during the golden age of “hazzanut,” or florid cantorial music. The synagogue reaches 1,200 people a year through services, Talmud study groups, community programs and concerts. The congregation hosts a popular “ Shabbos Mevarchim” service led by its famed cantor Benzion Miller, on the last Shabbat of every month . The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2010.\nAlong with grant money, the program also provides the congregations with technical assistance and workshops for implementing the grant and beginning the restoration process. To be eligible for a Sacred Sites grant, each site has to be a religious institution actively used for worship, as well as listed on the state or national Register of Historic Places.\n“We are delighted that our grants will help these diverse congregations maintain their buildings and continue to serve their communities with social service and cultural programs,” Peg Breen, the president of New York Landmarks Conservancy, said in a statement.” These 14 congregations reach a total of 60,000 people beyond their congregations with no-cost or low-cost services.”\nIn addition to the three synagogues, other grantees in New York City include the Ebenezer Gospel Tabernacle Christian Mission in Harlem, Old First Reformed Church in Park Slope, and St. Paul’s German Evangelical Lutheran Church and St. Peter’s Episcopal Church, both in Chelsea.\nShare this: Twitter Facebook WhatsApp Email",

    "text": "2023-12-28 12:28:23 As a strong year for U.S. stocks ends, fund managers face a big choice in 2024: stick with the handful of large growth and technology companies driving stock indexes higher, or invest in other stocks in the market. The so-called “Big Seven”: Apple ( [AAPL-US](https://invest.cnyes.com/usstock/detail/AAPL)), Microsoft ( [MSFT-US](https://invest.cnyes.com/usstock/detail/MSFT))、Alphabet ( [GOOGL-US](https://invest.cnyes.com/usstock/detail/GOOGL)), Amazon ( [AMZN-US](https://invest.cnyes.com/usstock/detail/AMZN)), Huida ( [NVDA-US](https://invest.cnyes.com/usstock/detail/NVDA))、Meta Platforms ( [META-US](https://invest.cnyes.com/usstock/detail/META)) and Tesla ( [TSLA-US](https://invest.cnyes.com/usstock/detail/TSLA)), with their share prices soaring from 50% to 240% respectively in 2023, making them one of the most valuable investments in the market. Because they are in [S&P 500 Index](https://invest.cnyes.com/index/GI/SPX)The seven companies are heavily weighted in the index, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the S&P’s 24% gain this year. Fund managers in the latest survey from Bank of America Global Research said holding these stocks is the market’s “most crowded” trade. But in recent weeks, expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next year while the economy avoids recession have awakened other parts of the market. Meanwhile, some investors say the Big Seven’s sharp gains could leave them overvalued or vulnerable to profit-taking. “When all seven large companies in the index are up, it’s good for the market,” said Jonathan Cofsky, portfolio manager in Janus Henderson Investors’ global technology and innovation team. “But I think there may be more in other areas of the market. Multiple opportunities, depending on interest rates and the economy.” According to Apollo Group data, this year [S&P 500 Index](https://invest.cnyes.com/index/GI/SPX)72% of stocks underperformed the market, a record-high ratio. However, there are signs that the rally is broadening.Equal weight [S&P 500 Index](https://invest.cnyes.com/index/GI/SPX)After lagging for much of the year, it gained 6.8% in December, while the weighted [S&P 500 Index](https://invest.cnyes.com/index/GI/SPX)It rose 4.5%.

With the Big Seven [S&P 500 Index](https://invest.cnyes.com/index/GI/SPX)If other stocks do not fill the gap, poor performance of these stocks may cause trouble for the broader market. Other important factors for stocks next year include whether inflation continues to decline, whether the Federal Reserve can cut interest rates at the pace expected by the market, and the continued resilience of the U.S. economy. The approach to the U.S. presidential election in November could also add to market volatility. Excitement about the commercial potential of emerging artificial intelligence (AI) technology also drove the development of some large companies in 2023, including Huida and Microsoft, whose share prices rose 238% and 56% respectively. Another factor is profitability: According to LSEG data, the Big Seven expect total profits to grow 39.5% in 2023, while [S&P 500 Index](https://invest.cnyes.com/index/GI/SPX)Other companies’ profits will fall by 2.6%. Their earnings growth is expected to outperform the market again in 2024, but by a smaller margin. But the Big Seven’s overall valuations are higher after their gains.Their average forward price-to-earnings ratio is 33.6 times, according to LSEG Datastream. [S&P 500 Index](https://invest.cnyes.com/index/GI/SPX)The price-to-earnings ratio is 19.8 times. “They’re entering the new year on a very high note,” said Matt Benkendorf, chief investment officer at Vontobel Quality Growth Boutique. BMO Capital Markets strategist Brian Belski advises investors to “buy a little of everything” in the coming year because he “expects individual stock participation to expand significantly”; participation in 2023 will be relatively small compared to historical levels.

Francisco Bido, senior portfolio manager at F/m Investments, said the Big Seven are [S&P 500 Index](https://invest.cnyes.com/index/GI/SPX)Their dominant position in equities means they are widely held by mutual funds and ETFs and may benefit as funds move from OTC funds to stocks. 1703802853 #Giants #driven #rise #stocks #year #leading #role #weaken #year #Anue #Juheng #Stock #Radar",
