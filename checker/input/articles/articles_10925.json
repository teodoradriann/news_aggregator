    "text": "Fluorescence imaging – a game-changer for endocrine surgery in German university hospital\nUsing Getinge’s Fluoptics Near Infrared (NIR) imaging technology has helped Halle University Hospital in Germany reduce unintentional removal of parathyroid tissue, which can cause serious consequences for patients undergoing endocrine surgery.\nThe Fluoptics technology enables the combined use of autofluorescence and fluorescence imaging with indocyanine green (ICG) in real time. This allows surgeons to accurately visualize both the location and perfusion of the parathyroid glands, and provides intraoperative guidance to significantly increase parathyroid gland identification rates.1 2\n“We were one of the first centers in the German-speaking region to use fluorescence imaging, and we now apply it routinely in thyroid and parathyroid surgery, performing approximately 500 procedures per year. The patients benefit from the technology, because every parathyroid gland that can be preserved is a success,” explains Prof. Dr. Kerstin Lorenz, Head of Endocrine Surgery and Deputy Director of the Department of Visceral, Vascular and Endocrine Surgery at Halle University Hospital.\nUp to 31% of thyroidectomies result in the accidental removal of parathyroid glands.3 Even though the resulting hypoparathyroidism usually is temporary, it may have a significant impact on patients' quality of life if it becomes permanent.\n“Health consequences include chronic hypoparathyroidism, which may lead to disrupted calcium metabolism, tissue calcification, and significantly reduced resilience. In worst case, these effects can contribute to increased mortality,” Prof. Dr. Kerstin Lorenz says.\nA major advantage of NIR imaging is that it helps surgeons make more confident decisions about preserving healthy-looking thyroid tissue in cases of benign thyroid disease.\n“We use autofluorescence to identify patterns that help us assess the severity of hyperparathyroidism and choose the best surgical strategy,” Prof. Dr. Kerstin Lorenz explains.\nEven when a gland is accidentally removed, autofluorescence imaging still allows for intraoperative identification on the back table in the sterile field – so that the tissue can be auto transplanted.\nAbout Fluoptics\nFLUOPTICS® imaging systems consist of a specially designed joystick-controlled camera and dedicated software. FLUOBEAM® LX, intended for thyroid and parathyroid surgery, is the first system of its kind to receive both FDA clearance and CE certification.\nThe integrated camera, which is compatible with standard OR lighting, even detects low-level fluorescence signals. This means that parathyroid glands can be visualized clearly without needing to dim the OR lights or directly illuminate the surgical field.\nReferences:\n1 Karamangil B, Berber E.

    "text": "LINKÖPING, Sweden — Barley seedlings grow on average 50% more when their root system is stimulated electrically through a new cultivation substrate. In a study published in the journal PNAS, researchers from Linköping University have developed an electrically conductive “soil” (eSoil) for soilless cultivation, known as hydroponics.\n“The world population is increasing, and we also have climate change. So it’s clear that we won’t be able to cover the food demands of the planet with only the already existing agricultural methods. But with hydroponics we can grow food also in urban environments in very controlled settings,” says Eleni Stavrinidou, associate professor at the Laboratory of Organic Electronics at Linköping University, and leader of the Electronic Plants group.\nHer research group has now developed an electrically conductive cultivation substrate tailored to hydroponic cultivation which they call eSoil. The Linköping University researchers have shown that barley seedlings grown in the conductive “soil” grew up to 50% more in 15 days when their roots were stimulated electrically.\nHydroponic cultivation means that plants grow without soil, needing only water, nutrients and something their roots can attach to – a substrate. It is a closed system that enables water recirculation so that each seedling gets exactly the nutrients it needs. Therefore, very little water is required and all nutrients remain in the system, which is not possible in traditional cultivation.\nHydroponics also enables vertical cultivation in large towers to maximise space efficiency. Crops already being cultivated in this manner include lettuce, herbs and some vegetables. Grains are not typically grown in hydroponics apart for their use as fodder. In this study the researchers show that barley seedlings can be cultivated using hydroponics and that they have a better growth rate thanks to electrical stimulation.\n“In this way, we can get seedlings to grow faster with less resources. We don’t yet know how it actually works, which biological mechanisms that are involved. What we have found is that seedlings process nitrogen more effectively, but it’s not clear yet how the electrical stimulation impacts this process,” says Eleni Starvrinidou.\nMineral wool is often used as cultivation substrate in hydroponics. Not only is this non-biodegradable, it is also produced with a very energy intensive process. The electronic cultivation substrate eSoil is made of cellulose, the most abundant biopolymer, mixed with a conductive polymer called PEDOT. This combination as such is not new, but this is the first time it has been used for plant cultivation and for creating an interface for plants in this manner.\nPrevious research has used high voltage to stimulate the roots. The advantage of the Linköping researchers’ “soil” is that it has very low energy consumption and no high voltage danger. Eleni Stavrinidou believes that the new study will open the pathway for new research areas to develop further hydroponic cultivation.\n“We can’t say that hydroponics will solve the problem of food security. But it can definitely help particularly in areas with little arable land and with harsh environmental conditions.”\nThe full article can be found in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences\nhere.\n— Linköping University via EurekAlert!",

    "text": "Cancer and the Black community: How 2 Northeast Ohio women are working to reverse a deadly trend CLEVELAND, Ohio (WOIO) - The Authentic Healing Cancer Support Group is a haven for cancer patients and their loved ones. Each person feels the impact of this deadly disease. “If we don’t learn to advocate for ourselves, we won’t receive the care that we need” said founder Staci Kirk. Incredibly, Kirk is a five-time survivor. She said she had to be proactive to beat cancer that many times. “When I was going through Hodgkin’s disease, it took me six doctors before I was actually diagnosed,” said Kirk. In January, Lynn and Nare Chaney would learn their loved one Corinne Smith lost her battle with cancer “I just want to cry. You look at people you love, friends, family and you say, ‘What happened?’” Lynn Chaney said. According to the American Cancer Society, Black people experience greater obstacles to cancer prevention, treatment, and survival because of systemic factors. In a survey from the organization, 32% of Black women say they have experienced racial discrimination at a health provider visit. “In my personal experience with patients, one of them is that people don’t believe them” said Cleveland Clinic Oncologist Dr. Tiffany Onger. Onger told 19 News this fight is personal. Her mother is a survivor and has the same experience as so many Black patients. She said she believes the first step to true change is diversity. “Here at the Cleveland Clinic, while we know that nationally only about 2.5% of oncologists are Black,” said Onger. “We’re working on pipeline programs going all the way to the high school level.” If you ever feel unheard or ignored by a medical professional, here is Onger’s advice: “Have a personal advocate. Someone that comes with you to your appointment to be a second set of eyes and ears.” Eyes, ears, and a strong community like Authentic Healing can help create strong survivors like Kirk. “I have things to do, I have places to go, and people to see. This thing has not stopped me yet. It’s not going to stop me now,” said Kirk. Learn more about [Authentic Healing Cancer Support Group here.](https://www.stacipurposekirk.com/) Copyright 2024 WOIO.
