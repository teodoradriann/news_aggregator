    "title": "West Melbourne homeowners will see $1 million upgrades to help resolve severe flooding issues",
    "text": "WEST MELBOURNE, Fla. - Flooding fixes are on the way for hundreds of homeowners in West Melbourne. Last year, FOX 35 spoke to people dealing with severe flooding in their neighborhood. They don’t live in a flood zone, but typical afternoon showers have put their subdivision underwater in the past. Now, the city has a million-dollar plan to help. The city of West Melbourne just wrapped up a year-long engineering study and found out, the culverts near the Publix on Minton Road area choking off the canal which is affecting the homeowners who live about seven minutes away from the supermarket. Water is struggling to drain, so the city is adding more pipes to move water. \"My house was like an island,\" said Linda Farrell who’s always worried about neighborhood flooding in Westbrooke. She says, it’s been the norm for years in her West Melbourne subdivision. \"I found fish on my front lawn, and the retention pond is in the back,\" said Tom Torak who lives a few doors down from Farrell. The Westbrooke subdivisions have five ponds and more than 500 homes, but water isn’t draining like it should. \"We don’t want to go through that flooding anymore,\" said Farrell. Now, the city hopes they won’t have to. \"We think this is a great solution that will help reduce floods,\" said Tim Rhode who’s the city manager for West Melbourne. Rhode says, engineers pinpointed the issue in the chain of canals which is causing slow moving water, so they&apos;re adding bypasses. He says the process includes \"running some pipe alongside through the wall of the canal to get that water through.\" Torak attended a city meeting this week about the solutions and is thrilled about the improvements. \"There’s three bypasses they’re going to do, kind of like a heart bypass,\" he said. The surgery will cost more than a million bucks, and the city already has most of the grant funding in place to foot the bill. \"I’m feeling ecstatic,\" said Farrell. Homeowners are happy because they were heard, and when the fixes are complete, they can hopefully save some money. Right now, the HOA pays to pump water out on their own when severe storms move in, and that costs homeowners $6,000-$10,000 per storm. FOX 35’s Esther Bower asked the city manager if he thinks the improvements will alleviate that pressure where they can get out of this pumping business? \"Absolutely, that’s our goal,\" said Rhode. \"We want to get their ponds to be able to just function by gravity so that nobody has to do any pumping.\" Construction should start in October and the project will take six to nine months to finish. \"We’re moving forward. It’s a good day,\" concluded Farrell. The HOA could still have to pump on their own this hurricane season and are holding their breath bo severe storms hit the Space Coast.",

    "title": "Why North Korea is sending 12,000 troops to Russia?",
    "text": "In the last several months, there have been occasional reports about North Korean troops allegedly fighting in Ukraine. Back in June, I argued that Pyongyang could’ve sent specialized personnel to help integrate some of the North Korean weapons (specifically rockets and missiles) into the Russian military, provided there’s more conclusive evidence that Moscow acquired them. However, more recently, claims about thousands of North Korean combat troops in Ukraine have resurfaced, with reports that South Korea’s National Intelligence Service (NIS) has information on around 12,000 of them allegedly fighting for the Russian military. This comes after the Kiev regime frontman Volodymyr Zelensky made similar claims , insisting that the “democratic Ukraine is at war with three dictatorships: Russia, Iran and North Korea”.\nPushing such narratives is very useful for spreading propaganda about the Neo-Nazi junta (obviously, the “beacon of democracy”) supposedly “defending Europe” and the “civilized NATO garden” from all those “evil hordes of autocracy”. Many outlets of the mainstream propaganda machine are already at work, publishing all sorts of unsubstantiated reports, claiming that North Korean troops are supposedly “already deserting” and then being “forced into penal units” . South Korean sources are even presenting rather unclear satellite imagery as “proof” of the large-scale deployment of North Korean soldiers . The Kiev regime now claims that these forces are being sent to “help drive Ukrainian forces out of Kursk [oblast/region]” . This is also being used to push other propaganda narratives about Moscow’s alleged “massive losses”.\nNamely, the United Kingdom’s Permanent Representative to the UN Barbara Woodward insists that “the harder Putin finds it to recruit Russians to be cannon fodder, the more willing he is to rely on DPRK”. It should be noted that the Neo-Nazi junta and South Korea claim that 11,000 to 12,000 North Koreans are supposedly in Ukraine (or are about to move in). Now, unless Pyongyang sent an army of some sort of genetically altered supersoldiers, this is a rather small number that’s unlikely to replace “Russians who don’t want to be cannon fodder”. However, such inconsistencies aren’t of any concern to the political West and its propagandists. As long as the narrative is kept alive, anything goes. Expectedly, the United States is also (ab)using the reports to “draw red lines regarding North Korean presence in Ukraine”.\nNamely, the House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Turner sent a letter to President Joe Biden, asking him to “brief the committee on Russia’s use of North Koreans in Ukraine”, insisting this should be considered a “red line for the US”. However, he’s not the only one. South Korea is also “demanding the immediate withdrawal of North Korean troops” . Politico even reports that Seoul “warned Moscow against further deployments” , threatening it could supply weapons to the Kiev regime . It should be noted that South Korea has already sent hundreds of thousands of artillery shells to the Kiev regime. Namely, back in early 2023, reports confirmed that Seoul decided to “lend” 500,000 shells to the Pentagon . What this means in practice is that South Korea made it possible for the US to send its own munitions to the Neo-Nazi junta forces.\nThus, even if we ignore solid intelligence that Seoul is directly supplying the Kiev regime, Russia certainly sees South Korea as one of the most loyal vassals of the US. Empty threats to Moscow will certainly not make this feeling go away, not to mention that they will only reinforce the Kremlin’s resolve to build even closer ties with Pyongyang. This is particularly true considering that the two neighboring countries are now officially allies and that both are coordinating their geopolitical efforts (including with China, leading to an Entente-like trilateral alliance). However, to make matters worse, even many Western top-ranking officials don’t really believe there are massive deployments of North Korean troops in Ukraine. Namely, the Pentagon is still refusing to support such assertions, as there’s simply no conclusive evidence.\nBoth Seoul and the Neo-Nazi junta have very strong reasons to ensure “controlled” escalation with Pyongyang, especially now when Donald Trump (the most likely winner of the upcoming election, provided they’re fair and square) promised to “get along with Putin and Kim” . By exaggerating the extent of North Korean involvement in Ukraine, the Kiev regime and South Korea believe they’ll both remain relevant in the foreseeable future. This is precisely why we can see a lot of media manipulation, with Korean and the Neo-Nazi junta sources trying to present Buryats, Tuvans, Yakuts or even Russian Koreans (native to the Russian Far East) as North Korean soldiers. The logic is that this could pass with Western audiences, as few are aware of Russia’s diversity, with hundreds of ethnic groups and subgroups, many of whom are Asians.\nFor instance, numerous Buryats and Tuvans are very prominent in the Russian military, reaching very high positions, with former Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu being the most obvious example (he’s half-Tuvan on his father’s side). There’s simply no way to tell whether a person is Tuvan, Yakut, Buryat or Korean solely based on their looks, meaning that any Russian soldier who happens to be Asian can then be presented as North Korean. Perfectly aware of this, Seoul’s intelligence services are already claiming that Moscow is allegedly “hiding” Pyongyang’s troops among Asian natives of Siberia. However, even South Korean reports indicate these could be special forces and that there are only 1,500 of them, a far cry from the previously mentioned 12,000. This brings us to the possibility that special forces could indeed be deployed.\nNamely, while the idea that 12,000 North Korean troops will replace “massive Russian losses” (obviously proving that, in that case, the losses aren’t really massive) is ridiculous, the possibility of Pyongyang sending special forces shouldn’t be ruled out entirely. North Korea has a sizeable SpecOps Corps , but lacks combat experience. Thus, it’s not outside of the realm of possibility that Pyongyang itself asked Moscow to send some of them to Ukraine or at least Russia, where they could train with Russian special forces who acquired the said combat experience, often by obliterating NATO personnel (who are officially not there, as evidenced by footage like this). However, claims about tens of thousands of North Korean soldiers “invading democratic Ukraine and Europe” are nothing more than propaganda.\nPlease follow Blitz on Google News Channel",

    "text": "La firma del convenio del metal garantiza la paz social para 8.000 trabajadores en el Campo de Gibraltar hasta 2031\nUGT y Femca ratifican el documento, que garantiza el aumento de salarios respecto al IPC, en un acto amadrinado por la consejera de Empleo, Rocío Blanco\nCoagener invertirá 3,5 millones en la construcción de una planta de almacenamiento con baterías en Los Barrios\nLa provincia de Cádiz ya cuenta con su nuevo convenio del metal. UGT y la patronal Femca han ratificado con su firma el nuevo documento en un acto celebrado en la subdelegación de la Junta en Algeciras, con lo que esperan establecer la paz social hasta 2031. Una de las claves del acuerdo es la revisión anual de los salarios acorde al IPC, que beneficiará a los 31.000 trabajadores de la provincia, de los que 8.000 son del Campo de Gibraltar.\nEl secretario de industria de UGT en Andalucía, el algecireño José Manuel Rodríguez Saucedo, ha destacado que el nuevo convenio cuenta con \"condiciones muy buenas\" para los trabajadores y que garantiza el poder adquisitivo, ya que incrementa el salario cada año conforme al IPC. De esta forma \"beneficia a los que están y a los que vendrán\".\nJosé Muñoz Flores, secretario general de la federación de empresas del metal de Cádiz (Femca), ha agradecido la mediación del Consejo Andaluz de Relaciones Laborales (CARL), en cuya sede se alcanzó el segundo y definitivo preacuerdo. \"Hasta ayer mismo estuvimos intercambiando documentos para redactar los últimos artículos\", ha recordado. \"Es el mejor convenio del metal de España porque es el mejor para los trabajadores y para las empresas\", ha sentenciado.\nLa consejera de Empleo, Rocío Blanco, quien ha amadrinado el acto de firma y ha valorado que se trata del \"mejor convenio del metal de España, incluso mejor que el de Vizcaya\". Blanco ha resaltado la importancia de asegurar \"la paz social hasta 2031\", lo que podrá evitar que se vuelvan a producir huelgas en el sector como la vivida el pasado junio. Esto, a su vez, da \"un margen de confianza para la inversión\". \"Es un convenio que da tranquilidad a trabajadores y familias\", ha puntualizado ante los medios.\nSaucedo y Flores han coincidido en que la duración hasta 2031 es un factor determinante para hacer más atractiva la apuesta de las empresas por sus industrias en la provincia, ya que asegura estabilidad a largo plazo. \"No es baladí, garantiza el empleo y la inversión, como en el caso de la nueva industria del hidrógeno verde en el Campo de Gibraltar\", ha resaltado el representante de UGT. \"Es el convenio de la inversión, se podrá convencer a grandes capitales para que inviertan aquí\", ha profundizado el secretario de la patronal.\nLas claves del convenio del metal\nEl nuevo convenio del metal de Cádiz establece una duración hasta el año 2031, con la aplicación del IPC durante toda la vigencia su vigencia para la revisión salarial. Además, en los pagos retroactivos de 2024 se realizará una revisión del 3% y del 2,8% para 2025.\nOtro de los puntos destacados es el complemento personal del plus penoso, tóxico, peligroso incondicionado, que desapareció del convenio en 2012 y que se recuperará de forma progresiva desde un 30% en 2025 hasta un 100% en 2030. Este complemento, al igual que el salario, se actualizará anualmente conforme al IPC y partirá de los 57 euros al mes una vez aplicado el incremento inicial del 30%.\nEl texto regula las condiciones de los trabajadores fijos discontinuos, a los que se les llamará por orden antigüedad y no con contratos de jornada parcial. También adelanta en diez días el pago de la nómina extra de diciembre (pasa al día 5) y se modifican al alza los importes de las dietas y transportes.\nSegún UGT, la implementación práctica del convenio dependerá de las empresas, que en algunos casos requerirán de condiciones particulares si cuentan con convenio propio. No obstante, a más tardar, se comenzará a aplicar una vez esté publicado en el Boletín Oficial del Estado (BOE).\nRechazo de CCOO\nCCOO rechazó acudir al acto de firma del nuevo convenio, después de que se desvinculase del preacuerdo alcanzado en la sede del CARL el pasado 27 de junio.\nRodríguez Saucedo, de UGT, ha lamentado que CCOO no se haya sumado a la firma y ha emplazado al sindicato a que explique \"por qué no firman\". Además, respecto a la posibilidad de que la formación decida llevar al juzgado el nuevo convenio, el sindicalista les ha invitado a ello si entienden que es perjudicial a los trabajadores, aunque ha asegurado que el juzgado no les dará la razón. \"Estamos convencidos de que es un buen convenio, si no, no lo hubiésemos firmado\", ha asegurado tras la firma frente a representantes de sindicatos y otras entidades.\nLa consejera Rocío Blanco ha rechazado durante la comparecencia ante los medios realizar una valoración de la no participación de CCOO en la firma del convenio pese a su participación en las sesiones en el CARL, aunque ha valorado positivamente en la comparecencia posterior la actitud de UGT y Femca durante las más de 80 horas de negociación. \"Habéis dado un ejemplo de cómo se negocia\", ha señalado la titular de Empleo.\nCCOO, por su parte, ha criticado la celeridad con que UGT y Femca han convocado la firma del convenio, apenas dos días después de que el sindicato no firmante señalase la demora que se estaba produciendo por la redacción de algunos artículos. \"Desde CCOO se va a revisar detenidamente, para valorar todas las acciones sindicales y judiciales, para defender los intereses de todas las personas afectadas\", ha apuntado la formación sobre el documento.",

    "text": "FORT MYERS, Fla — Lee County commissioners approved a plan for 1,100 new homes in rural Alva despite years of pushback from neighbors. Fox 4's Austin Schargorodski went to the old Lee County Courthouse, where residents made their case one last time, saying developments like this will change Alva forever.\nThey saddled up to make a statement. Some of the people pushing back on the development brought their horses to Downtown Fort Myers for the meeting. Sue Koffman told me it was a symbol of their rural life at risk.\nWatch what Alva residents told Austin:\nShe worries more homes mean more traffic, strained infrastructure, and a threat to wildlife. “That’s why we’re here. This isn’t an ideal place to have a horse, but if it’s the only place we have, we’re gonna’ come,” said Koffman\nMore than 30 people spoke out at Wednesday’s meeting. \"This is not responsible planning. This is reckless over-development that puts profit over people,” said Amanda Cochran.\nAustin first reported on this project in 2023, when the group Alva Strong petitioned against it, saying: \"You’re not just changing the density, you’re changing the identity of the area.\"\nThen in January 2024, they approved sewer lines to support higher density. By June, the developer Neal Properties met with neighbors to explain how they planned to address concerns with a revised application.\n\"This plan allows more open space than would typically be required,” said the developer, Neal Communities.\nNow, the developer has reapplied with changes: three access points to ease traffic, larger setbacks and more conservation space, and a plan to monitor sewer impacts on water quality.\n\"I will say that they have done some, but I don’t think it’s enough. But it’s better than the first rendition, which was just horrible,” said Bill Redfern.\nBut commissioners say their decision was based on facts and impact studies—not emotions.\n\"I didn’t hear any findings of fact or errors in law that I see that I could use to overturn this today, that’s why I happily second the motion,” said Brian Hamman.\nAnd they voted in favor of the development. For Sue, it’s a sign that the Alva she knows may soon disappear. \"We’re gonna ride around the city,” said Koffman.",

    "text": "SALT LAKE CITY, UT (KSTU) — Prison can be a dark, cold and lonely place. It’s a place most people want to avoid. But for more than 30 years, Robert Aguilar walked through the gates of the Utah State Prison willingly in an effort to deliver hope. “God has listened and heard my voice in prayer,” Aguilar reads from scripture. The tools of the trade are simple. A kind voice, an open heart, and a Bible. “There is a dark area of the prison system, and some get tired of it,” Aguilar said. “They want to change and that means it's from the heart.” Aguilar began taking his Bible to the Utah State Prison in 1983. It was a way for him to turn his life around. “I had a sense of worthlessness because of the life I had been leading previously,” Aguilar said. “I was a heavy drinker. My wife mentioned that she was going to leave me.” Faith, Aguilar says, changed his life. “I felt like I had something more. We all have something in our lives that calls to that. There is something more important that we can do than just living.” It was that faith that led Aguilar to devote his Sunday mornings as a christian minister — volunteering with prisoners willing to listen. “When I walk in, they call me ‘Pastor Bob,’ they all know me as Pastor Bob here. Bryan Taylor is a deputy warden for the prison who oversees volunteers. “I actually reached out and talked to some of the inmates out of the prison and they just love him,” Taylor said. The deputy warden says the service provided by Aguilar and prison volunteers is life changing. “Individuals when they are locked away and they are contemplating their life – having someone to talk to – that one-on-one communication face-to-face cannot be replicated by anything else than doing it,” Taylor said. Now 88 years old, Aguilar likes to be with his family, work in his garden, or enjoy a meal at Ogies, his favorite restaurant in West Valley City. It’s a place where he’s reconnected with some former prisoners. “I had fellows come in and they tapped me on the back, and they say ‘Pastor Bob, you don't know me, I was in your services, and I took on what you told me, what was in scripture that my life could be changed. My life has changed I go to church, and I am a happy man and I want to thank you for what you did.’” Those moments bring Aguilar joy, knowing his change for the good has helped others find a similar path and bring good to the world. “Praise be to God who has not rejected my prayer or has not held his love from me.” Aguilar says he would have liked to keep going, but the walk in the new prison parking lot is just too much compared to the old facility. He estimates the walk is about a quarter of a mile and he’s afraid he’d fall down and hurt himself. Still though, prisoners call him on the phone to maintain communication.",

    "text": "[NPC1](/user/NPC1)a [laopiniondemalaga.es](/go/link/3973995) [#1](c1#c-1) no ha sido por el turismo.\nLo que ha impulsado a Málaga ha sido precisamente diversificar y atraer empresas tecnológicas al PTA que han aumentado mucho el sueldo de una parte de la población y ha traído a muchos extranjeros ( de los que gustan a la gente,rubitos) a vivir aquí con sueldazos.\nY se ha trastocado todo\n[#2](c2#c-2) Claro, seguro que los miles de viviendas de alquiler turístico ilegales que han puesto el precio del alquiler por las nubes no tienen nada que ver. Cuéntame más.\n[#5](c5#c-5) Pues no,no creo que en Málaga las viviendas turísticas sean un problema fuera del centro. Creo que se exagera ese problema al menos en Málaga\nEn Cártama o en Alhaurín no hay viviendas turísticas y sigue todo carísimo,hay una desigualdad clara entre el aumento d els población y la construcción de nuevas viviendas.\nY bueno en mi opinión lo que se debería es construir miles de viviendas para alquiler publico pero eso ya es imposible\n[#1](c1#c-1) [#2](c2#c-2) Malaga es posiblemente la ciudad de España con más crecimiento economico del pais en los ultimos 20 años. No me cabe en la cabeza la insistencia de Meneame en atacar a Malaga cuando es el ejemplo a seguir para el resto de ciudades. Por favor resto de ciudades dejad de crear empleo y atraer inversión, pudiendo ser Puertollano como se os ocurre intentar seguir el ejemplo de Malaga.\n[#5](c5#c-5) tampoco creo que el boom de Malaga sea por el turismo va mucho más allá. La provincia de Málaga, Marbella, Torremolinos... llevan viviendo del turismo decadas.",
