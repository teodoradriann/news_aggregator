    "text": "[Skip to main content](#main) In most African countries, drought forces rural communities to relocate, study finds Across most of Africa, drought is driving people who live in rural settlements closer to rivers and cities, according to a [new study](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023EF003510) published in the journal Earth's Future. Researchers from Sweden's Uppsala University and Italy's University of Bologna conducted a continent-wide analysis of human settlements in Africa and found drought drove migration in 80 per cent of African countries, but especially those in Southern Africa and the Horn of Africa. The study, \"Drought and Human Mobility in Africa,\" warns this human migration will likely intensify as climate change leads to more severe and frequent droughts. \"It's a cycle that exacerbates how many people are negatively impacted by drought, and not only in the ways we might normally expect,\" said Serena Ceola, a hydrologist at the University of Bologna and the study's lead author, in a media release. \"As regional climates change and both droughts and floods become bigger problems, more people will struggle to find a safe place to settle. People may move from one drought-affected place to another or move somewhere that just poses different climate risks.\" Ceola and her co-authors said they chose to study Africa because it is one of the most drought-prone continents and human migration is more prominent there compared to other parts of the world. They looked at the effects of droughts in 50 countries between 1992 and 2013. \"We want the whole society to be aware of just how many people are moving from one climate threat to another,\" Ceola said. In addition to contributing to overcrowding in urban centres, the study warns this large-scale drought-driven migration leaves more people vulnerable to deadly flooding events. For example, the [International Organization for Migration](https://www.iom.int/news/displacement-somalia-reaches-record-high-38-million-iom-deputy-director-general-calls-sustainable-solutions) reported earlier this year that the number of displaced people in Somalia had reached 3.8 million, partly due to ongoing drought conditions. Many of those climate refugees sought shelter near rivers where farming could resume, but the [UN Refugee Agency](https://www.unhcr.org/news/press-releases/over-1-million-people-internally-displaced-somalia-record-time) reports heavy rains and flash floods subsequently displaced more than half a million people. WHERE, AND WHY, DROUGHT MOVES PEOPLE Ceola and her co-authors found people facing drought conditions tend to move close to rivers so they can maintain access to water for agricultural activity, and to cities because they offer diverse economic opportunities when drought makes agriculture too difficult. The researchers used satellite-based nighttime light detection to track when settlements moved toward rivers during drought conditions, as well as annual, country-based World Bank census data to track populations in urban centres. However, they warned their results might underestimate the number of people forced to migrate due to droughts because settlements too small or poor to generate enough nighttime light for detection would have been left out of the study. During the period they studied, about half to three-quarters of the 50 countries included in the study had settlements move closer to rivers, and one-third to half of countries had urban populations grow. Seventeen countries experienced drought and up to 65 per cent of those countries saw increased human movement toward rivers during drought years when compared to pre-drought years. The cycle was especially strong in Burundi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe in Eastern Africa; Chad in Central Africa; Guinea and Guinea-Bissau in Western Africa; and Namibia and Swaziland in Southern Africa. In Southern Africa, every country studied saw drought-related migration toward rivers over the study period. While drought-caused migration leads to its own set of problems, Ceola and her co-authors write that human mobility and migration also \"represent increasingly important strategies\" for climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction as the climate crisis continues to reshape life for people around the world. \"Policy makers need data and detailed information in order to implement strategic planning, support sustainable development and increase the resilience of people living in vulnerable areas,\" Ceola said. \"Likewise, people living in those areas need to be aware of the risks and should have the opportunity to freely move to safer locations.\" [Shopping Trends](https://www.ctvnews.ca/shopping.html) The Shopping Trends team is independent of the journalists at CTV News.

    "text": "On ancient land, cracked and fissured by the ages and draped with just a veil of nutrient-poor soil, our Australian wildflowers demonstrate just how resilient, unique and extraordinary they are.\nSpringtime at the Muogamarra Nature Reserve, north of Sydney, is truly special. The native bush is bejewelled with flowers in dazzling colours and shapes not seen anywhere else in the world.\nThere are waratahs, angophoras, banksias, pink boronias and native orchids in abundance. Muogamarra also protects precious Aboriginal rock engravings and is home to echidnas, lyrebirds and other curious creatures. Wild things.- they make your heart sing!\nA visit to Muogamarra Nature Reserve, just north of Sydney, will have you marvelling at how our native vegetation can grow and thrive on so little soil.\nIt is closed most of the year to protect the fragile ecosystem and Indigenous cultural heritage. This nature reserve opens in spring annually for just six weeks. It has several walks, ranging from 1km to 10km, guided or unguided. Bookings are essential, and it can cost from $10-$55. For more information, head to\nVisit Muogomarra Nature Reserve[National Parks NSW].\n8 native wildflowers you’ll see in Muogamarra Nature Reserve\n01\nMountain devil\nLambertia formosa\nYou’ll attract pollinators and wildlife to your garden with the little mountain devil (Lambertia formosa). The flowers are brimful of nectar and the slightly spiky leaves provide cover for wildlife fleeing cats. It gets its unflattering moniker from the woody seed pods that look like a devil’s face.\n02\nNSW waratah\nTelopea speciosissima\nThink of the worst conditions to grow a flowering tree – shade and low-nutrient soil – and the spectacular NSW waratah will rise to the occasion.\n03\nWax flower\nEriostemon australasius\nPlant the pretty wax flower (Eriostemon australasius), with its profuse sprays of pink blooms, in a cottage garden, on the coast, or in a pot on a slightly shady balcony.\n04\nPink spider\nGrevillea sericea\nYou’ll see pink spider flowers (Grevillea sericea) in spring and they stay well into summer.\n05\nHairpin banksia\nB. spinulosa\nOne of the easiest native flowering plants to grow, the hairpin banksia (B. spinulosa) tolerates frost and seaspray. Its psychedelic lemon and orange blooms emerge in winter and last until spring.\n06\nBoronia\nBoronia\nThe tiny flowers of the boronia bush pack a punch of colour, and their leaves produce an exquisite, citrusy perfume. Plant it near an open door or window.\n07\nDrumsticks\nIsopogon anethifolius\nA brilliant example of Australia’s weird and wonderful wildflowers is drumsticks (Isopogon anethifolius). Try mass planting them.\n08\nJuniper wattle\nAcacia ulicifolia\nThe prickly foliage of juniper wattle (Acacia ulicifolia) gives cover to wildlife.",
