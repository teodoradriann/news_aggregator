    "text": "Can a rich person and a poor person be friends?\nTo answer the question directly: Yes, a rich person and a poor person can be friends. However, it can be challenging due to the differences in their financial situations.\n1. Does money matter in friendship?\nYes, money can easily cause conflicts and rifts among friends, especially when it comes to borrowing money or financial obligations.\n2. Do you think society will accept the friendship of rich and poor people?\nWhile many rich people tend to remain within their own circles, a study has shown that better mixing among people from different socio-economic backgrounds can help alleviate poverty.\n3. How do you form a friendship with rich people?\nNetworking events, charity events, and other activities can provide opportunities to meet and connect with rich individuals. Showing appreciation for their time and generosity can also help in developing a friendship.\n4. Can a rich person be nice?\nResearch has shown that richer people often act more generously with their time and money. However, it’s important to remember that kindness can be found in individuals from all socio-economic backgrounds.\n5. Why don’t rich people have poor friends?\nThis may vary depending on the individual, but some rich people may prefer to socialize within their own socio-economic group due to shared experiences and common interests.\n6. How can you tell if someone is rich?\nWhile there are no definitive signs, some subtle indicators of wealth can include valuing time, not talking about money, owning multiple properties, and having expensive hobbies.\n7. Is it rude to call someone rich?\nCalling someone rich can be perceived as offensive or judgemental, as people’s feelings about their wealth can vary. It’s best to avoid making assumptions about someone’s financial status and focus on other aspects of their personality or accomplishments.\n8. Can a rich man love a poor woman?\nA well-off man can develop genuine love for a woman regardless of her financial background. While financial differences may pose challenges, love and emotional connection can transcend socioeconomic status.\n9. How do rich people choose their friends?\nRich people tend to surround themselves with individuals who have similar habits, mental outlooks, work ethics, and shared traits. The saying “birds of a feather flock together” applies in this context.\n10. How do I overcome jealousy of rich friends?\nPracticing gratitude, spending less time comparing yourself on social media, re-evaluating your own relationship with money, and focusing on your own financial goals can help overcome feelings of jealousy towards rich friends.\n11. Why do some people remain poor?\nFactors such as lower savings, overspending, and limited opportunities can contribute to individuals remaining in poverty. It’s not a matter of laziness or lack of effort, but rather a systemic issue with social and economic inequalities.\n12. Is it better to be rich with no friends or poor with many friends?\nThis is subjective and depends on individual preferences. Some may value financial security and peace of mind over having a large social circle, while others prioritize companionship and support over monetary wealth.\n13. Why are some rich people unhappy?\nWealth does not guarantee happiness, and some wealthy individuals may still struggle with other aspects of their life. Material possessions and consumerism can sometimes negatively impact personal values and behaviors, leading to unhappiness.\n14. What is “Brokefishing”?\nBrokefishing refers to the act of positioning oneself as financially needy when it may not necessarily be the case, typically to attract attention or sympathy from others.\n15. Why does money ruin friendships?\nMoney can create misunderstandings and conflicts, especially when there are expectations of borrowing or lending. Disagreements over financial matters can strain friendships and lead to irreparable damage.\n16. Is it okay to help a friend financially?\nHelping a friend financially is a personal choice. However, it’s essential to set clear boundaries and be aware of the potential impact on the friendship. Loans should be given with the understanding that they may not be repaid, and both parties should be comfortable with this arrangement.\n17. What is the secret of rich people?\nRich people often have a long-term vision, set ambitious goals, and work consistently towards achieving them. They understand the significance of looking beyond immediate gains and focus on long-lasting objectives.\n18. What is a millionaire’s best friend?\nCompound growth, also known as compound interest, is often considered a millionaire’s best friend. It refers to the money made from the money already invested, leading to exponential growth.\n19. Do rich people socialize more?\nContrary to popular belief, individuals with higher incomes tend to spend less time socializing overall. However, socialization patterns can vary among individuals, and personal preferences play a significant role.\n20. What attracts a rich man to a woman?\nRich men can be attracted to women who are understanding and supportive of their lifestyle. Being able to put their interests first and showing appreciation are qualities that can be appealing.\n21. How to date a rich man when you are poor?\nBuilding a successful relationship requires effort and mutual understanding, regardless of financial differences. Open and honest communication, expressing appreciation, and enjoying the perks without guilt can contribute to a successful relationship.\n22. Can a rich man be depressed?\nYes, people from all socio-economic backgrounds can experience mental health conditions, including depression. While money may make certain aspects of life easier for a wealthy person, mental health and well-being are influenced by various factors beyond financial status.",

    "title": "Budd Joins Bipartisan Coalition Urging Biden to Strengthen Iran Sanctions Enforcement - U.S. Senator Ted Budd",
    "text": "Washington, D.C. — Senator Ted Budd (R-NC) has joined a bipartisan [coalition letter](https://www.rubio.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/01.31.24-Rubio-Hassan-Letter-to-POTUS-re-Iran-Oil-Sanctions.pdf) led by Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Maggie Hassan (D-NH) to President Biden calling on him to enforce current law and act against Iran’s illicit oil trade through sanctions. The Senators also encouraged support for proposed legislation pending in the U.S. Senate, including the bipartisan Stop Harboring Iranian Petroleum (SHIP) Act. The letter was co-signed by a total of 18 Senators including Sens. Jim Risch (R-ID), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Bob Casey (D-PA), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), John Fetterman (D-PA), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Catherine Cortez-Masto (D-NV), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Rick Scott (R-FL), Katie Boyd Britt (R-AL), Deb Fischer (R-NE), John Cornyn (R-TX), and Pete Ricketts (R-NE). Read the [full text](https://www.rubio.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/01.31.24-Rubio-Hassan-Letter-to-POTUS-re-Iran-Oil-Sanctions.pdf) of the letter: Dear Mr. President: We urge you to maximize your efforts to prevent illicit trade in Iranian oil by implementing and enforcing sanctions on ships, ports, and refineries that deal in Iranian oil. Our bipartisan Stop Harboring Iranian Petroleum Act, or SHIP Act, the End Iranian Terrorism Act, and other legislative proposals would deny Iran the financial resources it employs to attack U.S. forces and U.S. allies throughout the Middle East. We urge you to use all available authorities to proactively implement these sanctions while Congress considers enacting legislation. The barbaric October 7, 2023 attack on Israel was a stark reminder of the threats Iranian-backed terrorist groups pose to both Israelis and Americans, as well as the dangers inherent to appeasing the Islamic Republic of Iran. Iran directly enabled the October 7 attacks by funding, training, and equipping Hamas and Palestine Islamic Jihad. Moreover, Iranian funding has supported proxies such as Hezbollah in Lebanon, Shia militias in Iraq and Syria, and the Houthis in Yemen. In response to the October 7 attacks, and Iran’s subsequent mobilization of its terrorist proxy forces across the region, we urge your administration to take immediate action to deny the regime in Iran additional financial resources that it can use to continue supporting terrorism, destabilizing the Middle East, and ultimately harming Americans. These efforts should start by focusing on Iran’s expanding and lucrative illicit oil trade, which has increased over the last few years. The sanctions detailed in the SHIP and End IT Acts would help to strengthen existing sanctions, focusing on ships, ports, and refineries that permit transactions involving Iranian oil products. Iran is now exporting on average more than 1.4 million barrels of crude oil per day, two-thirds of which ends up in the People’s Republic of China. From February 2021 to October 2023, the regime has taken in at least $88 billion from these illicit oil exports. Iran is deriving significant economic benefits from pervasive sanctions evasion, with Iran’s economy growing by four percent annually and net foreign currency reserves also increasing by 45 percent from 2021 to 2023. Surging oil exports and increasing sanctions evasions enable Iran to increase its financial and material support for Hamas and other terrorist proxies, including Hezbollah, that threaten Israel. There is well-documented evidence that Iranian weapons were used by Hamas fighters in the October 7 attack. Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of State assesses that Iran also provides Hezbollah with hundreds of millions of dollars each year, with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant estimating annual Iranian support for Hezbollah exceeds $700 million. Strengthening sanctions on Iranian oil is especially critical in light of the ongoing attacks on U.S. forces across the Middle East by Iranian-backed groups. According to the U.S. Department of Defense, there have been more than 140 attacks on U.S. troops in the region since October 7, 2023, most recently resulting in the tragic deaths of three U.S. servicemembers and dozens of injuries this past weekend. These attacks are directly enabled by the financial and military support Iran provides to militias and other groups in Iraq and Syria. Additionally, since October 7, Iranian-backed Houthis have launched missiles and suicide drones at Israeli civilians from Yemen, shot down a U.S. MQ-9 Reaper surveillance drone over international waters, and hijacked cargo ships. The Houthis, enabled by the Iranian regime, have crippled the free flow of commerce in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. In the wake of the October 7 terror attacks and subsequent attacks by Iran-backed proxies on U.S. forces in the Middle East, we urge you to work harder to stop Iran’s funneling of lucrative oil exports to finance terror. These exports provide a crucial lifeline to sustain and expand Iran’s sponsorship of terrorist groups whose objective is to harm U.S. interests in the Middle East and to destroy our ally, Israel. Accordingly, we call on you to immediately take additional action to stop Iran’s illicit oil trade. Specifically, we urge you to sanction ships transporting Iranian petroleum products as well as the foreign ports and refineries that knowingly accept those products. Thank you for your attention to this important matter. ###",

    "text": "El gobierno de Bolivia presentó este jueves a 17 militares que presuntamente participaron en el [ \"intento de golpe de Estado\" contra Luis Arce](https://www.radioformula.com.mx/mundo/2024/6/27/golpe-de-estado-en-bolivia-medios-bolivianos-senalan-montaje-para-elevar-popularidad-del-presidente-822196.html) y afirmó que está detrás de varios prófugos que planificaron y ejecutaron esas acciones bajo las órdenes del destituido jefe militar Juan José Zúñiga. \"Se ha logrado la aprehensión de un total de 17 personas por haber intentado consumar un golpe de Estado\", declaró el ministro de Gobierno (Interior), Eduardo del Castillo, en una rueda de prensa en la que exhibió a los detenidos. Del Castillo presentó un organigrama en el que se estableció la participación de varios militares, incluso, algunos en el servicio pasivo, que planificaron \"desde el mes de mayo\" la intervención en la plaza Murillo, en La Paz, sede de los poderes Ejecutivo y Legislativo. Militares involucrados Explicó que estos militares formaban parte de un plan conformado por cuatro grupos. Uno de \"preparación y planificación\", otro de \"organización y coordinación\", de \"ejercicio y fuerza\" y \"consolidación del poder\". El ministro enfatizó que el líder de la toma fue Zúñiga y que el \"articulador\" fue el también destituido y detenido comandante de la Armada Juan Arnez, apoyados por un civil considerado como uno de los \"ideólogos\" del plan. Justamente esta última persona, en el momento de su presentación ante los medios, dijo que se declaraba en \"huelga de hambre seca\" porque supuestamente se le habían \"vulnerado\" sus derechos y no se le permitió su defensa. Del Castillo dijo que entre los investigados y detenidos está el comandante del Regimiento Colorados de Bolivia, división militar encargada de la seguridad presidencial. Además del encargado del cuartel de Viacha, municipio cercano a La Paz, desde donde el domingo salieron los vehículos blindados que en la víspera tomaron la plaza Murillo, y el jefe del cuartel de la población rural de Achacachi que debía aportar el armamento para consumar la operación. El trabajo de inteligencia interna que no detectó la acción militar y el rol del excomandante en jefe de las Fuerzas Armadas \"son aspectos que están siendo investigados\", mencionó el ministro. Anuncian más detenciones de militares bolivianos Del Castillo sostuvo que \"el principal objetivo\" de su despacho y de la Policía es \"la aprehensión de todos los miembros\" del grupo que \"planificó la comisión del golpe de Estado\". Entre los buscados están tres militares en servicio pasivo y un mayor del Ejército, a quien se atribuyó la coordinación de las acciones en la sede del Ejecutivo y Legislativo. El ministro dijo que se analiza incluir el tipo penal de \"destrucción y deterioro de bienes del estado\", por el uso de la tanqueta que derribó el portón del Palacio de Gobierno, que se suma a otros como alzamiento armado, atentado contra el presidente y terrorismo. La tarde de este miércoles, Bolivia pasó por horas de zozobra cuando un grupo de militares fuertemente armados se tomó la plaza y desplegaron tanques, bajo las órdenes de Zúñiga. Antes de su detención, el exjefe militar declaró a los medios que buscaba \"reconstruir la democracia\" y que su primera acción sería liberar a los \"presos políticos\". Arce relevó de inmediato a todo el alto mando militar y después los uniformados abandonaron la plaza en medio de insultos, golpes y reproches de los cientos de funcionarios del Gobierno y de seguidores que celebraron que el presidente resistió a un \"intento de golpe de Estado\". La comunidad internacional condenó estos hechos, mientras que la oposición y los seguidores del expresidente Evo Morales, afirmaron que fue un \"autogolpe\" planificado por Arce.",
