    "text": "Ludhiana: Contractual staff to protest over unpaid salaries on December 2\nThe protest by the contractual workers of Ludhiana’s civil hospital is being organised under the banner of the ‘User Charges Employees Struggle Committee’\nContractual workers of the civil hospital have announced a “semi-nude” protest in front of the deputy commissioner’s office here on December 2 to protest non-payment of salaries for the past two months. Contractual workers and also those hired under the ‘user charges’ category have been repeatedly petitioning higher authorities to revise their ₹4,500- ₹6,500 salaries to at least the minimum wage set by the deputy commissioner.\nThey have sent memorandums to higher officials of the department and also the health minister. The protest is being organised under the banner of the ‘User Charges Employees Struggle Committee’. The workers are calling for immediate action to release their pending salaries and address their longstanding demands for better working conditions.\n“The delay in our wages has pushed us into extreme hardship,” said Raj Kumar, a representative of the struggle committee. “With such meager salaries, survival is already challenging. The non-payment has further worsened our situation. We are resorting to this form of protest to make our voices heard,” he said.\nThese workers say they are responsible for essential services at the hospital, but “neglected” by the administration. Despite raising concerns multiple times, no concrete action has been taken to resolve the issue. The workers argue that lack of timely payments not only affect their personal lives but also hinders their ability to perform their duties effectively, ultimately impacting the hospital’s functioning.\nThe semi-nude protest aims to draw public and administration’s attention to their plight. The User Charges Employees Struggle Committee has stated that if their demands are not addressed promptly, they will intensify their protest.\n[News](https://www.hindustantimes.com)/\n[Cities](https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities)/\n[Chandigarh](https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news)/ Ludhiana: Contractual staff to protest over unpaid salaries on December 2",

    "title": "Iranian initiative in Israel enlists Persian speakers to fight antisemitism",
    "text": "NEDA AMIN participates in a ‘Free Iran’ rally in Jerusalem in January 2018.\nThe Merage Foundation has started a new initiative that enlists the services of Persian-speaking volunteers to combat antisemitism, the organization announced on Sunday.\nThe initiative was established as part of its global effort against antisemitism. Sigal Aferiat Cohen, a project manager at the Merage Foundation Israel who initiated the effort, fled Iran in her childhood. During the early days of the war that followed the October 7 events, when social media was flooded with posts and shares from both sides, Israel recognized the crucial need for public diplomacy regarding what was happening and continues to happen.\nTo speak their language When Sigal found herself responding alone in Persian to Iranians on social media, she understood the real need for Persian public diplomacy, assuming that messages in the Persian language would appear more objective compared to messages in English and might personally impact those exposed Iranians.\n“In the first two weeks of the war, I found myself responding in Persian to growing hate-filled groups on Telegram. I realized that I was like a drop in the ocean and needed to recruit more Persian speakers to join me. The overwhelming response exceeded all my expectations, and since then, our work hasn’t stopped. We are happy to receive more volunteers willing to join us. I believe in the importance of this system and its contribution to Israel’s legitimacy worldwide, specifically in Iran,” she stated.\nDemonstrators hold antisemitic symbols and signs as they protest outside the Tampa Convention Center, where Turning Point USA’s Student Action Summit was being held, in Tampa, Florida on July 23, 2022.

(credit: MARCO BELLO/REUTERS)\nShe later added, “I believe that the initiative has a significant impact on a population that has hardly been in touch with Israel. Disseminating the truth is of great importance.”\nLeading by example The Merage Foundation has been supporting Iranian Jewish immigrants to Israel for the past 25 years and helping them integrate and thrive in Israeli society. Today, this community has become a beacon of hope and philanthropy in Israel.\nAfter the catastrophic events of October 7, the foundation quickly recruited hundreds of Iranian Israeli volunteers who were Persian speakers and were eager to combat antisemitism. The volunteers received training from the organization ‘Stand With Us’ and began their operations. Official Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, Instagram, and Telegram pages were opened in Persian, sharing translated public diplomacy content. Additionally, the volunteers created customized independent content.\nThe initiative gained momentum and currently consists of approximately 450 persian speaking volunteers and has even started actively recruiting volunteers from around the world. The volunteers undergo various training sessions along the way, forming a unique public diplomacy community in Israel that strengthens the national effort and targets a population that has been alienated from Israel for decades and often exposed to lies and hatred content towards it. All of this is done with an understanding of the importance of exposing the truth and the Israeli narrative to this population.",

Eso [Xiaomi ](https://www.fayerwayer.com/moviles/2023/09/24/versatilidad-a-toda-prueba-asi-es-la-nueva-redmi-pad-se-de-xiaomi/)lo sabe bien, ya que en los últimos años ha estado innovando con todo tipo de aparatos electrónicos. Tal es el caso de su nuevo SU7, un vehículo eléctrico con el que planean entrar a lo grande al negocio automotriz. Y es que la revelación de este automóvil marca un hito significativo en la estrategia de la empresa, que aspira a ser uno de los cinco principales fabricantes de automóviles del mundo en los próximos 15 a 20 años. Un vehículo ambicioso: Así es el Xiaomi SU7 Según [Xiaomi](https://c.mi.com/global/post/677336), el SU7 no es sólo un vehículo, sino que se define como una extensión del ecosistema tecnológico de la firma. De partida, incorpora el sistema operativo [HyperOS](https://www.fayerwayer.com/moviles/2023/10/26/xiaomi-14-presentada-la-nueva-linea-de-la-marca-con-pantallas-de-3000-nits-y-camaras-de-apertura-variable/), diseñado para integrarse perfectamente con una amplia gama de dispositivos Xiaomi, incluidos IoT, televisores, altavoces, y más. Este sistema operativo es el cerebro detrás del SU7, capaz de gestionar tanto los sistemas de info-entretenimiento como la conducción autónoma. El SU7, también denominado “Speed Ultra”, estará disponible en dos versiones; la primera con el motor HyperEngine V6 y la otra con un HyperEngine V6S, que ofrecen potencias impresionantes de 295 CV y 663 CV respectivamente. Su autonomía, en tanto, varía entre 1.000 y 1.200 kilómetros, dependiendo de la batería seleccionada. HyperOS: Más que un sistema operativo Sin dudas el lanzamiento de HyperOS representa un gran avance, tanto en términos de vehículos eléctricos como también en la integración de la tecnología en la vida cotidiana. Este sistema operativo permite una conexión instantánea con otros aparatos, permitiendo acceder y controlar aplicaciones móviles directamente desde el sistema del SU7. Con una pantalla de 16,1 pulgadas y resolución 3K, HyperOS también permite la visualización de parámetros de conducción y la gestión de otros dispositivos conectados. Xiaomi contra Tesla: ¿Una competencia real? Por supuesto que Xiaomi no compite solo, ya que la compañía se enfrenta a un mercado de vehículos eléctricos dominado directamente por [ Tesla](https://www.fayerwayer.com/entretenimiento/2023/12/03/el-cybertruck-de-tesla-ya-esta-aqui-conoce-su-precio/). Así que tras el lanzamiento del SU7, Xiaomi entrará en este mercado y, según su [comunicado](https://c.mi.com/global/post/677336) oficial, intentará reinventarlo gracias a su amplia gama de tecnologías. El tiempo dirá si el SU7 logra establecerse como un serio competidor de Tesla y si logrará su objetivo de ser uno de los principales fabricantes de automóviles del mundo. Por ahora, estaremos atentos a su fecha de lanzamiento para contarles todos los detalles oportunamente.",

    "text": "In an action involving manufacturers of a self-sealing dining mat for toddlers, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed a district court’s finding that the defendants were barred from obtaining relief on their counterclaims under the unclean hands doctrine, thereby vacating the district court’s other findings on inequitable conduct, obviousness, attorneys’ fees and costs. Luv N’ Care, Ltd. et al. v. Laurain et al., Case No. 22-1905 (Fed. Cir. Apr. 12, 2024) (Reyna, Hughes, Stark, JJ.)\nLuv N’ Care and Nouri E. Hakim (collectively, LNC) filed suit against Lindsey Laurain and Eazy-PZ (EZPZ), asserting various claims for unfair competition under the Lanham Act and Louisiana law. LNC also sought declaratory judgment that EZPZ’s design patent was invalid, unenforceable and not infringed. After the suit was filed, the US Patent & Trademark Office (PTO) issued Laurain a utility patent directed toward self-sealing dining mats. Laurain subsequently assigned her rights to EZPZ, which then asserted counterclaims for utility patent, design patent and trademark infringement.\nFollowing discovery, the district court granted LNC’s motion for summary judgment, finding all claims of EZPZ’s utility patent as obvious in view of three prior art references. EZPZ moved for reconsideration, which the district court denied, indicating that a “ruling providing further reasoning will follow in due course.” Before any such ruling issued, the PTO issued an ex parte reexamination certificate confirming the patentability of the utility patent claims two days before the district court’s bench trial began.\nEZPZ did not provide this reexam certificate to the district court prior to the bench trial. During the bench trial, the district court found that EZPZ had not committed inequitable conduct but that EZPZ’s litigation conduct constituted unclean hands. After the district court entered judgment, EZPZ moved for reconsideration of summary judgment based on the ex parte reexamination certificate. The district court denied this motion and found that the evidence did not compel alteration of the prior ruling that the utility patent was invalid. It also denied LNC’s motion for attorneys’ fees and costs. EZPZ appealed.\nThe Federal Circuit affirmed the unclean hands determination but vacated the district court’s rulings on inequitable conduct, invalidity, attorneys’ fees and costs. As to unclean hands, the Court reasoned that EZPZ failed to disclose patent applications related to the utility patent until well after the close of discovery and dispositive motion practice. EZPZ also blocked LNC’s efforts to discover Laurain’s prior art searches by falsely claiming that she had conducted no such searches and that all responsive documents had been produced. It further found that EZPZ witnesses, including Laurain and EZPZ’s former outside counsel, repeatedly gave evasive testimony during depositions and at trial. The Court affirmed the district court’s determination that EZPZ’s misconduct bore an immediate and necessary connection to EZPZ’s claims for infringement because the undisclosed material was directly relevant to the development of LNC’s litigation strategy and undermined LNC’s ability to press its invalidity and unenforceability challenges. The Court found no clear error in the district court’s reasoning that EZPZ’s unclean hands concerning the utility patent affected EZPZ’s other counterclaims because “[t]he Court’s loss of confidence in a party’s candor cannot be overcome with respect to other theories of recovery.”\nAs to inequitable conduct, the Federal Circuit concluded that the district court’s opinion did not provide sufficient clarity on whether it made findings concerning affirmative egregious misconduct and per se materiality – that is, whether the PTO would not have granted the utility patent “but for” EZPZ’s misrepresentation. The Court also reasoned that the district court erred in considering EZPZ’s individual acts of misconduct in isolation when evaluating Laurain’s deceptive intent when it should have evaluated these acts in the aggregate.\nThe Federal Circuit also vacated the summary judgment finding that the utility patent was invalid as obvious, explaining that it was erroneous for the district court to find a lack of genuine dispute of material fact by “ignoring, dismissing, or discounting the probative value of the reexamination evidence in the record.” The Court held that the district court improperly resolved genuine disputes of material fact concerning the scope of disclosure of the prior art references and that a reasonable fact finder might find that EZPZ established objective indicia of nonobviousness, such as the finding that LNC copied EZPZ’s technology and that EZPZ’s product embodying the utility patent claims enjoyed commercial success.\nFinally, the Federal Circuit vacated the finding that the case was not exceptional under 35 U.S.C. § 285. The Court determined that the district court erred by failing to declare LNC as the prevailing party even though EZPZ was barred by unclean hands from obtaining relief from LNC. The Court also reasoned that the case was “far from over” given its decision to remand for further proceedings on obviousness and inequitable conduct, which made it impossible to assess the totality of circumstances (as required to find exceptional case and award attorneys’ fees). It reached the same conclusion concerning LNC’s request for costs.\n[View source.]\nSee more »\nDISCLAIMER: Because of the generality of this update, the information provided herein may not be applicable in all situations and should not be acted upon without specific legal advice based on particular situations.\n© McDermott Will & Emery\nRefine your interests »",
