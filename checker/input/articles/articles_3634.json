    "text": "Ubisoft has decided to delay \"Assassin's Creed Shadows\" [again](https://www.player.one/ubisoft-comments-allegations-abuse-now-closed-assassins-creed-shadows-support-studio-159596), now moving it to a March 2025 release window as the studio suffers more internal issues.\nThe situation comes as the developer is said to be struggling with financials, continued cost cuts, and rumors of preparing to be sold off to Chinese video game company Tencent.\nInvestors held an emergency conference where they grilled CEO Yves Guillemot and CFO Frederick Duguet.\nUbisoft Delays Assassin's Creed Shadows Again\nThe investors wanted to get answers from the two regarding all of the issues that Ubisoft was suffering from to get a clear picture of what was actually happening. However, Guillemot and Duguet did not provide them with much reassurance.\nThe latest call also apparently confirmed somewhat that the company is preparing to sell, or at least strongly considering it. In a press release, Ubisoft has \"appointed leading advisors to review and pursue various transformational strategic and capitalistic options.\"\nThese efforts would be made to extract the best value for stakeholders moving forward and into the future. The process will apparently be overseen by the [independent](https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-investors-grill-ceo-cfo-on-potential-tencent-sale-delays-and-financial-woes) members of the Board of Directors, according to IGN.\nThe company will inform the market in accordance with applicable regulations if and when an actual transaction materializes.\nThe situation comes after a report in October 2024 noted that Ubisoft's founding Guillemot family and shareholder Tencent were talking about taking the studio private.\nVarious Internal Woes\nThe consideration was being made because of high-profile video game flops, game cancellations, and the drop in the studio's share price. The talks at the time were said to be exploratory only, but the latest update seems much more serious.\nGuillemot said recently that they are convinced there are several potential ways for them to generate value from the company's assets and franchises. His [comments](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/09/ubisoft-appoints-advisors-to-explore-options-after-buyout-report.html) were made to address the firm's strategic plan that was recently shared, CNBC said.\nIn the past 12 months, Ubisoft's shares have plummeted by 45%, and many people have been criticizing the company for its lackluster releases. There have also been doubts about the studio's strategic direction.\nThe drop in share price came following the soft performance of \"Star Wars Outlaws\" and the discontinuation of PvP shooter \"XDefiant\" in December 2024. Additionally, the company laid off nearly 300 people last year.\nThe company issued a statement beforehand saying that it would continue to drive significant cost reductions along with a highly selective approach to investments.\nIt was expected to reduce its \"fixed cost base\" by [about](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-march-as-ubisofts-board-consider-a-company-sale) $206 million for the fiscal year 2025-2026, according to Rock Paper Shotgun.",

Rybakina's withdrawal spot is taken by Caroline Garcia. The withdrawals cast a shadow over the tournament at Roland Garros. [Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| Updated: 26-07-2024 03:22 IST | Created: 26-07-2024 03:22 IST The Olympic tennis competition suffered a significant setback as women's third seed Elena Rybakina joined a lengthy list of non-starters due to illness, just hours after the draw took place at Roland Garros on Thursday. The big-serving 25-year-old Kazakh was scheduled to face Romania's Jaqueline Cristian in the first round of the singles. 'It is difficult for me to announce this, but unfortunately, I will not be able to participate in the Paris Olympics. After Wimbledon, I contracted acute bronchitis, and despite trying to return to training, my body has yet to recover. The doctors have strictly forbidden me from going to court,' Rybakina posted on Instagram. Rybakina's withdrawal means that France's Caroline Garcia moves into her spot in the draw as the 17th seed, while Australia's Daria Saville enters the draw as an alternate. With the action to begin on Saturday, the flurry of high-profile withdrawals has cast a cloud over the tournament being staged on the Parisian clay. Additionally, men's world number one and top seed Jannik Sinner of Italy had to withdraw from the singles and doubles because of illness, while Danish youngster Holger Rune also pulled out on Wednesday with a wrist injury. Czech player Marketa Vondrousova, who was runner-up in the singles in Tokyo, withdrew because of injury, as did Poland's Hubert Hurkacz due to a knee injury from Wimbledon. Switzerland's Belinda Bencic, the champion in Tokyo, is absent after giving birth in April. Two-time Olympic singles champion Andy Murray announced before Thursday's draw that he was not fit enough to compete in the singles but would still play doubles with Dan Evans. Other notable absences from the tennis at the Games include world number three Aryna Sabalenka, Tunisia's Ons Jabeur, Britain's Emma Raducanu, American Ben Shelton, and Tokyo men's bronze medal winner Pablo Carreno Busta of Spain.

    "text": "金融界 6 月 18 日消息 58 同城被爆大规模裁员，裁员比例达 20% - 30%！\n近日在脉脉平台，多名认证为 58 同城员工的用户爆料，公司正开展大规模裁员，裁员比例达 20% - 30%，波及 TEG、LBG 等多个部门。赔偿方案为 N+1，公司未提前给出任何预警。有员工称，整个裁员流程 \" 极为迅速 \"，上午还在就项目进度开会，下午便接到人力资源部门的约谈通知。\n公开数据显示，58 同城员工总数最多的时候约为 4 万名员工，该公司旗下业务基本覆盖招聘、房产、二手车、本地生活等多个广泛领域。\n58 同城盈利能力并不乐观\n值得注意的是，自在 58 同城私有化后，其资产盈利能力并不乐观，姚劲波频频的资本运作也不顺利。2021 年，踏上美股 IPO 征程的天鹅到家撤回了 IPO 申请。当年，赴港上市的安居客 IPO 计划也搁浅。2022 年，快狗打车顺利在港交所挂牌。从公开信息看，这些资产盈利能力均不算理想，经营承压明显。受贝壳挤压等因素影响，安居客的市场份额减少。与货拉拉、滴滴打车相比，快狗打车的市占率处于弱势，且公司持续亏损。2023 年、2024 年，快狗打车营业收入分别为 7.56 亿元、6.60 亿元，同比下降 3.03%、12.31%；归母净利润分别亏损 11 亿元、1.93 亿元，尚未实现盈利。而作为大股东之一的阿里，也自 2023 年 11 月起逐步减持快狗打车股份。\n2022 年 10 月，姚劲波在 58 同城内部发表了《致全体同学的一封信》，叠加经济环境、整体消费信心影响，58 同城主营业务受到了冲击，他要求在 2023 年，58 同城的所有业务、在所有城市都要盈利，或者有确定的目标和趋势出现，否则这项业务就会很危险。\n2023 年 5 月份，58 同城也被曝出大规模裁员。当时，脉脉上多名认证为 58 同城员工的用户表示，58 同城正在进行一波大裁员，比例高达 30%～50%，赔偿采用 N+1 模式。据第一财经报道的数据，当时 58 同城的员工有大约 3 万人。如果按照传闻的 30%~50% 比例裁撤，那么将有 700010000 名员工受到影响。\n今年初，姚劲波的内部信已为这场裁员埋下伏笔。他明确要求 \" 砍掉年内不能实现盈利的业务 \"，并强调 \" 不好的业务要收缩，该关停并转的要关停并转 \"。\n财报显示，2024 年第四季度，58 同城净亏损 1970 万美元。值得一提的是，虽然第四季度营收为 3.066 亿美元，同比增长 28.5%，但运营支出高达 2.471 亿美元。\n刚进军 A 股买壳\n最近，姚劲波在 A 股再次掀起波澜。\n6 月 3 日晚间，易明医药公告称，公司控股股东、实际控制人高帆与北京福好企业管理合伙企业（有限合伙）签署了《股份转让协议》，高帆拟将其持有的 23% 公司股份转让给北京福好，转让价格为 15.10 元 / 股，总转让价款为 6.62 亿元。\n公告显示，北京福好实际控制人为姚劲波。易明医药公告显示，姚劲波拥有快狗打车 38.61% 的受控法团持有权益。截至报告书签署日，除快狗打车外，姚劲波不存在在境内、境外其他上市公司拥有权益的股份达到或超过该公司已发行股份 5% 的情况。\n公开资料显示，58 同城是快狗打车第一大股东，姚劲波是 58 同城董事长兼 CEO。市场人士分析称，姚劲波可能会将 58 集团（58 同城升级后）注入易明医药，实现整体上市，\" 美股私有化已经 4 年多，优化整合后，还是值得期待。\"\n姚劲波身价高达 59 亿元\n姚劲波 1976 年出生，毕业于中国海洋大学，获得计算机应用及化学双学位。当年，他创立了以域名注册交易为主的 \" 易域网 \"。\n2000 年初，姚劲波从中国银行山东分行辞职，南下创业。当年 9 月，易域网被万网收购，姚劲波挣得了人生第一桶金。2001 年，姚劲波与金鑫、李如彬三人共同创立学大教育。2005 年，姚劲波再度创业，创立了分类信息网站 58 同城，覆盖招聘、房产、二手车等商品交易、搬家保洁等生活服务多项服务。2011 年，58 同城以第 91 名冲进谷歌的全球 TOP100 强网站榜单中，成为国内最大的分类信息型网站，在世界上仅次于 Craigslist，排名全球第二。2013 年 10 月，成立 8 年的 58 同城以每股 17 美元的价格发行 1100 万股 ADS，正式登陆纽交所挂牌上市。凭借于此，姚劲波在 2014 年登上当年的胡润百富榜，以 45 亿元身家，与徐小平等人并列第 476 位。2015 年，姚劲波以换股方式吸并了竞争对手赶集网，结束广告消耗战，统一分类信息市场。此后，姚劲波相继将安居客、中华英才网等收入囊中，构建本地生活服务平台。\n但是 58 集团很快走起了下坡路。2015 年至 2020 年，58 同城的营收增速持续下滑，其股价也在 2018 年后开始连年下跌，2020 年 9 月，58 同城宣告从纽交所退市。最新的 2024 年的胡润百富榜显示，姚劲波以 59 亿元身家，排名第 918 位。\n本文源自：金融界\n作者：大江",

    "text": "LAHAINA, Hawaii -- On August 8, 2023, damaging wind-driven wildfires hit Maui. The historic town of Lahaina suffered devastating damage as a result; however, one popular oceanfront restaurant survived the destruction.\nMala Ocean Tavern is a beloved spot with breathtaking ocean views and a colorful menu of delicious dishes and cocktails.\nThe space luckily avoided complete destruction, yet faced several challenges before successfully reopening to the public this year.\n\"I came down just crying like I can't believe this is really here, like it's still here,\" remembered Caleb Hopkins, the Co-Owner of the Mala Ocean Tavern as he recalled the aftermath of the fire. \"It was a miracle, it's like the little restaurant that could, you know.\"\n\"The first thing on our mind is our people, where are they? Are they okay? Have we lost anybody, let's take care of our people first and figure all that out,\" added Javier Barberi, the Co-Owner of Mala Ocean Tavern. \"Once all that kind of started getting a little bit more organized...and everyone got what they needed, then we started focusing on Mala and the business in the restaurant.\"\nFrom securing power and water to cleaning the space and replacing fundamental structures, there were many hurdles to overcome. Today, the tavern once again serves its iconic seafood and farm-to-table, regional cuisine.\n\"Just getting our business open, we didn't know what it was going to be like,\" expressed Ashley Davis, the Co-Owner of the Mala Ocean Tavern. \"Our community has come out in full force to support us, and it's just really wonderful seeing all those familiar faces.\"\nDavis added, \"We don't want to forget either, we want to honor everyone who was lost and we want to honor our community and Lahaina.\"\nDavid Fincher is also a Co-Owner and helps bring warmth and support to the staff and customers at this oceanside gem.\nThe restaurant extends its aloha to visitors through an unforgettable dining experience while offering support to the Maui community.\nMala Ocean Tavern is taking donations through their\nGoFundMe to assist those on the restaurant's hospitality staff who have lost their homes.\nFor more information, visit\nhere.",

    "text": "Although Rick and Morty ’s spinoff was blamed for breaking a major rule of the original show, the series itself already got away with breaking this same infamous rule earlier. Rick and Morty: The Anime was released in August 2024 and the Rick and Morty spinoff earned a dispiriting reception. Rick and Morty: The Anime’s failure could be chalked up to the differences between the anime adaptation’s sense of humor and the original show’s unique comedy style. However, it didn’t help that Rick and Morty: The Anime also wasn’t a traditional spinoff in terms of its premise and main characters. While its first episode didn’t pick up where Rick and Morty season 7’s ending left off, Rick and Morty: The Anime does share the same main characters as the original show. Most successful spinoffs, from Frasier to Young Sheldon, take a character or two from the original show and transplant them into a new setting. In contrast, Rick and Morty: The Anime features Rick, Morty, Jerry, Beth, and Summer as its heroes. This similarity made the show too similar to its predecessor to feel original, but too tonally different to feel like an organic offshoot of Rick and Morty. [Related ](/rick-and-morty-halloween-episode-never-why-sitcom-trope/) [ I Can’t Believe Rick And Morty Has Never Done This Type Of Episode All Other Sitcoms Have ](/rick-and-morty-halloween-episode-never-why-sitcom-trope/) Rick and Morty has never indulged in one sitcom staple that seems uniquely well suited to the series, and I can't wait for the show to finally do so. Rick and Morty: The Anime Isn’t Rick and Morty’s First Time Travel Plot The Series Famously Refused To Do Time Travel Stories But Season 4 Features One Although some critics noted that Rick and Morty: The Anime’s first episode broke one of the original show’s cardinal rules, this particular criticism is not quite fair. Rick and Morty featured a time travel storyline before Rick and Morty: The Anime’s first episode, despite its creators and Rick claiming the show would never engage with the infamously convoluted sci-fi staple. In season 4, episode 5, “Rattlestar Ricklactica,” Rick and Morty were forced to resort to time travel to stop sentient snakes from taking over the galaxy and rewriting history. This absurd plot proves Rick and Morty occasionally includes time travel. Rick and Morty ’s co-creators Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland both claimed the series wouldn’t explore time travel. Rick and Morty’s co-creators Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland both claimed the series wouldn’t explore time travel, since the sci-fi story staple had been historically overused in the genre. As such, Rick and Morty: The Anime beginning with an exploration of the theme seemed to prove the disparity between the two shows. However, it is only fair to note that Rick and Morty itself also played fast and loose with this rule. Many classic episodes of Rick and Morty work precisely because they play with the show’s usual formula, and “Rattlestar Ricklactica” is no different in this regard. Why Rick and Morty: The Anime’s Time Travel Story Was Less Successful Rick and Morty’s Spinoff Failed To Recapture The Original Show’s Tone “Rattlestar Ricklactica” embraces the silliness and inherent contradictions of time travel stories, never taking itself too seriously and using most of the episode’s story to point out the problems with other time travel plots. In contrast, Rick and Morty: The Anime’s time travel plot was a more straightforward example of the sci-fi subgenre. This goes some way to explaining why Rick and Morty’s spinoff failed to replicate the original show’s critical success. Rick and Morty might break its own rules from time to time, but the show still knows how to hold onto a consistent, unique tone despite this.

    "text": "UN experts concerned about new law on freedom of conscience and religious organisations in Belarus UN experts* [expressed](https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/02/belarus-un-experts-concerned-about-new-law-freedom-conscience-and-religious) grave concern about recent amendments to Belarusian legislation on freedom of conscience and the activities of religious organisations, which appear to contravene Belarus’ obligations under international human rights law. The law “on amending laws on the activities of religious organisations” (No. 334-Z) was adopted by the Upper House of the National Assembly of the Republic of Belarus on 13 December 2023 and signed by the President on 30 December 2023. On 28 August 2023, the experts had sent a communication ( [BLR 7/2023](https://spcommreports.ohchr.org/TMResultsBase/DownLoadPublicCommunicationFile?gId=28342)) to the Government of Belarus expressing concerns about several provisions of the draft law, which remains unanswered to date. “The provisions on compulsory registration unduly restrict the right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief,” the UN experts said, stressing that they are in contradiction with Article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, as highlighted by the Human Rights Committee during its last review of Belarus’s periodic review in 2018. The experts noted that the law prohibits the activities of unregistered religious organisations, following up on 2022 amendments of the Criminal Code which criminalised the organisation of and participation in unregistered public associations, religious organisations or funds. The law subjects all religious organisations to mandatory State registration and requires existing organisations to re-register within a limited timeframe to avoid becoming illegal. “The law establishes broad yet imprecise legal grounds for the State to suspend and dissolve religious organisations, such as conducting an activity directed against the main direction of domestic and foreign policy of the Republic of Belarus, discrediting the Republic of Belarus, humiliating the national honour, engaging in political activities or other undefined extremist activities,” they said, reminding that anti-extremist legislation has been used in recent years to repress and harass all those holding dissenting opinions, including people criticising Belarus’ support to Russia’s aggression of Ukraine. The experts warned that the law imposes extensive State control over religious education and literature, stipulating that religious education, religious literature or any other material with religious content must not contradict “the generally recognised traditional values of the Belarusian people and the ideology of the Belarusian State”. “We are concerned that the vague terms contained in the law are likely to encourage arbitrary decision-making and create a climate of intimidation for religious leaders, communities or activities deemed to be unwelcome by governing authorities,” the experts said. The law stipulates that religious organisations can only be led by Belarusian citizens with permanent residence in the country, which appears to discriminate against certain religions. The experts reminded that according to publicly available data, more than 70 clergy and religious leaders have been persecuted, forced to flee the country or subjected to other forms of pressure, reportedly for political reasons, since August 2020. “The law appears to be aimed at further strengthening the overarching control of the State over all aspects of the existence of religious communities, which could have serious implications for the enjoyment of freedom of religion or belief, freedom of peaceful assembly and association, and other human rights in the country,” the experts said.",

    "text": "The holiday season has been in full swing all around Eorzea in Final Fantasy XIV, and while Christmas may have now come and gone, it’s still important to ring in the new year in the biggest and most fantastical way possible with the annual Heavensturn in-game event right around the corner. With plenty of celebration and an adorable new reward awaiting each and every Warrior of Light, you’ll certainly want to make sure to log in for this special occasion. If you’re wondering what exactly to expect with this New Years-style bonanza, here is our handy little guide to the FFXIV Heavensturn Event 2023, with all details and rewards. Where to Unlock the FFXIV Heavensturn Event Quest & Rewards This year’s annual Heavensturn event will kick off promptly on Dec 31, 2023 @ 7AM (PST), as soon as the [Starlight Celebration](https://twinfinite.net/guides/ffxiv-starlight-celebration-2023-all-details-rewards/) event ends (make sure you don’t miss that one!). As with all seasonal in-game events in [Final Fantasy XIV](https://twinfinite.net/news/everything-revealed-during-ffxiv-fan-fest-london/), this one will start with a Level 15 quest in one of the game’s major cities, in this case Limsa Lominsa. So as far as pre-requisites, you literally only need a job/class at a minimum of Level 15, and of course the ability to travel into and around Limsa Lominsa. According to the details provided so far by FFXIV’s official hub The Lodestone, players will need to go to the Upper Decks area and look for an NPC named Ryu Metsuke. He can be found at (X:11.5, Y:13.9), in the plaza square where events often take place in Limsa Lominsa. He’ll give you a quest called “To Be a Mascot”, which will take you on a little adventure to help celebrate the occasion. Also, given that this year is the 10th Anniversary of FFXIV, it’s an especially memorable one. Fulfill the quest’s obligations, and you’ll be rewarded with the Ryunosuke minion, which is a chocobo chick adorably dressed in a dragon outfit, to commemorate the new Year of the Dragon. This is an absolute must-have for any player’s minion collection, and we certainly won’t be missing out on this one. Also, in-game items from previous Heavensturn events are now available on the Mog Station online store, including: - Heavensturn Attire – $5.00 USD - Authentic Heavensturn Crane Banner – $5.00 USD Alongside those items are the recently added ‘Joyous Leaping’ emote set, the ‘Starlight Steed’ reindeer mount from last year’s Starlight Celebration event, and the ‘Authentic Illuminated Tree’ outdoor furnishing as well. Be sure to take advantage of the ongoing Mog Station seasonal sale as well, which is discounting a big variety of items from Fantasias (we always need those, admit it), to job boosts and expansion skips for your alt characters, other seasonal furnishings, minions, [mounts](https://twinfinite.net/guides/easiest-mounts-for-beginners-to-get-final-fantasy-xiv/) and more. That sale goes on until Jan 4, 2024 @ 10:59PM (PST), so make sure you don’t miss out. That concludes our guide to the FFXIV Heavensturn Event 2023, with all details and rewards. We hope you found this helpful, and let us know how you enjoyed the game this past year, and what you’re looking forward to most in the coming year, especially with Dawntrail around the corner.
