    "text": "Medical Mutual latest insurance provider to limit anesthesia reimbursement\nROSEMONT, Ill. , Dec. 19, 2024 /PRNewswire/ --The American Association of Nurse Anesthesiology (AANA) issued the following statement following Medical Mutual's change in reimbursement policy for anesthesia:\n\"In an ideal world, health insurers would assist their customers with health care costs rather than inflate their profits and hinder those customers from getting the care they so desperately need,\" said Jan Setnor , President of the American Association of Nurse Anesthesiology, MSN, CRNA, Col. (Ret), USAFR, NC. \"Yet Medical Mutual has mimicked the attempt by both Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield and Kaiser Permanente by arbitrarily, and without justification, slashing CRNA reimbursement by fifteen percent. This policy announcement is a blatant, dangerous, and self-serving attack on CRNAs and the patients they seek to care for.\"\nThe Medical Mutual policy change will reduce certified registered nurse anesthetist (CRNA) reimbursement to only 85 percent, effective January 24, 2025 . CRNAs are anesthesia providers who are often the only ones available in rural communities, including in rural communities within Ohio , where Medical Mutual is headquartered.\n\"CRNAs are often the only anesthesia providers in the rural communities across the nation, including rural communities in Ohio where Medical Mutual is headquartered. The attempt by insurers to restrict their practice, underscores the critical need for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to enforce the nondiscrimination provision, and is why AANA continues its litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio to compel HHS to enforce the law.\"\nIt is the AANA's position that Medical Mutual follow Anthem and Kaiser's lead by reversing course on this discriminatory and dangerous policy that is in violation of the nondiscrimination provision within the Affordable Care Act.\nView original content to download multimedia: https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aana-anesthesia-reimbursement-policies-blatant-dangerous-attack-on-crnas-and-patients-302336687.html\nSOURCE American Association of Nurse Anesthesiology\nOriginally published on the BLOX Digital Content Exchange .",

    "text": "For years, Matt James and Rachael Kirkconnell were one of The Bachelor ‘s most talked-about couples. Despite a rocky start due to past controversies, they managed to stay together and build a relationship that lasted four years, which is a rare feat for a reality TV romance.\nFans followed their journey as they traveled the world, shared their love for food, and seemingly enjoyed a picture-perfect life. But all of that came crashing down when James suddenly announced their breakup on Instagram just two weeks ago.\nMatt James and Rachael Kirkconnell in the show The Bachelor | Credit: ABC The news left many stunned, especially since there were no prior signs of trouble. What made things even more shocking was Kirkconnell’s reaction. She admitted that she was just as blindsided as everyone else, revealing that they had even been planning their future together before everything fell apart. So, what went wrong?\nRachael Kirkconnell revealed the reason behind the breakup Rachael Kirkconnell on Call Her Daddy podcast | Credit: YouTube\\Call Her Daddy Every relationship has its ups and downs, and Matt James and Kirkconnell were no exception. However, their final moments as a couple took an unexpectedly harsh turn. Kirkconnell recently opened up about their split on the Call Her Daddy podcast, where she gave an emotional and detailed account of what led to the breakup.\nAccording to her, the end came suddenly while they were in Tokyo. They had been traveling together, creating content, and indulging in their shared love for food. But on their last night there, things took an unexpected turn. Kirkconnell had been feeling overwhelmed, trying to pick the perfect restaurant for dinner, knowing how important food content was to James.\nShe said on the Call Her Daddy podcast ,\nI was trying so hard to find, like, a good dinner spot for us. I was putting so much pressure on finding a good spot because he cares. This is, like, his career, you know, going to good food spots … Literally every single meal that we would have, we were filming.\nUnfortunately, the spot she chose didn’t meet their expectations, which made her upset. The pressure of making sure every meal was “ content-worthy ” had become too much. What was meant to be an enjoyable dinner turned into a tense moment.\nShe further said,\nThis sounds crazy, but as a food person, I’m trying to make sure that he’s getting good content for our trip and stuff, because I know it’s important to him, and it’s something that we’ll both post about.\nMatt James and Rachael Kirkconnell | Credit: Instagram\\@rachaelkirkconnell Kirkconnell got a little teary during dinner, which made James wonder why she was so emotional. But for her, everything seemed fine, at least on the surface. Deep down, though, their relationship was reaching its breaking point. She needed answers, asking if he truly saw a future with her or if he was just scared.\nWas she the one, or was he holding out for someone else? In the end, James admitted he didn’t think she was the right person for him. He didn’t want to keep her waiting for something that might never happen, so they went their separate ways.\nRelated ‘Bachelor’ Star Rachael Kirkconnell’s Jaw-Dropping Racism Controversy Revisited Amid Shocking Matt James Breakup James shocked her with words she never expected to hear. Instead of reassuring her or discussing their issues, he told her that he couldn’t see himself proposing or getting married to her. Kirkconnell recalled what James said,\nHe said that… there were just qualities about me that he worries about having in a wife . I don’t know if I ever see myself proposing to you. I can’t actually see myself married to you.\nTheir four-year relationship came to an abrupt end. To make matters worse, he publicly announced the breakup on Instagram before she even had the chance to process what had happened or inform her loved ones. It was a tough pill to swallow, and Kirkconnell was left heartbroken.\nRachael Kirkconnell and Matt James were discussing getting engaged before the unfortunate break-up Matt James and Rachael Kirkconnell | Credit: Instagram\\@mattjames919 What makes this breakup even more heartbreaking is that James and Kirkconnell had been seriously talking about getting engaged before everything fell apart. In fact, Kirkconnell revealed that James had encouraged her to start looking at rings and considering their future together. This was a big deal for him, as he had always been hesitant about commitment.\nKirkconnell said in the interview (via Call Her Daddy podcast ),\nWe talked about rings. He told me a few months ago to start, you know, saving some things, picking things out or that we should go look at some—and that was a big deal, I would say, for him to say. That’s when I was like, ‘Wow, okay. He really is on board with this.’\nShe further said,\nThat was such a green flag to me and I felt like the longer we were together, the more he was able to talk about it and I think at first, I could tell it was something that did scare him a lot or it was like a really hard thing for him to talk about and it just seemed easier and easier as our relationship went on, so I felt like that was a good sign.\nKirkconnell believed that with time, James was becoming more open to the idea of marriage. The way he spoke about their future gave her hope that they were on the same page. She had no reason to doubt his intentions, especially since they had been discussing engagement and even potential family plans. Everything seemed to be falling into place, making the sudden breakup even more confusing and painful.\nRelated The Bachelor: The Advice Survivor’s Jeff Probst Gave to Chris Harrison May Have Saved His Career as Host Unfortunately, life doesn’t always go as planned. The love story that once fans adored ended on a sour note, leaving Kirkconnell to pick up the pieces. Kirkconnell’s side of the story paints a picture of heartbreak, disappointment, and a relationship that ended faster than anyone expected.\nBreakups are never easy, and this one was particularly rough. Here’s hoping Kirkconnell finds happiness, whether it’s with someone new or simply by enjoying life without the pressure of turning every moment into content. One thing’s for sure, she deserves someone who values her beyond just the perfect Instagram-worthy meal.",

    "text": "快科技3月13日消息，据报道， 美国国家航空航天局（NASA）与意大利航天局等机构合作开展的“月球GNSS接收器实验”（LuGRE）取得重大突破，首次在月球表面成功获取并跟踪基于地球的全球导航系统（GPS）信号。\n宇航员和航天器在月球表面活动时，精准可靠的导航至关重要。然而，传统GPS工具在地球与月球之间约36万公里的距离上难以发挥作用。\n为解决这一难题，NASA与合作伙伴提出了将全球导航卫星系统（GNSS）信号传输至月球表面的方案，使航天器能够自主测算时间、速度和位置。LuGRE实验正是这一方案的核心项目之一，搭载于美国“萤火虫”航空航天公司的“蓝色幽灵”月球着陆器上。\n3月2日，“蓝色幽灵”着陆器成功在月球表面着陆。随后，LuGRE开始进行信号接收实验。美国东部时间3月3日凌晨两点左右，LuGRE在距离地球约36万公里的月球表面成功采集到GPS信号，并实现了导航定位。这一突破性成果为月球导航技术的发展奠定了基础。\n在前往月球的途中，LuGRE不断刷新GNSS信号接收距离的纪录。1月21日，它在距离地球33.8万公里处接收到了信号，打破了此前由NASA磁层多尺度任务保持的纪录。 2月20日，当它进入月球轨道时，信号接收距离进一步扩展至39万公里，创下新纪录。\n在地球上，GNSS信号已广泛应用于智能手机、飞机等多种设备的导航。LuGRE实验证明，GNSS信号同样可以在月球上获取并跟踪，这对未来月球探索任务具有重要意义。\n研究团队指出，目前NASA主要通过机载传感器与地面跟踪信号相结合的方式追踪航天器，但这种方法依赖地面工程师团队的监控。如果航天器能够在月球上自主获取GNSS信号，将大幅减少对人工操作的依赖，提升任务效率和安全性。\nLuGRE预计将在月球表面工作14天，期间以近乎连续运转的状态收集数据。这些数据将为未来月球导航系统的设计和优化提供宝贵参考。 随着技术的不断进步，月球导航有望成为载人登月任务和月球基地建设的重要支撑，为人类探索深空开辟新的可能性。",

    "title": "‘So much death’: Lawmakers weigh stricter speed limits, safer roads for pedestrians",
    "text": "By Vanessa G. Sánchez, KFF Health News\nLOS ANGELES — The party was winding down. Its young hosts, María Rivas Cruz and her fiancé, Raymond Olivares, had accompanied friends to their car to bid them farewell. As the couple crossed a four-lane main road back to the home they had just bought, Rivas Cruz and Olivares were struck by a car fleeing an illegal street race. The driver was going 70 in a 40-mph zone.\nDespite years of pleading for a two-lane road, lower speed limits, safety islands, and more marked crosswalks, residents say the county had done little to address speeding in this unincorporated pocket of southeastern Los Angeles. Since 2012, this half-mile stretch of Avalon Boulevard had logged 396 crashes, injuring 170 and killing three.\nOlivares, 27, a civil engineer for the city of Los Angeles, became the fourth fatality when he was hurled across the street, hit by a second car, and instantly killed. Rivas Cruz was transported to a hospital, where she remained in a coma for two weeks. Once awake, the elementary school teacher underwent a series of reconstructive surgeries to repair her arm, jaw, and legs.\nIn the aftermath of the February 2023 crash, the county installed protective steel posts midway across the street. But residents, who had sought a platformed center divider and speed cameras, said that wasn’t enough.\n“It’s just a band-aid on a cut. This is supposed to solve it, but it doesn’t, and that is what hurts,” said Rivas Cruz, who now at age 28 walks with a cane and lives with chronic pain. “I go to sleep, and I’m like, ‘It’s just a dream, it’s just a dream.’ And it’s not.”\nThe nation’s road system covers 4 million miles and is governed by a patchwork of federal, state, and local jurisdictions that often operate in silos, making systemic change difficult and expensive. But amid the highest number of pedestrians killed in decades, localities are pushing to control how speed limits are set and for more accountability on road design. This spring, New York and Michigan passed laws allowing local jurisdictions to lower speed limits. In Los Angeles, voters approved a measure that forces the city to act on its own safety improvement plan , mandating that the car-loving metropolis redesign streets, add bike lanes, and protect cyclists, transit riders, and pedestrians.\nStill, there’s plenty of political resistance to speed enforcement. In California’s Statehouse, Sen. Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco) proposed requiring GPS-equipped smart devices in new cars and trucks to prevent excessive speeding. But after pushback, the state lawmaker watered down his bill to require all vehicles sold in the state starting in 2032 to have only warning systems that alert drivers when they exceed the speed limit by more than 10 mph.\nAlthough the Biden administration is championing Vision Zero — its commitment to zero traffic deaths — and injecting more than $20 billion in funding for transportation safety programs through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act , road safety advocates and some lawmakers argue that the country is still far from making streets and vehicles safe, or slowing drivers down.\n“We are not showing the political will to use the proven safety tools that exist,” said Leah Shahum, founder of Vision Zero Network, a nonprofit organization advancing Vision Zero in communities across the country.\nStill a crisis The need for safer roads took on urgency during the covid pandemic. Fatalities rose even as lockdown mandates emptied streets. In 2022 , more than 42,500 people died on American roads, and at least 7,522 pedestrians were fatally struck — the highest tally of pedestrian deaths in more than four decades.\nExperts cite several reasons for the decline in road safety. During the lockdowns, reckless driving increased while traffic enforcement declined. SUVs and trucks have become larger and heavier, thus deadlier when they hit a pedestrian. Other factors persist as streets remain wide to accommodate vehicles, and in some states speed limits have gradually increased .\nEarly estimates of motor vehicle fatalities show a slight decrease from 2022 to 2023, but pedestrian fatalities are still notably above pre-pandemic numbers . “It’s an encouraging start, but the numbers still constitute a crisis,” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg wrote in February of roadway deaths.\nThe Biden administration has directed $15.6 billion to road safety until 2026 and $5 billion in local grants to prevent roadway deaths and injuries. Under the U.S. Department of Transportation’s new “ vulnerable road user” rule , states with 15% or more deaths involving pedestrians, bicyclists, or motorcyclists compared with all road deaths must match federal dollars in their safety improvement spending.\nRoad safety advocates argue the federal government missed an opportunity to eliminate outdated standards for setting speed limits when it revised traffic guidelines last year . The agency could have eliminated guidance recommending setting speed limits at or below how fast 85% of drivers travel on uncongested roads. Critics contend that what’s known as the 85th percentile rule encourages traffic engineers to set speed limits at levels unsafe for pedestrians.\nBut the Federal Highway Administration wrote in a statement that while the 85th percentile is the typical method, engineers rarely rely solely on this rule. It also noted that states and some local agencies have their own criteria for setting speed limits.\nIn response, grassroots efforts to curtail speeding have sprouted across communities. In April, Michigan passed legislation granting local governments authority to round down when setting speed limits.\nAnd after four years of lobbying, New York state passed Sammy’s Law, named after 12-year-old Sammy Cohen Eckstein, who was killed by a driver in Brooklyn in 2013. The law, which will take effect in June, allows New York City to lower its speed limits to 20 mph in designated areas.\n“With this legislation, I hope we can learn more children’s names because of their accomplishments, their personalities, and their spirit — not their final moments,” said Sammy’s mother, Amy Cohen.\nPush for pedestrian safety Advocates would also like the federal government to factor in pedestrian safety on the five-star vehicle safety rating scale. However, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has proposed a separate pass/fail test that would be posted only on the agency’s website, not on labels consumers would see at the dealership.\nRelated Articles National Politics | Election monitors nervously practice for the ‘big dance in November’ National Politics | Alito’s flag controversy foreshadows contentious Supreme Court rulings National Politics | Election certification disputes in a handful of states spark concerns over 2024 presidential contest National Politics | Election officials, retired lawmakers plead for more money to protect voting National Politics | Greater focus on crime sparks another wave of juvenile justice bills Automakers like BMW questioned the effectiveness of a program testing pedestrian protections in vehicles arguing that in European countries that adopted such a regulation, it’s not been clear whether it led to fewer deaths and injuries. According to the campaign finance site Open Secrets, automakers spent about $49 million lobbying in 2023 compared with $2.2 million spent by advocates for highway and auto safety.\n“The federal government has the biggest punch when it comes to requiring improved vehicle safety design,” said Wiener, the California state lawmaker.\nAlthough Wiener modified his proposal to restrict excessive speeding, he has advanced companion legislation that would require Caltrans, the state transportation agency, to make improvements such as adding crosswalks and curb extensions on state-owned surface streets to better serve pedestrians, cyclists, and transit users.\nWhen that bill was heard in a committee, opponents, including engineering firms and contractors, cautioned it would remove flexibility and hamper the state’s ability to deliver a safe and efficient transportation system. Lawmakers have until Aug. 31 to act on his bills.\nIn Los Angeles, hope for change arrived in March when voters passed Measure HLA , which requires the city to invest $3.1 billion in road safety over the next decade. Rivas Cruz’s house, however, sits eight blocks outside the jurisdiction of the city initiative.\nIt’s been more than a year since the crash, but Rivas Cruz finds reminders everywhere: in the mirror, when she looks at the scars left on her face after several surgeries. When she walks on the street that still lacks the infrastructure that would have protected her and Raymond.\nStories of pedestrians killed in this Latino working-class neighborhood are too common, said Rivas Cruz. In September, she attended a memorial of a 14-year-old who was killed by a reckless driver.\n“There’s so much death going on,” the Los Angeles Unified School District teacher said from her mother’s living room on a spring afternoon. “The representatives have failed us. Raymond and I were giving back to the community. He was a civil engineer working for the city, and I’m a LAUSD teacher.

    "title": "Dan Lanning fires back at Kirby Smart over NIL comment at SEC Media Days",
    "text": "Last week during SEC Media Days, Georgia Bulldogs head coach Kirby Smart fired a dig at Oregon’s longstanding ties with Nike, and how that may affect their recruiting process in the world of NIL deals, which Oregon head coach Dan Lanning has since responded to.\nDuring a speech at the event, Smart spoke about how envious he was of Lanning and Oregon due to the amount of NIL money that Nike is sending the program.\n“I wish I could get some of that NIL money he’s giving Dan Lanning,” said Smart.\nGeorgia’s Kirby Smart references Nike CEO Phil Knight: “I wish I could get some of that NIL money he’s giving Dan Lanning”\n— Brett McMurphy (@Brett_McMurphy) July 16, 2024\nInstead of pushing back against Smart’s claims, Lanning embraced the support he and his program are receiving from Oregon. But he himself is seemingly quite skeptical that Smart and Georgia aren’t getting their own significant funding from partners to give NIL money to top recruits.\n“I think it’s impressive that guys like Kirby Smart have been signing the number one class in the nation without any NIL money,” jokes Lanning during an appearance on The Pat McAfee Show Thursday. “Obviously, Coach Smart took a little shot at us. I don’t think it’s a secret. If you want to be a top-ten team in college football, you better have great support.\n“We have that, but it’s also the 300 teams we went to this spring to visit. It’s the 23 satellite camps. It’s when they come to our campus, our staff, our alignment with our entire university that makes recruiting work.”\n“I think it’s impressive that guys like Kirby Smart have been signing the number one class in the nation without any NIL money 😂😂\nKirby is a great mentor and I wouldn’t be sitting here if it wasn’t for him” ~ @CoachDanLanning #PMSLive pic.twitter.com/78uOI655LC\n— Pat McAfee (@PatMcAfeeShow) July 25, 2024\nIt doesn’t appear to be overly serious shots yet between the two top-tier coaches, which makes sense considering Lanning previously served as an assistant under Smart at Georgia from 2018 to 2021 before taking the Oregon coaching job in 2022.\nIn fact, Lanning went on to praise Smart later in his guest appearance on The Pat McAfee Show , calling him a “great mentor” and admitting that he wouldn’t be where he is today without him.\n“I still visit with Kirby,” added Lanning. “I consider him a great mentor. I wouldn’t be sitting here without guys like that. Kirby has changed my career. I’ve probably learned more from Coach Smart than any other coach I’ve ever worked with in my career.”\nClearly, there is a lot of mutual respect between Smart and Lanning. But in the same breath, Smart and Lanning are potentially competing for the same elite-level prospects in recruiting. So maybe there is a bit of an underlying jealousy there from Smart towards Lanning.\n[ Pat McAfee on X ]",
