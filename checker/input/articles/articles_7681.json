    "title": "Norway’s KLP Pension Announces Divestments from Gulf Countries over Human Rights | Chief Investment Officer",
    "text": "Kommunal Landspensjonkasse, Norway’s largest pension system, will divest from several countries due to environmental, social and governance and human rights concerns. The fund added 12 companies from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait to an exclusion list, forbidding the pension fund from making investments in these companies.\nThe excluded companies, which are primarily within the real estate and telecom industries, include Emirates Telecom Group, Saudi Telecom, Emaar Properties, Aldar Properties, Etihad Etisalat, Mobile Telecommunications, Dar Al Arkan, Ooredoo, Mobile Telecommunications Co. Saudi Arabia, Mabanee, Barwa Real Estate and oil giant Saudi Aramco.\n“KLP has excluded 11 of these companies because it considers that there is an unacceptable, sector-specific risk of contributing to human rights abuses,” stated the pension fund’s report , “Publication of the decision following a due diligence assessment of companies in the Gulf States,” announcing the exclusions.\nSeveral of the real estate firms were added to the exclusion list because of allegations of labor rights violations. Telecommunications firms were excluded due to concerns over freedom of the press and freedom of expression in the countries, according to the pension fund’s report.\nSaudi Aramco was excluded for a failure to commit to climate transition plans, according to KLP. The pension fund has a goal of reducing greenhouse gases and becoming net zero by 2050 within its operations and its portfolio. It notes that Saudi Aramco is last in a ranking of oil and gas companies’ climate-related goals and transition plans by the Carbon Tracker Organization, which ranked 25 companies in the sector.\n“Based on an overall assessment of the company’s close ties to an authoritarian state and an active position in opposition to KLP’s expectations regarding oil and gas companies’ climate change and energy transition plans, it has been decided to exclude Saudi Aramco from KLP’s investments,” the fund’s report stated.\nKLP conducts due diligence on existing and prospective investments to make sure any allocation is aligned with the pension funds’ goals and values. The fund announces exclusions almost monthly and has excluded companies in the alcohol, gambling, weapons, tobacco and coal industries, as well as Russia-linked companies. The fund has made eight such announcements this year. “We believe that being transparent about exclusions, including their rationale, is about taking responsibility for our choices,” according to the KLP website.\n“By doing so, we genuinely hope and believe this will lead to change. In the same way that we demand transparency from the companies in which we invest, we must be open about our work in relation to our customers and other stakeholders. We continue to engage in dialogue with excluded companies with the aim of encouraging them to implement the changes needed to be once again suitable for investment.”\nKLP currently manages 972.3 billion kroner ($95.839 billion) in assets, as of the end of the third quarter 2023. By the end of the third quarter, the fund has returned 3.9% YTD. The fund’s assets have increased by 72.2 billion kroner ($7.6 billion) through the year’s third quarter.\nRelated Stories:\nNorway’s SWF: Stop Talking, Take Action on Climate Transition\nNorway’s Pension Fund Global Excludes Chinese Firm for Environmental Damage Risk\nPensionDanmark Sells Tesla, Puts It on ‘Exclusion List’ Over Union Dispute\nTags: ESG , KLP , Kommunal Landspensjonkasse , Norway , Pension",

    "text": "The UN Warns Thousands Flee Central Gaza Amid Israeli Offensive An estimated 150,000 Palestinians are being forced to flee areas of central Gaza as Israeli forces advance on refugee camps, the UN has reported. Tanks have reportedly reached the eastern outskirts of Bureij camp, while Israel’s military has expanded its ground offensive to target Bureij and nearby Nuseirat and Maghazi camps, according to witnesses and Hamas’s armed wing. The Israeli bombardment also resulted in dozens of deaths across Gaza, with the Hamas-run health ministry reporting more than 21,300 people killed during the 11 weeks of fighting, mostly children and women. The UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA) director in Gaza, Tom White, has reported a surge of people being pushed into the southern Gaza town of Rafah, exacerbating the problem of overcrowded shelters. The health ministry reported that 20 people were killed in an Israeli airstrike on a building in Rafah, which reportedly housed displaced civilians. Israel has called for the evacuation of a strip of land stretching across central Gaza, including Bureij and Nuseirat camps, and has urged residents and displaced people to move southwards to Deir al-Balah. However, the UN warned that the town is already overcrowded, leaving the displaced with “nowhere to go”. Meanwhile, in Israel, thousands of teenagers participated in a march to demand the release of more than 100 hostages still being held by Hamas and other armed groups in Gaza. Negotiations for a temporary pause in the fighting have reportedly been taking place as Hamas insists on discussing a full ceasefire. READ Also: A family that walks on all fours; Answer scientists and doctors | The extraordinary family that walks on all fours at all times The UN has also called on Israel to stop what it described as “unlawful” killings in the occupied West Bank, expressing extreme concern over the use of military tactics and disproportionate force against Palestinians. The ongoing conflict has led to international concern, with calls for a cessation of hostilities and dialogue to resolve the escalating crisis.",

    "text": "SAN DIEGO - Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ: LGND) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved ZELSUVMI™ (berdazimer topical gel, 10.3%) for treating molluscum contagiosum in adults and children one year and older. This marks the first FDA approval of a novel drug for molluscum infections, providing a significant advancement in the treatment of this highly contagious skin condition.\nZELSUVMI™ is the first topical prescription medication that can be self-applied at home, offering a new level of convenience for patients and caregivers. The approval is based on the results of two Phase 3 trials, which demonstrated the drug's ability to reduce lesion counts with a once-daily application and was well-tolerated by patients.\nDr. Mark D. Kaufmann, a Clinical Professor of Dermatology and Past President of the American Academy of Dermatology, expressed his anticipation for the availability of this new treatment, noting its breakthrough status. Similarly, Dr. Stephen W. Stripling, a pediatrician and molluscum researcher, highlighted the benefit of having an effective at-home treatment option over the traditional \"wait and watch\" approach.\nMolluscum contagiosum affects approximately 6 million Americans each year, predominantly children, with up to 73% of affected children not receiving treatment. The condition is characterized by lesions that can spread the infection to others or different body areas if left untreated.\nZELSUVMI™, a nitric oxide releasing agent known for its antiviral properties, has an unknown mechanism of action in treating molluscum contagiosum. However, the efficacy of ZELSUVMI™ was established in the B-SIMPLE clinical program, involving 1,598 patients. The most common adverse reactions reported were application site reactions.\nLigand's CEO, Todd Davis, expressed pride in the team's achievement in completing the largest clinical program for molluscum and bringing this first-in-class medication to FDA approval. The company anticipates that ZELSUVMI™ will be commercially available in the United States during the second half of 2024.\nThis news is based on a press release statement from Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated.\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

    "text": "OTD: Ajinkya Rahane’s India breach Gabba fortress to win successive Test series in Australia\nBack on January 19, 2021, India beat Australia for the first time in a Test match at the Gabba in Brisbane. With the series level at 1-1, the visitors had a tough task at in hand as Australia have always dominated at the venue in Brisbane.\nHowever, the visitors, led by Ajinkya Rahane, defied the odds to come up trumps and win by three wickets. After opting bat first, Australia scored 369 in 115.2 overs on the back of Marnus Labuschagne’s knock of 108. Tim Paine scored 50 while Steve Smith, Matthew Wade and Cameron Green scored 36, 45 and 47 respectively.\nT Natarajan, Shardul Thakur and Washington Sundar picked up three wickets apiece. India conceded a slender, yet crucial lead of 33 runs after being bowled out for 336 in 111.4 overs. Sundar and Thakur made 62 and 67 respectively to help India recover from 186 for six. The duo put on 123 runs for the seventh wicket.\nJosh Hazlewood was the star Australian bowler after he picked up five wickets for 57 runs in 24.4 overs.\nAustralia scored 294 runs in their second innings and set India a target of 328 to chase down. Steve Smith scored 55 and was the top-scorer for the Aussies. Mohammed Siraj picked up five wickets while Thakur accounted for four scalps.\nThereafter, India chased down the target in 97 overs to make history. They lost the early wicket of Rohit Sharma in their run-chase, but Shubman Gill steadied the ship with a knock of 91, laced with eight fours and two sixes.\nCheteshwar Pujara made 56 runs off 211 balls to hold one end up. Then it was the turn of Rishabh Pant to show his class. The southpaw stayed unbeaten on 89 runs off 138 balls as India went past the finish line in the third and final session of the fifth day’s play.\nAlso Read | ICC U-19 Cricket World Cup 2024: Schedule, squads to live streaming and all you need to know",

    "title": "Hypersonic Weapons On Zumwalt Destroyer Pushed Back To 2027",
    "text": "Testing the first hypersonic missiles on the USS Zumwalt (DDG-1000) destroyer is running at least two years behind plan for 2025, pushed back to 2027, a Navy official said Thursday.\n“So Zumwalt , we’re trying to figure out as that platform comes out of her build yard maintenance period and we start to look at what is all the final testing we’re going to have to do on our side, with our system, the testing is continuing, but… ‘25 is not a date that’s going to happen. So we’re just still trying to figure out where all that is going to match up, and when are we going to get that out there. But all the testing is continuing to move forward, and it’s going pretty well right now,” Vice Adm. Johnny Wolfe, Director of Strategic Systems Programs (SSP), told reporters during the Naval Submarine League’s annual symposium in Arlington, Va.\nUSS Zumwalt (DDG-1000) preparing to dock at HII’s Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Miss., on Aug. 19, 2023 for a maintenance period that is replacing its unused Advanced Gun System with large diameter missile tubes to field the Conventional Prompt Strike hypersonic weapon. (Photo: HII)\nSSP is the Navy program manager for Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS), the Navy version of the shared hypersonic weapon with the Army. The two services are working together to design and develop the common All-Up Round of a Common Hypersonic Glide Body, missile body and rocket booster to be launched from different platforms.\nWolfe confirmed testing of CPS weapons on DDG-1000 is now expected to start further out in 2027-2028, primarily due to weapon testing running behind schedule.\nIn June, the Army and Navy said they completed a milestone flight test of the hypersonic weapon after several tests were canceled in 2023 ( Defense Daily , July 2).\nThe Army was originally due to first field the hypersonic weapon by the end of 2023, but the test delays pushed that back to next year. A June Government Accountability Office report projected the Army will not field its hypersonic weapon battery until fiscal year 2025 in more recent test and production plans ( Defense Daily , June 18).\nThe Navy previously planned to start testing CPS on Zumwalt -class destroyers by fiscal year 2025, replacing the unused Advanced Gun System with four CPS-capable 87-inch large diameter missile tubes that can carry three missiles each, for 12 total per ship. The service plans to ultimately deploy CPS on all three Zumwalt -class ships before adding them to the new Virginia -class attack submarines with the Virginia Payload Module (VPM). Deploying CPS to VPM was also previously planned to be ready by fiscal year 2029 ( Defense Daily , Feb. 3, 2023).\nWolfe said his program is proceeding well to focus on making CPS ready to test on the Zumwalt despite the overall missile testing delays and additional delays in the destroyer’s maintenance period upgrading the ship.\n“So the testing that we need to do to get to the final integration of Zumwalt – that’s irrespective of where the Zumwalt is at, whether it’s in the water because the way we’ve modularized this, the work that’s being done on Zumwalt is to get the tubes, the big, large diameter tubes in the platform – because of the way we’ve designed Conventional Prompt Strike to be modular.”\nDuring the 2022 symposium, Wolfe said the biggest challenge in deploying hypersonic weapons on naval vessels was getting the weapon through its current all-up round integration by 2025 ( Defense Daily , Nov. 8, 2022)\nThe Navy awarded HII a $155 million modification last year for the current DDG-1000 modernization period to install the CPS-capable missile tubes, following previous contracts that planned the modernization and procured long-lead time materials. The award expected an 18-month drydock availability to change the weapon system as well as perform other maintenance and modernization work, with work planned to be finished by September 2025. ( Defense Daily , Aug. 30, 2023).\nThe USS Zumwalt first arrived at Ingalls Shipbuilding in August 2023. Wolfe now confirmed DDG-1000 is not due to leave HII ’s [HII] Ingalls Shipbuilding facility in Pascagoula, Miss., for about another year.\nUnder the previous schedule before the missile testing delays, the Navy had scheduled the first two to three CPS test shots off DDG-1000 by December 2025.\nHypersonic missile test at the Pacific Missile Range Facility in Kauai, Hawaii in 2024. (Photo: U.S. Department of Defense)\nDespite these delays, Wolfe said his program is currently testing and building the payload module adapter that goes into the missile tubes, so that will be ready once the shipyard work is finished. He also noted the Navy has built a facility to test the eject system since the missile has to be ejected from the tubes before launch.\n“So all of that is continuing on. What we’re talking about is the final integration of when the weapon system, you know, proofing and developments, all done to the time I get it on the Zumwalt and I get the Zumwalt through her final testing, which is the graduation exercise where we actually launch a weapon out of Zumwalt,” he said.\nWhile Wolfe is not responsible for the DDG-1000 and its maintenance period, he reported the conversion and maintenance work has gone very well despite overall delays. He argued the main limitation on CPS progress has been budget limits and progress on testing the hypersonic glide body with the Army, not delays in getting the ship out of drydock.\n“It’s not going to be the limiter of the platform at this point. [The limiter] really is finishing all the testing, and a lot of that is in relation to how we’ve done testing with the Army as well. To get their testing completed, followed on by our testing. And so it’s just a matter of the way we were resourced. We were very limited on the assets that we had to be able to test,” he said.\nWolfe said this means whenever there is a hiccup in the hypersonic weapon testing regime, it stops everything in the testing line because they do not have enough assets allocated to the effort to proceed to the next test.\n“You got to recycle and do all those things. So it’s that build up, which is what we’re experiencing right now.”\nHe insisted these delays should not impact installing the hypersonic weapons on VPM-equipped Virginia -class submarines.\nThat timeline will largely be up to when the submarines are deployed, if pushed back past the originally scheduled FY 2029 for CPS emplacement.\n“The question is going to be, when will the first Virginia -class with the Virginia Payload Module be ready to go,” then they can start putting the capacity in it.",

    "title": "'Zero Day': New 10-Part Series Imagines What a Chinese Invasion of Taiwan Might Actually Look Like | Military.com",
    "text": "In the wake of a new Taiwanese election, the Chinese People’s Liberation Navy and Air Force surround the island of Taiwan and cut off access to the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan’s stock market crumbles and banks fail. Hackers, infiltrators and Chinese sympathizers wreak havoc on Taiwan’s infrastructure. Foreigners and citizens begin to flee as water, electricity and communications are cut across the island nation. Everything happens over the course of a single week, and everyone knows what’s coming: a full-scale Chinese invasion of Taiwan. This is the nightmare scenario imagined by the new 10-part Taiwanese television series “Zero Day.” The show’s 17-minute trailer, released on July 23, 2024, racked up 1.5 million views in just two weeks, which aren’t Marvel-level numbers but is still impressive, given the timeframe. The trailer has left many viewers in Taiwan [understandably shaken](https://time.com/7003134/zero-day-taiwan-television-series-china-invasion/). For many Americans, the defense of Taiwan is a potential flashpoint for a “great power” war between the United States and China, a conflict that decision-makers in Washington, D.C., see [as all but inevitable](https://www.defensenews.com/pentagon/2024/05/07/how-dc-became-obsessed-with-a-potential-2027-chinese-invasion-of-taiwan/). But that potential battlefield is still thousands of miles away while, for the 23.5 million people in Taiwan, the threat of an invasion can cast a shadow of fear and anxiety over daily life. \"Frankly, everyone has their own fears and imaginations about the war, but in our daily lives, many avoid it or even pretend it doesn’t exist,” Hsin-mei Cheng, [former journalist and showrunner of \"Zero Day,\" told CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/04/asia/taiwan-tv-series-zero-day-chinese-invasion-intl-hnk/index.html). “But as the crisis looms larger over the past two years, I think it’s about time we take a hard look at it and open this Pandora’s box. “For me, the war has already begun in Taiwan,” she added. “It is not being fought through guns and cannons, but through information and infiltration. It’s permeating our daily lives.” The Chinese government considers Taiwan a breakaway province that will one day be reunited with mainland China, whether the people on the island want it or not. As Chinese military power grows, its [ shows of force and strength in the Taiwan Strait](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2024/05/24/china-sends-dozens-of-warplanes-and-ships-near-taiwan-show-its-anger-over-islands-new-leaders.html) have become bolder and more frequent, even as [the United States continues to guarantee the island’s security](https://www.reuters.com/world/biden-says-us-forces-would-defend-taiwan-event-chinese-invasion-2022-09-18/). Each of “Zero Day’s” 10 episodes depicts an independent aspect of Taiwanese life affected by the fictionalized invasion, as they experience a countdown to the day Chinese troops land on Taiwan’s shores. Hsin-mei Cheng gathered a team of experienced directors to create the series while raising money from wealthy, pro-independence investors and the country’s Ministry of Culture. The countdown begins after a PLA aircraft “disappears” in the Taiwan Strait in what looks to the Taiwanese leadership like a dreamed-up pretext for China to deploy ships and aircraft to the area. China shuts down the area for what appears to be a staged search-and-rescue mission. It ends with a Chinese military force landing on the Taiwanese island of Kinmen and preparing to make an initial assault. The pre-invasion salvo of misinformation depicted in “Zero Day” includes tactics that only recently became a deep concern for world leaders, such as the deployment of AI-generated deep fakes of Taiwan’s president to lull the population into surrendering. Anyone who doubts that a show can have a significant long-term effect on real political situations need only look at the November 1983 airing of the made-for-TV movie “The Day After.” Its depiction of the consequences of a nuclear exchange between the United States and Soviet Union [shook Americans awake to the realities of the Cold War and nuclear weapons](https://docs.rwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1136&context=nyscaproceedings). It even prompted President Ronald Reagan to rethink his hardline Soviet foreign policy. “I hope the show can serve as a wake-up call to the Taiwanese people: What should we do when we still have the right to choose?” Cheng said. “Zero Day” has not yet completed production, but plans to wrap filming in November for a 2025 premiere.

Ma uniche sono anche le temperature di questo dicembre, devastante dal punto di vista termico con valori sui 500 metri per più giorni superiori ai 10°C, ” evidenzia Spensieri. “ Il 26 dicembre c’erano 10°C a Capracotta e a Campitello, i comuni montani più alti della regione, e ancora una volta il dato molto rilevante in un contesto del genere è quello della persistenza. È vero che abbiamo avuto sempre fasi alternate in un clima che cambia ma è un trend così costante e così importante di presenza di alta pressione in un periodo invernale da una parte e di secco diffuso per più settimane dall’altra, testimoniano come le cose stiano cambiando, anzi siano già cambiate “.\nDi seguito i link per l’accesso diretto alle pagine con le previsioni meteo, particolarmente accurate nei dettagli, per le aree geografiche d’Italia (link sempre raggiungibili anche dal Menù in alto in tutte le pagine del sito): Meteo Nord Italia Meteo Centro Italia Meteo Sud e Isole Le Previsioni Meteo Regione per Regione: Meteo Lombardia Meteo Lazio Meteo Campania Meteo Veneto Meteo Sicilia Meteo Emilia Romagna Meteo Piemonte Meteo Puglia Meteo Toscana Meteo Calabria Meteo Sardegna Meteo Liguria Meteo Marche Meteo Abruzzo Meteo Friuli Venezia Giulia Meteo Trentino Alto Adige Meteo Umbria Meteo Basilicata Meteo Molise Meteo Valle d’Aosta\nPer monitorare nel modo migliore possibile la situazione meteo in tempo reale, di seguito forniamo un elenco delle pagine con tutte le informazioni utili per seguire il nowcasting meteorologico minuto per minuto: Satelliti Satelliti Animati Situazione Fulminazioni Radar Continua la lettura su MeteoWeb Condividi TAGS: maltempo maltempo molise vento forte Video Vedi tutti › VIDEO DEL GIORNO Dramma in Argentina, tempesta con venti a oltre 140 km/h: crolla tetto di un impianto sportivo, 13 morti Gallery Vedi tutti ›\nL'Osservatorio meteorologico di Montevergine celebra 140 anni di attività",
