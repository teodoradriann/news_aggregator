    "title": "iPhone 16 Wireless Charging Issues - 6 Best Fixes",
    "text": "I placed my iPhone 16 on the same wireless charger that worked fine with my iPhone 15. Hours later, I was shocked to find that the battery had barely moved! Plugging it into a wired charger, however, worked without a hitch. Frustrated and curious, I decided to pinpoint what might be causing these wireless charging issues on my (expensive) iPhone 16.\nAfter running several tests and troubleshooting steps, I identified the root of the problem and found effective solutions, which I’m sharing below to help you avoid the same hassle. Let’s dive in.\nHow Do I Fix iPhone 16 Wireless Charging Issues? 1. Update iOS Time needed: 5 minutes\nUpdating your iPhone could resolve charging issues. Apple patches software bugs and optimizes power management systems in iOS point releases. Follow these steps:\nOpen the Settings app.\nScroll up to find the Updates Available menu.\nTap on that to quickly redirect yourself to the Software Update window.\nIf you don’t see that menu in Settings , scroll down to the General section, tap, and choose Software Update .\nIf you find an update is available for the device, tap Download and Install or Update Now .\nOnce the device restarts, put the device into the wireless charging machine.\n2. Allow the Device to Cool Off Apple designed iPhones to pause charging when they overheat, protecting internal components from damage. Thermal throttling—a built-in safety feature—activates when the device gets too hot, slowing or stopping charging entirely. To address this, remove any protective cases and place your iPhone on a cool, well-ventilated surface. Allow it to cool down before attempting to charge again.\n3. Place the Camera Lip in the Hanging Position The iPhone 16’s protruding camera lip tends to block wireless chargers. To avoid misalignment, position your device so that the lip slightly overhangs the charger’s edge. It’s a small adjustment to improve battery efficiency by securing contact with the charging coil.\n4. Remove the iPhone 16 Case The protective case on your iPhone 16 might block wireless charging entirely or reduce its efficiency. Remove the case and try charging again.\n5. Factory Reset Software glitches or misconfigurations can cause charging problems. Since you can’t pinpoint the exact cause, you might have to revert your device settings to their defaults altogether. But before proceeding, remember to back up your device, or else you’ll lose your data for good.\nUse iCloud for Backup Open the Settings app and tap on your Apple ID avatar or profile picture at the top of the screen. Now, tap on the iCloud menu.\nYou should now see the Saved to iCloud section. Tap the See All button on the right edge of this menu.\nThe new menu that opens shows how the iOS system apps and third-party apps sync to the iCloud account. You’ll see options, like iCloud Photos , iCloud Drive , Notes , Health , and more. Ensure that all these systems and apps show On in the right edge.\nSome will have a toggle button, like Contacts , Reminders , Safari , etc. Ensure those toggle buttons are in the On position. Keep the iPhone connected to the Wi-Fi but idle for half an hour. Factory reset the Device Open the iOS Settings app. Tap on the General settings menu. Swipe to the bottom of the screen and tap the Transfer or Reset iPhone option.\nOn the Transfer or Reset iPhone window, tap Erase All Content and Settings .\nTap Continue on the Erase This iPhone screen. A confirmation pop-up will show from the bottom. Tap Erase iPhone once again.\n6. Use a Supported Wireless Charger Here are the features of a fully compatible wireless charger for iPhone 16:\nThe charging device must come with the MagSafe tag. It should be a round wireless charger so that the charging dock or surface doesn’t come in contact with the back camera panel. It’s also best if you can get a Qi2-compliant wireless charger. Find below a few links to the compatible wireless charging docks for iPhone 16:\nIf none of the above methods work, contact Apple Support . You also might want to read the definitive solutions to fix wireless charging issues after the iOS 18/18.1 update .",

    "title": "US FDA finds widely used asthma drug impacts the brain - CNA",
    "text": "US government researchers have found that a widely prescribed asthma drug originally sold by Merck & Co may be linked to serious mental health problems for some patients, according to a scientific presentation reviewed by Reuters. The researchers found that the drug, sold under the brand name Singulair and generically as montelukast, attaches to multiple brain receptors critical to psychiatric functioning. Singulair was a blockbuster product for Merck after its launch in 1998, offering relief in a pill as an alternative to an inhaler. In early advertising, the company said the side effects were so benign that they were \"similar to a sugar pill,\" while the label said any distribution in the brain was \"minimal.\" Generic versions are still prescribed to millions of adults and children every year. But by 2019, thousands of reports of neuropsychiatric episodes, including dozens of suicides, in patients prescribed the drug had piled up on internet forums and in the US Food and Drug Administration’s tracking system. Such “adverse event” reports do not prove a causal link between a medicine and a side effect, but are used by the FDA to determine whether more study of a drug’s risks are warranted. After years of analysis, the reports and new scientific research led the FDA in 2020 to add a \"black box\" warning to the montelukast prescribing label, flagging serious mental health risks like suicidal thinking or actions. The agency also convened a group of internal experts around the same time to look into why the drug might trigger neuropsychiatric side effects. The results of the group's work, which are preliminary and have not been previously reported or released publicly, were presented to a limited audience at the American College of Toxicology meeting in Austin, Texas on Wednesday. Jessica Oliphant, a deputy director at FDA's National Center for Toxicological Research, said at the event that laboratory tests showed \"significant binding\" of montelukast to multiple receptors found in the brain. The FDA also confirmed earlier scientific research showing montelukast penetrates the brains of rats. More study is needed about how the drug accumulates in the nervous system, Oliphant said. \"These data indicate that montelukast is highest in brain regions known to be involved in (psychiatric effects),” she said. The FDA said it does not plan to update the drug label based on data from the presentation. \"SOMETHING THAT'S CONCERNING\" The behavior of montelukast appears similar to other drugs known to have neuropsychiatric effects, such as the antipsychotic risperidone, according to FDA slides reviewed by Reuters. The FDA has cautioned that its studies are ongoing, and results have not been finalized. When the FDA added the black box, it cited research from Julia Marschallinger and Ludwig Aigner at Austria's Institute of Molecular Regenerative Medicine. The two scientists told Reuters on Thursday the new data showed significant quantities of montelukast present in the brain. The receptors involved play a role in governing mood, impulse control, cognition and sleep, among other functions, they said. The research does not show whether that binding mechanism leads directly to harmful effects in individual patients, or who is particularly at risk, the two scientists said. However, Marschallinger said the new data bolsters reports from people who reported suffering side effects. \"It's definitely doing something that's concerning,\" she said. A Merck representative did not respond to questions. Organon, a Merck spinoff that now markets Singulair, said in a statement it is confident in the drug's safety profile. \"The product label for Singulair contains appropriate information regarding Singulair benefits, risks and reported adverse reactions,\" the company said. Reuters reported last year that the FDA had received thousands of reports of patients, including many children, experiencing depression, suicidal thoughts and behaviors, or other psychiatric problems after they began using montelukast. By 2019, the FDA tallied 82 suicides linked to Singulair and its generic versions reported to its adverse-event database since 1998. At least 31 of those reports involved someone age 19 or younger. Robert England's 22-year old son Nick killed himself in 2017 less than two weeks after starting montelukast. England recalls that his son had trouble sleeping before he died, and said he was completely healthy and had no mental health problems prior to taking the drug. \"He was on that medication for just days, literally just days,\" England said. \"It completely changed the trajectory of our lives.\" The Reuters report also detailed lawsuits alleging that Merck knew from its early research that the drug could impact the brain and minimized the potential for psychiatric problems in statements to regulators. Many of those lawsuits are still pending.",

    "text": "Scientists Destroy 99% of Cancer Cells in The Lab With Vibrating Molecules Health 05 April 2024 By David Nield Illustration of a cancer cell. (Science Photo Library/Canva Pro) Scientists have discovered a remarkable new way to destroy cancer cells . Stimulating aminocyanine molecules with near-infrared light caused them to vibrate in sync, enough to break apart the membranes of cancer cells.\nAminocyanine molecules are already used in bioimaging as synthetic dyes. Commonly used in low doses to detect cancer, they stay stable in water and are very good at attaching themselves to the outside of cells.\nHow the vibration mechanism works. ( Ciceron Ayala-Orozco et al., Nature Chemistry , 2023 ) The research team from Rice University, Texas A&M University, and the University of Texas, said the new approach is a marked improvement over another kind of cancer-killing molecular machine previously developed, called Feringa-type motors, which could also break the structures of problematic cells.\n\"It is a whole new generation of molecular machines that we call molecular jackhammers,\" said chemist James Tour from Rice University, when the results were published in December 2023.\n\"They are more than one million times faster in their mechanical motion than the former Feringa-type motors, and they can be activated with near-infrared light rather than visible light.\"\nThe use of near-infrared light is important because it enables scientists to get deeper into the body. Cancer in bones and organs could potentially be treated without needing surgery to get to the cancer growth .\nIn tests on cultured, lab-grown cancer cells, the molecular jackhammer method scored a 99 percent hit rate at destroying the cells. The approach was also tested on mice with melanoma tumors , and half the animals became cancer-free.\nThe structure and chemical properties of aminocyanine molecules mean they stay in sync with the right stimulus – such as near-infrared light. When in motion, the electrons inside the molecules form what's known as plasmons , collectively vibrating entities that drive movement across the whole of the molecule.\n\"What needs to be highlighted is that we've discovered another explanation for how these molecules can work,\" said chemist Ciceron Ayala-Orozco from Rice University.\n\"This is the first time a molecular plasmon is utilized in this way to excite the whole molecule and to actually produce mechanical action used to achieve a particular goal – in this case, tearing apart cancer cells' membrane.\"\nThe plasmons have an arm on one side, helping to connect the molecules to the cancer cell membranes while the movements of the vibrations bash them apart. It's still early days for the research, but these initial findings are very promising.\nThis is also the kind of straightforward, biomechanical technique that cancer cells would find it hard to evolve some sort of blockade against . Next, the researchers are looking at other types of molecules that can be used similarly\n\"This study is about a different way to treat cancer using mechanical forces at the molecular scale,\" said Ayala-Orozco.\nThe research has been published in Nature Chemistry .\nAn earlier version of this article was published in December 2023.",

    "text": "El ambiente en el corazón tecnológico de Estados Unidos, California, se respira tenso. La política ha vuelto a ser un tema tabú estos días . Las elecciones pasaron, los votantes demócratas reflexionan, los republicanos celebran y, mientras tanto, Trump da los últimos retoques a su polémico gabinete que entrará en el gobierno el próximo mes de enero.\nEl ciclo de noticias gira en torno a las guerras y a la próxima administración republicana y, mientras tanto, en Silicon Valley se deja la política de lado y se debate abiertamente sobre otra preocupación: los posibles límites de la inteligencia artificial .\nNo es una cuestión filosófica solamente, sino que también se cuestiona si la tecnología de aprendizaje automatizado puede seguir avanzando al mismo ritmo que lo ha hecho hasta ahora.\n¿Habrá límites para la inteligencia artificial? Hasta ahora, el rápido progreso que hemos experimentado en el campo desde 2022 dejaba entrever que la tecnología arrasaría con todo. Los saltos cualitativos entre ChatGPT 3.5 y ChatGPT 4.0 fueron considerables, pero al parecer, el fenómeno no se repetirá con los próximos modelos que se encuentran en desarrollo.\nEsta semana se filtró que OpenAI, la organización sin ánimo de lucro que se encuentra detrás de ChatGPT y trabaja en transformar su modelo de negocio, está encontrando problemas con el próximo modelo bautizado como Orion . Al parecer, la nueva versión no cumple con las expectativas.\nNo es la única firma con obstáculos. Google y su software de IA Gemini también se está topando con problemas y sus nuevos modelos no estarían a la altura, según filtraciones. Por su parte, el modelo 3.5 Opus de Anthropic no hace más que sufrir retrasos.\nLas inversiones millonarias que las compañías están realizando en sus productos de inteligencia artificial han visto fuertes retornos, pero el entrenamiento de estos nuevos modelos de aprendizaje automatizado más potentes están presentando problemas relacionados con el acceso a más información y datos: necesitan encontrar nuevas fuentes de las que alimentarse.\nLas grandes corporaciones de Silicon Valley y las startups dedicadas a la inteligencia artificial compiten en una carrera feroz por llegar a ser la primera en crear una Inteligencia Artificial General (IAG), un modelo capaz de realizar cualquier tarea intelectual humana de manera similar a como lo haría cualquier persona.\nA diferencia de la tecnología con la que contamos en la actualidad, diseñada para tareas concretas como reconocer o generar imágenes y generar texto, la IAG tendría la capacidad de comprender, aprender, y aplicar conocimientos de manera amplia y flexible sin ser limitada a un ámbito específico. Tendría conocimientos en todos los campos.\nEl objetivo no está muy lejos. Según expertos en el campo, estamos a escasos años de ver cómo la IAG se convierte en una realidad .\nSin embargo, los costes para llegar a esa meta son elevados. El entrenamiento de la inteligencia artificial requiere de millones de datos , un elemento finito y un recurso con el que las compañías parecen estar teniendo problemas. También se requieren centros de datos potentes, con procesadores de nueva generación y el consumo energético es considerable. Tal es así, que la única manera factible de alimentar la inteligencia artificial del futuro pasará por revivir las centrales nucleares, un secreto a voces en el sector.\nSon buenas noticias para aquellos que temían la inminente llegada de un nuevo orden mundial impuesto por la inteligencia artificial. El orden natural de las cosas ha logrado poner freno a su avance. Las entidades regulatorias podrían disponer, finalmente, del tiempo que necesitan para crear un marco regulatorio que controle el crecimiento y el uso de esta tecnología.\nNEWSLETTER - DISRUPTORES Las claves digitales de la semana todos los viernes en tu buzón Apuntarme De conformidad con el RGPD y la LOPDGDD, EL LEÓN DE EL ESPAÑOL PUBLICACIONES, S.A. tratará los datos facilitados con la finalidad de remitirle noticias de actualidad.",

    "text": "Free lunch funding cut from two Holyoke catholic schools HOLYOKE, Mass. (WGGB/WSHM) - Western Mass News is getting answers after a letter sent home to parents of two Holyoke catholic schools told families they can no longer provide free breakfast and lunch to students for the 2024/2025 school year. The letter outlines that the Mater Dolorosa and the Blessed Sacrament Schools received info from Holyoke Public Schools that the cut was made due to budgeting issues and negative data collection from the two catholic schools. Now, families who were utilizing the school’s free food program will have to find a way to fund kids’ meals. “During a meeting on July 31st, we were informed that both Mater Dolorosa and Blessed Sacrament School no longer qualify for free breakfast and lunch for the 2024/2025 school year. It was explained to us that this change is due to budgeting as well as negative data collection from both schools,” the letter stated. Further on in the letter, Springfield Superintendent of Diocesan Schools said in part: “After consultation with our office staff and Fr. Albert, we have come to a decision to discontinue the breakfast program due to logistics. We cannot diligently monitor the breakfast program daily, as breakfast items were delivered automatically based on total enrollment of students versus a daily lunch count scenario.” Now, families of the Mater Dolorosa and the Blessed Sacrament schools who were utilizing the program will now have pay $4.88 per lunch to continue to receive food through Holyoke Public Schools. Sodexo Group runs the meals program for Holyoke Public Schools, which also includes Mater Dolorosa and Blessed Sacrament. Sodexo told us today to reach out to the school district for a response as to why free breakfast and lunch was cut from these schools. We have yet to hear back. Copyright 2024.
