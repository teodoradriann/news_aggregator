(WFSB/Gray News) - A firefighter who was plowing the snowy streets of Trumbull, Connecticut, jumped into action to rescue four people and three dogs when he happened upon a house fire. [WFSB](https://www.wfsb.com/2024/01/07/firefighter-plowing-route-notices-house-fire-rescues-people-pets/) reports Shaun Bogen’s quick actions were credited with saving the lives of the victims. The [Long Hill Fire Department said](https://www.facebook.com/longhillfd/posts/pfbid0uNJskTAvbNXazDW3ybvZ3mLqGGpdjbSUJLsFGQJZQHEJpVsSWnDyBrfeSmbCzbr3l) the house fire on Haviland Drive began just before 4 a.m. Sunday. While he was on the plowing route, Bogen discovered a house with a fire in the garage, according to the fire department. Bogen radioed into his base to alert them of the fire and called 911. Bogen then sprung into action, waking up the four sleeping residents and their three dogs and making sure everyone was outside before the fire department arrived. A total of 26 firefighters responded to the fire, and the first unit to arrive found the fire most heavy in the garage and extending into the home. The firefighters brought the fire under control in less than one hour. Officials said there did not appear to be any injuries. The cause of the fire remains under investigation.

    "text": "03 Jan 2025 | 10:35 AM UTC\nAfghanistan: Adverse weather forecast across central and eastern regions through at least Jan. 6\nSevere weather forecast across central and eastern Afghanistan through at least Jan. 6. Road closures ongoing due to heavy snowfall.\nAdverse weather is forecast across central and eastern Afghanistan through at least Jan. 6. The Meteorology Department of the Ministry of Transport and Aviation has issued a warning for heavy snowfall, heavy rainfall, and strong winds across Kandahar, Zabul, Uruzgan, Ghor, Sar-e-Pol, Bamyan, Daykundi, Paktika, Ghazni, Paktia, Khost, Logar, Wardak, Samangan, Balkh, Kunduz, Baghlan, Parwan, Kabul, Panjshir, Nuristan, Takhar, Badakhshan, Kapisa, Nangarhar, Laghman, and Kunar provinces Jan. 3-4. Rainfall totals of 1.5-4 cm (0.6-1.6 inches) and snowfall accumulations of 10-40 cm (4-16 inches) are expected across the affected area. Strong winds gusting up to 100 kph (62 mph) are also forecast in central and northeastern provinces. Further precipitation is expected across the region Jan. 5-6. Several roads in the region are closed following heavy snowfall in recent days, including the Salang Pass linking northern Afghanistan to Parwan and Kabul provinces and sections of the Kabul-Bamyan Highway.\nSustained heavy rainfall could trigger flooding in low-lying communities near rivers, streams, and creeks. Urban flooding is also possible in developed areas with easily overwhelmed or a lack of stormwater drainage systems. Sites located downstream from large reservoirs or rivers may be subject to flash flooding after relatively short periods of intense rainfall.\nPrecipitation could fall as snow in the higher elevations over the coming days. Wind gusts could cause blowing and drifting snow; decreased visibility is likely in mountainous areas. Rain-induced landslides cannot be discounted in areas of elevated terrain; there is also the possibility of avalanches in mountainous areas where the snowpack has become unstable due to heavy snowfall. Disruptions to electricity and telecommunications services are possible where significant winds, flooding, or landslides impact utility networks.\nFloodwaters and debris flows may render some bridges, railways, or roadways impassable, impacting overland travel in and around affected areas. Ponding on road surfaces could cause hazardous driving conditions on regional highways. Authorities could temporarily close some low-lying routes that become inundated by floodwaters. Heavy snow will likely make driving hazardous in some areas; authorities could implement further temporary road closures or detours in such locations. Mountain passes and tunnels could be closed as a precautionary measure during periods of intense snowfall. Severe weather could also trigger flight delays and cancellations at regional airports.\nMonitor local media for weather updates and related advisories. Confirm all transport reservations and business appointments before travel. Make allowances for localized travel delays and potential supply chain disruptions where flooding has been forecast. Do not drive on flooded roads. Charge battery-powered devices in the case of prolonged electricity outages.",

    "text": "HALIFAX, N.S. — Carter Bickle of the Charlottetown Islanders and the Halifax Mooseheads’ Jack Milner engaged in an old-fashioned goaltending duel as the Quebec Maritimes Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) resumed play after the Christmas break on Dec. 28.\nBickle stopped 33 of 34 shots through regulation time and a five-minute overtime period and then denied the Mooseheads on all three attempts in the shootout as Charlottetown pulled out a 2-1 road win before 9,215 fans at Scotiabank Centre in Halifax.\nMilner turned aside 31 of 32 shots and two of three Charlottetown attempts in the shootout. Alexis Michaud scored on the Islanders’ first shot of the shootout, and that proved to be the difference.\nSimon Hughes of Stratford, P.E.I., scored his sixth goal of the season at 7:09 of the second period to pull the Islanders into a 1-1 tie. Mathew Butler earned the lone assist on the power-play goal.\nMarkus Vidicek, assisted by Dylan MacKinnon and Mathieu Cataford, opened the scoring for the Mooseheads at 19:41 of the first period.\nOnly three minor penalties were called in the fast-paced game. The Islanders were 1-for-2 on the power play, and Halifax went 0-for-1.\nThe victory improved the Islanders’ record to 15-17-1-1 while the Mooseheads fell to 22-9-4-1. The Mooseheads were missing the team’s No. 1 goaltender, Mathis Rousseau, forward Jordan Dumais (31 points in 21 games) and defenceman and captain Jake Furlong (20 points in 29 games), who are playing with Team Canada at the world junior hockey championship in Sweden.\nThe game’s three stars were: 1. Bickle (Islanders), 2. Jack Milner (Mooseheads), 3. Michaud (Islanders).\nThe Islanders are back on home ice at Eastlink Centre in Charlottetown against the Acadie-Bathurst Titan (15-17-1-2) on Dec. 29 at 7 p.m.",

    "text": "Happy Thursday! Mother Nature is cooking up quite the beautiful day across the Inland Northwest today. Temperatures are five to 10 degrees above where they usually are for the last week of December, and they'll be combined with dry weather for much of Eastern Washington both Thursday and Friday—although the LC Valley could see some pop up showers tonight and tomorrow afternoon. Expect partly cloudy skies throughout much of the region, with high temps in the low to mid 40s and overnight lows in the low to mid 30s. Areas in the Cascades will see showers—snowfall in higher elevations—off and on today and Friday, but they won't make their way to our neck of the woods like they did earlier this week. We're tracking a pattern shift Saturday night into Sunday, with some potential for light precipitation to return to the forecast. Still not quite sure on the exact location, timing and type of precipitation at this point, but we should be getting a better idea over the next 24 hours. Have a great Thursday!",
