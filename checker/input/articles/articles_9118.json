    "title": "Laura Flores desmiente que esté enferma: \"No sé de dónde salió esa información\"",
    "text": "Ciudad de México, México.-La reconocida actriz mexicana Laura Flores salió en sus redes sociales a desmentir que se encontrara enferma y que haya pedido ayuda al gobierno para poder salir de la presunta enfermedad que la aquejaba.\n“Me sorprende que una giró una información en torno mío de que yo estaba enferma, de que yo me encontraba mal. Es más, ni siquiera tengo toda la información, pero aparentemente yo estaba pidiendo ayuda porque estaba deprimida o algo así”, comenzó diciendo en su video que publicó en su cuenta de TikTok.\n“Bueno, pues les quiero decir que eso es totalmente falso, no sé de dónde salió esa información. Yo creo que a lo mejor alguien subió esta información de manera errada, a lo mejor alguien usó inteligencia artificial, no lo sé”, afirmó.\nAseguró que usaba su cuenta oficial de TikTok por la gran difusión que tiene “yo no estoy enferma de nada ni le he pedido ayuda a nadie”.\n“Si me pasara algo, claro que pediría ayuda, pero yo estoy bien. Digo, si alguien se está preocupando, les tengo que decir que yo estoy bien, pero para mí lo más importante es que la gente que está cercana a mí, pensando por mis hijos, mis hermanos, mi familia que sepan que yo estoy bien, que nadie se altere y también la gente con la que trabajo que no cunda el pánico, yo estoy bien gracias a Dios”, siguió diciendo.\n“Bueno, esto no es más que un chisme, les mando un beso a todos”, finalizó el video en el que se podía ver que estaba en el aeropuerto de Guatemala, con rumbo a Ciudad de México.\n[@laurafloresmx]aclaremos el punto amigos![#fyp][#parati][#foryou][#tiktok][♬ original sound - laurafloresmx]",

    "title": "'Further to the announcement...': Infosys lets go of more trainees from Mysuru campus, offers alternative roles",
    "text": "Infosys has reportedly terminated another batch of 30-45 trainees from its Mysuru campus on March 26 after they failed to clear internal assessments, reported Moneycontrol.\nThe IT services giant, however, is offering affected trainees an alternative career path, including a 12-week training programme for potential roles in Infosys Business Process Management (BPM). Those opting for this transition will have their training costs sponsored by Infosys.\nThe latest development follows a larger round of terminations earlier this year, where around 350 trainees were let go. Many of these freshers had already faced an onboarding delay of over 2.5 years.\nIn an email sent to trainees, Infosys reportedly stated \"Further to the announcement of the results of your final assessment attempt, please be informed that you have not met the qualifying criteria in the 'Foundation Skills Training Program' despite the additional preparation time, doubt-clearing sessions, and several mock assessment opportunities.\"\nBT could not independently verify the development.\nAlthough Infosys has not officially commented on the matter, the company is providing affected trainees with a one-month ex-gratia payment and a relieving letter. The article will be updated after Infosys releases an official statement.\nFor those unwilling to transition into BPM roles, Infosys has arranged transportation from Mysuru to Bengaluru, along with a standard travel allowance to their hometowns. Trainees can also avail accommodation at the Employee Care Centre in Mysuru until their departure date.\nFollowing earlier reports of terminations, the Karnataka Labour Department investigated the matter and found no labour law violations.\nThe inquiry was prompted by a directive from the Union Labour Ministry, which had asked the Karnataka Labour Commissioner and Labour Secretary to examine the issue and take necessary actions. However, Infosys has maintained that its policies clearly state freshers who fail assessments cannot continue with the organisation.\nCopyright©2025 Living Media India Limited.

    "text": "A Police Dossier: It is the British Who Murder Our Presidents\n“If you felt, and you really believed — and a lot of them do — that the worst thing that could happen to the country, and, more specifically, to you, in the professional class, is to have Donald Trump as president; and everything you have tried has failed; and they have been accelerating steps: protests, impeachment, indictment. How many more arrows do you have in your quiver? And what’s the next one? And, of course, it’s assassination.”\n— Tucker Carlson, in an interview with Dan Bongino, December 18, 2023\nPart 1—The British Empire is America’s Historic Enemy\nWhat you, the reader are about to embark on is a five-part series, titled “It is the British Who Murder Our Presidents.” This project was motivated by the deadly threat that now exists against the life of Donald Trump. The difficulty in this project is not “objective;” it is not that the evidence presented is faulty or difficult to understand. The difficulty is entirely subjective.\nThe threat to Trump is obvious and stark. “Russiagate,” two impeachments, the theft of the 2020 election, the raid on Mar-a-Lago, the multiple indictments, and the unconstitutional efforts to keep Trump off the 2024 Presidential ballot, are all out in the open. These have been shocking actions, all aimed at ending Constitutional government in the United States. More ominous, however, is that we are now witnessing increasing and reckless references to Donald Trump as “Hitler,” even by elected officials, with the obvious questions posed, “If you could go back in time to 1933 and kill Hitler before he seized power, wouldn’t you do it? Since Trump intends to seize dictatorial power in 2025, shouldn’t someone kill him now?” This is a pre-assassination environment.\nThe difficulty in this report is not in convincing the American people of this threat. The difficulty arises when we assert that “It is the British who kill American Presidents.” The difficulty is in getting people to see who the true enemy of our nation is. Our people, including perhaps you, have undergone decades of conditioning where it has been drummed into our consciousness that the British are our “closest ally,” our “cousins,” bound-at-the-hip by common bonds and a common cultural heritage. The dear British are simply our “funny accented” relatives. At the same time, a false hegemonic view has been imposed that the British Empire no longer exists, that Britain is now a third-rate has-been nation of little importance, that the British Royal household is just a curiosity for tourists.\nNone of this is true. The first thing to recognize is that the British Empire is and always has been primarily a FINANCIAL EMPIRE, a global system of usury, speculation, and financial dominance by the City of London. The City of London created the global system of private Central Banking in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Today, that private oligarchical system has near dictatorial control over the monetary and financial policies of almost every nation of the planet, as the fate of hundreds of millions of human beings is decided by the controllers of the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the U.S. Federal Reserve, and similar institutions. The City of London also created, in the 1960s and 70s the “offshore banking system,” imperial financial centers outside the control of sovereign nations, which today bankroll most of the world’s business in narcotics, illicit arms sales and human trafficking.\nIn the 18th century, the British Empire—which the 13 American colonies revolted against—had near monopoly control over global slave trafficking. In the 19th century the British Empire created global narcotics trafficking. Between 1815 and 1945 the British Empire killed more human beings than Hitler, Stalin and Mao Zedong combined. Unlike the American Republic, the British financial/economic system was never about human advancement or scientific and technological progress; it was a system of looting, exploitation, financial gain, and dominance by a monied oligarchy.\nFrom 1776, down to the present day, the PRINCIPLES enunciated in our Declaration of Independence and the Preamble to our Constitution have been anathema to the British elites. They have spent decades attempting to eradicate these principles from American culture, and they have been determined to corrupt America’s role into the world, to subvert America into becoming the enforcer of British imperial designs.\n“But” people say, “all of that is mostly in the past. I still don’t see Britain as a major factor today.” The mistake here is that one must stop looking at the nation-state of Great Britain and look at the actual far-flung imperial financial empire that exists and that is centered in London. Look also at the role of the British elites in the Satanic cultural onslaught of recent years, such as the “climate change” campaign, championed by King Charles. Look at the speakers at any COP conference or World Economic Forum conference. The elites who control these conferences are neither “American imperialists” nor “Communists.” British and other European oligarchical interests, together with their treasonous American partners, dominate these affairs. It is a world-wide web of central bankers, financial speculators, multi-national corporations and billionaire-funded private foundations and trusts. These are the true enemies of our nation and of every other sovereign nation. This is the 21st century British Empire.\nAn American Patriot\nIn 1851, a man named Henry Carey published a book, titled The Harmony of Interests. I will quote from a portion of that book, but first consider who Henry Carey was.\nCarey was the leading, the most famous and the most influential American economist of the 19th Century. He was an important advisor to President Abraham Lincoln. He wrote the economic plank in the 1860 Republican Party Presidential Platform. After 1865, he became the foremost champion of Abraham Lincoln’s issuance of Greenback sovereign currency, writing extensively on it, and he campaigned to defend the continued circulation of the Greenbacks after Lincoln’s death. He traveled in Europe and his intervention in Germany was crucial to the decision by Otto von Bismarck in 1869 to abandon the British free-trade policy and adopt the American system of tariffs and protectionism. He was a premier American patriot.\nIn his Harmony of Interests, Carey writes: [emphasis added]\n“Two systems are before the world; the one looks to increasing the proportion of persons and of capital engaged in trade and transportation, and therefore to diminishing the proportion engaged in producing commodities with which to trade, with necessarily diminished return to the labour of all; while the other looks to increasing the proportion engaged in the work of production, and diminishing that engaged in trade and transportation, with increased return to all, giving to the labourer good wages, and to the owner of capital good profits. . .\n“One looks to pauperism, ignorance, depopulation, and barbarism; the other in increasing wealth, comfort, intelligence, combination of action, and civilization. One looks towards universal war; the other towards universal peace. One is the English system; the other we may be proud to call the American system, for it is the only one ever devised the tendency of which was that of elevating while equalizing the condition of man throughout the world.\n“Such is the true mission of the people of these United States. . . To raise the value of labour throughout the world, we need only to raise the value of our own. To improve the political condition of man throughout the world, it is that we ourselves should remain at peace, avoid taxation for maintenance of fleets and armies, and become rich and prosperous. . . To diffuse intelligence and to promote the cause of morality throughout the world, we are required only to pursue the course that shall diffuse education throughout our own land, and shall enable every man more readily to acquire property, and with it respect for the rights of property. To substitute true Christianity for the detestable system known as the Malthusian, it is needed that we prove to the world that it is population that makes the food come from the rich soils, and food tends to increase more rapidly than population, thus vindicating the policy of God to man.”\nThe Nature of Our Current War\nIn subsequent chapters of this report, we shall offer some quotations from the American Presidents Donald Trump, Abraham Lincoln, William McKinley, and John F. Kennedy. In reading those quotes, it will be useful to reflect on what was quoted just above from Henry Carey. Even though the quotations from Lincoln, Trump, Kennedy, and McKinley are from different er. and delivered under different circumstances, there is a moral and philosophical thread that is common to all. America’s true role in the world is not to wage war, take advantage of weaker nations or exploit its own people. It is to act as a Temple of Hope and Beacon of Liberty for all mankind. And that role for America, the true identity of the American Republic, is rigorously defined in Henry Carey’s examination of American versus British economics.\nOne of the best examples which captures the Idea of America that our Founding Fathers fought and died for was written in 1778—amid the Revolutionary War—by Gouverneur Morris, later the author of our Constitution’s Preamble. It is called Observations on the American Revolution, and Morris wrote:\n“The portals of the Temple we have raised to Freedom, shall then be thrown wide, as an Asylum to mankind. America shall receive to her bosom and comfort and cheer the oppressed, the miserable and the poor of every nation and of every clime. The enterprise of extending commerce shall wave her friendly flag over the billows of the remotest region of the world. We shall learn to consider all men as our brethren, being equally children of the Universal Parent—that God of the heavens and of the earth, whose infinite Majesty, for providential favour during the late revolution, almighty power in our preservation from impending ruin, and gracious mercy in our redemption from the iron shackles of despotism, we cannot cease with gratitude and with deep humility to praise, to reverence and adore.”\nLincoln, McKinley, and Kennedy all fought to return America to this outlook. They looked to the future, to what could be built, what could be accomplished in the name of human progress and freedom. Theirs was a noble, optimistic, anti-imperial vision. For that they were killed.\nSo, we present, in the next four parts of this work, our Police Dossier on How and Why the British have murdered our Presidents.",
