    "title": "¡Histórico! Cristiano Ronaldo anota su gol 900 en el Portugal-Croacia",
    "text": "[Cristiano Ronaldo](/cronologia/-/meta/cristiano-ronaldo) El delantero portugués Cristiano Ronaldo alcanzó los 900 goles en su carrera este jueves, al marcar el segundo tanto de Portugal en el partido de la UEFA Nations League ante Croacia. El primer tanto llegó gracias a Diogo Dalot apenas en el minuto 8 de encuentro y posteriormente aumentó a cuenta el jugador del Al Nassr de Arabia Saudita. Cristiano Ronaldo (34’), con un remate con el pie derecho desde el corazón del área tras asistencia de Nuno Mendes, supone un hito más en la carrera de récord del jugador. El delantero suma 900 goles en 1238 partidos oficiales, con una media de casi 0,73 tantos por encuentro, que ha marcado con las camisetas de Sporting (5), del Manchester United (145), del Real Madrid (450), del Juventus (101) y del Al-Nassr (67). A su periplo en estos clubes se suman los 131 tantos que ha firmado con la selección de Portugal. La afición lusa recibió el gol de Cristiano con su ya famoso “Siuuu” y coreó el nombre del delantero de Madeira, que para celebrarlo se tiró al suelo en la línea de fondo con las manos en la cara y una sonrisa.",

Il dénonce une indexation insuffisante et revendique leur augmentation de 5% au 1er janvier 2025. Victoria Martin Selon le Syndicat des services publics (SSP), les salaires réels des employés de l’Etat ont diminué de 3,4% dans le canton depuis fin 2020. Il revendique une augmentation de 5% au 1er janvier 2025. Pour rappel, une indexation de 2,74% en 2023 et de 1,42% en 2024 avaient été octroyées. Le pouvoir d’achat des travailleurs en Suisse est sous pression, à cause notamment d’une mesure de l’inflation ne prenant pas en compte l’augmentation réelle des coûts de la vie, d’après le SSP. «Du jamais vu depuis la Seconde Guerre mondiale», peut-on lire dans son communiqué.

Il évoque par ailleurs «une redistribution sociale à l’envers» dénonçant entre autres, la baisse d’impôt sur les bénéfices, la défiscalisation des dividendes et leur accroissement (+ 6,3% entre 2022 et 2023 selon le syndicat).",

    "text": "Unlocking Personal Growth and Transformation: The Power of Understanding Emotions Internally\nPHOENIX, ARIZONA, UNITED STATES, April 4, 2024 / EINPresswire.com / -- Unlocking Personal Growth and Transformation: The Power of Understanding Emotions Internally\nIn the realm of personal growth and development, a profound wellspring of power awaits within each individualâ€”a deeply rooted ability to comprehend and process emotions internally. While external forces may shape experiences, internal dialogue and emotional intelligence propel individuals toward self-discovery and fulfillment. Delving into the significance of understanding one's emotions reveals the transformative impact it can have on personal growth.\nCentral to self-awareness is the capacity to recognize, acknowledge, and understand emotions. Rather than permitting emotions to dictate actions, individuals possess the capability to observe and interpret feelings with clarity and insight. This process of internal reflection offers valuable insights into thoughts, beliefs, and motivations, setting the stage for profound personal transformation.\nEmbracing emotions as messengers of deeper truths opens individuals to a wealth of self-discovery and growth opportunities. Each emotion serves as a valuable indicator of inner state, providing invaluable clues about needs, desires, and areas for potential growth. Whether it be feelings of joy, sadness, fear, or anger, each emotion carries its own unique wisdom, ready to be explored and understood.\nFurthermore, processing emotions internally cultivates greater resilience and emotional intelligence. Rather than reacting impulsively to external stimuli, individuals develop the capacity to respond thoughtfully and consciously to life's challenges. Through mindful observation and reflection, they learn to navigate the ebb and flow of emotions with grace and composure, harnessing their energy as a catalyst for growth.\nMoreover, understanding and processing emotions internally foster a deeper sense of self-compassion and acceptance. Instead of harsh self-judgment for experiencing certain emotions, individuals learn to embrace them with kindness and understanding, recognizing them as natural aspects of the human experience. In doing so, they cultivate a greater sense of self-love and acceptance, laying the foundation for authentic personal growth and development.\nIn essence, the power of understanding emotions and processing them internally lies in its ability to unlock true potential and facilitate profound personal transformation. By cultivating self-awareness, resilience, and compassion, individuals empower themselves to navigate life's challenges with grace and authenticity. Through this inward journey of exploration and self-discovery, they uncover the limitless possibilities that lie within, embarking on a path of growth, fulfillment, and self-actualization.\nDee Daniels\nVoiceAmerica\n+1 480-553-5741\nemail us here",

The initiative was introduced following a rise in stale food sales and the death of a 24-year-old man due to food poisoning in Oct last year.\nMunicipality initially assured that the app's administration panel would include officials from municipality, food safety department, legal metrology department and a representative from police department.\nDespite its promising launch, municipality officials revealed that the app remains non-functional, with no complaints received to date. Municipality chairperson Radhamani Pillai admitted its failure, stating, \"The app has not yielded the intended results; we will analyze what went wrong in its operation.\" Municipality health standing committee chairperson Varghese Plassery confirmed that health wing did not receive any complaints through the app.\nStay updated with breaking news , bank holidays and upcoming public holidays in march .\nEnd of Article FOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Tired of too many ads? go ad free now Trending Stories In City Entire Website Tired of too many ads? go ad free now",
