Lo ha affermato Jens Stoltenberg, segretario generale della Nato, durante la conferenza stampa congiunta con il presidente ucraino Volodymyr Zelensky a margine del vertice di Washington.\n“La riduzione delle restrizioni all’utilizzo delle armi a lungo raggio fornite dagli alleati all’Ucraina, che consente di colpire obiettivi militari in territorio russo, rientra nel quadro del diritto di autodifesa”, ha chiarito Stoltenberg.\n“Ci aspettiamo che nuovi sistemi di difesa siano consegnati velocemente per salvare più vite possibili. Se vogliamo vincere abbiamo bisogno che i nostri partner eliminino tutte le restrizioni sugli attacchi con le loro armi in territorio russo”, ha detto Zelensky, che si è detto “convinto che l’Ucraina sia vicina all’ingresso nella Nato. Il prossimo passo sarà l’invito formale e poi la piena membership”.\n– Foto xp6/Italpress –\n(ITALPRESS).\nDai blog\nControtempo []https://www.iltempo.it/blog/carlo-antini/2024/07/10/news/taylor-swift-concerto-san-siro-milano-eras-tour-pop-fa-impennare-economia-swiftonomics-39836019/\nTaylor Swift, così l'uragano pop fa impennare l'economia Carlo Antini https://www.iltempo.it/blog/carlo-antini/2024/07/02/news/gianni-togni-presenta-edizione-straordinaria-marziano-roma-tevere-39761894/\nIl nuovo Gianni Togni: \"Mi sento come un marziano a Roma\" Carlo Antini https://www.iltempo.it/blog/carlo-antini/2024/06/05/news/the-kolors-perche-sanremo-vinto-noi-nuovo-singolo-karma-39531181/\nLa verità dei The Kolors: \"Perché a Sanremo abbiamo vinto noi\" Carlo Antini",

    "text": "Between the end of February 2022 and the beginning of this month, 19,847 people have been detained in Russia for speaking out or protesting against the war, according to a rights group. Advertisement Artyom Kamardin, a Russian poet, received a 7-year prison sentence for reading anti-war verses during a street demonstration in Moscow in September 2022. Moscow's Tverskoy District Court convicted Kamardin on charges of undermining national security and inciting hatred. Yegor Shatovba, who attended the event and recited Kabardin's verses, was sentenced to 5 1/2 years on the same charges. Kamardin told the court that he did not know his actions broke the law and had asked for mercy. “I am not a hero and going to jail for my beliefs was never in my plans,” he said in a statement posted on his supporters' Telegram channel. The gathering next to a monument to poet Vladimir Mayakovsky was held days after President Vladimir Putin ordered the mobilization of 300,000 reserve troops amid Moscow's military setbacks in Ukraine. The widely unpopular move prompted thousands of people to flee Russia to avoid conscription. Police immediately dispersed the demonstration and soon arrested Kamardin and several other participants. Russian media quoted Kamardin's friends and her lawyer as saying that police beat and raped her during her arrest. Shortly thereafter, a police video released by pro-Kremlin media showed him apologizing for his actions, with bruises on his face. Authorities have taken no action to investigate alleged misconduct by police. During Thursday's hearing, Kamardin's wife, Alexandra Popova, shouted “Shame!” After shouting, he was thrown out of the courtroom by the bailiffs. After the decision. Popova and others were later detained for an unsanctioned “rally” outside the court building. According to the OVD-Info rights group, between the end of February 2022 and the beginning of this month, 19,847 people have been detained in Russia for speaking out or protesting against the war, while 794 people have been criminally charged because of their anti-war stance. Has been implicated in the cases. Monitors political arrests and provides legal assistance. The action comes under a law adopted days after Moscow sent troops into Ukraine that effectively criminalizes any public expression about the war that deviates from the official narrative.",

    "title": "L'Oreal heir becomes first woman with $100 billion fortune",
    "text": "Francoise Bettencourt Meyers became the first woman to amass a $100 billion fortune this week, marking another milestone for the heiress and for France's expanding fashion and cosmetics industries. Her wealth jumped to $100.2 billion on Thursday, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The milestone came as shares of L'Oréal SA, the beauty products empire founded by her grandfather, rose to a record high, with the stock set for its best year since 1998.\nDespite the gain, Bettencourt Meyers' fortune is still significantly less than that of French compatriot Bernard Arnault, founder of luxury goods purveyor LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE, who was second in the global ranking with $179.4 billion as of Wednesday's close. France's growing domination of luxury retail has spawned several other ultra-rich families, including the clan behind Hermes International SCA, who have amassed Europe's largest family fortune, and the Wertheimer brothers who own Chanel.\nThe reclusive Bettencourt Meyers, 70, is vice-chair of the board of L'Oréal, a globe-spanning €241 billion ($268 billion) company in which she and her family are the single biggest shareholders with a stake of nearly 35%. Her sons, Jean-Victor Meyers and Nicolas Meyers, are also directors. Run by executives from outside the family for decades, the firm was founded in 1909 by Bettencourt Meyers' chemist grandfather, Eugene Schueller, to produce and sell a hair dye he had developed.\nBettencourt Meyers keeps her life private, shunning the glitzy social life sought by many the world's wealthy. She has written two books — a five-volume study of the Bible and a genealogy of the Greek gods — and is known for playing piano for hours every day.\nStock rebound As an only child, Bettencourt Meyers came into her wealth following the 2017 death of her mother, Liliane Bettencourt, with whom she had an at times contentious relationship. A legal battle in the aughts grew from a family feud to a political scandal that centered on whether the elderly mother was fit to manage the family's wealth. Last month, Netflix Inc. came out with a three-part documentary, L'Affaire Bettencourt, relating the saga that featured a former French president and secret recordings made by a butler.\nL'Oréal grew rapidly in the decade leading up to the pandemic but took a hit during the health crisis when people under lockdown used less makeup. That was followed by a rapid rebound as consumers splurged on luxury items, sending the shares up 35% this year.\nThe company's stock could rise another 12% over the next year as its product and geographic diversity shows resilience, according to Consumer Edge Research analyst Brett Cooper.\nBettencourt Meyers also chairs her family's holding company, Téthys, which has the L'Oréal stake. Her husband, Jean-Pierre Meyers, is chief executive. In 2016, the two set up subsidiary Téthys Invest SAS, which bets on areas that don't compete with the company.\nWith the stated intention of making \"direct long-term investments in entrepreneurial projects,\" the CEO of Téthys Invest is Alexandre Benais, a former Lazard Ltd. investment banker.\nTéthys Invest recently acquired a stake in French insurance broker April Group. Last year, it bought into decade-old fashion brand Sezane, and has also invested in French private hospital operator Elsan. The firm is partly funded by L'Oréal dividends.\nWith assistance from Angelina Rascouet and Jack Witzig",
