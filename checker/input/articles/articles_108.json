    "text": "Religion « Situation préoccupante » pour le pape François, toujours dans un état critique\nLe pape François, hospitalisé pour une pneumonie et dont l'état de santé était « critique » samedi soir, « a passé une nuit tranquille », a annoncé dimanche le Vatican.\nAprès plusieurs jours d'accalmie, l'état de santé du pape François s'est dégradé ces dernières 24 heures. Le pontife argentin de 88 ans, pour lequel le diagnostic des médecins était « réservé » samedi soir, a toutefois « passé une nuit tranquille et s'est reposé » à l'hôpital Gemelli de Rome, a annoncé le Vatican sur sa chaîne Telegram.\nLe chef de l'Église catholique est hospitalisé depuis le 14 février pour une pneumonie des deux poumons et son état s'est dégradé samedi avec « une crise asthmatique prolongée qui a nécessité l'application d'oxygène à haut débit », selon le dernier bulletin de santé. « Les analyses de sang effectuées aujourd'hui ont également révélé une thrombopénie (baisse du nombre de plaquettes sanguines), associée à une anémie, qui a nécessité l'administration d'une transfusion sanguine.\nProchains jours « déterminants »\nLe Saint-Père reste alerte et a passé la journée dans un fauteuil, bien qu'il souffre davantage qu'hier. Le pronostic est actuellement réservé », a précisé le Vatican dans ce communiqué au ton d'une rare gravité. Dès vendredi après-midi les médecins qui s'occupent du pape avaient mis en garde sur la fragilité de la situation. « Le pape est-il hors de danger ? Non, le pape n'est pas hors de danger », avait affirmé le Pr Sergio Alfieri lors d'une conférence de presse à l'hôpital Gemelli. « Le vrai risque dans ces cas-là est que les germes passent dans le sang », provoquant ainsi une septicémie potentiellement mortelle, avait-il expliqué.\n« La situation est devenue plus préoccupante », a déclaré le virologue Fabrizio Pregliasco, cité dimanche par le quotidien La Stampa. « L'âge du Saint Père, ainsi que les antécédents de santé, comme par exemple la bronchite asthmatique, pourraient avoir compliqué les choses et pas qu'un peu », détaille-t-il. « Il faut espérer que la thérapie antibiotique fonctionne pour éviter le risque d'une septicémie, une infection systémique, qui peut avoir une issue fatale. Le pape est certainement en de bonnes mains mais les prochaines heures et les prochains jours seront déterminants », estime l'expert.\nPrières à travers le monde\nIl sera hospitalisé au moins toute la semaine prochaine et il ne dirigera pas dimanche, pour la deuxième fois d'affilée, la prière de l'Angélus. En début de matinée, une messe se tiendra au Vatican lors de laquelle le pro-préfet du dicastère pour l'Évangélisation lira l'homélie préparée par le pape. Plusieurs responsables religieux et politiques ont dit prier pour le pape. Depuis samedi soir sur les réseaux sociaux, les internautes ont aussi posté des centaines de messages disant prier pour François, beaucoup postant une photo de l'évêque de Rome seul sur la place Saint-Pierre lors de la pandémie de Covid-19.\nFrançois a été hospitalisé initialement pour une bronchite, mais le Saint-Siège a révélé mardi qu'il avait développé une pneumonie dans les deux poumons, une infection du tissu pulmonaire potentiellement mortelle. Cette hospitalisation, la quatrième depuis 2021, suscite de vives inquiétudes alors que le pape a déjà été affaibli par une série de problèmes ces dernières années, allant d'opérations du côlon et de l'abdomen à des difficultés à marcher.\nL'hospitalisation du pape, à la fois chef spirituel des 1,4 milliard de catholiques dans le monde et chef de l'Etat de la Cité du Vatican, a relancé les interrogations autour de sa capacité à assurer sa charge, alors que le droit canonique ne prévoit aucune disposition en cas de problème grave qui altèrerait sa lucidité.",

Picture: Getty By Kieran Kelly\n@kellyjourno Nigel Farage has said he is \"dismayed\" after a Reform UK canvasser was filmed calling Rishi Sunak a \"f g p**i\" by an undercover reporter.\nListen to this article Loading audio... The footage was taken by Channel 4 News in Clacton, where Mr Farage hopes to become an MP in next week's General Election.\nThe comments were made by Andrew Parker, who has since issued an apology.\n“I’ve always been a Tory voter,” he was filmed saying.\n“But what annoys me is that f---ing P--- we’ve got in. What good is he? You tell me, you know. He’s just wet. F---ing useless.”\nRead More: Nigel Farage is 'cuddling up to the Kremlin', says ex-Nato boss amid claims West provoked Russia into invading Ukraine\nNigel Farage. Picture: Getty In a statement, Mr Parker responded: “I would like to make it clear that neither Nigel Farage personally or the Reform Party are aware of my personal views on immigration.”\nResponding to the footage, the Reform UK leader said: “I am dismayed by the reported comments of a handful of people associated with my local campaign, particularly those who are volunteers.\n“The appalling sentiments expressed by some in these exchanges bear no relation to my own views, those of the vast majority of our supporters or Reform UK policy. Some of the language used was reprehensible.”\nIt comes less than two weeks after a Reform UK parliamentary candidate resigned after social media comments emerged in which he called on people to vote for the British National Party.\nCaller Francis: \"Opportunists only exist because someone else has opened the door for them'\nGrant StClair-Armstrong, who was standing in Kemi Badenoch’s constituency in North West Essex, was also found to have posted jokes using racial slurs and about “female hormones”, according to The Times.\nMeanwhile, an LBC investigation found that Reform UK candidate Steve Chilcott said ‘Islam and Nazis are the same thing’ during a public 2017 rant.\nA video of the father of one, who’s standing in the Ealing Southall constituency in West London, was posted online at the time, in which he also said Paris was “full of Islamic, immigrant, scum”.\nLBC has also unearthed previously unseen footage, filmed by one of our reporters in 2018, of Mr Chilcott saying the “only reason” Islam was growing was because of a “lack of contraception”.\nRead More: Zelensky says Farage 'infected by Putinism' as Reform leader doubles down on Ukraine comments\nReform’s leader Nigel Farage and chairman Richard Tice have publicly defended the party’s vetting process for candidates, but last month, Tice admitted to LBC that they rely on the media to do certain background checks for them.\nAnother Reform UK candidate was forced to apologise after suggesting the country would have been “far better” off if it had “taken Hitler up on his offer of neutrality” during the Second World War.\nMr Farage said it was ‘utter cobblers’ that Reform UK candidates had voiced ’Nazi sympathies’ as he took calls from listeners on LBC earlier this month.\nHe was confronted on air with comments made by individuals standing for Reform UK, including one who described the pandemic as a ‘health holocaust’ and a another who said vaccine firms were like ‘Nazi armament companies.”\nMr Farage dismissed the remarks, saying: “People chuck stuff around on Facebook and they like comments.”\nMore Latest News See more More Latest News\nLive LIVE: Biden freezes and stutters as he faces off against Trump in first US Presidential debate of 2024 campaign What to expect in tonight's crucial TV debate between President Joe Biden and Donald Trump Exclusive Rishi Sunak called the election because he wants to ‘get out of government’, Rory Stewart suggests EasyJet cancel flights to summer holiday hotspots last minute affecting hundreds of passengers Officials ‘hopeful’ Princess Kate will attend Wimbledon after lifting nation with appearance at Trooping the Colour Just Stop Oil ‘key’ organisers arrested by Met Police ahead of plans to disrupt airports over summer 101-year-old woman among two injured after being caught and dragged by Tube doors Phil Foden welcomes third child with girlfriend Rebecca Cooke ahead of England's clash with Slovakia at Euro 2024 Starmer accuses Tories of ‘desperate' tactics over shock election attack ad of family with their hands up TV star paramedic, 24, and girlfriend shared romantic 'date night' snaps just days before they were found dead Three million UK households face rise in mortgage payments rise in next two years Met officer charged after ‘stealing money from body of dead man’ FBI offers $5m reward for most wanted fugitive 'Cryptoqueen' Ruja Ignatova Jay Slater 'unlikely to have survived' in 'immense' mountain wilderness of Tenerife, police fear Luvvies for Labour!
