    "title": "Chennai Temple Volunteers Bridge Communal Divide, Serve Iftar to Muslims During Ramzan",
    "text": "In an inspiring display of communal harmony, volunteers from a Chennai temple have been serving iftar meals to their Muslim brethren throughout the holy month of Ramzan, exemplifying Hindu-Muslim unity in action. This tradition, spanning over four decades, not only strengthens interfaith relationships but also highlights the underlying unity in diversity that forms the bedrock of India's cultural ethos.\nAdvertisment Unity in Diversity The initiative, which began modestly over 40 years ago, has grown into a much-anticipated annual event, drawing attention from both communities and beyond. Volunteers from the Hindu temple meticulously prepare and serve a variety of dishes, ensuring that the iftar meals are both nutritious and in keeping with the dietary laws observed during Ramzan. The act of sharing food, a fundamental expression of love and respect, serves as a bridge between the Hindu and Muslim communities, fostering a sense of brotherhood and mutual understanding.\nA Symbol of Harmony Advertisment This gesture of goodwill transcends religious boundaries, demonstrating that faith can serve as a unifying, rather than divisive, force in society. The temple's initiative is a powerful rebuttal to narratives of communal discord, showcasing how acts of kindness and cooperation can pave the way for lasting peace and harmony. It is a vivid reminder that at the heart of all religions is the call to serve and respect one another, irrespective of one's faith.\nImplications for the Future The continued success of this initiative offers hope for a future where interfaith harmony is the norm rather than the exception. By setting an example of empathy, respect, and unity, the volunteers at the Chennai temple are not only making a significant contribution to their local community but are also inspiring others across the nation to embark on similar endeavors. Their actions remind us that the foundation of a peaceful society is built on understanding, respect, and cooperation among its diverse members.",

    "text": "Key Takeaways - Recent playlist changes in Black Ops 6 removed the popular Stakeout 24/7 and Nuketown 24/7 playlists. - Community backlash arises from the absence of beloved playlists in favor of less popular options. - Future playlists may bring back Stakeout 24/7 and Nuketown 24/7 as developers refine map combinations. Stakeout 24/7 and Nuketown 24/7 have been removed from the available Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 playlists, and many players are unhappy. Many Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 gamers choose playlists instead of selecting specific game modes, but recent changes may affect that. Since it was released, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 has offered traditional game modes like Team Deathmatch, Domination, Hardpoint, and more. While many players filter between these game modes for matchmaking, others gravitate towards the playlists. Chosen game modes could occur on any of the 10 standard maps, while playlists allow players to stick to one specific map with rotating modes. When Nuketown was introduced to Black Ops 6 on November 1, it joined Stakeout 24/7 as a popular way for players to earn more weapon XP. One new change to these playlists has resulted in some players expressing their frustration. [Related ](/call-of-duty-cod-black-ops-6-warzone-blackcell-bp-worth-it/) [ Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 - What Is BlackCell? (Is It Worth The Money?) ](/call-of-duty-cod-black-ops-6-warzone-blackcell-bp-worth-it/) Black Ops 6 and Warzone reintroduce the BlackCell Battle Pass for players to purchase, but is it worth it? Here's all you need to know. Reddit users NothingToDreamAbout, OxyClean_, and Productive1990 are among many players voicing their displeasure with Black Ops 6 Season 1's playlist changes. The two notably missing playlists in the latest rotation are Stakeout 24/7 and Nuketown 24/7. While Nuketown is still offered in what's now called Radioactive 24/7, it's featured alongside Warhead. Although it references Nuketown, Warhead is among the least popular Call of Duty maps. This is because it's mostly a desert location, with a central building acting as the key combat zone. This is amplified by the absence of Stakeout, which has been praised as one of Black Ops 6's best Multiplayer maps . Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Fans Miss Previous Playlists - Nuketown 24/7 - Stakeout 24/7 The current playlists available in Black Ops 6 are Gunfight, Radioactive 24/7, Ransack, and Season 1 Moshpit. Since playlists were introduced to Call of Duty, rotating through different lists is nothing new. As the game is expected to get more maps in the future, the game will likely get new playlists that the community may prefer over the current lineup. One key reason the latest changes have affected the player base is that this is the first major alteration to the offerings, and it's being perceived as a downgrade from what was already there. Although they're missing with the launch of Black Ops 6 Season 1 , Nuketown 24/7 and Stakeout 24/7 could return in the future. Because Black Ops 6 is still in its early days, developers may still be trying to figure out the best map combinations for playlists. As Treyarch continues to update Black Ops 6 , future playlists may bundle appropriate maps like Modern Warfare 2's Shoot the Ship.",

Sin embargo, de acuerdo con el ente acusador, esta figura se utilizó como una maniobra para eludir procesos públicos de contratación más transparentes.\nEstas acciones ocurrieron apenas dos semanas después de que el entonces secretario Torres asumiera el cargo, en medio de las renuncias masivas de varios miembros del gabinete distrital para unirse a la campaña presidencial de Gustavo Petro.\nCon esta diligencia, ya son al menos 39 los exfuncionarios de la administración de Daniel Quintero imputados por diferentes hechos. Cabe recordar que, en el caso del exmandatario, la audiencia se retomaría el próximo 21 de abril, mientras el despacho analiza los elementos entregados por la Fiscalía para definir la legalidad de la imputación, pues varios abogados defensores de los implicados aseguraron que la intervención de la fiscal no fue clara ni presentó adecuadamente los hechos jurídicamente relevantes del caso.",

    "text": "Key Takeaways - Subnautica 2 was announced at the Xbox Partner Preview. - Early access is coming via Xbox in early 2025. - It will be a singleplayer-focused experience with the option for 4-player multiplayer. Subnautica 2, the follow-up to Subnautica and Subnautica: Below Zero, was announced at today's Xbox Partner Preview with a cinematic trailer. The game will be entering early access via the Xbox Game Preview program in early 2025 and will be available on Game Pass on day one. In Subnautica 2, you'll be able to play with up to four players in cooperative multiplayer. According to an article by Unknown Worlds Entertainment's community manager Donya Abramo on Xbox Wire , Subnautica 2 will take place in a setting \"beyond Planet 4546B\" and allow you to \"explore lush new environments, encounter fascinating creatures around every corner, and uncover the secrets at the core of this mysterious planet.\" A Return To The Deep \"As we build up to the release of Subnautica 2 (Game Preview) in 2025, we'll be sharing even more about what to expect from the game. From new and improved tools, vehicles, and base building, to a whole host of creatures big and small, the likes of which have never been seen before!\" the post reads. Unknown Worlds had previously announced that early access may be coming in 2024, but we now know for sure that we'll be able to head back into the depths early next year. There had been murmurings that Subnautica 2 would be a live-service title , but Krafton clarified that this wasn't the case and that the game would be \"singleplayer-focused with a co-op mode\" with additional content scheduled to arrive post-release, but not traditional live-service elements. According to an internal document, the sequel is also leaving behind the Unity engine in favour of Unreal Engine 5, but that wasn't touched upon in today's announcement. The original Subnautica was released in 2014 and became an indie darling as players enjoyed a fresh take on the survival crafting genre. Unknown Worlds followed up Subnautica with a spin-off, Subnautica: Below Zero in 2019. Below Zero would add more land-based areas to explore, a switch-up from its predecessor. Subnautica 2 is set for release at an unknown date in \"early 2025.\" A survivor of a crash onto a large, oceanic planet, Subnautica sees you try to survive. You must gather materials you need to explore, build a base, and figure out the planet's past.",

    "title": "DOJ Threatens to Sue Texas Over Border Security Law",
    "text": "By Michael Katz | Thursday, 28 December 2023 05:01 PM EST The Department of Justice has threatened Texas Gov. Greg Abbott that it will sue the state if Texas implements legislation allowing police to remove people from the country who are suspected of crossing the border illegally. Senate Bill 4 gives state and local law enforcement the ability to arrest people they believe are in the country illegally. It was passed by the Legislature in November during a special session called by Abbott and signed into law Dec. 18 by the governor. It takes effect March 5. In a letter to Abbott, according to the Houston Chronicle, the DOJ wrote that if he does not confirm by Jan. 3 the state will not enforce Senate Bill 4, \"the United States will pursue all appropriate legal remedies to ensure that Texas does not interfere with the functions of the federal government.\" Under the umbrella of Operation Lone Star, Texas has implemented strict border policies in defiance of the Biden administration, which contends it alone has authority over immigration enforcement. The DOJ filed a lawsuit in July over a 1,000-foot-long string of buoys the state placed in the Rio Grande River, which separates Texas from Mexico, to deter illegal immigrants from crossing. A U.S. District Court judge issued a preliminary injunction in August that ordered Texas to remove the buoys, but the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans in September granted the state's request to halt the injunction. The Fifth Circuit also issued a preliminary injunction Dec. 19 prohibiting Border Patrol agents from cutting razor wire the state put up along a 29-mile stretch of the Rio Grande in Eagle Pass, Texas. The DOJ in its letter pointed to a 2012 Supreme Court ruling in Arizona v. United States that struck down key parts of an Arizona law that sought to deter illegal immigration but let stand a provision allowing police to check a person's immigration status while enforcing other laws. Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in his majority opinion of the 5-3 decision that \"The National Government has significant power to regulate immigration. Arizona may have understandable frustrations with the problems caused by illegal immigration while that process continues, but the State may not pursue policies that undermine federal law.\" The DOJ's letter stated, \"Indeed, the Supreme Court has confirmed that 'the removal process' must be 'entrusted to the discretion of the Federal Government' because a 'decision on removability' touches 'on foreign relations and must be made with one voice.'\" The American Civil Liberties Union of Texas and the Texas Civil Rights Project filed a lawsuit Dec. 19 challenging the Texas law, claiming it is unconstitutional and that it is preempted by federal law.

The district is also accused of violating the Texas Open Meetings Act when making decisions about its former superintendent Christie Whitbeck&#039;s abrupt retirement. “The district will fully cooperate with TEA’s investigation,” said Fort Bend ISD Superintendent Dr. Marc Smith in the statement. “We are dedicated to being transparent and will provide all requested information.” “It is a new day in Fort Bend ISD with a new administration,” Fort Bend ISD Board President Kristin Tassin said in the statement. “Our board intends to work with Dr. Smith to ensure our district fully cooperates with the TEA and is transparent with our community.” Read the full statement from FBISD below: The Texas Education Agency (TEA) has notified the district it will investigate complaints that the district unlawfully incentivized students and staff to vote in last year&#039;s 2023 VATRE election and engaged in electioneering, as well as a complaint that trustees violated the Texas Open Meetings Act when making employment decisions regarding the district’s former superintendent. “The district will fully cooperate with TEA’s investigation,” Fort Bend ISD Superintendent Dr. Marc Smith said. “We are dedicated to being transparent and will provide all requested information.” “It is a new day in Fort Bend ISD with a new administration,” Fort Bend ISD Board President Kristin Tassin said. “Our board intends to work with Dr. Smith to ensure our district fully cooperates with the TEA and is transparent with our community.” KHOU 11 on social media: Facebook | X | Instagram | YouTube",

    "text": "Thaïlande Canicule en Asie du Sud-Est : des îles paradisiaques mythiques en soif d'eau Alors que la température maximale ressentie a dépassé les 52°C à Bangkok, l'archipel touristique de Koh Phi-Phi est en pénurie d'eau depuis des mois. En Thaïlande, l'archipel touristique de Koh Phi-Phi, rendu célèbre par le film La Plage avec Leonardo DiCaprio, et d'autres îles paradisiaques souffrent actuellement d'une grave pénurie d'eau, ont déclaré jeudi un responsable du tourisme et des habitants de la région. Situé au large de Phuket, Koh Phi Phi attire chaque année des centaines de milliers de visiteurs pour ses plages de sable blanc et ses eaux turquoises. Mais ces dernières semaines, [une vague exceptionnelle de chaleur sèche s'est abattue sur toute l'Asie du Sud-Est](/environnement/2024/04/29/pres-de-50-c-en-birmanie-une-chaleur-extreme-accable-l-asie-du-sud-est), faisant tomber les records et baisser de façon draconienne le niveau des réservoirs. Les hôtels se vident « La compagnie privée qui fournit de l'eau aux îles pourrait devoir arrêter l'approvisionnement », a déclaré Wichupan Phukaoluan Srisanya, présidente de l'Association des hôteliers de la région de Krabi. « Mais nous voulons assurer aux touristes qui prévoient de visiter les îles que nous pouvons gérer cette situation », a-t-elle ajouté. Les autorités envisagent d'acheminer de l'eau depuis le continent si la saison des pluies tarde à arriver. Des habitants, qui ont demandé à ne pas être nommés, ont déclaré que les pénuries d'eau duraient depuis des mois et que certains hôtels étaient presque vides à cause de cela. Sur le site d'évaluation TripAdvisor, un internaute a écrit que l'eau ne coulait plus dans son hôtel et d'autres messages invitaient les voyageurs de « vérifier que leur logement dispose d'eau douce » avant le séjour. Une température ressentie dépassant les 52°C Dans le golfe de Thaïlande, Koh Samui, une autre île touristique très populaire, a connu un temps sec et chaud similaire, mais les visiteurs n'ont pas été affectés, selon l'office de tourisme local. Un camion-citerne fait des allers-retours avec le continent, « mais cela multiplie par trois le coût de fonctionnement des hôtels », a déclaré Ratchaparon Poolsawadee, président de l'association touristique de Koh Samui. Pendant près d'une semaine en avril, les autorités de Bangkok ont émis quotidiennement des avertissements de chaleur extrême, la « température ressentie » ayant dépassé les 52°C. Le changement climatique induit par l'homme entraînera des canicules plus fréquentes, plus longues et plus intenses, avertissent régulièrement les scientifiques. Si le phénomène El Niño contribue au climat exceptionnellement chaud de cette année, l'Asie se réchauffe également plus rapidement que la moyenne mondiale, selon l'Organisation météorologique mondiale de l'ONU. Une île fermée à cause d'un blanchissement de coraux L'accès à l'île de Pling et aux récifs de coraux se trouvant autour du parc national de Sirinart à Phuket est temporairement fermé en raison du blanchissement important de coraux [causé par la hausse de la température de l'eau](/environnement/2024/03/07/temperature-record-des-oceans-vers-une-extinction-massive-des-coraux) qui y a été observé, a indiqué le Département des parcs nationaux et de la conservation de la faune et de la flore (DNP). La fermeture de l'accès ce jeudi à ces sites intervient en raison du stress thermique subi par les récifs coralliens à la suite d'une vague de chaleur exceptionnelle qui a affecté ces dernières semaines la Thaïlande et l'ensemble de l'Asie du Sud-Est. Le DPA surveille également la situation dans les parcs nationaux à Koh Chang, Koh Samet, Chumphon, Koh Surin, Phang Nga Bay, les îles Phi Phi et à Lanta. En avril, l'Agence américaine d'observation océanique et atmosphérique (NOAA) avait averti que le monde connaissait actuellement, pour la deuxième fois en dix ans, un épisode massif de blanchissement des coraux du fait de températures océaniques records.",

    "text": "‘We’re teared out’: School district mourns the loss of principal killed in crash after basketball game DALHART, Texas (KFDA/Gray News) - One Texas community is mourning the loss of their high school principal after he was killed in a crash after a basketball game. Scot Wright, who was the principal at Dalhart High School, was returning home from the basketball game Tuesday night when he was involved in a head-on collision with a semi around 1 a.m. [KFDA](https://www.newschannel10.com/2024/01/25/community-remembers-dalhart-principal-who-died-crash/) reports Wright later died at the hospital. Jeff Byrd, the school district’s superintendent, said Wright was loved by many in the community and he leaves a lasting impact. “He was just a great man and a great friend and we’re sad, we’re teared out, but he was a great man and we love him. We’re gonna miss him,” Byrd said. Byrd said he sees the glass as half full despite the tragedy and he encourages the community to celebrate the positive impact Wright had at Dalhart High School. “I can assure you, in the six years that Scot Wright was the principal here, he touched and changed many lives and set examples for our students they’ll carry with them throughout their lives,” Byrd said. The City of Dalhart is no stranger to tragedy, as it has lost several students as well as its [fire chief and a firefighter](https://www.newschannel10.com/2023/10/05/memorial-unveiled-late-dalhart-fire-chief-firefighter-killed-crash/) over the last few years, according to KFDA. “We have met our quota, we obviously don’t want to deal with this anymore. But at the end of the day we’re firm believers in God’s plan and this was part of God’s plan and God’s never gonna give us more than we’re capable of handling,” Byrd said. Wright is survived by his wife Torri, who serves as a school nurse for the district, and his two children. The school district plans to coordinate with students on how to celebrate Wright’s life.

    "text": "Temporal La DANA regresa a Mallorca: alerta naranja de la AEMET y aviso del Govern a la ciudadanía Se esperan precipitaciones acumuladas de 50 litros por metro cuadrado en una hora en toda la isla Duna Márquez Mallorca se encuentra en alerta naranja durante este viernes 1 de noviembre por la [DANA](/tags/dana/) (sigla de depresión aislada en niveles altos) que ha dejado al menos 155 de fallecidos y decenas de desaparecidos en la provincia de Valencia. El pasado lunes, Manacor vivió los efectos de este fenómeno meteorológico con fuertes precipitaciones que dejaron 174 litros por metro cuadrado que provocaron inundaciones, carreteras cortadas e intervenciones de los Bomberos de Mallorca, una de ellas en la Rafa Nadal Academy. Para este viernes se espera que regrese la DANA. La Agencia Estatal de Meteorología ha activado la alerta naranja en toda la isla por precipitaciones acumuladas de 50 litros por metro cuadrado en una hora, llegando a acumularse 120 litros por metro cuadrado en algunas zonas de la isla en pocas horas. Las lluvias se mantendrán hasta el sábado 2 de noviembre, alargándose el aviso naranja hasta primera hora de la mañana. Con el avance de las horas la alerta desaparecerá, pero las precipitaciones se mantendrán a lo largo del día. El Govern pide \"máxima prudencia\" Ante la emergencia meteorológica para este día de Tots Sants, el Govern balear ha reclamado “máxima prudencia” a los ciudadanos “las próximas horas y días” por la alerta naranja decretada. Se recomienda que se tomen precauciones y mantenerse informado de la predicción meteorológica más actualizada. Las actividades habituales y al aire libre pueden verse alteradas. El Servicio de Emergencias 112 ha activado el Índice de Gravedad 1 (IG1) del Plan Meteobal por lluvias y tormentas en [Mallorca](/tags/mallorca/) y Menorca. Para coordinar posibles actuaciones conjuntas, la Dirección General de Emergencias ha reunido esta mañana al Grupo de Soporte Técnico del Plan con representantes, entre otros, de los Bomberos del Consell de Mallorca, Bomberos de Palma, Cuerpo Nacional de Policía, Guardia Civil, AEMET, Carreteras del Consell de Mallorca, Ibanat, SAMU 061, Recursos Hídricos y RiscBal. Recomendaciones para la alerta naranja en Mallorca Así, ante la posibilidad de que se produzcan inundaciones como consecuencia de las intensas lluvias y dado que este viernes se celebra la festividad de Tost Sants, se han consensuado estas recomendaciones: - Planificar las visitas a los cementerios en función de las condiciones meteorológicas y extremar las precauciones, prestando especial atención a las personas más vulnerables. - En el hogar, asegurar puertas y ventanas y quedarse en las zonas altas de la casa. Se aconseja también retirar del exterior todo lo que pueda ser arrastrado por el agua y trasladar medicamentos, documentos y elementos de valor, así como comida y agua potable a los lugares altos de la casa. - Se recomienda evitar los sótanos o zonas bajas, como garajes, y desconectar el interruptor general de electricidad en el caso de que el agua ya haya entrado en la casa. - En el exterior, aconsejan alejarse de torrentes y zonas inundables y, en zona urbana, buscar refugio en un edificio. No se aconseja caminar por zonas con agua en movimiento, ya que, cuanto más rápido corre el agua, más peligro hay. - Hay que evitar los desplazamientos en coche y, si es necesario circular, se debe moderar la velocidad y aumentar la distancia de seguridad. Se tiene que hacer por autopistas, autovías y carreteras principales. En caso de baja visibilidad, se debe detener el vehículo y señalizar su posición. - No se debe entrar en zonas inundables, aunque parezca que hay poca agua, ya que, con poca altura de agua, los coches flotan y son arrastrados fácilmente. Si el coche comienza a flotar y es arrastrado, hay que salir del vehículo de forma inmediata y, si no se puede por la puerta, se debe hacer por la ventana. En estos casos es recomendable abandonar el vehículo y dirigirse a zonas más altas en caso de que el coche quede inmovilizado por el agua o que el nivel de agua ya llegue al eje. - Aconsejan también llevar el móvil cargado y suficiente combustible en el vehículo y no aparcar en puentes, aceras o desembocaduras. En caso de emergencia, hay que llamar al 112.
