    "text": "La pandemia in Sardegna e la scia di vittime: la conta dei morti iniziò il 15 marzo 2020\nIl bilancio: in totale 2.947 decessi, oltre 500mila gli abitanti contagiati e poi guariti\nSassari Il 3 marzo 2020 il Covid arriva ufficialmente anche in Sardegna. Il primo caso accertato è solo l’inizio: in pochi giorni il virus si diffonde, colpisce le case di riposo e si insinua nei reparti ospedalieri. A Sassari, un focolaio scoppiato in Cardiologia fa schizzare i contagi. Il picco è inevitabile. Il 14 marzo, un sabato, la Sardegna si sveglia blindata. Il governo ha finalmente accolto la richiesta del presidente Solinas: chiusura totale di porti e aeroporti per arginare la diffusione del virus. L’isola è sigillata, si entra e si esce solo per motivi di lavoro, salute o rientro a casa. Nel giro di pochi giorni, il traffico passeggeri cala del 95%. La misura resterà in vigore fino al 18 maggio. Il giorno dopo, domenica 15 marzo, arriva la notizia che nessuno avrebbe voluto sentire: le prime due vittime. Carlo Tivinio, un imprenditore 42enne ricoverato a Cagliari, sposato e padre di un bambino, e un anziano di 81 anni, paziente di Cardiologia a Sassari. È l’inizio della lunga conta dei morti, che da quel momento verrà aggiornata quotidianamente nei bollettini ufficiali e diffusa dai sindaci attraverso i social. Il 18 marzo, l’Italia intera trattiene il fiato davanti alle immagini dei camion militari che portano via le bare da Bergamo. Nei cimiteri non c’è più posto, le salme vengono trasportate in altre province per la cremazione.\nIl 28 marzo è il giorno peggiore per la Sardegna. Il bollettino registra 80 contagi a Casa Serena, la casa di riposo comunale di Sassari. Pazienti e operatori sanitari vengono travolti dall’epidemia. In 24 ore, i nuovi positivi salgono a 94, il dato più alto mai registrato sull’isola. I malati Covid sono 530, di cui 336 solo nel Sassarese. Poi, lentamente, la curva comincia a scendere. Il 12 aprile, domenica di Pasqua, per la prima volta dopo settimane non si registrano nuove vittime. Il 14 maggio è una data simbolica: per la prima volta il bollettino segna doppio zero, nessun nuovo contagio, nessun decesso. Ma il peggio deve ancora arrivare. Il 2021 sarà l’anno più duro per la Sardegna. Dopo aver superato senza traumi la prima fase, l’isola si lascia andare a un’estate di riaperture e turismo sfrenato. Una scelta che si rivela disastrosa. A fine agosto i contagi esplodono, le vittime aumentano, le restrizioni tornano pesantissime. Il bilancio della pandemia è devastante: dal marzo 2020, la Sardegna ha perso 2.947 persone. Oltre 500mila abitanti, un terzo della popolazione, hanno contratto il virus e sono guariti. Il 2022 segna l’inizio del ritorno alla normalità, anche se tra mille limitazioni, soprattutto nelle scuole. Nel 2023 il Covid si fa più silenzioso, meno aggressivo. Oggi è ancora qui, più simile a un’influenza che a quel mostro che, per anni, ha riscritto le nostre vite. (lu.so.)",

    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II Saleen Martin USA TODAY During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle.\nThe Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\"\nTwo of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France.\nHis Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back.\nAva Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings.\nOn Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war.\n‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales.\n“It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.”\nCoogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums.\n“The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.”\nLt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled.\n“I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said.\nShe noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out.\nOnce they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away.\nAlthough there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called.\n“I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.”\nA car wreck took her 3 kids. Now through surrogacy, she is a mom again to a baby boy. A Georgia family was about to lose insurance for teen's cancer battle. Then they got help. Pedaling kindness: Massachusetts Peloton group leaves servers $7,200 tip 'Feed somebody you don’t know': Philadelphia man inspires, heals through food Why strangers raised $450,000 to help a dependable Burger King worker buy his first home Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York.\nLt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, online records show.\nFay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life.\n“He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said.\nOnce Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost.\n“He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.”\nIt ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said.\n“That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",

    "title": "AI PCs make users less productive due to learning curve • The Register",
    "text": "Those using personal computers with built-in AI services are less productive than those using traditional PCs, according to a study conducted by Intel.\nThe chipmaker, which is quite keen to see people buy the AI PCs sold by its hardware partners, came to this conclusion following a commissioned survey [PDF] of 6,000 people in Germany, France, and the United Kingdom.\nThe survey found that people lose on average 15 hours a week on what the firm pejoratively characterizes as \"digital chores.\"\nSome of these mundane tasks – a set of activities that conveniently falls within the alleged ambit of chatbots, such as writing emails, transcribing meetings, managing files, and so on – can be delegated to generative AI, Chipzilla argues, thereby saving perhaps four of those 15 squandered hours per week.\nIntel cites a website that references an unspecified Anthropic study as the source of the four-hour per week savings figure for AI. There is academic research , however, that supports claims about AI assistance and productivity for certain tasks.\nQuantitative details aside, achieving the purported time savings looks like it will take further work. The study \"highlighted that current AI PC owners spend longer on tasks than their counterparts using traditional PCs,\" according to Intel .\nAs the study itself explains: \"Many AI users spend a long time identifying how best to communicate with AI tools to get the desired answers or response. Organizations providing AI-assisted products must offer greater education in order to truly showcase the potential of 'everyday AI'.\"\nDARPA-backed voting system for soldiers abroad savaged Kyndryl insiders say there's little new business AI hiring bias? Men with Anglo-Saxon names score lower in tech interviews Google's AI bug hunters sniff out two dozen-plus code gremlins that humans missed The Register asked Intel to quantify the task time toll incurred by an inexperienced AI PC user compared to work done on a traditional PC. We've not heard back.\nRobert Hallock, Intel vice president and general manager of client AI and technical marketing, argues that the challenge for AI PC makers is reeducating knowledge workers, so AI tech is a help rather than a hindrance. \"Our role as technology leaders is to support this transition to AI-assisted living and equip consumers with the knowledge they need to use an AI PC efficiently and ethically,\" he said in a statement.\nIntel and its partners clearly have a lot of promotional work to do to convince the public that they can benefit from AI PCs. According to the study, 86 percent of consumers have never heard of or used an AI PC.\nLack of familiarity with AI PCs leads to what the study describes as \"misconceptions,\" which include the following: 44 percent of respondents believe AI PCs are a gimmick or futuristic; 53 percent believe AI PCs are only for creative or technical professionals; 86 percent are concerned about the privacy and security of their data when using an AI PC; and 17 percent believe AI PCs are not secure or regulated.\nGetting the word out about the wonders of AI appears to have some impact on AI PC appeal. Just 32 percent of respondents unfamiliar with AI PCs said they'd consider purchasing one for their next upgrade, whereas among those who have already used an AI PC, that figure rises to 64 percent.\nSo far, however, AI PC evangelism among those making the devices isn't having much impact on PC sales . ®\nGet our Tech Resources",

    "text": "Darfur\nRSF shell civilians in Omdurman, El Fasher, denounce bloody army airstrikes\nAugust 22, 2024 (EL FASHER/OMDURMAN) – Heavy artillery shelling by Sudan’s Rapid on Thursday killed and wounded civilians in El Fasher, capital of North Darfur, and Omdurman, the twin city of the capital Khartoum.\nThe RSF further accused the army of conducting 27 airstrikes over the past week that killed more than 280 civilians, a claim Sudan Tribune could not independently verify. Also, the army could not immediately be reached for comment.\nA medical source told Sudan Tribune that at least two people were killed and about 15 others were injured in RSF shelling that targeted residential areas in Omdurman. The shelling also hit villages in the northern countryside of Omdurman.\nIn El Fasher, the RSF intensified its shelling, targeting residential neighbourhoods, the airport and an army base. The state capital has been under siege by the RSF since April 2024 and has seen heavy fighting in recent months.\nRSF spokesperson Al-Fatih Qarshi said in a statement that the army’s airstrikes had caused widespread damage to civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, schools and markets. He said the strikes continued even as peace talks were underway in Geneva.\nThe army has not yet commented on the RSF’s claims.\nThe conflict in Sudan has caused a major humanitarian crisis, with millions of people in need of food, water and medical care. Aid agencies have struggled to reach many areas of the country due to the fighting.",

All parties must have full confidence and give space to the special committee to carry out its role professionally and effectively,” he said in a statement today.\nHe said the findings of the study, as well as views, and suggestions proposed by the special committee, will be presented to MKI and the Conference of Rulers.\nThe special committee, which convened its first meeting on Dec 5, was chaired by former Chief Justice Tun Zaki Tun Azmi.\nMohd Na'im said that all appointed members of the special committee have expertise in the Federal Constitution, and civil and Syariah laws, qualifying them to conduct studies, provide opinions, and make recommendations.\n“This is to ensure that the best and harmonious solutions can be made to resolve all issues arising in this matter to elevate and empower Syariah laws and judiciary system in the country,” he added.\n-- BERNAMA\nBERNAMA provides up-to-date authentic and comprehensive news and information which are disseminated via BERNAMA Wires; www.bernama.com; BERNAMA TV on Astro 502, unifi TV 631 and MYTV 121 IFLIX channels and BERNAMA Radio on FM93.9 (Klang Valley), FM107.5 (Johor), FM107.9 (Kota Kinabalu) and FM100.9 (Kuching) frequencies.\nFollow us on social media :\nFacebook : @bernamaofficial, @bernamatv, @bernamaradio\nTwitter : @bernama.com, @BernamaTV, @bernamaradio\nInstagram : @bernamaofficial, @bernamatvofficial, @bernamaradioofficial\nTikTok : @bernamaofficial",

    "text": "SAN DIEGO — A San Diego County inmate was sentenced to nearly three years for bribing a corrections officer to smuggle a gold and diamond grill into prison. Shawn Brown, a [Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility](/article/news/local/donovan-state-prison-operating-on-generators/509-598cf02c-6aa4-474f-8dfb-77aab73a81c2) inmate, received a 30-month sentence in federal court on Wednesday for bribing an officer to smuggle into prison dental molds and an expensive grill for his mouth. The state corrections officer who helped Brown, Benito Jamar Hugie, was sentenced to 24 months in prison in March and was ordered to surrender to federal officials on May 6. According to federal prosecutors, Hugie admitted that he smuggled a bejeweled grill into the prison in early 2020 and delivered it to Brown. The gold and diamond grill was ordered by Brown from a jeweler in Houston using a smuggled cellphone. According to Brown’s plea agreement, the overall value of the bribery scheme was more than $30,000. “Diamonds are not always your friend,” said U.S. Attorney Tara McGrath. “These schemes have cost Brown years of his life and Hugie his career and good name. Maybe regular teeth would have been a better option.” Federal prosecutors said during the hearing U.S. District Judge Cathy Ann Bencivengo ordered Brown to forfeit the bejeweled grill to the government. Brown refused and said the grill was glued to his teeth. “The government referred to a jail surveillance video that showed that the grill was, in fact, removeable,” federal prosecutors said.
