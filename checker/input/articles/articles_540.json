    "text": "New Delhi: A 149-member strong contingent of the Bombay Sappers will participate in the Republic Day Parade this year, returning to the Kartavya Path after two decades with a woman leading the all-men team on their march on January 26.\nRuchi Yadav, who is the leader of the contingent as a commander, said last time they participated was in 2004 \"and we are back after 20 years.\"\n\"It is a matter of great pride for me that I have the opportunity to lead my all-men team. I am the only female member of the contingent and this is also for the first time in the history of Bombay Sappers that a woman is leading their team in the Republic Day Parade,\" she told PTI .\nYadav said they are miners whose job is to lay mines for the enemy and remove them when required to ensure a safe passage for own soldiers.\n\"It is a golden opportunity for us to showcase our talent and prove our mettle here. I am leading a team of two commissioned officers and 146 members from different ranks,\" Yadav, whose native place is Bhopal but who is currently posted in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, said.\nYadav also said that the team practised for six months at their respective centres before coming to Delhi in early December to ace the march.\n\"When the entire nation is giving so much importance to women empowerment, I believe that the opportunity that I have got will inspire and motivate many other women in the country,\" Yadav added.\nADVERTISEMENT (Published 20 January 2024, 14:15 IST)",

    "title": "Space Debris Fall in Kenya: Experts Warn of Rising Risks and Future Threats",
    "text": "Kenya Space Agency officials inspect the fallen space debris in Mukuku village, Makueni County. On December 30, 2024, the serene village of Mukuku in Makueni County, Kenya, became the unlikely landing site for a massive piece of space debris. The event, which startled locals and drew global attention, has reignited discussions about the dangers of space exploration and the escalating issue of orbital waste.\nThe object, identified as a metallic separation ring weighing around 500 kilograms and spanning 2.5 meters in diameter, is thought to be a fragment from a rocket. Bram Nakholi, Director of the Kenya Space Society and a respected astronomer, provided insight into its origins. “What we’re dealing with here is what we call ‘space junk’ – debris thatS typically metallic in nature, originating from various space activities,” he explained. “These can be broken pieces of launch vehicles, defunct satellites, or components that have served their purpose and separated from active spacecraft.”\nResidents of Mukuku recounted hearing a thunderous crash as the debris struck the ground, causing widespread concern. The Ministry of Health swiftly issued a statement to calm public fears.Health Principal Secretary Mary Muthoni advised, “The Ministry strongly advises the public to avoid the area where the object was found and refrain from handling any unknown materials. Communities should report any health concerns or unusual environmental changes to local health authorities immediately.”\nNakholi clarified that while the debris presents physical dangers, it is indeed not radioactive. “Most space vehicles are constructed using carbon, stainless steel, titanium alloy, and aluminum alloy,” he noted. “These materials are chosen for their ability to withstand extreme temperatures and intense electromagnetic radiation from the sun. While they can be hazardous upon direct contact, they don’t carry radiation back to Earth like nuclear materials would.”\nThis incident highlights a growing global challenge: the surge in space debris. Recent estimates indicate that over 170 million pieces of debris larger than one millimeter are orbiting Earth. While smaller fragments often disintegrate upon reentry, larger objects, like the one in Makueni, can survive and threaten populated areas.\nNakholi warned that such occurrences may become more frequent. “We’re entering an era of unprecedented space activity,” he said.”Companies like SpaceX are aiming to launch multiple satellites daily, Blue Origin is preparing for their maiden rocket launch, and even Toyota has announced plans for space tourism. This increased activity inevitably means more debris.”\nOne of the most alarming possibilities is the Kessler syndrome, a theory predicting a chain reaction of collisions that could create a dense layer of debris encircling Earth. “This could potentially hinder future space exploration and pose risks to our satellite infrastructure,” Nakholi elaborated.\nTo address these risks, Nakholi advocates for heightened public awareness and government investment in advanced tracking systems. “Through the Kenya Space Society, we’re working to create a space-conscious community,” he said. “Understanding these risks is crucial for public safety. The government needs to invest in elegant tracking systems that can definitely help monitor and mitigate these threats.”\nSpace Debris Incident in mukuku Village: A Wake-Up Call for Global Safety On December 30,2024,the quiet village of Mukuku in Kenya became the center of global attention when a massive piece of space debris crashed into its outskirts. The object, identified as a metallic separation ring weighing approximately 500 kilograms and measuring 2.5 meters in diameter, is believed to be a component from a rocket launch vehicle. This incident has reignited discussions about the growing threat of space debris and its implications for global safety.\nWhat Exactly Happened in Mukuku? According to Dr. Bram Nakholi, Director of the Kenya Space Society and a renowned astronomer, the separation ring likely detached during a space mission and re-entered Earth’s atmosphere. “This event serves as a stark reminder of the increasing problem of space debris,” Dr.Nakholi stated.”While most debris burns up upon re-entry, larger objects like this one can survive and pose significant risks.”\nunderstanding Space Debris Space debris, often referred to as “space junk,” consists of defunct human-made objects orbiting Earth. these include discarded rocket stages, non-functional satellites, and fragments from collisions in space. As space exploration and satellite launches have surged over the decades,so has the volume of debris. Currently, tens of thousands of objects are being tracked, with millions more too small to monitor effectively.\n“The primary concern is the risk this debris poses to active satellites,the International Space Station,and future space missions,” Dr. Nakholi explained. “in rare cases, like the Mukuku incident, these objects can re-enter Earth’s atmosphere and reach the surface.”\nHow Dangerous Is Falling Space Debris? While the risk to human life is relatively low—given that most of Earth’s surface is uninhabited—larger objects can cause significant damage if they land in populated areas.”The separation ring that fell in Mukuku was substantial,” Dr. Nakholi noted. “Had it landed in a densely populated area, the consequences could have been catastrophic.” Fortunately,no injuries or fatalities were reported in this incident.\nThe Broader Implications The mukuku event underscores the urgent need for improved space debris tracking and urban safety planning. “Imagine if this object had landed in a city center or a crowded neighborhood,” Dr. Nakholi emphasized. “The outcome could have been devastating.”\nTo address these challenges, Dr. Nakholi advocates for a multi-faceted approach, including public education on space debris risks, investment in advanced tracking technologies, and the development of early warning systems. “Enhanced coordination between space agencies and emergency responders is crucial,” he said.\nKenya’s Role in the Global Conversation The Kenya Space Agency has commended the residents of Mukuku for their swift response and cooperation. “Space exploration offers immense benefits, but we must also prepare for its challenges,” Dr.Nakholi concluded. “As more nations and private entities venture into space,kenya must develop extensive strategies to protect its citizens from the potential fallout of these activities.”\nThis incident serves as a critical reminder of the need for global collaboration in addressing the growing issue of space debris. As humanity continues to explore the cosmos, ensuring the safety of those on Earth must remain a top priority.\nAddressing the growing Threat of Space Debris: Insights from Dr. Nakholi Space debris, a growing concern for global space agencies, has recently come under the spotlight following an incident in Mukuku.While no injuries were reported, the event underscores the urgent need for improved tracking and mitigation strategies to address this escalating issue.\nGlobal Efforts to Tackle Space Junk Dr. Nakholi, a leading expert in space sustainability, shared insights on the steps being taken to combat space debris. “There are ongoing efforts at both national and international levels,” she explained. Organizations such as NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the UN Office for Outer Space affairs are actively developing guidelines to reduce debris creation. For instance,newer satellites are now designed to deorbit and burn up upon mission completion.\nAdditionally, innovative technologies like robotic arms and nets are being explored to capture and deorbit larger debris. Though, Dr. Nakholi emphasized that these solutions are still in their infancy and require substantial investment and global collaboration to become viable.\nKenya’s Role in Space Sustainability Kenya is emerging as a key player in the global space sector. According to Dr. Nakholi, the country’s space agency is actively developing capabilities in satellite technology and space research. “Incidents like the one in Mukuku highlight the importance of being part of the global dialog on space sustainability,” she noted. Kenya is advocating for stronger international regulations and contributing to efforts aimed at ensuring space remains a safe and sustainable environment for future generations.\nA Message to the Public Dr. Nakholi urged the public to stay informed but not alarmed. “Space exploration has brought immense benefits to humanity,from satellite communications to weather forecasting,” she said. however, she also stressed the need to address the challenges it presents, such as space debris. “Governments, scientists, and the private sector must work together to find solutions,” she added.\nFor now, Dr. Nakholi advised caution. “If anyone encounters unknown materials, they should avoid handling them and report them to authorities promptly, as the Ministry of Health has advised.”\nConclusion The conversation with Dr. Nakholi sheds light on the critical issue of space debris and the collective efforts required to tackle it. as space exploration continues to advance,so too must our strategies for ensuring its sustainability. The incident in Mukuku serves as a stark reminder of the challenges ahead and the importance of global cooperation in addressing them.\nWhat steps can be taken to address the growing threat of space debris? Interview with Dr. Bram Nakholi: Addressing the Growing Threat of Space Debris\nBy Archyde News\nFollowing the recent space debris incident in Mukuku Village, Makueni County, Kenya, Archyde sat down with dr. Bram Nakholi, Director of the Kenya Space Society adn a leading astronomer, to discuss the implications of this event and the broader challenges posed by space debris.\narchyde: Dr.Nakholi, thank you for joining us. The Mukuku incident has captured global attention. Can you walk us through what exactly happened on December 30, 2024?\nDr. Nakholi: Thank you for having me. On that day, a large metallic separation ring, weighing approximately 500 kilograms and measuring 2.5 meters in diameter, re-entered Earth’s atmosphere and landed in Mukuku Village. This object is believed to be a component from a rocket launch vehicle, likely detached during a space mission. While most debris burns up upon re-entry, larger objects like this one can survive and pose critically important risks.\nArchyde: What exactly is space debris, and why is it becoming such a pressing issue?\ndr. Nakholi: Space debris, frequently enough referred to as “space junk,” consists of defunct human-made objects orbiting Earth. Thes include discarded rocket stages, non-functional satellites, and fragments from collisions in space. Over the decades, as space exploration and satellite launches have surged, so has the volume of debris. Currently,tens of thousands of objects are being tracked,with millions more too small to monitor effectively.The primary concern is the risk this debris poses to active satellites, the international Space Station, and future space missions. in rare cases, like the Mukuku incident, these objects can re-enter Earth’s atmosphere and reach the surface.\nArchyde: How perilous is falling space debris, and what are the risks to human life?\nDr. nakholi: The risk to human life is relatively low, given that most of Earth’s surface is uninhabited.Though, larger objects can cause significant damage if they land in populated areas. The separation ring that fell in Mukuku was substantial. Had it landed in a densely populated area, the consequences could have been catastrophic. Fortunately, no injuries or fatalities were reported in this incident.\nArchyde: This incident has reignited discussions about the Kessler syndrome. Can you explain what this is and why it’s concerning?\nDr. Nakholi: The Kessler syndrome is a theoretical scenario where the density of objects in low Earth orbit becomes so high that collisions between objects could create a cascade of debris. This chain reaction could generate a dense layer of debris encircling Earth, making space exploration and satellite operations extremely hazardous. It’s a sobering reminder of the need for responsible space activity and debris mitigation strategies.\nArchyde: What steps can be taken to address the growing threat of space debris?\nDr. Nakholi: A multi-faceted approach is essential. First, we need enhanced public education on the risks of space debris. Second,governments and space agencies must invest in advanced tracking technologies to monitor debris more effectively. Third,we need to develop early warning systems to alert populations in the event of potential debris re-entry. international collaboration is crucial. Space debris is a global problem that requires a coordinated response.\nArchyde: What role can Kenya play in this global conversation?\nDr. Nakholi: Kenya is emerging as a key player in space exploration, and this incident underscores the importance of our involvement in global discussions on space safety. The Kenya Space Agency has already taken commendable steps, such as inspecting the debris in Mukuku and working to educate the public. Moving forward, we must develop extensive strategies to protect our citizens and contribute to international efforts to mitigate space debris.",

    "title": "Self Esteem empowers itself in the gospel of 'Focus is Power'",
    "text": "Self Esteem have set a date for their next album, ‘A Complicated Woman’, which will be available to listen to from April 25 through Universal. ‘A Complicated Woman’ will be the successor to the notable ‘Prioritise Pleasure’ (2021), which earned a Mercury Prize nomination.\nThat the new album by Self Esteem – whose real name is Rebecca Lucy Taylor – will once again adopt a feminist – and therefore political – perspective is evident by observing its title and, especially, its cover, evidently inspired by the series ‘The Tale of the maid’.\n‘Focus is Power’, the first preview of ‘A Complicated Woman’, is built on the motto “I deserve to be here” and narrates a process of empowerment. It is an ode that is very much an anthem and, above all, a gospel, since the song grows thanks to the inclusion of a female choir.\nIn his “transformation”, Self Esteem unlearns the role of submission imposed in his childhood (“I will no longer give you what you want, even if I don’t want to”) and takes the reins of his life: “The world is yours, what are you going to do?” what to do with it? », he sings.\nThe Self Esteem album will feature guest artists Sue Tompkins, Moonchild Sanelly and the highly recommended Nadine Shah.",
