Le Conseil d’État a confirmé jeudi l’expulsion d’un imam de Toulouse prononcée en avril pour des propos haineux envers les juifs, selon une décision consultée par l’AFP. Le Conseil est allé dans le sens de la justice administrative, qui avait rejeté le recours en urgence déposé par Mohamed Tataïat. Cet imam de la Grande mosquée de Toulouse avait été condamné en 2022 à quatre mois d’emprisonnement avec sursis pour avoir tenu lesdits propos lors d’un prêche. Mohamed Tataïat avait été arrêté à son domicile le 19 avril, sur autorisation du juge des libertés et de la détention, [puis expulsé](/faits-divers-justice/2024/04/20/expulsion-vers-l-algerie-d-un-imam-condamne-pour-provocation-a-la-haine). Ses avocats avaient alors déposé un recours devant le juge des référés, dénonçant une expulsion expéditive et ne tenant pas compte de son comportement exemplaire depuis le prêche décrié, prononcé en 2017. Ce recours a toutefois été rejeté par le tribunal administratif de Paris, décision confirmée jeudi par le Conseil d’État. Vers un nouveau recours Arrivé en France en 1985, Mohamed Tataïat avait rejoint Toulouse deux ans plus tard pour exercer à la mosquée du quartier Empalot. Le ministre de l’Intérieur [Gérald Darmanin](/p/gerald-darmanin), qui avait signé l’arrêté d’expulsion, a pris note de la décision du Conseil d’État sur X (ex-Twitter), en se félicitant de la « fermeté » et de l’« efficacité de la loi immigration ». Vincent Brengarth, l’avocat de Mohamed Tataïat, a annoncé son intention de déposer un nouveau recours, sur le fond cette fois, et assuré que son client avait « poursuivi sans le moindre incident ses prêches depuis 2017 » et « qu’aucune menace à l’ordre public n’(avait) été démontrée par l’administration ». Dans son ordonnance fin avril, le tribunal estimait que les propos de Mohamed Tataïat « constituent une provocation explicite et délibérée à la discrimination, à la haine et à la violence contre un groupe de personnes - en l’espèce, les Juifs -, et revêtent une résonance et une gravité particulière depuis l’attaque du 7 octobre 2023 menée par le Hamas à l’encontre d’Israël ».",

    "title": "Former Trump adviser Peter Navarro sentenced to 4 months in jail for defying congressional subpoena | National Politics | news8000.com",
    "text": "Washington (CNN) — Peter Navarro was sentenced Thursday to four months in jail for contempt of Congress after defying a subpoena related to the congressional investigation into the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack. Navarro was convicted on two counts of contempt of Congress in September for not complying with a subpoena from the House select committee that investigated the attack. The judge overseeing Navarro’s case said Thursday that the former Trump adviser’s sentence is of his “own making” as he tore into Navarro for claiming that his prosecution was politically motivated. “I guess what bothers me ultimately is that here we are after a year and a half plus and you still want to suggest to me that this is a political prosecution. You want me to believe this is a political prosecution,” US District Judge Amit Mehta said during the sentencing hearing, raising his voice. “When the evidence is completely to the contrary.” “You are not a victim. You are not the object of a political prosecution,” the judge said. “These are the circumstances of your own making.” Mehta also fined Navarro $9,500. Navarro quickly appealed the case on Thursday to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. His attorneys have long said they plan to file an appeal to raise issues related to his claim that he didn’t comply with the subpoena because Trump had invoked executive privilege. Each count carries a mandatory minimum sentence of one month in prison, but prosecutors had asked Mehta to sentence Navarro to six months for each count – running concurrently – and fine him $200,000. They told the judge last week that a sentence of one month apiece for the two counts “is insufficient to account for, punish, and deter the Defendant’s criminal offenses,” arguing that Navarro’s decision to not comply with the subpoenas was akin to the conduct of some of the people who participated in the riot. “The Defendant, like the rioters at the Capitol, put politics, not country, first, and stonewalled Congress’s investigation,” prosecutors wrote. “The Defendant chose allegiance to former President Donald Trump over the rule of law.” Navarro’s conviction and sentence represents another key victory for the now-disbanded House January 6 committee in its efforts to have the Justice Department criminally pursue individuals who refused to cooperate with its probe. Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon was convicted in 2022 on two contempt counts and later sentenced to four months in prison. Bannon’s case is currently on appeal. Navarro’s attorneys are seeking a sentence of no more than six months of probation for each count, and they asked Mehta last week to pause the sentence he imposes as they appeal the conviction. A speedy trial Navarro’s trial last September moved quickly, with it taking less than a day for the jury to hear all the evidence in the case. Prosecutors put just three witnesses on the stand, all former staff members of the House January 6 committee. The Justice Department used its testimony to make the case that the committee had good reason to subpoena Navarro and that he was informed repeatedly of its demands. Prosecutor Elizabeth Aloi told the jury in closing arguments that Navarro “had knowledge about a plan to delay the activities of Congress on January 6,” and that he was “more than happy” to air that knowledge in public remarks, but not to the House committee. Navarro’s attorneys did not put on any witnesses of their own, instead focusing on part of the contempt charge that required a showing that Navarro was willful and deliberate in his decision not to comply with the subpoena – meaning that his lack of compliance was not the result of an inadvertent mistake or accident. Navarro has insisted that he didn’t comply with the subpoena at the direction of Trump, who he claimed invoked executive privilege in the matter. But ahead of trial, Mehta concluded that Navarro had not carried his burden in proving that Trump had formally asserted a privilege or a testimonial immunity that would have allowed his former aide to not even appear to answer the committee’s questions. The former aide has said he plans to raise that issue and others on appeal. “The appeal of this case will definitely answer what is required of a former President to invoke executive privilege as to their senior advisors and no future advisor will be in the same position of not knowing that the President they served had not properly invoked the privilege,” his attorneys wrote in court papers. The federal appeals court in DC is currently considering Bannon’s bid to overturn his own contempt of Congress conviction. During oral arguments last year, some members of a three-judge panel handling the appeal appeared skeptical of arguments advanced by Bannon’s attorney that the trial court judge who oversaw Bannon’s criminal case erred when they declined to let him assert executive privilege as part of his defense, and that the ex-adviser was simply acting on the advice of his then-attorney when he didn’t comply with the subpoena.

Where are these people supposed to go?\nGuests:\nAndrea Henson, attorney and executive director at\nWhere Do We Go\nLeaJay Harper, former resident at the Wood Street encampment in Oakland\nSharon Rapport, California state policy director at\nthe Corporation for Supportive Housing\nResources:\nThe New York Times:\nClear Encampments?

    "text": "More shelter beds available for upcoming severe cold weather BATON ROUGE, La. (WAFB) - A Baton Rouge area homeless shelter is preparing to open more beds in anticipation of the extremely cold weather forecasted for next week. The Society of St. Vincent de Paul released the following news release about their plans: St. Vincent de Paul’s Bishop Ott Shelter Program has initiated its plan for the upcoming cold nights (39 degrees & below). We will expand bed capacity for men, women, children, and families experiencing homelessness during the cold days and nights to come. We provide day and night shelter services to men, women, and children, and annually, provide over 30,000 guest nights of shelter. As a community-leading homeless services provider, our shelter program operates four-night shelter programs (with a 200+ bed capacity) and an emergency overflow night shelter. We currently operate two emergency shelters for men, one for women and children, and one for families and children. We expect to fill all beds and will make room for emergency cases in our overflow shelter. Individuals in need of cold weather shelter can come by our main shelter complex at 1623 Convention Street, Baton Rouge, LA 70802 to apply for shelter. We will begin accepting people in need for cold weather beds between the hours of 1:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. this Friday, January 12th. We will continue accepting individuals in need of shelter throughout the weekend, and will also be open Monday and throughout the entire week to accommodate the needs of those seeking shelter and services. We encourage individuals in need to seek shelter as early as possible. They can also call (225) 383-7341 or (225) 383-7837 for more information. In addition to providing shelter, our programs offer services to help individuals break the cycle of homelessness and become self-sufficient. Our programs have a good record of helping the homeless obtain employment, affordable housing and other things necessary to become self-sufficient. Cold temperatures always put extra stress on the limited resources and volunteers of our small non-profit. Individuals interested in assisting the homeless can do so by supporting current shelter needs. We currently need: men, women and children’s pajamas and underwear; women’s sleeping gowns; rain gear (ponchos and umbrellas); reading glasses (all strengths); slippers; toiletry items such as deodorant, body wash, and lotion; twin size blankets; paper products (napkins, paper towels, toilet paper); disposable cups, plates, bowls, knives, forks, and spoons. These items can be dropped off on Monday at our main location at 1623 Convention Street. Call us at 383-7837 for more information. In addition, in these difficult economic times, financial contributions are needed more than ever and can be made to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul at P.O. Box 127, Baton Rouge, LA 70821-0127 or online at [www.svdpbr.org](http://www.svdpbr.org/). RELATED STORIES [Click here](mailto:typo@wafb.com) to report a typo. Copyright 2024 WAFB.
