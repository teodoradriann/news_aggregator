    "title": "Cristina Scuccia Dedicates Herself to Love After Io Canto Generation: Who are the lucky ones",
    "text": "Cristina Scuccia – spetteguless.it The singer and former religious woman recently ended her commitment to Io Canto Generation, and now, surprisingly, she can finally dedicate herself to love. Cristina Scuccia spilled the beans and did so on none other than social media, showing off her treasures. The parenthesis of Io Canto Generation, a program dedicated to young singing talents, has also been archived now Cristina Scuccia can finally dedicate herself to love without hiding anymore. A decidedly challenging year for her, who after giving up her grades, became a television personality in all respects, taking part in some of Canale 5’s best-known programs such as Verissimo and L’Isola dei Famosi. Born in Sicily in 1988, Cristina showed a great passion for singing from an early age, and in 2007, by a strange twist of fate, she played Sister Rosa, founder of the Ursulines of the Holy Family in the theater show The Courage to Love. Two years later she would begin her religious journey, spending the next two years of the novitiate in Brazil, before finally taking her vows in 2012, joining the Ursuline Sisters. The notoriety arrived in 2014, when she was selected by J-Ax at The Voice of Italy, finally managing to win the second edition of the transmission. She later took part in Dancing with the Stars in 2019 and then in Name that Tune and Guess my Age, before surprising everyone at the end of 2022, when she announced on Verissimo that she had given up her votes. Cristina Scuccia, after Io Canto Generation, now dedicates herself to love: who are the lucky ones In 2023 her name is among those of the participants in the new edition of the Island of the Famous hosted by Ilary Blasi, which sees her finish sixth. Today he mainly dedicates himself to his artistic career and she can count on a large following of fans, who were amazed to see her posing with her two “loves”. Made for her rather unusual. It is, however, a very pure type of love: Cristina in fact he posed for a [photo](https://www.world-today-news.com/tag/photo/) together with his two nephews, sons of his brother Silvioto which she is very attached. “There is no greater love than this” she in fact wrote under their image, and who can blame her? It is a relationship that goes beyond dynamics linked to passion or more “feelings”.adults“, and instead has to do with the affection and disinterested love that the little ones often show towards their parents and closest relatives. The shot sparked many views, and it’s easy to understand how many fans of the Sicilian artist were moved in seeing such a delightful picture. Now that her commitments with Io Canto Generation are behind her, Cristina can finally dedicate herself to her family and say goodbye to 2024 all together: who knows what else the new year will have in store for her? 2023-12-29 15:00:00 #nun #Cristina #Scuccia #love #spin",

    "title": "On Gardening: Superbells Coral Sun offers award-winning options",
    "text": "Superbells Coral Sun made its debut in 2020 and has been racking up awards from north to south. By that I mean Top Performer from Michigan State to Mississippi State, and you can add Perfect Score at University of Tennessee and Director’s Select at Penn State. Now that I have grown it for a few years, The Garden Guy can give it a \"Holy wow,\" too!\nLike most of the Superbells, it can reach 12 inches tall with a spread of 24 inches, though I can give it one exception to that rule. I planted one in the spring of 2022, and it was mega-big one year later. I am clueless as to how it made it a whole year other than its temperature tolerances staying within the threshold. I say that, but I love planting them in October if I can get them. They seem perfect for my Georgia zone 8 garden. I really believe growers and gardeners alike are missing a real opportunity.\nSuperbells Coral Sun has proven itself, as have most of the rest in the series, at having a natural attraction for bees, butterflies and hummingbirds. You have to admit there is nothing quite like seeing Spicebush swallowtails feeding on the Coral Sun blossoms.\nPeople are also reading…\nThough spring is around 50 days away, I am already sensing a little anxiety in the garden world centered around the orange-flowered Supertunia Persimmon. The flaming orange and yellow blossoms seem to have taken the garden world by storm. The anxiety, however, is centered on the ability to find them in the marketplace.\nWell, enter the Superbells Coral Sun calibrachoa. It looks for all the world to be the younger sister, if you will, to Supertunia Persimmon petunia. Petunias and calibrachoas are related, so to be a little more scientifically correct, they would not be sisters but cousins.\nFor the sake of this experiment, we were able to get a large bowl with great potting spoil planted with Supertunia Persimmon petunia, August Lavender heliotrope, Supertunia Vista Snowdrift petunia, Whirlwind Blue scaevola and the star of this column, the Superbells Coral Sun calibrachoa.\nThe colors and patterns of Supertunia Persimmon and Superbells Coral Sun seemed almost identical and were breathtakingly beautiful. As you would expect, the Supertunia Persimmon was larger in both stature and blooms. The Superbells Coral Sun, however, was no slouch in either attractiveness or the sheer number of blooms.\nSo, the point being is, either one will fit your desire for that dazzling show of color. As you probably already know, partnerships with blue seem to create those goosebump-type feelings and the desire to do something similar at your house. I’ve grown mine with Supertunia Mini Vista Indigo and in another combination with Superbena verbenas.\nAt the Young’s Plant Farm Annual Garden Tour in Auburn, Alabama, they featured Superbells Coral Sun calibrachoa in a raised bed with Superbells Double calibrachoas that seemed to have light blue flowers. The Coral Sun shocked with an almost uncountable number of flowers.\nThis raised bed soil had the best organic amendments, which is what you will need, too. Or plant in containers with a high-grade potting soil. You do this, feed with a water-soluble fertilizer every two to three weeks and water as needed; you'll have garnered the green-thumb award. Most of us in the South will also cut back by about a third sometime in August to set up for a great fall bloom.\nIf you are like everyone else and you want Supertunia Persimmon petunia, just remember that if you can't find it, try the award-winning Superbells Coral Sun calibrachoa. Your designs will be just as riveting.",

    "title": "MOST ACCURATE FORECAST: A couple more days of record heat but relief is coming soon!",
    "text": "PHOENIX — This record-shattering heat wave is almost over! Phoenix Sky Harbor hit its 19th straight day of record high temperatures yesterday after topping out at 104 degrees. The previous record high on this date was 103 degrees first set in 1950. It's likely that Phoenix temperatures will continue to tie or set records through Monday. The good news is, it looks like we could be back down into the 90s as early as Tuesday, then the 80s by the end of the week with even a chance for a stray shower back in the forecast on Friday. Phoenix marked its latest 110+ degree day ever on record on Monday, October 7th reaching 110 degrees at Sky Harbor. The city has now recorded 70 days with highs at or above 110 degrees this year — an all-time record! That shattered the previous record set just last year, which was 55 days. Phoenix will top out between 100 and 105 degrees through Monday. Despite temperatures trending down in the coming days, we will likely continue to set daily records each day as the record highs this time of year sit between 100 and 103 degrees each day. On average, our last triple-digit day is October 5th, but we've seen highs in the 100s as late as October 27th. That happened in 2016. At this point, it looks like Valley highs will stay in the triple digits through Monday before we finally dip down into the 90s, at least for a little while. Overnight temperatures will drop into the upper 70s across the Valley, but even that's warmer than normal for this time of year and new record-warm lows are still possible through the weekend. With La Niña building in the Pacific, it's likely that we'll continue to see warmer and drier-than-normal conditions through the fall and winter months. Our drought has been getting worse lately with the hot and dry monsoon season we just had. Phoenix only picked up 0.74 inches of rain this monsoon, which ties for the seventh driest monsoon on record. Our 30-year average (which is considered our normal amount of rain) is 2.43 inches. But, it's important to remember, that is a decrease from the previous 30-year average of 2.71 inches (from 1981-2010) as our Valley climate continues to get hotter and drier. With an overall average temperature of 98.3 degrees, Monsoon 2024 was also the hottest monsoon ever recorded in Phoenix. That breaks the previous record of 96.9 degrees which we just set last year.

    "text": "The Colorado Parks and Wildlife Department (CPW) announced that the infection typically appears as black nodules on the rabbit's head and can grow over time to take on a horned appearance. While the virus generally doesn't threaten the rabbits' lives, it can become dangerous if it grows large enough to prevent them from eating or drinking.\nOne witness described a rabbit she saw, saying it \"looked like it had black sticks growing out of its mouth,\" and noted that the growths had gotten bigger when the rabbit reappeared the following year after surviving the winter.\nThe virus can only be transmitted to rabbits, but domestic rabbits that live outdoors can also become infected. The disease is more severe in domestic rabbits and requires veterinary intervention. The CPW stated that there is no cure for the virus, but most infected rabbits recover over time. For this reason, they only recommend euthanasia for animals whose ability to eat is impaired.\nOfficials also warned against touching infected rabbits.",
