    "text": "Microsoft layoffs: 1,900 workers at Activision Blizzard and Xbox to be let go [Eric Lagatta](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/5803430002/eric-lagatta/) [Paul Davidson](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/2646662001/paul-davidson/) Microsoft will lay off 1,900 employees at Activision Blizzard and Xbox, the latest tech company to announce cuts so far in 2024. The layoffs represent about an 8% cut of its video gaming staff of 22,000 workers and come months after Microsoft [acquired Activision](/story/money/2023/10/13/microsoft-activision-blizzard-call-of-duty-acquisition-deal/71167139007/) in a blockbuster deal. The $69 billion transaction in October represented one of the largest tech deals in history as Microsoft took over the studios behind bestselling games like Call of Duty, Diablo and Overwatch for its Xbox console. The planned cuts are part of a larger “execution plan” that would reduce “areas of overlap,” Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer wrote in an internal memo, which was quoted in multiple news reports. \"We are grateful for all of the creativity, passion and dedication they have brought to our games, our players and our colleagues,\" Spencer is quoted as saying in the memo. \"We will provide our full support to those who are impacted during the transition.\" Microsoft confirmed news of the layoffs when reached Thursday by USA TODAY but declined to provide a copy of the memo. Layoffs: [Business Insider to lay off around 8% of employees in latest media job cuts](/story/money/2024/01/25/business-insider-layoffs/72351587007/) Blizzard executives announce resignations Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard was seen as [ a strategy to keep pace](/story/money/2024/01/16/microsoft-worth-more-than-apple/72239504007/) with Sony and Nintendo in a console race by adding more games to its multi-game subscription service and cloud gaming libraries. Microsoft’s Xbox gaming console, which ranks third in sales behind PlayStation and Nintendo, seeks to fold Activision titles into its Game Pass service, which isn't unlike Netflix but for video games. The Wall Street Journal [reported](https://www.wsj.com/tech/microsoft-layoffs-videogaming-staff-4cc124c7?page=1) that the planned cuts, which mostly target Activision Blizzard employees, reflect \"redundancies\" after the October acquisition of video game company. Spencer said in the cited memo that Microsoft would provide location-dependent severance to all laid-off employees. Alongside the layoffs, two Blizzard Entertainment executives are leaving the company, President Mike Ybarra and design chief Allen Adham, a Microsoft spokesman told multiple outlets. Ybarra confirmed the news himself of his immediate departure in a [post](https://twitter.com/Qwik/status/1750527310493868293) Thursday on social media platform X. \"Leading Blizzard through an incredible time and being part of the team, shaping it for the future ahead, was an absolute honor,\" Ybarra said in the post. Other tech layoffs in the news Several big-name companies have already announced 2024 job cuts, including [Amazon](/story/money/2024/01/10/twitch-layoffs-job-cuts/72174329007/), [eBay](/story/money/2024/01/24/ebay-layoffs-2024/72335627007/) and In the tech sector, at least, job cuts are fewer this year than last. Another layoff tracking site, [Layoffs.fyi](https://layoffs.fyi/), reports that [76 tech companies had announced 21,370 layoffs](https://layoffs.fyi/) through late January. By contrast, 277 firms had laid off 89,709 workers through January 2023. But some economists foresee more layoffs to come, amid talk of a [possible economic slowdown later in 2024](/story/money/2024/01/22/shrinking-profits-spark-layoffs/72283931007/).",

    "text": "[Health Team](/lifestyles/healthteam/)\nHospitals limit visitors as flu cases surpass COVID\nFor the first time since before the coronavirus pandemic began in 2020, more people in North Carolina hospitals are being treated for the flu than for COVID-19.Posted — Updated\nFor the first time since before the coronavirus pandemic began in 2020, more people in North Carolina hospitals are being treated for the flu than for COVID-19. In the week that ended Dec. 23, 2023, there were 722 people in hospitals with the flu, an increase of 85% in just a week. There were 710 people hospitalized with COVID, an increase of 24% week-over-week.\na dozen children hospitalized with the flu.\nDuke Health Infectious Disease Specialist Dr. Cameron Wolfe said this flu season has “been fairly typical” in terms of who is getting infected.\n“It’s those extremes of age and people with underlying health issues. That’s been the same for many years with flu, and it was quite similar to what we saw with COVID, although young kids weren’t so badly affected there, but that’s already what we’re seeing here. They’re the people who really we should have been reaching out to for vaccine techniques over the past few months,” Wolfe said.\nInfluenza cases surpassed coronavirus and began to soar in mid-December, according to the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, and historical data shows that flu peaks in January and February.\nDr. Marwan Powers, an emergency medicine specialist and co-medical director at Cape Fear Valley Medical Center Emergency Department, said the system tested about 250 people who showed symptoms of respiratory illness in 24 hours.\n\"Half them returned positive for either COVID, flu or RSV. The bulk of those were positive for influenza,\" he said.\nmostly seeing Influenza A.\n“That’s the more aggressive type typically. That’s always the one that always occurs here a little bit earlier as well, so we’re certainly seeing that. We see it both in pediatric cases but we also see it in elderly and at-risk patients as well so it is certainly being felt,” Wolfe said.\nIn December, 21% of all emergency department visits in the past week were for respiratory illnesses. The rising numbers have prompted some hospitals to return to requiring masks and limiting visitation.\nMasks required at Cape Fear Valley Health\nAcross the state, hospitals in the southeastern counties reported the highest percentage of people going to emergency departments with flu-like illness; that rate was lowest in North Carolina's far western and northeastern counties.\n\"We are concerned,\" Powers said. \"When you're seeing volumes like this, it stresses the the entire system.\"\nEffective Dec. 28, masks are required for all patients and visitors in waiting rooms and other areas of the emergency departments of Cape Fear Valley Health, including Cape Fear Valley Medical Center in Fayeteville, Bladen County Hospital, Hoke Hospital, Central Harnett Hospital and Betsy Johnson Hospital.\nAll Cape Fear Valley Health locations, including outpatient clinics, are limiting visitors.\nIn pediatric emergency departments, one parent or guardian is permitted in the waiting room, and two parents or guardians are allowed once the child is placed in a room.\nPatients 65 and older or those who are cognitively impaired are allowed to have a visitor with them in the waiting room and triage areas.\nOnce a patient is assigned a room, adult patients will be allowed one visitor at a time.\nOther hospitals in the Triangle are taking similar precautions as respiratory illnesses are on the rise.\nWakeMed, UNC, Duke hospitals limit visitors\nBeginning Jan. 2, visitors in all WakeMed hospital patient care areas, including waiting rooms, must be at least 12 years old.\nSimilar restrictions go into place Jan. 2 for UNC Hospitals’ Chapel Hill, Hillsborough, and Youth Behavioral Health campuses. Visitors 11 and younger are prohibited from all inpatient areas and all waiting rooms. Masks are strongly recommended for staff and encouraged for patients and visitors.\nDuke University Health System is limiting visitors to two at a time per patient beginning Jan. 3, and children under 12 are not permitted to visit hospitals or wards without prior approval from health care providers and for special circumstances.\n“Each year we see patients, who – whether they realize their symptoms are severe enough yet to be influenza or not – bring that into the hospital. We saw the same thing with COVID. I think where the age restrictions come into it is anyone who has kids or grandkids will know, the younger the child frankly the less they are aware of their symptoms and the less they control where their hands, their secretions, and frankly where their snot goes. They’re just not very good at managing that themselves,” said Wolfe.\nVisitors to Duke hospitals are urged to wear masks and to perform hand washing frequently.\nThe hospital systems are all asking those with fever or respiratory illness symptoms – including cough or shortness of breath – to stay home unless seeking treatment by a doctor.\nRelated Topics\n• Credits\nCopyright 2023 by Capitol Broadcasting Company.

Incluso detallaron que La China se ocupó de los regalos. Sin embargo, el dato de color es cómo presentó a Icardi en medio de una salida familiar y de amigos.\nLA CHINA SUÁREZ PRESENTÓ A MAURO ICARDI EN UNA SALIDA FAMILIAR: CÓMO LO LLAMÓ\nSegún contó el periodista Robertito Funes Ugarte afirmó que hubo presentación oficial. “Me cuentan que ella llegó y le presentó a un integrante de su familia a Mauro Icardi. “Le dijo: ‘mi novio’ y él saludó a esta persona diciendo que era un gusto”, sostuvo.\n[Wanda Nara](https://www.eltrecetv.com.ar/socios-del-espectaculo/2024/12/17/wanda-nara-se-sorprendio-por-la-indirecta-que-le-dedico-juana-viale-nos-toca-a-todas/) dejó de lado cualquier atisbo de espíritu festivo y arremetió sin filtro contra Mauro Icardi y La China Suárez. “¿Para estas dos grandes mentirosas y malas personas no hay bozal?”, arrancó desde su cuenta de X, en respuesta al informe que estaba saliendo al aire en un ciclo televisivo, a propósito de las versiones de que le habría prohibido al delantero ver a sus hijas Isabella y Francesca. “¿Es sólo para algunos? Me extraña que madres hablen tan mal de una mujer con 5 hijos: ya mostré las pruebas de las veces que le escribimos”, siguió con su descargo, que luego eliminó.\n“Pero claro, estaba ocupado gastando casas de 50 mil dólares y la dama japonesa gastando el dinero que no paga él a sus hijas. Jamás existió impedimento, mantengo sola a mis hijos, trabajo y no jodo a nadie”, sentenció. “El señor estaba con la examante hasta el jueves en Nordelta, se fue con otro tipo a México y él se volvió loco denunciándome y escribiéndome estupideces a mí cuando yo misma llevé mis hijas”, profundizó.\nLeé también: [La China Suárez se tomó una foto que sería toda una provocación para Wanda Nara](https://www.eltrecetv.com.ar/mananisima/2024/12/17/la-china-suarez-se-tomo-una-foto-que-seria-toda-una-provocacion-para-wanda-nara/)\n“Está en rebeldía por la cuota y no pagar colegio.

    "text": "Trevor Lawrence received a sweet game-day message Sunday from wife Marissa ahead of the Jagaurs’ critical regular-season finale against the Titans. In a post shared on her Instagram Stories, Marissa — who has been married to the Jaguars quarterback since April 2021 — posted a photo of Lawrence, 24, from what appeared to be a tarmac. “Happy game day baby @tlawrence16,” she captioned the snap. Lawrence was activated for Sunday’s game in Tennessee after missing last week’s 26-0 win over Carolina due to a shoulder injury. The Jaguars, currently 9-7 in the AFC South, could clinch the division in back-to-back seasons with a win on Sunday. Should Jacksonville lose, though, they would miss the playoffs and the Texans would take the AFC South crown following a 23-19 win over the Colts on Saturday night. The Jaguars trailed the Titans in the fourth quarter, 28-20. This is Lawrence’s third season with the Jaguars, who selected the former Clemson product with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2021 NFL Draft. Through 15 games this season, Lawrence has thrown for 3,736 yards, 19 touchdowns and 12 interceptions. He helped lead Jacksonville to the postseason last year before they were eliminated by the eventual Super Bowl champion Chiefs in the divisional round. Marissa has continued to support Lawrence and the Jaguars every step of the way. Shortly after Jacksonville’s playoff ouster last January, Marissa penned a heartfelt tribute to the star quarterback. “As always I am so proud of you Trev. I’m honored to be by your side through it all!! What a year.. so much to be thankful for!” she exclaimed on Instagram.",

    "text": "Rapper [Wiz Khalifa](https://www.musictimes.com/articles/95885/20230908/wiz-khalifa-now-2023-age-bio-musician-recently-performed-country.htm) is facing serious consequences after smoking a joint onstage at the Beach, Please! festival in Costinesti, Romania. During his set at the popular music festival on July 13, the 37-year-old artist lit a joint in typical Khalifa fashion. However, Romanian laws strictly prohibit the recreational and medical use of marijuana. He was arrested following his performance, though eventually let go. He soon took to social media to apologize for the incident, saying he didn't mean any disrespect when he lit the joint on stage. \"Last night's show was amazing. I didn't mean any disrespect to the country of Romania by lighting up onstage,\" Khalifa wrote on X. \"They were very respectful and let me go. I'll be back soon. But without a big ass joint next time.\" However, he may not be out of the woods just yet. Prosecutors from the country's Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism (DIICOT) have finished the investigation and indicted the rapper under his real name— Cameron Jibril Thomaz. The rapper, who operates the cannabis brand Khalifa Kush, is being charged with possession of 18.53 grams of cannabis. \"Investigations revealed that during a performance at a music festival in the Costinești resort, Constanța County, he possessed more than 18 grams of cannabis (a risk drug) and consumed another quantity of cannabis on stage in the form of a hand-rolled cigarette,\" DICOT stated. Despite the charges, it's unclear whether Khalifa will actually go through trial or imprisonment, though he could face up to three years in prison. © 2024 MusicTimes.com All rights reserved.
