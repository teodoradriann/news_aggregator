    "text": "Public Sector Entities Innovate to Provide Quality ServiceBy: December 28, 2023 ,\nThe Full Story\nPublic sector entities have demonstrated “enormous improvement” in the use of various technologies to improve service delivery.\nSpeaking at a recent Jamaica Information Service (JIS) Think Tank, Principal Director of the Public Sector Modernisation Division (PSMD), Office of the Cabinet, Karlene McKenzie Spencer, said innovation is one of the features being promoted under the Service Excellence Programme, which aims to improve service delivery in the public and the satisfaction of customers.\n“We are seeing a lot of improvement in the use of technologies to bring services to the people,” she said.\nSince launching the Service Excellence Policy in July 2022, the Office of the Cabinet, through the PSMD, has strengthened its partnership with Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) to implement the Programme throughout the Public Sector.\nThe Office of the Cabinet is responsible for monitoring the implementation of the policy through the Service Excellence function within the PSMD.\nMrs. McKenzie Spencer said that the Programme seeks to ensure that all entities are able to deliver world-class service.\n“So, it’s not just one, two or three bright sparks you are seeing over the place. What we want to have is all delivering excellent service. We want to have less complaints,” she said.\n“We don’t want to hear complaints that: ‘I have been sitting here for 15 minutes and nobody talked to me yet. I had a bad experience with the person at the front desk and the security was rude. The security is doing customer service activity. There is no direction as to where I should go’. That is what we are trying to get rid of with the programme,” she added.\nMrs. McKenzie Spencer said that the PSMD is working to have customer satisfaction at 85 per cent, noting that a survey done before the Coronavirus (COVID) pandemic had a 62 per cent ranking of satisfaction with agencies.\n“After COVID, we are seeing improvement in how services can be accessed and there are changes in the business processes to allow for greater convenience and accessibility to service,” she pointed out.\nAdditionally, the Principal Director said that several entities are restructuring to create a more comfortable space for customers, where wait time is part of the business processes.\n“We also recognise that a lot of entities are improving the way in which they communicate with their customers,” she said.\nMrs. McKenzie Spencer cited the changes at the Auditor General’s Department and the Ministry of Justice’s website, which caters to the visually impaired and other persons with disabilities.\n“So, they are moving in various directions and utilising the various technologies,” she added.",

    "text": "With the Baltimore Orioles franchise in an upward swing, it seems the CEO John Angelos does not want to relinquish his control of the team despite it being his father’s wish upon his death.\nAfter five straight losing seasons, including three years with over 100 losses, the process has finally worked and the Baltimore Orioles are relevant again. They stunned the baseball world in 2022 by finally making the jump to being a competitive team once again. Then in 2023, they evolved into a full-fledged contender.\nRelated:\nRevisiting MLB Free-Agent Contract Disasters: What’s The Worst Signing Each Year For The Past Decade?\nHeading into 2024, Baltimore has a team built to be good for years to come and has the cap flexibility and assets to further improve the roster. All the work that the Angelos family put into bringing the franchise back to relevancy has finally paid off. And with their brand as strong as it has been in a long time it could be a perfect moment to sell.\nIt is something that has been rumored in MLB circles recently, and billionaire David Rubenstein is a potential buyer. Furthermore, a sale is reportedly something that owner Peter Angelos wants to happen after he passes away. That could come soon with the 94-year-old battling health issues in recent years.\nJohn Angelos does not want to sell the Baltimore Orioles\nHowever, it seems that his eldest son John — the organization’s chairman and CEO — has no interest in letting the franchise slip out of the family’s control. On Wednesday, the\nWall Street Journal reported that a battle over the future of the Baltimore Orioles could be brewing inside the Angelos family.\n“John Angelos has indicated privately that he intends to keep the club moving forward, potentially throwing the future of the franchise into turmoil,” the Wall Street Journal claims.\nRelated:\nNew York Yankees and Los Angeles Dodgers could soon engage in 2nd bidding war for a top free agent pitcher\nThe Orioles are currently valued at\n$1.7 billion. With the value of owning a sports team in North America on a heavy upward swing, that number could certainly increase if Baltimore has another strong season in 2024. It was recently reported that Carlyle Group Inc. co-founder and Baltimore native David Rubenstein is currently in talks to purchase the team.\nHowever, it’s believed that John Angelos has informed Maryland officials the franchise is not for sale.",

    "text": "In 2018, Henry Kissinger observed that Donald Trump was one of those historical characters who “appears from time to time to mark the end of an era and to force it to give up its old pretences”. The same could be said about last year’s October 7 attacks, the full impact of which we are only now beginning to comprehend. Before that act of appalling barbarism, the world was strangely optimistic about the future of the Middle East — despite the catastrophic scale of human suffering, millenarian fanaticism and economic collapse that was already evident across the region. The root of the hopefulness could be found in the Abraham Accords, that potentially transformative set of Trump initiatives, the aim of which was — somewhat euphemistically — to “normalise” relations between Israel and some of its Arab enemies. Last September, the great glittering prize of Middle East peace seemed to be in touching distance: Saudi rapprochement with Israel. The radical idea at the heart of Trump’s plan was that regional peace did not need to wait for “the Palestinian question” to be solved. Instead, that could be put to one side while other grand strategic moves played out. As Mohammed bin Salman “modernised” Saudi with his combination of political repression and social liberalisation, the two great anti-Iranian powers in the region could finally be brought together. A similar assessment was made about Lebanon, a country without a functioning state or economy and at the mercy of Iran’s colonial army, Hezbollah. This, also, was a situation that was thought to be containable — even as Iran exploited the anarchic chaos of Iraq and Syria to supply its proxy with enough weapons to devastate Israel. The central conceit of the Abraham Accords was that, irrespective of Hamas, Hezbollah and the occupation of the West Bank, once the Israel-Saudi axis was formed, Iran could be pushed back and contained without direct American involvement. But, then, the depth of Hamas’s murderous brutality on 7 October shattered that assumption, leaving not only a traumatised and vulnerable Israel, but also a traumatised and vulnerable Western order forced to confront the stark realities of the Middle East. Today, Lebanon is a dead state, eaten alive by Hezbollah’s parasitic power. The scale of the catastrophe in the country is hard to comprehend, much of it caused by the disruptive nature of Syria’s civil war. Since its neighbour’s descent into anarchic hell, some 1.5 million Syrians have sought refuge in Lebanon — a tiny country with a population of just 5 million. But, more fundamentally, with Hezbollah fighting to protect Bashar al Assad, the opposing countries — led by Saudi Arabia — began withdrawing funds from Lebanese banks. This sparked a financial crisis that left Lebanon with no money for fuel. By spring 2020, the country had defaulted on its debts, sending it into a downward spiral which the World Bank in 2021 described as among “the top 10, possibly top three, most severe crises globally since the mid-nineteenth century”. Lebanon’s GDP plummeted by around a third, with poverty doubling from 42% to 82% in two years. At the same time, the country’s capital, Beirut, was hit by an extraordinary explosion at its port, leaving more than 300,000 homeless. By 2023 the IMF described the situation as “very dangerous” and the US was warning that the collapse of the Lebanese state was “a real possibility”.",

    "title": "American Judith Weinstein Believed To Be Killed During Hamas Attack | HuffPost Latest News",
    "text": "An elderly American teacher originally thought to have been captured alive by Hamas in its Oct. 7 attack on Israel was actually killed by the terrorist group that day, her kibbutz said Thursday. The body of Judith Weinstein, a 70-year-old American-Canadian-Israeli citizen, is still being held in Gaza by Hamas, Kibbutz Nir Oz said in a statement, according to the BBC . It’s unclear how the kibbutz determined details about her death. Weinstein, who was initially believed to have been the oldest hostage taken by Hamas, “was a poet, entrepreneur, and pursued many initiatives to advance peace in the region,” the kibbutz said, adding that she was a mother of four and grandmother of seven who taught English to children with special needs. Weinstein’s family also released a statement. “We are heartbroken by the murder of our mother and grandmother Judy Weinstein Haggai, an American-Israeli-Canadian citizen. Judy was a mother of four, a grandmother of seven, and an active community member of Kibbutz Nir Oz,” the family said, according to The Hill . The kibbutz confirmed last week that Weinstein’s husband, 73-year-old American-Israeli Gad Haggai, was also among the Oct. 7 fatalities. President Joe Biden spoke out Thursday in honor of Weinstein’s memory. “Jill and I are devastated to learn that American Judith Weinstein is also believed to have been killed by Hamas on October 7,” he said in a statement . “This tragic development cuts deep, coming on the heels of last week’s news that Judith’s beloved husband, Gad Haggai, is believed to have been killed by Hamas.” Biden added that he’s been in touch with the couple’s children. “They have been living through hell for weeks,” he said. “No family should have to endure such an ordeal. And I reaffirm the pledge we have made to all the families of those still held hostage: we will not stop working to bring them home.” Kibbutz Nir Oz, which is near Israel’s border with Gaza, was among the hardest hit Israeli communities in the Oct. 7 attack, though exact death and kidnapping totals remain unclear. In total, Hamas has killed more than 1,000 Israelis. Of the 240 hostages it took, around 100 remain in the group’s custody. Israeli forces, meanwhile, have killed more than 20,000 Palestinians in an aggressive response to the attack funded in part by American tax dollars . Despite U.S. resistance, the United Nations passed a resolution aimed at increasing humanitarian aid for Gaza last week. Senior Reporter, HuffPost Do you have info to share with HuffPost reporters?

    "text": "TEGUCIGALPA, HONDURAS.- Calles cerradas por inundaciones y carros varados son el resultado ocasionado por las fuertes lluvias registradas durante la noche de este jueves en la capital de Honduras. En horas de la noche, el ingreso de frente frío vino acompañado de lluvias torrenciales, dejando a su paso varios estragados en diferentes puntos de la capital. En un video que circula en redes sociales, se logra ver un conductor empujando su vehículo varado debido a las inundaciones el bulevar Fuerzas Armadas a la altura de un centro comercial de Tegucigalpa. Asimismo, se reportaron varias zonas intransitables, entre ellas el bulevar La Hacienda, al oriente del Distrito Central, donde el agua llegó hasta el nivel completo de las llantas de los automóviles. El ingreso de este frente frio generó condiciones climáticas con abundante nubosidad variada, lluvias y chubascos moderados a fuertes, provocando estas incidencias. Continúan las lluvias en algunas zonas del país El pronosticador del [Comité Permanente de Contingencias (Copeco)](https://x.com/CopecoHonduras1/status/1740679049205424379?s=20), Walter Aguilar, indicó que se generarán condiciones de abundante nubosidad, lluvias y chubascos de moderados a fuertes. Estas lluvias estarán acompañados de actividad eléctrica en el norte, con un descenso gradual de las temperaturas, vientos racheados y fríos del norte y noroeste. Las zonas más afectadas serán en la zona norte del país, donde el agua superará los 100 a 150 (mm) de agua, especialmente en los departamentos de Cortes, Atlántida, Islas de la Bahía, Yoro, Colón y Gracias a Dios. Si las lluvias continúan en las próximas horas con posibles inundaciones y deslizamientos de tierra, estas podrían extenderse hasta fin de año y comienzo de Año Nuevo. Emiten alerta verde en algunos departamentos Tras el ingreso de frente frio al país, Copeco emitió una alerta verde en siete departamentos del país, a partir del medio día de este jueves con un período de 72 horas. Los departamentos declarados en alerta son: Islas de la Bahía, Santa Bárbara, Yoro, Atlántida, Cortés, Colón y Gracias a Dios. En ese sentido, ante las inundaciones urbanas que dejan la vaguada prefrontal y el frente frío en varias ciudades del país, Copeco pide a los conductores de vehículos no circular en sectores anegados por las lluvias para no exponerse a estos riesgos.

    "text": "name=\"articleBody\" itemprop=\"articleBody\"> As of: March 9, 2024, 9:24 a.m\nBy: Marcus Mäckler\nComments\nPress\nSplit\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg (r.) and his possible successor Mark Rutte.\n(Archive image) © Pool Sebastien Pirlet/dpa\nIn stormy times, NATO is looking for a new Secretary General - the big favorite is Mark Rutte.\nBut the “Trump whisperer” is not well received everywhere.\nMunich – Someone had to counteract all this gravity and that one was Mark Rutte.\n“We should stop whining, complaining and crying about Trump,” said the Dutchman with a calm that was rare at the Munich Security Conference.\nHe then said who would become US President was a matter for the Americans.\nYou have to work with everyone who ends up on the dance floor.\nTrump, it should be mentioned again, had previously threatened that, if he won the election, he would hand over to Russia's mercy all those NATO states that spend too little on defense.\nConcern and horror reigned in Munich, and Rutte's coolness stood out.\nIt was a message to everyone: Don't be afraid, I'll make even a bulldozer like Trump dance.\nMark Rutte as Stoltenberg's successor?\nDutch favorite as NATO chief\nThat was three weeks ago - but the Dutch Prime Minister has been considered the top candidate to succeed Jens Stoltenberg as NATO Secretary General for much longer.\nThe signs are becoming increasingly clear: a few days after the Siko, Washington, London and Berlin declared their support for the 57-year-old.\nIt's no coincidence that this happened at the same time.\nOne thing is clear: Rutte wants the job - even if it's not one of the most pleasant ones these days.\nThe NATO chief must not only remain steadfast against Putin, but also possibly defend the alliance against internal explosive forces after the US election in the fall, the time bomb Trump.\nThe Dutchman at least has the reputation of having that in his back.\nThis is mainly due to an episode from 2018. At that time, the NATO partners met in Brussels and experienced a US president who angrily threatened to withdraw from his country if the others did not increase their military spending.\nMerkel, Macron, everyone talked about Trump.\nIn the end it is said to have been Rutte who saved the situation.\nNot only did he assure the US Republican that spending had long since increased - he also flattered him by claiming that it was his doing.\nTrump later said: “I like this guy!”\nNATO is looking for a new Secretary General: Not every member is behind “Trump whisperer” Rutte\nSince then, the liberal-conservative has been nicknamed the “Trump Whisperer,” which is intended to be appreciative and sounds much nicer than the “Teflon Mark” common in the Netherlands, the man from whom everything bounces off.\nThe ability to deal with difficult characters is an asset when applying for a NATO post.\nAnother is the support of US President Joe Biden, who recently said that he considered the Dutchman to be a natural leader who would be good for the alliance.\nThat was the blessing from Washington.\nWithout him, no one will become head of NATO.\nMy news\nTo defend against Russia: NATO opens old Soviet air base in Albaniaread\nAt home in the forests: Swedes are building the NATOs' future flagship tank\nRussian governor wants to make Ukrainian prisoners of war “pay with their blood” read\n2 hours ago\nRussia satellite images reveal: Putin's weapons cache is bleeding out read\nUnmanned combat robot: Ukraine develops remote-controlled “Phantom-2” tank reading\n“Everything is allowed against the enemy”: Putin henchman Medvedev sends a clear message\nThe new one should be announced as early as April, but at the latest in July.\nHowever, it is not entirely certain whether that will actually be Rutte.\nBecause there needs to be unanimity among the 32 members - and especially in Eastern Europe, people are not completely happy with the election.\nHungary is once again out of line and has announced that it will not support Rutte.\nThere is also skepticism among the NATO partners who border Russia.\nUnbelievable: Estonia's head of government with allegations against Rutte\nEstonia's Prime Minister Kaja Kallas recently complained that a few countries were dividing up the top jobs in the EU and NATO.\nRutte would be the fourth NATO Secretary General from the Netherlands, she told Politico.\n“The question arises as to whether there are first and second class countries in NATO.” Kallas also recalled that in his 13 years as head of government, Rutte never achieved NATO's two percent target.\nThe fact that he is now one of the loudest when it comes to defense seems unbelievable to many.\nBut Kallas' words also express disappointed hope.\nThe Estonian would have liked to become NATO chief herself, but is considered hardly acceptable because of her clearly anti-Russian stance.\nAt some point, they say, we will have to talk to Moscow again.\nRutte, in turn, will have to convince Estonians, Latvians and others that he is not being too soft on the Kremlin.\nHe is still in office as acting Prime Minister because the formation of a new government is delayed after the new elections in The Hague.\nBut the fact that Stoltenberg will quit as NATO chief is considered a given, and Rutte is the man to be reckoned with.\nHowever, he is not without competition: Romania's President Klaus Iohannis has declared that he also wants to compete.\n(Marcus Mäckler)",

    "text": "By Abraham Achirga\nABUJA (Reuters) – Nigerian Catholic couple Jane and Lucy have little hope their local parish church will bless their same-sex union anytime soon, as conservative priests across Africa choose to ignore a landmark Vatican ruling allowing such blessings.\nConservative Catholics have condemned the Vatican’s declaration two weeks ago, which was approved by Pope Francis, that will allow blessings for same-sex couples, as long as they are not part of the regular Church rituals or liturgies.\nThe pope has hit back against the criticism and what he called inflexible ideological positions that hinder the Church from moving forward.\nBut in many African countries, such as the continent’s most populous one, Nigeria, even having a same-sex relationship is outlawed and often punishable by long jail terms.\nLittle wonder that 39-year-old Jane, who has been living with her partner for six years, does not feel the Vatican’s declaration will change much.\n“Maybe in the next 20 years (or) next 30 years but right now it will be difficult for them (Bishops) to just accept this,” Jane told Reuters inside her room in north central Benue state.\nIn the Anglican church, the issue has caused deep divisions for more than two decades, most recently following Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby’s proposal earlier this year to allow priests to bless same-sex unions, bringing the faith close to splitting point.\nThe Catholic Church has so far sought to avoid the impression of conflict.\nCatholic bishops from Angola, Kenya, Nigeria, Malawi to Sao Tome and Principe, Uganda and Zimbabwe are among clerics who have said they will not bless same-sex couples, but have argued that the Pope’s decree can be interpreted as optional.\nFather Patrick Alumunku of St Louis Catholic Church Mbora parish in the capital Abuja said the Vatican declaration was unsettling for many followers but should be viewed as a move towards inclusiveness for all God’s children.\nHe denied that this was an incremental step to eventually accept same-sex unions in the church.\n“There are laws that have been made by God and by the church in 2000 years which cannot change,” said Alumunku.\nFor activist and poultry farmer Jane, the fact that the issue is being discussed openly is reason enough to consider eventually approaching her priest for a blessing, if her partner agrees.\n“I think he (Pope Francis) tried to understand the feelings of people who tend to be born different or people who basically are now becoming like the outcasts of this society,” she said.\n“We are getting there, a moment of self expression and acceptance is coming.”\n(Reporting by Abraham Achirga; Writing by MacDonald Dzirutwe; Editing by Tim Cocks and Sharon Singleton)",
