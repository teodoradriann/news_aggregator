    "text": "By Stephen Caruso of Spotlight PA ,\n1 hour ago\nSpotlight PA is an independent, nonpartisan, and nonprofit newsroom producing investigative and public-service journalism that holds power to account and drives positive change in Pennsylvania. Sign up for our free newsletters .\nHarrisburg, Pa. — Pennsylvania’s multibillion-dollar surplus will soon be halved according to a projection by a state budget watchdog, the result of a long-running structural deficit combined with a growing list of obligations competing for public dollars.\nThe commonwealth’s recent $47.6 billion budget increased spending by 6%, with more than $1 billion in new money going to public schools in response to a court ruling that found Pennsylvania underfunds poor districts.\nHowever, the state brought in just $44 billion in net revenue last fiscal year. So to afford the spending plan, lawmakers are reaching into the state’s sizable cash reserves, which sat at roughly $13.6 billion as of June 30, according to the Independent Fiscal Office.\nThat total was roughly split between the state’s rainy day fund — the equivalent of a long-term savings account — and the state’s General Fund. The latter is essentially Pennsylvania’s checking account.\nLawmakers used $3.3 billion from the General Fund to balance the recent budget, according to the IFO. That money will be spent over the course of this fiscal year.\nPennsylvania will completely deplete the General Fund surplus by the next fiscal year, the IFO estimated based on expected spending, in-progress tax cuts, and revenue projections.\nThat will force lawmakers to tap into the rainy day fund to balance the budget due less than a year from now if they don’t find new revenue or cut spending.\nWhile fiscal good fortune built the current surplus, Pennsylvania’s policymakers have historically struggled to create new revenue sources as the state’s budget increases annually. This year, Gov. Josh Shapiro pitched regulating slot-like skill games and legalizing recreational marijuana to raise millions in needed dollars, but the divided General Assembly didn’t adopt either.\nThe rainy day fund currently contains more than $7 billion, up from just $22 million only a few years ago. This meets the level that experts say states should keep on hand. Pulling money out of that fund would require a level of bipartisan support that’s been elusive.\nThe IFO’s estimate assumes a 4% increase in state spending in the 2025-26 plan, much of which would pay for contractually required increases in state workers’ wages and benefits and federally mandated human services spending. It assumes education would get only a modest, 2.4% increase in line with inflation.\nNo one who helped draft the spending plan is saying much about what’ll happen next year to sustain the state’s spending.\nChristina Fonseca, spokesperson for state House Appropriations Committee Chair Jordan Harris (D., Philadelphia), said in an email that the IFO report made “certain assumptions to arrive at its conclusions regarding the status of both the Rainy Day and General Fund balances” that the caucus disagreed with.\nFonseca said the caucus supports a financial statement from the Governor’s Budget Office. However, she did not send the statement when asked and did not respond to follow-up questions about what assumptions the caucus disputed.\nMatt Knittell, executive director of the IFO, acknowledged the gap between his agency’s projections and the governor’s. Either way, the difference is a matter of degree and not of substance.\n“We both agree there is a substantial deficit,” Knittel said in an email.\nFor months, Democrats have downplayed the IFO’s recent projections by arguing that the state’s revenue has consistently grown. Speaking to lawmakers during a spring budget hearing, Budget Secretary Uri Monson said the state has averaged almost 4% annual revenue growth over the past 25 years.\n“We are very conservative on the projections of where we're going to be but the actual results have been growing surpluses,” Monson said.\nFurther spending is likely. Legislative Democrats wanted to appropriate $5.1 billion to underfunded school districts over several years in this budget but only secured $500 million.\nAddressing a brewing crisis in public transit funding is a top priority for Shapiro and Democrats this fall. Systems received a one-time boost of $80 million in the recent budget; Shapiro had called for $1.5 billion over the next five years.\nTo afford these priorities, they’ll need a lot of new cash — either from new taxes, a booming economy, or another source — or make cuts elsewhere in the budget.\nSpending down the surplus has short-term implications as well, said state Rep. Seth Grove (R, York), minority chair of the Appropriations Committee.\nThe state collects interest on its big surplus — by spending those dollars, that revenue will disappear. The state earned almost $780 million in interest from its cash reserves in the just-finished fiscal year, according to the Department of Revenue — nearly double projections.\nMeanwhile, if the general fund gets too low during the year, the state will have to borrow money to pay employees and run other key government functions. While the state isn’t currently in danger of running out of operating money, it has in the recent past. That came with consequences , including a downgraded credit rating.\nGrove noted that deficits are less manageable for states than they are for the federal government. “Unfortunately at the state level, we can’t print money,” Grove told reporters early this month.\nThe structural deficit — where annual costs exceed annual revenue — isn’t new.\nFor a decade-plus, Pennsylvania has consistently spent more than it brings in under Democratic and Republican leadership alike. Neither party has mustered the political will to find the right combination of spending cuts, tax increases, or growth-inducing policies to correct the issue.\nInstead, the commonwealth’s budget has raised one-time revenues by expanding gambling, taking on debt, or using budgetary tricks that shift costs around to balance the books each year.\nEven the current surplus — built on stimulus dollars and unexpectedly high tax revenues — hasn’t led to consistently smooth budgetary sailing, with three straight late budgets in a divided Harrisburg.\nState Senate Republicans are typically more open to increased spending than their GOP colleagues in the state House. That dynamic played out again this year, with the upper chamber passing the budget deal with more than two-thirds support. The plan fell a dozen votes shy of the mark in the lower chamber amid widespread GOP opposition.\nGrove, along with his fellow York County Republicans, called the spending plan “reckless” in a news release soon after it passed.\nBut fellow Republican and chief budget negotiator state Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman said the budget was a compromise — a product of the realities of divided government.\nPittman had a recommendation for unhappy state House Republicans: “I think they need to get a seat at the table by retaking the majority.”\nBEFORE YOU GO… If you learned something from this article, pay it forward and contribute to Spotlight PA at spotlightpa.org/donate.

    "text": "Rhinebeck Bancorp Enhances Financial Strategy for Growth\n[Olivia Taylor](https://investorshangout.com/profile/view?id=79141)Updated: 12-26-2024 05:09 PM\nRhinebeck Bancorp Repositions Assets for Future Earnings\nRhinebeck Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ: RBKB), a regional bank with a market capitalization of $103 million, is making headlines with its recent strategic moves. The bank has successfully completed the sale and reinvestment of part of its available-for-sale investment securities portfolio, an effort aimed at optimizing its balance sheet. These transactions included the sale of $71 million in securities in one month, followed closely by an additional $21 million sale.\nThe proceeds from these transactions were not left idle; instead, they were reinvested into new securities boasting yields 3.06% higher than those sold. This significant restructuring is anticipated to enhance the bank's earnings per share quite notably by $0.04 and increase its net interest margin by 0.04% starting the first quarter of the following year.\nLeadership Insights on Strategic Moves\nThe President and CEO of Rhinebeck Bank, Michael J. Quinn, shared insights into the strategic adjustments, stating, \"This restructuring is a proactive measure that will bolster our profitability moving forward, benefiting our company, shareholders, and customers alike.\" His comments underline the thoughtful approach the bank is taking during this transitional phase.\nDetails of the Reinvestment Strategy\nIn this strategic shift, Rhinebeck Bancorp decided to sell longer-term securities that yielded merely 1.37%, with a weighted average life of roughly 6.2 years. Reinvesting into newer options that offer a yield of 4.44% and a much shorter average life of 1.8 years signifies a decisive move towards improving the bank's financial health. This change is expected to not only enhance earnings but also to provide increased liquidity for growth in commercial loans, thus reducing dependency on wholesale funding sources.\nUnderstanding the Financial Landscape\nDespite facing a one-time pre-tax loss amounting to $4.1 million due to these transactions, Rhinebeck Bank continues to maintain a \"well capitalized\" standing with commendable liquidity positions. The bank currently holds over $35 million in cash and equivalents while also boasting an unused secured line of credit exceeding $250 million with the Federal Home Loan Bank.\nIn evaluating its overall financial condition, the bank has been characterized with a WEAK Financial Health Score, but it has also demonstrated impressive price momentum with a notable 19.25% return year-to-date. This mixed outlook fuels the importance of their strategic realignment.\nCorporate Dynamics and Future Direction\nRhinebeck Bancorp is not just focused on financial restructuring but also on refining its leadership structure. Recent changes have resulted in the non-renewal of contracts for notable executives, including CEO Michael J. Quinn and COO Jamie J. Bloom. Such leadership shifts are indicative of a broader strategy aimed at strengthening the bank's operations and adapting to market demands.\nKevin Nihill, who brings over two decades of banking experience, has been appointed the new Chief Financial Officer, taking over from Michael McDermott. Nihill's experience is expected to lead Rhinebeck Bancorp into a new era of growth and stability.\nThe Path Ahead for Rhinebeck Bancorp\nThe strategic overhaul implemented by Rhinebeck Bancorp emphasizes a commitment to growth and adaptability in a fluctuating financial landscape. Each decision, from asset management to leadership changes, reflects a broader strategy aimed at maximizing profitability and sustaining long-term operational success.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat is Rhinebeck Bancorp's recent financial strategy?\nRhinebeck Bancorp is repositioning its assets by selling lower-yielding securities and reinvesting in higher-yielding ones to enhance profitability.\nWho made statements regarding the strategic restructuring?\nThe statements were made by Michael J. Quinn, President and CEO of Rhinebeck Bank, emphasizing the positive impact of the restructuring.\nWhat are the expected outcomes of the recent asset sales?\nThe expected outcomes include an increase in earnings per share by $0.04 and a 0.04% rise in net interest margin in the following year.\nWho has been appointed as the new Chief Financial Officer?\nKevin Nihill, a banking veteran, has been appointed as the new Chief Financial Officer, succeeding Michael McDermott.\nHow does Rhinebeck Bancorp's financial health currently look?\nDespite recent losses, Rhinebeck Bancorp maintains a \"well capitalized\" status with strong liquidity metrics and is focusing on enhancing its financial conditions moving forward.\nAbout Investors Hangout\n[Investors Hangout](https://investorshangout.com/) is a leading online stock forum for financial discussion and learning, offering a wide range of free tools and resources.

    "text": "«Tevi DCA», Terapia virtual Inmersiva para personas con Daño Cerebral Adquirido. Este es el proyecto que está desarrollando el grupo de investigación de la Universidad de Viga, «Healthy fit», de la mano del centro que Cruz Roja tiene en Castro Ribeiras de Lea (Lugo) para ayudar a este tipo de personas en su evolución y mejora de sus capacidades físicas. Un estudio pionero en nuestro país que busca facilitar la vida, el día a día y en bienestar emocional de las personas afectadas por algún daño cerebral. Pablo Campo es fisioterapeuta e investigador del grupo vigués «Healthy fit». Después de observar los efectos positivos que la realidad virtual e inmersiva tenía en los tratamientos de enfermedades como el párkinson empezaron a pensar que por qué no usarla también en la rehabilitación de personas con DCA. Uno de los principales problemas con los que los expertos se encuentran a la hora de llevar a cabo sus respectivas terapias es la falta de adherencia a las mismas. «Que les guste o les entretenga y que sean constantes es complicado, pero si en estos procesos incluimos elementos novedosos como estas gafas de realidad inmersiva conseguimos que lo disfruten muchos más y que aumente esa adherencia», dice Campo. Estela Tejerina es la fisioterapeuta del centro de Cruz Roja en Lugo y asegura que estas primeras semanas están siendo muy positivas. «No es lo mismo ir al gimnasio, que aunque tengamos muchos elementos, piscina y máquinas en las que también lo pasan bien, estimularles mediante la gamificación, con juegos, es algo con lo que ellos responden mucho mejor». «Tevi DCA» es un estudio, pero pretende ser mucho más. Convertirse en una opción que los pacientes con daño cerebral puedan elegir, pero para eso «hay que testar desde el punto de vista clínico que es seguro y efectivo». Las sensaciones, tanto del grupo investigador como de las personas que trabajan día a día con los usuarios lucenses que la están experimentando son «estupendas», pero quieren ser cautos y esperar para dar un veredicto final. El estudio se divide en tres fases: la primera ya ha concluido con la valoración inicial de los participantes, la segunda se realizará cuando se cruce el ecuador del proyecto y la tercera coincidirá con el final de las 24 semanas que dura esta primera toma de contacto con el que podría ser un tratamiento efectivo en la rehabilitación de las personas DCA. Los entrenamientos también avanzan de forma progresiva. Las primeras sesiones en las que se combinan pedaletas con gafas de realidad inmersiva han comenzado siendo de 5 minutos. A medida que los usuarios vayan cogiendo fondo, el tiempo se incrementará hasta llegar al cuarto de hora. Rubén Rey es el terapeuta ocupacional de Cruz Roja. Acompaña a usuarios como Ángel o Josefa durante sus entrenamientos. De manera coordinada con el área de fisioterapia, es quién les coloca las gafas de realidad inmersiva con las que los pacientes se teletransportan a lugares como Paris, la Antártida o Nueva York sin moverse de la silla. Rey describe la sensación como algo inigualable para ellos. «Cuando se ponen la gafas se ven dentro de ciudades en las que nunca imaginaron estar. Las recorren en bicicleta y para avanzar dentro de ellas tienen que pedalear en la vida real, bien con las manos o con los pies, en función ya de cada uno de ellos.», describe. Además, dentro de estos programas también hay tiempo para la estimulación cognitiva. El terapeuta ocupacional incide en que «durante el tiempo de paseo van apareciendo por el camino imágenes, formas, en las que el programa les pide que se fijen y así a la vez que se mueven también se trabaja esa concentración». Patricia Carballal, directora de proyecto, asegura que esta es una experiencia maravillosa para todo el centro. Reconoce que desde hace una década ya trabajan con realidad virtual como un recurso más, «pero nunca tan inmersiva y realista como esta». Ahora toca esperar hasta que llegue el verano para poner un punto, y quien sabe si seguido, a una de las aventuras más apasionantes en las que se han embarcado.
