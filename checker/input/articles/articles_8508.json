    "text": "The Food and Drug Administration’s “hands-off approach” to food additives, including those found in ultraprocessed foods and energy drinks , may allow unsafe ingredients to enter the nation’s food supply, according to the authors of an editorial published Thursday.\nThe paper, in the American Journal of Public Health, comes as lawmakers and public health groups allege that the FDA has failed to take quick action to protect the public from certain additives — including brominated vegetable oil and red dye No. 3 — in food products.\nIn July, the FDA banned the use of brominated vegetable oil after studies had shown that it could be potentially harmful to the liver and heart, and may be linked to neurological problems. The ingredient had already been banned in the U.K., the European Union, India and Japan.\nThe agency has also come under scrutiny over its regulation of common ingredients such as caffeine after two people died after drinking Panera’s highly caffeinated “Charged Lemonade” drinks .\n“The FDA really needs to re-evaluate our system,” said Jennifer Pomeranz, associate professor of public health policy and management at the NYU School of Global Public Health and the lead author of the new editorial. “We cannot say that our food supply is safe.”\nPomeranz and her co-authors focused on the FDA’s designation of “ Generally Recognized as Safe ,” or GRAS, which is used by the agency to label ingredients that outside experts widely consider safe for use in foods. Ingredients deemed GRAS don’t need to undergo FDA approval before being used.\nThe rule was intended to simplify the use of common ingredients like salt and vinegar by avoiding a lengthy approval process while also freeing up the FDA’s limited resources.\nTheir review of the use of GRAS found, however, that over the years, food companies began using the rule as what Pomeranz called a “loophole” to add new substances — including natural sweeteners, preservatives and ingredients that enhance the texture of foods — that had not been fully vetted by the agency. Some companies have also used the rule to justify adding higher levels of caffeine to their products, she said.\nWhile food manufacturers can request an FDA review of new ingredients before they are added to products — and they sometimes do — they are not required to do so.\nFrom 1990 to 2010, an estimated 1,000 substances were labeled GRAS by manufacturers and were used without notifying the agency, Pomeranz said, citing earlier research. Since then, she added, there have likely been many more ingredients added to the nation’s food supply without the FDA’s oversight.\n“We have no idea how many substances are in the food supply based on this self-GRAS mechanism,” Pomeranz said. “The food industry has basically made their own decisions about what is GRAS.”\nThe FDA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nXaq Frohlich, an associate professor of history at Auburn University in Alabama who was not involved in the report, said that until a few years ago, the FDA’s attention to food issues had been “really minimal.”\nThat’s partly because a substantial portion of the FDA’s budget comes from fees that pharmaceutical companies pay to have it review drugs, he said, meaning that food regulation and oversight often gets “sidelined.”\nThe agency still actively works to prevent food contamination and issue recalls, he said, but activities such as monitoring additives and nutritional labeling is “a very small part of the agency’s day-to-day work.”\n“I think increasingly, more and more of its staff and budget has gone towards drugs,” Frohlich said.\nRichard Mattes, a distinguished professor of nutrition science at Purdue University in Indiana who consults for the food industry, said that there isn’t enough funding for agencies, like the FDA, to adequately monitor the safety and healthiness of food.\nHowever, he defended the FDA, saying that he believes the agency does “a thorough job of reviewing food ingredients.”\nHe said that whether a food is safe depends more on how people choose to consume processed foods with added ingredients.\n“If we were to moderate our consumption so that we stay within our energy needs and have a balanced diet so we don’t get too much or too little of any particular food constituent, we really wouldn’t have most of the problems that we have now,” Mattes said. “It’s not a matter of a given chemical.”\nPomeranz said she would ideally like to see the FDA get more funding and resources to allow it to review ingredients before they are allowed on the market. She thinks that is partly an area for Congress, adding that at the “very minimum” the FDA should be able to do some premarket review to determine if an ingredient should be labeled GRAS.\n“It’s really about safety,” she said. “Safety is something I think all parties can agree on.”\nThe post FDA’s ‘hands-off approach’ to additives may allow unsafe ingredients in food, experts suggest appeared first on NBC News .",

    "text": "National security officials are investigating a Zoom call made to Maryland U.S. Senator Ben Cardin , where someone used deepfake technology to impersonate a former top Ukrainian official. Authorities are still trying to determine who is responsible, with intelligence sources suspecting involvement from Russia, China, or Iran. Deepfakes, often used for fake celebrity endorsements or humorous videos, are no laughing matter in this case. WASHINGTON, DC - MAY 21: Chairman Sen. Ben Cardin (D-MD) speaks a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing where U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is testifying on Capitol Hill on May 21, 2024 in Washington, DC. Blinken is testifying before th Capitol Police confirmed the Zoom call was an attempt to impersonate a foreign official. Sen. Cardin and his staff became suspicious of the caller’s behavior and promptly ended the call. Sources revealed the deepfake was of Ukraine’s former Foreign Affairs Minister Dmytro Kuleba. Related Dr. Max Tegmark, an A.I. researcher at MIT, explained the ease with which such technology can be used. \"Just take a video, and the face of the other person, click, drag, and you’re done! It should be illegal to make those tools available. That’s when the problem is going to get solved,\" Tegmark said. The incident has raised alarms within Congress, prompting Senate security officials to issue a warning to staff to remain vigilant against deepfakes. Sen. Mark Warner, Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, expressed concern, telling FOX 5: \"This was an attempt to manipulate Senator Cardin into saying things that could be detrimental. Luckily, it was spotted, but foreign governments—particularly Russia, China, and Iran—will continue to try to meddle.\" Sen. Cardin released a statement, saying, \"I ended the call, and my office took swift action, alerting the relevant authorities.\" His office has declined further comment, citing the ongoing investigation.",

    "text": "EDMONTON — Alberta's electricity operator says it ended a grid alert after more wind and solar power on Monday helped ease strain on the system.\nBut the Alberta Electric Systems Operator says people should continue to conserve power into the evening, as extremely cold temperatures continued to pose problems.\n\"We've gone for a period of the last few days where we had almost no wind and we were on very short supply, and that created additional challenges and additional stress on the grid,\" said operator spokesperson Leif Sollid.\n\"Now we're starting to see more wind, which certainly does help us meet demand here across Alberta.\"\nThe operator issued four alerts since Friday, urging residents to conserve power during peak times and warning of the possibility of rotating blackouts if demand got too high.\nIt partially pinned the crisis on a handful of gas generators that weren't fully operating, as well as a lack of renewable energy being produced due to low winds and a shortage of daylight at this time of year.\nSollid said one natural gas generator was out on planned maintenance, while frigid temperatures caused several others to go off-line completely or partially.\nHe said he can't identity which plants had issues or speculate on when they might fully operate again.\nSollid said it was the first time the operator sent out emergency alerts over grid problems. And Albertans listened.\nMore than 200 megawatts in grid space became available when Albertans turned off lights or unplugged what they could, he said.\n\"Demand immediately dropped from the system and that was enough to allow us to avoid having to go on rotating outages,\" Sollid said.\n\"Had we not have been able to conserve that electricity, we would have been forced to implement rotating outages across the province.\"\nHe said Saskatchewan sent 153 megawatts of energy on Saturday, an above-normal amount. British Columbia also supplied about 400 megawatts, which is normal.\n\"The 150 megawatts (from Saskatchewan) was extraordinary. That was well above and beyond what we would ever expect to import,\" Sollid said.\nHe said he couldn't speculate how the grid would fare Monday night, as it's managed in real time.\nAbout 30 per cent of Alberta's grid comes from renewable sources, Sollid added.\nAlberta Premier Danielle Smith and Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe have criticized Ottawa's green-energy plans. After the alerts were issued, they said renewables can't be depended upon when temperatures drop.\nRandy Boissonnault, the only federal cabinet minister from Alberta and one of only two Liberal MPs from the province, called the statements from the premiers \"a petty, untrue and partisan attack.\"\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 15, 2024.\n— By Jeremy Simes in Regina\nThe Canadian Press\nNote to readers: This is a corrected story; An earlier version said there had been three grid alerts since Friday.",

    "text": "- By [Kashish Rai](/authors/kashish-rai) - Published: Fri, 29 Mar 2024 11:09 AM (IST) - Source:JND Saint Tulsidas wrote the epic Ramcharitmanas in the 16th century using the Awadhi language, adapting the ancient Ramayana narrative with the needs of the next generation in mind. The Valmiki Ramayana is neither exactly duplicated in the Ramcharitmanas, nor is it a shortened version of the latter. The Ramcharitmanas incorporates stories from Puranic tales, several Indian languages, and numerous other Sanskrit-language Ramayanas. Let us check out 7 interesting facts every Hindu must know about Ramcharitmanas further. 7 Interesting Facts About Ramcharitmanas That Every Hindu Must Know 1. 7 Kandas In Ramcharitmanas The composition was written in seven Kandas by Tulsidas. These are known as Uttar Kanda, Bala Kanda, Ayodhya Kanda, Aranya Kanda, Kishkindakand, Sundar Kanda, and Lanka Kanda. The primary distinction between the Ramacharitmanas and the Valmiki Ramayana is that Saint Tulsidas wrote the sixth chapter under the title Lanka Kanda rather than Yuddh Kanda. Another name for the epic poetry Ramcharitmanas is Tulsikrit Ramayana, or Tulsidas' Ramayana. (Image Source: Jagran English) 2. The Reality Of Ravana Explained By Tulsidas Ji Most people are aware that Ravana was the ruler of Lanka, but very few are aware that Kuver, Ravana's half-brother, was the real ruler of Lanka. Ramcharitmanas states that Kuver was a devotee of Shiva as well. After seeing his penance, Shiva bestowed upon him Lanka, which Ravana ultimately prevailed over Kuver in their battle. Ravana was a devoted follower of Lord Shiva as well. As a sign of his extreme penance, Ravana severed his head and offered it as a sacrifice to Shiva. Because of his devotion, Lord Shiva bestowed ten heads onto Ravana; this is how he came to be known as Dashanan, the one with ten heads. 3. Composition Of Shri Ramcharitmanas In the Ramcharitmanas, the word Ram appears 1443 times. In the Ramcharitmanas, the words Sita and Janaki occur 147 and 69 times, respectively. There are 51 instances of the term Baidehi and 35 instances of Temple. Comparably, Ramcharitmanas has 27 verses, 4608 Chaupais, and 1074 Dohas. The longest chapter in this epic is Balakanda, while the shortest is Kishkindhakand. 4. Difference Between Ramayana And Ramcharitmanas The narratives concerning Lord Rama are told in two distinct ways in the Sanskrit and Awadhi languages: the Ramcharitmanas and the Ramayana. Regarding composition, religious importance, and other aspects, there are some distinctions between them as well as variations in the type of poetry utilised. The holy Valmiki is the author of the Ramayana. It is regarded as the first book of elaborate poetry or Adi Kavya. The first work of Valmiki serves as the basis for Ramcharitamanas. 5. Lord Rama’s Sister The four brothers Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata, and Shatrughan had an elder sister called Shanta. King Dasharatha handed Shanta, the oldest daughter of Kaushalya and Dasharatha, to King Rompad of Angadesh when she was a little girl for an undisclosed cause. Shanta was raised by King Rompad and his childless wife Varshini, who had made a playful request for a child when visiting Ayodhya. As promised by King Dasharatha, Shanta became the princess of Angadesh. 6. The Vision Of Saint Tulsidas In several of his writings, Tulsidas states that he had direct glimpses, or darshan, of Lord Hanuman, Lord Rama-Lakshman, and Shiva-Parvati. Tulsidas discovered a saint in Kashi during his travels, and the monk gave him Hanuman's location. He was fortunate to encounter Lord Rama in a vision after meeting Hanuman. Tulsidas, however, was unable to identify Lord Rama when he bestowed darshan upon him. When Lord Rama paid Tulsidas another visit on the day of Mauni Amavasya, Hanuman assisted him in recognising Lord Rama.

Story Of Meghnath The Ramcharitmanas tell the story of Meghnad, the son of Mandodari and King Ravana. He was renowned for his extraordinary fighting prowess, and his name means \"one whose speech was like thunder.\" Meghnad was feared for his valour and was the most formidable fighter in Lanka's army. He even vanquished Indra, the ruler of the gods, and was given the moniker Indrajit. He was given a prophecy that the person who hadn't slept in 14 years would kill him. Lakshman Ji is also known as Gudakesh since he didn't sleep for fourteen years. Consequently, Lakshman Ji killed Meghnath.

    "text": "O Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia ( INMET ) emitiu um aviso de tempestade para diversas regiões do Centro-Oeste brasileiro. O alerta indica a possibilidade de chuvas intensas , com volumes variando entre 20 e 30 mm/h ou até 50 mm/dia. Além disso, ventos podem alcançar velocidades entre 40 e 60 km/h, acompanhados da possibilidade de queda de granizo. Estes fenômenos meteorológicos demandam atenção especial devido ao potencial para causar incidentes. Entre os impactos possíveis estão cortes de energia elétrica, danos em plantações e queda de galhos de árvores. O risco de alagamentos também não está descartado, o que exige precaução das autoridades locais e da população residente nas áreas afetadas. Quais cidades estão sob alerta de tempestade? O aviso abrange principalmente municípios dos estados de Mato Grosso do Sul e Mato Grosso. Algumas das cidades que devem ficar atentas ao alerta incluem: - Amambai, MS - Anastácio, MS - Antônio João, MS - Aquidauana, MS - Aral Moreira, MS - Barão de Melgaço, MT - Bela Vista, MS - Bodoquena, MS - Bonito, MS - Cáceres, MT - Caracol, MS - Coronel Sapucaia, MS - Corumbá, MS - Guia Lopes da Laguna, MS - Jardim, MS - Ladário, MS - Laguna Carapã, MS - Maracaju, MS - Miranda, MS - Nioaque, MS - Paranhos, MS - Poconé, MT - Ponta Porã, MS - Porto Murtinho, MS - Sete Quedas, MS - Tacuru, MS Como agir em alertas de tempestade? Em situações de alerta de tempestade, é fundamental tomar algumas medidas preventivas para minimizar riscos e garantir a segurança das pessoas. Primeiro, é aconselhável monitorar as atualizações dos órgãos de meteorologia para ter informações em tempo real. Se possível, evite sair de casa durante os períodos de maior intensidade das chuvas. Caso esteja dirigindo, diminua a velocidade e mantenha uma distância segura dos veículos à frente. Em relação às propriedades rurais, os produtores devem verificar e reforçar estufas, galpões e tendas para proteger culturas agrícolas que possam ser afetadas pelo vento forte e granizo. Como a população pode se preparar? É essencial que a população das áreas afetadas pelo alerta esteja preparada e informada sobre como agir. Confira algumas dicas práticas: - Evite áreas alagadas, pois a força da água pode ser mais intensa do que aparenta. - Retire equipamentos eletrônicos da tomada para prevenir danos causados por surtos de energia. - Guarde documentos e itens importantes em locais elevados e seguros contra a umidade. - Mantenha lanternas e pilhas à mão, prevendo quedas de energia. Essas precauções não apenas ajudam a proteger bens materiais, mas também são essenciais para manter a integridade física e emocional durante as tempestades. Siga a gente no Google Notícias",
