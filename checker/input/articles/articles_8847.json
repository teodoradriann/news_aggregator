    "text": "O SENHOR É BOM; BEM-AVENTURADO O HOMEM QUE NELE SE REFUGIA. – 01JUN24.\nTEXTO: Salmo 34:08.\n08 Provai, e vede que o senhor é bom; bem-aventurado o homem que nele se refugia.”\nNeste Salmo Davi nos exorta em confiar em Deus. O Deus de sempre está pronta para nos ajudar a resolver nossos problemas e melhor direcionar a nossa vida.\nProvai é um termo, na forma imperativa, que determina a todos nós, crentes em Jesus Cristo, buscar no Senhor Deus ajuda e refrigério todos os dias.\nQuais são as suas necessidades hoje? Enfermidades incuráveis pela medicina; dificuldades no casamento ou nos relacionamentos; dívidas impagáveis; desemprego; problemas físicos e espirituais etc etc etc.\nNão importa o tamanho do seu problema, pois Deus é suficientemente grande para superá-lo. Basta somente que você creia que Ele está pronto para resolvê-lo, necessitando que você se refugie n’Ele. Refugiar em Deus é ficar, literalmente, sobre as Suas asas, permanecer sob elas durante as tempestades do dia a dia. Problemas nós teremos sempre, mas a solução deles depende de nossas escolhas.\nSe você está achando que tudo isto é blá, blá, blá é porque você ainda não experimentou PROVAR e REFUGIAR-SE em Deus. Está faltando fé e, talvez, mais paciência em você, pois CONFIAR em Deus é ter certeza que Ele resolverá todos os seus problemas, no momento oportuno.\nO que você precisa fazer para receber tudo isto de Deus?\nBasta estar em comunhão com Ele, amando-O e reconhecendo que Seu filho, Jesus Cristo, é seu único Senhor e Salvador de sua vida. Que o Senhor Jesus já pagou o preço para que pudéssemos usufruir dessas bênçãos.\nLembre-se: “Esperei com paciência no Senhor, e ele se inclinou para mim, e ouviu o meu clamor.” Salmo 40:1.\nQue as bênçãos do Senhor permaneçam nos abençoando.\nPastor Davidson D Freitas, AUTOR.",

    "title": "Aurora arborist keeps city safe, clean from tree tops | Aurora | denvergazette.com",
    "text": "Ashley Fox can often be found high atop trees, swinging from branch to branch with a chainsaw attached to her hip, a big smile on her face and a shirt covered in bark and wood chips. Fox is a climbing arborist for the city of Aurora and spends her days keeping the city trees safe and beautiful for area residents. Prior to working for the city, Fox didn't know anything about tree climbing or tree work, she said. What she did have, however, was a degree in natural resources and an enthusiasm for all things outdoors. In her interview for the role — which at the time was an apprenticeship — Fox flew to Aurora to show the interviewers that she could climb 25 feet and go up in a bucket truck without issue. Now, she prides herself in providing tree work, which can be expensive and often inaccessible to people due to the cost, to Aurora residents to make the city's canopy safe and beautiful for everybody. \"Being able to have tree work be accessible for everybody in the city and not having one extra thing to worry about ... is definitely the best, most fulfilling part of the job,\" Fox said. Trees provide a multitude of important services to cities, she said, including shade that can create an 11 degree difference in temperature, habitats for wildlife, beautification of neighborhoods and oxygen. \"There are so many ecosystem services that trees provide,\" Fox said. Her team's rule of thumb is to prune dead branches, which they can check for by looking for green underneath the bark of a branch and buds or leaves during certain seasons, and to cut branches two inches or bigger around, she said. \"Our scope is called safety pruning, so we're making sure that anything that would hurt somebody if it were to fall, we get that out,\" Fox said. They also do clearance, which means cutting branches lower than 14 feet over the street, eight feet over sidewalks and six feet over yards. Structure pruning makes sure trees don't have structural defaults as they age. When storms roll through the area, her team also handles storm damage, she said, with somebody on call 24/7 to clear roadways, sidewalks and driveways of fallen branches. The team should have plenty of work after Thursday's snowstorm dumped several inches of heavy, wet snow on Aurora. Fox recalled a storm in May a few years ago when she was called in at 3 a.m. to clear a fallen tree on Chambers Road that was too big for plows to move. Fox is part of a small percentage of the arborist industry that is women. She encouraged more women to get involved in the work she does. In her time with the city, she's learned that women can do anything men can do, albeit sometimes women have to get more creative, she said. \"I've got this awesome hook that I can hook onto logs and I can use mechanical advantage for moving things around that maybe someone who's bigger than me can Hulk around,\" Fox said. \"I've learned different unique ways that help me climb better ... I think women would have a lot of fun climbing trees with us.\" On one occasion, Fox recalled getting down from the tree and meeting a curious city resident, who asked in surprise if she was a girl. In addition to being a woman in a male-dominated space, Fox's strengths as an arborist include her background in biology. Knowing the science behind the trees she works on helps her identify them, make smarter cuts and put more thought behind how she works with the trees. The bigger the tree, the better, Fox said when asked if she had a favorite type to work on. But all trees are unique and have different features that change how they're worked on. \"When I think about an elm tree, the wood is going to be strong,\" she said, pointing to an Elm then a Hackberry. \"Versus this Hackberry over here, that's really flexible wood and it's going to be more fibrous ... it's been interesting climbing over the years and being able to notice the difference between the different trees and how they respond.\" Her favorites to climb are Ash and Elm trees, she said, because their branches are long and they \"can grow in funkier ways,\" making limb walks more exciting. In her off time, Fox participates in tree climbing competitions through the International Society of Arboriculture, she said. Competitions include climbing the rope as quickly as she can, tossing a weighted bow into the tree to test aim, setting up and participating in aerial rescue, and other events that test the skills she uses daily at work. While Fox loves the physical part of her job, her passion for helping city residents access tree work keeps her climbing. \"I don't think it would be accessible for everybody because of how expensive it is,\" Fox said. \"So I'm definitely happy with this work.\"",

Kavach 4.0 is a technology-intensive system. It was approved by the Research Designs & Standards Organisation (RDSO) in July 2024. Many developed nations took 20-30 years to develop and install train protection systems. The commissioning of Kavach 4.0 on the Kota-Mathura section has been achieved in a very short timeframe. This is a very big achievement,” said Ashwini Vaishnaw, Union Minister for Railways.Kavach System :Advanced Train protection systems of international standard were not installed in the country in the last 60 years after independence. To ensure train and passenger safety, the Kavach system has recently been operationalized.Indian Railways is gearing up to commission Kavach 4.0 on various routes throughout the country within a short span of 6 years. Over 30,000 people have already been trained on Kavach systems. IRISET (Indian Railway Institute of Signal Engineering and Telecommunications) has signed an MoU with 17 AICTE-approved Engineering colleges, institutions, and universities for incorporating Kavach as part of their BTech course curriculum. Kavach will help the loco pilots in maintaining train speed by effective brake application. Even in low visibility conditions like fog, the loco pilots will not have to look outside the cabin for a signal. Pilots can see the information on the dashboard installed inside the cab.What is Kavach?● Kavach is an indigenously developed train safety system. It is designed to prevent accidents by monitoring and controlling train speeds.● It is designed at Safety Integrity Level 4 (SIL 4). This is the highest level of safety design.● Development of Kavach started in 2015. The system was extensively tested for over 3 years.● After technical improvements, the system was installed in South Central Railway (SCR). The first operational certificate was granted in 2018.● Based on the experiences gained in SCR, an advanced version, ‘Kavach 4.0’, was developed. It was approved in May 2025 for speeds up to 160 kmph.● Kavach components are being manufactured indigenously. Complexity of Kavach :Kavach is an extremely complex system. Commissioning of Kavach is equivalent to setting up a telecom company. It includes the following sub-systems:RFID tags: Installed at every 1 km along the entire length of the track. Tags are also installed at every signal. These RFID tags provide the precise location of the trains.Telecom Towers: Full-fledged telecom towers, including optical fiber connectivity and power supply, are installed across the track length every few kilometers. Kavach systems installed on locos and Kavach controllers at the stations are constantly communicating using these towers. It is equivalent to installing a complete network like that of a telecom operator.Loco Kavach: It interacts with the RFID tags installed on the tracks and relays the information to telecom towers and receives radio information from Station Kavach. Loco Kavach is also integrated with the braking system of the locomotives. This system ensures that the brakes are applied in case of an emergency.Station Kavach: Installed at every station and block section. It receives information from the Loco Kavach and signaling system and guides the Loco Kavach for safe speeds.Optical Fibre Cable (OFC): Optical fiber is laid along the tracks that connect all these systems for high-speed data communication.Signalling system: The Signalling system is integrated with the Loco Kavach, Station Kavach, telecom towers, etc.These systems need to be installed, checked, and certified without disrupting the railway operations, including heavy movement of passenger and goods trains.Indian Railways invests more than INR 1 lakh crore per year in safety-related activities. Kavach is one of the many initiatives taken to enhance the safety of passengers and trains.
