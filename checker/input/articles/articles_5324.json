    "title": "Justin Thomas 'luck' stuns Rory McIlroy, Donald Trump's $175M problem - NewsBreak",
    "text": "Golf enthusiasts have been on the edge of their seats this week with a series of thrilling events shaking up the sport. The excitement peaked when Rory McIlroy clinched his second victory at The Players Championship , outplaying J.J. Spaun in a nail-biting three-hole playoff that extended the tournament to a fifth day at TPC Sawgrass. The golf world was left stunned by Justin Thomas' incredible stroke of luck during the TGL Finals Series' second semifinal on Tuesday. Thomas led his team, Atlanta Drive Golf Club, to a commanding 9-3 win against Shane Lowry's Bay Golf Club, setting the stage for an epic final against Xander Schauffele's New York squad next week. Thomas' good fortune came into play halfway through the match, as Atlanta held a 4-2 lead. His iron shot on the par-five 10th took a miraculous bounce, steering clear of a hazard and setting him up for a two-putt par that helped him secure a win over Lowry. TGL co-founder McIlroy couldn't hide his astonishment at Thomas' lucky break, exclaiming \"no\" and adding on commentary: \"I don't want to sound biased here but that is just the luckiest bounce I've ever seen.\" This came after McIlroy's own Boston Common team was eliminated from the playoffs following a 10-6 defeat by New York. Looking ahead, McIlroy is gearing up for his next challenge at the Texas Children's Houston Open. Fresh off his triumph at The Players, he announced his intention to compete once more before making his way to Augusta, aiming to snap his prolonged major title drought. The World No. 2 has now decided to participate in The Houston Open for the first time, which tees off on Thursday, March 27. This gives McIlroy a week's rest before he sets his sights on his first green jacket. In other news, Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) is reportedly poised to throw a wrench into discussions aimed at resolving golf's internal conflict. The backers of LIV Golf have been in talks with the rival PGA Tour about a possible merger, having held two meetings at the White House with United States President Donald Trump. However, these promising discussions could be in jeopardy following a report by the Daily Mail this week that the PIF is stepping up its efforts to acquire Wentworth Golf Club in England. Hosting the DP World Tour's flagship BMW PGA Championship each year, a takeover by LIV would likely ruffle feathers among both the formerly named European Tour and their allies, the PGA Tour. According to the report, Wentworth's current owners, Chinese investment firm Reignwood Group, told the Daily Mail that the Surrey-based club they bought for £135 million ($175.5 million) in 2014 is not on the market, and no discussions have taken place with the Saudis. Despite this, the PIF is keen to expand its footprint in British golf, which could put a damper on the initial optimism surrounding Trump's involvement in the merger talks. Adam Scott, a member of the PGA Tour delegation that visited the White House last month, suggests that the ongoing negotiations are being hampered by disagreements over how LIV Golf and the PGA Tour can coexist. The Daily Mail's report also hinted that Saudi Arabia's interest in acquiring Wentworth might be a strategic move to pressure the PGA Tour into an agreement. The PGA Tour received a significant boost from last weekend's viewership numbers. The final round of The Players on NBC significantly outperformed the final round of LIV Golf's Singapore event on FS1, with a ratio of 100-1. McIlroy's victory over Spaun attracted an average of 3.6 million viewers on NBC, marking a roughly 3 percent increase from Scottie Scheffler's win the previous year. In contrast, LIV Golf's event, which ran from Saturday night into the early hours of Sunday, saw Joaquin Niemann's win draw a modest average of 34,000 viewers, following the Saudi-backed golf tour's new media rights deal with FOX Sports. Meanwhile, PGA Tour members are currently voting until April 14 to elect two co-chairs for the Player Advisory Council. Rickie Fowler, Maverick McNealy, and Keith Mitchell were announced as candidates on Tuesday, chosen by the player directors. The top two vote-getters will replace current player directors Peter Malnati and Webb Simpson starting January 1, 2026.",

Fulham appealed for a handball but referee Simon Hooper waved them away and a corner was given.\nRotherham had little to show for their efforts, and their low defensive line invited pressure in the 20th minute.\nFulham’s De Cordova-Reid threatened with a cross and the Cottagers’ Championship opponents were fortunate to not go a goal down from the following corner when Rodrigo Muniz’s effort was blocked.\nDe Cordova-Reid opened the scoring in spectacular fashion after 24 minutes.\nRotherham’s attempt to play the ball out from the back ran into trouble when Harry Wilson’s press forced a turnover and De Cordova-Reid’s long-range effort flew past Viktor Johansson into the top left corner.\nA lethargic Rotherham rarely ventured into Fulham’s territory but Jordan Hugill’s offside goal from a Tom Eaves cross added to their frustrations.\nFulham nearly doubled their lead in the 42nd minute but Pereira was denied by a post.\nRight-back Kenny Tete marauded forward and delivered a dangerous cross to the unmarked Pereira, who struck the ball into the ground before it cannoned off a post and into the path of Harrison Reed, whose close-range shot was deflected behind for a corner.\nFulham continued to be lively after the break. The dangerous Tete surged forward and his drilled cross caused Rotherham keeper Johansson to fumble the ball. The Swedish international’s blushes were saved when he made a stop from six yards out.\nThe hosts slowed the game down and dominated the ball but the game burst into life through Issa Diop after 76 minutes.\nThe centre-back picked up the ball and cut through Rotherham’s midfield before a neat combination with Timothy Castagne saw the towering defender’s first-time strike narrowly miss the target.\nFulham countered from a corner during five added minutes but Carlos Vinicius’ shot was saved after Willian squared it to him.",

    "title": "Bhagavad Gita's Divine Wisdom: Sin vs. Blessings in Verse 3 of Chapter 3",
    "text": "Hare Krishna, We will proceed on our journey with the 13th verse of the third chapter from Bhagavad Gita. As it is, the Sanskrit verse is as follows. Yagyashista shinhasanto munchante sarvakil bishaye bhunjate TE toa gham Papa. The English translation is as follows. The devotees of the Lord are released from all kinds of sins because they eat food which is offered first for sacrifice. Others who prepare food for personal sense enjoyment verily eat only sin. If you observe the verse, it says Yadge shishta which means remnants and ashina means to eat or accept. Santo means devotees and munchate Sarabhakil Bisha in which munchate means liberated and kilbishe means all the contaminations. So by taking remnants of yagya, saintly persons become free from all sinful reactions. Munjete tohum Papa in which Agham means the sin. So who are the sinners? The sinners are yeh pachante aat makaranat, those who cook for aat makaranat for their own purpose. So those who try to eat food for their own purpose, they consume sin only. The point is that in all the cultures there has traditionally been some form of acknowledgement that we should offer prayers to the higher being. For example, Christians may offer grace by folding their hands and praying, thanking God for providing food. Similarly, in different religions, there are various traditions that we recognize the food we receive as a provision from higher beings, not solely the result of our own efforts. While our efforts are important, they are not all important. When we offer food to Krishna, we acknowledge that we lack the capacity to produce food on our own. By recognizing that Krishna has provided the food, we express our gratitude. By offering food to Krishna, then accepting it, we acknowledge His mercy. Through this acknowledgement and the devotional connection it establishes, Krishna frees us from the sinful reactions. Yagya shishta shina Santa. Now someone may say that we are vegetarian and it is enough. Vegetarianism is important, but it is not all important. Vegetarianism alone will not free us from all sinful reactions, nor does it purify us completely. It does minimize the sinful reactions we incur and reduces the significant amount of violence that is occurring today. However, the important point is that even if the food is vegetarian, one is still eating sin if it is not offered to Krishna. Bhunjate TE togham Tata. So therefore, as a devotee, it is crucial for us to offer the food to Krishna and then accepting it as a reciprocation, as a mercy from Krishna. Thank you. We will discuss the 14th verse in the next episode. Hare Krishna.",

    "text": "Domingo 23 de Febrero de 2025, 09:51\nMhoni Vidente, la reconocida astróloga, sorprendió a sus seguidores con una nueva predicción sobre el futuro del Papa Francisco. A pesar de los reportes que indican una mejoría en su estado de salud, la vidente aseguró que se avecinan cambios importantes en el Vaticano.\nDurante una de sus recientes lecturas astrológicas, Mhoni Vidente analizó la situación del Papa Francisco y sostuvo que su salud sigue en un estado delicado. Según la astróloga, el Sumo Pontífice enfrenta una crisis médica que podría definir su futuro al frente de la Iglesia.\n“El Papa Francisco nació el 17 de diciembre, un número que representa ciclos de cierre y nuevos comienzos. Eso me indica que su etapa en el Vaticano está llegando a su fin”, explicó Mhoni.\nAdemás, la vidente aseguró que el líder de la Iglesia Católica no solo atraviesa dificultades físicas, sino que también enfrenta desafíos internos dentro del Vaticano. “No solo es un problema de salud, también hay presiones externas y conflictos que lo estarían llevando a tomar decisiones drásticas”, agregó.\nMhoni Vidente fue contundente al mencionar la posibilidad de una renuncia. En su visión, el Papa Francisco podría dejar su cargo antes de lo previsto debido a complicaciones médicas y presiones dentro del Vaticano.\n“La gente no lo quiere aceptar, pero lo veo cada vez más debilitado. Sus pulmones no están funcionando como antes, el COVID-19 le dejó secuelas importantes y eso está afectando su capacidad para hablar y respirar con normalidad. Quedará postrado en la cama”, detalló la astróloga. Además, advirtió que su salida abriría un nuevo capítulo en la historia de la Iglesia. “Veo un Papa nuevo en camino, alguien que traerá cambios significativos y una nueva era para la religión”, afirmó. /Aire de Santa Fe\nPredicciones del mes de Diciembre 2024 El Padre Francisco I grave de Salud por cuestión de Pulmones y Neumonia se reporta estando Crítico\n— Mhoni Vidente (@mhonividente)[#22deFebrero2025][#Mhonividente][#papa][#sanfrancisco][#Vaticano][#Roma][pic.twitter.com/IQW5JwOgnp][February 22, 2025]",
