    "text": "[Community Corner](/new-jersey/holmdel-hazlet/around-town) Monmouth County Siblings Aim To Expand Access To Mental Health Care Robyn DeRespinis and Adam Novick said they're hoping to help others with their mental health counseling service, Inner Clarity Counseling. HAZLET, NJ — When Monmouth County native Robyn DeRespinis sat down to speak with her brother, Adam Novick, about her idea to start a mental health counseling practice, she said there were two main goals she wanted to achieve: - She wanted an environment where she – and other therapists – could provide high-quality service for patients - She wanted to build a practice that allowed for expansive access to mental health care “Her thought was that if we could build an environment where therapists — at all stages of their career — had a home, a place that people want to work and where they can get paid, then we’d be doing a great service for the community,” Novick said. From there, [Inner Clarity Counseling](https://www.innerclarityllc.com/about) was born. Find out what's happening in Holmdel-Hazletwith free, real-time updates from Patch. Though the company has seen significant expansion since its start, Inner Clarity's group practice first began with Novick and DeRespinis' partnership. When the siblings first told family they were planning to go into business together, they said they were met with some hesitation from relatives: “We definitely got some feedback warnings from our family,” DeRespinis said. “You know, just making sure if anything goes awry to ‘please make sure you remember you’re still siblings, you’re still family.’” Find out what's happening in Holmdel-Hazletwith free, real-time updates from Patch. Despite hesitation from family members, DeRespinis said the warnings proved to be unnecessary. She and Novick have been working to run and expand Inner Clarity for years, and said they work “extremely well together\" as business partners. “We were kind of pleasantly surprised that we’ve been working really well together,” DeRespinis said. “You know, part of what’s hard for me as a clinician is we’re never really taught how to run a business. So the match with the two of us [Novick manages the business side of Inner Clarity], is really what’s needed to run a very smooth practice.” Currently, Inner Clarity Counseling has offices set up throughout Hazlet, Tinton Falls and Maplewood, New Jersey. Though the company hosts plenty of physical locations, it also offers online services for those who can’t (or prefer not to) attend in person. As the company's founder, DeRespinis serves as the Chief Clinical Officer of Inner Clarity Counseling, while Novick oversees the company’s business, marketing and finance. “As we’ve grown, there’s really been a need for me to build a mentoring system so new clinicians can get the support they need,” DeRespinis said. “We’ve spent a lot of time over the years refining our system when it comes to onboarding new therapists.” According to DeRespinis, part of that onboarding process includes looking at a therapist’s specialties, where their interest lies and what populations they want to work with among other factors to best match therapists and clients. “We really focus on that client-therapist match,” DeRespinis said. “It’s something really important for us. Anywhere else, maybe therapists and clients are matched based only on schedule and every clinician sees everyone, but we want to recognize that it’s important to match based on specialties as well.” In addition to matching therapists and clients, access to care is another important aspect of Inner Clarity's foundation. According to Novick, limitations in reaching those who need care was one of the main issues he and DeRespinis wanted to address when building Inner Clarity. Deciding to take insurance as a form of coverage was one way they aimed to remedy that issue. \"We wanted to bring on a model that allowed for people to develop their careers as providers, but also bring access to care for people looking to use their insurance,\" Novick said. \"You know? We wanted it so that people could use their insurance, come to Inner Clarity and get the care they need. And that vision is where we are today.\" As natives of Monmouth County, DeRespinis and Novick said community support has been vital for Inner Clarity's growth. The siblings said they tend to get referrals from friends and family, local schools, churches and synagogues, and other medical providers in the community — something that not only helps their expansion, but helps them get to know their patients and staff as well. “We grew up in Manalapan,” Novick said. “We’ve been in Farmingdale, Monmouth Beach, Freehold — and this is kind of the center where we’ve lived almost our entire lives.” “So we know this community very well,” Novick continued. “And it’s great to be able to give back to that community with these services.” To learn more about Inner Clarity Counseling, you can [visit their website](https://www.innerclarityllc.com/).

    "text": "Stephen Hoang, MD, is the medication safety officer and a pediatric anesthesiologist at Children's Health System of Texas in Dallas. He recently connected with Becker's to share his team's biggest priority for 2024 and proudest accomplishment of 2023. Note: Responses were lightly edited for length and clarity. Question: What is your top priority for 2024 and why? Dr. Stephen Hoang: Our medication safety team's top priority in 2024 is to reduce the number of medication errors that reach the patient. Errors are bound to occur, but if we can prevent them from reaching the patient, we can prevent patient harm. One strategy to do this is by using natural process and constraint process designs that make it hard to do the wrong thing and make it easier to do the right thing. Another strategy is to encourage good catches by all team members at every step of the medication-use process. Q: What was your proudest accomplishment from 2023 and why? SH: As the medication safety officer for our pediatric system, I am most proud of the creation of our multidisciplinary medication safety team in 2023 with designated physician, nursing and pharmacy leaders. Given that medication errors can account for a significant portion of adverse events in any hospital system, there is a strong need to address this type of hospital-acquired condition. Thus, our team is making a difference in improving safety at every step of the medication-use process. By emphasizing medication safety as a core component of what we do, we can improve the quality of the overall care that we provide to every child. Like what you see?

Loose objects could be tossed around, and tree branches may break.\nThere is also the potential for power outages due to downed lines.\n“Motorists, especially in high profile vehicles, may expect hazardous driving conditions on highways subject to strong cross winds,” warned Environment Canada.\nResidents are advised to secure loose items around their properties and take care when outside. Drivers should remain alert for sudden gusts and take extra caution while on the road.\nAdditionally, Environment Canada has issued a coastal flooding warning for the Greater Victoria coastline, including areas from Cordova Bay to East Sooke.\nThis warning is in effect due to moderate storm surge and higher-than-normal water levels.\nAccording to Environment Canada, a deep low-pressure system is expected to make landfall over northern Vancouver Island on Saturday, which will bring very strong southeast winds to Haro Strait.\nThe timing of the peak winds with high tide will create the potential for a storm surge, possibly rising up to 50 cm above the highest astronomical tide.\nThe storm surge, combined with significant wind and waves, could lead to minor coastal flooding, particularly in low-lying and exposed shorelines.\nFlooding along the coastline is possible, and residents should be prepared for higher-than-usual water levels, waves, or stronger currents. Minor flooding of basements is also a concern, so it’s advisable to elevate or relocate important items to the main floor.",

    "text": "The US-based anti-Hindu organisation, ironically named Hindus for Human Rights (HfHR), is hosting an event on Friday (23rd February) with the sinister objective of blaming Hinduism for supposedly being ‘anti-pluralism.’ In a reel posted on Facebook, HfHR informed that an event dubbed ‘Zionism and Hindu Supremacy: partners against Pluralism’ is scheduled at the Logan Media Centre in North Gate Hall of the University of California (Berkeley). The contentious programme, aimed at spreading canards about Hinduism, will also be broadcast via Zoom. “Be part of a dynamic discussion on the intersection of Zionism and Hindu Supremacy. Explore their roles in shaping world politics and human rights. Register for this thought-provoking event today!” the caption read. In a tweet, HfHR said, “Register now! The complex nexus of Zionism and Hindu Supremacy, an eye-opening exploration of two potent ideologies.” One of the speakers at the anti-Hindu event is Dana Bergen, a member of the ‘Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP).

As per a [report](https://nypost.com/2023/10/28/news/soros-funneled-15-m-plus-to-groups-rallying-for-hamas/) by The New York Post published in October last year, far-left billionaire George Soros donated $6,50,000 to the organisation to peddle its nefarious agenda. Groups behind Israel-bashing protests backing Hamas attacks got $15M-plus from Soros— New York Post (@nypost) [https://t.co/2BZF9CINQI] [pic.twitter.com/yJN2QAt3I9] [October 28, 2023] In February 2023, George Soros [inadvertently revealed](https://www.opindia.com/2023/02/george-soros-colour-revolution-india-adani-modi/) what we have known for a long time – that the billionaire is eyeing a ‘colour revolution’ in India. George Soros and his vicious ecosystem of NGOs, activists and journalists had been trying to prove PM Modi as an ‘electoral autocrat’ who needed to be ousted for the ‘greater good’ of this country. And it has been a work in progress for a long time. The far-left billionaire has also tried to use international institutions, which are funded by him, including [ Freedom House ](https://www.opindia.com/2021/03/us-government-funded-freedom-house-downgrades-india-on-freedom/)and [V-Dem (Varieties of Democracy) Institute](https://www.opindia.com/2022/03/v-dem-institute-continues-anti-india-propaganda-reduces-democracy-rating/) to tarnish the image of India at a global level. In January 2020, the American billionaire [committed $1 billion](https://www.opindia.com/2020/01/george-soros-1-billion-dollar-fight-nationalists-pm-modi-usa-china-russia/) to start a global university to “fight nationalists” and climate change, calling them twin challenges that threaten the survival of our civilisation. Controversies surrounding ‘Hindus for Human Rights’ According to the popular OSINT [handle](https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/washington-post-hitjob-against-disinfo-lab-anti-india-propaganda-before-2024-elections/) ‘Disinfo Lab’, HfHR was formed in the year 2019 by Indian American Muslim Council (IAMC) and the Organization for Minorities of India (OFMI). Interestingly, the three organisations had formed another outfit called the Alliance for Justice and Accountability (AJA). As per an [ article ](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/protesters-get-ready-for-narendra-modis-houston-rally/article29472579.ece)in The Hindu, the Alliance for Justice and Accountability had been at the forefront of leading demonstrations against the visit of PM Modi to Houston on September 22, 2019. Sunita Vishwanath, the co-founder of ‘Hindus for Human Rights’ had also tried to [create hysteria](https://web.archive.org/web/20200524180123/https://iamc.com/aja-indian-americans-announce-protest-against-modis-houston-visit/) and panic among Indian Muslims about the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in 2019. Sunita Vishwanath, co-founder of Hindus for Human Rights (— DisInfo Lab (@DisinfoLab) [#HfHR]) is co-host of multiple events with IAMC – all ‘concerned’ about India. Her other organization Women for Afghan Women is funded by Soros’ Open Society Foundation.

During this interactive session, students were curious about various aspects of living and working in space.\nHow Astronauts Drink in Space During the session, one student posed an intriguing question regarding the challenges of drinking fluids in a weightless environment. In response, Williams demonstrated the unique method astronauts use to consume liquids while in space, captivating the attention of the young audience.\nSpace Mission Update Currently, Sunita Williams and her colleague Barry “Butch” Wilmore are marking six months aboard the International Space Station. They are participants in a mission that initially aimed to be a week-long test flight aboard Boeing’s newly developed Starliner capsule. However, due to unexpected delays linked to the spacecraft, their return to Earth has been postponed until February.\nThis hands-on experience not only provided the students with insights into the life of an astronaut but also sparked their interest in space exploration and science.",

    "text": "El técnico del Barcelona, Xavi Hernández, valoró positivamente el pase y elogió al Barbastro. «No me ha sorprendido, los analizamos en el partido ante el Almería, sabíamos que eran muy intensos, con una buena presión, y conocíamos a varios del fútbol catalán. Se han activado tras el gol de córner . Dani está haciendo un buen trabajo y les deseamos lo mejor porque nos han tratado muy bien tanto aquí en Barbastro como en Monzón» , dijo el entrenador azulgrana, que tuvo claro que se les complicó el pleito «por errores puntuales» que a punto estuvieron de darle un susto: «En los últimos minutos hemos sufrido más de la cuenta por culpa nuestra»\nHeroico Barbastro A. Bobed «Para el Barbastro era el partido de su vida. Por eso se nos complica el partido, han tenido el 2-2. Sabíamos que si regalas y no estás con intensidad te cambia el partido, es la Copa», aseguró Xavi , que prefirió quedarse con lo positivo. «En líneas generales es un buen partido. Me quedo con la sensación de que hasta el 1-2, que regalamos nosotros, hemos estado bien en el juego, la primera parte ha sido muy buena, prácticamente no hemos concedido»\nSobre los penaltis, el técnico blaugrana no profundizó, aunque cargaba contra la ausencia de VAR: «No los he visto, ni a favor ni en contra. Me dicen que el gol de Joao Félix es clarísimo. Es una pena que no tengamos VAR en esta eliminatoria de la competición. Debería haber incluso en campos de menor categoría», aseveró.\nTensión al final del partido «Lo importante es que estamos en octavos, me quedo con que el equipo en muchos momentos dio buenas sensaciones. Objetivo cumplido y ya está» , aseguró Xavi, que espera que la lesión de Iñigo Martínez no sea grave y descartó una recaída al ser en la otra pierna y que restó importancia a los momentos de tensión que hubo tras el final del choque con algún empujón al técnico blaugrana. «No sucedió nada, solo cosas que se hablan con total respeto. No busquemos tensión donde no la hay». Su hermano y segundo entrenador, Óscar Hernández, fue expulsado por Pulido Santana al final del choque.",

    "title": "Justicia y el Ayuntamiento de Rute colaboran para facilitar la reeducación de menores infractores",
    "text": "El consejero de Justicia, Administraci\\u00f3n Local y Funci\\u00f3n P\\u00fablica, Jos\\u00e9 Antonio Nieto, ha firmado este viernes en Rute un convenio con el alcalde del municipio, David Ruiz, para que los menores infractores de la localidad y de la zona puedan cumplir medidas judiciales no privativas de libertad, tales como prestaciones en beneficio de la comunidad y tareas socioeducativas, en servicios municipales y, adem\\u00e1s, la Polic\\u00eda Local vigilar\\u00e1 a los menores que deban cumplir medidas de permanencia de fin de semana en sus domicilios. A este respecto, Nieto ha agradecido la colaboraci\\u00f3n y la implicaci\\u00f3n del Consistorio y ha recordado que la Junta de Andaluc\\u00eda tiene entre sus competencias garantizar los medios necesarios para la ejecuci\\u00f3n de las medidas impuestas por los jueces de Menores, tanto de internamiento, como de medio abierto. Para ello, la Ley del Menor permite realizar convenios con entidades p\\u00fablicas y privadas sin \\u00e1nimo de lucro para su cumplimiento. Los jueces pueden dictar medidas, como la realizaci\\u00f3n de prestaciones en beneficio de la comunidad y tareas socioeducativas, que persiguen la reeducaci\\u00f3n de los j\\u00f3venes mediante actuaciones reparadoras a la sociedad y que no suponen la privaci\\u00f3n de libertad. Tareas que, ahora, podr\\u00e1n realizar los menores de la localidad que cometan alguna infracci\\u00f3n en su propio municipio, sin necesidad de desplazarse, lo que facilita la ejecuci\\u00f3n de la medida y su fin. A este respecto, Nieto, que ha estado acompa\\u00f1ado por el director general de Justicia Juvenil, Esteban Rond\\u00f3n, y por la delegada territorial de Justicia en C\\u00f3rdoba, Raquel L\\u00f3pez, ha se\\u00f1alado que \\u00abeste tipo de medidas es una herramienta que tiene mucho \\u00e9xito en la reeducaci\\u00f3n de los menores. Cada vez tenemos m\\u00e1s demanda de los juzgados y por eso es tan importante que el Ayuntamiento d\\u00e9 un paso como este\\u00bb. \\u00abSon trabajos ejemplarizantes, con los que los chavales comprenden el da\\u00f1o que han provocado, por ejemplo, si un menor ha hecho una pintada pues se le puede imponer limpiar una calle con los equipos de limpieza\\u00bb, seg\\u00fan ha explicado el consejero. Por ello, para facilitar la realizaci\\u00f3n de estas tareas, la Consejer\\u00eda de Justicia tiene acuerdos con ayuntamientos y entidades sociales mediante los que los menores resarcen a la sociedad del da\\u00f1o causado con su conducta colaborando en labores, no remuneradas ni sustitutivas de puestos de trabajo. Recientemente, el pasado mes de septiembre, el consejero firm\\u00f3 sendos convenios con la Fundaci\\u00f3n Promi y C\\u00f3rdoba Acoge, lo que permite que los j\\u00f3venes tomen conciencia de otras realidades sociales. Con el convenio firmado en Rute, ya son 46 ayuntamientos de la provincia los que se suman a esta iniciativa, es decir, m\\u00e1s de la mitad de los municipios cordobeses. En los centros municipales los menores infractores pueden cumplir medidas de medio abierto realizando labores de mantenimiento de parques y jardines o restaurando el mobiliario urbano. La Delegaci\\u00f3n Territorial de Justicia ser\\u00e1 la encargada de hacer un seguimiento de cada caso, a trav\\u00e9s del Sistema Integral de Medio Abierto (SIMA), mientras que el Juzgado de Menores es el que debe establecer el tiempo de duraci\\u00f3n de la medida y el calendario de ejecuci\\u00f3n. En 2022, fueron 34 los menores que cumplieron este tipo de medidas en ayuntamientos y ONG, mientras que en este 2023 han sido 36. La mayor\\u00eda son varones y han estado cumpliendo prestaciones en beneficio de la comunidad en entidades como el Banco de Alimentos, la Cruz Roja o la Fundaci\\u00f3n Promi, as\\u00ed como en servicios de los consistorios de Encinajero, Lucena, La Carlota o Montoro. En este contexto, Nieto ha asegurado que el sistema de Justicia Juvenil andaluz es un referente dentro y fuera de Espa\\u00f1a, destacando el liderazgo de la comunidad en cuanto al trabajo de reeducaci\\u00f3n que se hace con los menores y el compromiso de la Junta con esta materia. \\u00abNo es un problema de clases sociales --ha asegurado--, pues nos puede pasar a cualquiera, a cualquier familia y a cualquier chaval, y tenemos que tender una mano a aquellos que han cometido un error\\u00bb.",
