    "title": "VirTra: Still Offers Value Despite Recent Rally",
    "text": "VirTra (NASDAQ:\nVTSI) is a small cap company that produces training solutions and simulations for law enforcement agencies around the world. Despite being up significantly in recent years and easily beating market returns, the stock could still offer a lot of value for long term investors.\nFirst, let's talk about what the company does. It offers technology driven solutions including simulations and virtual reality solutions to law enforcement agencies in order to train officers in how to use judgment in difficult and high tension situations. It also has training solutions for security providers and militaries operating in different countries. Some of the training solutions offered by the company include development of skills like de-escalation, judgmental use-of-force, marksmanship and a variety of real life situations.\nThese training programs should allow law enforcement agencies to handle situations more effectively, professionally and cause less headache for them since they are less likely to pull criticism for handling a situation wrongly. This is especially important in recent years where there is a rising awareness and scrutiny for law enforcement agencies and one mistake can ruin a police department's reputation for a long time. Training officers to handle difficult situations can be very difficult and costly in the real world due to additional costs like protective equipment, safety officers, specialized instructors or a large training site and VirTra's solution seems to work at a lower cost since it uses simulations and VR. It also offers immediate constructive feedback powered by AI which allows people to develop their skills quicker.\nSince simulations are much cheaper, they can be used repeatedly until officers are sufficiently trained. They can be used as often as daily whereas live training can only be done occasionally when there are availabilities in terms of training staff, location and equipment. Not only is this method cheaper but also it would allow someone to get up to speed much quicker and reduce the amount of time needed for training.\nThe company offers different products depending on the budget of the law enforcement agency. For example the V-300 Simulator is one of the most expensive products and it includes 5 screens giving a view of nearly 300 degrees. There are also cheaper products that cover less visual area such as V-180 Simulator which covers 180 degrees and V-100 Simulator which covers 100 degrees (basically one screen) for agencies with lower budget. Many times an agency will get one of the cheaper solutions, try it out for a while and if they are impressed with the results they will move on to a more expensive solution. This provides the company with a lot of opportunities to upsell its services and more products.\nOver the years, the company has done very well. It's 95% client retention rate allowed it to keep its revenues predictable and its upselling allowed it to grow its revenues over time. Currently the company enjoys annual revenues of $37 million in addition to an existing backlog of almost $20 million. This is up from $10 million just a few years ago. Another opportunity for the company to grow is to expand to more countries but this would probably require the company to come up with a cheaper product line since affordability will become an issue in many countries with limited budgets.\nThe company enjoys healthy margins that got better in recent years. The company's current gross margin of 64% is near the top of its 10-year range of 45% to 65% which indicates solid performance but also makes me wonder if there is any more room left for improvement. Meanwhile, the company also enjoys a 25% operating margin and nearly 20% net profit margin and both numbers are up significantly over the last few years. If the company can keep this up, it can be very successful but keep in mind that small cap companies tend to see their margins fluctuate more than large and established companies, so don't be surprised if these margins are all over the place next year. The good news is that the long term trend in the company's margins have been very healthy so far and we have little reason to expect it to change.\nSince the company uses a subscription model, most of its revenues and repeatable and recurring. Also one thing I like about this company is that it has very low levels of debt. Currently the company holds about $17 million in cash and only $8 million in debt. This low debt level gives it a Debt to Equity rate of 0.13 which shows very low levels of leverage if any.\nEven though the stock is up more than 100% in the last year and 600% in the last 10 years, it still enjoys a reasonable valuation. Its trailing P/E is 15 and forward P/E is 14 while the sector median is 23 for trailing P/E and 22 for forward P/E. This indicates that the company is trading at about 35-37% discount against its sector median in these metrics. When the company's strong growth is coupled with its low P/E, it gives it a very low PEG ratio well below 1. The company's EV/EBITDA metrics also look reasonable with trailing figure being 9.7 and forward figure being 8.0, both indicating a discount of about 30% versus sector median.\nOf course no investment is risk-free. Since this company offers one type of products and relies on one type of customer, you are at the mercy of a niche business. Currently there is a lot of appetite for police training and very few competitors but in the future this could quickly change. We could see local governments cutting training budgets if they run short on money and we could also see competition emerging. The company's products are patented but someone could always come up with something different and perhaps better. We could also see a shift in regulations and policies where in-person training might be required by agencies which would make this company's product not as desirable but this is a highly unlikely scenario in today's highly technological environment.\nI believe this stock offers good value as it offers growth at a reasonable price and in a niche market even though the stock has been up so much in recent years. Keep in mind that this is a small cap company with a market cap of $100 million so you must be comfortable with investing into small cap stocks in order to buy and hold this stock and many people are not totally comfortable with that which is understandable. As I always say, the best hedging is diversification so make sure that no stock claims too much of your total portfolio value and keep your individual positions small just in case.",

    "text": "Minnesota DHS substantiates physical abuse allegations at Rochester childcare center\n(ABC 6 News) — The Minnesota Department of Human Services has substantiated allegations of physical abuse at a Rochester childcare center.\nThe DHS investigation stemmed from allegations at Kids Come 1st in which it was reported that a staff person “tapped” a toddler on their head, causing them to fall and cut their lip on August 22, 2024.\nAccording to the investigative report, the staff person “inappropriately tapped” the toddler’s head after they spilled milk on a table, which caused the toddler to fall and hit their face on a stack of chairs. When a family member came to pick up the toddler later that day, they noticed a “little” cut on their lip.\nThe investigative report states that although the staff person said it was a “reaction,” the staff person was not immediately next to the toddler and had to walk over to them to engage.\nAs a result, the DHS determined that physical abuse occurred. The staff person was disqualified from a position allowing direct contact with, or access to, persons receiving services from programs, organizations, and/or agencies that are required to have individuals complete a background study by the Department of Human Services\nThe facility also conducted an internal review and determined that policies and procedures were adequate but not followed at the time of the incident.\nOn February 19, 2025, the facility was issued a correction order for the violation.",

    "text": "Debate Ederson's transfer request: Is he betraying Manchester City or just looking out for himself? The future of Ederson at Manchester City remains up in the air. Despite spending over 7 years at Etihad and winning over 17 trophies for Pep Guardiola’s side, the talk surrounding the Brazilian international to leave the Premier League champions continues to intensify. While fans continue to search for the answers regarding his potential departure, an interesting revelation has come to light that has sent many in disbelief. What if we tell you that the star goalie is allegedly pondering a decision to leave just because someone else was praised for their heroics? That someone is City’s back goalkeeper Stefan Ortega. Well, as per [a bizarre disclosure from journalist Sam Lee](https://x.com/City_Xtra/status/1816413088502907263?t=fFB-11q3-zK4ZTxY4JKoLg&s=08), Ederson was reportedly not impressed by the praise Ortega received for his title-defining save last season. It came during the clash against Tottenham Hotspur while facing Son Heung-min in a 1-v-1 situation. This was just the start for the Brazilian to question his time in the Blue side of Manchester as he further got informed of a suggestion primarily from the Cityzens that Ederson himself would not have been able to save it. Dots were further connected when in the aftermath of the 2-0 win against the North Londoners, the goalie posted a cryptic message on Instagram saying, “No one understands, but me.” ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Polls of the day Polls 1 of 4 What do you think is the real reason behind Ederson's transfer request?

Injuries Team chemistry Tactical adjustments Player fatigue What was the most impressive part of Mallory Swanson's performance against Zambia? Breaking Carli Lloyd's record Scoring an Olympic brace Leading USWNT to victory Her overall gameplay Meanwhile, days ago, Guardiola also broke his silence over Ederson’s transfer links: “I don’t know. He has to see maybe other options. Of course, I would like him to stay but it depends now on the clubs. I don’t really know the situation because there are no contacts in the last days and it’s a question of training and being with us until the transfer window is going to finish. We will see what is going to happen with him.” Regardless, if the report does prove to be true then it would be a shocker from Ederson. For now, he shall listen to what fans have to say about these rumors. Cityzens tear up Ederson over bizarre reason to allegedly leave Manchester City Fans on X, formerly Twitter are rather bemused to hear the reported reason why Ederson plans to leave Manchester City. Despite knowing that he has remained a starter under Pep Guardiola, many feel it’s quite odd for him to exit the club on such grounds. This fan has questioned Ederson’s lack of taking up constructive criticism. Even if fans did question his ability to make the save that Stefan Ortega did, the best way to reply to the criticism would have been to give brilliant performances. But it looks like he is running away from the good criticism. I knew it… instead of working and getting better he decides it’s better to run💀 — Alex (@alexquintani11a) [July 25, 2024] The Brazilian’s natural response to such criticism should have been to appreciate his teammate and keep working hard to become better. Yet, apparent jealousy can be smelled from Ederson, which also calls for many to question Ederson’s team spirit. “Oh look am jealous of my teammate for making a save that won us the league title..” What a weird guy — Deedy 🇧🇪 (@DeedyMCFC) [July 25, 2024] This fan has highlighted the brighter side that the former Benfica man should consider. Though the hard truth remains unchanged, both Ederson and Ortega have certain strengths and weaknesses that make them unique in their own way. But he wouldn't have saved it really, both keepers have their strength — Patrick (@PatoEner) [July 25, 2024] Questions are again being raised over City’s star No. 1’s sportsmanship and lack of accountability. Ups and downs are part of the game, especially when there’s a battle between 25+ players to break it into the starting XI every single day. Instead, Ederson is facing superiority complex issues and cannot stand the praise of his compatriot, who took one for the team. Nahhh get out eddie what a snowflake 😭💀 — Adezz (@Greatest_Pep) [July 25, 2024] ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Yet another Cityzen looks happy to see the 30-year-old leave the Etihad Stadium, reminding everyone of Joao Cancelo’s fallout with Pep Guardiola. The right-back had questioned the Spaniard for starting young talents over him, even though he wasn’t at his best. Selling Ederson can be beneficial for City if they wish to avoid a similar situation. Get him gone that’s shocking mentality sounds like Cancelo all over again — zach (@zach_mcfc) [July 25, 2024] ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Be that as it may, it’s clear that fans aren’t impressed to learn the potential reason that may result in the departure of Ederson. For now, let’s see what developments unfold over his future at Manchester City.",

    "text": "Katie Perinovic murdered her three young children before killing herselfClaire, 7, Anna, 5, and Matthew, 3 perished in the Tullamarine home in 2021Tom Perinovic had been sending photos of television sets to his wife at the timeMr Perinovic is suing his wife's doctor and hospital for negligenceREAD: Could Dan Andrews' lockdowns be the blame for the unthinkable\nGrieving father Tom Perinovic will see out the New Year with renewed determination as he plans to hold accountable those he believes left his children to die at the hands of their delusional mother.\nKatica ‘Katie’ Perinovic, 42, murdered her children Claire, 7, Anna, 5, and Matthew, 3 one by one before taking her own life inside their Tullamarine home, north-west of Melbourne, on January 14, 2021.\nTheir dad, who had been out buying his family a new television set when the atrocity happened, will head to court next year seeking damages from his wife’s general practitioner Dr Abid-Ur Rahman and Melbourne Health.\nFather Tomislav Perinovic (left), the children and Ms Perinovic. Mr Perinovic has been left devastated by the tragedy\nAs Mr Perinovic prepares to seek justice for his children, Daily Mail Australia can reveal heartbreaking details into the little lives lost.\nClaire was described by her aunty Maria as ‘pure joy’.\n‘She had a beautiful personality. She was beautiful, kind, caring, gentle, considerate, thoughtful, smart and funny,’ Maria told Victorian Coroner Audrey Jamieson during a hearing in November last year.\n‘She was always happy and smiling. The best big sister and big cousin.’\nClaire’s little sister Anna was described as the family’s ‘little entertainer’.\n‘Cheeky, very funny and was a jokester with a great sense of humour,’ Maria said.\n‘She loved to learn new things and couldn’t wait to start school… she even wore her school uniform on orientation day.\n‘She was so motherly and loved looked after her younger cousins. We miss her sucking her finger and dummies.’\nThe two sisters had a passion for music and loved dancing together.\n‘I miss watching their performances together,’ their shattered aunty told the court.\nDetectives arrive at the crime scene on January 14, 2021. The carnage inside was described as ‘gruesome’\nMatthew had been the little brother they had all wished for.\n‘His two older sisters loved him so much and he loved them,’ Maria said.\n‘He loved his cars, monster trucks, playing in the sand and digging, superheroes and wearing his superhero costumes.\n‘He was a sweet boy, kind and caring.’\nThe children had loved nothing more than being at home playing together in the backyard.\nRiding their bikes and scooters up and down the driveway, they had been a postcard example of what appeared from the outside to be a perfect family.\n‘They all loved painting, doing Play-Doh and drawing together. They loved going to the beach, swimming classes, bike riding, and playing in the park,’ Maria said.\nIt was the lifeless and bloody body of little Matthew that Mr Perinovic found first on that dreaded day.\nMatthew had been his father’s shadow.\nWhen Mr Perinovic arrived home he found his son in the front lounge with injuries to his head and arm.\nUnaware the remainder of his family lay dead in another room, he called Triple Zero.\nWhile paramedics worked on Matthew, Mr Perinovic went into the rear living room and saw what his wife had done.\n‘They’re all dead,’ he told paramedics.\nA view of the backyard where the Perinovic family was killed\nPeople continued to leave flowers outside the Tullamarine property for weeks on end\nMaria told the court her brother is now a broken man.\n‘How will he ever trust another person after what his wife did,’ she told the coroner.\n‘I worry that people judge him, and if they are unkind to him.\n‘For men there is always a stigma about how he treated his family which is unfair. Tom was a loving, supportive, kind, loyal and hardworking father and husband.’\nIndeed, Mr Perinovic was initially arrested at the scene, with the media not being told for a full day that he had not been the killer.\n‘Media was not told immediately that he didn’t do it, it was 24 hours later. This was not good enough,’ Maria said.\n‘Everyone thought he was a guilty man, who murdered his family. His image was all over the media.’\nMr Perinovic had been so distraught he could not even converse with the detectives that barked questions at him.\n‘When the police came there were so many people, and I was in a state of shock that I couldn’t speak,’ he told the court.\n‘I was just lost for words, and it was incomprehensible to me what I had just seen in my home.’\nShackled in handcuffs, he was taken away in an ambulance as paramedics tried to calm him down.\n‘The police treated me unfairly. I was immediately handcuffed. The male paramedic treated me in the ambulance while I was still handcuffed,’ Mr Perinovic said.\n‘There were so many faces and detectives questioning me outside on the nature strip in front of everyone in the street. I even recall one policewoman yelling at me during this traumatic experience.’\nKatie Perinovic, 42, murdered her children while their father was out on a shopping trip\nMr Perinovic said the trauma of that day would haunt him forever.\n‘Living with the loss of my entire family I still just can’t believe my wife would do this to our lovely, beautiful kids,’ he said.\n‘After it happened, I was scared to go anywhere. I continue to be paranoid and uneasy around knives.\n‘I still have nightmares, and flashbacks to what I saw that day. I have to live with this forever.\n‘I have wanted to end my life numerous times. The hurt and pain never leave me. I’m angry and sad most days. I hope that one day I can help others that have gone through a trauma like this.’\nIn a brief writ filed with the Supreme Court last week, Mr Perinovic’s lawyers claim his pain was caused in part by the alleged negligence of Dr Rahman and NorthWestern Mental Health Service.\nVictoria had been in the grip of what would become the longest Covid-19 lockdown on the planet when Katie seemingly lost her mind.\n‘There was a huge negative impact during the Covid lockdown on our family and particularly Katie. We were unable like others in Victoria to see our family and friends for so many months,’ Mr Perinovic told the coroner.\nUntil Victorians were locked down, Katie had been a successful physiotherapist.\nIsolated from her family and friends, her mental health rapidly declined.\nCurtains at the property can be seen closed. Tom Perinovic suspected all was not well inside. He was right\nWhile Katie found the strength to return to her beloved job in October 2020, she resigned just weeks later under a cloud of mystery.\nShe had worked at the very same clinic for the previous 16 years.\n‘A few days after she resigned, I got a phone call from her boss, saying ‘your wife needs help. Go see a doctor. I can’t tell you what she’s done.’ And that was it,’ Mr Perinovic told the coroner.\n‘He said, ‘you haven’t been looking after your wife.’ I asked in what way? He was saying she needed mental help. I have no idea what happened at her work, and I have no idea what her boss was talking about.’\nConcerned over her own mental decline, Katie went to see her local doctor, Dr Rahman.\nBy then she had been feeling paranoid, exhausted and anxious.\nShe had earlier told her husband she believed she was being covertly watched by CCTV cameras within their own home.\nDr Rahman prescribed her sleeping pills and sent her home, prompting Mr Perinovic to return with her the very next day in the hope of having her treated properly, the court heard.\nWith her husband by her side, Katie was referred to the Royal Melbourne Hospital’s mental health department, NorthWestern Mental Health.\nClaire, 7, Anna, 5, and Matthew, 3 were all slain by their own mother inside their home\nTom Perinovic had been texting his wife asking her for an opinion on television sets he was looking to buy for the family\nBut her mental health continued to spiral out of control as the lockdowns continued.\n‘Ultimately, Covid restrictions meant I was unable to come into most appointments with Katie and I would have to wait in the car or not attend. I was unaware of what was happening in Katie’s appointments or her treatment plan, unless Katie told me what was happening,’ Mr Perinovic told the coroner.\nWhen Mr Perinovic eventually worked his way inside a consultation with his wife, she asked him to leave in what he would later learn had been the midst of a ‘psychotic episode’.\nWith less than a month before her murderous rampage, Katie overdosed on her medications.\nShe refused to go to hospital, telling her doctor the following day she had simply wanted to sleep.\n‘He was in an angry mood with us. I didn’t know why. He said, ‘I want you to hide the medication, and give it to her every day.’ It was his idea for me to manage the medication. I listened, and I hid it in garage and locked it,’ Mr Perinovic told the court.\nKatie’s mental health practitioner would only learn of the suicide attempt after she had already killed her family.\n‘There was no discussion, or anything mentioned explicitly about the kids being at risk of harm,’ Mr Perinovic said.\nJudge Jamieson found the treatment given to Katie was ‘suboptimal’, but stopped short of linking her death to the care of Dr Rahman.\n‘I find no causal link between North Western Mental Health and Dr Abid-ur Rahman’s treatment of Katica Perinovic and her decision to take her own life and that of her children,’ she found.\n‘I do, however, find that the mental health treatment that was provided to Katica Perinovic to be suboptimal in the circumstances.’\nFor confidential support please call LIFELINE: 13 11 14 www.lifeline.org.au, Suicide Call Back Service: 1300 659 467 or 1800RESPECT",
