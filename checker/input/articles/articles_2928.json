    "text": "Carrie Underwood Rocked Guns N' Roses North American Tour was a top 23 story of Aug 2023: (fcc) 8-time GRAMMY Award winner Carrie Underwood rocked the stage for the first of three stadium dates she is joining on the North American leg of Guns N' Roses World Tour 2023 at Croix-Bleue Medavie Stadium in Moncton, NB on Saturday night. Underwood's eclectic set, backed by her stellar 8-piece band, included unique mash-ups and covers by some of Underwood's longtime rock inspirations such as Joan Jett, Pat Benatar, and Heart, while also covering other crowd-pleasing favorites by Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, and MotÃ¶rhead. The enthusiastic crowd also sang along to Underwood's smash hits, as well as newer tracks from her most recent album, Denim & Rhinestones. During Guns N' Roses headlining set, Underwood joined the iconic rock legends for their classic hit \"Sweet Child O' Mine,\" and was invited back again to the stage for the night's final number, the anthemic \"Paradise City.\" Underwood appears with Guns N' Roses again at the Parc Jean-Drapeau in Montreal, QE on August 8, and at GEODIS Park in Nashville, TN on August 26. Underwood made worldwide headlines last year when she welcomed Guns N' Roses frontman Axl Rose as a surprise special guest during her headlining performance at the Stagecoach Festival in April 2022. She joined the band onstage that summer for two songs during each of their July 1 and 2 shows at the UK's Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, and Rose made another surprise appearance during the L.A. Crypto.com Arena stop on Underwood's Denim & Rhinestones Tour, earlier this year. After completing her 43-city The Denim & Rhinestones Tour in March, Underwood resumed her ongoing REFLECTION: The Las Vegas Residency at Resorts World Las Vegas, which continues in September. She will star in her 11th consecutive show open for NBC's Sunday Night Football this Fall, and recently launched her exclusive year-round channel, CARRIE'S COUNTRY, on SiriusXM. A deluxe edition of her Denim & Rhinestones album, featuring six new tracks, will be out September 22. Check out video [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/CvpWGY1gWwz/).

    "text": "House Republicans are attacking a proposal that would remove medical bills from consumer credit reports.\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) issued its proposed rule in June, quickly drawing a rebuke from Rep. Patrick McHenry, the North Carolina Republican who heads the House Financial Services Committee.\nOn Thursday (Aug. 15), McHenry and other Republicans on the committee wrote to CFPB Chairman Rohit Chopra expressing their concerns about the proposal.\n“The CFPB’s recent notice of proposed rulemaking restricting inclusion of medical debt in credit reports and scores will undermine underwriting processes and increase risk in the financial system, to the detriment of consumers,” the letter reads. “This effort will have significant negative effects on access and affordability of credit for all consumers, and particularly for low-income borrowers.”\nThe letter goes on to argue that the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) requires credit reports to be accurate and complete and that including medical debt in those reports fits this requirement.\n“The CFPB does not provide sufficient data in the proposed rule to support its claim that there are more inaccuracies in reporting of medical debt than other types of debt,” the letter adds.\nThe legislators argue that the proposal will lead to important debt information being withheld from creditors, leading to negative consequences such as consumers being approved for mortgages despite having “hidden” default risks.\nIn addition, medical providers could begin “requiring additional upfront payments for procedures as they will have less assurance of payment after the procedure occurs, limiting access for vulnerable consumers who cannot afford to pay in full .”\nThe bureau’s proposal would block credit reporting companies from sharing medical debts with lenders and would prevent lenders from using medical information in making lending decisions.\n“Medical bills on credit reports too often are inaccurate and have little to no predictive value when it comes to repaying other loans,” Chopra said in a news release.\nThe rule would shut a “regulatory loophole” that has kept “vast amounts” of medical information in the credit reporting system, the CFPB added in the release.\nWhile Congress has barred lenders from accessing or using medical information, including information about debts, federal agencies have since issued a special regulatory exemption that allows creditors to use medical debts in their credit decisions.",

    "text": "Six months after Hardeep Singh Nijjar’s assassination, his community members face threats but say they’re not defeated. Surrey, British Columbia – On a Saturday afternoon in a Sikh temple in Surrey, Canada, boys and men with determined faces wield swords and sticks at each other in an ancient martial art called gatka. “We are a rebellious community,” Gurkeerat Singh, a farmer, electrician, photographer and spokesperson for the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara Temple, tells me. Surrey is about a 45-minute train ride outside of Vancouver. The city of half a million people is home to the second-largest Sikh population in the country. Keep readinglist of 3 items [India tells Canada to withdraw 41 diplomats over Sikh murder rift: Report](/news/2023/10/3/india-tells-canada-to-withdraw-41-diplomats-over-separatist-murder-rift-ft?traffic_source=KeepReading) [India’s JSW Steel slows stake buy in Canada firm on diplomatic spat: Report](/economy/2023/9/21/indias-jsw-steel-slows-stake-buy-in-canada-firm-on-diplomatic-spat-report?traffic_source=KeepReading) Today, as the first snow of the season melts in puddles outside the building, there’s a small but encouraging crowd watching the gatka tournament inside. “From a young age, we teach our children to be armed and learn how to defend themselves,” says Gurkeerat. That need for the community to defend itself no longer feels like a hypothetical scenario in this fast-paced suburban city, which has the slogan: “The future lives here”. Not since the assassination of Sikh separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Surrey in June. “The game has completely changed,” says 42-year-old Moninder Singh, a spokesperson for the British Columbia Gurdwaras Council. “Now, it’s no longer, you live to fight another day but you don’t know if you’ll live, the way they’re operating. Hardeep’s assassination, although not a surprise, was still unprecedented.” “They” refers to the Indian government and “you” to the Sikh community in Surrey, which is at the eye of a major diplomatic and political storm that has engulfed relations between Ottawa and New Delhi relations. Nijjar, the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurudwara president who came to Canada as a refugee in 1997 from Punjab in northwest India, was driving out of the temple’s parking lot in his pick-up when he was shot dead by two masked assailants on June 18 – Father’s Day. Many in the community believe the killers were local gangsters, hired by the Indian state. They felt vindicated when Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced to Parliament in September that there was credible evidence that India had a hand in the killing of Nijjar. It set off a diplomatic war: Each country expelled diplomats from the other, trade talks stalled and even visa services were temporarily affected. At the heart of the accusation against India lies its effort to crush a separatist Sikh movement that Nijjar advocated for vocally. For the past four decades, many Sikhs in communities around the world have been demanding that an [independent Sikh state](/news/2023/9/19/india-canada-row-who-was-hardeep-singh-nijjar-what-is-khalistan-movement), known as Khalistan, be carved out for them in Punjab. India designated Nijjar and other pro-Khalistan leaders of the Sikh diaspora, such as New York-based Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, as “terrorists” – a charge they and their supporters deny. And in November, federal prosecutors in the United States indicted an Indian hitman on charges of working with Indian government intelligence in a bid to kill Pannun, lending further credence to concerns that New Delhi was deploying kill squads for targeted assassinations abroad. The Indian government has insisted that such acts are not a part of its policy and said it is investigating the US allegations regarding the plot against Pannun. Six months after the murder of 45-year-old Nijjar, a married plumber and father of two, several Sikh leaders in Surrey say they have received threats on social media. Some have been alerted to threats by Canadian officials. But many in the community say that whatever happens, they will not be silenced or defeated. ‘Blown up in their face’ Today, Surrey is home to about 154,000 followers of the Sikh faith, 170,000 Christians and about 30,000 Hindus. A hub for students, immigrants and others looking for cheaper housing, it is a city of shopping complexes, with many boasting Indian restaurants with names like Happy Singh Sweet Treats. Further down the highway in Delta, a city that borders Surrey, there is a plaza called Little India. Unveiled as a cultural precinct for the South Asian community in 2016, it features boutiques like The Turban Villa, which sells stitched turbans and accessories and provides services “for any type of turban tying for marriages, parties” as well as bridal shops such as Sleek Bazar. There are also insurance and immigration agents, fabric stores and chai sellers. The area is a microcosm of the Sikh community’s growing stature in Canada’s public life. There are about [770,000 Sikhs](/news/2023/10/20/canada-pulls-41-diplomats-from-india-amid-row-over-separatists-killing) in the country – the largest population outside of India – making up 2.1 percent of the population. Many families moved to Canada in the 1980s amid a harsh crackdown by Indian security agencies in Punjab against perceived supporters of the Khalistan movement, which international rights groups condemned at the time. The Punjab police were accused by activists, and even the US Department of State, of carrying out extrajudicial killings. In June 1984, the Indian Army raided the Golden Temple in the Punjab city of Amritsar with tanks to drive out armed separatists, killing hundreds of people, including pilgrims. Four months later, then-Indian [Prime Minister Indira Gandhi](/news/2023/6/8/india-slams-canada-for-parade-float-showing-ex-pm-gandhis-murder) was killed by two of her bodyguards. An anti-Sikh massacre followed in the streets of New Delhi and other parts of the country. Thousands of Sikhs were killed. Today, many see shades of a repeat of those attacks on Sikhs by Indian authorities – only this time, in Canada. “They’re very desperate right now to shut us out – and they’re willing to kill for it,” says Moninder, whose parents were born in India. “But it’s kind of blown up in their face. That’s the same tactic they used in Punjab, where they would kill and strike fear into villages and families … ‘Your child is next.’ “It didn’t really have the intended effect and I think that was apparent a week after Hardeep’s assassination, when about 30,000 people marched his coffin through the streets. I’ve never seen something like that before.” Moninder is still grieving the loss of a “brother”. He describes his comradeship with Nijjar as the pairing of an odd couple. “I’m born and raised here,” says Singh. “He’s born and raised in Punjab. He grew up in a family that was fighting in the movement, was tortured by the police while he was a teenager… He fled the country because people around him started to disappear while he was in college. Me, I went to elementary school, high school, university, everything here.” What bound them together, in about 2006, was the struggle for Khalistan. The movement has always ebbed and flowed, depending on events in Punjab and how much traction the diaspora can achieve, says Moninder. After what he calls the “peak violence” of the 1980s and 1990s, there was a period of quiet when the community endured what he says was a collective post-traumatic syndrome disorder (PTSD) before they realised that they needed to regroup. “For the last decade, we’ve been growing in strength,” says Moninder. “We were vocal then. But now being vocal has landed a lot differently, especially in the social media age. We’re able to get into people’s homes faster. It’s easier. There’s more channels to do so. “India is having a hard time dealing with us now.” ‘They can kill us’ At a bus stop not far from the temple, Amrita Sidhu, 68, a housewife who came to Canada in 1998 from India with her husband, tells me in limited English that Nijjar was “not bad”. “He did good work. He made [the] building very good. You see that building before, he made another building over that side,” she says pointing to the temple. “I don’t know what happened in India. In India, maybe he has a criminal record. Here, he did good work. He comes to the temple, he helps people.” When asked if she thinks there will be another murder, she says, “I don’t know yet.” Further down the highway, opposite an insurance business, a group of young men wearing turbans stand near cars, passing a cigarette around. “Everybody’s busy shopping, getting on with their lives,” one of them says with a shrug when I ask how they feel. “Nobody gives a s***. It happens.” But many in the community do care. Around the same time as Nijjar’s assassination, Sikh activist Avtar Singh Khanda died suddenly in Birmingham in the United Kingdom, sparking questions from his family and friends. Months earlier, Khanda had voiced concerns that Indian police had verbally harassed him via phone and threatened his family in Punjab. Members of the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara are adamant the Indian government was behind Khanda’s death, too. The circumstances are “highly suspicious”, says Gurpreet Kaur Rai, British Columbia’s president of the World Sikh Organization of Canada and a lawyer. “Although the UK government hasn’t come out to say that the Indian government was behind that, we know that it was.” Closer to home, at least three Surrey Sikhs – those who have come forward publicly – have received a “duty to warn” notice from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and the Integrated National Security Enforcement Team (INSET) that their lives were in danger. The notices did not contain specific details. Gurmeet Singh Toor, a senior member of the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara, who was close to Nijjar, received one of the notices. For security reasons, Toor has sent his 11-year-old daughter to stay with his brother-in-law. When she will return, he says, “depends on the Canadian government and police”. “I plead to the Canadian police if they [can] capture anybody who’s giving us [a] threat,” he says. “Otherwise they can kill us.” Other Sikh leaders in the community, such as the gurdwara’s Gurkeerat Singh and Jasveer Singh, a senior press officer with the global Sikh Press Association, regularly receive threats on social media, they say. The community also faces another India-related threat, say its leaders. In Surrey and nearby Abbotsford, groups purportedly linked to Indian gangster Lawrence Bishnoi are threatening business owners, demanding ransoms from them. Bishnoi’s gang has previously claimed a role in the killings of pro-Khalistani activists in Canada. Jasveer Singh describes it as a “different element of Indian nationalist thuggery”, claiming that the Punjabi Sikh community is being “terrorised” economically, too. Behind the threats, there is “a lot of jealousy about the Sikh diaspora” in Surrey, he says. “You can probably see it yourself. We’ve done very successfully,” he says. The country has 18 Sikh members of Parliament and there are many Sikh businesses, he notes. “We’ve held onto our heritage. We’re freedom fighters. We’ve held onto that … There’s a resentment that we’re newer migrants.” The gangs think that the community is against India and that “we don’t deserve what we have”, he adds. ‘Chardi kala’ But Kaur Rai says the community is drawing strength from its faith. “There’s a concept called ‘chardi kala’, which translates into ‘rising spirits’. So, we always try to stay and remain in chardi kala, even when times are tough.” Kaur Rai, 25, herself grew up going to the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara to pray and volunteer. “We’ve always known that there’s these issues with the Indian state and Sikhs,” she tells Al Jazeera while sitting in her car, just metres from where Nijjar was gunned down. Yet, the community, she says, remains undeterred from its beliefs. In the dining hall on the same level of the two-storey temple, a free lunch is being served. We can see followers sitting cross-legged on a mat on the floor, eating among the sounds of kirtan (chanting), drums, chattering and the clanging of cutlery. The diners today include Ajaib Singh Bagri, who was co-acquitted in 2005 of mass murder and conspiracy charges over two Air India bombings in 1985 that killed 331 people. “I think historically, maybe a few years ago, the people in the community and parents didn’t want to talk about Khalistan or even say the word because we were conditioned by the Indian state that it was a bad word to say,” says Kaur Rai. But in the past few years this has changed, she says. “Hardeep’s death has been a watershed moment for Surrey, and all Sikhs around the world. People are coming to terms with the fact that everybody has the right to support and advocate for what they believe in and there’s nothing wrong with talking about or advocating for Khalistan.” ‘Unprecedented times’ That confidence within the community did not come easily. “It took a long time,” says Moninder, of the British Columbia Gurudwara Council. “But India has nowhere to run now the truth is out for the entire world that India is running these types of operations across the world. They’re undermining the sovereignty of countries like Canada, the United States, the UK.” Still, India is not the only one that has questions to answer. Given the current threat, many in the community now want to know how their government in Canada is going to keep them safe. “We don’t think it’s enough for you to just inform somebody and say, ‘Look, you know there’s a threat to your life, be safe’,” says Kaur Rai. “This murder has fuelled a fire in the community to hold those that are responsible accountable and ask for accountability, whether that be from the Canadian government or elsewhere.” Nijjar’s image is everywhere in the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara. Most prominently, he is featured on a poster for an unofficial Khalistan global referendum campaign that sits high up on the front of the temple. Previous rounds of voting were held here in September and October. More are slated for the US. The referendum, primarily targeting the diaspora, asks Sikhs whether they want a separate nation carved out of India. Nijjar is also on the wall of the hall where a placard declares that he was the “first Khalistani leader in Canada to attain martyrdom”. It reads that he was “assassinated by the Indian government”. And he’s on a 2024 calendar currently being given out to community members. “We feel his spirit gives us energy,” says Gurkeerat Singh. “He was a short individual. But when he walked into the room, he was the tallest man in the room.” Unlike community veterans who endured the turbulence of the 1980s, younger members are still grappling with what the implications of Nijjar’s assassination are for them. Jasveer, of the Sikh Press Association, was born in 1986, two years after the Golden Temple was invaded. He remembers watching a film with his mother about the 1980s and how she started crying, reminded of the fear that had enveloped Punjab then. Now, he says, he understands better what his community elders went through. “It’s one thing to hear about it … and being hated by the Indian government and the nationalists that don’t want Punjab to be free is one thing,” he says. “But to see it take this form … we’re in unprecedented times for our generation.”",

    "text": "FORT LAUDERDALE, FLA. (WSVN) - A South Florida man is rolling again after thieves swiped his electric skateboard, and he has a local group to thank.\nVincent Richardson said he uses his one-wheel as his mode of transportation everywhere he goes.\n“I do not use my car. I use only my one-wheel; that’s all,” said Richardson.\nBut a routine trip to a Target location in Fort Lauderdale earlier this month was different. Thieves sneaked up on Richardson and took his one-wheel right out of his cart before he got inside.\n“After he took the board, and I knew that it was gone, depression. I got so depressed, man,” he said. “I’m going like, ‘Man, what am I going to do? I can’t run after him,'” said Richardson.\nRichardson said he chased after the getaway car, opened the door, and was faced with a knife.\nThe subjects got away with his one-wheel board, which Richardson said costs over $1,500.\nIt’s an amount that, Richardson said, he cannot afford to replace the board.\nLuckily for him, the one-wheel community in South Florida is more than just one guy.\nThe South Florida Onewheel Group stepped up to help Richardson replace his board.\n“We get together to do stuff like this when stuff happens, we support our group very well, and I couldn’t be prouder to be part of a group like this. It’s pretty awesome,” said Cory Boehne of the South Florida Onewheel group.\nThe replaced one-wheeler is easier than it looks, even for a novice.\nA member of the group showed 7News reporter Jack Royer how to ride one.\n“Go faster, backwards to slow down, and then just jump off with both feet,” said the member.\nSouth Florida Onewheel is a close-knit group, as they keep an eye out for the stolen board and the subjects.\n“We have literally gone and gotten boards back from people who have stolen them. We watch, we look, we check pawn shops, we check the online ads,” said Boehne. “If we find you, we’ll come and take it.”\nFor now, Richardson is back on one wheel and has put the brazen snatch-and-grab behind him.\n“I’m floating again,” he said.\nThe thieves remain on the run, and police currently do not have any leads.\nThe group said they will keep an eye out in case they see Richardson’s board pop up anywhere around town.\nIf you have any information on this theft, call Broward County Crime Stoppers at 954-493-TIPS. Remember, you can always remain anonymous, and you may be eligible for a reward of up to $5,000.\nCopyright 2023 Sunbeam Television Corp. All rights reserved.

    "text": "“Não é Não”: lei para vítima de assédio em casas noturnas é sancionada Presidente Lula sancionou lei “Não é não”, destinada a proteger vítimas de assédio em casas noturnas, que entra em vigor em 6 meses atualizado Compartilhar notícia O presidente [Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva](https://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=AwrihRdTno5lGD8ZYZUf7At.;_ylu=Y29sbwNiZjEEcG9zAzEEdnRpZAMEc2VjA3Ny/RV=2/RE=1703874259/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2fwww.metropoles.com%2ftag%2flula/RK=2/RS=BYyRZbXx9QRPM_o2gTqGaip0IdE-) (PT) sancionou a lei que cria o [protocolo “Não é Não”](https://www.metropoles.com/sao-paulo/governo-de-sao-paulo-lanca-protocolo-contra-assedio-em-casas-noturnas). A publicação saiu na edição desta sexta-feira (29/12) do [Diário Oficial da União (DOU)](https://www.gov.br/pt-br/servicos/acessar-o-diario-oficial-da-uniao). O objetivo do protocolo é criar condições de atendimento das vítimas de assédio ou qualquer tipo de violência em locais onde seja vendidas bebidas alcóolicas. Isso vale para casas noturnas, boates, espetáculos musicais realizados em locais fechados e casas de show. As determinações não se aplicam a cultos nem a outros eventos realizados em locais de natureza religiosa. A lei entra em vigor no prazo de 180 dias (seis meses). A iniciativa é baseada na ação usada em Barcelona, na Espanha, com o nome de “No Callem”. A partir desse protocolo, [o jogador de futebol Daniel Alves acabou preso](https://www.metropoles.com/tag/daniel-alves), acusado de estuprar uma mulher em uma boate. Saiba como funciona lei do “Não é não” De acordo com o texto, esses estabelecimentos devem contar com uma pessoa qualificada para seguir o protocolo. Os contatos dessa pessoa, da Polícia Militar e da Central de Atendimento à Mulher (Ligue 180) devem estar facilmente visíveis aos frequentadores. Esse tipo de comércio também pode criar um código, a ser colocado nos sanitários femininos, para que as vítimas peçam socorro a funcionários. Os estabelecimentos devem: - Proteger a mulher e dar-lhe apoio; - Afastar a vítima do agressor, inclusive do seu alcance visual, facultando a ela acompanhamento de pessoa de sua escolha; - Colaborar para a identificação das possíveis testemunhas do fato; - Solicitar o comparecimento da Polícia Militar ou do agente público competente; e - Isolar o local específico onde existam vestígios da violência, até a chegada da Polícia Militar ou do agente público competente. Caso o local disponha de sistema de câmeras de segurança, deverá ser garantido o acesso às imagens pela Polícia Civil, pela perícia oficial e pelos diretamente envolvidos, preservando as imagens por um mínimo de 30 dias. O projeto que deu origem à lei é de autoria da deputada [Maria do Rosário](https://www.camara.leg.br/deputados/74398) (PT-RS) e mais 26 parlamentares, com relatoria da deputada [Renata Abreu](https://www.camara.leg.br/deputados/178989) (Podemos-SP). Em substitutivo, a relatora propôs que as exigências da norma não fossem aplicadas a locais religiosas, o que foi aprovado na versão final do texto. Um selo chamado “Não é Não – Mulheres Seguras” também está dentro do projeto. O Poder Público poderá conceder esse selo a estabelecimentos que cumpram o protocolo e possam ser classificados como local seguro para mulheres. O texto também observa quatro princípios: - Respeito ao relato da vítima sobre o constrangimento ou violência sofrida; - Preservação da dignidade, da honra, da intimidade e da integridade física e psicológica da vítima; - Celeridade no cumprimento do protocolo; e - Articulação de esforços públicos e privados para o enfrentamento ao constrangimento e à violência.",

    "title": "Why Supporting Small Batch Craft Weed Brands Matters This 4/20 | stupidDOPE",
    "text": "As 4/20 approaches, the cannabis world is gearing up for its biggest day of the year—sales, activations, and a flood of brand promotions across every platform. But behind all the flashy marketing campaigns and loud dispensary rollouts, there’s a more important conversation brewing: who are you really supporting when you buy weed this 4/20?\nIn an industry that’s still figuring itself out, small batch craft cannabis brands are fighting for survival—and your support could make all the difference. These are the people who grow, trim, and package with care. The ones who aren’t backed by billion-dollar hedge funds or global conglomerates. They’re Black-owned, woman-owned, veteran-owned, family-run, and community-driven. And unlike the big guys, they actually give a damn.\nThe Corporate Machine Has Entered the Chat\nLet’s be honest: the major players—Multi-State Operators (MSOs), Regional Operators (ROs), and their faceless house brands—are everywhere. They’re muscling into every market with slick packaging and low prices that often come at the cost of quality, ethics, and employee well-being.\nThese companies churn out weed like it’s fast fashion. Grown at scale, packaged in bulk, and sold as a commodity with no real story behind it. It’s weed made for margins, not for people. And in most cases, it smokes like it—dry, dull, and uninspired. If you’ve ever lit up something that looked good but hit like cardboard? That’s the corporate cannabis experience.\nOn the other side of that equation are small batch craft brands. These are producers who treat cannabis as an art form and a livelihood—not just a product to be scaled. They’re making careful decisions about genetics, cultivation practices, curing processes, and flavor profiles. And they’re doing it all while navigating impossible regulations, inconsistent supply chains, and razor-thin margins.\nWhy Small Batch Matters\nSupporting small batch cannabis isn’t just about charity—it’s about better weed. These brands aren’t chasing mass production. They’re obsessed with quality, effect, and consumer experience. Their batches are smaller because their standards are higher.\nWhen you buy from small producers, you’re also often getting:\n-\nProperly flushed and cured flower that burns clean\n-\nUnique genetics that aren’t part of a soulless house brand portfolio\n-\nReal terpene profiles that weren’t stripped out for the sake of volume\n-\nPeople behind the product who live in and support your community\nThis is the kind of weed that’s crafted—not manufactured. And you feel the difference every time you spark up.\nOwnership Still Matters in Cannabis\nDespite all the legalization wins over the last few years, cannabis is still overwhelmingly owned and controlled by people who weren’t harmed by prohibition. That needs to change.\nEvery time you choose a craft brand that’s Black-owned, veteran-owned, woman-owned, immigrant-owned, or family-run, you’re helping to shift the power dynamic in this industry. These operators usually don’t have the same access to capital, media, or shelf space—but they’re out here doing the hard work. They show up. They hire from within the community. They reinvest in their people.\nOwnership matters. Especially when the industry is being flooded with the same corporate actors who once lobbied to keep it illegal.\n4/20 Is the Perfect Time to Rethink Your Support\nIf you’re someone who really cares about cannabis—where it comes from, who grows it, how it’s treated—then 4/20 should be about more than catching a deal or grabbing a novelty item. It should be a moment of intention.\nAsk yourself:\n-\nWho’s getting your money?\n-\nAre they producing something meaningful?\n-\nAre they part of the solution or part of the problem?\nIf you want to support small batch, there are plenty of ways to do it this 4/20:\n-\nLook up the story behind the brand before buying\n-\nFollow independent growers and producers on social media\n-\nAttend community events and meet-the-maker sessions\n-\nAsk your local shop to carry more craft brands\n-\nTalk to your budtender about who’s actually making the products\n-\nShare the love. Word of mouth still matters\nAnd maybe most importantly—tip your budtender. They’re often the only connection between consumers and the people who actually make the product. A good budtender can steer someone toward a small batch brand just by sharing their knowledge. Appreciate that.\nStop Chasing Gimmicks. Start Backing Real Ones.\nThe cannabis industry is full of trends. Drinks are booming. Edibles are evolving. Vapes are everywhere. But through it all, the heart of this culture has always been the grower, the maker, the person who gives a damn about the plant.\nThis 4/20, skip the flashy promo drops and the house brand “discounts.” Look for the brands that are doing it for real—because they love the plant, not just the profit. The ones that are part of your community. The ones making small batches with big vision.\nThat’s how you keep cannabis from turning into just another soulless industry. That’s how you make your high mean something.\nThis 4/20, support people—not corporations.",

    "title": "Mum murdered three-year-old son after beating him with cane 'because bible said to'",
    "text": "A mother who beat her three-year-old son with a bamboo cane after claiming the Bible advised the use of the rod weeks before she murdered him has been jailed for life with a minimum term of 25 years. Christina Robinson, 30, had exposed her son Dwelaniyah to cruelty and excruciating pain over several weeks before she shook him to death at the family home in Durham in November 2022.\nMr Justice Garnham said she was guilty of a gross abuse of trust as the victim's mother. A trial at Newcastle Crown Court heard Robinson had deliberately immersed him in scalding water, causing severe burns that left him in agony.\nShe did not seek medical help as safeguarding concerns would have been obvious if a health worker saw him. Robinson, a member of the Black Hebrew Israelite religion, admitted hitting the boy with a bamboo cane but claimed she was following a Bible scripture which advised the use of the rod for the \"correction\" of children.\nThe defendant, originally from Tamworth, Staffordshire, and a mother-of-two at the time, was convicted of murder and four child cruelty charges which happened at the family home in Bracken Court, Ushaw Moor, following a trial in March. Robinson repeatedly left her children at home alone while she conducted an affair while her husband was away serving with the RAF.\nMr Justice Garnham found that Robinson immersed her son in extremely hot water, causing burns to his lower limbs which affected 20% of his body, after Dwelaniyah had soiled himself. The judge told her: \"You must have known the water was extremely hot, it must have been obvious.\"\nDespite the excruciating pain her son must have suffered in the days that followed, Robinson saw fit to cause further injury by beating him with a cane.\nThe judge said: \"You were a follower of a religious group known as the Black Hebrew Israelites and would listen to lectures or sermons from the group's speakers on YouTube. Mistakenly, as you subsequently admitted was the case, you took the teaching of that group to indicate it was appropriate to punish your children by beating them with a bamboo cane.\"\nHe added: \"These beatings were all administered as punishments for behaviour that was objectively trivial but which you considered worthy of severe punishment. What must have gone through the mind of this little boy, being beaten with a cane by his mother, despite these terrible burns, does not bear thinking about.\"\nAll the abuse happened when the little boy's father was several hundred miles away at an RAF base near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. The judge accepted that when she shook Dwelaniyah, causing fatal brain injuries, she did not intend to kill him.\nHe also rejected claims that she was motivated by sadism, saying there was no evidence she took pleasure from inflicting pain. But the judge said her mistreatment of Dwelaniyah in the last weeks of her son's life was \"appalling in the highest degree\".\nThat was reflected in messages she sent to her boyfriend saying Dwelaniyah deserved a \"major ass kicking\", that \"he's old enough to know better, so he'll pay\" and that \"he'll get what he deserves, no more, no less\". Robinson represented herself and continues to deny she killed her son, saying: \"I pray for the day when justice will be served.\"\nTen of the 12 jurors attended the sentencing, with one of them staring at the defendant intensely throughout the hearing.\nOutside court, Detective Chief Inspector Simon Turner said: \"Dwelaniyah was a defenceless little boy who had his life ahead of him, but this was cruelly taken away his own mother - someone he should have been able to trust, someone who should have cared about him.\n\"We may never know why or what caused Christina Robinson to do what she did. Her actions are unforgivable and sadly nothing will bring Dwelaniyah back but at least she is now facing the consequences of what she has done.\n\"This has been a truly heartbreaking and emotional case for everyone involved, including my investigation team, who have worked tirelessly to bring Robinson to justice. My thoughts remain with those who loved and cared about Dwelaniyah.\"",
