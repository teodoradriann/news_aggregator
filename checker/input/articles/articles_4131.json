    "title": "Régimen de Ortega sigue arremetiendo contra la Iglesia católica: tres sacerdotes detenidos en solo 24 horas",
    "text": "El sacerdote nicaragüense Fernando Calero fue detenido por la Policía, con lo que suman tres los curas encarcelados en las últimas 24 horas, denunció este viernes la abogada e investigadora nicaragüense exiliada Martha Patricia Molina.\n“Policía sandinista secuestra al sacerdote Fernando Calero, párroco de Nuestra Señora de Fátima (en el municipio de) Rancho Grande, (departamento de Matagalpa). Se desconoce su paradero”, señaló Molina, autora del estudio titulado ‘Nicaragua: ¿Una Iglesia perseguida?’, a través de su cuenta de la red social X (antes Twitter).\nSegún la investigadora, Calero fue “secuestrado por la Policía Nacional en su parroquia” tras haber mencionado al obispo encarcelado Rolando Álvarez, quien preside la Diócesis de Matagalpa, en una misa.\n“No existe una acusación formal en contra de él y no se tiene información de su paradero”, explicó.\nCalero se suma a los sacerdotes Carlos Avilés y Héctor Treminio, vicario general y tesorero de la Arquidiócesis de Managua, respectivamente, que fueron detenidos el jueves por la Policía y civiles.\nLa semana pasada, las autoridades detuvieron al obispo Isidoro Mora, a dos sacerdotes y a dos seminaristas.\nNi el Gobierno ni la Policía Nacional han confirmado o negado la presunta detención de los religiosos.\nEl cardenal nicaragüense y arzobispo de Managua, Leopoldo Brenes, aún no se pronuncia sobre esos arrestos.\nQuien sí lo hizo fue el exiliado obispo auxiliar de Managua, Silvio Báez, a quien el papa Francisco ordenó dejar Nicaragua en 2019 por motivos de seguridad, quien se declaró indignado por los encarcelamientos de tres sacerdotes de la Arquidiócesis de Managua.\nDos obispos, cinco sacerdotes y dos seminaristas presos\nEn el caso de Mora, obispo de la Diócesis de Siuna, en el Caribe de Nicaragua, fue arrestado un día después de mencionar en una homilía al obispo Rolando Álvarez, condenado en febrero pasado a más de 26 años de prisión por delitos considerados traición a la patria tras negarse a abandonar su país.\nMora es el segundo obispo detenido en Nicaragua. El primero fue Álvarez, quien el 10 de febrero pasado fue condenado a 26 años y 4 meses de prisión, despojado de su nacionalidad, y suspendidos sus derechos ciudadanos de por vida por delitos considerados traición a la patria.\nEsa condena fue dictada un día después de que Álvarez rechazó subirse a un avión que lo iba a llevar, junto con otros 222 excarcelados políticos nicaragüenses, hacia Estados Unidos, lo que provocó la indignación del presidente Ortega, quien en una cadena nacional lo calificó de “soberbio”, “desquiciado” y “energúmeno”.\nLas relaciones del Gobierno de Daniel Ortega y la Iglesia católica viven momentos de gran tensión, marcadas por la expulsión y encarcelamiento de sacerdotes, la prohibición de actividades religiosas y la suspensión de sus relaciones diplomáticas.\nEl Gobierno de Nicaragua excarceló en octubre pasado a 12 sacerdotes y los envió al Vaticano, aunque entre esos religiosos no se encontraba el obispo Álvarez.\nNicaragua atraviesa una crisis desde abril de 2018, que se ha acentuado tras las elecciones de noviembre de 2021, en las que Ortega fue reelegido para un quinto mandato, cuarto consecutivo y segundo junto a su esposa, Rosario Murillo, como vicepresidenta, con sus principales contendientes en prisión.\nEFE",

    "title": "You Can Get This $50 eSIM Card for $20 Right Now | Lifehacker",
    "text": "International travel is expensive enough before factoring in how much mobile carriers charge for data packages, but this aloSIM digital SIM card comes with $50 of data credits and is [on sale for $19.97 right now](https://shop.lifehacker.com/sales/alosim-mobile-data-traveler-lifetime-esim-credit-25-for-50?utm_source=lifehacker.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=alosim-mobile-data-traveler-lifetime-esim-credit-25-for-50&utm_term=scsf-584360&utm_content=a0xRn 3OXJIA2&scsonar=1) (reg. $50). aloSIM saves you the hassle of physical SIM cards; instead, you download the eSIM to your device and keep it forever. Just like regular SIM cards, this one will only work on one device, so if you also want data access on your laptop—or you eventually upgrade your phone—you’ll need a new eSIM. Once you download the eSIM, all you have to do is add a data package that meets your needs. There are over 170 locations available, and a variety of data allowances and time frames to choose from, so you can only pay for what you’re actually going to use. Data doesn’t rollover, though—any leftover data will disappear after the time stated at redemption. One crucial tip for using aloSIM, though: install your eSIM and activate data plans before you leave for your trip. Otherwise, you’ll be messing around with slow airport wifi and running into problems when you should be enjoying your vacation. You can get aloSIM with $50 in travel data credits [on sale for $19.97 right now](https://shop.lifehacker.com/sales/alosim-mobile-data-traveler-lifetime-esim-credit-25-for-50?utm_source=lifehacker.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=alosim-mobile-data-traveler-lifetime-esim-credit-25-for-50&utm_term=scsf-584360&utm_content=a0xRn 3OXJIA2&scsonar=1), though prices can change at any time.",

    "text": "VENTURA, Calif. -- Massive surf is bringing danger and destruction to California's coast.\nLarge waves pounded Southern California's shores on Thursday, leading to flooding on coastal communities and multiple rescues by lifeguards.\nRELATED:\n Visitors from all over the world flock to Mavericks Beach as surfers brave massive waves\nStreets along Ventura's beach communities were coping with several feet of water, leaving multiple vehicles stranded. Lifeguards had to perform multiple rescues, in most cases of people who had gathered to watch the big waves from the sand but were caught up unexpectedly in them, sweeping them off their feet.\nOne video showed bystanders pulling a lifeguard out of the water with his arms after he apparently became exhausted trying to fight the powerful tow.\nAnother video showed a massive rogue wave breaching a low wall in Ventura, sending onlookers fleeing and sweeping up several of them in water. Officials say eight people were treated at local hospitals for injuries.\nRogue wave sends people fleeing along Ventura shoreline\nIn another video, a man went paddleboarding with his daughter along a flooded street.\nPeople who live in affected communities can't recall seeing waves this size, at least in the recent past.\n\"The waves were big,\" said Ventura resident Brian Scott. \"I mean, I'm a water guy. I sail, scuba dive. These were 15+ foot waves this morning at high tide. Never seen that. We've been here for 10 years.\"\nWhy is Southern California seeing massive waves? Dallas Raines explains\nA high surf advisory went into effect at 4 a.m. Thursday and will last through 10 p.m. Saturday.\nThe National Weather Service says some local areas could see waves up to 15 feet high. The Ventura County coast, and Hermosa, Manhattan and Palos Verdes beaches are expected to see the most significant impacts.\nThe state's central coast is also expected to be hit hard.\nSeveral cars were seen stuck on a flooded street near the beach. Lifeguards were warning people who had gathered to watch the big waves that they needed to move farther back from the water.\nIn Oxnard, streets near the beach were similarly flooded and several cars were trapped as well. All Oxnard public beaches are closed Friday through Sunday due to the high surf advisory.\nOfficials say flooding is possible in some low-lying areas.\nIn Newport Beach, residents were warned about the conditions and sand berms were replenished.\nCity officials said crews would be monitoring water levels and will pump water out if needed.\nMeanwhile, Los Angeles County beachgoers are urged to speak with lifeguards before going into the water.\nDespite the advisory, many surfers turned out at Seal Beach ready to catch some waves early Thursday morning.\n\"Seal Beach is kind of like a stadium. Everyone like's to come here. It's a easy, makeable wave... and everyone loves to be pumped to be here,\" said Jeff Brockman.",

    "title": "Google AI bot tells user they’re a ‘drain on the Earth’ and begs them to ‘please die’ in disturbing outburst",
    "text": "GOOGLE'S AI chatbot, Gemini, has gone rogue and told a user to \"please die\" after a disturbing outburst.\nThe glitchy chatbot exploded at a user at the end of a seemingly normal conversation, that has now gone viral.\n\"This is for you, human. You and only you,\" the chatbot said in the manuscript.\n\"You are not special, you are not important, and you are not needed. You are a waste of time and resources.\n\"You are a burden on society. You are a drain on the earth. You are a blight on the landscape. You are a stain on the universe.\n\"Please die. Please.\"\nThe conversation has been backed up by chat logs - suggesting it was not fabricated.\nThe user, apparently a Redditor's brother, had been using Gemini to get more information on elder abuse for a school project.\nThe lengthy conversation appeared normal until the user asked Gemini about grandparent-headed households in the US.\nPotential explanations for the outburst have swirled online.\nMost read in Tech\nSome onlookers suggested that the user might have triggered a bizarre response by creating a new persona for Gemini.\nGoogle introduced a way for users to create custom personas for the chatbot in August.\nThese personalities, known as 'Gems', are designed to act differently to the 'typical' Gemini AI.\nOthers suggested that the user might have inserted and then hidden a message that triggered the over-the-top response.\nHowever, it's unclear how a user would execute that.\nIn a statement, Google did not suggest it was the users fault.\n\"Large language models can sometimes respond with non-sensical responses, and this is an example of that,\" a spokesperson said.\n\"This response violated our policies and we’ve taken action to prevent similar outputs from occurring.”\nWhat is Google Gemini?\nYou may have heard of Google's Gemini AI tool - so what exactly is it?\nGoogle's Gemini AI launched in December 2023 and is available online, billed as a way to \"supercharge your creativity and productivity\".\nGemini is a multimodal model that learns from a variety of data types including images, text, and audio.\nWhen a user enters a prompt into Gemini, it generates a response using information it already knows or pulls from other sources (often Google services).\nWhile training on datasets, it identifies patterns that help it mimic a human response. As it is continuously learning, Gemini also learns from your prompts, responses, and feedback.\nGoogle has admitted that \"Gemini will make mistakes and might even say something offensive\".\nThe program occasionally cites its sources. If it quotes at length from a webpage, for instance, it makes reference to that page. Sometimes, it generates a URL that users can click.\nGemini has usage limits to reduce traffic, meaning it may cap the number of prompts and conversations a user can have within a specific timeframe.\nThis number depends on factors like how long and complex a user's prompts are and the length of the conversation with Gemini. Google will alert you when you are close to hitting the limit for a given period.",
