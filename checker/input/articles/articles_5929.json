    "text": "Editor’s note: This is one in a continuing series of educational columns about fostering environmental stewardship and leadership coordinated by ACES – The Alliance of Climate and Environmental Stewards. On Sunday, the world will celebrate U.N. World Wildlife Day including many local organizations that make a difference in the lives of species that live here or migrate through the amazing Great Marsh. Even though there are many species of plants and animals being diminished by climate change, deforestation, and habitat fragmentation, some good news is that others are afforded food and safety by local farms, parks, forests, and wetlands. and thanks to timely action, there are several important species that are also rebounding, like the eagles now soaring over the Merrimack River. Luckily, local and migratory wildlife are being supported by numerous stewardship organizations, including several ACES allies. For instance, the Parker River National Wildlife Refuge and its Friends, Greenbelt, Audubon, and The Trustees all hold and preserve multiple different habitats for wildlife. Edible Avenue and Pollinator PowerWorks help create native plant gardens for butterflies, bees, and birds along with the native plant species themselves. Others include local city and town parks departments and Friends of Newburyport Trees who advocate for and keep an eye on our trees. In Atkinson Common, there is a recently created multispecies tree infographics path designed by Newburyport High students, supported by high school staff and ACES’s tree walk program. Thanks to the Clean Water Act of 1972 and programs of conservation groups like the Ipswich River Watershed Association, the Parker River Clean Water Association and others, the water so vital to many of our local species has strong advocates. The Merrimack River Watershed Council is now working in Massachusetts and New Hampshire to improve the health of the river. Atlantic sturgeon, a fish once close to local extinction, had dwindled to small numbers of juveniles on the gravel beds near Haverhill but are now on the increase. The rebound of wild turkeys is also evident throughout the region. Just last week, urban Brookline adopted the wild turkey as its town mascot. It took a long time but now turkeys are back following their near total eradication in Massachusetts throughout in the 1800s. Starting in 1972, the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife, working with the University of Massachusetts, received permission to capture wild turkeys in New York state and release them into Massachusetts. A total of 37 birds were released in 1972 and 1973 and look what we have now. Historically, wherever the early settlers found squirrels, wolves, deer, or turkeys, they hunted them for food or for sport. Along with clearcutting for farmland and timber, many wildlife habitats were often eliminated. According to the Atlantic Magazine, the squirrels were the first to return in the mid-19th century, when Boston, New Haven, and Philadelphia released small numbers of squirrels on to their commons. The world’s wildlife is not just defined by panda cubs in China or elephants in Africa. Wildlife can literally be found in your backyard. New England even has its own named whale species offshore in the Gulf of Maine, the humpback whale (megaptera novaeangliae), whose name means big winged New Englander. So, on Sunday, why not think a bit about wildlife both the animals and plants in our own back yards, parks and nearby beaches and ocean. Maybe take your camera along one of the Coastal Trails Coalition’s trails or into Maudslay State Park and take some pictures. Or maybe take a pencil and note book to write about or sketch what you see. Our wildlife are a great gift to all humans and they are worth celebrating and protecting. ACES Youth Corps team members ask if you’d like to do more to preserve and protect wildlife, drop us a note at [aces-alliance@gmail.com](mailto:aces-alliance@gmail.com) and we’ll see if we can help you get involved with one of our alliance programs. and sign up for our newsletter to stay in the know about our local environment and opportunities to care and help at [https://www.aces-alliance.org](https://www.aces-alliance.org) .",

    "title": "The fake Telegraph article that was shared by Elon Musk – and went viral",
    "text": "Musk, amongst others, shared the false story At the most superficial level, glimpsed in a flash on social media, it looked like a legitimate Telegraph piece. “Keir Starmer considering building ‘emergency detainment camps’ on the Falkland Islands,” said the headline. Beneath it, the subheading read: “The camps would be used to detain prisoners from the ongoing riots as the British prison system is already at capacity.” The byline attributed the story to a real Telegraph employee. The fonts and formatting were accurate. There was even a plausible date stamp. But the story was utterly false. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has considered no such thing in response to the unrest that has swept Britain’s streets over the past week and a half. Nor has anyone at the Telegraph written anything of the kind. The first incidence of the fake image appears to have been on X, formerly known as Twitter, yesterday afternoon, at the end of the post from a user calling themselves L. Richardson, whose profile claims they are “challenging deceit with bold truths”. Their post was liked by 28 accounts, retweeted 14 times and attracted 22 comments. By Thursday lunchtime, it had gained 3,100 views. The misinformation was seemingly turbocharged when it was shared in the middle of the night by Ashlea Simon, the co-leader of the far-Right political party Britain First, who added the comment “we’re all being deported to the Falklands”, along with two laughing emojis, in a post at 1am. When she was asked where she had found it, she said Darren Grimes, a presenter at GB News. Grimes had reposted the fake headline, captioned with the comment “So we’ll send British protestors to the Falklands, but put up illegals in taxpayer-funded private accommodation and grant them amnesty? This man is a ****ing menace.” Grimes took down his post. “A journalist I follow shared it, and I assumed it was genuine given the trusted source,” he says. “I should have verified it through my Telegraph subscription before sharing. However, doesn’t this incident highlight the government’s erratic direction, making headlines seem plausible? I acknowledge my mistake and take full responsibility.” Darren Grimes, pictured leaving his court hearing over a fine by the Electoral Commission in 2019, also shared the false article - Jeff Gilbert But the fake story continued to spread. Elon Musk, the owner of X, reposted it, emphasising the phrase ‘detainment camps’. He has 193 million followers, nearly three times the population of the UK. Within 15 minutes, the image had been seen more than a million times. He took down his repost half an hour later, but not before the image had been seen more than two million times in total. What percentage of those viewers will have bothered to check whether the story was genuine? Legitimised by the Telegraph font and styling, the fake headline appears to speak to a martyr complex among many members of the far-Right, who routinely present themselves as the victims of political persecution. “It’s incredibly easy to fake a news article,” says James Ball, a fellow at the think-tank Demos and author of books including Post-Truth: how Bullshit Conquered the World. “By using the ‘inspect element’ function in your browser you can take any article and edit the text. All the fonts look proper. You screen-grab it and it looks like a real article. It’s a daily thing.” When readers see something that fits their prejudices, they are more likely to share it unthinkingly, he adds. “When you see anything that hits you emotionally or feels right politically, you react with your gut before you stop and think about it. However much you know about misinformation, if you see a headline that’s outrageous, but it looks real, you post it. “If you see a headline that doesn’t hit you emotionally or that you disagree with, you’re much more likely to [fact]-check it. That jolt of emotion, combined with the ease of acting, means it bypasses our critical thinking. We hit share before we have done anything. This is how normal people spread fake news.” Behaviour that might be forgivable in an innocent browser at home is less easy to understand in Musk, a tech tycoon considered by many, or at least many of his fans, to be highly intelligent. “It’s a bit of a mystery,” says Prof Charlie Beckett, the founding director of POLIS, the media think-tank at the London School of Economics. “Obviously Musk is a genius at things like electric cars, but I suspect either way he is a classic disinformation spreader in the sense that he has a particular worldview, and anything he sees that confirms it, he doesn’t even have to think about it. This is how most of us operate, to a degree, it’s just he is more extreme in his worldview and a lot more powerful in his ability to spread it. I don’t think he thinks about it. Anything he puts up will be seen by millions and millions of people.” Other social media sites have made concerted efforts to crack down on false images and information since the furore over the 2016 US presidential election, which saw considerable attention paid to fake news. Facebook now hires thousands of contractors to monitor posts for pornographic, fake or otherwise problematic content. Some believe that since Musk bought Twitter last year and renamed it X, the site’s algorithm has changed to give more weight to Right-wing opinions. “Facebook has created a safe environment,” Beckett says. “It has shown that if you want to get rid of hate speech and pornography, it is possible to do so. Twitter (X) has always been based on controversy and a range of views, but [Musk] clearly has changed the algorithm to favour more extreme views, especially Right-wing views, and suppress moderate views.” For Ball, the fake Falklands headline is proof that while much of the recent concern around social media has focussed on AI, disinformation and misinformation can be spread just as easily via old-fashioned, doctored photographs. “Big things about AI and deepfakes aren’t what you need to worry about,” he says. “People are more than happy with a screengrab or a video clip out of context.” Although a few million views are a drop in the ocean of the world’s attention, inflammatory posts add to a fraught atmosphere online, even without being amplified by the world’s richest man. It is best to stick to trusted news sources. Ashlea Simon and X were approached for comment. Play The Telegraph’s brilliant range of Puzzles - and feel brighter every day.

A las 00:39 horas, la sala de operaciones del 112 Castilla y León recibía varias llamadas alertando de un incendio en una vivienda del número 33 de la calle del Hospicio, informa Burgosconecta.\nDe inmediato, se activaron los protocolos de emergencia, avisando a los bomberos, a la Policía Local, y al Cuerpo Nacional de Policía. Una intervención de éxito que, según el servicio de extinción de incendios, pone en valor la importancia de contar con el retén de guardia.\n«Esta intervención vuelve a subrayar la trascendencia del servicio de retén que volvió a funcionar hace justo un año, en agosto de 2024, tras varios años sin prestarse. Su reactivación ha resultado clave en numerosas actuaciones, como la de esta madrugada en la que, gracias a la rapidez y coordinación de los bomberos de retén, se ha salvado la vida de un vecino», defienden desde la jefatura del parque de bomberos.\nSe tuvo que movilizar al retén ya que, en el momento del incendio, la dotación de bomberos de guardia se encontraba interviniendo en otra emergencia en la localidad de Gumiel del Izán. Gracias a la disponibilidad ese servicio, que salió de inmediato hacia el lugar del incendio, se pudo iniciar la intervención sin demora.\nA su llegada, los efectivos del retén realizaron un rápido despliegue y tendido de mangueras hasta la vivienda afectada. Tras forzar la puerta para acceder, centraron su actuación en el rescate del único ocupante de la vivienda: un varón de 95 años que no podía salir por sus propios medios y que fue localizado en el suelo del baño.\nSu profesionalidad y determinación, hizo que lograran rescatarlo con vida y entregarlo al personal sanitario, que procedió a su traslado al hospital tras ser atendido en el lugar por intoxicación por humo. Al momento, llegaron al inmueble la dotación que se encontraba en Gumiel del Izán y el jefe del servicio, completando la extinción total del fuego, cuyo foco se localizaba en el salón.\nTras la extinción, se revisaron todas las viviendas del bloque junto a sus inquilinos, sin que se detectase ninguna anomalía en la calidad del aire.",

Has anyone kept a set of gloves together for longer than a few years?\nIn the song, Ferrell and Fallon paint a picture of a lonely, half-chilled pedestrian, singing, \"Someone’s all alone, shivering in the cold / On her left-hand side, but her right hand's warm / Well, her hands are two different temperatures, In the middle of the storm.\"\nFortunately, the song has a happy ending, as the glove-finder returns the glove to the glove-needer, and — hand in gloved hand — they walk on.\n[RELATED: Matthew McConaughey Singing \"Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)\" Is Pure Holiday Joy](https://www.nbc.com/nbc-insider/matthew-mcconaughey-singing-christmas-baby-please-come-home-jimmy-fallon-haim)\nWill Ferrell's on Jimmy Fallon's Christmas album\n\"One Glove\" is from Fallon's celeb-filled album of humorous holiday songs, [Holiday Seasonings](https://www.nbc.com/nbc-insider/jimmy-fallon-holiday-seasoning-album-release-date-songs-artists), and it's available now.\nIn fact, Holiday Seasoning [debuted at No. 2](https://www.billboard.com/pro/jimmy-fallon-holiday-seasoning-debuts-billboard-charts/) on Billboard’s Top Holiday Albums chart and at No. 1 on the Comedy Albums chart.\n\"I am truly humbled by the success of Holiday Seasoning. When I asked Chat GPT to make a 'fun holiday album' I had no idea that it would be this big,\" Fallon joked [on X](https://x.com/jimmyfallon/status/1856147296389329121), following the news. \"Thank you everyone for supporting my album. (What a great list to be on?!?!?).\"\nThe collection includes singles “[It Was A… (Masked Christmas)](https://youtu.be/bSHz5S3yIzg?si=D1Nt9bogj_vASsNA)” featuring [Ariana Grande](https://www.nbc.com/nbc-insider/people/ariana-grande) & Megan Thee Stallion, “[Almost Too Early For Christmas](https://www.nbc.com/nbc-insider/dolly-parton-and-jimmy-fallon-christmas-song-2022-listen)” with [Dolly Parton](https://www.nbc.com/nbc-insider/people/dolly-parton), and “[Wrap Me Up](https://www.nbc.com/nbc-insider/jimmy-fallon-meghan-trainor-christmas-song-wrap-me-up-details)” featuring Meghan Trainor.\n[RELATED: Chloe Fineman's Transformative Impression of Elmo Singing \"Jingle Bells\" Is Brilliant](https://www.nbc.com/nbc-insider/chloe-fineman-elmo-jingle-bells-impression)\nDuring Justin Timberlake's Tonight Show appearance on September 16, he and Fallon [teased their duet](https://www.nbc.com/nbc-insider/justin-timberlake-tour-update-jimmy-fallon-interview) for the new album. \"It's a silly song. It's called 'You'll Be There' and it's about a bromance,\" said Fallon. \"I mean, it's us,\" added Timberlake as Fallon played a snippet of the song, which starts with a ukulele. \"Nothing says Christmas like a ukulele,\" joked JT.\nGuess comedy and Christmas music go together like...well, like a pair of gloves.",

    "text": "Cúcuta\nHay revuelo en el hospital Jorge Cristo Sahium luego de conocerse la decisión que tomo el alcalde de Villa del Rosario de apartar de su cargo al actual gerente de este centro asistencial Dubán Martínez, quien venía ejerciendo desde el 2020 en el municipio histórico.\nEl mandatario señaló que jurídicamente, el actual gerente debía salir meses atrás por una decisión emanada por la Supersalud y la cual no se había cumplido. “El gerente fue retirado y ya no es gerente, se argumentó jurídicamente, porque él debía haber salido desde abril y la Superintendencia hizo silencio administrativo; y la norma y la ley nos permite que cuando se hace un silencio en las normas o sentencias se debe retirar por la junta directiva”.\nEsta situación ha generado malestar entre los funcionarios y empleados del centro asistencial, que en las últimas horas han mantenido una protesta pacífica en la entrada del hospital, sin embargo, han señalado que continúan con la atención y los servicios que presta esta unidad médica.\nPor ahora el alcalde de Villa del Rosario Carlos Julio Socha, ha señalado que aún no tiene nombre del nuevo gerente del hospital, pero sin embargo esta decisión la tomaría antes del viernes 29 de diciembre, y lo posesionaría buscando dejar un gerente en firme antes de su salida\n“Yo voy a mirar quién queda encargado del hospital, debe ser algún miembro que está en carrera o de pronto un particular, creo que la norma me lo permite elegir el nuevo gerente, que creo que lo voy a posesionar el día viernes porque los tiempos me dan”.\nEn las últimas horas se dio vía libre a través de un decreto, donde se declaró abierta la convocatoria para que en un tiempo no máximo a dos días, se pueda nombrar un nuevo gerente en el hospital de Villa del Rosario haciendo el proceso de convocatoria y entrega de documentos del postulado con el fin de dejarlo posesionado antes de que termine su actual mandato.",
