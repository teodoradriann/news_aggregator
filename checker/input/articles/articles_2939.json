    "title": "Why Britain is the place to invest in 2024: Experts tip 'screamingly cheap' UK stocks",
    "text": "Have you heard about the 3D reset? Do you know which stock market is ‘screamingly cheap’? Does a nation’s debt-to-GDP ratio loom large in your stock-picking strategy? If you have resolved to take a cold hard look at your portfolio in the new year, these are themes tipped to determine the direction of markets in 2024. There may be more heartening news about inflation and interest rates. But some analysts argue that economies have yet to feel the full impact of the higher borrowing costs imposed in 2023 – meaning that recession may be still be a threat in Britain and America. Against this background, it may be tempting to wait for the all-clear signal. But, as James Thomson of Rathbones points out, ‘that will never come, and often the best returns come when you least expect them.’ If you believe that fortune favours the brave, these are the themes that you cannot afford to ignore in 2024. Bargain Britain: The FTSE All Share index has risen by just 1.7% over the past 12 months but many experts say UK stocks are currently undervalued Alex Tedder and Tom Wilson, the global and emerging strategists at Schroders, say investors should be aware of what they call the ‘3D reset’ which will increasingly influence the mood of stock markets. This is made up of three factors: demographic constraints; decarbonisation imperatives and deglobalisation initiatives. These have created supply bottlenecks, driven up wage costs, boosted inflation and underpinned populism. In the face of these challenges, investors would be well advised to change their mindset, focusing more on diversification in particular, rather than relying on US tech that dominates many portfolios. Tedder and Wilson do not suggest that you bid farewell to the US in 2024, since ‘its corporate sector remains, in aggregate, better managed and more innovative than pretty much any other.’ But they do recommend that you explore unloved markets, such as Japan and the UK. Diversification is difficult, but Russ Mould of AJ Bell says that paying attention to certain themes can help you determine ‘which way the wind is blowing’ and to re-align your portfolio. In 2024, analysts will, as always, be carefully monitoring the prices of oil and of copper – ‘a reliable indicator of global economic health due to its many uses.’ But they will also be keeping a close eye on an ever-more important metric – a country’s debt-to-GDP. If this ratio approaches 20 per cent, this should serve as an alert. China and France are already in this position, but America’s $1 trillion-a-year spending is bringing it into the danger zone. US markets are pricing in five rate cuts in 2024. Mould argues that, if these cuts fail to materialise, this could imperil the $11.8 trillion combined market capitalisation of the Magnificent Seven. Mould also cites another key theme: the yield curve for government bonds which reflects the market sentiment about risk. The yield curve is ‘inverted’, that is the yields on ten-year UK gilt-edged stocks and US bonds are lower than those on two-year bonds. The reverse should be the case with longer-term bonds offering a higher yield, as compensation for the possibility that catastrophe could arise at some point in their longer lifespan. Investing legend: Warren Buffett American markets have flourished in 2023, ending the year in style with the three major indices – the Dow Jones, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq – rising for seven straight weeks. Boosting share prices has been the hope that interest rates will move downward in 2024. There are also hopes that the Magnificent Seven tech stocks will continue to flourish, as the artificial intelligence boom continues to gather strength. But the analysts at UBS are also tipping Boeing, Coca-Cola, Domino’s Pizza, Merck, Visa and Ulta Beauty, amid the belief that the search for beauty is a theme in any year. Another enduring theme is never betting against America – which has sustained billionaire Warren Buffett, pictured, for more than six decades. Mould suggests that you watch wage settlements, given their impact on inflation. The Bank of England is predicted to cut interest rates early in the new year, following the surprise drop in the inflation rate to 3.9 per cent. But the Bank seems unwilling to make a move until pay rises moderate. These issues mean that you will hear many analysts talk about ‘a scarcity of certainty’. But this is likely to raise the profile of what Thomson calls ‘recession-resistant stocks that can survive in any economic cycle.’ He includes in this category such diverse companies as discount retailer Costco, with its loyal and growing client base and Hermes, maker of exclusive handbags. Diversification involves embracing the high and the low. Experts are declaring that the UK is the place to invest in 2024. This claim will be greeted with some cynicism by those who backed Britain in 2023 and were sorely disappointed. The FTSE All Share index has risen by just 1.7 per cent over the past 12 months which looks distinctly unimpressive compared with the 24.6 per cent increase in the irrepressible S&P 500. But the conviction remains that the UK is ‘screamingly cheap’, according to Matthew Bennison, of Schroder Income Growth fund. He is boosting his British holdings, taking the view that they will fare well over a three-year horizon. Simon Gergel, manager of the Merchants investment trust, also contends that Britain is a bargain, saying that investors pay £10 for every pound of profit in the UK compared with $20 for every dollar of profit in the US. The belief that British business is on offer at a discount lies behind the continuing wave of foreign takeovers of UK companies. Last month the mighty Mars corporation gobbled up Hotel Chocolat, maker of the Sleekster and other indulgences, in a £524million deal. News of the takeover sent Hotel Chocolat shares soaring by 160 per cent. This underlines the gap between our perception of our home-grown firms and the view in some quarters of Wall Street that they are the equivalent of a Sleekster chocolate box at the price of a Milk Tray selection. However Pimco, the biggest US name in corporate bond, is betting that the UK is headed for a hard landing triggered by a delayed consumer reaction to higher interest rates. And angst over the outcome of Brexit lies behind the undervaluation of UK shares. Some will still conclude the UK is cheap for a reason. But this could prove short-sighted when analysts at the US broker Jefferies are tipping Prudential and Standard Chartered as the shares to watch in 2024, forecasting that they could grow by 105 per cent and 70 per cent respectively. Mould is tipping GSK, the pharma giant (for the cautious) Legal & General (a balanced pick), Ashmore, the equipment supplier (a more adventurous selection) and insurance broker Lancashire (for income).",

    "title": "MORGAN MURPHY: JD Vance Is Right: It’s Time To Stop Libs From Brainwashing Our Kids Into Becoming Little Marxists | The Daily Caller",
    "text": "Republican Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio described the not-so-secret agenda of America’s radical left : “And so there’s this weird way where they want to take our kids and brainwash them so that their ideas continue to exist in the next generation.”\nPredictably, in near unison, America’s media establishment tried to play the Uno reverse card, crying: “ He’s weird !” The media chose ad hominem attacks rather than an even cursory look at the policies that Vance and many other parents find objectionable.\nFlack is always heaviest when you’re over the target: Vance is right. The left is indeed trying to brainwash our children. Worse, the far left wants to take our children. President Joe Biden said it clearly , claiming there’s “no such thing as someone else’s child. Our nation’s children are all our children.”\nTo conservative ears, the president’s words echo another socialist bent on committing youth to the state. “When an opponent declares, ‘I will not come over to your side,’ I calmly say, ‘Your child belongs to us already… What are you? You will pass on. Your descendants, however, now stand in the new camp. In a short time, they will know nothing else but this new community.’”\nAdolf Hitler knew well that socialism, above all else, needed to capture the minds of the youth. In a socialist society, children logically and morally belong to the state, as community outranks the rights of the individual. The Holocaust Encyclopedia lists the myriad ways in which the Third Reich indoctrinated German children through toys, books, board games and education. The indoctrination increased as the child aged, with the ultimate goal to create the Wermacht’s storm troopers.\nSimilarly, America’s pathway to leftist nirvana begins with gender-neutral infant toys at Target, carries on to showing preschoolers how to apply makeup to their fathers on Blue’s Clues , and debates critical race theory, transgender bathrooms, sex ed and males competing in women’s athletics while U.S. reading and math scores plummet. This year, we have all seen on elite college campuses what happens by the time these indoctrinated children reach young adulthood.\nUnder this onslaught, pillars of American culture are crumbling as conservative American families choose to leave liberal mainline churches , jettison the Boy Scouts and opt for home schooling . Many conservatives simply retreat rather than fight woke ministers, scout masters and school officials.\nYet, some Americans cannot retreat: our military. A recent report from government watchdog OpentheBooks reveals how the left is attempting to infiltrate the school systems that teach our service member’s children. With 161 schools, the Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) is responsible for the education of 66,000 schoolchildren worldwide. Under the Biden administration, the DoDEA has taken a sharp left turn.\nLast week, Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York and Republican House Military Personnel Subcommittee Chairman Jim Banks of Indiana, fired off a letter to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. The pair lambasted Austin for allowing DoDEA to promote sexually explicit content to children, furnish training aimed to get children to cry and advance classroom materials to turn students into radical activists.\n“This is inherently in opposition to the selfless choice our service members make to serve, protect, and defend the United States of America,” the letter said.\nThis is not the first time Republicans have tried to cut DEI out of the DoD education system. Last year, Stefanik included a parent’s bill of rights into the National Defense Authorization Act for 2024. Republican House Armed Services Chairman Mike Rogers of Alabama took the DoDEA’s diversity, equity and inclusion chief, Kelisa Wing, to task for tweets such as: “Where can I get a break from white nonsense for a while?”\nAs Stefanik proved with her blistering questioning of the university presidents of Harvard, Yale and M.I.T., conservatives who engage and fight leftist indoctrination can win.\nIt’s time that other conservatives step up and put a stop to the radical indoctrination of our service member’s children.\nMorgan Murphy is a former DoD press secretary, national security adviser in the U.S. Senate, a veteran of Afghanistan.\nThe views and opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author and do not reflect the official position of the Daily Caller News Foundation.\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

    "text": "BOEING HUELGA Los trabajadores de Boeing acuerdan ir a la huelga, la primera en 16 años Los trabajadores de Boeing han decidido, después de semanas de negociaciones, ir a una huelga tras rechazar el acuerdo entre los sindicatos y el fabricante estadounidense de aviones, que contemplaba un incremento general de los salarios del 25 % en cuatros años y que consideran insuficiente. Sería la primera huelga de la empresa en 16 años. La anterior fue en 2008 y tuvo un seguimiento de más de 50 días que paralizó la producción y le costó a Boeing unos 100 millones de dólares por día, según señalan medios estadounidenses como WSJ y FT. En concreto, cerca del 95 % de los miembros del sindicato International Association of Machinist (IAM, por sus siglas en inglés) ha votado en contra del acuerdo que incluía el citado incremento salarial hasta 2027. En este sentido, señalan que los aumentos salariales propuestos son escasos tras una década de estancamiento salarial y a tenor del aumento del coste de la vida. Esta huelga detendrá la producción de aviones de Boeing, en un momento en el que la compañía arrastra problemas tras el incidente del avión Boeing 737 MAX 9 de Alaska Airlines en pleno vuelo, y acentuará la falta de aviones en el sector aéreo. En el marco de las negociaciones, el reciente director ejecutivo de Boeing, Kelly Ortberg, había pedido a los trabajadores que no hiciera huelga y realizó algunas visitas a las fábricas. Los miembros del Distrito 751 de la IAM representa a unos 33.000 trabajadores de Boeing.",

    "title": "Florida priest charged for biting arm of woman he says was desecrating Eucharist",
    "text": "A priest in Florida bit the forearm of a woman he says was desecrating the Eucharist in a Communion line at church this past Sunday and has now been charged with one count of battery.\nFather Fidel Rodriguez, 66, admitted to police that he bit the woman but said he did so only after she reached into the ciborium and tried to grab a host from it, damaging other hosts as she did so.\n“The only defense that I found to defend something that for us, for all of us, is sacred, was biting her. I have recognized that I bite her. I’m not denying that,” Rodriguez told police, according to body camera video obtained by CNA.\n“I recognize that I bite her, as a defense, and as defending myself and defending the sacrament,” he said in English with a Spanish accent.\nThe woman told police the priest denied her Communion after she refused to answer his questions about whether she had been to confession recently.\n“I just wanted a cookie. That’s all,” the woman told police, according to body camera video.\nFirefighters treated the arm of the woman at the police station. She refused to go to a hospital, according to police video.\nPolice in St. Cloud, Florida, have charged Rodriguez with one count of battery stemming from the incident, which occurred during the noon Mass at St. Thomas Aquinas Church.\nSt. Cloud is a city of about 65,000 located about 21 miles south of Orlando. First Communion leads to scenes\nThe woman told police she went to the 10 a.m. Mass on Sunday, May 19, with her same-sex partner because it was the woman’s niece’s first Communion.\nThe parish’s video of the 10 a.m. Mass shows an interaction between the priest and the woman, who neither presents her hands to receive the host nor opens her mouth to receive on her tongue. The priest and the woman speak for about 45 seconds, holding up the Communion line, though their conversation can’t be heard over the music and singing.\nThe woman later told police she suspected the priest wouldn’t give her Communion because of the way she was dressed and because of her sexual orientation.\n“I believe that his excuse was that I wasn’t super-holy, in his eyes,” the woman, who was wearing a white shirt and pants, told police.\nBut the priest told police sexual orientation had nothing to do with it.\nWhen the woman didn’t hold her hands out one on top of the other or open her mouth and didn’t say “Amen” after he said “body of Christ,” he said, he knew she didn’t know what she was doing.\nHe said he asked her when the last time she received Communion was, and that she said it was many years ago. He said he asked her if she had gone to confession, and she replied, “I don’t need to explain you that.”\nHe said he told her that he has the authority to ask her that question and that he could not give her Communion, but he could give her a blessing instead, which he said he did. Second Mass\nThe woman and her partner then went to the noon Mass in Spanish, which Rodriguez celebrated, and the woman again went to him to receive Communion.\nHe told police he asked her if she had gone to confession in between Masses.\nAccording to him, she replied: “No, I don’t need to explain to you, I don’t need to give an explanation, you don’t have authority, you don’t need to judge me.”\nTo which he says he said: “I’m not judging you, I’m asking you only, did you confess after the other Mass [to] received the Communion now? Because if you did not confess, I can’t give you the Communion.”\n“And she grabbed all the hosts in the hands, because she wants to receive for herself. She is not permitted. And she break all the hosts, spreading them,” the priest said. The priest said he was worried that she would spill the hosts on the floor.\nThe Catholic Church teaches that the Eucharist is the actual body and blood of Jesus, whom Catholics worship as God. The Church also teaches that to receive Communion a person must be a Catholic in a state of grace, meaning not being mindful of having committed a serious sin without getting absolution from a priest in confession.\nThe woman told police that during the second Mass the priest “forced it in my mouth,” which she didn’t want.\n“He wouldn’t give me a cookie. I don’t know if it was how I’m dressed. You know, what it is that I like,” the woman said. “He said basically I needed to do confession and do all of this, I need to go to Mass every Sunday or whatever. And I said, ‘That doesn’t matter. I’ve done everything I needed to do as a kid. I’m just here to accept the bread.’ And he wouldn’t give it to me.”\n“And I’m not gonna front. I tried to just grab another cookie, and that when he grabbed my hand and he just bit me,” the woman said.\nVideo of the incident published by WFTV Channel 9 in Orlando shows the woman’s hand in the ciborium, which is the bowl that holds Communion wafers, while the priest holds onto it with both hands. It also shows the priest moving his head down toward the woman’s right arm but does not show the actual bite. Trending 1 Prominent Jesuit: The Society of Jesus is in ‘profound decline’ 2 Pope Francis paves the way for the canonization of new saints with zeal for mission work 3 Hundreds brave extreme heat to accompany the Eucharistic Lord in south Texas 4 Why the feast of Mary, Help of Christians is a special day for Catholics in China 5 Survey: Pro-abortion laws ascendant globally\nThe Diocese of Orlando released a statement Thursday supporting the priest’s efforts to defend the Eucharist while not endorsing the bite.\nThe statement notes that during the noon Mass the priest offered the woman Communion on the tongue.\n“At that point, the woman forcefully placed her hand in the vessel and grabbed some sacred Communion hosts, crushing them. Having only one hand free, Father Rodriguez struggled to restrain the woman as she refused to let go of the hosts. When the woman pushed him and reacting to a perceived act of aggression, Father Rodriguez bit her hand so she would let go of the hosts she grabbed. The woman was immediately asked to leave,” the diocese said in a written statement.\n“It should be noted Father Rodriguez had no prior knowledge of the woman’s background. Further, while the Diocese of Orlando does not condone physical altercations such as this, in good faith, Father Rodriguez was simply attempting to prevent an act of desecration of the holy Communion, which, as a priest, Father Rodriguez is bound by duty to protect,” the diocese said.\nThe statement continues:\n“The full video and the police report show the woman initiated physical contact and acted inappropriately. The priest was trying to protect the holy Communion from this sacrilegious act.\n“In the Catholic tradition, the Eucharist is considered ‘the source and summit’ of worship and faith. The act of participation in holy Communion therefore calls for a proper understanding, reverence, and devotion. It is not something a person can arbitrarily demand and is certainly not a mere ‘cookie’ as the complainant called it.”\nA police spokesman told CNA on Thursday that the state attorney’s office will determine the next steps in the case.\nRodriguez did not respond to a request from CNA for comment.",

    "text": "Independent TTRPG designer Graham Gentz has released a new project. The game, Breaking The Vault of Viditya Voleti, is an experience about groups of criminals, doomed heists, and character development through adversity. Furthermore, the game's sales will go towards assisting trans youth.\nBreaking The Vault of Viditya Voleti on Itch\nAs described on its [Itch page](https://grahamgentz.itch.io/breaking-the-vault-of-viditya-voleti), Breaking The Vault of Viditya Voleti is a nonlinear collaborative game where your group becomes a team of criminals on a heist that goes wrong.\nThe group decides on the setting of the heist and their final goal. That goal can be assassination, rescuing a prisoner, or sabotaging a doomsday weapon. The setting can be in Ancient China, World War 2, or even in a dieselpunk fantasy setting. Either way, the group is given an ultimatum and most fulfill their mission.\nAs the game progresses, character and context is revealed, culminating in a death scene where the group succeeds thanks to one character's sacrifice. The players themselves must decide if this act of selflessness was out of genuine character growth or not. To quote the game's description, \"You are not a good person, but will you die that way?\"\nBreaking The Vault of Viditya Voleti may be a reference or homage to another indie designer in the space. The titular Viditya Voleti has a distinct body of work, producing system-agnostic fantasy work as well as the competitive card game The Anatomy of Fear.\nThe author, Graham Gentz, has similarly eclectic work, including Immortal Lich Henry Kissinger, Aggressively Strange: Sailing The Spooky Wildsea, and [Under The Autumn Strangely](https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interview/under-autumn-strangely-pastoral-horror-and-shared-stories).\nLastly, 100% of all sales of Breaking The Vault of Viditya Voleti will go to the [Trans Youth Emergency Project](https://southernequality.org/tyep/). This nonprofit organization provides logistical and financial support for transgender youth throughout the American South. This includes travel expenses, medication, as well as mental health and wellness needs.\nThe game is available now in PDF format for as little as $6.",

    "text": "More than a year after Eddie the Pig was killed on Maui, a second hunter is sentenced for the crime.\nBefore his sentencing, 21 year old Krys-Ryan Saito Carino issued a short apology in court, \"I'm sorry for my actions, I'm sorry.\"\nIn may of last year, his actions involved breaking into Eddie's pen at Kitty Charm Farm Sanctuary, where the 250 pound pig was a pet.\nThen Saito Carino, along with Jayden Jarnesky-Magana stabbed, then tied up and dragged off Eddie, before killing him and using the dead pet to win a feral pig hunting contest.\n\"Mr. Saito Carino, you know that having grown up as a hunter, you were not hunting that day you stole and brutally killed a pet pig. And so there has to be punishment for that to reflect the seriousness of the crime and also to promote respect for the law,\" said Judge Kirstin Hamman.\nHis attorney asked for leniency and no permanent record.\n\"He is an emerging adult. He did not make good decisions that day. He and Jayden, together chose to do what they did, and they made the wrong call,\" said Deputy Public Defender Danielle Laaana Sears.\n\"What this defendant did is inexcusable and inhumane. In conclusion, Judge, this defendant's actions, premeditation, lies, fraud and lack of humanity requires that he suffer a permanent conviction on his record,\" countered Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Mica Metter.\nSaito Carino received a stiffer sentence than his co-conspirator with five days in jail and a deferred sentence - which means he has to follow rules during four years of probation to keep the crime off his permanent record.\n\"Right now, the precedent is set that if you break onto somebody's property, destroy their property, then steal and kill their pets, and do all of the things that happened...you're going to get probation,\" said Sarah Haynes, the President of Kitty Charm Farm Sanctuary.\nHaynes, is disappointed the sentence sends a message that Hawaii is not tough on crime, especially animal crime.\n\"You know, this was pre-planned. This was a premeditated, prolonged torture of an animal. He videoed it. He put it on Instagram. This was no accident. This was no tripping across a pig out in the jungle.\nThey knew. This person's father lives bordering my property, I can see his roof from my pig pen,\" added Haynes.\nWhile this criminal case is over, Eddie the Pig may still get his day in court\n\"If I had felt the sentence was appropriate, I would not be considering a civil case,\" stated Haynes.\nYears ago, Eddie came to Kitty Charm Farm as a piglet with rope burns and scars, after supposedly being used to train hunting dogs.\nHe grew into a part of Sarah's family, even nurturing and protecting other young feral pigs who later joined the farm.\nNow Haynes would like Eddie's legacy to continue helping other pets, by re-writing our current laws so there are stronger punishments for crimes against animals.\n\"I feel so bad because I taught Eddie that humans were okay. You know, he was terrified of humans when I first got him, and I taught him that humans were okay. Then they hog tied him, stabbed him and dragged him away. He stayed alive for a long time before they killed him,\" added Haynes.",

    "text": "29/12/2023 - 10:03\nA taxa de desocupação no trimestre encerrado em novembro foi de 7,5%. É o menor índice desde fevereiro de 2015. Especificamente para trimestres terminados em novembro, o índice é o menor desde 2014, quando alcançou 6,6%.\nOs dados fazem parte da Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domicílios Contínua (Pnad Contínua), divulgada nesta sexta-feira (29) pelo Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (IBGE).\nNotícias relacionadas:\nCaged: país gerou mais de 130 mil novas vagas de trabalho em novembro. Haddad anuncia medidas de arrecadação com reoneração gradual da folha . Bares e restaurantes têm dificuldades na hora de contratar empregados.\nNo trimestre encerrado em agosto, a taxa estava em 7,8%. Já o indicador do trimestre encerrado em agosto de 2022 era de 8,1%.\nO resultado foi influenciado pelo número de pessoas ocupadas, estimado em 100,5 milhões, o maior desde que a série histórica foi iniciada, em 2012. O número representa crescimento de 0,9% em 3 meses.\nO número de desempregados ficou estável, 8,2 milhões de pessoas. É o menor contingente desde o trimestre encerrado em abril de 2015, quando havia 8,15 milhões de brasileiros procurando trabalho.\nOcupação\nA proporção de pessoas ocupadas na população em idade de trabalhar subiu 0,4 ponto percentual (p.p.) ante o trimestre móvel anterior, alcançando 57%. Das 853 mil pessoas incluídas nesse universo, a maioria, 515 mil, foi contratada com carteira assinada.\nCom esse reforço, o contingente de trabalhadores com carteira assinada soma 37,7 milhões, o segundo maior patamar da série histórica, perdendo apenas para o trimestre encerrado em junho de 2014, quando eram 37,8 milhões.\nO número de empregados sem carteira foi de 13,4 milhões. Apesar de ter ficado estável no período, é o maior da série histórica.\nDas dez atividades econômicas analisadas pelo IBGE, houve aumento no número de ocupados apenas na indústria, 369 mil pessoas, e na construção, 199 mil. As demais atividades permaneceram estáveis.\n“A expansão da atividade de construção ocorreu principalmente por meio da informalidade, com o aumento do emprego sem carteira assinada e por conta própria sem CNPJ, enquanto a indústria impulsionou os trabalhos formais”, disse a coordenadora de Pnad do IBGE, Adriana Beringuy.\nNo trimestre, a taxa de informalidade foi de 39,2% da população ocupada, o que representa 39,4 milhões de trabalhadores informais. Nos três meses anteriores, a taxa tinha sido 39,1%.\nRendimento\nO rendimento médio real do trabalhador chegou a R$ 3.034, aumento de 2,3% no trimestre. Em relação ao ano passado, a alta foi de 3,8%. No trimestre, esse crescimento foi mais acentuado entre os empregados com carteira assinada no setor privado (2,1%) e os trabalhadores por conta própria com CNPJ (7,6%).\n“Na comparação anual, nenhuma forma de inserção apresentou queda no rendimento, seja no trabalho formal, seja no informal. Todos registraram variação positiva”, ressalta a pesquisadora do IBGE.\nA pesquisa do IBGE é feita com uma amostragem de 211 mil domicílios em todo o país e busca informações sobre qualquer forma de trabalho, como contratados com carteira assinada, por conta própria e informais.\nCaged\nOutra estatística de referência sobre o mercado de trabalho é o Cadastro Geral de Empregados e Desempregados (Caged), compilado pelo Ministério do Trabalho e Emprego, que coleta dados apenas de admissões e demissões de trabalhadores com carteira de trabalho.\nA mais recente divulgação, nesta quinta-feira (28), apontou que novembro teve um saldo positivo de mais de 130 mil vagas. No acumulado de janeiro a novembro foram gerados no país 1.914.467 postos de trabalho.",
