    "title": "unlocking the Potential of Assisted Stretching in Traditional Medical Care – Healthcare Business Today",
    "text": "Assisted stretching is a wellness concept that has been gaining popularity in recent years. It involves the use of a trainer to aid individuals in enhancing muscle flexibility and expanding their range of motion through stretching their muscles. [Projections](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/03/11/health/assisted-stretching-improve-flexibility-wellness/index.html) indicate substantial growth in the global stretching machines market, with an expected value of nearly $1 billion by 2027. The market is set to grow at an annual rate of 4.7% from 2020 to 2027, underscoring an increasing awareness of and appreciation for the advantages associated with consistent stretching and flexibility training. This heightened demand reflects a broader acknowledgment of the integral role these practices play in overall well-being. Why Do We Need to Stretch? Maintaining muscle flexibility, strength, and overall health through regular stretching is crucial for preserving musculoskeletal mobility. When muscles lack flexibility, they tend to shorten and tighten, resulting in weakness and an inability to fully extend during physical activity. This increases the risk of joint pain, strains, and muscle damage. The [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2016/16_0263.htm) (CDC) estimates that on average, Americans spend over half (55%) of their day sitting down. Prolonged periods of sitting, such as in a chair all day or on a couch, can lead to tight leg muscles, restricting leg extension and hindering proper knee movement, which can lead to impaired walking. When tight muscles are suddenly subjected to high-impact activities like running or weight lifting, abrupt stretching can cause damage and injured muscles may not provide adequate joint support, heightening the risk of joint injuries. That’s why consistent stretching, coincided with regular exercise, is key to promoting healthy and flexible muscles, preventing excessive force on the muscles during exertion. The Cooperative Relationship Between Wellness Concepts and Medical Practices The relationship between wellness concepts, such as assisted stretching, and medical practices being symbiotic is becoming increasingly apparent. More and more people are recognizing the importance of preventative healthcare practices and are willing to invest in services that contribute to their overall well-being. As this trend continues, it is likely that the healthcare landscape will witness an increase in the number of medical professionals who are leveraging their expertise to introduce innovative wellness solutions within their communities. The evolving paradigm underscores a collective recognition of the fundamental connection between holistic well-being and medical care, paving the way for a more comprehensive approach to health in the future. Assisted Stretching as a Proactive Approach to Maintaining Physical Health Engaging in regular stretching routines plays a pivotal role in enhancing musculoskeletal health and there is strong evidence suggesting it’s connected with preventing injuries and falls. This proactive health strategy not only helps individuals maintain overall physical well-being but also serves as a preventive measure against chronic conditions associated with poor flexibility and mobility. The challenge, however, lies in ensuring correct stretching techniques without proper guidance. This gap has led orthopedic experts to endorse innovative wellness concepts, such as assisted stretching, as complementary to traditional medical care. The Future of Wellness-Integrated Healthcare [StretchLab](http://www.stretchlab.com), a key player in the assisted stretching space offering one-on-one and group assisted stretching sessions, is one such wellness studio. With a mission to promote flexibility, mobility, and overall well-being, StretchLab attests that regular stretching can help individuals improve their posture, reduce muscle tension, and enhance their overall physical performance. The studio offers a variety of stretching routines that are tailored to the individual needs and fitness levels of their clients. The evolving landscape of healthcare recognizes the importance of holistic approaches to health and well-being and concepts like StretchLab may become standard offerings in comprehensive healthcare plans in the future. By incorporating assisted stretching into their wellness routines, individuals can maintain optimal health and maintain and even improve mobility in the long run.

    "title": "History of Japanese Immigrants Worth Learning - The Japan News",
    "text": "Prime Minister Fumio Kishida traveled to Brazil and Paraguay after his visit to France during Golden Week in May. Brazil, which is serving as this year’s chair of the Group of 20 leading economies, and Paraguay, which is the only country in South America that recognizes Taiwan, are both important diplomatic partners for Japan. A delegation of many Japanese business leaders accompanied Kishida on his tour of the two countries, helping to further economic relations with them. I also joined the delegation as president of the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). I was particularly impressed by the welcome given by representatives of the communities of Nikkei — Japanese immigrants and descendants — in both nations. Both in Asuncion and Sao Paulo, Nikkei from small children to senior citizens greeted Kishida with applause, as if welcoming a celebrity. “It’s like coming back to my hometown,” the prime minister told them with delight. Princess Kako, the second daughter of Crown Prince Akishino, was warmly welcomed by Nikkei when she visited Peru in November 2023. When I once visited a Nikkei community in the Amazon, I saw photos of the then Princess Mako, the eldest daughter of the current crown prince, on display. I keenly feel how important it is for Nikkei communities in various locations to stay connected to Japan. I wonder to what extent the presence of Nikkei, who are active all over the world, is understood in Japan itself. Of course, there are areas in Japan where many Nikkei live, interacting daily with local residents. And Okinawa Prefecture is known to be more aware of Japanese emigrants than the rest of Japan. Okinawa hosts a World Uchinanchu (native to Okinawa) Festival every five years, inviting people with Okinawan roots living in other parts of the world. Visitors to Hawaii cannot but help notice the presence of many Nikkei in that U.S. state. However, most Japanese people’s understanding of Nikkei does not seem to go far beyond a general impression that there are quite a few in the United States and Latin America. As of Oct. 1, 2023, there were an estimated 5 million Nikkei around the world, according to the Foreign Ministry. About 3 million of that number lived in South America. By country, Brazil was home to the most, at about 2.7 million Nikkei, followed by 1.5 million in the United States, 200,000 in Peru, 120,000 in Canada and 100,000 in Australia. The Nikkei population in Paraguay, where Kishida visited in May, stood at about 10,000. The Foreign Ministry’s estimation of the Nikkei population does not include the 270,000 who reside in Japan. This means Japan currently is home to the third largest number of Nikkei in the world. Needless to say, each Nikkei person has a personal history that can never be completely told and that has led them to where they are today. When we think about bilateral relations with foreign countries that have accepted immigrants from Japan, we should not forget the role Nikkei have played in fostering those relationships. The first destination for immigrants from Japan was the United States, especially Hawaii. From the time the first group of Japanese immigrants arrived in 1868 as agricultural workers, until the U.S. Congress passed the Immigration Act of 1924 to ban immigration from Japan, about 200,000 Japanese immigrants went to Hawaii. Japanese immigrants in the United States have suffered, facing racial discrimination and internment during World War II. Nevertheless, Nikkei have been remarkably active in U.S. society. The gateway to Honolulu is the Daniel K. Inouye International Airport named after the late U.S. senator from Hawaii. The U.S. Nikkei community also includes globally acclaimed scholar Francis Fukuyama, a Chicago native who is a regular contributor to the Insights into the World column. Before and after World War II, Brazil welcomed large numbers of immigrants from Japan. From the time the first group of Japanese immigrants arrived aboard the Kasato Maru at the southeast Brazilian port of Santos in 1908 up until the war, a total of about 190,000 Japanese emigrated to Brazil. About 70,000 did so in the postwar years. Japanese immigrants successfully settled in Brazil, but they became widely seen as a “yellow peril” and the Nikkei community was faced with growing discrimination. Immediately after World War II, fierce conflicts erupted within Brazil’s Nikkei population, which was divided into two groups. One side maintained that Japan had won the war — it was called the “Kachi-gumi” (victory group), while the other side, called the “Make-gumi” (defeat group), acknowledged that Japan had lost. Nonetheless, Nikkei circles have produced leaders in postwar Brazil’s political, bureaucratic, business and academic sectors. A number of Nikkei have become heads of state, including Peru’s former President Alberto Fujimori. Nikkei were also the first presidents of the Republic of Palau (Haruo Remeliik), the Federated States of Micronesia (Tosiwo Nakayama) and the Republic of Marshall Islands (Amata Kabua). The island nations were part of what Japan called Nanyo Gunto (South Sea Islands); Japan took control of them after World War I. These territories became fierce battlegrounds between Japan and the United States during World War II and then came under U.N. trusteeship before emerging as sovereign states. The Nikkei population in the island nations is far smaller than in the United States and Brazil, but people of Japanese descent account for 10% to 20% of the people there. Nikkei there also have their own history of hardship. In postwar Japan, many Japanese left for the Americas under the government’s emigration policy. This is particularly true of people seeking government agency support, with most of them choosing Latin American countries as their destinations. However, the relevant organizations tended to provide emigrants with information about recipient countries based on insufficient preliminary research into living environments and criteria for immigration. As a result, many Japanese immigrants encountered appalling conditions they had never imagined prior to their relocation. Japanese immigrants to the Dominican Republic, in particular, had to undergo years of immense hardship, as they received no farmland despite the pre-departure promise that land for cultivation would be transferred to them. Some later sued the Japanese government, resulting in then Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi offering apologies in 2006. Today, Nikkei people in the Dominican Republic are highly regarded for their contribution to the development of the country. As for postwar Japanese immigrants to Bolivia and Paraguay, there are scores of memoirs detailing years of indescribable hardship they had to endure. Today, Nikkei communities play a central role in large-scale farming in both countries. In Japan, the number of Nikkei workers began to rise after the revised Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Law took effect in 1990. While Nikkei abroad are now essential in supporting various countries in the world, the Nikkei population in Japan has emerged as part of Japanese society, promising to be an indispensable part of an inclusive society in the future. JICA has implemented its own support program for Nikkei communities in Latin America with volunteers engaging in a variety of activities, including providing opportunities to learn the Japanese language and supporting elderly care facilities. Naturally, participants in the support program develop an interest in Nikkei communities. Whenever I visit Latin America, I talk with JICA volunteers. They often say that they finally realize how little they knew about the history of Nikkei communities. The history of Nikkei people is a story about the confluence of Japanese history and world history. I don’t think there is a more suitable theme to be included in Japanese high schools’ modern and contemporary history textbooks. I really want the history of Nikkei to be taught at as many schools as possible. I hope the inclusion of this theme in textbooks will be treated as an important subject for consideration when the education ministry next revises the school Curriculum Guidelines.",

Entretanto, o tempo nublado previsto para Mato Grosso do Sul pode frustrar a observação da chuva de meteoros Geminídeas.\nEsta é um dos fenômenos mais aguardados do ano. O monitor do Clube de Astronomia Carl Sagan da UFMS (Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul), Henrique Amaral Arcuri, explica que é esperado mais de 150 meteoros por hora, nascendo às 20h10, e se mantendo visível até o nascer do sol.\n“Minha recomendação, é observar às 22h30, pois será o pico de observação”.\nSegundo o Observatório Nacional, a proximidade da Lua cheia irá diminuir a visibilidade de seus meteoros. Contudo, as Geminídeas são conhecidas por serem muito brilhantes, além de geralmente produzirem os bólidos, as “bolas de fogo” que surgem quando um meteoro explode ao entrar em contato com a atmosfera terrestre, emitindo uma luz intensa.\n“A velocidade dos meteoros, de cerca de 35 quilômetros por segundo, não favorece a formação de rastros persistentes. As Geminídeas têm uma origem bem especial! Como explicou Luciana Fontes, colaboradora do projeto Exoss, elas não vêm de um cometa, como a maioria das chuvas de meteoros, mas sim do asteroide 3200 Phaethon”, descreve.\nOutra curiosidade informada é que quando esse asteroide chega perto do Sol, ele libera pequenos grãos e partículas. Com o tempo, essas partículas cruzam o caminho da Terra e, ao entrar na nossa atmosfera, criam os incríveis meteoros que vemos no céu.\nComo observar? Escolha um local com pouca poluição luminosa; Direcione o olhar para longe da lua; Não é necessário usar telescópio ou binóculos, basta ter paciência e deixar seus olhos se adaptarem ao escuro. Tempo fechado Apesar do espetáculo astrônomo, o tempo nublado e chuvoso em Mato Grosso do Sul pode frustrar a observação. A previsão indica que o fim de semana terá chuva com intensidade fraca e moderada em diferentes regiões do Estado.\nDe acordo com o Cemtec (Centro de Monitoramento do Tempo e do Clima), esta situação meteorológica ocorre devido à formação de uma área de baixa pressão atmosférica, aliado ao deslocamento de cavados. A aproximação e o avanço de um novo sistema frontal, aliado ao transporte de calor e umidade reforçam as instabilidades atmosféricas no Estado.\nCompartilhe\nNotícias mais lidas agora Ex-superintendente de Cultura é assassinado a pauladas e facadas no São Francisco em Campo Grande Chuva chega forte e alaga ruas da região norte de Campo Grande Há 13 anos, casa no bairro Santo Antônio é decorada por Elizabeth com enfeites únicos de Natal Pais são presos após bebê de 2 meses ser queimado com cigarro e agredido em MS Últimas Notícias Polícia ‘Me olho no espelho e não me reconheço’, diz vítima de dentista famosa que deixou mulher com boca torta Mulher pagou R$ 10 mil pelo procedimento\nPolícia Homem é encontrado morto dentro de lanchonete em Dourados Caso é investigado pela polícia como morte a esclarecer\nCotidiano Último dia para renegociar dívidas pela campanha Nome Limpo em Campo Grande A concessionária de energia renegocia dívidas com descontos de até 80% e parcelamento em 36 vezes\nTrânsito Homem morre e 2 ficam feridos em colisão entre Doblò e caminhonete na BR-463 me Dourados Acidente aconteceu próximo ao clube do laço\nConteúdos relacionados Cotidiano Último dia para renegociar dívidas pela campanha Nome Limpo em Campo Grande A concessionária de energia renegocia dívidas com descontos de até 80% e parcelamento em 36 vezes\nCotidiano Bolsa Família: beneficiários com NIS final 4 recebem parcela de dezembro nesta sexta-feira Em Mato Grosso do Sul, cerca de 204 mil famílias recebem o Bolsa Família\nCotidiano Campo Grande recebe 5,8 mil novas vacinas contra covid-19 para grupo prioritário A vacina Zalika, indicada para pessoas a partir de 12 anos\nTodas as notícias de Cotidiano Newsletter Inscreva-se e receba em primeira mão os principais conteúdos do Brasil e do mundo.\nSeu e-mail",

    "text": "Ciudad de México, 19 ene (EFE).- Los nueve mexicanos secuestrados por un grupo armado en el límite de los estados de Guerrero y Morelos, en el sur del país, ya están libres, reveló este viernes el presidente, Andrés Manuel López Obrador.\n“¿Se acuerdan de los secuestrados de Morelos, en los límites con Guerrero? Pues ya aparecieron afortunadamente todos\", reveló el mandatario en su conferencia matutina.\nLos hechos ocurrieron el sábado pasado en la comunidad de Santa Fe Tepetapla, que pertenece al municipio Buenavista de Cuéllar, donde los primeros reportes de la Policía Estatal de Guerrero señalaron que un grupo armado llegó a una fiesta con la amenaza de matar a todos los presentes.\nLa Policía Estatal de Guerrero había informado el miércoles del rescate de cuatro hombres en el poblado de Zacapalco, pero ahora López Obrador aseguró que ya rescataron a todos.\n\"Fue una labor de la Guardia (Nacional), de la Secretaría de la Defensa, de Marina”, apuntó el presidente, quien no dio más detalles del caso ni habló de detenidos.\nLa Fiscalía General del Estado (FGE) de Guerrero abrió desde el fin de semana una carpeta de investigación por el delito de desaparición cometido por particulares.\nMientras que La Fiscalía Especializada en Materia de Desaparición Forzada y Búsqueda de Personas Desaparecidas aseguró el miércoles que mantiene la investigación al prometer que los actos no quedarán impunes.\nEl secuestro masivo refleja la crisis de violencia en Guerrero, donde apenas el 6 de enero un tiroteo dejó 13 muertos en un palenque, donde ocurren las peleas de gallos, en el municipio de Petatlán.\nEse mismo día, la fiscalía estatal inició una investigación por la aparición de cinco cuerpos calcinados tras un presunto enfrentamiento en el municipio de Heliodoro Castillo, en lo que calificó como una confrontación de grupos criminales.\nY en diciembre pasado un grupo armado se llevó a 12 empleados del gobierno municipal de Taxco, de los que ya localizaron a cuatro con vida y el resto continúan desaparecidos.

    "text": "PM Modi on Friday hailed the peace pact signed by the central and Assam governments with ULFA. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday hailed the peace pact signed by the central and Assam governments with ULFA, saying the agreement paves the way for lasting progress in the state. The ULFA's pro-talks faction on Friday signed a peace accord with the central and the Assam governments, agreeing to shun violence, surrender all arms, disband the organisation and join the democratic process. Union Home Minister Amit Shah, who was present along with Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma at the signing of the accord in the national capital, called it a golden day for the people of Assam. Tagging a post on the pact by Shah, Modi said, \"Today marks a significant milestone in Assam's journey towards peace and development. This agreement paves the way for lasting progress in Assam.\" \"I commend the efforts of all involved in this landmark achievement. Together, we move towards a future of unity, growth, and prosperity for all,\" Modi said in his post on X. The United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) was formed in 1979 with the demand for a \"sovereign Assam\". Since then, it has been involved in subversive activities that led to the central government declaring it a banned outfit in 1990. Promoted Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com The Arabinda Rajkhowa-led faction joined peace talks with the government on September 3, 2011, after an agreement for Suspension of Operations was signed between the ULFA and the central and the state governments.
