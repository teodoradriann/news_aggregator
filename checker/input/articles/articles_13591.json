    "text": "In a shot in the arm for the Bharatiya Janata Party government at the Centre, the pro-talks faction of the United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA) signed a tripartite peace accord with the Centre and Assam governments in New Delhi in the presence of Union Home Minister Amit Shah. The historic peace settlement deal brings down the curtains on one of the oldest insurgent groups in the northeast region.A 16-member delegation of the ULFA faction led by chairperson Arabinda Rajkhowa and general secretary Anup Chetia camped in New Delhi since last week. According to news agency PTI, Chetia held talks with peace interlocutor AK Mishra on Tuesday in the presence of Intelligence Bureau Director Tapan Deka.The peace accord is aimed at addressing pressing concerns such as illegal immigration, land rights for indigenous communities, besides a financial package for Assam’s development.Speaking on the signing of the tripartite accord, Amit Shah termed it a golden day for the future of Assam and said the Centre will ensure that the peace process is successful and that the reasonable demands of the ULFA faction will be met within a time-bound manner. Shah further said that ULFA as an organisation will be disbanded.“We want to assure the ULFA leadership that their trust in the Centre to ensure the success of the peace process will be honoured,” Shah said, crediting Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s leadership for ushering in peace and stability in India ’s northeast. Shah also said that the removal of the Armed Forces (Special) Powers Act from several districts of Assam was evidence that insurgency had lived its time in the region.The deal with the pro-talks faction of ULFA comes in a string of peace accords signed with various groups in the northeast who agreed to shun the path of violence. In November this year, the UNLF, Manipur’s oldest valley-based armed group, also signed a tripartite peace agreement with the Centre and state government.Founded in 1979 by a group of 20 youngsters from Upper Assam districts to wage an armed struggle for an independent Assam, the group splintered into two factions in 2011. While the pro-talks faction led by Rajkhowa opted to return to the state from abroad for peace talks, the other faction, ULFA (Independent), led by commander Paresh Barua, opposed negotiations unless the ‘sovereignty’ clause was included.The Rajkhowa faction had put forth a 12-point charter of demands spanning constitutional, political, financial, and cultural concerns. These demands included safeguarding Assam’s indigenous population, addressing missing ULFA members, providing amnesty and rehabilitation and preserving indigenous culture. They also sought the ability to foster specific foreign relationships for trade, commerce, and cultural bonds.The Centre had forwarded a draft of the proposed agreement to the pro-talks faction in April, followed by further discussions in August in New Delhi with the faction. In October, Chetia mentioned forwarding their suggestions regarding the draft proposals to the Centre. (With agencies)",

    "text": "Vishnu Dabad, 30, a Gau Rakshak or a cow protector and politician with the regional political party Jannayak Janta Party(JJP), speaks on his mobile phone at a cow shelter, run by him for injured and sick cows, in Chamdhera village, Haryana, India, November 10, 2023. REUTERS/Anushree Fadnavis Reuters\nBy Rupam Jain\nCHAMDHERA, India (Reuters) - Vishnu Dabad attributes his rise from poverty to powerful local politician to an animal: the cow.\nThe 30-year-old is one of many Gau Rakshaks, or cow protectors: activists who have taken Indian laws banning cattle slaughter and beef consumption into their own hands since Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power in 2014 at the head of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).\nScores of cow protectors in recent years have been accused of using violence to carry out extra-judicial activities, often finding themselves at odds with law enforcement, even as many won acclaim for defending the Hindu faith.\nNow some of these operatives are transferring their clout into grassroots political power, where they are pursuing a hardline majoritarian agenda, according to interviews with more than 90 activist-vigilantes, as well as senior leaders of the BJP and other parties, government officials and political analysts.\nThey described how cow vigilantism has become a finishing school for the young men who mobilise large groups against alleged cattle smugglers and used the resulting popularity to catapult into politics.\nMany are now campaigning and preparing for elections in 2024 that the BJP and allied right-wing parties are favoured to do well in.\nForty-one of the cow protectors who spoke to Reuters have been elected to positions such as village chief, town council member or local legislator in the past six years, roles that can involve governing tens of thousands of people.\nAnother 12 said they were lobbying their family members to seek local office.\n\"All of what you see: my success, my existence is only because cows have blessed me,\" said Dabad, who started a cow protection force in 2014 and was elected as village chief in 2016.\nHe is now a full-time political campaigner in the northern state of Haryana for a party allied with the BJP, and is keen to seek higher office.\nAncient Hindu religious texts praise cows, who are regarded as deities, for their nurturing ability. But India's minority Muslims and Christians, as well as some Hindus, consume beef as part of their diet, generating some sectarian tensions.\nThere is no publicly available official estimate on the number of cow activists nationwide, but activist leaders said they believe more than 300,000 Hindu men in the nation of 1.4 billion are directly involved with their groups.\nIndia's interior ministry, which oversees national law enforcement, did not return a request for comment on that figure or the role of cow activists.\nReuters previously reported that some of them have stopped cow traders - many of them Muslim men - with deadly force, according to prosecutors, witnesses and the families of victims.\nSome states have enacted laws enabling cow vigilantes to patrol alongside police.\nWhile government data does not distinguish general violence from cow-related lynching, Human Rights Watch found that at least 44 people - 36 of them Muslims - were killed in cow-related violence between May 2015 and December 2018.\nThe independent, New Delhi-based Documentation of the Oppressed database found 206 acts of cow-related violence involving 850 victims, mainly Muslims, between July 2014 and August 2022.\nThe proximity of cow activists to power has raised concerns among many Muslims, who allege that some BJP members and their affiliates have engaged in anti-Islam hate speech and violence.\nModi and the BJP have denied that religious discrimination exists in India.\nCow protectors \"are very powerful men…and there is a climate of fear,\" said Jaan Mohammed, a Muslim man whose brother was one of the first victims of a cow-related lynching after Modi took power. \"I don't think this can ever change now.\"\nLegal proceedings are pending. Seventeen men accused of involvement in his brother's 2015 killing were released on bail, and another suspect later died. Police at the time of the slaying said the alleged perpetrators behaved as if they had a \"licence to kill.\"\nModi has repeatedly criticized activists who engage in \"criminal\" violence, even as his party courts their support.\nGiriraj Singh, a BJP minister responsible for rural development, said his party welcomed anyone who wanted to \"genuinely serve the cows\".\n\"Anyone who saves mother cow must be respected and recognised,\" he told Reuters.\nIMAGE OF MODERN-DAY HINDU WARRIORS\nHalf of India's 36 states and union territories have partial or complete bans on cow slaughter - most of them governed by the BJP. But enforcement has often fallen into the hands of activists. By posting videos of their raids on alleged cow smugglers on social media, they have mobilised money, as well as thousands of Hindu men.\nReligious cow protection movements have a long history in India, but many activists, including Dabad, said they were emboldened by Modi's sweeping 2014 victory.\nDabad recounted bloody fights between his activists – who he said are often armed with batons, stones, machetes, and sickles – and alleged Muslim smugglers. He described spreading beds of nails on the road to stop vehicles suspected of smuggling cows, as well as high-speed chases and brutal attacks.\n\"The journey to protect cows has not been easy,\" said Dabad, who previously spent more than a month in jail for his vigilante activities.\nPolice responsible for the area around his hometown of Chamdhera said Dabad has been the subject of nine criminal complaints related to religious clashes and that he was arrested once for allegedly beating up a Muslim trader.\nInvestigations continue on one complaint, while the other probes have been dismissed, they said.\nThe image of lawlessness has not stopped politicians from seeking the support of such activists.\nSix officials from the party of Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala, who identified himself as Dabad's political patron, said the activist was an effective campaigner and a rising star.\nInfluential right-wing organisations such as the ruling party-affiliated World Hindu Council have helped legitimise the activists by depicting them as modern-day warriors waging a war against cow slaughter.\nCouncil spokesman Vinod Bansal likened cow protectors, some of whom he said had been killed in clashes, to brave religious warriors. He added that achieving political fame was only a side-effect of the efforts of some activists.\nChristophe Jaffrelot, a professor of Indian politics at King's College London, said the Indian state cannot harass minorities openly but by allowing vigilantes to do so, it keeps majoritarian feelings satisfied.\n\"And now these private armies ... are being given a share in governance and power at the local level,\" he said, adding that they would continue their penetration of politics.\nDuring an interview in his guesthouse, as his aides smoked on a brass water pipe, Dabad looked at them and said: \"We can all kill or get killed to protect the cow.\"\nFORCE OF THEIR OWN\nOf the 41 vigilante-politicians, eight said they joined the BJP at its encouragement.\nAnother eight, including Dabad, joined other regional parties because they said they had doubts about the BJP's commitment to cows and Hindu values.\n\"If police would effectively identify and apprehend the alleged violators of cow protection laws, then not a single Gau Rakshak will be needed,\" said Ram Charan Pande, a cow vigilante leader who serves as a village head in the northwestern state of Rajasthan.\nNarendra Raghuvanshi, a member of a regional nationalist party and a Gau Rakshak based in the central state of Madhya Pradesh said that politicians often approached cow protectors for their support: \"They know we can tilt the Hindu vote in their favour\".\nSome of the activists-turned-politicians have created power bases of their own. Dabad, the son of an illiterate farmer, now zips around Haryana in a convoy of four SUVs, while running a centre for injured and ill cows.\nHe said his political clout help him secure licences and offices for business ventures such as an alcohol store, an eatery and a real estate company.\n\"I have been able to set all of these businesses because now people know me as a man committed to protect cows,\" he said.\nThat has caused unease within India's opposition parties and the country's security establishment, according to interviews with three officials and one lawmaker.\nA top Indian interior ministry official who was interviewed on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak with media, said the cow vigilantes have managed to blend popularity with nous on local issues.\n\"Even politicians feel threatened by the enormous network of cow vigilantes,\" he said. \"They have become a force of their own.\"\n(Reporting by Rupam Jain; Additonal reporting by Shivam Patel in New Delhi; Editing by Katerina Ang)\nCopyright 2023 Thomson Reuters .\nJoin the Conversation See Comments Tags: Hinduism , India , Islam\nRead More",

Ihr Browser oder Adblocker verhindert dies momentan.\nBitte passen Sie die Einstellungen an.\nGewiss, der israelisch-iranische Krieg überschattete den Gipfel und bewog den amerikanischen Präsidenten Trump zur vorzeitigen Abreise. Doch darin lag nicht das Hauptproblem. In Kananaskis zeigte sich vielmehr eine tiefe Spaltung der Gruppe in der Ukraine-Frage. Die USA verfolgen unter Trump einen derart einseitig prorussischen Kurs, dass sich die Kluft zum Rest der G-7 nicht mehr überbrücken lässt. Frustriert gab der Gastgeber Kanada am Dienstag den Versuch auf, eine gemeinsame Schlusserklärung zum Ukraine-Krieg auszuhandeln. Die USA hatten sich geweigert, klare Worte der Kritik gegenüber dem Aggressor Russland mitzutragen.\nDringend nötige Militärhilfe bleibt aus Erstaunen kann dies niemanden, nachdem Trump in den vergangenen Monaten allen Ernstes die Ukraine für den Krieg verantwortlich gemacht und allerlei russische Propagandalügen weiterverbreitet hat. Dennoch ist es ein Tiefpunkt, dass die G-7 ausgerechnet in der Ukraine-Frage in völlige Sprachlosigkeit versinkt. Zugleich war es eine Absurdität, wie Trump im Beisein der übrigen Staats- und Regierungschefs die Wiederaufnahme des Kremlherrn Putin in die Gruppe forderte – jenes Kriegsverbrechers, der während des Gipfeltreffens mit gezielten Luftangriffen auf Wohnblöcke ein Blutbad in der ukrainischen Hauptstadt Kiew anrichtete.\nTrumps Entgleisungen wären weniger schlimm, wenn wenigstens im Hintergrund die richtigen Entscheidungen gefällt würden. Doch die neusten Zahlen zur Militär- und Wirtschaftshilfe an die Ukraine bestätigen den Verdacht: Seit Trumps Amtsantritt haben die USA das bedrängte Kriegsland im Stich gelassen. Die Anfang der Woche vom Kieler Institut für Weltwirtschaft veröffentlichte Statistik zeigt, dass die Amerikaner – lange Zeit die wichtigsten Unterstützer der Ukrainer – eine Kehrtwende vollzogen haben. Seit dem Januar hat Washington kein einziges neues Hilfspaket mehr angekündigt. Wie die untenstehende Grafik illustriert, fallen die USA deshalb seit diesem Frühjahr erstmals bei der gesamthaft geleisteten Militärhilfe hinter die Europäer zurück.\nFür die Ukraine bedeutet dies eine Katastrophe, die zahlreiche Menschenleben kosten wird. Die Entwicklung ist für sie umso bitterer, als Trumps Abkehr rein ideologisch motiviert ist und keinen militärischen oder wirtschaftlichen Sachzwängen folgt: Die Militärhilfe der USA kostete unter dem Vorgänger Biden jährlich weniger als drei Prozent des Pentagonhaushalts und nicht einmal ein Promille des amerikanischen Bruttoinlandprodukts. Das ist extrem wenig im Vergleich zum strategischen Nutzen, der mit einer erfolgreichen Abwehr des russischen Imperialismus einherginge.\nIn den Zahlen des Kieler Instituts zeigt sich allerdings auch ein Hoffnungsschimmer. So haben die Europäer die von den USA hinterlassene Lücke bisher füllen können. Sie haben ihre Hilfszusagen auf durchschnittlich 3,3 Milliarden Euro pro Monat verdoppelt, so dass der Gesamtumfang der Militärhilfe gegenüber den Jahren 2022 bis 2024 im Monatsdurchschnitt nicht gesunken ist.\nAllerdings hat eine solche Zahlenbetrachtung etwas Trügerisches an sich. Zum einen gibt es Waffen, die derzeit fast nur die Amerikaner liefern können, darunter Munition für Patriot-Flugabwehrsysteme oder Atacms-Raketen für Angriffe auf Ziele im russischen Hinterland. Zum anderen handelt es sich um eine Momentaufnahme für die ersten vier Monate des Jahres. Niemand kann garantieren, dass in Europa der politische Wille zu verstärkten Waffenlieferungen anhält und die Statistik kein blosses Strohfeuer zeigt.\nDie Europäer ziehen nicht alle am selben Strick Hinzu kommt, dass das Engagement innerhalb Europas sehr ungleich verteilt ist. Vor allem die nordischen Länder und Grossbritannien haben ihren Effort verstärkt, während Länder wie Italien und Spanien ihre Militärhilfe nicht erhöhten und Deutschland nur geringfügig. Besonders die Zurückhaltung Berlins ist besorgniserregend, sollte sie länger anhalten. Denn ohne einen Sondereffort der grössten Wirtschaftsnation Europas lässt sich der Rückzug Amerikas auf Dauer nicht kompensieren.\nDie Statistik des Kieler Instituts bezieht sich auf den Zeitraum bis April 2025, also noch bevor die Regierung Merz beschloss, keine Informationen mehr über Waffenlieferungen an die Ukraine zu veröffentlichen. Berlin begründete die Geheimhaltung mit einer neuen Politik der «strategischen Ambiguität». Es wäre für die Ukraine fatal, wenn dieses Schlagwort dazu dienen würde, das Ausbleiben von dringend benötigten Waffenlieferungen zu verschleiern.",

    "text": "Wisconsin is one of the swing states absolutely crucial to getting 270-plus electoral votes and clinching the presidency. In 2016, Hillary Clinton forgot Wisconsin existed and lost the state to Donald Trump -- the first time a Republican took the state since 1984.\nThe state went back to blue in 2020, but 2024? Well, a week ago RCP moved Wisconsin from blue to red.\nWisconsin is home to DEEP blue Dane and Milwaukee Counties, but it's also home to the ruby red WOW counties -- Washington, Ozaukee, and Waukesha.\nSoutheast Wisconsin's Fox affiliate, Fox 6, wants us to know that the mayor of Waukesha, the deep red city in the deep red county of the same name is voting for Kamala:\nWAUKESHA, Wis. - The mayor of Waukesha, a key Republican stronghold, exclusively told FOX6 News he's voting for Democrat Kamala Harris for president.\n— Kristen Orthman (@KristenOrthman)[October 24, 2024]\nThey write:\nThe mayor of Waukesha, a key Republican stronghold, exclusively told FOX6 News he's voting for Democrat Kamala Harris for president.\nIt's a Republican city in Wisconsin's largest Republican county.\nMayor Shawn Reilly grew up a Republican and voted that way for most of his adult life.\n\"It's difficult. The easy thing to do is just not say anything and cast my vote the way I want, but I think we're at a crossroads now,\" Reilly said. \"I feel in my heart that this is something that I need to come out and say: I am going to be voting for Vice President Harris to become our next president.\"\nReilly voted third party in 2016 and for President Joe Biden in 2020 but kept that to himself. For other officers, he said he votes Republican \"more often than not.\"\nRecommended\nExcept this reporting isn't accurate.\nShocker, we know.\nHe hasn’t voted Republican in two decades.\n— Legion’s Pineal Gland (@I_Am_Legion_73)\nOnce again, another giant lie from the left.\nYou guys are getting really desperate. Pretty pathetic.[October 24, 2024]\nBut they'll tell us 'disinformation' is a problem on social media.\nThe biggest peddlers of disinformation are the media themselves.\nThey're trying to paint this as Waukesha is shifting blue. We mean, it would have to be shifting if they elected this guy as mayor right?\nWrong:\nYou mean someone who isn’t a Republican and hasn’t voted Republican in at least a decade isn’t voting for the Republican?\n— Chris Karabats (@Zaphoid)\nYou mean he didn’t announce this until he announced he himself wasn’t running for re-election?\nShocking.[October 24, 2024]\nSo not only has this guy been a closet Democrat for most of his adult life, he hid it from voters until he decided not to run for reelection.\nProbably because he'd lose by Liz Cheney-type numbers.\nThe Mayor of Waukesha is elected in a nonpartisan election. When Shawn Reilly was elected in 2014, he did not need to declare a party affiliation. Reilly publically left the GOP in 2021 & the GOP opposed his re-election in 2022.\n— Izengabe (@Izengabe_)[October 24, 2024]\nWeird how Fox 6 omitted these facts.\nHe isn't red. He left the republican party publicly years ago. Around the same time that he discussed his white privilege in a public FB post. His brother is running for state assembly in my district as a Democrat. This mayor is a Democrat.\n— Kristi (@KristiKMiller)[October 24, 2024]\nCompletely a Democrat.\n(He's not a Republican, hasn't voted for a Republican for at least a decade, and had to announce he wouldn't run again before admitting he's voting for Harris)\n— Sunny (@sunnyright)[October 24, 2024]\nRight. This isn't some bellwether. It's a Democrat, voting for a Democrat, and doing so after announcing he won't seek reelection.\nBecause he'd lose.\nIt'd be nice if the media reported the whole story.\nBy the way: even if Harris takes Wisconsin, RCP still has Trump at 302 electoral votes.
