    "text": "Apple's New Age Assurance: Protecting Kids' Privacy\nApple announces a feature allowing parents to share their child's age with app developers without revealing sensitive information, amidst debates over age-verification laws. The 'age assurance' tool aims to protect children's privacy by sharing age ranges instead of exact birth dates, sparking mixed reactions in the tech industry.\nDevdiscourse News Desk| Updated: 28-02-2025 04:03 IST | Created: 28-02-2025 04:03 IST\nApple has unveiled a new feature designed to safeguard children's privacy, allowing parents to share their child's age with app developers without disclosing sensitive information like birthdays. This comes as numerous U.S. states contemplate age-verification laws for apps. The feature aims to balance privacy concerns with legal compliance.\nThe tech industry remains divided on the issue. States like Utah and South Carolina are considering legislation mandating app stores to verify user ages. Companies like Meta support such laws, arguing app stores should take responsibility, while Apple prefers not to collect sensitive data for verification purposes.\nUnder Apple's new 'age assurance' tool, parents can input a child's age, permitting the sharing of age ranges with developers. This initiative aims to keep parental control over their kids' data while minimizing information shared with third parties. Despite support from tech giants like Meta, Apple faces challenges in implementation.\n(With inputs from agencies.)",

    "text": "News\nFirst Minister calls for peace in Ukraine and Palestine in his final New Year Message\nMark Drakeford has repeated calls for an end to violence in Ukraine and the Middle East in his final message as First Minister.\nMr Drakeford, who recently announced his intention to step down as the leader of Welsh Labour and First minister next spring, said: “Blwyddyn Newydd Dda. Happy new year to you all. I hope you had a merry and peaceful Christmas.\n“As another year draws to a close and we get ready to welcome 2024, our thoughts naturally turn to the future.\n“It is a time for making plans for the year ahead. For making new resolutions. And for thinking about changes to come.”\nRemaining focused\nHe added: “This will be the last new year’s message I make as your First Minister, as this year will signal a change for me personally.\n“But until that time comes, I will be focused on this job – delivering on the promises I made to you.\n“As the new year dawns, we hope for an end to the terrible conflicts and violence which have dominated this year and last, especially in Ukraine.”\nLasting peace\n“The fighting must stop in the Middle East. We have to redouble our efforts to find a pathway to a lasting peace, which is fair to both Palestinians and Israelis.\n“The new year is a new start and I’m sure we all have ambitions and hopes for the year ahead.\n“Let’s hope for a peaceful 2024 and brighter and happier times ahead.”\nSupport our Nation today\nFor the price of a cup of coffee a month you can help us create an independent, not-for-profit, national news service for the people of Wales, by the people of Wales.",

    "text": "HELENA, Mont. — Record high numbers indicate that Montana veterans continue to trust the Montana VA Health Care System.\n“Earning someone’s trust is one of the most difficult challenges in life,” said Montana VA Executive Director Duane Gill. “We have to work for it every day. We have to earn it one step at a time until our Veterans know that they can depend on us. These trust scores are the most important ‘Thank You’ they can give us.”\nThe following was sent out by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs:\nMontana Veterans continue to trust the Montana VA Health Care System at record high numbers.\nTrust among Montana VA Health Care System Veteran patients has increased 11.5% from 2019, according to a recent customer survey. In 2019, the Montana VA had a trust score of 82.2% in the month of April. The Montana VA had a trust score of 93.6% in March 2025.\nIn Fiscal Year 2024, the Montana VA maintained a Veteran Trust Score average of 90.3 %. In fact, over the last twelve months from April 2024 to March 2025, the Montana VA has maintained a Veteran Trust Score average of 91.36%.\n“Earning someone’s trust is one of the most difficult challenges in life,” said Montana VA Executive Director Duane Gill. “We have to work for it every day. We have to earn it one step at a time until our Veterans know that they can depend on us. These trust scores are the most important ‘Thank You’ they can give us.”\nTrust ratings are based on a survey of Montana VA Veteran patients who received care in the past 90 days. Within one week of using services, these Veterans were asked if they trusted VA for their health care needs across a variety of categories — including scheduling an appointment, health care visits, in-person pharmacy, mail-order pharmacy, labs/imaging and Veteran safety.\nEnrollment at the Montana VA has increased by more than 2, 000 Veterans in the past few years.\n“There is nothing more important to Montana VA than providing Veterans with the world-class care they deserve – wherever and whenever they need it,” Gill said. “Our Veterans deserve the very best, and we will never settle for anything less.”\nAccording to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems, and CMS’ Overall Hospital Quality star assessments in 2024, VA hospitals continue to outperform non-VA hospitals — including overall hospital rating, communication with doctors, communication about medication, willingness to recommend the hospital, and more.\nIn fact, the Montana VA continues to receive a four and five-star Patient Ratings in the annuals survey’s such as Medicare’s latest patients survey.\nMontana VA encourages all Veterans, family members, caregivers, and survivors tolearn more about the VAand apply for their world-classhealth care andearned benefits today.
