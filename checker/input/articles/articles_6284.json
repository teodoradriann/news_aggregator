    "text": "By Khalid Abdelaziz\nDUBAI (Reuters) -Sudan's army launched artillery and airstrikes in Sudan's capital on Thursday in its biggest operation to regain ground there since early in its 17-month war with the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), witnesses and military sources said.\nThe push by the army, which lost control of most of the capital at the start of the conflict, came ahead of an address by its commander, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.\nBurhan said any peace efforts depended on the RSF laying down arms. He said unnamed countries were backing the RSF with men, money and weapons, but said the army was \"proceeding to defeat and dislodge these aggressors, no matter how much assistance and support they find\".\nIn the capital, witnesses reported heavy bombardments and clashes as army troops tried to cross bridges across the Nile connecting the three adjoining cities that make up the greater capital: Khartoum, Omdurman and Bahri.\n\"The army is carrying out heavy artillery strikes and airstrikes on Halfaya and Shambat,\" Ahmed Abdalla, a 48-year-old resident, told Reuters by phone, referring to areas of Bahri close to the river. \"The sounds of explosions are very loud.\"\nVideo footage showed black smoke rising above the capital and the booms of the battle could be heard in the background.\nArmy sources said their forces had crossed bridges in Khartoum and Bahri. The RSF told Reuters it had thwarted the army's attempt to cross two bridges to Khartoum. Reuters could not independently confirm the accounts.\nThough the army retook some ground in Omdurman early this year, it depends mostly on artillery and airstrikes and has been unable to dislodge nimble RSF ground forces embedded in other parts of the capital.\nDARFUR FEARS\nThe RSF has also continued to make advances in other parts of Sudan in recent months in a conflict that has displaced more than 10 million people, driven parts of the country to extreme hunger or famine, and drawn in foreign powers that have supplied both sides with material support.\nDiplomatic efforts led by the United States have faltered, with the army refusing to attend talks last month in Switzerland.\nRSF leader Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, in a recorded speech addressed to the U.N. General Assembly and released just after Burhan spoke, repeated previous pledges that his force was open to a nationwide ceasefire that would allow delivery of aid.\nOn the ground however the RSF has continued its own offensives this month, intensifying its siege of al-Fashir, capital of North Darfur state in the west of Sudan.\nAl-Fashir is the last holdout of the army and its former rebel allies across the wider Darfur region, where the U.N. and rights groups say the RSF and allies have led ethnically targeted attacks and the humanitarian situation is particularly critical. The RSF has denied being behind the violence.\nThe U.N. human rights office said on Thursday it had documented summary executions, sexual and gender-based violence, and abductions of women and young men in al-Fashir, in addition to rising civilian casualties.\n\"From bitter past experience, if al-Fashir falls, there is a high risk of ethnically targeted violations and abuses, including summary executions and sexual violence, by the RSF and allied militia,\" U.N. Human Rights Chief Volker Turk said.\nThe U.N. Security Council and secretary-general have also demanded an end to the siege of al-Fashir, home to more than 1.8 million residents and displaced people.\nThe war began when tensions between the RSF and the army, who had been jostling for position ahead of an internationally backed transition to civilian rule, erupted into open conflict.\nThe army and the RSF had previously shared power after staging a coup in 2021, two years after veteran autocrat Omar al-Bashir was toppled in a popular uprising.",

    "text": "By Jessica Hart ,\n2 hours ago Tristin McDonald grew up in Madisonville, so it was only right she bought a house in her hometown. What she didn't expect was for her home to already have issues just days after she moved in.\n“I’ve only just moved in two nights ago,” McDonald said, assessing the damage this week's severe storms did to her basement. “On Wednesday morning I woke up and there was 2-4 inches, depending upon where in the basement, of water.”\nAfter her basement flooded, McDonald said she called the Metropolitan Sewer District.\n“They sent someone out, and they did a scope, and I also had plumbing work done right after we purchased the place, and between those scopes from the plumber and the Metropolitan they showed a clear line,” she said.\nMcDonald said MSD ruled out the water in her basement was sewage. She then called the City of Cincinnati’s Stormwater Management Utility Department.\n“They came out, looked in the basement and was like ‘Wow, this is a lot of water,’” McDonald said.\nShe said she’s still waiting for the department to call her back. She knows she’s not the only one dealing with water damage in her home.\n“It’s been crazy. I mean just today we got about 30 calls,” said Randy O’Hara, a sales and marketing representative with Servpro.\nHe said his company specializes in fire restoration, mold remediation and water mitigation. He said his team has been working long hours after the storms rolled out of the Tri-State.\n“We've been hammered the last few days,” he said.\nO’Hara said none of the homes he’s seen over the last few days have extensive damage.\n“If we find water in your house or in your business, we extract the water,” O’Hara said. “If we find it in your carpet or pad, depending on what type of water loss it is that would be removed. If we find it in your drywall that can be demoed and mitigated as well, and then we bring in equipment to help dry out your home.”\nHowever, he said some of the damage he’s seeing right now can be prevented if homeowners take specific actions.\n“Walk around your house, spend a little time and see if your drains are clogged. If your drains are clogged, uncover them. If you got window wells that have drains in them as well make sure those are uncovered,” O’Hara said. “The drain in your house and in your basement, make sure that’s uncovered as well because if your sub pump does fail that water can go into your drain and you won’t have as big of water damage there too.”\nHe also said it’s important to make sure your sub pump is working properly.\nO’Hara didn’t visit McDonald’s home. McDonald and her husband removed the water themselves. For now, she’s still trying to figure out why rainwater is coming into her home.\n“Everyone is saying that it shouldn’t be happening, which yeah, I agree and MSD shows on their line that it’s clear that it’s a separate department. And, the storm drain department [Stormwater Management Utility] said that it’s not connected to the house, but somehow a massive amount of rainwater is coming into the house,” McDonald said.\nShe said there’s a storm drain right in front of her house, and it’s hard to believe that isn’t the source of her problem and she’s worried what will happen when we get more rain.\n“I’m terrified I have so much anxiety about that, but at this point, I can’t do anything I can only be reactive instead of proactive,” she said.\nShe’s hopeful the city will help her figure out why rainwater is coming into her house.\n“I can’t get a solution until I find out what the problem is,” she said.\nMcDonald also said a lot of water and debris was flowing down her street Tuesday night, and would like the city to take a look at the infrastructure that’s in place.\n“There’s a lot of mud, and rainfall, and a lot of debris that comes down this street, which I’m not sure if the inlets are big enough to support all the rain that we get,” said McDonald.\nMore Cincinnati news: Rainwater floods Madisonville homeowner's basement just days after her move-in Northside brewery searching for new location 'due to unforeseen circumstances' These are the options city officials say could help save the Ault Park Fireworks\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "title": "Experts forecast sunny outlook for 2024 Chinese travel market - World - Chinadaily.com.cn",
    "text": "Experts forecast sunny outlook for 2024 Chinese travel market Trip numbers expected to continue post-pandemic recovery The COVID-19 pandemic severely impacted outbound travel from China, causing a halt for nearly three years. The recovery of international travel in 2023 was slower than expected after China reopened its borders. However, experts are optimistic that in 2024, a full recovery will occur, re-establishing China as the world's largest travel market. The latest data from the United Nations World Tourism Organization, or UNWTO, indicates that the Chinese outbound tourism market recovered about 55 percent in the third quarter of 2023. As reported by global travel data provider OAG, in Nov 2023 domestic capacity surpassed 2019 levels by 11 percent, but international seats were 57 percent of numbers from Nov 2019. Oliver Sedlinger, an international tourism consultant at Sedlinger and Associates in Beijing, is optimistic about the Chinese market. He highlighted 2023's strong comeback and predicted a positive outlook for 2024, emphasizing the need for the European travel industry to re-engage with the Chinese market. He stressed the importance of re-establishing connections, staying informed about market trends, and not overlooking the vast potential of the Chinese market. \"For long-term strategic benefits, I think it makes a lot of sense to observe this market and to learn about its travel preferences,\" Sedlinger added. Wolfgang Arlt, director of the China Outbound Tourism Research Institute, predicted fierce competition among China, the United States and Germany for the title of the largest global outbound tourism source market in 2023, with all three countries reaching similar levels. However, Arlt confidently stated that \"In 2024, China for sure will be back as world No 1, with China's arrival numbers in most destinations to reach, at the very least, almost the same level as the pre-pandemic year of 2019\". Dragon Trail, a China-focused digital marketing and travel company, predicts a 70-percent recovery for China's outbound travel market by the end of 2023, aligning with airlines' winter-spring season plans. Tiana Tian, a research analyst at Dragon Trail, anticipated 2024 as a year of recovery, with the remaining 30 percent of lost travel demand gradually returning throughout the year, driven by holiday periods like May Day and the National Day Golden Week, and with a full recovery to pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2024. \"Limited personal income and time constraints are cited as the primary reasons for Chinese travelers choosing not to go abroad as indicated by our survey results,\" she added. According to Tian, the preferences of Chinese tourists are evolving towards high-quality and experiential travel. Personalized and flexible travel products are gaining popularity, while self-driving tours and specialized tourism offerings tailored to specific interests are also attracting attention. These trends are particularly prominent among the post-90s and post-00s generations, who exhibit a preference for independent travel planning. Chinese nationals made 155 million overseas visits in 2019, spending a staggering $255 billion, according to data from the China Tourism Academy and the UNWTO. This is nearly double the total spent by visitors from the US, three times the total spent by Germans, and almost four times the total spent by British tourists. In a recent report by the World Travel and Tourism Council, it was revealed that travelers from the Chinese mainland surpassed individuals from other markets in terms of shopping expenditures. On average, Chinese travelers spent $1,350 per person, highlighting their significant contribution to the global tourism market. David Goodger, managing director for Europe and the Middle East at Tourism Economics, said: \"Chinese travel will take further large strides towards recovery in 2024 and we anticipate that international travel spending will surpass 2019 values next year.\" \"Restoring connectivity is the crucial first step in driving growth from China and regaining market share, as well as continuing to ensure easy visa application processes. Further movement towards more facilitative visa policy or even visa-free travel will ensure an uplift in activity and allow gains in market share,\" he said. Goodger believes increasing wealth and the continued growth in the travel class will mean that there will also be a lot of new travellers still wanting some of the more traditional package tours. \"As recovery continues, we anticipate that Chinese travellers will visit a wider range of destinations and participate in additional activities. Some continued shift in per trip spend (in real, inflation-adjusted terms) is likely to persist,\" he added.",
