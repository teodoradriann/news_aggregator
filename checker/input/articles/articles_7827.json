    "text": "All’interno di un cantiere a Wilmington, Los Angeles , mercoledì 9 luglio è crollata una parte di un enorme tunnel industriale in costruzione. Dopo il crollo improvviso, sono seguite ore interminabili di paura per tutti gli operai rimasti coinvolti nell’incidente. Molti di loro, infatti, sono rimasti intrappolati per diverse ore. Sul posto sono stati dispiegati più di cento Vigili del Fuoco.\nOperai tratti in salvo Secondo quanto riferito dal Los Angeles Times, citando il Los Angeles Fire Department, i 31 operai intrappolati sono stati estratti illesi dopo diverse ore dal crollo. Non risultano operai dispersi. “Il Los Angeles Fire Department ha appena comunicato che sono usciti tutti gli operai che erano intrappolati nel tunnel a Wilmington. Ho appena parlato con molti degli operai che erano rimasti intrappolati”, scrive su X il sindaco Karen Bass.\nCome spiegato dal New York Times, il tunnel, di 5,5 metri di diametro, fa parte di un progetto da 630 milioni di dollari, riguardante la gestione delle acque reflue, con la fine dei lavori prevista per il 2027.",

    "title": "Relatives of murdered British backpacker Grace Millane ‘honoured’ by OBEs | Swindon Advertiser",
    "text": "Two relatives of murdered British backpacker Grace Millane have said they are honoured that their work to help abuse victims as a positive legacy in her name has been recognised in the New Year Honours list. The newly graduated university student was strangled to death in a hotel in Auckland, New Zealand, the day before her 22nd birthday on December 1 2018, by Jesse Shane Kempson who she met on Tinder. Kempson was found guilty by a unanimous verdict in November the following year. Grace’s mother Gillian Millane and cousin Hannah O’Callaghan, both from Essex, co-founded an organisation in her name called Love Grace, which aims to “empower victims of domestic abuse”. They described their OBEs for services to charitable fundraising and tackling violence against women as an “incredible honour” and dedicated it to Grace, saying she “would have been very proud and keen to get involved with what we are doing”. Ms O’Callaghan said: “I don’t think she would believe how big Love Grace has become and how many women we can help by offering a bit of normality to. “She would have also probably been amused that we have been to Downing Street and are now to meet a member of the Royal Family.” Love Grace collects handbags and fills them with toiletries for domestic abuse victims, as well as raising money for White Ribbon charities in the UK and New Zealand, which educate men and boys about attitudes that can contribute to violence against women and girls. Ms O’Callaghan said: “We wanted to create a legacy in Grace’s memory and directly help women who have been affected by domestic abuse, to turn our negative into a positive. “If we help just one woman, then we have achieved that. “We have been overwhelmed by the support people have shown our ‘Love Grace Handbag Appeal’, from donating handbags and toiletries, to running appeals in their own area. “This has allowed more women to receive a little bit of normality and remind them to believe in themselves as they matter. “So thank you to everyone who has donated, and all of our friends & family who have helped us with Love Grace. “We would like to accept this award on their behalf and in Grace’s name. We will continue to raise awareness of the issues many face, and make sure that no other family has to go through this.” The handbag appeal started as a practical way for the relatives to try to deal with their grief as “it was very cathartic and allows us to talk about Grace”, Ms O’Callaghan said. She added: “We had no idea how our initiative would take off. It helped that Grace loved a handbag. “Detective Inspector Scott Beard (who was part of the murder investigation team) said that each bag was a smile on the face of someone who needs it, so how lovely to think that 16,000 people have smiled because of Grace. “We are so proud of the legacy we have created in her memory.” The next step is to try to get charity status for Love Grace, which started with a 50 bag target and is now at 16,000 bags worldwide. Ms O’Callaghan said: “This will allow us to reach more areas and help offer practical empowerment to more women who need it. “Logistics is a key area for development, we rely on volunteers to set up and run appeals and then give back to refuge charities in their local areas. Hopefully we will be able to get our bags further afield.” Since Grace was murdered both women have also been fundraising for the White Ribbon charity to help raise awareness of male violence towards women. The body of Ms Millane, who had been on her gap year, was found buried in a suitcase in Waitakere Ranges, a forested area outside the city of Auckland. In February 2020, Kempson was jailed for life with a minimum term of 17 years, with the judge rejecting his argument that the pair had rough sex that went too far. He was later found guilty of raping another British tourist, who he also met on Tinder, eight months before he killed Ms Millane. The rape victim reportedly went to the police after recognising Kempson from media coverage of the death of Ms Millane. The sex offender was also convicted in a separate trial, with a different victim, of threatening to kill, two charges of assault with a weapon, three assaults and two counts of sexual violation.

    "text": "WASHINGTON — The top Republican on a key House subcommittee threatened to issue a subpoena to the Biden administration Thursday as her panel probes whether the federal government is attempting to limit information being shared on social media platforms ahead of November’s elections.\nRep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., chair of the House Oversight Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Information Technology and Government Innovation, is seeking communications between the administration and social media companies, like Facebook-owner Meta.\nThe subpoena threat, shared first with NBC News, comes after Mace requested that information in September and the administration did not respond. In a letter to the White House, obtained by NBC News, Mace wrote that it is the responsibility of the administration to be transparent about their interactions with social media companies before the election, so voters are aware of what steps the government may be taking to limit the flow of certain types of information.\n“The Biden-Harris Administration has advertised its willingness to manipulate the content of social media sites,” Mace wrote, pointing to the administration’s 2021 admission that it worked with social media companies to flag misinformation on their platforms, including related to Covid-19 .\n“The White House has not apologized for this activity or indicated that it would cease and desist from engaging in such behavior,” Mace continued.\nConservatives have accused the White House of pressuring companies like Meta and Twitter to take down content that didn’t serve the administration politically. The Supreme Court this summer, however, threw out claims that the Biden administration had illegally pressed social media companies to moderate content, with conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett writing for the majority that the platforms had “independently” “strengthened” their moderation policies before the Biden administration got involved.\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote to House Republicans in August confirming that White House officials had pressured the company to censor certain material related to Covid-19, and while the platform did comply with some of their requests, he said he now regrets that decision.\nMace pointed to statements made by the Federal Communications Commission’s top Republican, Brendan Carr, as an example of possible attempts by the administration to suppress content. Carr posted on X an example of a Facebook post critical of the Biden-Harris administration that was labeled as misinformation by the platform, citing independent third-party fact-checkers. After Carr publicly complained about the posts being flagged, Meta reviewed the posts and determined that the fact-checking process did not meet their standards and removed the disinformation flag.\nA spokesperson for Meta declined to comment on Mace’s letter. But the company said that it removed the post Carr publicly flagged because it fell outside of its rating guidelines for fact-checkers.\nThe new letter requests documents from the White House, including: all communications with social media companies and any private sector entity concerning the concealment or suppression of information on their sites and all communications between federal employees related to any discussion of concealment or suppression of information with social media companies and any private sector entity from Jan. 1, 2024, until now.\nRep. Gerry Connolly, of Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the subcommittee, said that the subpoena threat is an overreaction and that the real problem is Republicans.\n“The only evidence of collusion with a social media company is the Trump campaign’s questionable relationship with Elon Musk, the owner of X, who is doling out million-dollar checks at campaign rallies in potential violation of federal campaign finance law,” he said.\nThe White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nCORRECTION (Oct, 24, 2024, 4:32 p.m.): A previous version of this article misstated the nature of Rep. Mace’s letter to the Biden administration. She threatened to issue a subpoena but has not yet issued one.\nThe post House Republican threatens to subpoena Biden administration over alleged social media censorship appeared first on NBC News .",

    "title": "Tesla shares plunge to wipe out $73 billion in market value, after dour earnings call",
    "text": "London (CNN) — Shares in Tesla plunged as much as 11% after the market opened Thursday, wiping $73 billion off the company’s market value hours after it warned of slowing growth in electric car sales and an existential threat from Chinese rivals.\nIn an earnings presentation Wednesday, the world’s most valuable automaker said its sales growth this year “may be notably lower” than last as it continued developing the “next-generation” vehicle, likely a lower-priced model.\nWhile it reported a sizeable 38% increase in deliveries last year compared with 2022, Tesla had previously targeted a 50% annual growth rate averaged over several years.\nTesla’s financial results for the last quarter also disappointed, with adjusted earnings per share down 40% from a year earlier, and revenue, which rose 3% to top $25 billion, coming in below market forecasts.\nPeople are also reading…\nIt was the second straight quarter the company fell short of earnings forecast by analysts, following a string of better-than-expected results stretching back to the start of 2021.\nThe stock doubled in price during the course of 2023, but those gains came in during the first half of the year and Tesla shares were off to a weak start in 2024, falling 16% before Wednesday’s earnings report. The stock is currently trading at its lowest level since April last year.\nThursday’s intraday losses were comparable to an unusually large one-day fall of 11.4% in late December 2022. At the time, investors\nwere worried about the outlook for Tesla’s sales and profitability, as well as the health of the US economy.\nTesla’s fourth-quarter earnings also revealed profits under pressure. The firm’s operating margin almost halved to 8.2% from the same period in 2022, driven partly by an increase in costs related to the production of the Cybertruck pickup. The new model went into production at the end of 2023.\nDan Ives, an analyst with market research firm Wedbush, said Tesla’s earnings call provided investors with “minimal answers” to the company’s shrinking margins.\n“We were dead wrong expecting Musk and team to step up like adults in the room on the call and give a strategic and financial overview of the ongoing price cuts, margin structure, and fluctuating demand,” he wrote in a note Thursday.\nThreat from China\nTesla has been cutting prices for more than a year in an effort to boost sales as it faces intensifying competition from rivals in China.\nChina’s\nBYD beat Tesla in the final three months of last year, selling more cars than Elon Musk’s carmaker for the first time.\nMusk told analysts on the Wednesday call that Chinese carmakers were “the most competitive car companies in the world” and “will have significant success outside of China.”\n“Frankly, I think if there are not trade barriers established, they will pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world,” he said.\nRising competition from BYD and other Chinese automakers has sparked an\nanti-dumping investigation by European officials, which could lead to the imposition of higher tariffs on car imports from China. Dumping refers to the practice of exporting goods to a country at prices that do not reflect their cost.\nLooking up?\nWhile Tesla’s earnings were “disappointing and uncharacteristic,” Garrett Nelson, a senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, expects the launch of its lower-cost vehicle in the next few years to provide “the catalyst the stock needs,” he wrote in a note Wednesday.\nBen Barringer, technology analyst at Quilter Cheviot, is also optimistic. He thinks the broader economic environment is starting to turn in Tesla’s favor.\n“Interest rates will start to come down. This will be a real positive for Tesla, as well as the wider automotive sector, as consumers tend to buy their vehicles on finance,” he wrote in a note Thursday.\nChris Isidore contributed reporting.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.
