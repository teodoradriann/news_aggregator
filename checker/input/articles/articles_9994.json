    "text": "- Jack Hinshelwood (11')\n- João Pedro (23' Pen, 75' Pen)\n- Pervis Estupiñán (63')\n- Alejo Veliz (81')\n- Ben Davies (85')\nTottenham fall to Brighton as late rally comes up short\nPostecoglou reveals Romero injury after 'disappointing' hamstring strain\nAnge Postecoglou speaks about Cristian Romero's hamstring injury and his hopes for a new defender in January.\nTottenham Hotspur's top-four ambitions suffered a blow as they lost 4-2 at Brighton & Hove Albion in the Premier League on Thursday with only a late rally saving them from their heaviest defeat since Ange Postecoglou became manager.\nVictory would have put injury-hit Spurs above\nManchester City into fourth spot but they were mauled on the south coast as a Brighton side also missing key players ran riot.\n-\nStream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)\nA powerful early strike by Josh Hinshelwood and Joao\nPedro's penalty gave the hosts a deserved 2-0 lead at half-time as Tottenham struggled to deal with Brighton's intensity.\nThe visitors responded in the second half with\nRicharlison having a goal disallowed but when halftime substitute Pervis Estupinan sent a thunderbolt past Spurs keeper Guglielmo Vicario and Joao Pedro netted a second penalty the game seemed over.\nHowever, when Tottenham's late substitute\nAlejo Veliz fired home from close range in the 75th minute and Ben Davies scored with a header a miraculous comeback suddenly looked possible.\nMidfielder Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg hit the post for Spurs in stoppage time as Brighton looked nervy, but they held on to move into eighth place in the table on 30 points while Tottenham remain fifth on 36, a point off the top four.\nThe final scoreline hardly did justice to a chaotic match in which Tottenham were off the pace for long periods but showed admirable spirit to emerge with their pride intact.\nFor Brighton, without the likes of winger Kaoru Mitoma, Tariq Lamptey, Solly March and Julio Enciso, they snapped a three-match winless sequence.\nTottenham's defensive problems, made worse by centre-back Cristian Romero having been added to their injury list, were exposed by Brighton as the hosts dominated the first half.\nVicario had already made two saves before Hinshelwood was played in by Joao Pedro on the edge of the area and thumped an unstoppable shot high into the net.\nBrighton almost doubled their lead when Jan Paul van Hecke's header hit the post and as the ball rebounded towards Danny Welbeck the striker was pulled back by Dejan Kulusevski with a penalty being awarded after a VAR check.\nJoao Pedro rolled the 23rd-minute spot kick past Vicario to put Brighton in command, although Richarlison nearly responded just before half-time with a shot that kissed the post.\nSpurs looked brighter after the break and wasted several chances before Richarlison netted, only to have his joy cut short as VAR showed he was offside.\nEstupinan made it 3-0 to Brighton with a sensational strike from outside the area before Tottenham substitute Giovani Lo Celso conceded a penalty that was dispatched by Joao Pedro.\nA raft of substitutions revived Spurs with Bryan Gil and Veliz adding some energy to the visitors and the latter celebrated wildly as he slotted his first goal for the club.\nDavies headed in from close range and Tottenham then had numerous chances to try to grab an unlikely point.\nGame Information\n- Referees:\n- Jarred Gillett\nEnglish Premier League Standings\n|Team||GP||W||D||L||GD||P|\n[Arsenal](/soccer/team/_/id/359/arsenal) [Aston Villa](/soccer/team/_/id/362/aston-villa) (/soccer/team/_/id/382/manchester-city) (/soccer/team/_/id/367/tottenham-hotspur) [West Ham United](/soccer/team/_/id/371/west-ham-united) [Manchester United](/soccer/team/_/id/360/manchester-united) [Brighton & Hove Albion](/soccer/team/_/id/331/brighton-hove-albion) [Newcastle United](/soccer/team/_/id/361/newcastle-united) [Chelsea](/soccer/team/_/id/363/chelsea) [Wolverhampton Wanderers](/soccer/team/_/id/380/wolverhampton-wanderers) [AFC Bournemouth](/soccer/team/_/id/349/afc-bournemouth) [Fulham](/soccer/team/_/id/370/fulham) [Brentford](/soccer/team/_/id/337/brentford) [Crystal Palace](/soccer/team/_/id/384/crystal-palace) [Nottingham Forest](/soccer/team/_/id/393/nottingham-forest) [Everton](/soccer/team/_/id/368/everton) [Luton Town](/soccer/team/_/id/301/luton-town) [Burnley](/soccer/team/_/id/379/burnley) [Sheffield United](/soccer/team/_/id/398/sheffield-united)\nPremier League News\n[Arsenal are interested in signing Bayern Munich centre-back Matthijs de Ligt, but it may not happen until the summer.

    "text": "It hasn't happened in seven years and is a sight to behold. A total eclipse of the sun will occur on April 8. The total eclipse will not be visible in Alabama. We will be able to see only an unimpressive partial eclipse. A wide path of totality enters the United States in Texas at the Mexican border. It continues northeastward, exiting into Canada. For Alabama folks wanting to experience the total eclipse, some places in the path of totality are nearby, well worth the drive for a serious skywatcher. See them [here.](https://www.space.com/best-places-US-states-to-see-total-solar-eclipse-april-2024?utm_term=9E66A5A3-9B2D-4F7F-8125-4BF65DC334D8&lrh=a778fdf75bd652e905addef1abfaa0a195a5356c46593e8368b5fafcd68df17b&utm_campaign=58E4DE65-C57F-4CD3-9A5A-609994E2C5A9&utm_medium=email&utm_content=DE50BBC6-729F-46B3-B45F-05865101B398&utm_source=SmartBrief) Four states within driving distance of Alabama that will be in the path of totality are Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Missouri. These sites for viewing are highlighted by [Space.com](http://Space.com): TEXAS Radar Base (1:27 p.m. CDT, 4 minutes, 26 seconds): the first location to experience totality in the U.S. and for the longest time. [According to meteorologist Jay Anderson, Texclipse Music Festival](https://texclipsemusicfestival.com/), Junction (1:34 p.m. CDT, 3 minutes, 10 seconds) is the best climatological prospect for a clear sky in the U.S. [Ground Zero Music Festival](https://groundzeromusicfest.com/), Bandera (1:31 p.m. CDT, 4 minutes, 9 seconds): 20 bands, a full cowboy rodeo, stunt shows and a car and truck show. Could it be any more Texan? OKLAHOMA [Beavers Bend State Park](https://stateparks.com/beavers_bend_state_park_in_oklahoma.html), Hochatown (1:46 p.m. CDT; 4 minutes, 13 seconds): hiking, biking, and fishing on the shores of Broken Bow Lake in the Ouachita National Forest. Hochatown State Park (1:46 p.m. CDT; 4 minutes, 13 seconds): adjacent to Beavers Bend State Park with accommodation. [Red Slough WMA](https://www.wildlifedepartment.com/hunting/wma/southeast/red-slough-wma), Idabel (1:45 p.m. CDT; 4 minutes 15 seconds): 2,400 acres of wetlands near the border with Texas and Arkansas. ARKANSAS [Hot Springs National Park](https://www.totaleclipsearkansas.com/)(1:49 p.m. CDT; 3 minutes, 43 seconds): one of only two official national parks within the path of totality. [Total Eclipse of the Heart Festival](https://totaleclipserussellville.com/tickets), Russellville (1:50 p.m. CDT, 4 minutes 10 seconds): blues music, hot air balloons and BBQ are promised. [Mount Ida](https://www.arkansas.com/mount-ida)(1:48 p.m. CDT; 4 minutes, 15 seconds): rock shops and private mines allow visitors to search for their own crystals. MISSOURI [Fourche Creek Conservation Area](https://mdc.mo.gov/discover-nature/places/fourche-creek-conservation-area)(1:55 p.m. CDT; 4 minutes, 13 seconds): the longest totality in Missouri and bang on the centerline. [Cape Girardeau](https://www.cityofcapegirardeau.org/about/eclipse)(1:58 p.m. CDT; 4 minutes, 4 seconds): likely the busiest place in Missouri on eclipse day, this city will experience its second totality in less than seven years. [Poplar Bluff](https://poplarbluffchamber.org/eclipse)(1:56 p.m. CDT; 4 minutes, 8 seconds): longer totality than any other sizable community in Missouri. Local weather conditions could make or break the viewing of the eclipse. Planning ahead of time to go to one of these sites runs the risk that local weather conditions will ruin your trip. Serious skywatchers recommend waiting to check local conditions for April 1-5. Then, head for the area with clear skies predicted for April 8. If you must miss this total eclipse on April 8, don't worry. There will be another one in 2044. It will be covered by 1819 News.

    "text": "San Luis Potosí ha registrado un incremento de contagios por virus sincitial respiratorio en el último mes, derivado de las bajas temperaturas que se han registrado en el estado, por la temporada invernal y los frentes fríos que han llegado a la entidad. La Secretaría de Salud del Estado informó que desde octubre de este 2023 a la fecha se han contabilizado 133 casos por el virus sincitial respiratorio ( VSR ), de los cuales 120 personas han requerido hospitalización por complicaciones en las vías respiratorias.\nEn tan solo 20 días, se contabilizaron 78 nuevos casos de contagio de VSR. Los Servicios de Salud de San Luis Potosí registraba el 7 de diciembre únicamente 55 casos de infección.\nEl virus sincitial respiratorio ha afectado principalmente a menores de edad pues de los 55 casos detectados hasta el 7 de diciembre, 47 menores habían contraído la infección; mientras que de los 133 casos registrados a este 28 de diciembre 116 pacientes son menores de cinco años.\nSan Luis Potosí ha registrado 31 casos del virus sincitial desde que inició octubre\n¿Qué es el Virus Sincitial Respiratorio? El VSR es una enfermedad viral común, que causa una infección respiratoria aguda baja, que suele afectar los pulmones y causar neumonía, comentó Omar Medina de la Cruz, jefe del Departamento de Atención a la Salud de la Infancia y la Adolescencia en el estado.\nEl virus infecta primordialmente a menores de los cero a los cinco años, así como a niños y niñas que tienen factores de riesgo como condiciones médicas congénitas, enfermedades cardiacas o pulmonares, ya que puede impedir la respiración al inflamar sus vías respiratorias e incluso ser mortal. No obstante también puede afectar a adultos.\nAunque los síntomas del VSR son parecidos al de un resfriado común, como: congestión nasal, tos seca, fiebre, dolor de garganta, estornudos y dolor de cabeza, se recomienda acudir de inmediato al médico, para evitar una inflamación de las vías respiratorias y formas graves de la infección.\nVirus sincitial en México. Acude al médico si presentas estos síntomas",
