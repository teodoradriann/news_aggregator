    "text": "KOLKATA: The BJP, which had a stellar rise in the Jangalmahal area in West Bengal since 2019, faced a decline in support base in 2024 Lok Sabha polls. While two Lok Sabha candidates from Bankura and Jhargram lost to Trinamool, the party could not even ensure leads from the six assembly constituencies it had won in 2021.In the 2021 assembly poll, the BJP could wrest nine assembly segments in Jangalmahal area comprising Purulia, Jhargram and Bankura. During the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, it lost from Balarampur, Joypur and Kashipur assembly in Purulia and Saltora, Chhatna and Raghunathpur in Bankura. The breather in the Jangalmahal area came only from Baghmundi, where it managed to gain lead despite losing the assembly seat in 2021.“The BJP had started losing its support base since the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Meanwhile we started working extensively among the people in these three districts. That has helped us increase our support in the area,” said Tanmay Ghosh, Trinamool Congress’ spokesperson said. In Purulia, BJP could wrest five assembly seats from the Trinamool in the 2021 assembly poll. The margin for the four assembly segments were however thin, ranging between 4,000 and 7,000 votes. In Balarampur, BJP won marginally by 500 seats. In the Panchayat polls, the Trinamool managed to increase seats at the gram panchayat. At the 2023 panchayat poll, Trinamool’s vote share in Purulia increased by 12%, while the BJP’s vote share in the gram panchayats nearly halved from 2018 levels.Jhargram, which had seen nearly 35% increase in the BJP’s vote share in 2019 Lok Sabha polls, witnessed a decline in votes share in the 2021 assembly polls. Its vote share in 2019 Lok Sabha polls was at 44.56%--nearly 2% higher than what it got in 2018 panchayat poll for the district. In the 2019 assembly polls BJP’s vote share came down further across seven assembly segments to 37.15% in 2021. In the 2023 Panchayat poll, the party’s vote share for gram panchayat seats came down further to 12.81%.BJP’s minister Subhas Sarkar who won from Bankura with a margin of nearly 1.75 lakh votes in 2019 Lok Sabha polls, received . In the 2021 assembly polls, BJP managed to win in four out of seven assembly segments including Sarkar’s hometown Bankura. However, the BJP’s vote share dipped by 6% from 2019 to 2021. In the 2023 panchayat poll, its votes dipped further to 17.64% in the district.",

    "text": "Customer's photo of forlorn owner in empty restaurant leads business to boom at OK diner Nick Chappell had never been to Spirals Hot Dogs & More before he took a photo of Scott Festler in his empty restaurant. But after business boomed, Chappell's part of the Spirals family, Festler says. [Anthony Robledo](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7612431001/anthony-robledo/) An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Festler standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Festler would soon have no time to stand around as \" [Spirals: Hot Dogs & More](https://spiralshotdogs.com/),\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Festler told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Festler found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Festler said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Festler wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': [See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her](/story/life/humankind/2023/12/26/dolly-parton-meets-longtime-fan/72033945007/) Customer knew he had to capture 'wholesome moment' Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance. Noticing Festler gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\" \"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Festler waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Owner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Festler is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Festler said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Festler added.",

Pero quien va a decidir es Morena. A lo mejor ya no voy a estar aquí cuando hagan la elección, quien va a decidir es la militancia, los ciudadanos”, dijo. El mandatario destacó que como diputada federal, en la primera legislatura de Morena en la Cámara de Diputados, Alcalde se opuso a la privatización de las playas del país que promovían el PRI y el PAN.

    "text": "Bruce Lee was trying to fight sex trafficking of American women in “Enter the Dragon”. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PGjCWpbt4U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PGjCWpbt4U) So Dolph is trying to carry on Bruce’s legacy. In every showing of this film - there has been parts of it edited about sex trafficking. Watch the WHOLE unedited version from Netflix and you’ll see what I mean. Dolph Lundgren Discusses His Latest Film, “Skin Trade” The Action Star On His New Movie and His Efforts to Help Fight Human Trafficking May 08, 2015 [Dolph Lundgren](https://www.undertheradarmag.com/issues/dolph_lundgren) In Skin Trade, Dolph Lundgren plays American cop Nick Cassidy, who travels to Bangkok to take down a sex trafficking syndicate run by a violent crime lord. While there on his revenge mission, Nick’s efforts become entangled with those of an undercover detective played by martial arts star Tony Jaa. It’s an action-packed film with a supporting cast of cool, cult actors, including Ron Perlman, Peter Weller, and Michael Jai White. Dolph Lundgren began his acting career with a small role in the 1985 James Bond movie, A View To A Kill. Standing at a muscular 6’5”, Lundgren was a formidable on-screen presence. His second film would be his breakthrough: Lundgren was cast as Ivan Drago, the imposing Soviet fighter who exchanges blows with Sylvester Stallone in Rocky IV. The rookie actor’s career exploded. He became an action film staple and an icon of the genre, with starring roles in films such as Universal Soldier, Masters of the Universe, and The Expendables. Since the turn of the century, Lundgren has found work behind the camera, as well. Lundgren is not only the star of his latest film, Skin Trade, but writer and producer. We chatted with Lundgren about his new movie and his personal efforts to help fight human trafficking. Austin Trunick [Under the Radar]: A lot of people are going to look at this film just as an action movie, but it’s dealing with subject matter that seems important to you. Was part of the reason you made Skin Trade to raise awareness of sex trafficking? Dolph Lundgren: I got really interested in the subject matter. Even before the movie started, I started looking around for ways to help. I finally found this organization in L.A. that I’m working with now called CAST [The Coalition to Abolish Slavery & Trafficking]. They help a lot of survivors, and to rescue people from human trafficking and sex trafficking, and then they help them to work their way back into society here in America. Hopefully I can do more things in the future, as well. Can you tell me about the work you’re doing with CAST? I’ve only worked with them for six or seven months now, but I help them raise money and help raise awareness. There are events I’m going to where funds are being raised for [fighting] human trafficking, amongst other things. On the 21st of May, a premiere of Skin Trade is being done to support CAST and their human trafficking efforts. There’s another thing called BLUEcause, where people can bid on doing activities with celebrities, and I auction workouts. [Laughs] That money is going to CAST. So, that’s kind of what I do. You were inspired to write this story by a newspaper article you read about human trafficking. Yeah. I read an article about girls who were being trafficked from Mexico to the U.S., and they were left at the border by the traffickers. They died in this van, from heat exhaustion and suffocation. There was a similar incident in Thailand, as well. So, yeah, that was part of the inspiration for the script. How long did the idea dwell inside your head before you started writing a story around it? I had it for a couple of years. I did a three-act structure, and then I did the screenplay—this is way back, like six, seven, or eight years ago. The screenplay had various locations. For a while I was going to shoot in Russia, and I was over there in Moscow, looking for locations, financing, and actors, and so forth. That didn’t work out, so then I was in Southeast Asia a couple years back working on something else. I ran into somebody who was interested in financing the movie, and so I switched it to Southeast Asia. I imagine that’s where Tony Jaa came in. Yes, that’s correct. Tony’s a big star in Asia, but here in the U.S. he’s still only really known by more hardcore action and martial arts movie fans. Do you feel he’s overdue for a breakthrough with U.S. audiences? He feels that way. [Laughs] He’s a talented, very interesting guy. I think he could play more dramatic roles, too. He really wants to feature his fighting abilities, but if you look at Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, and Jet Li, those stars—they’ve got this charisma that you need. The fighting isn’t enough. I think he has that, and we brought some of that out in this movie. You see some of it, but I think he can do even better. So yeah, I think he could break through. Were you a fan of his Thai films before working on this project? I hadn’t seen any of them. I watched some of them because I was over there working on another film, and I was made aware of him. He’s a really great fighter, and it’s unusual these days to do your own stunts the way he does. And, you know, he has personality. But I did see many of them after that: Ong Bak, The Protector… They’re pretty cool. Your supporting cast has Ron Perlman, Peter Weller, and Michael Jai White—it’s a cool group of actors. Did you have input in the casting? Yes, I did. We went through a lot of different names, but what was cool is that people responded fairly well to the material. Ron [Perlman] was great. And also, he’s a big guy, so physically he looks formidable. Jai, of course—he’s also a great fighter. And Peter Weller came in late, but he turned out to be a great addition. I loved working with him. He’s such a great actor. He’s one of those oldschool guys, like Chris Walken—where everything he does is interesting. You mentioned that Ron Perlman’s a big guy. Has that been an obstacle for you in your career—finding co-stars who are big enough to look like they could realistically take you on? Yeah! It has, for sure. And if I’m playing the lead, who do I make the bad guy, you know? And for some reason a lot of actors tend to be short. I don’t know why. It’s the classic sort of John Wayne syndrome. In all the old John Wayne movies he’d have the same guys a lot, like Victor McLaglen. He used to fight the same guy all the time. He was a big guy. He had leading ladies who were fairly tall, to make it look more normal. He was 6’4”, I think. A lot of the old stars were really tall; like Robert Mitchum, those guys. In Skin Trade, you have a long, drawn-out, choreographed fight with Tony. How long did you spend working through those scenes together? It took a long time. They worked on it for a month or two before I got there, and then it all changed … Tony and me, we started working on it together. I think Tony and I worked on it for maybe two weeks, and then we shot it over a week. I learned a lot about how to put these things together. You have to be on top of everything. I know these are carefully choreographed, but I’m wondering how much freedom you have when you’re the actors doing these fights to come up with your own moves and ideas? We had a lot of freedom. You know, because I was a producer. I think what we try to do with the director is tell a story within the fight, so it’s not all just mindless punches and kicks. I think in a less sophisticated movie they’ll just fight forever, on this rooftop, that rooftop, the street, on the bus—I mean, it’s okay to do that in a comedy, or whatever. But in a real fight? That’s why the Rocky movies are great: there’s a story within the fights. Who wins, who’s on top at the beginning, and then this changes, and then that one gets injured and the other one takes over; there’s a beginning, middle, and an end to every fight. That’s what you need. You need to figure that out before you throw the moves in there. I know you and Tony are both professionals when it comes to shooting action scenes, but how battered do you feel after something like that? How long does it take you to recover from shooting a movie with this much action? You get beat up. You get hit, you fall… you’re basically tired. Your muscles are tired. Yeah, you need recovery time. It took me a week to get over it after that fight. You get cut and things get infected because you’re in the tropics—it’s not easy. Fortunately I’ve done a lot of fights in my career. We wanted people to see me and Tony do a lot of stuff ourselves, but you pay a price. For sure. You shot most of the film in Bangkok. When you’re shooting movies abroad, do you take time to get out and see stuff when you’re not working? Pretty much everywhere I go, I make it my business to arrange a tour with a guide—at least for one day—to learn the history of the place and see the monuments and famous buildings. I like history, you know? I did that in Bangkok early on, but I do it every other place I go, too. You had such a hand in driving Skin Trade, from writing it, to producing it, to eventually starring in it. Do you have more projects lined up like this one, which are more personal for you? Yeah. I learned a lot from this picture: what to do, what not to do. You know, I have projects where I just act, that are more like work. I play characters and have fun doing it, but it’s like a gig for hire. And then I have things where I’m more involved. For instance, I have a project that’s a WWI picture. It’s set in 1917, in Europe. I’m from Europe, and I haven’t done much there. I probably haven’t done anything in Sweden at all. It’s a script I’ve had for probably 10 years, but for some reasons it couldn’t get made and I couldn’t get the rights, but now I’m close to getting it made. We’re working on a script re-write right now. That’s something I would direct, as well, and have a little more control than I did on Skin Trade. But, yeah, that’s something I’m really looking forward to doing, because I like the story and, obviously, it’s set in Sweden and Germany and on the Western Front. It should be cool. Not too long ago you put out a fitness book titled Train Like An Action Hero. Obviously we’ll need to read the book to get the whole routine, but do you have any quick tips to share? [Laughs] Well, I think fitness isn’t about a diet, or a quick fix. It’s a lifestyle. It’s how you think … It takes a lifetime effort. People are into these big fads, you know, great abs in 20 minutes. But it’s better adopt a level where you feel comfortable, and it feels easy, and then try to build a little bit and stick with it. I think it’s the fact that it takes a long time that people find hard to accept, but that’s how it is. *** Skin Trade is now in theaters and available on demand.

    "text": "New York,NY, Dec. 28, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Allergy sufferers looking to treat their allergies without the pain and inconvenience of weekly visits to their doctor now have an ally in an at-home allergy offering developed by Curex. Online allergy clinic, Curex, is transforming how allergies are treated in the US with its affordable convenient alternative to allergy shots. Allergy immunotherapy is a proven approach to treating allergies, offering the promise of long-lasting relief. In contrast to traditional allergy medication that focus merely on alleviating symptoms, immunotherapy aims to tackle the root cause of allergies by desensitizing the body to specific allergens. However, conventional allergy immunotherapy often involves frequent in-person visits to an allergist's office, adding a time-consuming and inconvenient aspect to the treatment. Studies have shown that up to 75% of allergy sufferers discontinue allergy shots due to these challenges. But now, there is a better way. Curex offers an improved method of desensitization from allergies through its safe, effective, and convenient at-home alternative to traditional allergy shots. Curex's [allergy immunotherapy](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=O1IKkwkyVPs4aADCyZm4JyV58_Sf2yej5SKBCqjm3QyPnhrIRX_6OdC1reynQQAM_wHpYhDH1UIfx7SZxaHGDANi4R7TrFyaZx5nUo0bVDM=) treatment ensures long-term relief and includes the same composition as allergy shots, with the sole distinction being that it's administered sublingually (under the tongue). Moreover, Curex is competitively priced, with an average cost 62% lower than that of shots. Curex accepts major insurance plans and offers a self-pay option as well. The convenience of this approach results in three times better adherence to the treatment, and Curex anticipates that this will eventually yield significantly improved outcomes compared to allergy shots. Allergy sufferers seeking relief through Curex must first share some details about their symptoms, allowing Curex’s doctors to facilitate an allergy test. Most people can undergo testing conveniently at home, either with the assistance of a medical professional who visits them or by using a testing kit shipped to their home for the collection of a small blood sample. Once the lab concludes the test, patients will receive personalized treatment recommendations, including a prescription for allergy immunotherapy. Upon beginning treatment, a pharmacy will formulate personalized sublingual [allergy drops](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=O1IKkwkyVPs4aADCyZm4Jxg5lmnmFNGrHg8V5JG3e5epEs72OxVYng1cm75CsD99JRsLlyHYvb-78Cdqh4SyahuoNN9r-_M2UXWn4Peld7Y=) for the customer and dispatch them directly to the customer's home. Sublingual immunotherapy is gluten-free and formulated from all-natural clinical-grade allergen extracts. Suitable for adults and children aged 5 years and older, it effectively addresses allergies triggered by pollens, cats, dogs, molds, dust mites, grasses, and weeds. The treatment is versatile, allowing administration anywhere, and optimal results are achieved through consistent usage. [Curex](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=VXnHO291n1zft74cFA-5Rjj0gmkLFUZ1tFaTysqDqjlnv3H_PyPNFhGhyXHzoALAxvC0KxoyS7Vr05iNlhNYuZ0CrNKQCWKj_6LixVYNVPm4rtOaaJxatq9wQOdeyKdH) was founded by Gene Kakaulin and Charles Jacoby, who both suffer from allergies. Like many allergy sufferers, Charles and Gene were averse to allergy shots. Motivated by their need for a superior alternative, they realized that allergy immunotherapy extended beyond shots. The sublingual immunotherapy program was developed from extensive research and collaboration with pharmacists and allergists. Since then, the company has served over 150,000 satisfied users. Among those customers is Kelly, who suffered from cat allergies. Faced with the challenge of dating a man with a cat, she turned to Curex for relief, envisioning a future with him. Within three months, her symptoms were alleviated, allowing her to interact with the cat without any allergic reactions. Today, they're happily married. Another Curex customer, Lauren, said: \"Curex fits my life way more than allergy shots, especially since I travel frequently. I've already noticed an improvement in my symptoms compared to where I started, and it's a relief not to be on any allergy medications for once.\" In the spirit of transformative relief, Curex continues to redefine allergy management, providing solutions that resonate with individuals like Kelly and Lauren, fostering not just symptom alleviation but the creation of fulfilling, allergy-free lives.
