    "text": "[Jano Gibson](/news/jano-gibson/166982) In short Over the past week, more than 450 researchers gathered in Hobart for the inaugural Australian Antarctic Research Conference — the first such event in more than a decade. Early career researchers have issued a statement, warning urgent action is needed to prevent catastrophic sea level rise around the world. What's next? Scientists say it's vital that societies reduce greenhouse gas emissions to limit the speed and severity of climate change. Hundreds of polar researchers have issued an emergency statement calling for urgent action to deal with the impacts of climate change in Antarctica. Antarctica and the Southern Ocean have been undergoing rapid and extreme changes in recent years, including unprecedented heatwaves and record-low sea ice levels. Over the past week, more than 450 researchers gathered in Hobart for the inaugural Australian Antarctic Research Conference — the first such event in more than a decade. Loading...Almost two thirds of attendees were early career researchers, who have released a joint statement titled, Making Antarctica Cool Again. The statement warns of the potential dire consequences of global sea level rise caused by melting ice sheets. \"Nowhere on Earth is there a greater cause of uncertainty in sea level rise projections than from East Antarctica, in Australia's backyard,\" the statement says. \"The East Antarctic ice sheet alone holds enough water to raise global sea levels by approximately 50 metres if completely melted. \"Implications for our coastal cities and infrastructure are immense.\" In the past 30 years, global sea levels have risen by about 10 centimetres. Scientists say sea levels could rise by up to one metre by the end of the century under a high emissions scenario. They are becoming increasingly concerned about melting ice in Antarctica. The continent is currently estimated to lose 17 million tonnes of ice — the equivalent of a giant ice cube measuring 260 metres each side — every hour. \"The services of the Southern Ocean and Antarctica — oceanic carbon sink and planetary air conditioner — have been taken for granted,\" the researchers' statement says. \"Global warming induced shifts observed in the region are immense. \"Recent research has shown record low sea ice, extreme heatwaves exceeding 40 degrees Celsius above average temperatures, and increased instability around key ice shelves.\" Loading...The statement says societies need to urgently \"bend the carbon curve\" by reducing greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible. \"Runaway ice loss causing rapid and catastrophic sea level rise is possible within our lifetime,\" it says. \"Whether such irreversible tipping points have already passed is unknown.\" Early career researchers call for action Dr Natalia Ribeiro, an ocean and cryosphere specialist at the University of Tasmania, said the statement was designed to convey the reality of the situation to the broader community. \"Although there's lots of tipping points that we don't necessarily understand completely, we do know enough to say that we do need to protect, we do need to control our emissions,\" she said. \"And for that to happen, it needs to go beyond the walls of the university. \"We need to make sure people understand that and relate to Antarctica in a way that they see that it impacts their future as well.\" Oceanographer James Wyatt from the Australian Antarctic Program Partnership said the importance of polar research could not be understated. \"We're approaching some tipping points that we're not sure whether we can reverse or not,\" he said. \"So more funding into those areas is pretty crucial to understand how it's going to affect our planet.\" Dr Edward Doddridge, a climate scientist from the Institute of Marine and Antarctic Scientists, praised the early career researchers for bringing urgency and energy to an issue of global importance. \"We throw around the word unprecedented quite a lot in climate science, but it really is true,\" Dr Doddridge said. \"We have seen shifts in the sea ice that were beyond our wildest imaginations. We have seen heat waves that were 40 degrees warmer than expected weather. \"We have seen entire colonies of [Emperor penguins lose all of their young in a breeding season](/news/2022-05-08/emperor-penguin-at-risk-of-extinction-due-to-climate-change/101047600). \"To describe it as anything other than an emergency, sells these drastic changes short.\"",

    "text": "Dry, flaky skin is a typical enemy that many people struggle with when the winter chill sets in. The decrease in temperature, along with the severe winds and lower humidity, can have a disastrous effect on the moisture balance of our skin. But worry not, according to Dr Saru Singh, Aesthetic Consultant and physician, there are ways to keep your skin shining during the harshest months and beat the winter blues. Hydration is Key Staying hydrated is one of the most important parts of winter skincare. Even while it could be tempting to overindulge in warm, cosy drinks, it's important to remember to drink enough water. Make sure you're getting enough water throughout the day since hydrated skin begins on the inside. Gentle Cleansing Being hydrated is one of the most important parts of winter skincare. Even while it might be tempting to overindulge in warm, cosy drinks, it's important to remember to drink enough water. Since hydrated skin originates from the inside, make sure you are consuming enough water throughout the day. Moisturize, Moisturize, Moisturize Your skin needs extra nutrition during the winter. To build a barrier of defence from the severe weather, use a thick, emollient moisturizer. Seek for products with ceramides, glycerin, and hyaluronic acid, which help relieve dry skin and seal in moisture. Exfoliate Wisely Although excessive exfoliation might exacerbate dryness, it is necessary to remove dead skin cells from the skin. Choose a mild exfoliant that won't bother your skin, and limit your exfoliation to once or twice a week. This facilitates the unclogging of pores and improves the penetration of moisturizers. Humidify Your Space Your skin may become even more dry due to indoor heating systems' contribution to the air's dryness. Get a humidifier to bring some moisture into your living areas. When it comes to keeping skin from being too tight and dry, this small addition can help. Protective Clothing To protect your skin from chilly breezes, dress in layers while venturing outside in the cold. Recall to wear a scarf to shield your face from the icy weather. To keep your hands' sensitive skin from drying out, wearing gloves is also crucial. Sunscreen Isn't Just for Summer The sun in the winter can be just as harmful as the sun in the summer. Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a minimum SPF of 30, paying particular attention to exposed regions such as your hands and face. Because UV rays can still pass through clouds, wearing sunscreen is essential all year round. Healthy Diet for Healthy Skin Incorporate meals high in vitamins, antioxidants, and omega-3 fatty acids to nourish your skin from the inside out. Nuts, fatty fish, avocados, fruits, and vegetables can all help to preserve the health and vibrancy of your skin. Overnight Treatments Think about adding treatments that you do overnight to your skincare regimen. To help your skin stay extra hydrated while you sleep, use a hydrating mask or nourishing night cream before bed. Consult a Dermatologist If your skin issues still exist even after you've followed a strict winter skincare regimen, it might be time to see a dermatologist. They may offer customized guidance and suggest skincare items based on your requirements. With your skin well protected and prepared for the next icy days, you can confidently welcome winter!

    "text": "I’m a self-tortured soul. Since those two Boeing Starliner astronauts have had their return delayed, I’ve pictured their baggage going ’round and ’round for weeks on a luggage carousel at Newark Airport. Yes, I’ve become a grumpy old man. But what made me grumpy at 32 makes me grumpy at 72. There’s just now a lot more stuff to make me grumpy. I could hop on the Happy Fertilizer Truck with the rest of the obedient and compliant, ignoring indisputable truths. Multi-millionaires can’t bother to run to first; successful big-price-tag college sports are now predicated on buying illiterate young men at auction; sports promote sucker gambling before, after and during games; and the lowest acts — a Draymond Green, Megan Rapinoe and Snoop Dogg — are the very special guests. But I used to be sent to my room for lying. You want bad-is-good pandering? Fool held out the ball before crossing the goal line then performed a how-great-I-art touchdown dance with his team down 24, so play blind and stupid? Sorry, I wouldn’t do that to either of us. Having been assigned to cover broadcast sports in 1982, I have never experienced a time more bereft of dignity, credibility, honesty, decency and common sense than today, with tomorrow’s promise to grow worse. SUNDAY EXHIBIT A: The simple lifelong matter of watching, let alone enjoying, a Yankees telecast as a diminished sport with diminished TV audiences — an all-time low for last season’s World Series, for crying out loud! — has gone neglected and untreated. Arrogant greed has unilaterally forced 20 percent of Yankees games to disappear behind paywalls as good seats remain empty at obscenely priced Yankee Stadium, and subject to even independent media silence. And it’s not just a matter of unquenchable avarice, but of quality. Yankees telecasts have, far more often than not, become a matter of abandoned standards and repetitive bad decisions by those annually incapable of making good ones. Sunday’s Yankees-Rockies on YES wasn’t an inning old when Juan Soto lined a foul down the third-base line. Michael Kay described it as just that. Paul O’Neill might’ve allowed the view and Kay’s description to stand on their own but had the need to add, “Soto hit it hard but was not able to keep it fair.” We already knew and saw that. OK, not much, nothing to launch you from your La-Z-Boy, yet the harbinger of what would have to be endured over 2:55. In the bottom of the fifth, Giancarlo Stanton’s bat snapped at the handle, the fat part connecting with the neck of home plate ump Nick Mahrley , who was so stunned he tried to follow the play before falling to his knees in distress. During the first replay, Kay and O’Neill captured it well with gasping “Wows!” and “Oohs!” The rest was well and fully covered by YES’ cameras. But as Mahrley was being treated until he was removed by a cart, Kay “enhanced” the scene with a collection of mawkish, banal and insulting words — his version of NFL announcers’ solemn, “This puts everything into perspective” spiel: “You know, you see the concern on the faces of the players, and obviously there’s sometimes arguments between players and umpires, but there aren’t too many people on that field who aren’t in that fraternity, and there’s a certain feeling that they all feel toward each other. “They travel the same way, they’re on the road a lot, they’re away from their families a lot, so nobody wants to see somebody hurt.” Thus, Kay’s YES audience — and the players, coaches and managers — were populated by those who enjoyed watching an umpire struck in the neck by a broken bat? So many that Kay was moved to preach that it was no laughing matter? Without Kay’s help, who knew? As Mahrley, now out with a concussion, was wheeled off, more from Kay: “And everyone will have Nick Mahrley on their mind and hope that everything is as good as it can be.” Thank goodness, too, that Kay’s pancake slather sermon straightened out all those viewers who were overjoyed to see Mahrley go down and stay down. SUNDAY, EXHIBIT B: Then, with the Little League World Series final on ABC/ESPN, the chosen sounds and scenes grew worse, as ESPN continued to reduce sports to a carcass that would starve vultures. The telecast opened with ESPN’s hosts lining up the U.S. team to demonstrate their immodest, choreographed showboat dance — with one awkward and borderline obese 12-year-old serving as front man. Though this kid would soon ground into a bases-loaded double play then strikeout with men on, ESPN selected him as its Star of the Game — before it began. Why it would make a predetermined fool of the kid and present game as another opportunity to emulate the me-first self-destruction of our national pastime as exploited by self-smitten, fundamentals-bereft big leaguers is just another good question to which there is no good answer. Play-by-play man Karl Ravech, with no sense or feel of a game being played by children, called the game as if it were Game 7 of MLB’s World Series. Of course he did. The LLWS under ESPN has become warped, starting years ago when a despondent pitcher, knocked out of the game early, was shown sobbing in the corner of his team’s dugout — a clip that was mirthfully later shown on “SportsCenter” to ensure the kid’s further humiliation. Sunday, ESPN even included clips from the LLWS Home Run Derby. And throughout the game, gambling odds scrolled — WNBA, preseason NFL and MLB betting lines. ESPN couldn’t have suspended the appearance of sports gambling info for even two hours? “Hey, Dad, what does it mean by Cards, plus-3, against the Broncos?” But in keeping with ESPN’s twisted habit of emphasizing acts of self-aggrandizement, no matter the score, during team contests, ESPN remains in need of psychological treatment, perhaps starting with child psychiatrists. Tuesday, two days after the LLWS, I received an email from a trusted reader and friend of the head of an Upstate umpires association: “He had to refund the pre-pays for 125 out of 600 games this year because of the umpire shortage, as umps have become disgusted by the misbehavior [of players, coaches and spectators]. So many trained umps have quit that he has had to resort to playing on two different days in order to have enough umps to accommodate each game.” And Rob Manfred claims — and TV increasingly demonstrates — that the best way to attract kids — future parents — is to show big leaguers flipping their bats, pounding their chests, posing at home plate and acting like boastful creeps. And kids, as long as you run to first base and don’t practice touchdown dances, you’re more than welcome to play on my lawn.",

    "title": "2023 was Burlington’s warmest year on record, capping a year of ‘wild’ weather",
    "text": "The Burlington area is on track to have its hottest average annual temperature in at least 127 years, according to National Weather Service data — a stark sign of rising global temperatures brought on by climate change. This past year has not only been the warmest on record, but it also has been rife with different forms of extreme weather throughout the state. Heat waves , cold snaps , flooding and wildfire-related air pollution have been among 2023’s notable weather events. “It’s just been extremely wild in a number of different ways,” said Gabriel Langbauer, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service. “It’s not just been, ‘Oh, it’s warmer.’ It’s not just been, ‘Oh, we’ve had more thunderstorms.’ It’s all the different variables interacting. It’s all kinds of wonky stuff.” Vermont is not alone. This year didn’t just break global temperature records — it blew past them , according to a New York Times analysis of federal weather data. Europe and the Southwestern United States were among the regions that experienced extreme heat waves in 2023. Some climate scientists have suggested that the El Niño weather pattern is responsible for the particularly high temperatures this year. But Langbauer pointed out that at least in Vermont, 2023 is part of a broader swell of rising temperatures. “If you look at the full list of the warmest years on record, they’re all in the last 10 years,” he said. “This is the trend we’re having, and it’s going to continue to be that way moving forward.” Month-by-month data from the weather service reveals that Vermont started the year warm, with the fifth-hottest January ever recorded. But February experienced the opposite extreme. Feb. 3 marked Vermont’s coldest day in 20 years, with wind chills causing a low of about -40 degrees, Langbauer said. Service organizations across the state scrambled to make sure Vermonters experiencing homelessness and other vulnerable people were prepared for the extreme cold. Cold temperatures on May 18 also led to an unusually late frost after farmers had prepared for an early start to the growing season. Some farmers estimated a loss of 95% of their crop , leading Gov. Phil Scott to seek a disaster declaration from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The state then went through a record-breaking heat wave in early June, followed by several days of haze and air quality advisories from smoke blowing south from wildfires in Canada. Advocates expressed concern about the lack of cooling shelters for people living outside after some Vermonters were evicted from motels in early June. The northern regions of the state began reporting moderate drought conditions . Then came July. On July 9-11, record-breaking rainfall of 5 to 9 inches swept through Vermont. From Ludlow in the south to Johnson in the north , the state experienced catastrophic flooding that inundated homes, businesses and local infrastructure. Montpelier’s North Branch River reported one of its highest-ever water levels of more than 526 feet. In the weeks after the storm, the ground was so saturated that relatively minor rainfall forecasts set off flood warnings . Several communities, particularly Barre , experienced landslides that continued after the storms had passed. And on Aug. 3, another round of rain hit Addison and Rutland counties, causing flooding in downtown Middlebury and Rutland , mudslides, and the closure of the Amtrak line. Climate experts called the flooding a classic hallmark of the extreme weather patterns that climate change can cause. In total, the central Vermont region reported more than 20 inches of rain over the summer, the most it has received in 75 years. “It’s been a very, very wet year all over the state,” Langbauer said. The state then experienced another heat wave in early September, followed by a warmer-than-average October, according to weather service data. The early days of winter saw cooler temperatures and several days of snowfall. Langbauer said higher elevations such as Mount Mansfield had greater-than-average snowpack in early December, allowing ski resorts to open on the early side . But in mid-December, temperatures rose once again. A storm on Dec. 18 combined both rain and snowmelt to cause flooding across Vermont. Moretown was inundated with water from the rising Mad River. The flooding caused less damage in places like Montpelier and Barre partly because locals had rearranged their basements after July’s flood. Burlington has only received 3 inches of snow so far in December, making it the eighth least snowy December on record, Langbauer said. There are still three days left in the month, but Langbauer said it would take temperatures far below what’s forecast to change the annual average. Looking ahead to the next few weeks, the weather service is predicting temperatures closer to normal for this time of year — that is, cold. It caps an unusual year for the weather service’s forecast office, which is based in Burlington and covers parts of New York in addition to Vermont. The experience has made them think differently about how to communicate forecasts to the public, especially with the weather becoming more variable and difficult to predict. “We were joking in the office about how we weren’t gonna have any severe weather, and then a week later the July floods hit,” Langbauer said. “From that point on, it’s just been extremely wild in a number of different ways.” Read the story on VTDigger here: 2023 was Burlington’s warmest year on record, capping a year of ‘wild’ weather .",

    "title": "Grist: A Long-Awaited Rule to Protect Workers From Heat Stress Moves Forward, Even Under Trump",
    "text": "Last summer, the United States took a crucial step towards protecting millions of workers across the country from the impacts of extreme heat on the job. In July 2024, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA, published its first-ever draft rule to prevent heat illness in the U.S. workforce. Among other things, the proposed regulation would require employers to provide access to water, shade, and paid breaks during heat waves — which are becoming increasingly common due to human-caused climate change. A senior White House official at the time called the provisions “common sense.”\nBefore the Biden administration could finalize the rule, Donald Trump was reelected president, ushering in another era of deregulation. Earlier this month, the Trump administration announced plans to revise or repeal 63 workplace regulations that Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer said “stifle growth and limit opportunity.”\nOSHA’s heat stress rule wasn’t among them. And though the new administration has the power to withdraw the draft regulation, it hasn’t. Instead, OSHA has continued to move it forward: The agency is currently in the middle of soliciting input from the general public about the proposed policy. Some labor experts say this process, typically bureaucratic and onerous even in the absence of political interference, is moving along faster than expected — perhaps a sign that civil servants at OSHA feel a true sense of urgency to protect vulnerable workers from heat stress as yearly temperatures set record after record.\nBut labor advocacy groups focused on workers along the food supply chain — many of whom work outside, like farmworkers, or in poorly ventilated spaces, like warehouse and meat processing facilities — say workers have waited too long for basic live-saving protections. Earlier this month, Senator Alex Padilla and Congresswoman Judy Chu, both from California, reintroduced a bill to Congress that, if passed, would direct OSHA to enact a federal heat standard for workers swiftly.\n. . . .\nIn late June and early July, OSHA held virtual hearings in which it heard testimony from people both for and against a federal heat standard. According to Anastasia Christman, a senior policy analyst from the National Employment Law Project who attended the hearings, employees from the agency seemed engaged and asked substantive questions. “It was very informative,” she said. OSHA didn’t respond to Grist’s request for comment.\nAs written, OSHA’s proposed heat rule would apply to about 36 million workers in the U.S. Christman noted that sedentary workers — those who sit for most of the work day — are currently excluded from the federal standard. Ironically, at one point during the agency’s hearings, participants had to take an unscheduled break after the air conditioning stopped working in the Department of Labor building where OSHA staff were sitting. “They had to be evacuated because it was too hot to sit there and be on a Zoom call,” said Christman. She estimated that if sedentary workers were non-exempt, the number of U.S. workers covered by the rule would nearly double to 66 million.\nFrom her point of view, OSHA is moving “very fast on this — for OSHA.” But Christman acknowledged that, even in a best-case scenario, regulations would not be on the books for another 12 to 14 months. At that point, OSHA would publish guidance for employers on how to comply with the regulation, as well as respond to any legal challenges to the final rule. That process, “in an optimistic world,” she said, could take between two and four years.\n. . . .\nRead the full story at grist.org.\nRelated to\nThe Latest News\nAll news",

    "text": "Protesta de los inspectores de pesca en Vigo por mejoras laborales\nREDACCIÓN\nEl sindicato CC OO ha convocado una concentración para este próximo jueves, a las 12.00 horas, en el puerto pesquero de Vigo, con motivo de la huelga de inspectores de pesca marítima. El paro, promovido por esta central, la vasca ELA y respaldado por la Asociación Profesional de Inspectores de Pesca (Apipes), tiene como objetivo reivindicar el reconocimiento profesional y retributivo del colectivo de inspectores de pesca marítima. En la provincia de Pontevedra son ahora 16 los funcionarios en activo, que dependen orgánicamente del Ministerio de Política Territorial y funcionalmente del Ministerio de Agricultura, Pesca y Alimentación.\nLos trabajadores exigen una regulación laboral que se ajuste a la realidad del trabajo que realizan, «con instrucciones consensuadas, justas y eficaces». También reclaman que se atienda a las denuncias que se están presentando y no se malgaste dinero público «tapando despropósitos», así como que se adopten las medidas necesarias para acabar con «las irregularidades y los abusos» que aseguran que se están produciendo.\nRRSS WhatsApp\nRRSS Facebook\nRRSS Twitter\nRRSS email\nCopiar URL)\nNoticia guardada en tu perfil",
