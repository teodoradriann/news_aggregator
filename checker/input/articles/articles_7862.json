    "text": "HANAHAN, S.C. (WCSC) - Berkeley County students returned to the classroom Thursday, but some parents said not all of them got there on time. Pick-up for Hanahan Middle School was set for 7:30 a.m. in the Tanner Plantation community, according to parents, but it wasn’t until 9 a.m. that a bus showed up. The bus that arrived, though, wasn’t even the right bus, as parents who did not want to be identified said it was the bus meant to pick up high school students. Parents asked the driver if he could take the middle schoolers as well and after he radioed for permission, they were on their way. Neighbors said they understand hiccups happen but what happened on Thursday is a huge safety concern. Calls for communication to be improved are now aimed at the school district. The Berkeley County School District provided the following statement: Berkeley County bus drivers transport 28,000 students to school and back home safely each day. Our first drivers report to work as early as 4:30 a.m. and our last drivers conclude their days between 6:30p-7:00 p.m. In the first few days of school, students are learning bus expectations, drivers are learning about their students, and routes are being adjusted daily for traffic. Our transportation department has received minimal reports of a student not connecting with their bus, the reasons for this can vary from: - Brand new drivers learning bus routes and navigating areas with increased traffic - Due to the severe weather and flooding largely impacting Berkeley County, drivers were unable to train on newly assigned routes - Incomplete (or inaccurate) new student and returning student information - General delays resulting from increased first day of school traffic We appreciate our parents and community who support our bus drivers and have encouraged them as they navigate transportation within one of the fastest-growing counties in the state and nation. Delays will be experienced in the first few days or weeks of school; however, our commitment is to ensure that all of our bus riders are transported to school and home safely. Parents are hoping for a smoother morning on Friday. Copyright 2024 WCSC. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "Kim Jong UN bans Christmas, but activists send gifts of Bibles, food and messages of hope [Christmas is banned in North Korea](https://www.foxnews.com/category/special/occasions/christmas), but that is not stopping a group of activists from sending messages of hope, faith and freedom to the people suffering under the dictatorship of Kim Jong Un. Flash drives celebrating the holiday, and including Bible readings, were launched into the Yellow Sea in bottles so that the currents will carry them to the shores of the North Korean peninsula. \"We should be doing everything we can to get information into [North Korea](https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/north-korea) by land, by sea and by air,\" says Suzanne Scholte, chair of the Washington, D.C.-based North Korean Freedom Coalition which sponsored the messages. The operation is part of the group's \"Operation Truth,\" which Scholte says, \"is modeled after the Berlin Airlift, to get critical help to the starving people of North Korea.\" [The group](https://www.foxnews.com/category/organization) has conducted 17 launches of the bottles. Each bottle also contains enough rice to feed a family of four for a week, as well as a Bible on a flash drive and a U.S. $1 bill. Among those launching the messages were nine North Korean escapees who want to bring freedom to their homeland.

IN fact, in 1907, in Pyongyang, there were so many [Christians who believed in Jesus](https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/religion/christianity) that Pyongyang became known as a Holy City. But when Kim II Sung came to power, he wanted North Koreans to worship him as a god, and not the one true God. So, he killed many Christian leaders, sent others to political prison camps, or banished them. He did all he could to kill the followers of Jesus Christ...\" The flash drives also contain North Korean music, changing the lyrics from worshiping Kim Jong Un to worshiping God. They also play K-Pop songs, the Books of Matthew and Mark, as well as recorded messages from several members of Congress touting freedom for the North Korean people. Among those who recorded messages were Senators Jim Risch and Tim Kaine, as well as Congressmen Michael McCaul and Gregory Meeks.

It also has sent 600 shortwave radios with ear buds into the kingdom. During the summer, they started a program for Americans to order items that could be delivered to North Korea. Scholte said that an increasing number of North Koreans are learning about the outside world because of the efforts of her group. \"We must communicate to the people in power in Pyongyang that they have friends and allies in Korea and America, who have only one desire for them: to share with the benefits of a free people, to give them a life of home instead of despair,\" she said. \"Those in leadership positions in the DPRK regime wake up in the morning with only two choices in their lives: being slaves devoted to [Kim Jong Un](https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/kim-jong-un) or death and their families' deaths. That is why so many began escaping -not just for food, but for freedom, for a better life.\" [KIM JONG UN WEEPS AS HE CALLS ON NORTH KOREAN WOMEN TO HAVE MORE CHILDREN TO STEM BIRTH RATE DECLINE](https://www.foxnews.com/world/kim-jong-un-weeps-calls-north-korean-women-more-children-stem-birth-rate-decline) Scholte's group and [the Defense Forum Foundation](http://www.defenseforumfoundation.org) also help operate Free North Korea Radio, a station that broadcasts news and information into North Korea. Its director, Kim Song Min, escaped in 1997, and despite attempts by the dictatorship to jam its programming, the station has broadcast on shortwave and on the internet. \"I would like to express my gratitude to the Americans for standing with us to help us reach the people of North Korea with the truth about America and South Korea,\" he said. \"North Koreans are brainwashed from childhood to hate Americans as their enemy and believe that America occupies South Korea, making them live in misery while North Korea prospers as a paradise under the Kim dictatorship.\" ['CHRISTMAS SERMON' BY AUTHOR C.S.

Scholte said that message is what Americans cherish. \"The benefits of a free people, [a life of hope](https://www.foxnews.com/category/faith-values/faith) instead of despair.\" Fox News' Emily Robertson contributed to this report.
