    "text": "A controversial giant demon statue was taken down yesterday evening after months of criticism over alleged promotion of devil worship, pet sacrifices, and just being outright terrifying to some.\nThe infamous Kru Kai Kaeo statue was removed from the front of Bangkok’s The Bazaar Hotel in Huai Khwang district. The order came from the State Railway of Thailand who had asked the hotel for its removal by Saturday.\nThe hotel’s operator, Suan Lum Night Bazaar Ratchadaphisek, was ordered to pay a hefty fine of THB1.3 million for violating the Building Control Act.\nThe spot where the four-meter tall statue sat alongside its nine-tailed fox figure will be renovated into an activity area for guests, according to hotel owner Pairoj Thungthong.\nThe statue, known for its menacing glare and winged demon features, attracted so much attention from the public since it was erected in the beginning of August. It was deemed frightening by some, including a group called the “Council of Artists Promoting Buddhism” who had lobbied to have it removed, claiming it encourages people to worship demons and offer pets as sacrificial animals. Thankfully, there have been no reports indicating that either had happened at the site.\nKru Kai Kaeo, according to some believers, was said to be a teacher of former Khmer empire ruler Jayavarman VII. While some say he is a god of wealth, critics and scholars say they have never heard of him.\nAnother group called the National Thai People Council petitioned Bangkok Governor Chadchart Sittipunt to remove the statue as it posed “a threat to Thai culture and beliefs.”",

    "text": "The study, published in Nature Food , projects how climate change will modify the areas suited for growing 30 major crops under four scenarios, ranging from 1.5 to 4°C of global warming.\nIt finds that under just 1.5°C of warming, more than half of the studied crops would suffer from an overall loss of potential suitable cropland, compared to the current climate.\nWhile warming would decrease crop diversity in the tropics, it would increase in areas far from the equator, “offering opportunities for climate change adaptation”, the authors write.\nOne scientist, who was not involved in the study, tells Carbon Brief that expanding research beyond just staple crops is “essential to understand[ing] the full impact of climate change on agriculture”, adding that “it is exciting to see more work in this space”.\nDeclining ‘safe’ space for crops Cultivating a diverse range of crops contributes to a more stable and diverse food supply.\nFor example, having a wide variety of crops allows farmers to select the crops that will be most resilient to extreme events, such as drought.\nIn order to understand how climate change will affect future potential crop diversity, the researchers identify the “safe climatic space” – or climate “niche” – for 30 major crops. This approach “maps the current climatic space of the major production areas of each crop”, based on annual rainfall, biotemperature and aridity.\n( Biotemperature is the average of monthly average temperatures above 0°C and below 30°C, and is a method of considering both temperature and growing season.)\nUsing the “safe climatic space” approach, the authors calculate crop diversity by counting the number of crops that could be grown in a specific area in the future.\nThen, the researchers project how these areas would change under the four future warming scenarios of 1.5°C, 2°C, 3°C and 4°C above pre-industrial levels , compared to the current climate (1990-2020).\nThe study finds that under a 1.5°C warming scenario, more than half of the 30 crops analysed would see a net decrease in their global potential cropland area. The most affected crops are wheat, barley, soya beans, lentils and potatoes.\nBeyond 2°C warming, the declines in suitable areas for the 30 crops become more pronounced – in some cases approaching and passing 50 per cent, the study notes.\nIn a 3°C scenario, all of the 30 crops studied would have their suitable cropland area reduced.\nThe chart below shows the percentage changes in global potential cropland area for all the crops under the four warming scenarios examined. Each colour represents a level of global warming.\nThe 30 crops were classified into five groups: cereals, fruits and vegetables, oil crops, pulses and starchy roots.\nThe net percentage change in global potential cropland area with a safe climatic space (SCS) for the 30 crops analysed, under four global warming scenarios: 1.5°C (brown), 2°C (light red), 3°C (orange) and 4°C (yellow), compared to the current (1990-2020) climate. The crops are divided into five categories: cereals, fruits and vegetables, oil crops, pulses and starchy roots. Source: Heikonen et al. ( 2025 )\nDr Dale Rankine is an applied climate scientist at the University of the West Indies . The expert, not involved in the study, tells Carbon Brief that the wide range of crops analysed in the research is “commendable” and that the findings are largely in line with previous work.\nDr José Clavijo Michelangeli , chief product officer at Praedictus Climate Solutions , an agricultural data and forecasting company, notes that most studies on agriculture and climate change only focus on the impacts to main staple crops, such as maize, wheat, rice and soya beans. Clavijo Michelangeli, who was also not involved in the study, tells Carbon Brief:\n“Studies expanding to other crops are essential to understand the full impact of climate change on agriculture and it is exciting to see more work in this space.”\nHe points out that although the findings are consistent with previous understanding of the impacts of climate change on cropping systems, the climate data used to define the “safe climatic spaces” may not “align” with the responses to temperature of the crops currently grown there. He tells Carbon Brief:\n“This has the potential to over or underestimate the potential change in suitability of the crop in that region.”\nUnequal impacts The study also reveals that climate change impacts on crop production and diversity will vary across regions.\nRegions near the equator, such as sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia, would see the greatest declines in potential crop diversity – decreasing “on more than 70 per cent of the cropland area if global warming exceeds 2°C”, according to the study.\nBy contrast, global warming could increase the diversity of crops in other regions – such as North America, Europe, central Asia and Latin America. In these regions, crop diversity would increase – or see no change – on more than half of the cropland area under warming levels of up to 3°C, the study says.\nThe map below shows the potential changes in crop diversity at 2°C of warming. The inset charts show crop-diversity changes divided by regions and global warming levels, with the x-axis of the charts representing the four warming scenarios. Areas in brown represent places where crop diversity is projected to decrease, while those in blue are areas where crop diversity is projected to increase.\nThe percentage changes in potential crop diversity under 2°C of warming, with blue (brown) colours showing increases (decreases) in future crop diversity. The inset maps show crop diversity changes by regions and global warming levels, from 1.5 to 4°C. The y-axes show the percentage of cropland area experiencing a given change. The darker the blue colour, the bigger the increase in crop diversity. Conversely, the darker the brown colour, the bigger the decrease in crop diversity. Source: Heikonen et al. ( 2025 )\nAdaptation opportunity For areas that could see an increase in crop diversity, this creates “opportunities for climate change adaptation”, the authors say.\nClavijo Michelangeli says that the overall pattern of where the highest or lowest risks lie is in line with prior research. He adds:\n“It is very likely that warming temperatures will not only increase diversification – which is in fact already happening – but also productivity of higher-latitude systems.\n“The work is also very important in continuing to emphasise the need to do more research in tropical systems.”\nRankine warns that the benefits of increased crop production in temperate climates should not come at the expense of working to adapt agriculture in tropical climates. He argues that if future production centers on temperate countries, it could result in “a disinterest in tropical crops”.\nHe tells Carbon Brief that an uptick of extreme events in temperate areas in the future could endanger global food security:\n“If [temperate regions] become the hub for food production, this could lead to global food shortages…This would amount to maladaptation , the opposite of diversity.”\nThe study calls to limit global warming to 2°C “to avoid detrimental impacts on food production”, especially in the tropics, where many of the world’s most-vulnerable nations are located.\nSara Heikonen , the study’s lead author and a doctoral researcher at Finland’s Aalto University, says that any negative effect on agriculture in these regions would impact global food networks. Therefore, she says, “international collaboration and support for countries that need help with adaptation” will be critical for “developing new agricultural practices to adapt to these difficult conditions”.\nThis story was published with permission from Carbon Brief .\nLike this content?

    "text": "name=\"articleBody\" itemprop=\"articleBody\"> In the video: the meeting of the Brodach family with their beloved dog after the liberation from Hamas/Schneider barges\nIf anyone still needed proof of how necessary the inclusion of women in the IDF (yes, even in the fighting units), came the massacre on October 7 and the war that followed and closed the corner, but not only on the battlefield. Also in the Gaza Envelope and the northern border, and in the rear, Women took the initiative, led important moves and demonstrated courage and resourcefulness. On the occasion of International Women's Day, we will tell the stories of two of them: Lia Orpaz, a social worker in the Eshkol Regional Council on behalf of the Ministry of Welfare, a resident of Kibbutz Tzalim who was evacuated from her home and helped the survivors of the party in Ra'im, and Prof. Gilat Livni, director of the Department children at the Schneider Center, she was appointed director of the \"returnee department\" at the hospital and was entrusted with the treatment of abductees and abductees who returned from Gaza.\nLia Orpaz/courtesy of the photographers\nOn October 7, Orfaz, who also serves as the coordinator of the sexual assault unit in the Eshkol Regional Council, woke up with her family at 6:40 a.m. to the sound of alarms and rockets.\nTheir house doesn't have an alarm system so the only \"protected\" area is the hallway. The alarms continued and they asked their neighbors who had an alarm system to move in.\nThus the family found themselves with the neighbors they joined and another family inside a small room.\n\"There was nothing like this in the decade that I lived in the kibbutz,\" repeated Orpaz in a conversation with Walla!.\n\"The children, 9 and 12 years old, and I moved to a neighbor's house, my husband stayed with our dog Debbie, who is also post-traumatic. We received on WhatsApp from the kibbutz that they are taking in dozens of evacuees from the 'Hanuva' party. At the same time, I wrote to my patients that I am here for them according to a procedure I created in the last decade , until patients started writing to me that they see terrorists from the window of their home.\"\nOrfaz instructed her patients to close the emergency room door and hide. Some of them were also disconnected, so there was a lot of concern. \"My husband explained to me that the situation is very difficult and that I must come to help the wounded and the survivors, to give them first aid to prevent post-trauma,\" she said. At one point, Orfaz turned to the victims of the party, most of whom were lying in the dining room of the kibbutz, in the secretariat and in the surrounding area. She performed exercises with them to instill in them a sense of security when, during the treatment and conversation, they tell her what happened at the party. She is also sure that the therapeutic procedure saved the survivors she treated from developing post-traumatic stress disorder. trauma.\nThe secret?\nrowing swimming\nHow to look and feel great, live healthy and lose weight?\nIn collaboration with TI SWIM\nNova survivors in a healing space established for them/Niv Aharonson\nThe decision to leave\nWhile some of the injured and residents of the kibbutz decided to leave, Orpaz and her family stayed another night in the kibbutz because they did not feel safe to go out.\n\"We took two of the largest kitchen knives we have, and the dog was also with us, so that if someone passed by, she would bark and we would be ready. This did not happen. We got up early in the morning and headed towards the family in the center. 10 minutes passed and we received a message on WhatsApp that the alert squad caught terrorists outside the kibbutz. She passed I got a terrible chill, only then did I start to digest the things that happened,\" she shared.\nOrpaz and her husband brought with them everything they could take and headed to a hotel in Mitzpe Ramon.\nThere she created a daily schedule of treatments and help for the evacuees and also allocated a special treatment room for her and a sign prepared for her by one of the employees.\n\"This gesture warmed my heart in extremely difficult and dark moments,\" said Orfaz.\n\"We arrived like refugees. We were in a 30-meter room with a post-traumatic dog and I said to myself how do I take care of a place like this, but I managed. At first I took care of myself from the car and nature until I managed. The residents are used to leaving the house after each round and security escalation, and we are used to there being a regression in their mental state, And everything gets mixed up, but what happened to us in the council is the most terrible of all. All the worst fears have become a reality. The house has become dangerous and traumatic, and the testimonies and the discourse on October 7 about sexual abuse in settlements and in captivity, provoke new triggers and situations of trauma.\"\nThe scene of the massacre at the party in Ra'im/Flash 90, Haim Goldberg\nWhat about the children and the family?\n\"I tried to balance home and work, I didn't always succeed. I also saw a lot of moments of kindness. My children lost a lot. There are children who were murdered from my son's class and also amidst all the pain and the disintegration of the routine, the framework and the supports, it was important for me to tell my children that we are watching over them And that they are allowed to be in pain and allowed to be sad. I take care of myself and run in the kibbutz area, this is my release. I am back to meeting my patients face to face. These are moments of hope and optimism to bring back a part of the life before October 7th.\"\nOrpaz candidly says that reality will no longer return to what it was before October 7.\n\"The whole kibbutz remembers that day. Many people cannot return to their homes. We have a very close community in the kibbutz. It was the community anchor and for me it also gave me strength. The patients and I share a common traumatic reality. I feel that in the treatment process they feel that I understand them and this creates Closeness and trust,\" she clarified.\nKeren Katz, Deputy Director of the Southern District of the Ministry of Welfare, added: \"The social workers in the Ministry of Welfare and social services departments worked with inspiring dedication during the war, many of them residents of the recovery area who were evacuated themselves. Their professional and intensive work, which often came at personal and family costs, constitutes a significant infrastructure in the reconstruction Residents of the Hakatomo area.\"\nProf. Livni with Gali Tarshansky and her mother/official website, spokeswoman at Schneider Hospital\nA bridge between the abductees and the outside world\nProf. Gilat Livni is already used to emergency situations in the State of Israel, but for October 7 - no one could have prepared her.\nLivni, director of the children's department at Schneider Hospital, was given a difficult task - receiving the abductees who returned from captivity.\n\"There was a big shock at the beginning. Many people were drafted into the reserves from the medical system and we had to continue the treatment of the children who are already in the hospital. It's a very complex situation,\" says Prof. Livni Lavalle!.\n\"One of our interns, Major Dr. Yair Zaloff, fell fighting in the south and it was very shocking.\"\nAfter three weeks in the war, the administrators of the Schneider hospital invited Prof. Livni for a conversation and asked her to manage the returnees department at the hospital, hoping that among the abductees there would also be children.\nLivni did not hesitate for a moment.\nThey thought of everything, brought together medical teams and went over every detail from the children's toys to clothing according to every degree of abduction and abduction that comes back.\n\"We were a kind of bridge for those who sat between the isolated world and the noisy world, a world where everyone just wants to help them. We had to restore the families' trust in human beings,\" she recalls.\nProf. Livni with Amit Shani and his family/official website, spokesmen at Schneider Hospital\nIn addition to the teenagers and children who returned from captivity, mothers and grandmothers who were together because they did not want to be separated were treated at the hospital.\n\"They felt safe to tell us a lot of details, a personal and very close relationship was established along with the medical care. The mental care was the main thing to be there for them,\" she continued.\n\"There was a mother who said that she was afraid for her daughter's future because of the anxiety. We heard another girl who came back and said that she doesn't think she is the worst because there are children in her class who have had more family members killed.\"\nProf. Gilat Livni/Official website, spokeswoman at Schneider Hospital\nPrecisely in these moments, did you happen to think about your family?\n\"My son loves parties and his friends were at \"Nova\". Unbearable. We also hung a sign in our ward that says 'Don't stop thinking about them' because I want each of us to see this all day long and the thought won't leave him even for a second.\"\nProf. Livni has a clear message in the background of marking International Women's Day.\n\"This period proved to us how much women have a place in the IDF and how much they can do and contribute to the country,\" she states unequivocally. \"I was one of the first female soldiers to be an instructor at an armor school.\nAt the same time, all the acts of abuse committed on October 7, which are only now being recognized internationally, show how much darkness there is in the world, but I am sure that the light will overcome it.\"\nMore on the same topic:\nabducted\nsocial workers\nSchneider Hospital\nInternational Women's Day\nwomen\nGaza war\nWar of Iron Swords",

    "text": "La lutte contre l’extrême droite se poursuit à Bordeaux, et s’étend cette fois-ci sur la ville. Après un village antifa à l’université Bordeaux Montaigne en février dernier, le comité d’action contre l’extrême droite, fondé pour repousser les groupuscules fascistes qui venaient provoquer les étudiants, appelle à présent à un grand concert contre l’extrême droite, le 19 avril prochain à la salle Son Tay.\n30 organisations étudiantes, syndicales, politiques et associatives donnent rendez-vous dès 19h pour une soirée avec, comme invité central, le groupe Sidi Wacho, reconnu pour son engagement en faveur de la Palestine. Twinz et Spirit Soldier viendront compléter l’affiche. Parmi les organisations signataires aux côtés du CACED, on retrouve les sections syndicales de la CGT ArianeGroup Issac, de la CGT blanchisserie du CHU de Bordeaux, de la CGT Éduc’action, de Sud PTT 33, de SUD Éducation 33, ainsi que l’UL CGT Melle.\nSont également signataires Révolution Permanente, la France insoumise Gironde, le NPA A et le NPA R.Enfin, l’AFA 79, la Confédération Paysanne Groupe Jeune de Gironde, ainsi que les collectifs Libérons Georges 33 et Palestine 33 qui ont répondu présents.\nPlus qu’un concert, et au-delà d’incarner une unité par en bas contre l’extrême droite, la soirée a pour vocation de nourrir les discussions stratégiques pour affronter la marche réactionnaire en cours et la montée de l’extrême droite. Alors que les coordonnées internationales et les bouleversements amenés par Trump accélèrent la marche à la guerre et au réarmement, les attaques contre les conditions de travail et de vie vont s’intensifier.\nUn contexte qui fait progresser les idées d’extrême droite et donne confiance aux groupuscules ouvertement fascistes, comme la Bastide Bordelaise ici, mais aussi aux organisations étudiantes de la Cocarde et de l’UNI qui se radicalisent.\nLe concert s’inscrit ainsi dans la dynamique que porte le comité d’action contre l’extrême droite lancé sur l’université Bordeaux Montaigne : c’est par la mobilisation la plus large possible dans la rue et par l’alliance des différents secteurs attaqués par le gouvernement et visés par l’extrême droite que l’extrême droite reculera.\nSoyons nombreux dès 19 heures, samedi 19 avril prochain au 47 rue Son Tay à Bordeaux.\nPlace disponible sur place et ligne ici.\nLes revenus de la soirée serviront à financer l’évènement et le surplus servira à l’organisation d’une distribution alimentaire sur l’université.",

    "text": "Trending: What is the use of rice: the main health benefits are named Rice is the second most consumed grain crop in the world after wheat. However, it is much healthier for the body, especially in its whole-grain form. It does not contain gluten, and sodium and potassium are in a good ratio. OBOZREVATEL offers to learn more about its benefits published on [riza.it](https://www.riza.it/dieta-e-salute/mangiare-sano/6815/riso-perche-a-volte-e-meglio-della-pasta.html). Advantages of rice compared to wheat - Contains high-quality proteins. Rice contains lysine, an essential amino acid that is necessary for calcium fixation in bones and the formation of antibodies. - It is gluten-free. Rice is a natural gluten-free cereal that is suitable for people with celiac disease (intestinal disorders). - Rice has less sodium than wheat. For this reason, it is especially beneficial for kidney health, as excessive sodium intake causes problems with blood pressure and glomerular filtration. - It fills you up better than pasta. 100 g of raw rice turns into about 300 g of cooked rice, unlike pasta, which becomes only 200 g. And, given that the body soothes hunger based on the volume of food, not calories, eating rice makes the body satiated earlier. - It is easier to digest. The small starch granules contained in brown rice have an absorbent capacity for digestive juices and air, which is retained at the stomach level. This contributes to better absorption. What kind of rice to choose? Raw rice is processed into an edible product by gradually removing the outer layers, which reduces its nutritional value. In this case, the fibers are practically absent, and the content of vitamins and proteins is sharply reduced. On the other hand, this allows you to increase the shelf life of rice, speed up the cooking process, and make its taste more pleasant. However, whole grain (brown) rice is richer in nutrition, as it retains more nutrients useful for the body, namely phosphorus, potassium, iron, zinc, selenium, and vitamins E, B1, B3, and B6. How to cook rice? White rice has a higher glycemic index (GI) of 70 or more. To reduce this number, nutritionists recommend cooking it al dente and combining it with fiber-rich foods such as vegetables and seasonal legumes. A good rule of thumb is to choose brown rice, which has a lower GI. However, the problem is that it requires a longer cooking time, so it is not suitable for risotto, for example. To cook it properly, you need to put the rice in a saucepan and add cold water (3 cups of water for every cup of brown rice), cover, bring to a boil, and reduce the heat. The cooking process takes about 45-50 minutes.",
