[ANI](/ani-stories)| Updated: 29-12-2023 08:48 IST | Created: 29-12-2023 08:48 IST - Country: - India Ahead of the consecration ceremony of Ram Lalla Temple at Ayodhya, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to embark on a visit to Ayodhya on December 30, during which he will inaugurate various projects worth Rs 15 thousand crore to Ayodhya. Many projects will be inaugurated along with the airport, railway station, highway and railway line doubling. Four major roads will also be inaugurated. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is taking stock of the preparations of security arrangements before the Prime Minister's visit. PM Modi will also inaugurate the Ayodhya Dham Junction Railway Station, a significant milestone in the government's commitment to enhancing infrastructure and connectivity. The Ayodhya Dham Junction Railway Station, developed at a cost exceeding Rs 240 crore, boasts a modern three-storey building equipped with state-of-the-art facilities such as lifts, escalators, food plazas and child care rooms. Notably, the station is 'accessible for all' and has been certified as a green station building by the Indian Green Building Council (IGBC). It is pertinent to note that the Prime Minister's vision for Ayodhya extends beyond the railway station. At approximately 11:15 AM, he will flag off the Amrit Bharat trains, introducing a new category of superfast passenger trains in the country. The Amrit Bharat Express, an LHB push-pull train with non-air-conditioned coaches, promises an enhanced passenger experience with improved amenities including attractive seat designs, better luggage racks, mobile charging points, LED lights, CCTV and a public information system. PM will inaugurate two Amrit Bharat trains, which are Darbhanga-Ayodhya-Anand Vihar Terminal Amrit Bharat Express and Malda Town-Sir M. Visvesvaraya Terminus (Bengaluru) Amrit Bharat Express. Additionally, six new Vande Bharat Trains will be flagged off, contributing to the nation's rail network. The Vande Bharat Express trains include routes such as Ayodhya-Anand Vihar Terminal, Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Katra-New Delhi, Amritsar-Delhi, Coimbatore-Bangalore Cantt, Mangalore-Madgaon and Jalna-Mumbai. In a comprehensive move to bolster rail infrastructure in the region, the Prime Minister will dedicate three railway projects worth Rs 2300 crore. The projects include the Rooma Chakeri-Chanderi third line project; Jaunpur-Tulsi Nagar, Akbarpur-Ayodhya, Sohawal-Patranga and Safdarganj-Rasauli sections of the Jaunpur-Ayodhya-Barabanki doubling project; and doubling and electrification project of the Malhaur-Daliganj railway section.Modi's Ayodhya visit also includes the inauguration of the newly built Ayodhya Airport and participation in a public program where the Prime Minister will dedicate numerous development projects worth more than Rs 15,700 crore in the state, aligning with his vision to create modern, world-class infrastructure while preserving Ayodhya's rich history and heritage. These include projects worth about Rs 11,100 crore for the development of Ayodhya and its surrounding areas and projects worth about Rs 4600 crore related to other projects across Uttar Pradesh. Additionally, the Prime Minister will also initiate the development and beautification of tourist facilities spanning from Naya Ghat to Laxman Ghat, the construction of a visitor gallery for events like Deepotsav and the strengthening and renovation of the pilgrim path from Ram Ki Paidi to Raj Ghat and Raj Ghat to Ram Temple. An ambitious greenfield township, valued at over Rs 2180 crore and the Vashishtha Kunj Residential Scheme, with an estimated cost of around Rs 300 crore, will also launch, promising a significant boost to Ayodhya's urban landscape. Furthermore, PM Modi will lay the foundation stone of infrastructure projects, including the Lucknow-Ayodhya section of NH-28 (new NH-27), modification of the existing Ayodhya bypass, the establishment of the CIPET centre, and the construction of offices for the Municipal Corporation Ayodhya and Ayodhya Development Authority. The development momentum extended beyond Ayodhya, with the Prime Minister inaugurating and dedicating several key projects across Uttar Pradesh. These encompass the four-lane widening of Gosain Ki Bazar Bypass-Varanasi (Ghaghra Bridge-Varanasi) (NH-233), the strengthening and upgradation of the Khutar to Lakhimpur section of NH-730, and capacity enhancement of the LPG plant in Trishundi, Amethi district, Sewage Treatment Plant of 30 MLD in Pankha and 130 MLD in Jajmau, Kanpur; interception and diversion of drains and sewage treatment work in Unnao district; and CETP for Tannery Cluster at Jajmau in Kanpur. These initiatives and the Prime Minister's proactive approach towards development aim to propel Ayodhya and Uttar Pradesh into a new era of growth and prosperity, setting the stage for a brighter future for the region.

    "text": "Les orages qui ont touché les secteurs de Gérardmer et Dompaire dans les Vosges ont été violents. Ces phénomènes sont-ils liés au réchauffement climatique ? Nous avons posé la question à un expert de Météo France. Des orages violents ont entraîné des inondations et des dégâts importants dans les secteurs de [Gérardmer (Vosges) jeudi 1ᵉʳ août ](/grand-est/vosges/epinal/video-violents-orages-de-greles-et-inondations-dans-le-secteur-de-gerardmer-et-xonrupt-longemer-3012707.html)et de [Dompaire vendredi 2 août 2024](/grand-est/vosges/epinal/video-orages-les-vosges-encore-touchees-par-des-pluies-diluviennes-3013127.html). D'énormes masses d'eau sont tombées en très peu de temps. Dans le secteur de Dompaire, le maximum a été atteint avec 140 millimètres en deux heures. Nous avons posé trois questions à Claude Fanello, chef prévisionniste régional à [Météo France](https://meteofrance.com/) à Strasbourg (Bas-Rhin). En quoi ces orages sont-ils exceptionnels ? Au-delà des problèmes de grêle qui sont beaucoup plus ponctuels ou de rafales de vent, la caractéristique des orages qui ont touché les Vosges c'est vraiment l'aspect pluvieux. C'est l'importante quantité d'eau disponible et précipitable qui explique l'ampleur des averses. C'est très inhabituel sous nos latitudes. Les vents ont aussi joué un rôle dans la violence des phénomènes ? On a aussi observé une convergence des vents qui a duré entre une à deux heures et qui a favorisé les ascendances dans les nuages d'orage. La concomitance/ addition de ces deux phénomènes : ascendances et la quantité d'eau disponible précipitable expliquent les 100 relevés, voire 140 millimètres estimés dans le secteur à l'ouest d'Épinal. C'est une conséquence du réchauffement climatique ? On ne peut pas tirer de conclusion sur deux évènements ponctuels, mais les études montrent que les orages risquent d'être plus violents à l'avenir. L'évolution du réchauffement climatique fait qu'avec des températures plus chaudes, il y a potentiellement plus de vapeur d'eau dans les particules d'air, plus de charge humide dans l'atmosphère. Cette année, depuis le début de l'été, nous avons ce potentiel humide très fort. Météo France maintient le département des Vosges en vigilance jaune pour des orages fortement pluvieux jusqu'au vendredi 2 août, 22 H 00.",

    "text": "My Economics teacher commented how pleasantly surprised she was at my performance on her exam. My Mathematics instructor had the opposite response. If I cheated, upon seeing my outstanding performance on his test he asked. Surprisingly my Physics teacher had the same question while my History teacher was so pleased with my performance he had me read my essays out loud.\nWhy? She mentioned the integrity of Bolumbia and the belief that it lowered the experience for the 150 trainees in her class. Because the students of Bolumbia would be getting credit whereas the other eager students would simply be, I described to her that this would not be the case. well. finding out. I understand, novel thought. learning without credit? What's the point? She said to me that while the concept of viral education with a price tag was luring that leading brass at Ivy League schools could never support something like this. Hmm. Why? Worry? Perhaps. Elitism? More likely.\nWhy is that a few of us have top priorities that make us pursue continued growth while other are content simply to let life pass them by? Well as you may guess the chance expense is all relative to the beholder. Some individuals carry out in reality worth \"vegging out\" in front of the T.V. much greater then they do checking out a book, or finding out something brand-new, or perhaps having great sex! We may question why would they choose this over that, however as you understand by now that is all reliant on where the chooser positions worth in their life.\nIn a significant FINRA research study of investors, 10 questions were developed to determine investor savvy. 65% of investors thought their portfolios were guaranteed, of the 10 concerns, no group of participants scored more than 50% correct. They would be stopping working school if your kids scored that low on their tests. Over two-thirds of participants (69%) explained themselves as being \"somewhat well-informed\" about the market. The glimmer of hope in the study: 97% of respondents wanted to find out more about investments and finances.The trick is to be sincere. Lots of parents have a problem with this, not wanting their kids to know that they remain in monetary distress. But, not only is this the worst time to go into more financial obligation, it is likewise the best time to give your kids, and your partner, if needed, a lesson in economics. You don't need to \"lay everything on the line\", but you can talk about the need to save and how it hurts you to enter into debt and how this Christmas might not be rather what they had actually planned. You can even take this chance to discuss the basics of interest on your charge card, which is probably greater than its ever been.|We treated our financial cancer \"episodes\" like strep throat-- an intense illness rather of the chronic, systemic one it really is. Every time we have actually \"treated\" the symptom, the illness has returned bigger and stronger. My grandmother would say, \"Stop callin' that feline with the black stripe a cat! I smell skunk!\" Meaning, we are not properly identifying the issue.}\nOne of the hardest courses that I took while going to college was government/economics. It wasn't that I had a hard teacher or that I couldn't use myself, nevertheless, it was the truth that maturing I was never motivated to think about federal government and the economics part of life. The course that I took was extremely helpful to my learning economics of how cash works. It also helped me comprehend that finance and market inflation wasn't simply a thing in America, but something that was connected on a global level. We all played a part in each other's nations success whether it is for good or bad. Among my professors would always state, \"If you desire money, you need to understand how to handle it, spend it and save it.\" That was a life-altering lesson that everyone\nBooks you should read ought to comprehend.\nUnderstanding the fundamentals assists you make sense of all the rest. If you are studying economics, for example, you need to comprehend supply and need. Then it is much easier to comprehend how great weather condition can depress commodity prices, or how government costs can drive rates up.\nIf you find out the skills, you can quickly make $20,000 to $40,000 a year - which's simply working part-time. A thorough sewing maker repair course can teach you all the fundamentals you require to know to set up your own sewing maker repair store in your garage or basement workshop.

    "text": "KYODO NEWS - 12 hours ago - 22:43 | All , Japan At least 46 entities in Japan, including banks and government agencies, have been targeted by cyberattacks likely utilizing the same malware since the end of last year, a major internet security firm said Thursday.\nAccording to Trend Micro Inc., Japan Airlines Co., NTT Docomo Inc. and major banks were among the victims of distributed denial-of-service, or DDoS, attacks in which networks are overwhelmed by data from multiple sources over a short period, causing temporary service suspensions.\nPhoto taken in Tokyo on Dec. 26, 2024, shows a Japan Airlines smartphone app out of order due to a system glitch, caused by a cyberattack earlier in the day. (Kyodo) ==Kyodo The Japan Weather Association said on Thursday it was hit by a cyberattack that rendered its information website inaccessible for over nine hours from around 7 a.m.\nA similar cyberattack on Sunday that affected both the web and app versions of the weather site took over 7 hours to resolve.\nAccording to Trend Micro, the hackers are believed to have used a botnet, or a network of computers and other internet-connected devices infected by malware used to carry out the attacks.\nUpon investigating the incident against JAL, Trend Micro uncovered instructions to attack the IP addresses of the affected entities through a specific botnet. There were also signs of similar assaults in the United States and Europe.\n\"We can't rule out the possibility that multiple groups conducted attacks at the same time,\" a Trend Micro official said.\nThe hackers were able to simultaneously control devices including cameras and home appliances connected to the internet to carry out the attacks, the security firm said.",

El Salto hace público su libro de estilo para tratar la peor masacre de civiles de las últimas décadas. Las palabras importan. Los términos elegidos pueden llegar a decir más que una información presentada con aparente neutralidad. Las palabras aportan marco, contexto, otorgan o quitan legitimidad y muestran el posicionamiento del medio.\nEtiquetas\npalestina\nhamas\nisrael\nsionismo\nmasacre\nel salto diario\nmenéalo\n1\nDE3C548D-E347-406A-A60F-E6BBD322CAB7\n0\n0\nCopiar enlace\nCompartir en X\nCompartir en facebook\nCompartir en telegram\nEmbed\nVoto negativo\nMás información\nComunidad destacada de hoy\nTemazos\nTemazos\nLoguéate si deseas escribir\ncomentarios.
