    "text": "The union represents all county employees, some handling critical sectors. KCGWU members include firemen, sewer men, garbage collectors, revenue clerks, parking attendants, Early Childhood Development Education teachers, Tvet instructors, enforcement officers, mortuary and ambulance attendants. “We the National Eexcutive Committee of the Kenya County Government Workers Union being the governing body of the union, hereby unanimously resolve that strike notice issued on September 4 2024 calling on all county workers to down tools is hereby ratified,” the union’s Secretary General Roba Duba said. Roba said the decision was arrived at after the government showed no commitment is solving their pay grievances. The workers claim they have been unfairly discriminated against in the current salary adjustment that has only favoured their counterparts in the national government. The state has in the last one month given a pay rise to police officers, teachers as well as civil servants to avert strikes that threatened to stall government services. Duba protested the move by the government to only award pay increases to public servants in the national government as discriminatory. According to Roba, the Salaries and Remuneration Commission issued a circular on the pay increases for all cadres of public servants but which was later withdrawn following the anti-government protests, only to be reintroduced for national government employees. The union further claimed their members had initially been selectively left out from the phase one salary adjustments, where all public servants were to get an increment of between seven to 10 per cent. The union is also protesting delayed salary payments that has pushed majority of their members to the edge. Also in their demand list is payment of statutory deductions which counties have failed to remit. According to Duba, the pension debt currently stands at Sh60 billion owed to Local Provident Fund (Lapfund) as well as County Pension Fund (CPF)/ Laptrust. The non-remittance of the pension, Duba noted has pushed their members to abjuct poverty upon retirement. “Consequently, if these demands are not met all County Government employees who include but not limited to revenue clerks, ECDE teachers, firemen, enforcement officers, garbage collectors, environmental staff, parking attendants, Tvet instructors, mortuary attendants, ambulance attendance shall down their tools by September 24, 2024, beginning midnight,” Duba said. “Due notice is hereby given in accordance with section 76 of the Labour relations Act 2007.” The government has been facing strike threats from various sectors that could hurt the already bleeding economy following months of anti-government protests. Health workers, lecturers and university students have also issued strike notices. While health workers and lecturers are demanding better pay, the students are pushing for the review of the new funding model which they claim is anti-poor. There have been concerns that waves of strikes would further affect the country’s efforts to recover from past industrial actions and political protests.",

    "title": "The Cup of Salvation",
    "text": "“What shall I render unto the LORD for all his benefits toward me? I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the LORD.” (\n[Psalm 116:12-13](/bible/Psalm/116/12-13))\nHere is a remarkable question and answer. To everyone born into the world, God has given multitudes of benefits. “He giveth to all life, and breath, and all things” (\n[Acts 17:25](/bible/Acts/17/25)). Some receive more than others, but all receive many, so the question is what we should do for the Lord in return. The answer is simply to receive His great gift of eternal salvation!\nOn one occasion, the people of Capernaum asked Jesus: “What shall we do, that we might work the works of God?” His answer must be profoundly surprising to anyone who believes that he can please God and earn salvation by doing good works. “This is the work of God,” said Jesus, “that ye believe on him whom he hath sent” (\n[John 6:28-29](/bible/John/6/28-29)).\nThe truth is we can never pay for our sins by good deeds. If one is ever to be saved from his sins and to obtain salvation, it must be received solely by faith in the work of the Lord Jesus Christ. “For the wages of sin is death,” but “while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us” so that “the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many” and—in the words of our text above—“whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved” (\n[Romans 6:23](/bible/Romans/6/23); 5:8; 5:15; 10:13).\nTherefore, when a repentant sinner calls in faith on the wonderful name of our gracious Lord, he drinks of the healing cup of salvation and receives everlasting life. Because Jesus drank the bitter cup of God’s righteous judgment on our sins, we can drink deeply of the “living water....springing up into everlasting life” (\n[John 4:10-14](/bible/John/4/10-14)), and we can say with the psalmist: “My cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever” ( [Psalm 23:5-6](/bible/Psalm/23/5-6)).

    "title": "Irish jockey Ben Curtis making most of time at Fair Grounds",
    "text": "New Orleans might be the least American-feeling city in America. Perhaps it’s not mere coincidence that several overseas jockeys have come to Fair Grounds for their first extended stint in the United States. Ireland native James Graham began the North American phase of his career riding the 2003-04 meet. England-born Adam Beschizza began riding in America during the 2017-18 meet. And while France native Vincent Cheminaud only began taking mounts at Keeneland’s April meeting in 2022, he showed up in late February at Fair Grounds to start working horses.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow comes Ben Curtis, an Ireland native who has become an established journeyman jockey based in England. Curtis arrived in New Orleans in October and has caught on during the meet’s first 25 days. Through Jan. 4, his 13 winners placed him eighth in the jockey standings. Since Dec. 15, Curtis has gone 8 for 33. Only one jockey, Brian Hernandez, has ridden more winners, nine, over the span.\\r\\n\\r\\nCurtis, 34, rode one horse at Gulfstream Park in 2012 while working for trainer Eddie Kenneally, and he finished unplaced riding Mootasadir in the 2019 Belmont Gold Cup. Curtis had ridden in Dubai during previous winters and kept an open mind when he was contacted last year about a Louisiana agent looking for an overseas rider.\\r\\n\\r\\n:: Bet the races with a $200 First Deposit Match + FREE All Access PPs! Join DRF Bets.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Riding in America was on my list, just to see how I fit in compared to the other jockeys over here. Could I compete in the U.S. and give it a go?” Curtis said, reached Friday morning by phone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe agent was Ron Faucheux, multiple leading trainer at Fair Grounds before becoming an agent last April.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I made some inquiries, and he was interested in coming over,” said Faucheux, who also represents Jose Luis Rodriguez. “The Fair Grounds meet, it’s really a perfect time for him.”\\r\\n\\r\\nCurtis has gone 8 for 39 on turf and 5 for 39 on dirt. Aside from riding on dirt in Dubai, Curtis spent the winter of 2019-20 on the all-weather circuit in England and Ireland, winning the jockeys’ title while riding on flat oval tracks like those in America. On American dirt, Curtis has discovered the importance of forward placement.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s a different side of riding over here. If you’re too far back, you’re in trouble,” Curtis said.\\r\\n\\r\\nCurtis’s family, including children aged 2 and 5, are in New Orleans until February. Curtis plans to ride the rest of the meet and perhaps beyond.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Everything has been going very well in England,” said Curtis, who had 100 winners during the 2023 flat-racing season. “I don’t have any set plans. I came over a bit of an open book.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe book on Curtis is that he comes out and works in the morning and will give you a solid run in the afternoon. Faucheux has excellent connections at Fair Grounds, so Curtis should be a Fair Grounds fixture in the top 10 through meet’s end.\\r\\n\\r\\n:: Want to learn more about handicapping and wagering?

    "text": "Scoppia il caso che può condizionare l’intero campionato: sconfitta a tavolino, penalizzazione e mercato bloccato\nUna stangata pesantissima che potrebbe condizionare il resto del campionato. Scoppia il caso dopo quanto emerso dalla prima giornata disputata ad agosto.\nPalloni (LaPresse) – Calciomercato.it Siamo in Romania ed in particolare nella Liga 3, il corrispettivo della Serie C italiana: qui il Vointa Limpezis è stata accusata durante e dopo la prima partita di campionato disputata lo scorso 31 agosto. Il match, sul campo del CSM Adjud , aveva visto la compagine ospite imporsi con il punteggio di 1-0, ma i padroni di casa avevano protestato già durante l’intervallo ed hanno poi presentato (e vinto) il ricorso.\nTutto nasce dalla formazione schierata in campo dal Vointa: nella distinta compaiono calciatori che in realtà non corrispondevano a quelli effettivamente in campo. Da qui la denuncia all’arbitro che decideva di mandare in tribuna sei giocatori degli ospiti, dando il via libera soltanto per 12 di loro. Ma non è finita perché in campo, in qualità di Under 19 romeno , ci va un calciatore che gioca sotto falsa identità, essendo in realtà sudamericano.\nLa squadra avversaria se ne accorge e all’intervallo chiede all’arbitro di verificare. Il direttore di gara chiama a sé il calciatore e gli chiede il nome, ma i dirigenti della società giustificano la mancata risposta affermando che il giocatore era sordomuto e non sapeva scrivere. Il caso è andato avanti con le indagini della giustizia sportiva che ora hanno portato a galla la verità.\nRomania, sconfitta e penalizzazione: falsificata l’identità del calciatore L’inchiesta sportiva è stato in gradi di appurare che il calciatore in questione non era effettivamente rumeno e che ha giocato sotto falsa identità. Da qui la sanzione pesantissima per la società con la sconfitta 3-0 a tavolino e ben sei punti di penalizzazione .\nPallone (LaPresse) -Calciomercato.it Ma per il Vointa Limpezis la stangata è ancora più pesante perché prevede anche lo stop al mercato nella prossima sessione ed un’ammenda di 2.200 lei. Una vera batosta che avrà inevitabili ripercussioni sulla società che negli anni scorsi per due volte è retrocessa in Liga 4 e poi ripescata. Con questo inizio non è da escludere che arrivi la terza retrocessione consecutiva.",

Ashraf Amra / Anadolu via Getty Images On Wednesday, a U.S. district judge in California pleaded for U.S. officials to reexamine the country’s “unflagging support” of Israel amid its current bulldozing of Gaza while dismissing a case brought against the Biden administration over its complicity in the assault over jurisdictional grounds.\nJudge Jeffrey White, a George W. Bush appointee, appeared to reluctantly rule that the case was outside of the purview of the court, writing that the suit represented one of the “rare cases” in which he was unable to rule for that reason.\nHowever, White was sympathetic to the case, and notably didn’t dismiss the case for a reason like lack of standing. Rather, he affirmed the International Court of Justice’s preliminary finding last week that it’s “plausible” that Israel is committing a genocide and said that U.S. officials should reconsider the deluge of weapons and military assistance that the U.S. is currently providing to Israeli forces.\n“The Court is bound by precedent and the division of our coordinate branches of government to abstain from exercising jurisdiction in this matter,” White wrote . “Yet, as the ICJ has found, it is plausible that Israel’s conduct amounts to genocide. This Court implores Defendants to examine the results of their unflagging support of the military siege against the Palestinians in Gaza.”\nThe historic lawsuit, brought on behalf of Palestinians against Biden officials by the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR), argued that the administration is in violation of international laws on genocide. CCR’s case included testimony from Palestinians in Gaza, with one plaintiff, Omar Al-Najjar, telling the court , “I have lost everything in this war. I have nothing but my grief. This is what Israel and its supporters have done to us.”\nRelated Story News | Human Rights ICJ Finds It’s “Plausible” That Israel Is Committing Genocide in Initial Ruling Advocates said that the ruling is a good first step, but it needed to include a ceasefire order. By Sharon Zhang , T ruthout January 26, 2024 Truthout CCR and legal experts said that, while the case was dismissed, it is notable that White’s findings are now on the record in the U.S. legal system, including his writing on the “undisputed evidence” presented in witness testimony and writings otherwise supporting the case for Israel’s assault being a genocide. Indeed, White’s acknowledgement of the ICJ ruling stands in sharp contrast to statements from other top U.S. officials, who have dismissed the ruling and instead sought to further punish Palestinians in Gaza in response.\n“Both the uncontroverted testimony of the Plaintiffs and the expert opinion proffered at the hearing on these motions as well as statements made by various officers of the Israeli government indicate that the ongoing military siege in Gaza is intended to eradicate a whole people and therefore plausibly falls within the international prohibition against genocide,” White wrote.\nCCR senior staff attorney Katherine Gallagher, who argued the case before the court, said that the group is committed to exhausting all legal options to stop Israel’s assault.\n“The court affirmed that what the Palestinian population in Gaza is enduring is a campaign to eradicate a whole people — genocide — and that the United States’ unflagging support for Israel is enabling the killing of tens of thousands of Palestinians and the famine facing millions,” Gallagher said in a statement . “While we strongly disagree with the court’s ultimate jurisdictional ruling, we urge the Biden administration to heed the judge’s call to examine and end its deadly course of action.”\nOne plaintiff, Mohammed Monadel Herzallah, expressed disappointment over the ruling. “It is important that the court recognized the United States is providing unconditional support to Israel’s ongoing genocide in Gaza and that a federal court heard Palestinian voices for the first time, but we are still devastated that the court would not take the important step to stop the Biden administration from continuing to support the slaughter of the Palestinian people,” Herzallah said. “Currently, my family lacks food, medicine, and the most basic necessities for survival.”",

    "text": "Spotify, a global streaming platform, says Nigeria’s Podcast listenership and gospel music streams have increased from 2022 to 2024 by 482 per cent and 1228 per cent respectively. Phiona Okumu, Spotify’s Head of Music, Sub-Saharan Africa, who disclosed this in a statement on Friday, said this was in celebration of Easter. Okumu said “the growth in Gen Z’s engagement with gospel content on Spotify is a testament to its growing popularity. “Spotify data reveals a significant rise in both podcast listenership and gospel music streams in Nigeria, “In Nigeria, podcast listenership has increased by 482 per cent and for gospel music streams, there is an increase of 1228 per cent. “For Kenya, we have increase in podcast listenership at 69 per cent and on gospel music streams, we have an increase of 365 per cent. “For podcast listenership in South Africa, we have an increase of 44 per cent and in Ghana, we have 85 per cent. “And for gospel music streams in South Africa, we recorded 288 per cent increase while in Ghana, there is a 329 per cent increase.” According to her, enthusiasm is further reflected in the creation of user-generated playlists. She said this had Nigeria boasting of over 140,000, South Africa surpassing 470,000, Kenya exceeding 70,000, and Ghana with more than 45,000 gospel playlists curated by Gen Z users. “Easter is upon us! This year, Spotify is creating a dedicated haven, an Easter gospel hub, “He is Risen” for all those seeking connection, spiritual enrichment, and joyful celebration. “It promises to be fun while also offering a spiritually ethereal experience for lovers of the Christian faith. “The Spotify Easter “He is Risen” hub is your one-stop shop for all things gospel. It is a treasure trove of playlists overflowing with lenten selections for quiet reflection, vibrant Christian and Gospel music from across Africa. “Individuals can dive deeper with a selection of enriching podcasts of sermons, bible study sessions, daily devotions and prayers from inspiring preachers that will fuel your faith journey and keep your spirit strong,” she said. 0 Comments [cancel reply](/life/nigerias-podcast-listenership-gospel-music-streaming-increase-by-482-1228-spotify/#respond) You must be logged in to post a comment.
