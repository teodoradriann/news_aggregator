    "text": "By Canadian Press on February 20, 2025.\nVICTORIA — The House Leader of the Opposition B.C. Conservatives has described the “unsurmountable” price paid by her family in the province’s toxic drug crisis, which she said had claimed the lives of three of her cousins and a niece.\nA’aliya Warbus said in question period in the B.C. Legislature on Thursday that she had lost two of her brothers, a niece and a nephew, but later clarified to reporters that the male relatives were all her first cousins.\nShe told the legislature that just last week she attended a memorial for one cousin who died from “a lethal dose of drugs” a year ago.\n“Not only did it take two of my brothers, but also my niece, who died alone in a tent, in one of the tent cities, from an overdose by herself,” she said in question period.\nA member of the Sto:lo Nation and the daughter of former lieutenant-governor Steven Point, Warbus paused at several points as she choked on her words.\n“Just last fall, we buried my 13-year-old nephew, because he found a wallet with drugs in it, which he did that night in his bed while his mom slept in the next room. And he was not an addict,” she said, before renewing calls for a public inquiry into what she called the “failed experiment of safe supply.”\nShe said family members of those who had died deserved a transparent and accountable public inquiry “to expose who knew what, when.”\nWarbus later said that she wanted to clarify her relationships with the family members, because “it’s hard for people on the outside to understand Indigenous families.”\n“I have 35 first cousins. We all grew up in one village, all close proximity, and so my brother, that is my first cousin. My other brother, that is my other first cousin, he’s just a year older than me, very close in age.”\nThe boy she had referred to as a nephew was also a cousin, she told reporters, but “these are my brothers.”\n“To me they are. The outside world might not see us that way, but they are,” she said.\nThe issue of the government’s safer-supply drug program, in which addicted people are prescribed alternatives to street drugs, has dominated debate in the B.C. Legislature which is sitting this week for the first time in nine months.\nOn Wednesday, the NDP government announced a major revamp of the program, converting it to a “witnessed-only” model in which users are watched as they consume prescribed opioids, instead of being allowed to take them away.\nOsborne said this was to prevent diversion of the drugs onto the street.\nHealth Minister Josie Osborne offered “sincere condolences” to Warbus, saying her experiences were “difficult to imagine.”\n“I want to acknowledge that this crisis has touched Indigenous Peoples in particular, in a very disproportionate way,” Osborne said.\nBut she said the safer-supply program had helped many people, and the government had to “act on evidence,” and it would continue with the program to get people the supports they need.\nWarbus said in an interview that she wanted to share her family’s story “to remind people that there are people behind the numbers that we look at every day and to really humanize that statistics and remember that these are lives we’re dealing with.”\n“This isn’t a currency. These people, my family, all of those lives, they’re not currency for people to use. It’s something that needs attention. It’s something that should break your heart. It’s something that is an injustice.”\nShe reflected on a text she received from her 14-year-old son earlier in the day, saying he wanted to go to a friend’s house.\n“I shouldn’t feel fear every time he says that, right? You shouldn’t, but I do, and he’s a good kid and he doesn’t get into trouble,” she said, adding that people don’t want to live in a society where a parent fears their child being exposed to drugs.\nWarbus said money needs to be put into helping people with addiction, trauma and other underlying causes to help them recover permanently.\nDuring question period, Warbus had said that one of her relatives died because the government “not only failed to stop the flow of fentanyl into our communities, they then inflated the market with so-called safe supply or safer supply.”\nDJ Larkin, executive director of the Canadian Drug Policy Coalition, said that “the data does not support that.”\n“That is conflating two things. The unregulated market of fentanyl, which includes analogues, benzodiazepines, tranquillizers, is what is driving people dying, and it tragic, and all of us are harmed by that,” Larkin said.\n“Safe-supply programs are not driving those deaths. The coroner data has been very clear on this that it is the unregulated drug market, not pharmaceuticals.”\nMore than 16,000 people have died in British Columbia since the toxic drug crisis was declared a public health emergency in April 2016.\nLast year’s death toll of 2,253 people was down 13 per cent, lower than any year since 2020.\nLisa Lapointe, B.C.’s former chief coroner, also said statistics show illicit fentanyl, not prescription alternatives, drive overdose deaths in the province.\nShe said last year’s figures show hydromorphone, which is most often prescribed as part of the safer-supply program, was detected in three per cent of overdose fatalities, and those deaths were not necessarily due to the drug.\n“That number has not gone up. It is a very low percentage present,” Lapointe said, adding that fentanyl was present in about 84 per cent of deaths.\n“If the allegation is that safer supply … pharmaceuticals are leading do death, they are not,” Lapointe said.\nOpposition Leader John Rustad has accused Premier David Eby and his government of “gaslighting” the province over the issue of safer supply and drug diversion.\nLast March, both the RCMP’s commanding officer in B.C. and then-solicitor general Mike Farnworth said there was no evidence of “widespread” diversion of prescription alternatives.\nBut earlier this month, a leaked Health Ministry briefing for police said a “significant portion” of opioids prescribed in B.C. were being diverted, and prescribed alternatives were being trafficked provincially, nationally and internationally.\nRustad took credit for Thursday’s policy shift, saying on social media that the government had “caved on one of Eby’s signature policy proposals.”\n— With files from Brenna Owen in Vancouver\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Feb. 20, 2025.\nMarcy Nicholson, The Canadian Press\n42",

The genre however can only persist if it is allowed to grow, and a significant component that makes that possible is competitors. The DCU's first chapter \"Gods and Monsters\" will contribute to the overall superhero genre, and series like The Boys have given subversive looks at the same ideas and themes . This trend continues with a new Netflix series.\nMarvel has had mixed success with television, but they appear to be working to correct this. With at least 12 MCU TV shows coming, it is essential that the studio reflect on what they have done right and wrong . Daredevil: Born Again went through a creative overhaul near the end of its production to ensure a final result that would engage audiences, showing that, when things aren't working, Marvel has recently been bold enough to go back and fix them, no matter the effort it takes. Following this, the MCU should take cues from other superhero series, including one on Netflix.\nRelated Every Marvel Cinematic Universe Movie Ranked Worst To Best Over 15 years and 33 movies, the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies have redefined blockbuster cinema. But how do all the films stack up?\n2 Netflix's Supacell Currently Has A 100% Rotten Tomatoes Score Close Supacell is a 2024 British superhero television series that has clearly resonated with critics, garnering a 100% Rotten Tomatoes critic score with 20 votes . The series has done well for the streamer since its release in June, and has been confirmed to receive a season 2. Telling the story of several Black South Londoners who suddenly gain superpowers and must avoid being captured by a shadowy organization, the series has gained steady viewership over its time on Netflix.\nWhile many critics have admitted that the general makeup of the series is not incredibly original, it is in its themes and execution that the show sets itself apart. Superhero stories are nothing new, but exploring themes of racial profiling and poverty through a unique lens sets this series apart. In addition, the show, created by Rapman, discusses sickle cell disease and its impact on individuals and their families. Using these links to real-world struggles helps to highlight Supacell as a series to look out for.\nSupacell (2024) Where to Watch stream rent buy Not available\nNot available\nNot available\n*Availability in US Supacell is a British superhero drama series that follows a group of ordinary Black Londoners who suddenly develop superpowers. The series explores the impact of their newfound abilities on their personal lives and the broader societal implications. Supacell blends action with social commentary, highlighting themes of empowerment and responsibility.\nCast Michael Salami , Eddie Marsan , Adelayo Adedayo , Tosin Cole , Eric Kofi Abrefa , Nadine Mills , Calvin Demba Release Date June 27, 2024 What The MCU Can Learn From Netflix's Supacell Close The MCU has been in a bit of a rut in recent years, attempting to expand the scope of its universe through enormous multiversal storytelling. Some of this has worked, allowing Deadpool & Wolverine 's excellent cameos , while other stories have not worked as well. Netflix could learn from the smaller, more specific stories of series like Supacell . Rather than everything being enormous, real, smaller, specific details of life should be allowed to be a part of the story. This helps audiences to connect more deeply.\nMarvel has done this on occasion, and it has worked from time to time. Ms. Marvel took a small-scale story of high-school experience and gave it a superhero gloss, which garnered much critical acclaim . However, this scope seems to have been abandoned with the character, with little of the human experience translating to the story of The Marvels . Following this, for the sake of engagement and connection, Marvel should be elevating components of its creators' voices and history. Using these connection points can help their series feel more compelling and engaging.\nThe MCU has been around for some time and has done an excellent job with keeping their audiences engaged. This has, however, required some level of reinvention through its many phases. Fortunately, the creators behind many of these projects, including Kevin Feige himself, are big fans of the superhero genre and tend to explore and appreciate other works from other studios . Looking at Supacell could provide some good lessons for the Marvel Cinematic Universe . Fortunately, the studio is likely already well aware of successes like these and is learning from them.\nMarvel Cinematic Universe The Marvel Cinematic Universe is a multimedia superhero franchise that began in 2008 with Paramount's Iron Man starring Robert Downey Jr. The franchise quickly grew in popularity, with Disney eventually buying out Marvel Entertainment in 2009. The MCU consists of dozens of movies and TV shows, most notably Avengers: Endgame, WandaVision, and Loki.\nCreated by Kevin Feige First Film Iron Man Upcoming MCU Movies\nCaptain America: Brave New World\nRelease Date February 14, 2025\nThunderbolts*\nRelease Date May 2, 2025\nThe Fantastic Four (2025)\nRelease Date July 25, 2025\nBlade (2025)\nRelease Date November 7, 2025\nAvengers: Doomsday\nRelease Date May 1, 2026\nAvengers: Secret Wars\nRelease Date May 7, 2027 Marvel Cinematic Universe Your changes have been saved\nEmail is sent\nEmail has already been sent\nclose Please verify your email address.\nSend confirmation email close You’ve reached your account maximum for followed topics.\nManage Your List Follow Followed Follow with Notifications Follow Unfollow Close Thread Sign in to your ScreenRant account We want to hear from you!

    "title": "La Jornada: El descenso de las religiones",
    "text": "El descenso de las religiones Gabriela Rodríguez E l porcentaje de religiosos en el planeta ha venido decreciendo, especialmente de católicos y cristianos. Al mismo tiempo, crecen rápidamente quienes no se identifican con ninguna religión. También desciende la atención a servicios religiosos, la frecuencia de rezar y la importancia de la religión en sus vidas, fenómeno conceptualizado como secularización. Europa occidental es menos religiosa que Estados Unidos, aunque el porcentaje de cristianos en el último país pasó de 78 a 63 en 15 años y de personas sin religión creció de 16 a 29 por ciento (de 2007 a 2022). Los países donde va tomando menor importancia la religión son España, Canadá, Australia, Holanda, EU, Gran Bretaña e Italia, entre otros; con un descenso medio de importancia a lo religioso se registran en Túnez, Francia, Sud­corea, Hungría, México, Sudáfrica y Argentina; y a menor velocidad descienden quienes se adscriben como judíos, islámicos, hinduistas y budistas. En contraste, opinan que el papel de la religión en sus sociedades se está incrementando en Indonesia, Nigeria, Kenia, Filipinas, India y Brasil.\nCerca de 85 por ciento de la población mundial se identifica con alguna religión; 15 por ciento no se adscribe a ninguna. Las religiones más populares son las cristianas –2 mil 38 millones (incluye católica, protestante y ortodoxa)–, la musulmana (más de mil 900 millones, y es muy probable que ésta alcance al cristianismo en 2050), hinduismo (más de mil 600 millones). El mayor nivel económico se correlaciona positivamente con el menor involucramiento religioso y con el descenso de las tasas de fecundidad, en las regiones altamente religiosas la población sigue creciendo. En África y Medio Oriente las mujeres tienen más hijos que en Europa, América o Asia Oriental. África Subsahariana es la región con el más rápido crecimiento poblacional y donde crecen más cristianos y musulmanes; éstos a mayor velocidad. No se cuenta con datos confiables de la religiosidad en China, pero su política de un solo hijo fue excepcional y redujo drásticamente la fecundidad ( Key Findings From the Global Religious Futures Project , Pew Reserch, 2022, World Population Review, 2023).\nEl panorama religioso de México ha cambiado mucho en el último siglo. Mientras en el censo de 1895 menos de uno por ciento de la población tenía una religión distinta a la católica, hoy 14.3 millones profesan una religión distinta a la mayoritaria y 13.3 millones se declaran sin religión o sin adscripción religiosa (ambos grupos suman 21.9 por ciento de la población). El aumento de personas sin religión casi se duplicó en los últimos 10 años: pasó de 4.7 a 8.1 por ciento (son más de 10 millones), 2.5 por ciento se identifican como creyentes sin adscripción religiosa (más de 3 millones). El descenso de católicos fue de 5 puntos; pasó de 82.7 a 77 por ciento, y aumentaron los protestantes, cristianos y evangélicos, de 7.5 a 11.2 por ciento; se adscriben como judaicas 58 mil 876 personas; a religiones con raíces afro, 40 mil 799; con raíces étnicas, 33 mil 372; 36 mil 764 espiritualistas, y 7 mil 982 islámicos. Las variaciones por edad son interesantes, en el rango de 25 a 29 años está el mayor porcentaje de quienes no profesan religión (5.9 por ciento de los hombres y 4.5 por ciento de las mujeres), en todos los credos las mujeres son más religiosas que los hombres. En siete entidades se concentra más de la mitad de la población ­mexicana sin religión: estado de México, Ciudad de México, Baja California, Chiapas, Veracruz, Nuevo León y Chihuahua. En la Ciudad de México no tienen ninguna religión 11.9 por ciento de jóvenes de 25 a 29 años (6.6 por ciento de hombres y 5.3 de mujeres), ni adscripción religiosa 8.6 de este grupo de edad; es, además, la entidad con la menor tasa global de fecundidad (1.4 hijos por mujer) y con la menor tasa de fecundidad de adolescentes: 45.3 nacimientos por cada mil adolescentes (Inegi, censos 2010 y 2020/ Conapo, Conciliación demográfica y proyecciones de población 2020-2050).\nAunque la religiosidad va descendiendo y crece la diversidad y la no adscripción religiosa, estos días los símbolos navideños rodean los entornos en los países de la región occidental, puesto que es cristiana una tercera parte de la población mundial, y porque ha sido una estrategia para aumentar el ­consumo.\nEscribió Émile Durkheim que “la educación es la influencia que ejercen las generaciones adultas sobre niños y jóvenes […] acto de imposición inevitable, pero necesario, pues sólo así es posible construir un nuevo ser, el ser social […] el Estado debe ser garante y responsable de la nueva educación que tendría que ser de un laicismo irrenunciable” ( Educación y sociología , Ed. Península, Barcelona, 1990). Celebro que la educación laica sea en México un derecho constitucional de niños y adolescentes desde 1917, y que el nuevo libro de texto de sexto grado de primaria, incluya ejercicios para respetar la igualdad de trato a todas las religiones y a promover la libertad de culto.\n* Secretaria general del Conapo\nX: Gabrielarodr108\nSubir al inicio del texto Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.",
