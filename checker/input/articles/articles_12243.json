    "text": "昨晚你有睡得好嗎？有沒有一個香甜的美夢？（圖片來源：Adobe Stock）\n熬夜工作到深夜，明明很困卻睡不著；綿羊一隻接一隻，數著數著天就亮了。是甚麼原因導致的呢？除了自身因素，臥室裡這7個擺設禁忌也可能會是吞噬你睡眠元兇！\n1、鏡子\n鏡子有反射光，這是一種不良的射線，會造成神經衰弱、睡眠質量差等不良反應。\n另外，關於鏡子對床的一些傳言，也讓很多人對晚上的鏡子有恐懼感，帶著這種感覺入睡，怎能睡得好呢。\n2、鬧鐘\n看見鬧鐘，本身就有一種壓力感，因為它到點就「爆發」。所以，床頭最好不要放那種物理鬧鐘，那種滴答聲，聲聲都是噪音。\n熟睡時，突然被大聲的鬧鐘叫醒，會引起身體保護性的條件反射，體內腎上腺素水平迅速提高，心跳加快，血管收縮壓升高。\n可以換個輕音樂的鈴聲，會緩解內心的緊張感。\n3、綠色植物\n很多人喜歡與自然共生，會在臥室床頭擺放綠色植物，例如吊蘭、綠蘿、風信子等等。但是，綠植在晚上，無法進行光合作用，會吸入空氣中的氧氣，釋放二氧化碳。但是這會導致人處於缺氧，不易進入深度睡眠，造成持續性疲勞。\n今晚你想睡得好嗎？那就避開上述禁忌試試。（圖片來源：Adobe Stock）\n4、電子設備\n想提高睡眠質量。一定要將帶屏幕的電子設備，如手機、平板電腦、電視等物品帶出臥室、遠離床頭。這些物品都會刺激你的大腦，讓你精神處於興奮狀態，入睡困難，心緒不寧。\n想睡個好覺，先遠離手機，讓大腦徹底「關機休息」，盡快進入深度睡眠。\n5、床和門相對\n臥室是讓我們卸下所有裝備，放鬆身心的空間，如果床正對著門，會讓人毫無私密性和安全感，覺得自己被一覽無遺了。\n睡覺的時候，門對著床，感受也不好。\n建議把床靠牆，最好不要90°正對著門。\n6、床頭有隔板、異物\n隔板不建議在床頭用。因為床頭背景這個位置取放東西很不方便，如果放置體積過大的物品，萬一掉下來，打到臉上或頭部的滋味都不好受。\n還有那種內凹型，擺放畫作的，也會不小心掉了、砸到頭，給醞釀睡眠的你當頭一擊，懊惱到失眠到天亮。\n床頭最好乾乾淨淨，啥也沒有，簡單，舒心。\n7、床頭擺濃烈的香水\n床頭擺香水實在不適宜。因為香水、香氛中含有800多種人工化合物，存在一定程度的刺激性，有鼻炎的還會過敏，連環噴嚏連連。\n空間安靜也包括氣味的溫潤、舒服。\n如果想要好氣味，可以在擴香石裡滴1～2滴薰衣草精油，這樣味道既不會太沖，還能有助於睡眠。\n責任編輯:笙歌\n短网址: 版權所有，任何形式轉載需本站授權許可。 嚴禁建立鏡像網站。\n【誠徵榮譽會員】溪流能夠匯成大海，小善可以成就大愛。我們向全球華人誠意徵集萬名\n榮譽會員：每位\n榮譽會員每年只需支付一份訂閱費用，成為《看中國》網站的\n榮譽會員，就可以助力我們突破審查與封鎖，向至少10000位中國大陸同胞奉上獨立真實的關鍵資訊， 在危難時刻向他們發出預警，救他們於大瘟疫與其它社會危難之中。",

    "title": "In baffling decision, Harvard excuses violence against student briefly disrupting Chinese diplomat’s speech",
    "text": "Table of Contents In baffling decision, Harvard excuses violence against student briefly disrupting Chinese diplomat’s speech Harvard is under well-deserved scrutiny for how administrators chose to dispense — or, more importantly, not dispense — disciplinary action against students involved in a disruption of a Chinese diplomat’s speech earlier this year. The incident occurred in April, when Chinese Ambassador to the United States Xie Feng spoke at Harvard Kennedy School’s China Conference, an annual event organized by the student group Greater China Society. Students for a Free Tibet and Coalition of Students Resisting China held a [demonstration](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2024/4/22/protestors-disrupt-chinese-ambassador-hks-talk/) outside the event with a few dozen protesters from the university and Boston. During Xie’s speech, six protesters disrupted the event, half of whom were Harvard students. Five left after being escorted out of the room — all but one by security staff — and one left of their own volition. Harvard undergraduate student Cosette Wu engaged in the most notable disruption of the speech. In an [incident](https://www.facebook.com/StudentsforaFreeTibet/videos/tibetan-and-taiwanese-harvard-student-activists-disrupt-chinese-ambassador-to-th/964137955307251/) that ultimately lasted less than 30 seconds, Wu stood up while Xie spoke, accused him of having hands “painted with blood,” and asserted that he had violated the freedoms of the people of Hong Kong and Taiwan. About ten seconds into Wu’s disruption, another attendee approached Wu and grabbed her arm with both hands, dragging her out of the event room and to a nearby security guard. Wu stumbled and appeared to resist his grip as she continued to yell at Xie. Wu ultimately did not press charges against the attendee who grabbed her, but Harvard Police [logged](https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/HRVD-HSC-00001.pdf) the attendee’s treatment of Wu as an assault. That attendee was reported by [The Free Beacon](https://freebeacon.com/campus/harvard-punished-a-student-for-disrupting-the-chinese-ambassador-the-chinese-national-who-manhandled-her-was-let-off-the-hook/) and [other outlets](https://www.aninews.in/news/world/asia/harvard-disciplines-taiwanese-american-student-for-disrupting-chinese-ambassadors-speech20241018175151/) as Zou Hongji. Harvard did not disclose his name, but confirmed he was a Harvard Graduate School of Education master’s student and member of Harvard’s Chinese Students and Scholars Association chapter. (CSSA chapters have been linked to a [number of](https://www.thefire.org/news/brandeis-panel-uyghur-muslims-faces-calls-cancellation-zoombombing) [attempts](https://www.thefire.org/news/pressure-continues-against-campus-critics-china) to tamp down on criticism of the Chinese government on college campuses.) He graduated shortly after the incident. Despite engaging in what the university confirmed was a violation of the graduate school’s Policy on Physical Violence, the attendee who dragged Wu faced no official sanctions. Instead, he ultimately received what looked more like an apology than a disciplinary warning. How did that happen? Documents reveal uneven enforcement of disciplinary policies On July 1, the House Select Committee on the CCP opened an [inquiry](https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/media/press-releases/moolenaar-questions-harvard-after-students-harassed-during-anti-ccp-protest) into the events, seeking information about Harvard’s handling of the violent response to Wu after the incident received attention on social media. The Select Committee also suggested an “event organizer approached” another protester and “sought the names of students who challenged the Ambassador.” The [documents](https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/media/reports/harvard-investigation-documents) from the investigation, released this month, shed some light on the incident. And Harvard does not come out looking favorably. First, the disruption. The three Harvard undergraduate students, including Wu, who briefly disrupted the speech were [placed](https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/HRVD-HSC-00228.pdf) on a three-day disciplinary probation by the Office of Academic Integrity and Student Conduct for “inappropriate social behavior,” though an administrative board subcommittee investigating the students had recommended only admonishment. The offenses will not appear on these students’ transcripts, but may be disclosed to graduate schools “under certain circumstances.” But the real shock is how Harvard absolved the disciplinary case against the graduate student who violently grabbed Wu and dragged her out of the venue. Harvard is once again facing sharp questions about its relationship with the Chinese government. It only has itself to blame. In an [email](https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/HRVD-HSC-00247_0.pdf) to dean Martin West shortly after the incident, an assistant dean notified West the Student Affairs office met with the graduate student, reported as Zou Hongji, who claimed to be “acting on the direction of a faculty member who indicated that they could not have those disruptions during the Ambassador talk.” The assistant dean also reported first being notified of the incident when the graduate student alleged that his family had been doxxed when video of it went viral and that the student sought “logistical and mental health support” from the university. In subsequent [emails](https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/HRVD-HSC-00249[78].pdf), West was unable to ascertain identifying information about the faculty member on whose orders the graduate student claimed to have acted. West did, however, reach a decision: He was ultimately “inclined not to refer the matter” to the Committee on Rights and Responsibilities, instead opting for a letter of censure, as “the internet has probably punished” the assailant “enough at this point.” And on May 22, West [confirmed](https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/HRVD-HSC-00252_0.pdf) in a letter to the assailant that he decided to impose no sanctions, even though video and police reports detail his behavior which West admits is “in violation of the [Harvard Graduate School of Education] Policy on Physical Violence” as well as other standards of conduct. The local impact of foreign censorship laws News For the last several years, FIRE has been covering the complex relationship between American higher education and global censorship. But given that the student “had received guidance from event organizers to intervene as you did” — ignoring that emails show that West could not confirm the existence of this guidance — West wrote that the assault was “understandable in that context.” Then, shortly after acknowledging that the student engaged in an act of violence against a protester’s brief disruption, West lamented his “deep[] regret” for the “significant harm” the student and his family have experienced in the aftermath of the incident. West also added that he was “grateful” to the student’s contribution to the master’s program and “sorry” the student wouldn’t be in attendance at the Commencement ceremony on campus to celebrate his accomplishments. So while Harvard ultimately chose to issue a harsher penalty than the investigating subcommittee recommended against the students who disrupted the Chinese ambassador, it chose to issue no penalty at all — and instead expressed its regret — to the student who, under Harvard policy, physically assaulted one of those protesters. How badly did Harvard mismanage these charges? As FIRE has stated at length over the years, [universities](https://www.thefire.org/news/heres-what-students-need-know-about-protesting-campus-right-now) must [respond](https://www.thefire.org/news/wake-robert-george-event-shoutdown-washington-college-vows-improve-response-disruptive) to [sustained](https://www.thefire.org/news/no-hecklers-veto-not-more-speech) [disruptions](https://www.thefire.org/news/moving-events-online-due-protests-still-hecklers-veto) — that is, actions beyond occasional fleeting remarks or comments that [render an event](https://www.thefire.org/cases/johns-hopkins-university-disruptors-successfully-execute-impermissible-hecklers-veto-yaf) unable to [proceed](https://www.thefire.org/news/campuses-reel-reminder-first-amendments-boundaries) as [planned](https://www.thefire.org/news/stanford-law-hecklers-demanding-free-speech-dont-know-what-theyre-asking). Depending on the circumstances and severity, appropriate responses may include action by campus police (who did remove protesters from the venue in this case) or subsequent disciplinary investigations into students allegedly involved, with the necessary due process protections afforded to the accused. (That has [not always](https://www.thefire.org/news/after-event-disruption-ucsd-doubles-down-charging-students-who-werent-even-there) been the case in these and other proceedings.) Appropriate responses to disruption most certainly do not include allowing — or, if true, directing — fellow students to physically assail disrupters and drag them out of the venue. Without knowing more about how Harvard has handled similar disruption cases, it’s difficult to ascertain whether the temporary probation issued to the three student protesters is in line with university policy or if this punishment is disproportionate. But the mismanagement of the charge against the graduate student looks fairly clear cut. And baffling, unless Harvard regularly apologizes to brawlers instead of punishing them. It’s deeply peculiar that Harvard not only rubber-stamped what it recognized to be a violation of institutional policies on violence but then apologized to the student responsible for the “significant harm” he had since experienced after videos of his behavior went viral. That’s a bizarro world conception of “harm.” It certainly looks like Harvard excused a politically-motivated act of violence against a protester, but treated the protester’s brief disruption more harshly than an investigating committee recommended. If there is a valid and appropriate justification for Harvard’s disparate handling of these disciplinary cases, it eludes me. Why is this significant? There is no specific evidence that Harvard acted the way it did because of the content of the protesters’ outbursts and the accusations they hurled against a high profile target from the Chinese government. But the university’s strange decision to allot punishment only to the victim of what it confirmed was an act of violence, rather than the perpetrator of that violence, does not paint the administration in a good light. This is not the first time I’ve found university administrations acting inappropriately around these issues, either — nor is it even the first time that these uncomfortable questions have been asked about Harvard and China. In 2015, Harvard Law School Vice Dean for International Legal Studies William P. Alford [pressured](https://www.thefire.org/news/report-harvard-law-school-administrator-canceled-2015-event-dissent-china) Chinese dissident and human rights lawyer Teng Biao to postpone an event he was planning at the campus because it could “[embarrass](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/4/23/harvard-china-scrutiny/)” Harvard and threaten its opportunities in China. The reason? Teng’s event would’ve overlapped with then-Harvard president Drew Faust’s trip to Beijing — where she was meeting Chinese President Xi Jinping. Emerson College Pooh-Poohs free speech: Deflecting criticism over censorship of ‘China Kinda Sus’ stickers, Emerson hides tweets critical of China’s government I’ll have a book out next year, \"Authoritarians in the Academy,\" detailing the many challenges authoritarian governments pose to freedoms in American higher ed and why Harvard is not alone in facing questions about its uncomfortable relationship with expression about China. Unfortunately, [this is an](https://www.thefire.org/news/george-washington-university-recants-promise-uncover-chinese-government-critics-after-artists) [industry](https://www.thefire.org/news/pressure-continues-against-campus-critics-china)-[wide](https://www.thefire.org/news/arrest-student-boston-grim-reminder-danger-facing-chinese-dissidents-campus) [problem](https://www.thefire.org/news/protests-are-sweeping-heavily-censored-china-how-will-american-institutions-respond) and it’s shown no signs of slowing. We don’t know all of the details for why Harvard acted the way it did, and the student conduct process can often be murky and opaque. But what we do know is that: 1) A protesting student briefly disrupted a Chinese diplomat’s speech, accusing him of having blood on his hands; 2) another student took it upon himself to manhandle the protester in what an academic dean confirmed was an act of violence in violation of university policy; and 3) the nonviolent offender got a black mark on her record while the student who resorted to violence received an apology for the reputational harm he had experienced. Harvard is once again facing sharp questions about its relationship with the Chinese government. It only has itself to blame.

    "text": "Une cinquantaine de familles sont restées sans abri au quartier Kambara à Kamanyola, dans territoire de Walungu (Sud-Kivu), à la suite des pluies torrentielles qui se sont abattues mardi 26 et mercredi 27 décembre dans la région. Des blessés graves et plusieurs dégâts matériels sont également enregistrés, alors que d’autres biens domestiques sont emportés par les eaux de pluie, indique la société civile. Le Gouvernement provincial a tenu un conseil de sécurité en urgence compte tenu de cette situation en ville et dans les territoires. Parmi des solutions envisagées, il y a l’appui aux victimes et le déguerpissement forcé des personnes sur ces sites impropres à la construction. En réaction à cette situation dramatique, le député national Olive Mudekereza demande aux autorités provinciales et aux futurs élus de faire de ce problème leur première préoccupation : « J’encourage que tous ceux qui seront élus prennent à cœur la cause du Sud-Kivu. Surtout l’aménagement et l’urbanisation des constructions anarchiques dans la ville de Bukavu. Nous ne devons pas continuer à compter des morts. J’espère que tous ceux qui seront élus dans la ville de Bukavu : Jeunes, vieux, nouveaux, anciens qu’ils prennent ce dossier en main et que le caucus du Sud-Kivu et les 32 du Sud-Kivu qui iront à Kinshasa prennent la province comme un bien commun » Le mercredi dernier, plus de 25 morts ont été enregistrés à la suite de fortes pluies dans plusieurs quartiers de la ville de Bukavu. Des habitations entières ont été emportées.",

MUMBAI: Director-actor Avinash Dhyani, who has helmed the upcoming film ‘VC 571’, has unveiled the first look from his film on Friday. He took to his social media handle to share the first look of the film which is set in World War I. The genre, labelled as an action-war drama, suggests a thrilling narrative that explores the heroism and sacrifices of war. Avinash serves as both director and lead actor in the film. Sharing his thoughts on the project, Dhyani shared: “In ‘VC 571’, we delve into the life of VC Rifleman Gabar Singh Negi, a revered figure from the Garhwal Rifles. This film is a tribute to the unsung heroes of World War I, and it's my way of bringing their stories to the forefront.\" Dhyani takes on multiple roles in the film, not just as the director but also starring as Gabar Singh Negi. The film also stars Aarti Shah and Virendra Saxena. The film's title, ‘VC 571’, is derived from the Victoria Cross number of Rifleman Gabar Singh Negi, a deliberate choice by Dhyani to pay homage to Negi's outstanding bravery. Avinash Dhyani stated that ‘VC 571’ is not just a film; it's a cinematic tribute that goes beyond the screen. As he navigates the challenges of independent filmmaking, Dhyani continues to lead his team, determined to bring the best out of himself and illuminate the heroic tales of the past. ‘VC 571’ is a joint venture of Padma Siddhi Films, Dream Sky Creations, and Alaska Motion Pictures.

    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Niagara County, New York from 1901-2000 was 28.5. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Niagara County, New York experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Niagara County, New York history.",

    "text": "Mesmo com a pausa pela Data Fifa, o Corinthians tem um motivo para comemorar: O clube receberá uma quantia milionária com a venda de um jogador que atuou com Endrick nas categorias de base.\nTrata-se do atacante João Costa, para o Al-Ettifaq, da Arábia Saudita. Ele estava na Roma, da Itália, desde 2022, e 20% dos direitos econômicos pertenciam ao Timão.\nO valor total da transferência foi de 9 milhões de euros (aproximadamente R$ 54 milhões). O Corinthians assegurou o valor liberando o atleta sem custos para o time italiano ainda na gestão de Duílio Monteiro Alves.\nJoão não chegou a entrar em campo com a camisa do Corinthians pela equipe principal, e, nas categorias de base também chegou a passar pelo Palmeiras, onde atuou com Endrick. Já na Roma, ele entrou em campo com a equipe na Liga Europa e no Campeonato Italiano.\nFinanças do Corinthians\nO balancete divulgado pelo clube até junho de 2024 apontava que o clube tinha um déficit de R$ 30,3 milhões. No orçamento para esta temporada, o Corinthians estimava ter um superávit de R$ 15,3 milhões, o que significa que o resultado foi de R$ 45,6 abaixo do previsto.\nIsso acontece, em boa parte, por conta das despesas financeiras, que envolvem o pagamento de juros e também multas contratuais como a dos técnicos Mano Menezes e António Oliveira e da ex-patrocinadora Pixbet. O clube estimava um gasto de R$ 43,6 milhões no semestre, mas ele foi acima do dobro: R$ 96,3 milhões.\nO Corinthians também lucrou menos do que o esperado com patrocínios, sendo esperados R$125,5 milhões contra R$ 105,3 milhões que foram recebidos.\nEm contrapartida, o clube teve um lucro operacional no semestre, de R$ 65,9 milhões. O resultado foi possível por conta da venda do meio-campista Gabriel Moscardo, já que, no total, o clube recebeu R$ 118 milhões com transferências de jogadores no semestre.",
