    "text": "New York: A prominent Hindu temple was vandalised with anti-India graffiti in the US state of California and the police are investigating the matter as a possible hate crime. The City of Newark Police Department in Newark, Newark, California said that on Friday at approximately 8:35 am, they received a report of graffiti at the Shri Swaminarayan Mandir Hindu Temple.Officers responded and met with temple leaders who described the vandalism as meant to intimidate them. “Based on the content of the graffiti it is believed that the defacement was a targeted act, and the vandalism is being investigated as a possible hate crime,” the statement said. The Consulate General of India in San Francisco strongly condemned the defacing of the temple. “We strongly condemn the defacing of SMVS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir at Newark, California with anti-India graffiti,” the Consulate posted on X. “This incident has hurt the sentiments of the Indian community. We have pressed for quick investigation and prompt action against the vandals by the US authorities in this matter,” the Consulate said. According to images posted on social media, the word ‘Khalistan' was spray-painted on a signpost outside the temple along with other objectionable graffiti. Newark police further said that any acts or threats of violence, property damage, harassment, intimidation, or other crimes motivated by hate or bias are considered very serious and given very high priority. This is not the first instance where a temple has been defaced with such graffiti in the recent past by Khalistani separatists. India has been asking its partner countries such as Canada, the UK and the US to not give space to \\\"extremist Khalistani ideology\\\". Khalistan supporters have increased their anti-India activities after the death of Canada-based Khalistan Tiger Force (KTF) chief Hardeep Singh Nijjar. India's consulate in San Francisco in July came under an attack from Khalistan supporters who tried to set the diplomatic facility on fire. The vandalism of the temple in Newark came close on the heels of allegations of an Indian official's involvement in a conspiracy to assassinate a separatist Sikh leader in the US. The Indian official has been linked by American prosecutors to an individual accused of conspiring to assassinate Sikh separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun in the United States. India has expressed concern over the matter and stated that appropriate action will be taken following the conclusions of an investigative panel examining the allegations.",

GVMC Commissioner P Sampath Kumar received the award on the occasion of Mahatma Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October from Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu in Vijayawada. Speaking on the occasion, the Commissioner stated that it was a pleasure to receive the coveted award for Visakhapatnam at the state level from the Chief Minister. This award is dedicated to the people of Visakhapatnam, who contributed in taking up various cleanliness drives, he added. As part of Swachhata Hi Seva (SHS) programme, the GVMC officials succeeded in involving people in maintaining cleanliness programmes organised under the slogan of ‘Swachhata Sanskar’ held from September 17 to October 2 in Visakhapatnam. Last month, Visakhapatnam district collector MN Harendhira Prasad along with Additional Commissioner DV Raman Murthy and other district officials launched the SHS. To encourage citizen participation in the endeavour, a selfie booth was set up at RK Beach on September 18. The role of public representatives, government and private organisations, voluntary organisations, women’s associations, resident welfare associations, NGOs, educational institutions, youth, and sanitation workers contribute to the achievement of the civic body. Also, in the banner of ‘ek ped maa ke naam’, the Commissioner addressed the public through radio and exhorted the people to extend support to increase green cover in the city to 50 percent from the present 28 percent. © 2024 Hyderabad Media House Limited/The Hans India.

    "text": "Financial markets have become more susceptible to liquidity shortages with the rise of algorithmic trading and increased market fragmentation, according to the Bank for International Settlements. The institution analyzed 25 years worth of high-frequency trading data across asset classes in the US, Europe and Japan and concluded that markets have become more fragile even as liquidity on average improved. The BIS said sudden bursts of wild price swings and flash crash events are more frequent now, and the main reasons for that are the advance of electronic trading and the increased market fragmentation. Equities in particular have become more splintered, as evidenced by traditional exchanges significantly losing market share, the researchers said. “Market participants are navigating a sea that is often much calmer than in the past but one that is also increasingly prone to sudden and significant storms,” the BIS said in a working paper published on Friday. Broad economic and geopolitical events also contributed to episodes of illiquidity, during which traders face abnormally high execution costs, the BIS said. Researchers also found equity and government bond markets were particularly vulnerable to liquidity shortages. Foreign-exchange trading, meanwhile, proved more resilient potentially due to measures taken to curb unwanted behavior from high-frequency traders.\",",

    "text": "ALBANY, Ga. (WALB) - A simulated airplane crash into an Albany Technical College building provided disaster training for Albany firefighters and emergency response teams. A fire and victims were staged, all part of that training.\nThis training is required every three years by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), but this was the first year EMS got to train with an aircraft simulator brought in from Minnesota.\n“I’ve never seen something with such a large-scale carnage. It was great for the employees of the city just to experience what it’s like to be prepared for detrimental situations,” said Perry Ford, a volunteer victim.\nA total of 30 staged victims participated in the Plane Drill on Wednesday. (walb) Albany Airport Police Chief Gary Ethridge said while the training was a success, his biggest takeaway was that communication between all mutual aid needs to be improved.\n“The communication was a problem, but of course that’s what we’re going to work on to improve,” he said.\nRight now, Albany Airport emergency personnel are made up of 10 people. The department is triple certified in law enforcement, firefighting, and aircraft rescue firefighting.\nAccording to the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association , accidents in Georgia are down 21 percent so far this year. Ethridge said the last major plane crash in Albany happened 10 years ago, but that’s not stopping them from updating disaster resources.\n“We’re looking at hopefully two new crash trucks in the very near future,” he said.\nOnce the new vehicles are purchased, they will transition from Aqueous Film-Forming Foam to Fluorine-Free Foam. The foam is used in aircraft firefighting. Experts say the Aqueous Film-Forming Foam is environmentally friendly.\nWhile there hasn’t been a plane crash or accident here at the Albany airport in several years, emergency personnel are hoping that this training can keep them prepared for the unexpected.\nHave a news tip or see an error that needs correction?
