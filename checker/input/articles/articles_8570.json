    "title": "Can I track GPS without internet?",
    "text": "Can I track GPS without internet?\nYes, it is possible to track GPS without an internet connection. GPS tracking on your mobile device can work even without internet connectivity or a cellular service. As long as you have a charged smartphone with you, you can use GPS to find your way around remote areas and foreign landscapes.\nHow can I track my GPS offline?\nTo track your GPS offline, follow these steps:\n1. Download a map to use offline: On your Android phone or tablet, open the Google Maps app. Make sure you’re connected to the internet and signed in to Google Maps. Search for a place, like San Francisco. At the bottom, tap the name or address of the place and tap “More Download offline map”.\nDoes GPS work if the phone is off?\nNo, GPS does not work if the phone is off. When you turn off your phone, you deactivate all of its functions, including wireless communication. GPS tracking relies on the phone’s ability to communicate with satellites and provide location information.\nCan I use an old phone as a GPS tracker?\nYes, you can use an old Android phone as a GPS tracker. All you need is the right app and configuration. By repurposing your old phone, you can easily turn it into a dedicated GPS tracker without the need for additional hardware.\nCan GPS tracker work without a SIM card?\nYes, GPS trackers can work without a SIM card. There are GPS loggers available that only record GPS data. You can later download and view the GPS data by connecting the logger to your computer. These GPS loggers do not actively track real-time location.\nDoes GPS work without internet?\nYes, GPS works without an internet connection. GPS navigation does not rely on an internet connection but rather on GPS satellites that provide location information to your device. However, for certain features such as map data and points of interest, you may need internet connectivity.\nHow can I use GPS on my phone without internet?\nTo use GPS on your phone without internet, follow these steps:\n1. Enable the Google Maps Offline feature on your Android or iOS device.\n2. Ensure that you are connected to the internet and not in Incognito mode.\n3. Open the Google Maps App on your device and go to the Google settings menu.\n4. Tap on “Security” and look for the option labeled “Find My Device” or “Find My Phone”. Enable this feature.\nWhat SIM card is needed for a GPS tracker?\nFor GPS trackers, M2M (Machine-to-Machine) SIM cards are typically used. These SIM cards are designed for devices that need to send and receive data across cellular networks. They provide data connectivity for GPS trackers and allow them to transmit location information.\nIs it illegal to track someone with a GPS?\nIn most cases, it is illegal to track someone with a GPS without their consent. Laws prohibit individuals from using electronic tracking devices to determine the location or movement of a person without proper authorization. There may be exceptions for registered owners, lessors, or lessees of vehicles.\nIs it illegal to put a tracker on a phone?\nYes, it is illegal to put a tracker on a phone without proper authorization.

Look for the option labeled “Find My Device” or “Find My Phone” and enable it.\nCan someone track my location with my phone number?\nUnfortunately, yes. If someone has access to your phone number, they can track your location. They can use various methods, such as cell tower triangulation or GPS, to determine your exact location. It is difficult to determine if your phone is being tracked or monitored without your knowledge.\nWill airplane mode hide my location?\nNo, airplane mode will not hide your location. If your phone has GPS capabilities, anyone with access to your GPS data can still track your location even if your phone is in airplane mode. To hide your location, you would need to disable the GPS feature on your phone.\nWill removing SIM card stop tracking?\nRemoving the SIM card from your phone will not stop tracking if a GPS tracking device has been installed. GPS tracking devices are separate from the SIM card and rely on GPS satellites to track the device’s location. However, removing the SIM card may affect the device’s ability to transmit location data.\nDoes Google Maps GPS work without internet?\nYes, Google Maps GPS can work without an internet connection. While certain features, such as real-time information and updates, require an internet connection, the GPS navigation itself does not rely on internet connectivity. GPS satellites provide the location information that is used to plot your location and provide directions.\nWhat is the best offline map for France?\nFor offline maps in France, you can use mobile mapping apps like Google Maps, Here WeGo, and Navmii. These apps allow you to download maps for offline use, so you don’t need an internet connection to navigate and find your way around. Make sure to download the maps of the specific regions or cities you’ll be visiting in France.\nIs there a sat nav for phones that doesn’t use data?\nYes, there are sat nav apps available for phones that don’t require an internet connection or data usage.

    "text": "The city of Jesus’ birth has canceled its annual Christmas celebrationsa out of respect for the ongoing siege of the Gaza Strip, nearly three months into the war between Israel and Hamas.\nBethlehem – or Beit Lechem, located in what is now the Israeli-occupied West Bank – is typically flooded with pilgrims and other celebrants in late December.\nThis year, however, the festivities are pared back to a nativity scene at the Evangelical Lutheran Christmas Church of an infant Jesus wrapped in a keffiyeh, surrounded by rubble, NPR reported.\nA similar installation will also be placed in Manger Square before Sunday, which is Christmas Eve.\nMeanwhile, the Church of the Nativity – which dates back to the sixth century – included razor wire and tarp-wrapped figures in its nativity scene.\nThe church is practically empty as the usual 6,000 daily visitors that descend on Bethlehem at Christmastime has trickled down to less than 1,000 in one month, the Washington Post reported.\nThe mournful mood was the joint decision of multiple Palestinian Christian leaders, who came together last month to cancel the public celebrations in light of the war in Gaza.\nAs a result, the usual parade of 28 Boy Scout troops accompanying the Latin Patriarch’s procession into the city will be reduced to one, silent troop holding Bible verses on peace and possibly photographs of Gazan children, the Washington Post added.\nThe scaled-down holiday comes just one year after Christmas returned to Bethlehem in full-swing in 2022, following two years of curtailed festivities due to COVID-19.\nChristian leaders in Bethlehem have vocally condemned Hamas’ surprise terror attack on Israel on Oct. 7, which killed about 1,200 people and saw at least 240 others taken hostage.\n“We condemn the brutal attacks of Hamas on October 7th that caused the loss of life of nearly 1,400 Israelis and citizens of other nations, and we call for the immediate release of all civilians held hostage,” a group of Bethlehem clerics wrote in a letter to President Joe Biden last month.\nHamas’ atrocities, however, did not justify what the group called the “collective violence” against civilians in Gaza, who have now been under siege from Israel’s military for almost three months, the letter read.\n“It’s impossible to celebrate when so many — on both sides — have lost so much,” Rami Asakrieh, a Franciscan friar and pastor of St. Catherine’s Church, told the Washington Post this week.\n“We canceled the festivities as a sign of solidarity with the victims of the war,” Asakrieh, who signed the letter to Biden, explained.\nIn his annual Christmas speech, Bethlehem Mayor Hanna Nanania slammed Israel’s retaliatory bombardment of Gaza as “genocide” and “ethnic cleansing,” the Washington Post said.\nThe head of the local chamber of commerce, Samir Hazboun, also criticized what he called the “moral failure of the West” to curtail the killing of Gazan civilians, the outlet continued.\n“If Jesus were born today, he would be born in Gaza amid the rubble,” the Rev. Munther Isaac, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Christmas Church, said while standing over his church’s rubble-strewn nativity.\n“Who can sing ‘Joy to the World’ today?” he lamented, adding that the story of Jesus’ birth in a stable after his parents – Mary, and her husband Joseph, a Jewish man living under Roman rule – are unable to find lodging is “a story we Palestinians can understand.”\nWhile the usual religious and festive activities have been scaled far back, traditional mass will still be read to mark the major Christian holiday, Asakrieh told the Washington Post.\nWashington Post",
