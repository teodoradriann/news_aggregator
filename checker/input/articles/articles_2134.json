    "title": "3 takeaways from Minnesota’s season-opening loss to North Carolina",
    "text": "In a game where offensive possessions were highly offensive to those watching in the stands and at home, North Carolina was able to mount a second-half comeback and win its opener against Minnesota on the road.\nThanks to 4 second-half field goals and some stout run defense, the Tar Heels overcame a 7-point halftime deficit to beat Minnesota in Minneapolis, 19-17.\nHere are 3 takeaways from the game.\nNorth Carolina pass game exits with even more questions It wasn’t for the lack of a ground game. Carolina tailback Omarion Hampton ran for 129 yards — his 10th career game going over the century mark on the ground. Still, North Carolina was unable to get its pass game off the ground.\nHeading in, coach Mack Brown hinted that both quarterbacks — Texas A&M transfer Max Johnson and Conner Harrell — would play in the game as UNC tried to determine who gave it the best chance to win. Instead, it was Johnson running the show.\nBut he completed 12 of his 19 passes for 71 yards before being forced out of the game with an injury late in the third quarter. Johnson had several gaffes, and a 3.7 yards-per-pass average is brutal. But when Harrell entered the game full-time, UNC played it ultra-conservative.\nHarrell threw just 3 passes in the fourth quarter while the Tar Heels ran it 8 times in a game that was far from decided. The Tar Heels were gifted a turnover and starting field position at the Minnesota 22 with 11 minutes to play in a 1-point game. They managed to go backward and settled for a field goal.\nHarrell finished 2-for-4 for 34 yards. On a third-and-5 deep into the fourth quarter, North Carolina kept the ball on the ground rather than trying to throw for the first and settled for another field goal.\nBecause Minnesota’s kicker missed 2 of his 3 kicks on the night, that decision proved the safest option, but it also felt like a statement of sorts on the level of trust in the pass game with Harrell at the controls.\nIn his lone start last season, Harrell threw for 207 yards against West Virginia in Carolina’s bowl game, but he was picked off twice in a 30-10 loss. If Johnson misses any extended time and Harrell is tasked with running the show in the interim, how does the offense evolve? If Johnson is able to brush off what looked like a serious injury and return quickly, he’ll need to be better than he was Thursday night as well.\nCarolina opened the post-Drake Maye era with a win that had nothing to do with its quarterback play.\nMax Brosmer delivers on final drive A transfer up from the FCS level, Brosmer took some time to settle into a groove, but you saw the potential on Minnesota’s final drive of the night. Brosmer fired deep to Daniel Jackson on the first play of Minnesota’s final possession and drew a pass interference penalty that moved the ball from the 25 to the 40. On the very next play, he hit Elijah Spencer for 20 yards and a first down with an absolute dime.\nBrosmer let the ball go before Spencer came out of his break. And Brosmer put it through traffic and hit a small window. The broadcast noted at the time that was the kind of play a coaching staff hopes to see when it signs a senior quarterback and they were exactly right.\nBrosmer added 9 more yards on a second-and-12 to get Minnesota to right around the 30-yard-line and set up a potential go-ahead field goal.\nHe finished the game 13-for-21 for 166 yards. Brosmer didn’t throw a touchdown pass, but he also wasn’t picked off. Jackson was held to 55 yards on 4 receptions. Marcus Majors, filling in for the unavailable Darius Taylor, had 73 yards and a score on 20 carries. Had Taylor been in the lineup, Minnesota may have had better luck with the ground game (just 78 total yards on the night at 2.4 a carry).\nThe hope was that Brosmer, a former FCS All-American, would provide an upgrade at quarterback over last year’s play. He gave Minnesota a chance to win in the fourth quarter. How does Brosmer look with Taylor in the backfield next to him?\nMinnesota fails at the little things Brosmer aside, the final possession for Minnesota was a mess.\nAfter 3 successful plays to open the drive, a blatant holding penalty wiped away a 14-yard run that had Minnesota in the red zone and backed it up to the UNC 42. A pass short of the sticks on second-and-12 kept the clock running and Minnesota — reluctant to use its final timeout — wasted several seconds setting up a third-down running play. After a 4-yard run from Jordan Nubin and a spike, Minnesota had the ball at the UNC 29 with 9 seconds to play and a timeout in hand.\nRun it to the middle of the field, fall down, call a timeout, and kick the game-winner.\nInstead, Minnesota ran the ball to the right hash and then pushed its field goal attempt wide right.\nHad the ball been in the middle of the field, the 47-yard attempt from Dragan Kesich would have been good.\nKesich also missed a 27-yard kick in the first quarter. North Carolina’s Noah Burnette made all 4 of his field goal tries, including 2 in the fourth quarter to win.\n(UNC’s special teams as a whole were very sound. Punter Tom Maginness had 3 punts that averaged 51 yards and, on 1 occasion, pinned Minnesota at its 2-yard-line.)\nThe Gophers finished with 6 penalties. They gave up 5 sacks and 7 tackles for loss. They fumbled it twice, losing 1 of them. They went 4-for-12 on third down. And their clock management in the fourth quarter was questionable at best.",

    "text": "Um grave acidente envolvendo um carro e uma carreta resultou em uma verdadeira tragédia na rodovia BR-262. As duas vítimas dessa colisão eram um pai e sua filha. A jovem de 22 anos estava conduzindo o veículo. O acidente ocorreu na manhã de quinta-feira (28), nas proximidades do município de Miranda, localizado a cerca de 200 km de Campo Grande, capital do estado do Mato Grosso do Sul. Pai e filha vieram a óbito O delegado Daniel Dantas, da Delegacia de Polícia Civil de Miranda, confirmou que as vítimas que estavam no veículo formavam uma família. O pai e a filha, que estavam nos assentos dianteiros, morreram no local do acidente. No banco traseiro, estavam a mãe e duas crianças, um menino de 9 anos e uma bebê com pouco mais de um ano. A mulher foi resgatada em estado grave e transferida com máxima prioridade para uma unidade hospitalar em Campo Grande. As crianças foram levadas para uma unidade de saúde em Miranda. Os nomes das vítimas, que supostamente são originárias de um estado diferente, não foram divulgados publicamente. Autoridades estiveram no local do acidente Quanto à sequência do acidente, o delegado confirmou que há indícios de desrespeito à sinalização de pare em uma parte da estrada. Inicialmente, a informação da Polícia Rodoviária Federal (PRF) sugeria que o Tiguan, onde a família se encontrava, foi atingido por um caminhão. Supõe-se que o veículo tenha ingressado na BR-262 sem obedecer à sinalização, ocasionando a colisão com o veículo de carga. Diversas equipes, incluindo Perícia, Polícia Civil, PRF e Corpo de Bombeiros, foram acionadas para o local.",

    "text": "Inclusivity and the environment key to Outsider Awards nominations for a Wicklow Tidy Towns group\nVolunteers from Blessington Tidy Towns received a nomination at the Outsider Awards 2023 for their commitment to fostering environmental interest and inclusivity in west Wicklow over the past year.\nAs one of 17 Wicklow nominees in this year's Outsider Awards, which celebrates the remarkable achievements of the Irish outdoor community, Blessington Tidy Towns stands out in the 'Diversity and Inclusion’ category.\nThe volunteer-led community group has made significant strides in promoting community engagement, adding to their work through well-known initiatives such as the national Tidy Towns Competition, ‘2MinuteStreetClean’, and the ‘Big Beach Clean’.\nIn recent years, the group has broadened its outreach to newer community members, including those recently relocated to the area, individuals displaced from Ukraine, and those under International Protection.\nIn 2023, the group initiated an informal English chat to encourage connections with individuals from diverse backgrounds, focusing on supporting Ukrainians, new Irish residents, and various nationalities involved in their weekly litter picks.\nSpeaking ahead of the awards night at The Sugar Club in Dublin on February 21, Jason Mulhall from Blessington Tidy Towns expressed his pride in the nomination, saying: “It is great to be nominated and recognised for the work we have done over the last year.\n“Quite a few people from the Ukrainian and other communities are working with Tidy Towns, including people from accommodation in the Avon and Kippure Lodge.\n“We’re working closely with the Volunteer Centre in Wicklow, where Fiona Downes has been putting us in touch with people who want to volunteer with us.”\nBlessington Tidy Towns collaborated with Wicklow Partnership’s SICAP Coordinator to set up the informal English classes, which have proved hugely beneficial.\n“The English classes were set up informally, with volunteers from Tidy Towns meeting in the library, breaking off into small groups, and engaging in conversations to help people with their English without creating a formal setting,” Jason explained.\n“We're also working on a new Pure Mile project where members of our Ukrainian community will take ownership of an area, and we will support them and make sure they have everything they need.\n“It is something the group can own and run with themselves, and will give them a great sense of achievement from establishing and having ownership over an initiative in the community.”\nAmong the other Blessington Tidy Towns initiatives highlighted by Outsider judges is their inspirational work with Blessington Community College in assisting in establishing a Youth Environmental Council.\n“The group has officially become a Gaisce ‘Challenge Partner,’ showcasing a particularly fruitful relationship set to continue bearing fruit,” Jason said.\n“One of the things the judges mentioned, which we are all very proud of, is the work of Blessington Community College, who have established a Youth Environmental Council and are very active.”",

    "title": "Deploying a Static Web Application Using AWS S3 and CloudFront - DEV Community",
    "text": "In the realm of modern web development, deploying static web applications efficiently and securely is crucial. AWS(Amazon Web Services) offers a powerful combination of S3 and CloudFront that simplifies and optimizes this process. In this guide, we'll walk through the steps to deploy a static react web application using the S3 and cloudfront, then we will use code build to automate its deployment. Amazon S3: Amazon Simple Storage Service(S3) is a highly scalable, secure, and durable object storage service. It's an ideal solution for hosting static web content like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and more. CloudFront: AWS CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service that accelerates the delivery of your web content globally. It distributes your content through a network of edge locations to reduce latency and enhance user experience. [ ](#steps-to-deploy) Steps to Deploy: 1. Create React App: - Let's create the react app named \"deploy-app\" using the following command: npx create-react-app deploy-app - Move to the folder: cd deploy-app - Build the react app using: npm i npm run buildthis will create a folder /build at root that can be serve to access the app. 2. Upload to Github: - Create the repo \"delpoy-app\" on your github. - Add the buildspec.yaml and place the below content in it in your local code(this will be used later in this tutorial) version: 0.2 phases: pre_build: commands: - echo Installing node packages - npm i build: commands: - echo Build started on `date` - npm run $ENV post_build: commands: - aws s3 sync build/ $BUCKET_NAME - aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id $DISTRIBUTION_ID --paths '/*' Push the local changes on github using the following commands: git init git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/deploy-app.git git add . git commit -m 'added buildspec.yaml for automation' git push origin main 3. Create AWS S3 bucket: On AWS console move to S3 and create bucket, - Select AWS region - Enter the Bucket name - Uncheck the \"Block all public access\" leave the rest of the settings default and press Create Bucket Once it is created then select \"Properties\", scroll down to bottom, \"Edit\" the static website hosting and set the below settings and press \"Save changes\", Then, select \"Permissions\", then \"Edit\" the Bucket policy, add the following content(remember to update the BUCKET_NAME) and Save Changes, { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Sid\": \"PublicReadGetObject\", \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Principal\": \"*\", \"Action\": \"s3:*\", \"Resource\": [ \"arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET_NAME/*\", \"arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET_NAME\" ] } ] } 4. Attach Cloudfront with S3: To access the static content from S3 with high speed and less latency we will attach the cloudfront with S3 bucket. To do so, move to Cloudfront from AWS console. - Press the \"Create Distribution\" - Copy the static url from the s3 bucket properties and place it in the origin domain for cloudfront. Don't forget to remove the https:// from the s3 bucket static url. Then, select the Redirect HTTP to HTTPS and set the Allowed HTTP methods: Then press \"Create Distribution\" Once the distribution is created, you will be able to access the react app on Distribution domain name: - Don't forget to add Invalidator in cloudfront distribution. It is used to replicate the new changes on all egde locations so that we can get the latest data from S3 bucket. - You can also add the custom domain in alternate domain name and a certificate if you want to. If you do so, you also have to add the CNAME record in your DNS as well. For this, Please refer to, [https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cloudfront-extensions/en/distribution-management/ssl-certificates/add-record-for-cname/](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-cloudfront-extensions/en/distribution-management/ssl-certificates/add-record-for-cname/) 5. CodeBuild for deployment on S3: To automate the deployment process for react app whenever the code is pushed in particular on the github we can use the CodeBuild pipeline. Let's automate this process for \"main\" branch. - On AWS console move to CodeBuild. - Press Create build project. - Enter the name for project. - Add source(in our case it will be github) and connect your repository and select the branch. - Then enable the \"webhook and add the following settings\" so that whenever the code is pushed to the main branch this pipeline gets triggered. - Create a Service Role and also add the \"CloudFrontFullAccess\" permission in this IAM role once the role is created. This will be needed to create the invalidator. - In Addition Configurations add the following Environment variables that are being used in buildspec.yaml we created above. - Press \"Create build project\" - Once it is created press \"Start Build\". This will get the latest code from main branch, build the project, sync the build folder with s3 bucket and create the invalidator. Now, whenever there will be a new commit in github repo in main branch this pipeline will trigger that deploy the latest code to s3 bucket. Happy Learning...",

    "title": "La OMS confirma el primer caso humano de encefalitis equina occidental en Argentina",
    "text": "Buenos Aires, 28 Dic. (EUROPA PRESS) – La Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) ha informado de que el pasado 20 de diciembre el Punto Focal Nacional del Reglamento Sanitario Internacional (CNE) de Argentina les notificó un caso humano de infección por encefalitis equina occidental (EEO), el primero confirmado después de más de dos décadas en la región. Los últimos casos humanos reportados en Argentina ocurrieron en 1982 y 1983 asociados a un brote en equinos y, un tercero, en 1996 del que señalan se trató de un caso aislado basado en hallazgos clínicos y serológicos pero sin detectar casos equinos. El paciente desarrolló síntomas como dolor de cabeza, mialgias, mareos, desorientación y fiebre súbita el 19 de noviembre de 2023. El 24 de noviembre de 2023, el paciente recibió atención médica y fue hospitalizado en un centro de salud de la provincia, donde requirió cuidados intensivos y ventilación mecánica durante 12 días. El paciente fue dado de alta el 20 de diciembre y se encuentra en seguimiento ambulatorio. En cuanto al historial de exposición, según información de la investigación epidemiológica, el paciente es un trabajador rural de una zona donde previamente se habían identificado equinos que dieron positivo a infección por EEO. Las muestras de sangre dieron positivo el 19 de diciembre de 2023 en la detección de anticuerpos neutralizantes específicos del virus EEO. Mientras que dieron negativo para otros alfavirus: virus de la encefalitis equina del este (EEE), virus de la encefalitis equina venezolana (EEV), virus Una, virus Mayaro y virus Chikungunya. ¿Qué es la encefalitis equina occidental? La EEO es una rara enfermedad viral transmitida por mosquitos que afecta a equinos y humanos. La mayoría de los casos humanos están asociados con epidemias en aves o caballos. En humanos, el virus EEO puede causar enfermedades que van desde síntomas subclínicos o moderados hasta formas graves de meningitis y encefalitis asépticas. El virus tiene el potencial de propagarse a otras áreas mediante la migración de aves infectadas o incluso mediante el movimiento de personas y animales portadores del virus. Dado que las aves actúan como reservorio, pueden actuar como huéspedes amplificadores para la diseminación viral a otros países. Los grupos de riesgo incluyen personas que viven, trabajan o participan en actividades al aire libre en áreas endémicas o donde se declaran brotes activos de enfermedades en animales. Los brotes de EEO en humanos generalmente se presentan como casos aislados con síntomas moderados y la mayoría de las infecciones son asintomáticas. Las manifestaciones neurológicas incluyen meningitis, encefalitis o mielitis. Al igual que otras encefalitis por arbovirus, la encefalitis causada por EEO se caracteriza por fiebre acompañada de alteración del estado mental, convulsiones o signos neurológicos focales, incluidos trastornos del movimiento. No existe un tratamiento antiviral específico y el manejo del paciente implica principalmente medidas de atención de apoyo. En Argentina, entre el 25 de noviembre y el 27 de diciembre de 2023, se han identificado un total de 1182 brotes de enfermedad EEO en equinos en 12 provincias del país: Buenos Aires (717), Santa Fe (149), Córdoba (141), Entre Ríos (69), Corrientes (41), Chaco (19), La Pampa (18), Río Negro (n11), Formosa (8), Santiago del Estero (6), San Luis (2) y Salta (1).",
