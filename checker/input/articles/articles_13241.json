    "title": "Pokémon TCG Pocket players horrified to learn how much you'll spend completing the set",
    "text": "One very determined [Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket](https://www.gamingbible.com/pokemon) player has figured out exactly how much money you’ve got to spend to complete your card collection… by spending a frankly exorbitant amount of money.\nShout out to [Ethan Dean over on Dexerto](https://www.dexerto.com/pokemon/pokemon-tcg-pocket-player-finds-out-how-much-money-it-takes-to-collect-a-full-set-2987280/) for the original source!\nOver on the r/PTCGP subreddit, Reddit user Weens4Life has been walking Pokémon TCG Pocket players through the process of successfully collecting every single card in the game, and what they had to spend to pull it off.\nAdvert\nIn a thread titled “[Obtaining Every Card, Info for Spenders and Collectors](https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gv5o44/obtaining_every_card_info_for_spenders_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)”, Weens4Life broke down all of their findings.\n“I have collected every card,” they explained. “It cost $1500 to do so.”\n“Completing the base card dex costs about $200. It took opening 1741 packs and collecting 8582 cards. There is no reward for doing this.”\nAll I can say is, yikes.\nAdvert\n$1,500. For our British readers, that’s roughly £1,200. You could almost buy two PlayStation 5 Pros with that.\nSo, a few things we should probably clear up here. First things first, don’t do this.\nSecondly, the $1,500 Weens4Life spent to achieve this isn’t a fixed sum. There’s obviously a lot of chance involved in opening packs in Pokémon TCG Pocket.\nThis could end up costing you half the amount if you were lucky. It could also end up costing you twice the amount if you weren’t. Don’t gamble kids.\nAdvert\nAnd finally, while Weens4Life’s set may be complete now… it won’t stay that way for long.\nPokémon TCG Pocket will be adding new cards at the end of December. Plus, The Pokemon Company [has a big update planned](https://www.gamingbible.com/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-major-update-675486-20241114) for the start of 2025 that will undoubtedly introduce even more packs.\n“Completing” Pokémon TCG Pocket is a temporary achievement. There will always be new cards to collect, and more money to spend doing so.\nOpen a savings account. Donate to a charity. Order a pizza and spend way too much money getting every single topping on it. Do literally anything else but spend over a grand on a mobile game, I beg of you.\nTopics: [Pokemon](/pokemon)",

In the past the FSFE accepted money from Microsoft less explicitly than this ([since 2020](/o/2020/04/16/fsfe-microsoft/)).

[Tomás Soucek](/soccer/player/_/id/230666/tomas-soucek) opened the scoring on 13 minutes, but the goal survived a lengthy check as replays suggested the ball may have gone out as [Jarrod Bowen](/soccer/player/_/id/201089/jarrod-bowen) pulled it back from the byline to create the chance. - [Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)](/espnplus/fixtures/_/type/upcoming/categoryId/119cfa41-71d4-39bf-a790-6273a52b0259/channel/ESPN_PLUS) With the goal given by on-field referee Michael Oliver, there was insufficient evidence from the available camera angles to conclusively determine whether it had left the pitch, replicating a similar incident which saw [Anthony Gordon](/soccer/player/_/id/268782/anthony-gordon)'s strike in the Gunners 1-0 loss at [Newcastle United](/football/team?id=361) in September stand amid Arsenal's protests. Arteta successfully fought a Football Association charge following comments he made in the aftermath of Gordon's goal and the Gunners boss struck a more conciliatory tone after his side missed out on a chance to go top of the [Premier League](/football/league/_/name/ENG.1) as [Konstantinos Mavropanos](/soccer/player/_/id/242705/konstantinos-mavropanos) sealed West Ham's victory with a 55th-minute header. \"I haven't seen it, [but] they're saying it's not conclusive,\" said Arteta. \"It's a shame that with the technology that we have, that it's not that clear so that we can say whether it's out or in. It's done. It's gone. There's nothing we can do about it now. \"If the technology we have at the moment is not good enough to give us that answer, what we have to do is without that win the game. With the number of situations we generated in the game, that should have been more than enough.\" Arsenal had 30 shots and ended with an Expected Goals figure of 2.68 after registering 77 touches in West Ham's box -- a record for a team failing to score in a Premier League game since Opta records began in 2008. \"It is what it is,\" added Arteta. \"We have to try to generate. If we don't score with 30 shots, then we have to do 50 or 60 to try to score. That's the only thing. I can't imagine a game where we have more touches in the box, more dominance and less situations for the opponent against a really good West Ham side. Today though, it wasn't enough to win the game.\" Meanwhile, West Ham boss David Moyes celebrated his first league win away at Arsenal, [Chelsea](/football/team?id=363), [Liverpool](/football/team?id=364) or [Manchester United](/football/team?id=360) in 73 attempts by hinting he could soon hold discussions over a new contract. Moyes, whose existing deal expires at the end of the season, said: \"We are getting ready to talk. I don't think any of us are getting it done too quickly. I don't see any problems with that.\"",

    "title": "Heatstroke Claims 61 Lives in Thailand Amid Record-Breaking Heatwave - VnExpress International",
    "text": "A wave of exceptionally hot weather blasted Thailand in recent weeks, prompting authorities to issue warnings about scorching hot weather on a near-daily basis. The health ministry said Friday that 61 people have died from heatstroke since the beginning of 2024, compared with 37 in the whole of 2023. Thailand's northeast -- the agricultural heartland -- saw the highest number of deaths, the ministry said. Scientists have long warned human-induced climate change will produce more frequent, longer and more intense heat waves. While the El Nino phenomenon is helping drive this year's exceptionally warm weather, Asia is also warming faster than the global average, according to the United Nations' World Meteorological Organization. Apichart Vachiraphan, deputy of Thailand's Department of Disease Control, warned people with underlying medical conditions to limit their time outdoors. The kingdom this year experienced a delay in its monsoon season, with sweltering hot weather lasting longer than normal. Storms have hit parts of the kingdom this week, lowering temperatures but bringing warnings from the authorities of potential flash flooding. In April, the kingdom recorded a temperature of 44.2 degrees Celsius (111.6 degrees Fahrenheit) recorded in the northern province of Lampang -- just shy of the all-time national record of 44.6 C hit last year.",

    "title": "Exclusive: Recordings, emails show how Trump team flew fake elector ballots to DC in final push to overturn 2020 election - Local News 8",
    "text": "By Marshall Cohen, Zachary Cohen, Jeremy Herb and Katelyn Polantz, CNN\n(CNN) — Two days before the January 6 insurrection , the Trump campaign’s plan to use fake electors to block President-elect Joe Biden from taking office faced a potentially crippling hiccup: The fake elector certificates from two critical battleground states were stuck in the mail.\nSo, Trump campaign operatives scrambled to fly copies of the phony certificates from Michigan and Wisconsin to the nation’s capital, relying on a haphazard chain of couriers, as well as help from two Republicans in Congress, to try to get the documents to then-Vice President Mike Pence while he presided over the Electoral College certification.\nThe operatives even considered chartering a jet to ensure the files reached Washington, DC, in time for the January 6, 2021, proceeding, according to emails and recordings obtained by CNN.\nThe new details provide a behind-the-scenes glimpse of the chaotic last-minute effort to keep Donald Trump in office. The fake electors scheme features prominently in special counsel Jack Smith’s criminal indictment against the former president, and some of the officials who were involved have spoken to Smith’s investigators.\nThe emails and recordings also indicate that a top Trump campaign lawyer was part of 11th-hour discussions about delivering the fake elector certificates to Pence, potentially undercutting his testimony to the House select committee that investigated January 6 that he had passed off responsibility and didn’t want to put the former vice president in a difficult spot.\nThese details largely come from pro-Trump attorney Kenneth Chesebro, who was an architect of the fake electors plot and is now a key cooperator in several state probes into the scheme. Chesebro pleaded guilty in October to a felony conspiracy charge in Georgia in connection with the electors’ plan, and has met with prosecutors in Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin, who are investigating the sham GOP electors in their own states.\nChesebro is an unindicted co-conspirator in the federal election interference indictment against Trump.\nCNN has obtained audio of Chesebro’s recent interview with Michigan investigators, and exclusively reported earlier this month that he also told them about a December 2020 Oval Office meeting where he briefed Trump about the fake electors plan and how it ties into January 6.\nAn attorney for Chesebro declined to comment. A spokesman for the special counsel’s office did not reply to a request for comment for this story.\n‘A high-level decision’\nEmails obtained by CNN corroborate what Chesebro told Michigan prosecutors: He communicated with the top Trump campaign lawyer, Matt Morgan, and another campaign official, Mike Roman, to ferry the documents to Washington on January 5.\nFrom there, Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and a Pennsylvania congressman assisted in the effort to get the documents into Pence’s hands.\n“This is a high-level decision to get the Michigan and Wisconsin votes there,” Chesebro told Michigan prosecutors. “And they had to enlist, you know, a US senator to try to expedite it, to get it to Pence in time.”\nChesebro also discussed the episode with Wisconsin investigators last week when he sat for an interview with the attorney general’s office as part of a separate state probe into the fake electors plot, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.\nWisconsin prosecutors asked about the episode “extensively,” the source said, noting Chesebro discussed how a Wisconsin GOP staffer flew the certificate from Milwaukee to Washington and then handed it off to Chesebro.\nThe firsthand account from Chesebro’s perspective helps fill in the narrative behind the effort to hand-deliver elector slates to Pence, which is vaguely referenced in Smith’s federal indictment.\nTrump pleaded not guilty to the charges, which include conspiring with Chesebro and others to obstruct the January 6 certification proceeding. Before Chesebro’s guilty plea in Georgia, his attorneys reached out to Smith’s team. As of this week, he has not heard back from federal prosecutors, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.\nFederal investigators have spoken with several individuals involved in the scramble with the phony elector certificates , according to a source familiar with the matter. This includes interviews with Trump staffers who were tapped to fly the papers to DC, and some fake electors who knew of the planning.\nA spokesperson for the Trump campaign did not reply to a request for comment.\nAsked about the episode, a spokesperson for Johnson pointed to his previous comments , where he said, “my involvement in that attempt to deliver spanned the course of a couple seconds,” and that, “in the end, those electors were not delivered.”\n‘Day-by-day’ coordination\nAccording to the recordings of Chesebro’s sit-down with Michigan prosecutors, he explained how a legal memo he wrote for Wisconsin transformed into a nationwide operation , where Trump lawyers were “day-by-day coordinating the efforts of more than a dozen people with the GOP and with the Trump campaign.”\nOn January 4, 2021, Morgan sent an email to Chesebro and Roman asking for confirmation that all of the Trump elector slates had been received by Congress, according to the documents obtained by CNN.\nRoman responded that the Michigan certificate had been mailed on December 15 but was still “in transit” at a US Postal Service facility in DC. Wisconsin’s certificate also had apparently not arrived.\nChesebro told prosecutors that Morgan was “freaked out” when the campaign realized the phony certificates from Michigan were still in the mail.\nThat same day, Morgan weighed in over email asking Chesebro and Roman to rethink how they would deliver the certificates to Pence.\n“As I thought about this more, a courier will not be able to access the Capitol to deliver a sealed package,” Morgan wrote on January 4, according to emails obtained by CNN “You will probably need to enlist the help of a legislator who can deliver to the appropriate place(s). I strongly recommend you guys discuss a revised delivery plan with Rudy (Giuliani) to make sure this gets done the way he wants.”\n‘Can we charter a flight?’\nRoman was concerned the Wisconsin documents wouldn’t reach Washington in time.\n“Can we charter a flight? The only available commercial from MKE (Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport) to DCA (Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport) arrives at 2130 tomorrow night,” Roman wrote to Chesebro on January 4 at 11:24 p.m.\nThe job of physically flying the elector documents to Washington fell to two people: A Trump campaign staffer and a Wisconsin GOP official, according to the emails and what Chesebro told prosecutors.\nThe Wisconsin GOP official who had that state’s elector documents landed after 10 a.m. on January 5 at Baltimore-Washington International Airport, according to the emails.\nTrump campaign aide Michael Brown flew with the Michigan certificates to Washington National Airport with a scheduled arrival around 1 p.m., according to emails obtained by CNN. A source familiar with the matter told CNN that Brown flew to DC from Atlanta, because the Trump staffers who had custody of the Michigan ballots were in Georgia for the Senate runoffs .\nThe campaign booked and paid for Brown’s flight on Southwest Airlines, the source said. Federal campaign finance records indicate that a pro-Trump super PAC paid the airline on the day of Brown’s flight for travel related to election “recount” efforts.\nTrump Hotel meetup\nThe emails show that Brown and the Wisconsin GOP official were instructed to meet Chesebro at the Trump International Hotel in downtown Washington to hand off the fake elector certificates. Chesebro said in an email that he’d keep the ballots in his hotel room safe until it was time to pass them along.\nWisconsin Republican Party officials were annoyed at the request to courier the fake elector certificates to Washington. “Freaking trump idiots want someone to fly original elector papers to the senate President,” a Wisconsin GOP official wrote to then-state party chairman Andrew Hitt on January 4, according to the January 6 committee report.\nHitt – who has provided information to federal investigators about the efforts to get the fake elector certificates to Washington, according to a source familiar with the matter – told the January 6 committee that the couriering ended up being overkill, because the original documents that the state party had mailed to Washington actually made it in time.\nGetting the certificates inside the Capitol\nThe documents still had to be hand-delivered to Pence’s Senate office in the Capitol.\nThe electors plot – as envisioned by Chesebro and other Trump allies – was that Pence could reject Biden’s legitimate electors and recognize Trump’s “alternate electors” on January 6, while lawmakers tallied the electoral votes from each state. Per federal law, the certificates need to be physically presented on the floor of Congress during the joint session, while lawmakers tally the electoral votes.\nChesebro told investigators that Roman connected him with an aide for a Pennsylvania GOP lawmaker that he believed was Rep. Scott Perry to turn over the documents. Chesebro wasn’t certain which congressman the staffer worked for – and the January 6 report says a staffer for a different Pennsylvania Republican, Rep. Mike Kelly, helped shuttle the documents that day.\n“I had the Wisconsin stuff. [Trump campaign aide] Mike Brown had the Michigan stuff. We walked to the Longworth Office Building, and the guy with Perry, or whatever his name is, and some other fellow, that were like staff members of the House, took them and said, ‘We’re going to walk them over to the Senate and give it to a Senate staffer,’” Chesebro told Michigan prosecutors, according to the audio obtained by CNN.\n“I don’t know why logistically we didn’t take it directly to Johnson. But that’s how we did it,” he added.\nKelly and Perry’s offices did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment.\nBrown did not comment for this story. CNN previously reported that he testified in June to Smith’s grand jury in the Trump election subversion probe.\nCNN previously reported that Roman sat for a proffer interview with Smith’s team before Trump was indicted. He was also indicted in the sweeping Georgia election racketeering case, in connection with the fake electors scheme, and has pleaded not guilty.\nRoman’s attorney did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\nThe details from Chesebro put a finer point on how members of Congress, including a sitting US senator, were involved in making sure the electoral certificates for Trump ended up in Pence’s hands.\nThe January 6 committee first revealed last year Johnson’s involvement in trying unsuccessfully to deliver the fake elector certificates to Pence, who announced on the morning of the joint session that it would be unconstitutional to do what Trump wanted and unilaterally overturn the election results.\nThe committee revealed text messages during their hearings last year that Johnson aide Sean Riley sent to Pence aide Chris Hodgson, saying that Johnson “needs to hand something to VPOTUS please advise.”\n“What is it?” Hodgson asked.\n“Alternate slates of electors for MI and WI because archivist didn’t receive them,” Riley responded.\n“Do not give that to him,” Hodgson said.\n‘F**k these guys’\nIn his Michigan interview, Chesebro also dished on some of the internal disagreements among the Trump lawyers, campaign officials and other allies, who clashed over the purpose of the electors’ plan and how far to take things on January 6.\nChesebro has maintained – then, and now – that the plan was a lawful move to preserve Trump’s legal rights.\nEven before the Trump electors met in their state capitals on December 14, 2020, to cast their fake ballots and sign the certificates, Chesebro heard about concerns from some of the electors about possible legal jeopardy, according to emails and text messages reported by the Detroit News and obtained by CNN.\nChesebro added hedging language for the faux certificates from Pennsylvania and New Mexico in response to those concerns. He proposed to Roman and Morgan that they add the contingency caveats to the paperwork for all seven states in the plan. But Roman rejected the idea, according to the emails.\n“F**k these guys,” Roman texted Chesebro on December 12, 2020.\nBy this time, the Trump campaign had essentially cleaved in two. Top officials who had managed day-to-day activity for Trump up to the election, including in court, say they ceded responsibility to Rudy Giuliani and others, such as Chesebro, according to congressional testimony transcripts. Roman effectively switched teams to work under Giuliani’s structure, according to the testimony from Morgan and others.\nA spokesperson for Giuliani did not reply to a request for comment.\n‘It really went south on me’\nChesebro told Michigan investigators that his own emails show that Morgan remained deeply involved, including in the final hours before January 6, to ensure that the certificates reached DC.\n“I don’t have a really warm feeling toward, at least, the top Trump lawyers that did this, hid from me what they were doing and then lied to Congress about me. So, it’s been really difficult,” Chesebro said.\nIn his congressional testimony, Morgan said he knew of the elector plan but wanted to distance himself from the effort, delegating the work to others, including those under Giuliani.\nMorgan told the January 6 committee last year that he initially believed the electors were only meant to be used as a contingency. The electors, he believed, should meet in their state capitals and cast their electoral votes but “not necessarily submit” the certificates to Congress unless “we prevailed” in court.\nMorgan told the committee that the plan changed in December, saying it morphed from a “cast-and-hold” operation and had “shifted to cast-and-send.” And that’s when Morgan told the committee that he backed out, testifying that he directed an aide to “email Mr. Chesebro politely to say, ‘this is your task. You are responsible for the Electoral College issues moving forward.’”\n“This was my way of taking that responsibility to zero,” Morgan told the committee, later adding that he “moved on” after that email was sent.\nMorgan explained that he was concerned that the new plan to try to count the fake electors on January 6 “would make the Vice President’s life harder, and I didn’t want to be a part of that.”\n“Mr. Morgan stands by his congressional testimony,” his defense attorneys told CNN in response to his emails and Chesebro’s statements to investigators.\nUltimately, on the eve of the joint session of Congress, Morgan helped get the ballots in place, according to the emails and according to Chesebro, who blamed his legal troubles squarely on the Trump campaign’s legal team.\n“I could have avoided all this,” Chesebro vented to Michigan prosecutors. “It’s been a real lesson in not working with people that you don’t know and are not sure you can trust, because it really went south on me.”\nCNN’s Avery Lotz, Annie Klingenberg, Fredreka Schouten contributed to this report.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

    "text": "Dunas de sacrificio: La fórmula de un municipio costero de Castellón para protegerse de los temporales invernales La idea es mantener estas dunas en las playas hasta la llegada de los turistas de Semana Santa El Ayuntamiento de Torreblanca ya ha levantado las primeras dunas en su litoral con el objetivo de proteger sus playas de los efectos que provocan los temporales invernales. El equipo de Gobierno inició ya los trabajos el pasado mes de diciembre y ya se empiezan a ver los cordones dunares en algunos puntos de la costa del municipio. La alcaldesa, Tania Agut, ha estado supervisando esta semana los trabajos en el terreno junto con el diputado provincial responsable del Consorcio de Bomberos, David Vicente Segarra, y el concejal de Sostenibilidad Ambiental, Joel Antoni, para comprobar la evolución de estas barreras de tierra que ayudan a evitar la erosión marina del litoral y que los temporales se lleven la arena de las playas. Tania Agut ha querido “agradecer a la Diputación de Castellón y al Consorcio de Bomberos su decisiva colaboración, con medios personales y materiales, para levantar estos cordones dunares y así evitar la erosión de la costa de Torreblanca. En diciembre ya comenzamos a amontonar arena por todas las playas y ha sido esta semana cuando hemos empezado a levantar las dunas que permitirán proteger nuestra costa ante posibles temporales este invierno”. Hay que tener en cuenta que el Ayuntamiento de Torreblanca realiza las dunas de sacrificio un año más para proteger sus playas de los esperados temporales marítimos durante los meses de enero a abril. Las dunas de sacrificio son montones de arena alineadas al borde de la costa y acumuladas en pequeñas montañas para que, en caso de temporal, la playa no se vea afectada. Ya en función de cómo evolucionen las alertas por temporales, se prevé que en el mes de marzo se desmonten estas dunas protectoras y se vuelva a repartir la arena para que en Semana Santa, que este año cae muy pronto, estén las playas en buenas condiciones de uso para los vecinos del pueblo y los visitantes.",
