    "text": "G4S workers outside Whitehall (Photo: Alan Kenny)\nSecurity guards at government departments in the heart of London are on strike over their rotten pay and conditions. There is a defiant mood on the picket lines with speeches, music and support from other trade unionists.\nThe strikers in the PCS union work at the Cabinet Office, Department for Business and Trade and Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT).\nSpeaking to Socialist Worker, one striker said, “Everyone enjoys the picket lines. The music makes a big difference.\n“The union has tried to raise the voice of people who aren’t supported by anyone. We have had PCS reps come down to support us from the DSIT department. They understand why we are picketing.”\nThe strikers work for private company G4S. There were calls for the firm to be banned from bidding for government contracts after it failed to provide enough security staff for the London Olympics in 2012. But G4S is once again winning security contracts and keeping workers in poverty.\nThe striker said, “It’s a government building, it’s taxpayers’ money they are using and we are there to protect a government building but they outsource the security services to the lowest bidder. I think taxpayers need to understand what is happening in government buildings.”\n“We are not asking for everything, just basics such as sick pay and reduced working hours. We are working 72 hours in a week, 12 hours a day and six days a week. We are suffering. We don’t have a family life or a social life.\n“They are exploiting the workers when they should work with people.\n“It’s the same outsourcing that is happening everywhere, in hospitals and universities.”\nThe strikes are starting to have an effect. “They are bringing in inexperienced people to cover for us but there has only been the minimum cover needed to keep the building open.”\nThey plan to be out again on strike again from 9-13 December and are asking for wider support.\n10 South Colonnade, London, E14 5EA, 10 Victoria Street, London, SW1H 0NB, Old Admiralty Buildings, London, SW1A 2EG, 22-26 Whitehall, London, SW1A 2EG, 70 Whitehall, London, SW1A 2AS (Note this picket line starts at 7am) Send a solidarity donation to the PCS fighting fund with the reference “GPA FM Disputes”—Account Name: PCS Fighting Fund Levy, Account Number: 20331490, Sort Code: 60-83-01 Send a message of solidarity to outsourcedworkers@pcs.org.uk",

    "text": "Spain’s Weather: A Comedy of Waters and Warnings Well, well, well! If it isn’t yet another classic episode of “How to Ruin Your Holiday in Spain” starring Mother Nature! This week, Spain decided to up the drama with a tempest that left us all thinking that maybe, just maybe, someone up there has it in for the Spanish coastline. Based on robust reports, the latest influx of rain has resulted in catastrophic flooding, serious warnings, and let’s not forget, the death toll has risen to a staggering 205. Quite the unfortunate tally for a get-together in the sun, wouldn’t you say?\nThe Precipitation Predicament According to the Irish Mirror , the government of Ireland has sent out urgent alerts to its citizens. I mean, can you imagine the panic? “Quick! Grab your armbands, we need to float our way back to Emerald Isle before it becomes the ‘Emerald Archipelago!’”\nWhy the Weather is Behaving Badly Now, let’s sprinkle some scientific insight on this downpour. As the fine folks at the BBC have extensively covered, scientists suggest that our warming world has turned the dial up on good old DANA (which stands for ‘isolated depression of low atmosphere’ – sounds like a terrible party guest, right?). This pesky phenomenon has essentially wet the Spaniards’ appetite for more rain, making storms more intense and Mother Earth a bit of a diva. “I just wanted a sprinkle,” they said. And now they’re wading through rivers that used to be streets!\nLet’s Get to the Point of DANA Livescience.com gets into the nitty-gritty: DANA isn’t your run-of-the-mill weather pattern – it’s like that quirky artist no one quite ‘gets’ at shows but everyone pretends to praise. This strange weather phenomenon dutifully demonstrates the power of Mother Nature, who seems to be equal parts magnificent and mischievous. Deadly flooding? Check. Storm lockdowns over the long weekend in Mallorca? Check. It’s like the weather wants to make sure no one has any fun unless it’s under two feet of murky water.\nThe Aftermath: Troops to the Rescue With disaster at their doorstep, the Spanish government has mobilized extra troops as the waterworks continue. According to The Guardian , these dedicated individuals are mightily swinging into action. Can you imagine the sheer chaos? Soldiers with rubber boots navigating through flooded towns, someone yelling “Halt!” whilst trying to save a puppy. As predictions of even more rainfall loom, this is shaping up to be quite the spectacle!\nConclusion As we watch all of this unfold, one can’t help but admire the resilience of the Spanish. “Rain, floods, troops? Bring it on!” they seem to say. In a twist of humor, it’s not just the weather getting soaked this week; so are the hopes for a dry day by the beach. Grab your umbrellas, folks. It’s going to be a wet one out there. Remember: When life gives you floods, make a canoe… or start building an ark! After all, you never know when DANA will decide to crash your party again!\nSpain floods: Following catastrophic weather conditions, the nation has issued a multitude of red weather warnings, with the Irish government also responding with urgent alerts, indicating a regional concern for extending effects. Irish Mirror Scientists attribute the intensified storms in Spain to the phenomenon of climate change, underlining how a warming planet may have exacerbated the severity of these recent weather events. BBC.com DANA, an unusual weather phenomenon, has played a crucial role in the recent devastating flooding across Spain, raising questions about its impacts and the factors that contribute to such extreme weather conditions. Livescience.com In the wake of the tragic floods in Spain, the death toll has tragically soared to 205, prompting authorities to mobilize additional troops to assist in ongoing rescue and recovery efforts across affected regions. The Guardian Amidst the turmoil, Mallorca finds itself under stringent storm lockdown measures for the long weekend, as authorities strive to ensure the safety of residents and tourists against the escalating weather threats. Majorca Daily Bulletin\nThe recent​ catastrophic ⁤weather conditions ‍in‌ Spain⁤ have been marked​ by extreme rainfall and⁢ flooding, largely attributed to the phenomenon known⁢ as DANA (isolated depression of low⁢ atmosphere). This unusual‍ weather pattern has⁤ intensified storms and ⁤caused havoc, ‌leading to drastic measures from the Spanish government, including the deployment of extra troops to assist in flood relief‌ efforts. Following this disastrous turn of events,⁣ experts emphasize how climate change ⁢may be exacerbating these severe weather occurrences.\nUnderstanding DANA DANA is not just another weather‍ occurrence; it is a significant atmospheric phenomenon ‌that poses unique challenges and risks. Its primary role seems to amplify rainfall, transforming tranquil areas into flooded landscapes almost overnight.​ The⁤ implications of ⁢DANA ⁣extend beyond ⁢inconvenience, as it can lead ​to devastating⁢ flooding, loss⁢ of property, disruptions in everyday life, and even casualties.\nThe Immediate‌ Response In​ light of the‍ flooding crisis, the Spanish government’s mobilization of troops⁣ underscores the urgent need for rescue and relief operations. These​ efforts aim to provide assistance in flooded ‍areas, ‌navigate​ through ​treacherous conditions, and ensure the safety of ⁢affected residents. Emergency response teams, including soldiers equipped ​with necessary tools, ‌have become vital in maintaining ⁢order ⁤and providing aid amidst chaos.\nFuture Implications As⁢ Spain‍ grapples ‌with the aftermath of‍ the recent storms, ⁤there is growing concern about the potential for similar events in the future. With climate change ‍being⁤ a significant factor linked ​to​ these intensified⁢ weather ⁢patterns, ⁢scientists emphasize the⁣ importance⁤ of proactive responses to adapt to an increasingly unstable climate. This includes investing in ​infrastructure, improving ⁣flood management systems,‌ and⁢ engaging⁤ communities around preparedness for extreme weather scenarios.\nConclusion The ⁣situation in Spain serves as a stark reminder of the challenges posed⁢ by climate variability⁤ and extreme weather ​phenomena like DANA. As communities adapt to these changes, resilience ​will⁤ be key ⁢in navigating the complexities of modern weather‌ patterns. ​Ultimately, the⁢ interplay between natural events and human response will shape our collective future in an era marked ‍by climate challenges.\nScientists attribute the⁣ intensified storms in Spain to the phenomenon of climate change, underlining how a warming planet ⁢may have exacerbated the severity of these recent weather events.

    "text": "Saltwater flooding is a serious fire threat for EVs and other devices with lithium-ion batteries Published in [News & Features](/currentnews/newsheadlines/) Flooding from hurricanes Helene and Milton inflicted billions of dollars in damage across the Southeast in September and October 2024, pushing buildings off their foundations and undercutting roads and bridges. It also caused dozens of electric vehicles and other battery-powered objects, such as scooters and golf carts, to catch fire. According to one tally, 11 electric cars and 48 lithium-ion batteries caught fire after exposure to salty floodwater from Helene. In some cases, these fires spread to homes. When a lithium-ion battery pack bursts into flames, it releases toxic fumes, burns violently and is extremely hard to put out. Frequently, firefighters’ only option is to let it burn out by itself. Particularly when these batteries are soaked in saltwater, they can become “[ticking time bombs](https://myfloridacfo.com/news/pressreleases/press-release-details/2024/10/07/fire-safety-alert-cfo---state-fire-marshal-jimmy-patronis-calls-on-ev-manufacturers-to-take-steps-to-protect-lives-for-milton),” in the words of Florida State Fire Marshall Jimmy Patronis. That’s because the fire doesn’t always occur immediately when the battery is flooded. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, [about 36 EVs flooded by Hurricane Ian](https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/2024-02/16180-NSR-231214-003_SAE_Teardown%20Analysis%20of%20Flood-damaged%20Evs-tag.pdf) in Florida in 2022 caught fire, including several that were being towed after the storm on flatbed trailers. Many consumers are unaware of this risk, and lithium-ion batteries are widely used in EVs and hybrid cars, e-bikes and scooters, electric lawnmowers and cordless power tools. I’m a [mechanical engineer](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DOuTvN0AAAAJ&hl=en) and am working to help solve battery safety issues for our increasingly electrified society. Here’s what all owners should know about water and the risk of battery fires: The trigger for lithium-ion battery fires is a process called thermal runaway – a cascading sequence of heat-releasing reactions inside the battery cell. Under normal operating conditions, the probability of a lithium-ion cell going into thermal runaway is [less than 1 in 10 million](https://www.accessengineeringlibrary.com/content/book/9781260115925). But it increases sharply if the cell is subjected to electrical, thermal or mechanical stress, such as short-circuiting, overheating or puncture. Saltwater is a particular problem for batteries because salt dissolved in water [is conductive](https://www.sciencing.com/salt-water-can-conduct-electricity-5245694/), which means that electric current readily flows through it. Pure water is not very conductive, but the electrical conductivity of seawater can be [more than a thousand times higher](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/swamp/docs/cwt/guidance/3130en.pdf) than that of fresh water. All EV battery pack enclosures use gaskets to seal off their internal space from the elements outside. Typically, they have [waterproof ratings of IP66 or IP67](https://www.accessfixtures.com/ip-ratings/). While these ratings are high, they do not guarantee that a battery will be watertight when it is immersed for a long period of time – say, over 30 minutes. Battery packs also have various ports to equalize pressure inside the battery and move electrical power in and out. These can be potential pathways for water to leak into the pack enclosure. Inadequate seal ratings and manufacturing defects can also enable water to find its way into the battery pack if it is immersed. All batteries have two terminals: One is marked positive (+), and the other is marked negative (-). When the terminals are connected to a device that uses electricity to do work, such as a light bulb, chemical reactions occur inside the battery that cause electrons to flow from the negative to the positive terminal. This [creates an electric current](https://www.eia.gov/kids/energy-sources/electricity/science-of-electricity.php) and releases the energy stored in the battery. Electrons flow between a battery’s terminals because the chemical reactions inside the battery create different electrical potentials between the two terminals. This difference is [also known as voltage](https://www.sciencing.com/voltage-battery-5058989/). When saltwater comes into contact with metal battery terminals with different electrical potentials, [the battery can short-circuit](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/short-circuit), inducing rapid corrosion and electric arcing, and generating excessive current and heat. The more conductive the liquid is that penetrates the battery pack, the higher the shorting current and rate of corrosion. Rapid corrosion reactions within the battery pack produce hydrogen and oxygen, corroding away materials from metallic terminals on the positive side of the battery and depositing them onto the negative side. Even after the water drains away, these deposited materials can form solid shorting bridges that remain inside the battery pack, causing a delayed thermal runaway. A fire can start [days after the battery is flooded](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hurricane-idalia-electric-car-caught-fire-tesla/). Even a battery pack that is fully discharged isn’t necessarily safe during flooding. A lithium-ion cell, even at 0% state of charge, still has about a three-volt potential difference between its positive and negative terminals, so some current can flow between them. For a battery string with many cells in a series – a typical configuration in electric cars – residual voltage can still be high enough to drive these reactions. Many scientists, including me and my colleagues, are working to understand the exact sequence of events that can occur in a battery pack after it is exposed to saltwater and lead to thermal runaway. We also are looking for ways to help reduce fire risks from flooded battery packs. These could include finding better ways to seal the battery packs; using alternative, more corrosion-resistant materials for the battery terminals; and applying waterproof coatings to exposed terminals inside the battery pack. Electric cars are still very safe to drive and own in most circumstances. However, during extreme situations like hurricanes and flooding, it is very important to keep EV battery packs from becoming submerged in water, particularly saltwater. The same is true for other products that contain lithium-ion batteries. For EVs, this means evacuating cars out of the affected zone or parking them on high ground before flooding occurs. Smaller objects, like e-bikes and power tools, can be moved to upper floors of buildings or stored on high shelves. If you own an EV that has been submerged in water for hours to days, particularly in saltwater, public safety experts recommend [treating it as a fire hazard](https://www.evfiresafe.com/ev-flood) and placing it on open ground away from other valuable property. Do not attempt to charge or operate it. Contact the manufacturer for an inspection to assess battery damage. Often, a flooded electric vehicle will need to be towed away for further inspection.

    "text": "CONCORD — After an Oregon resident allegedly flipped over a Mazda, killing a 9-year-old girl and injuring himself and four other occupants, he ran from the scene and disappeared for several days, according to authorities. But 22-year-old Jesus Ivan Dorantes-Guzman allegedly did all of this in plain view of a nearby homeless encampment, whose residents provided consistent accounts of what happened after the deadly accident that could help criminal charges against him stick. Dorantes-Guzman has been charged with child abuse and committing a hit-and-run CRASH that resulted in death, but authorities say the case remains under investigation. Dorantes-Guzman allegedly crashed the Mazda around 5:20 a.m. on April 7, near the Interstate 680 and Highway 242 interchange in Concord. Everyone in the vehicle was injured, and 9-year-old Danna Hernandez Tapia, a resident of Tualatin, Ore., was killed. Two of the passengers identified the driver as “Jesus Ivan” without providing a last name, while others wouldn’t tell police who was driving, authorities said. All five passengers appeared to have not been wearing seatbelts in the Mazda, according to the California Highway Patrol. Just a few yards from the crash site was a small cropping of tents, and many of the people living inside rushed to the crash to help. They would later recall to police how Dorantes-Guzman crawled out from under a car, shoved one of the injured passengers out of his way, and ran toward Concord Avenue while everyone else stayed at the scene, authorities said. These eyewitnesses also reported that Dorantes-Guzman stumbled and appeared to be intoxicated, but also that he had a bloody gash on his head, authorities said. By the time he was arrested in the Colusa County city of Williams, enough time had elapsed that any drugs or alcohol would likely have been flushed from his system. One of the unhoused men who came to help the victims — who police say was the first eyewitness at the scene — reported seeing Dorantes-Guzman unzip his pants, urinate on the vehicle, then run away, authorities said. As he fled, Dorantes-Guzman accidentally left his cellphone at the scene, which aided police in identifying him, authorities said. Dorantes-Guzman has pleaded not guilty, and remains jailed in lieu of $1 million bail, court records show. His preliminary hearing, where a judge will review the prosecution’s evidence against him, is set to begin Friday.",

    "text": "More monster waves will collide with the California coast after injuring onlookers and causing serious flooding CNN, KCAL, KCBS By Elizabeth Wolfe, Robert Shackelford, Mary Gilbert and Cindy Von Quednow, CNN (CNN) — A series of powerful storms in the Pacific Ocean are [driving towering waves](https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/28/weather/high-surf-ventura-san-diego/index.html) into the California coastline, triggering flooding and posing a significant risk to people and structures along the coast. Monstrous, 20-foot-plus waves on Thursday crashed over seawalls and swept away and injured several people, forced rescues and sent a damaging surge of water through coastal California streets. A brief dip in wave heights may occur in some locations along the California coast during the daytime Friday as one storm pushes ashore, but the danger will quickly ramp back up later Friday and Saturday as another system develops behind it. “Overall, this is expected to be an exceptional high-surf and coastal flooding event that has not occurred in many years,” the weather service in Los Angeles warned. [Sea levels have risen](https://oehha.ca.gov/climate-change/epic-2022/impacts-physical-systems/sea-level-rise#:~:text=*%20Sea%20levels%20have%20increased%20over%20the,about%200.8%20mm%20or%200.03%E2%80%B3%20each%20year) along most of the California coastline over the past century, NOAA data shows, as global temperature climbs and melts glaciers and ice sheets. Higher sea levels are making [coastal flooding events worse](https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/02/us/sea-level-rise-impact-california-climate/index.html) and will continue to do so in the future. Waves as high as telephone poles – about 40 feet – could slam into San Francisco through Friday morning. Fifteen- to 20-foot waves are expected along the central and Southern California coasts through Saturday evening. The first round of dangerous waves hit alongside high tide Thursday morning. Several people were injured by a huge wave that slammed into Ventura Beach. The wave crashed over a barrier along the Southern California beach, tossing a wall of fast-moving water at a group of onlookers who rushed to escape the deluge, witness video shows. Seawater quickly knocked some people off their feet and pummeled cars as drivers tried to speed away. Nearly 20 people were briefly swept away in the incident and eight people were taken to the hospital, Ventura officials said. High water and dangerous rip currents will churn along some of California’s beaches through the weekend as much of the West coast – spanning from the US-Mexico border to southern Oregon – is under coastal flood and high-surf alerts, the National Weather Service said. The dangerous conditions pose an “exceptional risk” of ocean drowning and damage to structures like piers and jetties, the National Weather Service said. The dangerous wave risk will lessen on Saturday for Northern California, but continue in southern Oregon and rival Thursday’s impact in Southern California. The Ventura County coast, along with Hermosa, Manhattan and Palos Verdes beaches face the most extreme surf and are at risk for significant coastal flooding. One of the storms helping to drive the waves will also bring rain and wind to California through Saturday. High wind alerts are in effect for California’s central coast and the Bay Area on Friday as wind gusts of up to 50 mph are expected. These strong wind gusts will churn up waters even further. The spectacular waters have enthralled some surfers and onlookers, but weather officials are cautioning that the waves and strong rip tides can be perilous for those nearby. “Large breaking waves can cause injury, wash people off beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats near shore,” the National Weather Service warned. At least one fisherman fell overboard in a harbor off Oxnard Thursday and later came ashore uninjured, the Ventura County Fire Department said. The conditions caused some road closures and evacuations in coastal California communities Thursday and prompted the rescue of five campers along the San Luis Obispo coast. Crews in Ventura worked through the night to reinforce a mile-long sand barrier that was damaged by powerful waters on Thursday, the local fire department said. Standing about 7 feet tall, the raised wall helps protect beachside communities. Hoping to discourage spectators, local officials closed a main access point to Ventura Pier, which saw a swell of about 20 feet on Thursday. Some coastal streets in the area have also been closed as a precaution. In central California’s Santa Cruz, the sheriff’s office [issued ](https://www.facebook.com/SantaCruzSheriffsOffice/)an evacuation warning for some areas on Thursday, which included areas of Rio Del Mar, where seawater filled beachside roadways and pushed against some homes, CNN affiliate KION reported. The warnings were lifted later in the day. Massive waves attract surfers to Mavericks Despite safety warnings, the massive waves are a welcome sight to surfers hungry to tackle the legendary swells at Mavericks Beach, about 25 miles south of San Francisco. Pro surfers and spectators flocked to the beach on Thursday for a competition at the site known for having [some of the biggest waves](https://www.visithalfmoonbay.org/articles/mavericks-biggest-surf-west-coast) in the world, CNN affiliate KGO reported. Local resident Ion Banner [told the affiliate](https://abc7news.com/mavericks-surf-ca-storm-waves-at-today-weather-half-moon-bay/14235785/) that surfers from Brazil, Tahiti and Hawaii were out in the water. “It’s pretty gnarly, it’s super big,” he said. “The waves looked absolutely massive and it was everything that we expected,” said Miguel Blanco, who told KGO he flew in from Portugal to surf the waves. “It was really big, I’d say 40-60 foot waves.” Mavericks’ jaw-dropping waves – caused by unique underwater rock formations – reach their biggest heights in the winter, when big wave surfers from all over the world make pilgrimages to face the swells. The legendary waves and the surfers who brave them have been the subject of several films and documentaries, including the 2012 biopic “Chasing Mavericks” about American surfer Jay Moriarity’s journey to surf Mavericks as a teen. On Thursday, the conditions were prime for surfers like Blanco. “If it’s your turn, you just gotta go,” Blanco said. “When you see a big wave, you’re kinda scared but at the same time you’re feeling like you should go and you just go and enjoy the ride.” CNN’s David Williams contributed to this report.

    "text": "By Catarina Demony and Marissa Davison\nLONDON (Reuters) – Anti-racism activists say they acted quickly to get people to come together to stop days of far-right rioting in Britain but that the main test for their fight against hate lies ahead.\nJo Cardwell, 51, is a volunteer at Stand Up to Racism, which was behind many of the counter-protests challenging the racist violence that has shaken communities in recent days.\nAfter more than three decades of activism, she knew the movements had to activate national anti-racism networks fast when far-right groups opposed to immigration and others began targeting Muslims, Black people and asylum seekers last week.\n“In many places, we were ready but we need more people all the time,” said Cardwell, who was chief steward at Wednesday’s biggest anti-racism protest in Walthamstow, north London. “This is a scale of attack that we have never seen before.”\nIn scenes echoed across the country, crowds holding banners and chanting ‘Refugees are welcome here’ gathered outside an immigration advice centre in Walthamstow that had appeared on a list of far-right targets posted online, fending off potential threats. Officials said strong policing also put off the rioters.\n“Our society is richer because of multiculturalism, it is richer because of the people who have come here,” Cardwell said ahead of the protest. “These are things that should be celebrated and fought for, not things to be feared.”\nThe riots began after a wave of false online posts wrongly identified the suspected killer of three young girls in a knife attack on July 29 in Southport, northwest England, as an Islamist migrant.\nAn estimated 25,000 people joined counter-protests across Britain on Wednesday alone, largely outnumbering the far-right, thanks partly to well-established contacts with trade unions, religious groups and the labour movement, Cardwell said.\nPeter Achan, an activist who also attended the Walthamstow protest, said it was crucial for communities to continue to come together to “stop the hate”.\n“If we don’t stand up against it, there is more chance this hate will continue to grow,” Achan said.\nBoth the far-right and those opposing them have been using social media to share information about gatherings and events.\nTelegram is known to be the far-right’s go-to platform, but counter-protesters are also active on it, with one of their main groups having more than 3,000 subscribers. Other platforms, such as WhatsApp and Tiktok, are also key.\n“Social media has changed some of their (far-right) organising models so we have to be on top of that: where are they organising, who are their organisers and what are they planning,” said Asad Rehman, chair of anti-racism organisation Newham Monitoring Project.\nWith immigration lawyers and mosques reportedly on far-right hit-lists and some people targeted just for looking or sounding different, the 57-year-old said the work of anti-racism groups includes ensuring they are equipped to send immediate support to the scenes of racist incidents or places under attack.\n‘TIDE OF HATRED’\nIn Walthamstow and at other counter-protesters across the country, many pro-Palestinian activists turned up with flags and signs saying “Make love not war”.\nAmong the disparate groups attending the counterprotests were some wearing facemasks while others were filmed carrying bats and other such weapons, prompting organisers to urge attendees to behave.\nAt demonstrations in the past, there have been violent clashes between far-right groups and counter-protesters, with both sides blaming the other for starting the trouble.\nCardwell said migration policies introduced by the former Conservative government, including a much-criticised scheme to send asylum seekers to Rwanda, had made people more aware of the need to fight far-right narratives. The Conservatives have condemned both far-right narratives and the latest violence.\nBoth Cardwell and Rehman said it was important to tackle the “roots” of the upsurge in far-right violence which they argue lie in years of wrongly blaming migrants and other ethnic groups for falling living standards, by some media and politicians.\n“Politicians are telling us to worry about the people (arriving in the UK) in small boats,” Cardwell said. “(But) it is the people in private jets and superyachts I’m worried about.”\nFurther counter-protests and far-right riots are expected in upcoming days, with authorities remaining on alert.\n(Reporting by Catarina and Marissa Davison; Editing by Philippa Fletcher)",

    "text": "[Los Murciélagos](https://www.eldestapeweb.com/tag/los-murcielagos), la [Selección Argentina](https://www.eldestapeweb.com/tag/seleccion-argentina) masculina de fútbol para ciegos, venció a Brasil por 4 a 3 en la tanda de penales luego de empatar sin goles en el tiempo regular y clasificó a la final de los Juegos Paralímpicos de París 2024. El conjunto albiceleste luchó de igual a igual contra uno de los favoritos del certamen y se impuso en los tiros desde los doce pasos. El sábado enfrentará a Francia, que eliminó a Colombia, en el encuentro por la medalla dorada. Argentina pasó segundo en su grupo tras empatar por 0 a 0 ante Marruecos y Colombia, y ganar en la última fecha ante Japón por la mínima. El combinado dirigido técnicamente por Ariel Figueroa, que tiene al arquero Germán Müleck y a Maximiliano Espinillo como sus máximas figuras, se cruzará con los locales el próximo sábado a partir de las 15 horas para obtener el único título que falta en sus vitrinas: el primer lugar en unos Juegos Paralímpicos. Los Murciélagos cortaron una histórica racha de la Selección de Brasil Este triunfo por penales ante la 'Canarinha', más allá de la histórica rivalidad existente en el fútbol con el país vecino, tiene un condimento especial: la 'Verdeamarelha' nunca había perdido un partido en los Paralímpicos. En las últimas cinco ediciones (Atenas 2004, Pekín 2008, Londres 2012, Rio 2016 y Tokio 2020+1), obtuvieron el oro de manera invicta. El fixture de Los Murciélagos en los Juegos Paralímpicos de París 2024 - Argentina 0-0 Marruecos, domingo 1 de septiembre, 8:30hs. - Argentina 0-0 Colombia, lunes 2 de septiembre, 6:30hs. - Argentina 1-0 Japón, martes 3 de septiembre, 8:30hs. - Argentina 0 (4)-(3) 0 Brasil, jueves 5 de septiembre, 15hs. - Argentina - Francia, sábado 7 de septiembre, 15hs. MÁS INFO Impacto por lo que pasó con Gustavo Fernández en tenis en los Juegos Paralímpicos [Gustavo Fernández](https://www.eldestapeweb.com/tag/gustavo-fernandez), el argentino que es una figura del [tenis](https://www.eldestapeweb.com/tag/tenis) adaptado a nivel mundial, se presentaba en las semifinales de los [Juegos Paralímpicos](https://www.eldestapeweb.com/tag/juegos-paralimpicos) de París 2024 frente al japonés Tokito Oda. El cordobés de 30 años tuvo un gran torneo oficial, como casi siempre, e iba por el boleto a la final para asegurar una nueva medalla para la delegación albiceleste en la capital de Francia. Sin embargo, en el primer set el \"Lobito\" estuvo lejos de su mejor nivel y cayó por 6-2. Ya en el segundo parcial, inició 3-1 abajo nuevamente, aunque logró equilibrar el marcador y se colocó 3-3. No obstante, el nipón otra vez hizo gala de su jerarquía, se impuso por 7-5 y volvió a dejar en el camino al albiceleste, al igual que en la final del último Roland Garros. Esto no quita el notable trabajo del sudamericano a lo largo del certamen y de la vigente temporada en líneas generales.",
