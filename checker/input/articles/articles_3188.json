    "text": "A popular Plymouth restaurant has been closed for major building work after being damaged by this year&apos;s torrential rain. The successful The Early Bird eatery on Mutley Plain has had to replace the floor of its basement and kitchen after water poured in.\nThe eatery closed on August 10 and will be shut until at least early September. The problem contributed to the outlet having its food hygiene score downgraded from four, the second highest available, to two following an inspection in late July.\nThe inspector highlighted issues with the cleanliness and condition of facilities and the building and said it needed improving. The business’ other outlet, in Mayflower Street in the city centre , has a top-rating of five and is trading well, having recently staged an Abba disco-themed bottomless brunch during the August bank holiday.\nREAD NEXT\nPlymouth firm &apos;restructures&apos; but leaves £8.5m of debts unpaid\nPlymouth pays top consultants to give city an image makeover\nDebbie and Rob Stander, who run The Early Bird restaurants and bakeries with daughters Hannah and Beth, said they were “extremely disappointed” to learn the Mutley outlet had been downgraded. They said they had immediately taken action with building work well underway and a general upgrade coming too.\nThe couple said: “As a family business, we - like the other incredible independents in our city - pour our heart and soul into our restaurants. We understand how this (the food hygiene rating) can have a huge detrimental effect on a business and hope that our customers understand that we are working closely with EHOs (environmental health officers) to bring Mutley back up to the high standard it has been over the past five years.”\nThey added: “Unfortunately, due to the age of our Mutley Plain premises, we have had some ongoing issues with the flooring in the basement of the building, which has been made worse by water ingress after heavy rains over time and in turn has had an impact on the fabric of the building. The last 12 months has been a frustrating time for us, as we have been back and forth with our landlords and insurance companies to get improvements on the building completed to the high standards we adhere to.\n“After our recent inspection with EHOs, although a very disappointing rating, it has enabled us to put pressure on the right parties to move forward with the necessary building repairs. We made the difficult decision to close our doors for the first time since lockdown to ensure any issues were rectified immediately.”\nThey said EHOs have been very supportive of the improvements and alterations to the building that are being carried out. They told PlymouthLive: “We are very confident that after these building works have been completed, we will be able to achieve a five star rating the same as we hold at our Mayflower Street branch.\n“We are pleased to say that works are well under way - we now have a new concrete floor and vinyl flooring in the basement as well as improved wall coverings and wash up area. A spruce up for Mutley is also on the cards with a new lick of paint and new outside seating.\n“We look forward to welcoming back our loyal Mutley customers and we are doing everything in our power to ensure the smooth re-opening in the first few days of September… with some exciting changes.”\nThe Early Bird opened in Mutley Plain in 2019 and was such a hit it added a second branch , in Mayflower Street in 2022. Between the two outlets more than 40 jobs have been created.\nClick here to join PlymouthLive on WhatsApp and we&apos;ll send breaking news and top stories directly to your phone.

    "title": "Celltrion Completes US Patent Registration for Zymfentra - Businesskorea",
    "text": "World’s First Subcutaneous Infliximab Celltrion announced on April 11 that “Zymfentra” (the U.S. brand name for Remsima), the world’s first subcutaneous formulation of infliximab for the treatment of autoimmune diseases developed in-house, has completed its formulation patent registration with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) on April 9, local time. Zymfentra is a treatment developed by Celltrion as a subcutaneous injection formulation of infliximab, a widely used intravenous form of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) inhibitor. It has been recognized for its efficacy and convenience in major global markets, including Europe, and was approved as a new drug by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) last October, with market supply procedures underway since last month. The patent registered this time provides a barrier designed to defend against market entry by competitors’ SC formulation infliximab biosimilars, amid Celltrion’s launch of Zymfentra as a new drug in the U.S. market. This patent secures the exclusive rights to Zymfentra in the U.S. market until its expiration in 2038. The expectation is to receive patent protection until 2040 once the administration method patent, already applied for, is registered. Through the patent strategy for Zymfentra, Celltrion aims to establish a solid position in the U.S. market while generating stable mid-to-long-term profits by launching it as a new drug, which is priced higher compared to biosimilars. Previously, Celltrion secured patents for the Remsima formulation in Europe, Canada, Korea, Japan, Australia, Taiwan, and other key Asian countries. The importance of product protection in the market through patent registration is becoming increasingly recognized, and Celltrion plans to focus on securing global patent rights going forward. Specifically, in the U.S., which is the world’s largest market, the company intends to create a dense defensive barrier by securing multiple patent rights to block the entry of other companies into the market.

    "title": "Recall of nearly 5 million portable blenders under way for unsafe blades and dozens of burn injuries",
    "text": "Latest Weather Blog Recall of nearly 5 million portable blenders under way for unsafe blades and dozens of burn injuries BlendJet is recalling about 4.8 million of its portable blenders over laceration and fire hazards after receiving dozens of reports of injuries, federal regulators said Thursday. BlendJet 2 Portable Blenders can overheat or catch fire, according to a notice from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, and their blender blades can break off during use. There have been 329 reports of blades breaking during use to date, the CPSC said, as well as 17 additional reports of overheating or fires that resulted in about $150,000 of property damage claims. The company has also received 49 reports of minor burn injuries and one reported laceration injury. Regulators urged consumers to stop using the recalled blenders immediately and contact BlendJet for a free base unit replacement. To receive the replacement part, customers will need to remove and cut up the base’s rubber seal and email or upload a photo using BlendJet’s website. BlendJet said in a prepared statement that the recall impacts older Blender 2 blenders and that BlendJet 2 blenders now available for purchase through the company’s website and retail partners have updated components and are not subject to the recall. “Out of an abundance of caution, our company updated the base of the BlendJet 2 to feature thicker blades and an improved electrical configuration,” BlendJet wrote in a Thursday release. “These updates were incorporated many months ago into all BlendJet 2 devices manufactured by the company.” BlendJet 2 blenders with serial numbers that begin with numbers “5543” or higher are not under recall, the Benicia, California, company said. Consumers can also confirm whether or not their blender is under recall by furnishing product information on BlendJet’s website or contacting the company. Trending News According to the CPSC, the recalled BlendJet Portable Blenders were sold between October 2020 and November 2023 online and in stores at retailers including Costco, Walmart and Target. In addition the 4.8 million BlendJet 2 blenders under recall in the U.S., regulators say about 117,000 were sold in Canada.

    "text": "A new environmental documentary has viewers deeply shaken after revealing an underwater toxic waste disaster just off the coast of California that was hidden for decades. \" Out of Plain Sight \" premiered to a sold-out crowd at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival, highlighting the alarming discovery of up to 25,000 barrels of toxic chemicals dumped near Los Angeles over half a century ago, the Guardian reported.\nA recent post from the Los Angeles Times' Entertainment section on Instagram ( @latimes_entertainment ) describes the documentary as \"a cinematic expansion of a series of haunting reports by environmental journalist Rosanna Xia.\" The film explores how Xia, a reporter for the paper, broke the story in 2020 after receiving a tip from UCSB scientist David Valentine.\nThe documentary reveals the persistent environmental damage from DDT , a harmful pesticide banned decades ago in the U.S., as shared by the L.A. Times on Instagram . Its toxic legacy still continues today, with warning signs about contaminated fish on local piers, compromised immune systems, and concerning links to breast cancer across multiple generations.\n\"I have spent years unraveling a toxic mystery that the ocean had buried for generations, and this story was begging to be told more visually — with a more profound exploration of how the horrors of our past continue to affect us and our future,\" said Xia in a recent Times article about the film.\nThis ocean dumping represents one of America's largest environmental cover-ups, with chemicals leaching into marine ecosystems for over 70 years , per CBS News. Unlike land-based pollution, which can often be seen and addressed, underwater toxic waste remains largely invisible to the public.\nThe good news is that increased awareness has sparked action. Organizations like Heal the Bay monitor coastal water quality and advocate for clean water policy throughout Southern California, while the EPA has begun surveying the full extent of the underwater dump site for ongoing evaluation.\nWatch now: How bad is a gas stove for your home's indoor air quality? Several of the Instagram post comments lamented the frequency of such environmental disasters, with one sharing, \"They did the same with nuclear waste in the U.K. or France.\"\nOne commenter noted the importance of speaking truth to power when it comes to environmental reporting and advocacy: \"Thank you for this. This keeps me up at night. Really it does, but documentaries and research and truth tellers can spread the word.\"\nDo you worry about having toxic forever chemicals in your home?\nMajorly 😥\nSometimes 😟\nNot really 😐\nI don't know enough about them 🤷\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips , and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.",
