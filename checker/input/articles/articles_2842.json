    "title": "Why was Harvey Weinstein's rape conviction overturned, and what's next? | RNZ News",
    "text": "By Brendan Pierson for Reuters Thursday's ruling overturning Harvey Weinstein's New York rape conviction gives the one-time film mogul a chance at a new trial and calls into question what evidence prosecutors can use in future sex crime cases. Here is a look at what happened to the case, which helped define the #MeToo movement, and what might happen next. Why was Weinstein's conviction overturned? Weinstein, 72, was found guilty of raping one woman and sexually assaulting another after both testified in court. But a 4-3 majority of the New York Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, found that the trial judge should not have permitted three other women to testify that Weinstein had assaulted them as well because their allegations were not part of the criminal charges against him. Such testimony about \"prior bad acts\" is usually barred by New York's so-called Molineux rule, named for a landmark 1901 court case. The majority of the court found that the testimony by the three women ran afoul of the rule and made the trial unfair. Why were the other women allowed to testify in the first place? The Molineux rule is not absolute. It holds that prosecutors cannot use such testimony to prove that the defendant has a \"propensity\" to commit crime, but they may use it as evidence of motive or intent. In Weinstein's case, prosecutors persuaded the trial judge that the producer's alleged prior sexual assaults showed that he knew his accusers did not consent to his advances, but that he intended to force them into sex anyway. Prosecutors believed the evidence would help disprove Weinstein's assertion that the encounters were consensual. The Court of Appeals, however, found that the testimony was simply evidence that he had a propensity to commit rape and sexual assault, not of his motive or intent. What does the ruling mean for Weinstein's California case? Weinstein was sentenced to 16 years in prison following a separate 2022 rape conviction in California, which he is expected to appeal, and the New York ruling has no direct effect on that case. In fact, California law specifically allows testimony about prior bad acts in sex crime cases as evidence that a defendant has a propensity to commit sex crimes. Such evidence was used in Weinstein's California trial, and the state's law will make it harder for his lawyers to challenge on appeal than in New York. What does the ruling mean for future cases in New York? According to the majority of the court, very little. Judge Jenny Rivera wrote in the majority opinion that the decision was based on well-established New York law, and said it was similar to another 1996 Court of Appeals decision, People v. Vargas, vacating a rape conviction because witnesses were allowed to testify about earlier alleged rapes by the defendant. Dissenting judges in Thursday's decision said the ruling would make it more difficult to prosecute sex crimes committed by people who know their victims and may have ongoing relationships with them, as in Weinstein's case. Judge Anthony Cannataro, who was among the dissenters, called it \"an unfortunate step backwards from recent advances in our understanding of how sex crimes are perpetrated\". Another dissenting judge, Madeline Singas, said the decision would effectively end the use of prior bad acts witnesses in such cases and make it difficult to prove intent. - Reuters",

    "text": "En enero de 2021, Kirsty Bortoft, una mujer británica de 49 años, se preparaba para tener una cita con su entonces prometido, Stu. Mientras esperaba que la pasen a buscar, se descompensó en el sillón del living, donde, más tarde, su pareja la encontró inconsciente.\nAnte la desesperación por salvarla, la llevó de urgencia al hospital más cercano, donde confirmaron que “había muerto ”. Sin embargo, 40 minutos después, los médicos lograron reanimarla y ella los sorprendió con un impactante relato de lo que había visto mientras se encontraba sin vida. “Tuve una descarga de información”, aseguró en diálogo con The Sun .\nLeé también: Revelaron las aterradoras predicciones de Baba Vanga para el 2024\nDe acuerdo a lo que contó Stu, Kirsty estaba recostada en el sofá con los ojos abiertos y “sin vida”. Además, detalló que tenía unas extrañas figuras hexagonales en toda la piel. En ese momento, se dio cuenta de que no estaba respirando y que tenía que llevarla a la guardia con urgencia.\nUna vez en el centro médico, los especialistas le dijeron que sólo tenía un 6% de posibilidades de sobrevivir . Unos minutos después, Bortoft sufrió un paro cardíaco y fue puesta en un coma inducido por su propia seguridad. A su familia le decían que “se preparen para lo peor”.\nPese a los malos pronósticos, los médicos lograron reanimarla después de 40 minutos de practicarle RCP. Así fue cómo, luego de que recobrara el conocimiento, aseguró que “había pasado algo mágico” y que “algo la trajo de nuevo a la vida”. Incluso, expresó que, a pesar de que estaba inconsciente, ella sabía exactamente todo lo que estaba pasando a su alrededor.\n\"Mi misión acá todavía no terminó\", aseguró Kirsty Bortoft. (Foto: Mirror) Por otro lado, contó que tenía un amigo que era “psíquico” y que, al momento del hecho, se contactó con su hermana para preguntarle que estaba pasando, aún sin que nadie le haya avisado. “ Dijo que mi espíritu estaba en su salón y que yo le estaba pidiendo que escriba una carta para mi papá y mis hijos”, comentó Kirsty.\nSegún su relato, en ese “encuentro” ella le dijo que no iba a poder sobrevivir porque su cuerpo no se lo permitía. Sin embargo, su amigo insistió en que “era fuerte” y que “ tenía que volver ”.\n“Recuerdo que cuando finalmente regresé a mi cuerpo, sabía exactamente lo que tenía que hacer para sanar , como una descarga de información. Me di cuenta de que no te morís, sólo tu cuerpo sigue adelante. Mi misión acá todavía no terminó ”, sostuvo.\nLeé también: Tiene 45 años, se sentía sola y empezó una relación erótica con un árbol: “Me llena un vacío”\nAdemás, también aseguró que “se curó más rápido” gracias a la meditación y que hoy cuenta su historia para ayudar a otros a lidiar con la ansiedad y la depresión. “Sin la oscuridad no sabes qué es la luz. Creo que estamos acá para despertar, crecer y alinear nuestras vibraciones”, concluyó.",

After putting the contenders through the paces of running, yoga and circuit workouts, we determined Lululemon’s SenseKnit High-Rise Running Tights to be the overall winner. For a budget-friendly option, you can’t beat IUGA High Waist Yoga Pants .\nWhether you need new leggings for yoga, running or to wear as an everyday essential, we found the 7 best options for a variety of activities. During testing, we evaluated each pair’s fit, fabric quality, durability and aesthetic appeal, among other factors. Ahead, you’ll find all of our top picks, along with new additions tested by our team. For more specific recommendations, we also covered the best tummy control leggings and the best high waisted leggings .\nBest Leggings For Women Overall: Lululemon SenseKnit High-Rise Running Tight Best Affordable Leggings For Women: IUGA High Waist Yoga Pants With Pockets Best Running Leggings For Women: Tracksmith Women's Turnover Tights Best Yoga Leggings For Women: Zella Studio Luxe High Waist Pocket 7/8 Leggings Best High-Waisted Leggings For Women: Lululemon Align High-Rise Pant With Pockets Best Thick Leggings For Women: The Gym People Thick High Waist Yoga Pants Best Soft Leggings For Women: Spacedye Out Of Pocket High Waisted Midi Legging Best Leggings For Women Overall High-Performance Leggings That Stay Put And Feel Great\nLululemon SenseKnit High-Rise Running Tight Buy From Lululemon Body fabric: 76% nylon, 24% elastane | Size range: 0 to 14 | Colors: Rhino Grey and Black\nBest For:\nHigh impact activities when you want compression and support Minimizing sweat during a workout Preventing inner-thigh chafing Skip If:\nYou’re on a budget You prefer supersoft, stretchy leggings instead of a performance-oriented fit The Lululemon SenseKnit High-Rise Running Tights are sleek, compressive and supportive, without sacrificing breathability, making them perfect for high-impact activities. I started testing the SenseKnits when I was 6 weeks postpartum, and in these leggings, I felt like I could easily clock 7:40 miles in a half-marathon again.\nHere’s why: Unlike most of the other leggings I tested, these have compression zones knit right into the material, made with a proprietary fabric blend called SenseKnit. If you’ve ever worked out in compression tights, you know that extra support often means extra sweat, but this pair has ventilation zones to minimize dampness.\nUnlike many of the other leggings I tested, the SenseKnits are made for running, which you can see in the details, from the lack of an inseam (no inner-thigh chafing!), to the low-profile (but functional) envelope pockets that tuck valuables away without bouncing, to the targeted ventilation and compression zones. The design has been carefully thought out, and as a runner, I appreciated each and every feature. Still, there are more comfortable leggings out there, made of softer, stretchier fabric for lounging and athleisure wear. But on the days I wanted to feel fast and strong during my workouts, the SenseKnits were my top choice.",
