    "text": "Plant Fungus Provides New Drug With A New Cellular Target Novel chemical compounds from a fungus could provide new perspectives for treating colorectal cancer, one of the most common and deadliest cancers worldwide. Ninghua Tan, Yi Ma, Zhe Wang , and colleagues, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China, have reported on the isolation and characterization of a previously unknown class of metabolites (terpene-nonadride heterodimers). One of these compounds effectively kills colorectal cancer cells by attacking the enzyme DCTPP1, which thus may serve as a potential biomarker for colorectal cancer and a therapeutic target.\nChallenges in Colorectal Cancer Treatment Rather than using conventional cytostatic drugs, which have many side effects, modern cancer treatment frequently involves targeted tumor therapies directed at specific target molecules in the tumor cells. However, the prognosis for colorectal cancer patients remains grim—there is a need for new targets and novel drugs.\nTargeted tumor therapies are mostly based on small molecules from plants, fungi, bacteria, and marine organisms. About half of current cancer medications were developed from natural substances. The researchers chose to use Bipolaris victoriae S27, a fungus that lives on plants, as the starting point in their search for new drugs.\nDiscovery of Novel Metabolites The team first analyzed metabolic products by cultivating the fungus under many different conditions (OSMAC method, one strain, many compounds). They discovered twelve unusual chemical structures belonging to a previously unknown class of compounds: terpene-nonadride heterodimers, molecules made from one terpene and one nonadride unit.\nWidely found in nature, terpenes are a large group of compounds with very varied carbon frameworks based on isoprene units. Nonadrides are nine-membered carbon rings with maleic anhydride groups. The monomers making up this class of dimers termed “bipoterprides” were also identified and were found to contain additional structural novelties (bicyclic 5/6-nonadrides with carbon rearrangements).\nNine of the bipoterprides were effective against colorectal cancer cells. The most effective was bipoterpride No. 2, which killed tumor cells as effectively as the classic cytostatic drug Cisplatin. In mouse models, it caused tumors to shrink with no toxic side effects.\nMechanism of Action The team used a variety of methods to analyze the drug’s mechanism: bipoterpride 2 inhibits dCTP-pyrophosphatase 1 (DCTPP1), an enzyme that regulates the cellular nucleotide pool. The heterodimer binds significantly more tightly than each of its individual monomers. The activity of DCTPP1 is elevated in certain types of tumors, promoting the invasion, migration, and proliferation of the cancer cells while also inhibiting programmed cell death. It can also help cancer cells to resist treatment. Bipoterpride 2 inhibits this enzymatic activity and disrupts the—pathologically altered—amino acid metabolism in the tumor cells.\nThe team was thus able to identify DCTPP1 as a new target for the treatment of colorectal cancer and bipoterprides as new potential drug candidates.",

    "text": "District News,\nStudent Newson December 5, 2024\nApply for scholarships over winter break\nAttention high school students. Is “applying for college scholarships” on your winter break to-do list? If not, you need to add it! Take advantage of your free time over the holidays to set yourself up for a great future. And keep reading to find scholarships and get tips on how to apply.\nIf you don’t know what scholarships to apply for, that’s not a problem. Finding scholarships is easy thanks to the Arlington ISD’s guidance and counseling department. Students can apply for scholarships year-round by checking out the scholarships page and choosing which ones they qualify for.\nThere is a scholarship for everyone. Do you have a green thumb and plan to major in horticulture? Are you first in your family to pursue college, or are you an active member in Boy Scouts? Did you participate in the Dan Dipert Career and Technical Center culinary arts and hospitality program, or are you currently enrolled in a STEM-related career pathway?\nThere are scholarships for all those students and a whole lot more. Really – there’s a scholarship for everyone. But you have to apply. So, go check out the district’s scholarship page, look at the info below about the scholarships for Arlington ISD students offered by the Greater Arlington Chamber of Commerce, and read the tips about applying for scholarships below from Arlington ISD director of guidance and counseling Telisa Brown.\nThe Greater Arlington Chamber Scholarships\nThe Greater Arlington Chamber Scholarship Program awards $20,000 in scholarships each year to graduating seniors in the Arlington ISD to attend a college or university of their choice.\nEight $2,500 scholarships will be awarded to one graduating senior from each of the six traditional high schools and the two early college high schools.\nApplicants are required to complete the online application, write an essay based on the essay topic provided and upload all of the supporting documents.\nApplications Due: Sunday, Feb. 23, 2025 at 11:59 p.m. CST Apply here.\nScholarship Tips\nArlington ISD director of guidance and counseling Telisa Brown has a few tips for students (and parents) planning to apply for scholarships:\n- Start Early\nBegin researching scholarships well in advance. Many scholarships have early deadlines, so starting early ensures you don’t miss out on opportunities.\n- Organize Deadlines\nCreate a calendar to track application deadlines and prioritize those with the earliest due dates.\n- Focus on Fit\nLook for scholarships that align with your strengths, interests and experiences. For example, consider awards for academic achievement, community service, sports or unique talents.\n- Do not Ignore Small Awards\nEvery amount will help and add up.\n- Gather items needed to apply for a scholarship early, like your transcript, completed FAFSA documents, resume, recommendation letters and essays.\nYou may need these documents to reference while completing applications.\n- Maximize Financial Aid Knowledge\nEnsure the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is completed early to qualify for federal, state and school-based aid. Visit the Arlington ISD financial aid website for additional information to complete your FAFSA application.\n- Gather Strong Recommendations Early\nSome scholarships require letters of recommendation. Identify Recommenders: Ask teachers, counselors or mentors who know you well and can provide a strong, personalized letter. Share a resume, transcript or a list of accomplishments to help recommenders write detailed letters. Give your recommenders no less than two weeks to prepare.\n- Gloat! Sing your own praises!\nThis is a time to brag about all the great things you are doing academically and within the community.\n- Stay Persistent\nDon’t get discouraged by rejection. Apply to as many scholarships as possible to increase chances of success. By staying organized, proactive and persistent you can tackle the scholarship application process successfully.\nBrown also emphasizes the importance of staying connected with your school counselor and visiting your campus Go Center. Both resources play a vital role in helping students plan for college, apply for scholarships and prepare for post-secondary opportunities.\nGood luck!",

    "text": "It is already Jan. 12, and it is just starting to feel like winter. Last year at this time, we already had struggled with -30 C temperatures and wind chills of -40 C, so this is a welcome change. This winter has been great until now, but I am not going to complain about it, well maybe a little bit. Being that we are about to start the third week of January, and this is the first wintry blast we are getting, I will take it. We are in the construction business and this mild weather makes it so much easier to work outside. I do not have to wear six layers of clothes to go outside and help on the job site. When the deep freeze hits, I have to layer and layer. By the time I have them all on, I am hot and tired, and then I have to go to the ladies' washroom. I can do without all the coldness and snow. The lack of snow, I am sure, is disheartening to those who enjoy cross-country or downhill skiing, or if you have a snowmobile that is sitting in the garage waiting to go out on the trails across the province. I do feel for you not having the opportunity to enjoy the snow, but it does not hurt my feelings that there is little to no snow. Another advantage is for pet owners. These balmy temperatures have made it easy to let the pups outside to enjoy the outdoors. I do not have to worry about them being three-legged on the ice-cold snow, but I am sure I will be running outside in the frigid temperatures this week to rescue freezing little feet in my slippers. We cannot have them too cold. One always has to prepare for this extreme cold. Our horses are boarded at a wonderful place, and it has been great going out to ride without my fingers and toes falling off. We did manage a quick trip out to see them and get blankets on before the freezing blast hit and the winds that usually come with the chill. The cold temperature is not so bad, but it seems that the wind needs to accompany it and make it unbearable to be outside. It is not fit for animals or humans. We are ahead of the game this year, with having little winter so far, but through that time we had a lot of fun in the fall. I was always told when there is a great deal of fog, expect moisture in 90 days. This would take us to February, and that is when we are going to get it. Even if winter starts now and we get a dump of snow, this does not mean we could not have an early spring, or at least this is my hope. In 13 weeks, farmers could be out on the fields; this is not unheard of with an early spring, and if that is the case, I could be in my garden in 16 weeks. Sounds so much better than four months and I have all my garden seed purchased already. In 2012, 2016 and 2017, we did not have much snow, so it is not a trend, as in 2014-15 we had way too much snow. In 10 weeks, it will be spring, but it is what will happen in those 10 weeks that could be interesting. Prepare for the cold and pack extra clothes in your vehicle. Better to be safe than sorry. If the roads are crappy, stay home if you can. Before you know it, the game will be on as to who sees the robin first. We will be pulling out patio furniture and enjoying the day. It is all in positive thinking to make it through winter, after all, the days are getting longer.",

    "text": "Why is Ferrall Calling Sean Payton a ‘Phony’ Amid Russell Wilson Situation? Sportsgrid-Staff In the high-stakes world of [NFL](https://www.sportsgrid.com/nfl) football, accountability and performance are always under the microscope. Recently, Sean Payton, head coach of the Denver Broncos, found himself at the center of a media whirlwind, addressing the mounting criticism directed at quarterback Russell Wilson, the decision to bench him for the season, and what looks like will end in him being cut. Stay ahead of the game and elevate your sports betting experience with [SportsGrid.](https://www.sportsgrid.com/) Payton himself expressed his constraints, “I can’t replace the entire offensive line. I can’t bring in five new receivers, and if it continues over a period of time, then there’ll be another guy here talking to you as well.” This candid admission from Payton reflects the complex dynamics of an NFL team. The spotlight often falls on quarterbacks, but the success of a football team hinges on multiple factors, including coaching strategies, player performances, and team chemistry. SportsGrid’s Scott Ferrall didn’t mince words in his analysis of the situation. Ferrall, known for his straight-shooting style, didn’t hold back in his critique. “I was on this guy for turning it around for the Broncos. They had it all turned around, then cabled in their pants again. They went from bad to good and right back to bad again. And I said he did a great job in Denver. I take all that back. He’s not done a great job at all in Denver.” The sharp commentary from Ferrall underscores the volatile nature of NFL coaching and quarterback performance. “He’s right about one thing. If he keeps it up, they’ll replace him too. If they’re willing to give this guy (Wilson) $90 million to go away, they’re willing to give him (Payton) $90 million to go away too. They’re not afraid to pay anybody out. He’s got rid of his quarterback, and they’ll get rid of his ass too.” Check out SportsGrid’s [NFL game picks](https://www.sportsgrid.com/nfl/picks) and [NFL Props Picks](https://www.sportsgrid.com/nfl/player-props) all Season Long. Moreover, Ferrall took a dig at Payton’s relationship with the media. “He doesn’t like the media now. He’s such a phony, this guy. He’s a phony. He was in the media, sucking the microphone and everybody’s favorite friend on TV. Now he’s a coach again and hates the media and anyone who asks him a question he’s offended by. I’m sick and tired of his act.” Watch Ferrall’s Full Rant on [SportsGrid’s YouTube Page](https://www.youtube.com/@SportsGridTV) Below. Ferrall’s comments highlight the often tumultuous relationship between the media, coaches, and players in professional sports. As the season progresses, all eyes will be waiting to see what happens with Wilson and how they navigate these challenges. “Keep it up, Sean. You’re the most overpaid coach in the NFL. Keep it up, buddy. You’re the man,” Ferrall concluded with a tone of sarcasm, pointing to the high expectations and scrutiny of leading an NFL team. [Have all the intel you need?

    "text": "Les plus grands producteurs de sables bitumineux du Canada sont favorables au paiement d'une taxe sur le carbone, mais considèrent le projet de plafonnement des émissions de gaz et de pétrole comme une législation inutile, ont déclaré les PDG des entreprises aux législateurs à Ottawa jeudi.\nLes dirigeants de Suncor Energy, Imperial Oil, Cenovus Energy, Enbridge et Shell ont comparu par liaison vidéo devant une commission de la Chambre des communes pour répondre à des questions sur leurs efforts de réduction des émissions.\nLe secteur du pétrole et du gaz est l'industrie la plus polluante du Canada, représentant plus d'un quart de l'ensemble des émissions. En 2022, il a enregistré des bénéfices records lorsque les prix du pétrole ont grimpé pendant l'invasion de l'Ukraine par la Russie. Les défenseurs du climat estiment que les entreprises devraient investir une plus grande part de leurs bénéfices dans la décarbonisation.\nLe gouvernement libéral du Premier ministre Justin Trudeau prévoit d'introduire un plafond sur les émissions du secteur, mais se heurte à une forte opposition de la part de l'industrie, qui soutient que la législation n'est pas nécessaire car le Canada a déjà mis en place des incitations réglementaires, y compris un prix sur le carbone produit par l'industrie.\n\"Je suis en faveur d'un prix du carbone dans l'ensemble de l'économie, car je pense que cela favorisera l'innovation et les incitations économiques pour que nous continuions à améliorer nos activités\", a déclaré Rich Kruger, PDG de Suncor.\n\"Je crains fondamentalement qu'un plafonnement des émissions, tel qu'il est conçu, soit un plafonnement de la production\", a-t-il ajouté.\nLe Canada est le quatrième producteur mondial de pétrole.
