People should also avoid standing near doors and windows during giant hail.\nAsthma sufferers are also urged to keep medication nearby, as storms and wind can trigger attacks.\nNSW SES has warned those taking to the roads on Christmas Day to stay vigilant as the Bureau of Meteorology predicts storms to continue into Monday (pictured)\nFootage from a bus passenger travelling along Anzac Parade shows them having to stand on their seat as the floor of the bus was covered in water as it traversed the flash floods (pictured)\nAreas across Queensland are expected to receive large amounts of rain in short periods of time and even hail across Sunday and Monday (pictured)\nMeanwhile, The BOM have issued a warning for the Pilbara, Gascoyne, North Interior and South Interior Districts, where temperatures could reach up to 45C.\nFelim Hanniffy, senior forecaster at the Bureau, said the storms would continue across the East Coast until Boxing Day.\n‘That means the risk of giant hail, destructive wind gusts and intense rainfall and it’s all being driven by a really significant weather system,’ he said.\n‘That’s going to affect multiple states, so Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, and is linked to a developing low pressure system that’s going to spin up over parts of Victoria and southern New South Wales and then slowly move east and eventually off the coast during about Tuesday.\n‘That includes the high demographic areas of Newcastle, Sydney, and even Canberra, as well as down to Victoria and Melbourne.’\nThe alert is currently in place until Boxing Day.",

    "text": "The Youth Wing of the Christian Association of Nigeria (YOWICAN) has demanded prompt arrest and public legal proceedings against Muslim Cleric, Idris Abdulaziz Dusen Tenshi. Naija News reports that the cleric was reportedly advocating for the killing of Senator Oluremi Tinubu, the wife of the President, branding her an \\\"infidel\\\" because of her Christian faith. This demand was put forth during the 2024 National Prayer Day and the 1st Quarter National Executive Council (NEC) meeting of YOWICAN, held at the National Christian Centre in Abuja on Friday. The YOWICAN Chairman, Belusochukwu Enwere, articulated the council's unified viewpoint in a formal communication, underscoring the immediate necessity for governmental and security authorities to intervene. The communiqué partly stated, \\\"NEC is calling for the immediate arrest of the Muslim Cleric (Idris Abdulaziz Dusen Tenshi) who has called for the killing of the wife of the President, Sen Oluremi A Tinubu, for being a Christian. Describing her as an infidel. \\\"The NEC is calling for the public prosecution of the cleric and wish to request the said preacher should be restricted from preaching in Nigeria to serve as a deterrent to others. \\\"The NEC is giving the Federal Government and security agencies to act immediately to avoid the further deterioration of security situation in the country because of the unguided statement/utterance.\\\" The NEC meeting also addressed comprehensive concerns affecting the nation, including economic challenges faced by citizens amid rising living costs and the deteriorating security situation marked by widespread killings across the country. YOWICAN emphasized the employment crisis, urging the government to enact targeted policies to tackle youth unemployment, stressing the significance of engaging young individuals in the country's development endeavours.",

    "text": "UPI apps to end P2P collect requests from October 1, 2025. NPCI’s UPI change move aims to enhance security and curb fraud\nFrom October 1, 2025, users of Unified Payments Interface (UPI) apps such as PhonePe, Google Pay, and Paytm will no longer be able to use a widely relied-upon feature. The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has announced that it will discontinue peer-to-peer (P2P) ‘collect requests’—a function that allows users to send payment requests to other account holders. The move aims to strengthen security and curb financial fraud in the UPI ecosystem.\nNPCI’s new UPI change\nIn a circular issued on July 29, NPCI confirmed that “UPI P2P Collect shall not be allowed to be processed in UPI” from October 1, 2025. This means the option to send a payment request through banks or payment apps will be phased out entirely.\nThe UPI collect request is often used to remind friends to settle shared expenses or split bills. However, fraudsters have increasingly exploited this feature by posing as someone in urgent need or in an official capacity, tricking users into approving requests. Once accepted, funds are instantly debited from the victim’s account.\nAlthough the per-transaction limit for P2P requests was capped at ₹2,000 to reduce scams, fraud attempts have persisted. Under the new rules, users will need to make payments by scanning a QR code or directly selecting the recipient’s contact number and authorising the transfer with their UPI PIN.\nImpact on merchant payments\nThe change will not affect transactions with merchants such as Amazon, Flipkart, Swiggy, or IRCTC. Businesses will still be able to send collect requests for payments. However, customers must approve these requests and enter their UPI PIN before the transaction is completed.\nSubscribe to our Newsletter\nGet Latest Mathrubhumi Updates in English\nFollow\nDisclaimer: Kindly avoid objectionable, derogatory, unlawful and lewd comments, while responding to reports.

    "text": "Después de las lluvias, este viernes Córdoba experimenta un notable aumento en la temperatura, marcando una jornada calurosa con máximas previstas de hasta 33°C. El [pronóstico del tiempo](https://www.eldestapeweb.com/tag/pronostico-del-tiempo) indica condiciones de cielo parcialmente nublado y vientos moderados provenientes del noreste. Ante este escenario, las recomendaciones de protección solar y cuidado ante la radiación ultravioleta son esenciales para el día de hoy. Calor y altas temperaturas en Córdoba: cómo afecta la jornada La ola de calor que afecta a Córdoba se hace evidente desde las primeras horas del día. Para las 8 de la mañana, la temperatura ya se ubica en 21°C, y aunque el cielo se muestra despejado, la radiación UV se presenta baja en ese horario. El viento, proveniente del noreste a una velocidad de entre 7 y 15 km/h, mantiene una intensidad floja, por lo que el ambiente se siente más estable en la primera parte del día. Para las personas que deben salir por la mañana, no se necesitan precauciones estrictas en cuanto a la protección solar, dado que el índice UV se mantiene bajo. Sin embargo, se aconseja el uso de ropa fresca y mantener una hidratación adecuada, ya que hacia el mediodía, el clima en Córdoba presentará condiciones de mayor intensidad solar. Incremento de la temperatura al mediodía: recomendaciones de protección A partir de las 11 de la mañana, el pronóstico del tiempo anticipa un aumento considerable en la temperatura, que alcanzará los 28°C con una sensación térmica de 30°C. En este momento, el índice UV sube a niveles “muy altos”, lo que hace recomendable el uso de protector solar con FPS entre 25 y 50. Los vientos del noreste aumentan en velocidad, oscilando entre 12 y 27 km/h, lo que podría brindar un alivio moderado frente al intenso calor. Pico de calor en la tarde La temperatura alcanzará su pico alrededor de las 14, cuando el termómetro podría marcar los 33°C y la sensación térmica llegar a los 34°C. En este momento, el índice UV es extremadamente alto, y se sugiere una protección intensa, con FPS de 50 o superior, además de limitar la exposición directa al sol. Disminución gradual de la temperatura hacia la noche Para la tarde, alrededor de las 17, el clima en Córdoba se moderará levemente con una temperatura de 31°C y una sensación térmica de 32°C. Finalmente, ya en la noche, la temperatura se reduce a 27°C hacia las 20 y se mantiene en 24°C alrededor de las 23.",

He did this all in a contract year, which is impressive.\nThe Cubs are looking for offense this winter, and Cody Bellinger was one of the most intriguing offensive players last season.

Damascus, Sep 27 An Israeli airstrike targeted a bridge near the Matrabah crossing on the Syria-Lebanon border, injuring eight people and an unknown number of civilians, media reported. Four of the injured were border-control policemen, while the other four were customs officers, the report said on Thursday, adding that the airstrike also damaged the bridge. It is the first Israeli raid on the Syrian border region since Israel escalated its military operations in Lebanon on Monday, Xinhua news agency reported. The Matrabah crossing, linking the al-Qusayr region in the central Syrian province of Homs to Lebanon, has recently been used by displaced Lebanese seeking refuge in Syria. Lebanese military sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Xinhua that \"Israeli warplanes fired eight air-to-ground missiles at four border crossings in the Bekaa region, destroying a bridge and several ferries linking the Lebanese side to the Syrian side,\" without specifying the casualties. The targeted crossings are mainly used by Lebanese and Syrian residents in the overlapping border villages, the sources said. This marks the first Israeli raid on the Syrian border region since Israel escalated its military operations in Lebanon on Monday.
