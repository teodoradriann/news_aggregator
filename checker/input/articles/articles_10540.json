    "text": "On Wednesday the South Dakota Legislature passed a resolution acknowledging a need to protect the United States’ southern border, passed overwhelmingly after Governor Kristi Noem briefed a joint session on the border crisis. “The national security crisis happening at the Southern Border affects every state, including South Dakota,” said Governor Noem. “I am glad that the Legislature sees the severity of this matter and agrees that we need to take action to secure our borders.” Noem’s address to the legislature was provided in full. In it, she says nearly 10 million foreign nationals have “broken federal law and infiltrated our country” within the past three years, bringing crime, violence, drugs and human trafficking. “Our immigration system has long been a subject of discussion in this country, but the policies of the Biden Administration have elevated this to a national security crisis,” Noem said. “Our history is proudly built on the stories of our ancestors who came to this country for opportunity and a new beginning. But today, many of those who are entering under the current policies of this administration are known terrorists, criminals, human traffickers, and drug cartel members. Because the federal government is facilitating the violation of federal law, vulnerable people from over 100 countries have heard the story of the open border, put their families in jeopardy, and have fallen victim to the atrocities of the Mexican cartels. Countries such as Venezuela have been known to empty out their prisons and mental institutions and send them to America. They are happy to let our open border be the solution to their problems and responsibilities.” Noem emphasized that South Dakota has not been spared by this illegal immigration, which has seen cartel influence grow on reservation land and drained local and federal resources. “America is the greatest nation in the history of the world. But we weren’t always that way,” Noem said. “Our nation started as nothing more than an idea – an idea that was so controversial that our Founding Fathers had to pledge their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor to each other just to write it down.” She then quoted the Declaration of Independence: “That all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it.” Noem declared that the US is in the midst of an invasion, one which the federal government has failed to address. “When the federal government fails to uphold its duty to the people, the responsibility falls to the states. I have been to the Southern Border many times,” she said. “Some of you have, too. I have witnessed firsthand the invasion taking place. What shocks me is that every time I go, it is more of a warzone than the time before. The cartels have operational control of that border.” Noem painted a picture of desperation and cruelty at the border crossing. “During my time there this past Friday, I was able to see with my own eyes what has changed. Texas has been calling their efforts and mission “Operation Lone Star.” But more recently, the cartels have been pushing women and children across the Rio Grande, many of whom cannot swim,” Noem said. “They’re telling them that if they turn back, they will be shot before they reach the Mexican shore. When many of these women and children struggle and inevitably drown in the high waters, Texas DPS is pulling them out of the water, performing CPR, and bringing them back to life. This has been happening so frequently that Texas has begun calling their efforts ‘Operation Lazarus.’ So why are the cartels intentionally causing these women and children to drown? Because while Texas is distracted saving their lives, cartel members are smuggling drugs and sex-trafficked human beings just a couple miles down the river.” Noem said that jurisdiction impedes state interference in tribal reservation land, as that is a treaty obligation of the federal government. Despite this, cartel influence grows on reservations and spreading into the cities. “Make no mistake, the cartels have a presence on several of South Dakota’s tribal reservations. Murders are being committed by cartel members on the Pine Ridge reservation and in Rapid City, and a gang called the ‘Ghost Dancers’ are affiliated with these cartels,” Noem said. “They have been successful in recruiting tribal members to join their criminal activity. On the other side of the state, there is documented evidence of cartel activities on the Sisseton Wahpeton reservation and others.” Drug deaths are also a result of the spread of illegal drugs from the southern border, Noem said, though South Dakota’s fared much better than other states in that regard. “The cartels are using our reservations to facilitate the spread of drugs throughout the Midwest. In particular, fentanyl – which is being manufactured by the Chinese and smuggled over our Southern Border – is causing these deaths. Total overdoses have increased by almost 20% across America since Joe Biden took office. Despite this hopelessness, South Dakota has been a bright spot. We led the nation for the largest decline in drug overdoses in 2020, and we led it again in 2022. Our anti-meth and anti-opioid campaigns are working. But even with that success, a higher share of the overdoses that do occur are happening as a result of fentanyl. There has been a 40% increase in just the past 2 years. It is literally killing our children.” Noem describes the border as a “warzone” and this crisis as a “test” of the foundations of the nation. \"We sent our National Guard soldiers because the border is a warzone – and soldiers are best equipped to operate in such a situation,” Noem said. “However, our troops have been hampered by federal restrictions when they’ve been deployed to the border in the past. I don’t want South Dakota soldiers to facilitate an invasion – I want them to stand up and stop it. So we are talking to Texas about what rules of engagement can look like to make sure that happens. We will do all that we can to defend the United States of America so that we can keep it safe for our kids and grandkids. There is no other nation in the world that is better or more free. And if we lose this country, where will we go? Every American throughout history has had the responsibility to preserve, protect, and proliferate the ideals upon which our Founders built this nation. This is a test of our endurance. It is a test of our patriotism. And it is a test of the very foundation of our nation.” ACLU Condemnation Though buoyed by support from the House and Senate, Noem’s border stance – and that of other governors who support Texas – has been loudly denounced by the American Civil Liberties Union, a non-profit organization that claims to champion individual liberty over government overreach. In the opinion of the ACLU, Texas’ border security operation amounts to “cruelty” and an “escalation”. “Our first message is simple: Not in our name,” Libby Skarin, ACLU of South Dakota acting executive director, stated in a press release. “While the governors of our respective states throw their support behind Gov. Abbott and his extreme and hateful policies, we know that this is not what our communities stand for.” The ACLU claims that Operation Lone Star has resulted in “deadly vehicular pursuits, racial profiling and unlawful arrests.” “Under Gov. Abbott’s watch, the state has seized private land and even taken over public parks, excluding residents from their own community areas,” Skarin stated. “Our governors are embracing Gov. Abbott’s xenophobic rhetoric and putting communities of color and immigrants in danger instead of working to improve quality of life in our states. This is not standing up for our communities; it is standing against them.” The ACLU claimed that border officers pushed children into the river and denied migrants water. Emphasizing that these policies and the use of razor wire is cruel treatment, the ACLU’s solution is to see financing expanded for courts and asylum systems. “The federal government has experimented with every possible cruel policy to stop people seeking asylum from coming to the U.S. — from Title 42, to family detention, to family separation. These policies have never stopped people from coming to the U.S. — instead they created incredible harm, devastating families and leaving vulnerable people exposed to rape, torture, murder, and kidnapping while preventing them from accessing our asylum system,” Skarin stated. “If we are serious about solving the challenges at the border, we need to improve border processing and invest in our asylum and immigration court systems — not push people seeking asylum to take increasingly dangerous routes to safety. Our governors should be pushing for solutions that would make our communities stronger, like funding for receiving communities, more lawful pathways, better port processing, and expanded work authorization.” When asked for comment on the Legislature's support of Texas, Skarin told the Capital Journal: \"Our lawmakers should be spending their limited time in Pierre focusing on issues that affect the day-to-day lives of South Dakotans, like our workforce shortage, affordable childcare and education funding. South Dakotans from all sides of the political spectrum just want our legislators to get good things done on their behalf – not stoke the flames of anti-immigrant rhetoric.\" The Border Crisis The issues facing the southern border of the United States are hotly politicized, and few neutral reporting agencies exist, and varying accounts of just how severe the situation is. According to the US Border Patrol, however, December of 2023 saw a historic high level of migrant crossings – over 225,000 migrants taken into custody in the first 27 days of the month, according to their [website](https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/national-media-release/cbp-releases-december-2023-monthly-update). Accordingly, from May of 2023 to December 31, the Department of Homeland Security removed or returned over 472,000 individuals, the majority of whom crossed the southwest border. Total removals and returns since mid-May, the website states, exceed removals and returns in every full fiscal year since 2015. Was the information in this article useful? Thanks for the feedback.",

    "text": "A yellow weather warning has been issued for south Wales with strong winds expected over the [weekend](/leisure/its_the_weekend/). The Met Office issued a yellow weather warning which will be in place from 11am on Saturday (December 30) until 3am on Sunday (December 31) with winds of up to 75mph forecast. It will affect all of South Wales including Newport, Monmouthshire, Blaenau Gwent, Vale of [Glamorgan](/sport/cricket/glamorgancricket/) and Swansea. Yellow warning of wind affecting Wales— Met Office - Wales (@metofficeWales) [https://t.co/eHhoHK8Z14] [pic.twitter.com/Q5TIvNbAQ6] [December 29, 2023] What to expect from the yellow weather warning in South Wales The Met Office said the yellow [weather](https://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/topics/weather/) warning was issued across South Wales due to \"strong and gusty winds\". The strong winds associated with the yellow [weather](https://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/li/weather.in.Newport/) warning is also set to cause: - Delays to road, rail, air and ferry transport - Coastal routes, sea fronts and coastal communities will be affected by spray and/or large waves - Bus and train services will be affected (with some journeys taking longer) - Short term loss of power and other services - Delays for high-sided vehicles on exposed routes and bridges A Met Office spokesperson added: \"An active cold front will move east across England and Wales during Saturday and into Sunday and will be characterised by strong winds and some heavy rain. \"Gusts of 45-50 mph widely, but squally near the cold front with some gusts around 60 mph, whilst the strongest gusts are likely near coasts in the west and south, with 65-75 mph in places.\" Everywhere in Wales set to be affected by the strong wind warning Areas of Wales set to be impacted by the yellow weather warning issued by the Met Office are: - Blaenau Gwent - Bridgend - Caerphilly - Cardiff - Carmarthenshire - Ceredigion - Conwy - Gwynedd - Isle of Anglesey - Merthyr Tydfil - Monmouthshire - Neath Port Talbot - Newport - Pembrokeshire - Powys - Rhondda Cynon Taf - Swansea - Torfaen - Vale of Glamorgan How to prepare for the yellow weather warning and strong winds The Met Office has issued advice on how to prepare for the yellow weather warning over the weekend and the strong winds that have been forecast. A Met Office spokesperson said: \"Give yourself the best chance of avoiding delays by checking road conditions if driving, or bus and train timetables, amending your travel plans if necessary. \"People cope better with power cuts when they have prepared for them in advance. \"It’s easy to do; consider gathering torches and batteries, a mobile phone power pack and other essential items. \"If you are on the coast, stay safe during stormy weather by being aware of large waves. Even from the shore large breaking waves can sweep you off your feet and out to sea. \"Take care if walking near cliffs; know your route and keep dogs on a lead. In an emergency, call 999 and ask for the Coastguard. \"Be prepared for weather warnings to change quickly: when a weather warning is issued, the Met Office recommends staying up to date with the weather forecast in your area.\" The yellow weather warning will be in place across south Wales from 11am on Saturday, December 30 until 3am on Sunday, December 31.

Gemelli”, demostró la aparición de neumonía bilateral que requiere terapia farmacológica adicional”, indica un comunicado.\nEn el último parte médico, la Santa Sede destaca que “los exámenes de laboratorio, las radiografías de tórax y las condiciones clínicas” de Francisco, de 88 años e ingresado en el Gemelli de Roma el pasado viernes, “continúan presentando un cuadro complejo”.\n“La infección polimicrobiana, que se presenta en un contexto de bronquiectasias y bronquitis asmática, y que requirió el uso de terapia antibiótica con cortisona, hace más complejo el tratamiento terapéutico”, a lo que se añade “la aparición de neumonía bilateral que requiere terapia farmacológica adicional”.\nY “a pesar de todo, el papa Francisco está de buen humor“, subraya la Santa Sede.\n“Esta mañana recibió la Eucaristía y, durante la jornada, alternó el descanso con la oración y la lectura de textos. Él agradece la cercanía que siente en este momento y pide, con el corazón agradecido, que se siga rezando por él”, concluye el comunicado emitido cuando finaliza su quinto día de hospitalización.\nTe puede interesar > Detienen a pareja que mató y torturó a menor de 13 por comerse su chocolate\nUnas horas antes el Vaticano confirmó que, por el momento, se anulaba la agenda del papa hasta el domingo y que en la misa con ocasión del Jubileo de los Diáconos será sustituido por el responsable del dicasterio para la Evangelización, Rino Fisichella, mientras que se desconoce si habrá alguna manera de que pueda celebrar el rezo del ángelus dominical.\nYa en el último parte del lunes se indicó que el cuadro clínico del papa era “complejo”, lo que hacia prever una hospitalización de Francisco más prolongada de lo inicialmente previsto.\nComo se ha podido saber, con el papa Francisco se encuentran sus dos secretarios, que le llevan algunos documentos y los diarios, mientras el pontífice realiza algunas actividades laborales, aunque se le ha aconsejado absoluto reposo.\nA pesar de su hospitalización, Francisco volvió anoche a hablar con la parroquia de la Sagrada Familia, la única iglesia católica de Gaza, explicó a los medios italianos su párroco, el sacerdote argentino Gabriel Romanelli.\nEFE",

    "text": "CANTON, N.C. (WLOS) — Many people stepped up during Helene to help fellow mountain residents, and now, some have been recognized by the State of North Carolina for going above and beyond.\nThe [Dogwood Award](https://ncdoj.gov/about-ncdoj/the-attorney-general/attorney-generals-dogwood-awards/) is reserved for people finding community solutions to challenges. The owner of WPTL Radio in Canton and the Canton Police Chief demonstrated that during Helene.\n“I got an email from Raleigh and[it] said: 'Congratulations, I've been chosen for the Dogwood Award,'\" said WPTL owner Terryll Evans.\nThe award from Attorney General and now Governor-elect Josh Stein came as a surprise to Evans.\n“I was thrilled and was very honored for my station,” she said.\n[GOVERNOR-ELECT JOSH STEIN HONORS STORM HEROES WITH DOGWOOD AWARDS IN ASHEVILLE](https://wlos.com/news/local/josh-stein-dogwood-awards-asheville-hurricane-helene-western-north-carolina-yancey-county-sheriff-chimney-rock-lake-lure-mayors-businesses-community)\nDuring Helene, power, internet and cell service were wiped out for many residents.\n“But they did have radios with batteries,” Evans said.\nSo, WPTL became a lifeline.\n\"We just stayed on 24/7 getting out the information as quickly as we received it: where to get food, where to go... 'Stay home right now. This is the best thing – please stay home.' Curfews, people then without power – they needed food, water, cleaning supplies, everything. If you were hurt, you could go here,\" said Evans on the station's broadcasts during Helene.\nThe radio station became the conduit for family members to find each other and relieve stress.\n[EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: GOVERNOR-ELECT JOSH STEIN VOWS TO PRIORITIZE WNC RECOVERY EFFORTS](https://wlos.com/news/local/exclusive-interview-governor-elect-josh-stein-vows-to-prioritize-wnc-recovery-efforts-asheville-western-north-carolina-compromise-committee)\nEvans was part of a group of Western North Carolina residents who contributed during the storm who were then given the Dogwood Award, including Canton Police Chief Scott Sluder. Stein says he has been instrumental in moving Canton forward and helping people live safer, happier lives.\n\"Although our town has faced great difficulty in the last few years, we, the whole town staff, strive daily to provide a safe place for our citizens and visitors,\" said Sluder.\n“They deserve the award just as much as anybody else,” Evans said.\nShe and fellow radio stations, KISS Country and WWNC, were also recognized for their service during Helene and named [grand marshals in Canton's Christmas parade](https://wlos.com/news/local/representatives-three-radio-stations-named-grand-marshals-canton-christmas-parade-helene-information-kiss-country-wwnc-wptl).\n“[It was] wonderful for all of us to be on that float together,” Evans said.\nIt is a recognition that a simpler, tried and true technology still transmits power.\n[DOGWOOD HEALTH TRUST ADDS $20M IN HELENE RELIEF FUNDING TO SURPASS $70M TOTAL](https://wlos.com/news/local/dogwood-health-trust-adds-20m-in-helene-relief-funding-to-surpass-70m-total)\n[It's] still a very important part of our way of life,” said Evans.\nRadio stations played a vital part during Helene, one that was award-worthy.\n“When you are the only radio station and the only means, that's the award we get – by helping,” said Evans.\nStein says Sluder navigated Canton during difficult times, and Evans, he says, provided comfort during a time of uncertainty.",
