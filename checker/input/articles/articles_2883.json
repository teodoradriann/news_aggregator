    "text": "SOME victims of the deadly Valencia floods may have been carried out to sea, rescuers have warned.\nFirefighter Oscar Gonzalo, from the Zaragoza Aquatic Rescue Group, was called up to help the search efforts on Thursday.\nREAD MORE: Tornados strike Huleva in southern Spain following red weather alert\nHe told 20Minutos that the main priority is rescuing people who were still trapped in their cars or homes or in other parts of province.\nHe said: “Our job is to go to areas that are still flooded with the priority of finding missing people, people who are trapped in vehicles, in houses with no possibility of communicating with the outside or in areas that are difficult to access.”\nHowever they are also in charge of recovering the bodies of drowned people.\nHe added: “Until a doctor certifies their death, we treat them as if they were living people and we put all our effort into getting them back on their feet.”\nOscar said there may be multiple victims who have been dragged out to sea by the floods.\nThe prospect raises fears that some bodies may never be recovered if they have been carried far out into the Mediterranean.\n“All the water that has been dragged by the ravines and rivers has ended up there,” he explained, adding that recovering people from the sea was ‘usually a job for the Maritime Rescue service.’\nSources from the Valencia fire department said: “Right now we are focused on rescuing people, because there are still people with problems, and on searching for missing people\n“Another priority is to restore basic supplies for the population, especially the drinking water service where it has been interrupted, but also the electricity supply and telecommunications. R\n“Right now we are working with all active personnel and we even have reinforcement personnel.”",

    "text": "VARANASI, India: Hindu worshippers on Thursday began praying inside a disputed mosque in the Indian city of Varanasi just hours after a court order gave them the go-ahead at the deeply sensitive site, media reported. The Gyanvapi mosque in the city of Varanasi is one of several Islamic houses of worship that Hindu activists, backed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi´s party, have sought for decades to reclaim. A Varanasi court ruled Wednesday that Hindu worshippers could pray in the building´s basement, and ordered authorities to “make proper arrangements” for worshippers within a week. Media reported that family members of Hindu priests started praying in the mosque´s basement in the early hours of Thursday morning. The Gyanvapi mosque was built in the 17th century during the Muslim Mughal empire in a city where Hindus from across the country cremate relatives by the Ganges river. Hindu worshippers believe the mosque replaced a temple to the Hindu deity Shiva. Last month, India´s official archaeological agency said a survey of the site appeared to corroborate the belief that it was originally home to a temple, according to local news reports. Emboldened right-wing Hindu groups have laid claim to several Muslim sites of worship they say were built atop ancient temples during Mughal rule.",

In tandem, Seattle University has declared plans to build an art museum, underscoring its Jesuit mission to weave visual and performing arts into a comprehensive educational experience.\nThe integration process is underway, with Seattle University conducting an extensive review of Cornish College’s operations and compliance. Pending the necessary approvals, Seattle University is expected to acquire Cornish and become its controlling entity by the end of May 2025.\nFollowing this, a transition period will begin, allowing the integration of administrative operations while Cornish retains its accreditation and degree-granting authority. Full consolidation will happen after this period.\nMORE NEWS FROM FOX 13 SEATTLE WA officer arrested, accused of flashing gun in road rage incident\nJewell Loyd reportedly requests trade from Seattle Storm after investigation completed\n‘Happy Wrapped Day’: Seattle talks Top 5 Spotify artists\nOR donut shop with a cult following to open in Seattle next week\nSeattle councilmember Tammy Morales resigns, cites concerns over Council\nChild rape victim files claim against Federal Way Public Schools\nSeattle Sounders all-time leading goalscorer Raúl Ruidíaz to depart club\nSoundgarden members reuniting for Seattle benefit concert\nTo get the best local news, weather and sports in Seattle for free, sign up for the daily FOX Seattle Newsletter .\nDownload the free FOX LOCAL app for mobile in the Apple App Store or Google Play Store for live Seattle news, top stories, weather updates and more local and national coverage, plus 24/7 livestreams from across the nation.\nDAILY NEWSLETTER All the news you need to know, every day\nBy clicking Sign Up, I confirm that I have read and agree to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service .\nOn your phone.

    "text": "New Delhi: Delhi zoo authorities are using ayurvedic methods, including neem oil, turmeric and quicklime, to keep the animals healthy and free from bacterial and viral infections during the rainy season, officials said. “We will use some Indian home remedies like neem oil, which will help protect the animals from common biting insects, including mosquitoes, biting midges and fleas,” Delhi zoo Director Sanjeet Kumar told PTI. He emphasised the importance of preparing for rain-related health issues by stocking necessary medicines.Heavy rains often lead to waterlogging in certain parts of the zoo which create breeding grounds for mosquitoes. To counter this, quicklime (chuna) will be sprinkled in these areas to prevent mosquito proliferation. Additional measures include providing elevated platforms in areas prone to water accumulation, ensuring animals have dry spots to rest. ptiWe also published the following articles recentlyDelhi Zoo implements ayurvedic methods to safeguard animals during monsoonLearn how Delhi Zoo is keeping animals healthy during the monsoon season with ayurvedic remedies like neem oil and turmeric.
