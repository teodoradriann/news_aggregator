    "title": "UK Industrialization Began Century Earlier, Defies History Books | Mirage News",
    "text": "Britain was already well on its way to an industrialised economy under the reign of the Stuarts in the 17th century – over 100 years before textbooks mark the start of the Industrial Revolution – according to the most detailed occupational history of a nation ever constructed. Built from more than 160 million records and spanning over three centuries, the University of Cambridge's [Economies Past](http://www.economiespast.org) website uses census data, parish registers, probate records and more to track changes to the British labour force from the Elizabethan era to the eve of World War One. The research shows that 17th century Britain saw a steep decline in agricultural peasantry, and a surge in people who manufactured goods: from local artisans like blacksmiths, shoemakers and wheelwrights, to an explosion in networks of home-based weavers producing cloth for wholesale. Historians say the data suggests that Britain was emerging as the world's first industrial powerhouse several generations before the mills and steam engines of the late 18th century – long credited as the birth of global industry and economic growth. \"By cataloguing and mapping centuries of employment data, we can see that the story we tell ourselves about the history of Britain needs to be rewritten,\" said Leigh Shaw-Taylor, project leader and Professor of Economic History at Cambridge's Faulty of History. \"We have discovered a shift towards employment in the making of goods that suggests Britain was already industrialising over a century before the Industrial Revolution.\" In fact, by the early 1800s, when William Blake was writing of \"dark satanic mills\", numbers involved in manufacturing had long been flatlining. Many parts of Britain were even \"deindustrialising\" say researchers – as manufacturing drained from much of the nation to concentrate around coalfields. Instead, the 19th century saw an almost doubling of the service sector – a boom often thought to have begun closer to the 1950s.* These included sales clerks, domestic staff, professionals such as lawyers and teachers, as well as a huge increase in transport workers on the canals and railways. By 1911, some 13% of all working men were in transport. In fact, the research suggests that Britain's service sector has been growing almost continuously for three hundred years. The [www.economiespast.org](http://www.economiespast.org) website, published today, has compiled and summarised employment statistics at local levels across England and Wales, allowing users to zoom in and trace changes to the workforce across the centuries.** The site also breaks down by sector and, after 1851, by gender as well as age – revealing the extent of child labour. Historians hope the site will prove a valuable classroom resource, so students can explore the history of labour in their area. The work is launched at the Economic History Society's annual conference on 6 April. \"The question of why the industrial age dawned in Britain is a much-debated one, with coal, technology and empire all major factors,\" said Prof Shaw-Taylor. \"Our database shows that a groundswell of enterprise and productivity transformed the economy in the 17th century, laying the foundations for the world's first industrial economy. Britain was already a nation of makers by the year 1700.\" \"A hundred years has been spent studying the Industrial Revolution based on a misconception of what it entailed,\" he said. 'Factories without machines' As much of Europe continued to languish in subsistence farming, the number of male agricultural workers in Britain fell by over a third (64% to 42%) from 1600-1740. At the same time, from 1600-1700, the share of the male labour force involved in goods production rose by 50% to just under half of working men (28% to 42%). According to Shaw-Taylor's estimates, the share of the British labour force in an occupation involving manufacturing rather than agriculture was three times that of France by 1700. \"We can't say for certain why this change occurred in Britain rather than elsewhere,\" he said. \"However, the English economy of the time was more liberal, with fewer tariffs and restrictions, unlike on the continent.\" Moving goods within many European countries was subject to tolls from land barons, so markets were often very local. In England there are few records of such levies after the medieval era. Shaw-Taylor argues that trade guilds also had more power in other nations. For example, textile production was prohibited in the countryside around the Dutch city of Leiden, and in Sweden no shops were permitted in rural areas within a ten-mile radius of a town until the 19th century. Yet in the England of 1700, half of all manufacturing employment was in the countryside. \"In addition to village artisans, there were networks of weavers in rural areas who would work for merchants that supplied wool and sold the finished articles,\" said Shaw-Taylor. Industries of textiles, or metalworkers making nails and scythes, were shaped like \"factories without machines spread out over hundreds of households\" according to Shaw-Taylor – and increasingly produced goods for international markets. In Gloucestershire, for example, expansions in textiles, footwear and metals saw the share of the male workforce in industry grew from a third (33%) to almost half (48%) over the 17th century. While in Lancashire, the share of men in manufacturing work grew from 42% in 1660 to 61% in 1750, driven by a doubling of textile workers (from 15% to 30%). This is all occurred prior to the Industrial Revolution. Some networks evolved into workshops, and eventually the mills of Blake's visions as industries migrated to the North of England, where coal was abundant and crops were harder to grow. This meant that by the mid-18th century – considered the start of the Industrial Revolution – much of England's South and East had actually lost its long-established industries, and even returned to farm labour, according to the research. For example, Norfolk was probably the 17th century's most industrialised county, with 63% of adult men in industry by 1700. But this actually dropped to 39% during the 18th century, while the share of the male workforce in agriculture jumped from less than a third (28%) to over half (51%). As such, and counter to prevailing historical narratives, shares of the population in manufacturing-type jobs across England and Wales changed very little over the period thought of as the height of the industrial age, but rather it was the nature and location of work that shifted. Women and children in the workforce With textile manufacturing moving out of homes and out of the Southeast, far fewer women engaged in the labour market. Adding pre-19th century data for female workers is a major next step for the project, but researchers have devised ways of estimating earlier workforce gender splits. \"We think labour force participation for adult women was somewhere between 60-80% of in 1760, and back down to 43% by 1851,\" said Shaw-Taylor. \"It didn't return to those mid-18th century levels until the 1980s.\" By 1851, Easington on the Durham coalfield had just 17% of adult women in employment. However, in one of the South's remaining industrial hubs, Luton's hat-making district, it was as high as 78%. The website also allows users to track rates of child labour after 1851. The booming textile mills of Bradford saw huge numbers of young girls put to work, with over 70% of girls aged 13-14 working in 1851. Sixty years later this figure was still over 60%. Over 40% of girls in Bradford aged 11-12 were also working in 1851, but this had fallen to nearer 10% by 1911, by which time legislation had created a system of compulsory education for young children. The ' [Economies Past](http://www.economiespast.org)' website is the result of a research project at Cambridge that's been running for over 20 years, [the Occupational Structure of Britain 1379-1911](https://www.campop.geog.cam.ac.uk/research/occupations/), which has gathered data from late medieval poll tax records to early modern coroner reports. The main source of data from 1600-1800 comes from over two million wills and probate inventories: list of the moveable goods of the deceased. The team behind the work aim to keep expanding the datasets. Alongside vast quantities of digitised census data, researchers also visited 80 records offices to gather data from a further 2.5 million baptism records from the 19th century (when it became compulsory to list the father's occupation). Notes: - * Between 1817 and 1911 the service sector grew from a 22% to a 39% share of the male workforce. Female service sector share rose from 32% in 1817 to 59% in 1911. ** The project does not have data for Scotland, so it is currently omitted. However, the researchers are hoping to add Scottish data to the website in future iterations. - The [Occupational Structure of Britain 1379-1911](https://www.campop.geog.cam.ac.uk/research/occupations/)project has received funding from the ESRC, the Leverhulme Trust, the British Academy and the Isaac Newton Trust. - Dozens of people have worked on the project since 2003. The project was founded and directed by Professor Leigh Shaw-Taylor and Professor Sir Tony (EA) Wrigley in 2003. Sadly Tony died in 2022. Since 2016 Professor Amy Erickson has co-directed the project. Other key contributors include the late Ros Davies, Dr Sebastian Keibek, Dr Peter Kitson, Ms Gill Newton and Dr Max Satchell.

    "text": "La Opinión Hoy: Juez rechaza moción del el “Chapo” Guzmán\nEl juez Brian Cogan rechazó mociones de Joaquín \"El Chapo\" Guzmán, incluido un intento de reducir su sentencia y lograr un abogado de oficio, tras acusar \"mala representación\" de su equipo de defensa.\nLos argumentos sobre una supuesta mal asesoría legal de\nJoaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán que tenían como objetivo reducir su sentencia fueron rechazados por el Juez Brian Cogan, quien además no consideró un posible acuerdo de culpabilidad. Jesús García, periodista especializado en política inmigración y asuntos nacionales de La Opinión nos amplió un poco esta información en nuestro pódcast “La Opinión Hoy”.\n“Estas mociones llevan entre junio y julio, que son mociones como muy formales porque son cartas que le envió directamente al juez que tuvieron que tener un proceso de traducción porque las escribió él mismo y tuvieron que ser traducidas al inglés con una traductora digamos autorizada por la corte y aquí había un problema porque Joaquín El Chapo Guzmán ya no tiene un abogado que lo represente en la corte del Distrito Este en Nueva York entonces una de las peticiones era justamente que le asignaran un juez de oficio, parte de esas mociones es también que le redujeran la sentencia porque él acusa que hubo una mala asesoría legal y bueno el juez Brian Cogan le responde varias de estas mociones. El 26 de diciembre que apenas se publicaron recientemente y donde establece que Guzmán debido a la cantidad de dinero que él tiene y que se demostró en el juicio, él tenía acceso miles de millones de dólares, además de que contrató equipos de abogados de muy alto nivel en los Estados Unidos durante su juicio y durante el proceso de apelación, pues no digamos llenaba los requisitos para una persona que necesite justamente un abogado de oficio, así que le rechazó esa moción. Ese es uno de los aspectos más interesantes porque evidentemente El Chapo se nota desesperado porque lo que está buscando es reducir su sentencia y por ende también mejorar las condiciones de prisión que enfrentan“, explicó García.\nLa abogada Mariel Colón dejó de representar a “El Chapo” en enero del 2023, aunque ella solamente le ofrece asesoría de traducción de documentos que el propio narcotraficante envió al juez Cogan de puño y letra.\nEn uno de sus argumentos, “El Chapo” afirma que entre los errores de sus abogados fue no haber considerado un acuerdo de culpabilidad, para lograr ciertas condiciones con los fiscales que pudieran darle la “posibilidad de ser absuelto”.\nSin embargo, el juez Cogan le recordó a “El Chapo” que el proceso sobre un acuerdo de culpabilidad fue agotado en la Corte y durante el juicio.\n“Este Tribunal asumirá para efectos de esta decisión que, de hecho, el equipo judicial del peticionario no hizo tal esfuerzo [de acuerdo de culpabilidad]. Pero el expediente muestra que eso fue tanto porque el peticionario no lo deseaba, como porque la probabilidad de obtener un acuerdo de declaración de culpabilidad fue prácticamente nula”, indicó el juez.\nSeguir leyendo:",

    "text": "A network of pro-Kremlin accounts on X pushed fake Fox News articles in the hours ahead of Thursday’s presidential debate, attempting to spread false narratives including one about former President Donald Trump’s support in the business community.\nThe fake articles, first reported on X by the account @antibot4navalny , an anonymous group of analysts tracking Russia-related influence operations, directed people to a fake version of Fox News’ website. That website appears to be part of a known Russian disinformation campaign that has mimicked legitimate news websites from Le Monde in France to The Washington Post. E.U. researchers dubbed it the doppelgänger network in 2022.\nIn March, Alethea , a company that researches online risks including disinformation, identified 81 websites and more than 5,000 X accounts as part of the campaign.\nThe messages posted Thursday on X from some of those accounts, many of which rarely post, were unique but carried similar messaging and had been reposted thousands of times by early afternoon. “Biden’s presidency could be our downfall. Trump seems to be our only hope of recovery,” one read . Many pointed to a fake article with the headline “Businesses Chooses Trump and a Great America” that claimed businesspeople from Silicon Valley and beyond were lining up to support Trump.\nLaundering propaganda through Kremlin-created or approved news outlets is a tried and true tactic, but this campaign has taken on a modern twist. It uses a fake website that credibly imitates a legitimate news outlet, sharing links through a network of seemingly automated accounts in a way that is not easily detected by platforms and researchers.\n3 hours ago Live updates: Biden, Trump debate tonight in first face-to-face since 2020 Decision 2024 1 hour ago Here's a look at the false claims you might hear during tonight's presidential debate Decision 2024 2 hours ago Biden and Trump are set to debate. Here's what their past performances looked like Another article shared by accounts in the network with the headline “Mission: Almost Impossible” included an argument that President Joe Biden would need only to remain on his feet to win the debate and that Democrats were plotting to steal the election. It also included dehumanizing language about immigrants, in furtherance of the conspiracy theory of widespread illegal voting by immigrants.\nEfforts to manipulate social media discussion around the debate — arguably the first major event of the campaign season — underscore the warnings that many researchers, technologists and political scientists have issued regarding the threat that disinformation continues to pose, particularly as technology platforms have pulled back on moderation efforts .\nThe fake version of the Fox News website along with the accounts on X also highlight how foreign manipulation efforts have evolved in recent years. The fake website looks almost identical to Fox News’ real website, and the fake article uses the name of a real Fox News reporter.\n“The story is fake,” a Fox News spokesperson confirmed in an email.\nThe X accounts are also more convincing than previous manipulation efforts that often posted in broken English and used similar or identical phrases across dozens of accounts.\nThe aims, however, appear to be similar to those from previous election cycles . The doppelgänger network uses X accounts that mostly pose as conservative voters to spread the manufactured articles and ultimately attempt to stoke division in the U.S. Subjects of previous articles have included Taylor Swift, military aid funding to Ukraine and the border crisis.\nThe doppelgänger operation, while prolific in content creation, often fails to reach and engage Americans, C. Shawn Eib, head of investigations at Alethea, said in an email to NBC News.\nIts latest efforts, “while widespread, do not appear to be gaining substantial engagement from authentic U.S. audiences.”\nThis story first appeared on NBCNews.com .

Kentucky women's soccer seeks to continue dominant season against Kent State Kentucky women's soccer records statement 2-0 victory over No. 9 UCLA Now looking at the SEC, the Cats play Florida in their next game, which will be a crucial test as they get into a gauntlet of a conference.\nKentucky has an opportunity to extend its winning streak given its current form and stellar defensive record, but the SEC opposition will certainly be dangerous.\nKentucky forwards Makala Woods, Alexis Tylenda, and Maddie Kemp celebrate a goal during the Kentucky vs. Kent State women’s soccer game on Friday, Sept. 13, 2024, at Wendell and Vickie Bell soccer complex in Lexington, Kentucky. Kentucky won 3-1. Photo by Sydney Yonker | Staff After Florida, South Carolina steps up and the Gamecocks are a powerful opponent, particularly when playing at home. They’ve played well against Kentucky in the past and have a strong defensive squad including former Cat Anna Young.\nSamantha Chang is a vital member of the Gamecocks’ midfield, a powerful player noted for her leadership and playmaking skills.\nAfter that, Georgia will present Kentucky with yet another important challenge as the Bulldogs are a well-rounded team that features a mix of young and seasoned players.\nDepending on the state of both teams when that match arrives, it’s certainly expected to be a competitive game, but Kentucky has a high chance to win if it can maintain offensive pressure and midfield possession.\nFollowing the home stand against Georgia, Kentucky will face off with a brand new face in the SEC as Oklahoma joined the conference in the offseason. Although Kentucky has more experience and is currently playing better than Oklahoma, the Sooners have shown potential in their last few games.\nElla Pappas is Oklahoma’s leading scorer and she’s capable of both creating and finishing scoring opportunities.\nAll in all, Kentucky’s women have a strong chance to keep winning in these next few match ups, but now that conference play has arrived, any team on any night can strike and change that.\nNo. 20 Kentucky will face off against Florida tonight, Sept. 19, at the Wendell & Vickie Bell Soccer Complex with kickoff scheduled for 7:30 p.m. ET. The contest will air live on ESPN+.",

    "text": "L'incendio è divampato ieri sera a Mühlehorn. Nessuno è rimasto ferito. GLARONA - Un incendio sviluppatosi ieri sera in un edificio a scopo residenziale e commerciale a Mühlehorn, nel canton Glarona, ha causato danni ingenti e l'interruzione del traffico ferroviario per oltre tre ore sulla linea che costeggia il Walensee, dove transitano ad esempio i treni Zurigo-Coira. L'allarme è giunto alle forze di intervento poco dopo le 22.30, indica un comunicato diramato la scorsa notte dalla polizia cantonale glaronese. A causa del rogo, due persone sono state allontanate dal loro alloggio. Nessuno è rimesto ferito. I danni ammontano a milioni di franchi. Poiché il rogo si è sviluppato nelle immediate vicinanze dei binari, presso la stazione del villaggio, il transito dei treni ha dovuto essere interrotto. L'incendio risultava sotto controllo nelle prime ore del mattino, si legge nella nota. Alle operazioni di spegnimento hanno partecipato circa 60 persone, tra cui anche personale e mezzi delle FFS. Sulle cause del sinistro è stata aperta un'indagine.",
