    "title": "Quick Fix Won't Overturn Injunction Blocking Divisive Concepts Law, Panel Told | InDepthNH.org",
    "text": "By GARRY RAYNO, InDepthNH.org\nCONCORD — A bill to add a teacher’s mental state to the state divisive concepts law is not enough to overturn the federal court’s injunction, a House committee was told Wednesday.\nSenate Bill 100 would add the phrase a teacher would have to “intentionally or knowingly” violate the law to be guilty of breaking the law.\nThe prime sponsor of the bill which passed the Senate on a partisan 16-8 vote, Sen. Timothy Lang, R-Sanbornton, told the House Education Policy and Administration Committee Wednesday, the bill would fix the issue raised by the federal judge in finding the state’s law unconstitutionally vague.\nHe said like in many other instances, the state would have to find the teacher intentionally or knowingly violated the law.\n“It puts the onerous back on the state if there is a complaint,” Lang said.\nBut Ian Huyett, attorney and assistant director of Cornerstone Action, said simply adding the phrase would not be enough to overturn the judge’s injunction and objection to the law.\nHe said the judge mentioned the issue at the end of his decision, but the bulk of his objection was the question of affirmative action and if teachers could discern what is forbidden under the law.\nU.S. District Judge Paul J. Barbadoro ruled the law was unconstitutionally vague and in violation of the First Amendment. He wrote the content of the law’s measures “force teachers to guess as to which diversity efforts can be touted and which must be repudiated, gambling with their careers in the process.”\n“We need to do more to get the law up and running,”Huyett said.\nThe state’s appeal of Barbadoro’s ruling was heard at the First Circuit Court of Appeals Tuesday.\nHuyett told the committee the Department of Education did not investigate one complaint filed under the law and the Department of Justice did not enforce the law believing the Human Rights Commission had to first rule on a complaint before the education department could investigate.\nHuyett said his organization helped people who believe there were violations of the law file complaints, but under questioning by committee members, said they did not have a client-attorney relationship, but assisted with complaint filings.\nHe said most of the complaints stemmed from information on school district websites about teaching white privilege or that white privilege is racist which are clear violations of the law.\nDuring the hearing, members of the committee quizzed Lang over situations teachers might find themselves in while teaching history or social studies or health and whether they would be in jeopardy.\nLang repeatedly said the law allows teaching historical facts and within that context nothing would put a teacher’s job at risk.\nQuestions concerned racism as well as gender identity issues as well as current events such as the war between Israel and Palestinians.\nLang several times noted teachers are highly educated and they know the difference between facts and opinions and what is discriminatory like teaching all white people are racists.\nRep. Peggy Balboni, D-Rye Beach, noted the technical advisory by the Department of Education is vague and does not necessarily inform teachers what is acceptable and what is not.\nWould the line be crossed, would you be able to have an honest discussion about slavery or racism or ask a student to put themselves in the role of a slave, and not be able to feel you could be accused of a violation, she asked.\nLang said as long as you are teaching in context, he did not see where a teacher could be accused of a violation.\nHe said the law has four measures as long as you are teaching within context there should not be a violation.\nThey would all think it was a bad idea to teach someone to treat someone differently based on race or gender, he said, noting the concepts are pretty clear.\n“Teachers are well educated and they should be able to navigate this,” Lang said.\nHe pressed about the concerns raised by his constituents and said one concerned a teacher saying Israel was wrong in the war with Palestine and that could be construed as antisemitism.\nNo one testified against the bill at the public hearing, although the electronic system registered 199 people opposing the bill and four supporting it.\nJames Hiltz of Pembroke wrote “This bill has been twisted from its original intent, to repeal the frankly unconstitutional ‘banned concepts’ bill, to simply try and circumvent other deterrents and push our government into punishing teachers for pushing back against the limitations on them actually educating students on a complete and honest history of our country. It seems that the sponsors of this bill would rather use legislative trickery to try and force their beliefs on our school systems, rather than actually consider what the laws currently say about such matters, to force their own view of history on students rather than looking at things objectively.”\nThe committee did not make an immediate recommendation on the bill.\nCommittee chair Rep. Glenn Cordelli, R-Tuftonboro, told Lang the House had passed a similar bill dealing with the federal court decision that is now before the Senate.\nGarry Rayno may be reached at garry.rayno@yahoo.com .",

    "title": "‘Remarkable new data’: NASA launching new PACE satellite to collect more precise weather, climate data",
    "text": "NASA is gearing up for its upcoming mission focused on tracking the climate and even helping save sea cows. The new payload is called PACE which stands for Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, and Ocean Ecosystem. It will launch off the Space Coast later this month. On Wednesday, the high-tech tool was in a clean room at Astrotech in Titusville before being taken out to the launchpad, and FOX 35 saw a behind-the-scenes look at the satellite engineers created. The PACE mission is made up of 3 different instruments and took scientists nearly two decades to perfect. \"It’s going to be great to finally get this mission into space and start getting the huge volume of remarkable new data that we’ve never had before,\" said Brian Cairns who’s a deputy project scientist with the mission. The data they collect will help us here in central Florida when it comes to saving manatees because the mission will help scientists see what areas are able to grow seagrass. \"We really hope to be able to support not only the teeny tiny life in the ocean but also big and beautiful ones such as manatees,\" said Ivona Cetinic who’s a phytoplankton ecologist focused on studying marine life in the project. Image 1 of 4 ▼ Scientists will see entire images of the globe every two days, and that’s a big deal when it comes to getting ahead of harmful algal blooms. \"We can know early on if there’s a bad bloom coming, so you can prevent deaths, prevent loss of money and things like that. PACE is going to be able to differentiate bad guys from the good guys,\" she added. It will also help support more precise air quality forecasts. One of the instruments collects light and analyzes the unique colors of the ocean. \"Because this ocean and color instrument gives you all of the colors of light, that tells you how you high particles are in the atmosphere. You know how high smoke or pollution is, and that’s critical for air quality,\" said Cairns. All the data they collect will be available to the public. Cetinic hopes local leaders will tap into the new technology and \"work in a better way to protect and conserve their ecosystem.\" This mission is set to launch in January, and NASA says it will collect data for at least three years.",

    "title": "Sophie Scholl : résistante engagée contre le régime nazi allemand",
    "text": "C’était une enfant joyeuse, qui adorait la nature et se montrait amicale et serviable envers les gens. Sophie Scholl, quatrième enfant de Lina et de Robert Scholl, vit le jour le 9 mai 1921 à Forchtenberg, une petite ville de l’actuel Bade-Wurtemberg. Son père était maire et sa mère, une ancienne infirmière communale, tenait le ménage. Les parents attachaient beaucoup d’importance à l’éducation et à l’autonomie ; par ailleurs, Lina Scholl transmettait aux enfants des valeurs chrétiennes.\nEn 1930, la famille Scholl déménagea à Ludwigsburg et, deux ans plus tard, ils s’installèrent à Ulm, ville dans laquelle Robert Scholl ouvrit un cabinet fiscal. L’année 1933, lorsque les nazis prirent le pouvoir en Allemagne, les cinq frères et sœurs Scholl, Inge, Hans, Elisabeth, Sophie et Werner, furent pris dans l’engrenage du nouveau régime. Contre la volonté de leurs parents, ils s’inscrivirent aux Jeunesses hitlériennes. À tout juste 13 ans, Sophie prêta également serment de fidélité à Adolf Hitler. Cependant, ce n’était pas une « jeune fille » sage ; elle était plutôt considérée comme inadaptée, sauvage et romantique. Ses journaux intimes révèlent une adolescente désespérée, agitée et qui voulait sortir de ses gonds.\nSophie Scholl aimait l’art moderne et la littérature À 16 ans, Sophie Scholl tomba amoureuse d’un élève-officier de quatre ans son aîné, Fritz Hartnagel, qui devint son premier ami. La correspondance détaillée du couple révèle comment Sophie évolua : elle devint une jeune femme réfléchie, tenant à ce que ses doutes et sa recherche d’une vie appropriée soient pris au sérieux. C’est durant ces années qu’elle s’est détournée du système nazi : elle trouvait injuste l’arrestation temporaire de ses frères et sœurs pour « Bündische Umtriebe » et oppressante la restriction de la liberté intellectuelle en Allemagne. Sophie Scholl aimait l’art moderne et la littérature, et ne comprenait pas la conception nationale-socialiste restrictive de l’art.\nLire la vidéo Dieses YouTube-Video kann in einem neuen Tab abgespielt werden YouTube öffnen Contenu tiers Nous utilisons YouTube pour intégrer un contenu qui collectera possiblement des données sur vos activités.

Please check your adblocker settings.\nAu début de la Seconde Guerre mondiale, Sophie prit clairement position et écrivit à Fritz Hartnagel : « Je n’arrive pas à comprendre que la vie des gens soit désormais sous la menace constante d’autres gens. Je ne le comprendrai jamais, et je trouve ça terrible. Ne me dis pas que c’est au nom de la patrie. » Après avoir obtenu son « Abitur », elle suivit une formation d’éducatrice à Ulm. Lorsqu’elle fut ensuite contrainte, loin de sa famille et de ses amis, de faire un an de Service du travail obligatoire du Reich, une crise profonde s’ensuivit. En 1941, Sophie Scholl remit tout en question : sa foi, son amour pour Fritz et sa propre manière d’agir, qui lui semblait trop peu cohérente.\nÉtudes de philosophie et de biologie à Munich Pleine d’espoir, elle commença en 1942 à Munich des études de philosophie et de biologie. Elle fut aussi chaleureusement accueillie par le cercle d’amis de son frère Hans, qui vivait également dans cette ville. Mais bien que Sophie avait tant attendu cette vie d’étudiante, elle ne pouvait guère en profiter. La dictature et la guerre pesaient trop pour elle. Son sentiment de devoir faire quelque chose contre le régime de l’injustice grandissait de jour en jour. Lorsqu’en juin et juillet 1942, Hans Scholl et Alexander Schmorell rédigèrent les premiers tracts de la Rose blanche , appelant à la résistance contre la dictature nazie, pour Sophie Scholl, une chose était claire : elle allait, elle aussi, s’engager dans la résistance .\nEn Allemagne, de nombreuses rues portent le nom de Sophie Scholl. © dpa/pa Il est très probable que les frères et sœurs Hans et Sophie Scholl aient parlé des projets de tracts. Dès mai 1942, Sophie demanda à son ami Fritz Hartnagel de l’argent et un bulletin de délivrance pour se procurer un « duplicateur ». Fritz jugea cette demande dangereuse. Il la mit en garde que cela pourrait lui « coûter la vie ». Malgré l’avertissement, Sophie Scholl intégra dès janvier 1943 le cœur interne de la « Rose blanche », aux côtés de Hans Scholl, Alexander Schmorell, Willi Graf, Christoph Probst et du professeur Kurt Huber.\nJe suis toujours d’avis d’avoir fait la seule chose que je pouvais faire pour mon peuple. Sophie Scholl Partager Overlay schließen Twitter Facebook Telegram Whatsapp E-Mail Le matin du 18 février 1943, Sophie et Hans Scholl furent découverts et arrêtés alors qu’ils distribuaient des tracts à l’université de Munich. Interrogée par la Gestapo, Sophie défendit son action : « Je suis toujours d’avis d’avoir fait la seule chose que je pouvais faire pour mon peuple. Je ne regrette donc pas d’avoir agi ainsi… »\nUn bâtiment du Parlement européen à Bruxelles portant le nom de Sophie Scholl. © Dpa/pa Le 22 février 1943, Sophie et Hans Scholl ainsi que Christoph Probst furent condamnés à mort par le Volksgerichtshof et exécutés le même jour. Quant aux trois autres membres de la Rose blanche, leur exécution eut lieu le 19 avril. Certaines personnes qui les soutenaient furent condamnées à de lourdes peines de prison. Aujourd’hui, Sophie Scholl, assassinée à l’âge de 21 ans, et ses camarades de lutte sont devenus des modèles pour les gens du monde entier.",

    "text": "Pour la militante écologiste Sage Lenier, \"l'IA n'apporte aucun avantage à la société\" © Patricia DE MELO MOREIRA, AFP - La militante américaine pour l'environnement Sage Lenier, fondatrice de Sustainable & Just Future, lors d'un entretien en marge du Web Summit à Lisbonne (du 11 au 14 novembre 2024). Les entreprises technologiques ne cessent de promouvoir des produits avec de l'intelligence artificielle (IA) mais cette technologie est \"inutile\", non durable, et a créé \"une crise existentielle\" pour le secteur, affirme la militante pour l'environnement, Sage Lenier. Un discours qui détonne au sein du Web Summit, qui réunit à Lisbonne le gratin des start-up et investisseurs dans les nouvelles technologies. \"L'IA n'apporte aucun avantage à la société\", assène l'Américaine, lors d'un entretien avec l'AFP en marge du sommet. Les grands patrons ont été séduits pour des produits \"inutiles\", abandonnant l'idée que la technologie doit avoir une utilité fondamentale, et maintenant ils font face à \"une crise existentielle\", soutient celle qui s'est fait connaître en 2018, à 19 ans, lorsqu'elle a créé un cours à l'université de Berkeley (Californie), intitulé \"Solutions pour un futur juste et durable\", auquel des centaines d'étudiants se sont inscrits. Sage Lenier a depuis fondé une association sur le même thème (\"Sustainable & Just Future\") et espère en tirer une série documentaire. \"Certains d'entre vous peuvent être considérés comme étant les architectes, directement responsables, de la crise écologique\", avait-elle lancé l'an dernier aux entrepreneurs lors de son intervention au Web Summit. Elle avait plaidé pour que l'économie circulaire, qui consiste à mettre en avant le recyclage et le réemploie, soit au coeur de la démarche des patrons de la \"tech\", dont les produits finissent souvent à la poubelle, alimentant le gaspillage. Appel peu entendu puisque les géants Microsoft, Google et consorts continuent à produire un flux ininterrompu de produits dopés à l'IA, technologie extrêmement énergivore, ce qui semble mettre en péril la réalisation de leurs objectifs de neutralité carbone. Pour assurer leurs besoins croissants en électricité, notamment ceux de leurs centres de stockage de données, ces mastodontes se tournent ainsi de plus en plus vers le nucléaire. - \"Gâchis d'émissions\" - L'intelligence artificielle \"est terrible pour la planète. C'est terrible pour les populations qui vivent là où on implante des centres de données. C'est juste un gâchis d'émissions (carbone)\", fustige Sage Lenier. Le secteur de la \"tech\" est pourtant \"la seule industrie, du moins en Amérique, qui a essayé pendant des années de se présenter comme verte, propre et pro-avenir\", selon l'activiste. Et de rappeler que Bill Gates, cofondateur de Microsoft, \"a écrit plusieurs livres sur le changement climatique\". Les titans de la \"teche tiennent à cette image et ont réussi à éviter jusqu'à présent l'attention et les polémiques sur les questions écologiques que peuvent connaître l'industrie de la mode ou le secteur automobile, pour Mme Lenier. \"Mais dès qu'ils ont vu les opportunités avec l'IA d'augmenter les profits des actionnaires, ils ont tous foncé\", dit-elle. Avec l'essor de l'intelligence artificielle, combinée à l'impact des autres industries, Sage Lenier prévoit un futur sombre. \"La situation va se dégrader très rapidement. La chaîne alimentaire va se briser. Nous assisterons à une malnutrition de masse voire une famine de masse\", alerte-t-elle. Le réseau électrique devrait aussi céder. \" Vous ne pouvez pas avoir de voitures sur le long terme. Peu importe qu'elles soient électriques ou non. Elles ne sont pas durables\". \"Nous ne pouvons pas continuer à produire 80 milliards de vêtements par an dans un futur bas carbone\", poursuit la jeune femme. publié le 15 novembre à 13h32, AFP",
