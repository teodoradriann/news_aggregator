    "text": "DENVILLE TWP. - It was cold, but plungers say it wasn't as cold as last year. Still, they came in droves... and in bathing suits. Early estimates said some 120 took the plunge- \"The Polar Plunge,\" that is, into Cook's Pond in Denville on Saturday, Feb. 24. The event raised about initially $20,000 for Denville S.P.A.R.K.S., which stands for \"Supportive Parents Advocating for Our Kids.\" Revised figures show an initial goal of $25,000, and an actual collection of $27,889. S.P.A.R.K.S. later said about 136 took the leap into the frigid pond this year. The non-profit group's goal is to ultimately build a group living home so that the developmentally disabled sons of several parents can live there. A show and a family fun event as much as it is a fundraiser, former Township Councilman Douglas Gabel took the plunge for the sixth time this year, dressed, of course, as a shark. Lisa Church and Brian Rogers of Hackettstown finished their plunge. it was their first time. For others, it was a family affair. Doug Sackin and Jessica Adelnan from Madison brought their three teens. All of them took the plunge. Sunday, S.P.A.R.K. posted this note on its Facebook page: \"Polar plunge 2024. 136 plungers and we raised to date 28,709. We are getting closer to building our forever home for Denville young men with challenges to live out their lives safe in our beloved community of Denville . Thank you to everyone who plunged donated or volunteered . Thank you , Know anyone who wants to donate property?\" The organization is still looking for an ideal location to construct the home. Contact [denvillespark@gmail.com](mailto:denvillespark@gmail.com) or visit [denvillespark.org](http://denvillespark.org/?fbclid=IwAR3aN_a6jbABcCQo69HGAz3d4BJLKh74q-GgfX6DszdfwuzJ6kiQ_L7sDuY) for more information about the organization, and its goals. Susan Reinhardt is the president of S.P.A.R.K. She has a 28-year-old developmentally challenged son, and she was a key organizer of the fundraiser five years ago. “Last year, we had 72 take the plunge. That was a record,” she said, in an interview before this year's plunge. The day last year also broke another record. She said it was the coldest day of the year. “We didn’t do it in 2021 because of Covid. we did it virtually, where people had to soak their heads in ice water,” she said, saying it was similar to the widely received “Ice Bucket Challenge.” As for ages, Reinhardt said there is no limit. Anyone can take the plunge, gaining pledges from friends, family members and co-workers, which go to S.P.A.R.K. to save for the group home. “We don’t really put a limit on it. We’ve had from age 10 up to 68,” she said, adding that patrons younger- or older- than that can participate. Leading the plunge each year, before Mayor Thomas Andes kicks if off by firing the cannon, are the Denville Polar Bears. “They stay in the water for 15 minutes. They come out when it ends,” she said. Most participants, meanwhile, make it a fast trip in and out of the freezing, winter water. This year, she said the Valleyview Middle School put together a team which took the plunge. She also credited the Diamond Spring Brewery, a new business in town, which is both sponsoring a team and contributing $2 per every pint sold. Several of the “Spark Sharks” also take the plunge. They’re the group of developmentally challenged adults for whom the home will be built. Most of them, she said, are in their late 20’s. All of the plunges, she said, have been held to raise funds for the eventual group home. Before this year's plunge, about $70,000 had been raised. She was hoping to raise another $20,000 from this year’s plunge, a total that was far exceeded. She estimated $100,000 is needed to build the home, with the intent of having the land donated. “We don’t have a property yet. We have some potentials, but nothing solid yet. But it will have to be soon,” she said, since many of the parents are reaching advanced age. “My son will live there once we get it built,” she said. She said the idea of the plunge actually started years ago, as a way to raise funds for a new playground. “I said hey, can you do it for me now? And that’s how we started raising money for Spark,” she said. She said she chairs the Mayor’s Council for People With Challenges, which hosts bowling trips and other activities for the adults. As for the plunge itself, she said there’s always something new, and often something amusing. “We have one Shark who likes to wear cowboy boots all the time. That’s just his thing. He’ll take them off and put his foot in the water, but that’s as far as he’ll go, she said. Meanwhile, others say “It’s too cold. Don’t make me do this again.” But then, she said, they’re right back again next year, ready to take the plunge anew. Gabel dressed as a Viking previously, but this year, came as a full-bodied shark. As for Reinhardt? Well, don’t expect to see her in the water. “I took the lead for the ice buckets. But no, I do not go in,” she said, with a laugh.

    "title": "Napoleon hat is most valuable at £1.6 million",
    "text": "A buyer has paid €1.932 millon (around £1.69m) for one of Napoleon’s trademark bicorne hats. The sale, in Paris on Sunday, makes the headgear, with its distinctive cockade of ribbons, the most valuable Napoleon hat ever sold. The two-pointed hats worn by France’s first Emperor were a well-known visual marker even during his life. Napoleon wore the hats sideways, against the prevailing fashion. He is believed to have owned 120 of them during his life. The most valuable hat before this week’s sale was sold in 2014 for nearly €1.9 m. That hat had been worn at the the Battle of Marengo in 1800. That was one of Napoleon’s most famous military triumphs. This hat has a less glorious history, and was worn by Napoleon as he returned from exile in Elba, on his way to his final defeat at Waterloo. The hat was the star item in the sale of the collection of French tycoon Col Pierre Baillon who died in 2022. It had been in the family of Napoleon’s quarter master Jean-Louis Noisiez for much of its history. The distinctive tricolore ribbons also tied it to the emperor. Just 20 of Napoleon’s hats are believed to survive, only 5 of them in private hands. Sales are rare. The auction was a rich hunting ground for Napoleon enthusiasts. It also included a nightshirt, a vanity case, and a plate nabbed from his carriage after Waterloo. The release of a new Napoleon biopic means interest in the Corsican-born leader is especially high. Napoleon rose from relatively humble origins in a newly conquered French province to head an Empire that controlled much of Western Europe. His skills as a military tactician are universally acknowledged. His political legacy is still disputed. The emperor’s sword sold for £3 million in 2007. The engagement ring he gave to Josephine (his wife, who plays an enormous role in his legend) sold for nearly $1 million in 2013. Both would undoubtedly make much more if sold today.

    "title": "Genuine Parts Surges To Lead S&P 500 Gains Thursday—Here's Why",
    "text": "Key Takeaways Genuine Parts beat profit estimates and raised its outlook as acquisitions helped lift automotive parts sales. The company behind the NAPA Auto Parts brand saw a decline in sales at its Industrial Parts Group. CFO Will Stengel said Genuine Parts showed operating discipline as it faced slow sales growth.

Questa notizia è stata rivelata dal suo allenatore, Carlos Moya. Nadal ha avuto un fastidio alla coscia durante l'allenamento di ieri mattina. Nel pomeriggio, i suoi movimenti erano più limitati e, per evitare che la situazione peggiorasse, ha deciso di fermarsi. Oggi, giovedì 25 luglio, Nadal non si è allenato con Alex Zverev, come era previsto. Moya ha dichiarato che nelle prossime 48 ore si capirà se Nadal potrà partecipare o meno al torneo di tennis di Parigi 2024. \"C’è stato un contrattempo e abbiamo deciso che oggi Rafa si sarebbe riposato, senza allenarsi, così da recuperare. Ci diamo 48 ore, dobbiamo aspettare\", ha detto Moya. La notizia ha causato preoccupazione nel clan spagnolo del tennis alle Olimpiadi di Parigi 2024. Dopo aver preso parte alla cerimonia dei sorteggi dei tabelloni del torneo a Cinque Cerchi, Nadal ha deciso di annullare due sedute d’allenamento previste per oggi. Originariamente, avrebbe dovuto allenarsi con il tedesco Alexander Zverev, ma a causa del problema alla gamba destra accusato ieri pomeriggio, si è deciso di non forzare.",

The late Dr. Pieter Noomen, a psychotherapist and senior minister of three Protestant churches, might suggest heeding the words of what he called the Real Reality, the name he used for what others might call Allah, the Holy Father, Jehovah or any of the other many names for God.\nDr. Noomen died in 2019, but he left behind many writings of what he said were his own personal conversations with the Real Reality, and they remain available today, free for anyone to access, at his website, www.wordsforall.org\nMost of those writings are what Dr. Noomen said were direct quotes from the Real Reality, and this is one such quote pertaining to war:\n\"On earth, in individuals and in nature, so much pure energy is siphoned off and used for destructive purposes like hurting, destroying and killing. The substance of life's nature – as bubbling with joy and creative passion – is so fragmented that it is an alien concept for many people. Earth is indeed 'planet Zero,' hanging in an 'impossible' position between the truth and its denial. Fire, literally and figuratively, is used by people to wage wars, to intimidate, to impose their will by force. In nature, it is barely contained and, in many ways, remains a threat. This is also what goes on in people's internals …\nAll the horrors and cruelties of people killing people, how can we not be shocked, hurt, saddened and, for many, scared?”\nAnd this, according to Dr. Noomen, was the Real Reality’s own answer:\n“Only one reaction is a foolproof contribution to stopping the madness of violence: It is rigorously cleansing our own personal thinking of anything negative. That way, we create and carry inside us a lasting, untouchable pocket of peace.\"\nThe question remains whether humankind will get the message in time to find that pocket of peace.\nDr. Noomen was a staff member of a Los Angeles metropolitan church, where he engaged in helping with mental health issues like suicide prevention and hospice. His writings remain free for anyone on this website: (www.wordsforall.org).\nAn example of Dr. Noomen’s “Words of Wisdom,” one of the many categories on his website:\n\"In order to be a decent and creative person, the best possible, we don't need religious ceremonies or symbols – Christmas, Ramadan, worship services, prayer routines, etc. … Yet religion 'can be fun' if it stimulates caring attitudes, healing actions and a positive togetherness.\"\nMedia Contact\nCompany Name: Ascot Media Group, Inc.\nContact Person: Gloria Gonzalez\nEmail: Send Email\nPhone: 281.333.3507\nAddress: Post Office Box 2394\nCity: Friendswood\nState: TX 77549\nCountry: United States\nWebsite: http://www.ascotmedia.com/",

    "text": "Estoy en Benjamín Franklin 84 bajo la luz tenue de la única lámpara que todavía funciona en la sede del PRD. El joven notificador del Instituto Nacional Electoral acaba de entregarme —en mi calidad de presidente del partido— la sentencia de muerte del Sol Azteca : un tajo limpio en la yugular. Gracias, murmuré, y arrojé el documento a la viejísima trituradora, solo para descubrir que esta ha perdido también la voluntad de funcionar. La autoridad ha sentenciado —palabras más, palabras menos— que nuestra votación no nos permite seguir recibiendo recursos públicos. Que ya no representamos a nadie. Se ensañan con los débiles. Así lo ordena el dictador, el tabasqueño. Un tal Ricardo Badín ha sido designado como interventor. Será él quien revise mis tickets y apague el sol. Me preparo para rescatar mis memorias de sus liquidadoras manos. Recorro las oficinas, hoy cubiertas de telarañas, de un partido que alguna vez clamó por democracia y patria para todos. Encuentro añicos de poder. A lo lejos, diviso, enmarcado en la sucia pared, un viejo periódico clandestino. Me acerco con dificultad —cada paso cargado con el peso de los años y las traiciones— y releo la narración de mis inocentes días como guerrillero en la Liga Comunista 23 de Septiembre . ¿Y todo para qué? Esas ideas ingenuas solo me trajeron el disparo que destrozó mi mandíbula y casi me mata. Ya ni creo en todo aquello. Hace mucho que lo acepté: décadas antes de aprender a pronunciar correctamente el bisílabo Xóchitl. Con furia, arrojo el cuadro asegurándome que el vidrio quede tan pulverizado como mis convicciones. Hay más futuro en ese vidrio que en este hombre. Sigo hurgando en las cajas que guardan evidencia de la última parte del siglo pasado. Las fotografías muestran la magnitud de lo que fuimos: una marea amarilla. Es 1997 y un baño de sol vitorea en la Plaza de la Constitución a Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas. El hombre que iba a salvarnos y que no pudo salvarse ni a sí mismo. Éramos felices y lo sabíamos. Suspiro. Fuimos la segunda fuerza política del país y gobernábamos (esa serena, lejana y magnífica palabra: gobernar) la Ciudad de México, las tierras montañosas que Monreal se niega a soltar, Michoacán, Baja California Sur, Tlaxcala, Guerrero, Chiapas... un mundo. Me aseguro de que no haya nadie en la oficina al sentir una solitaria lágrima acariciar mi mejilla. Cierro la caja a medio camino entre la nostalgia y el respeto. Lindo pasamos. Desde no tan lejos, un archivero oxidado me hace señales con su herrumbre. El cajón entreabierto murmura mi religioso nombre. ¿La etiqueta? Paso mi dedo para descubrir las letras negras bajo el polvo: desafuero. ¡Si tan solo sirviera la trituradora! Huyo enfurecido a mi oficina y azoto la puerta con tal fuerza que la diana para dardos cae al suelo. Una fotografía al centro. Es Andrés Manuel López Obrador : la tragedia de mi vida. Su imagen me mira con mueca burlona, ese engreído, un hombre normal que se cree fantástico. Un ingrato que despreció 23 años de militancia como si nada significaran. Su recuerdo me golpea como una rama. Su éxito me enferma. Recojo el viejo calendario que se quedó congelado en el día maldito: 9 de septiembre 2012. ¿Cómo olvidarlo? Estuve de luto mucho tiempo. La corriente obradorista se separó oficialmente de nosotros y terminó por desfondar al partido. Un poco de alquimia, visión a largo plazo, rojo y azul y ¡tarán!: nuestro radiante amarillo se convirtió en guinda. ¡Guinda! Retumban en mi cabeza las palabras macuspanas en aquel Zócalo repleto: “Nada me deben, nada les debo. Estamos en paz”. Mentiroso. Mil veces mentiroso. Obrador se llevó mi paz. Y al pueblo. Hago un esfuerzo por no admitir que es él —y él solo— lo que me sostiene en el tenue borde de la relevancia. Intento tranquilizarme, no todo es lágrima o reproche. Respiro con anhelo y camino hacia un mapa que cuelga de la pared. A la República mexicana lo tiñen tres colores: rojo, azul y amarillo. ¡Qué tiempos aquellos! El papel proclama: “Pacto por México: todos trabajando por ti”. Sonrío consciente de la ambigüedad del pronombre. Esos fueron buenos tiempos con buenos amigos. Qué lástima que terminaron tan rápido. Ojalá 2012 durara para siempre. Pero me han abandonado, estoy solo. Ellos están en Madrid o con el futuro resuelto. Yo, en cambio, apenas marginal. Salvo que el INE se compre el cuento de mis impugnaciones, ni una pluri podré ganar... ¡Qué ciego fui! Yo, que estudié para físico matemático, fallé con los números más esenciales. ¿Dónde se metió ese 3% que se creyó la patraña de la izquierda moderna, de la socialdemocracia a la finlandesa? Tendré que confiar la defensa de la democracia en los compañeros Cortés y Moreno; en sus colmillos y en sus garras. En cambio, no espero nada de mis viejos colegas de partido que saltaron a tiempo del barco: Barrales, Noroña, Monreal, Delgado, Ebrard. Ellos al senado, yo a la casa. Los traidores son siempre traidores. Me queda mi compadre Guadalupe y su oferta de fundar un nuevo partido. Profetiza que con Claudio y la valiente Xóchitl regresarán a nuestras manos los tiempos de poder y de gloria. ¿Tendré tiempo de empezar de nuevo yo que solo huelo a pasado? Es tarde, debo ir a casa. Quizás pase a ver a Jesús Ortega; últimamente siempre está disponible. Hablar con él es volver a vivir. Lo que pudimos ser, lo que ya no fuimos. Los dos Jesús lo tenemos claro: el anatema es uno e indiviso. Echo un último vistazo a las oficinas antes de cerrar la puerta. No me llevo nada: a todo pueden prenderle fuego. El INE, con su oficio, cree que ha matado un partido, un astro. En realidad, ha matado a un hombre.
