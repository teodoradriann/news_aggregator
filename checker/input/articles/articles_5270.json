At first he thought it was just water from his washing machine.\nPower outages: Hundreds of thousands of customers lost power from strong, damaging winds\n\"I had to go to the main line to turn it off and then there was still a buzzing sound and what looked like steam, but it end up being smoke,\" Bures said.\nHours later, another neighbor experienced the same thing.\n\"My wall was getting warm and I could hear the buzzing,\" Dave Noyes said.\nThey called the Omaha Fire Department who determined their houses had become electrified — and they weren't the only ones.\n\"We assessed those situations, found a third home that was also affected and waited for OPPD to assist us in de-energizing those homes,\" Battalion Chief Tim Gilman said.\nList: Highest wind gust reports from Wednesday's severe storms in Nebraska, Iowa\nThe houses were charged with energy causing siding to smolder and wires to smoke. For safety reasons, the firefighters couldn't put out the fires until the power was off, especially on Bures' home.\n\"They had to tear off some siding, I've got steel siding,\" Bures said.\nThe cause is still being investigated.\n\"It appears right now that they've also got a line down in a church property nearby that may have started the main issue,\" Gilman said.\nBures also said its possible an incorrectly set up generator could've fed too much power back into the system, but nothing has been confirmed.",

    "text": "Let’s Talk Mental Health – A Witty Reflection Ah, the power of speech ! Where would we be without it? Probably stuck in a silent film, waving our arms around like we’ve just seen a ghost, or at best, trying to mime the message of our mental health struggles with a series of increasingly frantic charades! But fear not, for as history shows us, conversation can spark revolutions—and we’re not just talking about those awkward dinner parties where uncle Gerald insists on sharing his thoughts on the government’s handling of… well, anything.\nSo, you might be wondering: what has the mouth-wagging of history ever done for us? According to Michel de Certeau, the answer is: “plenty!” In his musings on the upheaval known as May ’68, he describes an explosion of voices, previously silenced—like someone finally turning the mic back on at karaoke after being cut off by a bad rendition of “Wonderwall.” All these voices came together in a cacophony of unfiltered truth, a raw and glorious riot of experiences, demanding recognition and rights. Because let’s face it: if you can’t talk about your oppression in a civil way, how do you plan to make any improvements?\nFranco Basaglia: The Original Voice of Reason Enter Franco Basaglia, the man with a spirit so liberating, it could set the whole of Italy dancing like a late-night infomercial! His influence over the deinstitutionalization movement wasn’t just a game-changer; it was the entire game board flipped on its head! He fought the good fight, leading a crusade to shut down mental hospitals, taking edges off the horrifying fusion of mental illness and social danger, and giving rights back to those who needed them most. Picture that: a brave band of scrubs and suits storming the gates of despair—less a riot and more a revolutionary tea party!\nBut alas, as we celebrate Basaglia’s legacy, we must admit that nearly a century later, the battle isn’t won—it’s just in a very uneasy stalemate. Mental health services today are like those flimsy paper umbrellas in your tropical drink: pretty useless when it starts pouring! People are left feeling abandoned, navigating fragmented care like a game of Minesweeper, trying to avoid the perilous gaps in treatment. The conundrum becomes glaring: how do we move from complacency to necessity? We need more than a polite conversation—we need a full-on debate, or at the very least, a lively discussion over tea and biscuits!\nWhere Are All the Good Services Gone? Most troubling is the reality faced by our most vulnerable populations, from the young and intellectually disabled to those trapped behind bars. And believe me, these are not just the *punchlines* in a stand-up set—this is serious stuff. If you thought trying to get a reservation at a trendy restaurant was tough, try getting mental health services! In a world that’s become more reactive than proactive, our beloved young adults often find themselves adrift, sent packing back to families or social services, with no clue how to manage their mental wellness. It’s like sending a cat to fetch the newspaper—doesn’t seem likely to end well!\nTime for a National Dialogue! So, what’s the plan? Hold onto your hats, because there’s a shoutout for action at the II National self-managed conference for mental health ! This isn’t just your average meeting of the minds; it’s a collective effort to build bridges between voices—those inside institutions and those still waiting outside for service. Imagine associations, cooperatives, and health professionals turning up for a conference and agreeing on something. With any luck, they’ll roll up their sleeves and dig into some real progress.\nIn the grand tradition of Basaglia, we must aim for a community-driven reform of mental health assistance. The key lies in our collective will—not just passing policies but embodying the spirit behind them. The 180 law laid down the groundwork, but as we all know, it takes a village to raise a… financially viable mental health service! So let’s put our heads together, because if we can’t talk about these issues, how can we ever hope to solve them?\nFinal Thoughts: Talk is Cheap, but It Comes with a Price! In conclusion, let’s not wait for someone else to get the conversation rolling. Whether you’re a mental health advocate or just a well-meaning partygoer, there’s much to be discussed and even more to be done! Together, we can ensure that the voices—those sleeping treasures of experience—are awakened, revitalized, and heard! In the words of the truly wise, “Let’s get talking!” After all, if we’re going to stir things up, we might as well do it with humour, charm, and just a touch of cheekiness!\nIf throughout history there has been a notable progression towards democracy and the acknowledgment of rights, this evolution is often a result of powerful acts of speech . This phenomenon is particularly significant when the voices being raised belong to those who have been systematically silenced by societal structures that favor certain narratives over others, stripping many of their fundamental right to speak out.\n“What happened was this: we started talking. It seemed like it was the first time. From everywhere came treasures, sleeping or silent, of experiences never named.” Thus, Michel de Certeau, in his seminal essay The Taking of the Word, reflects on the dramatic emergence of diverse and uncharted voices during the revolutionary fervor of May ’68. This era saw the rise of varied, fragmented, and eclectic subjectivities fueled by an array of needs and aspirations, often in conflict with one another; yet they unified in their quest to articulate oppression, turning a shared societal anguish into a driving force for newfound freedoms and rights.\nThis transformative process is epitomized by the groundbreaking work of Franco Basaglia and the deinstitutionalization movement, which led to the closure of mental hospitals and the enactment of Law 180. This pivotal reform represented an epoch-making exercise of speech by individuals on both sides of the walls—whether clad in scrubs or not, including patients, psychiatrists, nurses, administrators, student activists, relatives, and global allies—who collectively authored a cultural, legal, and organizational revolution. By abolishing mental hospitals and establishing community-centered approaches to treatment and support, they restored rights and a sense of citizenship to those experiencing mental distress, actively dismantling the stigma surrounding mental illness and the antiquated association of such conditions with social danger.\nHowever, 100 years after Franco Basaglia’s birth and nearly 50 years after the passage of Law 180, the initial momentum toward reform remains unfinished and faces an array of significant challenges. Mental health services today are increasingly underfunded and incapable of addressing the complex needs of individuals, their families, and their communities. Many feel abandoned, receiving disjointed care that emphasizes pharmacological solutions over holistic approaches, reflecting a concerning regression to a psychiatric model that neglects prevention and community engagement. This crisis is particularly acute in prisons and migrant centers, as well as among young people with intellectual disabilities who, upon reaching adulthood, find themselves without adequate resources when child neuropsychiatry services cease to support them. Frequently, these young individuals are rerouted to social services or left to rely on families to seek professional help, often encountering barriers to access psychiatric care, especially during acute episodes or severe psychological distress.\nThe issues surrounding mental health will be prominently addressed during the upcoming II National Self-Managed Conference for Mental Health , scheduled for December 6 and 7 in Rome. This gathering will convene a diverse coalition of associations, cooperatives, foundations, networks, professionals, and practitioners, all determined to galvanize a social mobilization effort aimed at building new alliances both within and outside institutional frameworks. As Benedetto Saraceno aptly stated in Psicopolitica (2019), there exists a “fine web” woven by institutions around services and interventions, yet an active, everyday grassroots network is already emerging, confronting suffering and advocating for health and rights in both formal and informal spaces across urban landscapes. To drive meaningful change, it is crucial to prioritize a comprehensive reform of the mental health support and protection system, echoing the community-focused direction outlined by Law 180. This strategy must ensure that treatment pathways are accessible within individuals’ lived environments, particularly during critical moments, through tailored recovery and empowerment projects. Franco Basaglia himself understood the daunting challenge ahead, acknowledging that successful implementation of Law 180 hinged on a robust grassroots commitment to countering systemic shortcomings and stagnation. He articulated that while legislation could facilitate reform, it could never guarantee its success without active participation from the populace dedicated to reshaping institutional management.\n**Interview with Mental ⁢Health Advocate: Dr. Claudia Romano**\n**Editor:** Welcome,‌ Dr. Romano!⁣ Today, we’re ⁢diving ‌into a significant yet often overlooked chapter of mental health history — the transformative work‌ of Franco Basaglia in Italy. Can you tell us a bit about why Basaglia’s approach was ⁢revolutionary?\n**Dr. Romano:** Thank you for having me! Basaglia’s​ methodology was ‍revolutionary because he fundamentally shifted the perception of mental health care in Italy. Prior to his influence, ⁤mental illness was largely stigmatized, and individuals were⁣ often imprisoned in asylums under abhorrent conditions. Basaglia advocated for ​the closure of these institutions and emphasized community-centered care, allowing patients ⁢to reclaim their autonomy and rights. It was about treating people as ‍humans first, rather than merely managing their symptoms.\n**Editor:** Absolutely! His efforts culminated in the enactment of Law 180, which aimed to deinstitutionalize the mental​ health system. In your view, how has this reform impacted mental health ⁢services ⁤in Italy ⁢today?\n**Dr. Romano:** ⁤Law 180 was groundbreaking, but it’s important to recognize‍ that we still face significant challenges nearly fifty years ​later. While we ⁢initially moved away from institutional care, ⁣many mental health ‌services are currently underfunded and fragmented. Today, ​people ⁤still encounter barriers to accessing the support they ⁤need. Basaglia’s vision ⁣of comprehensive care is​ sorely needed, but the reality is that many individuals are left navigating a ‍system that feels more reactive than⁢ proactive.\n**Editor:**⁤ That sounds frustrating. You mentioned fragmented care. Can you elaborate on what that looks like for⁤ individuals seeking help?\n**Dr. Romano:** Certainly. Imagine this: someone struggling with​ anxiety‍ or depression might first seek help from ⁣a general practitioner,⁢ who could prescribe⁢ medication. However, the patient ​may have ⁣to wait weeks for a therapy appointment, and once they ‌finally see a mental health professional, they might receive a different treatment philosophy that doesn’t align with their needs. This ⁣inconsistency⁢ can create⁣ feelings of abandonment and confusion, much like trying to⁢ play a game without knowing the rules.\n**Editor:** It’s troubling to think about how ⁢many people are⁢ left adrift in that system. What role do you think national​ dialogues and conferences, like the II National self-managed conference for mental⁤ health, play in improving this situation?\n**Dr. ⁢Romano:** ⁢These conferences are vital! They bring together various stakeholders—patients, practitioners, and policymakers—to discuss pressing issues in ⁤mental‍ health care. It’s⁤ a⁤ platform for sharing experiences and ‌ideas, fostering understanding that can lead to collaborative solutions. Just like‍ Basaglia brought together communities‍ to ​dismantle systemic barriers, these dialogues can inspire renewed commitment towards implementing ⁤meaningful reforms.\n**Editor:** As we‌ consider the future of mental health care, ‌how can we continue to honor Basaglia’s legacy while ‌ensuring progress?\n**Dr. ​Romano:** Continuing Basaglia’s legacy requires collective⁢ action. Advocacy is key. We must engage in ‍ongoing conversations about mental ⁣health, ⁤push for better funding, and ensure that services are community-focused ⁣rather than institution-based. Furthermore, integrating this work into ‍society’s fabric—whether through education, family support, or workplace initiatives—can⁤ create an environment where ‍mental health is prioritized. It’s about⁣ maintaining the momentum ⁣he sparked—we ‌can’t afford to‌ go back.\n**Editor:** That’s an inspiring thought, Dr. Romano! To wrap⁢ up, what⁢ message would you‍ like to leave our audience with ⁤regarding mental health advocacy today?\n**Dr. Romano:** Remember, mental⁣ health⁤ affects everyone at various‍ levels. ⁤Let’s talk about it openly and without stigma. Share your experiences,‌ support those who are struggling , and be a catalyst for change in your community. Just‍ like in Basaglia’s time, ⁤every voice matters. So let’s make sure ‌all voices ​are heard!\n**Editor:** Thank you for ⁤sharing your insights, Dr. Romano. It’s clear that the⁤ legacy of Franco Basaglia‍ continues to resonate deeply and reminds us of the ongoing need for reform in mental​ health care. Let’s keep the‌ conversation going!",

    "text": "Thursday, June 13th 2024, 3:33 pm The man accused of leading Tulsa County deputies on a pursuit Wednesday evening has been identified. The Tulsa County Sheriff's Office said James Pennington, 48, was pulled over just before 7:30 p.m. when a deputy observed him driving erratically on eastbound I-44 near Harvard Ave. TCSO said Pennington pulled over initially but drove off once the deputy exited his vehicle. Pennington drove to 51st Street, ran a red light at Yale Avenue where he crashed into another vehicle, authorities say. TCSO said he ran from the crash into nearby LaFortune Park, where bystanders tackled him and restrained him. Deputies arrested Pennington, who had outstanding warrants prior to the brief pursuit. Empty beer cans were also found in his vehicle, TCSO said. He is in custody accused of DUI, felony eluding, leaving the scene of an accident, reckless driving and transporting an open container, TCSO said. The woman he crashed into was taken to a local hospital to be evaluated, her condition was not released.

    "title": "Terrarium startup OBEnaturelle tops 2023 Hen Hatch - Delaware Business Times",
    "text": "Terrarium startup OBEnaturelle tops 2023 Hen Hatch Share NEWARK – Lauren Roberts caught the entrepreneurial bug at a young age. When the Newark resident was only in third grade, she had already launched her own small business selling fake nails made from paper. Over the years, she would evolve to selling candies and crafts she’d created through the unofficial “Lauren’s Galore Store.” Now, the 20-year-old University of Delaware sophomore has a full-fledged small business focused on plants — an endeavor that already netted her $20,000 in revenue in its first six months and earned the attention of a panel of judges at this year’s Hen Hatch startup competition. “What I have right now is an established system,” she said, noting that the company she started right before high school paused for a while as she transitioned to college. Now, with the support and earnings from the latest contest and other offerings through UD, Roberts hopes to focus more on marketing and scaling her company to get it back to that initial success. The pitch for [her company](https://obenaturelle.com/), OBEnaturelle, which not only offers direct sales of plants, terrarium kits and other merchandise but also corporate or private workshops and parties, caught the attention of the contest’s four judges: Dave Liss, of W.L. Gore & Associates, Mac Macleod, of Carvertise; Wendy Scott, of Blue Blaze Associates; and Glenn Glady, of Robin Hood Ventures. Roberts topped all finalists in this year’s Hen Hatch contest, taking with her $8,300 in funding, $1,000 in Shoprite gift cards and over 30 hours of legal, marketing and workforce services. Hen Hatch is UD Horn Entrepreneurship’s “premier pitch competition,” explained faculty coordinator Daniel Lee, an assistant professor in the Alfred Lerner College of Business & Economics. The multi-round contest starts in the summer with students submitting a multi-page business plan, then moves on to the semifinals and mentoring before whittling down to the four final entrepreneurs who [presented this fall](https://horn.udel.edu/an-epicenter-for-innovation-2023-hen-hatchs-final-round). “It’s important for the students because it gets them boots-on-the-ground experience pitching to a panel of investors,” Lee said. “It’s important to them also because they get help and feedback on these student-run ventures.” It also gives the surrounding business community a closer look at the entrepreneurial spirit and talent coming from the university, while also staying connected to the local business community, he said. Roberts, who is studying entrepreneurship and on track to graduate in 2026, joined marketing student Ian Drogowitz, entrepreneurship and fashion merchandising major Samantha McGhee and entrepreneurship and management student Nicholai Williamson as this year’s Hen Hatch finalists. Lee said this year’s finalists focused a lot on what he would call “disruptive business models” rather than deep-tech or intellectual property. Businesses like ONEnaturelle are those that have already been deployed in the market, and not something that needs years of development in a laboratory. “When you’re in the mid-Atlantic, it’s sort of easy to overlook Delaware. It’s a small state. In northern Delaware, you can look to Philly for a lot of these innovations,” Lee said. “But we have a bunch of [bright, young minds](https://delawarebusinesstimes.com/news/hospitality-app-uds-hen-hatch/) working on really cool things at UD.”",
