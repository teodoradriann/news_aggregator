    "text": "Flooding rain is very possible Saturday as a nor'easter works up the coast Saturday. Damaging winds will be possible, too. Then, coastal flooding will get the shore next week. Enter your favorite South Jersey spring scenes for [Joe Martucci's Photo Contest](https://pressofatlanticcity.com/contests/spring-photo-contest/)! Storm summary Rain will begin between 1 and 4 a.m. Saturday. Expect a washout, with afternoon thunderstorms possible. Rain will then end between 5 and 7 p.m. Road, stream and creek flooding will be a concern. Winds will be strong Saturday afternoon into Sunday. Power outages and wind damage will be possible. Coastal flooding will develop Sunday and may last until Wednesday. Flood watch A flood watch was issued Thursday afternoon by the National Weather Service for Saturday. This includes all of South Jersey and the Jersey Shore. People are also reading… In all, expect one to two inches of rain west of a line from Millville to Mays Landing to Toms River. East of there, 2 to 3½ inches of rain will be likely. Since fall, New Jersey has been plain wet. With another record rain occurring two Saturdays ago, farmers and residents are cautiously optistimic that all this rain could be a good thing. A dry, chilly Friday After being absent from the Northeast most of the winter, the polar vortex is now here, just as soon as winter wraps up. It'll be a cold morning. Inland lows will be 20-25 degrees inland and near 30 at the shore. That's more like a January morning than a late March one. Afternoon highs will be 45-50 degrees. The fire weather danger will be lower than Thursday's. Still, it's wise to limit your burning outside. Humidity in the Pinelands will stay low, and the ground will still be dry. The winds will just be much calmer. Early sun will give way to clouds. You'll have a cloudy but rain-free Friday evening. That'll signal the incoming storm. Light rain showers will begin 1 to 4 a.m. Saturday. Saturday morning Winds and rain intensity will increase. Expect a steady, light rain, turning moderate. Winds will be breezy out of the southeast. Gusts of 20 to 30 mph will be likely. While this will cancel most of your outdoor work or plans, there won't be any significant problems. Saturday afternoon This will be the worst part of the storm. A windswept rain will create the possibility of flooding. It'll definitely be tough driving either way. A steady rain will fall, accumulating a half-inch per hour at the peak. With the ground getting soaked, it leaves trees and power lines more vulnerable to being blown over by the wind. Winds will come from the southeast, and then the northeast. Expect sustained winds of 20 to 30 mph. Gusts will clock over 40 to 45 mph. Saturday night-Sunday Wind damage and power outage concerns will continue. Strong winds out of the north will howl in the 40s. Temperatures will take a tumble into the 30s. Wind chills will be in the 20s. Sunday will then rise up to around 50 degrees, so we'll drop the wind chills. Coastal flooding Minor stage coastal flooding will start during the Sunday p.m. high tide and then at least into the Monday high tides. Since we're not near the full or new moon, I expect this to be minor stage flooding, the nuisance kind we see a few dozen times a year. Traveling around the bayside towns will be OK, but watch for the salt water. Don't drive through it. It's a little unusual to have coastal flooding after a coastal storm, but that's what we have. That's because the onshore winds don't pick up until Saturday afternoon and strong winds will carry after the storm into Sunday. Then, there's another storm way offshore early next week that will throw onshore winds our way. That'll funnel water into the bays. A final note Finally, Thursday was in unusual company. More than likely, March 21 was the coldest day of the month. According to the Iowa Environmental Mesonet, that only happens 15% of the time at Atlantic City International Airport in Egg Harbor Township. In Atlantic City, it's only happened 19% of the time.

America stands against tyranny and against oppression. America stands with the people of Ukraine,” the report states. In this regard, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken added that the United States strongly condemns Russian horrific strikes across Ukraine. “As Putin continues his brutal war of aggression, we must support Ukraine in defending itself. Congress needs to act in the new year,” Blinken noted. A reminder that, on December 29, 2023, United States President Joseph Biden stated that the Russian dictator had confirmed with the recent strikes that his objectives in Ukraine remained unchanged. [Biden emphasized that the Russian aggressor must be stopped](https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-ato/3806696-biden-putins-objective-remains-unchanged-he-must-be-stopped.html), as he poses a threat to the security of the whole of Europe and raises the risk of the United States being pulled into the war.

Preluding Friday's dicey weather, wind chills are expected to drop to as low as minus-5 degrees overnight on Thursday. Precipitation is expected to begin Friday evening in Grand Island -- with Kearney, Hastings and every town in between in the same position. The forecast calls for a high of 33 degrees on Friday, dipping to a low of 28. “Main concern lies with low-level and surface temperatures, as models are showing the potential for freezing rain/freezing drizzle to occur,” the weather service office in Hastings said. People are also reading… What’s more, outright rain and snow are not out of the question. The wet, icy weather is expected to linger into the overnight hours and possibly into Saturday morning. But as you break out the ice melt, take this forecast with a grain of salt. While the weather service says the greatest chances for precipitation are along and east of Highway 281, even a change of a couple degrees could make all the difference. As the forecasters say, “There are differences between models with temperatures, which affects confidence.” But you can increase your confidence as you hit the roads — or even step outside on the porch — by behaving as if surfaces are slick. AAA offers the following tips for driving on slick surfaces: - Drive slowly. Always adjust your speed down to account for lower traction when driving on snow or ice. - Accelerate and decelerate slowly. Apply the gas slowly to regain traction and avoid skids. Don’t try to get moving in a hurry and take time to slow down for a stoplight. Remember: It takes longer to slow down on icy roads. - Increase your following distance to five to six seconds. This increased margin of safety will provide the longer distance needed if you have to stop.",

    "text": "The Winter Woes of Delhi's Construction Workers\nThis piece highlights the plight of Delhi's construction workers, who face seasonal job losses due to winter pollution control measures. Many are forced into alternative, low-paying jobs to make ends meet, and struggle with debt and uncertain futures as pollution levels necessitate ongoing work bans.\n- Country:\n- India\nAs Delhi enforces pollution control measures each winter, thousands of construction workers find themselves without employment.\nRaju Singh, a mason, voices the devastating impact these job losses have on families, who barely manage to scrape by with meager earnings from alternative employment like vegetable selling or sewing.\nWhile pollution strategies are seen as essential for public health, for workers like Ajay Kumar and Rina Devi, the bans perpetuate cycles of debt. The ongoing challenge of balancing workers' needs with environmental protections requires urgent attention from both policymakers and support agencies.\n(With inputs from agencies.)\nAdvertisement\nALSO READ\n[Indian Americans Rally for Sanctions on Bangladesh](/article/law-order/3159566-indian-americans-rally-for-sanctions-on-bangladesh)[Indian Americans Push Trump to Sanction Bangladesh](/article/law-order/3159567-indian-americans-push-trump-to-sanction-bangladesh)[Delhi Enforces Strict Ban on Older Vehicles to Tackle Severe Air Pollution](/article/headlines/3159613-delhi-enforces-strict-ban-on-older-vehicles-to-tackle-severe-air-pollution)[Ronaldo's Heroics Propel Portugal; UEFA Clash Abandoned Amidst Tensions](/article/sports-games/3159598-ronaldos-heroics-propel-portugal-uefa-clash-abandoned-amidst-tensions)[Cedar-IBSi Capital's Strategic Leap into Banking Tech Startups](/article/headlines/3159896-cedar-ibsi-capitals-strategic-leap-into-banking-tech-startups)",
