    "title": "Xbox ha ritardato dichiarato esclusivamente a causa del programma Game Pass 2024",
    "text": "L'imminente gioco di ruolo di Obsidian, Avowed, avrebbe dovuto uscire a questo punto, ma alla fine il gioco è stato posticipato a febbraio 2025 all'inizio di quest'anno. Anche se i ritardi in questo settore spesso si verificano a causa dell'evoluzione delle tempistiche di sviluppo, Xbox insiste su questo punto non lo è il caso con Avowed. Parlando in una nuova intervista con Game File, il boss di Xbox Phil Spencer ha parlato un po' di Avowed e del suo prossimo lancio. Fondamentalmente, Phil afferma che il frenetico programma di Xbox Game Pass del team questo autunno ha fatto sì che Microsoft potesse permettersi di ritardare il titolo al prossimo anno. “Io e Matt Booty pianifichiamo il tutto, parliamo con il team di Game Pass. Diciamo: 'Okay, quali sono i grandi lanci in arrivo?' Abbiamo anche STALKER, che non è nemmeno in quella lista, ma ovviamente per noi è un lancio molto significativo. Abbiamo detto: 'Okay, assicuriamoci di procedere un po' meglio'”. Naturalmente, questo ragionamento non si riferisce al team di sviluppo non sfruttare il respiro extra che questo ritardo offre loro. Phil afferma che Obsidian “sfrutterà il tempo” mentre continua a perfezionare Avowed per il suo lancio su Xbox Game Pass su 18 febbraio. Per quanto riguarda la gamma Xbox Game Pass che Avowed sta ora evitando, abbiamo in arrivo Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 e Stalker 2 questo mesecon Indiana Jones and the Great Circle di Bethesda che seguirà all'inizio di dicembre. Ritardare Avowed probabilmente è stata la scelta giusta alla fine!",

    "text": "Nothing replaces blood, so donating is an essential gesture. In France, more than a million patients are treated each year and need it.\nThis Tuesday, November 5, solidarity was in the spotlight in Trèbes , where the French Blood Establishment (EFS) and the Blood Donor Association saw generations of donors respond to their call.\nA generous gesture 58 people including 51 donors and 5 new ones! All participants congratulated the volunteers of the Amicale de Trèbes for their good humor and their musical tastes which never cease to create a very friendly atmosphere.\nGrowing participation Under the dynamic presidency of Christophe Saint-Marc, the Association of Trebean Blood Donors has doubled its participation. Seven years ago, the first collection had 29 donors, while the penultimate brought together more than 60.\nChristophe Saint-Marc, Jean-Claude Hariot-Lassiva, and Marie de Freitas, the “three musketeers” of the association, worked tirelessly to promote the importance of collections in Trèbes and its surroundings. Their commitment made it possible to reach more than thirty municipalities, supported by local media coverage.\nIn recognition of this enthusiasm, EFS Occitanie has decided to add a fourth annual collection in Trèbes for 2025: they will now take place in February, June, September and December.\nA new partnership: Today’s collection also welcomed Suzanne Devèze, volunteer from the League Against Cancer, to raise awareness of the links between blood donations and cancer treatments.\n“Blood donation is crucial for 40% of people with cancer, especially those requiring transfusions due to chemotherapy,” she recalled.",

    "title": "NYC’s cutthroat and chaotic battle for rental apartments leaves tenants desperate and defeated",
    "text": "By Mary K. Jacob ,\n47 minutes ago\nThe hunt for a New York City apartment has gone from frustrating to downright feral.\nThis summer, renters are battling it out like never before, all for a shot at a roof over their heads in a city where landlords are calling the shots and jacking up prices to astronomical levels.\nTake Aurielle Catron, a 29-year-old security engineer who braved the NYC jungle in search of a two-bedroom in Bushwick. After a brutal month-long search and 52 viewings, Catron landed a rent-stabilized fourth-floor walk-up for $3,200 a month.\nIt wasn’t her dream pad — it’s missing a laundry room and elevator — but after losing a bidding war that saw a $2,800 unit shoot up to $3,600, she was just relieved to have a place to call home.\nBidding wars for rentals are now common in the Big Apple, with landlords using aggressive tactics to maximize profits. Christopher Sadowski “People are willing to say, ‘Hey, if you give me this apartment, I’ll pay like $200, $500, $600 over asking for rent,’” she told Bloomberg , which reported on today’s general rental scramble. “I can’t compete with that.”\nBut it’s not just about losing bids. For Amber Melhouse, 49, the stakes were even higher. Forced out of her Brooklyn pad when the landlord hiked the rent by $1,350 a month — too much for her to handle after a divorce — Melhouse’s search for a smaller place turned into a horror show.\nI discovered trendy, affordable fashion through Armoire’s rental service\nAt one studio viewing, she showed up half an hour early, only to find a line of four people ahead of her and a swarm forming behind her. The place was snatched up before she even had a chance to apply. Now she’s crashing with friends, considering giving up her small pet-care business, and wondering if she’ll have to leave New York altogether.\n“I feel like this whole apartment-hunt experience has been a test of whether I’m meant to stay in New York. Like, is this New York’s way of kicking me out?” Melhouse told the outlet. “I don’t want to leave because my whole life is here.”\nRenters like Aurielle Catron and Matthew Braganza are struggling to find apartments, often having to compromise on location and amenities, or putting together extensive personal profiles just to be considered. Christopher Sadowski This savage rental market isn’t just a collection of horror stories — it’s the grim reality for thousands of New Yorkers this summer. Bidding wars, outrageous rents and lines of desperate apartment hunters snaking around the block are the new normal. It already has been for several years.\nAccording to Jonathan Miller, president of appraisal firm Miller Samuel, the tables turned in favor of landlords right after the pandemic.\n“Landlords resumed control and landlords could dictate terms that were more and more favorable for them,” he said.\nIn fact, some of these tactics are straight-up dirty tricks. Real estate agents are stoking bidding wars by underpricing apartments, pulling in hordes of hopefuls to open houses and then picking the highest bidder or the tenant with the best financials.\nAmerica’s top 10 rental markets: Jobs, affordable homes, and more\n“There’s too many TikTok brokers now that are trying to do things to go viral,” Douglas Elliman agent Keyan Sanai told Bloomberg. “At the end of the day, we’re in the business of sales. But 80% of the rental market competition is real.”\nLong lines and bidding wars have been hallmarks of the New York rental market since the days following COVID. Bloomberg via Getty Images This summer, with recent grads flooding the market and mortgage rates so high that even the thought of homeownership is off the table, renters are in a pressure cooker.\nFor some, like Cornell grad Matthew Braganza, the search for a pad became more grueling than the hunt for a job.\nDespite landing a solid accounting gig, Braganza had to jump through hoops — like providing personal references, his LinkedIn profile and a cover letter — just to stand out from the pack. After seeing nearly 100 apartments, he gave up on living solo and is now sharing a Lower East Side place with three roommates.\n“I had a harder time finding an apartment than I did finding a job,” Braganza said. “It felt like I was competing with a million people.”\nBidding wars are at an all-time high, with 24% of new Manhattan leases and 28.2% of Brooklyn deals turning into fierce battles for the highest bid. Helayne Seidman CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR MORNING REPORT NEWSLETTER\nAgents like Compass’s Thomas Hollingsworth are taking full advantage of the desperation. For applicants with thin rental histories or limited income, he’s demanding college transcripts.\n“If you were an A student, we are much more likely to trust that you will be successful in your job and able to pay your rent,” Hollingsworth said. “If you were a dropout or got all Ds, we’re going to be much more cautious.”\nAnd don’t think for a second that the bidding wars are entirely organic. Some brokers are playing dirty, holding back-to-back open houses and booking appointments just minutes apart, creating a frenzy that drives rents even higher.\nColdwell Banker Warburg’s Bill Kowalczuk admitted that these tactics almost always push offers above the asking price. It’s the kind of strategy that’s making New York’s “Wild West” market more chaotic than ever.\nAccording to Jonathan Miller, president of Miller Samuel, landlords have regained control and are now dictating terms that heavily favor them. Getty Images The rent madness hit new heights in June when bidding wars exploded in Manhattan and Brooklyn, with nearly a quarter of new leases in both boroughs caught up in the frenzy.\nHollingsworth himself put up a “basic” $2,000 fourth-floor walk-up studio in central Manhattan on Second Avenue that brought in 100 people and 20 applicants, eventually leasing to someone who offered $2,075 and was “generally pleasant” to work with.\nAn applicant who bid just $25 more but proved difficult to deal with was passed over, sparing the landlord from a potentially troublesome tenant, Hollingsworth said.\nFor top headlines, breaking news and more, visit nypost.com.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "title": "Vietnam: Dien Bien Phu fête ses 70 ans, avec la France comme invitée : Actualités - Orange",
    "text": "Coups de canon, discours et soldats: le Vietnam a célébré mardi le 70e anniversaire de la victoire de Dien Bien Phu contre les troupes françaises, sous le signe de la réconciliation avec l'ancienne puissance coloniale. La cérémonie de près de deux heures, débutée sous la pluie, a rassemblé environ 12.000 personnes, dans un stade où des banderoles géantes exaltaient le triomphe du 7 mai 1954 qui a conduit à l'indépendance du pays. \"Cela me donne de l'émotion de me souvenir des personnes qui sont mortes pour accomplir cette victoire qui a secoué la planète\", a déclaré Pham Duc Cu, 90 ans, un des derniers anciens combattants vietnamiens de Dien Bien Phu, dans un discours. Le défilé regroupant soldats, pompiers, et autres composantes de la société louées par le parti communiste -- employés, intellectuels, agriculteurs, femmes, minorités ethniques, etc. -- s'est prolongé dans les rues de la ville, où les habitants et les touristes ont agité le drapeau national à leur passage. \"Je suis là depuis 4 heures du matin. C'est un grand jour que je ne pouvais manquer\", a lancé Nguyen Thi Lan, une résidente de 55 ans, au milieu d'une foule colorée, où des membres des ethnies locales thaï et hmong se détachent en portant leurs tissus traditionnels. Organisée tous les deux ans, la démonstration de force, avec hélicoptères et obusiers en soutien, a accueilli pour la première fois des membres du gouvernement français, accompagnés par trois anciens combattants tricolores. La présence du ministre des Armées Sébastien Lecornu et de la secrétaire d'Etat chargée des Anciens combattants et de la Mémoire Patricia Mirallès, a témoigné de la réconciliation à l'oeuvre, sur fond d'intérêts stratégiques en commun. Les relations entre les deux pays autrefois en guerre sont aujourd'hui cordiales, en dépit des atteintes aux droits humains dont est régulièrement accusé le régime communiste. - 13.000 morts ou disparus - La bataille de Dien Bien Phu, qui a scellé une quasi siècle de domination française en Indochine, représente \"la victoire pour la justice\", a déclaré le Premier ministre vietnamien Pham Minh Chinh lors du discours de lancement de la cérémonie. \"Beaucoup de martyrs n'ont pas pu être identifiés. Le sang, qui a été versé dans le Nord-Ouest, a coulé pour le bonheur que nous avons aujourd'hui, a poursuivi le dirigeant. A une dizaine de kilomètres du Laos à vol d'oiseau, le site est cerné par les montagnes, dans une \"cuvette\" à jamais synonyme de triomphe pour les héros communistes Ho Chi Minh et Vo Nguyen Giap -- et d'humiliation militaire pour les Français. La chute du camp retranché, le 7 mai 1954, a mis fin à 56 jours de déluges d'obus et d'affrontements au corps à corps, qui ont fait 13.000 morts ou disparus, dont 10.000 du côté vietnamien. Le corps expéditionnaire français, fort de quelque 15.000 hommes de nombreuses nationalités, avait sous-estimé la puissance de feu de ses ennemis, nourrie par l'installation, sur les collines surplombant le camp retranché, de canons transportés en pièces détachées sur des centaines de kilomètres dans la jungle, parfois à vélo. \"Les blessures et les morts étaient normaux sur le champ de bataille, il n'y avait pas à avoir peur. Nous nous battions pour notre indépendance et notre liberté\", se rappelle un ancien combattant vietnamien, Hoang Van Bay, 93 ans, qui a creusé des kilomètres de tranchées sur le champ de bataille. Dien Bien Phu a débouché sur les accords de Genève, le 21 juillet 1954, qui ont acté la fin d'un quasi siècle de domination française en Indochine, ainsi que la partition du Vietnam, prélude à l'engagement américain à venir. - Equilibre diplomatique - Des sites commémoratifs de la bataille ont récemment été rénovés, dans un contexte de promotion touristique de la région souhaitée par les autorités locales. Au musée de la Victoire, des dizaines de visiteurs se bousculent pour admirer la fresque peinte retraçant le film de la bataille, où des tanks avancent sur des tas de cadavres. L'évolution des lieux témoigne de l'ouverture du Vietnam, à la suite de grandes politiques de libéralisation économique initiées dans les années 1980. \"Il y avait une sorte de rétention côté vietnamien, car le 7 mai est sacré pour eux. Il y a 20 ans, c'était beaucoup plus discret. D'une histoire très nationaliste, on voit plus d'ouverture aujourd'hui\", estime Pierre Journoud, professeur d'histoire contemporaine à l'université Paul Valery-Montpellier. \"L'aspect politique n'est pas innocent non plus\", poursuit-il, Hanoï étant à la recherche d'alliés qui puissent l'aider à maintenir son équilibre diplomatique entre Pékin et Washington, auquel il est attaché. publié le 7 mai à 06h02, AFP",

    "text": "Recientemente se hizo tendencia crear imágenes estilo Ghibli con ayuda de ChatGPT, la inteligencia artificial de OpenAI. Ahora, te enseñaremos cómo crear una figura estilo Funko Pop con tu cara y nombre.\nPara ello, necesitarás usar ChatGPT. Es muy importante que antes tengas una cuenta en el chatbot de IA, no importa sino pagas alguna versión, solo basta con estar registrado para lograrlo.\nUna vez que tengas tu registro, podrás continuar con los pasos que te presentamos a continuación.\nLeer también: Nintendo Switch 2: costo y cuándo saldrá a la venta\nPaso a paso para crear una imagen estilo Funko Pop con tu cara en ChatGPT\nPara lograr colocar tu rostro en una imagen estilo Funko Pop existen dos formas. La primera consiste en crear un prompt donde brindes detalles específicos de ti mismo para que la inteligencia artificial te brinde los resultados que esperas.\nPor ejemplo, en Tech Bit utilizamos el siguiente prompt: \"Crea una imagen estilo Funko Pop en la que aparezca una mujer mexicana llamada \"Paloma\" y el número 1998. La muñeca debe tener cabello largo y rizado con fleco. Su cabello es de color café. Viste un vestido azul y usa lentes. Debe contar con accesorios de una periodista como una libreta, un micrófono, una cámara y una grabadora\".\nEl resultado fue el siguiente:\nTambién puedes hacerlo con otras personas o celebridades, solo que tu prompt debe ser lo más descriptivo posible para que te brinde el resultado esperado.\nOtra de las versiones de prompt que hicimos fue: \"Crea una imagen estilo Funko Pop en la que aparezca el piloto británico de Fórmula 1 Lewis Hamilton y el número 44. El muñeco debe vestir el nómex de Ferrari y debe contar con accesorios como su bulldog de mascota\".\nY este fue el resultado:\nPor otro lado, la segunda forma de crear una imagen estilo Funko Pop con tu cara en ChatGPT es mediante una imagen de tu rostro.\nEn este caso, utilizamos una imagen de un idol coreano al que le agregamos el siguiente prompt: \"Dibuja una figura de Funko Pop en la que aparezca un hombre llamado \"YOONGI\" y el número 1992 en la caja a a partir de esta imagen\". El resultado fue:\nAl crear este tipo de imágenes, debes saber que solo debe hacerse para uso personal, educativo o artístico y no intentar vender o lucrar con las imágenes que imiten propiedades protegidas por derechos de autor.\nPor otro lado, si vas a compartirla a través de redes sociales, debes reconocer que fueron generadas por IA.\nLeer también: ¿Qué carrera estudió Steve Jobs para crear Apple?\nRecibe todos los viernes Hello Weekend, nuestro newsletter con lo último en gastronomía, viajes, tecnología, autos, moda y belleza.
