    "text": "Author Jim Herrick, a retired 25-year veteran of the U.S. Border Patrol and esteemed editor Jim DeBellis, brings forth a gripping narrative in “ War on the Rio Grande: Laredo Under Fire .” This novel delves into the intense world of border security, offering a riveting exploration of the personal toll endured by those who safeguard our borders.\nIn this captivating work, Herrick draws on his extensive real-world experience, crafting a story that transcends the traditional boundaries of the genre. Readers will be transported into the life of veteran Border Patrol Agent Kelly Smith, a character navigating not only the complexities of border security but also the profound emotions of love, loss, and sacrifice.\nThe narrative unfolds against the backdrop of a glorious and militarized plan to breach the U.S./Mexican border—a threat unlike any seen before. As Kelly Smith confronts this challenge alongside his partner and best friend, Ruben Garcia, and the new love of his life, Cristina Chavez, the trio becomes embroiled in a web of power, corruption, and a ruthless foe. Herrick’s storytelling beautifully weaves action, suspense, romance, and humour, offering readers a unique perspective from a real-life Border Agent who has witnessed the harsh realities of the frontlines.\nHerrick, known for his deep insights into border and security operations, brilliantly captures the potential flashpoints of a disturbing reality should the situation at the U.S./Mexico border remain unchecked. The novel not only entertains but also serves as a thought-provoking exploration of the challenges faced by those who dedicate their lives to protecting our borders.\n“ War on the Rio Grande: Laredo Under Fire ” goes beyond the action-packed narrative, addressing themes of love and loss on the frontlines, shedding light on the personal toll borne by individuals committed to border security. The novel is a testament to Herrick’s creative imagination, offering an insider’s peek into events that feel all too real.\nReaders are invited to immerse themselves in this compelling narrative, experiencing the highs and lows of a life dedicated to securing our borders. “ War on the Rio Grande: Laredo Under Fire ” is now available for purchase at major retailers and online platforms.\nAbout the Author\nJim Herrick is a retired 25-year veteran of the U.S. Border Patrol. He recently completed a tour in Afghanistan as a contractor for the Department of State/CBP as a mentor to Afghan Border and Customs Police advising on border security operations. He has a “Secret” security clearance and has been actively involved in a broad spectrum of border and security operations including anti-terrorism, tracking and surveillance, weapons and canine handling, and the investigation and apprehension of aliens and contraband that enter the U.S. illegally. Jim’s acquired knowledge and experience give him keen insights into the possible scenarios that can occur when you put powerful, callous, and violent drug cartels together with corrupt foreign military powers and governments, a permissive, and ineffectual Mexican buffer, and a weak U.S. border. His creative imagination gives us an insider’s peek into major events that are just waiting to happen, often based on real people and events that have “almost” happened. Still active as a border and security consultant, Jim now lives in New Mexico with his family.\nBook Name: War On The Rio Grande\nAuthor Name: James Herrick\nISBN Number: 0996395210\nEbook Version: Click Here\nPaperback Version: Click Here\nMedia Contact\nCompany Name: Amazon Publishing Company\nEmail: Send Email\nPhone: +1-877-311-2129\nCountry: United States\nWebsite: https://amzpublishingcompany.com/\nData & News supplied by www.cloudquote.io\nStock quotes supplied by Barchart\nQuotes delayed at least 20 minutes.\nBy accessing this page, you agree to the following\nPrivacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .",

    "text": "Pope Francis has looked well as he washed and kissed the feet of 12 women prisoners in a traditional ritual on the first of four event-filled days leading to Easter for the 87-year-old pontiff.\nFrancis travelled to Rome's Rebibbia prison, in a run-down area on Rome's outskirts, to preside at a Holy Thursday Mass for dozens of inmates, guards, chaplains and officials gathered in an outdoor area of the female section.\nFrom his wheelchair, he washed and kissed the right foot of 12 women sitting on a riser in a ritual commemorating Jesus' gesture of humility to his apostles at the Last Supper on the night before he was crucified.\nA number of the inmates were foreigners and some cried as he performed the ritual.\nThe female section of the prison, one of Italy's largest, holds about 370 inmates.\nFrancis is the first pope to hold the foot-washing ceremony outside churches, usually in prisons, homes for the elderly or hospices, continuing a practice he began when he was archbishop of Buenos Aires.\nHe is also the first pope to include women, atheists, Muslims and other non-Christians in the service.\nPrevious pontiffs held the service in St Peter's Basilica in the Vatican or the Basilica of St John in Lateran and included only men, usually priests.\nFrancis wove his short, improvised homily around the theme of service to others.\n\"Each of you has their own story but the Lord listens to us with open arms and never tires of forgiving,\" he said.\nFrancis, who recently curtailed his speaking engagements because of fatigue related to bouts of bronchitis and influenza, seemed fit.\nFrancis also looked well and strong earlier on Thursday at a Mass in St Peter's Basilica, where he read a long homily and improvised part of it.\nOn Good Friday, the day Christians commemorate Jesus' crucifixion, Francis is due to preside at a \"Passion of the Lord\" service in St Peter's Basilica and then attend a traditional evening Via Crucis (Way of the Cross) procession at Rome's Colosseum.\nHe will preside at an Easter Vigil service on Saturday, and on Sunday will read his twice-annual \"Urbi et Orbi\" (to the city and world) message and blessing from the central balcony of St Peter's to tens of thousands of people in the square below.\n ",

Seeking his 11th Australian Open victory and a record 25th Grand Slam title, Djokovic is set to commence his campaign against Croatian qualifier Dino Prizmic.\nUnfazed by Recent Setbacks\nFacing a recent wrist injury during the United Cup, which necessitated treatment during a loss to Alex de Minaur, the Serbian champion has been practicing without pain and exudes optimism about his performance in the forthcoming matches. Djokovic’s potential to overcome adversity is not new; he has previously managed more severe problems in his last two triumphant campaigns.\nAn Unbroken Streak\nDjokovic, who has not experienced defeat at the Australian Open since 2018, and has emerged victorious in every final he has contested at Melbourne Park, is on a 28-match winning streak. His powerful determination to win every Grand Slam he participates in is reflected in his unassailable record.\nBeyond the Court\nOff the court, Djokovic has a unique ritual of spending time in Melbourne’s Botanical Gardens, where he enjoys grounding himself by hugging and climbing trees. This personal practice reveals the human side of this towering tennis figure, illustrating the mental strategies he uses to stay focused and composed.\nLooking at the Record Books\nFinishing the previous year as world number one, Djokovic bagged three of the four major titles. His current aim is to surpass Margaret Court’s all-time Grand Slam record by securing his 25th major title. Given his current form, this feat is well within his grasp.\nTournament Changes and Notable Participants\nThe Australian Open has extended to a 15-day event to prevent late-night finishes, a change that has found favor among other players like Andy Murray. The tournament will also feature notable participants such as Stefanos Tsitsipas, Carlos Alcaraz, and Daniil Medvedev, promising a high level of competition.\nComments\nSubscribe to BNN Breaking\nSign up for our daily newsletter covering global breaking news around the world.",
