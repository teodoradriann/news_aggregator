    "text": "A Melbourne taxi driver who has driven cabs for more than three decades has been praised for his honesty after returning a large stash of cash found left behind in his vehicle. Charanjit Singh Atwal recently found a wallet and $8,000 in cash scattered across the backseat of his taxi. Instead of pocketing the cash for himself, the Sikh driver immediately handed it into police so the rightful owner could be tracked down. The honest cabbie said it never crossed his mind to keep the money. Astonishingly, the rightful owner was reunited with his cash. Mr Singh Atwal did not ask for a reward from the grateful owner. Charanjit Singh Atwal recently found $8,000 on the backseat of his taxi 'No, no. I don't need it. Never, ever,' the 13cabs driver told Nine News . He told the Herald Sun: 'I remember the passenger who lost it was in a hurry; he was very lucky as I had many passengers after him.' 'Needless to say, he was very grateful.' Aussies were quick to praise the cab driver after his story was posted online and went viral. 'A good and honest man. This speaks volumes about his character. May he be blessed abundantly,' one wrote. 'He is blessed, and his honesty and good deed will be returned to him tenfold,' one said. 'Yup! Great morals, great ethics ! Respect,' another wrote. Others were disapppointed to learn that the owner of the cash didn't give Mr Singh Atwal a reward. 'No reward? What an a",

    "text": "Gosh, Matt Yglesias seems upset that a bunch of people cheering on terrorists didn't keep their so-called word to Kamala Harris. We hate to break it to him but there's a reason they protest in favor of the horrible monsters of Hamas and it's NOT because they're good people who do what they say they'll do. Seriously, he can't be surprised the very people who tormented Jewish students on campuses across the country aren't more grateful to Kamala Harris for picking the not-Jewish guy, right? Dude, they cheer for TERRORISTS. Think about that for JUST a minute. This is not per se a knock on Tim Walz but it’s striking that the pro-Palestine movement could not stick to the the terms of the “give us Tim Walz or we will dedicate 100% of our effort to electing Trump even though we concede he is worse on our key issue” deal for one day.— Matthew Yglesias (@mattyglesias) [August 8, 2024] When you give horrible people an inch they'll take a mile. And even then that mile won't be enough. Yglesias continues: The ask never made any sense because Walz, Harris, Shapiro, and Biden all have similar views on Israel but it is in fact an ask that was made only for the people who made it to immediately confirm that there’s no sense in trying to bargain with them.— Matthew Yglesias (@mattyglesias) [August 8, 2024] No kidding.

    "title": "Federal food program 'fantastic' but students need more: advocate",
    "text": "The federal government's new national school food program is a great first step toward meeting the nutritional needs of Toronto's children but is not enough to solve student hunger, a local advocate for student nutrition says. On Monday, the federal government announced plans to launch a $1 billion national food program, hoping to deliver meals to 400,000 students annually by the 2024-2025 school year. \"It's a fantastic start, but there's more work to be done,\" said Catherine Parsonage, CEO of the Toronto Foundation for Student Success. The non-profit organization provides student nutrition programs to English, Catholic and French school boards citywide. Parsonage says they feed meals to roughly 240,000 students across Toronto, with that number having grown by 14,000 children so far this year. She says the city's student nutrition programs are in a dire state as they navigate higher food costs, shrinking quantities and increased student need. \"It's heartbreaking when programs cannot nourish the children the way they need it to, when all they can offer is maybe two carrot sticks and a cracker,\" she said. Catherine Parsonage, CEO of the Toronto Foundation for Student Success, said the planned national school food program, announced Monday, is a fantastic start but cannot alone meet student need. (Laura Pedersen/CBC) While Parsonage said she celebrated after the federal announcement, she says the planned national program will not meet student demand alone. Municipal and provincial support, as well as support from donors, parents and corporate partners, will be needed to adequately sustain student nutrition programs, she said. Though the government has said its planning for the program to start operating during the 2024-25 school year, Parsonage says she hopes it can be enacted in time for the next school year, starting this September. \"Let's go fast,\" she said. \"Kids can't wait.\" 'We're very lucky to have this': teacher On Wednesday, at St. John XXIII Catholic School in North York, all 470 elementary students were given a cantaloupe slice, breadstick and yogurt tube for their daily morning breakfast break. Baheya Kass-Barsoum has been a volunteer food coordinator at the school since 2012. She arrives at 8 a.m. to prepare the snacks. She portions them into bins to go to each classroom with the help of volunteers like Grade 8 student Sean Mendoza, who has been volunteering with the school's nutrition program for nearly a year, since last May. The program aims to provide whole grain foods, as well as dairy and fresh fruit and vegetables. Teacher Laura Cross said St. John XXIII Catholic School is 'very lucky' to have a school food program, noting the difference in students' learning, attitude and tiredness after they eat breakfast. (Laura Pedersen/CBC) Mendoza stacks the snack bins on a rolling cart that he takes around the school, often carrying four or five bins at a time to deliver to classrooms upstairs. Teacher Laura Cross says the nutrition program is a \"privilege\" for the school. \"The difference when kids have breakfast in the morning [versus] when they don't is evident in their learning, in their attitude, in their tiredness,\" she said. \"We're very lucky to have this here.\" Grade 5 student Nico Pineda said he's grateful for his school's food program, as when he is hungry, he can't focus on his work. (Laura Pedersen/CBC) The morning breakfast break is also a moment for students in a Grade 5 classroom to socialise. Student Ben Alcala said the school nutrition program is fantastic and \"could help a lot of students in need.\" \"Sometimes I'm really late and I don't get to eat a lot,\" said Santiago Cogollo, another student. \"And then I come here and I'm not hungry anymore, because I have the snack.\" Student Nico Pineda says he's grateful for the program. \"If I don't have breakfast, I'll be very hungry and I can't focus on my work,\" he said. As the program's longtime coordinator, Kass-Barsoum, who moved to Toronto from Syria in 2010, says she enjoys contributing positively to her community through her volunteer position. \"When you see the smile of the kids… that's my pleasure,\" she said.",

    "text": "Le gouvernement fédéral du Canada est intervenu jeudi pour empêcher une grève des techniciens de maintenance de WestJet Airlines, le deuxième plus grand transporteur du pays, afin d'éviter d'autres annulations de vols à l'approche d'un week-end de vacances chargé. Le ministre du travail, Seamus O'Regan, a déclaré qu'il avait ordonné au conseil des relations industrielles du pays d'imposer un arbitrage définitif et contraignant dans le conflit entre la compagnie aérienne et l'Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association (Association fraternelle des mécaniciens d'aéronefs).\n\"Les parties restent très éloignées aujourd'hui et les tensions n'ont fait qu'augmenter\", a-t-il déclaré dans un communiqué.\nLe syndicat a déclaré qu'il n'y avait pas de précédent moderne à cette mesure, ajoutant qu'il se conformerait à l'ordre et demanderait à ses membres de s'abstenir de toute action illégale sur le marché du travail.\nWestJet a déclaré mercredi qu'elle avait commencé à annuler des vols en prévision de la grève, qui aurait pu commencer vendredi. Lundi, c'est la fête du Canada, l'un des jours fériés les plus importants du pays.\nWestJet, qui est soutenue par Onex Corp et qui est en concurrence avec Air Canada, a été confrontée à des demandes de la part de ses employés pour de meilleures conditions de travail et des salaires plus élevés.

    "text": "The European Commission applauds the Council’s unanimous decision to welcome Bulgaria and Romania into the Schengen area, commencing with the elimination of controls at air and sea borders from March 2024. This milestone will bolster travel, trade, and tourism, fortifying the internal market. Discussions about lifting controls at land borders will proceed in 2024. The expanded Schengen zone is seen as a strength for the EU, both domestically and globally. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen hailed this as a historic moment, emphasising the freedom for Bulgarian and Romanian citizens to traverse internal sea and air borders without controls starting in March. The Commission confirmed Bulgaria and Romania’s readiness for Schengen in 2011 and reaffirmed this through assessments in 2022 and 2023. Pilot projects commenced in 2023 to enhance external border management and cooperation with neighbouring countries. The Schengen area, backed by enhanced security measures, a new governance model, and evaluation mechanisms, has evolved to receive Bulgaria and Romania. This enlargement reflects the trust and unity among Member States that underpin Schengen’s foundation and promises reinforced external border protection, streamlined business and personal interactions, and an expanded common area without internal border checks. Further deliberations regarding lifting internal land border checks will continue in 2024, with an expected Council decision within a reasonable timeframe. Substantial financial support and Frontex assistance will aid Bulgaria and Romania in safeguarding the Union’s external borders, while successful pilot projects at these borders are slated for more permanent arrangements. The Schengen area, initiated by five Member States in 1985, has grown over seven stages to encompass 27 countries and 4 million square kilometres. With Bulgaria and Romania, this area will expand to 4.5 million square kilometres and a population of 450 million. Schengen’s integration into the EU’s legal framework mandates all ready EU Member States to become full members, making Bulgaria and Romania’s accession a strengthening factor. Fact-finding missions reaffirmed their readiness for Schengen membership.",

    "text": "FORKS (WGME)--- A logging truck veered off-road and into Martin Pond leaving the driver dead. Authorities believe white-out conditions and inclement weather to be the cause of the incident. Somerset County Sheriff’s Office alleges that 35-year-old Alexander Drolet of Quebec was driving a tractor-trailer truck southbound, hauling tree-length logs in the early morning hours on Thursday. Around 4 a.m. on Route 201 in the town of Forks, Drolet’s tractor-trailer drove off the road and into Martin Pond. Sheriff’s deputies believe Drolet was alone in the vehicle at the time of the accident. The tractor-trailer was removed several hours later Thursday afternoon. Drolet’s body was located on Friday around 1 p.m. by the Maine State Police dive team and Wardens from the Maine Warden Service recovered Drolet’s body from the pond. The incident is still under investigation, though inclement weather and white-out conditions appear to have contributed to the crash. An autopsy will determine Drolet’s cause of death in the coming days.",
