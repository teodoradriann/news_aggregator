    "title": "Former ICU nurse is arrested on suspicion of replacing fentanyl with tap water",
    "text": "A former intensive care unit nurse has been arrested for allegedly swapping patients' pain medication with tap water, police in Medford, Oregon, announced Thursday. Dani Mari Schofield faces 44 counts of assault in the second degree, charges that \"reflect the total amount of patients that this investigation revealed to have been affected by Schofield’s criminal actions,\" the Medford Police Department said in a statement. Assault in the second-degree charges are filed when an individual \"intentionally or knowingly causes serious physical injury to another,\" the statement said. The arrest comes nearly seven months after officials at Asante Rogue Regional Medical Center, a 378-bed hospital in Medford, contacted police with concerns about a growing number of central line infections among patients. Central lines are tubes put into large veins to administer medication. “There was concern that Schofield had been diverting patients’ liquid fentanyl for her personal use and then replacing it with tap water, causing serious infections,” Thursday's police statement said. Police did not say how many of the patients that Schofield allegedly mistreated had died. In March, a lawsuit was filed on behalf of the estate of Horace Wilson, an Asante patient who died after he was admitted to the hospital with a lacerated spleen and broken ribs following a fall off a ladder in January 2022. The lawsuit alleged that while hospitalized, Wilson's pain medication was replaced with nonsterile tap water, introducing bacteria into his bloodstream that led to his death. The lawsuit named both Asante and Schofield as defendants, accusing them of negligence. Neither responded to requests for comment at the time. The allegations of drug diversion — a term that refers to misappropriating prescribed medications, sometimes to abuse or illegally sell them — were first reported by NBC affiliate KOBI-TV in Medford in December 2023. The station said that at least one patient at Asante had died after a nurse allegedly diverted their pain medication. An attorney for Schofield, who police said left Asante in July 2023, did not immediately respond to a voicemail seeking comment. Records from the Oregon State Board of Nursing show that Schofield voluntarily agreed in November 2023 to a nursing license suspension, \"pending completion of an investigation.” In an internal memo sent Thursday to Asante employees after police announced Schofield's arrest, president and CEO Tom Gessel thanked law enforcement for its \"tireless work since our team brought concerns forward to them.\" \"We are greatly appreciative of the countless hours their investigators have spent on this complex matter,\" he wrote.",

According to experts, they are less likely to show up as far south as they did Thursday night, but again, they are hard to predict far in advance.",

    "text": "3rd most capped player in OM history and captain of the Minots, François Bracci has died\nIt is a monument to the Olympique de Marseille which has bowed out: François Bracchi has experienced everything in the blue and white jersey, from the title of champion of\nFrance in 1972 to the Minots epic in the mid-1980s. left side died at the age of 72.\n342 matches played in the OM jersey: only Roger Scotti (452) and Steve Mandanda (613) have managed to do better than François Bracci and it is not an empty word to write that it is an authentic legend of the Marseille club who disappears following a long illness.\nThe left back born in Alsace was passionate about OM and he made his dream come true by wearing the blue and white jersey. Although he also played in Strasbourg, Bordeaux, Rouen and Béziers, it was with “his” club (1971-1979 then 1983-1985) that he marked his era. An\ninternational (18 caps), he played in the 1978 World Cup in Argentina, the crowning achievement of a career where he experienced everything with OM.\nChampion of\nFrance in 1972, winner of the Coupe de France in 1976, he experienced the club’s last successes before a decade-long eclipse, but if one day Bernard Tapie set his sights on OM, it was also because that Bracci was the captain of the Minots team that brought the club back to Division 1 in 1984.\nHaving become a coach, he has competed in the Algerian and Moroccan championships over the last two decades. It was with Mouloudia Algiers that he won the Cup and the Super Cup in 2006 then the champion title in 2010.\n2023-12-28 21:09:30\n#3rd #capped #player #history #captain #Minots #François #Bracci #died #Flashscore.fr",

Ein Polizist kommt mit einer schweren Verletzung ins Krankenhaus.\nBerlin - Bei einer Festnahme hat ein Berliner Polizist einen doppelten Beinbruch erlitten. Am Mittwochabend waren Polizisten zu einem Einsatzort der Feuerwehr im Bezirk Marzahn-Hellersdorf gerufen worden, wie die Polizei mitteilte. Die Feuerwehr hatte um Unterstützung im Umgang mit einem 18-jährigen, psychisch auffälligen Mann gebeten.\nNach Eintreffen der Polizei kam es den Angaben nach zu einer körperlichen Auseinandersetzung, bei der der 18-jährige Mann sowie der 28-jährige Polizist beide schwer stürzten. Der Polizist habe einen Schienbein- und Wadenbeinbruch erlitten und sei schwer verletzt in ein Krankenhaus gebracht worden, sagte ein Sprecher der Polizei auf Anfrage. Der 18-Jährige wurde in dem Geschehen hingegen nur leicht verletzt.\nWie es zu dem Gerangel zwischen dem Mann und dem Beamten kam, ist bisher unklar.
