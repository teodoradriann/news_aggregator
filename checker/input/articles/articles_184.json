    "text": "Skilled volunteering: How agency workers can use their powers for good More organizations are building volunteering time into their contracts. Here, Media Bounty's Tommy Lee shares his volunteering experience with charity Men's Minds Matter. How can marketing workers put their skills to use for unequivocal good? / Rémi Walle via Unsplash Did you know that you’re more likely to reassess your life choices or do something big and crazy when your age ends in a 9? From questioning your career, to getting a tattoo… as you head into a new decade, you’re more likely to yearn for change. As someone firmly in their mid-to-late twenties (29 and a half), this hasn’t escaped my notice. For many, this manifests as asking if their job helps anyone. I look at the Arctic Monkeys tattoo that permanently marked my 19th birthday, and question everything. Helpfully, everyone at Media Bounty gets five days a year to volunteer for whatever cause they fancy. After last year’s [If You Think Something’s up, Bring it Up](https://mediabounty.com/portfolio/mens-minds-matter/) campaign, I put my time to use with [Men’s Minds Matter](https://mensmindsmatter.org/). I now sit on the board, with my role focusing on marketing and campaigns. [75% of all UK suicides are by men](https://www.thecalmzone.net/record-awareness-of-male-suicide-as-latest-stats-show-3-in-4-uk-suicides-are-men). And so many of society’s problems, like the rise in toxic masculinity and violence against women, can be linked back to men’s mental health issues. Men’s Minds Matter exists to help change this. It was started by two mates, Clinical Psychologist Luke and lived experience expert Nigel. They do truly live saving work. But this is an article about marketing. So I’m duty-bound to distil my discoveries on the volunteering journey into three learnings. Let’s have it. Advertisement 1. Everything in perspective While we’re busy making decks and staring at ourselves on Zoom, some people are out there saving lives. Rather than making my nine-to-five feel frivolous, I find it energizing. It reminds me I’m lucky to have a job where I’m having fun (almost) every day. But it also makes me feel grateful to be part of a company where I can use my skills for good. Which leads me to... 2. You’ve got the skills Don’t forget about ‘skilled volunteering’. It doesn’t have to be just about donating your time. There are loads of organisations, big and small, that are desperate for your skills, too. Whatever you do in your 9-5:30, it can be transferred to a charity. From finance, to design, to community management. And if you work for a B-Corp, you’re automatically entitled to five days a year of volunteering. Advertisement 3. Bubble bursting I apologize for being the billionth guy in big glasses to tell you to get out of your bubble. But it’s true. You learn so much, and see a whole new side to things you never knew existed. Both about the nitty-gritty elements of how charities exist from day to day, but also about the subject matter itself. I learned a lot spending an hour a week with a therapist (even if we’re just talking about fundraising). So, that tattoo from my 19th birthday was probably a mistake. But volunteering with Men’s Minds Matter wasn’t. It’s made my work life more enjoyable, more rewarding and more purposeful than ever. If you’re thinking about doing it – do it. To get involved with small charities and organizations, just email or send them a message on socials. Alternatively, there are places like [Patagonia Action Works](https://eu.patagonia.com/gb/en/actionworks/campaigns/find-community-path-and-purpose/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=&utm_content=576027408232&utm_term=_&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiA0syqBhBxEiwAeNx9N9u9yt2Qo5FI4Q6bjbMvinKfCVecwoP9MTwpeZrivUPBryPZETEVRxoCswcQAvD_BwE) that can connect you with a range of environmental causes that need skilled volunteers.

    "text": "At a Glance - Tropical forecasting used to rely on observations and measurements taken from inside the storm. - Satellites allow for continuous monitoring of potential and active tropical systems. - Tropical systems like Kirk and Leslie may not have been recorded at all without remote imaging like satellites. - Better monitoring allowed for improvements in tropical forecasting and tracking of active systems. [Sign up for the Morning Brief email newsletter](https://weather.com/newsletter?cm_ven=dnt_NLacquisition_inarticle) to get weekday updates from The Weather Channel and our meteorologists. Hurricane Kirk has an impressive size, with tropical storm-force winds extending over 200 miles from the storm’s center. Tropical storm Leslie is smaller, but still strong, just over 1,000 miles away from Hurricane Kirk. A hundred years ago, forecasters may not have known these storms even existed. The History Of Tropical Detection And Observation Prior to the development of satellites, hurricanes could only be monitored by direct observations. In the 1870s, Father Benito Vines, the director of the Meteorological Observatory of the Royal College of Belén in Cuba, established the first network of observation sites focusing on hurricane detection. The United States began establishing its own observing stations throughout the Caribbean during and after the Spanish-American War in the late 1890s. The problem with land-based observation stations is that a tropical system must have observable impacts to land in order to be detected. Real-time observations took to the sea starting in the early 1900s with the development and use of the wireless telegraph on ships, which alowed to relay information about weather conditions in the ocean directly to forecasters on land. Ships were able to relay information about weather conditions in the ocean directly to forecasters on land. The first recorded planned flight into a hurricane was in July 1943, “when two Army Air Corps pilots challenged each other to fly through a hurricane,” according to the U.S. Air Force 403rd Wing. (MORE: [80 Years Ago, Hurricane Hunting Began With A Bet](https://weather.com/storms/hurricane/news/2023-07-27-hurricane-hunting-anniversary-bet)) The flight was into a storm near Galveston and is regarded as the first mission of what we now know as the U.S. Air Force Hurricane Hunters. However, that flight was only conducted because people on land already knew there was a storm there. The first hurricane seen from space: It wasn’t until September 10, 1961, two months after the launch of the TIROS III satellite, that the first tropical system was initially detected by satellite without any direct, in-situ observations. The TIROS III satellite detected “an area of disturbed weather a hundred miles southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands,” explains NOAA’s Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory. One day later, the satellite and ships in the area detected circulation, and the storm was officially named Hurricane Esther on September 12 after a reconnaissance aircraft found hurricane-force winds. Six years later, Hurricane Camille, one of the strongest hurricanes to ever impact the mainland U.S., was under continuous surveillance by the Nimbus-3 satellite from its first detection on August 14, 1969, to landfall on August 17. Satellite imagery “was particularly valuable in tracking Camille across the tropical North Atlantic from Africa,” says a report on the storm by the Environmental Science Services Administration from September 1969. “It was a valuable tool in directing the aerial reconnaissance flights into the right areas and provided good estimates of Camille’s position at times of doubtful aerial fixes.” TIROS III and Nimbus-3, the satellites that monitored Hurricanes Esther and Camille from space, were both polar orbiting satellites; these satellites orbit earth around the poles, taking pictures of earth as the planet rotates beneath them and allowing for satellite imagery of the whole planet. Geostationary satellites were later introduced in 1975. Geostationary satellites are able to orbit the Earth at a speed allowing them to stay fixed over the same area of the planet and creating a continuous monitoring system for tropical development. Today, NOAA owns and operates five geostationary satellites, called Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES). There are a total of 23 geostationary satellites orbiting earth, so near-continuous satellite imagery is possible world-wide. It is through these satellites that the National Hurricane Center is watching Hurricane Kirk and Tropical Storm Leslie. Satellites: Tropical Forecaster’s Not-Secret Weapon Even though they are likely to be [fish storms](https://weather.com/storms/hurricane/video/breaking-down-the-phrase-a-fish-storm), Kirk and Leslie can still cause disruptions to shipping routes, and Kirk may cause life-threatening swells and currents for Bermuda and the Leeward Islands. Because we have satellite images of the storms, ships can adjust their routes to avoid dangerous conditions. Forecasts are also better thanks to satellites watching the tropics, especially with modern imaging technology that can make observations beyond just what the storm looks like. GOES satellites are able to measure a storm’s current conditions, like cloud height and convective activity, and then monitor how the storm is changing over time. Is it weakening? Is it strengthening? How fast? Forecasting is improved even more because satellites take detailed measurements of factors that can impact a storm’s development and track. Factors like water temperature, moisture and wind shear all play an important part in tropical forecasting, and satellites can provide the data without an endless network of observation stations throughout the ocean. For example, when Hurricane Kirk was first being watched as an interest area by the National Hurricane Center, this line was included in the discussion on the NHC website: “Environmental conditions are expected to be conducive for slow development thereafter while the system moves generally northwestward at 10 to 15 mph.” Many of those environmental conditions are measured via satellite, and communication satellites help relay information from [ocean buoys and fleets of robotic instruments capable of diving underwater](https://oceantoday.noaa.gov/satellites-sea/). An Early, And Accurate, Warning System Before satellites, not only were forecasts hampered by a lack of data - some storms were “missed” entirely, and forecasters and the public never knew there was a storm at all. Researchers have estimated that an [average of one tropical storm was missed per four years](https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/wp-content/uploads/files/user_files/gav/publications/vk_08_recount.pdf) before we entered the “satellite era.” The number of missed storms was worse for 1880 with an estimated 3.4 storms per year on average. Storms that do have impacts to land can also be reliably tracked much sooner than they would have been 100 years ago. The Great Galveston Hurricane of 1900 hit Galveston, Texas, with little to no prior warning and no knowledge that it was in the Gulf of Mexico. When Hurricane Camille made landfall in Louisiana in August of 1969, its exact location had been continuously tracked by satellite, allowing for more preparation and more lives saved.

    "text": "The world’s most popular classical composer has to be Johann Sebastian Bach. Tastes may diverge, but everyone from scholars to casual classical fans seems to agree that he’s the emotionally eloquent genius who made everything after him possible.\nReview: Bach goes big in Minnesota Orchestra’s rewarding program\nIsraeli mandolinist Avi Avital was soloist.\nMeanwhile, the Minnesota Orchestra is the state’s most popular presenter of classical music. Yet rarely will you find Bach on a Minnesota Orchestra program. That’s because the early-18th-century German wrote most of his music for smaller groups, often for a single instrumentalist.\nBut this week’s Minnesota Orchestra concerts are a celebration of Bach that goes from intimate to expansive. Nine works are on the program, seven of them by Bach and two inspired by his music. If it’s an authentic 1700s sound you seek, go catch a concert by Lyra Baroque or the Bach Society of Minnesota. In the orchestra’s performance, Bach’s music is seen through a 20th- and 21st-century lens, his music rearranged under the influence of romanticism and adventurous instrumentation.\nIt added up to something tremendously rewarding at Thursday’s midday concert at Minneapolis’ Orchestra Hall. Led with a balance of grace and gravitas by Canadian conductor Jordan de Souza, the concert blended respect for the composer and imaginative explorations of what he might have done with an orchestra of almost 100 musicians at his disposal.\nThat applies to the concert’s second half. The first was faithful to the sound of its time, save for one change: As far as we know, Bach never wrote a piece specifically for the mandolin. Israeli mandolinist Avi Avital has been performing and recording pieces the composer wrote for harpsichord and violin, with a concerto originally composed for each on this weekend’s program.\nIt proved a fine fit for the music, complemented by 22 string players from the Minnesota Orchestra and harpsichordist Dean Billmeyer. After opening the concert in the first balcony with a slice of a Bach violin partita, Avital took to the stage for a mandolin transcription of a concerto best known in its keyboard incarnation, the slow center movement proving captivating.\nAvital’s subsequent take on a version of the A Minor Violin Concerto was most memorable during the sprightly and spirited opening movement and the muscular rock-and-roll-esque strumming on the finale.\nThe concert’s first half focused on what happens when Bach’s music meets a mandolin. The second half was about what happens when it’s unleashed by a full orchestra. After a modernist collage by American composer Betsy Jolas (“Letters From Bachville”), three works originally written for organ were heard in the orchestrations of Edward Elgar, Leopold Stokowski and former Minnesota Orchestra music director Stanislaw Skrowaczewski.\nThe latter’s version of the popular Toccata and Fugue in D Minor helped open Orchestra Hall in 1974, and Thursday’s performance served as a reminder of what a masterful orchestrator the maestro was. Each collection of instruments did its best imitation of a set of organ pipes. The performance was as much of an adrenaline rush as Gustav Mahler’s arrangements of Bach orchestral suites were rapturously beautiful.\nMinnesota Orchestra\nWith: Conductor Jordan de Souza and mandolinist Avi Avital.\nWhat: Works by J.S. Bach, Betsy Jolas and Paul Hindemith.\nWhen: 8 p.m. Fri.\nWhere: Orchestra Hall, 1111 Nicollet Mall, Mpls.\nTickets: $36-$111, available at 612-371-5656 or [minnesotaorchestra.org](https://www.minnesotaorchestra.org/)\nClassical music writer Rob Hubbard can be reached at [wordhub@yahoo.com](mailto:wordhub@yahoo.com).\nIsraeli mandolinist Avi Avital was soloist.",

    "text": "The factory’s opening comes on the same day that the European Union is expected to begin imposing higher tariffs on EVs made in China due to concerns over competition from the cheaper-priced imports. In the U.S., the Biden administration also is raising tariffs on Chinese EVs to 100% from the current 25%. The U.S. currently imports very few Chinese cars, but like the European Commission, it worries that subsidies hurt domestic companies and cost jobs. The new factory in Rayong, south of Bangkok, was built in just 16 months and has an annual production capacity of 150,000 vehicles. It makes several BYD models and also batteries and transmissions. Its opening on Thursday was marked with great fanfare and included the presentation of a BYD Dolphin, a compact hatchback, to a charitable foundation under the patronage of the Thai royal family. That vehicle was the 8 millionth vehicle manufactured by BYD, the company said. Thailand aims to have 30% of all vehicles made in the country be electric by 2030. One in every three EVs sold in Thailand is made by BYD, though most cars on the roads now are still gas or diesel powered. BYD, which stands for\"Build Your Dreams,\" sold 3 million vehicles last year and its exports more than tripled to 243,000. In the first half of this year, the company sold 1.6 million EVs. It sold 30,650 EVs in Thailand last year and plans for its new factory to make the Dolphin, Atto 3, Seal and Sealion 6 EV models. BYD says the new factory is expected to create 10,000 jobs. Apart from Thailand and China, BYD also has or is building factories in Brazil, Hungary and Uzbekistan. According to BYD, the Dolphin can run 490 kilometers (about 300 miles) on a single charge. During a recent auto show in Bangkok, models on display were priced at 859,999 baht ($23,700), though reports said BYD would be offering steep discounts in Thailand on vehicles made in the new factory.",
