    "text": "GRTS | 9 minutes ago New York, New York--(Newsfile Corp. - June 13, 2024) - WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, announces the filing of a class action lawsuit on behalf of purchasers of securities of Gritstone bio, Inc. (NASDAQ: GRTS) between March 9, 2023 and February 29, 2024, both dates inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than August 6, 2024.\nSO WHAT: If you purchased Gritstone securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.\nWHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Gritstone class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=25945 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than August 6, 2024 . A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.\nWHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.\nDETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Gritstone would be unable to launch the Phase 2b CORAL Study, a study comparing Gritstone's COVID-19 vaccine candidate with an approved COVID-19 vaccine, in the timeframe it had represented to investors; (2) the foregoing would impair Gritstone's ability to obtain external funding in connection with the Phase 2b CORAL Study, thereby negatively affecting Gritstone's ability to maintain its balance sheet and cash position; (3) accordingly, Gritstone overstated its ability to successfully develop and commercialize its products; and (4) as a result, Gritstone's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\nTo join the Gritstone class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=25945 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.\nNo Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rosen-law-firm , on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rosen_firm or on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/rosenlawfirm/ .\nAttorney Advertising.

    "text": "Gold prices experienced a notable uptick on Monday, driven by ongoing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and growing anticipation that the US Federal Reserve will initiate interest rate cuts later in the year, bolstering the appeal of the precious metal among investors. Spot transactions saw gold prices rise by 0.3 percent to USD2,309 per ounce by 05:00 GMT, while US gold futures climbed 0.5 percent to reach USD2,318 per ounce.Kelvin Wong, Chief Market Analyst for the Asia-Pacific region at OANDA, highlighted investors' keen focus on developments in the Middle East and ceasefire negotiations. He noted that any setback in hopes for a truce would likely fuel further increases in gold prices, as investors seek refuge in the safe-haven asset amidst heightened geopolitical uncertainties.Yip Jun Rong, Market Performance Strategist at IG, underscored the impact of weak economic data in the United States on expectations of impending interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. This sentiment, he suggested, bolsters confidence in gold as a safe haven for investors seeking shelter from market volatility.Recent data indicating a slowdown in US job growth during April has strengthened expectations that the Federal Reserve will embark on a course of interest rate reductions later in the year. Notably, 67 percent of markets anticipate a rate cut in September, a move that would diminish the appeal of higher interest rates and further bolster gold's attractiveness as a safe-haven asset.John Williams, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, emphasized the importance of achieving the 2 percent inflation target for price stability, fueling hopes for the adoption of stimulus measures to support economic growth.In terms of other precious metals, silver saw a notable increase of 1.3 percent to USD26 per ounce, while platinum experienced a slight decline of 0.7 percent to USD948, and palladium edged up by 0.1 percent to USD946. These movements underscore the complex interplay of geopolitical factors and monetary policy expectations shaping the broader precious metals market.
