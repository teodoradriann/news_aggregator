El crimen tuvo lugar este jueves 25 de enero del 2024 a la altura del municipio de San Vicente Coatlán, correspondiente a la región de Valles Centrales. Autopista Oaxaca-Puerto Escondido registra su primer homicidio De acuerdo a los primeros reportes, un transportista de Ejutla de Crespo, identificado como Edy. V.R. circulaba sobre la carretera Barranca Larga-Ventanilla a bordo de su vehículo cuando fue acribillado a balazos, quedando su cuerpo a bordo del auto donde más tarde fue localizado. En este tramo de la autopista Oaxaca-Costa se movilizaron personal de la policía municipal de San Vicente Coatlán, quienes acordonaron la zona en la espera del personal de la Fiscalía General de Justicia del Estado de Oaxaca (FGEO) quienes iniciarán la carpeta de investigación por el homicidio, esclarecer el móvil del crimen y dar con el o los responsables del asesinato. Cabe mencionar que desde hace días el paso por la [autopista Oaxaca-Puerto Escondido](https://oaxaca.heraldodemexico.com.mx/local/2024/1/20/autopista-oaxaca-puerto-escondido-ahorrara-horas-de-viaje-la-costa-partir-del-de-febrero-16867.html) se encuentra cerrado por completo debido a que se está preparando para la inauguración y aún hay trabajos que faltan por concluirse. Además, fue en esta zona de Coatlán donde se mantuvo un conflicto agrario que provocó el cierre de las obras durante un tiempo. Esta disputa de hectáreas de tierra con Sola de Vega dejó al menos 40 muertos a lo largo de los años y fue hasta la intervención del presidente López Obrador que se logró llegar a un acuerdo. ¿Cuando se inaugura la autopista Oaxaca-Puerto Escondido? Hace unos días, el presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador anunció que el próximo domingo 4 de febrero del 2024 viajará a tierras oaxaqueñas para realizar la esperada inauguración de la [autopista Oaxaca-Puerto Escondido](https://oaxaca.heraldodemexico.com.mx/local/2024/1/12/por-fin-anuncian-dia-de-la-inauguracion-de-la-autopista-oaxaca-puerto-escondido-16781.html). La inauguración de la carretera conocida como Barranca Larga-Ventanilla estaba programada para diciembre del 2023, sin embargo, una serie de derrumbes en unos taludes hizo que la apertura fuera aplazada primero a enero y luego hasta el mes de febrero.

    "text": "George Takei releases children’s book about his childhood in WWII camp Actor and advocate George Takei has released a children’s book detailing his experience as a child in a World War II incarceration camp in Arkansas. Key points: - Released on April 16, the book, entitled “My Lost Freedom,” was published by Crown Books for Young Readers and illustrated by Michelle Lee. - In an Instagram post on release day, [Takei](/tag/george-takei), 86, said “My Lost Freedom” is a true story based on his childhood experience during [WWII](/tag/world-war-II). He wrote, “I looked back at my own memories to help children today understand what it feels like to be treated as an enemy by your own country. This is a story of my family’s courage and the importance of staying true to yourself in the face of injustice.” The details: - The books tells the story of how Takei’s family, including his siblings and parents, were forcibly relocated from their [Los Angeles](/tag/los-angeles)home to a camp at Santa Anita racetrack in [California](/tag/california)shortly after the bombing of [Pearl Harbor](/tag/pearl-harbor). This event took place when Takei was 4 years old. - Afterward, they were permanently relocated to a camp in Rohwer, Arkansas, where they spent the entirety of the war under surveillance by the U.S. government. - Takei wrote that even as American citizens, “America saw us as the enemy simply because we looked like the people who did the bombing.” - After the war, Takei recalled how the government released people from the camp and provided them with $25 and a “one-way ticket to anywhere in the United States,” which the family used to go back to Los Angeles and start over. - The McGehee Japanese American Internment Museum, which celebrated its 10th anniversary last year with an event attended by Takei as a special guest, [noted that](https://www.thv11.com/article/entertainment/events/wwii-japanese-american-internment-museum-10-year-anniversary/91-043e1fcd-842e-494e-9c83-903605027586)around 17,000 Japanese Americans [were relocated](https://www.kark.com/news/state-news/actor-george-takei-releases-childrens-book-about-time-in-arkansas-internment-camp-during-wwii/)to two incarceration camps in Rohwer and Jerome, Arkansas, during the war.

    "title": "Türkiye Foot-and-Mouth: Livestock Markets Closed - China News",
    "text": "Turkey Halts Livestock Trading to Combat Foot-and-Mouth Disease Spread Ankara has implemented nationwide restrictions on livestock markets and movements in response to a growing outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), a highly contagious viral disease affecting cloven-hoofed animals. The move aims to contain the spread and protect the country’s agricultural sector.\nThe decision, announced earlier this week, impacts the trade of cattle, sheep, and goats across Turkey. Authorities are urging farmers to adhere strictly to biosecurity measures and report any suspected cases immediately. The outbreak poses a significant threat to Turkey’s livestock industry and potentially to international trade.\nUnderstanding Foot-and-Mouth Disease Foot-and-mouth disease isn’t a threat to humans, but it’s devastating to livestock. Characterized by fever followed by blisters on the tongue, mouth, and feet, FMD can cause significant economic losses for farmers due to reduced milk production, weight loss, and even animal mortality. The virus spreads rapidly through direct contact with infected animals, contaminated feed, water, or equipment, and even through the air.\nTurkey isn’t alone in facing FMD challenges. The disease is endemic in many parts of the world, particularly in Asia, Africa, and South America. Control measures typically involve vaccination programs, strict quarantine protocols, and the culling of infected animals. The World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) provides comprehensive information on FMD prevention and control.\nRecent Outbreaks and Regional Concerns Recent reports indicate that the current outbreak in Turkey originated in the southeast of the country and has since spread to other regions. The closure of livestock markets is a critical step in preventing further dissemination of the virus. Neighboring countries are also on high alert, strengthening their own surveillance and biosecurity measures.\nThe economic implications of FMD outbreaks can be substantial. Beyond the direct losses to farmers, disruptions to trade and increased control costs can have a ripple effect throughout the agricultural supply chain. What long-term strategies can Turkey implement to bolster its livestock health infrastructure and prevent future outbreaks? The effectiveness of the current measures will depend on swift implementation and widespread cooperation among farmers and authorities.\nChina.org.cn reports on the initial shutdown, while AL-Monitor provides further details on the situation. The Western Producer also covers the impact on agricultural markets.\nPro Tip: Farmers should prioritize disinfection of equipment and facilities to minimize the risk of FMD transmission. Regularly cleaning and disinfecting boots, vehicles, and handling tools can significantly reduce the spread of the virus. Frequently Asked Questions About the Turkish FMD Outbreak What is foot-and-mouth disease and why is it a concern? Foot-and-mouth disease is a highly contagious viral disease that affects cloven-hoofed animals, causing significant economic losses due to reduced productivity and potential trade restrictions.\nHow is foot-and-mouth disease spread? FMD spreads through direct contact with infected animals, contaminated feed and water, and even through the air. It’s crucial to practice strict biosecurity measures.\nWhat is Turkey doing to control the outbreak? Turkey has closed livestock markets nationwide and implemented movement restrictions to prevent the further spread of foot-and-mouth disease.\nIs foot-and-mouth disease a risk to humans? No, foot-and-mouth disease does not affect humans. It is a disease exclusive to animals.\nWhat can farmers do to protect their livestock from FMD? Farmers should implement strict biosecurity protocols, including regular disinfection of facilities, monitoring animals for symptoms, and reporting any suspected cases to authorities.\nWhat are the long-term implications of this outbreak for Turkey’s agricultural sector? The outbreak could lead to significant economic losses for farmers and disruptions to trade. Long-term strategies for prevention and control are essential.\nThe situation remains fluid, and Archyworldys will continue to provide updates as they become available. The swift action taken by Turkish authorities is a critical first step, but sustained vigilance and collaboration will be essential to effectively contain this outbreak and protect the country’s vital livestock industry.\nWhat measures do you think are most crucial for preventing future outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease? How can international cooperation be strengthened to address this global threat?\nShare this article with your network to raise awareness about the importance of livestock health and biosecurity.

    "title": "Hate preacher whines that Fox News is “crooked” because it isn’t anti-LGBTQ+ enough",
    "text": "An anti-LGBTQ+ hate preacher has lashed out at Fox News, describing the right-wing media outlet as “crooked” because it isn’t anti-LGBTQ+ enough. On December 4, writer Hemant Mehta, who covers religion and politics via his Friendly Atheist newsletter and podcast, posted a clip from one of hate-preacher Joe Jones’s sermons. Jones is the pastor of the Shield of Faith Baptist Church in Boise, Idaho. He has previously gone viral for a slur-laced sermon in which he called for LGBTQ+ people to be put to death and claimed that “sodomites are reptilians.” Related: [Pastor preaches that all gay men are “reptilians” & should be put to death] “I’m not saying that every reptilian is a sodomite, but all sodomites are reptilians.” In the more recent sermon, Jones asked his congregation, “Don’t you find it kinda strange that virtually every media outlet is crooked in some way, shape, or form?” Never Miss a Beat [Subscribe to our daily newsletter]to stay ahead of the latest LGBTQ+ political news and insights. But rather than smearing mainstream or even left-leaning media outlets, Jones took aim at Fox News. “You might say, ‘Well, what about Fox News?’” he continued. “Well, Fox News is crooked. And I think we’d all agree on that. You know, Fox News is crooked. Are they gonna tell you that we need to get rid of the sodomites? No. But everybody in here knows if we were able to get rid of the sodomites out of this nation, it would be better overnight. Life would be vastly better overnight. Pedophilia would be down — I mean, just overnight.” Jones has been more explicit in what he means by “get rid of” in the past. “The Bible says they are to be put to death,” he said in a 2022 YouTube video. In the truly unhinged sermon, he went on to echo both right-wing rhetoric falsely associating LGBTQ+ people with child sexual abuse and a conspiracy theory that the U.S. government is secretly controlled by reptilian humanoids from another planet. He claimed that it isn’t God’s fault “that all these pedophiles are around.” “He told nations how to deal with that. He told the nation that he ruled, ‘Put them to death. Put all queers to death,’” Jones said. “And you know what, when they die, that stops the pedophilia. It’s a very simple process, but of course our reptilian government, they don’t subscribe to that.” “I’m not saying that every reptilian is a sodomite, but all sodomites are reptilians,” he added. YouTube has since [removed the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqPA_0ZUmM8) for violating the platform’s hate speech policies.",

    "title": "PF diz que há indícios de 'ações coordenadas' em incêndios ambientais",
    "text": "A PF utiliza imagens de satélite para descobrir o momento e o local onde os incêndios começaram, explicou Freire à Globonews. \"Em alguns casos, a gente vê que alguns incêndios começaram quase que ao mesmo tempo, e isso já traz o indício de que pode ter acontecido ações coordenadas. Isso é um indício, isso é um ponto inicial da investigação, e a gente está explorando sim essas possibilidades\". No início de setembro, a PF informou que investigava 52 casos de incêndios florestais nos quais há suspeita de ação criminosa. O diretor de meio ambiente também disse que a corporação investiga quem são as pessoas ou grupos que financiariam essas ações. Freire ressaltou que o contexto do crime ambiental pode aumentar a pena. \"A gente sabe que muitas vezes o crime ambiental tem penas baixas e por isso que a gente busca investigar o contexto da prática do crime ambiental, quem está financiando, quem está coordenando as ações, quem está dando apoio logístico muitas vezes a esses crimes ambientais\". SP: Incêndios atingem 17 cidades Dezessete cidades de São Paulo têm focos de incêndio ativos na tarde desta sexta-feira (13). Oito dos municípios com focos de incêndio estão na região de Campinas.

    "text": "INDIANAPOLIS — Doctors' offices, hospitals and urgent care facilities are being bombarded with patients. \"We commonly see at least a tripling of the rates of these respiratory illnesses after holiday gatherings, said Dr. Ethan Blocher-Smith, a primary care physician at IU Health. Dr. Blocher-Smith says he sees anyone from adults to kids. \"We've seen a sizable number of older adults coming in with COVID, influenza, and RSV. Typically, with fevers, chills, sometimes nausea, difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, congestion,\" said Dr. Blocher-Smith. Dr. Chris Ross works for the [Community Health Network](https://www.ecommunity.com/) in the Emergency Room. He says not only does the ER see an influx of patients during the holidays, but this year he's seeing patients with multiple respiratory illnesses simultaneously. \"We're seeing some patients with flu and COVID and some patients with the flu and RSV. It's really a smattering of everything at this point in time. It's in all ages of patients. We've seen older patients with a couple different viruses at one time, we've seen younger patients with more than one virus at a time,\" said Dr. Ross. As for those thinking about going to the ER to get treated for your respiratory infection, Dr. Ross says you may be waiting awhile to see somebody. \"After going through triage, they're sorted into a certain category that is not able to get them back to the room quite as quickly because we have other sicker patents that are back,\" said Dr. Ross. Both Dr. Blocher-Smith and Dr. Ross recommends staying home this New Years Eve if you're feeling sick. This way you can stop the spread, all while waking up in the New Year feeling better.",
