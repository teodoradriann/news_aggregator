    "text": "No, no solo los aranceles anunciados por Donald Trump hacen de México uno de los países más caros para ser gamer, pues aunque sí afectarán considerablemente en el costo de consolas, accesorios y hasta videojuegos, hay otros factores que hacen que gastemos más y que aquí te decimos cuáles son.\nSi bien los aranceles de Donald Trump tendrán un impacto en detrimento de la industria del videojuego en México, convirtiéndolo en uno de los países más caros para ser gamer pues Vietnam, uno de los principales socios de Nintendo para la producción de su consola Switch, tendrá que pagar 46 por ciento de impuesto para exportar productos a Estados Unidos, también cualquier producto que quieras comprar seguramente se verá afectado y más si se trata de dispositivos provenientes de mercados que intenten responder a las medidas de Trump, como China.\nLos impuestos encarecen la vida del gamer en México\nLo más triste es que no hay ni para dónde hacerse, pues al no haber una red de distribución local las empresas que se encargan de esa labor deberán asumir esos costos en México para poder vender sus productos, lo que consecuentemente convertirá al nuestro en uno de los países más caros para ser gamer al cobrar la mercancía a un mayor precio.\nTe podría interesar\nEn el caso de Nintendo, cuya consola saldrá a la venta el próximo 5 de junio, hay muy pocas probabilidades de que baje su precio en México por lo menos durante los próximos cinco años, lo que no solo afectará a la industria de los videojuegos, sino también a otras y hasta aumentará el riesgo de que naciones con menor poder adquisitivo sufran un rezago tecnológico, provocando el incremento en las desigualdades sociales.\nLas razones por las que en México sale caro ser gamer\nEn México resulta caro ser gamer principalmente por la paridad del peso frente al dólar, pero también y sobre todo por la presencia de distribuidores que dificultan y encarecen la adquisición de consolas, accesorios y videojuegos, pues elevan sus costos para obtener mayores ganancias: El Nintendo Switch 2, por ejemplo, tendrá un precio sugerido de 13 mil 599 pesos (240 dólares más que en Estados Unidos), mientras que el dispositivo con Mario Kart. World incluido costará 14 mil 899 pesos (260 dólares más que en el vecino país del norte).\nTe podría interesar\nAh, pero eso no es todo, pues otro par de elementos que influyen son el impuesto del 16 por ciento que se aplica a la venta de consolas y videojuegos en México, además de una menor expectativa de venta respecto a otras regiones, lo que incrementa el precio de los dispositivos para obtener mayores ganancias para el distribuidor, quien es el que pondrá los costos con base en un panorama de incertidumbre en el suministro, el tipo de cambio y hasta las políticas arancelarias.",

    "text": "By Lucas McNelly, Sports Contributor ,\n3 hours ago Tournament week has a way of elevating a player in the eyes of the state. Throughout the year, you hear about players doing exceptional things – gaudy stat lines or a video clip on social media – and as great as that can be, it’s not the same as the bright lights of the Tournament. It’s one thing to score 30 points on a random Tuesday in January. But it’s an entirely different thing to do it on the Big Stage in front of thousands of people. I like to joke that “Portland points are worth more,” but there’s a truth to it. Performances mean more during Tourney Week.\nSo the Bangor Daily News asked me to write about who stood out in the 35 games I saw last week at the Portland Expo .\nB South\nYou can’t tell the story of this season without talking about the Oceanside boys and their prolific offense. Cohen Galley was named the MVP of the tournament – and deservedly so. He led the region in Efficiency Rating with 27.0 and averaged 22.7 points, 10 rebounds, and 4.7 assists, nearly had a triple-double in the Regional Final, and kept them alive with 17 when Medomak Valley throttled their offense in the semifinals. Then, in the Regional Final, Carter Galley erupted for 35 and probably would have broken Andy Bedard’s single-game scoring record, had the game been closer.\nHonorable Mention: Gabe Hagar & Casey Duncan (Lincoln Academy), Gabe Lash & Kory Donlin (Medomak Valley), Cai Dougher (Spruce Mountain), Jackson Lubby (Lake Region).\nThe story of the B South girls was Bailey Breen. The Oceanside star averaged 26.0 points and 10.7 rebounds, but the Mariners probably aren’t still playing without Sophia Daggett’s 10.0 rebounds or Renee Ripley’s timely shooting from deep. Similarly, Regional Finalist Spruce Mountain’s Pingree sisters get a lot of attention (as they should), but they don’t make it out of the first round without Avery Bessey, who broke the record for threes in a tournament with 10 (she was a blistering 10/16 from 3 and two of those misses were blocked).\nHonorable Mention: Kytana Williamson, Maya Cannon, and Sara Nelson (Medomak Valley), Margo Tremblay and Ava Smith (Lake Region), Jordyn Crump (Biddeford)\nA South\nI missed a couple of A South girls games, but came away very impressed with Brunswick’s Dakota Shipley and Maddy Werner. They’re both matchup nightmares who are equally comfortable swatting shots inside as they are knocking down threes.\nThe biggest surprise of the region was Deering freshman Angelina Keo, a dynamic playmaker who might be 5 feet tall and scored 16 of Deering’s 27 points in their quarterfinal loss to Fryeburg. I spent most of the game wondering why she didn’t have the ball.\nHonorable Mention: Mina Milosevic (Fryeburg), Jenna Jensen (Mt. Ararat),\nThe A South boys region started with a massive upset, as David Mbuyamba and No. 7 Westbrook beat the defending regional champions Falmouth, but it was Aiden Taylor who truly impressed in the semifinal loss to Noble. Westbrook’s big man nearly willed them to victory with a line of 20 points, 14 rebounds, two assists, four steals, and two blocks.\nOn the other side of the bracket, the Freeport boys were white-hot from three. They shot 55 percent from deep as a team in their two games before eventually falling to No. 1 Gray-New Gloucester. Connor Smith went 9/17 (53 percent) and Big Man JT Pound was an unreal 7 for 10. It was a beautiful thing to watch. In the end, they couldn’t make enough shots to get by GNG.\nIt’s going to take a lot for Hampden to get by GNG. The Patriots are led by three Heberts–yes, three. There’s Nate, the 1,000-point scorer who a lot of people think should have been on the Mr. Basketball semifinalist list and might be one of the best pure shooters in the state. But there’s also the twins, Noah and Aidan. They’re long, fast, dynamic ballplayers who are just a blur on the court. This team is so deep that the MVP of the Region (and their leading scorer at 17.7 ppg), John Patenaude, was fifth on the team in Efficiency Rating with 3.3.\nBut the real breakout star of the Region came from a team brand-new to the scene. Long the doormats of AA, Noble was sent down to A by the MPA’s new relegation policy just as they had started their ascension under new coach John Morgan. From my seat right behind the table, I had a great view of Morgan at work and it was easy to see why his team has turned the corner so quickly. He’s got a bright future. He’s also got a senior playmaking forward in Isaiah Conary who reminds me a little of a well-behaved Draymond Green. But the star was Jamier Rose. Noble’s point guard was electric, easily the best playmaker I’ve seen all year. He dominated the first two games, started slowly in the Regional Final, and almost brought the Knights storming all the way back. He nearly had a triple-double in each of the three games. He was featured in the newsletter on a regular basis this season and somehow he exceeded expectations. He averaged 20 points, seven rebounds, eight assists, and 7.7 steals across the three games and put himself firmly in the lead for next year’s Mr. Basketball race.\nHonorable Mention: Jagger Helwig (Fryeburg), Theo Pow (Kennebunk), Kade Ippolito (Greely)\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "text": "Palestinian Christians have held a sombre Christmas vigil in Bethlehem, with candle-lit hymns and prayers for peace in Gaza instead of the usual festive celebrations at the spot where they believe Jesus Christ was born.\nMost years Bethlehem basks in the central place it holds in the Christian story of Jesus' life, born there in a stable because there was no room for his parents at the inn, and placed in an animal's manger, the humblest of all possible beds.\nSome 2000 years later, pilgrims usually flock to the reputed location of that stable in Bethlehem's Byzantine-era Church of the Nativity, where most Christmases there are joyful displays of lights and trees in Manger Square.\nBut with Israel's campaign in Gaza having killed more than 20,000 people according to health authorities in the Hamas-run enclave, the mostly Palestinian population of Bethlehem in the Occupied West Bank is in mourning too.\nThis year they decided to have no large tree, the usual centrepiece of Bethlehem's Christmas celebrations because of the carnage taking place only 50km away.\nAnd in place of the usual nativity scene, as Christians call the traditional display of figurines representing the holy family, Bethlehem churches this year placed the models amid rubble and barbed wire in solidarity with the people of Gaza.\n\"Bethlehem is a message,\" said Father Ibrahim Faltas, a friar at the vigil.\n\"It is not a city - it is a message of peace to the whole world.\n\"From this sacred place we convey a message of peace ... stop the war, stop the blood, the killing and the revenge.\"\nChristians make up about two per cent of the population across Israel and the Occupied Palestinian territories, according to Protecting Holy Land Christians, a campaign organised by the Heads of Churches in Jerusalem, with a smaller proportion in Gaza.\nThe war, triggered by a Hamas attack on Israeli towns on October 7 that Israel says killed 1200 people, mostly civilians, has kept away the majority of expected foreign tourists hoping to celebrate Christmas in Bethlehem.\nWhen church leaders convened at Bethlehem in early December to mark the start of Advent, as Christians call the weeks before Christmas, there were few people in the usually crowded streets and squares to watch the pared-down display.\n\"This Christmas comes to Bethlehem in a different shape,\" said the town mayor Hanna Hanania, lighting a candle in Manger Square.\n\"Nowadays Bethlehem, as any other Palestinian city, is in mourning.\n\"We feel sad.\"\n ",

    "title": "How I help my students understand the links between the complex medieval period and today's India",
    "text": "What does it mean to teach the history of medieval India in our times? Working at an undergraduate college has helped me see just how complex this endeavour can be. When students come to the classroom, their understanding of Indian history is shaped primarily by what they have learned in school textbooks – but also by popular films and social media.\nTheir attitudes to medieval India often reveal how several faultlines in today’s India have developed.\nMedieval India roughly corresponds to the period between the eighth century CE and the 18th century CE. It saw major changes in religion, political life, law, governance, food and everyday life. It is one of the most debated periods of Indian history, both by historians and among politicised citizens.\nAs someone new to teaching undergraduate students fresh out of school, my challenge is to introduce the idea that the period is more intricate and multi-layered than it is often made out to be.\nThe idea of “medieval India” is the outcome of history being classified into three periods (ancient and modern, being the others) by historians who uncritically adopted this categorisation from the scholars of European history.\nI began the course by introducing what constitutes the “medieval” in India. The shift from the ancient to the early medieval was important, historians say, because land ownership became more complex: rulers granted tax-free land to Brahmins and religious institutions to legitimise their authority.\nThe period also saw the emergence of new regional cultures under various dynasties across the country, each developing distinct literary traditions, religious practices, art forms and political systems.\nAccording to the syllabus, the course follows a chronological order. It starts with the Arab and Turkish invasions of the subcontinent between the eighth and 12th centuries, covering events up to the decline of the Mughals and the arrival of the European East India Companies in the 17th century.\nThis structure, however, does not always help students understand how complex the past is. I was keen on introducing history thematically, alerting students to the history of ideas by drawing their attention to how concepts such as justice, self and community take shape through the unique words, stories and ways of thinking found in India’s many language traditions.\nTo engage students with the long histories of inequality in South Asia and beyond, I try to include topics on social justice in my classes. Many of these disparities stretch back centuries, often taking new forms during the medieval period, shaped by changing regimes, caste hierarchies and religious orthodoxies.\nI also encourage students to reflect on how colonial and Eurocentric narratives have moulded our understanding of India and its histories. The idea is not to reject European perspectives, but to treat them as one among the many sources of our thinking, starting from the Brahminical, Buddhist, Jain and Sufi traditions.\nTo illustrate the point, I introduced students to scholarship on classical music and how the Bhakti and Sufi mystical literary movements profoundly influenced the Carnatic and Hindustani traditions. We also explored how vachanas, a form of poetry that emerged in Karnakata in the 12th century CE, and other poetic forms from the past continue to shape our present. We can trace these literary influences even in contemporary rock bands.\nHere, I witness a range of responses. Some students were curious about how ideas travelled along land and sea trade routes, while others were drawn to people’s everyday lives in medieval times, including systems of law and punishment.\nThey asked thoughtful questions: who owned the land in medieval times, and what was the status of peasants? How did the caste system shape land relations in India? And why is the medieval period so often viewed through the narrow lens of a Hindu-Muslim binary?\nBuoyed by the enthusiasm, I assigned a project on medieval India and was delighted to see them sing vachanas, try out Sufi songs, play the veena and tabla, map trade routes and explore the lives of powerful women through autobiographical narratives centred on the 12th-century mystic poet Akka Mahadevi and the Mughal empress Noor Jahan.\nTheir approach combined archival research with interactive learning methods. One group created imaginary autobiographical diaries of Noor Jahan and staged a play on her assertive presence in a male-dominated Mughal court. By adding visual and performative elements to their work, they tried to subvert the historical silence of women’s voices.\nAnother set of students focused on trade, economy, and cultural exchange, situating their research within the context of Chickpete, a historic neighbourhood in Bengaluru. It began as an exploration of economic history but evolved into an ethnographic engagement with living traditions.\nStudents documented their encounters with shopkeepers, artisans, and caretakers of historical shrines. The market became a space of commerce, community, memory and intercultural dialogue.\nIn today’s artificial intelligence-driven world, their projects offered a powerful reminder that history thrives through narratives, human connection and field visits. These projects underscored how history can be meaningfully connected to the present. By moving beyond rote learning, the students could view the medieval period not as a relic of the past but as a dynamic and living part of the cultural fabric of South Asia.\nMy goal was to help the students gain an understanding of these complex histories and critically examine the various forms of power and control we witness today. To better understand and explain our own experiences, it is essential to understand how to analyse colonial structures of power and knowledge and explore alternative intellectual traditions from various regions and languages.\nI know that most students are unlikely to revisit this historical period unless they pursue higher studies in history. Still, my effort has been to create a space where critical consciousness, aesthetic imagination and inner awakening can lead to meaningful and creative engagement with the past.\nAs the American author bell hooks notes, “The classroom, with all its limitations, remains a location of possibility.” Within this space, education can be an act of freedom – a collective labour of imagining and working toward more just futures.\nChanthu S teaches history at Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Bengaluru, and previously taught at Mount Carmel College (Autonomous), Bengaluru.\nletters@scroll.in.",

    "text": "Un motore a razzo solido Zefiro-40 ridisegnato, il secondo stadio del razzo Vega-C, è stato testato con successo oggi per la seconda volta da Avio presso il suo impianto di Salto di Quirra, in Sardegna. Questa seconda prova segue la prima accensione del motore avvenuta a maggio 2024 e conclude i test per il nuovo design dell’ugello del motore Zefiro-40 .\nGli ingegneri stanno analizzando le prestazioni del motore, con la prima revisione post-test che indica che il nuovo assemblaggio dell’ugello e il motore hanno funzionato come previsto.\nIl test precedente, tenutosi a maggio, è stato eseguito con alta pressione operativa e con un breve tempo di combustione, quello di oggi è stato condotto a bassa pressione operativa e con un tempo di combustione più lungo, in linea con quanto previsto. I due test di accensione sono una procedura standard nella preparazione dei motori a razzo a combustibile solido e permetteranno il ritorno al volo di Vega-C entro la fine del 2024.\nLo Zefiro-40 è un motore a razzo alto 7,6 metri , carico con oltre 36 tonnellate di propellente solido ed è solo uno dei tre stadi a propulsione solida utilizzati da Vega-C. Per questo test il motore è stato installato sul suo banco di prova orizzontale. Zefiro-40 è sviluppato e prodotto da Avio nella sua fabbrica di Colleferro in provincia di Roma.\nAddio Vega, benvenuto Vega-C Vega-C è l’evoluzione della versatile famiglia di razzi Vega, specializzati nel portare in orbita satelliti per l’osservazione della Terra. Il primo Vega è stato lanciato nel 2012 e ha volato 22 volte in 12 anni; il suo ultimo volo è avvenuto il 4 settembre, lanciando perfettamente in orbita il satellite Sentinel 2 .\nVega-C si prepara a raccogliere l’eredità di Vega , assicurando all’Europa un accesso indipendente e versatile allo spazio, integrando la famiglia di razzi Ariane per lanciare qualsiasi satellite in orbita.\nVega-C offre prestazioni aumentate, un volume di carico maggiore e una competitività migliorata. Operando dallo spazioporto europeo nella Guyana francese, dallo stesso sito di lancio di Vega, il razzo estende l’autonomia dell’Europa nello spazio supportando nuove possibilità di missione e include due nuovi stadi a propulsione solida, un miglior stadio superiore e un nuovo fairing, oltre a nuove infrastrutture a terra.\nL’ESA è responsabile della qualificazione del sistema di lancio di Vega-C e acquista anche servizi di lancio per missioni istituzionali europee. Il programma di sviluppo di Vega-C è stato realizzato con la partecipazione di tredici Stati Membri dell’ESA: Austria, Belgio, Repubblica Ceca, Francia, Germania, Irlanda, Italia, Paesi Bassi, Norvegia, Romania, Spagna, Svezia e Svizzera. L’Agenzia è l’autorità contraente per lo sviluppo di Vega-C, supporta sia lo sviluppo che l’utilizzo, fornendo anche supervisione tecnica grazie ai suoi 30 anni di esperienza.\nAvio è il prime contractor e design authority dei lanciatori Vega-C. Arianespace è il fornitore dei servizi di lancio per il prossimo volo di Vega-C previsto prima della fine dell’anno.\nLe dichiarazioni di Urso “ Grande soddisfazione per il buon esito del test odierno sul motore Zefiro 40 che apre la strada al lancio in orbita del vettore VegaC dell’Esa, assemblato dall’azienda aerospaziale italiana Avio. L’Italia e’ sempre piu’ protagonista nella scena spaziale europea e globale “. Lo afferma il ministro delle Imprese e del made in Italy Adolfo Urso , commentando il buon esito del test condotto oggi da Avio a Salto di Quirra, in Sardegna, sul motore solido Zefiro 40, secondo stadio del razzo VegaC. Lo Zefiro 40, sviluppato e prodotto da Avio nello stabilimento di Colleferro (Roma), dopo questa seconda accensione, la prima era avvenuta nel maggio scorso, ha così completato la sua fase di test, aprendo la strada al lancio di VegaC previsto entro la fine del 2024, spiegano dal Mimit. Il lanciatore di ultima generazione VegaC raccoglierà l’eredità del Vega, garantendo all’Europa un accesso allo spazio versatile e indipendente, sottolinea il Mimit.",
