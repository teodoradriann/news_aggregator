[PTI](/pti-stories)| Srinagar | Updated: 24-12-2023 13:47 IST | Created: 24-12-2023 13:35 IST - Country: - India A 72-year-old retired police officer, who was the local ''muezzin'', was shot dead by terrorists while he was giving the call for ''azaan'' from a mosque in Jammu and Kashmir's Baramulla district on Sunday, police said. Recalling the moments before Mohammad Shafi Mir was killed, his cousin Mohammad Mustafa, who was at home, said the call for the pre-dawn prayers was being given by a loudspeaker and suddenly it stopped. His last words were ''reham (mercy)'', he said. The ''azaan'' had stopped at ''Ashhadu Anna Mohammadu Rasool-Allah (I bear witness that Mohammad is the messenger of Allah)'', he said. Police said Mir retired as a senior superintendent of police in 2012. He was shot dead by terrorists inside the mosque in the Gantmulla locality of the north Kashmir district's Sheeri area early Sunday, they said. ''Terrorists fired upon Shri Mohd Shafi, a retired police officer, at Gantmulla, Sheeri Baramulla, while praying 'azaan' in the mosque and succumbed to injuries,'' the Kashmir Zone Police said in a post on X. Mir had become the local ''muezzin'' -- a person who calls for prayers -- and he was devoted to his duties at the mosque, his family members said. Following the incident, a large number of people gathered at Mir's house and at the mosque complex. Mir is survived by his wife, two sons and a daughter. Talking to reporters, Mustafa said, ''He (Mir) was my cousin. He used to call for prayers every day. This morning, while I was reading the Quran, as usual, he started the 'azaan', so I closed the Quran.'' ''He recited 'Ashhadu Anna Mohammadu Rasool-Allah' and then the 'azaan' stopped. I only heard a shout of 'reham' (mercy). It was in a heavy voice,'' he said. Mustafa said he thought Mir might have stopped his call due to some other reason and guessed he could have collapsed due to dizziness. But it was after some time that people came to know about the incident, he said. ''My daughter came and told me that Shafi uncle is died. We went to his house and learnt that Mir had been taken to Baramulla (hospital)...we were told he had suffered bullet injuries,'' he said. Some of Mir's relatives claimed he was shot four times. Mir's younger brother Abdul Kareem said he was sleeping, but was woken up by sounds which he assumed could have been caused because of a problem in the microphone. ''My daughter-in-law said she heard people crying...,'' he said. ''Mir used to give the call for 'azaan' every day. I think this was planned as the Imam Sahib (prayer leader) goes home on Saturday and returns on Sunday,'' Kareem said. Political parties condemned the killing and expressed their condolences to the former police officer's family. The National Conference (NC) said violence can never be tolerated in any form. ''JKNC president Dr Farooq Abdullah and VP @OmarAbdullah express profound sadness over the tragic Baramulla incident, where retired SP Mohammad Shafi was senselessly shot dead,'' the party said in a post on X. Peoples' Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti said innocent people have become ''collateral damage to maintain the facade of normalcy touted'' by the Centre. ''Five jawans martyred in a militant ambush, three innocent civilians tortured to death in custody by army, many still battling for their lives in hospitals and now a retired SP killed. Innocent people have become collateral damage to maintain the facade of normalcy touted by GoI,'' Mufti posted on X. The BJP termed the act dastardly and said terror and terrorists have no religion. ''Dastardly act of killing of 72-year-old retired police officer by those who have no religion. The sons of devil can't even tolerate 'azaan'... Terror and terrorists have no religion. Strongly condemn this killing, express my solidarity with the bereaved family,'' BJP's Jammu and Kashmir spokesman Altaf Thakur said. Jammu and Kashmir Apni Party chief Altaf Bukhari in a post on X said, ''Condemn the cowardly killing of retired SSP Mr. Mohammad Shafi Mir in Gantmulla, Baramulla. My heartfelt condolences to the bereaved family in this hour of utter grief and demise. May the departed soul rest in peace and solace in the world hereafter.'' He said the cowardly act goes on to show the true colours of the killers as the slain was shot upon while giving a call for prayer. Peoples Conference president Sajad Lone also condemned the killing. ''Yet another sad news. My prayers and thoughts are with the family of Mohd Shafi Sahib. May Allah grant him Jannat. And hope that J-K Police recognises the challenges facing it. Evaluating security threat is a science and can't be left to likes and dislikes, and whims,'' Lone said in a post on X.

    "title": "Our Town: Urban farmer fights to end fresh food crises, insecurities in Sunnyside community",
    "text": "While everyone deserves the opportunity to eat healthy, Houston’s Sunnyside neighborhood has historically been overlooked for fresh food options. SEE ALSO: KPRC 2′s Our Town series was in the Sunnyside community 🌞 Here’s what we’re covering Most of the folks in Sunnyside live more than a mile from a supermarket or large grocery store. Roughly 30% are transportation insecure. The two combined have created a crisis of food inaccessibility. “When I walked across that bridge leaving the hospital, I had no clue what I was going to turn this into.” Determined to turn the tide of food insecurity, Ivy Walls courageously made the decision to trade her career in health care for a calling and started Ivy Leaf Farms. That was almost four years ago back in August 2020. “My 1st grant that I received was from Beyonce and the NAACP. And they helped us. You know, soil is very expensive. They helped us get the soil so we could grow this. When I started growing vegetables, it was an outlet to bring some of those things to my community. What we harvest, we take over to Fresh Houwse grocery . We participate in the Black Farmer Box, which is a collective of Black farmers here in the city,” Walls said. Since its inception, Walls said Ivy Leaf Farms has been embraced by the community. “I would honestly say that I’m everybody’s little sister, auntie, and friend,” she added. “It’s been an amazing reception. We’re part of such a beautiful aspect of connecting people back to nature as well as growing food.” In hopes of igniting a revolution in the way her community thinks about fresh food, Walls wanted to make a bold statement. So, she embraced the SLAB car culture and bought a vintage green 1974 Catalina. “Why not green to do the salad SLAB. And so something that resonates culturally as well as its fun and cool and people take a picture and share it and the movement can keep going and going and going. It just tells a bigger story. Like meeting people where they are at. I mean, you could tell people to eat healthy all day long, no matter what socioeconomic class, right? It’s a task,” Walls said. Walls added that what’s been accomplished in Sunnyside can be replicated in other communities across Houston. “We’re working with Acres Homes, Trinity Gardens, Kashmere Gardens to implement, you know, the food pathways that they have. When we think about food insecurity, we have to think about ourselves as a community, as one big community. That if we’re not shopping locally, or growing locally, our food system, at any moment could change. I think we have to be realistic about whose stories we’re uplifting and whose narratives we’re going to lean into. I think when it comes to the success and the notoriety that Black Farmers have created, it’s the fact that we are truly the neighborhood personified. That’s the spirit of Sunnyside. Can’t hide that Sunnyside pride,” Walls said.",

    "text": "Photo: WSET\nFrom our partners over at ABC13-WSET:\nLYNCHBURG, Va. (WSET) — It is with deep sadness that ABC13 announces the passing of Mark Spain, who was a vital anchor in both our newsroom and the community.\nOn Wednesday, December 18, Mark died after a battle with pancreatic cancer. He was born on May 25, 1960 and passed away at 64 years of age.\nHis smile and positivity were known to his family, our team here at WSET, and the thousands across Lynchburg and beyond who welcomed Mark into their homes each night on TV. When he first addressed the community regarding his cancer diagnosis in early December, he echoed that familiar sunny outlook despite the heavy situation.\nHis battle against cancer was not fought alone. Those closest to Mark’s side were his beloved family; with his passing, he left behind his wife, Lynita, and three children: two daughters and a son.\nLynita announced her husband's passing, emphasizing how much love he brought into the world.\n\"Our family along with the city of Lynchburg lost a man of hope, someone who loves his city and stood for equality, treating others with respect and kindness,\" she said. \"He was a husband, father, brother, friend and a positive light in the community. My first true love. He brought so much joy, compassion, love and strength into our lives, and his absence will be deeply felt by all who knew him.\"\nMark fought hard, Lynita said, with his family alongside him. He stayed positive until the end.\n\"We have comfort in knowing he is no longer suffering, it was not easy watching him fight for his life and battle this disease, but he was not alone., and neither were we,\" Lynita said.\nShe thanked the community for the support shown to the Spain family over the past few weeks before turning to the future and asking to keep the prayers coming.\nRead more about the passing of Mark Spain at ABC13-WSET .\nMark Spain with his longtime anchor partners, Danner Evans and George Flickinger.
