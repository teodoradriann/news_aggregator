    "text": "Biden issues order targeting Israeli settlers who attack West Bank Palestinians Updated February 1, 2024 at 4:37 PM ET President Biden issued an executive order on Thursday targeting Israeli settlers in the West Bank who have been attacking Palestinians in the occupied territory. The order named four people and will lay the groundwork for financial sanctions against settlers who carry out violent assaults, which have increased since Hamas launched an attack on Israel three months ago, triggering a full-scale war in Gaza. The order will not target U.S. citizens, who make up a significant number of the settler community. The Biden administration had issued an order late last year imposing travel bans on Israeli settlers who had attacked Palestinians. While only four people are named, the order marks the first time that the U.S. has targeted Israeli settlers with the threat of frozen assets and bank accounts in an attempt to rein in settler attacks on Palestinians living in the West Bank, which Palestinians see as the central plank of a future Palestinian state. \"This violence poses a grave threat to peace, security, and stability in the West Bank, Israel, and the Middle East region, and threatens the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States,\" White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in a statement. There have been almost 500 attacks by settlers on Palestinians in the West Bank, which is largely under Israeli-military occupation, since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, according to the United Nations. Some Palestinians have been killed in these attacks while settlers have also attacked property and torched cars, the Palestinian authorities and human right groups say. Three of the four men named in Thursday's executive order have been prosecuted by Israeli authorities, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters on Thursday. One of the four men cited in the order, Shalom Zicherman, was indicted by Israeli police on assault and damage charges in 2022, after he was filmed attacking left-wing Israeli activists near Hebron, in the southern West Bank, as they traveled to join a demonstration in protest at Palestinians being evicted from their homes, [according to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz.](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2022-06-20/ty-article/.premium/israeli-settler-indicted-for-throwing-stones-at-left-wing-activists/ 181-800a-da88-afef-d5cee72b0000) Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded to the announcement on Thursday, saying, \"Israel acts against all those who break the law everywhere, and therefore there is no room for exceptional measures in this regard.\" But Dror Etkes, an Israeli expert in settler violence, welcomed the news. \"The fact that these people are walking free and they are in the West Bank and can do what they want to do is an indication that the law enforcement system in Israel... prefers not to deal with this type of people,\" he told NPR. \"This is why we came to the point that the American administration is, you know, is sanctioning them,\" he said, adding that all four had been \"involved in severe violent attacks against Palestinians.\" Israel's Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who himself lives in a settlement in the West Bank, [said on X, formerly known as Twitter](https://twitter.com/bezalelsm/status/1753093343507005858?s=46), that \"the 'settler violence campaign is an anti-Semitic lie spread by Israel's enemies with the aim of discrediting the pioneer settlers.\" Copyright 2024 NPR.

    "text": "April 11, 2024 — You may have flown a flight simulator in a computer game or at a science museum. Landing without crashing is always the hardest part. But that’s nothing compared to the challenge that engineers are facing to develop a flight simulation of the very large vehicles necessary for humans to explore the surface of Mars. The Red Planet poses innumerable challenges to astronauts, not the least of which is getting there. That’s where the Department of Energy Office of Science’s user facility supercomputers come in. Researchers at DOE’s Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF) are [working with NASA engineers and scientists to simulate the process of slowing down a huge spacecraft as it moves towards Mars’ surface](https://www.hpcwire.com/off-the-wire/nasa-uses-ornl-supercomputers-to-plan-smooth-landing-on-mars/). Landing spacecraft on Mars isn’t new to NASA. The agency ran its first missions to the planet in 1976 with the Viking project. Since then, NASA has successfully carried out eight additional Mars landings. What makes this goal different is the fact that it’s much more difficult to land the huge spacecraft required for human exploration than those for robotic missions. The robotic vehicles use parachutes to decelerate through Mars’ atmosphere. But a spacecraft carrying humans will be about 20 to 50 times heavier. A vehicle this large simply can’t use parachutes. Instead, NASA will need to rely on retro-propulsion. This technology uses rockets that fire forwards to slow down the vehicle as it approaches the surface. A number of challenges come with using retropropulsion. The high-energy rocket engine exhaust interacts with both the vehicle and the Martian atmosphere. Those dynamics change how the team needs to guide and control the vehicle. In addition, engineers can’t fully replicate how a flight on Mars would go on Earth. While they can test spacecraft in wind tunnels and use other tools, those tools aren’t a perfect replacement or direct analog for the Martian environment. To fill in the gaps, NASA turned to the OLCF supercomputers and their expert computer scientists. In theory, programs running on supercomputers could fully simulate the Martian environment and many of the complex physics associated with using retropropulsion. The project team has relied on FUN3D, a long-standing suite of software tools that models how fluids – including air – move. Engineers created the first version of the code in the late 1980s and have continually made major improvements since then. Agencies and companies in aeronautics and space technology have used it to tackle major challenges. The current Mars effort began in 2019 on Summit, OLCF’s fastest computer at the time. The initial simulations assumed fixed conditions. They simulated just one point along the vehicle’s trajectory. Those early versions allowed scientists to evaluate the impacts of flight speeds, engine settings, and more. Further developments enabled engineers to explore real gas effects. They could account for the liquid oxygen-methane rocket engines and the carbon dioxide-heavy Martian atmosphere. Even these early simulations typically resulted in petabyte-sized datasets. It would take about 1,000 powerful home computers to store a single petabyte. But even these weren’t full simulations – that wasn’t possible yet. The next step was to incorporate a whole new piece of software into the simulation – the Program to Optimize Simulated Trajectories (POST2). NASA developed POST2 to analyze flight mechanics for a broad range of applications. While initial simulations relied on static conditions, POST2 allowed scientists to dynamically “fly” the vehicle in the simulation. The team engaged researchers from Georgia Tech’s Aerospace Systems Design Laboratory. They had previously developed unique strategies to couple POST2 with high-fidelity aerodynamic simulations. Incorporating POST2 also required engineers to change the project workflow. The software’s use was restricted to NASA computing systems for security reasons. As such, the team needed to ensure the NASA systems could communicate smoothly with Summit at OLCF. Resolving issues with firewalls, network interruptions, and other programs required a full year of planning for the cybersecurity and system administration teams at both facilities! The latest advance involved moving the entire simulation over to the newest and most powerful computer at OLCF – [Frontier](https://www.hpcwire.com/2022/05/30/the-final-frontier-us-has-its-first-exascale-supercomputer/). The first exascale computer in the world, Frontier is massively more powerful than previous supercomputers. With a series of coordinated runs over a two-week period, the team ran its most elaborate flight simulation to date. It was a 35-second closed-loop descent from 5 miles altitude to approximately 0.6 miles. The simulation slowed the vehicle from 1,200 miles per hour to approximately 450 miles per hour. POST2 was able to autonomously control the vehicle in a stable fashion using its eight main engines and four reaction control system modules. With the immense power provided by Frontier at OLCF, NASA engineers are moving forward to tackle new frontiers in space travel.

    "text": "Alejandro Char se sumó a la lista de alcaldes electos que decidieron anticiparse a la jornada de posesiones. Usualmente los mandatarios se posesionan el primero de enero de cada año al iniciar el período de su administración, pero esta vez varios optaron por romper los esquemas.El nuevo alcalde de Barranquilla asumió el cargo desde el suroccidente de la ciudad, en el barrio Rebolo. Allí, en medio de una multitud, recibió por tercera vez las riendas de la capital del Atlántico. La primera vez que resultó elegido fue en el período de 2008 a 2011. Luego, volvió a ser alcalde entre 2016 y 2019. En esta ocasión, Álex prometió combatir la inseguridad y trazar iniciativas que permitan aliviar las tarifas de energía.En cuanto a la ola de criminalidad, empezó con crear una nueva dependencia distrital. Se trata de la Alta Consejería para la Seguridad, que estará encabezada por el mayor general en retiro Julio César González, el mayor general Mariano Botero Coy y el coronel Tahir Rivera Suescún. Además, la actual Oficina para la Seguridad y Convivencia Ciudadana pasará a ser la Secretaría Distrital de Seguridad y estará liderada por Yesid Turbay.En palabras propias, el propósito es convertir a Barranquilla en la primera capital del país que utilice la inteligencia artificial para contrarrestar la violencia. Con miras en ese objetivo, SEMANA conoció que se están estudiando exitosos proyectos en México y en Europa. La iniciativa estaría relacionada con desarrollar tecnología de reconocimiento facial y brindar herramientas más efectivas a los miembros de la Policía.En cuanto al sector energético, propuso ser más ambicioso y apuntar a proyectos renovables. Char buscará promover el mejoramiento de las redes eléctricas internas de los hogares más vulnerables, así como el reemplazo de electrodomésticos por modelos más eficientes. Como segundo paso, insistió en la necesidad de instalar paneles solares en las viviendas para cubrir la demanda, lo que permitirá generar luz desde los techos, exportando a la red y compensando con la energía que demande en horas de la noche.Por otro lado, el nuevo alcalde respondió a SEMANA que pondrá sobre la mesa nacional dos propuestas principales en los que espera obtener la ayuda del Gobierno.“Hay dos proyectos estratégicos que vamos a presentarle al presidente Petro; la zona portuaria de aguas profundas está concebida como una solución para permitirles a los puertos actuales que operan en la zona de Barranquilla el recibo de buques de gran calado, que hoy no pueden entrar por al canal de acceso del río Magdalena debido a las restricciones propias del río y su dinámica de transporte de sedimentos”, planteó el mandatario electo. El segundo proyecto consiste en el desarrollo, implementación, construcción y operación de un parque eólico costa afuera, es decir, en el mar, para la generación de energía eléctrica renovable que permitirán la creación de 2.500 a 3.500 empleos directos e indirectos durante desarrollo y construcción.“Este gran proyecto le permitirá a Barranquilla ser una capital verde, amigable y modelo en la preservación del medioambiente y sostenibilidad”, aseguró Alex.Sus escándalos, ¿una piedra en el zapato?La casa Char se ha consolidado como uno de los clanes más poderosos en el Caribe y, constantemente, ha sido blanco de críticas y escándalos. Álex asumió como alcalde en medio de una oleada de cuestionamientos. Su hermano, el exsenador Arturo Char, enfrenta un proceso con las autoridades competentes por su presunta participación en una red de compra de votos en el departamento de Atlántico. Por esa misma situación, Aida Merlano se encuentra tras las rejas y, en reiteradas ocasiones, ha lanzado advertencias contra Álex, asegurando que él también participó en esas compras de votos.Incluso, el abogado Miguel Ángel del Río también le sigue los pasos y advierte con “meterlo preso”. Sumado a ello, en medio de la pasada contienda electoral, un medio de comunicación mexicano reveló que Álex, junto con su familia, tendrían nexos con el cartel de Sinaloa. Un señalamiento bastante grave que generó todo tipo de comentarios.Pero el alcalde se muestra tranquilo y asegura que no se deja intimidar. Ante ese tipo de señalamientos, le contestó a SEMANA :Tenemos el cuero duro y alegría en el corazón, no estaríamos aquí si no fuera así. No nos podemos distraer. Barranquilla exige foco, fortaleza mental y capacidad de innovación. Vamos a mantener nuestro enfoque en el trabajo y en la transparencia institucional, siempre en estrecha relación con las comunidades barriales. Del resto que se encargue la justicia.",

    "text": "MaineDOT begins accessibility work in Boothbay Harbor Maine Department of Transportation (MaineDOT) started work Sept. 17 in downtown Boothbay Harbor, causing some complications for both foot and car traffic. The project aims to make the town compliant with Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements. Mathieu Cutler, a MaineDOT representative on site, said over a handful of sites are planned for Boothbay Harbor. He said the work is focused along Route 27, which is managed by the state, and will not take place on side streets; sites include on Oak Street, Todd Avenue, Union Street and by the library. The work is part of an item in MaineDOT’s three-year plan to make $750,000 of ADA improvements in Boothbay Harbor, Camden and Rockport. Cutler said the entire contract for all three towns is over Nov. 1. According to Cutler, the work in Boothbay Harbor will only be at crosswalks to smooth slopes, reduce tripping hazards and, in some places, add signs. Overall, he said the goal is to make the areas safer for people with disabilities such as the blind or those in wheelchairs. Town Manager Julia Latter said she inspected several sites with MaineDOT last year when it informed the town what needed to be done for ADA rules. However, the timing of this work was a surprise to both the town and local businesses. “We couldn't have let (businesses) know beforehand,” she said. “We don't know when the state is going to do their work.” The work also involves tearing up sections of downtown sidewalk bricks, some of which were recently installed as part of the town’s sidewalk rehabilitation project. Cutler said MaineDOT will be covering the cost of repairing the altered sections, but they would likely be concrete to match ADA requirements. Despite some disruptions, Latter said the MaineDOT project is a good thing. She said there are many reasons for it including hazard mitigation and safety. “I’m thankful they are making our town ADA compliant.”",

    "text": "The United States issued financial sanctions on Thursday against four Israelis accused of escalating violence against civilians, intimidating civilians or destroying property in the West Bank.\n“The United States has consistently opposed actions that undermine stability in the West Bank and the prospects of peace and security for Israelis and Palestinians alike,” the U.S. State Department said in a statement.\nHere’s what we know about the four, all men ranging in age from 21 to 32. David Chai Chasdai, 29\nMr. Chasdai initiated and led a riot on the Palestinian town of Huwara, the State Department said in a statement , which resulted in the death of a Palestinian civilian. The New York Times reported on a rampage in Huwara and neighboring villages on Feb. 26, 2023, that started after two settlers were shot and killed. Israeli settlers burned and vandalized homes, businesses and vehicles, and one Palestinian was killed.\nYoav Gallant, Israel’s defense minister, initially signed an administrative detention warrant — a policy of indefinite imprisonment without trial that Israel almost exclusively uses against Palestinians — for Mr. Chasdai in March 2023, according to Israeli news media. A few days later, an Israeli court later shortened his detention by a month.\nIn 2013, Mr. Chasdai was detained for assaulting a taxi driver, according to an Israeli legal database. He was represented at the Jerusalem District Court by Itamar Ben Gvir, a lawyer and politician, who is now serving as Israel’s minister of national security. The court decided not to extend Mr. Hasdai’s detention, as requested by a police department in charge of investigating nationalistically motivated crimes, because of a lack of evidence. Yinon Levi, 31\nMr. Levi led a group of settlers who “engaged in actions creating an atmosphere of fear in the West Bank,” according to the State Department statement, and has joined other settlers in repeatedly attacking Palestinian communities in the West Bank.\nThe State Department said he was from Meitarim Farm, an illegal Israeli settlement in the south West Bank.\n“He regularly led groups of settlers from the Meitarim Farm outpost that assaulted Palestinian and Bedouin civilians, threatened them with additional violence if they did not leave their homes, burned their fields, and destroyed their property,” the statement said. Einan Tanjil , 21\nMr. Tanjil was described by the State Department as being involved with “assaulting Palestinian farmers and Israeli activists by attacking them with stones and clubs, resulting in injuries that required medical treatment.”\nHe was charged in 2021 with assaulting an Israeli activist, Neta Ben Porat, a high-tech sector worker and mother of three, according to a Facebook post by Mehazkim, an Israeli center-left political page.\nThe post said that Mr. Tanjil was charged with hitting her in the head and legs with a club when she and other Israeli pro-Palestinian rights activists were helping Palestinian farmers harvest olives near Surif, a Palestinian town in the West Bank. Shalom Zicherman , 32\nMr. Zicherman assaulted Israeli activists and their vehicles in the West Bank, the State Department said, citing video evidence. He cornered at least two of the activists and injured them both, the statement added.\nMr. Zicherman threw stones at the vehicle of Israeli left-wing activists outside the Palestinian area of Masfar Yata, injuring one of them and breaking the car’s window, according to a video filmed by an activist.\nThe post Who are the four Israelis placed under U.S. sanctions over West Bank violence? appeared first on New York Times .",

    "text": "Welcome to [Shaving Strokes](https://golf.com/shaving-strokes/), a new GOLF.com series in which we’re sharing improvements, learnings and takeaways from amateur golfers just like you — including some of the speed bumps and challenges they faced along the way. With the holidays here, there’s no better time to gift your favorite golfer a Short Game Chef membership. Take the next step toward mastering your game by using the code GOLF15 for 15% off! [CLICK HERE](https://www.shortgamechef.com/?utm_source=golfcom&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=golf_articles)! On most 18-hole golf courses, more than half the holes are typically par-4s, which means there’s no escaping ’em. And sure, every so often you’ll get a straightforward par-4 with a wide fairway and no hazards. But plenty of par-4s will test your entire game, forcing you to navigate narrow landing areas off the tee, work your way around doglegs to the right or left and dodge trees, water, and bunkers — all before you get to the green. As someone who bleeds too many shots everywhere, par-4s included, I was lucky enough to get a lesson from Parker McLachlin, aka [the Short Game Chef](https://www.shortgamechef.com/?utm_source=golfcom&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=golf_articles), who, in addition to being a [short game maestro](https://golf.com/instruction/short-game/modern-chipping-technique-parker-mclachlin/), has also won a PGA Tour event in his career. In the video above, McLachlin helps me navigate a par-4 hole at [Tacoma Country & Golf Club](https://www.golftcgc.com/), and shares some of his wisdom on how to plan better with improved course management. Check it out to see how you can play better, too! McLachlin’s tips to better navigate par-4s From the moment we meet on the tee box, McLachlin jokes about how he’s notorious for showing up late to a tee time, giving him very little time to warm up. While that’s not his suggested way of doing things, it often happens to players who struggle with balancing golf life with actual life. So he says using a weighted club to “shock the nervous system” is a great way to loosen up. Something like TheStack ( [available here](https://fairwayjockey.com/products/hardware-app-bundle-thestack?_pos=1&_psq=thestack&_ss=e&_v=1.0?utm_source=golfcom&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=navigate-par-4s-course-management-parker-mclachlin)) is a good recommendation. After hitting our tee shots, McLachlin reminds me that it’s important to celebrate success, given that golf is so hard. This is a great way to reinforce positivity and help build your confidence. As we made our way down the hole, we come across a dilemma: a 50-60-foot tree that was protecting our approach shot into the green from about 130 yards out. This is where McLachlin’s expertise came into play — and course management becomes so important. For a player of his caliber, sailing a shot over the tree and onto the green is a piece of cake. He’s practiced this shot, he knows his club of choice, and he has the confidence to stick it on the green. But for an amateur like myself, it’s either choosing the hero shot route — and trying to impress McLachlin with a higher-risk play — or being smarter by eliminating the tree altogether. I chose the latter. “At the end of the day, the golfer’s got to be most comfortable with that decision,” McLachlin tells me. “So analyze what’s going on, figure out things like the yardage, wind, shape, trajectory; all that stuff, and then [internally] check what feels best.” McLachlin then reminds me why course management is so crucial for amateur players like myself (who’s [trying to break 80](https://golf.com/instruction/is-life-hack-break-80-2-top-teachers/) for the first time), in order to reach their goals. “This course management thing, it’s going to be really big for you as you start getting your technique better with the full swing, the short game, and your putting,” he says. “How do you manage your emotions? What are you thinking about? All of that stuff takes you from the mid-to-high 80s to the high 70s. That’s important.” Armed with better knowledge and the proper mindset, McLachlin and I continue on to finish the par-4, with him providing instruction on chipping and putting.
