    "text": "Era stato picchiato da tre persone dopo essere uscito dal barbiere lo scorso 9 maggio, in quello che sembrava un episodio di delinquenza legato alla movida. E invece gli investigatori di Palermo hanno scoperto che la vittima del pestaggio non era stata scelta a caso. Il 21enne era stato seguito e poi aggredito in una spedizione punitiva dopo una presunta violenza sessuale. Per questo il sostituto procuratore Clio Di Guardo, che fa parte del pool di magistrati del dipartimento “fasce deboli”, ha chiesto e ottenuto dal giudice per le indagini preliminari un’ordinanza di custodia cautelare che è stata eseguita la scorsa settimana. Il 21enne è ora nel carcere Pagliarelli con l’accusa di violenza sessuale. L’agguato sarebbe stato organizzato dal padre e dal fratello della presunta vittima, insieme a una terza persona che deve essere ancora identificata. È stato proprio il padre della ragazza, una volta che gli agenti hanno individuato gli aggressori, a confessare quanto accaduto. La figlia sarebbe stata violentata dopo una serata trascorsa in un locale palermitano. Il 21enne era stato picchiato a sangue e, ancora stordito, era stato soccorso dai sanitari del 118. In ospedale i medici gli avevano diagnosticato una prognosi di 20 giorni, ma lui aveva chiesto di tornare a casa e aveva firmato le dimissioni dal nosocomio.

[Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| New Delhi | Updated: 29-12-2023 21:31 IST | Created: 29-12-2023 21:31 IST - Country: - India In presence of Union Home Minister and Minister of Cooperation, Shri Amit Shah, a Memorandum of Settlement signed between Government of India, Government of Assam and representatives of United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA), in New Delhi, today. The Agreement is a significant milestone to fulfil Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s vision of a peaceful, prosperous and insurgency-free Northeast and bringing everlasting peace, prosperity and all-round development of Assam. Assam Chief Minister, Dr. Himanta Biswa Sarma and senior officials of the Ministry of Home Affairs and Government of Assam were also present during the signing of the MoU. On this occasion, Shri Amit Shah said that today is a golden day for Assam when peace is going to be established in Northeast and Assam, which have been bearing the brunt of violence for a long time. He said that after Shri Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister in 2014, efforts were made to bridge the gap between Delhi and Northeast and talks with everyone started with an open mind. Shri Shah said that under the guidance of Prime Minister Modi, the Ministry of Home Affairs worked with the vision of a Northeast, free from extremism, violence and conflict. He said that in last 5 years, 9 peace and border related agreements have been signed with different states in the Northeast, these have established peace in large part of the Northeast. The Union Home Minister said that on record more than 9000 cadres have surrendered and the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) has been lifted from 85 percent area of Assam. He said that due to the tripartite agreement being signed today between the Government of India, the Government of Assam and ULFA, the Modi government has achieved success in eliminating all the violent groups in Assam. He said that today's agreement is very important for peace in Assam and the entire Northeast. He said that under today's agreement, ULFA representatives have agreed to abjure path of violence, lay down all their arms and ammunition and disband their armed organisation. Apart from this, ULFA has also agreed to vacate all camps occupied by its armed cadres, engage in the peaceful democratic process established by law and maintain the integrity of the country. Shri Amit Shah said that In ULFA conflict, about 10 thousand people from both sides were killed, who were citizens of this country, but today this problem is being completely resolved. He said that Government of India has agreed to provide a huge package and several big projects for all round development of Assam. He said that the Modi government will comply with all provisions of the agreement. Shri Shah said that after formation of Modi government in 2014, violent incidents in Assam decreased by 87%, deaths by 90% and kidnappings by 84%. He said that so far 7500 cadres have surrendered in Assam alone, which will have addition of 750 more today, thus the surrender of over 8200 cadres in Assam alone is the beginning of a new era of peace. The Union Home Minister said that the Modi government has signed NLFT agreement in 2019, Bru and Bodo in 2020, Karbi in 2021, Adivasi agreement in 2022, Assam-Meghalaya border agreement, Assam-Arunachal border agreement and agreement with UNLF in 2023 and today, with ULFA. He said that with this agreement today, a new era of peace is going to begin for the entire Northeast and especially Assam. Shri Amit Shah said that a time-bound program will be made by the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India, to fulfill the demands of ULFA and a committee will also be formed for its monitoring. He said that in all the agreements signed after 2019, the Modi government is ahead of time and efforts have been made to fulfill all the conditions. Home Minister said that this would not have been possible without Prime Minister Modi's broader vision of an insurgency-free Northeast. (With Inputs from PIB)",

    "text": "HUNDREDS of students from Pis-anan National High School and Pis-anan Elementary School in Barangay Pis-anan, Sibalom, Antique were hospitalized on July 2, 2025, after reportedly inhaling a strong, foul odor that triggered mass symptoms including dizziness, chest pain, and vomiting.\nFlorence Mathew T. Besares, medical specialist III and psychiatrist from Ramon Maza Sr. Memorial District Hospital (RMSMDH), emphasized that the patients' symptoms should not be dismissed.\n“Let's not just rush to say that there are anxiety disorders (the children who were admitted). You're right, he caused the symptoms in the patients to react in a way that you didn't expect, which is not natural to be allowed to happen,\" Besares said.\nAntique Governor Paolo Javier thanked the medical staff of Angel Salazar Memorial General Hospital (ASMGH), RMSMDH, and other district hospitals for their swift response.\nAs of 11:45 p.m., July 2, 2025, ASMGH reported 88 patients treated, four of whom were admitted. All were in stable condition, and none were in critical status.\nChief Nurse Czerwin Juales of ASMGH urged the public to stay calm and not panic.\nThe Provincial Health Office will offer psychological services to patients at ASMGH and a triage center at Barangay Pis-anan gymnasium, deploying nurses from multiple district hospitals to handle staff shortages.\nGovernor Javier, joined by Congressman Antonio “AA” Legarda Jr. and San Jose Mayor Paul Joseph Untaran, continued monitoring the situation throughout the night and assisted in providing relief, including the distribution of arroz caldo to patients and staff. Additional tents were also set up outside ASMGH, and folding beds were requested from the public to accommodate the influx of patients.\nAround 10 p.m., Lovely Mendoza, an 18-year-old resident of Barangay Mabini, Sibalom, brought her sister Mia, a Grade 10 student, back to the hospital after Mia experienced chest pain and vomited at eight o'clock in the evening. Mia is just among the number of students returning to hospitals after early symptoms returned.\nThis case highlighted a troubling pattern: several students who had previously recovered began returning to the hospital with renewed symptoms.\nDr. Annabelle P. Yumang, regional director of the Department of Health - Center for Health Development in Western Visayas, received an urgent request for additional medical manpower and equipment.\nIn an official letter, Javier requested doctors, nurses, and folding beds to support the overwhelmed hospitals.\nAccording to the Provincial Health Office, initial symptoms reported among students included headaches, dizziness, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and even fainting. All affected individuals were treated either at RMSMDH or ASMGH.\nAn inter-agency investigation is underway to determine the cause and source of the foul odor. Emergency response teams and health personnel have been deployed to the affected areas, and both hospitals remain on high alert.\nThe public is urged to avoid the vicinity of Barangay Pis-anan while authorities investigate. Residents experiencing symptoms are advised to seek medical care immediately. Officials also cautioned the public against spreading misinformation, which could worsen panic and hysteria.\n“This is a medical emergency. Please refrain from posting fake news or unverified information,” said ASMGH in a public advisory.\nJavier also personally helped transport foam mattresses lent by Delegate Angel Salazar Jr. Memorial School to the third floor of the Provincial Health Office.\nRed alert status\nOn July 2, 2025, the Emergency Operations Center was raised to Red Alert Status to ensure full coordination and immediate medical response. As of 3:45 p.m., a total of 323 patients were recorded and treated across multiple locations:\n- 209 admitted at RMSDH, with 19 treated as outpatients.\n- 32 admitted at ASMGH, with one outpatient.\n- 82 treated on-site at Barangay Pis-anan, and 22 more evaluated at the barangay triage.\nThe symptoms reportedly began between 7:30 a.m. and 8 a.m., causing widespread panic among students, parents, and faculty. Initial accounts suggest the source was a pungent chemical odor believed to have drifted into classrooms from a nearby insecticide application.\nThe Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office (PDRRMO) led the coordinated response, supported by:\nOne ambulance with 10 personnel from the Office of the PDRRMO;\nEight ambulances and 14 rescue vehicles from the Municipal Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Offices (MDRRMO) of Sibalom, Hamtic, San Jose, and Belison with 44 responders;\nFour ambulances from the Rural Health Unit (RHU) and Municipal Health Offices (MHO) of Hamtic and San Jose with 22 personnel;\nSix private vehicles offering voluntary transport;\nTwenty-five personnel from the Department of Health (DOH) in Western Visayas;\nTwo police patrols from the Philippine National Police (PNP) Sibalom and Barangay Pis-anan with 11 officers;\nOne fire truck with five personnel from the Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP);\nBarangay officials and tanods from Pis-anan and Catmon, with nine Government Internship Program interns;\nTwo investigators from the provincial government. A triage area was set up at RMSDH and ASMGH, while a temporary staging and triage area was established at the Barangay Pis-anan Covered Court. An Incident Command Post was also activated near the school to streamline operations and agency coordination.\nThe responding units conducted on-site assessments, delivered first aid, transported students to medical facilities, and managed the crowd to ensure the safety of the remaining school community.\nAs a result of this incident, both RMSDH and ASMGH reached full capacity, prompting a regional call for folding beds and additional healthcare workers.\nWhile the origin of the foul smell remains unknown, the community’s collective effort — from government leaders to medical professionals to ordinary citizens — helped mitigate the immediate impact of this emergency.\nHealth officials confirmed that all patients received immediate medical attention either on-site or at hospitals.\nAn inter-agency investigation is ongoing to determine the origin and exact nature of the chemical odor. Officials continue to urge residents to avoid the area while assessments are conducted.\nAs of July 3, hospitals in Antique remain on high alert. Public health teams and emergency responders are monitoring affected individuals, while local leaders and volunteers work round-the-clock to support recovery efforts.\nDepEd Antique has suspended Pis-anan National High School and Pis-anan Elementary School until safety is ensured, following a health and environmental incident that led to temporary class suspensions pending full clearance from authorities..

    "text": "WOODSTOCK, CT ( WFSB /Gray News) - Fourteen puppies were rescued from a rollover crash that closed a road in Woodstock, Connecticut Thursday morning. Several fire agencies responded to Senexet Road between Laurel and Bull Hill roads for a single-vehicle rollover accident involving wires down. Firefighters found a pole that had snapped, with wires down, and called Eversource CT to disable the power. Power was out in the area while the electricians worked. Officials say minor injuries were originally reported, but no one ended up being hurt. First responders also rescued and provided care for 14 puppies at the scene. the Muddy Brook Fire Department shared photos on Facebook of firefighters interacting with the puppies. The Necogg Humane Society and a doctor from Peake Brook Veterinary Center responded to the scene to provide veterinary care and shelter to the animals, firefighters said. Some puppies will be taken to a veterinary office for further care. Drivers were warned to expect a “long duration road closure.” Copyright 2024 WFSB via Gray Media Group, Inc. All rights reserved.",
