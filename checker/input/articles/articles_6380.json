[Reuters](/reuters-stories)| London | Updated: 20-01-2024 04:00 IST | Created: 20-01-2024 04:00 IST - Country: - United Kingdom Britain's opposition Labour Party signaled it would continue the current government's strong support for Ukraine in its war with Russia if it came to power, with its foreign policy spokesperson warning the rest of Europe against complacency. The Labour Party is currently around 20 percentage points ahead of the governing Conservatives in opinion polls ahead of an election expected this year, while February will mark the two-year anniversary of Russia's full invasion of Ukraine. In a speech on Saturday, Labour's foreign policy chief David Lammy will reiterate Labour's desire for a new British-EU security pact, and will say that if Labour came to power, he would visit Kyiv in the first 100 days in office \"to demonstrate Labour's long-term commitment to stop Vladimir Putin and begin work on a pathway towards Ukraine's NATO membership.\" \"We in Europe risk taking our eye off the ball,\" Lammy will say, according to extracts of the speech, which added he would label Putin a \"ringleader of a new form of fascism\". Lammy criticised the Conservatives for damaging Britain's standing on the world stage over 14 years of government, during which Britain left the European Union. He will also cite the Middle East as an arena where Britain's diplomatic standing has fallen, saying the country's reputation for preventative diplomacy \"needs urgent revival.\" \"We must return to diplomacy to stop the whole region descending into full-scale war,\" he will say, adding Labour would seek a new International Contact Group to work towards peace in the Middle East. Labour has backed Israel's right to retaliate against Hamas after the militant group's deadly Oct. 7 assault, but has also called for a \"sustainable ceasefire\", predicated on the release of hostages, to end the bombardment of Gaza and prevent escalation in the region, and wants to work towards a two-state solution. \"The quest for Palestinian statehood is a just cause,\" Lammy will say. \"That is why a Labour government will work with international partners to recognise the state of Palestine.\" (This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

    "text": "Looking for a gift for your grandchild? Help educate them.\nA Winnetka reader suggests grandparents pitch in for their grandkids’ education after high school. Others write about Eileen O’Neill Burke’s ‘war zone’ description of Chicago, why Biden should ‘Trump-proof’ the government with more pardons, and the tragedy of an Oak Park detective’s murder.\nGrandkids already have lots of “stuff.” As the holidays approach, consider a gift that keeps on giving, that being a monetary contribution to a post-high school education fund. Said funds can be used for college, trade school, specialized training, all related to preparing your grandchildren for gaining skills to enable them to find long-term meaningful employment.\nEmployers hire new people to fulfill specific needs within their organizations. Speaking for myself, having a B.A. degree in economics provided a macro understanding of how the economy works. However, to be able to communicate with employees and supervisors in a plant production arena, I took many short courses in science, technology, engineering and math-related subjects to acquire enough knowledge to fully understand the big picture and to be able to surround myself with people with the skill levels I needed (and knew had to be more advanced than my own to make plant operation successful).\nBottom line: Education has to continue well beyond high school and even college. I would interview applicants with more “degrees” than a thermometer, but depth of knowledge was often lacking. Wiring a house is not the same as wiring a control panel with a maze of integrated circuitry. Give the gift that keeps on giving.\nKing Embry, Winnetka\nSEND LETTERS TO: letters@suntimes.com.

Letters should be a maximum of approximately 375 words.\nShooting down words of war\nThe new Cook County state’s attorney compared Chicago’s gun violence to a [“war zone.”](https://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/2024/12/02/eileen-oneill-burke-cook-county-states-attorney) Maybe Eileen O’Neill Burke should go on a fact-finding mission to Ukraine. Is it the duty of every elected official to exaggerate the problems they face? (See Mayor Brandon Johnson’s disingenuous performance.) She can follow her statement by blaming the last state’s attorney, taking another page out of Johnson’s playbook.\nO’Neill Burke’s statement was an insult to the service people who have been in a real war zone.\nKevin Berg, Fox Lake\nMore pardons needed to Trump-proof country\nI 100% agree with the pardon of Hunter Biden and here’s why. The Republicans investigated him for the last two years of the Trump administration and found nothing. They have trashed him for the last six years in the press and for the last two years, the Republican-majority House has tried everything but to tar and feather Joe Biden and came up with nothing. So, let’s look at the charges Hunter Biden was convicted of. Number one: the gun that he had illegally for 11 days. The fact is the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives rarely has brought charges against a single person for the purchase of a single gun. Number two: tax issues. He cheated on his taxes (Yes. So has Donald Trump). He’s paid his back taxes and his late charges, so fine him and move on. This entire thing has been 100% political ploy.\nIf I were President Biden, I would issue a pardon to every Cabinet member and their top assistants across the board. I would pardon retired General Mark Milley and all of the members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. I would issue a pardon for every executive level employee in the justice, defense, education, energy and border protection departments, Environmental Protection Agency, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and of course, Dr. Anthony Fauci.\nIf this doesn’t go far enough to stop Trump’s witch hunt, I would issue a blanket pardon for the entire federal government.\nWith this out of his way, Trump can make American great again.\nJeffery Carr, Carol Stream\nToo many guns\nHow did we get to be a country where we put up with travesties like a police officer’s being fatally shot near the Oak Park Public Library at 9:30 a.m.? Where we live in terror whenever our kids go outside or, even scarier, go to school? Where people value their guns over human life? And many folks erroneously think these guns make them safer. Somehow I don’t think this is what the Founding Fathers had in mind.\nDeborah Donovan, Berwyn\nA new pledge to the flag\nSince the Supreme Court granted Donald Trump immunity from the law, thus rendering him lawless, and should he escape punishment for his felonies because of his money, I propose a new Pledge of Allegiance:\nI pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the plutocracy for which it stands: One nation under God, with liberty only for those who can obtain and retain more wealth for themselves, with freedom from governmental regulation, from equality, and from justice for all others.\nMarion J. Reis, Lombard\nOhtani would make fewer errors in the Oval Office\nWhile the concept of “[Golden At-Bats”](https://www.npr.org/2024/12/04/nx-s1-5214636/mlb-is-considering-a-rule-change-what-is-the-golden-at-bat-proposal) seems preposterous in the traditional game of baseball, it’s not without some merit elsewhere.\nFor instance, maybe the next time Donald Trump brings up tariffs or tax cuts for the wealthy, maybe Shohei Ohtani can be announced as a designated decision-maker. After all, the Japanese superstar has succeeded at everything else, why not global economics as well?\nBob Ory, Elgin\n[Commentary](https://chicago.suntimes.com/opinion)\n[What, you thought things wouldn't continue to be awkward at Halas Hall after Bears fired Matt Eberflus?](https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears/2024/12/04/things-continued-to-be-awkward-at-halas-hall-after-matt-eberflus-firing-kevin-warren-ryan-poles-mccaskey)\n[Chris Beatty missed on QB Caleb Williams as recruit, now in his ear as new Bears offensive coordinator](https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears/2024/12/05/chris-beatty-missed-on-qb-caleb-williams-as-recruit-now-in-his-ear-as-new-bears-offensive-coordinator)\n['& Juliet' puts a fabulous new spin on Shakespeare's cherished story of starcrossed lovers at Cadillac Palace](https://chicago.suntimes.com/theater/2024/12/05/juliet-review-a-fabulous-new-spin-on-shakespeares-cherished-story-of-starcrossed-lovers-at-cadillac-palace-chicago)",
