    "text": "The member of the Foreign Policy Commission, Sovereignty and Integration of the National Assembly (AN), deputy Roy Daza, warned that the Supreme Court of Justice gave a “definitive ruling” in relation to the request to lift disqualifications against those who requested it, in accordance with the provisions of the Barbados Agreement. No power in the world, neither the United States Congress nor the White House, is going to impose laws and decisions on our judiciary, much less on this parliament,” explained Daza. He was also emphatic in stating that Venezuela will ask the United States government and its Treasury Department to completely lift the sanctions \"against our country that represent a crime against humanity, and that Venezuela does not accept any type of blackmail.\" He asserted that the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (Psuv) has ratified continuing with the dialogue because this constitutes a national interest and not a political partiality. “The dialogue has served as a group of political stability and those who today try to blow it up are because they are imbued with disrespect for the constitution and prefer to walk along paths contrary to legality,” he stated. Sanction to the humble For his part, the deputy for Democratic Action (AD), Luis Eduardo Martínez, said that the sanction applied against Venezuelan gold and the threat of doing the same with oil and gas, only harms the humble people. “If they reimpose the sanctions, the heads of the Government and the extremist opposition leaders will continue to eat full. Those who will suffer the most from its consequences are millions of humble Venezuelans who are on the margins of the conflict,” said the opposition leader. Martínez indicated that the same American congregation recognizes that the sanctions \"have not had a political effect.\"",

    "text": "[Community Corner](/new-york/northfork/around-town) LI's Dazzling Northern Lights Due To Rare Geomagnetic Storm: Photos The sky was alive Thursday night as Mother Nature brought the aurora borealis, or Northern lights, close to home. Send your photos to Patch. LONG ISLAND, NY — A rare [geomagnetic storm Thursday](https://patch.com/us/across-america/severe-geomagnetic-storm-means-aurora-may-be-seen-third-u-s) led to a dazzling display of aurora borealis, or Northern lights, in the night sky — stirring up excitement among those who savored what they said was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Here's why it happened: Space weather forecasters have issued a [severe, G4-level geomagnetic storm watch](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/g4-severe-storm-watch-10-11-october), only the second of that severity in 20 years, after a strong X-class solar flare and coronal mass ejection that was set to push the aurora borealis from the northern states as far south as Alabama Thursday and Friday. No matter what the explanation, Long Islanders were in awe: \"I can't believe it,\" Albie de Kerillis told Patch. \"I have never witnessed anything like this in my lifetime.\" Find out what's happening in North Forkwith free, real-time updates from Patch. Forecasters with the Space Weather Prediction Center, a division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said in a news briefing Wednesday that the CME, carried to Earth by fast-moving solar winds, was due to arrive Thursday morning or midday Eastern time. The CME arrived as predicted The storm watch alert says the aurora might become visible over much of the northern half of the country, and maybe [as far as Alabama and northern California](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/g4-severe-storm-watch-10-11-october). Find out what's happening in North Forkwith free, real-time updates from Patch. [Geomagnetic storm alerts are rare](https://patch.com/us/across-america/northern-lights-may-dance-far-south-alabama-weekend). In May, NOAA issued a similar statement about the strong solar storm that produced the strongest aurora display in perhaps hundreds of years. The aurora was visible widely in the United States, including in places near the southern border, and around the world. The geomagnetic storm is ranked a G4 on a scale of 1-5, and the [Kp Index](https://patch.com/us/across-america/aurora-borealis-hunting-what-s-kp-index-more-northern-lights-tips), the measure of auroral strength, is 8 on a scale that tops at 9. A Kp index of 5 is generally required for the aurora borealis to be visible. The X1 flare that produced it isn’t nearly as strong as the [X8.7 flare in May](https://patch.com/us/across-america/northern-lights-may-dance-far-south-alabama-weekend) that made the aurora visible in areas along the southern U.S. border, or the more recent even stronger X9 flare that produced [northern displays in about a third of the country](https://patch.com/us/across-america/northern-lights-may-dance-over-third-u-s-after-huge-solar-flares) this week. “Lady Aurora,” as some people have begun to call the shimmering curtains of pink, red, green and yellow, is fickle. Strong solar flares and high Kp indexes don’t always translate to light displays. Mike Bettwy, the head of the SWPC’s forecast office, said aurora chasers are usually rewarded within a couple of hours after nightfall. Patience is a key, he said. “The key is the magnetic orientation,” he said. “It’s remarkable how quickly the aurora can shut down and diminish, and just as quickly return.” If you have photos to share, email Lisa.Finn@patch.com.

    "text": "Beirut-. Amigos de la solidaridad destacaron en Líbano el respaldo histórico de Cuba a la causa palestina, en la continuación hoy de la agresión israelí contra el pueblo de la Franja de Gaza. En ocasión del 65 aniversario del triunfo de la Revolución Cubana, representantes de la Asociación de Amistad Palestina, la Liga de los Graduados de las Universidades e Institutos en la isla y la Liga Popular refrendaron la condena al régimen de apartheid sionista. Bajo el título «Cuba y Palestina enfrentan un enemigo común», los oradores coincidieron en el rechazo al imperialismo estadounidense, en su condición de principal patrocinador del terrorismo y aliado de la ocupación israelí. En la sede de la Liga Popular en Tareek El Jadideh, en esta capital, el presidente de la organización Raji Al Hakim resaltó el ejemplo de resistencia del pueblo cubano frente al bloqueo impuesto por Washington en más de seis décadas. Al mismo tiempo, evocó el ejemplo revolucionario del líder cubano, Fidel Castro, y el guerrillero internacionalista Ernesto Che Guevara para los procesos independentistas del mundo. En la ocasión, el titular de la Liga de los Graduados Palestinos en Universidades e Institutos de la mayor de las Antillas, Ali El Khatib, agradeció el otorgamiento de becas anuales por parte de la nación a los palestinos en medio de las dificultades económicas. A nombre de la Asociación de Amistad, el doctor Fayez Al Bibi recordó cómo en 1947 Cuba fue el único país latinoamericano que votó en contra del plan de partición de Palestina. En su intervención, rememoró las palabras de Fidel Castro ante la ONU en 1979 cuando denunció el asedio sionista contra los palestinos, “despojados de sus tierras, expulsados de su propia patria, dispersados por el mundo, perseguidos y asesinados”. También, significó el encuentro del presidente cubano Miguel Díaz-Canel con un grupo de estudiantes palestinos en noviembre pasado y sus contantes llamados a detener las masacres y la agresión contra el pueblo de Gaza. En la actividad, el jefe de la misión diplomática cubana en Beirut, Jorge León, transmitió condolencias a los familiares y amigos de los mártires palestinos y respaldó el legítimo derecho de defender sus tierras y enfrentar con decisión las prácticas criminales de Israel. A propósito, reafirmó el llamado a la comunidad internacional para asumir la responsabilidad de brindar protección al pueblo palestino, de conformidad con las resoluciones pertinentes de las Naciones Unidas, y presionar a Tel Aviv para detener la política de exterminio y genocidio. León advirtió del creciente deterioro de las condiciones económicas y sociales del pueblo palestino como consecuencia de las prácticas ilegales y la continua colonización de tierras en violación del derecho internacional humanitario. Ante los presentes, el diplomático ratificó que Cuba reconoce y agradece la solidaridad de los palestinos y libaneses en la lucha contra el bloqueo impuesto por Estados Unidos.",

    "title": "Talks offer a mirage",
    "text": "Reconciliatory efforts with the opposition are merely a mirage. There is apparently no seriousness in the government’s offer for talks with the PTI. Such an impression was squarely vindicated on Thursday as the former First Family failed to get any relief from the court of law, in a highly contested case of Iddat, which Islamic scholars and even critics believe is a tool employed for victimisation. The olive branch that was offered to the PTI on the floor of the house was, likewise, a half-hearted attempt intended at playing to the gallery as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif did not even mention the incarcerated PTI leader by his name. Perhaps that is why leader of the opposition Omer Ayub spurned the talks offer right away, saying it should come with instant release of all political prisoners, including Imran Khan.\nThe modus operandi is tantamount to one step forward, two steps back. While the PTI has not been too receptive in talking to the ruling dispensation, terming them as powerless, and hinting at a tete-a-tete with the powers-that-be, the stalemate has bred confusion and added to the political instability in the country. Thus, the onus is on the government to create a conducive environment for talks, and desist from time-buying tactics. The pace of executive response in the courts, ECP and district administrations is one of pushing the PTI to the wall, and this is acting as an impediment to making any dialogue process a success. That has to change for good if the ruling alliance is interested in ushering in political stability and to pull the economy out from a state of abyss. International lenders, friendly countries and credit-rating agencies are unanimous that the prevalent culture of confrontation will not breed in any confidence for kick-starting the economy.\nTime for the government to initiate unconditional talks with the opposition, and exhibit its sincerity by releasing all political prisoners. The open-ended concerns being aired on the malpractices in the general election by local and foreign elements do not bode well for the future of the country. There is no way out but to reconcile and address all the irritants in a negotiated manner.\nCOMMENTS\nComments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.\nFor more information, please see our\n[Comments FAQ](/comments-policy)",

Copy formatting. Content should be concise and formatted in a clear to follow format. A simple fix for this is removing ambiguous language and having a style guide that has the proper hierarchy (H1, H2, H3...Body); this not only enables visual readers to have a simpler experience but also makes it so screen readers and other assistive devices can parse out the experience.\nHaving a clear style guide that includes accessibility first content creation is a must to ensure an inclusive digital experience.\n2. Alternative description text for images. If an image is critical to the consumer understanding the content it needs to have alt text. This helps non visual + assistive device users have an equal opportunity to experience the design. Most CMS platforms/site builders have an alt/descriptive text field built in by default, so it is only the level of effort to enter the alternative description.\nThere are also alt text generators and integrations that help content creators with this process.\n3. Call to action buttons with unclear text like: Ok, Start, Request...Link buttons need to be able to stand on their own. Link text should tell the user what they are clicking or where they will go.\nExample: Do not write link text like “Click here.” Some people who use screen readers jump from link to link to scan a page and need to understand what a link contains.\nLink text should always be underlined so color blind users can see them.\n✔ Read this article about integrations.\n✘ Click here to learn more about integrations.\nAgain, adding rules like this to your style guide fosters inclusivity and consistency.\nLearning Opportunities\nWebinarJan17The Power of Composable ContentDiscover how composable content platforms revolutionize content creation and delivery.

Ensure minimum color contrast ratios are met for graphics and text. For text in particular, there are A LOT of companies that don't meet accessibility requirements. Having a style guide that defined text and text background color usage would be incredibly helpful.\nIn your view, what are the key rules businesses should follow to maintain\nbrand trust while leveraging AI in their digital marketing strategies?\n- Don't mislead your audience —\nBe transparent about authorship when using AI.\n- Never fake inclusion —\nDiversity and inclusiondemands authenticity.\n- Always incorporate human review — To ensure accuracy and brand consistency in any\ncontent creation.\n- Don’t glorify\nAI over human beings— The work we do to inform, influence, or entertain in digital marketing is still all about connecting with other humans.\nDAM Systems: Enhancing Diversity in Marketing\nHow can digital asset management systems be used to enhance diversity in marketing campaigns and make people feel more seen and represented?\n- Leveraging\nMetadatafor Inclusivity: DAM systems enable the use of metadata to ensure diverse representations. By tagging assets with detailed metadata, brands can actively track and promote inclusivity. For instance, a makeup brand can use metadata to ensure their models represent the entire spectrum of their foundation shades. Similarly, lifestyle brands can tag assets to reflect diverse family structures or relationships, like interracial families or LGBTQ+ couples. This metadata approach ensures that marketing campaigns are not only diverse but also accurately represent the target audience.\n- Asset Utilization Tracking: DAM systems provide insights into which assets are being used most frequently. By monitoring the download and usage patterns of diverse and inclusive assets, brands can understand the impact and appeal of these assets. This data helps in recognizing the value of diversity in their content and encourages the creation of more inclusive assets. It’s a way to gauge market response and adapt strategies accordingly.\n- Campaign Alignment and Tracking: Ensuring that each marketing campaign reflects diversity goals is crucial. DAM systems can help monitor if the inclusivity criteria set for campaigns are being met. This involves keeping assets up-to-date and aligning them with the current standards and expectations of diversity and inclusion. By analyzing how well these assets perform and resonate with the audience, brands can measure the success of their inclusivity efforts.\n- Compliance and Ethical Standards: DAMs can help ensure that all marketing materials comply with ethical standards and regulations related to diversity and representation. This is crucial in maintaining brand integrity and social responsibility.\nAI and Metadata: Enhancing Customer Experience\nCan you elaborate on how combining AI with metadata can create a winning strategy in customer experience management?\nAI can be used to create additional relevant metadata on assets to support what and how digital media is used to create a more\npersonalized and productive customer experience.\nAI's ability to garner and produce more accurate data, and metadata's ability to classify and organize information on digital assets, together create a powerful combination for helping marketers improve digital experiences at scale.\nWhat emerging trends do you foresee in the integration of\nAI in digital marketing, and how should marketers adapt to these changes?\nAI is or soon will be prevalent in all major marketing technology categories. The marketers that choose to experiment with AI now, and adopt AI for specific use cases, and begin to leverage its power to free up human time for more valuable tasks will begin to create a competitive advantage.\nJake Athey's 2023 Articles\n3 Ways DAMs Can Support Cult Brands 4 Principles for Accessible Web Design & Digital Experiences 4 Rules to Preserve Brand Trust When Using AI in Digital Marketing Diversity in Marketing: How DAM Systems Can Make People Feel Seen Combining AI in Customer Experience & Metadata for a Winning Strategy What Generative AI Means for Digital Asset Management Need to Get Scrappy?
