    "text": "[Lil Baby](/profile/lil-baby)'s Las Vegas trip did not go smoothly. The [rapper was arrested](/837555-lil-babys-arrest-new-details-hip-hop-news) after police suspected he had a concealed weapon on him. He got [combative with the police](/837824-lil-baby-vegas-arrest-footage-hip-hop-news), and asserted that he had a permit to carry before switching up and taunting them to perform a search. The footage of the incident made its way to TMZ. Lil Baby can be heard telling Las Vegas PD to search him well because he has a \"gun in his nuts.\" Now, his mugshot has been officially released to the public. He definitely looks like he's been through a long ordeal. Lil Baby's eyes are unmistakably bloodshot in the mugshot. The rapper looks both exhausted and angry. Both fair under the circumstances, however. Fans on Instagram flocked to the comment section with the usual mixture of jokes and dismay. One user claimed that the mugshot photographer did Lil Baby dirty with the angle. Another lamented the fact that everybody looks bad in a mugshot, regardless of appearance or wealth. \"Ion care how much money you got,\" they wrote. \"Them mugshot folks gon always make you look homeless..\" Read More: [Lil Baby Teases Sexyy Red Collab On The Way](/810172-lil-baby-sexyy-red-song-tease-hip-hop-news) Lil Baby's Attorney Claims He Has A Firearm Permit Despite his combativeness with the police, Lil Baby's attorney says that he was actually within his legal rights. David Chesnoff issued a statement to the Los Angeles Times stating that Lil Baby does, indeed, have a permit to carry a firearm. \"[He has] a valid Georgia Carrying a Concealed Weapon (CCW) Permit,\" the attorney wrote. \"On his behalf we are actively investigating the facts and circumstances surrounding his arrest in Las Vegas.\" This is not Baby's first rodeo. He was arrested for reckless driving back in 2019. Two years later, he was detained in France on suspicion of \"transporting drugs.\" CBS states that Baby was not officially arrested or charged during his detainment. He subsequently paid a fine. The rapper celebrated his freedom on Instagram the next day. \"Thank You To Everyone Who (Checked) On Me!! I'm Good,\" he wrote. \"I'm (On The Way) To The States To Rock My Show At The Pavilion At Pan Am In Indianapolis!!\" [ [via](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2024-08-27/rapper-lil-baby-arrested-las-vegas-gun-charge)]",

    "text": "Believe it or not, here comes some snow and wintry weather.\nSome regions of the Bay State were expected to see a bit of snow, ice and freezing rain early Saturday, as local meteorologists warned of hazardous road conditions.\nThe National Weather Service issued a “Winter Weather Advisory” for parts of central and western Massachusetts, especially for the higher terrain in the northern spots.\n“Anyone traveling early Saturday morning along Route 2, you’ll want to drive with caution,” Rob Megnia, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service’s Boston office, told the Herald.\nThe freezing rain, along with ice, is more of a concern than the minor snow accumulations.\nIce accumulation of a few hundredths of an inch to a tenth will likely lead to dangerous travel.\n“Precipitation will initially spread from west to east as snow, before transitioning to a wintry mix of rain, freezing rain, sleet, and snow, and ultimately to all rain,” NWS wrote in its winter weather advisory. “Sheltered valleys may see a later transition to rain and higher accumulations of ice and snow.”\n“Plan on slippery road conditions… Slow down and use caution while traveling,” NWS added.\nRelated Articles Weather | Get Jim Cantore to Massachusetts: Thundersnow reported amid ‘epic snow squall action’ Weather | Snow?!

Forecasters are predicting heavy rain — with widespread totals of 2 to 3 inches, and locally higher amounts possible.\nThe heavy rain could spark flooding.\n“It’s going to be a pretty significant rain storm,” Megnia said. “A complete washout.”\nThe National Weather Service issued a “Flood Watch” for much of the region. The heaviest rain should occur Saturday afternoon and evening, which may lead to urban and poor drainage street flooding, as well as sharp rises on rivers and streams. Some river flooding is possible.\n“Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared to take action should flooding develop,” NWS warned.\nWhile not a primary hazard, gusty southeast winds will be likely Saturday afternoon into Sunday morning. Wind gusts of 30 to 40 mph are possible.\nMeanwhile up north, the National Weather Service has issued a “Winter Storm Watch” for parts of New Hampshire and Maine, where more than 6 inches of snow will be possible.\nNWS warned, “Periods of moderate and heavy snow will combine with low visibility to create dangerous driving conditions.”\nFollowing Saturday’s storm, Sunday should be dry across Massachusetts, but it’s expected to be quite windy especially along the coast. Forecasters are predicting 40 to 50 mph wind gusts along Cape Cod, and even stronger winds up to 55 mph will be possible on Nantucket.",

    "text": "Gaza: New Israeli Orders Force Thousands in Deir al-Balah to Flee Again, and Disrupt Last Aid Hub\nRAMALLAH (August 22, 2024)—New displacement orders issued by Israeli authorities have forced another mass movement of families and humanitarian workers from areas in Deir al-Balah—one of the only remaining areas in the occupied\nGaza Strip with essential infrastructure and warehouses storing aid supplies.\nMany Palestinian families, already forcibly displaced countless times since October, are on the move yet again, including humanitarian workers critical to providing the limited aid response that is still possible.\nAt least 24 NGOs have reported impacts from orders in the past week resulting in the forced displacement of staff members, operations disrupted, and at least one site sheltering civilians under attack. Warehouses storing supplies are located within the sblocks that have come under orders that are resulting in forcible displacement.\nSo-called “evacuation” orders issued by Israeli authorities on 13, 15, 16 and 21 of August continue to obstruct aid operations, affecting a number of agencies including Save the Children, Mercy Corps, the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), MSF, Solidarités International, Medical Aid for Palestinians, Oxfam, Humanity & Inclusion, Action Against Hunger, Islamic Relief, Project HOPE, DanChurchAid and Norwegian Church Aid and partners, and Palestinian partners of ActionAid, War Child, Danish Refugee Council, Médicos del Mundo, Middle East Children’s Alliance and WeWorld.\nA shelter belonging to ANERA has come under fire, while NRC has waited more than 15 days for the Israeli authorities to respond to a request to deconflict an area where they seek to relocate staff following Israel’s latest displacement order.\nThe UN\nsaid that multiple orders issued by Israeli forces in Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah between 8 and 17 August impacted 17 health facilities, including five primary healthcare centers and nine medical points, disrupting essential health services. Disruptions will also threaten the ability to administer critically needed polio vaccines once they arrive in Gaza.\nCommunities are cut off from vital aid, as suppliers who deliver essential items like water face challenges reaching locations close to the areas which people have been ordered to leave.\nHumanitarian actors must be allowed to deliver aid based on need rather than the designation of safe areas by a party to the conflict.\n“Even if Israeli authorities let polio vaccines in, with the biggest responders in Gaza constantly pin-balled from one place to the next, how can we deliver an effective campaign and reach the children in dire need of that protection? If you want to understand the access situation, this is it—not the trickle of trucks exceptionally allowed to enter,” said Jeremy Stoner, Save the Children Regional Director for the Middle East.\n“Palestinians in Gaza have been relentlessly uprooted, forced from one so-called 'safe' area to the next, enduring unimaginable hardship and loss. Among them are brave humanitarian workers who risk their lives every day to save others. Our ability to provide meaningful aid in any part of Gaza does not meet our ambitions, let alone the overwhelming needs. Deir al-Balah, once declared a humanitarian zone, is now under attack with bombardment at our doorstep,” said Sally Abi Khalil, Oxfam’s Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa.\n“We are a humanitarian organization, trying to deliver humanitarian services in what Israel had unilaterally declared a ‘humanitarian zone.’ These conditions don’t just punish us, they impact civilians in desperate need of assistance,” said Suze van Meegen, NRC’s acting Country Director in Palestine.\n“The situation has become incredibly dangerous. There's constant fighting, and the sounds of shelling and explosions are clearly audible. Skin diseases are spreading rapidly. We’re all becoming paranoid that we’ll get infected. The physical toll is real. I’ve been having severe stomach pains, likely from the contaminated water we’re forced to drink. I don’t know how much longer we can survive like this,\" said Lena*, Mercy Corps staff member in Gaza.\nFor more than 10 months, humanitarian organizations have called for an immediate and sustained ceasefire. Now the looming risk of a polio outbreak and urgent need to vaccinate children in Gaza makes this more urgent than ever.\nAll parties to conflict have an obligation to facilitate humanitarian access at all times. Israel as the occupying power is obligated to ensure that the humanitarian needs of the occupied population are met. This includes facilitating humanitarian aid and creating conditions that enable the safe provision of supplies, and has been ordered by the International Court of Justice in its provisional measures of 26 January and 24 May.\nRafah served as the main hub for Gaza’s strained aid operations until early May, when Israeli forces expanded their ground operations there. Aid agencies were forced to move their operations to Deir al-Balah. With northern Gaza decimated, southern Gaza largely inaccessible, civilians and aid workers, and critically needed humanitarian operations, now have nowhere left to go.\n###\nEditor’s Note\n• The Israeli designated “humanitarian zone” now encompasses less than 11 percent of Gaza, according to the UN.\n• Civilians who are unable or unwilling to leave their homes remain protected under international humanitarian law.\nSigned on\n1.

    "text": "We stand united in the pursuit of justice and sovereignty for the resilient people of Haiti. History has repeatedly witnessed the detrimental impact of foreign interventions on Haiti, from Napoleon's attempt to reinstate slavery in 1802 to the U.S. invasion in 1915, which resulted in the theft of Haiti's gold reserve and the imposition of racial segregation. More recently, the introduction of cholera by UN troops after the 2010 earthquake claimed the lives of 30,000 Haitians. Now, there's a concerning proposal to deploy Kenyan troops to Haiti to address gang-related issues. The recent expulsion of these same troops from the Democratic Republic of Congo due to collusion with gangs raises alarming red flags. We adamantly reject any foreign military presence in Haiti and, instead, call for support in empowering the Haitian military and BSAP and the national police force to address domestic challenges. Our petition implores the international community to heed the lessons of history, respect Haiti's sovereignty, and refrain from actions that may inadvertently harm the very people they aim to assist. Together, let us champion a future for Haiti that is free from external interventions, allowing the nation to chart its course towards self-determination and prosperity.",

In reality, it encompasses a timeless and universal philosophy that promotes individual strength, harmony and an inclusive ecosystem. Its teachings emphasize the importance of inner peace, spiritual growth and the interconnectedness of all beings. By promoting these values, it seeks to create a world where diverse cultures can unite under a common platform of mutual respect and understanding. I am committed to taking this message of peace and unity to audiences around the world\".\nPaudwal's illustrious career spans over 50 years, during which she has received numerous accolades for her contributions to Indian music and spirituality.

New Delhi: The government expects the Indian economy's GDP growth rate in 2023-24 to \"comfortably\" exceed its forecast of 6.5 percent despite the risks to growth and stability outlook that mainly emanate from outside the country, according to the Finance Ministry's half-yearly economic review report, released on Friday. The better-than-expected growth in Q2 of 2023-24 and the emergence of India as the fastest-growing major economy in H1 of FY24 have improved the growth prospects and prompted various domestic and international agencies to upgrade GDP growth projections for FY24. The momentum gained in Q2 of FY24 is likely to be sustained in Q3 as well. High frequency indicators in India for October and November 2023 reflect robust economic activity. PMI Manufacturing and Services remained in the expansionary zone in October and November. October 2023 imprints of the IIP and Index of Eight Core Industries also highlight sustained growth in manufacturing activity, the report points out. Sentiments in the services sector remain upbeat, driven, among others, by an upswing in the tourism cum hotel industry induced by leisure travel, business travel, and social events. Growth in consumption demand is expected to be sustained. Urban demand conditions remain resilient, with higher growth in auto sales, fuel consumption and UPI transactions. Rural demand is also catching up, as reflected in robust growth in two and three-wheeler sales, it adds. On the inflation front, with the stable downward movement in core inflation and continuing deflation in fuel inflation, the headline inflation outlook is on a declining trend, notwithstanding temporary disruptions from food prices. RBI has projected inflation to average at 5.4 per cent in FY24. The outlook for India's external sector is promising, as seen in the November releases of trade balances for both services and merchandise. The relatively stable Indian rupee against the US dollar and other prominent currencies and adequate foreign exchange reserves add to the optimism. This sanguinity is visible in the resurgence of foreign portfolio investments since November 2023 and in FY24 in general, compared to FY23. Foreign investment inflows are also helping the Indian stock market indices to climb new heights, reflecting broad-based optimism on growth among domestic and foreign investors on growth prospects, according to the report.",

Ele recebeu um passe de Fernandinho e bateu firme para vencer o goleiro adversário. O Bahia tentou algumas respostas em contra-ataques, mas sem gerar perigo à meta mineira.\nNa segunda etapa, o tom da partida continuou o mesmo. Os baianos até tentavam agredir o Cruzeiro, mas sem efetividade, enquanto que a Raposa demonstrou todo o poderio ofensivo.\nAos 34 minutos, Marcelo acionou Cauan Baptistella, que encontrou Nicolas, pelo lado direito do ataque. Ele bateu sem dar chances para o goleiro tricolor e ampliou a vantagem. Já no fim da partida, aos 40 minutos, Fernando fechou a conta com um golaço de letra.\nCom a vitória, o Cruzeiro despacha o Bahia e segue vivo na luta pelo título da Copa São Paulo de Futebol Júnior.
