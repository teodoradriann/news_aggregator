More content below BYND TSN WMT MAT MCD YUM TGT\nCooking up change in a well-entrenched, well-capitalized industry isn't easy.\nSuch is the story of the ticker symbol BYND, formally known down supermarket aisles across America as Beyond Meat ( BYND ).\nWhile the price of Beyond Meat stock has changed over the years, its CEO and founder Ethan Brown hasn’t. The basketball-loving former fuel cell industry exec remains laser-focused on taking the company he founded in 2009 with his own savings to the next level.\n\"We believe the arc of history is on our side and that we're going to make this thing into the long-term success that we've been after,\" Brown said on the latest episode of Yahoo Finance's Lead This Way (video above).\nBeyond Meat CEO Ethan Brown spoke to Yahoo Finance about the plant-based business. Beyond Meat burst onto investors' radar on May 5, 2019, with a sizzling initial public offering on the Nasdaq.\nInvestors devoured shares of a company they saw as the leader in the budding plant-based food movement. The company priced its IPO at $25 a share, opened for trading at $46, and then surged to $65.75 by the close. The gain when that closing bell sounded: a tasty 163%.\nBeyond Meat CEO Ethan Brown celebrates with guests after ringing the opening bell at Nasdaq MarketSite, May 2, 2019, in New York City. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) (Drew Angerer via Getty Images) From there, it was a whirlwind of activity for Beyond Meat and Brown, with big deals with global restaurant chains such as Yum! Brands-owned KFC and Dunkin’ Donuts ( YUM ), expansion plans into the refrigerated food sections at Target ( TGT ) and retailers overseas, and efforts underway to expand manufacturing capacity and create new plant-based items.\nBy July 2019, shares of Beyond Meat hit a peak of $234.90 a share.\nHowever, the COVID-19 pandemic hammered the restaurant industry, and its financial toll sent people back to cheaper meat-based items at supermarkets. Beyond Meat’s impressive momentum stalled along with the rest of the plant-based food movement, including at rival Impossible Foods .\nAlong the way, attacks from entrenched parties in the meat industry and media on the healthiness of plant-based items hurt Beyond Meat’s standing with consumers. By November 2022, with losses eating into cash flow, the company was forced to lay off 19% of its workforce.\nStory continues Then in November of this year, Beyond Meat — which has cut prices to stimulate demand — said it would slash 19% of its non-production workforce after a softer-than-expected third quarter.\nThird quarter sales fell 8.7% from the prior year to $75.3 million. The company lost $57.5 million on an adjusted operating profit basis.\n\"You know that there's going to be resistance to change, and maybe early on we felt that when we first launched, and particularly after the IPO, that it was going to happen overnight,\" Brown told Yahoo Finance several months before the latest round of layoffs. \"That obviously has not proven to be the case.\"\nThree leadership tips from Beyond Meat CEO Ethan Brown: Surround yourself with great people, have that long-term view, and find your true north and stay the course. \"But the very reason that we started this company and the very reason that consumers are reaching for a product strengthens every single day, whether it's the health angle, whether it's climate, whether it's the energy and water use or animal welfare,\" Brown continued. \"All of those issues are intensifying, and we have a solution that is available to anyone who wants it.\"\nToday, Beyond Meat stock trades at $8.95 a share — well off its dizzying post-IPO heights. The company's market cap is $577.6 million compared to $18.46 billion for meat king Tyson ( TSN ), per Yahoo Finance comparison data .\n\"In terms of what’s driving the US softness, it’s more of the same: Consumers just continue to shy away from the category for a variety of reasons, including taste and perceived health benefits (or the lack thereof),\" JPMorgan packaged food analyst Ken Goldman said.\nGoldman rates Beyond Meat shares Underweight, the equivalent of a Sell rating.\nYahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi (left) chats with Beyond Meat founder and CEO Ethan Brown (right) about the path forward for the plant-based meat company inside its new El Segundo, Calif., headquarters. (Yahoo Finance) Meanwhile, Brown remains focused on defying the critics. Beyond Meat has recently opened a sprawling 288,000-square-foot headquarters in a former aircraft hangar in El Segundo, Calif., steps away from the HQ of Barbie maker Mattel ( MAT ). The location is outfitted with a state-of-the-art test kitchen and a generally open floor plan that may foster the next big thing in plant-based food.\nThe new facility even has a McDonald’s ( MCD ) themed test kitchen where the company focuses on cooking up potential new items for the Golden Arches.\nThe 6-foot-5 Brown has a corner office with his KPIs (key performance indicators) on the outside wall to encourage employee discussion. Brown often makes the rounds in the building to chat up employees with his trademark cool, welcoming vibe.\nBrown acknowledged that the road ahead won’t be easy and he isn't yet in the mindset to reflect on the path of the business to this point. But he will not be deterred in his personal mission to do good for the planet by leading with heart and hustle.\n\"I have to see [my mission] through to completion,\" Brown said. \"I think it'll be something [that] when it's said and done, I might look back. But right now I'm in the fight, so it's hard to see.\"\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor. Follow Sozzi on Twitter/X @BrianSozzi and on LinkedIn .

    "text": "Can't find what you're looking for?\nCan't find what you're looking for?\nToo many Indonesian young people remain undertrained and underutilized for an economy striving for higher productivity.\narly in his term, President Prabowo Subianto's administration is facing the harsh economic realities impacting many Indonesians. In the first quarter of this year alone, over 24,000 people lost their jobs. Many who attended job fairs left empty-handed, as vacancies were filled quickly or available roles did not match their skills. Even the gig economy, once a safety net for millions, including ojol (app-based ride-hailing motorcycle taxi) drivers, is no longer as promising.\nBeneath these immediate labor woes lies a more profound concern. According to Statistics Indonesia (BPS) 2020 census data, an estimated 40-45 percent of Millennials and Gen Z, who will make up nearly two-thirds of the electorate by 2029, have not completed high school. Without deliberate reforms and sustained investment, the ambitious Golden Indonesia Vision 2045 risks becoming a distant mirage.\nA concerted, nationwide lifelong learning strategy is urgently needed. This is not about fragmented policies addressing immediate problems but a systemic approach that bridges current gaps with future aspirations.\nStanding on the promise of Asta Cita, Prabowo is charting a bold course marked by tighter political, administrative and fiscal centralization. His administration aims to streamline governance and renew focus on nationwide development, as reflected in the unfolding Mid-term National Development Plan (RPJMN) 2025–2029.\nHowever, beneath this coherent top-down blueprint lies a widening gulf, particularly between the more educated, connected and urban populations and the larger mass of Indonesia's rural and peri-urban youth. Too many of these young people remain undertrained and underutilized for an economy striving for higher productivity. This divide is not abstract, most live outside main economic centers and have exited formal schooling without ever entering the modern economy.\nWhile the RPJMN acknowledges the importance of human capital and vocational training, it misses a crucial element: A nationwide, sustained and locally driven system of lifelong learning. This is not just an educational shortfall, it is a structural fault line.\nWithout credible and accessible pathways back into learning and training, this group risks being sidelined both economically and developmentally. This risk is compounded by Indonesia's continuously evolving central-regional governance.\nShare your experiences, suggestions, and any issues you've encountered on The Jakarta Post.

    "title": "Here’s What You Need To Know About Drinking Water Before Bed (Without Midnight Bathroom Runs!)",
    "text": "As a kid, you might have gotten banned from even thinking about a glass of water before bed. Now that you’re well in control of your bladder, do you still avoid a drink before you hit the sheets?\nDrinking water before bed can feel like a tug of war between running to the bathroom in the middle of the night and going to bed thirsty with a scratchy tongue and dry, cracked lips.\nThe fact of the matter is, your body needs water — it helps you regulate your temperature, cushion your joints, protect sensitive tissues, and get rid of waste products through sweat and anything that goes in the toilet. (\n1)\nWhile that’s easy enough to understand, there’s still the issue of late-night glasses of water leading to middle-of-the-night wakeups. Drinking water before bed involves a bit of a balancing act, and we want to help you figure out just what you need.\nHow Drinking Water Before Bed Affects Sleep\nThe effects of drinking water before bed depend a lot on timing and quantity you’re drinking. Are you chugging a half-gallon right before your head hits the pillow? Or, on the other end of the extreme spectrum, do you cut off all liquids many hours before bedtime?\nDrinking water before bed can keep you from getting dehydrated, which happens when your body gets rid of fluid faster than you take it in. ( 2) Dehydration can cause headaches, irritability, and dry mouth — none of which lend themselves to a great night of sleep. ( 2)\nOn the other hand, extra water too close to lights out can have you up all night needing to pee. Even though your body slows down your urine factory during sleeping hours, you can overload that system. In those cases, your body will wake you up for a trip to the bathroom, which disrupts your\nsleep cycles. ( 3)\nExperts can’t say for sure how much dehydration affects sleep, though one small study of 12 young men found no connection between hydration status and a good night’s rest. (\n4) Overall, it’s best not to panic if you’re feeling a little quenched — mild dehydration shouldn’t wreak havoc on your sleep.\nLet’s dig into the details here and look at the benefits and drawbacks to your pre-bed water game.\nThe Benefits of Drinking Water Before Bed\nSipping water before you climb into bed can help your body and your snoozing in a couple different ways. First off, it can help you sleep longer. One older study of adults found that hydrated people are much more likely to sleep eight hours than dehydrated sleepers. (\n5)\n“Sleeping [itself] is a dehydrating activity, because for seven or eight hours, you’re breathing without taking in any fluid,” says Dr. Audrey Wells, MD, sleep expert and founder of\nSuper Sleep MD. So when you drink water before bed, Wells adds, you can lessen the chances of starting the night off dehydrated.\nYour\nhydration status also has a big effect on a hormonal system that helps your body know when to hold on to water and when to get rid of it. This system closely links to another hormone that is connected to your circadian rhythm. When you get enough to drink before bed, these hormonal dancing partners can stay in sync, leading to better sleep for you. ( 5) ( 6)\nThere isn’t yet a general consensus among experts on how much water you should drink daily, mainly because many of the foods we eat contain fluid, too. (\n1) But in general, the recommendation is 6 to 12 cups per day. ( 7)\nPotential Drawbacks to Drinking Water Before Bed\nThe benefits of drinking enough water before bed seem to close the book on this case, but you can overdo your pre-sleep water intake.\nNocturia\nWhen your system gets too water-logged, you have to get up throughout the night to urinate. When this happens regularly, it’s called\nnocturia. ( 3)\nOnce you’re up, you may find it tricky to get back to sleep, says Wells, who recommends staying hydrated throughout the day to avoid the need for a lot of water at bedtime.\nIf your frequent nighttime trips to the bathroom are caused by too much water before bed, you can try lowering your intake. But keep in mind, peeing through the night can have other causes, too, like a bladder infection, enlarged prostate gland, or other chronic health conditions. (\n3)\nBe sure to let your healthcare provider know if you’re running to the bathroom a couple times every night — they should be able to help you get to the bottom of it.\nBedwetting\nMost kids can’t control their bladders until about age five, and even then, too much water in their nighttime routine can mean wet diapers and sodden sheets. (\n8) When they wet the bed more than twice a month after age six, it’s officially called bedwetting, or nocturnal enuresis. ( 9)\nIn adults, bedwetting usually has a medical reason. (\n8) Your healthcare provider can help you figure out what’s going on and get the right treatment.\nHow to Start Drinking Water Before Bed (and Hopefully Avoid Trips to the Bathroom!)\nYou don’t want to end up dehydrated, but you also don’t want to make lots of trips to the toilet in the wee hours. So, what’s your perfect hydration balance? Everyone will have a slightly different tolerance for fluids while they sleep, says Wells, so you may need to try a few things to find what works for you.\n“I recommend stopping fluid intake one to three hours before bed, depending on your hydration status and your tolerance for nighttime awakenings,” says Wells. She says sticking to sips of water in the hours before bed will help keep your bladder empty all night.\nThese recommendations might feel overwhelming, but remember — the best health changes are adopted gradually, so don’t feel like you have to jump right to your hydration goal. Ease into this new routine bit by bit, and soon it will feel like second nature.\nAlternatives to Water\nIf you’re not used to water, the idea of drinking more may sound like a real bummer. Water’s great because it has no calories, added chemicals, or sugar. But if you can’t stomach the thought of so much H2O, you have some other options.\nAs alternatives to water, Wells suggests herbal teas with minimal to no caffeine, like green tea. “Some people can tolerate decaf coffee,” Wells says, but cautions that it will still contain some caffeine. “Sports drinks can be ok, but you’re going to get a little extra sugar with that and also get electrolytes.”\nElectrolytes can help your body hold on to water, Wells says, but this can also lead to puffy eyes in the morning because of how electrolytes affect fluid balance. (\n11) You can also plan on incorporating some more liquid-dense foods into your diet.\nHow you hydrate is a personal choice, so feel free to try a few options to find what works best for you.\nFAQs\nWhen should I stop drinking water before bed?\n“I recommend stopping fluid intake one to three hours before bed, depending on your hydration status and your tolerance for nighttime awakenings,” says Wells.\nThe Last Word From Sleepopolis\nYour body thrives when you stay hydrated, and drinking a little water before bed can keep away pesky symptoms of dehydration and help you sleep better all night. Just be careful not to overdo it, or you’ll be running to the bathroom all night. Experiment with different water amounts and healthy water alternatives and enjoy some hydrated sleep!\nSources\n- Water and Healthier Drinks | Healthy Weight, Nutrition, and Physical Activity | CDC.

    "text": "Owing to our religiosity, sunny disposition and resilient nature, most of us are predisposed to welcome 2024 with much optimism. The poll results from Pulse Asia and Social Weather Stations (SWS) show that a majority does not fear the coming New Year. Never mind that most respondents surveyed by Pulse Asia anticipated a less prosperous Christmas 2023. An earlier SWS survey disclosed that the quality of life worsened for 30 percent of Filipinos in the past 12 months.\nAnother polling firm, Publicus Asia, reported that most people believe that the administration of President Bongbong Marcos Jr. should focus on the economy and the problem of inflation. These are the country’s most pressing macroeconomic issues, according to 15 percent of the respondents. They also want the government to address corruption (12 percent) and poverty (9 percent). On a micro-scale, the public is most anxious about finding employment (14 percent), affordability of basic needs and fear of losing a job (12 percent). In terms of public safety concerns, nine out of 10 Filipinos are worried about the rising criminality and illegal drug use in communities. For the public, economic challenges are interconnected with safety concerns.\nIt seems the Marcos government has their work cut out for them in 2024. Provided that our leaders listen to the sentiments of our kababayans. It is also evident that domestic politics and external security threats, such as the West Philippine Sea (WPS) conflict, rank low on the people’s concerns. Daily survival and improving living conditions are always at the top of their priorities. And regardless if they weigh in on major issues from time to time.\nSumming up Tumultuous. That is the Philippine political scene in 2023. The WPS issue, the widening rift among UniTeam’s pillars, the inflation problem, the assassination of Negros Oriental Governor Roel Degamo and the release of former senator Leila de Lima from detention dominated the national conversation. I will focus on two issues.\nThe year began with the successful state visit of PBBM to China, wherein he discussed the peaceful resolution of the WPS conflict with President Xi Jinping. Days after, the China Coast Guard (CCG) drove away Filipino fishers at the Ayungin Shoal. The CCG continued to attack government and private vessels with water cannons, military-grade lasers and blockades. From then on, the bilateral relations between our nations have gone further south.\nAmerica, the country’s Big Brother, finally broke its non-interference policy on conflicting claims to territories. In May, US President Joe Biden declared his country’s ironclad commitment to defend the Philippines against China. For now, I see this as an empty promise. Where was America when we lost the Panganiban Reef in 1995 and Panatag Shoal in 2012 to the erstwhile Middle Kingdom? Since then, what has the United States done to stop the Asian superpower from bullying us? Threatened by China’s increasing economic and military might, their leaders are suddenly invoking the Mutual Defense Treaty. In my view, the US does not believe the Philippine sovereign claims to the disputed WPS features. America is merely exploiting the sorry state of our military defense relative to the WPS conflict to curtail China’s ascendancy in the Indo-Pacific. Very simply, the US wants to impose its hegemonic influence in the region.\nOur history with China through the centuries and before our colonization is one of peaceful trade and cooperation. Historically, we never had any military conflict with the superpower. During the time of president Rodrigo Duterte, we were able to maintain friendly ties with both China and the US. Why must we change the status quo to accommodate America’s vested interests? Unfortunately, I heard that the President has been receiving advice from a public relations professional with strong links with the US embassy. Thus, the balance has increasingly tilted in Uncle Sam’s favor. For our national economic interest, I urge the government to continue forging closer relations with China so that we can benefit from the country’s prosperity and development.\nAnother major controversy is the internal squabbling within the UniTeam alliance. The rift between Vice President Sara Duterte and House Speaker Martin Romualdez seems irreconcilable at this point. The root cause: the Lower House leadership removed former president and current Pampanga Representative Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo as senior deputy speaker.\nAccording to my sources, Romualdez accused GMA of possessing Articles of Impeachment against PBBM, who was then concurrent head of the Department of Agriculture. It is related to the controversial Sugar Order (SO) No. 6, which became the subject of my Feb. 25 column. I wrote that the government allowed the entry of 450,000 metric tons of imported sugar to our shores sans a sugar order; favored three importers that were pre-selected in January and breached the selection process of allocation to importers. I have copies of the letters submitted by the said companies to the President through the office of Speaker Romualdez. The seasoned politician that she is, GMA would not try to unseat a popular chief executive. Further, PBBM has referred to Arroyo as his “secret weapon” in several official overseas trips. I also believe her assertion that she is not interested in becoming Speaker again. Therefore, GMA was unjustly accused and stripped of her previous post.\nAs a result of the Lower House drama, Inday Sara resigned as Lakas-CMD party chair and member. She also dropped the infamous “tambaloslos” word, which incensed Martin and his followers. As payback, the Lower House disapproved Sara’s confidential fund request for the Office of the Vice President and Department of Education. As early as September, impeachment rumors against the VP became rife in Congress. Later on, two congressmen sponsored resolutions calling on the Executive to cooperate with the International Criminal Court (ICC) investigation of the drug war campaign. The representatives of the alleged victims have accused FPRRD and Inday Sara of complicity with the extralegal killings of individuals linked to illegal drugs.\nPreviously, I disclosed that PBBM is seriously considering cooperating with the ICC Prosecutor. Apparently, he was dismayed by allegations that FPRRD and retired military generals were plotting to remove him from power. In my opinion, the story is pure hogwash. Digong knows that if the military stages a coup d’etat, there will be extraconstitutional changes in the government. Both the President and VP Sara would lose their mandate. Why would a former president willingly destroy a nation he painstakingly brought to greater socio-economic heights? Would a loving father destroy the political career of his favorite daughter?\nThe state of Philippine politics in 2023 is both saddening and maddening. I wish 2024 will be a year of understanding, healing and reconciliation for the nation. A prosperous New Year to us all!",

    "text": "Jordan Bardella, à gauche, Olivier Faure au centre et Gabriel Attal à droite lors d&#039;un débat sur France 2 le 27 juin 2024, à Paris Le président du Rassemblement national, Jordan Bardella, a assuré jeudi qu&#039;il ne laisserait pas &quot;l&#039;impérialisme russe absorber un État allié comme l&#039;Ukraine&quot; tout en répétant qu&#039;il refuserait l&#039;envoi de soldat français sur le sol ukrainien s&#039;il devenait Premier ministre à l&#039;issue des élections législatives. &quot;Ma position est très simple sur ce conflit (...) Elle n&#039;a jamais varié. C&#039;est celle d&#039;un soutien à l&#039;Ukraine et d&#039;éviter une escalade avec la Russie qui est, je le rappelle, une puissance nucléaire&quot;, a déclaré le leader d&#039;extrême droite lors du dernier débat télévisé avec le Premier ministre Gabriel Attal et le socialiste Olivier Faure. Interrogé sur les propos de Marine Le Pen qui a estimé la veille que le rôle de chef des armées pour le président de la République se réduit à un &quot;titre honorifique&quot;, Jordan Bardella, candidat pour Matignon si le RN obtient la majorité absolue à l&#039;issue des législatives, n&#039;a pas reculé. &quot;C&#039;est le Premier ministre qui décide du budget de fonctionnement des armées&quot;, a-t-il martelé. Une position qu&#039;a vivement dénoncé Gabriel Attal: &quot;Derrière le +titre honorifique+, il y a l&#039;idée que le président de la République ne serait plus en mesure de prendre de décisions&quot;, s&#039;est-il alarmé. &quot;Si le Rassemblement national venait à gagner cette élection, il y aurait une forme de dispute entre le Premier ministre et le président de la République pour savoir à qui a le rôle de chef des armées&quot;, a-t-il ajouté. &quot;C&#039;est un message envoyé aux puissances mondiales, au monde entier, qui est un message très grave pour la sécurité des Français.&quot; Pour Olivier Faure, les propos de Marine Le Pen montrent que l&#039;extrême droite cherche à &quot;prendre le pas sur les institutions&quot;. Jordan Bardella veut &quot;tout prendre&quot;, a-t-il accusé. Le président du RN s&#039;est aussi dit de nouveau opposé à l&#039;envoi de missiles longue portée qui pourraient frapper directement le territoire russe. Cela pourrait &quot;placer la France et les Français dans une situation de cobelligérance&quot;, a-t-il déclaré. Le premier secrétaire du parti socialiste s&#039;est dit, au contraire, &quot;favorable&quot; à l&#039;envoi de missiles s&#039;ils &quot;permettent de viser sur le sol russe des infrastructures qui servent à bombarder le sol ukrainien&quot;. De son côté, Gabriel Attal, qui mène la campagne pour le camp présidentiel, a répété qu&#039;il fallait soutenir les Ukrainiens à la fois &quot;parce qu&#039;ils défendent des valeurs qui sont les nôtres: la démocratie, la liberté&quot; et &quot;parce qu&#039;en les soutenant, on défend aussi les Français et leur quotidien&quot;. sde-Dt/gbh/gvy",

    "title": "Jefe de Defensa alemán considera que el conflicto en Ucrania ha llegado a un punto muerto",
    "text": "Berlín, 25 ene (Sputnik).- El ministro alemán de Defensa, Boris Pistorius, declaró en una entrevista al periódico Bild que, desde su punto de vista, el conflicto armado en Ucrania ha llegado a un punto muerto y ambas partes no pueden avanzar. «La situación ha llegado a un punto muerto. No hay avances por ninguna de las partes. Pero los ucranianos siguen defendiéndose con mucho éxito en el sur y el este del país», aseguró el ministro. Destacó que la situación en el frente para Ucrania no es tan mala como muchos la han descrito recientemente. Al mismo tiempo, Pistorius dijo que tiene cuidado en sus previsiones sobre el desarrollo del conflicto. El pasado 26 de diciembre, el ministro de Defensa ruso, Serguéi Shoigú, aseguró que las tropas rusas en 2023 lograron frustrar la contraofensiva ucraniana gracias a la creación de un sistema eficaz de líneas defensivas, la alta capacidad de combate de todas las unidades, la fiabilidad de los equipos militares y las acciones decisivas de los combatientes. Rusia continúa desde el 24 de febrero de 2022 una operación militar especial en Ucrania cuyos objetivos, según el presidente ruso, Vladímir Putin, son proteger a la población de «un genocidio por parte del régimen de Kiev» y atajar los riesgos de seguridad nacional que representa el avance de la OTAN hacia el este. Hasta la fecha, Ucrania ha condicionado el cese de las hostilidades a la recuperación de todos los territorios, incluida Crimea, que se unió a Rusia en marzo de 2014. El conflicto de Ucrania, según el Kremlin, puede avanzar hacia una solución política siempre y cuando se tengan en cuenta la situación de facto y la nueva realidad territorial. La última ronda de conversaciones entre Moscú y Kiev para lograr un acuerdo de fin de las hostilidades, tuvo lugar el 29 de marzo de 2022 en la ciudad turca de Estambul, y desde entonces los países no han vuelto a retomarlas. Moscú en repetidas ocasiones se declaró dispuesto a reanudar el proceso negociador con Kiev, pero lo condicionó a la cancelación del decreto ucraniano que prohíbe retomar las negociaciones con Rusia.

    "title": "Air Taxi Funding Has Stalled Over Europe — Here’s Why",
    "text": "Europe's eVTOL flying taxi leaders are burning through cash — and investors aren't rushing to fill the gap.\nSo-called flying taxis are better known as eVTOLs, or electric vertical take off and landing aircraft, and have been hovering on the horizon to disrupt urban air mobility for years — pending certification of course.\nBut three of the biggest European players have hit financial woes of late . British Vertical Aerospace lost a key supplier, revealed net losses had climbed 45% to $17m in its latest round of annual results, and admitted it was seeking new investment — though there has been good news, with an untethered, piloted test of its VX4 aircraft.\nGerman startup Lilium has burned through more than $1.5bn as it seeks to design an electric, vertical take-off and landing aircraft, but the German government refused a loan guarantee, sending the company into insolvency.\nFellow German firm Volocopoter also attempted to borrow from the government, failing to pin down the requested €100m, instead reportedly turning to China's Geely — which could see the manufacturing shift to China. It's since brought in a new CFO — former Lilium staffer Oliver Vogelgesang — and admitted its type certification will take until next year.\nSource of European eVTOL woes Why is it proving so difficult to get finance for eVTOL companies? Sergio Cecutta, an analyst at SMG Consulting, says it's no coincidence, and there's a simple main answer: there's not enough money sloshing around Europe. \"Raising capital in Europe, it's more difficult than raising capital in the US or China,\" he tells me.\nAfter all, American rivals Archer Aviation and Joby Aviation have no trouble raising funds — no wonder when both companies are soaring past test flight and certification milestones, appearing increasingly ready to launch commercial services imminently, though work remains.\nCecutta says the three European companies have come on far enough in their development that they've started to \"experience some of the pains of aerospace programs that some US manufacturers or other manufacturers have not experienced yet.\"\nHe points to Volocopter, which this summer failed to get necessary motors delivered to produce its aircraft and finish certification after Rolls-Royce pulled out of the market. That's just life in aerospace, Cecutta suggested, but it can be enough to derail a startup that doesn't have the deep pockets of more established companies.\nAnd developing an eVTOL is an expensive prospect. Cecutta says it's likely $1.5bn to $2bn just to get fully certified, and there will be further costs to setting up an operational business. That's exacerbated by the complexity of the designs and components, given the reliance on the development of batteries that aren't yet available.\nThe lack of money available to even the big players in Europe suggests tougher times ahead for newer entrants to the market. \"One of the trends we've seen is money going to the companies that already have money — it's normal and typical in the startup sector to continue to fund the companies that have already accomplished certain progress,\" Cecutta says. \"The question is: if you've raised $30 million, $100 million, where is the rest of the money going to come from right? It's difficult there, unless you're bringing something very different.\"\nDon't blame eVTOL regulators Regulators are often blamed for delays to future technologies, but Cecutta says that's not the case here. Instead, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has done well to get regulations in place ahead of the industry requiring them, says Cecutta.\n\"Now, what happens when the regulations are in place?\" he asks. \"There's no airplanes to certify.\"\nHe adds: \"The regulator did a great job, but the companies didn't follow through with that.\"\nIn the meantime, the US continues to lead the eVTOL market, Cecutta says, with leader Joby Aviation already filing for certification in the UK. Plus, he added, China is making \"progress at a pace that is unheard of in the West.\"\nIf the European eVTOL manufacturers do fail to deliver, that could leave Europe as a key battleground for products: the US will be dominated by local firms, says Cecutta, while the lower prices of Chinese models will offer inroads in key markets in Asia and the Middle East, he predicts, saying it's similar to the electric vehicle market. But without a homegrown hero, Europe could be where US and Chinese models truly compete for market share.\nReal danger for European eVTOLs? But don't yet count out Europe's eVTOL market. All three companies are still operational, seeking solutions to their various funding issues. UK-based Vertical Aerospace hadn't responded to a request for comment at the time of writing, but the BBC suggested a deal worth $75m in investment was imminent.\nA spokesperson for Lilium told me the company was speaking to investors and considering M&A options, adding that though the company is in insolvency, work was continuing with plans in place for a first flight in early 2025. The spokesperson noted that the failure to win a loan guarantee from the German government wasn't down to Lilium's technology, but instead was blamed on disagreement in parliament from the Green Party over funding an air travel company. The German government has since collapsed.\nVolocopter also reportedly failed to raise €100m from the German government in April — perhaps the eVTOL woes have as much to do with German politics than anything else — and a report from Bloomberg suggested Chinese giant Geely may step in.\nIn an email, Volocopter told me it was constantly working with multiple private investors on funding, given it remains a pre-revenue, private company. \"It is not just the eVTOL market or EU that is having difficulties raising capital,\" the spokesperson said. \"However, the global market has been extremely tough and a completely different landscape since 2020/2021.\"\nBut overall, these financial struggles are not a good sign for the eVTOL market, says Cecutta. \"These internal troubles that they're having when it comes to funding and investors… does not bode well,\" Cecutta adds. \"When it comes to startups, you have to be all hands pushing in the same direction. When you begin to have issues with company control and investors, it doesn't make things easier.\"",

A similar identification emerged following an IDF strike in Rafah on May 26.\nThe Israeli military confirmed the strike, stating it targeted a Hamas compound within the school. Military spokesperson Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said the military was not “aware of any civilian casualties.”\nLerner added that 20 to 30 militants, including those involved in the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel, were using the school to plan and execute attacks. CNN indicated that it had not independently verified these statements.\nFootage from the scene showed Palestinians carrying bodies and injured people to a hospital. This attack comes at a crucial time in ceasefire negotiations, which aim to secure the release of hostages held by Hamas and Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.\nUS Calls For Transparency, NAACP’s Call To Halt Weapons Deliveries To Tel Aviv State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller confirmed that the U.S. is in contact with Israel regarding the strike and expects Israel to provide full transparency about the incident, highlighting growing international concerns over civilian casualties and the need for accountability.\nThe National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) urged President Joe Biden to “indefinitely” halt weapons deliveries to Israel and to pressure Israel to end its military actions in Gaza.\nThe century-old civil organization warned that continued support for Israel could affect Biden’s support among Black voters in the upcoming election.\nThe NAACP also urged Hamas to cease terrorist activities and return the hostages, while calling on Israel to align its military strategies with international and humanitarian laws.\nUS Warns Israel Not To Engage In A War With Lebanon The Biden administration has cautioned Israel against a “limited war” in Lebanon, warning it could provoke Iranian intervention, according to U.S. and Israeli officials who spoke to Axios .\nThis caution comes amid escalating skirmishes between Israel and Hezbollah, intensifying since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attacks, which have prompted calls within Israel for expanded military action against Hezbollah.\nU.S. officials emphasized that a ground invasion in Lebanon could attract militants from pro-Iranian groups in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen, complicating efforts to maintain regional stability.\nThe iShares MSCI Israel ETF EIS fell 0.5% on Thursday, marking its third straight session of losses. Oil prices edged higher, with the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) rising above $75 a barrel.\nThe United States Oil Fund USO , which tracks the performance of the WTI light crude, rallied 1.9%\nNow Read: First Human Death From Bird Flu Strain Puts Vaccine Stocks Back On The Map\nPhoto: Shutterstock\n ",
