    "title": "How Scripture Helped Pianist John Tesh Beat Cancer",
    "text": "How Scripture Helped Pianist John Tesh Beat Cancer By Movieguide® Contributor 71-year-old pianist, author and radio host John Tesh recently opened up with the Christian Post about how scripture helped him with his cancer battle. “I have found that many people don’t truly understand that there are dark forces, that the devil is after your mind. They don’t understand that,” he [said](https://www.christianpost.com/news/john-tesh-on-how-scripture-faith-healed-him-from-cancer.html). “It’s hard to believe because there are so many movies about it and all that. Many people think that when a thought comes into their mind, it comes from them, and it’s not. It’s put there by some other force,” he [continued](https://www.christianpost.com/news/john-tesh-on-how-scripture-faith-healed-him-from-cancer.html). Tesh says that to get rid of the devil’s influence, one’s mindset must change. “If you have so much unbelief and doubt in your heart, it’s like two pickup trucks that are chained together going in opposite directions, and you can’t get anywhere,” Tesh [explained](https://www.christianpost.com/news/john-tesh-on-how-scripture-faith-healed-him-from-cancer.html). “A consistent prayer life is like a muscle; you have to work on it. And then, you’ll read a Scripture in the Bible and all of the sudden, you face a different challenge, and that Scripture comes alive in a different way.” In 2015, doctors told Tesh that he had prostate cancer and that he had only 18 months left to live. Movieguide® [reported](https://www.movieguide.org/news-articles/tv-host-john-tesh-reveals-how-faith-shifted-his-perspective-when-given-a-medical-death-sentence.html) on Tesh’s response to the diagnosis: He soon became disheartened, drinking and abusing medication to cope with his feelings. However, after hearing a CD about divine healing, Tesh realized the power of God’s love. “God wants you well,” he [explained]. “It’s the other guy down below who really would like to kill, steal, and destroy.” Tesh then delved into the scripture, and his faith expanded. A CD from Pastor Andrew Wommack helped him understand God’s nature. “He said that the Bible says, ‘Whoever says to this mountain, ‘Be removed and be cast into the sea,’ and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that those things he says will be done, he will have whatever he says,’ and ‘For whatever you ask when you pray, believe that you receive it, and you will have,’” Tesh [said](https://www.christianpost.com/news/john-tesh-on-how-scripture-faith-healed-him-from-cancer.html). “I thought, ‘Wow, my mountain right now is cancer.’ My wife and I started digging deeper to understand the true nature of God.” “I’ve read the Bible for years, but I never really truly landed on those Scriptures,” he [shared](https://www.christianpost.com/news/john-tesh-on-how-scripture-faith-healed-him-from-cancer.html). “And that really started a journey of dual-modality for me, science and doctors, and also, what does the Bible say about health and healing?” Now, the award-winning pianist no longer has cancer. Since his experience, he firmly believes that medicine and faith must go hand in hand, which he teaches in his online course, “The Secret to Answered Prayers.” “There are some churches that teach healing and only healing through faith, but that’s not what worked for me,” Tesh [said](https://www.christianpost.com/news/john-tesh-on-how-scripture-faith-healed-him-from-cancer.html). “What worked for me was using what God did for medicine, and then also being able to renew my mind and have a focus of what God really wanted for me and be able to visualize my future.” Determined to share what he has learned with others, Tesh’s social media [pages](https://www.instagram.com/johntesh_ifyl/) are now full of positive thoughts, scripture, encouragement and prayers. “When I first discovered these Scriptures, I prayed throughout my day, and I believed, but I made a mistake — after my first round of three years of treatments, I decided not to get any more scans, and the cancer came back with a vengeance,” he [said](https://www.christianpost.com/news/john-tesh-on-how-scripture-faith-healed-him-from-cancer.html). “And I understood then truly that faith and medicine needed to work together. And I think it’s a dangerous thing that some churches do, where some of them don’t teach this at all.” Tesh teaches that a positive outlook and affirmations are an important part of moving mountains, and “Death and life are in the power of the tongue.” He previously shared a [prayer](https://www.facebook.com/JohnTesh/photos/a.83773297712/10159227214087713/?paipv=0&eav=AfZS-MrO_iGzpyh1eqlE94M2WrP_G74d-48b1GxjOO5UP1ZR7m_vHhpdCivvTUnPWCw&_rdr) that expresses this belief: “Father, your Word has become a part of me. It is flowing in my bloodstream. It flows in every cell of my body: Restoring and transforming my body. Your Word has become flesh; for You sent your word and HEALED me!” “I think renewing your mind has become more revelatory for people than just hey, how do I pray?” he [said](https://www.movieguide.org/Tesh%20teaches%20that%20a%20positive%20outlook%20and%20affirmations%20are%20an%20important%20part%20of%20moving%20mountains,%20and%20“Death%20and%20life%20are%20in%20the%20power%20of%20the%20tongue.”). “When you’re finally able to consistently renew your mind, then you can start with belief and not unbelief. That’s really one of the biggest things that people say is, ‘Oh my gosh, I’ve been able to renew my mind, and I can see more clearly what God wants from me.’” Now, after a renewal of faith and several years with his cancer battle, Tesh doesn’t have fear about the cancer’s possible return or what lies ahead. “I feel like I have so many weapons at my disposal that fear is entirely absent. And once you understand where you’re going after this life, you just don’t have any fear,” he [said](https://www.movieguide.org/Tesh%20teaches%20that%20a%20positive%20outlook%20and%20affirmations%20are%20an%20important%20part%20of%20moving%20mountains,%20and%20“Death%20and%20life%20are%20in%20the%20power%20of%20the%20tongue.”).

    "text": "ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan's Supreme Court ruled on Friday that jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan's party was eligible for over 20 extra reserved seats in the national legislature, ramping up pressure on the country's weak coalition government.\nKhan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party candidates contested the Feb. 8 election as independents after it was barred from the polls. They won the most seats but the election commission said independents were ineligible for the grant of 70 reserved seats, meant for political parties only.\nThe commission had ordered the reserved seats instead to be distributed among other parties, mostly to those in the ruling coalition.\n\"\"As a political party, the PTI is entitled to its reserved seats,\" said Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa while reading out the order, which was supported by eight judges and opposed by five of the 13-member full court bench.\nThe granting of 23 reserved seats does not affect the parliamentary majority of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's coalition government.\nUnder Pakistan's election rules, parties are allocated 70 reserved seats - 60 for women, 10 for non-Muslims - in proportion to the number of seats they win. This completes the National Assembly's total strength of 336 seats.\nThe decision does however bolster the political position of Khan's supporters, whose rallying cry has been that the election commission and a pro-military caretaker government that oversaw the polls indulged in electoral fraud to deprive it of a victory.\nThe commission and military deny the charges, but questions have been raised in the West about the transparency of the polls.\nThe U.S. House of Representatives, as well as European countries, have called on Islamabad to open a probe into the allegations - a move that Pakistan has thus far rejected.\nKhan was ousted from power in 2022 after he fell out with the country's powerful military generals. The military denies it interferes in politics.\n(Reporting by Islamabad bureau; Writing by Asif Shahzad and Gibran Peshimam; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan)\nShare © Reuters - 2024",

    "text": "Baloncesto\nEl Olympiacos frena la racha del Madrid a base de triples\nEl equipo griego metió 16 de 30 lanzamientos desde el perímetro para dejar en seis la cadena de victorias consecutivas de los blancos en la Euroliga (86-96)\nEFE\nEl Real Madrid puso fin en casa a su dinámica ascendente en la Euroliga tras caer ante el Olympiacos (86-96), líder de la fase regular, en un partido en el que la principal diferencia fue el acierto desde el triple, abundante en el equipo griego y escaso en el español.\nLa excelente racha de triunfos consecutivos de los locales en Europa, elevada a seis tras doblegar dos días atrás a un duro Maccabi en el duelo con más puntos acumulados por dos equipos en el tiempo reglamentario de un partido del torneo, se sometía a la prueba más exigente posible.\nPor estado de forma y cuentas pendientes el Olympiacos, que también encadenaba otras seis victorias y llegaba herido en su orgullo al haber sido derrotado en las dos últimas Finales a Cuatro del torneo por el conjunto blanco, la primera de ellas en el duelo por el título con un lanzamiento agónico de Sergio Llull, era una amenaza más que seria.\nPese a ello salió el anfitrión suelto, poniendo en escena un parcial de 9-3 que obligó a Georgios Bartzokas a pedir un tiempo muerto. Lo que fuera que tocase en ese lapso de tiempo resultó efectivo, porque desde ese momento los suyos empezaron despegar aprovechando uno de los puntos débiles del oponente, su defensa del lanzamiento exterior.\nPara paliarlo ha llegado en parte el estadounidense Dennis Smith Jr, especialista en esa faceta y cuyo fichaje se anunció por la mañana, pero que todavía no está disponible. Y en su ausencia el Olympiacos se dio un copioso banquete de triples (16 de 30), en contraste con los problemas del bando madridista para castigar desde el perímetro (8 de 28).\nAsí, los de El Pireo anotaron un total de ocho tiros exteriores hasta el descanso, sumando más de la mitad de sus 47 puntos desde lejos. En cambio el Real Madrid solo hizo dos, uno en los primeros diecisiete minutos obra de Dzanan Musa. Fue, eso sí, una de las jugadas más aplaudidas por los aficionados, por llegar después de un gran tapón de Alberto Abalde en el ocaso del primer acto.\nA esas alturas los de casa perdían solo de tres, desventaja que llegó hasta casi la decena en el intermedio después de que en el tramo final de la primera parte emergiese con cinco puntos seguidos Sasha Vezenkov, hasta entonces un gigante dormido que había cedido el protagonismo ofensivo al francés Evan Fournier.\nEl arranque de la segunda mitad fue en la línea de lo anterior, con el añadido de que la tortura comenzó a ejecutarla un viejo conocido, Nigel Williams-Goss. Autor de los ocho primeros puntos del plantel griego tras el descanso, sofocó una tímida reacción del Real Madrid y puso a los suyos en una lanzadera que les elevó hasta los quince de renta favorable, en mitad de las quejas de la grada por el arbitraje.\nA duras penas, y no sin esfuerzo, lograron los hombres de Chus Mateo situarse a nueve a falta de tres minutos para la media hora. Pero la esperanza de remontar la estranguló la mano caliente de Evan Fournier transformando tres triples, a los que se sumó uno más de Luca Vildoza, para un demoledor parcial de 2-12 que dejó el choque decidido a la media hora (54-73, m.30).\nAún así, quiso el Real Madrid pelear hasta el final cuando otros hubieran bajado los brazos. Perdiendo de dieciocho a falta de tres minutos y cuarenta y siete segundos, inició un viaje hacia lo imposible con el público de copiloto. Y la opción de una remontada heroica comenzó a sobrevolar por encima de las cabezas de los protagonistas.\nUn parcial de 10-0 hizo temblar las piernas de los jugadores del Olympiacos, a los que por momentos se les aparecieron los fantasmas de la final de Kaunas en 2023. Los espantó una canasta sanadora de Nikola Milutinov, que sirvió para bajar los decibelios y tranquilizar a los suyos, guiándoles hacia el triunfo.\nFicha técnica:\n86 - Real Madrid (19+19+16+32): Campazzo (7), Abalde (2), Musa (14), Ndiaye (2), Tavares (10), -cinco inicial-, Llull (8), Hezonja (17), Feliz (2), Rathan-Mayes (8), Hugo González (10), Garuba (6).\n96 - Olympiacos (22+25+26+23): Fournier (28), Williams-Goss (8), Papanikolau (8), Vezenkov (13), Fall (1) –inicial-, Larentzakis (-), Vildoza (11), Peters (1), Milutinov (13), McKissic (13).\nÁrbitros: Sasa Pukl (Eslovenia), Carmelo Paternico (Italia), Luka Kardum (Croacia). Eliminaron por faltas personales a Garuba (m.38) y al entrenador local Chus Mateo (m.39).\nIncidencias: Partido de la jornada 22 de la Euroliga disputado en el Movistar Arena ante 10.045 espectadores.\nRRSS WhatsApp\nRRSS Facebook\nRRSS Twitter\nRRSS email\nCopiar URL)\nNoticia guardada en tu perfil",

    "text": "Публикации в международных научных базах перестанут учитывать при оценке НИУ\nЧисло публикаций и цитирований в международных научных базах Web of Science и Scopus больше не будут иметь значение при оценке эффективности вузов, имеющих статус научно-исследовательских университетов (НИУ). Это следует из проекта приказа Минобрнауки, опубликованного 25 июня для общественного обсуждения.\nНапомним, статус НИУ присваивается на конкурсной основе. Сейчас его имеют 29 учебных заведений, среди них — ВШЭ, МЭИ, МАИ, РНИМУ имени Пирогова, ИТМО, Томский госуниверситет. Этот статус дает вузам возможность самостоятельно присуждать ученые степени и разрабатывать собственные образовательные стандарты, а также получать дополнительное федеральное финансирование на научные разработки.\nЧтобы стать НИУ, вуз должен предоставить специальной комиссии при Минобрнауки свою программу развития. Получив статус, НИУ должен раз в год отчитываться о реализации программы с учетом перечня показателей эффективности. К ним относятся, например, средний балл ЕГЭ студентов-бюджетников, количество иностранных студентов и преподавателей, доходы вуза и уровень зарплат его сотрудников, объем научно-исследовательских и опытно-конструкторских работ. По итогам года план должен быть выполнен не менее чем по 75% показателей.\nСогласно установленным еще в 2015 году критериям, к показателям эффективности относится количество публикаций в международных научных базах. Однако после начала военной операции на Украине организации из РФ были лишены доступа к Web of Science и Scopus. В ответ правительство РФ ввело мораторий на требование подсчета публикаций российских ученых в изданиях из этих баз — и начало разработку собственного «Белого списка» научных изданий.",
