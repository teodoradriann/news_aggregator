    "text": "PASCO COUNTY, Fla. – The Pasco Sheriff’s Office has seen an increase in reports of warrant scams and wants to warn the community. “We stress that these messages are not legitimate. PSO will never discuss warrants over the phone, and we will never request payment in any form to clear them,” said PSO in a social post. As part of these warrant scams, a person will usually receive a phone call from someone claiming to be a sheriff, police officer, bounty hunter, or lawyer. This caller usually informs the recipient of a warrant for their arrest. Read: [Auburndale Police Searching For Woman Who Stole A Bush From Dentist Office](https://www.tampafp.com/auburndale-police-searching-for-woman-who-stole-a-bush-from-dentist-office/) In some cases, scammers have more sophisticated technology and can manipulate caller ID data to make it appear as if the call is from the sheriff’s or police department. Frequently, the caller claims that the arrest warrant was issued because they failed to pay a debt, missed jury duty, or committed another minor infraction. The caller states that a fine is due and that the warrant will be executed if not paid in full. The call recipient will typically be asked to wire money or purchase a prepaid card and send it to the caller’s address. One variation of the warrant scam is when the caller claims that the recipient of the call is wanted for hacking into a business’s computer system. The caller demands payment over the telephone.

The caller may request payment over the phone, via wire transfer, or with a pre-paid debit card. Warning Signs There are several red flags that can alert people to a possible scam of this type. Police rarely call individuals to inform them that they have a warrant for their arrest. Instead, police will most likely arrive in person to arrest the suspect. If the debt is valid, the recipient will usually receive a certified letter informing them of the legal action being taken. Another potential indicator that people are being scammed in this way is when they are asked for payment on a debt they do not recognize, refuse to provide the company name for the debt that is alleged to be owed, refuse to provide contact information, or refuse to provide the notice in writing.

    "text": "Recommended Stories\nThe Ayodhya administration is gearing up for the largest ever crowd management exercise on Ram Navami which falls on April 17.\nThe officials are expecting a congregation of more than 50 lakh pilgrims on the day.\nDirector General of Police (DGP) Prashant Kumar and Chief Secretary D.S. Mishra are closely monitoring the preparations being made for Ram Navami and the nine-day long ‘Ram Janamotsav’ starting from April 9 which will conclude on April 17.\nThe chief secretary and DGP, who also visited Ram Janmabhoomi and reviewed security arrangements at the temple complex, have asked officials to make proper arrangements for devotees to make their visit to Ram temple comfortable.\nRam Navami, the festival to celebrate the birth of Lord Ram, will be observed on the ninth day of the ‘Chaitra Navratri’ .\nAccording to officials , they are working on a war footing to ensure the safety and comfort of the devotees during Ram Navami. However, it is tough to gauge the actual number of expected devotees and different teams are working on it.\nOfficials are pondering over multi entries and exits for devotees to avoid any stampede-like situation. Keeping in view the hot weather, water and mats on the open floors are also being arranged to save devotees from heat stroke.\nOfficials are also ensuring availability and regular supply of essentials such as milk, sugar, tea, foodgrains and vegetables, etc., in dharamshalas, temples, tent cities and hotels where the pilgrims will stay.\n(Except for the headline, this story, from a syndicated feed, has not been edited by Odishatv.in staff)",
