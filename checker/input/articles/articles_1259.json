    "text": "Nairobi was a ghost town most of the morning, save for the hordes of policemen and women on patrol, a visual that evoked a different kind of triumph for the youthful protesters. It seems like such a long time since the first peaceful protest were reported in late June, when thousands poured into the streets to protest the now-discarded Finance Bill 2024. The return of armed militias like Mungiki in a pro-government demo, or the heavy security barricades, have served to smash long-held mirage of Kenya as a bastion of regional stability. And it seems such a long time since the US designated Kenya a vital regional security ally, complete with a banquet in honour of Prezzo Ruto. That was in May. There was a spring in his gait as he trotted the world, propping himself as one of the continent’s spokesmen. Pointedly, Prezzo Ruto has been speaking less within his own land, and travels abroad even lesser since the Gen-Z protests began. Instead, visitors have been coming his way, the most recent being the top US official, Uzra Zeya, who was here to deliver a specific message to Prezzo Ruto: Stop police brutality on peaceful protestors, or else… I’m not sure if the police got this message, given the reported incidents of brutality yesterday, but even such heavy-handedness served to enhance the credibility of Gen-Z’s demands for accountability. The protestors appear to be gaining ground on other fronts. We all know, save for the 20 or 19 members in the Cabinet, that the economy is in the doldrums. Losing a day or two in every week of protest is a debilitating body blow to the economy. Dwindled business hours mean declining taxes. And lesser job opportunities. Connected to the latter is the issue of foreign direct investment. No one will invest their money in a city run by soldiers, or sell conferencing or tourist opportunities. Soldiers mean different sort of business. As the gateway to East Africa, many of our neighbours rely on us for the safe passage of their goods and services. When Nairobi sneezes, the neighbours catch the flu. Somebody calls these incremental successes “termite coup.” There are no swift and sweeping events to describe the success of the youths’ protests, though their gains are obvious and irreversible. Just like the termites, Gen-Zs are eating away at the legitimacy of the Ruto State, one protest at a time. Stay informed. Subscribe to our newsletter",

    "title": "Medcalf: Revival and another soon-to-be-gone Twin Cities restaurant offered more than just great food",
    "text": "When the owners of Revival, the local chain that made a chicken and waffles dish I always enjoyed, announced the closure of their four locations a few days ago , I thought about Tim Niver and others like him.\nThe first time I visited Saint Dinette with a buddy, Niver seemed more like a new friend than the owner of the restaurant. When he announced he would close his establishment in March , I felt sad, both for him, his staff and the patrons who enjoyed his hands-on approach to the dining experience.\n\"It hurts,\" he told me.\nWhen my brother visited the Twin Cities last weekend with his fiancée, I wanted to show them some of my favorite spots. As I weighed my options, however, I also had a pressing thought: Are any of them still open?\nThe restaurant business has faced a complicated chapter since the pandemic, which altered consumer behavior and fueled a culture of folks who prefer a $10 delivery charge on a DoorDash and Uber Eats meal over a night on the town. With margins already narrow for the owners of these establishments, the fiscal turbulence of the last five years has created insurmountable challenges for some of them. Also, for some families, perhaps many, dining out is not financially feasible right now. That has to be acknowledged. I'm also in favor of fair wages for all employees and minimum wage laws have impacted labor costs, too. But too often the conversation about the restaurant business becomes political.\nThe other side of that dialogue is the losses our communities endure when an establishment leaves. The restaurants in the Twin Cities remain among the few hubs where people gather and mingle outside of their comfort zones. They force us to exit our silos and see other communities we might not enjoy otherwise.\n\"Our industry is in the business of placemaking and creating experiences and emotional connection,\" said Angie Whitcomb, president and CEO of Hospitality Minnesota. \"When those businesses can't be sustained, it's heartbreaking for everyone, for the customers who feel tied to those places, who know the employees, who know the staff; and it's heartbreaking for the internal family at a restaurant. And that's really what you have when you work in a restaurant. It becomes a family.\"\nWhen Niver closes Saint Dinette in two months — due to the same financial headwinds others in the industry have encountered — I'll miss it. Not just because of the cheeseburger (the most underrated in the Twin Cities), the fries or the Brussels sprouts. I'll miss it because I made memories with friends there and and because of my interactions with Niver.\n\"I think people found a different quality of life [during Covid],\" he said. \"Many of them are working from home. So when you work from home, going out just feels bigger. But when you're already out at work or you're downtown and someone says it's happy hour, it's more natural. So it's a myriad of things. The cost of products that you buy has gone through the roof. You can keep raising prices. Of course, I can raise my prices. It's very easy to raise my prices. How does that affect people? Who's going to be able to afford anything, ultimately?\"\nI've lived in the Twin Cities long enough to know that new restaurants will arrive soon. I get that some of this is cyclical. But when I thought about a place to take my brother and his fiancée over the weekend, I realized I often define different pockets of this town by the food hubs I've had the privilege to enjoy.\nI navigate the nation through restaurants. Just last week on a work trip to Winston-Salem, N.C., I visited a pho spot and spoke with the owner about the unseasonably cold weather that part of the country had experienced in recent days. We laughed about finding ways to get rid of winter.\nI don't know anyone in Winston-Salem other than my work colleagues and a few friends, but I attached a face to the community simply because I wanted some good pho. And you know what? Whenever someone asks me about that city, I'll tell them about the friendly people there who have a great sense of humor. Based on that one interaction.\nThat's not fair, but it is how we judge other communities. And an experience at a restaurant can brighten or ruin a city's image. That's the power of restaurants. It's more than food.\nNiver said he's thinking about his staffers and supporters as he prepares to close his place in Lowertown. Before we got off the phone, however, he reminded me that he's still open for business.\n\"We just want it to be smooth and a good ride to the end,\" Niver said. \"I want [my staff] to feel celebrated for the work that they put in, for the energy towards others, the positive energy and the love towards others that we provide there. It is a personal vibe. It is personal. There's no separating it with me anyway.\"",

CIUDAD DE MÉXICO (apro).- Sven-Goran Eriksson, extécnico de la Selección Mexicana varonil de futbol de 2008 a 2009, ha conmovido a los usuarios de redes sociales tras la publicación de su documental autobiográfico que se estrenó en la plataforma de Prime Video. El sueco fue diagnosticado con cáncer de páncreas a principios de 2024 en fase terminal; los médicos aseguraron que, como mucho, le quedaría un año de vida. \"Tuve una buena vida. Igual demasiado buena, has de pagar por ello (risas). Creo que todos tenemos miedo del día en que muramos, pero la vida también se trata de la muerte. Tienes que aprender a aceptarla como es. Con suerte, al final la gente dirá: 'sí, era un buen hombre”, dijo Eriksson. Eriksson mandó un mensaje de despedida para su familia, sus seres queridos y para todos los que han estado a su alrededor, además de los aficionados del futbol de todo el mundo. “La vida también se trata de la muerte, tienes que aprender a aceptarla. Con suerte, al final la gente dirá: ‘Sí, era un buen hombre’, pero no todo el mundo dirá eso. Tuve una buena vida. No se arrepientan. Sonrían. Gracias por todo, entrenadores, jugadores y público. Ha sido fantástico. Cuídense y cuiden su vida. ¡Y vívanla! Adiós\", comenta el exentrenador. Como futbolista Sven-Goran Eriksson defendió los colores de Torsby IF, SK Sifhalla y KB Karlskoga FF, hasta que colgó las botas con 27 años en 1975. Su carrera como entrenador arrancó en 1976 en el Degerfors IF, al que siguieron Goteborg, Benfica, Roma, Fiorentina, Sampdoria, Lazio, Manchester City, Leicester City, Shanghai SIPG y Shenzhen. Posteriormente el técnico sueco también fue seleccionador de Inglaterra (2001-2006), México (2008-2009), Costa de Marfil (2010) y Filipinas (2018-2019).",

    "text": "[Science News](https://www.news9live.com/science) Earth in Danger? Asteroid 2024 VK3’s Close Encounter Raises Alarm Asteroid 2024 VK3 is approaching Earth at a very close range, and people are now panicking about an impact! This cosmic threat could be near-miss in a few months and scientists are struggling to track this in order to prevent it! New Delhi: The recently discovered asteroid 2024 VK3 is an Aten-type NEO that recently flew by Earth and has future projections that have piqued the interest of astronomers. Discovered on November 10, 2024, and observed three days later by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, this asteroid has an elongated orbit that occasionally brings it into Earth’s vicinity. According to its determined orbit and distance from the Sun, it belongs to the Aten group, NEOs that have SMA less than the Earth but whose orbits cross Earth’s orbit. The Earth MOID is 0.0027207 AU, which makes it a potentially dangerous asteroid relative to Earth, though the probability of a collision with Earth in the future is very low according to research data. The asteroid, 27.4 in absolute magnitude, is several dozen metres in size, although the size is not accurately defined. It has a semi-major axis of 0.9268 AU and an orbital eccentricity of 0.38, making it travel as close as 0.57 AU (perihelion) and as far as 1.28 AU (aphelion) from the Sun. It has an inclination angle of 2.18 degrees with respect to the Earth’s orbit and thus can approach the Earth at a relatively close distance during a certain point. Interactions with Earth and Other Planets Observations of 2024 VK3 made recently enabled astronomers to track previous encounters and predict future close approaches. In the past decades, it had been closer to Earth, Moon, and Venus. In particular, in 1991, it got to the Moon at the nearest distance of 616,694 km and to the Earth at a distance of approximately 471,046 km that same day. The asteroid has also come within the orbit of Venus, with its closest approach in 1993 and 1995. In the future, the next close approach is predicted to occur in January 2025, where the asteroid will come within 0.0004 AU of the planet’s orbit, a date of particular significance. Though now the distance is as close as 3.3 million kilometres, scientists do not expect a hit but continue to observe the situation as new data is obtained. Since it has condition code 6, meaning that there is some doubt about the exact orbit but within predictable limits, JPL researchers are using continuous observation to bring improved trajectory models to determine whether there is a possibility of future impacts. This continued research means that care should be taken with NEOs because small changes in orbit can change the ability of the NEO to approach the earth in the future.
