    "title": "Matildas have questions to answer everywhere after Olympic humbling by Germany",
    "text": "Whatever the expectation was heading into the [Matildas](/football/team/_/id/2751/australia)' opening match of the [Olympic women's football tournament](/football/league/_/name/fifa.w.olympics), against [Germany](/football/team?id=2756), surely no one was expecting that. Goals to [Marina Hegering](https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/286459/marina-hegering), [Lea Schüller](/soccer/player/_/id/258844/lea-schuller), and [Jule Brand](https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/317719/jule-brand) gave the 2016 Olympic champions a [3-0 win](/football/match/_/gameId/699835/australia-germany) and the perfect opening to their tournament. For the Matildas, it was a horror start, a tough watch in the middle of the night for those back home, and a wakeup call according to captain [Steph Catley](https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/219822/steph-catley). Morale was high with Catley and [Caitlin Foord](https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/158678/caitlin-foord) both deemed healthy enough to start after injury and precaution had kept them out of the Matildas' final warmup game against [Canada](/football/team?id=2753). Although [Tameka Yallop](https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/158688/tameka-yallop) was ruled out and replaced in the 18 by [Sharn Freier](https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/312197/sharn-freier), there was nothing obvious to worry about, personnel wise. But what followed was one of the worst games of consequence played by the Matildas under Tony Gustavsson. Moreover, it was confusing in how un-Matildas-like it was -- not just in defence but in attack. One of the strongest transformations under Gustavsson has been the Matildas' defensive stocks. It's an area of the pitch where assistant coach Jens Fjellstrom gets a lot of credit, and rightly so. Under his guidance and direction, the Australians have been able to nip silly defensive errors in the bud. There has been a concerted focus on set-piece defending, learning not to panic, and fostering stronger connections between the back four. And over the course of the past three-and-a-half years, the proof had been in the pudding. But the team's usual defensive solidity looked like it had been packed in the luggage that got lost on the team's charter flight from the training camp in Marbella to Marseille. Both Hegering and Schüller scored free headers from [Giulia Gwinn](/soccer/player/_/id/268102/giulia-gwinn) corners: Hegering ghosted between [Ellie Carpenter](https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/236710/ellie-carpenter) and [Alanna Kennedy](https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/219819/alanna-kennedy) at the far post while Schüller was simply left to her own devices, completely unmarked. If not for an offside [Alexandra Popp](/soccer/player/_/id/158735/alexandra-popp), Germany could have easily had a hat trick of easy, headed goals. It immediately bore dozens of memes, all using [Sam Kerr](https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/158683/sam-kerr)'s quote about the [USWNT](/football/team/_/id/2765/united-states)'s record on defending set pieces -- \"do youse not work on that?\" -- from the Netflix documentary on the team's 2023 [FIFA Women's World Cup](/football/league/_/name/fifa.wwc). Ultimately, the first two goals were undeniable errors that the Matildas will be filthy with. And perhaps if they had been the only goals conceded, the aftermath wouldn't feel as bad as it does. But Germany's third goal was a team move that saw the Matildas a beat behind for the entire passage, with Brand tapping the ball into the back of the net. Those in yellow looked like dancers who hadn't been given the choreography but were trying their best to not to look out of place. Naturally, the talk postgame was about how those mistakes must be eliminated and quickly. But defensive errors aren't the only thing that require tweaking ahead of the [Zambia](/football/team?id=20795) clash on Monday (AEST). [Australia](/football/team?id=2751) also struggled up front; this was a scenario that felt more likely than the defensive stumbles but it was no less disappointing to watch. Gustavsson chose to employ [Cortnee Vine](https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/300517/cortnee-vine) as the No. 9. It was a decision that prioritised [Mary Fowler](https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/276165/mary-fowler) as a free-roaming No. 10 with Foord out on the left to work in combination with her [Arsenal](/football/team?id=19973) teammate, Catley -- a connection Gustavsson leans on time and time again. But Vine as the central striker looked as untested as it felt. The general wisdom that [Michelle Heyman](https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/158675/michelle-heyman) would be better selected in the Matildas' second fixture since she can't play consecutive 90-minute games; but Vine as the next woman in to occupy that central space up top wasn't right either. On top of that, the Catley-Foord combination failed to capitalise on their bright moments while Fowler was unable to impact that game in the way she -- and Gustavsson and the nation -- wanted or needed. It begs the question: Do Gustavsson's attacking priorities need to be changed? Should Fowler be deployed out wide where she enjoyed success at club level? Does shifting Foord more central solve the No. 9 problem? Is there value in reprising the Fowler and [Emily van Egmond](https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/158693/emily-van-egmond) double false No. 9 that enjoyed success in the small sample of games at the World Cup? Would that in any way solve the seeming disconnect between the midfield and the forward line in this game? These are the questions both Gustavsson and his team will ponder as they recover and immediately shift focus to Zambia in Nice. A lot needs to be tweaked in an incredibly short amount of time if the Matildas are to keep their medal dreams alive.",

    "title": "Despite witnesses who forgot the crime, New Orleans jury finds man guilty of murder",
    "text": "A New Orleans jury late Wednesday night convicted a man of [shooting another man to death](https://www.nola.com/news/crime_police/two-stabbed-uptown-armed-robbery-reported-in-new-orleans-over-24-hour-period/article_ef20e2c2-f14d-11eb-b566-afd31cbed4fe.html) three years ago in Treme, in what prosecutors described as a drug-infested apartment complex. The jury found 44-year-old Barry Bowie guilty as charged of second-degree murder, obstruction of justice and possession of a firearm by a felon in the June 7, 2021 killing of Henry James in the 1900 block of St. Ann Street. According to an affidavit for an arrest warrant, witnesses told New Orleans police that the men had argued at the apartments before Bowie shot James multiple times. But when prosecutors Forrest Ladd and Carlos Torres called four alleged eyewitnesses to the stand, they told a different story: They were high on drugs and couldn’t remember anything. A fifth eyewitness died of an overdose, prosecutors said, before he could testify. Instead, over the three-day trial this week in Orleans Parish Criminal District Court, prosecutors showed surveillance footage that placed Bowie at the crime scene holding what appeared to be a handgun, as well as other video footage that tracked his movements throughout the evening. Defense attorneys Judson Mitchell and Jessica Natal argued that without witnesses to identify Bowie as the killer, his mere presence at the scene wasn’t enough to convict him. Prosecutors also played a jail call during which Bowie admitting to being at the shooting. But the clip, Natal argued, only proved that Bowie had fled after the gunfire like several other bystanders. The jury deliberated for four hours, until just after 10 p.m., before it delivered its guilty verdict. Criminal District Court Judge Kimya Holmes scheduled Bowie’s sentencing hearing, where he will face a mandatory life-in-prison sentence, for July 31.",

    "text": "LOS ANGELES — Powerful surf rolled onto beaches on the West Coast and Hawaii on Thursday as a big swell generated by the stormy Pacific Ocean pushed toward shorelines, causing localized flooding. Forecasters urged people to stay off rocks and jetties, and to not turn their backs to the ocean because of the danger of “sneaker waves” — occasional much bigger waves that can run far up the sand and wash someone off a beach. A high surf warning for parts of Northern California said waves would range from 28 to 33 feet and up to 40 feet at some locations, the National Weather Service said, adding that there were reports of flooding in low-lying coastal areas. In Aptos on the north end of Monterey Bay, surf overran the beach and swept into a parking lot, leaving the area strewn with debris. Santa Cruz County issued warnings for people in several coastal areas to be ready to evacuate. “Mother Nature’s angry,” said Eve Krammer, an Aptos resident for several years. “I mean these waves are gnarly. They’re huge.” The same area was battered by the ocean last January as the West Coast was slammed by numerous atmospheric rivers. “I feel for the people that are down low here,” said Jeff Howard, also an Aptos resident. While not quite as huge, the waves along Southern California were also described as hazardous, with life-threatening rip currents. Nonetheless, surfers couldn’t resist. Patience was key, according to Alex Buford, 27, who was catching waves just north of Manhattan Beach on the Los Angeles County coast. “I was waiting for awhile because the waves were really sick, and they’re kinda hard to get into even though I have a really big board,” he said. “Just waited for a good one and I got it and it was a long one. Pretty big. It was sick.” In Hawaii, the weather service forecast surf rising to 30 to 40 feet along north-facing shores and 18 to 22 feet along west-facing shores of five islands. Professional Hawaii surfer Sheldon Paishon was getting ready to surf Thursday morning at Makaha, a world-famous surfing beach on Oahu’s west side. Paishon, 30, has been surfing at various spots around Oahu this week, taking advantage of waves during this week’s high surf warning in effect till this morning. “It’s always big waves in the winter time in Hawaii,” he said. He warned that novice surfers should check with lifeguards before heading into the water and “make sure you got some people around you and stay safe.” Honolulu Ocean Safety lifeguards, posted at beaches across Oahu, rescued 20 people along the island’s famed North Shore on Wednesday, said spokesperson Shayne Enright. They were also busy with thousands of “preventative actions,” she said. “This time of year produces incredible surf but it can also be very dangerous,” she said. The dangerous surf could also cause surges that could hit coastal properties and roadways, the weather service warned.",

    "text": "Die Zahl der Pflege-Azubis, die ihre Ausbildung erfolgreich beenden, stagniert in Thüringen. Im vergangenen Jahr schlossen nach Angaben des Statistischen Landesamtes 890 Frauen und Männer ihre Pflege-Ausbildung ab. Die meisten – 879 – entschieden sich für den fachübergreifenden Abschluss als Pflegefachfrau oder Pflegefachmann. Elf Absolventen haben einen Abschluss mit dem Schwerpunkt Gesundheits- und Kinderkrankenpflege in der Tasche. Seit einer Reform der Pflegeausbildung 2020 durchlaufen angehende Kranken-, Alten- und Kinderkrankenpflegekräfte eine weitgehend vereinheitlichte Ausbildung.\nEnde 2024 befanden sich laut Landesamt insgesamt 4.005 Personen in der Ausbildung zum Pflegefachmann oder zur Pflegefachfrau. 1.684 von ihnen absolvierten ihr erstes Ausbildungsjahr.",
