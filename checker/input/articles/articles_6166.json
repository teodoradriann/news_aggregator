    "text": "The number of antisemitic hate crimes recorded by many of the UK’s largest police forces jumped sharply in the weeks following the outbreak of the Hamas-Israel conflict, new figures reveal.\nIslamophobic offences also rose for some forces, although the picture was more mixed across the country.\nJewish charities called the findings “shocking”, while campaigners against anti-Muslim abuse said the data was “deeply worrying”.\nThe Home Office condemned the rise in offences, adding: “There is no place for hate in our society.”\n(PA Graphics) The figures have been obtained by the PA news agency using Freedom of Information requests. They show that:\n– Greater Manchester Police recorded 74 antisemitic offences in the month following the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7, compared with 15 for the same period in 2022 and 14 in 2021, while West Yorkshire Police recorded 53, compared with 10 (2022) and 14 (2021).\n– West Midlands Police recorded 22 antisemitic offences from October 7 to November 7, compared with one (2022) and eight (2021), while Merseyside Police recorded 20 compared with four (both 2022 and 2021).\n– The British Transport Police had one of the largest increases, recording 87 antisemitic offences in the month after October 7, up from eight in the same period in 2022 and 11 in 2021, as well as a jump in Islamophobic offences with 22 (2023), up from two (2022) and eight (2021).\n– West Yorkshire recorded 49 Islamophobic offences in this period in 2023, up from 29 (2022) and 38 (2021), but the pattern was not so clear for Greater Manchester (34 in 2023, 43 in 2022 and 42 in 2021) or West Midlands (25 in 2023, 33 in 2022 and 23 in 2021).\n(PA Graphics) The Community Security Trust described the figures as “shocking” and said they made clear “the extent of the unacceptable rise in anti-Jewish hatred across the country since the Hamas terror attack on October 7”.\nA spokesman for the Jewish charity said: “This wave of antisemitism was triggered by the mass murder, rape and kidnapping of Jews in Israel, and is fuelled and sustained by extremist hatred online and on our streets.\n“It is essential that perpetrators are identified and prosecuted, and that wider society shows its disgust for this racist hate crime.”\nTell Mama, which monitors and works to tackle anti-Muslim sentiment and abuse in the UK, told PA that “levels of anti-Muslim hatred and discrimination are deeply worrying, impacting trust in authorities and their sense of identity and belonging”.\nIman Atta, the organisation’s director, said there had been a “significant spike in anti-Muslim hate since the atrocities on October 7”, adding: “The nature of many offline cases sent to our service is often overtly racist – targeting Arab and Palestinian communities with dehumanising slurs, anti-Muslim slurs or in some cases targeting their homes, or when speaking Arabic in public, as well as targeting Muslim communities across all ages and gender.\n“We should never allow such hatred and intolerance to take root in our communities and at this time, please look out for each other, whether Muslim or Jewish. We must stand together against intolerance, hate and racism.”\nThe Metropolitan Police, the largest force in the UK, said delays prevented it from supplying full figures until the new year, but it had previously reported 218 antisemitic and 101 Islamophobic offences between October 1 and 18 this year, compared with 15 and 42 respectively in the same period in 2022.\nPA obtained full responses from 31 of the 46 forces across the UK, with the data representing a snapshot of what has currently been recorded by forces and is therefore subject to change.\nMethods for recording hate crime are not consistent across forces, so the data cannot be used to compare the number of offences between different areas or provide an overall total for the whole of the UK.\nBut the figures do point to a jump in antisemitic offences recorded by forces concentrated mostly in cities or across built-up areas, while the pattern for Islamophobic offences was more varied.\n(PA Graphics) Some forces that operate across a mix of urban and less populated areas tend to show a similar pattern, although with lower volumes of offences – for example Hertfordshire Police (17 antisemitic offences for the period in 2023, compared with six in 2022 and three in 2021) and Thames Valley Police (21 antisemitic offences in 2023, one in 2022 and four in 2021).\nData obtained from smaller forces, or those covering areas with few towns or cities, typically showed low numbers of offences, often in single figures, meaning a clear trend was hard to determine.\nA spokesman for the Board of Deputies of British Jews said the findings “provide further evidence of the huge upsurge in antisemitism following the Hamas massacre of October 7”.\nThe board, seen as the voice of the British Jewish community with over 300 deputies directly elected by the synagogues and communal organisations they represent, told PA the rise in antisemitism had “caused enormous anxiety for Jewish people, particularly children and Jewish students on campus or indeed anyone easily identified as Jewish by their dress”.\nA spokesman added: “We call on police to take strong action against anyone found to be perpetrating hate crimes.”\nThe Muslim Council of Britain said: “Despite the extremely low reporting rate from Muslim communities, the huge increase in Islamophobic hate crimes recorded with the police reflects what we are seeing from third-party reporting groups.\n“The Government’s laissez-faire attitude to Islamophobia contrasts strongly with its no-tolerance approach to antisemitism. We are hopeful this will now change.”\nA spokesperson for the Home Office said: “There is no place for hate in our society and we condemn the recent rise in reported antisemitic and anti-Muslim hatred.\n“We expect the police to fully investigate all hate crimes and work with the CPS to make sure the cowards who commit these abhorrent offences feel the full force of the law.\n“Following recent events, we have also made further funding available to Jewish and Muslim communities, to provide additional security at places of worship and faith schools.”",

Environ 200 personnes ont participé à cette \"guérilla visuelle\" d'une trentaine de minutes, selon le comité d'entreprise. Quatre hommes vêtus de noir ont porté un cercueil avec une poupée à l'intérieur. Des torches de Bengale et des pots de fumée ont également été allumés.\n\"Faire un geste\"\nLes salariés ont voulu manifester par cette action pour l'avenir de la division acier, a expliqué le comité d'entreprise. A la veille d'une importante réunion du conseil de surveillance, ils voulaient ainsi \"donner un signal\", a déclaré Jens Burnicki du comité central d'entreprise.\nLe conseil de surveillance de Thyssenkrupp Steel Europe (TKSE), le plus grand producteur d'acier en Allemagne, se réunit vendredi pour discuter d'une réorganisation fondamentale. Afin de devenir plus compétitif, il est prévu de réduire les capacités de production, ce qui entraînera également des suppressions d'emplois. Les licenciements secs seront toutefois exclus. La division est sur le point de devenir indépendante. La question de la dotation financière avec laquelle la maison mère enverra la branche acier vers l'autonomie est toutefois encore controversée.\nLe comité d'entreprise voit un risque d'insolvabilité\nLe président du comité d'entreprise du site de Duisburg/Beeckerwerth, Ali Güzel, a exprimé jeudi soir sa crainte que la maison mère ne mette pas assez d'argent à disposition. \"La crainte est que l'on nous donne aussi peu de dot que possible, de sorte qu'à la fin de la journée, l'administrateur judiciaire soit à la porte\", a déclaré Güzel aux journalistes. \"Le risque d'insolvabilité est très élevé\", a-t-il ajouté.\nSelon lui, la commande d'une nouvelle expertise sur le financement nécessaire de la branche est également à l'ordre du jour des superviseurs vendredi. Jusqu'à présent, les idées de la direction de l'acier, du conseil d'administration de Thyssenkrupp et de la cogestion sont encore trop éloignées les unes des autres. Les salariés ne donneront leur accord à un business plan élaboré par la direction de l'acier que lorsque le financement futur aura été clarifié, a déclaré M. Güzel.\nLa division acier de Thyssenkrupp emploie environ 27.000 personnes, dont 13.000 à Duisbourg /tob/DP/he.",

    "text": "The pressures of climate change may be strengthening bonds between unlikely allies in Central Australia's bird community as species are forced to work together to access life-saving resources, a study has found.\nA species of Central Australian honeyeater, which has a reputation for being territorial and protective of limited food sources and other resources, is relying on potential competitors like finches to safely access waterholes.\nHotter weather associated with climate change threatens biodiversity on a global scale, and new research led by Charles Darwin University (CDU) PhD student Simon Votto has revealed the rising mercury means scarce water sources are becoming even more important.\nPrevious research from Mr Votto as an Honours student found birds that usually rely on their diet for hydration as opposed to surface water were seeking out the critical water sites once temperatures rise above 35°C.\nThis shaped the premise for his PhD.\n\"I expected that in cases where water is limited during hot, dry summers, honeyeaters might try and defend those sites, but we actually found they would often go into waterholes with other birds,\" Mr Votto said.\n\"One possible explanation for that is that they're doing it to reduce the risk of predation at the individual level by accessing drinking with other species - a number of times, I found honeyeaters waited until species like finches went in to drink, and they would follow them in.\"\nMr Votto said several canopy foraging birds, despite the heat, would not use waterholes unless there was fringing vegetation cover within 10 metres of the site, meaning these species were unlikely to access sites degraded by feral animals like camels.\n\"Long-lasting waterhole sites are often supported by groundwater input, which means there's usually more vegetation and better food sources for honeyeaters to access in the habitat surrounding them,\" Mr Votto said.\nHe said understanding the habits of the birds frequenting Central Australian waterholes would play a critical role in managing such sites.\n\"Sites that are affected by habitat degradation from feral animals like camels, for example, could be restored and better protected from pests,\" Mr Votto said.\n\"These sites are going to be very important for birds in a warming climate, particularly when they already live in environments subject to extreme heat conditions - many of them will become more dependent on these sites to meet their water needs.\"\nPrincipal supervisor for the study, Professor Jenny Davis, said the study highlighted the importance of maintaining the vegetation surrounding arid zone waterholes.\nProfessor Davis said about 70 per cent of inland Australia experienced arid or semi-arid climates.\n\"Controlling wildfires and fire-promoting plants such as Buffel grass, restricting access by feral herbivores, especially camels, and replanting vegetation with local species are all important strategies to conserve much-valued waterholes and the birds they support in central Australia,\" she said.\nAssociate Professor Christine Schlesinger, who also supervised the study, said maintaining the sites would not just support the ecosystem, but was also of high cultural importance.\n\"Many of the smaller sites in particular have been actively maintained and cared for by Central Australian First Nations people for millennia, allowing both humans and other species to persist in areas where there might be no other free-standing water for tens or even hundreds of kilometres,\" Professor Schlesinger said.\n\"Maintaining the health of these waterholes - work that is already of high priority across Indigenous Protected Areas - is critical, as is further research to inform management approaches.\n\"We know these sites provide critical access to water but we know relatively little about the behavioural adaptations and social dynamics of animals that rely on these resources, or about how these are changing with the climate.\"\nhere.",

    "title": "First meteor shower of 2024 could be the strongest; Quadrantids set to peak Jan. 3-4",
    "text": "The Quadrantid meteor showers are set to peak Jan. 3 and Jan. 4, and NASA and the American Meteor Society say it could be the strongest meteor shower of 2024.\nThe AMS says an average of 25 meteors per hour may be seen, while NASA says to expect 120 meteors per hour during the peak.\n“Predictions for 2024 show a peak for observers viewing from North America between the local hours of 1 a.m. to 5 a.m. (Jan. 4),” the AMS states. “Rates could be quite high if observed under clear, transparent skies.”\nThe peak for these showers is relatively short, NASA notes.\n“The reason the peak is so short is due to the shower’s thin stream of particles and the fact that the Earth crosses the stream at a perpendicular angle,” NASA states.\nHow well they can be viewed will depend on the weather. On Dec. 27, AccuWeather was forecasting partially cloudy skies with a high in the low 40s for southeastern Pennsylvania.\nAnother factor affecting visibility will be the phase of the moon. The less light from the moon, the better viewing. The moon will be about 51% full Jan. 3 and Jan. 4, so it will somewhat interfere with viewing.\nIt is possible to catch some of the meteor action from the shower now, as it is listed as being active between Dec. 26 through Jan. 16.\nThe shower gets its name from the constellation from which the particles appear to emanate, Quadrans Muralis, according to NASA. The organization says the constellation is now obsolete and references shifted to the nearby Bootes constellation. An alternative name for the shower is the Bootids.\n“The constellation for which a meteor shower is named only serves to aid viewers in determining which shower they are viewing on a given night,” NASA states. “The constellation is not the source of the meteors. Also, you should not look only to the constellation of Bootes to view the Quadrantids — they are visible throughout the night sky.”\nAn added treat, NASA says, is that the Quadrantids are known for spawning bright fireball meteors, which are larger light explosions that last longer than normal meteor streaks.\nThe AMS invites viewers to report seeing a fireball on its website: https://fireball.amsmeteors.org/ .\nMeteors and fireballs are created as particles or chunks of comets or asteroids enter Earth’s atmosphere. The Quadrantids are said to originate from asteroid 2003 EH1, which was first observed at Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona in 2003.\nTips “Find an area well away from the city or street lights,” NASA states. “Come prepared for winter weather with a sleeping bag, blanket, or lawn chair. Lie flat on your back with your feet facing northeast and look up, taking in as much of the sky as possible. In less than 30 minutes in the dark, your eyes will adapt and you will begin to see meteors.”\nThe Berks County Amateur Astronomy Society has shared a light pollution map of southeastern Pennsylvania to plot out the best spots to view nighttime aerial phenomenon.

And what I don't know is this kid, this schlemiel kid, has commandeered a couple of monkeys to go in back, behind my back, over to the side of the stage and throw out these two great dames that I invited to be my guests to the show. And these dames are in their forties, okay? Business women. \"In fact, you aren't gonna believe this sh*t. This f***ing kid, what he doesn't know is that these two dames work for the accounting firm that represent him, not me. But as usual, he, just like his uncle and his uncle's brother, stiffed them for tickets. \"..he throws them out of the building. He's teaching me a lesson. What this f***ing kid doesn't know, they're carrying the paychecks for all 82 people on the road crew.\" Roth then moves to the Hollywood Bowl shows, \"We're at the Hollywood Bowl. I'm about to launch into 'Ice Cream Man', and this f***in kid! He commandeers two muscle monkeys, locates the one dame that is my guest; she's off in the wings of the Hollywood Bowl. They find her, make her do the walk of shame past all the other guests, out into the parking lot and throw her out of the building! \"Wolfie Van Halen's gonna teach me a lesson by throwing out what he thinks is my girlfriend. But guess what? Not only is this an accountant again, and not only is she carrying the paychecks for 82 of us on the road crew, but she's carrying cash bonuses for everybody there. You may wanna pull over on this next one; you're gonna pee your pants. Remember New York City? It's the same f***in lady!\" Roth concluded, \"This f***ing kid. This f***ing kid! And that's how I remember my last show with Eddie Van Halen.\" [Mammoth WVH Rock Jimmy Kimmel Live](https://www.antimusic.com/news/24/0126mammoth_wvh_rock_jimmy_kimmel_live.shtml) [David Lee Roth Rants Against Wolfgang Van Halen](https://www.antimusic.com/news/24/0125david_lee_roth_rants_against_wolfgang_van_halen.shtml) [Wolfgang Van Halen's Mammoth WVH To Rock Jimmy Kimmel Live!](https://www.antimusic.com/news/24/0123wolfgang_van_halens_mammoth_wvh_to_rock_jimmy_kimmel_live.shtml) [Eddie Van Halen Cried When He Met Billie Joe Armstrong](https://www.antimusic.com/news/24/0121eddie_van_halen_cried_when_he_met_billie_joe_armstrong.shtml) [Billy Joel Returns With First New Song In Decades- AC/DC Reach New Billion Stream Milestone With 'Back In Black'- more](https://www.antimusic.com/dayinrock/) [Ace Frehley Reacts To KISS Farewell Snub- Pink Floyd Announce Collector's Edition Of Newly Remastered 'Dark Side Of The Moon'- more](https://www.antimusic.com/dayinrock/24/0131.shtml) [Quick Flicks: Mark Farner - Rock 'N' Roll Soul Live 1989](https://www.antimusic.com/reviews/24/mark-farner-rock-n-roll-soul-live-1989-/) [The Blues: 2023 Wrap Up Part 2: Mike Zito and Albert Castiglia, Johnny Winter and more](https://www.antimusic.com/reviews/24/2023-wrap-up-part-2-mike-zito-and-albert-castiglia-johnny-winter-and-more/) [Sites and Sounds: It's Tulsa Time!](https://www.antimusic.com/reviews/24/its-tulsa-time/) [Root 66: Year End Wrap Up Part 1](https://www.antimusic.com/reviews/24/year-end-wrap-up-part-1/) [Billy Joel Returns With First New Song In Decades](https://www.antimusic.com/news/24/0201billy_joel_returns_with_first_new_song_in_decades.shtml) [AC/DC Reach New Billion Stream Milestone With 'Back In Black'](https://www.antimusic.com/news/24/0201acdc_reach_new_billion_stream_milestone_with_back_in_black.shtml) [New James Brown Track From 1970 Set For Release](https://www.antimusic.com/news/24/0201new_james_brown_track_from_1970_set_for_release.shtml) [Deap Vally Release Their Final Album And Share Farewell Tour Dates](https://www.antimusic.com/news/24/0201deap_vally_release_their_final_album_and_share_farewell_tour_dates.shtml) [Yellowcard and Hammock Delivering 'A Hopeful Sign' Next Week](https://www.antimusic.com/news/24/0201yellowcard_and_hammock_delivering_a_hopeful_sign_next_week.shtml) [Silent Planet Premiere SUPERBLOOM Video](https://www.antimusic.com/news/24/0201silent_planet_premiere_superbloom_video.shtml) [Unearth Deliver 'Eradicator' Video](https://www.antimusic.com/news/24/0201unearth_deliver_eradicator_video.shtml) [Jeff Larson Announces New Album 'Adobe Home'](https://www.antimusic.com/news/24/0201jeff_larson_announces_new_album_adobe_home.shtml)",

    "title": "Tentative Steps Towards Peace: Hamas and Egypt’s Ceasefire Proposal",
    "text": "In a region long shadowed by conflict, a new chapter unfolds as Hamas agrees to Egypt’s ceasefire proposal, despite Israel’s hesitations.\nThis development marks a significant, though fragile, step towards peace between Israel and Hamas, with broader implications for the Middle East.\nThe narrative begins with Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh’s acceptance of the ceasefire terms discussed with Qatar’s Prime Minister and Egypt ’s intelligence chief.\nThe details of these terms, crucial to understanding the full scope of the agreement, remain shrouded in secrecy.\nIsrael expresses reservations, particularly concerning the release of hostages held since October 2023.\nTentative Steps Towards Peace: Hamas and Egypt’s Ceasefire Proposal. (Photo Internet reproduction) This highlights the complexities of negotiation and the deep-seated mistrust that pervades Israeli-Hamas relations.\nMedia reports cast further uncertainty on the ceasefire ‘s viability. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has reportedly denied any mediator’s authority to end the conflict definitively.\nThis skepticism underscores the delicate nature of peace talks in a region where past ceasefires have often faltered.\nSteps Toward Gaza’s Stability The proposed ceasefire isn’t just a pause in fighting but a structured, three-phase plan aimed at lasting peace.\nIt began with a 40-day truce, during which 33 hostages would return home in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.\nThis initial phase sets the stage for resumed indirect negotiations, intended to solidify a sustained calm in Gaza.\nSubsequent phases would see the release of all remaining hostages and further prisoner exchanges, culminating in the withdrawal of Israeli defense forces from Gaza.\nEach phase builds on the last, aiming for a comprehensive resolution that extends beyond the immediate ceasefire to the rehabilitation of Gaza itself.\nInfrastructure restoration in Gaza—roads, electricity, water, sanitation, and communications—would kickstart during the ceasefire’s first phase.\nA five-year reconstruction plan for Gaza’s civil infrastructure is set to begin in the later phases. This plan promises not just a cessation of hostilities but a foundation for future stability and growth.\nThis complex negotiation, while fragile, holds the potential not just to pause the conflict but to reshape the future of the region.\nIt represents a test of international diplomacy and the resilience of agreements forged under pressure.\nAs the world watches, the stakes are high and the outcomes uncertain, but the pursuit of peace continues.",

Un turismo era arrollado en un paso a nivel provisional por un tren ALVIA que realizaba la ruta Madrid-Santander,\nEn el interior del coche viajaban dos trabajadores de las obras en la Alta Velocidad a Cantabria, donde estaba ubicado ese paso ferroviario. Ambos resultaron fallecidos, un portugués de 37 años y un ciudadano Indio de 40. El convoy arrastró al coche casi 800 metros.\nEntre las causas más probables del accidente está la de que los ocupantes del vehículo no respetaron la señal de Stop por un despiste.\nEn la jornada siguiente, Comisiones Obreras anunció se personará en el procedimiento judicial sobre este accidente laboral para investigar posibles fallos de seguridad. Según anunció Juan Carlos González, secretario de Salud Laboral en Palencia, durante una concentración en señal de duelo organizada por el sindicato CCOO busca esclarecer las causas del siniestro y garantizar que se cumplan las normativas de prevención en el ámbito laboral.\nA buen seguro tendrán también algo que decir sobre este otro caso, conocido en la jornada de hoy.\nLa Guardia Civil de Palencia ha destapado un caso, cuanto menos sorprendente, de explotación laboral en las obras de la Línea de Alta Velocidad entre Palencia y Santander. Un trabajador contratado para realizar “otras actividades de limpieza” durante 20 horas semanales terminó desempeñando funciones de vigilancia y control de acceso durante 108 horas semanales, viviendo en condiciones extremadamente precarias.\nUna caseta como \"hogar\" improvisado\nEl empleado dormía en una caseta prefabricada ubicada en la misma zona de trabajo. Ante las bajas temperaturas, sus propios compañeros le instalaron un aparato de aire acondicionado para calentar el espacio, además de facilitarle un baño portátil químico para cubrir sus necesidades básicas. Esta situación se descubrió durante una visita de vigilancia de la Guardia Civil, encargada de supervisar las obras tanto por seguridad como para garantizar el cumplimiento de las normativas laborales.\nEn cifras\n108Horas semanales llegó a hacer este trabajador\nTras detectar estas condiciones, la Guardia Civil notificó a la Inspección Provincial de Trabajo y Seguridad Social de Palencia. Días después, se realizó una inspección conjunta que confirmó las graves irregularidades en el contrato y las condiciones de trabajo del empleado. Según las investigaciones, el trabajador nunca debió realizar tareas de vigilancia, y mucho menos bajo un horario que sextuplicaba lo estipulado en su contrato de 20 horas.\nConsecuencias legales\nLa empresa investigada ahora enfrenta un expediente sancionador por infracción muy grave de las normas laborales, según ha informado la Inspección Provincial de Trabajo. Además, las diligencias han sido remitidas al Juzgado de Instrucción Nº1 de Palencia, que determinará las responsabilidades penales de la compañía.\nLa Guardia Civil, además de investigar estos casos, recuerda a la ciudadanía que es vital denunciar cualquier tipo de abuso laboral. Para ello, ha puesto a disposición su línea de emergencias 062 y la aplicación móvil ALERTCOPS, que permite informar de incidencias y recibir alertas de seguridad en tiempo real.",
