    "text": "Marin County sees evacuation orders lifted in some areas In Marin County, evacuation orders have been canceled for areas around Stinson Beach. Earlier Thursday, some communities near the beach were told to be ready to go due to high surf and storm surge.\nSANTA CRUZ, Calif. - The Bay Area&apos;s beach towns got hammered on Thursday as high surf and storm surges ravaged the coastline.\nAround Santa Cruz, seaside streets were littered with debris, soaked with flooding, and battered by big waves. The city closed the Santa Cruz Wharf, Main Beach and Cowell Beach because of the massive waves and resulting damage.\nAt Rio Del Mar State Beach in Santa Cruz, logs littered the sandy coast and onlookers sat on perches witnessing Mother Nature in action.\nIn addition, West Cliff in Santa Cruz was also closed between Columbia and David Way. The iconic road is still being repaired from last year&apos;s storms.\nMeanwhile, in Pacifica, a pair of crab fishers arrived at Linda Mar Beach and then turned around to go home.\n\"Apparently, that&apos;s not going to happen,\" Paul Gonzales said. \"But the pier&apos;s closed. These waves are outrageous.\"\nSteve Ramirez sighed and said: \"We&apos;re just going to pack up.\"\nHigh surf warnings and advisories are in effect along the entire California coast as waves are expected to break up to 40 feet high. As of Thursday afternoon, reports from the Bay Area&apos;s coastal buoys were showing waves just under 30 feet off both the Sonoma County coast and Monterey Bay.\nHuge low-pressure systems in the Pacific Ocean are pushing large groups of waves toward the California coast.\nThe National Weather Service reported that its buoy off Bodega Bay recorded waves up to 28 feet on Thursday morning, closing in on the previous record of 31 feet seen during January storms at the beginning of the year.\nEvacuation warnings lifted after high surf and flooding shut down Santa Cruz, coastal areas Around Santa Cruz, seaside streets were littered with debris, soaked with flooding, and battered by big waves. The city closed the Santa Cruz Wharf, Main Beach and Cowell Beach because of the massive waves and resulting damage.\nAt Rio Del Mar Beach, the waves crashed over walls, flooding streets, and depositing massive trees and driftwood ashore.\n\"The trees act like battering rams against the houses and the garage doors that are along the street here,\" says resident, Steve Benedetti.\nResidents in Santa Cruz County know the danger all too well. So do the authorities. But they worried about the tourists.\n\"We do have visitors from out of town that may not have been expecting this kind of tidal surge during their visit. So we did have deputies out here very early going door to door explaining to people hey this is coming,\" says Ashley Keehn, public information officer with the Santa Cruz County Sheriff&apos;s Office.\nEarly in the morning, the Stinson Beach Fire Department issued an evacuation order for several neighborhoods because of high surf as the winds and waves were enormous, telling people they could find a temporary safe harbor at the Stinson Beach Community Center.\nThe order was issued just before 10 a.m., and people were sent to the Stinson Beach Community Center for refuge. Residents in the Calles Pinos, Pradero, Sierra, Onda Resaca, Ribera, Embarcadero, and sections of Calle Del Arroyo weren’t told to return to their homes until early in the afternoon.\nDrone pilot David Golubev shot video of the swell hitting the beach around 11 a.m. and getting dangerously close to houses and buildings along the shoreline.\n\"Definitely the highest tide I’ve seen so far. You could see it on the beach. It came up all the way to the top,\" Golubev said. \"I saw it was high tide, and I heard the water so I came out to see how far the water came up.\"\nOfficials said the waves reached 10 feet, more than the National Weather Service predicted.\nThe evacuation order was lifted in the early afternoon when the tide receded.\nStinson Beach Fire Chief Jesse Peri said crews are still assessing the damage in the area and at last count Thursday afternoon one person has minor injuries and a handful of homes suffered minor structural damage.\n\"The community is really resilient, so they came together to help sandbag and help each other out,\" said Peri, who reiterated that people should continue to stay away from the water.\nFurther south in San Francisco, strong swells crashed against San Francisco&apos;s Fort Point.\nImage 1 of 10 ▼ Rio Del Mar Esplanade is currently flooded in Santa Cruz on Dec. 28, 2023.

There was a couple of vehicles – one parked up.\n“You couldn’t see the (other) vehicle. It was 3ft beneath the water.\n“I helped get it out on to the riverbank with three other tractors.”\nTwo other locals, Rosie and Andrew Dale, said they were with Mr Ford when he got the call to help.\nThey said they saw several 4×4 vehicles pass their home in the direction of the ford shortly before the incident.\nMrs Dale said “nobody local” would attempt to cross the ford in the current conditions.\nThe area is popular with 4×4 drivers, she said, adding: “In the summer you get 10 of them at a time.”\nNUMBERPLATE PIXELLATED BY PA PICTURE DESK AT REQUEST OF NORTH YORKSHIRE POLICE The recovered vehicle being removed from the River Esk (Danny Lawson/PA) A spokesperson for North Yorkshire Police said: “Localised conditions across our area are making driving hazardous.\n“Roads are particularly badly affected around the River Esk, to the north of the county, as we have seen with the tragic incident near Glaisdale.\n“There was another incident at nearby Houlsyke at 12.49pm when a car got stuck in flood water and another at Kirby Wiske in Hambleton at 2.35pm.\n“Thankfully, the occupants of both vehicles were brought to safety.\n“The key advice is to consider whether your journey is necessary.\n“Please avoid driving through any kind of standing or moving flood water if you possibly can.”\nWitnesses to the incident at Glaisdale are urged to call North Yorkshire Police on 101, option 4, quoting reference NYP-28122023-0146.",

    "text": "A man walks in flood water in Tuscany Region, Italy, Nov 3, 2023. [Photo/Xinhua] ROME -- Italy has experienced a record-setting number of extreme weather events in 2023, a year that is set to be the warmest in more than 150 years, reports said on Thursday.\nAccording to the climate observatory run by the environmental lobby group Legambiente, Italy reported 378 severe weather events in 2023, an increase of 22 percent compared to last year -- ranging from heatwaves to drought and from hailstorms to floods and extreme winds, which were directly responsible for at least 31 deaths.\nOn the other hand, the agriculture sector union Coldiretti said there were more than nine harsh weather events per day this year across Italy's boot-shaped peninsula.\nIn its report, Coldiretti estimated that extreme weather caused a record 6 billion euros ($6.6 billion) of damages to crops and agricultural infrastructure, leading to shortfalls in the country's production of olive oil, peaches, nectarines and wheat.\nLegambiente said its calculations showed that the northern part of the country was hit the hardest, with 210 separate extreme weather events, followed by 98 in the central regions and 70 in the south which includes the island regions of Sicily and Sardinia.\nAmong the extreme weather events were floods, record high temperatures, rain-triggered landslides and hailstorms, it said.\nMuch of Europe suffered a long and dry summer and multiple severe weather events this year, but Italy is often hit harder due to its long coastline and exposure to the sea on two coasts. Meteorological data indicate that this year is set to be the warmest in more than 150 years of record-keeping in Italy.\nMeanwhile, weather agencies predict the year will end with an unusually warm spell, with high daytime temperatures across much of the Italian peninsula, assuring that 2024 will start out on the warm side.",

    "text": "State wildlife officials are trying to track down two people who illegally released about 25 turkeys about 110 miles north of Las Vegas.\nOn April 9, officials found the turkeys at Key Pittman Wildlife Management Area, which is home to Nesbitt Lake and more than 24 species of ducks. It’s also a frequent pit stop for migratory birds.\nThe turkeys were either domesticated or wild ones that had been captured and fed, Game Division Administrator Shawn Espinosa said in a statement. Either way, they all would have likely been eaten by predators or died from natural causes, he said.\n“That brings up a myriad of concerns not the least of which is disease,” Espinosa said. “They could have any number of diseases that could be devastating to the wild bird population in the area.”\nGame wardens believe that those responsible are from Clark County because they came from the south and left that way. The wardens found photos of a truck and trailer from a convenience store’s security footage and are asking the public to notify them with any information.\n“Any information could be key to this investigation,” Game Warden Lieutenant John Anderson said in a statement.\nTo provide information to the Nevada Department of Wildlife, people may call its hotline at 1-800-992-3030 or submit an anonymous tip using the department’s Tip app, available for download on any mobile device.\nContact Alan at ahalaly@reviewjournal.com.

    "text": "En todo un cruce de declaraciones se ha convertido la denuncia presentada por la ministra del Trabajo, Gloria Inés Ramírez , en la que señala a la compañía condiciones en las que estas mujeres ejercen sus labores no son las mejores . Por ejemplo, no tienen el tiempo para ir al baño”. Ese relato contrasta con la afirmación de Guardado Castro, quien dijo: “ De paso invito a la ministra para que venga aquí a nuestra planta, para que vea cómo se trabaja aquí, y para que mire, se cerciore, y ella pueda mirar que es mentira todo lo que se dice”. La denuncia contra Van Camp’s surgió a partir de la visita del Ministerio del Trabajo a esa empresa y del relato de la trabajadora Alicia Cardiles , quien dio el testimonio afirmando que sus empleadores les estarían descontando de su salario laboral el tiempo que se tardan en ir al baño.Cardiles aseguró que “esta empresa nos está obligando a utilizar paños desechables porque nos descuentan en los salarios la ida al baño . Eso nos está produciendo, a futuro, enfermedades a nuestro aparato reproductor, infecciones urinarias que a futuro se nos puede volver cáncer. Entonces, por eso, no más violación a los derechos de las mujeres”.Pues bien, la versión de esa colaboradora de Van Camp’s contrasta con el testimonio de Marta Lucía Guardado Castro, quien la señaló directamente de estar mintiendo. “Así que la invito nuevamente a la ministra. Llegue aquí a nuestra planta, que la atendemos con mucho cariño, para que usted vea cómo se trabaja aquí en la familia Van Camp’s”, sostuvo la mujer que señaló a Alicia Cardiles de estar mintiendo en su denuncia.El Ministerio del Trabajo hizo pública su denuncia sobre los casos de acoso laboral que habría encontrado en empresas pesqueras y de flores que se enfocan en contratar mujeres como su principal mano de obra. No obstante, hasta el mediodía de este jueves (28 de diciembre) no había presentado pruebas al respecto.La compañía Seatech Internacional Inc., que tiene la planta de atún en Cartagena, desmintió lo publicado por la funcionaria Gloria Inés Ramírez y anunció que tomará acciones legales contra el Gobierno.Según dijo esa corporación en un comunicado, “la compañía y sus 1.800 colaboradores reiteran que lo señalado no es cierto y procederá a defenderse de este ataque bajo, conforme a la ley”. Otra versión que salió a flote en medio del cruce de declaraciones entre el Gobierno, la empresa y las trabajadoras de Van Camp’s, fue la del sindicato Sintramar Cartagena, que publicó un comunicado en el que detalló que “no es cierto que a las trabajadoras no se les deja ir al baño a hacer sus necesidades. No sabemos de dónde salió esa información que a todas luces es malintencionada”.",

    "text": "Marin high school students interested in a career in health care could receive early professional training from a program to be launched next year.\nThe pilot course, to be offered in the spring at San Marin High School in Novato, is being developed by the Marin County Office of Education, the Novato Unified School District and By the Bay Health, a nonprofit regional hospice program based in Larkspur.“We are excited to partner with By the Bay Health, one of the most innovative health care providers in Marin County, on this critical initiative to develop a thriving health care workforce to adequately support our growing community,” said John Carroll, the county superintendent of schools.“Introducing students at an earlier age to the diversity of options in the health care field is key,” Carroll said. “By bringing real-world experience and clinical expertise into the classroom, we can expose students to additional career options that will create a tangible impact in our community.”The program, called “Introduction to the World of Healthcare,” will be offered as an elective to 11th and 12th graders at San Marin High School. The curriculum will include subjects such as medical ethics, public health and emerging trends in the profession, according to Jesse Madsen, a career education administrator at the county office.The program will also include hands-on skill practice, role playing, field trips and certification opportunities, Madsen said.The effort is the first step in By the Bay Health’s plan to create “a public and academic partnership aiming to raise $1 million to develop a skilled, compassionate workforce to serve the North Bay’s aging population,” Madsen said.“Our biggest barrier to ensuring access to high quality, accessible care in the home to meet the needs of an increasingly diverse and growing population of children and adults in Marin County is recruiting exceptional talent,” said Skelly Wingard, chief executive officer at By the Bay Health. “We are optimistic this partnership with MCOE will inspire more students to join the\ncontinuum of care — particularly in areas like home-based palliative care, hospice care and home health care.”Tracy Smith, superintendent of the Novato Unified School District, said the district is “thrilled” to be a part of the project.“Students are hungry for knowledge about careers where they can find meaning and purpose,” Smith said. “Based on the positive reception to the new course, we’re excited to support this initiative to build more interest in growing fields such as health care.”Madsen said the program will add to related medical career classes at Novato and Terra Linda high schools.In addition to general health care training, the program will have an added focus on nursing and home health professionals. Those workers are in short supply in Marin and throughout the Bay Area, Madsen said.“By 2030, California’s population of individuals aged 65 and older will reach 9 million, nearly 20% of the state’s residents,” Madsen said. “Marin County ranks 13th in the state for this age demographic at 22.3%.”The pilot program could also offer a model of how Marin employers and K-12 schools could work together to provide courses within the school day that lead to “high-demand, livable-wage careers,” Madsen said.“We think this model can be replicated with additional local health care providers and employers in other industry sectors, supporting the development of a homegrown workforce and expanding career pathway opportunities for our students,” he said.By the Bay Health, a nonprofit affiliate of UCSF Health, operates in Marin, San Francisco, San Mateo, Sonoma, Alameda, Napa and Solano counties. The organization offers hospice and skilled home health care, palliative care, grief support and pediatric care.",

    "text": "Higher admission prices for foreigners at countless attractions across Thailand are a longtime complaint. The Ministry of Tourism and Sports has pledged to address concerns raised by foreign tourists, including dual pricing, following recent complaints on the Bangkok Post Learning Facebook page.\nMinister Sorawong Thienthong made the pledge after a meeting prompted by a social media article titled “Where Have Foreign Tourists Gone?” published on April 24. The article compiled and translated into Thai the views of foreign tourists and expatriates in response to a story in the Bangkok Post.\nThe news story, “Thailand faces lower tourist numbers”, was also published on April 22 on the Facebook page of Bangkok Post Learning, where it drew more than 1,800 comments about a variety of issues .\nThe views highlighted concerns about safety, assault , overcharging, threats from transnational criminal groups in tourist areas, and extortion — factors that may be contributing to the decline in international arrivals to Thailand.\nMr Sorawong said that every case involving foreign tourists will now be reported directly from the police to him.\nTourists can submit requests for help via the Thailand Tourist Police application, and a tourist assistance centre has been set up in every province to support visitors.\nResponding to complaints about expensive accommodation, he said that this is often due to seasonal price adjustments, while the rise in airfares is a global issue that has been caused by a shortage of aircraft.\nThe ministry has pledged to address tourism scams and ensure fair prices for both Thai and foreign tourists, which means the dual-pricing system will be eliminated, said Mr Sorawong.\nVocabulary assault : attacking someone violently - การทำร้ายร่างกาย complaint : when someone says that something is wrong or not satisfactory - การร้องเรียน dual-pricing : charging one group of people a different price than another - eliminate : to get rid of completely - กำจัดหรือขจัดให้หมดไป expatriate (expat) : a person living in a country that is not their own - คนที่อาศัยอยู่ต่างประเทศ (เป็นเวลานาน) extortion : the crime of trying to obtain something by force or threat - การขู่กรรโชก รีดไถ issue : a problem that needs to be considered - ประเด็น overcharge (verb) : to ask for too much money for the product or service you are selling - คิดเงินแพงเกินไป pledge : a serious promise - คำมั่้นสัญญา pledge : to make a serious promise to do something - สัญญา prompted : caused - ก่อให้เกิด scam : a dishonest plan, especially for getting money - กลโกง, แผนร้าย seasonal : typical of or suitable for the time of year - ตามฤดูกาล threat : a danger - อันตราย transnational : involving more than one country; present in more than one country - ข้ามชาติ",
