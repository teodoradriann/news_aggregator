    "text": "The Pune Division of the Central Railway on Thursday issued a show cause notice to two contractors for failing to respond to authorities over the non-payment of salary to the cleaning staff and the denial of essential safety equipment. Shadab Jamal, Senior Divisional Mechanical Engineer (Sr. DME) at Pune Division, said the contractors were first issued a notice with a deadline of September 12. However, they missed the deadline. \"We have served a show cause notice to the contracting agency and they have to respond within seven days. The agency has submitted a complaint letter to us, demanding action against the workers, as the agency claims to be facing losses due to their strike.\" The strike by the workers started on Monday, September 9. They have decided not to clean the trains across all three washing centres of the Pune railway division. Meanwhile, the division has temporarily assigned workers from an alternate contracting agency to clean the trains. \"The fault lies with the contractors as they have not met the workers' minimum wage requirements. So how can the workers be expected to work? This has led to unrest and dissatisfaction among the cleaning staff,\" added Jamal. As previously stated regarding the termination of contractors who fail to meet deadlines, Jamal mentioned that according to the procedure, contractors are given a total of 14 days to respond. He said, \"The first seven days serve as a performance notice, followed by another seven-day notice.\" Attempts by The Indian Express to contact both contractors from the agency went unanswered.",

    "text": "Orthodox priests in Moldova rebel against Moscow rule Long torn between loyalty to the Russian or Romanian Orthodox Church, the Moldovan village of Cimiseni has made its choice, triggered by Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. The parish in the village near the capital Chisinau, whose 2,850 inhabitants mostly speak Romanian, is one of a growing number that have switched allegiance from Moscow to Bucharest. The divorce mirrors the former Soviet Republic’s bigger struggle as it seeks to leave behind Russia’s influence and join the European Union. “This fight between Orthodox brothers has outraged people,” priest Ioan Solonaru told AFP, referring to the war in Ukraine. Parishioners “started to tell me that they no longer wanted to come to Kirill’s church to receive communion”, said Solonaru, referring to Patriarch Kirill of Moscow, the leader of Russia’s Orthodox Church and a staunch supporter of the invasion. The reception of Ukrainian refugees pouring over the border has also raised awareness in Moldova. Since the invasion, more than 50 parishes have switched allegiance from Moscow to Bucharest, according to Moldova’s Romania-linked Metropolis of Bessarabia. “Nothing unites us with Moscow any more,” said the 55-year-old Solonaru, incredulous at “the nostalgia of some people for the USSR”. – ‘Lost sons’ – In a recent letter, Metropolitan Vladimir, head of the Russia-linked Metropolitanate of Moldova, expressed concern about the departure of priests. He wrote to patriarch Kirill of the “marginalisation” of his church “because of its membership in the Moscow Patriarchate, perceived in Moldovan society as an outpost of the Kremlin”. The Moldovan people aspire to get closer to Romania, he suggested, asking for a solution to “end the crisis”. A meeting of the highest dignitaries — held following the letter — decided to maintain their allegiance to Moscow. Around 1,350 parishes in Moldova are Moscow-linked, far more than some 200 with allegiance to Romania. “We do not feel in danger,” Ioan of Soroca, vicar of the Metropolitanate of Moldova, told AFP. The Metropolitanate of Moldova has condemned the war in Ukraine — though not Kirill — with Bishop Ioan describing those who left as “lost sons (who) must come to their senses”. Metropolitan Vladimir said this week that their actions were “reckless”. – ‘Pro-European signal’ – Russia’s invasion of its neighbour in February 2022 has accelerated the pro-European drive in the country of 2.6 million people, situated between Ukraine and EU member Romania. The Metropolis of Bessarabia is receiving newcomers “with open arms”, according to spokesman Constantin Olariu, just as Moldova is preparing to open accession negotiations with the EU. “It’s a pro-European signal,” he said, adding that his church had to resume its activities “from scratch” in 1992 following Moldova’s independence. President Maia Sandu sent a similar message, calling in a recent radio interview on “all of society, including the Church” to unite for “peace” on the path to European integration. The war has also sowed division among Orthodox Christians in neighbouring Ukraine. In October, Ukrainian lawmakers advanced legislation to ban the Moscow-linked Ukrainian Orthodox Church — which says it has severed ties with Russia since May 2022. Ukraine also passed legislation to move its official Christmas holiday to December 25, in a break with the Russian Orthodox Church that celebrates it on January 7. Ukraine had been under Moscow’s spiritual leadership since the 17th century at the latest, but part of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church broke with Moscow in 2019 over Russia’s annexation of Crimea and its support for separatists in the east of Ukraine.

    "title": "Weld County DA will not charge DNA analyst, says data 'anomalies' did not affect criminal cases | News | denvergazette.com",
    "text": "A DNA analyst who was fired and faced a criminal investigation after \"anomalies\" were discovered with her work will not be charged with a crime, the Weld County District Attorney's Office announced Thursday. Chiara Wuensch was fired on Feb. 28 from her position at the Northern Colorado Regional Forensic Lab after more than 10 years working there after an internal investigation identified \"anomalies\" in her case work. The lab is overseen by the Weld County Sheriffs office. Now, the DA's office has determined there is not probable cause that Wuensch committed a crime. A review of Wuensch's work by the DA's office revealed only five anomalies, according to the release. These fell into three categories as identified by the DA's office: Alleged deletion of data indicating a small amount of male DNA, alleged addition of the word “undetermined” to a cell in a spreadsheet, and alleged alteration of values related to potential contamination to a smaller number. The evidence against Wuensch did not find criminal intent in the data anomalies, according to the release. According to the release, she said there was no reason for her to intentionally change the data because she still performed DNA amplification required by standard operating procedures. The DA's office said this was confirmed by the Colorado Bureau of Investigations (CBI), the lead agency investigating Wuensch's work. CBI also said the anomalies in Wuensch's work did not impact any DNA identification or elimination in criminal cases. In a May 23 interview, the DA's office said Wuensch denied altering or deleting the data on purpose and said the discrepancies could be the result of mistakes in using Excel. “After a comprehensive review of all the evidence and circumstances, it is clear that the anomalies found in Ms. Wuensch’s work do not meet the legal threshold for criminal charges,” Weld County District Attorney Michael Rourke said in the news release. “The evidence does not support a finding of criminal intent, and therefore, it would be inappropriate to pursue charges in this matter.” It's unclear if these findings will affect Wuensch's termination. The issues with Wuensch’s casework surfaced because of a separate CBI investigation into its own employees, the Weld County Sheriff's Office said. In March, the [CBI announced a criminal investigation](https://denvergazette.com/colorado-watch/cbi-missy-woods-internal-affairs-report-released/article_1c01c7f2-2369-11ef-bd72-db2aa32fcc81.html) after it said it discovered that its scientist Yvonne \"Missy\" Woods intentionally cut corners and didn’t follow standard DNA testing protocols, raising questions about hundreds of criminal cases in which she processed evidence. The bureau said Woods was placed on leave after it became aware of irregularities in her work in September 2023, and she resigned before its internal review was completed. State crime lab employees for years repeatedly tried to warn their superiors at CBI that Woods had become a rogue employee who was cutting corners. But officials failed to respond forcefully until last year, when an intern at the lab found new anomalies, an internal affairs investigation found. As the regional liaison for Rourke's office from the Colorado Bureau of Investigation, Woods performed DNA work on many is his cases [including a 45-year-old murder case](https://denvergazette.com/news/dna-cbi-missy-woods/article_d3a17f6a-e63d-11ee-bcba-1f9e2816e47d.html) out of Weld County. In that case, James Dye, 66, faces charges in connection to the rape and murder of Evelyn “Kay” Day, an Aim’s Community College teacher whose body was found five days after Thanksgiving 1979 sexually assaulted and strangled with the belt from her own jacket. He was not arrested until 2021 after his DNA matched the profile found from spermatozoa found on Day’s body, her coat, pantyhose, underwear, pants and the belt. The case was dormant until 2011 when technology had advanced enough to identify DNA from Day’s husband, Chuck, on the belt which strangled her. Though the sperm found on Day’s body did not match that of Chuck Day, he was considered a suspect in his wife’s murder but was never arrested, according to a January 2024 Supreme Court filing. It wasn’t until 2020 that the DNA found on Day’s clothing and body was resubmitted to the Combined DNA Index System, or CODIS, and matched the DNA profile to Dye, a ex-convict living in Wichita. During a February 2022 preliminary hearing, Dye’s attorneys argued that Chuck Day was an alternate suspect, as the couple was reported to have been having marital struggles. Still, during the evidentiary hearing, Woods testified that Day’s finger clippings samples showed it was 17 trillion times more likely to be her and Dye’s DNA rather than that of Day and an unidentified person. Rourke said that he was worried that uncertainty which looms around Wood’s results in the Day murder will impact the work of other forensic scientists and thus make more work for prosecutors as they scramble to retest evidence. Dye's next hearing is July 1. There's no word as to when a trial may happen.

    "text": "LOS ANGELES – Donovan Mitchell and the Cleveland Cavaliers silenced the young guns of Orlando, beating the Magic 106-94 in Game 7 of their NBA playoffs first-round series Sunday (Monday Manila time) to book a meeting with Eastern Conference top seed Boston.\nIt was another magisterial performance from Mitchell, who scored 39 points two days after pouring in 50 in the Cavs' Ggaame 6 defeat.\nThis time he had plenty of scoring support from teammates as the Cavs erased an 18-point second-quarter deficit to clinch a series in which the home team won every game.\nCaris LeVert scored 15 points off the bench and Max Strus scored 11 of his 13 points in the third quarter, when the Cavs out-scored the Magic 33-15 to take charge.\nEvan Mobley scored 11 points with 16 rebounds and five blocked shots and Darius Garland chipped in 12 points to help Cleveland withstand a 38-point performance from Paolo Banchero.\nThe Cavs, with starting center Jarrett Allen sidelined a third straight game with bruised ribs, moved on to the second round a year after a stinging first-round loss to the New York Knicks.\n\"I didn't want to go home,\" Mitchell said of the mindset that saw him score 17 points in the third quarter as he virtually willed Cleveland to the lead.\nThe Magic delivered a strong first punch, Banchero scoring 10 points in the first period as Orlando grabbed a 24-18.\nIn the face of Orlando's suffocating defense the Cavs connected on just six of 22 shots in the first quarter and didn't make a 3-pointer until Sam Merrill drilled one midway through the second quarter.\nThe Magic pushed their lead to as many as 18 points in the second quarter before the Cavs clawed back to cut the lead to single digits.\nBanchero's layup in the closing seconds of the first half saw Orlando take a 10-point lead into the break, but momentum was on Cleveland's side and they overwhelmed the Magic in the third.\n\"I didn't feel our confidence waver much, even when we had 18 points in the first quarter,\" Mitchell said.\n\"They came out and jumped on us,\" he added, saying the key was for the Cavs \"to respond the way we did, keep plugging, just keep chipping away.\"\nMitchell, again relentless in the paint, tied it at 64-64 with a floater and LeVert drained a pair of free throws to give the Cavs their first lead since the first quarter.\nStrus hit back-to-back 3-pointers as Cleveland built a 76-68 lead going into the final period.\nThe Cavs pushed their advantage to 14 points in the final frame, fans chanting \"We want Boston\" as the final minutes ticked off.\nOne goal accomplished The Celtics will host Game 1 of their Eastern Conference semi-final series on Tuesday (Wednesday Manila time), and Mitchell vowed the Cavaliers will be ready for the team that posted the best record in the regular season.\n\"We didn't make the group we made just to win the first round,\" he said. \"We accomplished one goal. Now we have to do it again.\"\nIt was a crushing end to a strong season for the Magic, collectively the second-youngest team in the playoffs behind the Oklahoma City Thunder.\nWendell Carter Jr. scored 13 points and Jalen Suggs added 10 for the Magic, but Franz Wagner was held to just six as Orlando remained in search of a first playoff series victory since 2010.\nMitchell heaped praise 21-year-old Banchero, the top pick in the 2022 draft.\nBanchero himself said the Magic's fight back from 0-2 down in the series to force Game 7 \"just shows where we're headed.\"",
