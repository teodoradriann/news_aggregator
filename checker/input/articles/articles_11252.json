    "text": "EAST BRAINERD, Tenn. — [Tornadoes struck middle Tennessee earlier this month](https://newschannel9.com/news/local/2023-tennessee-tornadoes-deadly-lives-lost-fourth-clarksville-tornado-victim-dies-from-injuries-local-reports-say-montgomery-county-middle-tn), killing seven people and and injuring many others. Those tornadoes also damaged buildings and knocked out power for thousands of people. Those storms, as well as others in our area, have left residents looking for ways to stay safe. Thursday we spoke to someone who has experienced disaster first hand about what you can add to your home to protect yourself and your family. So that when severe weather strikes, you'll be prepared. Building a storm shelter came as a no-brainer for East Brainerd Resident Michael Herston. In 2020 his home was considered a “total devastation” from [ the Easter tornados.](https://newschannel9.com/news/local/severe-weather-causes-major-local-damage-late-sunday-night) \"For me, it's not even an option. Whatever the costs, that's safety and security. That's first for us,\" says Herston. He brought in a whole team of structural engineers and designers to provide the safest and sturdiest structure for his family. “I mean, it's your life. It's your life or a few 1,000 bucks. I'm going to spend the money on saving a life,\" Herston says. But Chattanooga Realtor Dawn O'Neil says it's a costly addition. \"With the housing market, the way we have it, it's just hard to justify putting another $10,000 into a storm shelter,\" says O'Neil. But it's not the only way. She says there are more convenient options that home builders are including other than a concrete shelter. \"A lot of builders put doors underneath staircases, things like that. That is great for storage, but it's also great for a place to go if you don't have a basement,\" O'Neil says. Just a few weeks ago, tornadoes raged through Middle Tennessee, bringing storm shelters back to top of mind for homeowners in Chattanooga. “Especially with the tornadoes that just happened and being so close in proximity, I think that's something that people are aware of,\" says O'Neil. But the building of storm shelters hits closer to home. “In 2020 when the storms came to Holly Hills, I think that was something that people, when they were looking at homes, were interested in and it was kind of in the forefront of their mind,\" O'Neil says. Including homeowner Michael Herston. \"Going forward, I'll never have a house again that doesn't have one,\" Herston says. Data from the National Weather Service shows that the average yearly tornado total since 1950 has been 19 per year. However, the average yearly total since 1995 is higher, reaching 32 tornadoes per year on average.",

    "title": "Man killed by car driven into crowd was ‘Good Samaritan’ helping a stranger | This Is Local London",
    "text": "A father-of-two who died after a car ploughed in a crowd of people during disturbance was a Good Samaritan who was trying to help a stranger, police have said. On Thursday night, South Yorkshire Police named the 46-year-old man who died in the incident in College Close, in the Burngreave area of Sheffield, as Christian Marriott. The force said Mr Marriott, who was known as Chris, was out for a post-Christmas walk with his wife and two young sons, aged eight and six, when he went to the aid of a woman he spotted lying unconscious in the street just after 2pm on Wednesday. Officers believe he left his family and stopped to provide first aid to the woman, before a car then collided with them both and a number of others. It is believed the woman had been involved in an altercation and several other people suffered injuries during the incident, including an off-duty midwife who had also stopped to help. Detective Chief Inspector Andrew Knowles said: “This is an utterly heartbreaking case in which a Good Samaritan, who had stepped in to help a stranger in their time of need, has lost his life. “Chris leaves behind a loving family including his devastated wife and two young sons. We are absolutely determined to secure justice for Chris and his loved ones following this horrific tragedy.” Two men arrested in connection with the incident – one on suspicion of murder – remain in custody, the force said. Burngreave residents said the incident happened outside a house at the junction of College Close and College Court – two quiet cul-de-sacs of modern houses near Sheffield’s Northern General Hospital. Police had already been called to a violent disturbance in the street when the car ploughed into those gathered outside. Neighbours said the altercation was related to some kind of dispute between two families. Mr Knowles said: “Increased patrols will continue in the area in the coming days and local people will continue to see officers carrying out inquiries, including going house to house to gather witness statements. “There are people in that community who hold information which is vital to our investigation and have not yet given statements. “I want to be able to get to the bottom of what happened for Chris and his family. I need those people with information to do the right thing. If you don’t want to talk to us directly, you can use Crimestoppers and remain 100% anonymous.” A 23-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder and a 55-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. Both remained in custody on Thursday night. A police spokeswoman said the woman Mr Marriott was helping remains in hospital in a life-threatening condition. She said the off-duty midwife suffered minor injuries, another man received serious injuries which are not believed to be life-threatening and four further people – three women and a man – suffered minor injuries. Tarek Nayli, 49, said he came out of his nearby home to see fighting in the street, a number of injured people and neighbours telling him there were others trapped under a car. Mr Nayli said: “I heard a lot of sound, a lot of voices, a lot of shouting. “When I came out, I found people all gathering around and people fighting. “One guy had a lot of blood on his face.” Mr Nayli said the car involved was already there by the time he became aware of the incident and the police arrived two minutes after he did. He said: “I saw people fighting on that corner before the police came and the car was already there. “The whole neighbourhood was out.” He said: “They said there were people underneath the car and when the police came they managed to get them out. “When the police came, they flipped the car over and they’ve taken two people out.” Mr Nayli said one injured man was already sitting beside the car and a woman was also clearly hurt. Asked about the fighting he saw, he said: “I didn’t see any weapons but there was a lot of hitting and one guy had a stick.” Mr Nayli said he only found out later that someone had died. He said: “It was very, very sad and also very upsetting and I couldn’t believe it. “All of a sudden you find people dead and a very big crime. This is a disaster.” On Thursday morning, police continued to guard an extensive cordon around the close, which about a mile and a half from the city centre. The cordon was dropped later in the day as forensic officers and detectives continued their inquiries in the small semi-detached property.

    "title": "Trump Wants Even Looser AI Guardrails. Why California, Despite Passing Over 20 AI Bills This Year, Might Not Push Back – The Markup",
    "text": "The Markup, now a part of CalMatters, uses investigative reporting, data analysis, and software engineering to challenge technology to serve the public good. Sign up for [Klaxon](https://mrkup.org/XvjZS), a newsletter that delivers our stories and tools directly to your inbox.\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom is preparing to wage a legal war against President-elect Donald Trump, convening a special legislative session next month [to try to “Trump-proof” the state](https://calmatters.org/politics/capitol/2024/11/gavin-newsom-special-session-trump-resistance/). But it appears that artificial intelligence safeguards won’t initially be in the fight, even though California’s legislature had placed a major focus on AI regulations this year.\nTrump has promised to immediately rescind President Joe Biden’s executive order that had imposed voluntary AI guardrails on tech companies and federal agencies. The president-elect’s administration could also, immigrant advocates say, use AI tools to assist the mass deportation he has pledged to implement.\nEarlier this year, California legislators passed more than [a dozen bills regulating artificial intelligence](https://calmatters.org/economy/technology/2024/09/california-ai-safety-regulations-bills/), curbing the use of algorithms on children, limiting the use of deepfakes, and more. But Gov. Newsroom [vetoed](https://calmatters.org/economy/2024/09/california-artificial-intelligence-bill-veto/) the most ambitious — and contentious bill — that [would have required](https://digitaldemocracy.calmatters.org/bills/ca_202320240sb1047) testing of AI models to determine whether they would likely lead to mass death, endanger public infrastructure or enable severe cyberattacks.\nThere are signs, though, that AI could — in the not-so-distant future — go from abstract concern to prominent political cudgel between the Trump administration and California’s Democratic leaders. It could be another high-profile way to challenge Trump and his newfound tech allies, some of whom have gleefully proclaimed a new, deregulated era for artificial intelligence products.\n“I think Newsom and the California Legislature have an opportunity to step into the gap that the federal government is leaving — to create a model environment for safe and rights-respecting technology and deployment,” said Janet Haven, executive director of the Data & Society Research Institute, a nonprofit that studies the social implications of AI and other technologies. “On the other hand, there’s no way to get around the fact that Big Tech is right there, and will be a huge factor in whatever the California Legislature and Newsom want to advance in terms of AI legislation.”\n[↩︎ link](#why-california-lawmakers-and-others-worry-about-ai)\nWhy California lawmakers and others worry about AI\nAI safety advocates told CalMatters they’re not necessarily sweating the apocalyptic AI nightmares imagined by some doomsayers. Instead, they are focused on how AI tools are increasingly used in healthcare, housing, the labor force, law enforcement, immigration, the military, as well as other industries and fields prone to discrimination, surveillance, and civil rights violations — because there’s evidence that such tools can be [unwieldy, inaccurate, and invasive](https://calmatters.org/economy/technology/2024/06/face-recognition-technology-california/). “We have documentation that shows how these AI systems are likely to do all sorts of things—they’re pattern-making systems, they’re not really decision-makers, but the private sector and the public sector are using them as a substitute for decision-makers,” said Samantha Gordon, chief program officer at TechEquity. “That’s not wise.”\nSanta Ana Democratic Sen. Tom Umberg told CalMatters that 2024 “was a bit of a testing year” for AI bills. California lawmakers outlawed sexually explicit deepfakes and certain election-related deepfake content, required tech companies to provide free AI detection tools, [and stipulated that ](https://digitaldemocracy.calmatters.org/bills/ca_202320240ab2013?_gl=1*1dqd8b6*_gcl_au*MTUyODU0MDE4MC4xNzMxOTc0MjYz*_ga*MjA1ODMwODYxOS4xNzMxOTc0MjYz*_ga_5TKXNLE5NK*MTczMjAyNDMzNi43LjEuMTczMjAyNjk4Ni42MC4wLjA.*_ga_DX0K9PCWYH*MTczMjAyNDMzNi43LjEuMTczMjAyNjk4Ni4wLjAuMA..*_ga_GNY4L81DZE*MTczMjAyNDMzNi44LjEuMTczMjAyNjc1OS4wLjAuMA..)tech companies must publicly release data about their AI training tools.\n[Report Deeply and Fix Things](/donate-202205)\nGov. Newsom [ultimately signed roughly 20 AI bills into law.](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2024/09/29/governor-newsom-announces-new-initiatives-to-advance-safe-and-responsible-ai-protect-californians/) But he also controversially vetoed [a major bill](https://digitaldemocracy.calmatters.org/bills/ca_202320240sb1047?_gl=1*j5wbf3*_ga*MjA1ODMwODYxOS4xNzMxOTc0MjYz*_ga_GNY4L81DZE*MTczMTk3NDI2Mi4xLjEuMTczMTk3NDMzOC4wLjAuMA..*_gcl_au*MTUyODU0MDE4MC4xNzMxOTc0MjYz*_ga_5TKXNLE5NK*MTczMTk3NDI2Mi4xLjEuMTczMTk3NDM2OS4yOS4wLjA.*_ga_DX0K9PCWYH*MTczMTk3NDI2Mi4xLjEuMTczMTk3NDMzOC4wLjAuMA..) by San Francisco Democratic Sen. Scott Wiener that would’ve instituted significant testing requirements on AI tools to make sure they avoid catastrophic outcomes. In his veto message, Newsom wrote that the bill risked curtailing innovation, but he added that he wanted to “find the appropriate path forward, including legislation and regulation.”\nWiener told CalMatters he’s working on updated legislation that could garner “broader support.” Such a bill would presumably include additional buy-in from the tech sector, which the state is [relying on for tax revenues](https://calmatters.org/economy/technology/2024/10/ca-corporate-tax-revenue-surge/), and which has a [notable lobbying presence in Sacramento](https://calmatters.org/politics/2024/11/california-lobbying-google-big-oil/) — [Google just racked up](https://calmatters.org/politics/capitol/2024/11/google-lobbying-california/) the largest quarterly lobbying tab in a decade.\nAsked whether to expect more Big Tech lobbying against regulatory efforts in California, Palo Alto Democratic Assemblymember Marc Berman said: “It’s going to be a good time to be a lobbyist. They’re going to do very well.”\nThough Wiener’s AI testing bill was batted down, as were a few other noteworthy AI bills that didn’t make it out of the Legislature, California is “far and away the center of AI regulation in the U.S,” said Ashok Ayyar, a Stanford research fellow [who co-wrote a comparative analysis](https://cyber.fsi.stanford.edu/publication/californias-sb1047-vs-eu-ai-act-comparative-analysis-ai-regulation) of Wiener’s bill against the European Union’s more comprehensive AI efforts.\n[↩︎ link](#a-lack-of-federal-regulation-and-legislation)\nA lack of federal regulation and legislation\nCalifornia is leading on AI in large part because the competition is basically non-existent.\nCongress hasn’t passed meaningful AI legislation. Asked about Trump and the incoming Republican majority, San Ramon Democratic Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan said, “There isn’t much regulation to deregulate, to be honest.”\n[\n](https://themarkup.org/news/2023/11/01/the-problems-bidens-ai-order-must-address)\nNews\nThe Problems Biden’s AI Order Must Address\nThe Markup gives a section-by-section breakdown of the summarized executive order on artificial intelligence\nSans federal legislation, President Biden [issued an executive order in October 2023](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/) intended to place guardrails around the use of AI. The order [built on five policy principles](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/) on the “design, use, and deployment of automated systems to protect the American public.” Biden directed federal agencies “to develop plans for how they would advance innovation in the government use of AI, but also protect against known harms and rights violations,” said Haven. Soon after Biden’s executive order, his administration created the U.S. AI Safety Institute, which is housed within the Commerce Department.\nBiden’s executive order relies on tech companies, many of which are based in California, to voluntarily embrace the administration’s suggestions; it also relies on agencies like the Department of Homeland Security, which includes Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection, to [be transparent and honest](https://www.dhs.gov/ai/ensuring-ai-is-used-responsibly) about how they’re using AI technology and not violate people’s civil rights.\nLike most executive orders, Biden’s AI edict is loosely enforceable and fairly easy to reverse.\nTrump has already promised to repeal Biden’s executive order on day one of his term; the 2024 Republican platform argues that the executive order “hinders AI Innovation, and imposes Radical Leftwing ideas on the development of this technology.” Homeland Security and other executive branch agencies may be granted far more flexibility when Trump takes office, though advocates say the bar was already low; a[ June 2024 report from the nonprofit Mijente titled “Automating Deportation”](https://mijente.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Automating-Deportation.pdf) argues the department hasn’t followed through on the Biden administration’s already relatively meager requests.\nAfter Trump clinched the 2024 presidential election, segments of the tech industry were jubilant about what they foresee for the AI industry—including [an imminent uptick in government contracts.](https://www.wired.com/story/ice-surveillance-contracts-isap/) “Stick a fork in it, it’s over,” Marc Andreessen, the billionaire general partner of venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, wrote on X. “The US will be the preeminent AI superpower in the world after all.”\n[↩︎ link](#fully-unleashed-federal-agencies)\nFully unleashed federal agencies\nIf mass deportation of undocumented immigrants come to pass, as Trump has promised, that would require a wide variety of technologies, including AI tools. Homeland Security already employs an AI system called the Repository for Analytics in a Virtualized Environment, or RAVEn, a nine-figure government contract. The department also has access to an extensive biometric database, and monitors certain undocumented immigrants outside of detention centers via a surveillance tool that utilizes AI algorithms to try to determine whether an immigrant is likely to abscond.\n“We know from Trump’s first administration that there are going to be fewer guardrails with the use of this tech, and agents will feel even more emboldened,” said Sejal Zota, co-founder and legal director of Just Futures Law, a legal advocacy group focused on immigration, criminal justice and surveillance issues. “That’s one area where we’re going to see increased AI use to support this mass deportation agenda.”\nTo the best of Zota’s knowledge, there’s little California lawmakers or courts could do to prevent federal agencies from using AI tech against vulnerable populations, including undocumented immigrants. “Is it an issue? Absolutely, it’s an issue,” said Sen. Umberg. “What can we do about it? What can we do about federal agencies using artificial intelligence? We can’t do much.”\nEstimates show [there are at least 1.8 million undocumented immigrants in California.](https://calmatters.org/california-divide/2024/09/undocumented-immigrants-california-unemployment-aid/)\n[↩︎ link](#what-if-congress-acts)\nWhat if Congress acts?\nAnother potential threat to California’s AI regulations is if the majority Republican Congress passes looser AI rules of its own, preempting state law. California lawmakers, including Assemblymember Bauer-Kahan and Sen. Umberg, said they don’t think significant AI legislation will make it to President Trump for his signature.\nCongressional gridlock is one reason Sen. Wiener said he’s pursuing AI regulation in the California Legislature in the first place: “I was very clear that if (the issue) were being handled statutorily at the federal level, I’d be happy to close up shop and go home,” he said. “But it wasn’t happening, and it’s certainly not going to happen under Trump.”\nNot everyone believes Congress will remain stagnant on this issue, however, particularly with one party now dominant in Washington. “I wouldn’t underestimate the creativity of this incoming administration,” said Paromita Shah, executive director of Just Futures Law.\nAdded Haven: “I think it’s possible that with a Republican trifecta, we’ll see an attempt to pass a very weak data privacy law at the federal level that preempts state law. Then it’s a game of whack-a-mole between the state legislature and the federal legislature.”\n[↩︎ link](#californias-next-steps)\nCalifornia’s next steps\nNewsom has to date signed many AI bills but turned back others he says go too far and risk inhibiting an industry he has sought to [cultivate as a government partner](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2024/08/09/california-nvidia-launch-first-of-its-kind-ai-collaboration/). A spokesperson for Newsom did not directly respond to CalMatters’ questions for this story, instead providing a statement highlighting the state’s role in shaping the future of so-called “generative AI,” a recent and innovative form of the technology behind tools like ChatGPT, DALL-E, and Midjourney: “California has led the nation in protecting against the harms of GenAI while leveraging its potential benefits,” said spokesperson Alex Stack.\nPresident-elect Trump’s team did not respond to written questions from CalMatters.\nDan Schnur, a political analyst and professor at UC Berkeley and other campuses, predicted the governor will save his political capital for other clashes. “Newsom’s incentive for strengthening his relationship with Silicon Valley is probably stronger than his need for yet one more issue to fight over with Donald Trump,” Schnur said.\nFlorence G’Sell, a visiting professor at Stanford’s cyber policy center, cautioned Newsom against clinging to the deregulatory side of Silicon Valley. “There is really a very strong movement that wants to highlight the risks of AI, the safety questions,” G’Sell said. “If I were the governor, I wouldn’t be insensitive to this movement and the warnings.”\nLawmakers are eyeing other avenues to shore up Californians’ redresses against AI technology. Assemblymember Bauer-Kahan [previously told CalMatters](https://calmatters.org/economy/technology/2024/09/california-ai-safety-regulations-bills/) she plans to reintroduce a stronger version of a bill, which failed to advance past the Legislature last session, to crack down on discriminatory AI practices. Another top AI priority, according to Menlo Park Democratic Sen. Josh Becker, is less sexy, but perhaps just as important: “closely monitor the implementation of this year’s regulatory framework (that we just passed),” he wrote.\nCalifornia’s next AI regulatory steps were always going to be intensely analyzed. That’s even more so the case now, with Trump returning to office—a challenge state lawmakers are embracing.\n“One of the things that is somewhat amusing to me is when folks come to me and say, ‘Whatever you do in California is going to set the standard for the country,’ Sen. Umberg said. “As a policymaker, that’s catnip. That’s why I ran for office.”",

    "text": "Dozens of candy and snack products sold at Walmart, Target, Dollar General recalled for possible salmonella contamination (Gray News) - A candy recall originally announced in May has been classified as the highest risk by the Food and Drug Administration. Palmer Candy was notified by a supplier its liquid coating could potentially have been contaminated by salmonella from a supplier’s ingredient. The products are listed as [Class 1](https://www.fda.gov/safety/industry-guidance-recalls/recalls-background-and-definitions#:~:text=Class%20I%20recall:%20a%20situation%20in%20which,not%20likely%20to%20cause%20adverse%20health%20consequences.), the highest level of risk. Production of the confections has been suspended while the FDA and the company continue their investigation into the problem’s source. The recalled items were distributed nationwide at Walmart, HyVee, Target and Dollar General. They were also sent to distributors in Alabama, California, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming. The products come in a variety of retail packaging like bags, pouches and tubs. No illnesses have been reported to date in connection with this recall. Healthy people infected with [salmonella](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15697-salmonella) may experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, health experts say. Infection with salmonella, in rare cases, can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses. Those who have purchased the white-coated candy and snack items manufactured by Palmer Candy Co. are urged to return them to the place of purchase for a full refund. Consumers with questions may contact Palmer’s at 1-800-831-0828 Monday through Friday 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. A full list of the recalled items can be found [in the FDA announcement](https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/update-palmer-candy-company-recall-white-confectionary-products-because-possible-health-risk) and is included below: |Product||Best by date| |CARAMEL SWIRL PRETZELS 4oz||12/18/24-12/28/24| |CARAMEL SWIRL PRETZELS 6oz||12/19/24, 12/20/24 and 1/19/25| |CLASSIC YOGURT PRETZELS 28#||12/11/24 – 1/8/25| |COOKIES & CREAM YUMMY CHOW 14#||12/6/24 – 1/23/25| |ENROBED PRETZEL RODS 8oz||1/22/2025| |FAVORITE DAY BAKERY WHITE FUDGE MINI COOKIES 7oz||4/4/25, 4/5/25, 4/15/25 - 4/18/25| |FROSTED MUNCHY MEDLEY BOWL 15oz||1/3/2025| |FROSTED PATRIOT FROSTED PRETZELS 28#||1/2/25, 1/3/25| |FROSTED PRETZELS 6oz||1/23/2025| |MUNCHY MEDLEY 15#||12/14/24, 1/3/25| |MUNCHY MEDLEY 4oz||12/25/24 – 12/28/24 and 1/19/25| |MUNCHY MEDLEY TO GO 4oz||12/25/24 – 1/19/25| |MUNCHY MEDLEY 6oz||12/20/24, 4/25/25| |PATRIOTIC MUNCHY MEDLEY BOWL 15oz||1/19/2025| |PATRIOTIC PRETZELS 14oz||1/25/25, 1/26/25| |PATRIOTIC PRETZELS 6oz||1/19/2025| |PATRIOTIC RED, WHITE & BLUE PRETZEL TWISTS 14oz||12/13/24 - 1/15/25| |PATRIOTIC SNACK MIX 13oz||1/19/25 - 2/1/25| |PATRIOTIC WHITE FUDGE COOKIES 13.5oz||4/22/2025| |PATRIOTIC WHITE FUDGE COOKIES 7oz||4/23/25, 4/24/25| |PEANUT BUTTER SNACK MIX 12oz||11/13/24 – 12/22/24| |PEANUT BUTTER SNACK MIX TO GO 4.5oz||1/18/2025| |SNACKIN’ WITH THE CREW!

    "text": "In her recently published memoir, “Two Tickets to Paradise: From Cult to Comedy,” L.A. comic Katie Love presents a deeply personal exploration into themes of resilience, self-discovery, and fortitude. Delving into the depths of childhood innocence, the harrowing lure of cultish ideologies, and the redemptive power of humor, Love’s memoir stands as a captivating must-read for 2024. Winner of the National Indie Excellence Award, Two Tickets to Paradise: From Cult to Comedy unfolds during the tumultuous 1970s within a landscape colored by cultural upheaval and shifting societal norms. Love’s journey begins amidst the heartache of tragic personal loss — the death of Katie’s mother — and the appeal of a utopian promise within the Jehovah’s Witness faith. The book intricately weaves together the landscape of a changing America with Love’s heroic personal journey in a landscape of a changing America, illuminating the challenges and triumphs she experienced as an innocent young girl undergoing profound personal, social and cultural changes. The memoir chronicles Love’s quest to see her mother again in “Paradise”, an earnest endeavor that leads her through unforeseen adversities and unveils a world starkly different from the one promised. Love’s narrative dances between tragedy and comedy with tender introspection, recounting the transformation of a Bible-wielding child evangelist into a vivacious comedian who discovers solace and healing through the cathartic medium of humor. “Katie Love’s remarkable memoir is as unexpected a read as her life’s journey has been. She has survived truly harrowing experiences thanks to her inner strength and undimmed resilience. But Katie’s fierce intelligence and wry sense of humor shine brightly throughout even the darkest moments, and will have you wiping tears of laughter from your eyes even as your heart breaks. Katie’s writing is raw, brave, and at times unexpectedly poignant. This is an unforgettable book.” praised Channing Dungey, Chairman of Warner Bros. Television, adding to the growing acclaim surrounding Love’s work. Love’s unfiltered storytelling refrains from sugar-coating the painful realities, yet remarkably, it remains devoid of bitterness. She candidly yearns for love and acceptance from a family trapped in their inability to provide the support she deserves. Through her memoir, Love reflects on the transformative nature of self-love amid adversity, offering readers a poignant glimpse into the human capacity for resilience and the pursuit of acceptance in the face of trials. The memoir’s raw portrayal of life’s complexities makes it a thought-provoking read. Available in print, digital, and audio formats, the memoir promises an immersive reading experience that resonates with readers seeking poignant storytelling intertwined with the power of humor.

    "text": "San Marino hace historia entre lágrimas de emoción: gana tras 20 años, 135 derrotas y 568 goles encajados - San Marino gana el segundo partido de su historia, primero oficial - De nuevo lo hizo con un 1-0 a Liechtenstein - [1x1 de España ante Serbia en la Nations League 2024](https://www.eldesmarque.com/futbol/seleccion-espanola/20240905/1x1-espana-serbia-nations-league-2024_300435906.html#utm_source=sumario&utm_medium=articulo) Este 5 de septiembre de 2024 no es un día cualquiera en la historia del fútbol. La Selección de San Marino ha logrado la primera victoria en partido oficial en su historia y primera en un encuentro tras 20 años, con 135 derrotas y seis empates y 568 goles encajados por el camino hasta volver a vencer a Liechtenstein en el [encuentro de la Nations League](https://www.eldesmarque.com/futbol/seleccion-espanola/20240208/sorteo-nations-league-24-25-y-rivales-de-la-seleccion-espanola_300238664.html). Como decía Carlos Gardel, 20 años no es nada, y menos para la 210ª del ránking FIFA. Nicko Sensoli, futbolista del Sangiuliano City Nova, de la Serie D italiana, tuvo el honor a sus 19 años de anotar el tanto de la victoria para el pequeño país de algo más de 35.000 habitantes, aprovechando una indecisión en la defensa rival. Con este honor sucede al mítico Andy Selva, autor del único tanto en el 1-0 a Liechtenstein de hace 20 años en el que era el único triunfo hasta la fecha. No fue nada fácil el triunfo, ya que Fabio Notaro anotó un gol para los liechtensteinianos que fue anulado tras la revisión del VAR. El combinado alpino lo intentó hasta la última jugada, en la que tuvieron un cabezazo que mandaron fuera y, con el pitido final, se desató la locura en el Estadio Olímpico de Serravalle. Con este triunfo, San Marino se coloca líder de su grupo en la Liga D de la Nations League, la categoría más baja. Además de Liechtenstein, los sanmarinenses comparten grupo con Gibraltar, que llega después de haber conseguido ascender a la Liga C hace dos ediciones. San Marino hace historia 20 años después El equipo del pequeño país enclavado en Italia ya había avisado en los últimos tiempos de que ya no era esa selección a la que cualquiera goleaba con facilidad. Ha seguido encajando resultados abultados, sí, pero lo ha hecho plantando más cara de lo habitual con resultados sorprendentes en los últimos años. En toda su historia, antes del verano de 2022, apenas sumaba dos empates ante Liechtenstein y uno ante Estonia, Gibraltar, Letonia, Líbano y otro increíblemente contra Turquía. Ese mes de septiembre disputó un amistoso contra las Islas Seychelles, en una situación similar en el ránking FIFA, pero no pasó del 0-0. En noviembre de ese año lo intentó con una pequeña isla caribeña, Santa Lucía, pero no pasó del 1-1 y cayó en el otro partido por 1-0. Misma situación que ante los vecinos de la CONCACAF de San Cristóbal y Nieves, con un 1-3 y un 0-0 que aumentaba la racha negativa. Eso sí, por el camino encadenó tres encuentros consecutivos marcando, lo que no es poco, en la fase de clasificación para la Eurocopa 2024. Logró marcar en el 1-2 ante Dinamarca (empató pasada la hora de partido), el 3-1 en Kazajistán y el 1-2 ante Finlandia, sembrando las bases de la victoria de este jueves. La historia quiso que fuera de nuevo Liechtenstein el rival a batir con otro 1-0 para la historia de la república más antigua del mundo y el tercer Estado europeo con más años siendo independiente. 141 partidos sin ganar, con 135 derrotas y 568 goles encajados por el camino hasta que, 20 años después, San Marino ha podido celebrar el triunfo desatando una fiesta nacional.",

    "text": "Tanios S. Bekaii-Saab, MD, emphasizes the idea of moving targeted therapies to earlier lines of treatment to further improve outcomes in pancreatic cancer. As part of [Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Month,](https://www.cancernetwork.com/awareness-month/pancreatic-cancer-awareness-month) CancerNetwork® spoke with Tanios S. Bekaii-Saab, MD, about the current state of the pancreatic cancer treatment paradigm, and where he believes the field will be headed next. Bekaii-Saab, a consultant and division chair in the Division of Hematology/Oncology and Department of Internal Medicine and a professor of medicine at Mayo Clinic in Phoenix, Arizona, said he is optimistic in being able to move the needle forward in the treatment field while potentially improving quality of life and the level of cure among patients with pancreatic cancer. Although he highlighted “great” work related to the use of chemotherapy and surgical techniques, he emphasized that the next steps may involve advancing targeted therapy agents to earlier lines of treatment to further improve outcomes among patients. Transcript: If I have any message for my colleagues, for my patients, and for all patients with pancreatic cancer, it’s that [we can almost see] the light at the end of the tunnel. We’re seeing it clearer now. We have a lot more to offer our patients. We’re working very hard on bringing all these agents comprehensively into clinical trials and the clinic. I have never been more optimistic. I’m always the eternal optimist, but I’m even more optimistic today that we’re going to move the needle for our patients with pancreatic cancer and continue to enhance that likelihood of living longer, having better quality of life, or even increasing the level of cure for this cancer. At the end, a lot of these agents that are very active in the later stages of the disease need to start trickling back to earlier [disease] stages. We’ve done great work with chemotherapy and surgical resections, and improved surgical techniques have moved a lot of patients with early-stage cancer into a cure. But [it is] not enough, and we now must think about how we can bring a lot of these targeted agents to earlier lines of therapy to enhance even further the likelihood of cure for these patients. [There is] a lot of work ahead of us. Certainly, the future looks bright. We’re chipping away, one drug at a time. We can now remove that whole concept of nihilism in pancreatic cancer and look quite optimistically on the future. Finally, we’re going to get there.
