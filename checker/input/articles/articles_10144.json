    "text": "Press Release Career Criminal Convicted of Federal Firearms Charge Northern District of West Virginia MARTINSBURG, WEST VIRGINIA – A Washington, D.C. man with three prior felony convictions has been convicted of illegally possessing a firearm.\nUnited States Attorney William Ihlenfeld announced that Mario Adonte Crawley, age 51, was convicted by a jury of the unlawful possession of a firearm. The evidence at trial established that Crawley’s vehicle was stopped in Kearneysville, West Virginia, by the Berkeley County Sheriff’s Office in September of 2023. During the traffic stop, officers located a loaded 9mm handgun hidden in a laundry basket in the back of Crawley’s automobile. Crawley is prohibited from possessing firearms because of prior felony convictions for Armed Robbery in the District of Columbia, Attempted Robbery in Petersburg, Virginia, and Receiving Stolen Property in Chesterfield County, Virginia.\nAssistant U.S. Attorneys Daniel Salem and Lara Omps-Botteicher prosecuted the case on behalf of the government.\nThe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives; the Drug Enforcement Administration; and the Berkeley County Sheriff’s Office investigated.\nCrawley faces up to fifteen years in prison when he is sentenced.\nU.S. District Court Judge Gina M.

The December non-farm payroll (NFP) report exceeded expectations, showing an increase to 216,000, compared with the projected 170,000. The report triggered an instant market reaction, pushing the 10 year yield above 4% and sending stock futures tumbling.\nNon-Farm Jobs Rose by 216K in December, Significantly Above Expectations New jobs data for December were released on Friday and it’s not what many economists expected. US employers added 216,000 jobs last month, well above the consensus estimates of 170,000 and marking a significant increase from the revised November reading of 173,000. The unemployment rate stood at 3.7%, compared with the estimated 3.8%. The December print also marked the 36th consecutive monthly increase in job growth.\nOn Thursday, a report by ADP stated that payrolls in the private sector rose by 164,00 in December, exceeding the 130,000 expected by economists.\nThe stronger-than-anticipated NFP report caused an immediate impact in the markets. US Treasury yields continued their uptrend, with the 10-year note rising above the 4% level to 4.053%. The 2-Year Yield climbed slightly to 4.42%.\nMeanwhile, stock futures were down across the board, with the S&P 500 witnessing a decline to 4,722. Dow Jones and Nasdaq 100 Futures fell to 37,647 and 16,418, respectively.\nHot Labor Market May Delay the Planned Rate Cuts Just a few weeks ago, the Federal Reserve said it intends to begin cutting interest rates in 2024, but the latest jobs report could make those plans more complicated. A hot labor market has been among the key inflation drivers for the past two years, which is why the central bank’s policymakers may delay the first cut.\nWhile the Fed has not provided an official timeline, some Wall Street analysts had expected a cut as soon as March. However, following the mixed minutes data released this week, a growing number of market watchers believe cuts could come later than expected. Today’s NFP data is likely to support this narrative.\n“For the Fed, the probability of a 25bp cut by March was down to 69% by [Thursday’s] close, which is its lowest since the December meeting, back when they published the dot plot that was more dovish than the consensus expected. And in turn, Treasuries sold off across the curve.”\n– Deutsche Bank (ETR: DBKGn ) strategists led by Jim Reid said in a Friday note. The next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting will be held on January 30-31. Although this will be one of the key events to watch this month, economists and investors expect the Fed to leave rates unchanged from the current range of 5.25%-5.50%.\n***\nNeither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice.

    "title": "$750 a month, no questions asked, improved the lives of homeless people",
    "text": "LOS ANGELES — If 100 homeless people were given $750 per month for a year, no questions asked, what would they spend it on? That question was at the core of a controlled study conducted by a San Francisco-based nonprofit and the USC Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work. The results were so promising that the researchers decided to publish results after only six months. The answer: food, 36.6%; housing, 19.5%; transportation, 12.7%; clothing, 11.5%; and health care, 6.2%, leaving only 13.6% uncategorized. Those who got the stipend were less likely to be unsheltered after six months and able to meet more of their basic needs than a control group that got no money, and half as likely as the control group to have an episode of being unsheltered. “I felt there was enough interest and the initial findings were compelling enough that it was important to get those results out,” said Benjamin Henwood, director of the Center for Homelessness, Housing and Health Equity Research at the Dworak-Peck School, who led the study. People are also reading… “It may not be earth-shattering that providing money is going to help meet basic needs, but I do think it dispels this myth that people will use money for illicit purposes,” Henwood said. “We weren’t finding that in the study.” About 2% of the total went to alcohol, cigarettes and drug expenses — the largest portion of which was cigarettes, Henwood said. The participants submit monthly reports on their spending and are surveyed in more detail quarterly. A follow-up report will be published after participants have received the funds for a full year. But Henwood said the main findings were robust enough that they were unlikely to change. The study arose from Miracle Messages, a San Francisco-based nonprofit that sends volunteers to the streets and shelters to befriend homeless people and try to make connections with the loved ones who lost contact with them. Next founder and chief executive Kevin F. Adler started Miracle Friends, matching homeless people to volunteer phone buddies for weekly calls. That evolved into Miracle Money when volunteers began asking Adler whether it was OK to give their buddies a few dollars. “You asked me to be a friend to this person, but they don’t know what they’re going to eat tonight,” Adler said they would tell him. Adler didn’t think the volunteers should hand out their own money. But the idea of cash support appealed to him. After a pilot showed promise, Adler got a grant to expand to Los Angeles. He hired two recruiters to canvass homeless shelters. They enlisted more than 200 clients who met the criteria of being at least 18 years old and homeless and expressed interest in having a phone buddy. Rather than just give money away, Adler hoped to document its effect. He teamed up with Henwood, who devised the controlled study. The participants were divided randomly into two groups. One group of 103 received stipends. The others were told they were on a waiting list. After six months, only 12% of those who received funds reported being unsheltered at any time in the prior month, a dramatic decrease from 30% at the outset. Those on the waiting list also reported fewer unsheltered episodes, but by a much smaller margin, from 28% to 23%. The cash recipients also said they were better able to meet their basic needs. On a scale of 1 (completely) to 5 (not at all), they dropped from about 3.75 on average to just over 3.25. The control group did not budge from 3.75. Among those receiving the funds, some found permanent housing, even though the money fell far below average rents in the area, Henwood said. “It seems like it’s opening up possibilities in different ways,” he said. “They might have a friend or relative that may not be willing to support them completely, but if they have something to contribute that opens up a room.” In other cases, the money created opportunities, even for people who remained unsheltered. “I spent a lot of the money on food on the go,” one participant told the researchers. “Simple, cheap things like bean and cheese burritos. I eat on the run while I bike/work for DoorDash. I also bought a membership to REI, so I could get my bike fixed for free.” “It’s not a single path forward,” Henwood said. “It’s a lot of resourcefulness and creativity.” 20 facts about homelessness in the US 20 facts about homelessness in the US Conversely, the U.S. has seen an 8.6% decrease in homelessness since 2010 Experts from HUD believe that resources from the American Rescue Plan directed toward homelessness assistance lessened the impact of COVID-19 on homelessness The end of the federal eviction moratorium in August 2021 made millions of Americans' housing situations more precarious during the long tail of the COVID-19 pandemic The marked increase in rental prices during COVID-19 likely contributed to the recent rise in homelessness HUD's Emergency Rental Assistance program received more than 12 million applications for assistance between August 2021 and January 2022 A greater proportion of people experiencing homelessness were unsheltered in 2022 compared to 2020 Veteran homelessness has decreased by 11% since 2020 and more than 50% since 2010 Family and youth homelessness have both decreased since 2020 50,767 families with children experienced homelessness in 2022 Since 2020, unaccompanied youth homelessness has decreased by 12% From 2020 to 2022, the number of people who identified as Hispanic or Latino who experienced homelessness rose by 8%",

    "text": "Tras varios días consecutivos de altísimas temperaturas, en España nos despedimos de ellas y de la ola de calor que ha azotado con dureza todo el país. Los termómetros han alcanzado temperaturas de hasta 45 grados en muchas zonas del país. Y es que hoy, domingo 2 de agosto entra en España un aire algo más frío que hará que las temperaturas desciendan. Así lo ha confirmado la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (Aemet). En algunas comunidades no solo notaremos ese descenso de las temperaturas sino que podría llegar a haber algunas lluvias. La nubosidad en las comunidades del norte será abundante y, en algunos puntos, incluso podremos ver precipitaciones en forma de granizo. Tendremos chubascos en el Cantábrico, que podrían llegar de forma dispersa a puntos de Castilla y León y también a algunos puntos de Madrid. Las lluvias se irán extendiendo al este, pudiendo llegar a La Rioja, Navarra, Aragón y Cataluña, además de algunos puntos de la Comunidad Valenciana. La Aemet ha señalado que las temperaturas seguirán siendo «elevadas en amplias zonas del interior peninsular», haciendo especial hincapié en el Valle del Guadalquivir. Los avisos por calor seguirán activos en algunas zonas de Andalucía, pudiendo superarse nuevamente los 40 grados de máxima.",

Il Real Madrid ora si trova ad affrontare un problema spinoso, ovvero come piazzare Andriy Lunin. Dopo l'infortunio del portiere titolare della scorsa stagione Courtois, Andriy Lunin è diventato un ottimo sostituto, ma poiché Courtois è tornato dall'infortunio a fine stagione, Andriy Lunin si è trovato in una posizione scomoda. Per la prossima stagione, Andriy Lunin ovviamente non vuole sedersi in panchina con la completino Real Madrid. E il Real Madrid ora non vuole dare ad Andriy Lunin una posizione di partenza, e anche il Real Madrid si sta scervellando per Andriy Lunin. Secondo le ultime notizie, il Real Madrid ha accettato di lasciare Andriy Lunin dalla squadra per 30 milioni di euro.

    "text": "South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham has a message for New York state lawmakers: Don’t mess with God’s chicken.\nThe Republican took his defense of Chick-fil-A on the road this week, issuing a fresh warning during a trip to the Big Apple over a New York bill that would force some of the franchise’s locations to open on Sundays.\nGraham threatened “war” last week in response to legislation filed in the New York State Assembly to require Chick-fil-A restaurants located at rest stops to operate seven days a week, which goes against the company’s long-standing policy of staying closed on Sundays for religious reasons.\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., says a New York bill that would force some Chick-fil-A locations to open on Sunday is unconstitutional and has vowed to fight it. Melissa Sue Gerrits/Getty Images\nGraham said then if the proposal moves forward, he would introduce his own legislation in the U.S. Senate withholding federal funds from any city or state that requires Chick-fil-A to open on Sundays.\nNEW YORK BILL WOULD FORCE SOME CHICK-FIL-A LOCATIONS TO OPEN ON SUNDAYS\nWhen asked about the New York bill during an appearance on “FOX & Friends” in New York City on Wednesday, Graham said, “Well, if you can have a Satan club in high school, surely [Chick-fil-A] can close on Sunday, because they believe it’s the Lord’s Day.”\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\nHe then gave a shout-out to Chick-fil-A Chairman Dan Cathy, telling him and the rest of the Chick-fil-A crew, “Stand your ground, I’ve got your back. It’s illegal what they’re trying to do.”\nA Chick-Fil-A location at a rest stop in Arsley, New York, is seen closed on Sunday. Fox News Digital\n“The idea that the state of New York is going to make a company change its policies it’s had from its founding — they want to have one day off for their employees to recognize the Lord, and they can do it,” Graham went on to tell “FOX & Friends.” “And to the people in New York who are pushing this: You’re in for one hell of a fight.”\nNEW YORK GOVERNOR’S REPARATIONS COMMISSION SLAMMED AS DIVISIVE: ‘SLAP IN THE FACE’\nFollowing the interview, Graham posted a video on X of himself in front of a Chick-fil-A location in Manhattan, where he continued his campaign against the New York bill, calling it a “blatant violation of this company’s rights.”\nThe New York legislation filed earlier this month would require all food vendors operating at rest stops owned by the New York State Thruway Authority to open every day, and names Chick-fil-A as the reason behind the move.\n“While there is nothing objectionable about a fast food restaurant closing on a particular day of the week, service areas dedicated to travelers is an inappropriate location for such a restaurant,” the bill’s justification reads. “Publicly owned service areas should use their space to maximally benefit the public. Allowing for retail space to go unused one seventh of the week or more is a disservice and unnecessary inconvenience to travelers who rely on these service areas.”\nEver since it opened in 1946, Chick-fil-A has closed its locations on Sunday. It now has 3,000 locations in the U.S. The company currently operates seven restaurants owned by New York’s Thruway Authority, and the proposed legislation would impact all future contracts.\nOriginal article source: Lindsey Graham warns New York over Chick-fil-A bill during trip to Big Apple",

    "text": "When I committed to Georgetown two years ago, I remember wondering how my Sikh-American identity would align with the school’s Jesuit values and identity. And yet, in these two years, I have found community, celebration, and solace in the Dharmic community at Georgetown University . Georgetown celebrates the religion and identities of many diverse faiths. A quintessential example of this was the Spring Fest celebration hosted by Dharmic Life this past weekend! Spring Fest is a joint celebration hosted by many organizations at Georgetown, including Dharmic Life, GU Hindu Student Association, Asian American Student Association, Sikh Student Association, Buddhist Student Association and Jain Student Association. These communities come together to celebrate their respective spring holidays while sharing their joy with other members of the larger Dharmic community. This year, we came together to celebrate Holi, Vaisakhi, Songkran, Yugadi, Mahavir Jayanti and Wesak. These holidays, although celebrated in different traditions, are known as “spring festivals” and celebrate the spring harvest in South Asia. My role in Spring Fest was to represent the Sikh Student Association and share a prayer with others, emphasizing the importance of growing as a person, alongside the growth of spring season. On behalf of the organization, I spoke about the importance of Vaisakhi, as it holds profound significance for Sikhs. Vaisakhi commemorates the formation of the Khalsa, the community of initiated Sikhs, by Guru Gobind Singh in 1699. It marks a pivotal moment in Sikh history, symbolizing courage, sacrifice and the commitment to uphold principles of equality, justice and righteousness. Sikhs celebrate Vaisakhi with fervor, engaging in prayers, processions, communal meals (langar) and acts of service, reaffirming their faith and celebrating the spirit of unity and selflessness.",

En novembre, l’Agence canadienne d’inspection des aliments a lancé des avertissements de rappel d’aliments pour les melons produits par Malichita, et plus tard dans le mois, elle a publié des rappels pour les melons de la marque Rudy, produits dans la même région du Mexique.

La poursuite indique que le demandeur a reçu un cantaloup dans une boîte d’abonnement à la fin octobre et en a acheté un autre dans une épicerie de Montréal. Elle affirme qu’il a été admis aux urgences le 12 novembre après avoir souffert d’une maladie grave, avec notamment des crampes abdominales intenses et des vomissements, et qu’il a ensuite été confirmé qu’il était atteint de la salmonellose. L’action collective proposée, qui n’a pas été autorisée ni testée devant les tribunaux, vise à obtenir des dommages−intérêts non précisés au nom de particuliers au Québec qui ont acheté et consommé des cantaloups et d’autres fruits en octobre et novembre qui ont fait l’objet de rappels par Santé Canada.",

    "title": "USA und China: Ansehen beschädigt - und der Tourismus leidet",
    "text": "Wirtschaft USA und China: Ansehen beschädigt - und der Tourismus leidet\nMünchen/Peking (dpa) - Im globalen Reiseverkehr haben Krisen und Konflikte der vergangenen Jahre China bislang mehr geschadet als den USA. Die beiden großen deutschen Flughäfen Frankfurt und München melden auch nach dem Amtsantritt von US-Präsident Donald Trump in diesem Jahr bisher einen Anstieg der Passagierzahlen auf den US-Routen, im China-Verkehr hingegen einen Rückgang. Und im direkten Vergleich der jeweiligen weltweiten Besucherzahlen haben die Vereinigten Staaten China seit 2019 überholt.\nFachwelt erwartet Trump-Krise im US-Tourismus\nDer Münchner Flughafen zählte von Januar bis Mai knapp 1,2 Millionen Passagiere im Flugverkehr mit den USA – fast 37.000 mehr als ein Jahr zuvor. Auch in Frankfurt legten die Fluggastzahlen in den ersten vier Monaten – noch ohne Mai – um 7.600 auf 944.300 zu. Das deutet bisher nicht auf einen riesigen Trump-Effekt. Allerdings ist diesen Daten nicht zu entnehmen, ob die Flieger mehrheitlich mit US-Bürgern oder Europäern besetzt waren. Die Zahlen beinhalten sowohl abfliegende als auch ankommende Passagiere.\nDass Trumps zweite Amtszeit dem US-Tourismus schaden wird, ist Konsens in der Fachwelt: Nach Schätzung des in London ansässigen Welttourismusverband WTTC und des Beratungsinstituts Oxford Economics kommen auf die USA in diesem Jahr Einnahmeverluste von über zwölf Milliarden Dollar zu, weil Ausländer fernbleiben. Der «Spiegel» widmete der Trump-bedingten Reisekrise die Titelgeschichte seiner jüngsten Ausgabe.\nChina-Tourismus: Pandemie wirkt nach, Ukraine-Krieg schadet\nAuf den China-Flugrouten von und nach München und Frankfurt sind die Passagierzahlen in diesem Jahr bereits geschrumpft: um 1.300 auf knapp 203.000 Passagiere während der ersten fünf Monate in München. In den ersten vier Monaten in Frankfurt waren es 180.300 Fluggäste, die nach China flogen oder von dort ankamen, 27.000 weniger als ein Jahr zuvor. Ein quasi identisches Bild zeigt sich auch beim längerfristigen Vergleich der Jahre 2019 und 2024: Gesunkene Passagierzahlen nach und aus China, im Saldo höhere im US-Flugverkehr.\nWoran liegt das? «Die Erreichbarkeit Chinas hat sich erheblich verändert», sagt Dennis Utzerath, Tourismusfachmann bei der internationalen Unternehmensberatung BCG in Köln. In der Corona-Pandemie wurde das Flugangebot sehr stark zusammengestrichen.\nUnd wegen des Ukraine-Kriegs umfliegen europäische Fluggesellschaften seit 2022 den russischen Luftraum auf teuren Umwegen, chinesische nicht. «Für europäische Fluggesellschaften ist es dadurch erheblich schwieriger geworden, gegen chinesische Airlines wettbewerbsfähig zu sein», sagt Utzerath. Mehrere europäische Fluggesellschaften – darunter die Lufthansa und British Airways – setzten Verbindungen nach China aus.\nReiseveranstalter sehen wieder steigendes Interesse an China\n«Die immer noch schwachen Fluggastzahlen aus Deutschland Richtung China lassen erstaunlicherweise keinen Rückschluss auf die tatsächliche touristische Nachfrage für China zu», sagt Holger Baldus, Sicherheitsmanager beim Münchner Reiseanbieter Studiosus. Hintergrund der Fluggastzahlen seien die Streckeneinstellungen europäischer Carrier Richtung China. Der Reiseanbieter sieht sogar ein erstaunliches Wiedererstarken des China-Tourismus aus Deutschland, Österreich und der Schweiz, nach Worten des Managers «derzeit von der knappen Verfügbarkeit an Flugsitzen noch gezügelt».\nAuch der größte deutsche Reiseveranstalter Tui berichtet, dass das Interesse an China wachse – «aber natürlich von einer recht übersichtlichen Ausgangsbasis», wie ein Sprecher des Unternehmens sagt.\nChinas Ansehen in der westlichen Welt leidet schon länger\nOffenkundig ist jedoch, dass China seit der Corona-Pandemie international an Attraktivität verloren hat. Reisten 2019 nach offiziellen Zahlen noch knapp 96,6 Millionen Ausländer in die Volksrepublik, waren es 2024 nur noch rund 64,9 Millionen – ein Rückgang von etwa ein Drittel. Der Reiseverkehr in die USA hat sich nach dem Ende der Pandemie deutlich schneller erholt: 2019 zählten die Vereinigten Staaten 79,3 Millionen Besucher, weniger als die Volksrepublik. Im vergangenen Jahr waren es 72,3 Millionen – mehr als in China.\nChinas Ansehen in der westlichen Welt leidet schon erheblich länger als das der USA. Welchen Effekt die Berichterstattung – etwa über staatliche Überwachung und Schnüffelei, brachiale Corona-Lockdowns, Umweltverschmutzung oder Kriegsdrohungen gegen Taiwan – hatte und hat, lässt sich nicht bemessen.\nTourismus lebt von «positiven Bildern im Kopf»\n«Das Thema Image spielt beim Thema China sicher eine Rolle», sagt Unternehmensberater Utzerath. Schlechte Publicity hinterlasse immer Spuren. «Und das liegt weniger daran, dass ein Land „unten durch“ wäre, sondern dass der Fluss an schönen Erfahrungen, positiven Reiseberichten und Eindrücken abreißt.» Damit verlagere sich das Interesse. «Ich würde dem keine übermäßige Dramatik beimessen, aber das zeigt, was für ein volatiles Geschäft Tourismus ist. Die Branche lebt von Schlagzeilen und positiven Bildern im Kopf.»\nDieselbe Volatilität gilt auch für die USA: «Es ist im Moment nicht so, dass viele Schlagzeilen dafür sprechen, ausgerechnet jetzt in die USA zu reisen, wenn man letztes Jahr nicht dort war», sagt Utzerath. Auf der anderen Seite ist der Dollar-Wechselkurs derzeit für Europäer durchaus günstig.\nChina braucht Touristen als Stütze einer schwachen Konjunktur\nAnders als die US-Regierung will Peking ausdrücklich mehr Reisende ins Land locken. Mittlerweile hat die chinesische Regierung ihre komplizierte und teure Visapolitik gelockert. Deutsche brauchen für Geschäfts- oder Tourismusreisen kein Visum mehr. Wer einreist, darf mittlerweile 30 Tage bleiben. Diese Regelung gilt auch für zahlreiche andere europäische Länder.\nAuch die Zugänge zum digitalen Bezahlsystem Chinas sind durch übersetzte Apps und Akzeptanz ausländischer Kreditkarten einfacher geworden. Im ersten Quartal dieses Jahres bezifferten die Behörden die Einreisen von Ausländern auf etwa 17,4 Millionen – im Jahresvergleich ein Zuwachs um etwas mehr als ein Drittel.\nPeking hofft, dass der Tourismus auch der heimischen Wirtschaft unter die Arme greift. Die schwache Nachfrage und eingetrübte Konsumlaune, die der Wirtschaftsleistung zusetzen, will China auch mit mehr Inlandstourismus wieder ankurbeln. Neue Angebote – etwa speziell für Senioren ausgelegte Zugreisen mit Krankenversorgung und Pflege an Bord – sollen auch die ältere Bevölkerung zu größerem Konsum bewegen.",
