    "text": "最近有研究结果表明,非吸烟者肺癌比率增加可能是由于大气污染。 也就是说,大气污染有可能使非吸烟者发生肺癌相关基因突变。\n美国圣地亚哥加利福尼亚大学(UC圣地亚哥)和美国国立癌症研究所(NCI)共同研究组3日在科学杂志《自然(Nature)》上表示,分析了世界28个地区870多名非吸烟者的肺肿瘤基因组,确认了大气污染等环境暴露和对肺癌发病做出贡献的遗传突变发生之间的关联性。\n论文共同通讯作者UC圣地亚哥的鲁德米尔亚历山德罗夫教授表示:\"非吸烟者肺癌正在逐渐增加,但其原因并不明确\",\"该研究表明,大气污染与一般吸烟相关发生的类型的DNA突变有很强的关联\"\n肺癌长期以来一直被认为是吸烟者的疾病,但目前非吸烟者肺癌约占全体肺癌的25%。 非吸烟者肺癌多发生在女性,特别是亚裔女性,据推测,这与间接吸烟及大气污染有关。\n研究组在该研究中分析了生活在非洲、亚洲、欧洲、北美等大气污染水平不同的28个地区的871名非吸烟者的肺肿瘤,确认了突变模式。 接着,将其与卫星、地面测定细颗粒物(PM2.5)数值等居住地区大气污染度联系起来,分析了大气污染和肺癌相关突变之间的关联性。\n结果显示,越是生活在大气污染度高的环境中的不吸烟者,肺肿瘤的突变数就越多,特别是直接促进癌症发生的诱发癌症的突变大幅增加。\n另外,在大气污染严重地区的非吸烟者肿瘤中,特定致癌因素在DNA上留下的固有突变模式\"突变签名(mutational signatures)\"明显较多。 据分析,他们的肺肿瘤中吸烟相关突变签名多出3.9倍,老化相关突变签名多出76%。\n研究组解释说,这表明大气污染就像吸烟一样起作用,有可能诱发DNA与吸烟类似的损伤。\n论文第一作者马科斯迪亚斯-盖伊(音)博士表示:\"这并不意味着大气污染有固有的突变特征,但大气污染会增加体细胞突变\",\"其中还包括吸烟及老化相关的现有特征突变\"\n但是,在二手烟和肺肿瘤突变体之间没有发现强烈的关联性。 在暴露于二手烟的非吸烟者肺肿瘤中,突变略有增加,端粒变短,但诱变效果明显弱于大气污染。\n相反,在台湾地区非吸烟者肺癌中,确认了中国传统医学中用作利尿剂、镇痛剂、抗炎剂等的马头铃和与植物中含有的阿里斯托克酸相关的特定突变特征。\n研究组指出:\"该物质与膀胱、胃肠、肾脏、肝癌等有关联\",\"该研究暗示该物质有可能对肺癌的发生做出贡献。\"\n亚历山德罗夫教授表示:\"在该研究中,还发现了大部分出现在非吸烟者肺癌中,但吸烟者没有的新突变标志\",\"这与大气污染或其他已知环境暴露没有关系,原因也不明确,因此有必要对此进行进一步研究。\"",

    "title": "$750 a month, no questions asked, improved the lives of homeless people",
    "text": "LOS ANGELES — If 100 homeless people were given $750 per month for a year, no questions asked, what would they spend it on? That question was at the core of a controlled study conducted by a San Francisco-based nonprofit and the USC Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work. The results were so promising that the researchers decided to publish results after only six months. The answer: food, 36.6%; housing, 19.5%; transportation, 12.7%; clothing, 11.5%; and health care, 6.2%, leaving only 13.6% uncategorized. Those who got the stipend were less likely to be unsheltered after six months and able to meet more of their basic needs than a control group that got no money, and half as likely as the control group to have an episode of being unsheltered. “I felt there was enough interest and the initial findings were compelling enough that it was important to get those results out,” said Benjamin Henwood, director of the Center for Homelessness, Housing and Health Equity Research at the Dworak-Peck School, who led the study. People are also reading… “It may not be earth-shattering that providing money is going to help meet basic needs, but I do think it dispels this myth that people will use money for illicit purposes,” Henwood said. “We weren’t finding that in the study.” About 2% of the total went to alcohol, cigarettes and drug expenses — the largest portion of which was cigarettes, Henwood said. The participants submit monthly reports on their spending and are surveyed in more detail quarterly. A follow-up report will be published after participants have received the funds for a full year. But Henwood said the main findings were robust enough that they were unlikely to change. The study arose from Miracle Messages, a San Francisco-based nonprofit that sends volunteers to the streets and shelters to befriend homeless people and try to make connections with the loved ones who lost contact with them. Next founder and chief executive Kevin F. Adler started Miracle Friends, matching homeless people to volunteer phone buddies for weekly calls. That evolved into Miracle Money when volunteers began asking Adler whether it was OK to give their buddies a few dollars. “You asked me to be a friend to this person, but they don’t know what they’re going to eat tonight,” Adler said they would tell him. Adler didn’t think the volunteers should hand out their own money. But the idea of cash support appealed to him. After a pilot showed promise, Adler got a grant to expand to Los Angeles. He hired two recruiters to canvass homeless shelters. They enlisted more than 200 clients who met the criteria of being at least 18 years old and homeless and expressed interest in having a phone buddy. Rather than just give money away, Adler hoped to document its effect. He teamed up with Henwood, who devised the controlled study. The participants were divided randomly into two groups. One group of 103 received stipends. The others were told they were on a waiting list. After six months, only 12% of those who received funds reported being unsheltered at any time in the prior month, a dramatic decrease from 30% at the outset. Those on the waiting list also reported fewer unsheltered episodes, but by a much smaller margin, from 28% to 23%. The cash recipients also said they were better able to meet their basic needs. On a scale of 1 (completely) to 5 (not at all), they dropped from about 3.75 on average to just over 3.25. The control group did not budge from 3.75. Among those receiving the funds, some found permanent housing, even though the money fell far below average rents in the area, Henwood said. “It seems like it’s opening up possibilities in different ways,” he said. “They might have a friend or relative that may not be willing to support them completely, but if they have something to contribute that opens up a room.” In other cases, the money created opportunities, even for people who remained unsheltered. “I spent a lot of the money on food on the go,” one participant told the researchers. “Simple, cheap things like bean and cheese burritos. I eat on the run while I bike/work for DoorDash. I also bought a membership to REI, so I could get my bike fixed for free.” “It’s not a single path forward,” Henwood said. “It’s a lot of resourcefulness and creativity.” 20 facts about homelessness in the US According to HUD, there were 582,462 people experiencing homelessness in the U.S. in January 2022 The U.S. has seen a 0.3% increase in homelessness since 2020 Conversely, the U.S. has seen an 8.6% decrease in homelessness since 2010 Experts from HUD believe that resources from the American Rescue Plan directed toward homelessness assistance lessened the impact of COVID-19 on homelessness The marked increase in rental prices during COVID-19 likely contributed to the recent rise in homelessness HUD's Emergency Rental Assistance program received more than 12 million applications for assistance between August 2021 and January 2022 A greater proportion of people experiencing homelessness were unsheltered in 2022 compared to 2020 40% of all people experiencing homelessness in the U.S. during 2022 were unsheltered Chronic homelessness has increased 15.5% since 2020 Veteran homelessness has decreased by 11% since 2020 and more than 50% since 2010 Family and youth homelessness have both decreased since 2020 50,767 families with children experienced homelessness in 2022 Since 2020, unaccompanied youth homelessness has decreased by 12% 6,398 parenting youth taking care of 7,898 children experienced homelessness in 2022, down 13% since 2020 From 2020 to 2022, the number of people who identified as Hispanic or Latino who experienced homelessness rose by 8% The number of people who identify as Hispanic and experienced unsheltered homelessness in 2022 rose 16% since 2020",

    "text": "Justice Department says new Texas immigration law violates Constitution\nBy Priscilla Alvarez and Michael Williams, CNN\nWashington (CNN) — A new law that gives local law enforcement in Texas the authority to arrest migrants “violates the US Constitution,” the Department of Justice said in a letter to Gov. Greg Abbott on Thursday, threatening to sue unless Abbott backs down from enforcing it.\nThe letter, obtained by CNN, marks the latest escalation between President Joe Biden and Abbott over the handling of the US-Mexico border.\nEarlier this month, Abbott, a Republican, signed into law the measure, known as\n Senate Bill 4, which gives local law enforcement the power to arrest migrants and gives judges the ability to issue orders to remove people from the United States. The White House slammed the law, calling it “incredibly extreme.” It’s expected to take effect in March.\nPrincipal deputy assistant attorney general Brian Boynton said in his letter to Abbott Thursday that “the United States intends to file suit to enjoin the enforcement of SB 4 unless Texas agrees to refrain from enforcing the law.”\nWhile the federal government is “committed to … securing the border,” Boynton wrote, the Texas law is “contrary to these goals.”\nThe ongoing surge of migrants at the US-Mexico border has placed immense pressure on local and federal resources. Thursday’s legal threat follows a DOJ lawsuit against Texas earlier this year over the state’s use of\n floating barriers in the Rio Grande. That lawsuit is still making its way through the courts.\nThe enforcement of immigration law is a federal responsibility, and opponents of the Texas measure argue it’s unconstitutional.\nThe law has sent ripples of fear throughout the Latino community in Texas, which makes up\n40% of the state’s population. Civil-rights groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, filed a lawsuit seeking to block the measure.\nThe Justice Department’s threat to sue comes on the heels of a\nhigh-levels talks between senior US and Mexican officials this week\nOfficials from both countries described talks as productive, and Mexican officials are\nexpected to visit Washington next month to continue the discussions.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.
