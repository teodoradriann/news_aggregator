    "title": "Rory McIlroy Advised to Shake Up His Team Despite Players Championship Victory: The Billy Foster Opportunity",
    "text": "Taking the golf world by storm, Rory McIlroy clinched his much-anticipated second Players Championship title, outperforming J.J. Spaun in a gripping three-hole playoff that had fans on the edge of their seats. Yet, despite the undeniable prowess displayed by the Northern Irishman, there are voices suggesting a drastic shift in his game plan could be the key to his future triumphs.\nOne such voice is that of former European Tour player, Nick O’Hern. Known for his significant contributions to both the European and PGA Tours during the 2000s, O’Hern reached his career peak with a world ranking of 16 in January 2007. Today, he brings his insights to the masses through his popular golf podcast.\nOn a recent episode, O’Hern put forth a bold proposition: McIlroy should consider a change in his entourage, in particular, replacing his caddie, Harry Diamond. O’Hern’s rationale? The recent split between Matt Fitzpatrick and his esteemed caddie, Billy Foster, has opened up a ripe opportunity for McIlroy to bring fresh expertise into his camp.\nO’Hern suggests that crucial moments in high-stakes tournaments require not just skill, but also an experienced caddie who can lend strategic insight, something he believes Foster can offer. He cites the US Open last year as an example, where he believes a miscalculated club selection on the 15th hole led to McIlroy’s defeat.\nAccording to O’Hern, a caddie like Foster could have steered McIlroy away from that mistake, positioning him for a stronger finish. “Billy Foster is the kind of guy who would say to Rory, ‘We are not doing this. We are going to do this right here,'” O’Hern explained on his podcast.\nHe contrasted this with Diamond’s approach, which he perceives as more passive, often deferring to McIlroy’s judgement. O’Hern’s argument underscores the vital role a caddie plays in pivotal moments, potentially making or breaking a player’s performance.\nFoster is no stranger to the pressures of the golf course. His illustrious career includes stints with golf greats like Seve Ballesteros, Sergio Garcia, and Lee Westwood. He even guided Fitzpatrick to a 2022 US Open victory and a sixth-place ranking in the world.\nHowever, Fitzpatrick’s recent slump, including missed cuts at the Phoenix Open and The Players, led to the dissolution of his partnership with Foster. With the Ryder Cup looming, Fitzpatrick is undoubtedly seeking a return to form and a secure spot on Luke Donald’s European team.\nAs the dust settles from McIlroy’s Players Championship win, it remains to be seen whether he will heed O’Hern’s advice. Will he stick to his tested formula or will he shake things up by bringing in a new caddie? Only time will tell.",

    "text": "ALBANY, N.Y. (TND) — Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Thursday blasted his Democratic colleagues over their handling of the ongoing migrant crisis. Writing an op-ed in The Hill, Cuomo likened the Democrats’ current strategy to that of a failing NFL team. We’re in the middle of the NFL playoffs, leading to the Super Bowl. Winning teams focus on perfecting their strategy — they do not rely on the hope that the other team loses,” Cuomo [wrote]. “Today, Democrats are too reliant on Trump being unelectable rather than focusing on the positive case for their victory.” He continued, highlighting the migrant crisis as an example of the “ineffectiveness” of Democratic leaders. “For example, the migrant issue is creating mayhem across the country and showing the ineffectiveness and schisms in the Democratic Party,” Cuomo wrote. “President Joe Biden’s administration has not been able to solve the migrant problem, primarily because of the divided opinion within our own party. The Republican ploy of putting migrants on buses to blue cities only serves to highlight the Democrats’ failure to anticipate the consequences of Biden’s border policies and continuing failure to fashion a workable solution.” READ MORE | [ Migrant stole $10K worth of merchandise from Chicago-area Macy's, prosecutors say](https://thenationaldesk.com/news/americas-news-now/migrant-stole-10k-worth-of-merchandise-from-chicago-area-macys-prosecutors-say-illegal-immigrant-10000-money-stolen-crome-southern-border-sanctuary-city-venezuela-chile-dupage-county?fbclid=IwAR3O6HofnNL2Vme6jMtRQGAF6B8YxXEuBZft8N_KsFzaUQLDKZxbXgJ7g6k) The party, Cuomo said, suffers from a “lack of logic” in its approach to such a critical issue. “The lack of logic, practicality, sustainability and fairness in managing the migrant issue is obvious to all. The president, governor and mayor are all blamed by the public for the obvious failure. It must be resolved,” Cuomo wrote. “We have learned this lesson before: Ignoring a problem, no matter how difficult, only makes it worse. Before we can expect the American people to believe in the Democratic agenda, we must have a defined Democratic agenda.” Just because Donald Trump is mired in legal troubles, Cuomo closed, does not mean Democrats have a pass to do as they please between now and November. “Donald Trump cannot win the election, but Democrats can lose the election,” he said. “We cannot wager that citizens will vote against Trump, but rather give them a reason to vote for Democrats. We must make the positive case for a Democratic future — the negative case against Trump makes itself.” Cuomo resigned from his position as New York governor in 2021 after a series of sexual harassment allegations.",

    "text": "Notícia\nInovação\nSolução do Crea-RN e Serpro vence hackathon e é destaque em congresso do Confea\nCrédito Foto: Solano Petta/Crea-RN\nA solução inovadora \"RUN - Registro Único Nacional\", desenvolvida por uma equipe formada por profissionais do Conselho Regional de Engenharia e Agronomia do Rio Grande do Norte (Crea-RN) e do Serpro, foi premiada no 1º Hackathon do Sistema Confea/Crea e Mútua. A proposta foi um dos destaques da 79ª Semana Oficial da Engenharia e da Agronomia (SOEA), realizada em Salvador entre os dias 7 e 10 de outubro.\nDenominado “\nConfea Open Day”, o hackathon foi promovido em julho e agosto deste ano e teve como principal desafio desenvolver uma plataforma unificada para o registro de engenheiros, agrônomos e geocientistas de todo o Brasil, facilitando a mobilidade profissional e eliminando a necessidade de vistos adicionais em cada estado. A equipe vencedora, que apresentou o projeto \"RUN\", distinguiu-se pela capacidade de otimizar a mobilidade dos profissionais do Sistema, simplificando os processos de registro e gestão de dados.\n\"O RUN foi projetado para lidar com o grande volume de dados do Confea, proporcionando uma experiência fluida e eficiente para os profissionais\", explicou o secretário Estratégico do Crea-RN, Claudionaldo Câmara. A plataforma também visa reduzir a burocracia ao automatizar a comunicação de vistos para os Creas.\nPara Leonardo David Jorge Correa, analista de negócio do Serpro e um dos integrantes do time vencedor, a solução \"RUN\" marca um avanço significativo. \"Nossa proposta oferece um novo paradigma para a mobilidade profissional: o check-in elimina a necessidade de solicitar visto a cada nova unidade federativa, facilitando a atuação em todo o território nacional\", complementou o analista que também compôs o grupo que apresentou a inovação na 79ª SOEA.\nRegistro Único Nacional\nAlém de Leonardo Correa, a equipe RUN foi composta por três funcionários do Crea-RN: a engenheira civil e inspetora, Bianca Monike, a engenheira de produção e chefe das Inspetorias, Cristhiane Cirilo, e o desenvolvedor e coordenador de sistemas, Jarbson Costa. No período de construção da solução, o grupo contou também com um time de retaguarda encabeçado pelo gerente de Negócio para Governo e Privado do Serpro, Carlos Alexandria, e por Claudionaldo Câmara, que também foi mentor do projeto.\nCarlos Alexandria ressaltou que a parceria entre o Crea/RN e o Serpro já é de longa data, sendo o conselho potiguar pioneiro na adoção de diversas soluções da empresa, como a carteira profissional via plataforma ProID e o sistema de autoridade de registro. Além disso, tem sido referência na utilização de produtos relacionados à LGPD.\n“Essa colaboração não apenas tem fortalecido o sistema Confea/Crea em vários estados, mas também culminou nesta recente vitória do Crea-RN com o apoio da empresa no hackathon nacional, e que contou com a participação de mais de 60 equipes. É um grande orgulho para o Serpro ter contribuído para essa conquista e participar do SOEA em Salvador, demonstrando o avanço contínuo dessa parceria”, celebrou Alexandria.\nHackathon foi um marco para o Confea\nO presidente do Conselho Federal de Engenharia e Agronomia (Confea), Vinicius Marchese, declarou no evento de premiação a importância do hackathon para o Sistema. \"Fundamental para a nossa gestão, pois nos permite colher novas ideias que podem transformar o Sistema, tornando-o mais eficiente e acessível\", analisou Marchese.\n“A solução vencedora reflete essa visão ao unificar os registros profissionais em uma única plataforma, beneficiando os profissionais e agilizando os processos administrativos”, completou Leonardo Correa.\nRoberto Wagner, presidente do\nCrea-RN, também comemorou a conquista. \"Ganhar o primeiro lugar no hackathon é um reconhecimento do potencial inovador do Crea-RN. Estamos comprometidos em buscar soluções criativas e eficazes, e este resultado demonstra o impacto positivo de nossa abordagem\", descreveu Wagner.\nSemana Oficial da Engenharia e da Agronomia\nA equipe RUN apresentou seu projeto vencedor do hackathon no palco da Arena Inovação, na tarde do terceiro dia (9/10) da 79ª SOEA, realizada em Salvador, de 7 a 10 de outubro. O evento é promovido pelo Sistema Confea/Crea, em parceria com a Mútua, e teve como tema central em 2024: \"Educação, Tecnologia e Inovação para um futuro sustentável\".\nA\n79ª Semana Oficial da Engenharia e da Agronomia reuniu líderes e profissionais de diferentes áreas para uma agenda de capacitação, networking e discussões sobre os principais desafios e oportunidades para o desenvolvimento do Brasil relacionadas ao setor, buscando contribuir para a evolução da área tecnológica nacional.",
