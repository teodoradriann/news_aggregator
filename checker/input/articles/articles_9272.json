    "text": "Internacional: ataque de drone mata três palestinos na Cisjordânia Publicado em 22/08/2024 - 18:27 Por Anna Luísa Praser - repórter da TV Brasil - Brasília O dia hoje foi de avaliação dos danos no campo de Tulkarm, na Cisjordânia, após um ataque de drone israelense que deixou três palestinos mortos, segundo o Ministério da Saúde Local. A cidade superlotada abriga famílias de refugiados da guerra do Oriente Médio de 1948. Em comunicado, Israel afirmou que os alvos eram militares armados, que suas tropas enfrentaram combates e descobriram explosivos improvisados sob o asfalto. Já os moradores disseram que tiros e explosões puderam ser ouvidos durante toda a manhã. Os confrontos na Cisjordânia aumentaram drasticamente à medida que as forças israelenses intensificaram as operações contra grupos armados, incluindo Hamas e a Jihad Islâmica. Sudão No Sudão, a crise humanitária aumentou os casos de infecção por cólera. Em julho, foram quase 600 registros da doença. As condições climáticas, as enchentes e a grande quantidade de água contaminada pioraram as condições do país que está em guerra civil desde o ano passado. Venezuela Na Venezuela, a presidente do Tribunal de Justiça, Caryslia Rodríguez, informou que o Supremo analisou o material da autoridade eleitoral e concorda que Maduro venceu as eleições. Ainda de acordo com a Corte, não cabe recurso à decisão. A autoridade eleitoral afirmou que Maduro obteve pouco mais da metade dos votos, embora não tenha publicado a contagem completa. Os documentos usados na análise do Supremo ficaram sob tutela judicial, que não divulgou as atas da eleição. A oposição contestou a decisão do Tribunal e diz que seu candidato, Edmundo González, teve mais de 67% dos votos. *Com informações da Agência Reuters Edição: Rádio Nacional",

    "text": "- Plus Madagascar et la FAO nouent un partenariat pour renforcer la sécurité alimentaire Le ministère malgache de la Santé publique et l'Organisation des Nations Unies pour l'alimentation et l'agriculture (FAO) ont signé jeudi un projet de partenariat, visant à renforcer la sécurité alimentaire à Madagascar. Selon un communiqué publié jeudi par le ministère, les marchés malgaches sont saturés de produits alimentaires à divers additifs tels que conservateurs, édulcorants, colorants artificiels et exhausteurs de goût, présentant des risques sérieux pour la santé publique, notamment pour les enfants, les femmes enceintes et les personnes âgées. Cependant, souligne le ministère, les laboratoires d'Etat ne disposent pas encore d'équipements nécessaires pour effectuer les contrôles essentiels. Le projet, intitulé \"Assistance technique au contrôle de qualité et suivi de sécurité sanitaire des aliments\", vise à former et à doter les équipes techniques des moyens pour qu'elles puissent réaliser des contrôles rigoureux et précis des additifs alimentaires, conformément aux normes en vigueur, explique le ministère. Il prévoit également d'équiper les laboratoires de matériel moderne et de haute précision, indispensable pour mener à bien les analyses nécessaires, ajoute le communiqué. Le ministère malgache de la Santé publique, en tant que garant de la santé des consommateurs, est chargé de s'assurer que tous les aliments consommés, distribués et commercialisés respectent les normes de sécurité et d'hygiène, tant au niveau national qu'international.",

    "text": "The powerful Auschwitz-set psychological horror film, \\\"The Zone of Interest\\\", which on Sunday won the Oscar for best international film, stunned critics with its penetrating study of the banality in the shadow of the death camp.The victory marks the first time that a submission from Britain has won the Academy Award in this category, which is open to non-English language films made by countries other than the United States.\\\"Our film shows where dehumanisation leads at its worst. It's shaped all of our past and present,\\\" said British director Jonathan Glazer as he accepted the award, before issuing a strong statement about the conflict in Gaza.— Kahlissee (@Kahlissee) \\\"Right now, we stand here as men who refute their Jewishness and the Holocaust being hijacked by an occupation which has led to conflict for so many innocent people,\\\" said Glazer, who is Jewish.\\\"Whether the victims of October the 7th in Israel, or the ongoing attack on Gaza, all the victims of this dehumanisation, how do we resist?\\\" 108374566See More: Oscar 2024 LIVE Updates: Robert Downey Jr wins Best Actor award for 'Oppenheimer'!The German-language film, which earned a total of five Oscar nods and won three BAFTAs, focuses on the family of Rudolf Hoess, the longest-serving commandant of the Auschwitz camp, who lived a stone's throw from the gas chambers.While the screams and gunshots are audible from their beautiful garden, Hoess (Christian Friedel), his wife Hedwig (Sandra Hueller, an Oscar nominee for \\\"Anatomy of a Fall\\\") and their children carry on as though nothing is amiss.They pull the curtains to mask the rising smoke from the incinerators, they use their pool -- life carries on, even when the death trains arrive to disgorge their doomed passengers. At one point, Hedwig samples a lipstick she found in the pocket of a fur coat stripped from a gassed woman. She rejoices when she finds a diamond in a confiscated tube of toothpaste. The horror \\\"is just bearing down on every pixel of every shot, in sound and how we interpret that sound... It affects everything but them,\\\" Glazer told AFP at last year's Cannes film festival where 'Zone' won the Grand Prix, the runner-up prize. 108377329\\\"Everything had to be very carefully calibrated to feel that it was always there -- this ever-present, monstrous machinery,\\\" he said.Hedwig's mother eventually recoils at what is happening beyond the house's walls, but most of the family's friends and acquaintances are utterly indifferent.The 58-year-old Glazer focused on the apparent normality of daily lives around the death camp, viewing Hoess's family not as obvious monsters but as terrifyingly ordinary.\\\"The things that drive these people are familiar -- nice house, nice garden, healthy kids,\\\" he said.\\\"How like them are we?\\\"The \\\"zone of interest\\\" is what the Nazis called the 40-square-kilometre area surrounding Auschwitz. The film is based on Martin Amis' 2014 novel of the same name.The film has earned near-universal acclaim, with The Hollywood Reporter calling it a \\\"bone-chilling Holocaust drama like no other\\\", and Variety hailing it as \\\"profound, meditative and immersive\\\".But some criticised Glazer for not showing Auschwitz itself, the largest Nazi concentration camp where more than 1.1 million people, most of them Jewish, lost their lives, according to the site's museum.- 'I cogitate a lot' -The director is known for taking his time: \\\"The Zone of Interest\\\" came a decade after his last film, the acclaimed, deeply strange sci-fi \\\"Under the Skin\\\" (2013) starring Scarlett Johansson.Glazer first made his name with music videos for Radiohead, Blur and Massive Attack in the 1990s before moving into films with \\\"Sexy Beast\\\" (2000) and \\\"Birth\\\" (2004). 108377766\\\"I cogitate a lot. I think a lot about what I'm going to make, good or bad,\\\" he said.\\\"This particular subject obviously is a vast, profound topic and deeply sensitive for many reasons and I couldn't just approach it casually.\\\"Beyond Amis' novel, Glazer spent two years reading other books and accounts on the subject before beginning to map out the film with collaborators.The film bested \\\"Perfect Days\\\" from Wim Wenders, \\\"The Teachers' Lounge\\\", \\\"Society of the Snow\\\" and \\\"Io Capitano\\\" for the Oscar.",

    "text": "Top French chef quits restaurant after naked ‘hazing’ of kitchen staff A French chef and rising star of [the country’s culinary scene](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/food-and-drink/features/best-french-restaurants-to-book-uk-2024/) has been forced to quit his luxury restaurant after a rite-of-passage ritual reportedly occurred in his kitchen, where a new member of staff was allegedly tied naked to a chair and stuffed with fruit and vegetables. Aurélien Largeau was said to have been filmed at a “hazing” ceremony of a young commis at the historic Hôtel du Palais Biarritz in south-west France where he had run his [Michelin-starred](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/columnists/2022/09/03/british-cuisine-has-taken-shine-frances-michelin-stars/) fine-dining restaurant La Table d’Aurélien Largeau, according to the local newspaper Sud Ouest. The commis, or junior member of the kitchen staff, was claimed to have been initiated to the kitchens on Dec 2 by being bound naked to a chair with an apple in his mouth and a carrot in another part of his body as the rest of the “kitchen brigade” looked on. When one member of the kitchen staff tried to intervene, she was thrown out of the kitchen, according to Sud Ouest, which interviewed several hotel employees. In a statement to the French news TV channel BFMTV on Thursday, Mr Largeau denounced what he called “defamatory and false comments” and called the allegations a “monstrous attack” on his “honour” and his “formidable teams”. But as of last week, Mr Largeau is no longer associated with the restaurant, which said it was aware of a “worrying incident”. After the video was posted online, images eventually reached hotel management, who ordered employees to delete them and tasked their IT department with erasing all online traces of the incident. According to Sud Ouest, the victim did not file a complaint and reportedly said that he “asked to be hazed” but outraged employees called out Mr Largeau, 31, for not intervening. “This is an outburst of a sexual nature, in the workplace, that the boss should have interrupted,” an unnamed employee told the newspaper. A native of La Rochelle, Mr Largeau started his career at the Biarritz hotel as a commis, before working at other restaurants including the Michelin-starred establishments La Maison d’à Côté and La Table d’à Côté under Christophe Hay, as the latter restaurant earned its first Michelin star. Not long after, in 2019, he was named a “Young Talent” by the French restaurant guide Gault&Millau. The following year, he moved full circle back to the Hôtel du Palais, and within a year earned the highest rating of three chefs’ hats from the same guide. His signature dish is blue lobster grilled with pine needles. A glowing review from Gilles Pudlowski, one of France’s most influential food critics, in June this year described the dish as “magnificent” and said that Mr Largeau’s cooking alone merits a trip to Biarritz. On social media, an excerpt from an interview he gave to Gault&Millau last year is also making the rounds for his reference to the leadership lessons he learnt from his chef mentor Hay. “He offered me my first job as a chef and made me aware of the demands of gourmet cuisine, products and people management.” Police have opened a preliminary investigation for sexual assault and violence. The Hôtel du Palais, which is under the management of the Hyatt group, was built by [Napoleon III](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/france/why-remains-napoleon-iii-better-britain/) as a summer residence for his wife, Empress Eugenie, in 1854 and is often described as the jewel of Biarritz. Throughout history it has attracted the international elite, including [Ernest Hemingway](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/06/24/ernest-hemingway-novel-trigger-warning-penguin-offensive/), [Frank Sinatra](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/fame-fortune/bbc-antiques-roadshow-jewellery-expert-sold-frank-sinatra/) and British royalty such as [Queen Victoria](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/11/29/queen-victoria-christmas-tree-decorations-auction/), King Edward VII and the Duke of Connaught. Rooms at the five-star luxury resort cost on average €400 (£348) a night. In a statement to French television, a spokesman for the Hôtel du Palais confirmed that they were aware of a “worrying incident that took place on the premises of the hotel”. They added: “This incident does not reflect the values that we all defend, an investigation was carried out and the appropriate decisions were taken.” The incident also throws light on abusive kitchen culture in France. While French law bans hazing, the practice remains a rite of passage in some kitchens to test junior staff members. In recent years, the restaurant industry has seen campaigns against violence in the kitchens akin to [MeToo](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/11/23/metoo-movement-menopause-female-executive-discrimination/) called “Hands off my kitchen hand” and “Respect your kitchen”.",

    "text": "[acl](/user/acl)a [video.hardlimit.com](/go/link/3890193)\nEn los 80 nadie veía con recelo usar un ratón para trabajar con Word para MS-DOS o Autocad. Para algunos parece que no hubiese vida antes de Windows en el PC.\nMás que con recelo veíamos que no servía para nada y ralentizaba muchísimo el ordenador. En aquella época lo normal era tener un 486 con ms-dos moviendo doom y aventuras gráficas de lucasarts, además de tener el wordperfect, 3dstudio, Lotus123, autocad y todo tipo de probramas de trabajo. En las oficinas de normies se usaba bastante el windows 3.11 para facilitar el trabajo a los que no sabían reciclarse en su puesto o para aquellas empresas en las que un comercial les había vendido la moto. Pero vamos, que windows era para los ceporros que no eran capaces de aprenderse cuatro comandos para arrancar su programa y trabajar. Que no hacía falta aprender scripting. Que bastaba con un \"cd wordperf\" -> \"wp\".\nLuego ya llegó windows 95 a convertir tu pentium100 moviendo Quake y Tomb Raider en una calculadora que no era capaz de mover el procesador de textos si no le metías 8Mb de ram.\nEs normal que viesemos con recelo la imposición de un sistema operativo que no funcionaba y que nos obligaba a renovar una máquina que funcionaba muy bien, para que todo en general funcionase más lento y el trabajo fuese menos eficiente. Por que la verdad, paseando punteros se pierden muchas horas de trabajo al año, por que ni se aprendieron los comandos en su día ni se aprenden las hotkeys ahora.\n[#14](c14#c-14) Yo me llegue a instalar un Linux en 1995 porque el Windows95 se cargaba mi recien comprado PC, pero no consegui que funcionara la red, asi que al final compre mucha memoria y medio tiraba con el windows95, pero era compilar algo con el Borland C++ y ... con decirte que me dedicaba a hacer flexiones cuando se ponia a compilar y me puse cuadrao ese anio. Y no estoy de conia, es que de verdad hice eso.\nQué tiempos... Me he acordado del \"Windows 3.11 para trabajo en grupo\", instalando redes cableadas, antes del NT y la saga del 95, 98, ME, etc.\n[#11](c11#c-11) Himem.sys comprobando la memoria extendida.\n(Hasta que conseguí que mi cabeza leyera himem y no himen )",
