    "title": "Multiple Pride flag thefts reported across metro Denver | Crime & Justice | denvergazette.com",
    "text": "For the past four years, Mike Horan has hung a Pride flag outside of his Lakewood home during the month of June. He's never had any issues until June 9, when two masked men came to his home and stole the flag. In the surveillance video, the men arrived around 3 a.m., removed the flag and then flipped off the camera. It appears they had already stolen another flag prior to arriving at Horan's home. \"It was just somebody expressing their displeasure at me supporting a marginalized community,\" said Horan. He noticed the missing flag the next morning when he woke up. \"I noticed my flag was gone so I pulled up the Ring camera and there was the footage of a few gentlemen stealing the flag,\" said Horan. Within two minutes of stealing the flag, they returned with a note written on toilet paper. On one side, it had a racial slur. On the other, a homophobic slur written. Horan reported it to Lakewood Police the same day. He asked that they consider it a hate crime due to the note that was included. Content warning: The video below contains an obscene gesture that may offend some viewers. \"It’s not hurting anyone. If you don’t like it, don’t look at it,\" said Horan. \"They’re human beings like everyone else.\" He has since replaced the flag with a newer, larger one. He has two padlocks on it now to make it harder to remove. He plans to remove it at night and leave it up only during the day. \"First, theft is not the right answer. You shouldn’t steal anything from anybody. Second, guys, get a life. Seriously, find something productive to do with your time,\" said Horan. The stolen flag comes at a time when incidents have been reported across the metro including Arvada and Wheat Ridge. So far this month, six Pride flags have been stolen in Arvada in the first twelve days of Pride month. Last week, Colorado Republican Chairman Dave Williams published an anti-LGBTQ+ email from the state party to supporters titled “God Hates Pride” and called for supporters to \"burn all the Pride flags.\" The Arvada Police Department is looking for at least three people who they say are responsible for the thefts in northwest Arvada. Arvada Police released pictures of one person involved in the thefts. Police also released a picture of a newer, gray, four-door sedan that the thieves may be driving in, according to police. Anyone who has information to help identify these people or has been the victim of a similar incident and has not yet reported it is asked to call Arvada Police at 720-898-6900. Can you help us identify this suspect? The pictured individual is suspected of being involved in several Pride flag thefts around Arvada in recent weeks.— Arvada Police (@ArvadaPolice) We are investigating six similar incidents involving at least three individuals stealing Pride flags displayed in front of… [pic.twitter.com/SbbwYeNFBn] [June 13, 2024] For more information on the [Pride flag thefts in Lakewood](https://www.9news.com/article/news/local/pride-flag-stolen-lakewood-home/73-d774c4ff-baea-4198-8db2-ed2afb56efdd) and [Arvada](https://www.9news.com/article/news/local/arvada-pride-flag-thefts/73-b7e5a65e-e634-481e-85d0-cb0aac9a4536), visit our news partners, 9NEWS.

    "title": "Roboski massacre victims commemorated with demand for justice 12 years on",
    "text": "Roboski massacre victims commemorated with demand for justice 12 years on 12 years after the massacre that killed 34 people, including 19 children, in the village of Roboski in the southeastern province of Şırnak, the village still bears the lasting scars of the massacre as justice remains elusive. Then-Prime Minister Erdoğan did not keep his promises he gave in the aftermath of the massacre, said Sadık Alma who lost his son in the Turkish army airstrikes. Hacı Bişkin / Gazete Duvar Roboski villagers in the southeastern province of Şırnak and politicians commemorated on Dec. 28 those killed in an airstrike, as the village continues to exhibit pain and suffering 12 years on. A total of 34 people, mostly children, were killed in an airstrike by the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK) in Şırnak's border village of Roboski on Dec. 28, 2011. The bombs left bodies dismembered, with families unable to identify their loved ones. The pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Equality and Democracy (DEM) Party co-chair Tülay Hatimoğulları also attended the commemoration. Sadık Alma, who lost his son 25-year-old Nadir Alma in the massacre, said that his pain is still fresh. Alma, who was among the delegation that met with the then-Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said that Erdoğan did not keep his promise he gave after the massacre. Alma said the attitude towards Kurds in Turkey has not changed 12 years on. “They tried to silence us. We did not remain silent. We resisted. Lawsuits were filed against us. But at this point, we, as Roboski families, have given up hope.” Then-Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan met with the Roboski families for the first time on July 26, 2013. “Erdoğan told us, 'I know about the case. I did not give the (airstrike) instruction. If you want, get the compensation, we will give you some positions from the state. I know everything. I promise to do my best.’ 12 years have passed. He didn't keep his promise. He was implicitly implying that the lawsuit we filed as Roboski families would not yield any results. That’s what happened,” Alma said. “They tried to silence us by offering (public employee) positions. If you are wondering, let me tell you that most of the compensation mentioned was not given either,” he added. Alma lastly noted that Erdoğan was covering up Roboski, but “the world knows what happened in Roboski. This massacre took place in front of the world.” Zeynep Encu, who lost 11 of her relatives in the airstrike, said they had more anger than mourning. “We were detained. Our houses were raided. A mother's son was murdered, one son was taken into custody, and one went to prison. The massacre was covered up. This silence made us very tired. We will not give up on our case. Many parties visited us. We have a request from them. When they go to the parliamentary rostrum, let them say justice to Roboski with one voice. Let them reopen the closed file,” she said. The Roboski families' search for justice both in domestic courts and in the international arena failed. Right after the massacre, the families filed a complaint in order for those responsible to be tried, but after years of waiting, a military prosecutor's office dismissed the case. The families in 2014 took the case to the Constitutional Court, which deemed it inadmissible due to errors in the submission that stemmed from the Şırnak Bar Association's serious mistakes. The latest blow to the Roboski families was dealt by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) when it dismissed their appeal on the grounds that domestic legal means weren't exhausted since the files weren't submitted properly to the Constitutional Court. On the other hand, former main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP) deputy Levent Gök had a monument built for Roboski with the proceeds of his book “Roboski: Uludere’s Tears,” Ceren Bayar from Gazete Duvar reported. The monument, which could not be placed due to winter conditions, will be placed in the village when the winter conditions disappear. \"I commemorate with mercy the 34 civilians who were bombed and murdered in Uludere 12 years ago. We will not let this massacre be forgotten until all those responsible, who are protected because of a lack of effective investigation, are tried and the truth is revealed,\" CHP leader Özgür Özel said in a tweet. Uludere'de 12 yıl önce bombalanarak katledilen 34 sivil yurttaşımızı rahmetle anıyorum.— Özgür Özel (@eczozgurozel) Bu katliamı etkili soruşturma yapılamadığı için korunan tüm sorumlular yargılanana ve gerçekler açığa çıkana kadar unutturmayacağız.

    "text": "Share this article on:\nThe Australian arm of a Japanese dairy company confirms hack by newcomer ransomware operation, limited employee data compromised.\nAustralian dairy supplier Snow Brand Australia has confirmed it was the victim of a recent ransomware attack by the Safepay ransomware gang.\nSnow Brand was listed on the gang’s darknet leak site sometime in the last week, alongside 23 other victims. The gang appears to be a new operation, possibly based in Russia.\nSafepay’s leak site is very minimal, simply listing each victim, their revenue, and, where it has been published, leaks to the stolen data and file listings.\nIn Snow Brand’s case, the gang has published an archived dataset of almost 24 gigabytes in size. According to the file listing, it’s largely financial data such as invoices, purchase orders, and details of the company’s business with various retail partners, such as the Romeo Retail Group.\nAlso included is some employee data, such as medical certificates, superannuation details, and Medicare applications.\nSnow Brand Australia has confirmed the incident.\n“Snow Brand recently experienced a cyber incident where unusual activity was detected on our network,” a Snow Brand spokesperson told Cyber Daily.\n“We acted immediately to secure our network and initiate an investigation to understand what happened, including any impact to information.”\nThe Australian Cyber Security Centre and the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner have been notified of the incident, and the company has been in communication with individuals impacted by the data breach.\n“We otherwise confirm our systems are secure and Snow Brand remains fully operational.”\nSafepay is a new ransomware operation, with Snow Brand being one of its first victims. According to research by cyber security firm Huntress, Safepay only began operating within the last couple of months. As part of its ransomware attacks, the gang first checks for systems whose default language uses some form of Cyrillic characters, in which case the attack is aborted, suggesting the gang is based somewhere in Eastern Europe, possibly Russia.\nHuntress has tracked two specific Safepay incidents, and in both “the threat actor’s activity was found to originate from a VPN gateway or portal, as all observed IP addresses assigned to threat actor workstations were within the internal range”.\n“The threat actor was able to use valid credentials to access customer endpoints, and was not observed enabling RDP, nor creating new user accounts, nor creating any other persistence,” Huntress researchers said in a November 14 blog post.\nDavid Hollingworth has been writing about technology for over 20 years, and has worked for a range of print and online titles in his career. He is enjoying getting to grips with cyber security, especially when it lets him talk about Lego.",

    "text": "The\nPhillies magic number for the National League East is four games. As it happens, the Phillies will be playing their next four games against the second-place team in the division. Which means that if the Phillies win this series, they will clinch the division in the home stadium of one of their division rivals.\nWouldn’t that be nice?\nNew York Mets\nRecord: 84-61, Second place in National League East (Seven games back)\nThe last time they Met\nThe\nMets came to Philadelphia last weekend, and after Aaron Nola had a rough time in the series opener, the Phillies rebounded to win the next two thanks to unexpected heroes like Buddy Kennedy and Cal Stevenson.\nSince then?\nWhile the series loss to the Phillies severely damaged their hopes of winning the division, it clearly didn’t dishearten the Mets. They rebounded to sweep the Nationals, scoring 23 runs across the three-game series.\nWho’s cold?\nJ.D. Martinez has had a down season, and it’s been especially down lately. He’s batting just .163 over the past month, and it's been a minute since he last recorded a base hit. The six-time All Star just turned 37, and if the full-time DH can’t hit anymore, this might be the end of the road for him.\nJD Martinez needs a day off... Maybe 2 days off.— Mike Peters (@Mike_Peters_LGM)\nHe's 0 for his last 24\n[September 18, 2024]\nWho’s the Manaea?\nYou could probably guess that Francisco Lindor leads the Mets with 6.6 wins above replacement. But do you know who ranks second behind him? It’s pitcher Sean Manaea at 3.2. Manaea has gone slightly under the radar this season, but he’s had a very good year and has been excellent in the second half.\nSean Manaea's last 10 starts:— Frank Stampfl (@Roto_Frank)\n2.49 ERA, 0.80 WHIP, 75 K over 65 IP\nHe's gone 7 IP in six of those starts.\n[September 17, 2024]\nManaea will get the ball on Saturday, his third start against them this season. Of the previous two, one went well for him (One run in six innings), the other did not (Six runs in 3.2 innings). Let’s hope this start is another for the “not” category.\nAnother Acuña?\nThe Phillies caught a break when Braves star Ronald Acuña, Jr. missed most of the season with an injury. And now all of a sudden, there’s another Acuña in the division who looks like he could be a pain in their butts. Mets rookie shortstop Luisangel Acuña was arguably their best player in their sweep of the Nationals,\nImagine saying in April Acuña has played a big role late in the National League Wild Card race...— Mark Suleymanov (@TheMARKOut1)\n...And that Acuña being the one on the Mets, not the reigning MVP\n [September 19, 2024]\nTake care of business\nObviously, the Phillies are in the driver’s seat as far as the National League East goes, but it would be really nice if they made it official and didn’t give the Mets even the faintest glimpse of pulling off a miracle. (Also, if the Phillies have clinched the East, they can root for the Mets when they play the\nBrewers in the final series of the season.)\nAnd what of the wild card?\nThe Padres have a strong hold on one of the National League’s Wild Card berths, while the other two are still being contested by the Mets,\nArizona Diamondbacks, and Atlanta Braves.\nEach team in the National League Wild Card race snagged a win last night, so the Mets will head into their massive four-game set with the Phillies holding a two-game advantage over the Braves in the standings— SNY Mets (@SNY_Mets)\n[pic.twitter.com/9a2om4LmpV] [September 19, 2024]\nPhillies fans have reasons to dislike all three of those teams, and while it would be nice for all of them to miss the postseason, that fate will befall only one of them.\nThe Mark Brendanwicz award\nZack Wheeler\nWheeler is likely going to finish in the top two of National League Cy Young Award voting in 2024, but you may not have realized that the Phillies’ ace once pitched for their division rival, the New York Mets.\nJust kidding, we all knew he used to be a Met. I just wanted to make fun of the Mets for developing him so that he could become a star for the Phillies.\n\"[We] helped him parlay two good half-seasons over the last 5 years into $118 million\"— SNY (@SNYtv)\nBrodie Van Wagenen took a jab back at Zack Wheeler\n [pic.twitter.com/sHFv2yv2Lb] [February 14, 2020]\nWhere and when?\nBecause the television executives apparently think that Phillies vs. Mets will be a ratings draw, we’re going to get all four games of this series on different networks. Thursday night will be nationally televised by Fox. Friday is an AppleTV+ exclusive. Saturday afternoon’s game will be on NBC Sports Philadelphia, and the finale will be on ESPN’s Sunday Night Baseball.\nGood luck to everyone with relatives who aren’t tech savvy!\nClosing thought\nI haven’t gotten to see the Phillies clinch the National League East in 13 years. I’d love to see it happen this weekend.",
