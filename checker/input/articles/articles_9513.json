    "title": "Late rally fails to save Tottenham in 4-2 loss at Brighton | Malay Mail",
    "text": "> BRIGHTON, England, Dec 29 — Tottenham Hotspur’s top-four ambitions suffered a blow as they lost 4-2 at Brighton & Hove Albion in the Premier League yesterday with only a late rally saving them from their heaviest defeat since Ange Postecoglou became manager this season.\nVictory would have put injury-hit Spurs above Manchester City into fourth spot but they were mauled on the south coast as a Brighton side also missing key players ran riot.\nA powerful early strike by Josh Hinshelwood and Joao Pedro’s penalty gave the hosts a deserved 2-0 lead at halftime as Tottenham struggled to deal with Brighton’s intensity.\nThe visitors responded in the second half with Richarlison having a goal disallowed but when halftime substitute Pervis Estupinan sent a thunderbolt past Spurs keeper Guglielmo Vicario and Joao Pedro netted a second penalty the game seemed over.\nAdvertisement However, Tottenham’s late substitute Alejo Veliz fired home from close range in the 75th minute and Ben Davies scored with a header making a miraculous comeback suddenly look possible.\nMidfielder Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg hit the post for Spurs in stoppage time as Brighton looked nervy but they held on to move into eighth place in the table on 30 points while Tottenham remain fifth on 36, a point off the top four.\nThe final scoreline hardly did justice to a chaotic match in which Tottenham were second-best for long periods but showed some spirit to emerge with their pride intact.\nAdvertisement However Brighton, without the likes of winger Kaoru Mitoma, Tariq Lamptey, Solly March and Julio Enciso, were worthy winners as they snapped a three-match league sequence without a win.\n“It is a very disappointing performance. This is not how we’ve approached the season,” Spurs captain Son Heung-min said.\n“This performance was nowhere near the level we want to play at. But now is not the time to point fingers at each other because the games are coming fast.”\nTottenham host in-form Bournemouth on Sunday when they will be without Kulusevski who will be suspended after picking up another booking, while Brighton visit West Ham United on January 2.\nDefensive woes\nTottenham’s defensive problems, made worse by Argentine centre back Cristian Romero having been added to their long injury list, were exposed by Brighton as the hosts dominated the first half with some slick, high-intensity football.\nVicario had already made two fine saves before Hinshelwood was played in by Joao Pedro on the edge of the area and thumped an unstoppable shot high into the net.\nBrighton almost doubled their lead when Jan Paul van Hecke’s header hit the post and as the ball rebounded towards Danny Welbeck the striker was blatantly pulled back by Dejan Kulusevski with a penalty being awarded after a VAR check.\nJoao Pedro rolled the 23rd-minute spot kick past Vicario to put Brighton in command although Richarlison nearly responded just before halftime with a shot that kissed the post.\nSpurs looked brighter after the break and wasted several chances before Brazilian Richarlison netted, only to have his joy cut short as VAR showed he was offside.\nEstupinan made it 3-0 with a sensational strike from outside the area before Tottenham substitute Giovani Lo Celso conceded a penalty that Joao Pedro dispatched.\nA raft of substitutions revived Spurs with Bryan Gil and Veliz adding some energy to the visitors and the latter celebrated wildly as he slotted his first goal for the club.\nDavies headed in from close range and Tottenham then had numerous chances to try to grab an unlikely point although they can have no real complaints about leaving empty handed. — Reuters",

    "text": "zero proof habits Stay sober, not somber, this Dry January with 11 non-alcoholic alternatives Not all New Year's resolutions need to be year-long. Some opt for a habit change that lasts just a month, but the habits learned can continue longer depending on preference. \"Dry January\" is one of the most popular of these month-long challenges, where folks choose to spend their first 31 days of the new year without any alcohol. Some participate to be more mindful, while some just want to give their bodies [a break](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/02/well/eat/dry-january-health-benefits.html). Many local bars, restaurants, and retailers are shifting their offerings to include more options for sober folks this time of year, and there are plenty of other activities to partake in around Austin that don't involve drinking at all. Whether its your first year trying Dry January or your fifth, here are 11 ways to stick to your alcohol-free goals around Austin. Dry spirits shopping and activities [Dear Dry Drinkery](https://www.deardrydrinkery.com/) Come for the NA drinks, stay for the sober community-building. The city's \" [first non-alcoholic bottle shop](https://austin.culturemap.com/news/restaurants-bars/dear-dry-drinkery-dry-january/)\" – self-claimed by the newly-opened Dear Dry Drinkery in East Austin – is rallying behind its mission to create a judgement-free environment for guests to browse their rows of NA beverages throughout the year. The shop is hosting several educational classes and events to help Austinites blossom with healthier living habits, including a vision board party on Thursday, January 18; a full moon energy healing session on Thursday, January 25; and a fun craft-and-chill hour on Sunday, January 28. [Tiny Grocer](https://tinygrocer.com/) This food market in Hyde Park and South Congress specializes in providing shoppers with locally produced, organic products and housewares, which also includes nonalcoholic beverages. Owner Steph Steele shared her picks for her favorite (locally made) nonalcoholic drinks that Austinites can find on Tiny Grocer shelves, including [Surely](https://www.drinksurely.com/) wine and [Slow Luck Non-Alcholic Spirits](https://slowluckbev.com/). If you're interested in browsing an extra large selection of offerings, Tiny Grocer's Hyde Park location is the place to be, and you can stick around to grab a seat at the shop's in-house French restaurant, [Bureau de Poste](https://bureaudeposteatx.com/), which also offers many NA options on their drink menu. [Free community fitness and wellness classes by Swift Fit Events](https://www.swiftfitevents.com/community-events)Instead of brunch and Bloody Marys, Swift Fit has replaced your weekend routine at no cost. It’s not a studio promotion; Swift Fit is always free, and caters to all levels. These classes could keep someone busy nearly every day of the week (sans Wednesdays), at Republic Square Park, Boggy Creek Farm, Swift's own downtown headquarters, and more. In the spirit of Dry January, consider stopping by for yoga at Fareground on Sundays and Mondays, where you can stick around for lunch by one of several food hall-style vendors. [Museum of Ice Cream](https://www.museumoficecream.com/austin/) Okay, so meeting up for a drink is canceled. There's always time for ice cream, and if you hang around The Domain in North Austin, consider stopping by the Museum of Ice Cream to explore all of their frosty and creamy creations. It's a great way to engage with your inner child, enjoying the museum's immersive installations while indulging in unlimited ice cream. Tickets (general admission begins at $21) can be purchased online at [museumoficecream.com](https://www.museumoficecream.com/book-austin/). Mocktail menus [Eberly](https://eberlyaustin.com/) Going zero-proof in January doesn't mean you're doomed to monotonous dining. Eberly's new array of zero-proof cocktails are anything but boring. The three lively additions include the Clover Club (Seedlip Garden 108, lemon juice, raspberry and pineapple gomme syrup); the Spiced Banana Old-Fashioned (spiritless Kentucky 74, spiced banana-cacao nib gomme syrup, chocolate bitters); and the Basil Matcha Fizz (Spiritless Jalisco 55, basil matcha syrup, coconut milk, soda water). Reservations can be made via [Resy](https://resy.com/cities/atx/eberly?date=2024-01-05&seats=2). [Electric Shuffle](https://electricshuffleusa.com/austin/location-austin) Sober folks can enjoy playing high-tech shuffleboard in style this January with Electric Shuffle's new menu of mocktails. The new non-boozy offerings include a salted caramel espresso \"MartiNO,\" a hibiscus \"NOjito,\" and the Sober Lucy, a NA version of the specialty cocktail Spicy Lucy. It's also a good excuse to go out and actually do something — even if you're not an expert swing dancer. Reservations can be made online at [electricshuffleusa.com](https://electricshuffleusa.com/austin/#bookings). [Armadillo Den](https://armadillodenaustin.com/) South Austin has a horde of hidden gem hangouts, and this neighborhood venue comes out on top with some of the best mocktails in the city, according to the [Austin Chronicle](https://www.austinchronicle.com/best-of-austin-restaurants/year:2023/poll:readers/category:beverages/3086438/). Among its award-winning mocktail lineup is the Southside Sipper (fresh watermelon juice, fresh lime juice, mint); the Frescadillo Paloma (pink and white grapefruit, guava, fresh lime juice, sea salt); the Fords Ranch Water (thai basil seltzer, cucumber, fresh lemon juice); and more. Hang out, catch a live music performance, and enjoy a refreshing beverage without the booze. [Meanwhile Brewing](https://www.meanwhilebeer.com/) Some might assume a beloved Austin brewery wouldn't have enough non-boozy options for Dry January participants, but they'd be sorely mistaken. In the spirit of community, Meanwhile Brewing is partnering with the [Sims Foundation](https://simsfoundation.org/) to expand their NA options and support people in recovery. Meanwhile's new mocktail menu includes the Simsply Bulletproof Sesame (frozen black sesame, moroccan mint tea reduction, brown butter fig syrup); the Sims on PC (Drink Weird moroccan mint tea, pandan, coconut milk, infused basil seed, piloncillo, lime zest syrup); and the Arnold Simski (Drink Weird moroccan mint tea, lavender and lemon syrup). Functional drinks and snacks [Clean Juice](https://www.cleanjuice.com/) Mocktails are delicious and fun to try, but if you're looking for something more functional for nourishment, Clean Juice has the perfect month-long deal for you. During the [January Smoothie Challenge](https://www.cleanjuice.com/january-smoothie-challenge/), guests who use the Clean Juice app to purchase a smoothie once a day for 20 days throughout the month will receive a $100 credit to use in February. The challenge ends on January 31, so there's still plenty of time to participate and win the challenge. [Explore CBD](https://austin.culturemap.com/r/entryeditor/Restart%20CBD) and [THC-infused products](https://happihourdrink.com/) CBD can provide many health benefits, such as reduced anxiety, better sleep, or pain relief, among other comforts. Women-owned [Restart CBD](https://austin.culturemap.com/r/entryeditor/Restart%20CBD) provides a variety of cannabis-infused edibles, beverages, vapes, and more for those who are comfortable with trading one vice for another. If not, Restart carries plenty of CBD isolate products, which contain no THC and don't get the user high at all. For a buzz without the alcohol, we're fans of [Happi's](https://happihourdrink.com/) THC-infused seltzers. Lemon Elderflower and Turkish Apple Tea were our favorites, but you can't go wrong with a classic flavor profile like Lime Wild Mint.",

    "text": "Decker DeGraaf Maintains High Freshman Ranking Following an Apple Cup loss to WSU, the University of Washington football team slid out of the coaches poll, yet not everyone in Montlake lost his high regard this week. Decker DeGraaf went through his first of three Husky games without a touchdown catch, but the first-year tight end from San Dimas, California, appeared once more on Pro Football Focus' list of highest-graded true freshmen -- ranking sixth in its top 10. He finds himself in heady company. With a 81.3 grade based on a PFF analyst reviewing each of his plays on Saturdays, the 6-foot-3, 240-pound DeGraaf trails only Texas wide receiver Ryan Wingo (90.6), South Carolina edge rusher Dylan Stewart (85.9), Vanderbilt defensive lineman Glenn Seabrooks III (84.0), Nebraska wide receiver Jacory Barney Jr. (83.6) and North Carolina running back Davon Gause (82.6). \"It's been a huge addition,\" UW offensive coordinator Brennan Carroll said of DeGraaf. \"We kind of thought he would be able to perform like this.\" The newcomer from Southern California came highly regarded to the Huskies, but he's been thrust into a much bigger role at tight end than anticipated following senior Quentin Moore's debilitating injury, possibly a knee, in the season opener against Weber State. On his first Husky game snap, DeGraaf memorably caught a 33-yard scoring pass in the 35-3 victory over the Big Sky team. He found the end zone again the following week, with a 41-yard TD catch against Eastern Michigan, plus he added a 9-yard catch in the 30-9 victory. The Cougars kept DeGraaf out of the end zone, but he finished with a 21-yard reception in the 24-19 setback to keep his catch per game streak going.. Another touchdown can't be far off. \"We've had him for a long time now, getting all of the spring practice, too,\" Carroll said. \"it's great he's developing the way he is.\" For the latest UW football and basketball news, go to si.com/college/washington",

    "text": "Traditional supplies like cotton, linen, or synthetic fibers can exacerbate allergy symptoms by attracting mud mites, mold, and different allergens. This is the place eucalyptus silk sheets come into play as a wonderful option for these prone to allergies. These sheets mix the luxurious feel of silk with the hypoallergenic benefits of eucalyptus, making a bedding experience that’s each soothing and health-promoting.\nThe Allergy Problem with Traditional Bedding\nTraditional bedding materials often harbor allergens, which can significantly impact sleep quality. Mud mites, pet dander, mold spores, and different allergens accumulate in bedding, triggering allergic reactions such as sneezing, itchy eyes, congestion, and skin irritation. Cotton and synthetic supplies, though popular, tend to retain moisture, which encourages the growth of mud mites and mold— of the most typical allergens present in bedding. While frequent washing and altering of sheets can assist, these supplies inherently lack the resistance wanted to keep allergens at bay.\nEucalyptus Silk: A Natural Answer for Allergy Victims\nEucalyptus silk sheets, made from the natural fibers of the eucalyptus tree, are highly efficient for allergy victims as a consequence of a number of distinctive properties. Unlike standard silk derived from silkworms, eucalyptus silk is derived from cellulose, the primary constituent of plant cell walls. This eco-friendly fiber undergoes a specialised manufacturing process that retains its natural hypoallergenic qualities. Eucalyptus silk sheets supply a sustainable, soft, and allergy-friendly alternative that helps customers sleep soundly and keep healthy.\nHypoallergenic and Antibacterial Properties\nEucalyptus silk has inherent hypoallergenic and antibacterial properties that make it preferrred for individuals with allergies. Eucalyptus bushes naturally include compounds that resist bacteria, fungi, and other dangerous organisms, so these properties are retained in the final product. This means that eucalyptus silk sheets discourage the expansion of bacteria and fungi, reducing the risk of widespread allergens accumulating over time. Allergy victims usually experience fewer flare-ups when sleeping on eucalyptus silk sheets, making this a reliable selection for managing symptoms.\nMoisture-Wicking and Breathability\nAnother key advantage of eucalyptus silk sheets is their moisture-wicking and breathable nature. Because they’re made from cellulose fibers, these sheets draw moisture away from the skin fairly than retaining it, which is widespread with cotton and synthetic materials. This keeps the sheets dry and fresh, making it harder for mud mites to survive. Additionally, their breathability enhances airflow, keeping the bed cool and preventing the kind of warmth that bacteria and allergens thrive on. Eucalyptus silk sheets are therefore especially useful for people with sensitive skin, who usually find aid in bedding that helps regulate temperature and reduce moisture.\nNaturally Soft and Gentle on Skin\nEucalyptus silk sheets will not be only beneficial for allergy sufferers but additionally incredibly gentle on sensitive skin.

Eucalyptus silk, nevertheless, is soft, smooth, and less likely to irritate skin conditions. The fabric’s silky texture glides over the skin, providing an opulent really feel while minimizing friction that would exacerbate skin issues. This generally is a aid for anybody who struggles with allergy symptoms that have an effect on their skin and make it sensitive to tough textures.\nEnvironmentally Friendly\nEucalyptus silk sheets are an environmentally friendly choice as well. Eucalyptus timber develop quickly and require minimal water, making them a more sustainable option compared to different materials like cotton. The manufacturing process for eucalyptus silk can also be designed to have a minimal environmental footprint. Many eucalyptus sheet producers use a closed-loop process, where almost all solvents and water are recycled back into production. For eco-conscious allergy victims, selecting eucalyptus silk sheets is a way to prioritize both their health and the planet.\nDurability and Longevity\nFinally, eucalyptus silk sheets are exceptionally durable and long-lasting, making them a worthwhile investment. Unlike synthetic fibers, which can wear down quickly and lose their hypoallergenic properties, eucalyptus silk maintains its construction and benefits over time.

With proper care, eucalyptus silk sheets can provide years of allergen-resistant sleep, reducing the need to regularly replace bedding and helping customers save money in the long run.\nConclusion: A Breath of Fresh Air for Allergy Sufferers\nEucalyptus silk sheets offer a perfect resolution for individuals who endure from allergic reactions and are seeking a greater night time’s sleep.

    "title": "Everything We Know About the ALIEN TV Series - Nerdist",
    "text": "The\nAlien franchise, dormant since 2017’s Alien Covenant, is about to come roaring back to life. Not only is there the new feature film on the way, Alien: Romulus, directed by Fede Álvarez, but there’s also a new Alien TV series on the way as well. And, this series has Fargo‘s Noah Hawley as the creative in charge. Here’s everything we know so far about the upcoming Alien series, set for release on FX for Hulu.\nTitle\nSo far, everyone involved with the series is simply calling it Alien. We imagine that could change, and a subtitle will be added when it finally arrives. If only to not confuse it with\n the original 1979 film, or more likely, to not confuse it with any new films in the franchise like Romulus. But for now, we’re sticking to calling it just Alien.\nAlien’s Plot\nThe new series is a prequel to every iteration of the franchise so far, taking place in the year 2089. That’s about four years before Prometheus, and about thirty years before Ridley Scott’s film. Unlike previous films, it will take place on Earth. It deals with the emergence of\nthe Weyland-Yutani Corporation, often referred to in the films as “the company.” In the later part of this century, Weyland-Yutani will be pioneering android intelligence, as we saw with Ash in the original film and Bishop in James Cameron’s Aliens.\nShowrunner Noah Hawley has said the race between corporations to create new android life will largely be the focus of the series. But given that the title of the show is Alien\n, the actual xenomorphs have to turn up at some point we think. The aliens on Earth decades before Ripley and the crew of the Nostromo discover them is a bit of a huge continuity change, but we expect Noah Hawley to discover a decent workaround. There’s lots of wiggle room there.\nBehind the Scenes\nThe new Alien series has quite a pedigree of talent behind it. Fargo and Legion creator Noah Hawley came up with this series and will also direct at least some of the episodes. Original Alien director Ridley Scott is an executive producer on the series. Alien is filming in both Thailand and the United Kingdom.\nAlien’s Cast\nAlien the series stars Sydney Chandler as a series lead, Alex Lawther as a soldier named CJ, and Samuel Blenkin as the mysterious CEO Boy Kavalier. Essie Davis is Dame Silvia, Adarsh Gourav as Slightly, and Kit Young as Tootles. Additionally, Timothy Olyphant has\nreportedly joined the cast as “Kirsh, a synth who acts as a mentor and trainer for Chandler’s Wendy, who is a hybrid, a meta-human who has the brain and consciousness of a child but the body of an adult.” Fargo‘s David Rysdahl has also come aboard in an undisclosed role.\nBabou Ceesay, Jonathan Ajayi, Erana James, Lily Newmark, Diêm Camille, and Adrian Edmondson round out the series casting.\nGiven the timeline of the series, it’s all but confirmed that none of the original film’s actors will reprise their roles for the series. Sadly, that means no Sigourney Weaver this time.\nAlien’s Release Date\nSo far, all we know is that filming is set to continue until mid-2024. So the Alien series likely won’t drop of FX until early 2025.",
