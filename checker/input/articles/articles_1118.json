    "title": "Experts warn Canada's wildfire season likely to be massive again - Breitbart",
    "text": "Two years after a historically devastating summer, Canada is once again facing a massive fire season, with burned areas already exceeding year-to-date averages from recent years.\nMore than 220 active fires were burning across the country Tuesday, with half of them considered out of control.\nMore than 3.3 million hectares (12,700 square miles) have already been consumed by flames — an area equivalent to the country of Belgium.\nA violent, early season Two provinces in central Canada — Saskatchewan and Manitoba — were hard-hit with rough starts to fire season, and had to declare a state of emergency at the end of May.\nNow, more than a dozen new fires are detected daily across Canada — often started accidentally by humans, but sometimes ignited by lightning strikes.\nMega wildfires are now burning in western Alberta and British Columbia, as well as in northern Ontario, the country’s most populous province.\nWhile these fires are consuming land at an alarming pace, they have not yet matched the numbers from 2023, an extraordinary year.\n“It’s quite spectacular what we’re seeing right now,” said Marc-Andre Parisien, a researcher at the Canadian Forest Service.\nAs such, the country is on maximum fire alert and resources are ready for mobilization, including army-led evacuations from remote areas.\nInternational aid from Australia and the Unites States are also standing by.\nFire weather conditions “There are some similarities to the 2023 fire season, particularly because we’re again coping with a very large area experiencing water deficits and drought,” Parisien said.\n“Without the insulating effect of snow, the ground warmed up, vegetation dried more quickly, and conditions conducive to forest fires were established several weeks in advance,” said Hossein Bonakdari, a University of Ottowa professor.\nWhat’s more, temperatures in May were above average across most of Canada.\nIn recent years, Canada has experienced warming at least twice as fast as the rest of the globe.\nLinked to human-induced climate change, rising temperatures lead to reduced snow, shorter and milder winters, and earlier summer conditions that promote fires, experts say.\n– Summer outlook –\nUnder current conditions, the fires are expected to last weeks or months, researchers say, warning that affected areas are so large that fires can smolder underground and reappear as temperatures rise.\n“What is quite worrisome for the country is that we’re experiencing a third consecutive year of intense fires with social consequences for thousands of evacuees but also significant ecological impacts,” said Yan Boulanger, researcher for Canada’s Ministry of Natural Resources.\nWhile forest fires have a natural place in Canada’s ecosystem, repeated blazes mean there is little time to regenerate in between fire seasons.\nIn some areas, the forest is beginning to disappear, making way for prairie landscapes, the researcher said.\nAnother source of concern for experts: the size of the fires, which are already enormous this month, long before the peak of the season.\nFor example, in Saskatchewan, the Shoe Fire already exceeds 500,000 hectares (1.2 million acres).\nFrom that perspective, Boulanger said, “it’s even more serious than 2023.”",

    "text": "How rock-bottom prices drive shortages of generic drugs used in hospitals Steven Coventry spent 20 years at the Akorn pharmaceutical factory in Decatur, Ill., and worked his way up to operations manager. The plant closed abruptly in February 2023, when the company shut down its four manufacturing facilities. In Decatur, Akorn laid off 400 employees. But Coventry went back to work at the Decatur plant last summer because new owners hired him to essentially resume his old job and bring it back to life. It was a surreal scene. \"Coffee mugs were left on tabletops, personal items,\" he said. \"It was kind of like a ghost town and a little sad to go through and see, you know, people's lives just basically upended.\" Coventry says the factory used to make 100 different products. The shutdown contributed to new drug shortages and made some others worse. He's glad to be back. \"It's like home. It's where I grew up,\" he said. \"I was really driven to ... bring it back up to its glory days of what it was in the past.\" Low prices bring unintended consequences When Americans think of drug prices, they usually think that they're too high. And for name brand drugs, that's often the case compared with the rest of the world. But when it comes to [ generic sterile injectables](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/federal-policies-to-address-persistent-generic-drug-shortages/), medicines that are workhorses in hospitals, the opposite problem is true. They can be too cheap. \"For off-patent generic drugs, especially those used in the hospital setting, Americans actually pay lower prices than Europe does,\" said [Rena Conti](https://www.bu.edu/questrom/profile/rena-conti/), a professor at the Boston University Questrom School of Business. Companies compete with each other to offer hospital purchasers the lowest price, driving the prices to rock bottom. Over time, prices can get so low that it doesn't always make good business sense for the companies to keep making some drugs. So they stop. \"It's the same issues that we've been dealing with for many years, especially with these older generic drugs that are having fewer and fewer manufacturers making them,\" [Valerie Jensen](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/fda-insight/fda-insight-drug-shortages-and-covid-19), associate director for drug shortages at the Food and Drug Administration, told NPR. \"There isn't a lot of buffer when something goes wrong on the manufacturing line.\" With fewer suppliers of generic drugs, a weather event – like the tornado that ripped through a Pfizer facility earlier this year or Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico in 2017 – can wreak havoc on an already fragile system. On top of that, the bargain-basement prices don't encourage manufacturers to invest in new equipment and other things that would keep quality high and avert recalls and shutdowns. \"I would say, fundamentally, economics is causing this problem, and this problem is long-standing,\" Conti said. \"We've been dealing with periodic and, more concerningly, persistent shortages in drugs ... for the better part of a decade or a little bit more. And fundamentally, the economics of this market has to change in order to get resilient supply.\" What happened to Akorn? Erin Fox is a hospital pharmacist who oversees purchasing drugs, medication safety and more for the University of Utah Health System. Like her peers across the country, she was caught off guard by Akorn's demise last winter. \"We actually got an email from our representative and he just said, 'Hey, we just walked in today. We learned that we're closing. Everyone has to leave today,' \" she said. \"So it was very abrupt.\" The company went bankrupt after operating at a loss \"for some time\" and failing to get acquired by a company that would cover its liabilities, Akorn's CEO said in a [letter to employees last February](https://herald-review.com/read-it-akorn-layoff-letter-to-employees/pdf_833fc5c8-b2e4-11ed-b91b-175da6b5f0d1.html) that was obtained by the Herald and Review in Decatur. As soon as Fox got the news, she and her colleagues at University of Utah Health started poring over lists of medicines to see how the shutdown would affect them. Fox's team asked their Akorn rep if they could use what they had on shelves, and the answer that day was \"yes.\" The relief wouldn't last. Six weeks later, Akorn recalled all the products it had made. There was nothing wrong with the drugs, and they hadn't expired. But no one was left at Akorn to answer the phone or initiate a specific recall if a problem did emerge. \"So you can't use it anymore,\" she said of Akorn's product line. \"There's no gray area there.\" Staffers at University of Utah Health had to log an extra 250 hours right away to deal with the fallout, taking Akorn products off shelves and finding replacements. Products included things like the opioid sufentanil, which is often used in epidurals during labor and delivery. There are alternatives, but anesthesiologists prefer working with what they know best to reduce the chances for medical errors. Akorn was also the only supplier of dimercaprol, an injectable antidote for lead poisoning. There are oral alternatives, but some patients are too sick to take them. Rising from Akorn's ashes A few months after Akorn shut down, Rising Pharmaceuticals acquired the former Akorn factory in Illinois. Rising plans to manufacture several of the generic products Akorn used to make there. \"Our intention is to really focus on those products of greatest need in the U.S. pharma marketplace and bring those back on,\" Ira Baeringer, Rising's chief operating officer, told NPR. These include injectable forms of the antibiotic levofloxacin, the anesthetic tetracaine and droperidol, a medication to prevent nausea. Rising also plans to bring back several former Akorn eyedrop products in short supply. But getting the factory up and running again is tricky because the water, air and mechanical systems had been shut down for so long. Normally, those systems run continuously. \"That takes a lot of time. It takes a lot of effort,\" Baeringer said. \"And once a facility is shut down, it means all those systems have to be revalidated. And so that's the process that we're going through right now to bring ... this facility back up into commercial production.\" He said Rising hopes the factory will be making products by the second half of 2024. But what will keep Rising from going the same way Akorn did? \"Honestly, there's probably very little that can happen to prevent it,\" said Fox of University of Utah Health, explaining that it will depend on many factors, including which products Rising chooses and how it prices them. \"So I think it's really hard to know if they'll be able to make it a success or not.\" She said she hopes Rising can get a leg up from \"people that want to keep manufacturing in the U.S.\" The Biden administration has taken steps toward mitigating drug shortages, including expanding its use of the Defense Production Act to bolster domestic manufacturing of medicines deemed critical for national defense. The administration is also investing $35 million in domestic manufacturing of key starting materials for sterile injectable drugs. \"I'm hopeful,\" Fox said of the Illinois factory. \"But we'll just have to see how it works out.\" Copyright 2023 NPR.

    "text": "Punjab Inspector General of Police (IGP) Dr Usman Anwar on Saturday said that at least 15 suspects were arrested after two Christian families were rescued from an enraged mob that attacked their homes in Sargodha’s Mujahid Colony on Saturday morning. Sargodha District Police Officer (DPO) Asad Ejaz Malhi earlier told the media that the incident stemmed from alleged desecration, but emphasised that a large police contingent was deployed and no fatalities were reported. “When police arrived, the mob had gathered outside the houses. Officers cordoned off the area and safely evacuated all residents,” Malhi said, adding that additional police units were stationed throughout the city to ensure the safety of the Christian community. “The police peacefully dispersed the crowd,” he added. Social media footage depicted a mob surrounding a bloodied man and others, including teenagers, wrecking furniture. Another video showed a large blaze outside a house. DPO Malhi claimed they were “fake videos”, insisting no one was injured. “The police are maintaining law and order,” he said. However, a relative of an injured person contradicted this, telling the media that his uncle was in critical condition at a hospital and the family was not being allowed to meet him. A statement from Minority Rights March also said that videos of the incident showed the mob lynching of a 70year-old man “on the instigation of a local cleric” while the man’s home and factory were set ablaze. “The videos of the attack clearly show officers of the Punjab police being present on the site as silent spectators which points towards their tacit approval and facilitation of the terrorists involved in the attack,” the statement said. A statement from the Punjab police said Sargodha Regional Police Officer Shariq Kamal, DPO Malhi and other police officials responded promptly as soon as the incident was reported and reached the spot immediately, managing to save 10 lives and controlling the situation. “There was no loss of life, more than 10 police officers and personnel were also injured due to stone pelting by the angry people. The Sargodha police risked their lives to rescue the families and pulled them out from the crowd. Thanks to the timely action of the police. Sargodha was spared a great tragedy,” the statement said, adding that the situation in the city was “completely peaceful and under control”. It praised members of the district peace committee and the Christian community for playing an “effective role in restoring the atmosphere of understanding and peace”.",

    "title": "Possible relief from grey days on Thursday with some sunlight in the forecast",
    "text": "Toronto and the GTA has been blanketed by mostly grey and miserable weather over the last few weeks and there is some relief in sight. Steven Flisfeder, a Warning Preparedness Meteorologist with Environment Canada, says after over several days of grey skies, there is a chance of some sunlight on Thursday. “We’re expecting a cold front to push across southern Ontario some time tomorrow, which is going to give a chance for some sun. Not that much is expected. There is still going to be some lingering cloud, but there should be some parts of the day where we do see some sunshine.” But he adds it’s not unusual to see this many grey days during this time of year. “In late December, January, we tend to have a fairly active bit of weather. So a lot of low pressure systems coming through the southern Ontario region, which gives a lot of precipitation, typically, but also has the effect of bringing a lot of cloud with it,” said Filsfeder. It’s important to make sure you do expose yourself to some sunlight as it helps alleviate some of the symptoms of what a psychiatrist at CAMH calls the “seasonal blues,” something one-third of Canadians experience from in the winter months. Dr. Michael Mak, a sleep medicine specialist and psychiatrist at the Center for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) said some people are even more affected by the lack of sun. “Particularly when it’s very gloomy and overcast, we know that actually makes people’s mood worse. Light exposure is actually an antidote for that. So if a person doesn’t have enough light exposure, it’s overcast all the time and it’s dark out.” Around three to five per cent of Canadians suffer from seasonal affective disorder (SAD), a type of depression that occurs when there’s less natural light. “The symptoms include, decreased sleep, poor concentration, low levels of energy, feelings of guilt worthlessness, and in the worst cases, feelings that life isn’t worth continuing,” said Dr. Mak. The best way to alleviate it is to expose yourself to bright light. When there’s no sunlight, there are specialized lights you can buy that will help with a minimum brightness of 10,000 lux. “That’s a measurement of brightness. And if you expose yourself to that kind of light for half an hour a day, when you wake up in the morning, you’re mood should approve.” Dr. Mak adds to make sure you stay in contact with friends and family and communicate with each other this time of year. “If you notice friends, families, and colleagues, withdrawing from social contact, not really engaging in the things that they usually like doing, or they seem sad, it’s a great time to ask them how they’re doing and reach out and offer help if necessary.”",

    "text": "Le Mars Fire Department battles wintry weather, long delays on new equipment LE MARS, Iowa (KTIV) -Viewers likely remember the dense fog we had around Christmas, which was a real problem for the Le Mars Fire-Rescue Department. With visibility reduced Fire Chief David Schipper said cars were flying past the scenes of accidents, not noticing the fire trucks and ambulances. That put crews in danger, as they worked on accidents caused by the fog and icy conditions. While we’ve all heard of “fire and ice,” the chief says it’s often more difficult to respond to calls in the winter. ”So a lot of times, you know, at a call, once they strip out of that gear to go to rehab or rehabilitate. They can’t get it back on because it’s still frozen solid,” said Schipper. Schipper said we won’t have to worry about frozen fire hydrants, as the water isn’t actually stored in the hydrant where it can freeze, instead, it is stored underground. But he said call volumes generally increase in the winter. “We ramp up the carbon monoxide calls, we ramp up the heating calls because of fireplace issues or space heaters or furnaces that didn’t get checked or cleaned. So the call total seems to go up a little bit this time of year,” he said. Schipper asks the public to slow down on the roads with wintry weather and give an especially wide berth to emergency vehicles this time of year. New firetruck and ambulance The Le Mars Fire Department is also getting a new fire truck and ambulance. Schipper said the Le Mars City Council has approved nearly $2 million for the vehicles, which have to be ordered now with a roughly 40-month lag between placing the order and delivery. The new ladder truck is being paid with sales tax dollars and the ambulance will be funded with money from the American Rescue Plan Act. While Schipper acknowledged the “sticker shock,” he encouraged the city council to break the cost down over 10-20 years, which is how long he expects the vehicles to last. ”So if they sit there and pump water all day long at a fire, you know, it might have not have a lot of miles on it. But they’ve got a lot of hours on the motors and the pumps and things like that,” he said. Schipper said the new ambulance should arrive in 2025 or 2026. The ladder truck may not be delivered until 2027. Copyright 2023 KTIV. All rights reserved.",
