    "title": "Cher files for conservatorship of son Elijah Blue Allman",
    "text": "Cher has filed for temporary legal conservatorship of her adult son Elijah Blue Allman, citing his alleged ongoing substance abuse issues. According to a petition filed this week in Los Angeles Superior Court and obtained by CNN, Cher is seeking to be the sole conservator of her son’s estate, alleging that he “is currently unable to manage his assets due to severe mental health and substance abuse issues.” “Elijah is entitled to regular distributions from the Trust, but given his ongoing mental health and substance abuse issues,” according to the documents. “Petitioner (Cher) is concerned that any funds distributed to Elijah will be immediately spent on drugs, leaving Elijah with no assets to provide for himself and putting Elijah’s life at risk.” The 47-year-old is the son of Cher and her former husband, the late rocker Gregg Allman. Gregg Allman and Cher were married from 1975 to 1979. He [died in 2017](https://www.cnn.com/2017/05/27/entertainment/gregg-allman-obituary/index.html) at the age of 69 due to liver cancer complications. The petition filed by Cher states that her son is set to receive funds from a trust by the end of the year. It also states that the 77-year-old singer and actress has “worked tirelessly to get Elijah into treatment and get him the help he needs.” “Petitioner (Cher) loves Elijah immensely and has always acted with his best interests in mind,” the filing states. “I’m not suffering from any problem that millions of people in the United States aren’t,” [Cher told People magazine](https://people.com/cher-speaks-out-on-kidnapping-plot-allegations-about-son-not-true-exclusive-8350230) in October, referring to her son’s substance abuse. “I’m a mother. This is my job — one way or another, to try to help my children,” she said. “You do anything for your children. Whenever you can help them, you just do it because that’s what being a mother is. But it’s joy, even with heartache — mostly, when you think of your children, you just smile and you love them, and you try to be there for them.” Cher is also the mother of Chaz Bono. A hearing has been scheduled in March, according to court documents. CNN is working to determine if Allman has legal representation. CNN has reached out to representatives for Cher for further comment.",

    "text": "UK students increase use of AI for academic work\nThe rise of AI has sparked calls for the integration of academic integrity policies.\nBritish universities have been urged to reassess their assessment methods after new research revealed a significant rise in students using genAI for their projects. A survey of 1,000 undergraduates found that 88% of students used AI tools like ChatGPT for assessments in 2025, up from 53% last year. Overall, 92% of students now use some form of AI, marking a substantial shift in academic behaviours in just a year.\nThe report, by the Higher Education Policy Institute and Kortext, highlights how AI is being used for tasks such as summarising articles, explaining concepts, and suggesting research ideas. While AI can enhance the quality of work and save time, some students admitted to directly including AI-generated content in their assignments, raising concerns about academic misconduct.\nThe research also found that concerns over AI’s potential impact on academic integrity vary across demographics. Women, wealthier students, and those studying STEM subjects were more likely to embrace AI, while others expressed fears about getting caught or receiving biased results. Despite these concerns, students generally feel that universities are addressing the issue of academic integrity, with many believing their institutions have clear policies on AI use.\nExperts argue that universities need to adapt quickly to the changing landscape, with some suggesting that AI should be integrated into teaching rather than being seen solely as a threat to academic integrity. As AI tools become an essential part of education, institutions must find a balance between leveraging the technology and maintaining academic standards.\nFor more information on these topics, visit diplomacy.edu.",

    "text": "On Monday at the stroke of midnight, the minimum wage for tipped and non-tipped workers in Ohio will increase.\nThe minimum wage in Ohio will go up by 35- cents per hour for non-tipped workers starting Monday to $10.45 an hour. Tipped workers will get a 20-cent boost to $5 and 25 cents an hour in 2024.\nThe state's minimum wage has increased every year since 2006 when Ohioans passed a constitutional amendment to raise it over time.\nBut some say the increase isn't nearly enough\nAdvocates for the poor say, even with the increase, it’s still not a living wage. They point out that the average two-bedroom apartment in Ohio runs from $600 to $1,300 a month, depending on the location. That means it would take working at least two 40-hour weeks at the new minimum wage to earn enough to afford an apartment in the least expensive area of Ohio and more than three weeks to earn enough to get such an apartment in a more expensive Ohio city. And in many cases, there is a shortage of affordable housing.\nEfforts underway to increase it\nA coalition of groups has been working to put a $15 an hour minimum wage proposals before voters in 2024.\nSome politicians, like U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH) have advocated for a $15 an hour minimum wage in the past. So it is likely to be an issue that's brought up in the U.S. Senate campaign this fall, as Brown is up for re-election.",
