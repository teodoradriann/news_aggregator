    "text": "O ministro do Trabalho e Emprego em exercício, Francisco Macena, afirmou há pouco que a expectativa da pasta é que haja em 2024 um “ciclo virtuoso” de geração de empregos formais, com o retorno do PAC e aceleração da economia, e aumento da renda da população celetista, com o reajuste do salário mínimo.\n\"Expectativa é que possamos ter grande crescimento econômico em 2024 com baixa dos juros e aumento do investimento público. Acreditamos que investimentos do PAC vão impulsionar muito a geração de vagas formais\", afirmou Macena ao comentar o resultado de novembro do Caged, divulgado hoje.\n\"Expectativa é que ano que vem possamos ter um ciclo virtuoso de geração de empregos formais e de renda. O aumento real do salário mínimo [também] vai movimentar a economia em 2024\", completou.\nEle classificou como positiva a abertura líquida de 1,9 milhão de vagas formais no acumulado de janeiro a novembro deste ano e disse que o resultado de 2024 deve ser superior ao registrado neste ano.\nO ministro também comentou que não acredita em demissão em massa com a reoneração parcial da folha de pagamento para os 17 setores da economia que mais empregam no país. \"Acho que pode ter inclusive ampliação de empresas que podem aderir ao modelo. Não tive acesso à MP e aos anexos, mas entendi que mais empresas poderão aderir (além dos 17 setores)\", afirmou.\nConteúdo publicado originalmente no Valor PRO, serviço de informação em tempo real do Valor Econômico.\nMais lidas do valor-investe 1 Investimento no Exterior Dólar cai 8,06% no ano, maior queda desde 2016.

    "text": "30 gennaio 2025 a a a Carmen Russo contro Luciana Littizzetto. La frecciata arriva a La Volta Buona , quando Caterina Balivo tocca un tema delicato: la maternità dopo i 50 anni. Esattamente quanto accaduto alla ballerina, che ha avuto la figlia Maria quando ormai sembrava un sogno destinato a sbiadire. Un percorso comunque difficile, quello di Carmen Russo, segnato da una patologia che ostacolava il desiderio della maternità. Da qui la replica alle parole della Littizzetto che, ai tempi, sfruttò il suo spazio a Che Tempo Che Fa per scherzare sulla scelta della ballerina di dare alla luce un figlio in età avanzata.\n\"Devo dire - esordisce la ballerina - che lei è stata molto pungente, anche abbastanza fuori luogo rispetto a quello che ha detto\". Inutili i tentativi della Balivo di alleggerire il clima: \"Dobbiamo comunque ricordare che lei è una comica, dobbiamo anche dare il contesto giusto\". Ma Carmen non ci sta: \"Ha esagerato un pochino, poteva risparmiarsi tante cose; c’è stata una mancanza di delicatezza…\".",

    "title": "AVENGERS: DOOMSDAY - Chris Evans Denies Recent Report That He's Set To Return; 'I'm Happily Retired'",
    "text": "Late last year, The Wrap reported that Chris Evans will make his return to the MCU for Marvel Studios' next big event movie, Avengers: Doomsday. Fans expected Evans to show up as Steve Rogers in Avengers: Secret Wars, anyway, but it was nice to finally have confirmation that the OG Sentinel of Liberty would be suiting-up for action once again.\nThis wasn't the first time we've heard that plans were in place for Evans to return to the role, but the actor has always denied the reports - and continues to do so!\nIn Esquire's profile of our new Captain America, Anthony Mackie, the Brave New World star revealed that he reached out to Evans after the news broke, but was met with a denial.\n“I didn’t know! I talked to Chris a few weeks ago and it wasn’t on the table then. At least, he didn’t tell me it was on the table, because I asked him. I was like, ‘You know, they said they’re bringing everyone back for the movie. Are you coming back?’ ”\nEvans told his Avengers co-star that he was \"happily retired,\" and Esquire got the same response.\n“That’s not true, though,” he said of the reports of his MCU return. “This always happens. I mean, it happens every couple years—ever since Endgame. I’ve just stopped responding to it.Yeah, no — happily retired!”\nThe last time we saw Rogers, he had handed his iconic shield over to his friend Sam Wilson (Mackie) after first deciding to remain in the past and live out his life with Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell) in Avengers: Endgame. We had assumed that, if Evans did make his MCU return, that he would be playing a Multiversal variant, but that's not the only possibility.\nEvans appeared as Johnny Storm, aka the Human Torch, in Deadpool and Wolverine, and there have been rumors that he may not be quite done with his old Fantastic Four role.\nSo, will it be Rogers, or Storm... or someone else entirely?\nThe Hot Mic podcast's Jeff Sneider recently said he heard that Evans will actually be playing Nomad. Though several characters have held this mantle in the comics, the name was originally introduced as an alternate identity that Steve Rogers adopted after he abandoned the Captain America costume and title.\nIf this is accurate, it remains to be seen which version of Rogers suits-up as Nomad in the movie. It's highly unlikely to be the original (unless he's really upped his Callisthenics regime), so a variant from another timeline/reality makes the most sense.\nThere's been some speculation that Doomsday might introduce a new team of \"Evil Avengers,\" which could potentially see Nomad join forces with Robert Downey Jr.'s Doctor Doom and some other variants.\nOf course, none of this really matters, because Evans says he won't be back, and that's all there is to it (insert whichever emoji you deem appropriate).\nAvengers: Doomsday arrives in theaters on May 1, 2026, followed by Avengers: Secret Wars on May 7, 2027. Both films will be directed by the Russo brothers, who also make their MCU return after helming Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Captain America: Civil War, Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame.\n\"Being able to create stories and explore characters within the Marvel Universe fulfilled a life-long dream of ours, and we discovered a powerful connection with audiences in each film that we made. We’re thrilled to collaborate once again with Kevin, Lou and the entire Marvel team to bring this epic adventure in storytelling to new and surprising places for both the fans and ourselves”, said The Russos in a statement after the SDCC panel.\nHave another look at some photos Downey Jr. shared to Instagram after the big reveal below.\nThis post was submitted by a user who has agreed to our Terms of Service and Community Guidelines.

    "text": "- B-roll of energy-saving tips to combat the cold available [here](https://news.duke-energy.com/multimedia-gallery/videos/energy-efficiency-tips) - Financial assistance and energy-saving tools and tips are available to help customers CHARLOTTE – As temperatures dip across the Carolinas this week, Duke Energy is reminding customers of resources, tips and tools to help them manage energy usage and utility bills. Money-saving tips to combat the cold - Reduce your thermostat to the lowest comfortable setting. The smaller the difference between the inside and outside temperatures, the lower your energy usage and bills. - One of the easiest things customers can do for heating efficiency is to change air filters regularly. A dirty air filter makes a heating system work harder, which uses more energy and can increase costs. Also, have heating systems checked regularly by a qualified heating and air conditioning contractor to maintain efficiency and peak performance. - Leave drapes or blinds open during sunny winter days to allow the sun's rays to warm the house, but close them at night to help insulate your home. - One of best energy-saving habits you can do each year is to check windows, doors and vents for air leaks. Caulking, sealing and weatherstripping leaks can save 10% to 20% in heating costs. - Replace standard bulbs with light-emitting diodes (LED). LEDs are more efficient than regular bulbs, while giving off the same amount of light. Replacing just six of your most frequently used bulbs with LEDs can save up to $480 over the lifetime of the bulbs. - Operate ceiling fans in a clockwise direction in the winter, which pushes warm air back down into the room. (Most fans have a switch that allows you to reverse the motor.) While fans move air and make people more comfortable, they do not provide heat, so remember to turn the fan off when you leave the room. - Manage water heating. Set your water heater to 120 degrees or less. Water heating is typically the second biggest user of energy in your home. Ways to manage winter heating bills Duke Energy offers free programs and tools to help customers better manage and understand their monthly energy expenses: [Budget Billing](https://www.duke-energy.com/home/billing/budget-billing)gives customers better control over their energy spending by establishing predictable monthly payments.

For customers who qualify, Duke Energy’s partnerships with community and state agencies can help them access a range of state, federal assistance and Duke Energy programs, including: [Low Income Energy Assistance Program (LIEAP):](https://www.duke-energy.com/Home/Billing/Special%20Assistance/Low%20Income%20EAP%20NC)Provides a one-time vendor payment to help eligible North Carolina households pay their energy bills during winter months.

    "text": "El talento pontevedrés despunta en los premios de AJE Galicia con tres de los cinco galardones La gala de los jóvenes empresarios gallegos, celebrada por primera vez en Poio, reconoce a Galiwonders, Vanetta Vegan Food, Wilfire Sentinel, Sembra Biojoyas y Merlin Software Muchos nervios, ilusión e incluso algún que otro “selfie” en pleno atril cuando llegó el momento de hablar. El talento pontevedrés triunfó en la gala de entrega de los premios de la Asociación de Jóvenes Empresarios de Galicia, AJE Galicia, que por primera vez se celebró en Poio, en el Pazo de Colón. En la XIII edición de estos galardones, de los cinco que se concedieron tres corresponden a proyectos y empresas presentados por parte de la Asociación de Jóvenes Empresarios de Pontevedra: Galiwonders, Wildfire Sentinel y Sembra Biojoyas. La ciudad ha dejado el pabellón bien alto y demostrado que las ideas y las ganas de iniciar nuevos proyectos están más vivas que nunca. El Premio Joven Empresario de Galicia recayó en Galiwonders, una agencia de viajes on line de la Boa Vila que se ha especializado en el turismo internacional que recorre el Camiño de Santiago, así como en la fusión del patrimonio cultural, gastronómico y natural de Galicia. Es la segunda vez que esta empresa es reconocida por AJE, ya que si bien ahora lo ha sido por AJE Galicia, el pasado mes de noviembre del año pasado lo fue en los premios de AJE Pontevedra con el principal de los premios. Tal y como informó una de las impulsoras de este proyecto, que comenzó su andadura en el año 2016, la empresa cuenta actualmente con 17 trabajadores y dos oficinas, en Pontevedra y Padrón. El otro gran galardón de los AJE Galicia es el Premio Iniciativa Emprendedora de Galicia, que en esta ocasión ha recaído en Vanetta Vegan Food, una empresa que se presentó con AJE Vigo y que tiene su sede en Nigrán. Pero, además, en la gala se entregaron tres accésits. Y también en esta ocasión despuntó el talento pontevedrés, que logró dos. El Accésit a la Innovación Recados Carmen fue para la empresa Wildfire Sentinel, con sede en la capital de la provincia. Se trata de una tecnología que busca la pronta detección de incendios proporcionando un sistema de alerta y monitorización del entorno forestal. Su impulsor animó, en el momento de recoger el premio, que “hay que creer mucho en una idea por loca que sea, pero hay que perseguirla”. Y especialmente emocionada se mostró la joven creadora de Sembra Biojoyas, empresa pontevedresa de joyas hechas a mano con recursos extraídos de la naturaleza amazónica por etnias indígenas, en la que recayó el Accésit a la Responsabilidad Social Empresarial Vegalsa-Eroski. Explicó que se trata de un proyecto sostenible con el que se crea también un producto sostenible y que se puede descartar enterrándolo en la propia naturaleza, a diferencia de la bisutería más comercial, “la mayoría de ella hecha con materiales contaminantes”. “Empecé con este proyecto en el salón de mi casa y hoy me siento una persona muy afortunada”, confesó. El tercer accésit, el de Creación de Empleo, fue para Merlin Software, de AJE A Coruña, una consultoría informática que ofrece servicios a medida de los clientes. Rueda: “Vuestra labor contribuye al crecimiento económico” El presidente de la Xunta de Galicia, Alfonso Rueda, así como los conselleiros de Vivenda, María Martínez Allegue, y Emprego, José González Vázquez, asistieron a la gala de entrega de los premios de AJE Galicia. También el presidente y el vicepresidente de la Diputación de Pontevedra, Luis López y Rafa Domínguez, respectivamente. Asimismo, ejerció de anfitrión el alcalde de Poio, Ángel Moldes, por ser el municipio escogido para la gala este año. Entre los numerosos asistentes de AJE, estaban el presidente de AJE Galicia, Luciano Covelo Fandiño, y la de AJE Pontevedra, María Asunción Buceta Vicenta. Alfonso Rueda destacó el trabajo de los emprendedores y jóvenes empresarios, sin el cual no se entendería el “crecimiento económico de Galicia”. En este sentido, y teniendo en cuenta “el contexto de incertidumbre financiera”, elogió el ánimo a emprender y a crear una empresa propia. También quiso mostrar el compromiso de su Ejecutivo para apoyar toda iniciativa privada que cree empleo y busque el bien común de los ciudadanos. Así, recordó que la Xunta es la administración autonómica “que realizó un mayor esfuerzo de inversión en políticas activas de empleo en los dos primeros meses de 2024, con más de 205 millones de euros movilizados”. Políticas provinciales Por su parte, Luis López afirmó que “todas las economías que dan las espaldas al emprendimiento fracasan” y puso como ejemplo el programa provincial de apoyo al emprendimiento, Smart Peme, con más de 2.000 atenciones a cerca de medio millar de empresas en esta nueva etapa de gobierno. Asimismo, Luciano Covelo mencionó el problema actual de mano de obra y de las elevadas tasas de paro juvenil y María Buceta recordó que “hay que sumar, ir juntos de la mano, para remar en el mismo barco y en la misma dirección”.
