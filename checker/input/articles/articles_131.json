Terms of the deal with landlord Beacon Capital Partners, based in Boston, were not disclosed. More than half of the 389,000-square-foot tower is available for lease, according to Beacon’s website. Tenants include Beacon and Providence, according to public filings reviewed by the Business Journal. Pinterest[ entered the Seattle market in 2016](https://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/blog/techflash/2016/08/pinterest-choses-seattle-for-itsfirst-engineering.html) with the opening of[ a sales and engineering office](https://www.wework.com/ideas/workspace-solutions/case-studies/pinterest-case-study) in the WeWork office. Within a year, the company reported it had 55 Seattle-based employees. The publicly traded company’s new digs at Met Park East include a gourmet catering kitchen, fitness center and outdoor green space, according to CBRE. Neither Pinterest, nor CBRE, which handles leases for Met Park East, returned a request for comment from the newspaper. The office vacancy in Seattle rose 2.1 percent year over year to 28.2 percent in the third, according to Savills.

    "text": "El presidente de El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, anunció este jueves que más de 300 empleados el Ministerio de Cultura serán despedidos para “ahorrar” fondos públicos y como parte de una “medicina amarga” para mejorar la economía del país centroamericano. En un mensaje en X, el mandatario aseguró que “en estos momentos el nuevo ministro de Cultura, Raúl Castillo, procederá a la destitución de más de 300 empleados”, quienes, según Bukele, “promueven agendas que no son compatibles con la visión de este Gobierno”. Dijo que con lo anterior “ahorraremos fondos públicos en el proceso” y apuntó que “la gente eligió un camino y ese camino vamos a tomar”.

Bukele prometió el pasado 1 de junio, durante su investidura para un segundo mandato consecutivo, “sanar” la economía tras curar al país del “cáncer” de la violencia, generada principalmente por los grupos de pandillas. Publicidad “Ahora, que ya arreglamos lo más urgente, que era la seguridad, vamos a enfocarnos de lleno en los problemas importantes, empezando por la economía”, dijo Bukele en ese momento. Percepción ciudadana De acuerdo con una reciente encuesta del Instituto Universitario de Opinión Pública de la jesuita Universidad Centroamericana (Iudop), un 73,7 % de la población opina que el principal problema del país está relacionado con factores económicos, mientras que el 25,8 % manifestó que el principal fracaso del Gobierno de Bukele se dio en materia económica. Revela que el 60,5 % de los salvadoreños considera que la economía ha empeorado o sigue igual al cierre del quinto año de la primera gestión de Bukele, el 69,2 % dice que su economía familiar ha empeorado o se mantiene igual. Bajo la Administración de Bukele El Salvador se ha mantenido a la cola del crecimiento económico en Centroamérica y es altamente dependiente de las remesas familiares, que anualmente inyectan más de 8.000 millones de dólares. En declaraciones a EFE, el economista José Luis Magaña, destacó que la pobreza extrema monetaria “se ha duplicado”, pasando de 86.000 hogares en el 2019 a 170.000 en 2023. De acuerdo con datos oficiales, el porcentaje de pobreza general pasó de un 22,8 % a un 27,2 % de los hogares.",

    "text": "TRNP wild horse advocates share petition to stop the roundup BISMARCK, N.D. (KFYR) - Theodore Roosevelt National Park officials announced on Friday staff will be [rounding up the park’s bison and horses to transfer them to tribes or new homes](https://www.kfyrtv.com/2024/09/27/theodore-roosevelt-national-park-roundup-bison-horses-transfer/). But wild horse advocates say they’re still concerned about the legacy of the horses, despite making progress with the park. Park officials say the transfer is “to support healthy herds as well as park ecosystems.” They say mares that have not responded to contraception and their offspring will be put up for adoption. However, advocates say removing fertile horses from the park will make it challenging or impossible to carry on the herd. Chris Kman is one of those advocates working with the park to control and minimize sterilization, among other things. “Our organization has a petition. We’ve gotten over 2,500 signatures since Sunday. We’re trying to get Senator Hoeven’s attention because he’s been such a strong advocate for these horses. We hope that we can continue to count on him. There’s no reason this roundup can’t wait until next fall,” said Kman. She said the park’s actions have eroded her trust in the organization. She said it’ll also be difficult to find people to adopt some of the older horses. You can learn more [here](https://secure.everyaction.com/4dmUjJg8pk2-feWZLe8-pg2). Copyright 2024 KFYR.

    "text": "Making your own flashcards can be tedious, but they’re such a great study tool that it would be a shame to let that stop you from using them. Although there are major retention benefits to writing information down by hand, busy learners don’t always have time—so here are some great online options for making and using flashcards.\nThe benefits of flashcards for studying\nFirst, it's important to understand why you want to use flashcards to study, let alone why some apps and services are better suited to this task than others. Repeatedly quizzing yourself can really entrench the content of the flashcards into your memory, since you have to actively retrieve the information from your short- or long-term memory when you see a prompt. The best way to make your material really stick is to use the Leitner method, also known as spaced repetition, and flashcards are what make that possible. With this technique, you sort your flashcards into about five piles as you review them, moving them up a pile or down a pile depending on whether you get an answer right or wrong. Over time, you'll be able to review the cards in the higher-up piles less frequently, since you really grasp their contents, and you'll review cards in the lower-down piles more often, since you're struggling with them. Not only will you waste less time drilling material you know, you'll force your brain to etch it into your long-term memory so you can retrieve it on the rare instances you do go over those cards. A lot of the apps below actually use the Leitner method or a version of spaced repetition to automatically show you cards you're struggling with more often, which is what makes them so useful.",
