    "text": "* \"China is ready to work with all countries to build an open, inclusive, clean and beautiful world of lasting peace, universal security and shared prosperity,\" Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi stated. * Wang expounded on China's approaches to resolving global hotspot issues and achieving lasting peace and common security. * Looking forward, Wang said China will continue to uphold justice and advance win-win cooperation. BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Thursday expressed the country's resolve to unswervingly promote peace, stability and progress in a world overshadowed by protracted conflicts and lukewarm economic recovery. All countries rise and fall together in today's world and the sure path to meeting challenges is mutual assistance and win-win cooperation, said Wang, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee. The vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind, put forward by Chinese President Xi Jinping, goes beyond the obsolete zero-sum game mentality and points the right direction for humanity, Wang said at a press conference held on the sidelines of the annual session of the National People's Congress. \"China is ready to work with all countries to build an open, inclusive, clean and beautiful world of lasting peace, universal security and shared prosperity. The road ahead may be tortuous, but the future is bright,\" the top diplomat stated. SOLUTIONS TO HOTSPOT ISSUES During the 1.5-hour press conference, Wang expounded on China's approaches to resolving global hotspot issues and achieving lasting peace and common security. On the turbulent Middle East, Wang highlighted that China supports Palestine's full membership in the United Nations (UN) and calls for a more broad-based, more authoritative and more effective international peace conference to work out a timetable and road map for the two-state solution. \"Restoring justice to the Palestinian people and fully implementing the two-state solution is the only way to break the vicious circle of Palestinian-Israeli conflicts,\" Wang said. Turning to the Ukraine crisis, the foreign minister renewed calls for early talks as all conflicts have to end at the negotiating table. China supports the holding in due course of an international peace conference that is recognized by both Russia and Ukraine and ensures the equal participation of all parties and fair discussions on all peace plans, he said. In the face of multiple global challenges, Wang praised the UN's role as the core mechanism to realize peace and development on the planet, stressing that the role of the UN should be strengthened, not weakened, and the status of the UN must be upheld, not replaced. REFUTING \"TABLE OR MENU\" MINDSET It shouldn't be the case that those with the bigger fist have the final say and it is definitely unacceptable that certain countries must be \"at the table\" while some others can only be \"on the menu,\" Wang told reporters. On China-U.S. relations, the senior official urged the United States to take an objective and rational view of China's development and match its words with actions to honor its commitments on bilateral ties. \"In today's world, hegemonism finds no support and division leads nowhere. Major countries should not seek confrontation and the Cold War should not be allowed to come back,\" Wang stressed. China is always willing to strengthen dialogue and communication with the United States, and believes that the two sides can certainly find a proper way for two different major countries to get along in this world, he said. Wang lauded China-Russia relations for their great value in maintaining global strategic stability, promoting positive interaction among major countries and strengthening cooperation among major emerging countries. Such functions are part of the significance of China-Russia ties, which have \"forged a new paradigm of major-country relations that differs entirely from the obsolete Cold War approach,\" as he put it. Wang also expressed hope for smoother ties and closer partnership between China and the European Union (EU) because \"as long as China and the EU engage in mutually beneficial cooperation, no attempt to create bloc confrontation will succeed; as long as China and Europe stay committed to openness and win-win, deglobalization will not prevail.\" OPPORTUNITIES PAINFUL TO MISS Looking forward, Wang said China will continue to uphold justice and advance win-win cooperation. China will maintain stable relations with major countries, work with its neighbors for progress, and strive for revitalization with the Global South, according to him. This year will be a year of harvest for Global South cooperation and a new starting point for unity among Asian, African and Latin American countries, Wang said, adding that a new meeting of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation will be held in autumn this year in Beijing. To usher in a second golden decade of Belt and Road cooperation, China will promote the upgrading of physical connectivity, the strengthening of institutional connectivity and the deepening of people-to-people connectivity. Underlining China's role as a strong engine for growth, Wang noted that China's economy grew 5.2 percent last year, contributing one third of the world growth, and China's super large market with over 1.4 billion people is opening wider to the world. At the press conference, Wang announced a trial visa-free policy for Switzerland, Ireland, Hungary, Austria, Belgium and Luxembourg, starting March 14. He stated China's readiness to well develop international cooperation platforms including the China International Import Expo and the China International Fair for Trade in Services, and optimize its business environment. \"Spreading pessimistic views on China will end up harming oneself, and misjudging China will result in missed opportunities,\" Wang said. （Editor:Wang Su）",

    "text": "The Riff Raff Baby toy \"Riff the Fox Teether\" was recalled just before the Christmas holiday, raising concern that some may have been given as gifts unknowingly. The plastic toy for infants has two small parts that can detatch, creating a serious choking hazard. The New Zeland government's regulatory agency announced the recall last week, and is still trying to get the word out.\nThe Riff the Fox Teether is a plastic fox with a stick figure-like body and a large head. According to New Zealand's Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment , the fox's ears can become detached, posing a risk for choking. The agency asks that consumers stop using the toy immediately and not give it to any children. They can send an email to productsafetyinfo@riffraffbaby.com to get a refund.\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by 🤍Sage & Cleo 🤍 (@twolittleloves._)\nRiff Raff Baby has numerous products for infants and new parents, including toys, books and specialty items like hooded towels. In particular, the company sells \"sleep toys\" which are part stuffed animal, part blanket made for infants to hold in the cradle. The company has several characters to choose from including the fox, raccoon, koala, bear, bunny and fawn.\n\"Riff Raff's mission is to deliver magic moments and lasting memories to families all over the world through exceptional customer experience and industry-leading product solutions,\" reads the company's description . It also proclaims a \"parents supporting parents\" approach, with an emphasis on creativity and flexibility. Many product reviews on the site indicate that Riff Raff products were given as gifts this holiday season, so hopefully news of the recall spreads to all those customers.\nWhile this recall was initiated in New Zealand, Riff Raff toys are also sold in the U.S. Here, product recalls are generally handled by the U.S. Product Safety Commission ( CPSC ). The CPSC website includes options to subscribe for alerts and updates about recalls via email or other means. There, you can also search for specific products or look at categories of products to recent recalls that may affect you.\n0 comments Related:\nUrgent Recall Issued for Children's Playset Amid Christmas Season Check Your Stockings: Candy Bar Recall Issued Honda Recalls More Than 2.5 Million Cars",

    "text": "EL NUEVO DIARIO, JERUSALÉN. – El Ejército israelí siguió este jueves con su ofensiva en Gaza, donde continúan los duros combates con Hamás y aumentan los muertos, en un contexto en que Israel asume que sus operaciones irán por largo y debe comenzar a planear un escenario a medio plazo.\nMientras Hamás va difundiendo videos donde se ve a sus milicias haciendo emboscadas y atacando tropas y tanques israelíes, el Ejército continúa realizando operaciones en el norte, centro y sur de la Franja, entre ellas en la urbe meridional de Jan Yunis, donde las fuerzas israelíes «llevan a cabo misiones sin precedentes», dijo este jueves el ministro de Defensa israelí, Yoav Gallant.\n«Nuestras fuerzas llegan a zonas en las que nunca antes habíamos estado, tomando salas de control y eliminando a terroristas», añadió Gallant, durante una visita en el cuartel general de la División 98, cuerpo militar que combate ahora en el área de Jan Yunis.\nA su vez, las tropas intensifican su incursión militar en el área sur de la Franja, operación que iniciaron semanas atrás, centrándose también ahí en alcanzar «los centros de mando, depósitos de armas e instalaciones de producción» de armamento de las milicias.\nTodo ello, reiteró Gallant, con «la tarea de desmantelar a Hamás para que ya no tenga capacidad militar ni de Gobierno», fin para el que las fuerzas israelíes deberán demostrar «mucha perseverancia y determinación».\nDesde el inicio de la invasión terrestre en Gaza el 27 de octubre, al menos 167 soldados israelíes han muerto, mientras que la cifra de militares -tanto activos como reservistas- fallecidos desde el ataque de Hamás del pasado 7 de octubre superó este jueves los 500.\nTodo ello, mientras los ataques y bombardeos de Israel siguieron causando en las últimas horas cientos de muertos palestinos, que son más de 21.300 en los más de dos meses y medio de ofensiva, a lo que se añade una crisis humanitaria causada por el duro cerco israelí sobre Gaza, que la ha dejado con gran escasez de alimentos, recursos esenciales, medicamentos, agua potable o gasolina para electricidad.\nSegún la agencia oficial de noticias Wafa, decenas de gazatíes murieron este jueves debido a bombardeos sobre viviendas en el sur de Gaza, área donde se concentran gran parte de los 1,9 millones de desplazados internos en el enclave.\nEn la urbe de Rafah, punto más meridional del enclave, «al menos 20 ciudadanos murieron y decenas resultaron heridos como resultado de un bombardeo israelí que tuvo como objetivo una casa».\nLos aviones de combate israelíes también «lanzaron ataques contra una casa del campo de refugiados de Shaboura», en Rafah, que causó asimismo «decenas de fallecidos y heridos, la mayoría mujeres y niños», concretó Wafa. Por otro lado, más de 25 personas murieron en varios ataques sobre Jan Yunis, detalló la misma fuente.\nA su vez, entre otros incidentes, se informó de ataques en las localidades norteñas de Beit Hanún o Beit Lahia, que incluyeron también decenas de víctimas mortales, mientras las tropas israelíes siguen atacando el campo de refugiados de Al Maghazi, en la ciudad de Deir Balah, en el centro de Gaza, objeto de bombardeos casi constantes durante los últimos días.\nLos servicios médicos de la Media Luna Roja palestina informaron que sus equipos trasladaron al hospital a tres muertos y seis heridos por ataques contra una casa en el campo de Al Maghazi.\nSus equipos médicos también trabajan ahora con la Media Luna Roja de Egipto para crear un campamento para desplazados en la zona de Jan Yunis, que se espera que alcance las 1.000 tiendas de campaña.\nTodo ello se produce mientras Israel tiene que ir planeando sus actuaciones a medio plazo en Gaza, y un plan para la posguerra que por ahora no parece estar determinado, lo que genera preocupación a su principal aliado, Estados Unidos.\nJusto este jueves, el secretario de Defensa estadounidense, Lloyd Austin, habló con Gallant y discutió aspectos de «los preparativos para la fase de estabilización que debe seguir a las operaciones de combate», informó el Pentágono.\nLa Casa Blanca estaría presionando a Israel para que reduzca la intensidad de los ataques en Gaza, aunque Gallant dijo hace poco que estos se podrían prolongar todavía durante varios meses más.\nPor otro lado, según prensa israelí, el primer ministro israelí, Benjamín Netanyahu, debía celebrar este jueves una reunión de su Gabinete de Guerra para abordar posibles planes para la posguerra en Gaza, pese a que finalmente canceló el encuentro, mientras el Gobierno israelí sigue sin dar detalles claros sobre quién pretende que tenga el poder en Gaza o cómo debería gestionarse su reconstrucción.\nSegún medios israelíes, Netanyahu no quiso realizar encuentros para abordar esta cuestión hasta ahora, lo que preocupa a la Administración Biden, que teme que el Ejército israelí se quede estancado dentro del enclave indefinidamente.",

    "text": "Samsung Galaxy S25, prezzi più alti del previsto in Italia? A quanto pare si\nA poche ore dagli [ultimi rumor sul Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra](https://tech.everyeye.it/notizie/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-ottimo-smartphone-gaming-perche-770153.html), emergono delle informazioni non certo positive per gli utenti italiani che intendono acquistare il prossimo smartphone top di gamma 2025 della società coreana, che sarà presentato a fine mese.\nNelle scorse ore sul sito web di Zanetti Group ha infatti fatto capolino l’intera serie, con tanto di prezzi italiani (che però non sono stati confermati in via ufficiale dal produttore). Sebbene non indicati con il nome integrale, ma con quello in codice, è di fatto arrivata la conferma che i Galaxy S25 costeranno di più rispetto ai predecessori.\nPartendo dal Galaxy S25 base, come evidenziato dai colleghi di SmartWorld, la versione da 128 gigabyte è stata inserita ad un prezzo di 973,99 Euro, che diventano 1036,49 Euro per il modello da 256 gigabyte e 1162,99 Euro per quella da 512 gigabyte. Per fare un raffronto, il Galaxy S24 base dello scorso anno partiva da un prezzo di 929 Euro.\nPassando al modello Galaxy S25+, invece, la variante da 256 gigabyte è indicata a 1246,99 Euro, mentre quella da 512 gigabyte a 1371 Euro. Il Galaxy S24 Plus partiva da 1189 Euro.\nInfine, il Galaxy S25 Ultra, ovvero il modello ultratop della serie: i modelli 256/512Gb sono elencati rispettivamente a 1571,99 e 1696,99 Euro, mentre quello da 1 terabyte a 1948,99 Euro. Il Galaxy S24 Ultra partiva da 1499 Euro.\nNon vi è traccia invece del Galaxy S25 Slim, che dovrebbe fare parte della serie per mettersi in concorrenza, a fine 2025, con l’iPhone 17 Air.\n[Tapo C200 Telecamera Wi-Fi Interno FHD, Videocamera sorveglianza è uno dei più venduti oggi su ](https://www.amazon.it/dp/B07XLML2YS?tag=notizie_tech-21)\n[smartworld](https://www.smartworld.it/news/rincaro-galaxy-s25.html)\nQuesto testo include collegamenti di affiliazione: se effettui un acquisto o un ordine attraverso questi collegamenti, il nostro sito potrebbe ricevere una commissione in linea con la nostra [pagina etica](https://www.everyeye.it/advertising/).

    "text": "1 de 1 Reunião define fim da greve dos rodoviários em Manaus. — Foto: Divulgação/Semcom Reunião define fim da greve dos rodoviários em Manaus. — Foto: Divulgação/Semcom\nA paralisação dos rodoviários em Manaus chegou ao fim na tarde desta quarta-feira (16), após um acordo firmado entre o Sindicato dos Trabalhadores em Transportes Rodoviários e o Sindicato das Empresas de Transporte de Passageiros do Estado do Amazonas (Sinetram), com mediação da Prefeitura de Manaus.\nA greve, que afetou cerca de 30% da frota e impactou mais de 300 mil usuários do transporte coletivo, foi encerrada após uma rodada final de negociações conduzida pelo Instituto Municipal de Mobilidade Urbana (IMMU).\nA proposta construída assegura um reajuste salarial próximo ao percentual solicitado pela categoria e prevê avanços na discussão sobre motoristas que também atuam como cobradores, além de um plano para retirada gradual da função de cobrador em algumas linhas.\n“Por orientação do prefeito David Almeida, conduzimos a negociação com firmeza e responsabilidade. O acordo contempla pontos importantes das reivindicações e garante o restabelecimento do serviço à população”, destacou Arnaldo Flores, diretor-presidente do IMMU.\nO presidente do Sindicato dos Rodoviários, Givancir Oliveira, afirmou que a proposta foi aceita por ser razoável diante do atual cenário do sistema. “Não contempla tudo o que pedíamos, mas com certeza a greve acaba. Vamos formalizar com a diretoria”, disse.\nO advogado do Sinetram, Fernando Moraes, também elogiou a atuação da prefeitura. “A proposta tem viabilidade econômica e só foi possível graças à intermediação do IMMU e ao apoio direto do prefeito”, declarou.\nA greve havia começado na madrugada de terça-feira (15), após autorização judicial. Segundo o TRT da 11ª Região, a categoria era obrigada a manter pelo menos 70% da frota nos horários de pico e 50% nos demais períodos, sob pena de multa de R$ 60 mil por hora de descumprimento.\nDurante os dois dias de paralisação, usuários relataram atrasos e tumulto nos terminais. No Terminal 3, Zona Norte de Manaus, o autônomo Francisco Silva reclamou da demora: “Ontem foi difícil e hoje está sendo pior. Tá demorando mais ainda”.\nCom o fim da greve, a expectativa é que o serviço de transporte coletivo seja normalizado nas próximas horas em toda a capital.\n📲 Participe do canal do g1 AM no WhatsApp\nParalisação\nA iniciativa foi do Sindicato dos Trabalhadores em Transportes Rodoviários de Manaus, após uma decisão judicial autorizar a greve dos trabalhadores do transporte público.\nSegundo o Sindicato das Empresas de Transporte de Passageiros do Estado do Amazonas (Sinetram), nesta quarta-feira, 397 veículos de sete empresas pararam desde às 4h.\nSegundo a decisão do Tribunal Regional do Trabalho da 11ª Região (TRT 11), 70% da frota tem que circular nos horários de pico das 6h às 9h e das 17h às 20h.\nJá para os demais horários a circulação tem que ser no mínimo de 50% dos ônibus, sob pena de multa de R$ 60 mil por hora de descumprimento.\nAo g1, usuários que estavam no Terminal 3, localizado na Zona Norte de Manaus, reclamaram que neste segundo dia de greve os ônibus demoraram mais tempo para chegar do que no primeiro dia, e que também houve tumulto para entrar nos coletivos.\n\"Ontem foi difícil e hoje está sendo pior, tá demorando mais ainda. Se a gente for esperar por esses homens, tá difícil\", disse o autônomo Francisco Silva enquanto aguardava o transporte.\nAumento na passagem\nEm entrevista coletiva no fim da manhã desta quarta-feira, durante o cumprimento de agenda em uma escola na Zona Norte de Manaus, Almeida afirmou para jornalistas que o reajuste salarial pedido pela classe depende do reajuste da tarifa do ônibus , que hoje custa R$ 4,50.\n\"Esse é um dos itens que está ocasionando a greve, porque só pode dar o aumento para os rodoviários se tiver o aumento da passagem. Todas as capitais aumentaram\".\nEm fevereiro deste ano, o prefeito anunciou o aumento do valor da passagem para R$ 5 . A medida, no entanto, foi barrada pela Justiça do Amazonas sob a alegação de que faltaram transparência e estudos técnicos que justifiquem o aumento.\nEntre março e abril deste ano, a prefeitura e o Ministério Público se reuniram duas vezes para negociar o aumento . No último dia 10, o STJ suspendeu a liminar que impedia reajuste da tarifa e uma nova reunião deve ocorrer nos próximos dias.\n\"O Ministério Público hoje não está questionando o aumento da passagem. Na petição, eles estão questionando a metodologia do subsídio, então essa metodologia precisa ser discutida em outro momento\", afirmou David Almeida.\n\"Eu acredito que nos próximos dias a gente vá chegar em um entendimento para fazer o aumento da passagem, dar o aumento para os rodoviários e ter de volta a normalidade do transporte coletivo\", concluiu o prefeito.\nManaus",

    "text": "Leaders of the union representing striking Birmingham refuse collectors have said that the union and the workers will not back down as the council looks to impose compulsory redundancy on some striking workers. Industrial action by bin workers has been ongoing for several months, causing much disruption to the city refuse service, with supporters on all out strike since 11th March.\nWith negotiations between Birmingham City Council and Unite unable to progress to a mutually amicable solution, the council has today announced (Thursday 27th March) that it will look at compulsory redundancy for up to 76 workers. The affected workers have refused terms offered to them since the council announced it was axing the WRCO role in a bid to save funds.\nA statement from the council reads: “It is regrettable that it has come to this, the council has consistently tried to find a solution to the industrial action. We have made a very fair offer which means that no worker need lose any money. That offer remains open.\n“We confirm that regrettably we have informed Unite representatives that next week we will formally notify and enter a period of collective consultation regarding compulsory redundancies for those who have declined all offers on the table.”\nHowever, Unite general secretary Sharon Graham remained resolute, saying: “The council’s behaviour is absolutely disgusting. Bully boy tactics are just making this dispute worse – our members will not back down and neither will Unite.”\nThe council statement continues: “This is about securing a better waste service for the people of Birmingham. We thank staff who are working under difficult conditions and recognise the frustration of residents for which we apologise.”\nUnite national lead officer, Onay Kasab, said: “There is no positive spin Unite can put on today’s negotiations.\n“This development will be bitterly disappointing for Birmingham residents but while Unite is prepared to examine all options to resolve the dispute the same commitment does not apply to the council or the government commissioners who have oversight of the city.”\nAn update on the city council’s website says: “Throughout this process we have been very accommodating. Since the start of the industrial dispute, there have been regular and ongoing meetings with Unite officers and shop stewards to seek to resolve the dispute, including two under the auspices of ACAS.\n“We must improve this service and we would ask Unite to work with us as we make these changes for the benefit of the whole city.”\nTalks to negotiate a resolution to current industrial action will resume on Monday (31st March).\nREAD MORE:",

    "title": "Estados Unidos: turbulencias en Boeing ante un gran movimiento de huelga | Acento",
    "text": "Los trabajadores de Boeing en la región de Seattle, en el noroeste de Estados Unidos, votaron masivamente a favor de una huelga este viernes y rechazaron el nuevo convenio del gigante de la aviación, que dijo estar \"comprometido\" con las negociaciones en medio de su difícil situación financiera. La plantilla rechazó el acuerdo con un 94,6% de los votos y aprobó la huelga con un 96%, dijo Jon Holden, presidente del sindicato International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) Distrito 751. \"Nuestros miembros han hablado claro esta noche\", dijo el dirigente de este sindicato que representa a más de 30.000 trabajadores del fabricante aeronáutico en esta región. \"Haremos huelga a medianoche\", afirmó. \"Seguimos comprometidos\" La protesta afectará a dos grandes plantas de montaje en la región del estrecho de Puget y paralizará la producción de los aviones 737, 777 y 767, cuyas entregas ya están retrasadas. Esto supone un problema añadido, pues el fabricante de aviones cobra la mayor parte del pago (alrededor del 60%) una vez entregados los aparatos. Pese a la abrumadora votación a favor de la huelga, el grupo Boeing dijo en un comunicado que está \"comprometido\" con las negociaciones. \"Seguimos comprometidos con restablecer nuestra relación con nuestros empleados y el sindicato, y estamos listos para volver a la mesa de negociaciones para llegar a un nuevo acuerdo\", dijo la compañía. Según los analistas aeronáuticos de TD Cowen, una huelga de 50 días privaría a Boeing de entre 3.000 y 3.500 millones de dólares de liquidez y tendría un impacto de 5.500 millones de dólares en los ingresos. La plantilla se opuso al acuerdo preliminar alcanzado entre la dirección de Boeing y los líderes sindicales de la empresa que preveía un aumento salarial del 25% a lo largo de cuatro años y un compromiso de inversión en esta región. También preveía la construcción del próximo avión, anunciado para 2035, en el área de Seattle, cuna histórica del fabricante, que debía asegurar los empleos para las próximas décadas. Un aumento \"engañoso\" Sin embargo, los trabajadores consideraron que el acuerdo no era tan generoso como se pretendía y señalaron, por ejemplo, que el aumento del 25% era engañoso porque al mismo tiempo se eliminaba un bono anual que daba la compañía. \"Están hablando de un aumento del 25% y no es así\", dijo Paul Janousek, un electricista de la planta de Everett que votó a favor de la huelga después de concluir que el giro de Boeing fue \"engañoso\". Janousek, de 55 años y en Boeing desde hace 13 años, calcula que su aumento es solo de alrededor del 9% si se elimina el bono anual. El paro ocurre en un contexto delicado para Boeing, cuya reputación se ha visto empañada por distintos incidentes de seguridad aérea. El fabricante esperaba que sus concesiones fueran suficientes para evitar la huelga, en medio de su situación económica precaria tras los accidentes de sendos 737 MAX 8 en 2018 y 2019, que se cobraron la vida de 346 personas, y por multitud de problemas de calidad de producción. \"No es ningún secreto que nuestro negocio está pasando por un momento difícil, en parte debido a nuestros propios errores en el pasado. (…) Una huelga pondría en peligro nuestra recuperación\", advirtió el miércoles por la noche Kelly Ortberg, quien asumió las riendas de la compañía en agosto. El directivo, que una semana después de asumir se comprometió a \"reiniciar\" las relaciones con el sindicato IAM, instó a los empleados a no \"sacrificar\" el progreso futuro por \"frustraciones vinculadas al pasado\". La huelga se enmarca en un contexto de creciente conflictividad laboral en Estados Unidos, que ha tenido protestas similares en el sector automovilístico, el entretenimiento y otras industrias.",

Em alguns pontos, como no Rio de Janeiro, o volume de chuva poderá somar 200 milímetros (mm) até domingo (24).\nA chuva é consequência da aproximação de uma frente fria que avançou pela Região Sul do país nesta quinta-feira (21). O Centro Nacional de Monitoramento e Alertas de Desastres Naturais (Cemaden) informou hoje que os maiores volumes de chuvas devem ser registrados entre a noite de sexta-feira e a madrugada de sábado.\nNotícias relacionadas:\nCidades serranas do Rio alertam população para chegada de temporal. Sul e Sudeste têm alerta para chuva forte entre quinta e domingo.\n“Isso já é um problema, porque provavelmente vamos acumular volumes importantes de chuva durante a madrugada de sábado, e sabemos que a logística se torna mais difícil”, disse o diretor de Operações do Cemaden, Marcelo Seluchi.\nSegundo o Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia (Inmet), nesta noite, já podem ser registradas algumas áreas com chuva forte, descargas elétricas, granizo e rajadas de vento em São Paulo e no Paraná. A partir de amanhã, há previsão de acumulado muito alto de chuvas que pegam desde o litoral norte de São Paulo, todo o estado do Rio de Janeiro, a Zona da Mata de Minas Gerais e o sul do Espírito Santo.\n“Se a gente pegar os acumulados de chuva de hoje até domingo, podemos ter até mais de 200mm nessas áreas”, diz a coordenadora do Inmet, Márcia Seabra. Segundo ela, também há previsão de ressacas em algumas áreas e ondas de até 2,5 metros no litoral do Rio de Janeiro.\nNo Rio de Janeiro, as regiões mais atingidas serão a Costa Verde, a região metropolitana e, especialmente, a região serrana, onde poderá haver deslizamentos de terras mais generalizados. “Levando em conta o volume previsto, não podemos descartar episódios mais graves como corrida de massa ou corrida de detritos”, disse Seluchi. Essa situação pode abranger também a parte sul de Minas Gerais, que faz divisa com o estado do Rio.\nEm São Paulo, há possibilidade de inundações mais rápidas, com alagamentos urbanos ou transbordamento de córregos. Os deslizamentos de terra em São Paulo também serão mais pontuais e esparsos, mas pode haver interrupção de algumas estradas como a Rodovia dos Tamoios, que tem um protocolo de fechamento quando a chuva ultrapassa 100mm.\nA orientação para a população das áreas atingidas é observar as recomendações dos serviços de Defesa Civil municipais, estaduais e nacionais, por meio das redes sociais e canais oficiais. “Em locais onde há sirenes, a população deve seguir as orientações, deixando suas casas no momento em que o alerta é emitido”, diz o diretor do Centro Nacional de Gerenciamento de Riscos e Desastres (Cenad), Armin Braun.\nPara receber alertas da Defesa Civil por SMS, basta enviar uma mensagem para o número 40199 com o CEP de sua região. O contato também pode ser feito pelo telefone 199, o WhatsApp (61) 2034-4611 ou telegram @defesacivilbrbot.",
