    "title": "OPINION: 'Zanu PF's ‘liberation’ lie: The party never fought for democracy' – Nehanda Radio",
    "text": "In a recently circulating audio clip, a former senior Zimbabwean army commander made the shocking declaration that if there are any attempts to remove ZANU-PF from power, bloodshed will follow.\nHe boasted that the ruling party came to power through the barrel of a gun, not by the ballot box, and implied that no pen could dislodge them.\nThese remarks are not just reckless, but deeply revealing.\nThey strip away the long-standing myth that ZANU-PF fought to liberate Zimbabwe.\nInstead, they confirm what many have long suspected: ZANU-PF’s leadership waged war not for the people’s freedom, but for their own selfish pursuit of power.\nThis ominous warning is symptomatic of the deep-rooted belief within ZANU-PF that they are entitled to eternal rule, even in the face of growing public discontent.\nThe statement from the former army boss reminds us that beneath the veneer of liberation rhetoric lies a regime willing to use violence to cling to power, no matter the cost.\nThese dangerous words expose a harsh truth: ZANU-PF never genuinely fought for democracy or the people of Zimbabwe.\nIf they had, they would respect the will of the people, including the possibility of being voted out of office.\nThe Myth of Liberation\nFor decades, ZANU-PF has branded itself as the liberator of Zimbabwe, the party that freed the country from the oppressive yoke of colonial rule.\nThis narrative, however, is a distortion of history.\nWhile it is true that ZANU-PF and its military wing (ZANLA) played a role in the armed struggle against Rhodesian rule, their motivations were far from altruistic.\nZANU-PF did not fight for democracy; they fought for control.\nThe leadership of ZANU-PF, driven by personal ambition and a hunger for power, saw the liberation struggle as a means to an end—the end being their domination over the state.\nIn a truly democratic liberation, the aim is to empower the people, allowing them to choose their leaders and determine their own futures.\nTo directly receive articles from Tendai Ruben Mbofana, please join his WhatsApp Channel on: https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029VaqprWCIyPtRnKpkHe08\nYet from its earliest days, ZANU-PF’s actions showed that their understanding of freedom was selective.\nThey liberated the country only to place it under a new form of control, one where the party became the sole arbiter of power.\nThis control continues to this day, as the party’s refusal to accept electoral defeat shows a complete lack of regard for democratic principles.\nThe Core of Democracy: The Right to Choose and Reject Leaders\nAt the heart of any functioning democracy is the right of the people to choose—and to reject—their leaders.\nThis fundamental right is enshrined in Zimbabwe’s constitution, particularly in sections 60 and 67, which guarantee freedom of thought, belief, and political participation.\nThese rights are the cornerstone of any free society.\nYet ZANU-PF’s leaders, through both word and deed, have made it clear that they do not accept this fundamental democratic principle.\nReal freedom means allowing the people to make their own decisions, even if that means rejecting the ruling party.\nWhen ZANU-PF officials issue threats of bloodshed if they are voted out of power, they are betraying the very ideals they claim to have fought for.\nA true liberator would respect the people’s right to choose, including their right to choose a different political party.\nZANU-PF’s refusal to do so reveals the party’s contempt for democracy and exposes the lie at the heart of their so-called liberation struggle.\nZANU-PF’s True Aim: Self-Perpetuation, Not National Liberation\nThe history of ZANU-PF’s post-independence rule is one marked by a consistent pattern of self-perpetuation.\nFrom the outset, the party has sought to consolidate its hold on power through any means necessary, often at the expense of the very people it claimed to liberate.\nIn the early 1980s, the Gukurahundi massacres, in which thousands of civilians were killed in the Midlands and Matabeleland provinces, provided a stark reminder of ZANU-PF’s willingness to use extreme violence to crush dissent and maintain its grip on power.\nThe use of violence and intimidation has been a constant feature of ZANU-PF’s rule.\nThe party’s military origins have shaped its approach to governance, with force often used as a first resort rather than a last.\nThe militarization of the state under ZANU-PF has created a political environment where the army is not a neutral protector of the nation but a key pillar of the ruling party’s power structure.\nThis relationship between the military and ZANU-PF is at the heart of the former army boss’s recent remarks.\nIt underscores the fact that ZANU-PF’s struggle was never about the people—it was about the party’s leaders securing power for themselves.\nSanyatwe’s ‘Command Voting’: Another Symptom of Militarization\nThe recent remarks by Lieutenant General Anselem Sanyatwe provide yet another example of the growing militarization of Zimbabwe’s government under ZANU-PF.\nSanyatwe boldly declared that ZANU-PF would rule “until donkeys grow horns” and threatened that the military would enforce “command voting,” a system where Zimbabweans would be coerced into voting for the ruling party.\nSuch remarks are not only undemocratic but also expose the extent to which the military is being used as a tool to intimidate and control the electorate.\nSanyatwe’s statement reveals a disturbing willingness by ZANU-PF to use military force to remain in power indefinitely, further undermining any claims that the party ever fought for democracy.\nThe concept of “command voting” is antithetical to the principles of free and fair elections, as it transforms what should be a democratic process into an act of forced loyalty, where the outcome is predetermined by the state, not the people.\nThese remarks should also be viewed in the context of Zimbabwe’s long history of military involvement in politics.\nThe military’s role in suppressing dissent, manipulating elections, and intimidating opposition figures has been well-documented, from the Gukurahundi massacres to the violent crackdowns on opposition supporters in the 2000s and the 2018 post-election violence.\nSanyatwe’s words are a chilling reminder that the militarization of Zimbabwean politics is ongoing and intensifying, further eroding the possibility of genuine democratic reform.\nZimbabwe’s Long Journey to Genuine Freedom\nZimbabwe’s struggle for genuine freedom did not end in 1980 when the country gained independence.\nIn many ways, the people of Zimbabwe remain trapped under the weight of an authoritarian regime that does not respect their rights or their dignity.\nWhile colonial rule may have ended, the methods of repression and control used by ZANU-PF have eerily mirrored those of the former Rhodesian regime.\nDespite the promises of freedom and democracy made at independence, ZANU-PF has continuously undermined these principles.\nElections are marred by violence and intimidation, the public media is heavily controlled, and opposition parties are often prevented from operating freely.\nThe people of Zimbabwe have never been given the opportunity to fully exercise their democratic rights without fear of retribution.\nThe August 2023 Elections: A Case Study in ZANU-PF’s Electoral Fraud\nThe August 2023 elections are a prime example of ZANU-PF’s fraudulent approach to democracy.\nDespite widespread calls for transparency and fairness, the elections were marred by significant irregularities, voter intimidation, and the outright manipulation of the electoral process.\nElection observer missions from SADC and other international bodies raised serious concerns about the conduct of the elections, with reports of ballot tampering, biased media coverage, and the suppression of opposition rallies.\nIn the months leading up to the elections, opposition supporters were harassed, and some were even subjected to violent attacks.\nIn rural areas, where ZANU-PF’s influence remains strong, voters were intimidated into supporting the ruling party through threats of violence or denial of food aid.\nThis coercion demonstrates that ZANU-PF’s electoral victories are not the result of popular support but of manipulation and fear.\nThe Constitutional Right to Political Freedom: Section 67 in Focus\nZimbabwe’s constitution explicitly guarantees every citizen the right to freely participate in politics.\nSection 67 of the constitution provides for the right to vote, to campaign for political office, and to freely express political opinions.\nHowever, these rights are routinely violated under ZANU-PF’s rule. The threats made by the former army commander directly contravene these constitutional protections, as they instil fear in those who might otherwise vote against the ruling party.\nThis disregard for the constitution is not new.\nZANU-PF has a long history of flouting the law whenever it suits their interests.\nBy undermining the legal framework meant to protect political freedom, the party has effectively nullified the people’s right to choose their leaders.\nThis shows that ZANU-PF’s commitment to democracy is superficial at best, and non-existent at worst.\nThe ZANU-PF Regime’s Human Rights Record\nZANU-PF’s history of human rights abuses is long and well-documented.\nFrom the Gukurahundi massacres of the 1980s to the violent suppression of opposition movements in the 2000s and beyond, the party has repeatedly shown its willingness to use force to silence dissent.\nOperation Murambatsvina in 2005, where thousands of homes were destroyed and hundreds of thousands of people were displaced, is another example of the party’s ruthless disregard for the welfare of its citizens.\nThese abuses are not isolated incidents; they are part of a broader pattern of behaviour in which ZANU-PF prioritizes its own survival over the rights and freedoms of the people.\nThe party’s use of violence, intimidation, and fear has created an environment where true freedom is impossible, and where democracy is nothing more than a hollow promise.\nThe Future: What Must Change for True Freedom\nFor Zimbabwe to achieve genuine freedom and democracy, significant changes are needed.\nFirst and foremost, the military must be depoliticized and restructured to serve the nation rather than a single political party.\nThe security forces must be accountable to the people, not to ZANU-PF, and the culture of impunity that has allowed human rights abuses to continue unchecked must be dismantled.\nIn addition, electoral reforms are urgently needed to ensure that future elections are free, fair, and transparent.\nThis includes strengthening the independence of the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC), ensuring equal media access for all parties, and protecting voters from intimidation and violence.\nConclusion: Exposing the Lie\nThe remarks made by the former army boss in the leaked audio clip expose the fundamental truth about ZANU-PF: the party did not fight for democracy or the people.\nTheir struggle was for power, and that power has been maintained through fear, violence, and fraud.\nAs long as ZANU-PF remains in control, Zimbabweans will not experience the freedom and democracy they were promised in 1980.\nIt is time for Zimbabweans to recognize this reality and to continue their fight for a truly free and democratic society.\n● Tendai Ruben Mbofana is a social justice advocate and writer.

    "title": "School Bus Turned Tiny Home Cost a Mere $12K To Build, Boasts a Lovely Recycled Interior - autoevolution",
    "text": "If you're determined to move into a mobile home, not even a low budget can keep you from building a camper. Usually, one of the cheapest ways to do it is by converting a bus. Today, I'm presenting a bus conversion that cost a mere $12K. The best part? It also looks really good. Meet Adam and Emily and their tiny home and wheels. I've covered several Some people ask friends and family for things they can spare, while others are on the constant lookout for deals. You can even ask businesses for any spare wood, metal, or other useful material. And then it's a question of choosing the suitable utility systems and crafting a practical and aesthetically pleasing interior out of what you've got. For instance, Adam and Emily's bus is filled with thrifted and reused materials. What's more, about 90% of the wood inside this rig is recycled. What we have here is an International school bus sporting a 7.3-liter diesel V8 engine. The couple spent a mere $1,500 (€1,369) for the bus. Here's an excellent tip if you're interested in getting your hands on a used school bus: Ask someone in a nearby Emily's grandparents were tearing down their house, so the couple got a bunch of stuff from there as well, including lots of wood. Like in many You'll notice many exterior features on this bus. One is a storage compartment holding propane tanks, which power the fridge. A Webasto heater is also mounted underneath the vehicle, fed directly by the vehicle's fuel tank. At the rear, you'll discover a spacious deck holding a motorcycle carrier. By the way, I like that Adam and Emily aren't holding back on telling us what mistakes they made in their rig. For instance, if they were to do it again, they would make the deck half as long, as the already very long bus is difficult to maneuver in urban environments. Let's continue the tour inside. The couple left the driver's cabin pretty much as it was, with the original panels and switches, the only exception being a sound system they added, which is connected to speakers throughout the bus. Move deeper into the bus, and you'll be in the lounge area. It features two massive couches, one on each side of the interior. The one on the passenger side has ample storage space underneath, while the other hides the rig's electrical system, featuring an inverter, charge controller, and six golf cart batteries that make up two systems, one of which is 12 V and boasts a 460 Ah capacity. For heating, as I mentioned earlier, there's a Webasto diesel heater. However, the couple didn't want to rely on a single system, so they also added a Cubic Mini wood stove, a popular choice among van and Next up, we have the kitchen – the couple is passionate about cooking, so they wanted a proper space inside their tiny home. One feature that will probably catch your eye is a beautiful live-edge countertop, which integrates a decently sized sink. Other notable elements on this side are cabinets and drawers underneath the countertop and three overhead cabinets. On the opposite side, you'll find the other half of the kitchen. It comprises an oven with a three-burner stove, a fridge, and other storage spaces. By the way, the oven, fridge, and sink were transferred from that old camper I mentioned earlier. One unique design touch is a log next to the fridge that has mushrooms glued to it. The next part of this camper is dedicated to storage. You'll notice two closets and a food pantry with striking custom doors, as well as smaller storage spots. I love that the couple used driftwood to create handles for one of the closets. And finally, we have the bedroom at the very rear of the bus. It features a queen-size bed and windows on all sides. Moreover, a rear door can be opened for extra ventilation. Of course, just like on the rest of this rig, there are plenty of storage spots here: under the bed and on shelves. Oh, and part of the space underneath the bed is occupied by an immense 120-gallon (454-liter) freshwater tank. All in all, it's incredible how well-equipped this [incredibly cheap campers](/news/this-skoolie-is-an-affordable-tiny-home-for-a-family-of-five-features-clever-design-hacks-227231.html)here on autoevolution, one of the more recent ones being this $10K (€9.1K) build. But how can you build a cheap skoolie? Well, first of all, used buses are typically very inexpensive, with many priced at around $3,000 to $4,000 (€2,739 to €3,651). Furthermore, there are multiple ways of keeping costs to a minimum. Some people ask friends and family for things they can spare, while others are on the constant lookout for deals. You can even ask businesses for any spare wood, metal, or other useful material. And then it's a question of choosing the suitable utility systems and crafting a practical and aesthetically pleasing interior out of what you've got.

Here's an excellent tip if you're interested in getting your hands on a used school bus: Ask someone in a nearby [school bus](/news/40-foot-school-bus-was-converted-into-stunning-tiny-home-with-modern-amenities-226743.html)garage for guidance in finding a model, perhaps even offering a financial incentive. You have a better chance of making the right choice this way. They chose a clever way of carrying out the conversion. Adam and Emily bought a Coachmen Catalina trailer that was water damaged – its floor had been flooded and rotted. However, all the appliances and the rest of the camper were intact, and they ended up on the bus. Emily's grandparents were tearing down their house, so the couple got a bunch of stuff from there as well, including lots of wood. Like in many [DIY builds](/news/stealthy-custom-box-truck-integrates-a-bonanza-of-storage-spaces-and-creature-comforts-227232.html), there's always something to be added or modified, but the couple says they moved in when it was about 70% done.

A Webasto heater is also mounted underneath the vehicle, fed directly by the vehicle's fuel tank. At the rear, you'll discover a spacious deck holding a motorcycle carrier.

For instance, if they were to do it again, they would make the deck half as long, as the already very long bus is difficult to maneuver in urban environments. You can get on top of the bus either by using the rear ladder or by climbing through a hatch from inside. The roof holds four 100 W solar panels and a massive wooden deck integrating two enormous storage boxes. Another thing they would change is mounting these boxes on the left side in order to prevent them from hitting low-hanging branches while driving. Let's continue the tour inside.

Adam and Emily claim that, despite its compact size, the stove provides a lot of warmth. However, one issue is that only tiny pieces of wood fit inside the stove, so they always need to cut it to size. Of course, the wood stove has its own space in order to prevent things around it from getting too heated up or melting. Emily explained that they paid a mere $11 for the background tiles, which are made from recycled glass. Next up, we have the kitchen – the couple is passionate about cooking, so they wanted a proper space inside their tiny home.

You'll notice two closets and a food pantry with striking custom doors, as well as smaller storage spots. I love that the couple used driftwood to create handles for one of the closets. In a vehicle this size, there's enough space to fit a larger bathroom – in fact, you can even divide it into two parts, just like Adam and Emily did. This rig's shower room boasts cedar wood walls, a sizeable window, and a stainless steel pan. On the other side, you'll find a Nature's Head composting toilet. And finally, we have the bedroom at the very rear of the bus. It features a queen-size bed and windows on all sides. Moreover, a rear door can be opened for extra ventilation.

Actualizado a las 11:51 h.\nLa mesa negociadora del convenio a nivel español de Vestas Eólica concluyó el pasado martes sin acuerdo, y de no retomarse las conversaciones y haber un pacto en los próximos días —la fecha límite es el primero de abril— la plantilla pasará a regirse por los convenios provinciales de cada centro de trabajo.

Este jueves habrá de nuevo huelga y el personal gallego se concentrará en Lugo y el lunes está prevista una protesta en Muras.\nLa CIG reclama frenar «a perda de poder adquisitivo e a perda de dereitos laborais» de la plantilla y que la «flexibilidade» que Vestas pretende sea «voluntaria e ben remunerada».",
