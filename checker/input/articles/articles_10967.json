    "text": "In the world of renewable energy, few stories capture the blend of ambition, market dynamics, and technological innovation quite like that of Boralex Inc. (TSE:BLX), a beacon of growth and stability in the volatile energy sector. This tale unfolds against the backdrop of the Toronto Stock Exchange, where Boralex's stock performance, amidst fluctuating trading volumes and a noteworthy dividend announcement, paints a picture of a company not just surviving but thriving in today's market.\nMarket Performance and Analyst Optimism\nWith a consensus rating of Buy, Boralex stands out as a formidable player in the renewable energy sector. Analysts have pinned their hopes on a promising 32.2% upside from its current price, signaling strong confidence in its future trajectory. This optimism is further bolstered by the company's recent dividend announcement, which places it higher than 75% of all dividend-paying stocks, showcasing a payout ratio of 92.96%. Despite the inherent risks of the market, Boralex's performance remains a testament to its resilience, with institutional ownership at 60.33%, underscoring a robust market trust in its operations.\nOwnership Structure and Implications\nThe narrative of Boralex is not just one of numbers and financials but also of its unique ownership structure. Institutions holding a significant 53% of the company's shares speak volumes about its credibility among professional investors. However, this high level of institutional ownership also hints at the potential risks of a 'crowded trade'. On the flip side, the top 25 shareholders control less than half of the company's shares, indicating a wide dispersion that lends itself to stability and public trust. Remarkably, public ownership stands at 47%, a significant stake that empowers the general populace and reflects the company's broad appeal.\nTechnological Edge and Future Prospects\nAt the heart of Boralex's success is its unwavering commitment to innovation. The deployment of AI technology for market data analysis not only sets it apart in operational efficiency but also in strategic market positioning. This technological prowess, combined with its expansive operations across Canada, France, the United States, and the United Kingdom, positions Boralex as a leader in the development, construction, and operation of renewable energy power facilities. The company's stock performance, characterized by a 52-week high and low, along with its year-to-date performance and recent trading data, underscores the market's faith in its growth narrative.\nIn conclusion, Boralex Inc. represents a compelling story of resilience, innovation, and strategic foresight in the renewable energy sector. Its strong market performance, backed by a consensus rating of Buy and significant institutional ownership, reflects the confidence of the market in its potential. The company's commitment to dividend payouts, coupled with its technological edge in utilizing AI for data analysis, further cements its status as a key player in the global renewable energy landscape. As Boralex continues to navigate the complexities of the market, its blend of financial stability and innovative drive promises to keep it at the forefront of the renewable energy revolution.",

    "text": "Michelle Beisker selected as Trees Forever CEO Nonprofit board cites her proven leadership\nMarissa Payne Apr. 18, 2024 3:49 pm\nMichelle Beisker, appointed Trees Forever CEO (Courtesy of Trees Forever) Michelle Beisker will be the new chief executive officer at Trees Forever, the Marion-based nonprofit announced Thursday.\nBeisker, who begins April 29, succeeds Kiley Miller, who left last July. Interim CEO Debra Powers will remain with Trees Forever to help with the transition.\nTrees Forever works with community leaders and landowners across Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin to plant and care for trees and the environment. It is part of a public-private partnership with the city of Cedar Rapids to reforest the city after the August 2020 derecho’s ferocious winds knocked down about 65 percent of the city’s tree canopy — about 720,000 trees.\nBeisker most recently served as senior vice president of development at the Greater Cedar Rapids Community Foundation. Additionally, she served as chief operating officer at Waypoint Services in Cedar Rapids, program director at Four Oaks in Cedar Rapids, assistant vice president at Mount Mercy University and global sales manager at PMX Industries.\n“The work of Trees Forever aligns with my passion,” Beisker said in a statement. “I have been and continue to be dedicated to the betterment of our communities. I am so pleased to join this work that ensures access to nature in every neighborhood.”\n“Future generations will benefit from our current efforts to address climate change through planting trees,” Beisker said. “We have a lot to do, and I can't wait to get started.”\nTrees Forever said in a news release that Beisker was hired after an extensive search, saying she is a “proven leader with expertise in development, community advocacy, strategic planning and communications.”\nLynn Manternach, chair of the Trees Forever board, cited Beisker as a leader “who understands how to pull together diverse stakeholders to accomplish important things. Michelle is strategic, well-networked, people-focused and results-oriented.”\nBeisker joins Trees Forever as it launches its “Grow the Love\" campaign to raise money from individuals and smaller businesses toward post-derecho tree replanting. Currently, the organization has reached 61 percent of the $37 million fundraising goal to replant 42,000 public trees over 10 years.\n“We are so fortunate to have someone with Michelle's experience to lead Trees Forever during this critical and challenging time,” Trees Forever founder Shannon Ramsay said in a statement.\nComments: (319) 398-8494; marissa.payne@thegazette.com",

    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

( WVUE /Gray News) - Authorities in Louisiana say one of two missing children has been found dead while the other was found alive and well.\nThe Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff’s Office reported the recovery of 3-year-old Erin Brunett’s body Thursday afternoon. Her 6-year-old sister, Jalie Brunett, was found alive and well. The suspect was arrested in Jackson, Mississippi.\nThe Louisiana State Police issued an Amber Alert for the two children after finding their mother dead early Thursday morning.\nAccording to the Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff’s Office, 35-year-old Callie Brunett was missing for over 24 hours before being found found “brutally” slain in her home on North Cooper Road. Her death is being investigated as a homicide.\nHer two small children, 6-year-old Jalie and 3-year-old Erin were “unaccounted for,” Sheriff Daniel Edwards said.\nAn AMBER Alert was issued at 12:28 p.m. on Thursday for Jalie and Erin Brunett, who were unaccounted for after their mother, 35-year-old Callie Brunett, was found \"brutally murdered\" in her Loranger home. (LSP) Edwards said Brunett was reported missing Tuesday and because her car was not at her house, her family did not believe she was home. Thursday morning, her father made entry into her home and discovered her body and her children missing.\nThe manner of Brunett’s death was not disclosed, but Edwards said there was “blood everywhere.”\nCopyright 2024 WVUE via Gray Media Group, Inc.

    "text": "After years of broken promises , delayed launch events , and empty platitudes from Tesla about their cars, their car's capabilities, and what is possible with features like \"Autopilot,\" I've grown pretty skeptical of the brand. Remember when they said that robotaxis would be on the road in a year – back in 2019? I do. It's 2024 (with 2025 fast approaching) and that still isn't a reality. That's just one of the many tall tales that've been told about the future of the company and its automobiles, but their real-world products don't fail to disappoint either. Poor paint quality, bad panel gaps, disintegrating interior panels, and non-working center console screens have all left me unsatisfied with the Tesla driving experience. I've driven and tested a number of Teslas over the years, none of which lived up to the hype of their launch events, and several of which failed to operate well as simple transportation. We've already talked about how the Cybercab is all smoke and mirrors , but seeing it in person today at the Los Angeles Auto Show really hammered home to me just how bad an idea the Cybercab is, and how unlikely it is to materialize in a real, timely, or successful fashion. The quality isn't there Tesla has claimed that the Cybercab will have a relatively small price tag – under $30,000 (a claim I'll believe when I see it). But, even at that price point, I would expect more from the build quality. Now, this is far from a production vehicle, but it's still intended to showcase what Tesla has in mind, and yet the Cybercab's paint, or wrap (it's hard to tell), looks like it came out of a Krylon can from Home Depot. The flat gold color looks cheap from just about every angle. Hopefully the interior will get revised before taking on passengers, too: the seating surfaces look flat, unsupportive and almost completely lacking in bolstering. There are no visible adjustments to seat angle or location, so you're left upright and uncomfortable, and far away from the center screen. Essentially, the seats look like a park bench that's been wrapped in low-grade vinyl. I've been pretty forgiving with pre-production vehicles in the past, and I hope that Tesla will up the ante before these go on sale, but with its track record that may be a vain hope. The lack of a steering wheel is disturbing On top of low build quality, the missing steering wheel is still disconcerting. Sure, Tesla is bound to save money on parts when eliminating things like the steering wheel and pedals (and the associated bits that connect them to the drivetrain), and that's likely part of the cost savings passed on to the consumer, but what's the true cost? I don't trust that the Cybercab will be able to navigate new and uncharted territory on the road by itself, so there's the likelihood that I'll be left stranded if I own one. With several reported incidents and the federal investigations surrounding their driver aids , it's clear to me that Tesla hasn't mastered Level 3 autonomy yet, much less the Level 4 which starts to count as true \"self-driving.\" And, until that's perfect, I'm unwilling to believe that they're ready to deploy Level 4 vehicles on the street: cars like this, without steering wheels and pedals entirely. What's with the seating configuration and the doors? It's been said before, but it bears repeating: what good is a taxi with just two seats? Sure, many cabs offer just the back seat for riders, but even the oldest and crustiest Crown Victorias rolling around New York have a bench seat big enough for three in the rear. Most ride-share apps offer larger vehicles for bigger ride parties (several three-row options are available on my phone right now), or at least the option of using the front passenger seat. But there's no front and back here, in the Tesla, just the single row of underwhelming seats. Then, there are the doors. Remember the terrible Falcon Wing doors on the Model X? Even Musk admitted that they were a bad idea. The Cybercab's butterfly doors are nearly as bad. Doors that open with such a wide and horizontal path will need a lot of space. If your destination has tight parking or a busy street on arrival, it may be some time before it believes that you have the space to open one of the large butterfly doors. Parking will be an issue in tight garages too. It almost seems as though nobody thought of these real-world issues before putting butterfly doors on a car intended to usher in some sort of fictional autonomous future. Since there's no real evidence to suggest that the Cybercab (or a fully-functional, unsupervised version of Full Self-Driving) will deploy anytime soon, Tesla has time to fix all these design issues. Still, you won't catch me holding my breath for that moment.",
