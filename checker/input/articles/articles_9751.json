    "title": "Canadian Soccer Business launches legal action against media partner Mediapro - Burnaby Now",
    "text": "Canadian Soccer Business has launched legal action against Mediapro, its media partner, over breach of contract in a move that will have a major ripple effect on the sport in Canada. Essentially the move means CSB has taken back the broadcast rights to all its properties and is looking for new broadcast/media partners. CSB, whose ownership group and board includes the Canadian Premier League owners, looks after marketing and broadcast rights for both the Canadian Premier League and Canada Soccer. Mediapro is a Barcelona-based multimedia communications group. Mediapro Canada owns OneSoccer, the streaming service that airs both CPL and Canadian national team games. The CSB move leaves OneSoccer without its core Canadian content. CSB alleges Mediapro \"failed to meet significant contractual obligations, including defaulting on the majority of its rights fees due for 2023 and failure to secure broader audiences for Canada’s national teams, the Canadian Championship and the Canadian Premier League.\" \"Our decision to pursue legal action was not one we took lightly, but we felt it was necessary to protect the tremendous investments we have made to build the game in Canada,\" CSB said in a statement. \"By taking back full control of our rights we will immediately have the opportunity to do so with new partners who have the ability to reach larger audiences.\" CSB declined further comment other than the one-paragraph statement. But it is believed the money in dispute is well into the millions. A Mediapro Canada official declined to comment or provide his name when reached by phone in Mississauga. Clearly the CSB hope is that the break with Mediapro will lead to a more satisfactory media partner and getting its product out to more viewers. OneSoccer has had a hard time getting cable providers to open their doors to its service, although the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission ruled last March that Rogers Communications had given preferential treatment to its own Sportsnet service over OneSoccer. The inability to get its properties on major broadcast outlets, other than Telus, is believed to part of CSB's beef with Mediapro. And while CSB restricted its comments to Thursday's statement, it seems unlikely it would take such a radical step if it was not confident it could find a replacement media partner, given the Canadian women are in action next month at CONCACAF W Gold Cup, the Canadian men' are playing a Copa America playoff March 23 and the sixth season of the CPL kicks off April 13. The CPL unveiled Mediapro as its media partner in February 2019, less than three months before kicking off its inaugural season. The partnership with Canadian Soccer Business was announced as a 10-year deal. At the time, a source said Mediapro was investing $200 million into the Canadian project over the lifetime of the deal. Scott Mitchell, CEO of Canadian Soccer Business, called it “the single-largest commitment any company has ever made in terms of soccer in Canada.” The agreement gave Mediapro global and domestic media rights to the CPL, the Canadian Championship and Canadian men’s and women’s teams. It also included rights to League 1 Ontario matches, a feeder league under the CPL umbrella. “It’s easy to define our plan in one sentence — we want to build a home for Canadian soccer,” Oscar Lopez Garcia, then CEO of Mediapro Canada, said in 2019. The deal meant the CPL had someone to handle its game production. At the time the deal was announced, Mediapro said it had some 70 production trucks worldwide and was producing games in 16 different leagues. Mediapro also produced all Canadian national team games that fall under Canadian Soccer Business jurisdiction. The company has been in a state of flux of late. Mediapro refinanced its debts in 2022, handing its majority shareholder, Hong Kong-based Southwind Group, more control. Mediapro co-founder Jaume Roures left the company in October and there were reports around that time that Southwind was looking to sell its 80 per cent stake in Mediapro. --- Follow @NeilMDavidson on X platform, formerly known as Twitter This report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 25, 2024.

    "title": "NVIDIA Warns: GeForce RTX 40-Series GPUs Could be in Shortage in Q4 | TechPowerUp Forums",
    "text": "During NVIDIA's recent Q3 earnings call, CFO Colette Kress cautioned about potential GPU supply constraints in the fourth quarter despite strong gaming sector performance. The gaming division posted impressive results, with $3.2 billion in revenue, representing a 15% increase from the previous year. However, Kress indicated that fourth-quarter gaming revenue might see a decline due to supply limitations, though she reassured that supply should stabilize in early 2025. The company is scaling back RTX 40-series production as it prepares for the anticipated launch of its next-generation Blackwell architecture, which is expected to debut at CES 2025. The RTX 50-series GPU lineup, particularly the flagship RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 models, is rumored to be unveiled during the January event.\n\"Gaming, although sell-through was strong in Q3, we expect fourth-quarter revenue to decline sequentially due to supply constraints.\" For consumers, this could mean limited availability and higher prices for gaming GPUs during the holiday shopping season. The shortage is expected to primarily affect RTX 40-series cards, with a particular impact on laptop GPU availability. However, NVIDIA plans to continue producing select RTX 40 mobile chips alongside the upcoming RTX 50 series, suggesting a slow transition between generations. The holiday season is upon us, so this shortage of current-gen models could cost the company some additional customers, as the customer spending usually holds until holidays and holiday discounts.\nView at TechPowerUp Main Site | Source",

Advertisement\n\"We ended up catching the first pig really easy in the field. It actually went very smooth and we got him in the van, but the other little guy, he was out. So probably about 30 minutes of up and down the hills, we ended up getting him in the corner of a yard with a bit of fencing that had broken,\" Jacenda Byer of Petra's Pawdicures told Castanet.\nFaith Affleck, owner of Star's Piggly Wiggly Sanctuary, said the watching elementary school students were clearly on the side of the pig.\n\"They were cheering hard for him to 'Go, piggy, go,'\" she said.\nThe pigs are being cared for at Star's Piggly Wiggly Sanctuary while officials attempt to identify their owner.

    "text": "Пенсионера осудили за захват заложницы в аэропорту Алматы\nМужчина признан виновным по трем статьям УК.\nТурксибский районный суд города Алматы рассмотрел в сокращенном порядке уголовное дело в отношении 67-летнего Машрапбека Баратова, который, угрожая ножом, напал на сотрудницу аэропорта. Ему вменяли обвинения по статье 293, часть 3 УК (хулиганство), статье 261, часть 2, пункт 4 УК (захват заложника), статье 273 УК (заведомо ложное сообщение об акте терроризма), передает Liter.kz.\nВина Машрапбека Баратова доказана его признательными показаниями, а также показаниями потерпевшей, свидетелей, протоколами процессуальных действий, вещественными доказательствами.\n“Подсудимый признал вину, в содеянном раскаялся. Потерпевшая просила назначить справедливое наказание. Прокурор просил назначить наказание в виде 10 лет 6 месяцев лишения свободы. Приговором суда Б. признан виновным по всем пунктам обвинения по статьям 293, часть 3, 261, часть 2, пункт 4, 273 УК. С учетом личности виновного, тяжести содеянного и предыдущей судимости ему назначено 11 лет лишения свободы”, – сообщили\n[в пресс-службе]суда.\nПриговор суда не вступил в законную силу.\nНапомним, вечером 7 марта 2025 года в аэропорту Алматы мужчина внезапно напал на сотрудницу досмотра, схватил ее за волосы и приставил нож к горлу. Он кричал, что у него в рюкзаке бомба, и угрожал взорвать ее. Ситуация накалялась с каждой секундой, но спустя несколько минут нападавшего удалось обезоружить. Мужчина в гражданской одежде, дождавшись удачного момента, молниеносно выбил нож из рук преступника и скрутил его.\nНападавшего тут же передали полиции, а героя дня Мусу Абдраимова отметил Касым-Жомарт Токаев. Президент поручил наградить смельчака за проявленное мужество.\nВ Алматы Мусу Абдраимова наградили медалью “Ерлігі үшін”.\nВ апреле 2025 года в Алматы стартовал судебный процесс по делу о захвате заложницы в международном аэропорту.\nТакже выяснилось, что в ноябре 2024 года подсудимый уже становился героем негативных публикаций в СМИ – мужчина набросился в автобусе на женщину и ударил ее.",
