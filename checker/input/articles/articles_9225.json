    "title": "Guest Opinion: Philippines' actions in Xianbin Jiao waters infringe on China's sovereignty, threaten regional peace-Xinhua",
    "text": "by Joseph Matthews The Philippine coast guard's actions in Xianbin Jiao waters in the South China Sea have not only seriously violated China's territorial sovereignty, but also posed a threat to regional peace. Since mid-April, the Philippines has anchored its coast guard's BRP Teresa Magbanua (MRRV-9701) in the lagoon of the Xianbin Jiao and is reportedly planning to send a second vessel to anchor in the lagoon. These moves are part of a broader strategy of the country to challenge China's sovereignty in the South China Sea, alongside the long-disputed Ren'ai Jiao and Huangyan Dao. I strongly believe that the Philippines is planning to ground a ship on the Xianbin Jiao as it did back in 1999 when the country intentionally grounded a retired warship on Ren'ai Jiao to use it as an outpost. Philippine President Ferdinand Romualdez Marcos's administration is portraying itself as a victim, while at the same time, inviting wolves into the house and willingly acting as their pawns. In April, the United States moved a mid-range missile system that can fire Standard Missile-6 and Tomahawk missiles to the northern Philippines, on the pretext that the system would be used for military drills. In my view, the system was brought to challenge China's sovereignty in the South China Sea, which threatened and endangered regional stability. Ever since taking office, Marcos and his administration have been more assertive and aggressive in its dispute with China. Apart from the deployment of the missile system, Marcos has also allowed the United States to use nine military bases to store military hardware and equipment, alongside arranging military drills with the United States, Japan, and Australia in the disputed waters. These moves are indications that the administration is looking for a confrontation over consultation, and conflict instead of dialogue. The path Marcos's administration has chosen will lead to economic, political, and social instability and high tension not only in the South China Sea, but also in the ASEAN region. I remember that during Rodrigo Duterte's presidency, the Philippines improved its relations and cooperation with China on various issues, developing stronger and stable ties with the country, as well as a successful code of conduct with China and the rest of ASEAN. However, relations deteriorated during the presidency of Marcos due to increasing tensions over the South China Sea. Marcos's administration's provocations in Xianbin Jiao waters have infringed on China's sovereignty and integrity, violated the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea and threatened peace in the South China Sea and the entire region. Therefore, China, which has indisputable sovereignty over the islands and reefs in the area and adjacent waters, is entitled to take resolute action.

(Foto Prensa Libre: Hemeroteca) El sacerdote nicaragüense Carlos Áviles, vicario general de la Arquidiócesis de Managua, capital de Nicaragua, fue detenido este jueves por la Policía en medio de tensiones entre el Gobierno del presidente Daniel Ortega y la iglesia católica, denunció la abogada e investigadora nicaragüense exiliada Martha Patricia Molina.\n“El Ministerio del Interior amanece realizando su primera arbitrariedad.

Su secuestro se suma al encarcelamiento del obispo Isidoro Mora, dos sacerdotes y dos seminaristas en los últimos días”, indicó la Unidad Nacional en una declaración.\nEn el caso de Mora, obispo de la diócesis de Siuna, en el Caribe de Nicaragua, quien fue encarcelado junto a dos seminaristas, fue detenido el 20 de diciembre un día después de invocar en una homilía al obispo encarcelado Rolando Álvarez, condenado en febrero pasado a más de 26 años de prisión por delitos considerados traición a la patria tras negarse a abandonar su país.\nNi el Gobierno que preside Daniel Ortega ni la Policía Nacional ha confirmado o negado la presunta detención de otro sacerdote.\nEn el caso de Mora es el segundo obispo detenido en Nicaragua. El primero fue Álvarez, quien el 10 de febrero pasado fue condenado a 26 años y 4 meses de prisión, despojado de su nacionalidad, y suspendidos sus derechos ciudadanos de por vida por delitos considerados traición a la patria.\nEsa condena fue dictada un día después de que Álvarez rechazó subirse a un avión que lo iba a llevar, junto con otros 222 excarcelados políticos nicaragüenses, hacia Estados Unidos, lo que provocó la indignación del presidente Ortega, quien en cadena nacional lo calificó de “soberbio”, “desquiciado” y “energúmeno”.\nLas relaciones del Gobierno de Ortega y la Iglesia católica viven momentos de gran tensión, marcadas por la expulsión y encarcelamiento de sacerdotes, la prohibición de actividades religiosas, y la suspensión de sus relaciones diplomáticas.\nArchivado en:\nConferencia Episcopal de Nicaragua Crisis en Nicaragua Persecución en Nicaragua represión en Nicaragua Notas de interés",

    "text": "I Had ChatGPT Brainstorm Holiday Gift Ideas for My Family. Frankly, It Sucked One of the stores the AI suggested doesn't even exist. The most wonderful time of the year is around the corner. But there's one part of the season I don't find particularly wonderful: trying to find the best gifts for my loved ones within my budget. AI is evolving fast, and it can do lots of exciting things. So I thought, maybe it could help me come up with some holiday gift ideas. After all, if it can [help us with our chores](https://www.cnet.com/videos/these-ai-robots-can-do-your-chores-for-you/) and make it easier to [choose a new hairstyle](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/i-tried-ai-to-change-my-hair-before-seeing-a-stylist-it-could-save-you-hundreds/), surely it can help a guy stuff some stockings and put some presents under the tree. Right? Wrong. If I'd listened to ChatGPT's suggestions, I don't think my family would be very pleased. And I might still be wandering the streets searching for the local toy store the AI made up. A look at my conversation with ChatGPT Here's what I asked ChatGPT to do for me and how it responded. Gift ideas for my wife My quest for a great and thoughtful gift for my wife did not get off to a great start. Prompt #1: Help me find a holiday gift for my wife for less than $300. She loves shoes, jewelry and vacations. ChatGPT offered some suggestions that I think I could have come up with on my own, including \"stylish shoes,\" \"personalized jewelry\" and a \"weekend getaway.\" I don't think anyone can book a nice weekend getaway for less than $300, but I figured maybe ChatGPT knows someone who knows someone who can get me a deal. So, I pursued the vacation angle. Prompt #2: Where can we book a weekend getaway for less than $300 near Chicago? The recommendations were all great spots: Lake Geneva, Wis.; New Buffalo, Mich. and Galena, Ill. But ChatGPT didn't do much to help me stick to my $300 threshold. Its savings tip? \"You can use websites like Airbnb, Booking.com or Kayak to find specific accommodations and check for deals.\" Not exactly earth-shattering advice. I don't need a machine to tell me that Airbnb exists. Prompt #3: Let's go back to the personalized jewelry idea. Where can I find a meaningful necklace for her for less than $300? ChatGPT recommended Etsy, Amazon and Zales -- again, nothing I couldn't have thought of myself. I was starting to think that AI wouldn't be much use for my holiday shopping list, so I decided to ask it for help with a different part of gift-giving. Prompt #4: Can you help me write a thoughtful message to include with a necklace? She has had a long year. Her mother passed away. ChatGPT wrote: My Love, As we move forward, I want you to carry a piece of my heart with you, just as your mother will always be with us in spirit. This necklace is a reminder of the love that surrounds you and the strength you possess. In the moments when you feel overwhelmed, remember that you are not alone. I am here for you, always. With all my love, [Your Name] My wife's mother was a wonderful woman. But she would laugh at the thought of carrying a piece of my heart anywhere. Another miss from ChatGPT. Verdict: At this point, I decided that shopping for my wife would continue to fall on my shoulders. After all, we got married. The least I can do is try to put some thought into a gift instead of hoping a machine will do it all. Gift ideas for my son But what about my son? He's only 3 years old, which means that he thinks everything is awesome. Surely, AI can do the trick here, right? Prompt #5: Alright, let's talk about buying a gift for my son. He is 3 years old. He loves cars and construction vehicles. I want to buy him something that he will love, but I'm also conscious of not spoiling him. How much is a good amount to spend? Chat GPT's response: For a three-year-old, a budget of around $50 to $100 is often a sweet spot. This allows you to find a quality toy that he will love without going overboard. Here are a few gift ideas that fit his interests: Construction Vehicle Set: Look for a set of durable toy construction vehicles (like trucks, diggers, and loaders) that he can play with together. Brands like Tonka and LEGO have great options. Remote Control Cars: A simple remote control car designed for young kids can be really fun and engaging for him. Car Track Set: A race track or car garage set can provide hours of imaginative play. Many sets come with cars included. Books about Cars or Construction: There are wonderful picture books about cars and construction vehicles that can help fuel his imagination. Building Blocks: Consider a set of blocks that he can use to create his own vehicles or construction sites, combining his love of cars with hands-on play. I appreciated that AI was recommending a maximum of $100. Like many parents, I'm guilty of buying anything my son wants to ensure he's happy. The bot was reminding me of sage advice: Money doesn't buy love. This was promising. I pressed on. Prompt #6: We live in Chicago. I would like to buy him a gift from a local toy store. Any suggestions? ChatGPT's list included a call-out to a retailer named \"The Toy Gene,\" which it said is located in Lincoln Park. That's my neighborhood, but here's the thing: The Toy Gene is not a place. I searched for it on Google, and the closest thing to any merchant with \"Gene\" in the name is Gene's Sausage Shop. Maybe ChatGPT would correct itself if I asked for more information. Prompt #7: Tell me more about The Toy Gene. ChatGPT obliged and told me: The Toy Gene is a charming toy store located in Lincoln Park, Chicago. Here are some highlights about the store: Curated Selection: The Toy Gene offers a carefully curated selection of high-quality toys, games, and gifts for children of all ages. They focus on educational and imaginative play, making it a great place for thoughtful gifts. Variety of Toys: You'll find a range of items, including building sets, puzzles, art supplies, and, of course, plenty of vehicles -- perfect for your son's love of cars and construction toys. Support for Local: The store emphasizes supporting local and small businesses, so many of the products are from independent manufacturers and artisans. Interactive Environment: The Toy Gene has a warm and inviting atmosphere, often encouraging children to explore and play with the toys on display. Events and Workshops: They occasionally host events, workshops, or story times that engage children and families, making it a community-friendly spot. Friendly Staff: The staff is known for being knowledgeable and helpful, ready to assist you in finding the perfect gift. If you visit, you might find something truly special for your son while enjoying the local shopping experience! Sounds great… if I could find the place. Prompt #8: What is the address for The Toy Gene? According to ChatGPT, The Toy Gene is located at 1250 W. Armitage Ave., Chicago, IL 60614 I live on Armitage. In fact, I live around seven blocks from this location -- which means I can confirm that Armitage dead-ends before the 1250 marker. Was ChatGPT trying to lure me to an alley with this info about friendly staff and an interactive environment? Prompt #9: That address doesn't really exist in Chicago. Are you sure you're right? ChatGPT apologized for the oversight and told me the correct address for The Toy Gene is 1814 W. Armitage Ave., Chicago, IL 60622. It then thanked me for my patience and added: I hope you find some wonderful toys for your son! Prompt #10: I'm looking at Google Street View right now. That address looks like a condo building. Are you sure you're right? Finally, ChatGPT seemed to admit defeat: I'm really sorry for the confusion. It looks like I made another error. The Toy Gene actually has relocated, and I don't have the most up-to-date information. To find the current address, I recommend checking their official website or social media pages, as they often provide the latest details about their location. If you need help finding another local toy store, just let me know! Verdict: ChatGPT had written a sappy note to my wife and dreamt up two fake addresses for a fake toy store. The holidays are off to a good start. Can ChatGPT help you with your holiday shopping? Probably not If you're reading this, it means you have the desire to give a good gift and an internet connection. It also means you're savvy enough to find places to purchase gifts without AI's help. Don't count on ChatGPT to give you any recommendations you probably can't come up with on your own. For example, when I told it that I wanted to buy something for my parents, who are 75 years old and love farmers markets, one recommendation was to buy them a gift card to their favorite farmers market. Not exactly imaginative. The one upside of ChatGPT: It's enthusiastic! Nearly every response from ChatGPT ends with an exclamation point. Even if you're overwhelmed by the holidays, the machine wants you to feel happy. And in some cases, the machine shares some simple yet smart advice: Setting a clear budget will help you enjoy the holidays without the stress of overspending! That's one recommendation I can agree with. But if you want to learn how, you're better off [seeking tips elsewhere](https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/holidays-on-a-budget-5-tips-to-save-money-this-season/).",

    "text": "Eli Susman was a fairly experienced meditator when he attended a month-long retreat at Plum Village, a Buddhist monastery in Southern France in 2017. The UC Berkeley PhD candidate in clinical science had been on other retreats where participants spent most of their time meditating. So he was surprised when he saw that the daily Plum Village retreat schedule included only 30 minutes of formal seated meditation a day. Midway through the retreat he decided to extend one of his sessions, sitting beneath a tree for three hours. Later, he ran into a monk named Brother Treasure and told him about his practice. The monk’s response was not what he expected. “Three hours?” Susman remembers Brother Treasure telling him with a smile. “How about three breaths? That’s all it takes to step into the present moment.” The words stuck with Susman. It led him to wonder whether an abbreviated practice that takes no more than a few breaths can make a difference in someone’s life. Seven years later, he and his colleagues at Berkeley’s Golden Bear Sleep and Mood Research Clinic have evidence that it might. Earlier this year they [published a paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005796724000251) online in the journal Behaviour Research and Therapy that describes how a simple 20-second self-compassion “micropractice” lowered stress levels and improved the mental health of undergraduate volunteers who did it every day for a month. “Two of the biggest barriers people have for developing a meditation habit is having the time to do it and developing the habit of doing it regularly,” Susman said. “Micropactices are like tiny training sessions that are based on the most potent parts of therapeutic practices.” Below, Susman describes the practice he developed for the study and explains how anyone can use it to try to feel better in less than one minute a day. This interview has been lightly edited and condensed for length and clarity. How do you describe the 20-second self-compassion micropractice that you studied? The [instructions](https://osf.io/k8utw) we gave were to close your eyes and call to mind something about yourself that has been bothering you and making you feel unworthy, unloved or not enough and notice what arises in the body. Then we asked people to send kindness and warmth to themselves by placing one hand over the heart and another over the belly with the energy of giving themselves a hug and notice what arises in the body now. Next, we invited them to ask themselves, “How can I be a friend to myself in this moment?” Finally we told them to open their eyes when they were ready. And doing this for 20 seconds a day really made a difference in the lives of study participants? Yes, but it only worked for people who practiced it regularly. In our study we looked at the subset of people who practiced daily and at the whole sample of people who were given the instruction. More frequent practice was associated with greater increase in self-compassion and a greater reduction in stress and mental health problems like symptoms of depression or anxiety compared to a control group. What are some ways that people can send kindness and warmth to themselves? The key phrase we used in the study was “How can I be a friend to myself in this moment?” What we meant by that is imagine you were seeing a friend or your younger self in a similar situation and you were being really caring to that friend. What would you tell them to do? How would you ask them to be? You can also imagine yourself receiving unconditional love from someone like a mentor, a parent or a close friend. How would they relate to you in this moment of suffering? Is there a way you can give that same compassion to yourself? Does it matter where people do this practice? We didn’t look at that, but that’s a great question. Why is it helpful for people to touch their stomach and chest while doing the exercise? There has been so much work on touch and how beneficial it can be for people to receive touch, but it had not been looked at as a standalone intervention for emotional well-being in terms of people offering self-compassionate touch to themselves. I was interested in the synergy between thinking self-compassionate thoughts and doing this embodied form of self-compassionate touch. It offers two potential ways of regulating yourself. I should also say that we told participants they could choose other forms of touch like stroking yourself on the cheeks or giving yourself a hug. What’s most important is that the method of touch supports you in feeling compassionately toward yourself. I was surprised that the majority of students who participated in the study said they were too busy to do this 20-second practice everyday. What’s that about? I was just joking with a friend about this, and she said that when people are stressed they can get wrapped up in feeling like they can’t take 20 seconds to pause. It might be more a mind-set than a reality, but there is more work to be done on how to help people feel like those 20 seconds are going to make a difference in their lives. We wash our hands for 20 seconds. We brush our teeth for two minutes. Why not take 20 seconds to do this? Do you have any advice on how people can make this practice a habit? It can be helpful to choose a cue. You can practice after morning coffee in the living room or whenever you’re feeling stressed if you can get yourself to do it then. The more specific you are in describing your cue and developing your plan the more likely you are to develop the practice into a habit. Does this research suggest there is no reason to do a longer practice? Most of the participants in our study were novice meditators or people who had never meditated before, so we don’t know how this would look with people who have a really dedicated meditation practice or are very experienced with meditation. Rigorous research is needed for whether shorter practices have advantages over longer practices, and for whom those advantages may be most pronounced. Also, just like brushing teeth is not a replacement for going to the dentist, this micropractice should not be a replacement for therapy or more intensive mental health care. ___ ©2024 Los Angeles Times.

El Fondo aún no está constituido, el Gobierno muestra poca voluntad para avanzar en este campo\", señaló la Dirección Nacional de esa guerrilla en un comunicado.

    "text": "Feast of the Holy Family: Reflect on the Biblical Vision of the Domestic Church User’s Guide to Sunday, Dec. 31 Sunday, Dec. 31, is the feast of the the Holy Family of Jesus, Mary and Joseph. Mass readings: [Sirach 3:2-6, 12-14](https://bible.usccb.org/bible/sirach/3?2) or [Genesis 15:1-6; 21:1-3](https://bible.usccb.org/bible/genesis/15?1); [Psalm 128:1-2, 3, 4-5](https://bible.usccb.org/bible/psalms/128?1) or [Psalm 105:1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 8-9](https://bible.usccb.org/bible/psalms/105?1); [Colossians 3:12-21 or 3:12-17](https://bible.usccb.org/bible/colossians/3?12) or [Hebrews 11:8, 11-12, 17-19](https://bible.usccb.org/bible/hebrews/11?8); [Luke 2:22-40](https://bible.usccb.org/bible/luke/2?22) or [Luke 2:22, 39-40](https://bible.usccb.org/bible/luke/2?22). Here in the middle of the Christmas Octave, the Church bids us to celebrate the feast of the Holy Family and to reflect on the biblical vision of family. Let us consider the family and marriage along three lines: structure, struggles and strategy. Structure: All through the readings for today’s Mass we are instructed on the basic form, the basic structure of the family. In these passages we see the family includes a father in honor over his children and a wife and mother who is supportive of her husband. The husband clings to his wife, preserving union with her and the children. He also supports, loves and encourages his wife and confirms her authority over the children. Children are to honor and obey their parents as the parents instruct and admonish their children, not in a way that badgers or discourages them, but encourages them and builds them up. Indeed, the whole family structure is ordered to helping children advance in wisdom and age and in favor before God and man. Struggles: This picture is, sadly, rare. It is clear that the family is in crisis today, and it is also clear that it is children who suffer the most. The modern Western world displays a mentality that is both deeply flawed and gravely harmful to children. This includes sins such as cohabitation, fornication, abortion, adultery, homosexual acts, pornography, the sexualization of children and the sexual abuse of children. Add to this the widespread acceptance of contraception, which has facilitated the illusion of sex without consequences and promoted the lie that there is no necessary connection between children and sexual relations, of the necessity of marriage. The rebellion of many adults against the plan and order of God has caused endless grief and hardship and created a culture that is poisonous to the family, the dignity of the individual and the proper raising and blessing of children. Strategy: What are we to do? Preach the word! Whatever the sins of this present generation (and there are many), we must be prepared to unambiguously repropose the wisdom of God’s word. We cannot hesitate to announce God’s plan for sexuality, marriage and family. Our strategic proclamation must include certain key elements. There must be no sex before marriage, ever, under any circumstances. There are no exceptions to this. Children deserve and have the right to expect two parents, a father and mother, committed to each other until death do them part. Anything short of this is a grave injustice to children and a mortal sin before God. We must return to a vision that marriage is about what is best for children, not adults. Married couples must learn to work out their differences (as was done in the past) and not resort to divorce, which offends God (Malachi 2:16). We must restore the understanding that the needs of children far outweigh the preferences, “rights” and needs of adults. Whatever personal failings of any of us in this present evil age (Galatians 1:4), our strategy must be to preach the undiluted plan of God for sexuality, marriage and family to our children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. We must not allow any personal shame for our shortcomings to silence what God’s word teaches because God has a holy plan for marriage and family. Holy Family, pray for us! - Keywords: [feast of the holy family](https://www.ncregister.com/tag/feast-of-the-holy-family) [holy family](https://www.ncregister.com/tag/holy-family) [the holy family](https://www.ncregister.com/tag/the-holy-family) [church teaching on marriage and family](https://www.ncregister.com/tag/church-teaching-on-marriage-and-family)",
