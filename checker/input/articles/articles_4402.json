    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Walker County, Georgia from 1901-2000 was 40.9. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Walker County, Georgia experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Walker County, Georgia history.",

    "text": "By Ricardo Brito and Lisandra Paraguassu\nBRASILIA (Reuters) -Brazil has asked Argentina for information about dozens of supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro seeking refuge in the neighboring country to avoid legal consequences for storming Brasilia last year as part of an alleged coup attempt.\nBrazilian police officials said the request lodged on Monday was a precursor to possible extradition requests.\nOn Jan. 8, 2023, a week after leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva took office, thousands of demonstrators stormed Congress, the Supreme Court and the presidential palace in a rampage that some expected would create chaos justifying a military coup to overturn Lula's election.\nFederal police officials told Reuters they believe between 50 and 100 Bolsonaro supporters charged with vandalism and insurrection had fled to Argentina after right-winger Javier Milei took office in December.\nMost of the fugitives were tried and convicted by the Supreme Court and face harsh sentences, including up to 17 years in prison for plotting a coup d'etat, said a senior police officer involved in the investigation.\nBrazil has asked Argentine police to identify their whereabouts and status in the country before deciding to request extraditions, said the police officials. The fugitives had court-ordered restrictions on movement and some wore electronic ankle tags.\n\"Police cooperation will determine how many they are. Based on the information we have so far, we estimate between 50 and 100 of them are in Argentina,\" Federal Police Director General Andrei Rodrigues told reporters on Tuesday.\nBrazil's federal police began investigating the case after right-wing lawmakers, including Bolsonaro's son Eduardo, visited Buenos Aires last month and publicly called on the Argentine government to treat the fugitives as \"political exiles.\"\nBolsonaro's former vice president, Senator Hamilton Mourao, said on social media that they left for Argentina because they did not believe they would get a fair trial in Brazil.\nBrazilian police said they believed most of the missing Bolsonaro supporters have requested political asylum.\nArgentina's National Commission for Refugees said it does not comment on asylum requests.\nPolitical analyst Andre Cesar said the group of Bolsonaro supporters who found an easy escape to neighboring Argentina may be betting on the change in political climate under Milei to get asylum.\n\"Given the initial distancing between the governments of Milei and Lula, I would not be surprised that Milei will at the very least place obstacles to extraditing them,\" said Cesar, partner at Hold Legislative Advisors, a public policy consultancy.\nBrazil seeks right-wing rioters who fled to Milei's Argentina",

Cette manifestation sauvage, à l’appel de plusieurs mouvements d’extrême gauche, rassemblait environ 450 personnes en début de soirée selon la préfecture.

Un magasin d’habillement du centre-ville a également été pris pour cible par des manifestants qui ont brisé la vitrine et emporté des vêtements. Plusieurs poubelles ont également été incendiées, selon la préfecture. La manifestation se poursuivait dans les rues du centre-ville vers 22 heures.\nElle intervient quelques heures après que le Conseil constitutionnel a très largement censuré la loi\nimmigration. Le gouvernement a annoncé qu’il s’apprêtait à promulguer le texte « dans les prochaines heures » pour appliquer les premières mesures « dès ce week-end ».

    "title": "Prominent Jesuit: The Society of Jesus is in ‘profound decline’",
    "text": "ACI Prensa Staff, May 24, 2024 / 10:31 am (CNA). Father Julio Fernández Techera, a Jesuit priest and rector of the Catholic University of Uruguay, has written a widely circulated, critical essay about the Society of Jesus warning that the order, founded by St. Ignatius of Loyola in 1534, is in “deep decline.” The essay by the 57-year-old priest is titled “Ad Usum Nostrorum III” (“For Our Use III”) addressed to his Jesuit brothers. The document, which originally circulated within the Society of Jesus, was recently published by the Spanish journalist Francisco José Fernández de la Cigoña on his blog on [Infovaticana](https://infovaticana.com/blogs/cigona/un-documento-extraordinario-de-un-jesuita-que-tambien-lo-parece/). This is the third document in a series that Fernández began in 2022 when he wrote his initial essay (“Ad Usum Nostrorum”), noting that for a long time he has felt dissatisfied with the situation in the Society of Jesus while making it clear that he is not going through a vocational crisis nor is he thinking about leaving. He published the second essay a year later, in April 2023. In that text he expressed his appreciation for the many responses he received, also from young Jesuits, and even from some who didn’t agree with him but thanked him for the opportunity to debate and propose a revision of the order. The third essay by Fernández is dated April 22. The new text has the subtitle “Some Considerations about the ‘De Statu Societatis 2023’ (‘On the State of the Society 2023’),” in reference to [the general report](https://noticias.jesuitas.pe/2023/08/03/de-statu-societatis-informe-general-de-la-compania-en-el-mundo/) produced by the superior general of the Society of Jesus, in this case the Venezuelan priest [Arturo Sosa](https://www.aciprensa.com/noticias/76979/superior-de-jesuitas-insiste-en-negar-la-existencia-del-diablo), in collaboration with the procurators (who assess the state of the order), who met in May of last year in Loyola, Spain. Recent sex abuse scandals “The society is experiencing very worrying situations that seem not to have been addressed in the Congregation of Procurators and that do not appear clearly and are not taken up in the ‘De Statu’ report. To give some examples, in December of 2022 we learned about what an Italian Jesuit called the ‘Rupnik Tsunami,’” Fernández noted in his essay. Marko Rupnik is a priest who was expelled from the Society of Jesus in 2023 — accused since 2018 of having [committed serious sexual, spiritual, and psychological abuse](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/256894/two-of-father-rupnik-s-alleged-victims-speak-publicly-for-the-first-time) against at least 20 women in the Loyola Community that he co-founded in Slovenia — and who [continues to appear as a Jesuit and Vatican consultant ](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/257430/ex-jesuit-alleged-abuser-rupnik-listed-as-consultant-in-2024-pontifical-yearbook)in the 2024 Pontifical Yearbook. Fernández then referred to the “scandal” of sexual abuse against minors “ [committed by some Jesuits in Bolivia](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/254341/new-accusations-of-sexual-abuse-against-jesuits-in-bolivia), and the alleged cover-up by several provincials who were [accused by the prosecutor’s office](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/254502/six-jesuits-reportedly-under-investigation-for-cover-up-of-sexual-abuse-in-bolivia) of that country. We have had to find out about everything through the press and we have not received a single statement or letter from the General Curia explaining what happened or to ask for prayers for the province of Bolivia.” The main Jesuit accused in this case is the late Alfonso Pedrajas, known as “Padre Pica,” [who kept a diary](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/254772/sex-abuse-scandal-in-bolivia-who-had-the-jesuit-priest-s-diary-and-when) about the sexual abuse he committed against more than 80 minors in Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador. A shrinking society Fernández pointed out in his most recent essay that “other urgent issues that were not dealt with clearly and forcefully are: the drop in the number of admissions to the society, which in the West worsens year by year, as well as the high number of members leaving the order.” “Recently a friend told me that 72 novices entered his province in the last 10 years. In the same period, the number of Jesuits who left the society in his province were 71,” he said, adding that “in 2023, 314 novices entered the entire society, and 319 died.” The priest also noted that there are currently 13,995 Jesuits and lamented that “in a few years the society will have disappeared from several European countries and will become insignificant in others in Europe, America, and Oceania.” The only growth is in Africa. [In 2013](https://pastoral.ipl.edu.do/index.php/noticias/207-cuantos-jesuitas-hay-en-el-mundo), there were more than 17,200 Jesuits, which means that in just over 10 years, the Society of Jesus has decreased by more than 3,000 members. For the Uruguayan priest, “the problem is not only that many die and few enter, but also that we do not know how to retain many of those who enter.” “The reason why we do not have vocations is not because of the secularized society, the changing times, and a thousand other excuses. The reason is that these conditions of our time have cowed us, they overwhelm us, and we do not know how to respond to today’s challenges with the drive and creativity of yesterday,” he pointed out. Jesuits currently more akin to a ‘progressive NGO’ According to Fernández, the vision of the general report on the Society of Jesus “could perfectly be the view of the world of a secular think tank, with ties to a left-wing political party or a progressive NGO [nongovernmental organization].” “One does not find in that [evaluation] any of the supernatural or transcendent outlook that would be expected from a religious, apostolic, and priestly order,” he lamented. “There are many signs in the current life of Jesuit ministries, in the documents that are published and the guidelines that are given, that give the impression that we are in an NGO and not in a religious order,” Fernandez pointed out. In ‘deep decline’ As Fernández sees it, the Society of Jesus “is in deep decline. It doesn’t know it, or it doesn’t want to know it, which is the same thing. It wants to believe that this is the situation of all the other realities of the Church that surround it and that therefore it is what it should be.” In his opinion, the society’s leadership “fears that if it speaks clearly to the entire order, its members will suffer and become discouraged. The leaders “prefer to maintain the fiction that things are going well rather than risk recognizing the religious and apostolic decline of the society.” Regarding the Jesuits’ 2023 general report, Fernández pointed out that “in this entire long document of more than 24,000 words, the word ‘priest’ never appears and only twice ‘priesthood,’ although only to make a reference distinguishing between priesthood in the society and the diocesan priesthood.” “I think our attitude is suicidal: We want vocations for the priesthood in the society, but we don’t want to talk about being priests,” he pointed out. Toward the end of the essay, Fernández recalls that the Jesuits “have a wonderful and necessary charism for the Church, a religious, apostolic, and priestly charism. We have to recover it and live it with passion, boldness, and generosity.” “To achieve this it is necessary to speak more freely, express clearly what we experience and think and stop being politically correct.” In conclusion, Fernández expresses his prayer that God “would grant us in this time a living hope to believe that if we put ourselves in his hands and are faithful, we can still rise again and once again be a great service to his Church.” ACI Prensa, CNA’s Spanish-language news partner, contacted the General Curia of the Jesuits in Rome to request its impressions of Fernandez’s essay. As of publication of this article, no response has been received. History of apostolic visits In a piece published in March 2022, [the late Cardinal](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/253312/breaking-cardinal-george-pell-dies-at-81) George Pell, [under the pseudonym Demos](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/253345/cardinal-pell-authored-controversial-memo-critical-of-pope-francis-journalist-reveals), suggested conducting an apostolic visit or investigation into the Society of Jesus. The early 1980s was the last time the Jesuits were investigated. At that time, Pope John Paul II personally intervened in the governance of the society, removing Father Pedro Arrupe from his position as superior general. This story was first published by ACI Prensa, CNA’s Spanish-language news partner. It has been translated and adapted by CNA. ",

Essere in cammino per la pace è cercare i volti, la carne, le storie degli ultimi, piangere insieme a chi piange le vittime innocenti della terza guerra mondiale a pezzi»: raccontano di un’urgenza che parte dal basso, di un movimento che attraversa generazioni e religioni, che cresce con il crescere dei conflitti, le parole con cui Giuseppina Nosè, tra i coordinatori del Tavolo del bene comune della Diocesi, ci illustra il significato della Marcia della Pace che torna anche quest’anno ad attraversare il centro cittadino nell’ultima domenica di gennaio.\nL’appuntamento è il 28 alle 15 in piazza Martiri di Belfiore a soli tre mesi dall’ultimo corteo silenzioso, una prossimità temporale che è specchio «di questi tempi che stiamo attraversando - conferma Matteo Amati, direttore della Caritas e coordinatore del Tavolo del bene comune - che richiedono di alzare sempre più spesso l’attenzione sulle guerre note e su tutte quelle che hanno meno visibilità. Al punto che in Diocesi è stata creata una vera e propria equipe, che vede in prima fila Andrea Catalfamo, per organizzare eventi per la pace».\nI volti della pace\nIl titolo della Marcia della Pace mantovana di quest’anno sarà “I volti della pace”. Perché «la nostra coscienza è richiamata a posare lo sguardo innanzitutto sui volti delle persone travolte dalla violenza». Perché «stare dalla parte delle vittime dovrebbe essere il criterio più grande di discernimento e di giudizio politico».\nPerché la costruzione della pace può avere molti volti: quello del medico nell’ospedale da campo, del volontario che soccorre dopo una catastrofe naturale, del marinaio che salva il naufrago o dell’obiettore che rifiuta la violenza. Ma sono anche i volti di tutti coloro che torneranno in piazza «perché la pace - conclude Amati - la si costruisce ogni giorno, partendo dai nostri gesti di vicinanza e prossimità».\nUna rete trasversale\nLanciata dal Tavolo del bene comune della Diocesi, alla marcia hanno già aderito l'Agesci, il Cngei, Amnesty International (Gruppo Italia 79), Azione Cattolica, la Comunità Bahà'ì, il gruppo “In silenzio per la pace”, Mantova per la pace, la Comunità Laudato Sì di Mantova, Fridays for future, il Club delle Tre Età e l’Agorà delle religioni. Associazioni cattoliche e laiche unite dalla necessità di condividere un momento pubblico per le strade della nostra città proponendo spunti di riflessione lungo il cammino che raggiungerà piazza Sordello a tappe. «Sarà un’occasione ulteriore - anticipa Claudio Morselli di Mantova per la pace - per denunciare situazioni terrificanti, veri e propri massacri in atto». Sarà un’opportunità in più «per sensibilizzare _ conclude don Simone Bignotti dell’Agorà delle religioni che riunisce più confessioni - e lanciare un messaggio, uniti nel dolore e nella compassione per le vittime di tutte le guerre».\nUn mese di cortei in tutta Italia\nL’invito è partito dalla Caritas Italiana, insieme all’Ufficio Cei di Pastorale Sociale e del Lavoro e a diverse associazioni e movimenti, per mobilitare donne e uomini «affinché siano autentici architetti e artigiani di pace e di fraternità». Hanno costruito un percorso che ha preso il via il 16 novembre a Roma con il convegno “A 60 anni dalla Pacem in Terris: non c’è pace senza perdono”, che è stata la prima tappa di un cammino con al centro la 56ª Marcia nazionale per la Pace che si è tenuta a Gorizia il 31 dicembre. Titolo: “Intelligenze artificiali e pace”, dal tema del messaggio di papa Francesco per la Giornata mondiale della pace celebrata il primo giorno dell’anno. E come quei sassi piatti che se lanciati bene a filo sugli specchi d’acqua sono capaci di innescare e moltiplicare piccole onde concentriche, l’invito ha avuto un effetto moltiplicatore su tutto il territorio nazionale dove per l’intero mese di gennaio saranno organizzare marce per la pace. Tra loro anche Mantova che, come da tradizione, scenderà in corteo nel pomeriggio dell’ultima domenica di gennaio con “I volti della pace”.",
