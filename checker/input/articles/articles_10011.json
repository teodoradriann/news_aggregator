Last season, the Rockets blanked the Oil Kings at Rogers Place on February 24, 2023 by a 4-0 score. The Rockets goals were supplied by Dylan Wightman(2), former Oil King Carson Golder and Trae Johnson. Talyn Boyko stopped all 27 shots he faced in the Rockets cage while Logan Cunningham turned away 36 of the 40 shots sent his direction. The Oil Kings last visit to Prospera Place was 1,501 days ago on November 26, 2019 a game in which they secured a 1-0 win via the shootout. Sebastian Cossa, 21 saves, and Roman Basran, 27 saves, were the two goalies of record to pick up the rare double shutout. Dylan Guenther scored the lone goal in the shootout. The Oil Kings and Rockets have met 27 times total in the regular season with eight of those games being decided in the shootout with both teams having four wins apiece in the skills competition. Coming In The Oil Kings come in riding a six-game point streak (5-0-1-0) and have back-to-back wins following a 3-1 win Wednesday night in Kamloops. Landon Hanson opened the scoring for Edmonton with a beautiful coast-to-coast rush late in the first period while Gracyn Sawchyn, who now has at least a point in all four games as an Oil King, scored a pair of goals setup by Ty Nash. Kolby Hay, playing in his 100th career WHL game and first in his virtual hometown of Kamloops, came within 90 seconds of picking up a shutout but still finished the night as the game’s first start after stopping 36 of 37 shots for his fifth consecutive victory in the Edmonton crease. The Rockets come in having won two straight games and four of their last five after a wild 7-6 win over the Calgary Hitmen on Saturday. Since November 21, 2023 the Rockets hold a record of 10-4-0-0. Their last five games have all been decided by two goals or less.

    "text": "In Russia, two poets heavily sentenced for a text hostile to the offensive in Ukraine Up to seven years in prison for words. On Thursday, December 28, a Moscow court sentenced two men to long sentences for reciting verses against the Ukrainian offensive during a protest last year. Russian poets Artyom Kamardin (L) and Yegor Shtovba (R) stand inside the glass cage of the defendants during the announcement of the verdict at the Moscow court on December 28, 2023. AFP - ALEXANDER NEMENOV By: RFI Follow Advertising Read More The repression of dissenting voices in Russia continues unabated at the end of the year. According to the Russian NGO OVD-Info, nearly 20,000 Russians have been arrested since the beginning of the conflict in Ukraine for protesting against the Kremlin's policies. The NGO Memorial lists 633 political prisoners behind bars. The latest victims are two Russian poets who took part in a reading against the war in Ukraine, sentenced by a Moscow court to five-and-a-half and seven years in prison. Both men were convicted of inciting hatred against members of armed groups in Donbass and \"publicly calling to commit activities against state security\". Their fault? Participating in a public poetry reading in Moscow, near the statue of the poet Mayakovsky, a traditional gathering place for opponents of the government and dissidents since Soviet times. One of them claims to have been raped during his arrest At the event, 33-year-old Artyom Kamardin, who received the heaviest sentence, recited a poem hostile to pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. Like Yegor Shtovba, 23, who was sentenced to 5 2022/ years, he was arrested in September , the day after the public reading. During the search of his home, he claimed to have been beaten and raped with a dumbbell by police officers. His wife was also allegedly ill-treated by the police. Alexandra Popova, who was present in court for the sentencing, told AFP she regretted a \"very severe\" sentence, \"for poetry, a non-violent offence\". \"If we had normal courts, this situation would not exist,\" she told reporters, before being taken away by police. Today, opposition leader Ksenia Fadeeva, a close associate of Alexei Navalny, must also be determined her fate. The 2020-year-old, who was elected in September 10 to the city council of Tomsk in Siberia and who was the head of the local office of Alexei Navalny's Anti-Corruption Fund, was on trial for extremism. On Thursday, the prosecutor asked for and a half years in prison.

    "text": "News Briefs St. Louis doctor sentenced to 35 months in federal prison for Medicaid and Medicare fraud St. Louis Public Radio | By Jeremy D. Goodwin Published February 20, 2025 at 4:15 PM CST Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email\nEvie Hemphill / St. Louis Public Radio Dr. Sonny Saggar, photographed at St. Louis Public Radio for a 2018 interview, received a 35-month sentence in federal prison and was ordered to repay nearly $750,000 in fraudulent charges to Medicare and Missouri Medicaid. St. Louis physician Sonny Saggar is facing 35 months in federal prison and an order to repay $742,528 for defrauding Medicare and Missouri Medicaid, charges he admitted to in court last year.\nU.S. District Judge Stephen R. Clark sentenced Saggar on Wednesday.\nSaggar, 57, testified in August that he let assistant physicians treat patients and then billed Medicaid as if he had seen the patients personally – even when he was out of town during the office visits.\nMissouri law requires doctors to supervise assistant physicians closely.\n“Doctors are expected to follow a certain code of conduct and obey the laws and regulations put in place to protect their clients,” Michael Davis, DEA St. Louis Division special agent in charge, said in a statement.\n“Our investigation shows that Dr. Saggar broke with protocol and endangered lives with his negligence. As a result of his misconduct, he was arrested, surrendered his DEA Certificate of Registration, can no longer prescribe controlled substances, and faces nearly three years in federal prison,” Davis added.\nSaggar testified that he hired assistant physicians at St. Louis General Hospital locations in St. Louis and Creve Coeur between 2018 and 2023 but did not properly train them or oversee their decisions about patient care. He also recruited other physicians to falsely claim they were overseeing the assistants, according to the judge.\nSaggar, a native of England, took public stands in favor of gun control and held various leadership positions with St. Louis health care facilities in addition to running the St. Louis General Hospital locations, as owner of North City Urgent Care and CEO of the distressed St. Alexius Hospital in south St. Louis.\nOffice manager Renita Barringer pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy and faces sentencing next month.",

    "text": "If you’ve felt like this has been a historically mild December, you’d be right. Osoyoos set a new temperature record for Dec. 28, with a balmy 6.9 C. According to Environment Canada’s weather summaries, the old record for this day was 6.2 C, set in 1994. Records in this area have been kept since 1954. In Penticton, on Dec. 28, it’s sitting at 7 C. Every day of December hovered around 5 C. Last year, Okanagan Lake was frozen over at the shoreline. This year, it looks like spring. Even Kevin, the famous broken-winged goose is finding it balmy. Old School Penticton posted a picture of Kevin hanging out with some feathered friends and he captioned the photo, “The King & Queen have their very own island. It ain’t Hawaii, but we’ve all been invited to the Lūʻau. It’s B.Y.O.P. (Bring Your Own Pineapple).” Penticton Golf and Country Club is still open, with many members able to hit the greens every day of this month. According to the weather forecasts, the South Okanagan will finish out 2023 a little colder but it won’t dip below 0 C during the day. Jan. 1, New Year’s Day looks to be great weather to take the Polar Bear Dip. Daytime temperatures will be around 1 C. [READ MORE: Snow for Xmas Day?
