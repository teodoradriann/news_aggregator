    "title": "Judicial board reprimands Minnesota judge who tried to bar formerly incarcerated felons from voting",
    "text": "The Minnesota Board on Judicial Standards reprimanded a rural central Minnesota judge who tried to issue orders barring individuals from voting in the fall election because they were on probation related to felony convictions, despite a new state law that restores their voting rights as long as they're no longer incarcerated.\nThe reprimand, issued Thursday , said Judge Matthew Quinn \"did not comply with, uphold, or apply Minnesota Statutes.\"\n\"Instead, acting on his own initiative, he deliberately and intentionally decided to make the amended voting eligibility statute inapplicable to defendants on probation in felony cases by … declaring it unconstitutional,\" reads the reprimand.\nIn October, Quinn declared that law \"unconstitutional\" in a series of unexpected supplemental sentencing orders for at least six individuals on probation with felony convictions. In the identical orders, he said they are prohibited from \"registering to vote, or voting, or attempting to vote.\"\n\"To do so is a criminal act which can be investigated, charged, and prosecuted in the normal course,\" he wrote at the time.\nThe move prompted outrage from DFL officials , who said it flew in the face of the law intended to restore voting rights for more than 55,000 individuals. The state Court of Appeals ruled in November that Quinn exceeded his authority when he tried to block them from voting in the upcoming election.\nThe Board on Judicial Standards also received a complaint concerning Quinn's conduct and investigated the complaint. In early June, the Board issued a notice of proposed public reprimand and conditions to Quinn, who waived his right to demand a formal complaint and public hearing. Their public reprimand is final.\n\"Judge Quinn's probation sentencing orders unfairly limited defendants' voting rights, ruling that the Minnesota Constitution prohibited them from voting while on probation, and threatening prosecution or imposition of stayed prison time if they attempted to exercise their voting rights restored under the amended law,\" read the reprimand.\nQuinn, appointed to the court by former DFL Gov. Mark Dayton in 2017, was issued a separate public reprimand from the Minnesota Board on Judicial Standards in 2021 for liking posts on Facebook endorsing candidates for office, as well as the official page for former President Donald Trump and numerous posts supporting his campaign. He was also tagged in photos participating in a Trump boat parade.",

It has always been you,” Puth wrote in an Instagram post alongside a slideshow of photos from their special day.\\nThe lovebirds – who both grew up in New Jersey – have been engaged since September 2023.\\n\\nHere’s what we know about Charlie Puth’s new wifey:\\nWho are Brooke Sansone’s parents?\\n\\nBrooke Sansone, who also goes by the nickname Brookie, was born to her parents, Paul Sansone Jr and Chris Sansone. According to The Statesman, her father is an auto dealer and has been married to his wife for over 33 years.\\nPuth, 32, has said that their families have been intertwined for years. “I mean, she grew up one town over from me in New Jersey, and my parents know her parents,” he told People magazine. “Her dad has been best friends with my dad since the third grade, so it’s kind of like I’m just gaining another family right away, even before the wedding. And they’ve also known me before the fame, before everything, so I can’t think of a better situation, quite frankly.”\\nWhere did Brooke Sansone go to university?\\n\\nThe 25-year-old is a marketing graduate. According to her LinkedIn profile, she obtained a bachelor of science in marketing, in 2021.\\n\\nBefore that, she studied at Red Bank Catholic High School, where she was the president of the “hot topics club” and played girl’s lacrosse.\\nWhat does Brooke Sansone do for work?\\n\\nWhile her partner is a multimillionaire singer, Sansone has a totally different career path.\\n\\nPer her LinkedIn page, she is currently a digital marketing and PR coordinator at Butter and Eggs Interiors in New York. She’s also worked at companies like Hyer Home in Charleston and was an influencer for RewardStyle.\\nHow did Brooke Sansone meet Charlie Puth?\\n\\nPuth and Sansone go way back. During an interview on SiriusXM’s The Howard Stern Show, the “We Don’t Talk Anymore” musician said that they grew up together as friends. “ [She’s] someone that I grew up with,” he said. “As my life gets more turbulent and I travel everywhere, it’s really nice to have someone close to you that you’ve known for a very long time … and I would assume that when times inevitably are hard in the future – because what is life without valleys and peaks – she would be there for me as well.”\\nIt seems like Sansone also helps to keep Puth grounded. “Honestly, I get so scared of people now, like, I can’t really walk anywhere for whatever reason, and I think the more that happens, the more I just want to retreat to someone that I’ve known for a long time. I’m not really interested in going out like I used to and being crazy,” he added.\\nWhen did Brooke Sansone and Charlie Puth get engaged?\\n\\nThe pair reportedly started dating at some point in 2022. The “One Call Away” singer announced their engagement in an Instagram post he shared in September 2023.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nView this post on Instagram\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA post shared by Charlie Puth (@charlieputh)\\n\\n\\n\\n“I flew to New York to ask my best friend to marry me, and she said yes. I am the happiest, best version of myself and it is all because of you Brookie. I love you endlessly forever and ever and ever,” he wrote.\\nWho else has Charlie Puth dated?\\n\\nBefore finding his happily ever after with Sansone, Puth was romantically linked to a number of celebs including singer Charlotte Lawrence, Prodigal Son actress Halston Sage, Disney star Danielle Campbell, model Bella Thorne, and Rare Beauty founder Selena Gomez, per Cosmopolitan.\\n",

    "text": "Medida será adotada por questões de segurança, alerta Estado; restante da programação da virada está confirmada mesmo com precipitações (Maurício Vieira / Hoje em Dia) O espetáculo de luzes com 300 drones na noite de Réveillon, na Praça da Liberdade, em Belo Horizonte, poderá ser cancelado em caso de temporal. A medida de segurança será adotada se chuvas fortes atingirem a região Centro-Sul da capital, onde fica o cartão-postal. A informação foi divulgada nesta sexta-feira (29) pela Secretaria de Estado de Cultura e Turismo (Secult). Nesta semana, a Defesa Civil alertou que o fim de ano na metrópole poderá ser marcado por grandes volumes de precipitações, acompanhadas por raios e rajadas de ventos. A previsão indica que o risco de chuva é maior justamente no dia 1º. Em caso de cancelamento do show de drones, o público será avisado pelo sistema de som da praça. Porém, o restante da programação está confirmado, mesmo com chuva. O evento seguirá com um espetáculo maior de luzes, lasers e projeções à meia-noite. Os drones vieram diretamente de Dubai, nos Emirados Árabes Unidos. Segundo a Secult, eles podem voar com uma garoa fina e vento de até 7 m/s. A apresentação deve durar 15 minutos, de 0h à 0h15. A ideia é que os drones formem palavras e imagens que remetam a Minas Gerais. No ano passado, a Virada da Liberdade contou com uma queima de fogos. Para este Réveillon, a expectativa é que a quantidade dobre - os fogos são silenciosos. O investimento também aumentou. Ao todo, o Estado deve investir cerca de R$ 500 mil. No evento anterior foram R$ 400 mil. Previsão do tempo Entre esta sexta (29) e a próxima segunda-feira (1), a atuação de áreas de instabilidades atmosféricas começam a ganhar força e provocar chuvas fortes em BH. O volume de precipitações pode chegar a 130 milímetros (mm), de acordo com a Defesa Civil. O órgão informou que realizará durante todos os dias o monitoramento das condições climáticas que podem gerar riscos à população. *Estagiário sob supervisão de Renato Fonseca Leia mais: [Saída para o ano novo movimenta Rodoviária de BH; 32 mil pessoas são esperadas nesta sexta](https://www.hojeemdia.com.br/minas/saida-para-o-ano-novo-movimenta-rodoviaria-de-bh-32-mil-pessoas-s-o-esperadas-nesta-sexta-1.994181) [Pagamento do IPVA 2024 pode ser feito a partir de 1º de janeiro; veja como consultar valores](https://www.hojeemdia.com.br/minas/pagamento-do-ipva-2024-pode-ser-feito-a-partir-de-1-de-janeiro-veja-como-consultar-valores-1.994180)",

    "text": "Enlarge image Damascus International Airport Photo: YOUSSEF BADAWI / EPA-EFE Attacks in the dark: Israel has again attacked targets near the capital Damascus, according to Syrian state media and the Ministry of Defense. Air defenses are targeting \"enemy targets\" near the city, the state news agency Sana said on Thursday. Syrian state television also reported Israeli attacks from the Damascus area. According to the Syrian Defense Ministry, the attacks were carried out from the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. The agency did not report any casualties of the shelling. According to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the strikes targeted an air defense position in the southern Syrian province of Suweida, as well as the area around Damascus International Airport. The airport had only reopened a day earlier – after being closed for several weeks as a result of an earlier Israeli airstrike at the end of November. In October, the airports in Damascus and Aleppo in northwestern Syria had already been forced to suspend operations twice following Israeli air strikes. In general, Israel rarely comments on individual attacks in Syria. However, it has repeatedly stressed that it will not allow its arch-enemy Iran to expand its presence in Syria. Tehran is allied with Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad. Since the beginning of the Syrian civil war in 2011, Israel has shelled the neighboring country from the air hundreds of times. The attacks are directed in particular against the Iranian-backed Lebanese Hezbollah militia, but also against positions of the Syrian army. Since the start of the war against the Hezbollah-allied radical Islamic Palestinian organization Hamas nearly two months ago, Israel has intensified airstrikes in Syria. dop/AFP",

Síguenos] Un total de 2.193.782,32 euros tenía presupuestado la Junta de Andalucía para la ampliación y reforma del IES Lola Flores, un instituto que lleva 14 años con aulas prefabricadas, barracones prohibidos por la legislación educativa actual. Un dinero que no se ha invertido en las mejoras de un centro que ya ha vivido dos jornadas de protesta en la calle desde que empezara el presente curso escolar. \"Se han perdido 2,2 millones de euros que estaban destinados a este instituto\", ha manifestado José Antonio Díaz, portavoz del PSOE en Jerez. \"Queremos denunciar que se ha perdido una gran oportunidad para mejorar las infraestructuras educativas y las instalaciones por la negligencia del Partido Popular, que no da soluciones ni responde a la comunidad educativa. Es una dejación de funciones\", ha añadido Díaz. El IES Lola Flores no es el único centro dentro de las actuaciones programadas por la Junta de Andalucía. El CEIP La Barca de la Florida (1.500.000 euros), el IES Sofía (1.319.297,07), el CEEE Nuestra Señora de la Merced (2.032.609,10) y el CEEE Sordos (1.579.948,10) también tenían aprobadas partidas para reformas y ampliaciones por encima de los 500.000 euros. José Antonio Díaz entiende que \"ya toca que se invierta en el IES Lola Flores. El gobierno del señor Moreno Bonilla y de la alcaldesa, que dijo que iba a solucionar todos los problemas de Jerez, se ha visto, después de seis años del gobierno en La Junta y de un año y medio en el ayuntamiento de Jerez, que no soluciona los problemas estructurales de Jerez\". \"Los pilares básicos de los servicios públicos están siendo atentados por el Partido Popular. Lo hemos visto en la sanidad, en la dependencia, pero también en la educación, con barracones que no dignifican al alumnado\", ha destacado el portavoz socialista.",
