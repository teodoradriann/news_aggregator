    "text": "Valentina Raffio\nBarcelona 01 NOV 2024 8:24 Actualizada 01 NOV 2024 8:57 La DANA ha vuelto a activarse este viernes desde primera hora de la mañana de este viernes y, según los pronósticos más actualizados, mantiene en alerta a al menos cinco comunidades autónomas. Esta mañana la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (AEMET) ha activado una alerta roja para el litoral de Huelva , donde se podrían dar acumulaciones de más de 140 litros por metro cuadrado en tan solo unas horas. En localidades como Cartaya ya se han acumulado más de 117 litros por metro cuadrado en menos de tres horas, de los cuales 70 en un hora. También se están registrando importantes trombas marinas asociadas a este evento. Las autoridades piden a los ciudadanos de la zona extremar precauciones .\nPara este viernes también hay activadas varias alertas amarillas en el sur de Cataluña, el norte de la Comunitat Valenciana y en Mallorca y Menorca ante el riesgo de que la DANA vuelva a causar lluvias torrenciales en estas zonas. En Catalunya, el aviso naranja se concentra en las comarcas del Montsià y Baix Ebre, que acumulan dos días consecutivos de lluvias extremas, ante la previsión de que caigan más de 100 litros por metro cuadrado durante esta jornada. También se activa una alerta amarilla en el litoral y prelitoral de Barcelona de cara a toda la jornada del viernes ante la previsión de fuertes lluvias que podrían llegar acompañadas de tormenta.\nEn las próximas horas preocupa la evolución de esta DANA en la Comunidad Valenciana . Las imágenes por radar muestran la formación de un frente muy cargado de lluvias delante de las costas de Castellón, una zona que este jueves ya vivió una jornada en alerta roja y sufrió varias inundaciones. En la zona más afectada por el paso de este temporal extremo, en Valencia, para este viernes se ha activado una alerta amarilla y se esperan acumulaciones de entre 20 y 60 litros por metro cuadrado en algunos puntos.\nLa DANA se extenderá al fin de semana y mantendrá encendidas varias alertas naranjas\nCinco comunidades en alerta Además de las alertas rojas y naranjas activadas para este viernes, la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología también ha activado decenas de avisos de nivel amarillo en Andalucía, Baleares, Cataluña, Extremadura y Comunidad Valenciana, ya que las lluvias van a ser también muy fuertes en grandes áreas de estas regiones y en muchos puntos se van a acumular hasta 60 litros por metro cuadrado en doce horas. \"Vamos a lanzar un mensaje muy claro y lo vamos a dejar fijado. La emergencia meteorológica no ha finalizado. La DANA sigue sobre España\", afirman desde la entidad ante la previsión de que estas lluvias torrenciales sigan.\nLos modelos aún se muestran inciertos sobre cómo evolucionará esta DANA en los próximos días. Este episodio empezó ya el fin de semana pasado, se ha extendido durante todo esta semana y seguramente continuará durante todo el puente de Todos los Santos y el fin de semana. A partir de ahí, aún no está muy claro cuándo acabarán definitivamente estas lluvias. Por ahora, todo apunta a que a principios de la semana que viene se debilitarán mucho y probablemente se vayan apaciguando con el tiempo. Aun así, dada la evolución errática de este fenómeno, aún es pronto para ponerle fecha final a este episodio que ha causado tantas lluvias torrenciales.\nTEMAS",

    "text": "Blast of freezing air will have many in the South shivering to end 2023\nA frost and freeze risk will return to parts of the South, including Florida, to end the year, as the same storm expected to produce snowflakes in the Tennessee Valley ushers in chilly air.\nFolks headed South for warmth over the holidays will experience a polar plunge instead, with temperatures dropping below freezing in areas and snow possible in some areas.\nFollowing the season's first snowflakes in parts of the South this week, some residents may have to reach for winter jackets as some of the chilliest air of the season moves in through New Year's weekend, say\nAccuWeather meteorologists.\nThe blast of colder air will send temperatures at night below freezing as far south as the Gulf Coast and Florida, raising some agricultural concerns. For those from colder climates spending the holidays in the South, it might be an unwelcome return to the weather they are used to at home.\n\"While this is not expected to be the coldest air the region will see this winter, it will be quite a shock given the recent warmth,\" said AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Adam Douty.\nThat recent warmth, featuring temperatures 5-10 degrees above historical averages in the days around Christmas, was accompanied by locally heavy rain tallying several inches. Fortunately, while the temperature will dip into the weekend, it will be largely dry for outdoor activities, including New Year's Eve celebrations.\nThe exception to that dry forecast will be in portions of the Tennessee Valley and around the Southern Appalachians, where\nsome snow showers can occur into Saturday morning. Except for the highest elevations, any accumulations should be light, representing the season's first snowflakes for many from Middle Tennessee to northern Georgia.\nAccuWeather meteorologists say that the same storm generating the snowflakes will also reinforce the chilly air over the region that will last into the weekend.\n\"The core of the cold will be on Friday and Saturday nights,\" said Douty. \"It is likely that Saturday night will be a little colder in most areas.\"\nTemperatures come dawn Sunday morning in places like\nGainesville and Tallahassee, Florida, will be at or below freezing, with the 20s even likely across interior Georgia and points to the north and east. For parts of the Sunshine State, it will be the first time temperatures have plunged that low this season, threatening some outdoor plants and vegetation.\n\"The frost risk will cover nearly all of northern Florida, about as far south as Ocala,\" added Douty. Fortunately, with the state's citrus crop mainly clustered in the central part of the state, where temperatures should stay above freezing, damage to this important economic staple is not anticipated this time around.\nFor the central and southern part of the peninsula, low temperatures on both days of the weekend will be in the mid- to upper 40s for places like\nOrlando and Tampa, while Fort Myers and Miami will dip into the lower 50s. Such temperatures are about 5-10 degrees below the historical average to close the year.\nDaytime highs in the 60s through the weekend will be several degrees below average and may be a bit on the cooler side for most.\nThe cold snap is likely not to be frigid enough to cause\niguanas to fall out of trees, a uniquely Florida phenomenon that occurs when the mercury is in the lower 40s or below for several hours in the southern part of the peninsula.\nThe iguanas—and many humans—will be happy to know that the chill will be short-lived, as temperatures are forecast to rebound closer to historical averages, and even above, as early as Sunday afternoon and especially through the first week of the new year.\nWant next-level safety, ad-free?

    "text": "United Nations\nPress Conference by Security Council President on Programme of Work for February\nThe war in Gaza will remain a priority focus for the Security Council in February, its President for the month said at a Headquarters press conference today, adding that it will hold meetings on the situations in Ukraine and Myanmar.\nCarolyn Rodrigues-Birkett (Guyana) said that the Council will organize a high-level open debate to examine the dynamic relationship between climate change, food insecurity and conflicts within the context of maintaining international peace and security.\nThe meeting — scheduled on 13 February — will be chaired by the President of Guyana, Mohamed Irfaan Ali, also featuring remarks by United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres; Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Simon Stiell; Deputy Director-General of the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) Beth Bechdol; and a civil society representative.\nThere will be 16 mandated meetings, including on United Nations missions in Iraq, Somalia, Libya, the Central African Republic, Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan. On 22 February, there will be a briefing on the situation in the Middle East, including the question of Palestine. On 15 February, the Council will hold an annual briefing on threats to international peace and security posed by terrorist acts of Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL/Da’esh).\nOn 12 February, the Council is scheduled to renew the mandate of the Panel of Experts assisting the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1591 (2005) concerning the Sudan, she said. The Council will also undertake a field visit to Colombia within the context of resolution 2704 (2023).\nGuyana will promote enhanced transparency, efficiency, effectiveness, and inclusiveness in the Council’s work and commit to adopting a consensus-building approach in full collaboration with all its members, she said. It will also seek to include a gender perspective in meetings.\nAsked about a draft resolution on a ceasefire in Gaza prepared by Algeria, she said that it is being discussed and she intends to adopt a constructive approach to the resolution. Guyana has called for a ceasefire and will continue to do so. “We believe that we should not wait another day for that,” she said, expressing hope for the adoption of that resolution. Asked about an attack against a United States base in Jordan, she said that Guyana is concerned about regional spillovers.\nAsked about a report that Israel has agreed to a ceasefire proposal, she said that she does not have that information. There is a draft resolution being discussed and “we will see how that will progress in light of this new information that you just provided”, she said.\nResponding to a correspondent who pointed out that implementation of the two resolutions on Gaza adopted by the Council is not happening, she said — in her national capacity — that “those two resolutions cannot be fully implemented — and also the provisional measures of the International Court of Justice — unless there’s a ceasefire.”\nOn Ukraine, she said that the date for the meeting is being finalized, but she does not foresee any outcome document at this moment to mark the second anniversary of the Russian invasion.\nOn Myanmar, she said that the Council will hear a report from the special envoy of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).\nResponding to a question about a delay in deploying the Multinational Support Force in Haiti due to a decision by the Nairobi High Court in Kenya, she said that the Council is seized of the matter, noting that Nairobi decided to appeal the court’s decision. In her national capacity, she voiced concern about the growing challenges in Haiti and the dire humanitarian situation. The Caribbean countries that have indicated their participation in the Force are the Bahamas, Antigua and Barbuda, and Jamaica, she added.\nOn the situation in Venezuela, she said that it is not on the Council’s agenda for February, adding — in her national capacity — that Guyana has not requested a meeting on that country.",

An Orbeez gun fires small, colorful, water-absorbing beads.\nOne notable incident occurred on Gloucester Township Day at Veterans Park, where juveniles reportedly used these guns to target animals. Another significant occurrence involved juveniles firing from a moving vehicle at pedestrians on Tuesday. The suspects, five in total, captured their actions on social media.\nToday, Wednesday, at 3 PM, police received additional reports of two males and a female using an Orbeez gun to shoot at unsuspecting pedestrians. This case is currently under investigation.\nIn response to these events, the Gloucester Township Police Department is urging parents and guardians to discuss the potential dangers of these toy guns with their children. Misidentification of these toys as real guns could pose serious safety risks.\nThe police are taking a firm stance on this issue, promising to identify, arrest, and charge those misusing the toys to instill fear or cause disturbance among the residents of Gloucester Township.\nArrest Made in Baltimore Homicide Cases BALTIMORE, MD - Following a detailed investigation into the homicides that occurred on June 2, Baltimore detectives have apprehended Munir Dawan Matin, a 36-year-old Baltimore resident, for his alleged involvement in two separate shootings.\nMatin is accused of the fatal shooting of 32-year-old Terrell Johnson-Smith on June 2, in the 900 block of Pennsylvania Avenue, and the murder of 34-year-old Jarmal Harrid on the same day, in the 500 block of West Mulberry Street.\nThe arrest occurred on June 10, when the Warrant Apprehension Task Force located and detained Matin in the 400 block of Fallsway. He was subsequently transported to the Central Booking Intake Facility, facing two counts of first-degree murder among other charges.\nThis arrest follows an earlier report of gunshots on June 2 around 5:02 PM, where police were alerted to the 900 block of Pennsylvania Avenue by both gunshots and a ShotSpotter activation. At the scene, they found a male victim, later identified as Johnson-Smith, with multiple gunshot wounds. Despite immediate medical attention, he was pronounced dead at the hospital.\nMonessen Couple Arrested for Child Endangerment MONESSEN, PA - A couple from Monessen has been arrested following the discovery of their children living in severely neglected conditions. The Monessen Police, in collaboration with the Westmoreland County District Attorney's Office, charged Jerimiah Roberts and Felicia Dugan with endangering the welfare of children, a felony.\nThe investigation began on June 10 when police were called to the couple's residence on Park Manor for a welfare check on two small children. Upon arrival, officers spoke with Roberts at the door, who stated that the children were staying at a relative's house and that Dugan was asleep on the couch.\nPolice subsequently made contact with Dugan, who led them to an upstairs bedroom where the children were found sleeping. The conditions in the bedroom were appalling, with feces and old food on the floor, along with flies and fleas. The two-year-old children appeared to have bite marks on their bodies and faces and were visibly dirty.\nA witness informed police that Dugan frequently locked the children in the bedroom to prevent them from roaming around the house.\nFollowing these discoveries, both Roberts and Dugan were arraigned and placed in the Westmoreland County Prison.\nThree Arrested in Kent County Drug Bust DOVER, DE - Delaware State Police have arrested three men from Magnolia, Delaware, following a prolonged drug investigation in Kent County. The individuals arrested include 19-year-old Algahgaa Ata, 23-year-old Maddyan Ata, and 52-year-old Khaled Ata, all facing multiple charges related to drug dealing.\nThe investigation, which began in November 2023, was conducted by the Kent County Drug Unit and Delaware Alcohol and Tobacco Enforcement (DATE). The focus was on three businesses: Ali Baba Smoke Shop and Ali Baba 2 Smoke Shop in Dover, and Liberty Happy Gas Station in Magnolia. These locations were suspected of being involved in large-scale drug distribution.\nOn June 11, detectives stopped a vehicle driven by M. Ata near Magnolia. A search of his car revealed a loaded handgun, about 17 grams of marijuana, and $5,915 in cash believed to be drug proceeds.\nSimultaneously, search warrants were executed at the aforementioned businesses and a residence on Ponderosa Drive in Magnolia. A. Ata and K. Ata were apprehended at the Liberty Happy Gas Station. Searches of the properties resulted in the seizure of approximately 1025.32 grams of marijuana and THC products, two handguns, ammunition, drug paraphernalia, and $158,523 in suspected drug proceeds.\nAlgahgaa Ata was taken to Troop 3 for processing, charged, arraigned by Justice of the Peace Court 2, and subsequently released on a $2,000 unsecured bond.\nToms River Mayor Serves Cease and Desist on “Fake News” Page for Slanderous And False Claims \" Fake News\" Outlet with History of Misinformation Pulls Slanderous Posts About Toms River Mayor After Served with Cease & Desist\nJCEN, a fire and emergency scanner news page in Ocean County, made several posts, and the mayor claims that they are defamatory and go beyond fair criticism of a political figure.\nThe letter highlighted the potential legal consequences of these allegations if they are not removed. It stated that the posts qualify as slander per se, which allows for monetary damages without the need to prove reputational harm.\nWhen asked about the page, Rodrick said, \"They're fake news.\"\nIn one post, the page operator falsely claimed with certainty that Mayor Rodrick personally ordered the euthanization of all cats and dogs at the troubled Toms River Animal Shelter. Another post claimed Rodrick was ‘stealing campaign signs.\nBoth claims, Rodrick said, are completely false.\nIn late February, JCEN started another firestorm with a false report claiming that busloads of illegal immigrants were being dropped off in Toms River. A claim debunked by the Ocean County Sheriff’s Department. It was determined that the bus drivers were spending the night at the motel after a long trip.\nRodrick added that it’s not just anonymous Facebook pages using false claims to slander him.\n“The worst part of this is that once credible news outlets like News 12, Patch, and Jersey Shore Online are giving these people an audience without even fact-checking their ridiculous lies,” Rodrick said. “You would think established news outlets would stay out of the political space and maintain neutrality, but they’re simply regurgitating fake news and false claims being made by these people who are hell-bent on burning down Toms River unless their people are in office.”\nState records show that Jersey Shore Online and Toms River Patch each received compensation for campaign advertisements from Mo Hill-aligned political campaigns.\nRodrick said several people showed up at his family’s house over the weekend and stood at the corner for hours.\n“It’s so bizarre,” Rodrick continued. \"It’s also unsettling that my kids and family have to worry about a politically driven mob that seems to have no limits or boundaries.”\nHe said the post even led to people who truly believed he was euthanizing animals to dox him and his wife.\n“They doxed our home address and my wife's and my cell phone numbers. Then they said I had all of the animals at the shelter killed and told people to go to my house. It was a grotesque lie,\" the mayor said.\nRodrick’s letter called for an immediate retraction and removal of the false posts.\nHours after receiving the cease and desist letter, JCEN removed the two posts noted in it. The operators of the page did not make a comment on the matter.\n“We write in regard to the false and defamatory statements made by you and/or the Administrator of the JCEN about Mr. Rodrick on your Facebook Page, JCEN, alleging, without any factual basis, that Mr. Rodick is ordering for the animals at the shelter to be euthanized and speaking in a heartless and crude language, and theft. We hereby demand that you cease and remove the publication of any such statements,” Coronato wrote in the letter.\nA post by JCEN claimed these previously published photos of Rodrick were proof that he was \"Stealing\" campaign signs. Instead, they show Rodrick placing signs on his supported candidate, William Byrne. In a formal cease and desist letter dated June 8, Joseph D. Coronato, Jr., of Coronato Law, has been retained to represent Mayor Daniel T. Rodrick against alleged defamatory statements made by JCEN. The law firm demands immediate removal of all content deemed damaging to Mr. Rodrick’s reputation from their Facebook page.\nThe dispute arises from posts on the JCEN Facebook page, which falsely accused Mr. Rodrick of ordering the euthanization of shelter animals and engaging in theft. The letter refutes these claims, noting Mr. Rodrick's status as an animal lover and his involvement in transferring animals to a better-equipped facility.\nAn incident involving campaign signs was mentioned. Mr. Rodrick was wrongfully accused of stealing \"Bill Byrne for Council\" signs. According to the letter, Mr. Rodrick merely supported Byrne's campaign, not engaged in theft. A photo shared by JCEN clearly shows Rodrick with a handful of signs for his supported candidate.\n“Indeed, these baseless statements were issued maliciously and are intended to embarrass, intimidate, and harass Mr. Rodrick and cause him reputational harm. Mr. Rodrick is an avid animal lover and has two dogs in his family. The conditions at the Toms River Animal Shelter were well below standards at a significant cost to the Township Taxpayers,” Coronato, the former Ocean County Prosecutor, wrote. “Your purposeful dissemination of false and damaging information about Mr. Rodrick is an unfair and unfounded attempt to destroy his reputation and successes as Toms River Mayor. This is unacceptable, and Mr. Rodrick will not stand by while you perpetuate false statements that fit your own political angle.”\nDuring the 2024 GOP primary election, JCEN openly endorsed and supported former Mo Hill running mate Kevin Geoghegan.\n“This page is run by people who want Mo Hill and his team back in office,” Rodrick said. “These posts went beyond political speech and well into slander and libel for categorically false claims. It shows that the former mayor and his team will stop at nothing to get back into office.”\nprevious post Gel Gun Drive-Bys Prompt Police Warning in South Jersey Breaking News Man Murdered Inside Brooklyn Subway Station June 13, 2024 Gel Gun Drive-Bys Prompt Police Warning in South Jersey June 13, 2024 Arrest Made in Baltimore Homicide Cases June 13, 2024 Monessen Couple Arrested for Child Endangerment June 13, 2024 Three Arrested in Kent County Drug Bust June 13, 2024 Toms River Mayor Serves Cease and Desist on “Fake News” Page for Slanderous And False Claims June 13, 2024",

    "title": "Kamala Names Muslim Liaison Who Wore Orange to Support Gitmo Terrorists",
    "text": "After 9/11, the Afghan Muslim immigrant was interrogated by the FBI and asked about her background.\nThere’s an old joke about CBS News bringing out a Marxist to represent the Sandinista position and then Senator John Kerry to also represent the Sandinista position.\nKamala has managed to top that by bringing out Ilan Goldenberg , a career anti-Israel activist who\nadvocated for a deal in which “Hamas would retain some of its military capabilities” as her liaison to the Jewish community.\nAnd now Kamala introduced Nasrina Bargzie, whom Freedom Center Investigates profiled on August 9th as her Muslim liaison .\nThis way, Kamala has a Jewish liaison who hates Israel and a Muslim liaison who hates Israel.\nNasrina Bargzie is a piece of work with a lot of unanswered questions about her background which after September 11 were being asked by the FBI.\nAfter 9/11, Nasrina Bargzie, an Afghan Muslim immigrant, was interviewed by law enforcement over troubling comments on the War on Terror reported by her friends. Bargzie revealed that she had been interrogated by the FBI and “was asked by the agent about her family history and background.”\nShe became a legal fellow at the ACLU and joined its lawfare machine to dismantle our national security defenses against Islamic terrorism. In 2008, she posted about “wearing orange”at the Today Show in solidarity with the Al Qaeda, Taliban and other terrorists being held at Gitmo.\nAnd yes there’s the inevitable Islamist warfare and antisemitism.\nIn 2011 she joined the Asian Law Caucus and went to war against Jewish students facing antisemitic harassment. In 2010, Jessica Felber, a Jewish student, had been assaulted by a leader of the Students for Justice in Palestine campus hate group, and filed suit against UC Berkeley for tolerating an atmosphere of hate by activists linked to terrorist organizations. .\nNasrina Bargzie accused Jewish students and organizations of “organized legal bullying” for suing universities. She ridiculed the idea that calling for the destruction of Israel was “threatening” and co-signed a petition claiming that the lawsuit by Jewish students was “threatening” the speech of Berkeley Students for Justice in Palestine and the Berkeley Muslim Students Association.\nJewish students, she argued, were the “aggressors” and rejected the idea that there was anything “anti-semitic” about the campus hate groups and their ties to Islamic terrorism.\nNasrina Bargzie was so desperate that she presented a request to the UN Human Rights Commission, a group often stocked with Islamic terrorist states, to intervene and stop the Department of Education from investigating “allegations of anti-Semitism on several campuses”.\nHatem Bazian, the co-founder of Students for Justice in Palestine and the godfather of campus antisemitism, would later thank Nasrina and others, for “being constantly engaged in everything related to Palestine”. Alongside her was Zahra Billoo, the local head of CAIR, with whom Nasrina Bargzie had co-signed the letter, who would defend Hezbollah and Hamas.\nObviously this is a horrendous pick, but also notably, Kamala just promoted two of the extremists already in her inner circle instead of finding properly qualified people. This does not bode well for her ability to run a campaign and is exactly why both her original campaign and VP office imploded.",

    "text": "ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. — [Bills Mafia](/meetthemafia) is known for supporting charitable causes outside of Western New York, and on Sunday, the donations started to flow once again. Not long after the Bills secured a playoff berth, thanks to Tennessee knocking off the Jacksonville Jaguars, before 4 p.m. Sunday, Bills Mafia co-founder and 26 Shirts founder Del Reid had an idea. \"Sure why not. Just fired off $17 to [@KingHenry_2](https://twitter.com/KingHenry_2)’s foundation #BillsMafia [twoallfoundation.org](https://twoallfoundation.org/),\" [he said on X](https://twitter.com/DelReid/status/1744101805905031343), the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, alluding to Titans running back Derrick Henry. Henry had 19 carries for 153 yards and a touchdown in leading the Titans to victory. Perhaps more importantly, he's also the team's Walter Payton Man of the Year Award nominee in back-to-back seasons. The Man of the Year award recognizes NFL players who contribute to community services off the field, and who also thrive on the field. Henry created the [Two All Foundation](https://twoallfoundation.org/) \"to level the playing field for today’s youth so that their future success is not limited by the circumstances of their upbringing, background, disability, or influence,\" according to the organizations website. The foundation also honors his grandmother, Gladys Henry, who played a key role as he grew up. Reid was recently named the 2023 Buffalo Bills Fan of the Year, with former Buffalo wide receiver Stevie Johnson announcing the recognition at Highmark Stadium. Tennessee's win made it clear what's at stake in Sunday night's game in Miami against the Dolphins. If the Bills win, they will claim the AFC East Division crown and be the No. 2 seed when the playoffs start next week. The Steelers be the No. 7 seed coming to Highmark Stadium. If the Bills lose, they would be a wild card and the No. 7 seed, meaning another game next week in South Florida.",

    "text": "Istituto Marangoni Miami (IMM) and renowned Italian designer Sara Battaglia debuted the iconic “Red Collar” shirt capsule during Miami Art Week, a project designed to raise awareness about gender-based violence. The exclusive event took place on December 2, 2024, at IMM, gathering luminaries from fashion, music, film, and entertainment to celebrate this powerful initiative.\nPhoto Credit: Courtesy\nHosted by Hakan Baykam, IMM President and CEO, and Sara Battaglia, the evening marked a celebration of creativity and social impact. Notable guests included Eva Hughes, IMM Executive Vice President; Elizabeth Sulcer, celebrity stylist; Carmen Busquets, entrepreneur; model Clementine Desseaux; and Angeles Almuna, founder of Fashion Strikes Cancer. The event also featured DJ ilMuretto, who set the tone for the vibrant evening.\nThe centerpiece of the night was the auction of a reimagined “Red Collar” shirt designed by Giovanna Battaglia Engelbert, Creative Director of Swarovski and Sara Battaglia’s sister. Embellished with 3,000 red Swarovski crystals, the shirt fetched the highest bid of $500. The proceeds from the auction, along with additional contributions, will support IMM’s scholarship fund, helping underprivileged and talented students pursue careers in fashion and design.\nThe “Red Collar” project, spearheaded by Sara Battaglia, uses fashion as a medium to amplify women’s voices and promote awareness of gender violence. The vibrant red hue of the shirts symbolizes resilience and strength, serving as a global emblem against abuse.\nHakam Baykam and Sara Battaglia Photo Credit: Courtesy\n“The Red Collar project is an emblem of education, solidarity, and rebirth. By collaborating with IMM, we’re empowering the next generation of designers to use fashion as a platform for meaningful change, while supporting women who are on their own journey of renewal,” notes Sara Battaglia. “The Red Collar project is a testament to the transformative power of creativity and craftsmanship. This special edition red collar shirt, adorned with Swarovski crystals, is more than a statement piece—it’s a symbol of resilience, strength, and hope,” adds Giovanna Battaglia Engelbert, highlighting the artistry and purpose of the project.\nIn collaboration with IMM students and prominent figures such as Rossy de Palma, Lola Schnabel, and Elizabeth Sulcer, the capsule showcased unique reinterpretations of the “Red Collar” shirt. Each design, crafted with care by Dritto Filo—an anti-violence organization supporting survivors—represents a powerful message of empowerment and renewal.\nSara Battaglia X IMM Red Collar Photo Credit: Courtesy\nIMM’s involvement in the “Red Collar” project underscores its commitment to using fashion as a tool for meaningful change. Twenty talented IMM students participated in the initiative, offering fresh perspectives on the symbolic garment. These designs will remain on display at IMM through December, allowing the public to engage with the message of resilience and solidarity.\nThe classic “Red Collar” shirts are available for purchase exclusively at The Webster Miami until December 31, 2024. This initiative stands as a beacon of hope, combining fashion, education, and social advocacy to make a lasting impact.",

    "text": "Tourismus\nUSA und China: Ansehen beschädigt - und der Tourismus leidet\nMünchen/Peking / Lesedauer: 5 min\nIm globalen Reiseverkehr haben Krisen und Konflikte der vergangenen Jahre China bislang mehr geschadet als den USA. Die beiden großen deutschen Flughäfen Frankfurt und München melden auch nach dem Amtsantritt von US-Präsident Donald Trump in diesem Jahr bisher einen Anstieg der Passagierzahlen auf den US-Routen, im China-Verkehr hingegen einen Rückgang. Und im direkten Vergleich der jeweiligen weltweiten Besucherzahlen haben die Vereinigten Staaten China seit 2019 überholt.\nFachwelt erwartet Trump-Krise im US-Tourismus\nDer Münchner Flughafen zählte von Januar bis Mai knapp 1,2 Millionen Passagiere im Flugverkehr mit den USA – fast 37.000 mehr als ein Jahr zuvor. Auch in Frankfurt legten die Fluggastzahlen in den ersten vier Monaten – noch ohne Mai – um 7.600 auf 944.300 zu. Das deutet bisher nicht auf einen riesigen Trump-Effekt. Allerdings ist diesen Daten nicht zu entnehmen, ob die Flieger mehrheitlich mit US-Bürgern oder Europäern besetzt waren. Die Zahlen beinhalten sowohl abfliegende als auch ankommende Passagiere.\nDass Trumps zweite Amtszeit dem US-Tourismus schaden wird, ist Konsens in der Fachwelt: Nach Schätzung des in London ansässigen Welttourismusverband WTTC und des Beratungsinstituts Oxford Economics kommen auf die USA in diesem Jahr Einnahmeverluste von über zwölf Milliarden Dollar zu, weil Ausländer fernbleiben. Der „Spiegel“ widmete der Trump-bedingten Reisekrise die Titelgeschichte seiner jüngsten Ausgabe.\nChina-Tourismus: Pandemie wirkt nach, Ukraine-Krieg schadet\nAuf den China-Flugrouten von und nach München und Frankfurt sind die Passagierzahlen in diesem Jahr bereits geschrumpft: um 1.300 auf knapp 203.000 Passagiere während der ersten fünf Monate in München. In den ersten vier Monaten in Frankfurt waren es 180.300 Fluggäste, die nach China flogen oder von dort ankamen, 27.000 weniger als ein Jahr zuvor. Ein quasi identisches Bild zeigt sich auch beim längerfristigen Vergleich der Jahre 2019 und 2024: Gesunkene Passagierzahlen nach und aus China, im Saldo höhere im US-Flugverkehr.\nWoran liegt das? „Die Erreichbarkeit Chinas hat sich erheblich verändert“, sagt Dennis Utzerath, Tourismusfachmann bei der internationalen Unternehmensberatung BCG in Köln. In der Corona-Pandemie wurde das Flugangebot sehr stark zusammengestrichen.\nUnd wegen des Ukraine-Kriegs umfliegen europäische Fluggesellschaften seit 2022 den russischen Luftraum auf teuren Umwegen, chinesische nicht. „Für europäische Fluggesellschaften ist es dadurch erheblich schwieriger geworden, gegen chinesische Airlines wettbewerbsfähig zu sein“, sagt Utzerath. Mehrere europäische Fluggesellschaften – darunter die Lufthansa und British Airways – setzten Verbindungen nach China aus.\nReiseveranstalter sehen wieder steigendes Interesse an China\n„Die immer noch schwachen Fluggastzahlen aus Deutschland Richtung China lassen erstaunlicherweise keinen Rückschluss auf die tatsächliche touristische Nachfrage für China zu“, sagt Holger Baldus, Sicherheitsmanager beim Münchner Reiseanbieter Studiosus. Hintergrund der Fluggastzahlen seien die Streckeneinstellungen europäischer Carrier Richtung China. Der Reiseanbieter sieht sogar ein erstaunliches Wiedererstarken des China-Tourismus aus Deutschland, Österreich und der Schweiz, nach Worten des Managers „derzeit von der knappen Verfügbarkeit an Flugsitzen noch gezügelt“.\nAuch der größte deutsche Reiseveranstalter Tui berichtet, dass das Interesse an China wachse – „aber natürlich von einer recht übersichtlichen Ausgangsbasis“, wie ein Sprecher des Unternehmens sagt.\nChinas Ansehen in der westlichen Welt leidet schon länger\nOffenkundig ist jedoch, dass China seit der Corona-Pandemie international an Attraktivität verloren hat. Reisten 2019 nach offiziellen Zahlen noch knapp 96,6 Millionen Ausländer in die Volksrepublik, waren es 2024 nur noch rund 64,9 Millionen – ein Rückgang von etwa ein Drittel. Der Reiseverkehr in die USA hat sich nach dem Ende der Pandemie deutlich schneller erholt: 2019 zählten die Vereinigten Staaten 79,3 Millionen Besucher, weniger als die Volksrepublik. Im vergangenen Jahr waren es 72,3 Millionen – mehr als in China.\nChinas Ansehen in der westlichen Welt leidet schon erheblich länger als das der USA. Welchen Effekt die Berichterstattung – etwa über staatliche Überwachung und Schnüffelei, brachiale Corona-Lockdowns, Umweltverschmutzung oder Kriegsdrohungen gegen Taiwan – hatte und hat, lässt sich nicht bemessen.\nTourismus lebt von „positiven Bildern im Kopf“\n„Das Thema Image spielt beim Thema China sicher eine Rolle“, sagt Unternehmensberater Utzerath. Schlechte Publicity hinterlasse immer Spuren. „Und das liegt weniger daran, dass ein Land „unten durch“ wäre, sondern dass der Fluss an schönen Erfahrungen, positiven Reiseberichten und Eindrücken abreißt.“ Damit verlagere sich das Interesse. „Ich würde dem keine übermäßige Dramatik beimessen, aber das zeigt, was für ein volatiles Geschäft Tourismus ist. Die Branche lebt von Schlagzeilen und positiven Bildern im Kopf.“\nDieselbe Volatilität gilt auch für die USA: „Es ist im Moment nicht so, dass viele Schlagzeilen dafür sprechen, ausgerechnet jetzt in die USA zu reisen, wenn man letztes Jahr nicht dort war“, sagt Utzerath. Auf der anderen Seite ist der Dollar-Wechselkurs derzeit für Europäer durchaus günstig.\nChina braucht Touristen als Stütze einer schwachen Konjunktur\nAnders als die US-Regierung will Peking ausdrücklich mehr Reisende ins Land locken. Mittlerweile hat die chinesische Regierung ihre komplizierte und teure Visapolitik gelockert. Deutsche brauchen für Geschäfts- oder Tourismusreisen kein Visum mehr. Wer einreist, darf mittlerweile 30 Tage bleiben. Diese Regelung gilt auch für zahlreiche andere europäische Länder.\nAuch die Zugänge zum digitalen Bezahlsystem Chinas sind durch übersetzte Apps und Akzeptanz ausländischer Kreditkarten einfacher geworden. Im ersten Quartal dieses Jahres bezifferten die Behörden die Einreisen von Ausländern auf etwa 17,4 Millionen – im Jahresvergleich ein Zuwachs um etwas mehr als ein Drittel.\nPeking hofft, dass der Tourismus auch der heimischen Wirtschaft unter die Arme greift. Die schwache Nachfrage und eingetrübte Konsumlaune, die der Wirtschaftsleistung zusetzen, will China auch mit mehr Inlandstourismus wieder ankurbeln. Neue Angebote – etwa speziell für Senioren ausgelegte Zugreisen mit Krankenversorgung und Pflege an Bord – sollen auch die ältere Bevölkerung zu größerem Konsum bewegen.",
