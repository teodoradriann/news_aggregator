    "text": "Customer's photo of forlorn owner in empty restaurant leads business to boom at OK diner Nick Chappell had never been to Spirals Hot Dogs & More before he took a photo of Scott Hosek in his empty restaurant. But after business boomed, Chappell's part of the Spirals family, Hosek says. [Anthony Robledo](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7612431001/anthony-robledo/) An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Hosek standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Hosek would soon have no time to stand around as \" [Spirals: Hot Dogs & More](https://spiralshotdogs.com/),\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Hosek told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Hosek found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Hosek said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Hosek wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': [See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her](/story/life/humankind/2023/12/26/dolly-parton-meets-longtime-fan/72033945007/) Customer knew he had to capture 'wholesome moment' Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance. Noticing Hosek gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\" \"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Hosek waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Owner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Hosek is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Hosek said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Hosek added.",

    "text": "Human Interest Real People Real People Tragedy 2-Year-Old Reportedly Dies After Waiting Hours for Hospital Bed: 'We Were Ignored,' Mom Claims “He had his whole life ahead of him,” Joe Massa's family said in a statement By David Chiu David Chiu David Chiu is a staff writer, Human Interest, for PEOPLE. A former PEOPLE intern from 2007 to 2008, he has been writing about news and entertainment for over 10 years. People Editorial Guidelines Published on February 20, 2025 06:09PM EST 1 Comments Joe Massa, 2, was taken to Northern Beaches Hospital in Sydney after falling ill last SeptemberHis parents alleged that after being admitted to the hospital, their son waited for over two hours for a bed — then had a heart attack later that night and was taken off life support days later\"We were ignored,\" mom Elouise Massa told ABC Radio Sydney The parents of a 2-year-old boy who died while seeking treatment at a hospital in Australia are speaking out, accusing the facility of failing their son “at every level.” \"He died a cruel death at the hands of a hospital that failed him,\" mom Elouise Massa said of her late son Joe in an interview with 9News. On Sept. 14, 2024, a weakened Joe was taken to Northern Beaches Hospital in Sydney after having vomited throughout the night, Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC News) reported. The family said that Joe was suffering from major hypovolemia, a condition in which the body loses fluid, which is crucial to maintaining organ function, according to The Guardian. Mom Claims Her 11-Day-Old Daughter Died from Infection at ‘Absolutely Putrid’ Hospital: Reports At the time of Joe’s admission, a triage nurse and an emergency trainee doctor allegedly classified him as a Category 3 patient, a designation that means he required treatment within 30 minutes, 7News, Sky News and ABC News reported. (A subsequent review challenged whether this was the right classification given the severity of his illness, findings which the hospital said they accepted in a statement obtained by PEOPLE.) However, according to the family, after being admitted to the hospital, Joe was not given a bed for over two hours. “I don’t have any medical training, but I do know my son and I did know that he was deteriorating. He was not getting any better,\" mom Elouise told the outlet. \"He was getting worse by the minute.\" Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. \"We were ignored,\" Elouise told ABC Radio Sydney. \"As soon as we stepped foot into that hospital, Joe had no chance of survival.\" More than three hours after he was admitted to the hospital, Joe suffered a heart attack, according to the outlets. His was taken off life support two days later due to the brain damage he sustained, reported ABC News. “He had his whole life ahead of him,” the family said in a statement shared with the Guardian, “and we trusted Northern Beaches hospital to provide the care he needed. Instead, he was failed at every level.” Doctor Watched Son, 22, Die of Sepsis at Hospital Where She Worked After Her Advice Was 'Ignored': Reports In a statement obtained by PEOPLE, New South Wales Minister for Health Ryan Park confirmed that a Serious Adverse Event Review (SAER) report had \"been undertaken\" and that the hospital \"accepted all recommendations.” The report, which was submitted to the New South Wales Ministry of Health on Dec. 20, pointed out a number of missteps in the case, according to Sky News, news.com.au and the New York Post. In a separate statement obtained by PEOPLE, a spokesperson from Healthscope, which oversees Northern Beaches Hospital, said that the hospital \"accepts the findings\" of the review, \"including that there was an under appreciation of the severity of Joe’s illness and a delay in recognising deterioration.\" \"The doctors and nurses in our emergency department are exceptionally dedicated, and devoted to providing high quality care. They are devastated at Joe’s death, and committed to implementing all recommendations to prevent an incident like this from happening again,\" they added, noting that the hospital will continue to \"cooperate in full with any further review or investigations into this tragic incident.” In his statement, Park called what happened a \"terrible tragedy.\" “In the last 24 hours I have discussed with the Secretary of NSW Health to understand actions being taken in response to this tragedy,\" Park added. \"I have made it clear to NSW Health all recommendations need to be implemented in full and as quickly as possible.\" Continuing, Park added, “As the Minister for Health, this is among the worst possible things that can happen in our health system – a young child who should be with us is no longer alive. I never want any parent to go through this.\" Close",

    "title": "« On marche sur la tête » : le Système mis en accusation",
    "text": "La Révolution du Réel a imposé son slogan, simple et potentiellement dévastateur : « On marche sur la tête ». Les agriculteurs du Tarn ont été les premiers, en novembre 2023, à retourner les panneaux identifiant les communes, en signe de protestation contre une technocratie tombée en Absurdie. Depuis, ce procédé subtil et non-violent a été repris un peu partout dans la France périphérique et rurale. Or ce réveil contestataire pourrait faire tache d’huile, tant son message touche au cœur d’un système généralisé qui, jusqu’au sein de l’Union européenne convertie à l’écologisme, a perdu le contact avec la vie des gens ordinaires. Le bon sens, décrié par l’intelligentsia parisienne et ses avatars politiques, est en train de s’installer dans le débat public, au vu des désastres commis par la tyrannie des idéologues. Montesquieu avait déjà noté : « J’aime les paysans. Ils ne sont pas assez savants pour penser de travers ». L’histoire qui s’écrit pourrait bien s’appuyer sur leur colère légitime. Elle oblige les dirigeants à de profondes remises en question, qui dépassent les seuls problèmes liés à l’agriculture. Les morts tragiques d’Alexandra Sonac, éleveur de bovins, et de sa fille de 12 ans, Camille, fauchées par un chauffard en Ariège alors qu’elles participaient à un barrage routier près de leur commune de Saint-Félix-de-Tournegat, sont venues rappeler la perte de contrôle par l’Etat des frontières nationales : les trois occupants de la voiture étaient des Arméniens visés par une obligation, non respectée bien sûr, de quitter le territoire (OQTF). Lors de la conférence de presse du 16 janvier d’Emmanuel Macron, la crise agricole, qui allait éclater quelques jours plus tard, n’avait été abordée ni par le président ni par les journalistes. Cette indifférence parisienne illustre l’effacement dans lequel le monde rural a été maintenu, et explique son obligation de hurler pour se faire entendre. A la différence des Gilets jaunes, mouvement autonome, les syndicats agricoles sont cette fois partie prenante de la jacquerie. Reste que ce sont des leaders non mandatés qui ont lancé le mouvement en Occitanie, avec notamment Jérôme Bayle dont le père agriculteur, qui s’est suicidé, touchait une retraite de 690 euros et dont la mère, en retraite avec 49 ans d’activités, touche 217 euros. Une convergence de révoltes spontanées n’est pas à exclure, si le gouvernement n’arrive pas à éteindre le début d’incendie. L’inflation des normes, ce mal français déjà dénoncé par Montaigne (« Nous avons en France plus de lois que tout le reste du monde ensemble ») attend des réponses concrètes. Le code rural est passé de 755 pages en 1965 à 3068 pages ! Mais c’est surtout la défense de la souveraineté nationale qui, en tous domaines, s’impose comme une priorité. Ce mercredi sur Europe 1, Jordan Bardella (RN) a réclamé une « exception agro-culturelle » et un « patriotisme économique » dans les commandes publiques. La Révolution du Réel ne va pas plaire aux « progressistes » qui ont perdu le Nord… [https://blogrioufol.com/on-marche-sur-la-tete-le-systeme-mis-en-accusation/](https://blogrioufol.com/on-marche-sur-la-tete-le-systeme-mis-en-accusation/)",

    "title": "Les pieds à Bethléem, le coeur à Gaza: sombre Noël en Terre sainte",
    "text": "Bethléem (Territoires palestiniens) (AFP) - Pas de sapin gigantesque, pas de crèche flamboyante, peu de joie. Un voile de tristesse enveloppe dimanche Bethléem, qui se pare habituellement de ses habits de fête à l'occasion de Noël, terni cette année par la guerre dans la bande de Gaza.\nPeu de fidèles et de touristes sont attendus au cours de la journée et à la messe de minuit dans la ville palestinienne en Cisjordanie occupée, qui selon la tradition chrétienne a vu naître Jésus-Christ.\nLa suite après la publicité Les touristes ont fui la région depuis le début de la guerre entre Israël et le Hamas le 7 octobre.\nLes chrétiens palestiniens n'ont, eux, pas le coeur aux célébrations, largement annulées par la municipalité, ne pouvant rester indifférents au sort de leurs concitoyens, assiégés et bombardés à Gaza.\n\"Ils sont nombreux à mourir pour cette terre, c'est très difficile de célébrer quelque chose alors que notre peuple se meurt\", estime Nicole Najjar, étudiante de 18 ans, sur la place de la Mangeoire désertée.\nFace à la basilique de la Nativité, une oeuvre d'art évoquant le drame de Gaza a été installée à terre, en lieu et place de la crèche grandeur nature et du colossal sapin: Marie et Joseph, statues grises, au milieu d'un fatras de débris et de tôle, derrière des barbelés.\nLa suite après la publicité Sur l'immeuble d'à côté, une grande banderole: \"Arrêtez le génocide, arrêtez le déplacement, levez le blocus\": \"les cloches de Bethléem sonnent pour un cessez-le-feu à Gaza\".\nLa guerre entre le Hamas et Israël a été déclenchée le 7 octobre par l'attaque de commandos du mouvement palestinien sur le sol israélien, faisant environ 1.140 morts, en majorité des civils, d'après les autorités israéliennes. En représailles, Israël a juré d'\"anéantir\" le Hamas, pilonnant la bande de Gaza, où plus de 20.400 personnes, en majorité des civils, ont été tuées, selon le gouvernement du Hamas.\nDans le territoire palestinien, gouverné par le Hamas, des chrétiens, dont le nombre est estimé à un petit millier, ont pris refuge dans des églises qui n'ont pas été épargnées par les combats.\nLa semaine dernière, une mère et sa fille ont été tuées par des tirs israéliens dans l'enceinte de l'église de la Sainte-Famille dans la ville de Gaza, selon le patriarcat. Le pape François a dénoncé des bombardements et des tirs ciblant \"des civils sans défense\".\nLa suite après la publicité - \"Tristesse et chagrin\" -\nLe président français Emmanuel Macron a exprimé au patriarche latin de Jérusalem \"sa vive préoccupation\" face à \"la situation dramatique\" de cette église où les deux femmes ont été tuées \"de manière indigne\", a indiqué dimanche l'Elysée.\nLe patriarche, Pierbattista Pizzaballa, a déclaré dimanche, à son arrivée à Bethléem, qu'il fallait \"mettre un terme aux hostilités car la violence n'engendre que la violence\".\n\"Le message de Noël n'est pas celui de la violence mais de la paix, nous voulons la paix, surtout pour les Palestiniens qui attendent depuis trop longtemps\", a-t-il dit, keffieh noir et blanc autour du cou.\nLa suite après la publicité \"Cette année est différente des autres, elle est faite de tristesse, de chagrin, de destruction, de privation et de perte\", se désole Mervat Murra, 50 ans, créatrice de mode à Bethléem.\nLa parade de scouts, qui réveille habituellement la ville à coups de cornemuses et tambourins, a laissé place à un défilé silencieux. \"Nous voulons la vie, pas la mort\", proclamait une des banderoles tenues par des enfants.\nDans la matinée, un immense drapeau palestinien a été déplié sur la place de la Mangeoire, tenu par chaque bout par des adultes et des enfants, chrétiens et musulmans.\n- \"Personne ne viendra\" -\nLa suite après la publicité Autour de la place de la Mangeoire, la famille Giacaman a ouvert son magasin de crèches et autres objets d'art liturgique pour la première fois depuis le 8 octobre, sans illusion.\n\"Personne ne viendra, on a ouvert parce qu'il le faut, c'est Noël\", dit Amir Giacaman, 29 ans. \"Pendant le Covid, on a eu deux mauvaises années mais ce n'est rien comparé à ça\".\n\"Nous n'avons pas le goût aux célébrations alors que Gaza connaît un génocide et même ici en Cisjordanie, nous pleurons de jeunes gens tués par les Israéliens et d'autres détenus chaque jour\", dit à l'AFP Mitri Raheb, pasteur d'une église luthérienne de Bethléem.\nLes hostilités à Gaza ont fait tâche d'huile en Cisjordanie, territoire palestinien occupé par Israël depuis 1967, où plus de 300 Palestiniens ont été tués depuis le 7 octobre par des tirs de soldats ou de colons israéliens.\nLa suite après la publicité \"Tout ce que nous voulons pour Noël c'est un cessez-le-feu, durable, pour mettre fin à cette atrocité\", dit Mitri Raheb.\n\"Bethléem a donné Jésus au monde. Il est grand temps que le monde donne la paix à Bethléem et à Gaza\".",

    "text": "El Atlético tiene la mejor \"segunda unidad\" de LaLiga con tres claros protagonistas - Los suplentes del Atlético suman nueve goles - Solo el Brighton le supera en Europa El Atlético de Madrid [va muy en serio esta temporada](https://www.eldesmarque.com/futbol/liga-1a-division/20231226/la-clasificacion-de-laliga-de-todo-2023-doble-lider-el-betis-se-cuela-entre-los-vascos-el-sevilla-se-queda-muy-atras_300196124.html).

Un equipo muy unido en el que [se apoyan unos a otros cuando fallan](https://www.eldesmarque.com/futbol/atletico-de-madrid/20231224/soyuncu-arropado-en-el-atletico-de-madrid-tras-su-expulsion-es-una-alegria-tenerle_300195316.html), un espíritu competitivo que siembra la felicidad en el Cívitas Metropolitano. Sin embargo, detrás de todo éxito siempre hay unas estadísticas que lo respalda y el conjunto rojiblanco no solo puede presumir de tener [al mejor goleador y asistente de este año](https://www.eldesmarque.com/futbol/atletico-de-madrid/20231226/griezmann-cierra-el-debate-maximo-goleador-y-maximo-asistente-de-laliga-en-2023_300196005.html), sino que además tiene en su filas a la mejor \"segunda unidad\" de LaLiga. Durante los últimos años, los colchoneros carecían de jugadores que rompiesen el partido partiendo desde el banquillo, un problema al que se puso fin desde el pasado mes de enero gracias a la emersión de los suplentes. Concretamente, la retaguardia del Atlético suma nueve goles esta temporada, superando por uno al Girona, actual líder compartido con el Real Madrid en la clasificación. Únicamente hay uno equipo en Europa que está por encima de los rojiblancos, el Brighton con once dianas gracias a jugadores refrescos del banquillo. Sumando ligas y competiciones europeas, los ingleses suman doce mientras que el Atlético once, al igual que el Rennes. Goleadores salvavidas para el Atlético Con la medalla de oro en España, el registro del que puede presumir Simeone es que cuenta con tres protagonistas en esta estadística: Marcos Llorente, Samuel Lino y Álvaro Morata. Aunque son jugadores de confianza para Simeone con una presencia en el once casi habitual, cuando el argentino les deja en el banquillo siempre acaban siendo determinantes cuando saltan al campo para desatascar partidos. El último caso fue el de Llorente, el jugador que lo cambió todo en el triunfo ante el Sevilla con [un gol nada más salir por Nahuel Molina](https://www.eldesmarque.com/futbol/atletico-de-madrid/20231223/simeone-se-carga-a-nahuel-molina-y-marcos-llorente-le-da-la-razon-en-40-segundos_300195063.html) tras el descanso. Tres puntos que fueron vitales y que también se reflejó en la goleada ante el Rayo Vallecano. Lino ha ido de menos a más esta temporada. Su rendimiento fue mejorando y se materializó en varias ocasiones cuando salía del banquillo con dos goles, uno ante el Villarreal en Liga y [ante el Celtic en Champions](https://www.eldesmarque.com/futbol/atletico-de-madrid/20231107/samuel-lino-vuelve-y-de-que-forma-misil-a-la-escuadra-del-celtic_300149895.html). Respecto a Morata, se trata de un delantero que funciona tanto de titular como de suplente. El mejor socio de Antoine Griezmann ha basculado en varias ocasiones y al final ha tenido que entrar para ayudar en la falta de gol. Frente al Getafe no empezó de inicio y terminó saliendo para marcar a los seis minutos de entrar, una hazaña que ha repetido en dos ocasiones más (doblete ante el Rayo). Detrás de ellos, Rodrigo Riquelme, Saúl Ñíguez, Memphis Depay y Ángel Correa suman uno cada uno. El Atlético de Madrid valora la \"segunda unidad\" más que nunca y se trata de un valor añadido para soñar cosas grandes en el Metropolitano.",

    "text": "BARTLESVILLE, Okla. — The Bartlesville area is moving out of the drought stages as water continues to flow into the city's primary water supply source, Hulah Lake, after heavy rains in southeastern Kansas during Christmas weekend. \"Rains that started over the Christmas holiday have had a significant impact on our water supply, increasing Hulah Lake levels by 3.5 feet as of today,\" Water Utilities Director Terry Lauritsen said. \"Now, a week later, water continues to flow into the lake. This has moved us out of all stages of the Water Shortage Ordinance for the first time since December 2022.\" Bartlesville's overall water remaining is 72.1%, which is about 20% higher than it was a month ago. Weighted water supply is sitting at 128% which exceeds the required 95% for stage one of the water shortage ordinance. \"Because we rely most heavily on Hulah Lake for our water supply, as that is where we have the most water right, we really couldn't be in a better situation than we are now,\" Lauritsen said. \"Hopefully, we will continue to see enough rain in the Hulah watershed to keep us out of all drought contingency plan stages as we continue to seek additional water sources to meet future weather and climate-related challenges.\" Even though Bartlesville and surrounding water customers have seen an improvement, other communities that rely on Copan Lake are still struggling with drought issues. \"They desperately need rain in the Copan Lake watershed area,\" said Lauritsen.

So to be able to give them a place where they can call home, they can have some structure, but still be able to develop those independent living skills so that they will be ready when they’re out on their own and they age out of foster care, that’s really important. This is a population that’s been really underserved for a long time,” said Emma Smith.\nThe public is welcome to attend an open house Friday morning, March 15, from 10 a.m. to noon at Pete’s Place, 2943 N. Keystone Road, next to the Goodwill Inn.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "text": "Otro popular servicio de streaming Amazon Music Unlimited sube sus precios.\nEsto es lo que sabemos Para los usuarios que tengan una suscripción a Amazon Prime, el precio de un plan individual pasará de 10 a 11 dólares al mes o de 99 a 109 dólares al año. Aquellos que no sean miembros Prime pagarán ahora 12 dólares al mes por un plan individual en lugar de los 11 dólares anteriores. Para los planes familiares, los precios también han cambiado: de 17 a 20 dólares al mes y de 169 a 199 dólares al año.\nLa nueva política de precios entró en vigor el 29 de enero para los nuevos usuarios. Los abonados actuales verán las nuevas tarifas en su próxima factura, que llegará después del 5 de marzo.\nEn la sección de preguntas frecuentes que explica el aumento de precios se afirma que los cambios permitirán a los usuarios obtener \"más contenidos y funciones\". La misma explicación se dio durante la anterior subida de precios en 2023. Desde entonces, el servicio ha añadido la posibilidad de tomar prestados audiolibros a través de Audible y recibir resúmenes personalizados de fin de año. Aunque estas innovaciones pueden ser interesantes, para muchos usuarios es más importante que los precios se mantengan al mismo nivel.\nAmazon sigue luchando por fidelizar a sus usuarios frente a otros populares servicios de streaming como Spotify y Apple Music, y actualiza con frecuencia su servicio con nuevas funciones. Sin embargo, con el aumento de los precios, la cuestión de la asequibilidad se está convirtiendo en un problema para muchos suscriptores, que podrían recurrir a otras plataformas si resulta más rentable.\nFuente: Amazon",
