    "title": "Man jailed for four years for removing condom without consent during sex | ITV News London",
    "text": "A man has been jailed for taking a condom he was wearing off without consent during sex. Guy Mukendi, 39, of Brixton in south London, was sentenced on Thursday to four years and three months in prison, the Metropolitan Police said. Mukendi was arrested following a report of sexual assault made by a young woman in Brixton on May 9 2023. The Met said the woman had consented with Mukendi on condition that a condom was used. But during sex, he removed the condom without the victim’s knowledge. Non-consensual condom removal is sometimes referred to as “stealthing” and is classified as rape under English and Welsh law. The Met said prosecutions for this type of crime were very rare due to under-reporting. In a press release, the force also described the “milestone” case as “unique”. Local officers from Brixton looked at text exchanges and forensic evidence and worked with the victim to obtain screenshots of messages from Mukendi in which he apologised for taking the condom off. He said he did it because he had not had sex in a long time. He then deleted the messages. Mukendi was found guilty on April 2 at Inner London Crown Court, and was sentenced at the same venue on Thursday. Detective Constable Jack Earl, who led the investigation, said: “Throughout this investigation, Mukendi denied any wrongdoing – but our officers built a compelling case against him to leave no doubt in the jury’s mind. “We were dedicated to securing justice for the victim and will continue to raise awareness that this crime is a form of rape. “The victim did the right thing to call the police straight away and her bravery should not be overshadowed. “If you have been a victim of sexual violence and not yet reported it – please contact your local police service and we will do all that we can to help and bring you justice.” Kate Holmes, head of Sexual Violence Helplines at Survivors Gateway, added: “Survivors of sexual violence in London can contact the Survivor’s Gateway on 0808 801 0860 to be connected with support. “Our navigators provide a confidential, non-judgmental space, and can make referrals for counselling as well as practical advocacy support.”Want a quick and expert briefing on the biggest news stories?

    "title": "Lecco, i gamberi di fiume della Bevera sono salvi: l'epidemia di peste è stata sconfitta",
    "text": "Colle Brianza (Lecco), 18 luglio 2024 – I rari gamberi di fiume della Bevera sono salvi . Hanno rischiato l' estinzione totale per una epidemia di peste . A scongiurare la morte di tutti gli esemplari a causa di un fungo che intacca il carapace dei crostacei, cioè la corazza fino a ucciderli in brevissimo tempo, sono stati i volontari del Wwf di Lecco e i ricercatori del Dipartimento di Scienze e politiche ambientali Università degli Studi di Milano .\nLe barriere Per stroncare l'epidemia, lungo il corso d'acqua, hanno installato delle barriere in legno per separare i gamberi malati ormai spacciati, dai pochi ancora sani, in modo da isolarli in quarantena e consentirne la sopravvivenza. Durante diversi sopralluoghi, a valle della prima diga, non sono stati riscontrati gamberi, né vivi, né morti. A monte già della prima delle due barriere, invece, è stato possibile osservare diversi individui vivi e attivi fin dal mese di aprile. Nell’ultimo sopralluogo di luglio è stata poi osservata in media una densità di 0,75 gamberi/m2, peraltro considerando solo i gamberi più lunghi di 4 centimetri. “Nei prossimi giorni si provvederà pertanto a rimuovere la seconda barriera, mentre la prima, invece, per prudenza, sarà mantenuta almeno sino ai mesi autunnali – spiega Raoul Manenti , ricercatore e consigliere del Wwf di Lecco, insieme ai biologi Beatrice Caimi e Matteo Galbiati -. Tra ottobre e novembre sono poi previsti intensi monitoraggi, volti a valutare lo status della popolazione di gamberi\"\nUna bella notizia \"Sicuramente una bella notizia - aggiungono dal Wwf di Lecco -, resa ancora migliore dalla consapevolezza che questo risultato sia stato raggiunto grazie alla collaborazione dei volontari del Wwf di Lecco con gli amministratori locali del Comune di Colle Brianza e gli esperti dell’Ersaf, Ente regionale per i servizi all'agricoltura e alle foreste, nonché grazie all’indispensabile supporto degli Amici del Monte di Brianza e dei volontari del Comitato per la difesa delle Bevere e del Fiume Lambro e del Wwf Insubria, oltre al generoso contributo economico dei cittadini”. L'allarme però non è ancora cessato: il tratto attualmente interessato dalla presenza dei gamberi è solo una piccola porzione di quello inizialmente occupato; presenta inoltre caratteristiche non così ottimali come i tratti a valle in cui è avvenuta la moria. “La sfida potrà dirsi davvero vinta solo se, nei prossimi anni, la popolazione di gamberi di fiume riprenderà la propria originaria estensione, e se simili eventi di moria non si ripeteranno”, sottolineano sempre dal Wwf di Lecco.",

    "text": "Ramban, June 20: The first trial run of Mainline Electric Multiple Unit (MEMU) train run was successfully conducted on Thursday between Sangaldan and Reasi across Chenab bridge. The run of MEMU train, a train with eight coaches, was conducted on a newly constructed electrified rail line section of Sangaldan -Reasi with a route length of 46 Km, of the USBRL project at a speed of 40 km. Official sources said the Mainline Electric Multiple Unit (MEMU) train passed through nine tunnels with a combined length of 40,787 km. They said the longest rail tunnel, T-44, has a length of 11.31, Kms, The first-ever train crossed the iconic Bridge between Dugga and Bakkal stations across the Chenab River, in Reasi which is the world’s highest railway bridge with a central span of 467 meters at a staggering height of 359 meters. Railway authorities said the Reasi, Bakkal, Dugga and Sawalkote railway stations are situated in the Reasi district of Jammu and Kashmir. They claimed that the Railway Electrification work on this section has been executed with state-of-the-art technology, ROCS (Rigid Overhead Conductor System) at 25 kV, for the first time on Indian Railways. Earlier in February 2024, Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the 48,1 km Banihal-Sangaldan section of the USBRL Rail Link and flagged off the first electric train in Kashmir valley. Rail service will likely extend up to Reasi from Baramulla by the end of June. The work on the Udhampur Srinagar Rail Link project will be completed by or before the end of 2024. Minister of Railways, Ashwini Vaishnaw posted on X, “Successful run of the MEMU train between the Sangaldan and Reasi section of the USBRL Project in Jammu.”",

    "text": "In Bakersfield, California, a local pastor, Angelo Frazier, led a group of hundreds of protesters from various churches to voice their opposition to a touring Christmas-themed drag show, \"A Drag Queen Christmas.\" The show, which features drag queens from \"RuPaul's Drag Race,\" has been running for nine consecutive years and is currently touring 38 cities.\nPastor Frazier, who leads RiverLakes Community Church, described the event as \"naughty\" and \"perversion,\" citing its \"sexual language\" and \"naughty comedy.\" He argues that the show was \"sexualizing Christmas\" and that it was inappropriate for children and families.\n\"The message of Christmas is good will and great joy for all people,\" Frazier said. \"This, what's happening here in Bakersfield, is a perversion of Christmas.\" The pastor felt it was his duty as a Christian to speak out against the event.\nDuring the protest, Frazier addressed the crowd, emphasizing that their opposition was not rooted in hate but in a desire to offer a better way. The protest included singing Christmas carols and praying outside the Fox Theater, where the show was being held.\nGet your FREE CHARISMA NEWSLETTERS today! Stay up to date with current issues, Holy Spirit news, Christian teachings, Charisma videos & more!\nLast year's tour of \"A Drag Queen Christmas\" sparked controversy when footage appeared to show small children attending performances that featured simulated sex, lewd dancing, sexually explicit stories and a man with prosthetic breasts being spanked. The event's organizers, Drag Fans, state that \"all ages are welcome unless otherwise noted on the marketing, the ticket, or the venue website in each local city.\"\nIn Florida, state regulators and the Hyatt Regency Miami reached a settlement regarding a dispute about minors attending a performance of the show at the hotel last year. The hotel agreed to pay a fine and to prohibit minors from attending any performance that \"contains, depicts, or simulates any activities\" that violate Florida's lewdness statutes.\nAs Christians, we are called to live righteous lives according to the Bible. Although God loves all people, we are encouraged to stand for what is right and to be a light in the darkness. In 1 Corinthians 6:9-11, the Word of God states:\n\"Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor male prostitutes, nor homosexuals, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God. Such were some of you. But you were washed, you were sanctified, and you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus by the Spirit of our God.\"\nThe protest led by Pastor Angelo Frazier demonstrates the concerns of Christians about the sexualization of Christmas and the potential impact on children and families. As believers, we are called to love one another, but also to stand for righteousness and to live according to God's Word.\nJoin Charisma Magazine Online to follow everything the Holy Spirit is doing around the world!\nJames Lasher is staff writer for Charisma Media.",

    "text": "[Skip to main content](#main) United Way raised $1.5M for N.S. wildfires in 2023 United Way raised $1.5 million for people impacted by the 2023 wildfires in Nova Scotia. According to a [report by United Way](https://www.unitedwayhalifax.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Final-Wildfire-Recovery-Report-May-30.pdf), the organization distributed $1.06 million in the community in the wake of fires in Shelburne, Barrington, and Upper Tantallon. They spent $167,000 on expenses and $249,000 in ongoing investments for uninsured families. The report says United Way divided its funding into phase one (which focused on the immediate aftermath of the fires) and phase two (which centres on community building, back-to-school supplies, and mental health and cultural supports). “The United Way staff team has learned so much from this experience, including that we need to have plans in place for future climate change disasters,” the report reads. “As important as the wildfire response was, there are ongoing crises in our communities that still need attention. We need to be prepared and equipped to respond to both the ongoing and unexpected crises at the same time.” The report says United Way has provided 1,295 people with cleaning supplies, back-to-school items, and other personal supplies.
