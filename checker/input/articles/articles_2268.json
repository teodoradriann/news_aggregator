    "text": "Rangers Bank on Joc Pederson for Offensive Boost in 2025\nThe Texas Rangers are looking to bounce back offensively in 2025, especially at the designated hitter position, which was a significant weakness last season. After leading the American League in runs scored in 2023, the team struggled in 2024 with a poor .205 average at DH, contributing to a fall in overall team performance. Joc Pederson, signed for two years at $37 million, aims to fill this gap after a strong performance with the D-backs, where he achieved career highs in multiple categories. With Pederson's addition, the Rangers believe they can enhance their lineup's potential and improve run production moving forward.\n- Rangers DHs hit .205 in 2024, ranking 28th in the MLB.\n- In 2024, Joc Pederson posted career highs: .275 batting average, .393 OBP, and .908 OPS.\n- The Rangers recorded 33 home runs this spring, ranking fourth in the Cactus League.\n- Rangers lost starting pitchers Jon Gray and Cody Bradford to injuries during Spring Training.\n- The team is currently tied for fifth in MLB with 92 extra-base hits this spring.\n- Management feels optimistic about their offensive versatility and potential for higher run production.\nAs the season approaches, the Rangers will look to refine their lineup combinations, particularly incorporating Pederson effectively at DH. The team's ability to capitalize on their strong offensive spring performances may play a critical role in overcoming injuries to their pitching staff. If the offense can consistently generate runs, it will provide essential support for the rotation.\nBottom LineThe Rangers' investment in Joc Pederson reflects their commitment to enhancing offensive performance, especially in the designated hitter role. A successful transition for Pederson could be pivotal to improving the team's overall productivity and competitiveness in the upcoming season.\nRead more at MLB.com\nThe summary of the linked article was generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence technology from OpenAI",

    "text": "中国青年报客户端讯（中青报·中青网记者 魏其濛）近日，上海市教卫工作党委、上海市教委印发《深化新时代中小学体育工作高质量发展的若干措施》（以下简称《若干措施》），聚焦当前中小学体育工作重点难点，从课程、赛事、场地、师资、保障等9个方面建立深化中小学体育工作高质量发展长效机制。\n近年来，上海出台过多个关于中小学体育工作的文件。例如，2023年9月出台的《上海市促进中小学校体育工作高质量发展进一步提升学生体质健康水平行动方案》明确要求，保障学生每天校内外运动时间不少于2小时；2025年2月出台的《上海市中小学体育工作管理办法》，提出要加强课外校外体育锻炼，全面实施学校体育家庭作业制度，鼓励根据学生体质健康实际情况，布置有针对性的家庭作业。\n近日发布的《若干措施》进一步要求，学校要全面落实学生每天综合体育活动2小时并基本在校内完成，包括每天70分钟左右的体育课、体育活动课、大课间，另外还有不少于40分钟的体育锻炼活动，每月至少安排半天的“乐动比赛日”等，吸引学生走出教室、走向操场、走入阳光。\n关于“每天综合体育活动2小时并基本在校内完成”具体如何落实，在市教委今天举办的新闻通气会上，几位区教育局负责人、校长进行了分享。\n黄浦区教育局副局长金羿说，面对中心城区土地资源紧张的挑战，黄浦从时长、空间、质量上破题，在保障体育运动时长上，做到排课时体育课优先，搭配课间大活动，确保学生每日在校体育活动基本达到2小时；同时，学校将碎片空间转化为运动场域，并向外拓展，例如，黄浦外国语小学就把课堂搬到了滨江步道。\n杨浦区教育局副局长曾除非表示，针对体育师资不足的问题，杨浦区将举办“非体育学科教师运动技能系列培训班”，挖潜具有体育兴趣爱好的年轻教师和导师，对外邀请区体育部门教练、上体大研究生等进校园实施课后社团服务。\n普陀区洵阳路小学校长朱乃楣介绍说，洵阳路小学面积十分有限，近年来，学校“上天入地”创造活动空间。一方面往上拓展运动空间，西校区打造了150平方米的专业级攀岩墙，有4根标准的攀岩赛道，可以满足标准赛事；另一方面，用防空洞打造了1300平方米的地下空间，陆续安装了空气净化系统和监测系统，提升室内空气质量，开辟了旱地冰壶教室、乒乓、垫上运动和击剑等活动空间，“一上一下”就扩大了1500平方米。",

Los responsables de la misma han intentado arreglar la avería durante una hora, sin éxito.\nTranscurrido ese tiempo han avisado a los bomberos, quienes tras comprobar que tampoco se podía reanudar la marcha de la instalación, han decidido ir rescatando poco a poco, mediante dos escalas, a todos los usuarios atrapados.\nSobre las 21.00 horas, los bomberos habían rescatado ya a personal que ocupaba diez cabinas de las 24, y seguían desalojando a más clientes, que se encuentran \"tranquilos\", sin que se hayan producido daños personales.",

    "title": "Why are Easter eggs so expensive this year? Extreme weather in West Africa devastates cacao crops",
    "text": "Chocolate rabbits wait to be decorated at the Cocoatree chocolate shop, April 2020, in Lonzee, Belgium.\nEaster egg prices are higher this year as climate change hits cacao crops.\nPopular brands like Maltesers, Lindt and Ferrero Rocher have jumped upwards of 50 per cent in price compared to last year, British consumer champion Which? found.\nRising temperatures and humid weather conditions have stressed and damaged crops in West Africa, which produces more than 70 per cent of the global cocoa supply.\nCocoa prices more than doubled in the last year, from €2,220 per tonne in February 2023 to a record high of €5,490. Sugar prices are also rising.\nMondelez, which owns Easter egg staple Cadbury, has been relying on price increases to counter the surge in cocoa prices. It acknowledged price increases of up to 15 per cent within its chocolate category in 2023. Even higher prices are likely in 2024.\nHow is climate change affecting cacao trees? Cacao farmers have been hit by adverse weather and plant diseases in recent months.\nIvory Coast and its neighbour Ghana together meet more than half of the world’s demand for cacao.\nAs the major cacao season, which began in October 2023, draws to a close at the end of March, some crops have been devastated by fungal black pod disease. Its spread is aided by months of soggy weather.\nAnother major problem in Ghana and Ivory Coast is cacao swollen shoot virus, spread by insects. It is usually dealt with by cutting down infected trees entirely.\nThe wet conditions in West Africa are being blamed for damaging crop yields, which is pushing cacao prices higher.\nFurther pressure came when West Africa was struck by a heatwave in mid-February, which weakened trees already damaged by rainfall. Temperatures breached 40C in some regions, prompting heat warnings in Ghana and Nigeria.\nA study by World Weather Attribution (WWA) – a research group composed of international climatologists – found that last month’s heatwave was made 10 times more likely and 4C hotter by human-caused climate change.\nWhat’s the future of cacao farming in West Africa? Increasing temperatures and declining rainfall are already reducing cacao output – a trend that’s likely to continue into the future.\nIf global warming rises to 2C above pre-industrial levels, devastating heatwaves like the one seen in February will occur around once every two years, according to WWA. They will also become up to 3.4C hotter.\nUnder the current climate, the heatwave was a one-in-10-year event. Without climate change, hot weather events like this would happen less than once every 100 years.\nDrought resistant seeds and regenerative farming techniques could help the industry to cling on.\nBut as climate patterns and regions shift, farmers are also being pushed to higher altitudes to cultivate cacao. This leads to deforestation and ecosystem destruction that further contributes to climate change.\nNew EU deforestation regulations coming in December 2024 could reduce imports from these regions as supply chains are tracked.\nProduction could shift to other regions like South America, though they’re unlikely to fill the gap and could be impacted by similar weather changes.\nIt’s just one outcome of the growing climate crisis and a reminder of the need to urgently reduce human-caused emissions.",
