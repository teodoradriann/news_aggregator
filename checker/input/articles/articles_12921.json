    "text": "O motor de \\\\\\\"Gulu\\\\\\\", a lancha de Ricardo Frediani, ruge cortando as águas do rio Guaíba, que inundou Porto Alegre. Ele segue rumo à devastada Eldorado do Sul. Há previsão de mais chuva e o tempo urge para salvar quem for possível. fotogaleria Enquanto isso, no bairro Medianeira, na mesma localidade, Katiane Mello espera que alguma embarcação a leve até o que um dia foi sua casa.Ela partiu na quinta-feira, dia 2 de maio, quando as chuvas torrenciais que caíram sobre o estado de Rio Grande do Sul fizeram o rio transbordar e a água chegar ao nível do segundo andar, onde vivia com seu marido James Vargas e sua filha Natália, de 5 anos.As águas barrentas do Guaíba registram um incessante ir e vir de embarcações que transportam alimentos para quem se recusa a deixar sua casa apesar do perigo. Uma lancha policial vigia a entrada do bairro submerso.\\\\\\\"A água está baixando pra caramba\\\\\\\"!\\\\\\\", exclama Ricardo, enquanto pede a seu filho Guilherme, estudante de Odontologia de 26 anos, que lhe ajude a estabilizar a lancha com um remo. A vazante causa uma forte corrente porque a água busca uma saída pelas ruas alagadas.Na popa, destaca-se a silhueta moderna de Porto Alegre, a capital estadual de 1,4 milhão de habitantes enlutada por uma tragédia que já ceifou mais de cem vidas. Na proa, a imagem é dramática: casas submersas, carros destruídos, lojas inundadas. fotogaleria Quis o destino As cabeças dos tripulantes passam a menos de um metro dos cabos de energia elétrica, desconectados. Algumas pessoas observam dos telhados. São aqueles que não quiseram sair \\\\\\\"por medo de arrombamentos\\\\\\\", explica à AFP Frediani, um vendedor de lubrificantes de 62 anos que coloca a mão sobre o coração quando perguntado por que arrisca sua própria vida na inundação.Agora \\\\\\\"Gulu\\\\\\\" avança de maneira lenta, desviando dos postes do sistema de energia elétrica inclinados e dos tetos de carros parcialmente cobertos. A resistência da água o obriga a forçar o motor. \\\\\\\"Ontem a corrente não tinha essa força\\\\\\\", conta Frediani.A uns 400 metros é possível ver movimento. Serão moradores ou a polícia? Os muitos socorristas afirmam que houve muitos saques e o local se tornou perigoso. A presença de efetivos de segurança fortemente armados é ostensiva.Katiane está nesse grupo de moradores, no final da rua, com a esperança de conseguir se aproximar de sua casa.\\\\\\\"Gulu\\\\\\\" chega ao destino e Katiane pergunta se é possível caminhar pela água. \\\\\\\"Perdemos o nosso ganha-pão, [...] a loja de conveniência. E a casa...\\\\\\\", conta, interrompendo a fala.Ela poderia ser arrastada pela corrente. Frediani e seu filho oferecem um lugar no barco para ir a sua casa, ou o que tiver sobrado dela.\\\\\\\"A gente não sabe como é que está [a casa] ... Olha a altura [da água]. Jesus Cristo!\\\\\\\", exclama a mulher. fotogaleria Solidariedade na tragédia Katiane não pode conter as lágrimas. A paisagem é de destruição total. Era seu bairro, sua vida e a de sua família. A poucos metros, surge a residência. \\\\\\\"Tá aí! Eles terão arrombado?\\\\\\\".Frediani e seu filho observam a cena em silêncio. Katiane prende a respiração. Alguém a segura até que acontece o que para esta mulher é um milagre... \\\\\\\"Está intacto!\\\\\\\", afirma o marido. James chegou antes. Com a falta de sinal de celular, o marido não conseguiu fazer contato. Ela se lança do barco na água, sobe as escadas e, no caminho, recolhe a roupa jogada, úmida, irrecuperável.Tudo está lá. Ela acreditava que a família tinha perdido o que havia construído com tanto sacrifício. E abraça o marido com força.Nas paredes há fotos da pequena Natália, do casal quando era jovem, de seus pais, hoje idosos e enfermos. Uma placa de madeira diz: \\\\\\\"Amor eterno. Família\\\\\\\".Frediani e seu filho Guilherme sorriem da água, abraçados a \\\\\\\"Gulu\\\\\\\".",

    "title": "Disgraced Republican George Santos Says He 'Always Wanted to Go to a Diddy Party' Before Claiming Kamala Harris Is 'Speculated' to Have Attended",
    "text": "Former New York congressman and convicted felon [George Santos](https://www.latintimes.com/former-us-rep-santos-pleads-guilty-wire-fraud-identity-theft-i-betrayed-trust-my-557987) has claimed [Kamala Harris](https://www.latintimes.com/topics/kamala-harris) is \"speculated to have been in attendance\" at a \"Diddy party or Jay Z party,\" admitting he \"always wanted to go\" to one. On Wednesday, Santos [posted a video](https://x.com/MrSantosNY/status/1849469192833049022) to the platform X (formerly known as Twitter) teasing a \"damning\" story about Kamala Harris which he claimed would \"drop\" Thursday. When Thursday came, he wrote that because of his video, \"the very LARGE publication\" that would presumably drop the story is now \"stressed,\" and may decide to cover the story up. One hour later, he posted his claim that Harris is speculated to have attended Diddy or Jay-Z parties. Reactions varied as commenters wondered if this could be the \"sink shipping\" news Santos alluded to in his previous posts. Some readers happily piled on to the speculation, with one sharing a photoshopped image with Kamala's face attached to a woman standing beside Diddy. Others alluded to various conspiracy theories. Others expressed earnest disappointment at the flimsiness of Santos' insinuation when they were led to believe there would be more substantial news. Many asked Santos if this was the news he hinted at in earlier posts. There were also commenters critical of Santos. Santos has not participated much in the discussion he started, which has led to \"George Santos\" ranking as a trending topic on the platform. He did respond to one commenter who asked if this was the big surprise, insisting that a big news outlet is sitting on more information. The comments, as well as Santos' past, indicate that most people will not be holding their breath for details of his alleged reveal. © 2024 Latin Times. All rights reserved.

    "text": "Geely Automobile announced at a business conference that it will launch the Geely Galaxy M9, a full-size plug-in hybrid SUV, in the domestic market this year. This model will boast a price tag of around 250,000 yuan (34,830 USD). The Galaxy M9 aims to compete with seemingly pricier cars such as the Li Auto L9.\nThe M9 will become the flagship model of the Geely Galaxy new energy vehicle brand under Geely Automobile. This division was formed in 2023, becoming a strong sales driver for the company. This brand delivered 397,125 units from January to June 2025, according to China EV DataTracker. The current model line of the Geely Galaxy comprises ten cars. Soon, this crowded lineup will be broadened by the Galaxy M9 crossover.\nMore about Geely Galaxy M9\nThe Geely Galaxy M9 made its global debut in May 2025 in Milan. However, this model has yet to officially start sales in China. The M9 is a full-size crossover that adopts the brand’s latest “Ripple Aesthetics” design language. It boasts a closed front end with a wide LED strip that joins headlights. The vehicle adopts multi-spoke rims, a flat roofline, a single taillight unit, and conventional door handles.\nThe Geely Galaxy M9’s dimensions are 5205/1999/1800 mm with a wheelbase of 3,030 mm. For clarity, it is 4 mm shorter than the Mercedes-Benz GLS. Geely said that the M9 has the best-in-class in-cabin space utilization rate of 88.3%. It adopts six seats with a 2+2+2 layout. This model is also said to have the highest door opening in the class of 1,165 mm. Its cabin ceiling height reaches 1,317 mm.\nThe center console of the Galaxy M9 adopts a single 30-inch display. There is no instrument cluster inside this vehicle. Instead, it has an augmented-reality head-up display. The gear shifter of the car sits behind a three-spoke steering wheel. Its center tunnel offers a wireless phone charging pad and a couple of cup holders. What is more, the center tunnel could be moved to the second row of passengers.\nThere are two captain’s chairs in the second row. Another fine feature is a ceiling-mounted 30-inch monitor. The third-row seats could be power reclined to 150 degrees. The Galay M9 also offers a built-in 9.1-liter refrigerator and a Flyme Auto sound system. Its chassis adopts a dual-chamber air suspension.\nThe Galaxy M9 adopts the Geely EM Hybrid 2.0 system. It offers a 1.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder for 161 hp paired with two electric motors. The combined power output of the system has yet to be revealed. CarNewsChina expects the M9 to adopt a similar system to the recently revealed Lynk & Co 10 EM-P from Geely. Its combined peak power reached 390 kW (523 hp). The Galaxy M9 will speed up to 100 km/h in 4.5 seconds. Its mixed range reaches 1,500 km.\nGeely Galaxy M9 price\nThe approximate price of the Geely Galaxy M9 was first revealed at the business conference held by Geely in China. It appeared that this vehicle would be priced at around 250,000 yuan (34,830 USD). At the presentation slide, the Geely Galaxy M9 was displayed as a cheaper sibling of the Lynk & Co 900 with a price of around 350,000 yuan (48,770 USD).\nIt is worth mentioning that the Lynk & Co 900 starts at 309,900 yuan (43,180 USD) in China. However, this vehicle has an approximate price level of 350,000 yuan in the slide. It hints that the Geely Galaxy M9 could start at 209,900 yuan (29,250 USD). In this case, the Galaxy M9 will easily become one of the cheapest players in the segment. This car will rival much pricier competitors with new energy powertrain options. We listed their starting prices below.\n- Li L9 – 409,800 yuan (57,100 USD)\n- GAC Hyptec HL – 269,800 yuan (37,600 USD)\n- Aito M9 – 469,800 yuan (65,460 USD)\n- Aito M8 – 359,800 yuan (50,130 USD)\n- Onvo L90 – 279,900 yuan (39,000 USD)\n- Lynk & Co 900 – 309,900 yuan (43,180 USD)\n- Deepal S09 – 229,900 yuan (31,030 USD)\n- Denza N9 – 389,800 yuan (54,330 USD)",
