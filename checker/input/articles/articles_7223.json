    "text": "A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here .\nCNN — Federal prosecutors say New York City Mayor Eric Adams engaged in a “long-running conspiracy,” accepting luxury travel and gifts from foreign businesspeople and at least one Turkish government official.\nAdams, who’s been indicted on five federal public corruption charges , has denied wrongdoing and says he is being targeted because of his positions.\n“I always knew that if I stood my ground for all of you, that I would be a target – and a target I became,” he said in a statement after news of his indictment broke Wednesday night, but before the charges were unsealed Thursday and his official residence, Gracie Mansion, was searched by federal agents.\nFederal agents search Gracie Mansion, the official residence of the mayor of New York City, on September 26, 2024, after Mayor Eric Adams was indicted on federal criminal charges. Timothy A. Clary/AFP/Getty Images That defense – that politics begets legal problems – is a common refrain among the few powerful people charged in federal court with wrongdoing.\nA major platform in former President Donald Trump’s third run for the White House is that he has been unfairly targeted by the Department of Justice. Trump has promised to use the DOJ to go after his political rivals if he is able to win a second White House term in November.\nThat Adams, a Democrat, has been charged by prosecutors in the Southern District of New York on corruption charges does not, on its own, disprove Trump’s point.\nNeither does the recent conviction of former Sen. Bob Menendez , the New Jersey Democrat who was only found guilty after his second, distinct corruption and bribery trial. The first, on completely different charges, ended in a hung jury and a mistrial .\nOne strong piece of evidence against Trump’s “witch hunt” argument is that the same office that is prosecuting Adams and secured a conviction against Menendez ultimately decided in 2021, after Trump left office, not to pursue charges against him for violating campaign finance law with hush money payments to the porn star Stormy Daniels.\nIt was Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, an elected official rather than an appointed prosecutor, who ultimately resuscitated the case by figuring out how to apply state law to federal campaign finance violations. Trump was ultimately convicted of 34 counts of falsifying business records, something for which he will now be sentenced in late November , after the presidential election.\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith, appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland to oversee federal investigations involving Trump, did ultimately pursue federal indictments against the former president for trying to overthrow the 2020 presidential election and for mishandling classified data.\nBoth of those federal prosecutions of Trump have been stalled in federal courts.\nA Trump-appointed judge in Florida dismissed the classified documents case after agreeing with Trump’s attorneys that Smith’s appointment was unconstitutional.\nThe election interference prosecution was delayed while the Supreme Court, a third of which was appointed by Trump, took its time to decide that Trump should get special immunity for things he did while he was president.\nSmith has subsequently amended Trump’s indictment, and on Thursday filed an outline of the case in Washington, DC. Even if Trump’s prosecution in that case doesn’t happen before Election Day, voters may get to see the government’s case before then.\nEarlier this year, after Menendez’s conviction, I updated my ongoing list of federal prosecutions of federal elected officials , which shows a close-to-equal split in prosecutions nationwide since the turn of the century. Adams’ prosecution would not go on the list since he is a city official. The guilty plea of former Rep. George Santos , a Republican, would. The Santos case was prosecuted by a different US attorney’s office in New York.\nCNN’s senior legal analyst Elie Honig is a former assistant US attorney in the Southern District of New York who wrote in his book about the decision not to prosecute Trump. Reacting to the news of the Adams indictment on CNN Wednesday night, Honig noted that the Manhattan-based office now prosecuting Adams is located just a few blocks from the mayor’s office in Lower Manhattan and has a track record of trying corruption cases in recent years.\nVideo Ad Feedback Honig says prosecutors better be 'damn sure' they have enough evidence after charging Adams 03:58 - Source: CNN The Southern District of New York secured a bribery conviction against Sheldon Silver , the former top Democrat in the New York State Assembly, and also Dean Skelos , a Republican who was the majority leader in the New York State Senate.\n“Not to be overly idealistic about it, but the track record shows that the only unifying principle is they look at each case individually, and that’s that,” Honig told me in a phone conversation.\nBut launching the first prosecution of a sitting New York City mayor leaves no margin for error, Honig said.\n“If you’re going to charge the sitting mayor of New York City, you better be damn sure that you have the evidence on him, because if you don’t, it will be a disaster,” he said Wednesday night on CNN.\nAdams remains defiant in the face of the charges, but they are clearly having an effect on New York politics. Key New York Democrats, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , have called on Adams to step down. It is possible that New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, also a Democrat, could remove him from office, but she has not yet publicly taken any steps in that direction.",

Jose Calo’s SUV after a fatal crash on Main Street, Plymouth, on June 25, 2022.\nTimes Leader file photo\nMahon\n❮ ❯ WILKES-BARRE — As James Mahon IV held a large portrait of his father, James J. Mahon III, inside a Luzerne County Courtroom Thursday, a shackled Jose Calo refused to look at the man he “murdered.”\nCalo, 59, of Nanticoke, kept his head down as he was admonished by Mahon IV and his sister, Erin Baress, for taking the life of their father in a drug driving fatal crash on East Main Street, Plymouth, on June 25, 2022.\n“No family should have to go through this process,” Mahon IV said. “Today is a day I’ve been looking forward to since you murdered our dad.”\nCalo was charged by Plymouth police with driving under the influence of fentanyl and crashing into vehicles as he drove recklessly and into oncoming traffic.\nVideo footage showed Calo driving a Ford Explorer and striking Mahon III, 86, who had just exited his vehicle he parked. Mahon III was pinned under his vehicle and was transported to Geisinger Wyoming Valley Medical Center where he died.\nA blood test showed Calo had fentanyl in his system, according to court records.\nMahon IV described his father as a loving and hard working man who worked three jobs in his younger years to support his family. Mahon III became an educator within the Wyoming Valley West School District, a coach, a mentor and volunteered in many civic organizations.\nMahon III extremely enjoyed his grandchildren and great-grandchildren, Baress said.\n“So many people tell me I should forgive you,” Mahon IV said, “You will never hear those words come out of my mouth.”\nMahon IV held up a large portrait of his father showing Calo the man he “murdered” but Calo did not flinch.\n“You are an evil person that needs to be kept away from society,” Mahon IV said, calling Calo an arrogant, selfish person.\nCalo did apologize, although in a soft-spoken voice.\nVough told Calo taking fentanyl and driving was a choice and not an accident before sentencing him to 10 to 20 years in state prison on charges of homicide by vehicle while driving under the influence of a controlled substance, homicide by vehicle, accidents involving death, driving under the influence and driving with a suspended license. Calo pled guilty to the charges April 22.\nMahon IV thanked Plymouth police Capt. Mike Thomas and Assistant District Attorney Daniel Marsh, who prosecuted.\nWhen Calo is eligible at parole in 10 years, Mahon IV pledged to address the state parole board against granting Calo’s release.",

    "text": "Levi Strauss & Co forecast annual sales and profit below Wall Street expectations on Thursday, and said it would cut 10 percent to 15 percent of global corporate jobs as the denim maker seeks to rein in costs amid weakness in its wholesale business.\nShares of the company fell more than 5 percent in extended trading.\nLevi blamed its plan to exit its Denizen brand and cut back on off-price sales this year for the weak forecasts while also missing fourth-quarter revenue estimates.\nThe fallout of an inventory glut last year and a pressured low-income consumer are weighing on the company’s wholesale channel and neutralising the gains in its direct-to-consumer (DTC) business from strong demand from higher-income consumers.\n“The value-conscious consumer is under pressure ... even though we have decent momentum as we enter 2024, our outlook is cautious,” Chief financial and growth officer Harmit Singh said in an interview.\nLevi’s total wholesale business, which accounted for about 62 percent of its net revenues in 2022, saw sales dip 3 percent on a constant-currency basis in the quarter ended Nov. 26.\nThe phase-out of Denizen brand, which is cheaper than the Levi’s brand and sells at a lower margin, will assist the company’s premiumisation plans, expand its assortment of higher-priced denim and add other categories such as athletic wear, Singh said.\nThe layoffs are set to occur in the first half of 2024, and, coupled with more DTC-focused initiatives, would generate net cost savings of $100 million in 2024.\nThe company will take a $110 million to $120 million charge related to the job cuts in the current quarter.\nLevi currently has about 20,000 workers globally, with roughly 5,000 corporate employees.\nThe company projected fiscal 2024 net revenue growth of 1 percent to 3 percent, compared with analysts’ estimate for a 4.7 percent increase to $6.49 billion, according to LSEG data.\nLevi’s expects adjusted per-share profit of $1.15 to $1.25, lower than estimates of $1.33.\nBy Deborah Sophia; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila\nLearn more:\nWhy Levi’s Is Looking Beyond Denim\nAs sales stagnate, new leadership will test whether the 170-year-old brand can become known for more than jeans.",
