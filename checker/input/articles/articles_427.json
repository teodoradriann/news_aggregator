    "text": "Ciudad de México.- Oprah Winfrey ha decidido separarse de la junta directiva de Weight Watchers , después de haber formado parte de la compañía desde 2015, adelantando que donará sus acciones a una buena causa: un museo. Su salida se registra tras admitir a finales de 2023 que usó medicamentos para bajar de peso.\nDe acuerdo con información del portal The Hollywood Reporter (THR), la presentadora de televisión dejó el cargo en la junta directiva de Weight Watchers , en la que ha sido rostro y voz.\nWinfrey accedió a la compañía que ofrece servicios de pérdida y mantenimiento de peso, al pagar 43 millones de dólares por una participación del 10 por ciento, detalló The Washington Post.\nJunto a la salida de la actriz, la compañía informó que Winfrey donará sus acciones al Museo Nacional de Historia y Cultura Afroamericana (por sus siglas en inglés, NMAAHC), en Washington.\n“ Winfrey está haciendo la donación para apoyar el objetivo de NMAAHC de promover y resaltar las contribuciones de los afroamericanos y eliminar cualquier conflicto de interés percibido en torno a su toma de medicamentos para bajar de peso”, se lee en el comunicado, retomado por The Washington Post.\nAunque se confirmó la salida de Winfrey, ella aseguró que continuará colaborando con Weight Watchers, con el propósito de expandir la conversación sobre la obesidad.\n“ Espero seguir asesorando y colaborando con Weight Watchers y la directora ejecutiva Sima Sistani para elevar la conversación sobre el reconocimiento de la obesidad como una enfermedad crónica, trabajar para reducir el estigma y abogar por la equidad en salud.\n“ La salud en el peso es un tema de vital importancia que debe abordarse a una escala más amplia. Planeo participar en una serie de foros y eventos públicos en los que seré una firme defensora del avance de esta conversación”, dijo Oprah en el comunicado.\nEl posicionamiento de la compañía dejó entrever que la divulgación de la toma de medicamentos para bajar de peso pudo ser uno de los motivos, según THR. El acuerdo de salida, también estableció que la empresaria no podrá colaborar con otra compañía del ramo en un plazo fijo.",

These were old (50 years+) river vessels which economic constraints/sanctions had led Russia to attempt to use in open waters, with which they were unable to cope. A more modern Russian cargo ship has sunk in the Western Mediterranean. This vessel was en route from Saint Petersburg to Vladivostok via Suez. For the previous couple of years it had shuttled between the Russian Baltic ports and Syria. Because it was Russian flagged and sailing between Russian controlled ports it had not been subject to effective inspections for seaworthiness; it's sinking is suspected to be due to a catastrophic engine failure and lack of \"damage control \" equipment and procedures. -\n16Mother Dies in Motorcycle-Truck Collision, Four-Month-Old Baby Seriously Injured A crash occurred in Pathum Thani when a motorcycle collided with the rear of a parked six-wheeled truck, resulting in the death of a 32-year-old mother and critical injuries to her four-month-old baby.

Worthwhile topic, @Patong2021. Thank you for posting about it. Increasing discussions of exactly this topic on web sites I follow which focus on food and nutrition. They use terms like \"food inflation\" and \"fiat food\". As a result of inflation in fiat currency, restaurants and manufacturers of food products switching to cheaper ingredients and cheaper processing methods than before. What to do?? 1. I've hired a private cook three years ago. She buys ingredients that I specify and follows recipes I specify. That has worked well, IFF I stick to eating food she prepares for me. 2. Buy ingredients from the best sources I can find in Thailand. We're very fortunate here to have some excellent vendors of quality foods. Three examples are: The Accidental Butcher for beef and lamb. Paleo Robbie for beef plus many kinds of fresh produce and prepared meals. Sloane's for meat and a few prepared foods like savory pies & frozen pizza. Those are in Bangkok, but they all deliver around Thailand by refrigerated truck. I'm in Chiang Mai and frozen meat reliably arrives frozen. 3. More beef: grass fed, hormone-free beef. Eat that, always feel good after eating. Eat something else, never know what to expect. So now eating a lot of quality beef. When I stick to that I feel good. But when I want a change of pace and eat restaurant food, problems, sure. As I am typing this, right now, the time is just after 5 AM. Restless, couldn't sleep -- one symptom. Needed to visit the toilet -- another symptom. Because last night for supper I ordered from a restaurant. A nice restaurant, but still, no joy in the food. Very sad to realize this, because I've enjoyed eating at restaurants most of my life. In younger days, even worked in restaurants. Now, no. Much better to avoid restaurant food and \"ordinary\" retail food such as that from TOPS, BigC, Lotus, etc. And it's going to get worse. -\n207\nIs Earth round or flat❓You and I can climb Everest anytime.

    "text": "A fire that charred 28 acres in hilly terrain near Steele Canyon High School in the Jamul area Wednesday afternoon was reported to be 85% contained by Thursday morning, a fire official said.\nThe blaze, which was reported around 2:10 p.m. off Star Acres Drive near Steele Canyon Road, north of state Route 94, prompted the evacuation of homes in the area.\nThe fire burned an area east of the high school and west of Steele Canyon, said Cal Fire Capt. Robert Johnson. Evacuation orders were lifted Wednesday night, allowing residents to return to their homes.\nThere have been no reports of structures damaged. Johnson said some residents were using hoses to clean fire retardant that had been dropped on their homes the previous day when several helicopters and fixed-wing tankers battled the flames.\n“Crews are still out here working, two hand crews as well as three fire engines,” Johnson said.\nHe said firefighters would work throughout the day, and fire officials expected to get 100% containment by the end of the day.\n“They are not going to leave until we see that all the hot spots within the perimeter are extinguished,” he said.\nThe cause of the blaze remains under investigation.\nOriginally Published: July 10, 2025 at 11:13 AM PDT For the record: A previous version of this story misidentified the Cal Fire captain interviewed.",

    "text": "IDF fighter jets, tanks and artillery attacked in southern Lebanon/IDF Spokesperson\nThe Northern Command today (Thursday) launched a new format of action against Hezbollah, in the framework of simultaneous combined attacks against the organization in terrorist centers. As part of the operations, intelligence marks a terrorist infrastructure area in the heart of a village in southern Lebanon, and the command fire center distributes targets between fighter planes, artillery, tanks and mortars. The fire that is opened simultaneously, in order to increase the effect on the area, is adapted to the type of target: headquarters, weapons depots and bunkers.\nSince the beginning of the war, more than 140 Hezbollah operatives have been killed. This number does not include operatives whom the organization defined as \"out of touch,\" since it has not found their bodies, and another <> Palestinian activists whom it has trained over the past few years and located along the Israeli border.\nCombined IDF attack in southern Lebanon/IDF Spokesperson, IDF Spokesperson\nThe assessments in the defense establishment are that in light of the situation facing Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah, and his commitment to the axis of evil headed by Iran, the regime of the ayatollahs is urging it to continue its war of attrition against the IDF until further notice. Thus, Lebanon has become a playground between superpowers, with American, Russian, and European strings being pulled behind the scenes, especially France. A security source told Walla! The security tension is of concern among countries that have sent their military forces to Lebanon, with the number of UNIFIL forces carrying out operations in the conflict zone.\nAt this stage, the Israeli government expects that the solution between Israel and Hezbollah will eventually be through diplomatic mediation. However, if not, the IDF will act to remove threats from the border in a variety of ways, from expanding the limited campaign to deteriorating into war in an extreme scenario.\nA suggestion not to be missed Advance to the next generation of Tammy4 water bars: smaller, smarter In collaboration with Tami4\nIDF Chief of Staff assessing the situation on the northern border, December 20, 2023/IDF Spokesperson\nAgainst the background of the launches of unmanned aerial vehicles, the use of Kornet missiles with a range of 5 km, rockets of various types, and attempts to penetrate Israel, there is concern in Israel that Hezbollah will try to steal attention in an act of terror. Therefore, the Northern Command tightened its cooperation with the air force in the area, with the various ground forces and with the navy, in order to prepare for extreme scenarios, which could include a raid.\nMeanwhile, today the IDF struck two squads of Hezbollah operatives from the air, one of them an anti-tank squad preparing to launch and another squad that fired rockets from a building. It is still unclear how many Hezbollah operatives were killed in the attacks.\nMore on the subject: Gaza War Iron Sword War Lebanon",

Após eliminar o Sport na terceira fase, o Verdão enfrentará o Osasco Audax, que despachou o Athletico-PR nas oitavas. O duelo ocorrerá às 18h30 (de Brasília).\nSerá o sexto jogo do time alviverde no torneio, todos no campo barueriense. Quem vencer, se garante entre os oito melhores da Copinha e enfrenta, portanto, o vencedor de Grêmio x Red Bull Bragantino.\nOnde assistir A partida entre Audax e Palmeiras terá transmissão da Cazé TV.\nComo chega o Audax Invictos, os Vermelhinhos chegaram ao mata-mata da Copinha na condição de líderes do Grupo 17. Tiveram muitas dificuldades contra o Votoraty, na segunda fase, mas avançaram nos pênaltis (4 a 1) após empate sem gols no tempo normal. Na última terça, o time da Grande São Paulo derrotou por 1 a 0 Furacão, pela terceira fase, em jogo polêmico. Isso porque o gol da vitória foi irregular (gol de mão anotado por Marcos). Assim, o clube paranaense entrou, nesta quinta-feira, com pedido de impugnação da partida.\nComo chega o Palmeiras Também com uma campanha invicta, com as mesmas quatro vitórias e um empate do próximo rival, o Palmeiras tem em Riquelme Fillipi o seu o artilheiro no torneio, com cinco tentos. Foi dele, aliás, um dos gols na classificação diante dos pernambucanos. Até o momento, o Verdão anotou 20 gols e levou dois. Desse modo, segue confiante em busca do tricampeonato nesta temporada – os dois títulos alviverdes da Copinha ocorreram em 2022 e 2023.\nAUDAX x PALMEIRAS 2ª fase da Copa São Paulo de Futebol Júnior\nData e horário : 17/1/2024, às 18h30 (de Brasília)\nLocal: Arena Barueri, em Barueri (SP)\nAUDAX : Tosti; Felipe, Guilherme, Lucas e Pedro Guilherme; Matheo, Caio, Bryan e Michelangelo; Pedro Gomes e Marcos.
