    "title": "Iowa Basketball: Takeaways as Hawkeyes down Nebraska Cornhuskers",
    "text": "The Iowa Hawkeyes made sure to reward the fans that braved the weather and made the trek to Carver-Hawkeye Arena on a frigid, wintry Friday night.\nIowa (10-6, 2-3 Big Ten) got off to a fantastic start, watched it dwindle away and then revved the engines back up and raced away in order to close out an impressive 94-76 win over a good Nebraska team.\nIowa dropped the Huskers to 13-4 (3-3 Big Ten) as six different Hawkeyes finished in double figures, including all five starters.\nLet’s dive into the big takeaways from Iowa’s win over Nebraska.\nIowa erupted early Julia Hansen/Iowa City Press-Citizen / USA TODAY NETWORK\nJust like they did in their first Big Ten win over Rutgers , the Hawkeyes came out roaring against the Huskers. Junior forward Payton Sandfort and redshirt senior forward Patrick McCaffery combined for 13 points and a trio of made 3-pointers in the game’s first six minutes as Iowa leapt out to a 17-2 lead.\nNebraska erased that early 15-point lead and actually jumped in front Dylan Widger-USA TODAY Sports\nIt looked early like the rout might be on. Iowa was getting whatever it wanted offensively and was knocking down shots. As the Hawkeyes kept finding the bottom of the net, Nebraska couldn’t buy a bucket. The Huskers started 1-of-8 from the floor, including 0-for-4 from downtown.\nNebraska settled in, though. The Huskers got a lift from their bench. In particular, freshman guard Eli Rice gave Nebraska a jumpstart. He scored nine points in the first half despite entering the evening averaging just 3.8 points per game. Nebraska had 19 bench points at halftime. Iowa couldn’t keep Nebraska out of the paint either. The Huskers scored 30 points in the paint.\nSuddenly, Iowa’s 15-point lead was just 41-36 at halftime. A quick 12-6 run featuring made 3-pointers from Nebraska senior guard Keisei Tominaga and junior forward Rienk Mast had the Huskers with their first lead of the night.\nThe Hawkeyes rolled away late, though Julia Hansen/Iowa City Press-Citizen / USA TODAY NETWORK\nAfter Nebraska grabbed its second lead of the night at 50-49 with 16:50 to play, Iowa absolutely rolled away from the Huskers. Iowa outscored Nebraska 45-26 from that point forward.\nOwen Freeman is the model of efficiency while collecting a career high Julia Hansen/Iowa City Press-Citizen / USA TODAY NETWORK\nThe freshman big already has a program record five Big Ten Freshman of the Week awards this season. He might be on his way to a sixth.\nOwen Freeman finished with 22 points on 11-of-13 shooting en route to a new career high. The 6-foot-10 frosh from Moline, Ill., also secured another double-double as he finished with 10 rebounds.\nJosh Dix catches fire Julia Hansen/Iowa City Press-Citizen / USA TODAY NETWORK\nAfter making his second career start and his first Big Ten start, Josh Dix followed it up with a big game against the Huskers. The 6-foot-5 sophomore guard knocked down 5-of-7 3-pointers to score 16 points off the Iowa bench.\nPayton Sandfort had another great performance Julia Hansen/Iowa City Press-Citizen / USA TODAY NETWORK\nThe overall shooting numbers maybe don’t reflect it, but Sandfort had himself another very solid night. He finished 6-of-15 from the floor, but he was 5-of-12 from 3-point distance as Sandfort scored 19. His shooting helped set the tone of the night and Sandfort grabbed another double-double after pulling down 10 rebounds and dishing out five assists.\nTony Perkins had a career-high 15 assists Jeffrey Becker-USA TODAY Sports\nIt was a career night for senior guard Tony Perkins, too. Though he shot just 3-of-12, Perkins made up for it with the way he shared the basketball. The 6-foot-4 guard finished with a career-high 15 assists.\nFran McCaffery is tied with Dr. Tom! (Photo by Justin Casterline/Getty Images)\nAfter surpassing Dr. Tom’s Hawkeye record 126 career Big Ten wins with his 127th against Rutgers, Fran McCaffery is now even in the all-time wins column with Tom Davis as well.\nIowa improved to 10-6 (2-3 Big Ten) and, with the win, McCaffery now has 271 wins while leading the Hawkeyes. One more and he will be all alone up top as Iowa’s all-time wins leader.

    "title": "Ecco perché Starlink non è una scelta obbligata",
    "text": "Giorgia Meloni ha definito Starlink una scelta obbligata per le comunicazioni di Stato e dell’esercito. Non è solo una questione di accuratezza, ma di una narrazione che appare intenzionalmente costruita per avallare una decisione che trova più radici nella politica che nella necessità tecnologica.\nTecnologie alternative a Starlink nelle comunicazioni di Stato Partiamo dai fatti. Starlink, il sistema satellitare a bassa orbita sviluppato da SpaceX di Elon Musk , è certamente una tecnologia avanzata, capace di garantire connettività in aree remote e in situazioni di emergenza. Tuttavia, definirlo “obbligato” significa ignorare deliberatamente l’esistenza di alternative, spesso più appropriate per ragioni di sicurezza e sovranità.\nMolti Paesi, infatti, non solo non utilizzano Starlink, ma hanno sviluppato sistemi propri. La Francia si avvale della rete Syracuse , progettata per garantire comunicazioni militari sicure. Il Regno Unito utilizza Skynet , una costellazione di satelliti dedicati alle sue forze armate, mentre la Germania si affida al sistema SATCOMBw . Questi Stati hanno scelto di investire in infrastrutture indipendenti o consorziate, minimizzando la dipendenza da fornitori privati esterni.\nOltre a questo l’Unione europea ha lanciato IRIS ², un ambizioso progetto per una costellazione di satelliti che garantirà comunicazioni sicure per governi e cittadini, riducendo la dipendenza tecnologica da potenze esterne. Con i primi lanci previsti nel 2029 e la piena operatività entro il 2030, IRIS² rappresenta una soluzione concreta per l’autonomia europea.\nA fianco dei sistemi satellitari, molti Paesi europei adottano tecnologie complementari per garantire comunicazioni sicure e resilienti. I sistemi SATCOM (comunicazione satellitare) forniscono una copertura globale indispensabile per operazioni in aree remote, permettendo trasmissioni criptate di dati, voce e video essenziali per la pianificazione strategica. Parallelamente, le Reti Mobili Ad Hoc ( MANET ) si distinguono per la loro flessibilità: sono reti decentralizzate e autoconfiguranti che si adattano rapidamente ai cambiamenti ambientali, risultando ideali per operazioni sul campo dove l’infrastruttura tradizionale è assente o inaffidabile.\nLa scelta italiana e le implicazioni geopolitiche Quindi, perché l’Italia dovrebbe legarsi a una realtà come Starlink? Una possibile risposta si trova nelle relazioni politiche di Meloni. Non è un segreto che la Presidente del Consiglio abbia sviluppato un rapporto di cordialità con Elon Musk. Dichiarazioni reciproche e incontri pubblici hanno alimentato l’idea di una sintonia su temi come l’innovazione tecnologica. Meloni nega che questo sia il motivo della sua scelta. Noi legittimamente ne dubitiamo.",

    "title": "Search underway for man who fell into Mohawk River | News | dailygazette.com",
    "text": "FORT HUNTER — The search for a 31-year-old man who fell into the Mohawk River near Erie Canal Lock 12 earlier in the day was suspended as darkness fell Thursday night with agencies expected to return Friday morning, according to Montgomery County Sheriff Jeffery Smith. The man’s name will not be released until after he has been located and the family has been informed, Smith said. Officials remained in contact with relatives throughout the search. “We’re staying in communication, we updated them with everything that’s taken place. We’re there for them if they need something,” Smith said. “Obviously, it’s very difficult not knowing and going through this experience. Our hearts and thoughts are with them. We are doing everything we can to ease that pain short term at least.” Multiple agencies were on scene assisting with the search throughout the day after the county 911 dispatch center received a report of a man who had fallen over the wall at Lock 12 into the river on Thursday around 11:35 a.m. The incident and multi-agency search operation in the area were first reported by [news gathering partner CBS6 Albany](https://cbs6albany.com/news/local/heavy-police-activity-at-lock-12-closes-main-street-and-bridge-drone-in-use). Smith and a patrol sergeant arrived on scene within two and a half minutes followed by additional units. They requested further resources after scouring the banks and locating witnesses. Individuals at the scene told officials the man had been fishing when his line got caught and his pole slipped from his hand. He fell into the water as he bent down trying to retrieve it, Smith said. One of the individuals attempted to throw the man a life ring provided at the site by the state Canal Corporation, but it was unsuccessful. “They attempted everything,” Smith said. There is a strong current near the lock from the river and the movable dams due to the difference in elevation, according to the sheriff. “We always encourage people, any time you're near a water edge or near the water, wear a life preserver. It's the best thing you can do. It increases your chances drastically should you fall in,” Smith said. First responders from agencies across the region assisted in the search involving divers, drones, sonar and swift water rescue resources on Thursday until around 8:30 p.m. when nightfall made it unsafe to continue. They will resume the search Friday around 7 a.m. “There were probably 50 people on scene all working diligently from different agencies,” Smith said. The area around Lock 12 was closed to vehicle and boat traffic on Thursday due to the police activities in the vicinity. Main Street in both Fort Hunter and Tribes Hill were closed to all traffic throughout the day before reopening following the suspension of the search. The Erie Canal from Lock 11 in Amsterdam to Lock 12 has been closed to navigation due to the police activities. Boaters should plan their trips accordingly, according to the Canal Corporation. Assistance at the scene was provided by personnel from state police, Fulton County Sheriff’s Office, Saratoga County Sheriff’s Office, Montgomery County Emergency Services, Fulton County Emergency Services, Swiftwater Rescue Team, state Department of Environmental Conservation, state Office of Fire Prevention and Control, Lake Valley EMS, Montgomery County Ambulance and fire departments from Fort Hunter, Tribes Hill and Florida. This is a developing story and will be updated as details becomes available. -",

    "text": "Josh Gravette named executive director of Nir Family YMCA branch WILMINGTON, N.C. (WECT) - Josh Gravette has been named the new executive director of the Nir Family YMCA on Market Street, per a YMCA announcement on Thursday, April 4. He was previously executive director at Southside Virginia Family YMCA for the past five years, overseeing donations and funding allocations. “Fiscal management and making sure we are using our dollars to have the best impact is a huge part of what we do at the Y — whether it be ordering the correct machines, making better use of space, or growing our programs,” said Gravette. “Being able to analyze how we can best support our members and community is important.” Gravette is from Virginia and has a bachelor’s degree in biology from the University of Virginia and a master’s degree in human genetics from Tulane University. After working in food testing, he shifted careers to work as a lifeguard at the YMCA of Central Virginia. “It did not take long for Gravette to fall in love with the Y’s mission and, within just a few years, he expanded his role to include bus transportation. He picked up students from school, took them to swim lessons, served them healthy snacks, and dropped them off at home. Gravette knew he was making a meaningful difference in the lives of these children and enjoyed watching them gain confidence around the water,” a YMCA announcement states. He later became aquatics director and created a second-grade swim lesson program and a water safety curriculum to fight drowning deaths. “With every position, I give it my all,” said Gravette. “I’d love to be able to look back and know that we did everything we could, that our team pushed, to serve this community, impact more youth, and grow our programs.” Copyright 2024 WECT.
