    "title": "The Story of Hannah Gutiar: Surviving the Iranian Missile Attack in Erbil, Kurdistan",
    "text": "2024-01-20 20:30:46\nHannah Gutiar, the wife of the Kurdish businessman, Beshro Dizi, who was killed in a missile bombing launched by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, on Erbil in the Kurdistan region of Iraq, recounted what she went through at the time of the bombing of their house, which Tehran claimed was the headquarters of the Israeli Mossad.\nAlong with her husband, her daughter was killed in the bombing, as well as a guest he had and his housekeeper, and their other two sons were injured:\nDuring a visit by an official Iraqi delegation to the hospital where she was receiving treatment for her injury, Hata Gutiar said: “We, as a family of five, live a life full of love in Erbil, and on the day of the fateful attack, the atmosphere was calm in our house, as I was on the top floor with two young ones, a boy and a girl. They were accompanied by two nannies, while my husband, Bishro, was with his friend Karam, who came from Baghdad, and my eldest son, Roj.”\n“After the meal, suddenly, as if in a dream, the roof of the house began to droop towards me, and I began to hear a quiet voice reciting verses from the Holy Qur’an. At that moment, I realized that I had read the Shahada, and I began to wonder about my existence and what was happening around me.”\nThe grieving wife continues: “An unfamiliar voice called my name, saying: Doctor, help us and get down, put your foot down. I thought for a moment that I might be among the dead, and in a flash, I found myself in a non-existent state.” Then she woke up to realize that she was in the hospital.\nLast Monday, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard carried out a missile attack on what it described as an Israeli “spy headquarters” in a neighborhood near the US Consulate complex in Erbil.\nIraqi and Kurdish sources denied the presence of a Mossad headquarters in this region, and Masrour Barzani, Prime Minister of the Iraqi Kurdistan region, said in a press conference while attending the Davos Economic Forum that “there is no reason to justify launching these attacks, and they will not go unanswered.”\nQasim Al-Araji, the Iraqi National Security Advisor, also confirmed, when he inspected the site of the attack in Erbil, that the allegations about targeting a Mossad headquarters were baseless.\nFollowing the attack on Erbil, the Iraqi Foreign Ministry summoned the Iraqi ambassador to Tehran, Naseer Abdul Mohsen, for consultations.\nIraq also lodged an official protest before the UN Security Council and the United Nations against the Iranian attack on Erbil, considering the attack a blatant violation of Iraq’s sovereignty and security.\n1705794665\n#wife #Kurdish #businessman #victim #Iranian #bombing #recounts #happened",

    "text": "AI, the story of the year, told in numbers\nRead More\nNo doubt about it, the whole world had its eyes on artificial intelligence in 2023.\nThe groundbreaking tech touched every industry, from agriculture and medicine to retail, food, and finance. We feared its impact on our livelihoods and revered its ability to generate images, text, sound, and data as well as — or better than — any human.\nLet’s take a look back through the key numbers:\n1m+: The number of people who\nused ChatGPT within its first five days. Now, a year after the generative AI chatbot’s launch, 100m people use ChatGPT weekly and 2m+ developers are using the company’s API, including most Fortune 500 companies.\n$1T: The market cap Nvidia\nhit back in May (it currently stands at $1.2T). The chipmaker’s meteoric rise was largely fueled by tech companies of all sizes racing to add AI features to their products.\n15: The number of tech companies that have\nagreed to abide by the Biden administration’s AI safeguards. The voluntary commitments, made by many of the major AI companies, aim to advance the technology in a safer, more secure way.\n$10B: The amount of money Microsoft\npledged to invest in OpenAI over the coming years, on top of the $3B it had previously invested, as the tech giant looks to keep up with AI.\n$113.5m: The seed round\nraised by AI startup Mistral, just one month after launching and before its first product was even developed. It was the biggest seed round ever recorded in Europe.\n$6B: The combined investment made by\nAmazon and\n4.4%: The\nestimated adoption rate for businesses using AI to produce goods or services. While ~50% of S&P 500 earnings calls have referenced AI since May — on par with mentions of interest rates and the Federal Reserve — the hype isn’t trickling down to everyday use cases.\n4: The number of days it took Sam Altman to get fired and rehired as CEO of OpenAI.\nBusiness and tech news in 5 minutes or less\nIn 1994, Jeff Bezos discovered a shocking stat: Internet usage grew 2,300% per year.\nData shows where markets are headed.\nAnd that’s why we built Trends — to show you up-and-coming market opportunities about to explode.

    "text": "Embalado por seis vitórias seguidas na Superliga Feminina, o Fluminense dá uma pausa na competição para jogar as quartas de final da Copa Brasil. O Tricolor enfrenta o Gerdau Minas nesta quinta-feira (16/01), às 21h, na Arena UniBH, em Belo Horizonte (MG). A partida terá transmissão ao vivo no Sportv 2.\nA competição envolve as oito melhores equipes do primeiro turno da Superliga e dará ao vencedor uma vaga na Supercopa 2025 e no Sul-Americano de Clubes 2026. Os duelos de quartas de final serão realizados em jogo único e quem levar a melhor nesta quinta-feira enfrentará o vencedor de Osasco São Cristóvão Saúde e Batavo Mackenzie.\nO Fluminense garantiu sua vaga na Copa Brasil com a sexta colocação no primeiro turno da Superliga. A equipe somou 21 pontos em 11 jogos. Já o Minas se classificou no terceiro lugar, com 25, e, devido à melhor campanha, ficou com o mando de quadra.\nBicampeã da competição e nove vezes campeã da Superliga, a ponteira Amanda Campos falou sobre o foco da equipe neste momento de decisão.\n“Todo mundo quer estar em decisões, então tanto o nosso time quanto o delas se preparam para esses momentos. É um jogo duro, mas sabemos do nosso treinamento e foco. Estamos trabalhando forte, unidas e temos noção da importância de colocarmos o nosso jogo em prática, dar 200% na quadra e ter resiliência e paciência. Estamos focadas para fazer um excelente jogo”.\nEsta é a oitava participação do Fluminense na competição. Desde que começou a disputar a Superliga, na temporada 2016/2017, o Tricolor ficou de fora apenas da edição de 2021 e, em suas duas últimas participações, em 2024 e 2023, teve as suas melhores campanhas ao chegar à semifinal.\nA fase final da competição, semifinal e final, será realizada no Centro Multiuso de São José, em São José, Santa Catarina, nos dias 6 e 7 de fevereiro.\nTexto: Comunicação/FFC\nFotos: Mailson Santana/FFC",

    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Former U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday joined an effort by a co-defendant in his Georgia election interference case to disqualify prosecutor Fani Willis and dismiss the criminal charges, according to a court filing.\nTrump co-defendant Michael Roman has alleged in previous court filings that Willis had an inappropriate relationship with Nathan Wade, the lawyer she hired to help run the criminal case.\nTrump's defense team endorsed those claims and leveled new accusations that Willis, the district attorney of Fulton County, \"inappropriately injected race into the case and stoked racial animus\" during a speech responding to Roman's allegations.\nWillis, during an address this month at a historically Black church in Atlanta, questioned why Wade, who is Black, had come under scrutiny and not two other special prosecutors assigned to the probe, who are white.\n\"I’m a little confused. I appointed three special counsel, as is my right to do,\" Willis said, according to a transcript of the speech included in the filing. \"They only attack one.\"\nTrump's filing said Willis' comments risk improperly turning potential jurors against the defendants in the case. Trump and 14 of his political allies are facing racketeering and other charges for allegedly plotting to overturn Trump's 2020 election loss in Georgia to Democrat Joe Biden, which he falsely claims was the result of fraud.\nTrump is the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination.\nRoman previously sought to dismiss the case and disqualify Willis and her office, accusing Willis of financially benefiting from an alleged romantic relationship with Wade. Willis' office has paid Wade more than $650,000 for his work on the case, records show.\nWillis has not yet responded to the allegations in court.\nA judge has scheduled a Feb. 15 hearing on the issue.\n(Reporting by Eric Beech and Andrew Goudsward; editing by Rami Ayyub and Scott Malone)",

    "text": "7月8日至9日，记者重返遭遇“6·17”严重洪涝灾害的广东省肇庆市怀集县。当初被洪水围困、淤泥堆积的街道，如今已整洁如常，群众生活重回正轨。随着水、电、交通等基础设施的恢复、清淤工作的完成，工农业复产也按下快进键。\n拼版照片，上下图分别是6月19日和7月9日拍摄的怀集县城一十字路口画面。新华社记者邓华/钟焯 摄\n“当时洪水来得急，水位上涨极快！”怀集县中洲镇中心村村支书梁可梓指着墙上近2米高的洪痕，对洪水袭来时的景象仍心有余悸。“好在及时转移了人员、物资，人都平安。”他说，现在村里在抓紧抢修被损毁的灌排农渠，不能误了晚稻的播种。\n梁可梓滑动着手机里的视频、照片介绍道，洪峰过境后，当地干部群众与各地救援队伍一起，对全村道路和房屋进行了清淤消毒工作。对一些短时间内无法返回自家居住的村民，村委会提供相应的住宿安排。\n“我两天前才把家里全部收拾好，现在已经搬回来住了。”在中心村受灾较严重的村民梁波家中，洪水曾漫到房屋二楼。现在房屋内已基本打扫干净，更换了新的床和被子，洗干净的衣服晾晒在太阳下。在整洁的厨房里，梁波连声招呼记者：“喝杯热茶！”\n梁波说，村委会的人常来帮忙清理淤泥，供电局也来人更换了泡水的电闸。\n灾害发生后，南方电网广东电网公司立刻投入4000余人抢修队伍，以及76台应急发电车、21台排涝装备、2台水陆两栖车、237台应急通信装备、17台应急照明装备开展抢修复电，60小时内全面恢复怀集受影响用户供电，保障了灾区人民群众的用电需求。\n在怀集县中洲镇的农贸市场上，商贩正在售卖猪肉、水果等。街边的小店重整一新，不少村民正购买日用品和农副产品，街上车来车往，一派热闹景象。\n7月8日，怀集县中洲镇的居民在街上采买水果。新华社记者钟焯 摄\n“洪水一退，我们立马开始清淤、打扫店内卫生，6月25日就已重新开业。很多村民要来我们店购买农副产品，所以要抓紧开门。”中洲镇一商店老板文则年说。\n群众生活逐步回归正常，生产也在加快恢复。\n怀集县农业农村局相关负责人介绍，为加快灾后复产，除指导农户采取有效补救措施外，还组织社会化服务组织对农作物开展统防统治，根据农作物生长情况喷洒叶面肥，尽最大努力提高粮食产量，弥补因灾损失。目前已开展水稻统防统治超万亩，喷洒叶面肥5600多亩，大部分受灾水稻有望恢复至接近正常产量水平。\n在怀集大岗镇的深农农场内，一辆拖拉机正在进行土地耕整工作。“洪水导致我们1600亩地受到影响，玉米等农作物面临绝收。保险的及时赔付带来了重启的资金‘活水’，我们赶紧进行土地耕整，重新播种农作物。”农场负责人杨志伟说。\n7月8日，深农农场内一辆拖拉机正在进行土地耕整作业。新华社记者钟焯 摄\n中华财险肇庆中心支公司总经理助理李杰荣说，洪水发生后，公司立刻成立应急处置工作小组，为参保农户、农企高效定损，快速赔付，助其解决燃眉之急。目前，已对接报的154件案件完成查勘工作，累计赔付金额199.77万元，其中预赔付金额53万元。\n怀集金融监管支局相关负责人表示，已督导保险机构畅通理赔绿色通道，助力复工复产。截至7月8日，全县已接到财险报案2752宗，预计赔付11436.7万元，已赔付8055.23万元。\n伴随着机械的轰鸣声，当地因洪水受灾的工厂也恢复了往日的忙碌。在以茶秆竹产业为主的坳仔镇，此次洪水导致当地多个加工厂受损。在怀集县恒汇竹制品有限公司，记者看到这里的生产忙而有序，一些工人正在进行茶秆竹的切割、编扎、打包等工序。\n“由于洪水把机器马达泡坏了，我们第一时间购买了新的马达，洪水过境后三四天就恢复了生产。我们出口订单很多，接下来要抓紧时间赶进度交货。”公司负责人陈红玲说。\n在怀集县城街道上，沿街商铺基本已重新开门营业。采访间，当地居民说的最多的就是“向前看”。\n7月8日，怀集县商业步行街的夜市。新华社记者钟焯 摄\n夜幕降临，商业步行街的夜市小摊陆续开张，往来的食客络绎不绝，升腾起浓浓烟火气。（记者胡拿云、钟焯）\n关于中工网 | 版权声明 | 违法和不良信息举报电话：010-84151598 | 网络敲诈和有偿删帖举报电话：010-84151598\nCopyright © 2008-2025 by www.workercn.cn. all rights reserved",
