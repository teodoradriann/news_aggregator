    "title": "BE:FIRST’s Agency BMSG Promotes a Sustainable Vision for Japanese Music",
    "text": "On Feb. 13, 2024, BMSG, Inc. made waves in the Japanese music industry with their statement, “BMSG’s Recommendations for Pulling the Music Industry Back from the Brink of Unsustainability.” The announcement discussed the problems of Japan’s music industry, which still heavily relies on CD sales. One of the issues discussed was how this reliance on physical media has led to people purchasing multiple copies of the same CD, contributing to the generation of excessive waste. BMSG declared its commitment to taking action to change the music industry’s structure and minimize CD waste.\nMrs. GREEN APPLE’s ‘Lilac’ Reaches No. 1 After 14 Weeks on Japan Hot 100\nThe announcement highlighted that the bulk-purchasing of CDs has been a longstanding issue, sparking debate for over a decade. The fact that this announcement came from BMSG, a record label and management agency home to dance and vocal groups with passionate fandoms, created a huge stir, both inside and outside the industry.\nIn a revealing interview in The Quiet Revolution of Billboard Japan , published on Feb. 20, SKY-HI, CEO of BMSG, Inc., elaborated on the issues highlighted in the company’s recent announcement. Seiji Isozaki, the book’s author and chart director for Billboard Japan, shared his insights from the conversation.\n“It was my first time meeting SKY-HI in person, but I’d heard a lot about what he’d said and done before. Some of his activities involved the hit charts, and I found them really thought-provoking. They motivated me in creating the Japanese charts. I thought that discussing the charts with him would offer insights into the artists’ perspectives on chart changes and allow for a multifaceted exploration of issues surrounding hit charts.”\n“Meeting him in person, what I felt was his flexible stance on living in the present. At Billboard Japan, we’ve also continued to think about the limits and possibilities of the current music industry through our efforts with the hit charts. Although our positions are different, I strongly felt that he had also been grappling with the same issues, and it was a very encouraging dialogue.”\nAt the April BMSG convention, members of the entertainment industry watched SKY-HI’s presentation, where he reinforced the company’s commitment to these sustainability recommendations. Through the presentation, which was later streamed on YouTube, SKY-HI spoke directly about the recommendations, sharing them with the rest of the world.\nBE:FIRST’s concept single, “Masterplan,” released on April 24, was the first project to embody BMSG’s sustainability proposal. The single comes in a paper sleeve to reduce the amount of plastic generated by CD production. BMSG also eliminated retailer-specific add-ons — collectibles that come with CDs sold by specific music retailers that are randomly packaged with CDs, both of which drive bulk CD purchasing. Due to these decisions, the number of CDs shipped during the period from April 24 to May 22 fell by roughly 70,000, but total sales of singles and single-related merchandise, including merchandise featuring the single’s art, roughly doubled. Using paper sleeves cut plastic usage during the CD production phase by 10 tons and reduced the amount of associated CO2 emissions by 59 tons.\nThe title track, “Masterplan,” made a splash by debuting at the top of Billboard Japan’s Hot 100 song chart. The album’s solid chart results demonstrated that it’s possible to take the number one position without relying on the bulk purchasing of CDs by fans or retailer-specific add-ons.\nGARNiDELiA Demonstrates Its Worldwide Presence at Opening Night of World Tour 2024 -TEN- [MAKUAKE]\n“When we think about what makes a hit,” said Isozaki, “it’s important to look at how the hit charts are structured and how valid those charts are—whether those charts resonate with people. Getting to know the evolving Billboard charts in the US and the individuals shaping their evolution, I’ve come to deeply appreciate the significant responsibility we bear.”\n“In the U.S., in the early ’90s, Nielsen Music (now Luminate) succeeded in collecting point-of-sale data from record stores across the country. Until then, data had been generated based on the results of fax and telephone surveys. The shift to this new, objective data collection method revolutionized the Billboard Hot 100 lineup overnight. The changes came as quite a shock, both inside the industry and out, and profoundly transformed what it means to be a hit. One thing we find very impressive is how Billboard’s charts have been able to keep resonating with people in the same way by constantly making adjustments, adding new data such as downloads and streaming plays.”\n“In the early 2010s, Japan saw a surge in fan-driven bulk purchases due to customer participation activities. The phenomenon brought renewed attention to the practices of the music charts. This raised a dilemma. On the one hand, we needed to recognize the support that fans provided artists by bulk-buying their music. On the other hand, we also needed to ensure that our charts resonated with the broader audience so as to accurately represent which songs were true hits. And, no matter what, our charts should never incentivize unsustainable fan behavior that leads to burnout. So, since the mid-2010s, we’ve been meticulously adjusting the charts weekly to strike just the right balance. These adjustments have gradually reshaped Japan’s definition of a hit song.”\n“Today, purchasing multiple copies of the same track has minimal impact on the hit charts. Fans desire longevity in their favorite artists’ careers. SKY-HI’s proposal invites us all to consider how fan activities in Japan can sustainably support artists.”\nBMSG says that BE:FIRST’s initiatives are just the beginning of an ongoing effort to improve the sustainability of Japan’s music industry. On July 1, the South Korean boy band ATEEZ and BE:FIRST released their collaborative single, “Hush-Hush.” As BMSG sets its sights on the international arena, it is extending its reach beyond Japan’s borders. The full impact of these moves on the music industries of Japan and the wider world remains to be seen, yet it is evident that BMSG is steadfast in meeting these challenges.\nThis article by Seiji Isozaki and Maiko Murata first appeared on Billboard Japan.\nBillboard Korea’s CEO Yuna Kim on Embracing Strong Female Leadership In Korea\nSource: Billboard Japan",

    "title": "Is there porn on TikTok?",
    "text": "Is There Porn on TikTok?\nTikTok has taken the world by storm, becoming one of the most popular social media platforms globally. With over a billion active users, the platform has become a go-to destination for short-form videos on a vast array of topics. But, with such vast content, comes the natural concern – is there porn on TikTok? In this article, we’ll delve into the issue, explore the platform’s approach to adult content, and provide insight into what you can do to ensure your safety on the app.\nDirect Answer: Is There Porn on TikTok?\nYes, there is pornographic content on TikTok. While the platform is known for its strict guidelines on what constitutes appropriate content, sexualized videos and images still find their way onto the platform.\nWhy Is Porn Allowed on TikTok?\nSo, why does TikTok allow any explicit content at all? The main reason is that the platform takes a more hands-off approach to moderating adult content compared to other social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook. TikTok allows sexualized content if it is 1) artfully creative, 2) non-explicit, or 3) transformative (TikTok Community Guidelines). What this means is that as long as the content is not explicit, offensive, or meant to be explicit, it can remain on the platform.\nTypes of Adult Content on TikTok\nWhile explicit content may be removed, there are still various types of adult content that can be found on TikTok, including:\n• Sensual or suggestive videos : These videos are meant to be titillating without showing explicit content.\n• Stripping or partial nudity : Although partial nudity may not be in the classical sense of \"nudity,\" it can still be arousing.\n• Dance performances : While not explicit, some dance performances may be sexually suggestive.\nTikTok’s Approach to Moderating Adult Content\nTikTok’s approach to moderating adult content is multi-layered:\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) powered moderation : TikTok uses AI to scan videos and remove explicit or inappropriate content.\nHuman Moderators : Trained human moderators review videos that have triggered the AI system, making decisions about whether they violate the platform’s guidelines.\nCommunity Guidelines : TikTok community guidelines outline what is allowed and what is not.\nRemoving Explicit Content\nWhile TikTok strives to keep explicit content to a minimum, the platform removes content :\n• Upon reports : If a user reports an account or a video as inappropriate, TikTok’s moderators take immediate action.\n• Automated algorithms : AI-powered algorithms scan and remove content that is deemed explicit.\nTable: Types of Adult Content Allowed on TikTok\nType\nDefinition\n1. Artful Creativity\nSexualized content that is creative and meant to be artistic, not explicit\n2. Non-Explicit\nSensual or suggestive content that is not graphic or offensive\n3. Transformative\nContent that is not meant to be explicit, but still sexual or arousing\nWhat to Do to Ensure Your Safety on TikTok\nIf you’re concerned about explicit or inappropriate content on TikTok, here’s what you can do:\n• Use age verification : If you’re under 18, TikTok will ask you for verification to ensure you’re using the app responsibly.\n• Report questionable content : If you encounter explicit or inappropriate content, report it to the app using the in-app report button.\n• Adjust your settings : Adjust your TikTok settings to receive warnings or restrict explicit content visibility.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, there is indeed pornographic content on TikTok. Although the platform takes steps to moderate content, sexualized videos and images still exist on the platform. However, by reporting inappropriate content, using age verification, and adjusting your settings, you can minimize your exposure to adult content and ensure a safer and more enjoyable TikTok experience.",

    "title": "Chicago Cubs, Kyle Tucker Avoid Arbitration With Monster Contract for 2025",
    "text": "Chicago Cubs, Kyle Tucker Avoid Arbitration With Monster Contract for 2025\nIt feels like ages ago since the Chicago Cubs pulled off a shocker and acquired superstar slugger Kyle Tucker from the Houston Astros in what was pricy but fair trade deal.\nWhile Jed Hoyer had to part ways with one of his best prospects in addition to sending out 2024 All-Star Isaac Paredes and versatile pitcher Hayden Wesneski, the ability to have Tucker in this lineup for even just one year seems worth it when considering how long it's been since the Cubs were in the playoffs.\nOf course, the organization would love to ink him to a long-term contract.\nWith him being the face of this franchise alongside some of their star prospects coming up through the pipeline, the future would look a whole lot brighter in Chicago.\nThat could ultimately prove to be difficult since Juan Soto signed the richest contract in sports history this winter and Tucker could be looking at something in the $400 million range based on what he's done at this point in his career, but the Cubs still have to try.\nThe first step towards getting a long-term deal worked out is handling arbitration, something both parties were able to do before this had to go to a hearing.\nWhile this doesn't guarantee anything regarding Tucker now choosing to not hit the open market and instead re-signing with Chicago, handling things in this manner certainly is something that won't come back to haunt the front office.\nIf the Cubs were to haggle their new player over dollars and cents, that would be a back look.\nBut, that's not how they went about things.\nNow, Tucker is getting paid a monster $16.5 million salary to play in Chicago, and with the finances all straightened out, he's heading to the fan convention which will give him an idea of what it's like to play for this franchise.\nThe Cubs handled things the right way with Tucker's arbitration.\nHopefully it helps them get something even more lucrative done.",
