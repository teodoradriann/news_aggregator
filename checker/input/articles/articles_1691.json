    "title": "Govt launches 24/7 transport facility for Pakistani Hajj pilgrims in Makkah",
    "text": "The Ministry of Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony has launched a comprehensive 24/7 transportation plan, involving 300 luxury buses, for Pakistani Hajj pilgrims to shift them directly from their residences to the Haram Sharif in Makkah, Saudi Arabia. The bus service is available round-the-clock in order to provide Hajj pilgrims with the flexibility to travel at their convenience, read a statement issued by the ministry. The all-time available, bus service aims at alleviating the inconvenience of the pilgrims allowing them to focus on their worship and spiritual journey. Bus stops have been constructed at four entry points surrounding the Haram to ensure efficient and organised transportation. Ensuring a smooth flow of traffic and minimising congestion in the area, these designated stops serve as pick-up and drop-off locations for pilgrims. The government has assigned guides to assist pilgrims throughout their journey to further enhance the travel experience. These guides help pilgrims travel through their designated routes, ensuring that they reach their destination without any difficulties. To address any concerns or queries the pilgrims may have, the guides also provide valuable information and support to them. Last week, two planes of Saudi Airlines landed at the King Abdulaziz International Airport carrying 720 intending Pakistani Hajj pilgrims from Karachi and Islamabad under the Road to Makkah Initiative. As they stepped out of the planes, donning their Ihram and reciting the Talbiyah, their voices echoed with longing: “Labbaik Allahuma Labbaik (Here I am, O Allah, here I am!), Labbaik La Sharika Laka Labbaik (Here I am, no partner do You have, here I am), Inna Al-Hamda Wan-Ni’mata Laka Wal-Mulk (Indeed, all praise, grace, and sovereignty belong to You), La Sharika Lak! (No partner do You have).” The guests of Allah Almighty were greeted with a warm welcome, showered with rose petals and presented bouquets, drinks, dry fruits and a variety of dates. The supporting staff of the Pakistan Hajj Mission was actively present at the airport to provide any kind of assistance to Pakistani Hajj pilgrims. Under the Road to Makkah initiative, the passengers directly left their hotels avoiding long queues at the immigration counters, and their luggage was shifted automatically to their hotel residences. From May 24 to June 9, as many as 114 flights will be operating to airlift 34,422 Pakistanis from their major cities to Jeddah. Weather in next 24 hours will remain extremely hot and humid in the port city, says PMD An FIA cyber crime team reached Adiala jail late Thursday night to interrogate Imran Khan over his tweet “TikTok videos affect the performance of the police ,” reads the order “If you like the decision then a judge is fine but if you dislike the verdict then a judge becomes black sheep.” \"FIA's cyber wing will speak to four people from the PTI on this issue,\" say sources PMD records highest maximum temperature — 51°C — in Jacobabad, 50°C in Lasbela",

    "title": "The ‘Star Wars’ Video Game That Rewards Obsession",
    "text": "The oft-repeated story of Star Wars: Rogue Squadron ’s inception is that it was inspired by the first level of 1996’s Shadows of the Empire , in which players take control of a snow speeder during The Empire Strikes Back ’s Battle of Hoth. In reality, developer Factor 5 had been pitching the game for years. Not as a Star Wars game, but as a sequel to LucasArts’ (now Lucasfilm Games) Rescue on Fractalus!\nWith the Nintendo 64 on its way, the team stepped up its efforts. “Of course, LucasArts comes out with Shadows of the Empire ,” Julian Eggebrecht, co-founder of Factor 5 and project lead on Rogue Squadron , tells me. “What we wanted to do with Rogue Squadron , what became Rogue Squadron , was much more sophisticated than that.”\nThe result was a game built around short, sharp missions designed to be optimized through repetitive play. Something amplified by a multilayered progression system that saw the player presented with medals for completing levels to a certain standard, which in turn influenced ranks and led to unlockable rewards.\nNow 25 years old, Rogue Squadron still stands up as a game that revels in its players’ obsession. As a child in 1999, I spent months carefully teasing the variables to hone my performance and truly complete the game. In a year replete with remarkable games, it was Rogue Squadron that kept me the most engaged. “It definitely has this addictiveness,” Eggebrecht says. “And we were going for that! We were going for that brutality!”\nTo get there, however, took an equally brutal development cycle — the majority of which was devoted to learning to fly. “Everyone assumed Shadows of the Empire figured it out — not at all,” Eggebrecht says. He and LucasArts project lead Mark Haigh-Hutchinson agreed flight in Rogue Squadron needed to be simpler and more accessible.\nHaigh-Hutchinson, who passed away in 2008, took on the task himself, having previously developed the controls and camera for Shadows of the Empire ’s snow speeder. “Mark almost lost his mind over it, because it was hard — it was really, really hard,” Eggebrecht says. “He took a full year of working just on the frickin’ X-wing!”\nThat development was made precipitously more difficult by the Nintendo 64’s primitive infrastructure. With its limited hardware, every N64 game feels like a technical marvel in hindsight. Rogue Squadron , however, pushed the console to its limit. Eggebrecht chuckles when I ask him about this. “The N64 (a) was a devilish machine and (b) the development environment was absolutely horrible,” he tells me.\nIt was so bad that Factor 5, with the help of two British hardware developers, created their own development environment for the console. “It was basically ten times, if not a hundred times, faster in terms of turnaround times for Rogue Squadron .”\nNot content with just that, and with Nintendo’s blessing, the team rewrote the N64’s sound system to facilitate the remarkable soundtrack composed by Chris Huelsbeck. “I think he never got remotely enough credit for that,” Eggebrecht says of music so innately integrated with the Star Wars identity while being so individual to Rogue Squadron .\nTo that LucasArts added a voice cast including Bob Bergen, Olivia Hussey, and Terry McGovern. “That was a fluke. We got lucky because George Lucas didn’t like LucasArts,” McGovern tells me over Zoom. “Every once in a while they’d grab one of us and give us some work.”\n“That’s why we invested the time in coming up with that voice compression for the N64,” Eggebrecht adds. “LucasArts’ voice department was, in the industry, by far the best out there.”\nBy the time E3 rolled around in May 1998, however, Rogue Squadron consisted of one level without objectives, Eggebrecht tells me. “We had an AT-AT basically walking along, you weren’t even able to take it down, and you could shoot down a few Tie-Fighters.”\nThe development of Rogue Squadron was rough, yet the magic conjured therein endures — helped by the fact Rogue Squadron remains available to modern players on Steam. To pull Rogue Squadron out of the limited hardware of the N64 is a testament to Factor 5 and LucasArts, but it’s also a reminder of the hazy, heady world of the Nintendo 64 that few remember as anything but magical. Even if, as Eggebrecht suggests, “sometimes it’s magic which you cannot re-create.”\nHe is optimistic we may see its like again, though. Of all games, the spark for that optimism is Super Mario Wonder . “Part of the trick that Wonder does so well is this extremely well-paced brief gameplay,” he says, “which is also very much arcade-y; it’s only so long. Wonder reminds me of Rogue Squadron .”\nEven 25 years later, we can still find shades of Rogue Squadron hidden in the unlikeliest of places. Despite the rose-tinted nature of hindsight, Rogue Squadron truly was a marvel — lovingly developed and unmistakably revolutionary. I feel oddly privileged to have had the chance to play it for the first time, untainted by everything since, even as my bones molder at the thought of 25 years passing since its release; to know I was there for something special — to me at least. As McGovern says as he looks back to that time himself, “I was — we were — we were all at the right place at the right time.”\nRelated The 100 Hardest Video-Game Levels of All Time Every Star Wars Movie, Ranked",

    "text": "It was the least snowiest year on record in 2023 for New York City, but that’s all about to change. After a record-setting 700+ days without more than an inch (2 cm) of snow in The Big Apple, the city could soon see a significant amount of snowfall over the weekend.\nThe previous record for longest duration New Yorkers went without at least an inch of snow on the ground was 383 days, set in 1998.\nThis weekend, a strong low will form in the Southern United States, bringing a chance for a significant snow event for the city.\nThere does remain uncertainty regarding the exact snowfall totals you can expect for the metropolis at this time, however. The storm’s track will make all the difference between light flurries or a weekend snow storm for the city.\nTo snow, or not to snow Two scenarios exist for how the weekend’s weather will play out in New York as two crucial snow ingredients collide over the state: cold air from Canada and moisture from the Gulf of Mexico.\nA push east into the Atlantic Ocean would bring in the colder temperatures from Canada and up to 10 inches (25 cm) of snowfall. However, a slight shift west moves in warmer, moist air from the Gulf and rain, limiting any snow accumulations.\nBoth outcomes are on the table at this moment in time. Regardless of how things play out for New York City, this will be an event worth keeping an eye on as widespread winter impacts are expected across the Northeastern United States and parts of Canada Saturday into Sunday.\nStay with The Weather Network for more forecast information and updates on your weather across Canada and beyond.\nWATCH: Heavy rain on the empty streets on New York City",

But why are these great games not on the list:confused: The Walking Dead: Destinies Skull Island: Rise of Kong The Lord of the Rings: Gollum And specially The day before I mean they are the greatest games of not just this decade, but the century. i have played thrown them several times and put thousands of hours in each game... They are simply great games (what i really think:fear:of these games) games not on the list:confused: The Walking Dead: Destinies Skull Island: Rise of Kong The Lord of the Rings: Gollum And specially The day before I mean they are the greatest games of not just this decade, but the century. i have played thrown them several times and put thousands of hours in each game...

AssimilatorA game over 3 years old is still one of the top-played VR titles, truly shows how \"well\" the VR market is doing...Most of those games are that old, a few new titles but a lot of 2017-2019 era games [#4](/forums/posts/5167237) [Scrizz](/forums/members/scrizz.42078/) AssimilatorA game over 3 years old is still one of the top-played VR titles, truly shows how \"well\" the VR market is doing... Destiny 2, Lost Ark, Apex Legends, DOTA 2, PUBG BattlegroundsWith that logic, it shows how \"well\" the entire market is doing if most of the top games non-VR are also 3+ years old. Nothing uniquely good or bad with VR game trend based on that metric. ;) [#5](/forums/posts/5167253) [ZoneDymo](/forums/members/zonedymo.66089/) these list always show just how fake it all is [#6](/forums/posts/5167318) [ZeppMan217](/forums/members/zeppman217.85360/) ScrizzWith that logic, it shows how \"well\" the entire market is doing if most of the top games non-VR are also 3+ years old.Now that's a weird take, considering the games you mentioned are all GaaS with regular content and other updates. Nothing uniquely good or bad with VR game trend based on that metric. ;)",

    "text": "LEBANON, Va. – Bates Family Farm, LLC plans to invest nearly $1 million to relocate its manufacturing facility to a 40,000 square foot building owned by Russell County to meet growing consumer demand for its skincare products.\nVirginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin announced the plans last week in a written statement.\nThe local firm plans to hire an addition 12 employees due to the expansion.\nThis space will allow for the development of new products, additional production capacity and warehouse space, according to the statement.\nIn addition, Bates Family Farm, LLC plans to construct a new creamery to produce food products, bottled goat milk and artisan cheeses, for wholesale and retail distribution.\nBates Family Farm, LLC is committed to purchasing 100% of all expected agricultural products from Virginia, an increase of more than $2 million over the next three years as a result of this expansion, according to the statement.\nPeople are also reading…\n“This project increases economic development activity in Russell County, provides new jobs in a rural area and demonstrates our support of the Commonwealth’s dairy industry and to Virginia’s entire agricultural community,” Youngkin said in a statement.\nYoungkin approved a $70,000 grant from the Governor’s Agriculture and Forestry Industries Development (AFID) Fund, which Russell County will match with local funds.\nThe Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services worked with Russell County and the Russell County Industrial Development Authority to secure the project for the Commonwealth.\nShannon and Joseph Bates established Bates Family Farm in 2013. The company produces a full line of goat milk-based skincare products including soap, lotion, lip balm and body cream. They are sold in over 1,000 retail stores and specialty shops across the U.S.\n“This AFID grant award and the support we have received from Russell County are critical factors in our decision to move forward with this project. We are honored to grow our business in the county we call home and be part of Virginia’s agricultural community,” said Bates Family Farm CEO Joseph Bates.\n“Russell County is committed to continuing to focus on agribusiness as a growing and vital part of our local economy,” said Russell County Industrial Development Authority Executive Director Ernie McFaddin. “This project will not only create jobs and investment in the county, but also grow the business’ contributions to local tax revenues.”\n— Twitter: @DMcGeeBHC",
