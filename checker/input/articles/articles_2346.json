    "title": "Rain creates sinkholes in Johar Town - Newspaper - DAWN.COM",
    "text": "LAHORE: As Thursday’s record-breaking rain kept the civic agencies, especially Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa), on toes, it also created sinkholes on roads, including Khayaban-i-Firdausi in Johar Town where an old trunk sewer ruptured due to extraordinary flow and drainage of rainwater. On the other hand, the people in a number of residential and commercial areas spent the whole day without water due to non-operation of tube wells beside suspension of electricity supply because of tripping of hundreds of 11kV feeders. “In every rainy season, we see sudden appearance of sinkholes on this road. But no one cares as the government continues to spend huge money on filling of these sinkholes instead of replacing the outlived trunk sewer despite knowing the actual cause,” deplores a motorist who was stuck in the traffic congestion close to the sinkhole near Shadiwal Chowk in Johar Town. “Sometimes ago, a couple of people riding in a car also fell down into the sinkhole. They faced multiple injuries but who cares,” he continues lashing out at the government. Wasa, Lesco tested till breaking point According to experts, depression in a road happens if water seeps underground and causes erosion. It may also happen if there is improper or substandard earth-filling, compaction or asphalt-laying work. “A sinkhole or depression means the surface of the ground is no longer supported and during rains when the asphalt layer gets weak or if any heavy vehicle speedily passes by, it causes the ‘hollow road surface’ to sink,” says an expert, criticising the government for not replacing the outlived trunk sewer lines with the new ones in order to avoid such incidents. The rupture of old sewer lines keeps happening frequently, causing road depressions and damaging the infrastructure besides affecting the routine life of the public at large, he says. However, an official source in Wasa, claims that the project to replace the outlived sewer lines has been approved by the current Punjab government and the work would be launched soon. NO WATER SUPPLY: The Lahorites spent several hours without water and electricity due to various issues caused by the heavy rain. In the absence of water in the tanks, the people couldn’t take even bath or use the toilet. “It was a horrible day as the tube wells in our areas didn’t operate the whole day. When we contacted the officials, they said the operation of tube wells during rains is not allowed as Lahore’s sewerage cannot bear the load of both domestic sewage and stormwater,” explains a resident of a locality near Data Darbar. Wasa Deputy Managing Director Abdul Latif says the operation of tube wells during rain cannot be carried out before drainage of the huge amount of stormwater. ELECTRICITY ISSUES: The torrential rain badly affected the Lahore Electric Supply Company (Lesco) power distribution system. The rain caused tripping of 407 feeders, leaving a number of areas without electricity for most part of the day. According to a spokesman, the rain tripped 65 feeders in Lesco’s first circle, followed by 93 in second, 56 in third, five in fourth, 111 in fifth, 18 in sixth, 55 in seventh and six in eighth circles. “We managed to energise 231 of the total 407 feeders till 3pm,” he said, adding that the supply was restored to many areas by the evening. However, there are reports the electricity in various parts of the city was yet to be restored till filing of this report at 8pm on Thursday. disconnected: SNGPL teams on Thursday disconnected another 62 illegal gas connections and imposed fines totalling Rs1.2 million on account of gas pilferage and other illegalities. In Lahore, according to a spokesman, the enforcement team disconnected one connection for illegal use of gas and two for use of compressors. In Bahawalpur, four connections were disconnected due to the use of compressors. A team in Gujranwala disconnected three connections for illegal gas use, while in Gujrat, one connection was disconnected for illegal gas use and two for the use of compressors, with a fine of Rs0.02 million. A team in Sahiwal disconnected one connection for illegal gas use and two for the use of compressors. In Sargodha, three connections were disconnected for illegal gas use.

    "title": "My 2023 Recap: +60% Growth",
    "text": "2023 was my 2nd year of freelancing full-time, and things have improved significantly. My breakthrough is that client quality trumps quantity 24/7. Since 2019, when I began my freelance journey, I didn't dare to go all in until last year, doing true independent consulting, aka freelancing, working with multiple clients on multiple projects. Now that I have passed the €100k in total revenue milestone from independent work, I can say what drives most of my success: working with quality clients vs. wannabe entrepreneurs. A little over €100k in total revenue from freelancing ☝ In 2019, I had a few side projects, and then, in 2020 and 2021, I was a full-time employee, so there was no time for playing around. In mid-2021, I said I had to try it and switched from full-time employee to full-time independent consultant. My biggest mistake was working with one client at a time. That led to 2-3 months \"commitments.\" Most were local entrepreneurs with little to no knowledge of running and growing a business. How the number of clients progressed over the years ☝ So the hard lesson I learned last year is to have one or a maximum of 2 big clients that you can focus on, build a human connection, and deliver quality work, and a few smaller retainers (2 to 3 clients maximum). This year, 50% of my income came from one client; it's a steady, small agency run by two very successful and great leaders I've been working with since the beginning of the year (bye-bye, 3-month entrepreneurs). Almost 25% of my income came from a no-code SaaS I love working with. The average contract a SaaS has with independent contracts is relatively low, so I'm aware that this can end anytime soon. The other 25% came from a local marketing agency and a few smaller projects. Here is another mistake ... months with no payment. Total revenue in 2022 ☝ Last year, I had two months with zero revenue. I had to slightly overcharge in the following months to compensate for this loss. I learned my lesson; I only had one month with no revenue this year. Total revenue in 2023 ☝ I noticed that January started quite shy, but the next couple of months made up for it, so it wasn't a big deal, more time with my family. With a new baby coming in mid-January, I expect the same slow growth at the beginning of the year but solid growth starting in March.",

    "title": "Lavoro: cercansi “time manager”, oltre l’80% dei dipendenti fatica a gestire il tempo - la Repubblica",
    "text": "Famelico per Shakespeare, il combattente più forte assieme alla pazienza per Tolstoj, relativo lungo il continuum in cui Einstein lo unisce allo spazio, liquido come nell’intuizione di Bauman perché liquida, sfuggente, incerta è l’era in cui viviamo: è il tempo , cruccio e fascinazione degli intellettuali di ogni epoca. La parola d’ordine è “gestione” perché, come ci ricorda Seneca, il problema non è avere poco tempo ma sprecarlo.\nA questo proposito, stando a quanto indicato da LinkedIn e dalle statistiche più interessanti sul tema riportate da Hubstaff , più di 8 professionisti su 10 non sono in grado di gestire il tempo in maniera efficace sul posto di lavoro con conseguenti ritardi nel completamento dei progetti, crescita dello stress e ripercussioni dirette sulla produttività. Inoltre, i dipendenti dichiarano che il 51% della loro giornata lavorativa media viene impiegata in attività di basso valore . Più che una semplice ammaccatura economica, la cattiva gestione del tempo con conseguente ritardo nell’azione risulta essere un'ammaccatura nel potenziale del capitale umano che, come riportato da Gitnux , per l'85% dei dipendenti si traduce nel non riuscire a trovare tempo per la formazione.\nEppure, per sviluppare quella che per la maggior parte delle persone può non essere una dote innata, ovvero la capacità di gestire nel migliore dei modi il tempo a propria disposizione o - per dirla con l’espressione che fu usata nei primi studi sul management scientifico di inizio ’900 - “ time management ”, servirebbe proprio una formazione specifica volta ad acquisire una serie di strumenti, di cui la matrice di Eisenhower è tra i più popolari, che semplificano il processo decisionale sui compiti e aiutano a rimanere produttivi. Stando a quanto indicato da Forbes US , infatti, la gestione del tempo è una delle soft skill più richieste da Hr recruiter e leader d’impresa nel corso dell’anno corrente e continuerà ad esserlo. Tuttavia, il cosiddetto time management risulta una competenza quasi del tutto assente nei workplace di tutto il mondo.\nUn cambio di passo nella gestione del tempo, però, può fare la differenza non solo in termini di maggior produttività, ma di approccio al lavoro ripensato nell’ottica di un miglior equilibrio rispetto alla vita privata che, dunque, non sacrifichi il benessere personale grazie, secondo McKinsey , alla capacità di prefissarsi degli “ smart goal ”, cioè obiettivi specifici , misurabili, attuabili, orientati ai risultati e vincolati ad un arco temporale consono a svolgere nel miglior modo possibile il lavoro richiesto. A quanto pare, per scongiurare dispersioni di tempo, stabilire priorità è la vera arma segreta visto che, come riportato da Hubstaff, dedicare 12 minuti alla pianificazione giornaliera per definire cosa è davvero critico e deve essere affrontato subito può eliminare 2 ore di tempo sprecato.\nIl time management, va detto, non è appannaggio solo del mondo del lavoro. È, infatti, una metodologia applicata in modo cruciale anche al mondo dello sport e riassumibile nel mantra dell’ex canottiere britannico, Ben Hunt-Davis , “ Will It Make the Boat Go Faster ”(Questo farà andare la barca più veloce?) diventato anche il titolo del suo libro scritto insieme a Harriet Beveridge. Esempio emblematico di come la definizione degli obiettivi e la gestione del tempo inducano a risultati eccezionali nello sport e nella vita, Hunt-Davis ha portato la squadra di canottaggio della Gran Bretagna a raggiungere l'oro olimpico dopo anni di risultati mediocri.\nDunque, nel lavoro come nello sport chiedersi se ciò in cui si sta impiegando il proprio tempo \"fa andare la barca più veloce?\" o in alternativa \"ci avvicina ai nostri obiettivi?\" può davvero fare la differenza come ha raccontato un’esperta del settore, Alessandra Marzari , presidente del Consorzio Vero Volley, struttura di riferimento nel mondo della pallavolo nazionale e internazionale, nell’ambito dell’evento “ Il tempo dello sport. Il tempo per riflettere ” presso l' Università degli Studi di Milano . Primo appuntamento di un ciclo di quattro incontri organizzati con il comune denominatore del tempo, appunto, dello sport e della loro relazione nelle sue molteplici forme, che proseguirà nelle principali università di Milano.\nUna serie di convegni che, come spiega Marzari, “nasce da una riflessione su quanto e come anche il tempo possa essere legato allo sport e della conferma di come lo stesso sport sia un importante fatto culturale. La nostra disciplina, la pallavolo, che è un gioco a punteggio, per esempio, non ha quella caratteristica della fretta che è tipica di altri ambiti”. Valore del tempo e tempo di valore sembrano essere le coordinate che accomunano il mondo del lavoro e quello dello sport proprio come racconta il claim “ Driven by Values ” del Consorzio Vero Volley, la cui crescita, nei suoi circa vent'anni di storia, è legata al fatto di “aver lasciato lavorare anche il tempo arrivando, così, a guardare, immaginare il futuro e ad accompagnare tante generazioni nello sviluppo del loro percorso”, conclude la presidente Marzari.\nLeggi i commenti I commenti dei lettori",
