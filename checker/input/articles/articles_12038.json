    "text": "Chief Whip of the Senate, Mohammed Ali Ndume, on Friday, hailed the administration of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, for ‘liberating’ Local Government Councils from suffocation in the hands of governors.\nIn its Judgment on a case instituted by the Federal Government, the Supreme Court directed that local government allocations from the Federation Account should be paid directly to them, going forward.\nThe Supreme Court declared that it was unconstitutional for state governors to hold onto funds meant for Local Government Areas.\nIn its lead judgment, read by Justice Emmanuel Agim, the highest court in Nigeria, observed that the refusal of State Governments to guarantee financial autonomy for Local Governments has gone on for over two decades.\nJustice Agim said Local Governments have since stopped receiving the money meant for them from the state governors who act in their stead.\nHe noted that the 774 Local Government Councils in the country should manage their funds themselves. The revered Justice dismissed the preliminary objections of the defendants (state governors).\nIn a statement, Ndume described the judgment as the biggest achievement of President Tinubu so far since he assumed office in May 2023.\nThe Borno South lawmaker also called on President Tinubu to immediately commence the implementation of the court judgment without further delay, noting that the people at the grassroots must begin to feel the impacts of good governance.\nThe former Leader of the Senate, said since state governors hijacked the Local Government administration in Nigeria, by relying on a controversial section of the 1999 Constitution as amended, no meaningful development has happened at the grassroots.\nHe said: “This court action instituted at the behest of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu is the biggest achievement of his achievement. I’m very happy about the development, and I’m hoping that this will be the beginning of the liberation of local governments in Nigeria.\n“I urge the President to immediately commence the implementation of the Court judgment. Local Government Councils need to start getting their monthly allocations immediately without any further delays. The people at the grassroots levels will begin to feel the impacts of good governance now.\n“The National Assembly made several attempts to amend the 1999 Constitution and address this grey area. But governors didn’t allow the State Assemblies to give the constitutional concurrence. That was how the attempts failed.\n“President Muhammadu Buhari also tried to intervene. Governors didn’t allow him. With this Supreme Court judgment, the issue has finally been rested. No more unnecessary deductions from funds earmarked for local governments.\n“The people can now hold the Council chairmen accountable on how they spend their monthly allocations. They’ll begin to demand true accountability and judicious use of the funds they’ll be getting. I salute the courage of President Tinubu.”",

    "title": "绿通科技斥资超5亿跨界半导体，主业\"失速\"业绩连退_手机新浪网",
    "text": "绿通科技斥资超5亿跨界半导体，主业“失速”业绩连退\n来源：证券之星\n主营业务持续承压，绿通科技（301322.SZ）正试图通过跨界并购寻求转型突破。近日，绿通科技收购江苏大摩半导体科技有限公司（下称“大摩半导体”）的方案出炉，公司斥资5.3亿元，拟通过股权转让和增资两步走拿下控制权。这已是这家半导体设备商的第二次“卖身”尝试，但依旧存在着现金流持续“失血”、业绩承诺较前次交易下调、业务协同性等诸多质疑。\n证券之星注意到，跨界收购背后，绿通科技将从场地电动车业务向半导体领域拓展，谋求第二增长点。尽管上市仅两年，但公司业绩连退颓势难挡，2024年归母净利润较上市前一年（2022年）已然“腰斩”。业绩支撑不足，绿通科技股价也较上市初跌去超四成。\n01． 标的业绩承诺较前次“卖身”“打折”\n根据交易方案，绿通科技此次收购分两步走，公司拟使用超募资金4.5亿元受让大摩半导体合计46.9167%的股权。在股权转让的基础上，绿通科技还将使用超募资金8000万元对大摩半导体进行增资并取得增资后7.6923%的股权。上述交易合计使用超募资金5.3亿元。\n“股权受让+增资扩股”完成后，绿通科技将合计持有大摩半导体51%的股权，成为其控股股东，并实现对标的公司的并表。\n此次交易呈现较高的溢价特征，以2025年3月31日为评估基准日，大摩半导体股东全部权益评估值为9.64亿元，较净资产账面值2.26亿元增值325.74%。\n业绩面上，2024年及今年一季度，大摩半导体分别实现营收2.78亿元、5933.33万元，对应净利润6493.43万元、1776.44万元。不过其现金流却持续“失血”，分别为-3713.21万元、-883.03万元。\n为平衡风险，本次交易设置了业绩对赌。大摩半导体2025年至2027年经审计的净利润分别不低于7000万元、8000万元和9000万元。业绩承诺期三年累计实现净利润不低于2.4亿元。\n绿通科技本次收购资金来源于IPO时的超募资金，公司2023年上市时募集资金净额为21.01亿元，其中超募资金净额16.96亿元。截至今年6月底，账上超募资金余额仍高达16.9亿元。\n证券之星注意到，这并非大摩半导体首次寻求并购，此前与天力锂能（301152.SZ）耗时一年半的收购最终以失败收场。2024年初，天力锂能曾与大摩半导体签署《收购意向协议》，拟通过收购大摩半导体全部或部分股权进而实现控股。但在追加意向金至6000万元并多次签署补充协议后，今年4月底收购仍因“客观环境发生变化”而告败。\n值得一提的是，大摩半导体拟“卖身”天力锂能时给出的业绩承诺为2025年至2027年归母净利润（以扣除非经常性损益前后较低者为计算依据）预计为7500万元-8500万元、8500万元-9500万元、9500万元-1.1亿元。\n对比来看，转投绿通科技时设置的业绩指标显著低于前次交易。业绩承诺短期内下调的原因是什么？是否隐藏着对大摩半导体业绩可持续性的担忧？绿通科技并未在公告中给出具体说明。\n拉长时间看，大摩半导体还藏着上市失败的经历。据媒体披露，2021年大摩半导体曾计划以松江项目为上市主体冲刺科创板，但因行业周期波动及IPO审核趋严未果，需借助上市公司平台加速发展。\n02． 业绩股价“双杀”\n资料显示，绿通科技2023年3月6日在创业板上市，发行价格131.11元/股，主要从事场地电动车的研发、生产和销售，主营产品为高尔夫球车、观光车、电动巡逻车、电动货车等系列。\n绿通科技的跨界收购是其核心业务遭遇冲击下的主动求变。绿通科技表示，受美国场地电动车市场竞争加剧及美国反倾销和反补贴调查贸易摩擦等因素影响，公司主营业务持续承压，经营业绩自2023年以来呈现持续下降的趋势。\n2023年及2024年，绿通科技的营收分别为10.81亿元、8.31亿元，同比分别下降26.48%、23.15%；归母净利润分别为2.63亿元、1.42亿元，同比分别下降15.64%、45.98%。\n今年以来，绿通科技业绩继续走弱。一季度实现营收1.65亿元，同比微降0.06%；对应归母净利润2826.98万元，同比下滑26.16%。\n据悉，中国出口的高尔夫球车等场地电动车出口地主要集中在北美、亚太、中东和欧洲，其中美国是最主要的消费市场。在“双反”冲击下，美国市场的营收占比从2023年的53.22%降至2024年的29.14%。从今年一季度情况来看，非美和国内市场占比已提升至85.37%。\n值得一提的是，上市前两年，绿通科技净利润连续倍增。2019年至2022年，公司营收从4.18亿元增长至14.71亿元，对应归母净利润则从0.49亿元增长至3.12亿元，其中2021年及2022年的归母净利润增速分别为144.08%、145.09%。而2024年的归母净利润仅2022年的约46%。\n绿通科技表示，公司从2023年下半年开始积极寻找能够促进外延增长的机会，希望在夯实主业的基础上，通过投资或者并购活动进入新的领域，积极探索企业战略转型升级，挖掘战略性新兴产业中的增长机会，培育新的业绩增长点。\n证券之星注意到，在大手笔收购大摩半导体之前，绿通科技就已合作设立广东绿通产业投资基金合伙企业（有限合伙），重点布局新能源、新材料、先进制造、节能环保等产业赛道。公司通过该产业基金完成了对江华九恒数码科技有限公司、恒驱电机、深圳市海明润超硬材料股份有限公司的投资。\n资料显示，大摩半导体成立于2017年，系半导体前道量检测设备解决方案供应商，主要为半导体制造过程中良率提升提供前道量检测修复设备、维保技术服务、量检测设备配件和设备及零部件研发等综合解决方案。\n显然，绿通科技所属的非公路休闲车及零配件制造行业与导体设备行业并不具备业务协同性。绿通科技坦言，半导体设备行业存在一定的人才、技术、客户壁垒，在生产、经营、管理方面与原有业务模式存在一定差距，公司能否通过有效整合充分发挥标的公司的竞争优势存在一定的不确定性。\n二级市场上，绿通科技虽头顶2023年首只“百元股”光环，但业绩疲软的表现难以维系投资者信心。截至8月14日收盘，绿通科技报33.15元/股，总市值47.22亿元，上市至今股价累计跌幅超四成。虽然2024年接连抛出两轮回购计划护盘，目前股价较底部已近翻倍，但仍处于破发状态。（本文首发证券之星，作者|陆雯燕）",

    "text": "A pocas horas de la Nochebuena,\nun apagón sorprendió a los vecinos de San Juan de Miraflores. Un incidente que afectó a cientos de familias que esperaban con ansias la celebración de la Navidad, pero que se vio opacado por, según indicaron los vecinos, un corte del servicio imprevisto por Luz del Sur; sin embargo, la realidad sería otra. [Te puede interesar: Navidad sin luz en San Juan de Miraflores: Apagón generó preocupación en vecinos de Lima sur en Nochebuena](/peru/2023/12/25/navidad-sin-luz-en-san-juan-de-miraflores-apagon-en-varias-zonas-del-distrito-desata-preocupacion-entre-vecinos/)\nTras las investigaciones por parte de la empresa prestadora del servicio de energía eléctrica, se supo que la verdadera razón del corte de luz se debió a un agente externo, un globo metálico que, en algún descuido, se dejó soltar y llegó a chocar con uno de los cables de alta tensión, provocando que el impacto termine por afectar a los vecinos de las zonas desde la estación San Juan de la Línea 1 del Metro de Lima hasta Pamplona Baja.\nMás de 100 interrupciones\nTras restablecer el servicio en su totalidad y a vísperas de las celebraciones por Año Nuevo, la empresa Luz del Sur emitió un pronunciamiento en el que señaló que en lo que va del año, por este tipo de accidentes se han registrado más de 100 interrupciones dentro de su zona de concesión.\n[Te puede interesar: ‘Mama rata’ explotó en rostro de niño minutos antes de Nochebuena, ¿cómo actuar frente a una quemadura?](/peru/2023/12/28/mama-rata-exploto-en-rostro-de-nino-minutos-antes-de-nochebuena-como-actuar-frente-a-una-quemadura/)\nEn ese sentido, exhortó a la ciudadanía a evitar soltar al aire globos, antorchas, cometas y otro tipo de objetos flotantes, sobre todo como medida de seguridad ante las celebraciones de Año Nuevo.\nSegún Lorena Trelles, vocera de Luz del Sur, el contacto de estos elementos con las instalaciones de alta y media tensión pueden producir daños a las\ninstalaciones eléctricas, generando interrupciones en el servicio que duran varias horas hasta su reparación final.\n“Tenemos como prioridad la seguridad de todas las personas y la tranquilidad de nuestros clientes; por ello es importante prevenir que no se den estos incidentes, comunicando las posibles consecuencias del simple hecho de soltar un globo en la vía pública, por ejemplo. Hacerlo puede ocasionar por varias horas el corte del fluido eléctrico hasta la identificación, reparación y normalización del servicio”, indicó la vocera.\nComo se sabe, Luz del Sur provee del servicio eléctrico a 65 distritos de Lima Metropolitana, además de Cañete y Huarochirí.\nApagón en San Juan de Miraflores\nSegún los vecinos de San Juan de Miraflores (SJM), segundos antes de quedarse sin luz, se escuchó una explosión, seguido de un destello en los cables de alta tensión ubicados muy cerca del colegio Fe y alegría 3.\n[Te puede interesar: Papel, cartones y plástico: fiestas navideñas dejaron 35 toneladas de basura en Chimbote](/peru/2023/12/27/papel-cartones-y-plastico-fiestas-navidenas-dejaron-35-toneladas-de-basura-en-chimbote/)\nEnterados de la situación, la compañía de electricidad informó que el apagón se debió a un objeto golpeó una torre te alta tención, un globo metálico inflado con helio, lanzado por un tercero. “Se ha interrumpido el servicio de energía eléctrica, después de que este elemento hiciera contacto con un cable de media tensión de nuestras redes”.\nCasi dos horas después del incidente, la luz regresó en algunas zonas de San Juan de Miraflores, como Pamplona Alta, Pamplona Baja, entre otras. Sin embargo, el retorno de la electricidad se dio de manera progresiva. La última urbanización en recuperar el servicio fue Ciudad de Dios.\nIncendio consumió varias viviendas en SJM\nDe otro lado,\nun incendio de grandes proporciones arrasó con dos viviendas y atacó a otras tres durante la madrugada del pasado 26 de diciembre en el sector Las Flores de Villa, en el distrito de San Juan de Miraflores (SJM).\nSegún detalló José Baños, representante del Cuerpo de Bomberos, el fuego consumió rápidamente las casas de material inflamable, pero afortunadamente no registraron víctimas que lamentar. Aunque aun continúan investigando qué habría provocado el sinestro, no descartaron que haya sido provocado por pirotécnicos.\n“El incendio se inició en una de las casas frontales, pero se extendió a las viviendas posteriores. Fue código 2 y se necesitó 10 unidades de bomberos para apagar el fuego. Dos de las cinco viviendas quedaron en escombros”, detalló José Baños, del Cuerpo de Bomberos.\nMás Noticias\n[El músico peruano falleció de un paro cardiaco este jueves 28 de diciembre.

( WHO ) a few days before the Climate Change Summit begins in Baku (COP29).\nIn view of this new event in the fight against global warming, the WHO has published two reports in which it also recommends the development of clean energy for domestic use or “an efficient pricing policy for fossil fuels” in order to achieve these savings. in human lives.\nIn Baku we will carry the message that the climate crisis is also a health crisis, something that is already affecting us, and that combating global warming can therefore generate enormous health benefits,” the director of the Department of the Environment told EFE.

    "text": "By Matt Jaworowski ,\n2 hours ago\nGRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (WOOD) — A deputy from Metro Detroit is being commended for climbing into a moving vehicle to help a driver dealing with a medical emergency.\nThe incident occurred last Thursday heading down Gratiot Avenue, a four-lane street in Mount Clemens. Two Macomb County Sheriff’s deputies found a driver creeping down the road at approximately 5 miles per hour.\nThe driver, identified only as a 63-year-old man, would not pull over. When the deputies pulled alongside him, they saw that he appeared to be in a daze and was not responding to their calls.\nWould-be Florida car burglar gets trapped in Corvette, video shows “Eventually, the driver of the truck rolled down his window and briefly hit the brakes. Deputy (Nicole) Miron, who had been in the passenger side of the patrol vehicle, was able to exit the window of the Sheriff’s SUV and climb into the truck while the vehicles continued traveling on Gratiot,” the Sheriff’s Office said in a social media post .\nOnce inside, Miron was able to put the truck in park and turn it off. A local fire crew arrived moments later to help treat the driver.\nMiron was able to call one of the driver’s family members to confirm the likely medical complication, although MCSO did not elaborate on the specifics.\nA snapshot of the bodycam from Macomb County Sheriff’s Deputy Nicole Miron as she jumps into a moving truck to help a driver dealing with a medical complication. (Courtesy Macomb County Sheriff’s Office) Miron told a local news affiliate that she and her partner didn’t have any other ideas.\n“Before (making the jump), I’m thinking of all the options that we have; I mean, there’s not many,” Miron told WDIV . “At that point, I let him know that I am going to go through the driver’s window, and that’s what I did. I jumped right over him.”\nMichigan teen to be included in 2025 Guinness Book of World Records Sheriff Anthony Wickersham credited Miron for putting herself in harm’s way to help a citizen in need.\n“Due to her quick thinking and selfless actions, she safely ended what could have been a tragic situation,” Wickersham said in a statement.\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

Continua após publicidade O Flamengo apresentou nesta quinta-feira seu novo lateral-esquerdo: Alex Sandro. O experiente jogador volta da Itália após negociação longa com o São Paulo e garantindo que o clube carioca é o que mais se sentiu \"familiarizado.\" O jogador de 33 anos assinou até dezembro de 2026.\ncontinua após publicidade A presença de Tite no comando do time rubro-negro pode ter influenciado na escolha de Alex Sandro pelo Rio de Janeiro. O treinador o comandou na seleção brasileira e indicou sua chegada após a grave lesão do uruguaio Viña, que só volta em 2025 após passar por cirurgia no joelho.\nA diretoria do Flamengo elogiou bastante Alex Sandro antes de repassar a camisa 26 ao reforço. Ele ficou emocionado com a moral recebida e agradeceu ao clube, prometendo dar resposta em campo assim que estiver em forma e em condição de jogo.\ncontinua após publicidade \"Queria agradecer pelas palavras. Eu também tenho minhas palavras de agradecimento pela confiança em minha pessoa. Tenho certeza que tudo isso vai ser recompensado dentro de campo\", afirmou. \"Me sinto muito feliz, orgulhoso, honrado por fazer parte da enorme família que é o Flamengo. Não vejo a hora de entrar em campo. Esse projeto que me apresentaram realmente é maravilhoso e é um clube que qualquer jogador gostaria de jogar\", fez juras de amor.\nO lateral-esquerdo explicou que a escolha por voltar ao País partiu de reunião com os familiares. E que a escolha do Flamengo veio por causa do reencontro com profissionais já conhecidos.\n\"A decisão foi meio que natural. Obviamente que não passa só pelo lado profissional, mas também do pessoal. Foi tomada junto com minha família. Tenho duas meninas que nasceram na Itália, são muito apegadas ao país ainda. Então, foi uma decisão coletiva de voltar para o Brasil\", explicou o jogador revelado na base do Santos.\ncontinua após publicidade \"O projeto apresentado, junto com a comissão técnica que eu já conhecia, e isso facilitou minha vinda para o Flamengo. É o clube onde me sentia mais familiarizado, que sinto que vou me adaptar mais fácil pelos jogadores e comissão técnica. Muito feliz de voltar ao Brasil e jogar pelo Flamengo.\"\nO reforço ainda revelou que teve uma ótima recepção do grupo, celebrou o reencontro com os amigos, se espantou com a estrutura \"maravilhosa\" de trabalho e não escondeu a ansiedade pela estreia. \"Não vejo a hora de sentir a energia da torcida do Flamengo e jogar neste estádio maravilhoso que é o Maracanã. Tudo no seu tempo, mas espero estar preparado para esta oportunidade.\"",
