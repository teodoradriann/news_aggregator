    "text": "Mets Keep Winning: Wild Card Rivalry Heat Up This Past Week!\nThe Mets are currently competing for a Wild Card spot, having won seven consecutive games and placing themselves just half a game behind the third Wild Card position in the National League. They could be tied or just one game back of Atlanta by tomorrow. The recent performance of their competitors, the Padres and Diamondbacks, has kept the race tight, with the Mets trailing by 3.5 games and 3.0 games respectively. The following outlines how these teams fared in the past week.By the Numbers\n- The Mets have won 7 straight games.\n- San Diego Padres went 4-1 over their last five games.\n- Arizona Diamondbacks stood at 3-3 for the week, including a 2-1 streak against the Giants.\nWhile the Mets have seen improved performance, their position remains precarious, with Atlanta still showing some resilience despite a recent slump. The Braves, though struggling against the Phillies, have bounced back against weaker competition, complicating the Wild Card picture. Moreover, the Padres' strong week keeps them ahead, adding pressure on\nNew York.\n- The Mets are just half a game out of the Wild Card spot.\n- Atlanta is attempting to secure their standing amid ups and downs.\n- The Padres are maintaining a competitive edge after a successful stretch.\nThe Mets must continue their winning streak to stay competitive, particularly with crucial matchups against strong opponents coming up. Monitoring the performance of the Padres and Diamondbacks will be essential for New York, as any slip-ups from these teams could shift the standings dramatically.Bottom Line\nThe Mets need to sustain their momentum to capitalize on the fluctuations among their Wild Card competitors, with the next week likely proving crucial for their playoff ambitions. Consistency and seizing opportunities against direct rivals will define their chase for October.\nRead more at\n Amazin' Avenue\nThe summary of the linked article was generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence technology from OpenAI",

    "text": "How one local church is helping people in need during this winter weather SOUTH BEND, Ind - The snow and bitter cold could potentially leave some Michiana residents looking for a place to stay warm this weekend. The Miracle Revival Church's goal is to protect those who are most vulnerable. Inside this church, there's a warming center and people who want to help. “We’ve had a mild winter, but it's about to get really bitter cold the next few days,” said Andrew Synder, the pastor at Miracle Revival Church. Temperatures will soon drop to single digits. That's why the city opens warming centers like the Charles Black Community Center, the O'Brien Center, and the Howard Park Event Center, but they fill fast. Pastor Snyder opened the basement of his church where people can go to keep warm. His goal is to help people with nowhere to go, escape the cold, offering things like clothing, blankets, shoes, and even food to those in need. \"There's a tremendous need, there's a lot of homeless people in South Bend and they need a place to come where it's warm, especially in the daytime, they go to the library, but sometimes it gets so cold, they close the library, we're just here to serve the community and do what we can to help people,” said Synder. The church is open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. 7 days a week.",

    "title": "Is Cardano Still a Smart Long-Term Hold?",
    "text": "As one of the more serious altcoins in the crypto sector, Cardano (CRYPTO: ADA) has the shape of an asset that might be ripe for long-term holding. It certainly won't be going to zero anytime soon, and its team of developers isn't about to give up on their quest to upgrade the chain and make it a more appealing place to build applications.\nBut is it still a smart coin to buy and hold for years, or has the environment shifted to make its odds less favorable?\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More »\nCompared to its price five years ago, Cardano's price today is over 2,000% higher. It is easy to wish that its price will do the same if you buy it today and hold it for a similar amount of time. But that kind of thinking is folly.\nFor Cardano to be a smart purchase today, it needs to demonstrate why it's a better place to develop applications than its chief competitors, Ethereum and Solana, both of which are much larger. Beyond that, it also needs a high growth segment that's capable of drawing in capital from investors who are looking to invest in promising applications.\nFor example, if the chain were to capture a significant ecosystem of projects creating decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), artificial intelligence (AI) agents, or infrastructure projects for those agents to use, it'd generate demand for the coin, and thus send prices upward. Alternatively, its decentralized finance (DeFi) projects could flourish, or it could become an attractive hub for stablecoins to keep more value on its chain.\nBut there isn't really any evidence of Cardano succeeding in any of those segments, especially not in comparison to its competitors. Its AI project ecosystem is so tiny that its total market cap is less than $1 million, which is to say it's nonexistent. In terms of its DeFi projects, its largest decentralized crypto exchanges barely turn over $2 million in volume in a 24-hour period.\nIn other words, Cardano's project ecosystem just isn't the place where developers are choosing to launch their projects in some of the most important emerging growth segments in the crypto sector. Meme coins and similar less serious segments are also underrepresented on the chain.\nFor these issues to change, a combination of things would need to happen. First, the chain would need to get even cheaper and even faster so that it could rival Solana. It'd also need to commit to a faster pace of tech development, shedding its slow-moving and deliberate reputation. Then it'd need to match its development roadmap to the features developers in the next set of growth segments would be looking for -- a challenging proposition, to say the least.\nBut the most challenging thing would be to get investors to believe that the coin's value is going to go up over time as a result of its superior leadership, budding ecosystem, and great tech. And that looks very far away right now.\nSo Cardano is probably no longer a great choice to buy with the intention of holding for a long time, even if it once was. That could change over the coming years, but it is not wise to bet on.\nSimply put, even when considered generously, the investment thesis for this coin is not very clear anymore. There isn't much hope for regulatory catalysts to save the day, nor are there many drivers in favor of the coin gaining in value compared to where it is now. There does not appear to be a strong reason why the coin is worth holding on to when comparing it to faster, cheaper, and larger chains like Solana, which also have richer project ecosystems, especially in the aforementioned growth segments. That should frighten you if you're a holder.\nThe odds of Cardano going to zero are not very high, as it has an established community and at least some capital that's committed to the chain, even when it isn't performing well. Still, if you're actually looking for growth, even being very patient is not probably going to make this into a good investment.\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\nRight now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\nContinue »\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 1, 2025\nAlex Carchidi has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

    "title": "La increíble historia de Dayana Mendoza, la ex Miss Universo que ahora es predicadora de una iglesia | TN",
    "text": "La reconocida modelo venezolana Dayana Mendoza , que este 1° de junio cumple 38 años, atravesó un drástico cambio en su vida: pasó de brillar en las pasarelas y ser elegida como la mujer más hermosa del mundo en 2008, cuando se coronó como Miss Universo , a convertirse en predicadora de una iglesia cristiana de Estados Unidos .\nNacida en 1986 en Caracas , se adentró de muy chica en el mundo del modelaje. Con apenas 15 años, fue finalista en el Elite Model Look International 2001 celebrado en Niza, Francia, y firmó contrato para la agencia francesa Elite Model Management. Ese fue apenas el primero de varios títulos importantes que conseguiría.\nDayana Mendoza fue Miss Venezuela y Miss Universo. Foto: Instagram @dayanamendoza Desde entonces, su carrera fue en ascenso: se consagró como Miss Venezuela 2007 y como Miss Universo en 2008 . Su exposición pública incrementó aún más en 2012, cuando participó del famoso reality show estadounidense The Celebrity Apprentice , organizado por Donald Trump . En ese entonces, empezaron a circular rumores de que mantenía un romance con el expresidente de Estados Unidos, aunque ella siempre negó esas versiones.\nLeé también: Alejandra Rodríguez, la modelo de 60 años, se quedó con el título de “mejor rostro” en Miss Universo Argentina\nEn paralelo, estudió actuación y cine en New York Film Academy en Estados Unidos, con la beca que recibió por parte de la Organización Miss Universo. Protagonizó algunos cortometrajes e incluso produjo su propia película: Honey (2018), que recibió buenas críticas y que fue semifinalista en el Festival Internacional de Cine de Hollywood.\nDayana Mendoza: bautismo cristiano y nueva etapa como predicadora de una iglesia En agosto de 2020, fue bautizada como cristiana evangélica . En su cuenta oficial de Instagram, donde cuenta con más de 1,9 millones de seguidores, compartió fotos de ese momento y reflexionó: “Quiero compartir con ustedes, uno de los momentos más grandes en mi vida. Siempre tuve una inmensa conexión con Dios , y solo me sentía atraída a Jesús, a aprender de él”.\n“Aunque anduve buscando en los sitios equivocados por falta de noción , donde no perdura la verdad eterna y no está la bendición De Dios, nunca tuve duda de mi sentimiento hacia Nuestro Salvador y nunca perdí deseo de estar más cerca de Él, así que, seguía buscando. La iglesia Cristiana me ha dado tantas enseñanzas, tantas respuestas!”, continuó.\nLeé también: Todas las microbikinis de Magalí Benejam Corthey, la modelo que se coronó como Miss Universo Argentina\nPor último, concluyó: “El por fin conseguirme, obtener las respuestas en Jesús, sentir la gran bendición de este llamado, de sentirme elegida, poder bautizarme en aguas como lo ha hecho nuestro Salvador Jesucristo, y ha querido nuestro Dios para todos sus hijos, es uno de los Milagros más grandes que Dios ha hecho en mi vida”.\nDesde entonces, se convirtió en predicadora del Grupo de Iglesias Vencedores en Cristo. En ese sentido, utiliza sus redes sociales para compartir mensajes religiosos y videos en los que da charlas al respecto. También tiene un canal de YouTube con más de 15.000 suscriptores donde genera contenido relacionado. En ese perfil publica videos como “La fidelidad de Dios es grande”, “El beneficio de crecer en Cristo y en su espíritu”, “¿Por qué creer en Jesús y creerle a Jesús es diferente?” y “¿Satanás está feliz con tu Iglesia?”, entre otros.\nDayana Mendoza el día que fue bautizada. Foto: Instagram @dayanamendoza En uno de ellos, se refirió a su vida pasada como modelo: “ Yo viajé por el mundo como modelo . Almorzaba con presidentes, diseñadores de modo muy famosos. Tenía entradas VIP para todas las discotecas del mundo, jamás hice fila ni pagué un centavo. Pero mi vida comenzó cuando empecé a seguir a Cristo. Todo eso no me llevaba a la vida eterna, sino a la muerte, pero no lo entendía ”.",
