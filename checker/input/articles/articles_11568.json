    "title": "Cherbourg to receive $26 million for upgrades to contaminated water supply - ABC News",
    "text": "The First Nations community of Cherbourg will receive $26 million to upgrade its water infrastructure. The local council hopes the upgrade will put an end to frequent \"boil water\" alerts. What's next? The council expects the new water treatment plant to be operational within two to three years. The residents of Cherbourg are finally getting a secure water supply that will make a major difference to their health and lives. Alerts advising residents to boil their water have been a frequent occurrence for the First Nations settlement three hours' drive from Brisbane, known as one of Australia's most disadvantaged communities. The most recent episode extended nine months until July 2024, due to a muddy water supply containing E. coli bacteria, fed directly from a nearby creek. According to a 2022 risk management report, water runoff from nearby cattle grazing land contained a \"significant load\" of viruses and bacteria, with mining operations from a nearby lime quarry also posing a risk to the water supply. Cherbourg Shire Council staff said the 70-year-old water treatment plant should have been upgraded decades ago in order to keep pace with population growth and more intensive agriculture. \"It's probably the last 20 to 25 years that we haven't been making a high enough quality of water to be the standard with the rest of Queensland,\" operations manager Matthew Boch said. 'Sometimes we have to hit rock bottom' Queensland Water Minister Glenn Butcher this week announced $26 million in joint funding from the state and federal governments to fix the problem, including improvements to the water mains, filtration equipment and water treatment processes. Mr Butcher said the funding was locked in and was not dependent on the outcome of October's Queensland election. \"It will certainly give them the best water-drinking quality they can get,\" Mr Butcher said. \"As we know, some of these remote regions need that extra support with extra filtration and extra upgrades for water treatment facilities — that's what this funding is going to do.\" Mr Boch said he expected construction to begin in June 2025, with the new infrastructure operational within two to three years. Cherbourg Shire Council chief executive Chatur Zala said the funding announcement was a welcome outcome after protracted negotiations with the state and federal governments. \"Sometimes we have to hit rock bottom for them to see things are not really working,\" he said. \"We'll do everything to ensure we don't go back to the boil water alerts, because no-one likes them.\" 'Why do we have to wait and wait and wait?' Residents have linked the substandard water supply with Cherbourg's deep health disadvantage. Australian Bureau of Statistics data shows the community has more than twice the rate of long-term health conditions such as diabetes and kidney disease than the rest of the state. Workers caring for the most vulnerable in the community long ago eschewed the town's water supply, opting instead to buy bottled water. Aunty Jacqui Tapua, who is director of the community-run Gundoo Early Childhood Centre, said the centre paid about $600 per month for bottled water. But she said outbreaks of diarrhoea, gastroenteritis and rotaviruses were common for children who drank the town water at home. \"We're not that remote that our water quality [should be] so poor that our children suffer, our elders suffer,\" she said. Aunty Tapua said long delays in bringing the water supply up to standard were a clear example of the inequitable treatment of First Nations communities in Cherbourg. \"If it was a non-Indigenous community, I think the problem would be solved,\" she said. \"Sometimes we feel like, 'Why do we have to wait and wait and wait.'\" Despite being let down by announcements of past initiatives, Aunty Tapua was cautiously optimistic the new funding would result in a water supply that would meet the expectations of all Australians. \"I think we hear too often, 'We're fixing it,'\" she said. \"Hopefully they'll do it right this time, for the future of the children of our community.\" ABC Wide Bay — local news in your inbox ABC Privacy Collection Statement .",

    "text": "Ram temple inauguration: Not interested in event, Yechury replies to Misra\nIn 2020, Yechury criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for laying the foundation stone of Ram Temple at Ayodhya saying that it was a violation of the Constitution in letter and spirit.\nPublished: 24th December 2023 11:27 AM | Last Updated: 24th December 2023 11:30 AM | A+A A-\nNEW DELHI: CPI (M) general Secretary Sitaram Yechury has turned down the invitation to attend the\nconsecration ceremony of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya which will take place on January 22, 2024. Nripendra Misra, Chairman of the Ayodhya Ram Mandir Construction Committee invited Yechury for the consecration ceremony. In 2019, after the Supreme Court ruled in favour of the construction of Ram temple at the disputed site, the CPM said that the Ayodhya judgment had given precedence to the ‘faith and beliefs of one side’ and said that a verdict had been delivered but it was not justice.\nIn 2020, Yechury criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for laying the foundation stone of Ram Temple at Ayodhya saying that it was a violation of the Constitution in letter and spirit.\nThe committee has extended invitations to opposition leaders including Sonia Gandhi, Mallikarjun Kharge, former PM Manmohan Singh, and NCP chief Sharad Pawar, among others. Though, the Congress thanked the Ram Janmabhoomi Trust for the invitation, it has not yet made clear its stand on whether its top leaders will be attending the ceremony.\nCongress general secretary (organization) KC Venugopal on Thursday said that the leaders have received an invitation to the ceremony. “They have invited us, we are very much thankful to them for inviting us, let us see”, he said on the sidelines of the Congress Working Committee meeting.\nWhen asked whether top leaders would attend the ceremony, Venugopal said, “You will know about the party’s stand.” Earlier, senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh said that Sonia Gandhi was ‘very positive on this matter’, referring to the invitation. Singh said that either Gandhi or a delegation from her side would attend the ceremony.\nWhen asked if he had received any invitation to the grand ceremony, Singh said, “The BJP will not invite me because they are not inviting the true devotees. Whether it be Murli Manohar Joshi, L K Advani or Digvijay Singh, they will not be given the invitation,” he said.",

Ha sottolineato la necessità di assumersi la responsabilità delle decisioni prese, affermando che ha accettato un accordo piuttosto che mettere un veto a caso per tornare a regole peggiori. Giorgetti ha espresso la sua preoccupazione per l'illusione che negli ultimi quattro anni si potesse continuare a fare debito e deficit senza tornare a un sistema di regole. Ha sottolineato che questa discussione è viziata da tale illusione. Il ministro dell'Economia ha anche parlato dello sforzo a favore di imprese e famiglie nella manovra, che secondo lui produrrà una crescita del Pil pari alle aspettative del governo. Ha riconosciuto che queste aspettative eccedono rispetto alle stime aggiornate, un fenomeno che si verifica in tutti i Paesi europei a causa della guerra in corso e delle sue ripercussioni finanziarie. Giorgetti ha poi parlato dell'inflazione, che ha definito \"questa sconosciuta\", tornata a falcidiare i redditi delle famiglie europee e a condizionare il commercio globale e la crescita in Europa. Ha anche menzionato la recessione in Germania, che ha influenzato la crescita economica dell'Italia. Infine, Giorgetti ha affermato che la manovra ha subito una serie di cambiamenti in Senato, tenendo conto del profilo di spendibilità. Questi cambiamenti hanno portato a un miglioramento di tutti i saldi di finanza pubblica.",

    "text": "Sky logo Sky is cutting 2,000 call centre staff and replacing them with chatbots, saying people are tired of phoning customer service agents.\nThe broadcaster will close three of its 10 customer service centres in Stockport, Sheffield and Leeds as it cuts 7pc of its workforce.\nInstead, it will invest more in round-the-clock online chat representatives – who will be based overseas – as well as artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots.\nSky claimed that the majority of customers now wanted to handle tasks like renewing contracts and paying bills through its app and website rather than over the phone.\nThe company, which is owned by the US media conglomerate Comcast, said it expected to receive millions fewer calls from customers in the coming years, with annual volumes dropping from 25m to 17m by 2029.\nSky is swinging the axe as it battles heavy losses and tries to navigate the switch from lucrative satellite contracts to the more competitive streaming landscape.\nThe broadcaster reported a £773m loss for 2023, its most recent set of accounts, largely due to write-downs in its Italian and German businesses. Its expenses rose as it paid out more for football rights.\nIt comes after it emerged that Sky is cutting around 1,000 jobs, including installation engineers, as more people access its TV services over the internet rather than through satellite dishes.\nThe changes are potentially risky given Sky has long had a reputation for good customer service. Ofcom figures show it is the least complained-about telecoms provider in the UK.\nSky said it would continue to have thousands of phone advisers, and that it would invest millions in its Livingston campus in Scotland, including a “centre of excellence”.\nIt said the decision came after surveying 10,000 customers, and finding that nine in 10 wanted to be able to contact the company in more ways than over the phone.\nA Sky spokesman said: “We’re transforming our business to deliver quicker, simpler and more digital customer service.\n“Our customers increasingly want choice, to speak to us on the phone when they need us most and the ease of managing everyday tasks digitally.\n“We’re investing in a new centre of excellence for customer service, alongside cutting-edge digital technology to make our service seamless, reliable and available 24/7. This is about building a future-ready Sky that continues to put our customers and their needs first.”\nBT has also said that it expects to replace thousands of customer service workers with AI.\nNatWest said last week it would use technology from OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, to develop a digital assistant for customers.\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

    "text": "Analysts at Jefferies provided their view on the software sector in a recent research note, upgrading Dynatrace Inc. (NYSE: DT ), monday.com Ltd. (MNDY (NASDAQ: MNDY )), Freshworks Inc (FRSH), and Instructure (INST) to Buy. They also downgraded Okta, Inc. (NASDAQ: OKTA ) and Vimeo (NASDAQ: VMEO ) to Hold.\nOverall, Jefferies expects 2024 to be another positive year for the sector, though they feel we will likely see more measured returns.\n\"1H could be challenging given 4Q23 rally and seasonal Q1 black ice,\" said the firm, adding it would, however, position selectively for a better second half of the year, driven by fundamental acceleration, increased adoption of AI SKUs, lower interest rates, still reasonable valuation, and potential M&A pick-up.\nFocusing on the upgrades, Jefferies said it lifted DT as it sees an attractive setup for the stock in F2H24 and FY25, underappreciated upside to ARR driven by emerging products made possible by efficiencies of Grail, and a large install base that they believe is underpenetrated and should benefit from further investments in GTM and the adoption of DPS. The DT price target was raised to $70 from $50 per share.\nThe financial services firm said they see MNDY as a long-term winner in the collaboration software space with \"the best momentum in both topline growth and FCF margins.\" They also said its valuation is attractive as it trades at a significant discount to high-growth software peers. MNDY's price target was lifted to $230 from $180.\nFor FRSH, Jefferies said there are five reasons for the upgrade: Its important metrics are close to hitting a bottom, it still has room for cost savings, the company is \"playing offense on AI,\" it has better GTM execution, and it is \"getting back to the rule of 40.\" Jefferies raised the FRSH price target to $30 from $20.\nINST has been lifted to Buy as the firm favors B2B education tech vendors over B2C. \"We continue to prefer the B2B education tech space over the B2C space given end market stability and clearer medium-term growth outlooks,\" said Jefferies. INST's price target was increased to $30 from $25.\n\"High gross retention rates (in the mid 90% range) and built-in annual price increases (3%-5%) help to support predictable and durable low-double-digit revenue growth,\" they added. \"INST's B2B exposure and focus on K-12 and higher-ed should allow INST to execute against its goals, irrespective of the macro environment.\"\nWhen it comes to downgrades, OKTA was moved to Hold as the stock has hit Jefferies' $85 price target. It was assigned a new $95 per share price target. \"We view our $95 PT, or 6x EV/CY25 rev, as appropriate, particularly given the execution risk associated with the recent worse-than-expected cyber incident,\" said the firm.\nVimeo's unclear growth outlook and recent C-suite changes have resulted in Jefferies putting a \"pause on the story\" despite what they view as an attractive valuation. \"As part of our 2024 outlook, we are downgrading shares of VMEO to Hold until we can gain line of sight into a durable revenue growth recovery,\" wrote the firm. The new VMEO price target is $, down from $7 per share.\nAdd Chart to Comment",

    "title": "Republican primaries, Trump wins by a landslide in Iowa: “And now let’s take America back”",
    "text": "Donald Trump wins the first stage of the Republican primaries in Iowa by a landslide, in less than half an hour from the opening of the caucuses, with just over 50% of the votes and a record gap of around 30 points, more than double Bob Dole’s record in 1988. According to the partial results of the Iowa caucuses, out of the state’s 40 delegates for the Republican convention, Donald Trump gets 20, Ron DeSantis 8 and Nikky Haley 7. CNN reports it.\nThe tycoon has made waves in all social areas, starting with the evangelicals, with the only weakness of the suburban areas. An astonishing result if you consider that in 2016 he came second here and that since then he has sown chaos, suffered two impeachments and is awaiting four criminal trials, including two for attempting to subvert the outcome of the vote. During the night, however, it was a long head-to-head between his main challengers for second place, won by Ron DeSantis against Nikky Haley, contrary to predictions.\nBut the gap is so low (21.2% to 19%, with 94% of the votes counted) that it does not make a substantial difference, leaving the race open as to which of the two will be able to try to present itself as an alternative to The Donald: in the next stop on January 23rd in the more liberal New Hampshire, the former UN ambassador is better positioned. On the other hand, the tech entrepreneur of Indian origins Vivek Ramaswamy (fourth with 7.7%) withdraws, giving his endorsement to former president Trump, increasing his number of votes.\n“I am honored and invigorated by this victory”, the tycoon’s first comment on Fox, before his official speech. Starting on a conciliatory tone with the hope of uniting the country in a bipartisan way, congratulations to DeSantis-Haley and praise from her family, including her recently deceased mother-in-law. But he immediately turned to attacks on Joe Biden, “the worst president in US history” and the director of his trials (“election interference”). Or in the threatening promise to “seal the border with Mexico against the invasion of criminals and terrorists”, implementing “a system of deportations not seen in this country since the days of Eisenhower”. Biden acknowledged that after Iowa Trump “is the favorite for the Republican nomination” and his campaign warned that if he wins there will be “vile attacks, endless lies and massive spending.”",
