    "text": "Story Highlights - Coinbase received an award from FinCEN. - The agency underscored the need for more firms to comply with BSA reporting. - Coinbase CLO lauds team’s commitment taking swipe at opponents. Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has received an award from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) for its contribution to criminal investigations. In an April 11 post on X (formerly Twitter), [Paul Grewal](https://x.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1778472385068610033), Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer disclosed the official letter from the government agency. FinCEN Stresses Compliance Coinbase contributed to the investigations of one of the seven major criminal cases spurring the FinCEN Director’s Law Enforcement Award. Firms bagged the award after reporting under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) was used to effectively prosecute cases. “The investigations nominated for consideration in this year’s award program may not have been pursued without the BSA reports that financial institutions like yours make, pursuant to FinCEN’s regulatory requirements…. We want to provide this letter and a summary of related cases about your institution’s invaluable contribution.” The agency urged financial firms not to comply based on requirements but to fight crime and protect the United States financial markets. In recent months, [United States regulators](https://coingape.com/cftc-chair-urges-congress-to-pass-crypto-regulation-legislation/) have ramped up regulatory efforts to curb digital asset fraud in a bid to protect investors. Global authorities have joined their United States counterparts seeking collaborative regulatory efforts. The agency underscored the importance of the BSA reporting to prevent illicit finance in many sectors as it helps in the development of risk indicators.

    "text": "Reports that a '15-day\nsnow bomb' could hit the UK in early January should be \"treated with caution\", the Met Office has said. Exacta Weather had predicted severe snowfall in early 2024.\nThere has even been talk of a second Beast from the East. Officially known as anticyclone Hartmut, the Beast from the East saw heavy snow and freezing conditions strike the UK in 2018.\nBut Met Office forecasters are urging caution over claims snowfall could hit the UK after Storm Gerritt sparked chaos across the country during\nChristmas week, as BirminghamLive reports. The Exeter-based weather forecaster said that it is too early to give any real details, but said models indicate that a SSW (Sudden Stratospheric Warming) event could occur on January 4 or 5.\nRead More:\nThousands heading for Cornwall festive dip will swim in sewage-dumped waters, Lib Dems say\nRead More:\nMystic Baba Vanga's predictions she got right - and what 2024 has in store\nJames Madden, forecaster for Exacta Weather, had said: “The risk is growing for a prolonged cold and snowy spell as we head into the early part of January. This is due to the risk growing for another SSW (Sudden Stratospheric Warming) event within this period, and this could bring the threat of another Beast from the East in early 2024.\n“There are now strong indications for a major SSW to occur during the early part of January, and if it does, many parts of the UK can expect to end up in the freezer with snow events and severe cold weather.”\nBut in response, a Met Office forecaster said: “Models are indicating there could be one (SSW) on 4 or 5 January. But it’s too early to give any real details and we have to wait to see if one actually happens. If it does then we would possibly see the effects towards the end of January.”\nIn recent years some extreme cold, winter snow events have all been connected to the surface effects of sudden stratospheric warming. An SSW was to blame for the infamous Beast from the East weather blast back in 2018. The term sudden stratospheric warming refers to what is observed in the stratosphere:- a rapid warming (up to about 50 °C in just a couple of days), between 10 km and 50 km above the earth’s surface.\nOn its website, the Met Office explains: \"Usually a few weeks later, we can start to see knock-on effects on the jet stream, which in turn effects our weather lower down (in the troposphere). However, the stratospheric sudden warming doesn’t happen every year, and it doesn’t always affect our weather when it does.\"\nIt means that northern Europe, including the UK is likely to get a long spell of dry, cold weather, whereas southern Europe will tend to be more mild, wet and windy. \"On the boundary of these areas, cold easterly winds develop and in some cases the drop in temperatures leads to snow,\" the Met Office says.\nIn its long-range forecast on their website, the Met Office say: \"Into the new year it now looks finely balanced whether near or slightly above temperatures will be in place across the south, with periods of rain, wind, and showers. Or if the slightly below average temperatures in place across the north; where showers will remain wintry, will manage to filter southwards or not. If the colder air filters southwards wintry showers could be seen across parts of England and Wales, and it is possible some more significant snowfall could occur along the mild / cold air boundary.\n\"Thereafter, more settled conditions are expected to gradually develop more widely, increasing the risk of frost and fog. If this were to occur day on day net cooling would lead to below average temperatures, with an increased threat of winter hazards, including ice/snow.\"\nFrom January 11 to January 25, it adds: \"Compared to normal, there is an increased chance of colder than average conditions during this period, and a reduced chance of prolonged periods of very unsettled / milder conditions with frequent rain and wind pushing in from the Atlantic. Currently the chance of widespread severe cold is still deemed low, but still the risk of impacts from cold, ice and snow is greater than normal.\"",

    "text": "Uncover the secret performance killer lurking in your CSS and DOM manipulations — and learn the simple trick that will make your pages fly As web developers, we often focus on flashy features, eye-catching designs, and the latest JavaScript frameworks. But there’s an invisible performance bottleneck that’s silently dragging down the user experience of even the most polished websites. It’s called reflow — and if you’re not careful, it can turn your carefully crafted layouts into a CPU-melting mess. What is Reflow, and Why Should You Care? Reflow is the process that occurs when the browser needs to recalculate the position and geometry of elements on the page. This happens any time the DOM or styles are modified, whether through JavaScript, CSS animations, or user interactions. The problem is, reflow is an incredibly CPU-intensive operation. The browser has to traverse the entire DOM and CSS object model, recalculate all the affected layout, and then repaint the screen. For complex pages with thousands of elements, this can bring even the beefiest of machines to a crawl.",

    "text": "The drought warning for the Shenandoah region of Virginia has been officially lifted after more than 12 inches of rain in some areas in a 30-day period. Heavy precipitation, notably from Tropical Storm Helene, has led to improvements in soil moisture and streamflow across Virginia. The Department of Environmental Quality in coordination with the Virginia Drought Monitoring Task Force downgraded the Shenandoah region from a drought warning to a drought watch. The Shenandoah region includes the counties of Augusta, Rockingham, Shenandoah, Frederick, Page, Warren and Clarke. A drought watch advisory also remains in place for the Northern Virginia region which includes the counties of Arlington, Fairfax, Fauquier, Loudoun and Prince William. Drought advisories were also lifted for 17 localities in Virginia including: - Big Sandy: Buchanan, Dickenson, Lee, Russell, Scott, Smyth, Tazewell, Washington and Wise counties - New River: Bland, Carroll, Floyd, Giles, Grayson, Montgomery, Pulaski and Wythe counties Additional factors - Stream flows have returned to normal levels throughout the Commonwealth with all streams within the monitoring network currently indicating normal status. - Groundwater levels for monitoring wells in the Climate Response Network largely remain below normal and require additional precipitation events to recover over the short- and long-term period. - While recent precipitation events have resulted in improvements, groundwater levels in eight evaluation regions remain currently below the 25th percentile with two regions recording below the 5th percentile (Shenandoah and York James) - Storage at major water supply reservoirs have improved slightly over the past two weeks and remain within normal ranges. Response plans - DEQ is working with local governments, public water works, and water users in the affected areas to ensure that conservation and drought response plans and ordinances are followed. - Virginians that are supplied water from the Potomac River should consult the for specific triggers and actions to be taken. - All Virginians are encouraged to protect water supplies by minimizing water use, monitoring drought conditions and detecting and repairing leaks.",

    "text": "Why Does My Hamburger Taste Like Fish? A Comprehensive Guide That fishy taste in your hamburger can be a truly unpleasant surprise. The reasons behind this unwelcome flavor are multifaceted, ranging from spoilage and diet of the animal to individual taste perception and even underlying health issues. It’s important to carefully consider all possibilities to identify the root cause and prevent it from happening again. Let’s dive into the possible culprits.\nIdentifying the Culprits: Why the Fishy Flavor? Several factors can contribute to a hamburger tasting like fish. Understanding these potential causes is crucial for troubleshooting the issue and enjoying your burger. Here’s a breakdown:\nSpoilage: This is the most common and concerning reason. Like any meat, ground beef degrades over time . Bacteria multiply, producing compounds that create off-flavors, often described as fishy or ammonia-like. Always check the “use by” or “sell by” date, and more importantly, use your senses.\nGrass-Fed Beef and Diet: While touted for its health benefits, grass-fed beef can sometimes possess a fishy or gamey flavor . This is because the animal’s diet directly influences the fatty acid profile of the meat. Certain grasses and forages contain compounds that, when metabolized, can impart a fishy taste. The key is the specific type of forage the animal consumed. It’s less about being grass-fed and more about what kind of grass.\nOmega-3 Fatty Acids: It’s a common misconception that the fishy taste in grass-fed beef is always due to high omega-3 content. While grass-fed beef does contain more omega-3s than grain-fed beef , the flavor isn’t inherently fishy from these fatty acids alone. The issue lies in the breakdown products of certain forages.\nTrimethylamine (TMA): In seafood, a fishy odor and flavor is often caused by trimethylamine (TMA) , a compound produced by bacterial breakdown of trimethylamine oxide (TMAO). While TMA is not normally a concern in beef, certain spoilage processes could potentially lead to its formation, although this is less common.\nDysgeusia: Altered Taste Perception: Sometimes, the problem isn’t the burger; it’s you! Dysgeusia is a taste disorder that can cause foods to taste different than they should. This can be triggered by medications, medical conditions (like a cold, allergies, or even neurological disorders), pregnancy, or vitamin deficiencies.\nContaminated Ingredients: If you’ve added other ingredients to your burger mix, such as seafood-based sauces or spices that have been stored improperly, these could be the source of the fishy taste. Even cross-contamination in your refrigerator can transfer odors and flavors.\nPrevention is Key Once you determine the cause, you can take steps to prevent the fishy burger experience in the future:\nSource Wisely: Buy ground beef from reputable sources with high turnover rates. Ask your butcher about the beef’s origin and feeding practices. If opting for grass-fed beef, try different suppliers until you find one that consistently delivers a flavor you enjoy.\nCheck for Freshness: Always inspect ground beef before buying. Look for a bright red color (the center may be slightly darker), a fresh smell (not ammonia-like or sour), and a firm texture.\nProper Storage: Store ground beef in the coldest part of your refrigerator (usually the bottom shelf) and use it within one to two days of purchase.\nSafe Handling: Practice safe food handling techniques to prevent bacterial contamination. Wash your hands thoroughly before and after handling raw meat, and use separate cutting boards and utensils for raw meat and other foods.\nRule Out Dysgeusia: If the issue persists across different types of food, consult a doctor to rule out an underlying medical condition or medication side effect.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Here are some commonly asked questions about fishy-tasting hamburgers:\nIs it normal for ground beef to smell like fish? No, it’s not normal for fresh ground beef to smell like fish. A fishy smell is a strong indication of spoilage , and the meat should be discarded. Fresh ground beef should have a mild, slightly metallic scent.\nWhy does grass-fed beef sometimes taste fishy? As mentioned, grass-fed beef’s flavor is influenced by the specific type of forage the cattle consume. Certain grasses contain compounds that can break down into substances that impart a fishy or gamey flavor. It is not the grass feeding but what kind of grass.\nCan omega-3 fatty acids make beef taste fishy? While grass-fed beef is higher in omega-3 fatty acids, the presence of omega-3s themselves doesn’t automatically cause a fishy taste. The specific type of forage leading to a fishy flavor can sometimes be associated with higher omega-3s, but it’s the other compounds, not the omega-3s themselves, that are the primary culprits.\nHow can you tell if ground beef has gone bad? Use your senses. Smell: Spoiled ground beef will have a sour, ammonia-like, or fishy odor. Touch: It might feel slimy or sticky. Sight: The color might be dull, brown, or even greenish. If in doubt, throw it out!\nIs it safe to eat ground beef that smells a little off? It’s generally not safe to eat ground beef that smells “a little off.” Even a slight off odor can indicate the beginning stages of spoilage. It’s always best to err on the side of caution and discard the meat.\nHow long does ground beef last in the fridge? According to the USDA, ground beef is safe in the refrigerator for only 1-2 days. If you’re not going to use it within that time, freeze it for longer storage.\nWhat happens if you cook and eat spoiled ground beef? Eating spoiled ground beef can lead to foodborne illness , with symptoms like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps. Bacteria like Salmonella and E. coli can thrive in spoiled meat.\nDoes bad steak smell like fish? Yes, bad steak can smell like fish, sulfur, or ammonia. It may also have a tacky texture and a brownish or greenish hue.\nWhat if the ground beef smells fine but tastes fishy after cooking? If the ground beef smelled fine before cooking but tastes fishy afterward, it could still be a sign of subtle spoilage that wasn’t detectable by smell alone. It could also be the type of grass if it is grass-fed. It’s best not to risk it and to avoid consuming it.\nCould my cooking utensils or cookware be causing the fishy taste? Yes, if your cooking utensils or cookware are not properly cleaned, residual food particles or odors can transfer to the burger. Make sure everything is thoroughly washed, especially if you’ve recently cooked seafood.\nWhy does food suddenly taste like fish to me? If you notice a fishy taste across various foods, you might be experiencing dysgeusia . This could be due to medications, pregnancy, vitamin deficiencies, or underlying health conditions. Consult your doctor.\nDoes freezing ground beef kill the bacteria that cause spoilage? Freezing doesn’t kill bacteria , but it does slow down their growth significantly. When you thaw frozen ground beef, the bacteria can become active again. Always cook thawed ground beef thoroughly.\nIs grass-fed beef healthier than grain-fed beef? Grass-fed beef generally has a slightly different nutrient profile than grain-fed beef, often containing more omega-3 fatty acids and CLA (conjugated linoleic acid). However, both types of beef can be part of a healthy diet. The Environmental Literacy Council, at enviroliteracy.org, can provide more information on the environmental impact of different farming practices. It is important to consider the environmental impact of your food choices. The Environmental Literacy Council offers valuable resources to understand these complexities.\nHow can I minimize the gamey taste in grass-fed beef? Marinating grass-fed beef can help reduce the gamey taste. You can also try searing it quickly over high heat to develop a flavorful crust and avoid overcooking it. Choosing a source known for milder-tasting grass-fed beef is also key.\nCan adding lemon juice or vinegar to the ground beef help remove the fishy taste? Adding acidic ingredients like lemon juice or vinegar won’t remove the fishy taste caused by spoilage or diet. In fact, they might further react with the spoiled compounds and make the taste even more unpleasant. If you suspect spoilage, discard the meat.\nFinal Thoughts Pinpointing the reason behind a fishy-tasting hamburger requires careful consideration. Prioritize safety by checking for spoilage and practicing proper food handling. Explore the possibility of dietary influences if you’re consuming grass-fed beef. And don’t overlook the potential for altered taste perception. By understanding the causes and taking preventive measures, you can ensure that your next hamburger is a delicious and enjoyable experience.",

    "text": "Former USC football wide receiver Jordan Addison was arrested on July 12 after he was found asleep at the wheel near the Los Angeles International Airport on suspicion of driving under the influence. Upon his return to training camp this week, Addison spoke on the arrest publicly for the first time. Addison noted that he was \"surprised\" by the support he received from the Minnesota Vikings, and credits that for helping him come out of a \"dark place.\" \"I was surprised by the support that I received,\" Addison said after training camp Wednesday . \"I didn't think it was going to be how it was, but it was really important. I was in the dark place. I was feeling down, and they really uplifted me.\" Vikings head coach Kevin O'Connell said they were \"disappointed\" in Addison, but also wanted to help his development off the field. \"We care about these players, we really do, and we want to make sure we're doing our part for development on the field,\" O'Connell said this week . \"The other aspect of that is off the field and the life skills, development, decision-making ... that our players understand personal responsibility and accountability.\" While Addison has the support and help of his team, the second-year pro is ready to face any discipline that will come his way in the aftermath of the arrest. \"Any disciplinary actions that come my way I'm going to stand tall, face it, get through it and shake back,\" Addison said. \"I'll own up to everything, and I feel like anything that comes my way is meant to happen or is deserved, so I'll do what I've got to do.\" Addison had previously gotten into trouble with the law before his first NFL training camp in 2023 when he was arrested after allegedly driving 140 miles per hour in a 55 mph zone. He pled guilty to a misdemeanor charge and had his driver's license revoked for six months. More USC: Lincoln Riley Believes Late Pac-12 Coach of Year Deserves Hall of Fame Nod",

    "text": "Primeiro-ministro aponta também que o seu Governo, que se encontra em gestão, antecipou “em dois anos o aumento do complemento solidário para idosos “para que todos os pensionistas tenham o seu rendimento acima do limiar de pobreza” O primeiro-ministro considera que em 2024 vai haver um aumento do rendimento das famílias, destacando as subidas do salário mínimo, das pensões, de um conjunto de prestações sociais e a descida do IRS. “Em 2024, o rendimento das famílias vai continuar a melhorar”, escreve António Costa em mensagens que publicou este domingo, véspera de Ano Novo, [na sua conta na rede social X](https://twitter.com/antoniocostapm/status/1741409156647534786). “O salário mínimo nacional aumenta para 820 euros, o maior aumento de sempre; as pensões são atualizadas entre 5% e 6%, acima da inflação; e a diminuição do IRS continua e abrange todos os rendimentos”, sustenta o líder do executivo. Na sua mensagem, o primeiro-ministro, que se demitiu deste cargo no passado dia 7 de novembro, aponta também que o seu Governo, que se encontra em gestão, antecipou “em dois anos o aumento do complemento solidário para idosos “para que todos os pensionistas tenham o seu rendimento acima do limiar de pobreza”. “O abono de família tem um aumento de 22 euros por mês e o valor de referência da garantia para a infância passa para 122 euros por mês”, refere. Também segundo António Costa, o IRS Jovem “é reforçado, passando a ser 0% no primeiro ano de trabalho”. “Os estudantes até 23 anos passam a ter o passe gratuito. É criado o prémio salarial de 697 euros ou 1.500 euros para os primeiros anos de trabalho de licenciados e mestres”, assinala ainda o líder do executivo.",
