    "title": "Buenas noticias para las personas que buscan empleo: las ofertas de trabajo incluirán esto en 2024",
    "text": "La\nUnión Europea ha hecho caso a los trabajadores y por fin obligará a las empresas a incluir en las ofertas de empleo algo que todos demandaban. Cuando entramos en un proceso de selección, queremos conocer todos los detalles posibles antes de tomar la decisión final sobre el puesto. Entre todos los aspectos que se suelen destacar siempre hay uno que echamos en falta y que es vital para decidir si nos decantamos por elegir ese lugar de trabajo. Desde bruselas se quiere ayudar a los solicitantes de empleo a poner este requisito en todos los procesos de selección.\nLa medida afectará directamente a todas las sociedades que operan en alguno de los 27 países miembros de la UE y su plazo de transición para su aplicación durará hasta junio de 2026. A partir de esa fecha, todos los que oferten un trabajo deberán poner al detalle todos los pormenores del contrato, incluido esto que siempre es lo más polémico. Los trabajadores aplauden esta decisión, porque la mayoría de interesados consideran este aspecto esencial antes de inscribirse en una oferta. Según el portal Infojobs, 9 de cada 10 personas considera que este requisito debe estar incluido en las ofertas de empleo.\nHasta junio de 2026 no será obligatorio señalar este apartado que muchos piden, pero sí es recomendable para las empresas que empiecen a incluirlo, al menos, en los procesos de selección y las entrevistas. De esta manera, la UE quiere avanzar hacia la transparencia total en estos trámites que son tan importantes para las personas que quieren acceder a un puesto de trabajo.\nConoce cuánto cobrarás antes de la decisión final\nLa Unión Europea aprobó en mayo de este año Ley de Transparencia Salarial por la que todas las empresas estarán obligadas a incluir el salario que cobrará la persona que finalmente se haga con ese puesto de trabajo. A pesar de que la Directiva de la Unión Europea 2023/970 entró en vigencia hace unos meses, no será hasta el 7 de junio de 2026 cuando todos los gobiernos tengan que cumplir con esta exigencia. Durante este plazo de transposición obligatorio, las organizaciones tendrán que acatar la normativa que será aplicable a:\n- Todos los trabajadores que tengan contrato de trabajo o relación laboral.\n- Las personas que soliciten empleo.\n- Los empleados de los sectores públicos y privados.\nLa UE quiere reforzar el principio de igualdad de salarios por un mismo trabajo entre hombres y mujeres y así prohibir la brecha salarial por género. Según satos de la propia Unión Europea, en el año 2020, los hombres ganaban un 13% más que las mujeres por realizar el mismo empleo. Esta\ndesigualdad salarial es uno de los objetivos que quieren reducir desde Bruselas. Además, el Consejo también piensa que poner el sueldo en la oferta de trabajo favorecerá competencia entre empresas y contribuirá en que los interesados puedan ganar más dinero.\nLos trabajadores están contentos\nLa mayoría de personas que buscan un empleo confiesan que el salario es uno de los puntos clave antes de dar el paso hacia ese empleo, sin embargo, no es el único. Las condiciones laborales, las horas que trabajarás, el lugar donde se encuentra la empresa o los compañeros también influyen en esta decisión. Estos datos deben ser razonables y creíbles, y siempre de acuerdo con el perfil del puesto.\nInfojobs ha realizado una encuesta a sus usuarios en la que 9 de cada 10 suscritos apoyan que esta ley se lleve a cabo. Es vital que las empresas muestren transparencia en estos procesos, ya que la mitad de los encuestados consideran que este aspecto también es importante para confiar en ese trabajo.",

    "title": "Should parents buy school supplies for the entire class? TikTok is divided",
    "text": "“Communal” school supply lists are rattling parents on TikTok, with some asking, “Why should I buy scissors and highlighters for other children?”\nFor many families, back-to-school shopping includes notebooks, markers and folders, not just for their kids but for their peers as well. While certain states require schools to provide basic supplies, classroom budgets are tight. To ensure that all children have enough supplies — we’ve seen how kids treat pencils, right? — teachers often have two options: pay for a portion of supplies themselves, usually without reimbursement , or create “wish lists” requesting families to contribute bulk items once or twice a year.\nIf you’re asked to buy two dozen glue sticks, it’s either because teachers expect your child to use every single one this year or they benefit students whose families can’t afford to buy supplies. Extras are also handy when items go missing or break. Teachers may ask parents to buy specific brands or basic, nondescript supplies without branding or flourishes. Sometimes teachers request bigger items, too, like whiteboard markers, disinfecting wipes and tissues.\nEach teacher has their own system but most agree that no one wants to snatch Billy’s favorite Spider-Man eraser and give it to his mortal enemy. While specific guidelines vary by classroom, the purpose of general supplies is that they all look the same and are there for the taking as needed.\nSome parents contribute, others cannot. And some have complicated feelings about the responsibility.\nOne mom on TikTok wrote, “I spent upwards of $400 on school stuff for seven kids a year. I am not buying for a whole class” while another simply said, “Some parents don’t like to share apparently.”\nFrances Chie, a mom in Ohio, wants to buy personalized supplies for her 3-year-old daughter who is entering preschool this year, but not necessarily her peers. While their school only asks families to buy supplies for their own children, Chie suspects that communal supplies are in her future.\n“If my baby wants Disney Princess pencils, a pencil case (and) erasers and I go and buy them, why wouldn’t she be using them?” Chie said in a TikTok video.\n@lovefranceschiee What are your thoughts? 🤔 | #schoolsupplies #backtoschool #momsoftiktok #greenscreen\n♬ original sound – Love Frances Chie 💕 Parents and teachers responded:\n“I will label each crayon individually with my child’s name, a whole 128 pack. I don’t care.” “What I buy for my children is THEIRS. And I will be telling their teachers the same.” “As a teacher, I understand this but also, we have to pay for so much of it.” “First grade teacher here. The only supplies I use as community supplies are pencils and glue sticks, only because they need help managing supplies at this age. They will need 24 pencils, just not on Day One.” “I don’t think most parents understand how much little kids lose or break pencils and crayons.” “Teachers have to handle 18 to 25 children. Please just do whatever your teacher wants you to do.” Chie tells TODAY.com that she and her daughter are excited to find supplies branded with Disney, Bluey and unicorns.\n“If parents are going school shopping with their little ones, and picking out things that (reflect) their special interests … those kids should use those supplies,” she says.\nChie says she was surprised to learn that many teachers pay for classroom decorations and supplies with their own money and she would be happy to donate more communal items, like paper towels, hand sanitizer and tissues to the classroom, but draws the line at more personal items.\nSarah Spikeston, a Texas mom and community college professor, is in favor of communal school supplies. (@sarahspikeston via TikTok) Sarah Spikeston of Texas pays a flat fee to her daughter’s private school to purchase communal supplies while her son’s private Montessori preschool allows for both personal and shared items.\n“As someone who was chronically poor growing up and homeless for parts of (my youth), meeting the needs of all kids, regardless of their circumstances, is really important to me,” Spikeston, a community college professor in Texas, tells TODAY.com via email.\nShe adds: “I know what it’s like to be the kid that’s left without and that classrooms run more efficiently when they are fully stocked and there’s some level of uniformity in supplies.”\nSpikeston says some parents dislike buying generic brands but kids don’t care about sharing supplies, especially when they’re expressing their individuality elsewhere.\n“We have to remember that any of us could begin to struggle in the blink of an eye,” says Spikeston. “Those of us that are blessed to be able to afford school supplies have a duty to the community because the community in turn funds our public schools.”\nTodd Bloch, a middle school science teacher in Michigan, understands that supplies are expensive and that families may have brand favorites or want to label their children’s supplies.\nSupply lists are a “balancing act” for teachers, too.\n“It’s difficult to know exactly what we need going into the school year, especially when store sales usually happen in June,” Bloch tells TODAY.com.\nWhen parents can afford to buy supplies, says Bloch, it saves teachers from diving into their classroom budgets so they can spend that money elsewhere — like baking soda and vinegar to demonstrate chemical reactions with a “cool” fizz, he says.\nWith experience, Bloch has fine-tuned his supply list: kids trace perfect circles using cheap paper coffee cups instead of compasses, technological information can be stored in the cloud versus flash drives, and standard pencils trump refillable mechanical tools. When Bloch’s students built solar ovens with aluminum foil and cardboard, they brought in their family’s used pizza boxes. It helps that Bloch’s school reimburses him a portion of what he spends. If Bloch wants to do something special, like reward his students with Jolly Ranchers, he pays out of his own pocket.\nBloch communicates his recommendations for supplies to parents and reassures students they will be fully prepared, one way or another.\n“Teachers just want to create an equitable experience for students,” says Bloch. “If parents can’t help make that happen, most teachers totally understand.”\nThis story first appeared on TODAY.com .

    "text": "New Delhi, July 11 (IANS) Asserting that longstanding goals such as capacity building and economic cooperation have acquired a new urgency, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar on Thursday called for deepening and broadening of activities between the Bay of Bengal countries. \"Global and regional developments also make it imperative that we find more solutions amongst ourselves,\" he said in his opening remarks at the two-day 2nd BIMSTEC Foreign Ministers' Retreat which began in New Delhi. \"For India, BIMSTEC (Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation) represents the interaction of the 'Neighbourhood First' outlook, the 'Act East' policy and the SAGAR vision. Each of these endeavours is being purposed with a specific focus on the Bay of Bengal by the collaborative potential that has long remained under-realised. Our challenge is to change that for the better and to do so rapidly,\" he stated. The EAM is hosting his counterparts for the significant meet which brings together seven countries of South and South East Asia for multifaceted cooperation. \"The Retreat will present an opportunity for the Foreign Ministers of the BIMSTEC countries to discuss, in an informal setting, avenues to broaden and deepen cooperation across various sectors including in the fields of security, connectivity, trade and investment, people to people contacts etc, in the Bay of Bengal region and littoral,\" the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said in a statement. The first edition of the BIMSTEC Foreign Ministers' Retreat was held in Bangkok in July 2023 as India continues to reiterate its commitment to promote connectivity and linkages in the shared Bay of Bengal region. Bangladesh Foreign Minister Hasan Mahmud, Thailand Foreign Minister Maris Sangiampongsa (current BIMSTEC chair), Bhutan Foreign Minister D.N. Dhungyel, Nepal Foreign Secretary Sewa Lamsal and Myanmar's Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister U Than Swe and State Minister of Foreign Affairs of Sri Lanka Tharaka Balasuriya are attending the meeting which is expected to bolster regional cooperation. Last month, as he congratulated Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the BJP-led NDA's third consecutive term, Thailand Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin said that he is already looking forward to the Indian leader's visit to the country in September this year for the BIMSTEC Summit. \"While Prime Minister Modi will be visiting Thailand in September this year to attend the BIMSTEC Summit; on my part, I look forward to paying an official visit to India at the earliest opportunity to realise the full potential of our relations,\" said Thavisin.

    "text": "原标题：普通操作工离职跳槽后，竟被索赔高额违约金（主题）\n法院审理认为：竞业限制需平衡商业秘密保护与劳动者权益，不能过度限制自主择业权（副题）\n工人日报-中工网记者 吴铎思 通讯员 肖君\n离职跳槽后，竟被老东家索赔竞业限制违约金480余万元及500万元损失费。近日，新疆乌鲁木齐市中级人民法院针对这一劳动争议案件作出终审判决，驳回新疆某公司与前员工陈某的竞业限制纠纷上诉，维持一审陈某仅需返还竞业限制补偿金29978.07元的判决。\n2021年7月，陈某入职新疆某公司担任冷氢化车间外操，双方签订《竞业限制协议》，约定离职后两年内不得入职竞争企业，在双方解除、终止劳动关系后，该公司向陈某支付竞业限制补偿金，金额为其离开前12个月工资总额的三分之一。若在支付竞业限制补偿期间发现陈某有违约行为，须退还公司已经支付的竞业限制补偿；按照其离职前12个月工资总额的30倍为标准向公司支付违约金；公司的损失按500万元计算等。\n2023年2月，陈某离职，该公司通过电子邮件向陈某告知需履行竞业限制义务，自2023年3月15日至2024年6月14日共向陈某支付竞业限制补偿金30078.08元。\n陈某于2024年1月入职了另一家能源企业从事检修工作。前东家以陈某违约提起劳动仲裁及诉讼，要求他支付竞业限制违约金4812380.7元（离职前12个月工资总额160412.69元×30倍）、赔偿公司损失500万元、返还已支付的竞业限制补偿金29978.07元，并继续履行竞业限制义务。\n陈某认为，他在原公司只是一线普通操作工，未接触核心技术，公司滥用协议限制了其择业自由。原公司则认为，陈某在多晶硅冷氢化车间从事外操主操工作，虽非高级管理人员和高级技术人员，但属于典型的其他负有保密义务的人员。\n乌鲁木齐市米东区人民法院一审认为，陈某非高管或高技人员，用人单位未举证其实际接触核心技术或具体保密措施，仅凭协议无法认定其涉密。竞业限制需平衡商业秘密保护与劳动者权益，用人单位未证明陈某涉密性，协议存在权利失衡风险。判决陈某返还已收取的29978.07元补偿金，驳回其他诉请。\n新疆某公司选择了上诉。二审期间，乌鲁木齐市中级人民法院组织当事人进行了证据交换和质证。新的证据表明，2024年10月该公司通过电子邮件向陈某发送的《竞业限制终止通知书》中称，自2024年10月18日陈某无须履行竞业限制义务，竞业限制义务即行终止，同时也不再支付竞业限制补偿金。乌鲁木齐市中级人民法院根据查明事实和相关法律规定，驳回上诉，维持原判。\n该案法官称，由于竞业限制条款的缔约双方地位并不平等，劳动者为了顺利地工作，通常没有能力拒签竞业限制条款，并且竞业限制条款对劳动者将来工作会产生巨大的影响，劳动者往往对此缺乏判断能力，所以不能仅通过劳动者签订了竞业限制协议就推定其接触或知悉用人单位的商业秘密和与知识产权相关的保密事项。\n法官表示，签订竞业限制协议有利于保持原用人单位的竞争力，降低用人成本。与此同时，竞业限制条款在一定程度上限制了劳动者的择业自由。市场经济的活力在于竞争，人才流动是竞争的动力，若非合理地、过度地限制劳动者自主择业权，最终将不利于促进市场诚信与激发市场活力，反而会妨碍经营主体的创新动力。\n关于我们 |版权声明 | 违法和不良信息举报电话：010-84151598 | 网络敲诈和有偿删帖举报电话：010-84151598\nCopyright © 2008-2025 by www.workercn.cn. all rights reserved",

    "text": "Die Wahrheit über Burnout, die viele nicht hören wollen\nBurnout und chronische Erschöpfung nehmen immer weiter zu. Eine Expertin erklärt, warum so viele im Job leiden und das Phänomen überhaupt existiert.\nWer im Job nur noch zynische Kommentare von sich gibt, nichts mehr auf die Reihe bekommt und beim Gedanken an den nächsten Montag nicht schlafen kann, hat vermutlich ein Burnout. So wie immer mehr Deutsche: Laut AOK-Daten hat sich die Anzahl der Arbeitsunfähigkeitsfälle durch Burnout von 2014 auf 2023 um 50 Prozent erhöht.\nHochgerechnet auf die Gesamtzahl von 35 Millionen gesetzlich Versicherten waren damit 2023 etwa 186.000 Menschen mit insgesamt 4,7 Millionen Fehltagen wegen eines Burnouts krankgeschrieben. 61 Prozent der Deutschen befürchten laut einer Studie der Betriebskrankenkasse Pronova, an einem Burnout zu erkranken. Elf Prozent mehr als noch vor sechs Jahren.\n„Die Burnout-Statistiken sind in letzter Zeit dramatisch in die Höhe geschossen“, sagt Anna Katharina Schaffner BuzzFeed News Deutschland von IPPEN.MEDIA. Die Burnout-Expertin und Kulturhistorikerin hat mehrere Bücher über das Phänomen geschrieben, 2024 erschien ihr Buch „Erschöpft? Belebende Perspektiven für müde Menschen“.\nBurnout von der WHO nicht als psychisches Leiden definiert – Expertin sieht „Paradox“\nIn Deutschland wird ein Burnout nicht als Krankheit, sondern als Zustand physischer und psychischer Erschöpfung definiert. Er wird unter der Diagnosegruppe Z73 „Probleme mit Bezug auf Schwierigkeiten bei der Lebensbewältigung“ zusammengefasst, orientiert sich an der alten Richtlinie ICD-10, die von der WHO schon längst weiterentwickelt wurde. Manche Psychiater kritisieren immer noch, dass „Burnout“ eine Modediagnose sei, um das Wort „Depression“ (laut WHO eine psychische Störung) nicht benutzen zu müssen.*\nSchaffner sieht das anders: „Ein Burnout ist das direkte Resultat von chronischem Arbeitsstress“ und unterscheide sich ganz deutlich von Depression und anderen Lebenskrisen, sagt sie BuzzFeed News Deutschland. Dass die Weltgesundheitsorganisation (WHO) es als „beruflich bedingte Erkrankung und nicht als psychisches Leiden“ definiere, bezeichnet sie als „Burnout-Paradox“. Denn damit werde Betroffenen suggeriert, dass sie nicht „erfolgreich genug“ mit chronischem Stress im Job umgingen, wo sie sich frage, wie das überhaupt aussehen solle.\nDie Strukturen der Arbeitswelt würden es Einzelpersonen sehr schwer machen, etwas gegen die Erschöpfung im Job zu unternehmen. Für viele sei das Ausgebrannt-sein trotzdem mit Scham und Schuldgefühlen besetzt. Doch die Wahrheit sei, dass „ein Burnout auf jeden Fall nicht nur ein individualpsychologisches Problem ist, sondern ganz klar eine sozial-kulturelle Dimension hat, weil wir Arbeitswelten geschaffen haben, die extrem toxisch und schädlich sind für unsere Psychen“, sagt Schaffner.\nWarum Burnout als Diagnose-Begriff „extrem wichtig“ ist\nLaut der Burnout-Expertin gibt es in der „Arbeitswelt des 21. Jahrhunderts ganz spezifische psychosoziale und ökonomische Stressfaktoren. Viele davon sind heimtückisch“, sagt sie. Zum Beispiel das Konkurrenzdenken im Job, der Wachstumszwang und die ständige Gewinnmaximierung in Unternehmen. Technologie wie Social Media erleichterten zwar die Kommunikation, mache uns jedoch auch abhängig, denn „durch die ständige Erreichbarkeit können wir dem, was uns stresst, kaum mehr entkommen“.\nWegen all dieser Dinge litten immer mehr Menschen an chronischen Erschöpfungszuständen und nicht etwa, weil Burnout eine „Modediagnose“ sei. „Immer mehr Menschen leiden auf der Arbeit und an der Arbeit; immer mehr Menschen finden es extrem schwierig, Arbeitsthemen am Abend loszulassen; immer mehr Menschen schaffen es nicht mehr, eine gute Work-Life-Balance aufrechtzuerhalten.“\nHinzu käme, dass die Gesellschaft mehr und offener über Burnouts spreche. Auch die ökonomische Unsicherheit, die Bedrohung durch den Klimawandel sowie Kriege und die Pandemie würden sich auf die Burnout-Zahlen auswirken: „Wenngleich auch unsere Vorfahren mit Erschöpfung zu kämpfen hatten, besteht kein Zweifel, dass wir in Zeiten besonders raschen Wandels mit besonders komplexen und beunruhigenden Problemen leben.“\nSchaffner findet es „extrem wichtig“, dass wir „Burnout“ als Diagnose-Begriff nutzen. „Wir müssen verstehen, dass wir mit unserem Leiden an und auf der Arbeit nicht alleine sind. Dass es dafür klare strukturelle, gesellschaftliche und technologische Gründe gibt“, sagt sie. „Es ist wichtig, Burnout nicht nur durch die individualpsychologische Linse zu sehen, sondern auch als ein ernstes strukturelles Problem unserer Zeit.“\n*In einer vorherigen Version haben wir nicht erwähnt, dass die Richtlinie ICD-10 zum Burnout, an der sich Deutschland orientiert, veraltet ist. Wir haben die betreffende Stelle korrigiert.",
