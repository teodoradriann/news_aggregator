    "text": "Jubilee 2025: There is always something good’, says Pope opening the Holy Door at the Rebibbia prison\nToday, the Feast of St Stephen, Pope Francis visited a prison, a “cathedral of pain”, home for 285 inmates. He led Holy Mass at the Church of Our Father. In his homily, the pontiff said that “Hope never disappoints!” At the Angelus in St Peter's, he called for the cancellation of the debt of “oppressed” countries.\nRome (AsiaNews) – In Rome, not only the papal basilicas will guard the holy doors for the jubilee year that has begun, but after St Peter's, they will open on the 29th at St. John Lateran, on 1 January at St Mary Major, and on 5th January at St Paul's Outside the Walls.\nToday, Saint Stephen's, the second Holy Door was opened, or rather, to cite Pope Francis, it was thrown open wide, at the Rebibbia Prison, an institution that houses 285 inmates.\n\"The grace of a Jubilee is to open wide, open and, above all, open hearts to hope,\" the pontiff said this morning in the Church of Our Father, which reopened after four years. Hope is a \"cathedral of pain\" and a \"basilica in quotation marks\" that represents salvation for those waiting inside, uncertain.\nThe symbolic act was carried out today in this place, a symbol of thresholds and human marginality, where God lives and does not forget those at the bottom, an act that reminds us of his presence.\n“He awaits us at the threshold,” the pope said yesterday during the Urbi et Orbi Christmas message. “He awaits each one of us, especially the most vulnerable.” The latter include the elderly, those who live in a place of war, those who lost their homes or jobs, the persecuted, inmates.\nSpeaking to the Italian news agency SIR, the chaplain of Rebibbia, Fr Lucio Boldrin, said: “The opening of the Holy Door wants to be this cry; let us reopen to hope even those who have made mistakes in the world”.\n\"Hope never disappoints!” Francis said in his homily in the Holy Mass he led, starting 9:00 am. “Think carefully about this. I think so too, because in bad moments one thinks that everything is over, that nothing is resolved. But hope never disappoints.”\nPope Francis evoked hope that does not abandon with the image of an anchor from which a firm rope extends to cling to. “Sometimes the rope is hard and hurts our hands... but with the rope, always with the rope in hand, looking at the shore, the anchor carries us forward. There is always something good, there is always something that keeps us going,\" he explained.\nWide open doors, however, must not be just an aesthetic artefact, unable to inform human minds. They must be an opportunity for a great opening, especially of the \"door of the heart\".\n\"When the heart is closed, it becomes hard as a stone; it forgets tenderness. Even in the most difficult situations.” Instead, “Always an open heart; the heart, which is precisely what makes us brothers and sisters. Open wide the doors of the heart. Everyone knows how to do it. Everyone knows where the door is closed or half-closed. Everyone knows.”\nAt the end of the Holy Mass, Pope Francis addressed Christmas greetings to the prisoners, \"who remained in their cells”. “May next year be better than this one. Every year has to be better,\" he said. “The hands that cling. Don't forget that. Happy New Year to everyone.”\nA few hours later, the pontiff appeared at the window of the Vatican Apostolic Palace for the recitation of the Angelus on the feast day of Saint Stephen, the first martyr of Christianity.\nIn the commentary that preceded the Marian prayer, the pontiff spoke at length about the stoning of the protomartyr in the Acts of the Apostles (cf. 6:8-12; 7:54-60), when he “prays for his killers.” Even though he appears to be “helplessly\" suffering violence, “in reality, as a truly free man, he continues to love even his killers and to offer his life for them, like Jesus,” Francis said.\nThe deacon Stephen “offers his life so that they may repent and, having been forgiven, be given eternal life.” In doing so, he “appears to us as a witness of that God who has one great desire: ‘that all men be saved’”.\nHe then turned to those who are discriminated in the world today because of their faith. “Unfortunately, even today there are, in various parts of the world, many men and women who are persecuted, at times up to death, because of the Gospel. What we have said about Stephen applies to them too,” Pope Francis said.\n“They do not allow themselves to be killed out of weakness, nor to defend an ideology, but to make everyone participants in the gift of salvation. And they do so first and foremost for the good of their killers: for the killers … and they pray for them.”\nFrancis remembered the “Blessed Christian de Chergé, who called his future killer a ‘last minute friend’.” After the Angelus, he addressed the international community for the Holy Year that has just begun.\n“One of the actions that characterizes Jubilees is the forgiving of debts. I therefore encourage everyone to support the Caritas Internationalis campaign entitled ‘Turn debt into hope’, to relieve countries oppressed by unsustainable debts and to promote development.”\n“The question of debt is linked to that of peace and the ‘black market’ of weapons. No more colonizing peoples with weapons! Let us work for disarmament, let us work against hunger, against disease, against child labour. And let us pray, please, for peace throughout the world!”\nThe pontiff also expressed hope for peace in tormented Ukraine, Gaza, Israel, Myanmar, North Kivu, and “many countries that are at war.”",

    "text": "NATO Air Command press release Taking off from the Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier currently sailing in the Mediterranean Sea off the Greek coast, the E2C flew into Romania to conduct a flight participating in NATO’s Air Shielding mission and supporting the deterrence and defence posture in the region. The Hawkeye was refueled on the ground at Borcea Air Base, Romania, in a short Agile Combat Employment stopover. Supported by Romanian ground crews, this manoeuvre allowed extending its effective time on task for missions under NATO’s enhanced Vigilance Activity Neptune Strike 24-1. Allied naval and amphibious forces participating in Neptune Strike are deployed across the European theatre and conduct complex integrated missions among others with Allied air assets NATO Air Command official website This procedure enabled the E2C aircraft to execute the task and return to the Charles de Gaulle carrier and demonstrated interoperability among Allies during combined multi-domain operations. During Neptune Strike 24-1, for the first time, the French aircraft carrier sails under the authority of NATO. Its embarked assets including the French Navy’s Hawkeye and Rafale fighter jets participate in the activities until May 9 demonstrating NATO’s ability to integrate joint high-end maritime strike capabilities. Primarily, NEST prepares NATO to use and integrate the high-end maritime strike capabilities of Alliance nations; enabling their consideration and employment to deter threats to the Alliance. Under the overall command and control of NATO’s Naval Striking and Support Forces, Allied naval and amphibious forces participating in Neptune Strike are deployed across the European theatre and conduct complex integrated missions among others with Allied air assets. This showcases that besides training across large distances, the Alliance and its members also maintain their ability to conduct standing enduring missions like Air Policing that keeps NATO territory safe.",

    "text": "Flu Vaccines Market Set for 6.7% CAGR Growth Through 2033 - Persistence Market Research 07-31-2025 06:32 AM CET | Health & Medicine\nPress release from: Persistence Market Research Flu Vaccines Market\nWith respiratory diseases remaining a perennial threat to public health, influenza (\"flu\") continues to drive healthcare priorities worldwide. The flu vaccines market plays a vital role in reducing infections, hospitalizations, and mortality rates associated with seasonal and pandemic flu outbreaks. According to persistence market research, the global flu vaccines market was valued at approximately US$5.40 billion in 2023 and is projected to more than double, reaching US$10.19 billion by 2033 at a CAGR of 6.7%. This article delivers a comprehensive exploration of market drivers, segmentation, regional dynamics, and the evolving competitive landscape.\n✅Get a Sample Copy of Research Report (Use Corporate Mail id for Quick Response): https://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/28720\n✅Overview of the Market\nFlu vaccines, or influenza vaccines, are biological agents designed to stimulate the body's immune response by producing antibodies against influenza viruses. After administration, immunity typically develops within two weeks, significantly lowering the risk of infection and reducing the spread of the highly contagious virus. The flu vaccines market has undergone significant growth, buoyed by persistent awareness campaigns, robust immunization efforts, and continual innovation in vaccine formulations.\nFrom 2014 to 2022, the global flu vaccines market recorded a steady CAGR of 6.3%. The market presently commands approximately 3.6% of the global vaccine market, illustrating its critical role within the broader immunization landscape. Key growth drivers include increasing flu vaccination rates, cost-effective manufacturing, and regulatory endorsements of advanced quadrivalent vaccines that offer broader protection against circulating viral strains.\nQuadrivalent flu vaccines accounted for nearly 83.8% of the market share in 2022. Their dominance is due to broad coverage-targeting two influenza A and two influenza B strains-and rapid adoption in both developed and developing markets. North America, spearheaded by the United States, leads with an estimated 60.1% global share, primarily as a result of high vaccine production, comprehensive coverage initiatives, and preparedness for both epidemic and pandemic scenarios.\n✅Key Highlights from the Report:\n➤ The global flu vaccines market is forecasted to reach US$10.19 billion by 2033, registering a CAGR of 6.7% over the next decade.\n➤ Quadrivalent vaccines comprise over 83% of total flu vaccine sales, favored for their enhanced efficacy against multiple virus subtypes.\n➤ Intramuscular injections remain the dominant dosage form, accounting for 93.6% of the market due to efficient absorption and established clinical protocols.\n➤ Institutional sales channels, including hospitals and healthcare centers, account for 68.3% of market revenue, ensuring broad product reach and high-volume uptake.\n➤ The United States represents the largest national market, responsible for around 60% of global revenue, driven by strong manufacturing, distribution, and vaccination mandates.\n➤ Market leaders are actively expanding R&D and launching novel vaccine technologies, including mRNA-based formulations and regionally tailored products.\n✅Market Segmentation\nThe flu vaccines market is segmented by product type, dosage form, distribution channel, and end-user demographics.\nBy product type, quadrivalent vaccines are far ahead, constituting the largest market share. They are widely adopted given their effectiveness and broad viral coverage, now considered the gold standard for seasonal influenza immunization in most countries. Trivalent vaccines, although less commonly used due to their narrower protection (covering one B strain rather than two), still serve certain markets or populations where broader immunization policies are not yet in place.\nDosage forms are a critical consideration for patient outcomes and uptake. Intramuscular injections dominate, chosen for their rapid systemic absorption and established safety profile. These vaccines can be administered by a healthcare provider or, in some settings, through pharmacy or community-based programs. Other forms, such as intradermal or intranasal sprays, exist but account for a small portion of the market due to limited availability and specific population guidelines.\nDistribution channels are another layer of segmentation. Institutional sales, particularly to hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies, make up the majority of the market. These settings facilitate high-volume purchases, standardized handling, and the ability to reach at-risk populations through centralized immunization programs. Retail and individual channels play supporting roles, expanding access in non-traditional healthcare settings including workplaces and educational institutions.\n✅Read Detailed Analysis: https://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/market-research/flu-vaccines-market.asp\n✅Regional Insights\nNorth America leads the flu vaccines market, with the United States accounting for well over half of all global revenue. The country's prominence is attributed to consistent supply from major manufacturers, government-backed vaccination campaigns, annual flu season preparedness, and insurance coverage for preventive health services. For the 2022-2033 season, the CDC anticipated delivery of up to 183 million doses, highlighting the scale of annual immunization efforts.\nIn Japan, concerns over avian influenza outbreaks have spotlighted the importance of flu vaccination. The country's rigorous response to bird flu-necessitating large-scale culls-has increased awareness of influenza risks and led to expanded human vaccination programs. This dynamic, plus government-led campaigns, makes Japan a key Asian market for flu vaccines.\nGermany stands out for its comprehensive vaccination coverage and expanding inclusion of vulnerable populations in immunization drives. Programs now target healthy and high-risk children as well as older adults and chronically ill patients, driving up national vaccination rates and reducing the overall healthcare burden during flu seasons.\nChina's flu vaccines market is scaling quickly, supported by regulatory reforms that boost local vaccine production and streamline market access. Annual flu vaccine doses produced in China now reach hundreds of millions, underlining the country's expanding capacity and focus on preparedness for both seasonal and pandemic strains. Enhanced R&D, growing domestic demand, and international collaborations position China as a rising force within the regional and global markets.\n✅Market Drivers\nGross increases in influenza vaccination rates-fueled by public health initiatives and international partnerships-are primary drivers. Organizations such as the WHO, GAVI, and PAHO have launched widespread immunization campaigns, particularly in high-risk and underserved regions.\nCost-effectiveness is another key factor. As manufacturing efficiencies improve and economies of scale are realized, vaccine prices decrease, increasing access in low- and middle-income countries. Local production, especially in fast-growing economies like India and Brazil, ensures affordable supplies and protects populations during outbreaks.\nRising awareness about the efficacy and necessity of flu vaccination further fuels demand, especially during high-mortality seasons or in anticipation of global pandemics. For example, the CDC estimated that flu vaccination during the 2019-2020 season alone prevented over 100,000 hospitalizations in the United States. Ongoing educational campaigns reinforce the importance and benefits of seasonal flu immunization, leading to gradually increasing uptake in many markets.\n✅Market Restraints\nNotwithstanding strong growth, the market faces notable challenges. Chief among these is the gap between supply and demand caused by unpredictable flu season intensity and variable strain predictions from the WHO and health authorities. Some years see vaccine oversupply and wastage, while others experience shortages-particularly if the severity of the season is underestimated.\nManufacturers tend to take conservative production approaches, wary of investing in excess inventory that might go unused. The flu's unpredictable incidence, evolving viral mutations, and the logistical complexities of matching supply to regional demand all dampen market efficiency.\nAdditionally, disparities in vaccine coverage persist between high-income nations and developing economies. Barriers such as infrastructure limitations, cold chain requirements, and vaccine hesitancy hinder full global market realization, particularly in rural or underserved regions.\n✅Market Opportunities\nAn expanding target demographic-including pediatric, elderly, and immunocompromised populations-presents significant opportunities for market growth. As awareness programs increase and guidelines expand to cover healthy children and additional age groups, vaccine demand will correspondingly rise.\nTechnological innovation-especially the development and launch of mRNA-based and other next-generation platforms-promises to revolutionize influenza prevention. These technologies offer the potential for faster updates against new strains, improved efficacy, and enhanced safety profiles.\nStrategic partnerships, mergers, and acquisitions among key biotech players and local producers are accelerating market entry and innovation. For companies, the push to develop regionally adapted, easily administered vaccines (such as intranasal sprays or low-dose formulations) will likely unlock new market segments.\n✅Request for Customization of the Research Report: https://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/request-customization/28720\n✅Reasons to Buy the Report\n✔ Obtain a thorough market forecast to 2033, covering regional and segmental details for actionable strategic planning.\n✔ Identify breakout opportunities in quadrivalent vaccine adoption, new tech platforms, and emerging country markets.\n✔ Benchmark major players and evaluate R&D, manufacturing, and pipeline trends shaping future market share.\n✔ Understand the impact of government policies, public health campaigns, and international collaborations on demand dynamics.\n✔ Access competitive intelligence on recent developments, product launches, and key partnerships across the vaccine landscape.\n✅Company Insights\n✦ Sanofi Pasteur Inc.\n✦ AstraZeneca\n✦ CSL Ltd.\n✦ Abbott\n✦ GlaxoSmithKline plc\n✦ Serum Institute of India Pvt.

    "text": "22/03/2024 - 16:38\nAs fortes chuvas que atingem o estado do Rio de Janeiro nesta sexta-feira (22) interromperam o trânsito de veículos da capital para as cidades serranas de Petrópolis e Teresópolis, atendidas respectivamente pelas rodovias BR-040 e BR-116. Segundo o Centro Estadual de Monitoramento e Alertas de Desastres Naturais (Cemaden), as duas cidades enfrentam risco de deslizamento.\nPetrópolis\nNo momento, a interdição é total no pedágio da rodovia BR-040, que liga o Rio de Janeiro a Petrópolis, na região serrana, quilômetro 102, informou há pouco a Polícia Rodoviária Federal (PRF/RJ). A concessionária Concer (Cia. de Concessão Rodoviária) recomenda aos usuários da BR-040 que não trafeguem pela rodovia, enquanto a tempestade não cessar.\nNotícias relacionadas:\nChuvas levam oito municípios a decretar emergência no Maranhão . Fim do verão terá fortes chuvas em diversas regiões do país.\nA Concer alerta que deve-se evitar, em especial, a serra de Petrópolis, onde já ocorreu deslizamento de terra na pista de subida, devido à chuva extrema, deixando o quilômetro 94 parcialmente interditado. Quem quiser obter informações atualizadas da rodovia pode ligar para o número gratuito 0800 2820040.\nTeresópolis\nDevido às fortes chuvas que atingem o estado do Rio de Janeiro, a concessionária EcoRioMinas interditou totalmente nesta sexta-feira (22) o trecho da serra da estrada BR-116/RJ, que liga o Rio de Janeiro a Teresópolis, na região serrana.\nA concessionária segue em estágio de alerta e monitorando a rodovia, que não tem previsão de liberação. À Agência Brasil, a EcoRioMinas informou, por meio de sua assessoria de imprensa, que a interdição do trecho é uma medida de precaução diante do volume de chuvas porque, quanto mais as chuvas se mantiverem ou se intensificarem, elas podem ocasionar risco de deslizamento.\nAvaliação\nA orientação dada à equipe da concessionária que se encontra no local é esperar a chuva diminuir um pouco para fazer nova avaliação. Não foi registrada, entretanto, nenhuma ocorrência. Não houve deslizamento.\nOs usuários podem acompanhar atualizações sobre o tráfego nas rodovias sob concessão da EcoRioMinas por meio do X (antigo Twitter) @ecoriominas. Em caso de dúvidas e emergências, devem ligar para os telefones 0800 116 0493 e 0800 116 0465 – este para deficientes auditivos. O serviço é gratuito e funciona 24 horas.",

    "text": "National\nGrizzly — son of famed ‘Queen of the Tetons’ — found dead along MT park highway\nOne of the sons of a beloved mother grizzly bear known as “Queen of the Tetons” was hit and killed by a car, just seven months after his famous mama bear was killed in the same way near Yellowstone, officials said.\nGrand Teton National Park rangers found the bear’s body on May 6 along Highway 26 in the park east of the Buffalo Fork River, officials said in a news release.\nLaw enforcement and wildlife rangers coordinated an investigation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and determined the bear was hit by a car and “made it to a patch of willows about 125 yards from the road,” where it died, officials said. The bear may have been dead for several days before being discovered.\nWildlife rangers identified the bear as GB1058, one of the four cubs from GB399 — better known as “Queen of the Tetons” — in May 2020. He had been spotted occasionally in the park since he was weaned in 2022, but there hadn’t been any confirmed sightings of him this spring, officials said.\nThe now 5-year-old bear was “in good condition for his age and the time of year,” and officials put his body “back onto the landscape” in the park.\nGrizzly bear 399 was hit and killed by a car on Highway 26/89 in Snake River Canyon south of Jackson, Wyoming, in October, McClatchy News previously reported. The 28-year-old mother grizzly was the oldest known reproducing grizzly bear in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.\nBoth grizzly bears 399 and her son 1058 were featured in a PBS documentary that premiered in May 2024 where she was crowned “Queen of the Tetons.” The documentary followed her as she raised her four cubs and discussed “human encroachment in bear country” as one of the threats to their survival, McClatchy News reported.\n“Bears, elk, deer, moose, foxes and other wildlife are often near park roadways, difficult to see, and can cross the road unexpectedly,” officials said. “Drivers are reminded to:\nObey the posted speed limit and maintain a safe following distance from other vehicles.\nUse caution and slow down, especially at dawn, dusk and at night when visibility is reduced.\nFollow the nighttime speed limit of 45 miles per hour on U.S. Highway 26/89/191. The reduced speed limit gives drivers and wildlife more time to react.\nPay attention to your surroundings. Speeding is not the only cause of wildlife collisions; park wildlife are often hit because drivers are distracted.\nCall Teton Interagency Dispatch Center at 307-739-3301 to report wildlife-vehicle collisions, or harassment of wildlife in the park.”",
