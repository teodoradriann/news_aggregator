    "title": "Brighton hit Tottenham for four in Amex thriller",
    "text": "Tottenham missed a big opportunity to end the year in the top four as they were beaten 4-2 by Brighton in a thriller that lived up to its billing as the ‘feelgood football’ derby – not least thanks to a wonderful goal from Pervis Estupinan to mark his long-awaited return from injury.\nRespective managers Roberto De Zerbi and Ange Postecoglou have been credited with bringing the joy back to the beautiful game by opting for an attacking, progressive style that has won over fans and critics alike and driven their teams up the table; and it certainly showed at the Amex.\nBut just when it seemed Tottenham were set to put a ribbon on Postecoglou’s present to long-suffering Spurs fans after recovering superbly from a difficult November, his opposite number proved he is perhaps the more developed talent.\nFirst half goals from Jack Hinshelwood and Joao Pedro (the latter a penalty) gave Brighton the advantage in an end-to-end game in which both sides took turns to show off their attacking skills, never swerving from their determination to play football the right way – no matter the scoreline or the intensity of the pressing.\nThen Estupinan, put on at half-time by De Zerbi added a superb, curling finish that reminded Brighton fans what they have been missing (he has played just one game since September) – before Joao Pedro made it 4-0 with another penalty.\nWhat was most impressive about Albion’s performance is that it came despite the club still being plagued by injuries – even taking into consideration Estupinan’s return - with many of them long-term.\nThe jinx continued this week when wingers Kauro Mitoma and Simon Adingra were ruled out for at least five weeks. That made it eight players on the sidelines, all of them first team regulars.\nBut it didn’t seem to affect their attitude or style.\nDanny Welbeck, a player himself only recently back from long-term injury, saw two efforts saved in the opening minutes as Brighton found their feet first – and then boy wonder Jack Hinshelwood ripped home a super opener.\nThe midfielder, asked to play full-back because Brighton don’t have any right-back specialists currently fit, continued his remarkable rise at the age of just 18, and looks a real prospect.\nHe was nerveless as the ball fell to him in the penalty area, firing a shot high into the net past Guglielmo Vicario after being superbly set up by the rapidly improving Joao Pedro. That was the second of his debut season, having also headed a winner against Brentford here at the Amex.\nDefender Jan Paul van Hecke then headed against the post, before Brighton were awarded a penalty when Dejan Kulusevski stupidly dragged down Welbeck, although it took VAR to spot it. Joao Pedro, calmly, made no mistake to make it 2-0 with only 20 minutes on the clock.\nIt could have been 3-0 by half time, but James Milner’s fine effort from the edge of the area cannoned back off a post with Vicario well beaten. Then Facundo Buonanotte had a goal disallowed for offside following a sweeping move from the hosts – and Joao Pedro went clean through but couldn’t squeeze his effort past the visiting keeper.\nTottenham’s defending was woeful, but their saving grace was their pace on the break, which almost earned a goal in first half injury time, when Richarlison’s shot clipped Jason Steele’s near post.\nIt’s no exaggeration to suggest the half could have ended 6-3 to the home side, and nothing changed after the break.\nRicharlison was at the heart of all Tottenham’s good work and he had two goals disallowed for offside early in the second half; but there can be price for attacking with such commitment when you are facing a team more than capable of hurting you on the break. Especially when your defence is porous.\nSo, it was no surprise when Estupinan unleashed his special goal to confirm victory, or when when Lo Celso needlessly gave away penalty for a foul on Evan Ferguson – and Joao Pedro struck again from the spot with 20 minutes still to play.\nEven then there was a late consolation goal from 20-year-old Spurs sub Veliz, underlining Brighton’s inability to keep a clean sheet, and a second from Ben Davies as Spurs threw everything at the home team in a dramatic finale - including hitting the post through Hojbierg in injury time as the action never stopped for a second.\nBut perhaps that’s what everyone loves about the Seagulls; watch them and you’re guaranteed goals at both ends, with end-to-end excitement the name of the game.\nThis result moves De Zerbi’s side up to seventh, while Spurs miss out on a chance to hijack the top four; but the two entertainers, with 33 shots between them, certainly didn’t disappoint the neutrals.\nSteele 7, Hinshelwood 7, Van Hecke 7, Dunk 7, Igor 7 (Estupinan 45; 8), Milner 7 (Moder 69; 6), Gilmour 8, Gross 7, Buonanotte 7 (Baleba 60; 6), Welbeck 8 ( Ferguson 69; 6), Joao Pedro 9 (Lallana 90).\nVerbruggen, Dahoud, Baker-Boaitey, Barrington.\nVicario 7, Porro 6, Royal 5, Davies 7 Udogie 6, Sarr 6 (Gil 65; 7), Hojbjerg 7, Johnson 6 (Veliz 70; 7), Kulusevski 7, Son 6, Richarlison 8 (Lo Celso 65; 6)\nForster, Gil, Dier, Lo Celso, Phillips, Alonso, Donley, Dorrington.",

    "text": "DENVER — Coloradans who had a vehicle or catalytic converter stolen in 2023 may be able to get money to help offset some of the costs of dealing with theft thanks to new funds made available through the state. SB23-257, or the [Auto Theft Prevention Cash Fund,](https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/SB23-257) made available roughly $5 million of general funds to support victims who need help with secondary costs. “The secondary costs aren’t things like vehicle replacement, or vehicle repair, those would be primary costs. These are secondary things that may be unknown to folks when their vehicle is stolen or recovered that we can assist with,” said Cale Gould, Public Outreach Coordinator with the [Colorado Auto Theft Prevention Authority.](https://csp.colorado.gov/services-we-provide/colorado-auto-theft-prevention-authority) Fees covered include money to help offset the costs of towing and storing a stolen vehicle. Gould said some of the fees covered are part of dealing with theft that people might not consider. “Generally if it is either operable or part of a larger investigation, it is taken to a tow yard or a police impound lot. And there's fees associated with that,” said Gould. When [auto theft victims in Colorado](https://www.denver7.com/news/state-news/colorado-car-thefts-are-down-after-pandemic-surge-state-crime-data-shows) do get their vehicle back, they often find it to be in a less than desirable condition. There is assistance to help cover some of the costs of getting the stolen ride back into better condition. “And this will include detailing, cleaning a vehicle to make it again, you know, usable in a comfortable way,” said Gould. Financial assistance might also be available to help cover the costs of temporary transportation like RTD passes and Uber fees when a vehicle is stolen. Catalytic converter theft in Colorado has skyrocketed over the last few years and the state has made available funds to help those victims with secondary costs. [ 3:20 PM, Jul 01, 2023 ](https://www.denver7.com/news/local-news/new-auto-theft-laws-take-effect-in-colorado) Local News New auto theft laws take effect in Colorado Gould said victims can apply for money to help cover hardening devices to protect your catalytic converter from theft. To qualify for assistance for either auto or catalytic converter theft, the vehicle must have had current registration when the theft occurred. An important date to remember is July 1, 2023. Coloradans can apply for help only if they had their vehicle or catalytic converter stolen after July 1. Coloradans who want to get financial help to cover secondary costs due to auto or catalytic converter theft must apply at [lockdownyourcar.org](https://lockdownyourcar.org/) and visit the [victim’s assistance page.](https://lockdownyourcar.org/resources/victims-assistance/) The site details what is covered and how to apply. Gould said the grant application process is made easier by working through a local advocate. “We try and provide a personal response, personal touch to a single person to guide you through the process as it can be very challenging to understand how to apply,” said Gould. “We want to make sure that everybody applies and has guidance in doing such.” The website, through Colorado State Patrol’s Victim Services Unit [lists the various districts throughout the state and which advocate](https://csp.colorado.gov/services-we-provide/victim-rights) serves your local area. While auto theft in Colorado surged over the last couple of years, the state has seen a decline in 2023. [Data from the Colorado Auto Theft Prevention Authority](https://coloradocrimestats.state.co.us/tops/report/mvt/colorado/2023) showed 29,098 vehicles were stolen through October of this year. That's a significant decline from the 41,184 vehicles reported stolen in Colorado throughout 2022. The 2023 data does not reflect November or December thefts. The Denver Police Department also reported a [25 percent decline in auto thefts in 2023, showing 11,865 stolen vehicles](https://denvergov.org/Government/Agencies-Departments-Offices/Agencies-Departments-Offices-Directory/Police-Department/Crime-Information/Additional-Crime-Dashboards) which is down from the 14,813 reported in 2022. While auto thefts in Denver have declined, catalytic converter thefts continued to climb in data reported by DPD in 2023. [ 5:31 PM, Dec 11, 2023 ](https://www.denver7.com/news/state-news/colorado-car-thefts-are-down-after-pandemic-surge-state-crime-data-shows) State News Colorado car thefts are down after pandemic surge, state crime data shows DPD statistics showed 3,022 stolen catalytic converters this year compared to 2,676 thefts in 2022. To give context in those numbers, the vast majority of increases in catalytic converter theft in Denver happened at Denver International Airport at DIA's associated parking and rental car lots. There was a staggering 857 percent increase in catalytic converter theft at DIA in 2023. According to DPD's statistics, all other police districts showed a year-over-year decline in catalytic converter thefts.",

    "text": "Germany’s Bahlsen biscuit empire has apologized for the “painful” findings of a report showing that the company used several times more forced laborers than previously thought during the Nazi period, The Guardian reported on Thursday.\nThe report was commissioned after family heiress Verena Bahlsen caused outrage in 2019 by appearing to play down the hardship suffered by hundreds of people, many of them women from Nazi-occupied Ukraine, forced to work at the family business.\nBahlsen, whose father owns the maker of some of Germany’s most famous biscuits including Choco Leibniz, intimated the firm had done nothing wrong when it used 200 forced laborers during the second world war, saying the company had “treated them well”. She later apologized for her remarks.\nThe study by two historians published this week, however, puts the number of forced laborers, most of whom were from Nazi-occupied Poland and Ukraine, at closer to 800. It also said the forced labor was used for a longer time than previously thought, from 1940 until 1945.\nIn its statement, the Bahlsen family called the findings “uncomfortable and painful” and expressed regret that the company “didn’t confront this difficult truth before now”.\n“We as a family did not pose the obvious question of how our company was able to get through world war II,” said the statement, issued on Tuesday, according to The Guardian.\n“Our ancestors … took advantage of the system in the Nazi period,” the family said, calling the company’s behavior “unforgivable”.\nThe biscuit company, which also makes Leibniz butter cookies, voluntarily paid about €750,000 in 2000-2001 to a foundation set up by German firms to compensate 20 million forced laborers used by the Nazis.",

    "title": "Kathleen Wilson's Minnesota dentist did 30 procedures at once: lawsuit",
    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",
