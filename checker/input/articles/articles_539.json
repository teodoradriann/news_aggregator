    "text": "A 100-year-old veteran of World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War thought he was going to a celebration for his 100th birthday and to honor his contributions to the University of Maryland Global Campus, his alma mater. Instead, Jack Milton this week received the surprise of a lifetime : his long-overdue graduation ceremony.\"I’ve had many ceremonies throughout my life, fortunately, to celebrate many occasions, but this has to be the tops,\" Milton told Fox 5 DC . TEXAS 98-YEAR-OLD WWII VETERAN RECEIVES HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA \"I feel like this is the finale of a long journey in education — and again, I keep using the word appreciative, but I can’t think of any other word,\" he added. Milton, 100, enrolled at the University of Maryland Global Campus in the 1960s while he was working at the Pentagon . At the time, the school was called University of Maryland, University College. Jack Milton, front and center, finally had a graduation ceremony from the University of Maryland Global Campus on Tuesday, April 30. He missed his original ceremony in the 1960s because he was called to serve in Vietnam. (Fox 5 DC) Then, and now, the school caters to non-traditional college students, including veterans, and offers both in-person and distance learning. Milton was a military pilot for 31 years. He amassed more than 12,000 flying hours, said a 2021 article from Achiever, the University of Maryland Global Campus magazine.During his career in the Air Force, Milton was awarded a Distinguished Flying Cross and flew combat missions in Vietnam. TIKTOK STAR AND WWII VETERAN 'PAPA JAKE' TURNS 100, WANTS FUTURE GENERATIONS TO KNOW HIS STORIES Milton had earned enough credits for his bachelor of arts diploma, and was planning on walking the stage at graduation in 1966. But before that could happen, he was deployed to Vietnam.It had always irked him that he never formally received his diploma, he said. Milton earned his bachelor of arts degree in 1966 from the University of Maryland Global Campus, but he couldn't attend his graduation ceremony because he was called to serve in Vietnam. He spent 31 years in the Air Force before retiring from the military. (Fox 5 DC) \"On my way to Southeast Asia, I had many thoughts about not being there to see my fellow graduates,\" Milton said to Fox 5 DC. President Gregory Fowler, PhD, of the University of Maryland Global Campus said it was an honor to present Milton with his diploma and graduation cap — several decades after it was supposed to have happened. CALIFORNIA WWII VETERAN, 103, SHARES REMARKABLE LIFE STORY AND ADVICE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE: 'PRAY EVERY NIGHT' \"I hereby confer upon John L. Milton the degree of bachelor of arts with all the rights and privileges thereto and pertaining. Congratulations,\" said Fowler. Milton, age 100, said he's enjoyed \"a lot of ceremonies\" in his life, but this one was the best of all. (Fox 5 DC) After he returned from Vietnam, Milton, along with his wife, Symantha Milton, remained involved in the University of Maryland Global Campus community. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER They especially supported programs for active military and veterans enrolled at the school. In 2010, the Miltons established the John L. and Symantha Milton Scholarship Fund, which supports another University of Maryland Global Campus scholarship fund specifically for volunteer caregivers of injured military servicemembers, said Achiever.

    "text": "Judge orders suspect in Energy Park shooting, Bernardston home invasion, held without bail |Published: 02-01-2024 5:34 PM| GREENFIELD — A local man facing 15 charges stemming from an alleged shooting at Energy Park and a separate alleged home invasion in Bernardston will remain held without bail, a Franklin County Superior Court judge ruled on Thursday. Gabe Adams, 21, has been deemed too dangerous to release on bail since his arrest and Judge Karen Goodwin opted to keep him locked up as the legal process plays out. A dangerousness ruling allows for a defendant to remain held without bail for 180 days. Assistant District Attorney Joseph Webber, who is prosecuting the cases, said he is prepared for trial at anytime. “The defense can pick the trial date,” he told Goodwin on Wednesday afternoon. In relation to a shooting at Greenfield’s Energy Park in July 2022, Adams has pleaded not guilty to two counts of attempted assault and battery by discharge of a firearm, and single counts of assault and battery by discharging a firearm, discharging a firearm within 500 feet of a building, unlawful possession of a firearm without a license to carry, unlawful possession of a loaded firearm, unlawful possession of ammunition without an FID card and tampering with evidence. In connection to an alleged home invasion in Bernardston two months prior, he has pleaded not guilty to home invasion, armed assault to rob, assault and battery, assault with a dangerous weapon, kidnapping, larceny from a building and intimidation of a witness. Adams had previously been arraigned in Greenfield District Court. His cases were transferred to Superior Court due to their severity. Defense attorney Nora Leovich argued that her client could safely be released on bail into the custody of his father and grandmother, who live in Colrain. Webber explained he unsuccessfully offered Adams a deal consisting of five to seven years in state prison in exchange for a guilty plea. He told Goodwin the home invasion involved Adams allegedly luring someone to a house under false pretenses, only to help assault that person and force them to drive back to their home to steal nicotine products and marijuana. According to Webber, Adams and others he was with then allegedly dropped the victim off on the side of a road in Greenfield and told them not to tell the police. Webber explained that two months later Adams was in Energy Park and allegedly shot a man in the foot following a verbal dispute. Adams allegedly ran from the scene, changed his clothes and tampered with evidence in an attempt to deceive authorities searching for him. Webber said a firearm was found in Adams’ backpack and a friend he was with at the time of the shooting corroborated eyewitnesses’ accounts. “I can’t emphasize enough how serious the commonwealth is taking this,” Webber told Goodwin. “It’s an overwhelmingly strong case against Gabe Adams.” Leovich said that as of Wednesday her client had been held without bail for 567 days. She also said the firearm in question was found in some brush, not a backpack. Leovich explained Adams was placed into the custody of his mother after his father was in a near-fatal car crash in 2005. However, she explained, his mother eventually lost custody and Adams was adopted by a social worker, which is why Adams has a different surname than his father. “He essentially grew up in the system, for one reason or another,” Leovich said, adding that Adams now “has a great deal of family support, and that’s important to him.” Reach Domenic Poli at: dpoli@recorder.com or 413-930-4120.",

Pour mener cette étude, 90 établissements des métropoles de Nantes, Angers et Rennes ont été testés par Addictions France en mai dernier, dont 28 font déjà l'objet de poursuites pénales pour vente d'alcool à des mineurs. Selon Addictions France, qui mène cette étude depuis 2021, 86% de ces enseignes ont vendu de l'alcool à des mineurs.\n\"Comparé à 2021, les chiffres montrent une baisse de la vente aux mineurs à hauteur de 7 points, passant de 93% à 86%, pointe Addictions France. Malgré cette sensible amélioration, en particulier dans les magasins visés par des actions judiciaires, les chiffres confirment que la vente illégale d'alcool aux mineurs reste encore largement répandue\". \"Pas moins de 80% des établissements concernés par une procédure réitèrent la vente, parfois même lorsque de multiples poursuites sont déjà engagées à leur encontre\", s'inquiète l'association.\n\"Parmi les établissements testés pour la première fois, le taux de vente d'alcool aux mineurs reste quasiment identique à celui de 2021 (93% contre 91% en 2025).\"\nAddictions Francefranceinfo\n\"La responsabilisation des débits de boissons est une condition nécessaire, mais manifestement insuffisante\", poursuit Addictions France, émettant plusieurs recommandations. La première est de systématiser les opérations de contrôles d'âge lors de la vente d'alcool. La deuxième est d'instaurer un \"régime de sanctions graduées en fonction du chiffre d'affaires des établissements\". Addictions France demande aussi de systématiser le recours aux sanctions administratives et de garantir la tenue rapide d'audiences judiciaires.",

    "title": "Study Finds Teens with Elevated PFAS Levels Experience Greater Weight",
    "text": "A groundbreaking study from the University of Southern California has unveiled a concerning connection between higher blood levels of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in adolescents undergoing bariatric surgery and a significantly increased risk of postoperative weight regain. These environmental pollutants, ubiquitously present in various consumer products and known for their persistence in the environment and human body, appear to impair the long-term efficacy of surgical weight loss interventions in youth. Published recently in the peer-reviewed journal Obesity, the research elucidates a complex interplay between chemical exposure and metabolic health outcomes that could reshape clinical approaches to obesity management.\nBariatric surgery, an invasive procedure that reconfigures the digestive system to induce substantial weight loss, remains one of the most effective treatments for severe obesity, particularly in adolescents where obesity carries acute and chronic health risks. Despite its efficacy, a significant proportion of patients experience weight regain years after surgery, diluting the benefits of the procedure and elevating the risk for metabolic complications such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The new USC research implicates PFAS, a class of synthetic compounds that exert endocrine-disrupting effects, as potential contributors to these adverse outcomes.\nPFAS chemicals are notorious for their chemical stability and bioaccumulation tendencies, earning them the moniker “forever chemicals.” Over decades, human exposure primarily occurs via contaminated drinking water, food packaging, and consumer goods treated with these substances. Prior studies have linked PFAS exposure to detrimental effects on renal function, hepatic health, and carcinogenesis. However, their influence on metabolic regulation and weight dynamics, especially in the context of bariatric surgery recovery, remained largely unexplored until now.\n.adsslot_lkwHCd0rUG{width:728px !important;height:90px !important;}\n@media(max-width:1199px){ .adsslot_lkwHCd0rUG{width:468px !important;height:60px !important;}\n}\n@media(max-width:767px){ .adsslot_lkwHCd0rUG{width:320px !important;height:50px !important;}\n}\nADVERTISEMENT\nLed by Dr. Brittney Baumert, a postdoctoral fellow in population and public health sciences at the Keck School of Medicine of USC, the research team embarked on a longitudinal investigation tracking 186 adolescents enrolled in the Teen-Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (Teen-LABS) study. This cohort was rigorously monitored both preoperatively and for five years post-surgery, with periodic assessments of body mass index (BMI), weight, and waist circumference. Crucially, blood samples were analyzed to quantify PFAS concentrations, enabling researchers to stratify participants by exposure levels and evaluate differential postoperative outcomes.\nThe study unearthed a robust association between elevated PFAS blood concentrations—specifically within the sulfonic acid subclass comprising perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), and perfluoroheptanesulfonic acid (PFHpS)—and greater weight regain post-surgery. Adolescents in the highest exposure tertile not only regained significantly more absolute weight but also exhibited pronounced increases in waist circumference, a marker closely linked to metabolic risk. To illustrate, teens with initially comparable body weights but elevated PFOS levels regained on average nearly 11 pounds more by year five compared to their low-exposure counterparts.\nThese findings carry profound implications for clinical practice and public health policy. They highlight the need for preoperative screening for PFAS levels as part of personalized risk assessment for bariatric surgery candidates. Furthermore, the research underscores the urgency of regulatory interventions to limit PFAS contamination in public water systems, food processing, and packaging industries to mitigate exposure. Given the modifiable nature of PFAS exposure, environmental and behavioral strategies could prove integral to optimizing surgical outcomes and long-term weight management.\nThe biological mechanisms by which PFAS disrupt metabolic and endocrine homeostasis remain an active area of inquiry but are believed to involve modulation of nuclear receptors, interference with lipid metabolism, and inflammatory pathways. Such disruptions can alter energy balance and adipose tissue function, potentially explaining the observed postoperative weight regain. The USC study augments this emerging narrative by providing longitudinal human data linking chemical exposure directly to clinical outcomes in a vulnerable adolescent population.\nIn light of these revelations, Dr. Baumert and her team are expanding the scope of their research to investigate whether PFAS exposure influences responsiveness to other emerging weight loss interventions, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist medications like Ozempic. The potential for PFAS to attenuate pharmacological efficacy would present additional challenges in managing obesity, necessitating integrated approaches that consider environmental toxicology alongside metabolic therapeutics.\nMoreover, ongoing investigations seek to clarify how PFAS exposures correlate with the development of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and insulin resistance, further unraveling the spectrum of metabolic perturbations triggered by these chemicals. The longitudinal Teen-LABS data repository offers a valuable framework for parsing these complex interrelations over extended follow-up periods, providing critical insights into how environmental exposures modulate chronic disease trajectories.\nAs the epidemic of obesity continues to escalate globally, with adolescent populations particularly affected, the discovery of environmental determinants like PFAS adds a new dimension to understanding why some patients fail to sustain surgical weight loss. This knowledge reinforces the need for multidisciplinary research marrying environmental health sciences, endocrinology, and surgery to design more effective, individualized treatments. It also galvanizes public health advocates and policymakers to intensify efforts in regulating and reducing PFAS exposure to safeguard metabolic health across the lifespan.\nUltimately, the USC study serves as a clarion call—environmental pollutants do not merely lurk in the periphery of metabolic disease; they actively shape clinical outcomes in profound and measurable ways. Addressing PFAS contamination and exposure represents both a challenge and an opportunity to enhance the durability of life-altering weight loss interventions and improve health trajectories for vulnerable adolescents confronting obesity.\nSubject of Research : People\nArticle Title : PFAS Exposure and Postoperative Weight Regain in Adolescents After Bariatric Surgery: Findings from the Teen-LABS Study\nNews Publication Date : 14-Aug-2025\nWeb References :\nObesity Journal Article\nTags: adolescent obesity treatment challengesbariatric surgery weight regainchemical exposure and weight managementendocrine disruptors and obesityenvironmental pollutants impact on healthlong-term effects of bariatric surgerymetabolic health in youthobesity management strategiesPFAS exposure in adolescentspostoperative complications in teenssynthetic compounds and health risksUSC obesity study findings",
