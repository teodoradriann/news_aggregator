    "text": "FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\nDec 28, 2023\nMedia Contact: Melissa Garriga | [email protected] | 228-990-4168\nEast Bay CODEPINK and Local Peace Organizations Stage Dramatic Shutdown of Travis Air Force Base in Protest Against Military Support to Israel Fairfield, CA — In a demonstration of dissent, East Bay CODEPINK, in collaboration with other local peace organizations, executed a shutdown of Travis Air Force Base in Fairfield, CA, on Tuesday, December 28th. The coalition rallied to draw attention to the base's alleged active involvement in shipping military supplies directly to Israel, thereby contributing to the ongoing genocide in Gaza.\nThe protest, which unfolded at the North Gate road entrance, saw participants blockading the entrance as they voiced their concerns about the base's complicity in supporting actions leading to a devastating impact on Palestinian lives. Fairfield Police, in conjunction with military police, initially issued warnings for the protesters to disperse, and it wasn't until approximately half an hour later that arrests were made for unlawful assembly.\nAt least a dozen peace activists were taken into custody. They were transported to Solano County Jail in Fairfield and charged with unlawful assembly.\n\"The majority of casualties are children. No matter what happened on Oct. 7, this is wrong,\" asserted, CODEPINK member Toby Blome. She continued, \"Many consider the area an open-air prison, worse than the ghettos in Warsaw during World War II.\"\nCynthia Papermaster, another CODEPINK member, told the media covering the protest that she lays awake at night thinking about this.\n“I am not the only one. Many of us can't sleep thinking about what is going on over there,\" she said. \"It is horrible. They are going to wipe out all the Palestinians.\"\nTravis Air Force Base, recognized as the largest transport Air Force base in the U.S., has become a focal point of concern due to its alleged role in aiding and abetting Israel's relentless bombing of Gaza. The base is accused of being complicit in the loss of over 20,000 Palestinian lives, including more than 8,000 children. Gaza's infrastructure has been devastated, with 1/2 to 1/3 of homes destroyed, leaving civilians, hospitals, ambulances, hospital workers, and journalists as repeated targets.\nThis act of civil disobedience underscores the growing discontent within the community regarding the base's activities and its contribution to the ongoing crisis in the Middle East. The coalition calls for a reevaluation of the base's operations and urges a reexamination of the military support provided to Israel. East Bay CODEPINK and its partners remain steadfast in their commitment to advocating for peace and justice on a global scale.\nFor media inquiries, please contact: Melissa at [email protected]\n###",

Jones and Miocic [are likely to fight in November](https://www.bjpenn.com/mma-news/jon-jones/dana-white-confident-jon-jones-will-fight-tom-aspinall-if-he-retains-heavyweight-title-against-stipe-miocic-i-personally-think-jon-challenges-himself/) at UFC 309 in Madison Square Garden in a fight that has been years in the making. Yet, the bout has not officially been booked by the promotion and according to Aspinall, that is because he has heard that Miocic is dealing with an injury. https://twitter.com/Home_of_Fight/status/1826700141627408505 “These are just rumors, there is a lot of talk, and there is nothing announced yet. I’m hearing rumors that Stipe is potentially injured. These are things I’m hearing from the inner circle, Stipe I believe his birthday was yesterday actually, he’s 42 years old the guy is going to be injury-prone. Jon Jones, million miles on the clock, he’s going to be injury prone. Me, I’m ready to go, I’m not even in my prime yet and I’m hungry for it, and I’m not sure these two guys are but I am. I will fight either of them for the undisputed title on any notice, I’m ready,” Tom Aspinall [said](https://x.com/Home_of_Fight/status/1826700141627408505). Tom Aspinall [ has been campaigning](https://www.bjpenn.com/mma-news/jon-jones/tom-aspinall-fires-back-at-dana-white-and-jon-jones-declares-himself-the-best-heavyweight-in-the-world/) for the Jon Jones fight and if Stipe Miocic is indeed hurt as he says, it would allow him to finally get the fight against ‘Bones’ for the undisputed title. Aspinall vs. Jones [is one of the biggest fights](https://www.bjpenn.com/mma-news/jon-jones/jon-jones-sends-subtle-jab-to-tom-aspinall-im-focusing-on-goat-things/) to make in the sport and something many fans would like to see. However, Miocic or his team have yet to confirm the report or make any announcement that he is injured. But where there is smoke there is fire, and since the bout has yet to be made official, it seems there might be something to this. Tom Aspinall is 15-3 as a pro and coming off a first-round knockout win over Curtis Blaydes back at UFC 304 to defend his interim heavyweight title for the first time. Before that, he knocked out Sergei Pavlovich in the first round to win the interim title.

    "text": "Sanitat\nUn test basat en la IA permet diagnosticar l’autisme amb el 85% de precisió\nLa pediatra Laura Gisbert con Xavi, de 18 años, con autismo y paciente de Vall dHebron. /\nEl trastorn de l’espectre autista (TEA) es diagnostica mitjançant una sèrie de tests i entrevistes sobre com reacciona i es comporta el nen o la nena en determinades circumstàncies o com afronta o realitza tasques quotidianes. La Universitat Politècnica de València, mitjançant l’Institut Human-Tech i en col·laboració amb Red Cenit, ha presentat un nou sistema que li fa una gir de 180 graus al sistema de detecció de l’autisme en nens petits. Es diu T-EYE, està basat en la realitat virtual i compta amb l’ajuda de la intel·ligència artificial (IA).\nDe moment ja es troba a l’abast dels centres privats, tot i que l’objectiu és que sigui assumit pel sistema públic sanitari ja que és «tota una revolució» i aconsegueix una precisió de més del 85%, cosa que supera així els mètodes tradicionals de detecció de l’autisme durant els primers anys de la infància (entre 3 i 7 anys).\nNotícies relacionades«Millora significativa»\nEn el seu estudi, l’equip de l’Institut Human-Tech va analitzar els moviments dels nens durant l’execució de múltiples tasques en realitat virtual per determinar quina tècnica d’intel·ligència artificial era més apropiada per identificar el TEA. «L’ús de la realitat virtual permet utilitzar entorns reconeixibles que generen respostes realistes i autèntiques, imitant la manera amb què els nens interactuen en el seu dia a dia. Això suposa una millora significativa respecte a les proves de laboratori, en les quals les respostes solen ser artificials. Amb la realitat virtual, podem estudiar reaccions més genuïnes i comprendre millor la simptomatologia de l’autisme», diu Mariano Alcanyís, director de l’Institut Human-Tech de la UPV. El sistema virtual consisteix en la projecció d’un entorn simulat a què s’integra la imatge del mateix nen mentre exerceix múltiples tasques, captades per una càmera que analitza els seus moviments.",
