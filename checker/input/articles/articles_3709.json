    "text": "Survival of the fishiest: Roaring Fork Conservancy releases trout into Roaring Fork River Six “Halloween baby” trout were released into the Roaring Fork River on Wednesday. The trout, born on Halloween in 2023, were raised at the Roaring Fork Conservancy for almost a year before they were released into the Roaring Fork River in Basalt. It was survival of the fittest for these six fish, as they were the only ones to survive out of the 200 other eggs they came from. Roaring Fork Conservancy Executive Director Rick Lofaro said that this is normal. Two hundred eggs will usually yield six to 10 fish. “That gives you an idea of nature,” he said. “Trout, and salmon especially, are laying thousands of eggs with a very small percentage of surviving.” Raising the trout from eggs to fingerling size, which is about three to four inches long, is made possible through a partnership program with Colorado Trout Unlimited, known as Trout in the Classroom. For the Trout in the Classroom program, trout are raised by educators and students. The program is sitting at a 30% survival rate for trout right now. For wildlife professionals, the success rate increases to 80%. These professionals have more access to hatchery systems that aid in the higher survival rate of the trout, like a flow-through system. The classrooms typically have a closed-system hatchery. “It’s a little more difficult to raise these finicky, cold-water-loving fishies,” Colorado Trout Unlimited Youth Education Coordinator Natalie Flowers said. Louisville Middle School near Boulder raised 175 out of the 200 trout eggs, which Flowers called a “phenomenal success rate.” When Colorado Trout Unlimited and Roaring Fork Conservancy staff first got out to the Roaring Fork River at around 11:30 a.m., the water measured 50 degrees. Staff were looking for a five-degree difference between the river and what the water the trout were formally living in measured at. The fish were living at around 52 degrees, and although this is within the five-degree difference, staff still “tempered” the fish, or took some of the water from the river and put it in the tub the fish were being kept in. Another reason to temper the fish is for differing pH balances. The difference in pH comes from several factors, including minerals found in the river. If the fish are placed into a new ecosystem, like the Roaring Fork River, and are shocked, whether from temperature or pH balance, it could lessen their chance of survival. The reason humans do not receive this severe of a shock when doing polar plunges or swimming in alpine lakes or enjoying a sauna is because humans are warm-blooded, or endothermic. Possessing this trait allows a human or other wam-blooded animals to regulate temperature and warm or cool them. Cold-blooded, or ectothermic, animals, like fish, do not have this same trait. These animals are affected by their surroundings, so they cannot regulate body temperature. Trout can survive at a range of temperatures, but they are most comfortable at around 52 degrees. Anywhere between 48 to 62 degrees is a range that trout can survive in. Temperatures over 65 degrees is not suitable for trout, but rainbow trout can stand a little bit of a higher temperature. “In many aspects, trout are as fragile as a newborn baby,” Lofaro said. “But in other aspects, they’re tough as a bull.” Staff also caught aquatic macro-invertebrates, or water insects, with nets in the river and by flipping over river rocks. After the trout have spent almost the first year of their lives eating hatchery food, or pellets from Colorado Parks and Wildlife, staff wanted to know what the trout would be taking a liking to once released. These water insects hide under rocks because trout and other predators, like birds, like to eat them. “I suggest also trying them yourself,” Lofaro said. “They’re not quite as good as sushi, but they’re pretty good.” The most common aquatic macro-invertebrates found in Roaring Fork Valley rivers are mayflies, stone flies, and caddisflies. “We have great water quality here in the Roaring Fork Valley, so we always will see a nice, high variety of insects and high diversity, as well as high numbers,” Lofaro said.

    "text": "A Casper man is facing sexual assault charges for allegedly smoking meth and then raping a women in his basement. Marcus Dean Grayson, born in 1984, made his preliminary appearance at the Natrona County Circuit Court on Tuesday and is charged with sexual assault in the first degree and sexual assault in the second degree. Following the hearing, Grayson's case was bound over to district court. The first degree penalty is punishable by five years to fifty years in prison. The victim alleges that she was giving Grayson a ride to his home and that he asked her to come inside. Grayson’s wife was not home at the time, according to an affidavit. On the basement’s couch Grayson smoked meth out of a pipe; the alleged victim denied using meth at that time, according to an affidavit. People are also reading… The alleged victim told police that Grayson “forced himself” onto her and that she broke two nails while punching Grayson. The victim “had been wearing light colored, high-waisted jeans with one button and a long zipper,” and a “soft, brown and fuzzy hoodie that was short,” the affidavit states. The affidavit stated that officers observed the victim “did have several broken nails on both of her hands.” After the encounter the victim messaged Grayson saying that he “should listen when I said no the million times I said no,” the affidavit said. A search of the victim’s phone revealed that Grayson apologized profusely after the event through text messages. “I’m freaking out right now like I did something wrong — like terribly wrong,” Grayson messaged, according to the affidavit. “ I just flushed everything I had and I'm getting — out of here to do this. Nobody should have come home to it.” The victim declined to have a sexual assault forensic exam done. Search warrant Police conducted a search warrant on Grayson’s home a week later and conducted an interview with Grayson’s wife — who told police that Grayson told her about the incident after two unknown men showed up at the home. The wife told police that the victim wanted “Grayson to give her meth for the ride and Grayson did not have any. [The victim] got angry and left.” She additionally told officers that Grayson told her that he and the victim were “never intimate and she was trying to get money out of him by accusing him of sexual assault.” Police recovered a marijuana vape pen and a “one hitter” and swabbed the couch in the basement. Interview with Grayson Grayson told police in an interview that the encounter was consensual and that he and the victim flirted while smoking meth together. He additionally told police that the victim “had brought meth with her which was packaged in a small twisted plastic bag.” Grayson told police that following the encounter they smoked more meth together and kissed before she left. Grayson additionally told police that two men showed up at his door and he received text messages asking for money. One message from the victim said something to the effect of “send money to CashApp or this goes public,” and another message from an unknown number describing the incident as messed up and adding that “I need some bread.” A police search through Grayson’s phone found that all messages and calls had been deleted — except for the messages with the victim and his wife. Police also found that all camera footage of Grayson’s home on the day of the footage had been deleted — except for the video of the two guys that showed up at his home. A detective noted that messages on Grayson’s phone to the victim “appeared to be ‘edited.’” David Velazquez is a reporter at the Casper Star-Tribune and can be reached at 307-301-0506, or at [david.velazquez@trib.com](mailto:david.velazquez@trib.com)",

    "title": "Friends And Family Mourn The Loss Of Canadians Killed By Hamas In Israel - WorldNewsEra",
    "text": "[Canada](../) Friends and family mourn the loss of Canadians killed by Hamas in Israel Friends, family and government officials have confirmed that at least seven Canadians were killed when Hamas militants conducted a series of attacks in Israel on Oct. 7. Global Affairs Canada has said an eighth person who was not a citizen but had deep ties to Canada also died in the ensuing conflict. Another Canadian, who has not been identified, died in Lebanon during the hostilities. The Hamas attacks killed an estimated 1,200 people and militants took another 240 hostage, 105 of whom were released during a temporary pause in the violence at the end of last month. As Israel continues its retaliation on Hamas in the Gaza Strip, authorities there say more than 20,000 Palestinians have now been killed. Here’s what we know about the Hamas victims with ties to Canada: Judih Weinstein Haggai Judih Weinstein Haggai, 70, was out on an early-morning walk when Hamas started its attack, her family says. She told members of her Nir Oz kibbutz that a militant on a motorcycle shot her husband and she was less severely wounded. The community was unable to dispatch an ambulance before militants arrived there. Last week, the kibbutz confirmed Gadi Haggai, Judih’s husband, died on Oct. 7, and on Thursday they confirmed Weinstein Haggai also died that day, and her body is being held in Gaza. Weinstein Haggai was born in New York state but arrived in Toronto at the age of three, and moved to Israel 20 years later to live with her husband. She held Canadian, Israeli and American citizenships. Weinstein Haggai was an artist and a volunteer who the kibbutz said “pursued many initiatives to advance peace in the region.” Her brother Larry Weinstein said the family is distressed by Israel’s offensive in Gaza and the rise of hateful speech in Canada toward both Jews and Muslims. “We’re inspired by my sister, who believed in peace and believed in harmony,” he said. “There can’t be any kind of resolution when people are at each other’s throats.” Vivian Silver Vivian Silver, 74, was in her home on Kibbutz Be’eri near the Gaza border and talking on the phone with her son Yonatan Zeigen when they learned of the incursion by Hamas into Israel. “We couldn’t grasp the incapability of the Israeli army to defend the civilians … we started to say goodbye because we realized this is probably our last words to each other,” Zeigen later told a news conference organized by the Jerusalem Press Club. He said they shifted their conversations to text messages so his mother could stay silent, and someone broke into her home. They said they loved one another before the messages stopped coming. Zeigen said he had received information that she was taken hostage, and her phone had been geolocated in Gaza. On Monday, his brother Chen Zeigen confirmed their mother’s death. He said Israeli authorities told him the remains found earlier in the kibbutz had been identified as Silver. He said his mother was born in Winnipeg and moved to Israel in 1974. She dedicated her life to peacebuilding and fostering understanding between Israelis and Palestinians, he added. She also volunteered to help children in Gaza access medical care in Israel. Tiferet Lapidot Tiferet Lapidot, 22, was a few days shy of her 23rd birthday and attending a music festival when the Hamas attack began. Her cousin Oran Zlotnik remembered Lapidot as a charismatic and compassionate person who had travelled the world, taught in Africa and spent time in Australia before she returned to Israel in the fall. Her uncle Harel Lapidot said she called her mother the morning of the attack to say she was hiding in a bush and to ask whether she should flee. Her cellphone was later tracked to the Gaza Strip, leading family to believe she was being held hostage. They then mounted a campaign to secure her freedom. Zlotnik said that when the cellphone of one of Lapidot’s friends, confirmed deceased, was also traced to Gaza, the family realized it was possible she wasn’t a hostage. Harel Lapidot said his niece’s body was later identified and the family held a funeral. “We know for a fact they were hunted,” he said. “They ran away and they were hunted and killed.” Tiferet Lapidot was an Israeli citizen but her family was from Canada, including her father, Ohad, who was born in Saskatchewan. Harel Lapidot thanked the Jewish community in Canada and MPs who had reached out to help and offer support. The family had a meeting with Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly while she was in Israel. Netta Epstein Israeli-Canadian Netta Epstein, 21, died when his home, Kibbutz Kfar Aza, came under attack. His mother, Ayelet Shachar-Epstein, said he loved life. She learned the circumstances of his death from text messages he sent her in the moments before he was killed, and from his fiancée, Irene Shavit, who survived. Netta Epstein was inside a safe room with Shavit, and he jumped on a grenade thrown in by the attackers. Shachar-Epstein, who also lost her mother-in-law and two brothers-in-law in the attacks, described it as a terrorist invasion. She said her son, who had worked with special needs youth, had returned home two months earlier after completing military service. He was born in Montreal and was a Canadian citizen. Shachar-Epstein said many members of the family still live in that city. Shir Georgy Israeli Canadian Shir Georgy, 22, was killed by Hamas militants who ambushed the music festival near Kibbutz Re’im. Georgy’s aunt Michal Bouganim confirmed the death. “We are currently a mess, heartbroken,” Bouganim said in a Facebook message. Bouganim shared a 22-second clip on her social media in which a terrified Georgy was seen sitting on a floor, with her back against a wall and surrounded by other festival attendees — some of them injured. Georgy’s funeral was held in Israel. Adi Vital-Kaploun Adi Vital-Kaploun, 33, was killed by Hamas militants in her kibbutz near the Israeli border with the Gaza Strip, said the Jewish Federation of Ottawa. The group’s CEO made a statement on behalf of Vital-Kaploun’s family, saying the dual citizen has a large extended family in the Ottawa area. The family said she died a hero, after convincing her killers to spare her two young children and warning her father and husband to stay hidden during the attack. “Adi was a beautiful woman that brought love and lightness to the people around her, but also she was very focused and determined to make a beautiful life for her family,” her cousin-in-law Aaron Smith said in an interview. The family said she was an amazing mother and wife, always bringing love and laughter to their household. She was also a talented dancer, saxophonist and basketball player. After completing her master’s degree in engineering, Vital-Kaploun excelled in her cybersecurity career, they said. “We are mourning trying to process this unconscionable act of terrorism in her kibbutz and across the country,” said the family, adding that they wish her memory to be “a blessing.” Ben Mizrachi Canadian Ben Mizrachi was one of at least 260 people gunned down by Hamas militants at the music festival in southern Israel. Mizrachi, 22, from Vancouver, was described as “larger than life with a big personality” in a statement by his former high school in B.C. Ezra Shanken, CEO of the Jewish Federation of Greater Vancouver, said Mizrachi was about to start university in Israel after serving with the country’s national defence force. Hilit Nurick, a home economics teacher at King David High School in Vancouver, remembered Mizrachi as a “kind, wonderful, and community-minded” young man who had a positive influence on everyone around him. Nurick said she and Mizrachi once put a large event together for more than 100 people at school. “He was in charge of making Moroccan-style spicy fish stew. He brought his mother’s recipe and shared it with everyone and taught us how to make it,” said Nurick. “He was incredible, just an incredible human being.” Alexandre Look Alexandre Look, who had recently celebrated his 33rd birthday, was among those killed while attending the musical festival. Look, who lived in Montreal with his family before moving to Mexico, died a hero, his dad said in a Facebook post. “Like a true warrior he left as a hero wanting to protect the people he was with,” Alain Haim Look said. Friend Lior Horovitz described him as a “once-in-a-lifetime person” who became like family during their five-year friendship. In a phone interview from a town outside Tel Aviv, she said she and her boyfriend met Alexandre Look in Mexico. They became fast friends and would organize their vacations to meet up, either in Mexico or Israel. He was a proud Jewish Canadian and a generous person who would do anything for his friends, she said. “He’s a person who loves people,” she said. “He’s the guy that’s always going to help others, especially if they are Jewish.” [World News](/)|| [Latest News](/news)|| [U.S. News](../../us-news) [Source link](//www.ctvnews.ca/canada/friends-and-family-mourn-the-loss-of-canadians-killed-by-hamas-in-israel-1.6703766)",

    "text": "Samsung has been working on [One UI 7](samsung_one_ui_7_based_on_android_15_is_only_arriving_next_year-news-64787.php) based on Android 15 for a long while, and the release of the first beta has seen [many delays](samsung_users_facing_further_one_ui_7_delays-news-65172.php), in a rumored effort by the company to [improve its skin significantly](one_ui_7_design_changes_showcased_online-news-65094.php). Major improvements do however mean major changes, and those never come without many nasty bugs. According to the prolific tipster Ice Universe, that's exactly what you should expect from the first One UI 7 beta, whenever it does finally arrive. One UI 7 Beta may not be launched smoothly, and there are too many bugs. Even in the latest version of XKB, there are still bugs in animation, and they are new bugs. — ICE UNIVERSE (@UniverseIce) There are too many things that Samsung has fallen behind in recent years. It is very difficult for them to make up…[November 15, 2024] Of course, it being a beta, you would naturally expect some issues to occur - otherwise it would go straight to a stable release. But Ice Universe claims that this will be a pretty rough beta, with many animation-related bugs, including new ones that have been introduced in the latest [internal test builds](first_one_ui_7_beta_build_spotted_on_samsungs_test_servers-news-65288.php). That also makes sense since animations are a big focus for what's changing in One UI 7 (thankfully, we might add). While Ice Universe mentions Samsung has \"fallen behind\" in a lot of ways, software-wise, in recent years, he is optimistic about the Korean company's ability to fix all of the problems in the near future. And it all starts with the One UI 7 release, which may arrive, in its first public beta form, [as early as next week](samsung_to_bring_one_ui_7_beta_next_week-news-65266.php).",

Waiting to find someone who wouldn’t use him for his strength, he wanted someone who would appreciate every little kind thing he did. He wished for someone that would voice their opinions, and be respectful and gentle. All the ones that tried to woo him failed, they flirted and gave the simplest gift with little to no meaning. They wore revealing garments in an attempt to make him aroused. But he wasn’t. He was disgusted. He saw what they wanted from him. They wanted power, they wanted fame. They were greedy little monsters. Likewise, they would touch him on his chest, giggle with him, hold his hand and for what? He may have lived with the richest of the richest kings, but no amount of money would suffice for them, they would always want more and more and more. Until they died, and he didn’t. He watched their wrinkly faces relax as they took their last breaths. Some even added his name to their will, they transferred jewellery and articles of clothing. Kindly, he kept them all in a nook, being careful not to shatter or damage any of the gifts. Some of the eager lovers even offered him their children at their time of death, in hopes that one day, his blood could run through their descendants. It was sad. Seeing hopefuls come and go, only wanting him for what he was and not for who he was. It hurt. But he believed in love. He believed that he could and would find someone. He trusted that this world would let him find someone. The world could not be that cruel to him, he has been kind and grateful towards all who were found in his presence. He’d seen people love each other, it was indeed possible. He had seen people caring for each other as if their love was as immortal as he was. He witnessed old lovers dying on a porch, young lovers having their first kiss on a starry night, and young adults getting married while having the brightest of smiles on their faces. But why couldn’t someone love him? He prayed to the gods that someone would love him. That was all he wanted. Love. What a word it was. It brought hurt and tears as much as it brought smiles and laughter. Love could be a poisonous thing, deadly. It could be a lovely thing. It could be stronger than anything in the world, having enough strength to break down the tallest and biggest of walls, it could also be fragile and meek, barely holding on to its support. Love was a funny feeling. It messed with you, laughed and giggled as you sobbed because of it. It was a shadow, following you, making you feel things you didn’t know you could feel. Love pained and wounded people. Love made people ecstatic. He wanted it all, the full package. He wanted to feel love. Oh, dearest world, let me find someone, he begged every night. His shining hazel eyes glistened with tears when he looked up at the fortunate stars. I would rather end my everlasting life than be without a lover. That was all he wanted. Love.",
