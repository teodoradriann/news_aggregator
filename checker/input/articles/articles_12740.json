    "text": "Vaccine Policy in Limbo as US Health Meeting Delayed\nThe postponement of a February meeting of U.S. vaccine advisers raises uncertainty about the Trump administration's vaccine policy following Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s recent appointment as Secretary of Health and Human Services. The delay was intended to allow public comments. Kennedy faces scrutiny over his stance on vaccines.\nThe upcoming meeting of U.S. vaccine advisers, initially scheduled for late February, has been postponed, confirmed a federal official on Thursday. This new development adds uncertainty to the Trump administration's vaccine policy following Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s recent appointment to a top health position.\nThe Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) typically convenes multiple times a year to assess scientific data and make vaccine-related recommendations. The latest postponement of the meeting, which was set to take several important votes, is to allow for public commentary, said Andrew Nixon, director of communications at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\nThe postponement comes shortly after Kennedy assumed the role of Secretary of Health and Human Services, amid controversy over his views on vaccines. Despite the surprise delay, Kennedy has pledged not to alter the ACIP's operations, assuring support from critics like Senator Bill Cassidy. While the delay raises concerns, health experts urge not to jump to conclusions regarding the new leadership's intentions.\n(With inputs from agencies.)",

Member states agreed to spend two percent of their national GDP on the military by 2024.\n\"As threats to peace and security become increasingly complex, Canada and our government stand ready to step up,\" Trudeau\nsaid.\nAccording to the announcement, Canada plans to reach NATO's budget goal by 2032. The government will also conduct a regular review of national defense police, including an additional update in 2028.\nEarlier this year, Canada released a military spending plan titled \"Our North, Strong and Free,\" outlining defense investments of $73 billion Canadian dollars ($53 billion). The funds focus on Arctic security and underwater surveillance capabilities, among other defense priorities.\nOttawa's defense spending projections arrived in tandem with Canada's pledge of\n $367 million in continued military assistance to Ukraine.

    "text": "La estabilidad y el buen tiempo en España tienen los días contados. Tras una semana marcada por un ascenso térmico generalizado, que tocará techo este viernes, las precipitaciones volverán a ganar protagonismo en varias zonas de la Península. Así lo ha anunciado la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (AEMET), que a través de una publicación de X (antes Twitter) ha adelantado cuál es la previsión meteorológica de cara a los próximos días. Así pues, el sol deja paso a las nubes en un fin de semana en el que los valores altos en los termómetros se mantendrán todavía altos. Para dar respuesta a esta pregunta, la Aemet ha adelantado cuáles son los resultados de los modelos de predicción en cuanto a lluvias y temperaturas. Por un lado, se esperan \\\"chubascos generalizados, el sábado en el noroeste peninsular y el domingo en el noreste\\\". Así pues, las nubes cargadas de agua cruzarán el país de lado a lado a lo largo del fin de semana. En lo que a temperaturas se refiere, desde la organización meteorológica informan de que seguirán siendo \\\"más propias de mes de junio\\\", por lo que el calor seguirá siendo el gran predominante por unos días más. Ya de cara a la semana siguiente, la Aemet avanza que \\\"seguirán las precipitaciones en el norte peninsular\\\". No obstante, añaden, se dará una \\\"bajada notable de temperaturas\\\", así que muy probablemente tocará volver cubrirse con un jersey y dejar las camisetas de manga corta para más adelante. Cabe recordar que a lo largo de estas semanas el mercurio en los termómetros de varias comunidades de España ha rebasado la marca de los 30 grados, mientras que en puntos del sur como Huelva se rozaron los 35 grados durante la jornada del miércoles.",

    "text": "New Delhi, Dec 28 : In view of rising cases of Covid, including of new variant JN.1, across the country, Delhi Health Minister Saurabh Bharadwaj on Thursday visited the Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital to assess its preparedness. The hospital has reserved 20 beds for Covid patients, but there hasn't been a confirmed case there yet. \"Separate help desks have been set up for Covid patients, along with a dedicated testing centre in the hospital. Immediate treatment will be given upon confirmation of Covid. Directives have been issued to maintain readiness in all Delhi government hospitals,\" said an official. The official said that the city government has mobilised all arrangements in Delhi government hospitals to strengthen everything, ensuring readiness to handle any situation. Talking to reporters, Bharadwaj said that a separate ward has been set up for Covid patients, with approximately 20 beds and all necessary facilities. \"Currently, the entire ward is empty as there hasn't been any confirmed case of a Covid patient in the hospital yet. However, continuous screening of patients with Covid-related symptoms is ongoing. As soon as any Covid-related patient is confirmed, they will be immediately admitted and treatment will commence. Almost all preparations in the hospital have been completed, and further preparations will be made as per the evolving situation,\" he said. Bharadwaj said that as soon as any patient with symptoms like Covid or flu is confirmed, an RT-PCR test will immediately be conducted and for this, a separate testing centre has been arranged in the hospital. On patients affected by the new variant, he said that there has been confirmation of only one patient with the JN.1 so far. He mentioned that this patient was admitted to a nearby hospital after confirmation. \"The patient has now recovered and returned home. Although this variant is considered less dangerous than the previous ones, it's crucial not to be negligent,\" he said. Bharadwaj advised caution not only by the hospital administration but also to Delhi residents, urging them to stay vigilant to prevent any risk of contracting the disease. He said that directives have been issued to all hospitals under the Delhi government to maintain all preparations for dealing with Covid-19. \"Although there isn't any alarming situation in Delhi at the moment, as a precautionary measure, instructions have been given to all hospitals to ensure readiness. This is to handle any emergencies more effectively in the future. We hope that there won't be any such issues, but it's essential for us to remain vigilant and cautious. In this context, directives have been given to all hospitals to maintain their preparedness,\" the minister said. --IANS ssh/vd",
