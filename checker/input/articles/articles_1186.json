    "title": "Meet Shabnam: A Muslim Woman Embarks On Ayodhya Paidal Yatra",
    "text": "Meet Shabnam, a young Muslim woman from the vibrant streets of Mumbai, defying stereotypes and embarking on a spiritual journey to witness the grandeur of the Ram temple in Ayodhya. This is not merely a story of footsteps covering 1,425 kilometers but a reality that challenges preconceptions, exemplifying the universal essence of devotion. Shaikh has embarked on her journey along with her two friends, Vineet Panday and Raman Raj Sharma. She believes that to worship Ram, one does not need to be confined by any one particular religion or region, and through this journey, she also aims to transcend religious borders and also break the stereotype that only boys can take such an arduous journey. Devotion Knows No Labels A young Muslim woman from Mumbai, Shabnam Shaikh, has embarked on a 1,425-kilometer journey from Mumbai to [Ayodhya](https://www.shethepeople.tv/news/up-cm-flags-off-51-buses-operated-exclusively-by-women-1567411) on foot as a form of Hindu pilgrimage to pay homage to Lord Ram and aims to break many stereotypes with her walking journey, accompanied by two friends, Raman Raj Sharma and Vineet Panday. Her journey isn't just about covering the physical distance. It is also a testament to the unifying power of faith, challenging the notion that devotion is confined by religion or region. Shabnam's unwavering dedication to Lord Ram, despite her Muslim background, is something hailed by people from all walks of life. The trio of devotees have embarked on their journey in devotion to Lord Ram for 9 days and have [reached](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/from-mumbai-streets-to-ayodhya-ram-temple-shabnam-unique-pilgrimage-4757199#pfrom=home-ndtv_topstories) Sindhava in Madhya Pradesh, covering 25–30 kilometres every day along with the message \"Green India, Clean India\" They have been garnering widespread love and respect, boosting their social media reach and making them a sensation overnight. Despite the fatigue and challenges of the long journey by foot, the three devotees stated that their devotion to Lord [Ram](https://www.shethepeople.tv/opinion/valmiki-jayanti-significance-faith-1675134) keeps them moving as they share everyday updates of their journey on Instagram, through which people find the trio garnering them with flowers, shawls, and garlands and posting stories with the pilgrims. Shabnam has also witnessed many heartwarming moments of solidarity as people, including [Muslims](https://www.shethepeople.tv/top-stories/opinion/students-unity-karnataka-hijab-row/) greeted her with a resounding \"Jai Shri Ram.\" This outpouring of support reaffirmed her belief in the universality of faith and the power of shared human connection. Overcoming Challenges However, her journey hasn't been without challenges beyond the scorching sun and long distances, but the police have been instrumental in ensuring not just her safety but also arranging food and accommodation for the young woman. As they passed through some sensitive areas in Maharashtra, police ensured their safety and helped them out through some troubling situations. While Shabnam is receiving widespread support from all walks of life, signifying solidarity as people have been offering her food, shelter, and encouragement, she is also receiving many hateful comments online, but Shabnam's faith remains unwavering as she ignores the hateful comments and is overwhelmed by the positive response, strengthening her faith. Shabnam firmly believes that Lord Ram's worship is not confined by one [religion](https://www.shethepeople.tv/top-stories/opinion/inter-faith-relationship-swara-bhaskar/) or any region, and it transcends borders, encompassing the whole world in its embrace, as she says, \"Lord Ram belongs to everyone, irrespective of their caste or religion,\" and claims it to be her motivation behind the trip. She also aims to challenge the stereotypical notions to be misconceptions that not just boys but everyone can take such arduous long trips, as she walks the arduous path every day, embracing her hijab, carrying the [saffron](https://www.shethepeople.tv/news/complaint-against-rana-ayyub-hijab-row/) flag and chanting 'Jai Shri Ram.' Debunking the rumours that Shabnam's trip is to be a planned gathering in Ayodhya for the inauguration of Ram Mandir on January 22, she denied the claims, stating that the journey is a personal quest for her spiritual fulfilment to transcend religious boundaries and is purely out of her natural devotion. Shabnam Sheikh is an emerging YouTube vlogger and Instagram content creator from Mumbai who has garnered 222k followers on Instagram and goes by the handle @shernishaikh or @shabnamsherni on the social media apps. Shabnam's story is a beacon of hope and inspiration. It reminds us that faith transcends religion and that love and understanding can bridge any divide. Her journey is a testament to the human spirit's ability to overcome obstacles and achieve the seemingly impossible, and it portrays the cultural harmony of our country. In the footsteps of Shabnam, we find a path that leads not just to Ayodhya but towards a world where the boundaries of faith dissolve, and humanity stands united in reverence.",

    "title": "One Piece: Oda Reveals Plans To Draw A Spinoff Manga About A Legendary Character",
    "text": "This article contains spoilers from One Piece's Egghead arc.\nSummary\n- One Piece's massive success ensures future spin-offs are likely due to its legendary status in Japan.\n- Oda plans to draw a spinoff manga focusing on the character of Garp to delve into his relationships.\n- Even after the main story ends, Oda will continue to expand on the One Piece world with new characters and stories.\nEiichiro Oda, the creator of One Piece, has built a world so massive that he's never too short of amazing ideas to drive the story forward. Oda has maintained quality writing consistently for about three decades, but now, slowly, the series is coming to a close.\nRelated\nOne Piece: The D Clan Traitor In The Void Century, Explained\nThe Void Century is still full of mysteries. A traitor in the D clan led to its downfall.\nOne Piece has now entered the Final Saga and in a few years, the story is most definitely going to come to an end. Once it does end, fans won't have much to look forward to, but Oda definitely has plans of his own that will keep them excited.\nWhy One Piece Will Continue With Spin-offs\n- One Piece Is A Massive IP\n- Oda Plans Some Big Spinoffs\nOne Piece being in its final saga only means that the story is inevitably going to come to an end sooner rather than later. Of course, the final saga is not going to be short at all and fans still have years worth of content ahead of them, especially since Oda is now taking more breaks than ever before. However, that still doesn't change the fact that the series ends in a few years. Once Oda does wrap up One Piece, he will most likely want to relax and spend some time with his family after spending the majority of his life working on the serialization of the story. However, eventually, Oda will drop side stories every now and then. This is most certainly going to be the case for two reasons.\nI will end One Piece when I want to. — Oda\nThe first reason is that One Piece is Japan's biggest manga series in history. This story is legendary in every respect and fans know how Shueisha treats its big series. Dragon Ball ended decades ago but it is still continuing to this day. Naruto ended a decade ago and it still has side stories and whatnot. One Piece is far bigger as far as Japan is concerned and there's absolutely no way its mammoth status isn't going to be capitalized upon. One Piece cannot die, no matter what.\nOf course, this doesn't mean there will be pointless One Piece content and that Oda won't be involved in the things. In fact, Oda himself will be drawing side stories in the future, as he's confirmed before.\nOda's Plans For A Garp Story\nOda Has Many Characters He Wants To Elaborate Upon\nOne Piece's main story might end, but the world is ever-expanding and it'll never truly end. Fans will most definitely see Oda drop side stories himself and he's said so in the past as well.\nAbout spin-offs, I came up with a magnificent story about Garp. I'd like to draw his relationship with Akainu, Aokiji, Smoker, Hina, Coby, Cipher Pol, and Roger. — Eiichiro Oda\nClearly, Oda wants to draw side stories and in his mind, Garp would make an excellent protagonist of this story. Oda loves Garp and his complex character would be the best to drive this side story forward in his opinion.\nRelated\nOne Piece: Why Luffy Is Actually An Alien, Explained\nLuffy could be an alien. He has a deep connection to the moon in One Piece.\nOda would expand upon the character of Garp in many ways. Despite being a Marine, Garp doesn't adhere to the Celestial Dragons and considers them to be the scum of the world. He follows his own brand of justice and delivers it in his own way. Garp is very special not just to Oda but also to the fans. His complex relationships with many characters of the world make him unique, and just as Oda mentioned, this side story would give fans a good look at how he shaped his connections with the likes of Kuzan and Sakazuki, two of the leading figures within the Navy, and the up-and-coming generation, which includes the likes of Smoker and Hina.\nGarp And The Roger's Relationships Explored\nCuriously enough, Oda also wants to explore Garp's relationship with the Cipher Pol, which is an organization that works directly for the Celestial Dragons. Clearly, he wouldn't have a high impression of this organization. Most of all, Oda would highlight Garp's relationship with Roger, which is something that fans are dying to see.\nThese elements alone would make the story worth investing in and it just goes to show that even when One Piece ends, Oda can take new approaches through different characters and add further depth to the world of One Piece.\nOne Piece chapter 1145 will be out very soon, later this week. As usual, One Piece is going to drop on the upcoming Sunday. In Japan, One Piece drops at 12AM JST on Monday. However, the vast majority of international readers will see the chapter available on April 6. The official release date of One Piece Chapter 1145 is April 6, 2025. Fans can read the chapter for free on Manga Plus.\nOne Piece\n- Release Date\n- October 20, 1999\n- Network\n- Fuji TV\n- Directors\n- Hiroaki Miyamoto, Konosuke Uda, Junji Shimizu, Satoshi Itō, Munehisa Sakai, Katsumi Tokoro, Yutaka Nakajima, Yoshihiro Ueda, Kenichi Takeshita, Yoko Ikeda, Ryota Nakamura, Hiroyuki Kakudou, Takahiro Imamura, Toshihiro Maeya, Yûji Endô, Nozomu Shishido, Hidehiko Kadota, Sumio Watanabe, Harume Kosaka, Yasuhiro Tanabe, Yukihiko Nakao, Keisuke Onishi, Junichi Fujise, Hiroyuki Satou\n- Writers\n- Jin Tanaka, Akiko Inoue, Junki Takegami, Shinzo Fujita, Shouji Yonemura, Yoshiyuki Suga, Atsuhiro Tomioka, Hirohiko Uesaka, Michiru Shimada, Isao Murayama, Takuya Masumoto, Yoichi Takahashi, Momoka Toyoda\n- Franchise(s)\n-\nOne Piece\nCast\n-\nMayumi TanakaMonkey D.

    "title": "Chad Epperson will return as Sea Dogs manager in 2025",
    "text": "Sea Dogs Manager Chad Epperson points to the Sea Dogs dugout while standing next to Kristian Campbell during a game last season. The Red Sox announced that Epperson will return for his fourth season as Sea Dogs manager. Gregory Rec/Staff Photographer\nThere will be a few changes at Delta Dental Park at Hadlock Field this summer, including the ballpark’s new branded name. One thing not changing, though, is the person guiding the Portland Sea Dogs. Chad Epperson will return to manage the Sea Dogs in 2025, the Boston Red Sox announced Thursday.\n“The atmosphere (at Hadlock Field) is always great. Geoff (Iacuessa, the team’s general manager) runs a first-class organization,” Epperson said in a phone interview Thursday.\nThe upcoming season will be Epperson’s fourth at the helm of the Sea Dogs, Boston’s longtime Double-A affiliate. He joins Arnie Beyeler, who managed the Sea Dogs from 2007-10, as the only four-year managers of the team. Carlos Tosca, the team’s original manager when it began life as the Double-A farm team of the Florida Marlins in 1994, spent three seasons in Portland. Kevin Boles also managed the Sea Dogs for three season, from 2011-13.\nIn his three season, Epperson has a record of 226-186. The Sea Dogs had a winning record in each of Epperson’s first three seasons, reaching the Eastern League playoffs in 2022. Last season, with Boston’s top prospects playing in Portland well into the summer, the Sea Dogs finished with a 78-60 record, the best mark in the Northeast Division. While the Sea Dogs had the best overall record in the division for the season, the Eastern League awards playoff spots to the teams that win each half of the season, and Portland did not qualify.\nBoston’s Class A teams are in Salem, Virginia, and Greenville, South Carolina. Epperson said he enjoys watching the players first experience playing in the heart of Red Sox Nation in front of diehard fans who have anxiously awaited their promotion to Double-A.\n“For a lot of these kids, this is the first taste they get of what Boston sports is all about,” he said.\nAlong with Epperson, a number of coaches will return to Portland this season, including pitching coach Sean Isaac, hitting coach Chris Hess, defensive coach Kyle Sasala and athletic trainer Bobby Stachura. Newcomers to Epperson’s staff include Juan Rivera, who will work with pitchers along with Isaac; assistant hitting coach Johnny Reina; and strength and conditioning coach Jonah Mondloch.\nEpperson said he’s excited to work with coaches he’s grown familiar with the last few seasons. Adding a second pitching coach and second hitting coach will only help in player development, Epperson said.\n“It just goes to show you the organization is using all its resources to help these guys reach their goals and dreams,” he said. “I’m really looking forward to seeing how this all works.”\nEpperson said he reports to the Red Sox spring training facility in Fort Myers, Florida, on Feb. 16. Portland opens the season on April 4 on the road against the Reading Fightin Phils. The home opener is April 8 against the New Hampshire Fisher Cats.",

    "text": "Enhance services for them: speakers The government needs to ease and increase its different services for the expatriates including those related to remittance as their contributions are crucial for the country's economy, speakers said at a discussion yesterday. They also said expatriates should be recognised accordingly for their contributions to the country. Scholars Bangladesh Society and Center for NRB Foundation organised the discussion as part of a two-day celebration on \"National Expatriates Day (NRB Day-2023)\" at a city hotel. It is the responsibility of the Bangladesh government as well as governments of those countries to look after them [expatriates]. Last year, the government announced December 30 as National Expatriates Day which will be observed for the first time this year. Addressing the discussion as chief guest, Planning Minister MA Mannan, who joined virtually, said remittance sent by expatriates contribute positively in two ways -- by boosting the country's foreign exchange reserve and also playing a crucial role in changing the lives of their family members back home. He stressed opening more service-related offices under the expatriates' welfare ministry in the country's migration-prone areas. Besides, expatriates should get priority in receiving different government services, he added. On getting more remittance through formal channels, former Bangladesh Bank governor Atiur Rahman said there was a need for a government step to reduce the difference between exchange rate and market rate to get foreign currency. Prof Atiqul Islam, vice chancellor of North South University, said by sending its workforce abroad, Bangladesh is \"doing favour\" to the receiving countries as many countries are in need of foreign workers due to their ageing population. It is the responsibility of the Bangladesh government as well as governments of those countries to look after them, he added. Foreign Secretary Masud Bin Momen said the government is committed to promote safe, regular and orderly migration. \"Migration remains a central element of our foreign policy priorities,\" he said. As Bangladesh is going to graduate from the least developed country status by 2026, the government has emphasised on upskilling the country's human resources to meet the needs of global markets, he added. There is a need for a government step to reduce the difference between exchange rate and market rate to get foreign currency. At the programme, Prof Pema Gyalpo of Institute of International Japanese Studies at Takushoku University was felicitated for his contribution as a \"fundraiser and organiser\" for refugees during the Liberation War in 1971. Chairing the session, Center for NRB Foundation President ME Chowdhury Shameem lauded the government for announcing a national day for expatriates. On the concluding day on Saturday, a ceremony for \"NRB Day Award\" and \"NRB Day Special Award\" will take place, alongside a discussion, at the same venue. Besides, the book \"Bangabandhu and Japan's Relationship\", written by Prabir Bikash Sarkar, a Bangladeshi author residing in Japan, will be launched during the programme.",

    "text": "The Bureau of Labor Fund Utilization released the latest performance of the labor fund on the 2nd. (Picture: File photo ) The stock market performed satisfactorily last year. The Ministry of Labor announced the latest statistics today (2nd). As of the end of November last year, the new labor retirement fund made a huge profit of 399.95 billion yuan, with a return rate of 10.58%. Based on the 12.51 million households with valid accounts for labor retirement under the new system, the average dividend per household is approximately NT$32,000. The Bureau of Labor Fund Utilization of the Ministry of Labor released labor fund usage statistics for November 2023 on the 2nd. As of the end of November 2023, the overall labor fund scale reached 6.292 billion yuan. Benefiting from the fluctuations in the global financial market last year, the post-evaluation income as of the end of November was 606.67 billion yuan, with a yield of 10.82%. In November alone, Income amounted to 182.79 billion yuan, with investment income growing steadily.

As of the end of November last year, the income was 399.95 billion yuan. The size of the old labor retirement fund is 994 billion yuan, with a yield of 12.66%. As of the end of November last year, the income was 107.6 billion yuan. The size of the labor insurance fund is 860.1 billion yuan, with a return rate of 12.31%. The performance of the new system’s labor retirement fund affects the dividends paid by the new system’s labor retirement contributions. According to statistics, the income from January to the end of November last year was 399.95 billion yuan. Based on the 12.51 million valid accounts of the new labor retirement system, the average dividend amount per household in the first 11 months of last year was 31,970 yuan. The new labor retirement fund will suffer a loss of 228.03 billion yuan in 2022, the largest loss in history; the new labor retirement fund will have satisfactory returns in 2023. Based on the current rate of return, the labor dividend in March will exceed 10%. The New Labor Retirement System Fund fixes the income of the year before distribution in March every year. The Ministry of Labor emphasized that the actual amount of income distributed to workers is related to the cumulative investment amount in the worker’s personal account, investment years and other factors. The monthly and annual accounting data are for reference only. Advertisement (Please continue reading this article) The Bureau of Labor Fund Operations stated that after major central banks continued to tighten monetary policies, the inflation rate finally showed signs of slowing down, which also brought positive news to the financial market. The market also expected that major central banks would terminate the cycle of interest rate hikes, which was beneficial to the performance of the stock market last year. . The Labor Fund Utilization Bureau further pointed out that the spillover effects of high interest rates continue to depress global economic performance, and coupled with global geopolitical risks, I am afraid that it will affect the recovery time of global trade. In the future, we will closely monitor the global political and economic situation and adjust the range of asset allocation changes. Within the scope, we actively manage the global diversified investment layout to enhance the long-term investment efficiency of the fund.

    "text": "O presidente da Câmara, Arthur Lira (PP-AL) , declarou nesta sexta-feira (29), por meio de uma rede social, que os deputados se empenharão com todo esforço, celeridade e boa vontade” para aprovar as medidas de redução de gastos propostas pelo governo federal.\n“Reafirmo o compromisso inabalável da Câmara dos Deputados com o arcabouço fiscal. Toda medida de corte de gastos que se faça necessária para o ajuste das contas públicas contará com todo esforço, celeridade e boa vontade da Casa, que está disposta a contribuir e aprimorar”, publicou.\nEm publicações seguintes, o chefe da Casa Baixa destacou que a inflação e a valorização do dólar são “problemas que afetam de forma mais intensa as camadas mais pobres da população”.\nEle também fez uma menção, sem citar diretamente o projeto, a uma possível objeção em relação ao outro tema divulgado pelo governo nesta semana: a reforma da tabela do Imposto de Renda, que visa elevar para R$ 5 mil a faixa de isenção do tributo.\n“Qualquer outra iniciativa governamental que implique em renúncia de receitas será enfrentada apenas no ano que vem, e após análise cuidadosa e sobretudo realista de suas fontes de financiamento e efetivo impacto nas contas públicas. Uma coisa de cada vez. Responsabilidade fiscal é inegociável”, postou.\nReafirmo o compromisso inabalável da Câmara dos Deputados com o arcabouço fiscal. Toda medida de corte de gastos que se faça necessária para o ajuste das contas públicas contará com todo esforço, celeridade e boa vontade da Casa, que está disposta a contribuir e aprimorar.\n— Arthur Lira (@ArthurLira_) November 29, 2024 Lula diz que pacote fiscal é ‘uma medida extraordinária’ O pacote de corte de gastos anunciado na quarta-feira (27) pelo ministro da Fazenda, Fernando Haddad (PT), foi uma “uma medida extraordinária que é de contenção do excesso de despesas”, na avaliação do presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT) .\nSegundo Lula, a medida possibilita, ao mesmo tempo, cumprir o arcabouço fiscal e garantir justiça tributária.\n“Foi anunciado ontem pelo Haddad, eu participei da reunião com o presidente do Senado, com o presidente da Câmara, com os líderes da Câmara dos Deputados, uma medida extraordinária que é de contenção do excesso de despesas. Porque nós temos que cumprir o arcabouço fiscal, e ao mesmo tempo apresentamos uma política de renda para que a gente possa garantir que as pessoas que ganham até 5 mil reais não paguem mais Imposto de Renda nesse país, porque não é possível que os pobres sejam aqueles que pagam Imposto de Renda”, disse Lula, segundo o “Valor”.\n“E, ao mesmo tempo, a gente pegar aquelas pessoas mais ricas, sem nenhum abuso, com muita neutralidade, a gente cobrar um percentual daquilo que eles ganham, que é muito baixo. Ou seja, cobrar 10% daquilo de quem ganha acima de 50 mil, acima de 100 mil, acima de 200 mil, acima de 1 milhão”, prosseguiu o presidente.\nAlém disso, Lula também afirmou que o tema agora irá para o Congresso Nacional e será aprovado “no momento certo”. O presidente esteve na cerimônia de assinatura de aditivo para obras da Transnordestina.\n“[O pacote] é uma coisa muito tranquila, que vai para o Congresso Nacional. O Congresso Nacional vai discutir, e no momento certo, a gente vai conseguir aprovar para que esse país continue sendo um país de muita inclusão social, de muita justiça social, para que a gente possa dar ao povo brasileiro o direito de viver com uma certa dignidade nesse país”, afirmou.",
