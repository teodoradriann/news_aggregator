    "text": "The pattern of hot, humid\nweather with threats of thunderstorms continues Friday and through the weekend in New Jersey.\nTemperatures will climb well into the 90s on Friday with a heat index of 100 degrees or higher in most places, conditions that the National Weather Service describes as “dangerously hot.”\nAny afternoon storms could also be accompanied by damaging winds so power outages can’t be ruled out.\nAll of New Jersey is under either a heat advisory or excessive heat warning through Friday evening. There’s also a marginal risk (1 on a 5-point scale) for severe weather on Friday.\nSaturday and Sunday won’t be much different with highs around 90 degrees and the potential for afternoon and evening storms both days. Flash flooding is a threat with any thunderstorms that form on Saturday, forecasters say.\nRain won’t be nearly as big a threat on Sunday and cloud cover will contribute to conditions that are a bit less stifling than Saturday though “it will still feel fairly unpleasant outside,” the weather service said.\nNewark Liberty International Airport reached 100 on Thursday, breaking the record for Aug. 1. The high Thursday in Trenton was 96, short of the record 99 set in 2002. Temps in Atlantic City climbed to 94, also shy of the top mark of 97 established in 2006.\nHeat advisories and excessive heat warnings for New Jersey:\n- Somerset, Middlesex, western Monmouth, Mercer, Gloucester, Camden, northwestern Burlington: An excessive heat warning is in effect until 8 p.m. The heat index might reach as high as 106 degrees.\n- Sussex: A heat advisory that lasts until 8 p.m. The heat index is expected to climb to 100.\n- Hunterdon, Morris, Warren: The heat index is likely to top out at 103 during a heat advisory that runs until 8 p.m.\n- Ocean, southeastern Burlington: A heat index of up to 104 is in the forecast. A heat advisory expires at 8 p.m.\n- Atlantic, Cape May: The heat advisory kicks in at 10 a.m. and lasts until 8 p.m. The heat index could soar to 105.\n- Bergen, Essex, Hudson, western Passaic and Union: The heat advisory runs through 7 p.m. Saturday as the heat index might reach the upper 90s to near 100.\n- Western Passaic: The heat index will reach the mid 90s during a heat advisory that ends at 7 p.m. Saturday.\nCurrent weather radar\nStories by\nJeff Goldman\nOur journalism needs your support.

    "title": "General David Petraeus discusses new book 'Conflict: The Evolution of Warfare from 1945 to Ukraine' | Herald Community Newspapers | www.liherald.com",
    "text": "Hundreds gathered at Congregation L’Dor V’Dor on Monday evening to hear one of the most impactful military minds of the modern world, talk about his new book, and the history and progress of global military conflicts. Gen. David Petraeus joined former congressman Steve Israel — owner of Theodore’s Books in Oyster Bay — to discuss a wide range of topics, nearly all of which are covered in his book, “Conflict: The Evolution of Warfare from 1945 to Ukraine.” That includes the running of a counterinsurgency force, the war in Ukraine, and the even the Israel-Gaza conflict. Israel, who has known the general since his time in Congress, explained their friendship developed through a mutual appreciation for history and its importance in understanding the modern world. He added Petraeus was one of the first who recommended David McCullough’s book about Theodore Roosevelt, “Mornings on Horseback,” and was struck by the general’s scholarly approach to command. “He said, ‘Congressman, if you really want to understand present conflict and how to deal with challenges, you have to read,’” Israel said. “That’s really how this relationship developed.” “Conflict,” co-written by British historian Andrew Roberts, covers the evolution of modern warfare from the end of World War II up to Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Petraeus — a commander in Iraq and Afghanistan who also served as the director of the CIA — discussed how “strategic leadership,” one of the book’s main themes, define modern warfare, and how it’s applicable to daily life. “You have to craft the right strategy, based on a very detailed understanding of your forces — the enemy forces, the physical terrain, the human terrain, the neighborhood, how the country is supposed to work, how it really works — all of these details,” Petraeus said. “In the case of Iraq (in 2003), it was the different religions, the sects, the tribes, the political parties — all of the other elements that are present in that particular context — and I’ll note that we didn’t have a sufficient understanding of that when we went into Iraq, as we found.” Petraeus also focused on the numerous lessons that could be learned from the wars of the latter half of the 20th century, like those in Vietnam, as well as the 1973 Yom Kippur War between Israel and a coalition of Arab countries led by Egypt and Syria. When it comes to more recent conflicts, like the one between Russia and Ukraine, Petraeus described it as being “about as ‘right versus wrong’ as it gets in life,” comparing the strategic styles of Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Vladimir Putin. “This is a brutal, unprovoked invasion of a country by a kleptocrat who doesn’t believe that country has the right to exist,” Petraeus said of Putin. “Henry Kissinger rightly said that ‘NATO’s security now begins at the Ukraine/Russia border,’ and the sooner that (Israel and former U.S. Rep. Peter King’s) successors in the House in particular can get their act together and agree with the Senate on this supplemental bill that will provide the additional assistance that Ukraine so desperately needs … the better off we’ll be.” Israel started his series of conversations with authors after he left Congress in 2017, viewing it as a way to bridge the political divide while providing relevant, unbiased information to patrons of Theodore’s. He told the Herald ahead of the discussion he found Petraeus to be “one of the most insightful and deep thinkers in the military.” “I learned from him that I can’t understand modern-day complexities or strategic complexities without understanding history,” Israel said. The retired general’s book — “Conflict: The Evolution of Warfare from 1945 to Ukraine” — is available where books are sold, including at Theodore’s Books on Audrey Avenue in Oyster Bay.",

    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Pinellas County, Florida from 1901-2000 was 61.5. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Pinellas County, Florida experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Pinellas County, Florida history.",

    "title": "Blake Lively’s Embarrassing Interview Resurfaces",
    "text": "Lia Toby/Getty Images This article contains discussions of domestic violence.\nThe drama surrounding “It Ends With Us” has been all over social media since the film’s August 9 release, and now, an old interview is circulating that paints Blake Lively in a fairly unflattering light.\nWhile Lively and her co-star were promoting their 2016 film “Café Society” — which, as it happens, was written and directed by Woody Allen, who’s also no stranger to controversy — they sat down with Kjersti Flaa, who posted the entire exchange to YouTube with the caption “The Blake Lively interview that made me want to quit my job.” Lively was newly pregnant during the interview, and Flaa congratulates the star on her “little bump,” at which point Lively responds, “Congrats on your little bump!” She and Posey go on to make jokes about “bumps” on their bodies, but it also gets a little weirder from there.\nAsked about the costumes, Lively wonders if the male actors in the film, including Jesse Eisenberg and Corey Stoll, are asked about their costumes, and then she and Posey go off on a tangent — without Flaa participating — about the overall design of the movie. It’s definitely awkward. As Flaa writes in the video’s description, “Is it not ok to congratulate someone on their pregnancy or to ask another woman about costumes she is wearing in a film?”\nJeff Spicer/Getty Images Social media reactions to this 2016 interview with Blake Lively are definitely mixed; some fans are defending the “Gossip Girl” star, while others are using it as evidence that she’s behind the alleged “It Ends With Us” drama. On X (formerly known as Twitter), @_RandomJ_ wrote, “People defending Blake Lively here are wild. Her pregnancy at this point was announced. The full video is far worse than this clip, as Blake refuses to acknowledge the interviewer for most of the interview. Kjersti Flaa is better than me. I woulda cussed Blake out on camera.” @quillfountain agreed, writing, “‘congrats on your little bump’ despite Kjersti Flaa (the interviewer) never confirmed her pregnancy is rude on Blake’s part. It normalizes and trivializes bodyshaming. Also, the fact she mostly ignored Kjersti to have a conversation with her co-actress adds insult to injury.”\nNot everyone thought Lively was at fault here, though. @effoff1988 posted a lengthy thread about the matter beginning with the statement, “Few things I hate more than clout chasers like Kjersti Flaa jumping on hate bandwagons when that’s the trend of the week. Blake Lively had a questionable approach to how to handle press for her latest film. True. Starting a constructive conversation about that, is fair.” @urbanbatfitters pointed out that Lively was correct about the double standard: “Kjersti Flaa is such a joke. That 2016 interview with Blake Lively and Parker Posey she shared? Yeah, that was the height of women in Hollywood refusing to answer sexist and invasive questions such as comments on baby bumps, relationships, and costuming, when those same questions were not asked of men.”\nGareth Cattermole/Getty Images Okay, let’s back up. Why is everyone so laser-focused on Blake Lively’s behavior during press tours, and what does it have to do with her latest film “It Ends with Us?” Lively stars in the film as florist Lily Blossom Bloom opposite Justin Baldoni (“Jane the Virgin”), who plays Lily’s love interest Ryle Kincaid. Unfortunately, Lily soon discovers that Ryle is abusive, echoing the relationship between her parents (which we see in flashback with Isabela Ferrer as a young Lily), and has to find a way to end the cycle of generational trauma and abuse … particularly when the two have a daughter.\nThe drama appears to be centered around Lively and Baldoni — the two have done basically zero press together, and Baldoni also seems to be isolated from the rest of the main cast to boot. Baldoni has focused on the film’s darker themes, while Lively has used her press tour to discuss both the themes of the film and her new haircare line; her husband Ryan Reynolds has also been heavily involved while promoting his own film “Deadpool & Wolverine.” Because of this perceived conflict, people are digging up “evidence” against Lively and Baldoni alike, and this resurfaced Kjersti Flaa interview is a symptom of that.\n“It Ends with Us” is in theaters now.\nIf you or someone you know is dealing with domestic abuse, you can call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1−800−799−7233. You can also find more information, resources, and support at their website.\nSource: Looper",

    "text": "Mises Wire Why Secession Offers a Path to Wealth and Self-Determination [Decentralization and Secession](/topics/decentralization-and-secession) [This article is chapter 5 of [Breaking Away: The Case for Secession, Radical Decentralization, and Smaller Polities](https://mises.org/library/breaking-away-case-secession-radical-decentralization-and-smaller-polities/html). Now available [at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Breaking-Away-Secession-Decentralization-Polities/dp/1610167589/?tag=misesinsti-20) and in [the Mises Store](https://store.mises.org/Breaking-Away-The-Case-for-Secession-Radical-Decentralization-and-Smaller-Polities-P11245.aspx).] One of the most consistent and enthusiastic defenders of human rights and “natural rights” in the twentieth century was the economist and historian Murray Rothbard. A self-described libertarian, Rothbard would also have fit in well among the more radical liberals of the nineteenth century such as the Belgian-French economist Gustave de Molinari and the American anarchist Lysander Spooner. Like Spooner—a New England abolitionist who advocated for the dissolution of the United States through secession—Rothbard supported the “radical decentralization” of the state. Indeed, Rothbard regarded secession and other forms of decentralization as central to limiting the power of sovereign states—which he regarded as critical in lessening the abuses inflicted by regimes on the population. For example, in May 1969, Rothbard published an editorial in Libertarian Forum endorsing the mayoral candidacy of Norman Mailer. Specifically, Rothbard backed Mailer’s support for the idea of decentralizing New York’s gargantuan city government into a number of much smaller neighborhood governments. Rothbard also presumably liked Mailer’s idea “that New York City secede from New York State and form a separate 51st State.” Decentralizing New York’s government, Rothbard concluded, was: a position not only consistent with breaking up large governmental bodies but also with the crucial libertarian principle of secession. Secession is a crucial part of the libertarian philosophy: that every state be allowed to secede from the nation, every sub-state from the state, every neighborhood from the city, and, logically, every individual or group from the neighborhood. [1](#footnote1_ldxa5ic) Later, in a 1977 editorial supporting the secession of Quebec from Canada, Rothbard wrote: There are two positive reasons for the libertarian to cheer at the imminent achievement of Quebec Independence. In the first place, secession—the breaking up of a State from within—is a great good in itself for any libertarian. It means that a giant central State is being broken up into constituent parts; it means greater competition between governments of different geographical areas, enabling people of one State to zip across the border to relatively greater freedom more easily; and it exalts the mighty libertarian principle of secession, which we hope to extend on down from the region to the city to the block to the individual. [2](#footnote2_25y2qux) We find in the pages of Libertarian Forum numerous calls for secession around the globe. Rothbard penned editorials supporting the secession of Biafra from Nigeria. He lamented the US’s intervention in the “secession movement” of Moise Tschombe in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and which led to “an artificially centralized Congo.” [3](#footnote3_bgjhuee) In 1983, Rothbard supported the separation of Greek Cyprus from Turkish Cyprus, denouncing the US state’s call for unity. Rothbard asked, “why shouldn’t the Turkish minority on Cyprus have the power to secede and set up their own republic?” (italics in original). [4](#footnote4_17g3ehz) This is all in line with passages from Rothbard’s book Power and Market. In the chapter on “Defenses on the Free Market,” Rothbard noted that almost no one insists that in order to function, human society requires one single state to impose a just system of law. In fact, many recognize that the establishment of a single global mega-state comes with many downsides. So, given that it is acceptable that there be more than one political entity, the principle ought to be merely expanded down to the most basic level possible: If Canada and the United States can be separate nations without being denounced as being in a state of impermissible “anarchy,” why may not the South secede from the United States? New York State from the Union? New York City from the state? Why may not Manhattan secede? Each neighborhood? Each block? Each house? Each person? [5](#footnote5_h0wpfli) Needless to say, Rothbard comes down on the prosecession side of this debate. During the 1990s, Rothbard supported numerous cases of secession during the breakup of the old Iron Curtain, including in the Baltic states, Slovenia, and Czechoslovakia. In 1994, he continued to push for the breaking up of the old Soviet Union and all other large states—including the United States—contending: In short, every group, every nationality, should be allowed to secede from any nation-state and to join any other nation-state that agrees to have it. [6](#footnote6_e50gxjg) But if Rothbard regarded individual freedom as the most important political value—not to be confused with the most important value overall—why did he regard secession as so important? After all, secession in itself does not guarantee more freedom to the inhabitants of the new, smaller jurisdiction. Rothbard pushed secession for two main reasons: First, he regarded it as a useful tactic in moving toward his ideal of maximum individual freedom. Second, even when this ideal is not achieved, decentralization is valuable because smaller states are less able to exercise monopoly power than large states. Decentralization Brings Us Closer to Individual Political Independence Rothbard noted that the purpose of seceding on the neighborhood level and beyond was to move toward true individual political independence: But, of course, if each person may secede from government, we have virtually arrived at the purely free society, where defense is supplied along with all other services by the free market and where the invasive State has ceased to exist. [7](#footnote7_muljjr6) In this, Rothbard was not making a novel observation, but taking an argument earlier made by the laissez-faire economist Ludwig von Mises to its natural conclusion. In Liberalism (1927), Mises wrote of the need for highly localized government as a means of “self-determination.” His view stemmed from the problem of ensuring that minority groups would not be overwhelmed by other groups that formed a majority within a larger jurisdiction. Mises writes: However, the right of self-determination of which we speak is not the right of self-determination of nations, but rather the right of self-determination of the inhabitants of every territory large enough to form an independent administrative unit. If it were in any way possible to grant this right of self-determination to every individual person, it would have to be done. [8](#footnote8_y0uh264) Mises suggested that this could be accomplished through secession: whenever the inhabitants of a particular territory, whether it be a single village, a whole district, or a series of adjacent districts, make it known, by a freely conducted plebiscite, that they no longer wish to remain united to the state to which they belong at the time, but wish either to form an independent state or to attach themselves to some other state, their wishes are to be respected and complied with. [9](#footnote9_3is1d02) For his part, Mises apparently thought it too difficult—in terms of real-world implementation—to provide self-determination “to every individual person” even if separation was morally preferable. [10](#footnote10_2kgagqq) Rothbard similarly regarded this sort of full-blown decentralization down to the individual as a difficult endeavor. Thus, he supported secession as a strategy which moved society in the proper direction: Pending total privatization, it is clear that our model could be approached, and conflicts minimized, by permitting secessions and local control, down to the micro-neighborhood level, and by developing contractual access rights for enclaves and exclaves. In the US, it becomes important, in moving toward such radical decentralization, for libertarians and classical liberals—indeed, for many other minority or dissident groups—to begin to lay the greatest stress on the forgotten Tenth Amendment and to try to decompose the role and power of the centralizing Supreme Court. Rather than trying to get people of one’s own ideological persuasion on the Supreme Court, its power should be rolled back and minimized as far as possible, and its power decomposed into state, or even local, judicial bodies. [11](#footnote11_fggwo4x) This will strike many Americans as quite radical. Yet, for these theorists it is important to at least move in the direction of more localized control as a means of limiting state power and expanding individual prerogatives and choices. Like Mises, Rothbard contended that smaller, more decentralized government made it more likely that individuals would be able to live within a community that more closely reflected their individual preferences and needs. That is, secession is a tool to increase “self-determination” for both voluntary communities and individuals. Smaller States Are Less Oppressive States The second reason that Rothbard advocated secession and radical decentralization was his belief that small states were less capable of exercising power over those who lived within their borders. As he noted in Libertarian Forum, Rothbard thought it a good thing that smaller states facilitated individual efforts to cross “the border to relatively greater freedom.” Moreover, the smaller that states become, the less culturally isolated they are, and the less they are able to promote the myth that states can make their people better off through barriers to trade and exchange: A common response to a world of proliferating nations is to worry about the multitude of trade barriers that might be erected. But, other things being equal, the greater the number of new nations, and the smaller the size of each, the better. For it would be far more difficult to sow the illusion of self-sufficiency if the slogan were “Buy North Dakotan” or even “Buy 56th Street” than it now is to convince the public to “Buy American.” Similarly, “Down with South Dakota,” or…“Down with 55th Street,” would be a more difficult sell than spreading fear or hatred of the Japanese. Similarly, the absurdities and the unfortunate consequences of fiat paper money would be far more evident if each province or each neighborhood or street block were to print its own currency. A more decentralized world would be far more likely to turn to sound market commodities, such as gold or silver, for its money. [12](#footnote12_gel8e3k) It was this “greater competition between governments of different geographical areas” which Rothbard regarded as a net gain for individuals. After all, as noted by historian Ralph Raico, [13](#footnote13_2dcq62n) many economic historians by the mid-1970s had accepted the notion that competition between a large number of political units had been an important factor in Europe’s rise to a region of relative material riches and relative political freedom. Historians E.L. Jones, [14](#footnote14_z996toz) Jean Baechler, [15](#footnote15_h0nxjda) and Douglass North [16](#footnote16_rypm5bo) by the late seventies had all published new works contending that it was Europe’s lack of a single dominant political entity—that is, Europe’s relative “political anarchy”—which led to greater political freedom, and thus more economic prosperity. It is likely that Rothbard was aware of this, and in this recognized it as empirical support for what was in many ways common sense: a world of a multitude of states offers more options and more avenues of escape to those who face political oppression. Later research has continued to support this position. Since the end of the Cold War, Europe’s smaller states have been notable for being more open to free trade than larger states, and smaller states have pushed down their tax rates to attract capital. Indeed, the presence of this tax competition has pushed down tax rates in larger states as well. In Africa, too, smaller states have been shown to be more politically stable, more free, and less inclined toward controlled economies. On both these counts, experience suggests that Rothbard has been right. For example, it’s hard to see how Estonians, Poles, and Slovenians would all be somehow better off were they still chained to their old masters in Moscow or Belgrade. Meanwhile, experience continues to support the notion that it is small states and microstates that continue to offer freedom, choice, and openness of a sort not even contemplated by large states like China, or even Germany.

[10.](#footnoteref10_2kgagqq)Mises was surely familiar with the fact that plebiscites had already been used on numerous occasions to approve independence movements and the annexation of territories by larger states. By the beginning of the twentieth century, the idea of holding local elections to settle border disputes or the inclusion of a region within a certain polity was anything but novel. The use of plebiscites in this way dates back at least to the years of the French Revolution when the French state used plebiscites in the Papal States enclaves within France, and in other territories. Other examples include a 1905 plebiscite in which Norwegian voters approved secession from Sweden, and Iceland’s independence plebiscite in 1919. For more examples from the nineteenth century, see Sarah Wambaugh, A Monograph on Plebiscites: With a Collection of Official Documents (New York: Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 1920). Plebiscites have been used numerous times since Mises wrote these words, as well. For example, in 1964, Maltese voters approved independence from the United Kingdom in a plebiscite. In 1990, Slovenia declared independence from Yugoslavia via plebiscite. The new Slovenian republic ultimately won independence after the nearly bloodless Ten-Day War. In the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union, plebiscites were held in several Soviet republics including Ukraine and the Baltic states. Outside Europe, of course, many more secession plebiscites were held throughout the twentieth century as part of the process of decolonization in Africa and Asia.
