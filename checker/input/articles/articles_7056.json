    "title": "Roku Scores Exclusive Rights to \"Just a Bit Outside,\" a Love Letter to the 1982 Milwaukee Brewers",
    "text": "Roku, the top TV streaming platform in the U.S., is stepping up to the plate just in time for baseball season with a home run acquisition. Starting April 11, 2025, fans can catch “Just a Bit Outside,” a documentary celebrating the unforgettable 1982 Milwaukee Brewers, exclusively on The Roku Channel . The film, available through June 30, dives into the wild ride of a team that came tantalizingly close to World Series glory, capturing the heart of a hardworking city along the way.\nDirected by Sean Hanish, “Just a Bit Outside” tells the story of a scrappy, colorful crew of ballplayers whose camaraderie and grit defined an era. This wasn’t just a team—it was a brotherhood that mirrored the blue-collar spirit of Milwaukee, a bond that’s endured for over four decades. The documentary doesn’t shy away from the highs and lows of that near-championship season, blending nostalgia with raw emotion. Fresh off a successful Midwest theatrical run and a “Best Sports Film” win at the Louisville International Film Festival, it’s earned a rare 100% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes—no small feat.\nFor Roku , snagging this gem is a big win. “The Brewers have a rich history filled with incredible stories, and we’re honored to bring fans an in-depth look at one of the most memorable seasons in baseball,” said David Eilenberg, Head of Content at Roku Media. “We’re excited to partner with Sean Hanish, Kelly Kahl, and the Cannonball team to deliver more premium sports content to our lineup.” It’s a natural fit for The Roku Channel, which has been steadily beefing up its free, ad-supported offerings to keep viewers hooked.Fr\nThe filmmakers couldn’t be happier about the matchup. “Roku’s massive footprint and passion for sports programming make them the perfect partner,” said producer Kelly Kahl. “Their ability to get this film in front of sports fans is unmatched.” Hanish echoed that excitement, adding, “We’re thrilled to premiere so close to opening day when baseball fever is at its peak. Huge thanks to David and the Roku team for championing independent storytelling and making this universally accessible.”\nThe documentary’s roster is stacked with talent both behind and in front of the camera. Alongside Hanish, producers include Kahl, Paul Jaconi-Biery, and editor Tim Calandrello, with Derek Beamer as executive producer. Gorman Thomas, the Brewers’ two-time American League Home Run Champ and ’82 centerfielder, even steps up as an associate producer. Fans will spot legends like Bud Selig, Robin Yount, Rollie Fingers, and Bob Uecker, alongside other key ’82 Brewers like Paul Molitor and Cecil Cooper, bringing authenticity to every frame.\nBest of all, “Just a Bit Outside” is free to stream—no subscription, no sign-up, just pure baseball nostalgia. You can watch it on Roku devices , TheRokuChannel.com , or through apps on Amazon Fire TV, Samsung TVs, Google TV, and more. As opening day looms, this is one story Brewers fans—and baseball lovers everywhere—won’t want to miss.\nPlease follow us on Facebook and X for more news, tips, and reviews.

Some people are making old footage viral as today’s footage.\nShe questioned the propagandists if they saw Thursday’s footage from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where 24 people died in rains over three days. On the other hand, according to the Meteorological Department, the rainy spell is expected to continue until August 6.\nRainfall did not only impact Lahore, but multiple cities across the country including Karachi, Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Sheikhupura, Pakpattan, Kasur, Jehlum, among others received rain, with low-lying areas submerged.\nHe added that there are heavy rains across Lahore. “There were more rains in Sindh compared to Punjab. But this was expected.”\nMeanwhile, in KP a glacier outburst in Sorej area of Chitral district played havoc as it led to heavy floods that washed away a big part of a village including a mosque that resulted in several deaths and injuries. The Provincial Disaster Management Authority has warned of torrential rains from August 1 to August 6 that may lead to heavy flooding, land sliding and collapse of building structures asking the people to remain more vigilant and adopt precautionary measures.\nAccording to PDMA those killed in rains and floods related incidents during the last three days include 12 were children, 7 women and 6 men.

The driver lost control of the vehicle when the brakes failed at the slippery road causing it to plunge into a deep ravine.\nThe PDMA has directed the district administrations of the affected districts to provide immediate financial assistance to the victims. The Authorities have once again advised the tourists to avoid traveling to tourist destinations until the situation returns to normal.\nEmergency Operation Center is fully operational and public/tourists can contact 1700 for any untoward incident, weather conditions, road closures and guidance. The PDMA said and cautioned the district administrations that urban flooding was likely to cause flooding in low lying areas. It said the land sliding may disrupt the roads at the vulnerable points of the hilly areas thus asking the tourists to avoid traveling to tourist destinations until the situation returns to normal.",

    "title": "Google criticized as AI Overview makes errors, like saying President Obama is Muslim",
    "text": "It's been less than two weeks since Google debuted \"AI Overview\" in Google Search, and public criticism has mounted after queries have returned nonsensical or inaccurate results within the AI feature — without any way to opt out. AI Overview shows a quick summary of answers to search questions at the very top of Google Search. For example, if a user searches for the best way to clean leather boots, the results page may display an \"AI Overview\" at the top with a multistep cleaning process, gleaned from information it synthesized from around the web. But social media users have shared a wide range of screenshots showing the AI tool giving incorrect and controversial responses. Google, Microsoft, OpenAI and other companies are at the helm of a generative AI arms race as companies in seemingly every industry rush to add AI-powered chatbots and agents to avoid being left behind by competitors. The market is predicted to top $1 trillion in revenue within a decade. Here are some examples of errors produced by AI Overview, according to screenshots shared by users. When asked how many Muslim presidents the U.S. has had, AI Overview responded , \"The United States has had one Muslim president, Barack Hussein Obama.\" When a user searched for \"cheese not sticking to pizza,\" the feature suggested adding \"about 1/8 cup of nontoxic glue to the sauce.\" Social media users found an 11-year-old Reddit comment that seemed to be the source. Attribution can also be a problem for AI Overview, especially in attributing inaccurate information to medical professionals or scientists. For instance, when asked, \"How long can I stare at the sun for best health,\" the tool said , \"According to WebMD, scientists say that staring at the sun for 5-15 minutes, or up to 30 minutes if you have darker skin, is generally safe and provides the most health benefits.\" When asked, \"How many rocks should I eat each day,\" the tool said , \"According to UC Berkeley geologists, people should eat at least one small rock a day,\" going on to list the vitamins and digestive benefits. The tool also can respond inaccurately to simple queries, such as making up a list of fruits that end with \"um,\" or saying the year 1919 was 20 years ago . When asked whether or not Google Search violates antitrust law, AI Overview said , \"Yes, the U.S. Justice Department and 11 states are suing Google for antitrust violations.\" The day Google rolled out AI Overview at its annual Google I/O event, the company said it also plans to introduce assistant-like planning capabilities directly within search. It explained that users will be able to search for something like, \"Create a 3-day meal plan for a group that's easy to prepare,\" and they'd get a starting point with a wide range of recipes from across the web. \"The vast majority of AI Overviews provide high quality information, with links to dig deeper on the web,\" a Google spokesperson told CNBC in a statement. \"Many of the examples we've seen have been uncommon queries, and we've also seen examples that were doctored or that we couldn't reproduce.\" The spokesperson said AI Overview underwent extensive testing before launch and that the company is taking \"swift action where appropriate under our content policies.\" The news follows Google's high-profile rollout of Gemini's image-generation tool in February, and a pause that same month after comparable issues. The tool allowed users to enter prompts to create an image, but almost immediately, users discovered historical inaccuracies and questionable responses, which circulated widely on social media. For instance, when one user asked Gemini to show a German soldier in 1943, the tool depicted a racially diverse set of soldiers wearing German military uniforms of the era, according to screenshots on social media platform X. When asked for a \"historically accurate depiction of a medieval British king,\" the model generated another racially diverse set of images, including one of a woman ruler, screenshots showed. Users reported similar outcomes when they asked for images of the U.S. founding fathers, an 18th-century king of France, a German couple in the 1800s and more. The model showed an image of Asian men in response to a query about Google's own founders, users reported. Google said in a statement at the time that it was working to fix Gemini's image-generation issues, acknowledging that the tool was \"missing the mark.\" Soon after, the company announced it would immediately \"pause the image generation of people\" and \"re-release an improved version soon.\" In February, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis said Google planned to relaunch its image-generation AI tool in the next \"few weeks,\" but it has not yet rolled out again. The problems with Gemini's image-generation outputs reignited a debate within the AI industry, with some groups calling Gemini too \"woke,\" or left-leaning, and others saying that the company didn't sufficiently invest in the right forms of AI ethics. Google came under fire in 2020 and 2021 for ousting the co-leads of its AI ethics group after they published a research paper critical of certain risks of such AI models and then later reorganizing the group's structure. In 2023, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google's parent company, Alphabet, was criticized by some employees for the company's botched and \"rushed\" rollout of Bard , which followed the viral spread of ChatGPT. Correction: This article has been updated to reflect the correct name of Google's AI Overview. Also, an earlier version of this article included a link to a screenshot that Google later confirmed was doctored.",

    "title": "Abrir “todo el invierno” los recursos de Vitoria para personas sin hogar",
    "text": "El PP Vitoria ha propuesto este viernes “abrir todo el invierno de forma ininterrumpida” los recursos municipales de alojamiento invernal para personas sin hogar.\nEl motivo, como denuncia, es que desde hace tres años, no hay Dispositivo de Alojamiento Invernal (DAI) durante todo el invierno, sino que se activan y desactivan unas ‘Jornadas de Puertas Abiertas’ solamente cuando se decreta una situación de emergencia meteorológica.\n\"Lo que supone que los recursos estén menos días disponibles\", reprocha este grupo municipal.\nRecuerda al respecto que antes se establecía un periodo de tiempo \"concreto\" durante los meses del invierno, los de más frío en Vitoria, para el Dispositivo de Alojamiento Invernal (DAI), que se extendía normalmente entre noviembre y marzo, y, además, se aumentaba el número de plazas.\n\"Con el nuevo funcionamiento, ha habido un drástico recorte de días en los que se da respuesta con alojamiento a las personas que pernoctan en la calle durante el periodo invernal\"\n\"Recorte de días\"\nPor ello, considera que con el nuevo funcionamiento, ha habido un \"drástico recorte de días\" en los que se da respuesta con alojamiento a las personas que pernoctan en la calle durante el periodo invernal,\" a pesar de que las noches de frío en Vitoria son muchas más que las de emergencia meteorológica.\nEn concreto, en las últimas fechas se ha pasado de los 96 días en 2019-2020 (último periodo del DAI), a 21 días en 2020-2021 y a 28 días en 2021-2022\".\nMás en la calle\nLa edil popular Marta Alaña destaca que la cifra de personas que duermen en la calle en Vitoria ha aumentado \"considerablemente\".\n\"De 42 que había en 2022, ahora podrían ser muchas más. Y los recursos municipales están saturados. Por eso, desde el Partido Popular de Vitoria vamos a plantear al Gobierno de PSOE y PNV que reconsideren esa decisión y vuelvan a poner en funcionamiento las plazas de acogida nocturna para personas sin hogar durante todo el invierno y de forma ininterrumpida”, anuncia Alaña.\nEn este momento, el Ayuntamiento ha habilitado 20 plazas de refuerzo, pero censuran que el Consistorio no ha aclarado cuál será la vigencia temporal de las mismas.\nPor ello, el Partido Popular de Vitoria defenderá una iniciativa el próximo viernes 19 en el Pleno del Ayuntamiento para reclamar que esas 20 plazas de refuerzo en los recursos de acogida nocturna para personas sin hogar se establezcan “durante todo el invierno de forma ininterrumpida”.",
