    "title": "Samsung's Earnings Shock: High Stakes for Roh Tae-moon and the Galaxy S25",
    "text": "Samsung Electronics posted weaker-than-expected earnings for the fourth quarter of 2024, impacted by a slowdown in its semiconductor business and weaker performance in its Mobile Experience (MX) division, including underwhelming sales of foldable phones. As pressure mounts, MX chief Roh Tae-moon is pinning hopes on the upcoming Galaxy S25 series to reverse the trend.\nSamsung announced on January 8 that its Q4 operating profit rose 130.5% year-on-year to KRW 6.5 trillion ($5.4 billion), but fell short of market expectations of over KRW 7 trillion. The figure also marked a 29.2% decline from Q3 2024.\nThe MX division, a key profit driver, is estimated to have generated slightly over KRW 2 trillion in operating profit for Q4, reflecting sluggish demand and intensifying competition. This compares to the KRW 13 trillion in full-year operating profit the division achieved in 2023, which helped offset semiconductor losses of KRW 14.9 trillion. However, with foldable phone sales slowing in 2024, the MX division is projected to barely exceed KRW 10 trillion in annual operating profit, underscoring the importance of the Galaxy S25 launch.\nSamsung will unveil the Galaxy S25 series on January 22 in San Jose, California, introducing advanced features such as an upgraded Bixby virtual assistant powered by a large language model (LLM). The new Bixby is expected to deliver conversational capabilities similar to OpenAI's ChatGPT or Google’s Gemini.\nThe Galaxy S25 Ultra will feature a new design with rounded corners, aligning its look with the Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus, according to German tech outlet WinFuture. Additionally, Android OS expert Mishaal Rahman reports that the series will support next-generation Qi2 wireless charging, offering improved efficiency and up to 15W power delivery using a magnetic-based system.\nAll Galaxy S25 models will use Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, abandoning Samsung’s in-house Exynos chips. This shift is expected to slightly raise prices compared to the previous generation.\nSpeculation is also mounting about a new \"Slim\" model, which could debut as the thinnest S series smartphone ever. Hints from Samsung’s teaser video for the Unpacked event have fueled such rumors, with the device potentially launching later this year.\nSamsung is also integrating subscription services into its Galaxy lineup. At CES 2025, Samsung DX head Han Jong-hee confirmed plans to introduce subscription options for Galaxy smartphones starting in February, including the S25 series. \"We aim to provide a wider range of choices with a differentiated approach,\" Han said.\nThe Galaxy S25 series marks a pivotal moment for Samsung as it seeks to reclaim momentum amid mounting competition in the smartphone market.\ngwang0e@chosunbiz.com",

    "text": "Con las Navidades finalizadas el cuerpo pide descanso y pasar tiempo en casa después de estar de arriba para abajo visitando a familiares y amigos. Planes caseros, de moverse lo más mínimo, lo justo y necesario para llegar a la puerta de la nevera y volver al salón. Y para planes tranquilos y sin gastar ni un euro, una buena peli, manta y buena compañía.\nNetflix está arrasando con los últimos estrenos y una de las más esperadas ha sido sin lugar a dudas La Sociedad de la Nieve. La historia que ya conoces sobre aquel avión uruguayo de 1972 que por desgracia se estrelló en los Andes pero con la dirección del director español Juan Antonio Bayona. Una historia de superación, supervivencia pura y dura, dejando ver el lado más primitivo del ser humano. Un éxito asegurado que, si ya has visto pero quieres más acción, te dejamos con tres películas españolas igual de emocionantes que La Sociedad de la Nieve.\nSolo\n3 películas españolas similares a La Sociedad de la Nieve\nSolo, dirigida por Hugo Stuiven y basada en hechos reales, cuenta la historia de Álvaro Vizcaíno (Alain Hernández), un surfista que en busca de la ola perfecta de Fuerteventura que se precipitó en 2014 por un acantilado en la zona más inaccesible de la isla. 48h de angustia y supervivencia en las que el protagonista repasa su vida.\nNowhere\n3 peliculas similares a La Sociedad de la Nieve\nAnna Castillo encarna a Mía, una mujer embarazada que se embarca en una aventura por error en solitario en un contenedor flotando en el mar. En un mundo catastrófico en el que los niños y mujeres embarazadas son exterminados por falta de recursos, la protagonista en un intento de huida acaba sola a la espera de dar a luz. Una película de Albert Pintó.\nLo Imposible\n3 peliculas similares a La sociedad de la nieve\nLa tercera en la lista firmada por el mismo director de La Sociedad de la Nieve, J.A. Bayona. El exitazo de 2012, cuenta el catastrófico tsunami de 2004 que arrasó con Tailandia. Protagonizada por Naomi Watts, Ewan McGregor y un jovencísimo Tom Holland cuenta la historia de una familia arrasada como tantas.",
