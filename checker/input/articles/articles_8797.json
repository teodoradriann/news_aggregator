First pitch from Yankee Stadium is scheduled for 7:05 p.m. ET (TBS). Let's analyze [FanDuel Sportsbook's](https://wlfanduel.adsrv.eacdn.com/C.ashx?btag=a_27628b_2436c_&affid=11104&siteid=27628&adid=2436&c=) lines around the Astros vs. Yankeesodds and make our expert [MLB picks and predictions](https://sportsbookwire.usatoday.com/category/mlb-odds-lines-spreads-picks-predictions/) for the best bets. Season series: Yankees lead 4-0 Houston got off to an awful start this season, one jumpstarted by the Astros getting swept at home by New York in a season-opening 4-game set. They had gone 5-1 from April 27-May 3 but then dropped back-to-back games to the Seattle Mariners Saturday and Sunday. The Yankees are coming off a weekend sweep of the Detroit Tigers. Despite some intermittent slumps of late, New York is 6-3 with a plus-19 run differential since April 27. Astros at Yankees projected starters RHP Justin Verlander vs. RHP Luis Gil Verlander (1-0, 2.08 ERA) is tabbed for his 4th start. He has a 1.15 WHIP, 3.6 BB/9 and 6.8 K/9 in 17 1/3 innings. - Last outing: No-decision, 7 IP, 2 ER, 6 H, 3 BB, 2 K in 3-2 loss vs. Cleveland Guardians Wednesday - Career vs. Yankees: 10-9, 3.41 ERA (171 1/3 IP, 65 ER), 160 H, 50 BB, 157 K in 27 starts Gil (2-1, 3.19 ERA) is making his 7th start.

Gil's control is too much of an issue to make him a likable play against a good Houston offense that does not strike out much. Dating back to last season, the Astros have lost 7 in a row to New York. All 7 of those games have been in Houston; the Astros took 2 of 3 from the Yankees last time they were in the Bronx (Aug. 4-6). Per ESPN, current New York batters own an aggregate .558 OPS against Verlander. The veteran righty is backed by an Astros relief corps that got a much-needed off day Monday. And figure those bullpens -- a New York strength and Houston weakness on paper -- as being way more even in talent and in analytical production. BACK THE ASTROS (+100). [Run line/Against the spread](https://sportsbookwire.usatoday.com/2019/07/12/sports-betting-101-betting-the-spread/) Better relative value can be found on the ML: PASS. [Over/Under](https://sportsbookwire.usatoday.com/2019/07/11/betting-101-the-over-under/) The Under went 3-0-1 in the earlier series in Houston. Look for some pushback by the bats in this one. There is some fade-Yankees-pitching lean snowballing with play-the-Astros-offense lean. TAKE THE OVER 8 (-115). Play our free daily [Pick’em Challenge](https://dailyticket.usatoday.com/) and win!

    "text": "Kampala, Uganda | THE INDEPENDENT | The Uganda Muslim Supreme Council (UMSC) National Chairperson has suspended Deputy Mufti Sheikh Abdallah Ssemambo following a petition endorsed by 15 members of the national executive committee. The suspension, effective immediately, requires Ssemambo to receive only half his salary until the impeachment process concludes. “Be notified that the Chairperson of the UMSC has received a petition of impeachment against you under Article 11(1) of the UMSC this 22nd Day of December 2023. The Petitioners fault you for conducting yourself in a manner unbefitting of your office and abrogating the constitution of UMSC contrary to Article 5(14) of the said constitution”, reads the December 22 letter signed by Prof. Muhammad Kisambira Lubega, the UMSC National Chairperson. It adds that “be further informed that you are required to file and serve on the Chairperson in triplicate a written reply within seven working days from the date of receipt of the petition.” According to the suspension letter, the UMSC joint session comprising the National Executive Committee and College of Imminent Sheikhs will meet after seven days to hear the accusations against Sheikh Ssemambo. During his suspension, Ssemambo is barred from his office and required to surrender all official UMSC items in his possession. Ley by Mahmood Katerega, the petitioners present three grounds for impeachment. They accuse Ssemambo of participating in irregular proceedings that saw him sworn in as Acting Mufti of Uganda, disregarding the UMSC constitution, and his involvement in the purported suspension of the substantial Mufti of Uganda, Sheikh Shaban Ramadhan Mubaje and UMSC Chairperson. This development arises amid a crisis within the UMSC related to the failed sale of Ssembabule Muslim land to businessman Justus Kyabahwa. Ssemambo couldn’t be reached for comment by the time of publishing this story. **",

We weren’t good enough today.”\nThis was our 26th home game of 2023, and just our third defeat, and the skipper added that the team were disappointed not to round off the year on a high in front of our own supporter.\n“It’s a tough one. We always want to give the fans a good performance, we always want to win. It was the last home game of the year so we wanted to finish off in style, but today wasn’t the day and we have to look at ourselves and we have to learn and move on.\n“It’s another game in a very short time so it’s no time to feel sorry for ourselves, we have to move on and learn.”\nCopyright 2023 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.

    "text": "Fota Wildlife Park has announced the arrival of three endangered Asiatic lion cubs – the first lion births at the park since 2019.\nThe cubs were born to mother Arya, a six-year-old lion who was part of the first cub litter to be born at Fota and who recently returned from Helsinki Zoo.\nShe was paired with the male lion Yali, who is the most genetically significant Asiatic lion in the European Breeding Programme.\nThe cubs were born on June 5th, with Yali present for the birth. Lead ranger Julien Fonteneau said: “We are overjoyed with the birth of Arya's cubs.\n“Arya and Yali’s cubs are not just vital to our breeding programme but also to the global efforts in preserving the Asiatic lion population.\n“In a first for Fota Wildlife Park, Yali was present at the birth of his three cubs, normally the male lions would not attend the birth of their young. One of our team members here quipped that Yali is a very modern father!”\nThe International Union of Conservation of Nature classes the Asiatic lion as endangered, with the species found in only one remaining site in the world, the Gir Forest in India. The population there is estimated to be about 500 to 600 lions.\nThe birth of the cubs brings the number of Asiatic lions in Fota to seven. Fonteneau said: “Arya’s journey has been remarkable. Born and raised at Fota Wildlife Park, she spent a few years at Helsinki Zoo, but was eventually ousted by the other lionesses.\n“Earlier this year, Arya returned to her roots at Fota to live with her mother, Gira, and her aunt, Gita. Now, she has continued the lineage of Asiatic lions at Fota Wildlife Park. Her mate, Yali, who joined Fota in the summer of 2022, is a crucial figure in the European Breeding Programme due to the rarity of his DNA.”\nFota Wildlife Park is calling on the public to help name the three male cubs – with annual Conservation passes up for grabs for the winners.

    "title": "Palestine Support Ban: Azadi Stadium Controversy 🇵🇸⚽️",
    "text": "The Growing Political Pitch: How Football is Becoming a Battleground for Global Conflicts Over 85 stadiums in 23 countries have witnessed a powerful, unified message: “Show a Red Card to Israel.” This grassroots campaign, born from the anguish over the conflict in Gaza, demonstrates a seismic shift – the increasing politicization of football, and a willingness among fans to risk sanction for their beliefs. But the recent removal of Palestinian flags from an Iran-North Korea match reveals a complex tension: even where public sentiment strongly aligns with the Palestinian cause, authorities are increasingly pressured to enforce neutrality, raising questions about the future of political expression in the sport.\nFrom Scottish Stadiums to Global Movement: The Rise of Football Activism The trend didn’t emerge overnight. Celtic FC fans in Scotland were early adopters, prominently displaying Palestinian flags during their Champions League match against Atletico Madrid last season. This act of solidarity resulted in a $19,000 UEFA fine, a penalty the fans swiftly and impressively overturned, raising over $150,000 to cover the fine and donate the remainder to Gaza aid. This response wasn’t simply defiance; it was a demonstration of the power of collective action and a signal to governing bodies that fans are willing to bear financial consequences for their convictions.\nSimilar displays of support have sprung up across Europe – in England, Italy, France, and the United States – often driven by fans with no direct religious or cultural connection to the conflict. This highlights a growing sense of global citizenship and a willingness to leverage the massive platform of football to advocate for human rights. The willingness of figures like Pep Guardiola to publicly acknowledge the “heartbreaking” situation in Gaza further legitimizes this trend, demonstrating that even at the highest levels of the sport, the conflict is impossible to ignore.\nIran’s Dilemma: Balancing National Identity and FIFA Regulations However, the situation in Iran presents a stark contrast. The removal of Palestinian flags during the match against North Korea, following a warning from a FIFA observer, underscores the pressure on the Iranian Football Federation to adhere to FIFA’s neutrality rules. This action has been widely criticized within Iran, with some viewing it as a betrayal of the nation’s long-standing support for the Palestinian cause and a concerning step towards secularization within the sport. The core issue isn’t simply about following the rules; it’s about the perception of prioritizing international regulations over deeply held national values.\nThis incident raises a crucial question: can football truly remain apolitical in a world increasingly defined by political polarization? FIFA’s stance, while intended to maintain neutrality, is increasingly seen as a silencing of legitimate expressions of solidarity and a protection of the status quo. The enforcement of these rules, particularly in nations with strong historical and cultural ties to the conflict, is likely to become a flashpoint for further tension.\nThe Future of Football and Political Protest: A Three-Pronged Forecast Looking ahead, we can anticipate three key developments:\nIncreased Fan Activism & Creative Protest: Expect to see fans become more inventive in their displays of support, moving beyond flags to incorporate banners, coordinated chants, and even pre-match demonstrations. The focus will likely shift towards finding loopholes in regulations and utilizing the power of social media to amplify their message. Growing Pressure on Governing Bodies: FIFA and UEFA will face mounting pressure from fans, players, and even governments to reconsider their strict neutrality policies. The debate will center on the balance between maintaining the integrity of the game and allowing for legitimate expressions of political and social conscience. Geopolitical Fragmentation of Football: We may see a divergence in approaches between different regions. Nations with strong political stances on the conflict may be less willing to enforce strict neutrality, potentially leading to friction with international governing bodies and even the emergence of alternative football structures. The Stakes are Higher Than Ever The events unfolding on the pitch are a microcosm of the broader geopolitical landscape. The increasing politicization of football isn’t simply a trend; it’s a reflection of a world where individuals are increasingly demanding that their values be reflected in all aspects of their lives, including the sports they love. The Iranian case serves as a cautionary tale – a reminder that suppressing legitimate expressions of solidarity can be more damaging than allowing them to flourish. As the conflict in Gaza continues, and global tensions remain high, the political pitch will undoubtedly become an even more contested battleground. Human Rights Watch provides ongoing coverage of the situation in Gaza.\nWhat role do you think football should play in addressing global conflicts? Share your thoughts in the comments below!",

    "text": "TRACY, Calif. -- Facebook and Instagram users have long complained there is no way to get help when hackers take over their accounts. There is no phone number to call, and online help pages lead them in circles. But, as we've reported, parent company Meta is now offering a paid-subscription service for personal customer care. And victims are willing to pay. So, is the problem fixed? RELATED: Facebook wouldn't remove hacker from Bay Area woman's account -- until she paid Meta for help 7 On Your Side aired a story recently about an East Bay woman who tried for months to recover her stolen Facebook account. Nothing worked until she signed up for \"Meta Verified.\" She got her account back within a day. However, since then, we've learned not everyone is so lucky. We told you about Tova Ridgway who tried for months to recover her stolen Facebook account. She even marched to Meta headquarters in Menlo Park demanding help. Nothing worked -- until she paid $14.99 for one month of \"Meta Verified,'' giving her direct access to customer service. MORE: Hacker controls CA man's Facebook account, scams his friends; why Meta didn't stop it Within a day, a live agent on chat restored her account. \"I got all my memories back. My memories of my kid, me and my husband,\" Ridgway said. Daniel Gomez of Tracy lost his Facebook account back in August, and he couldn't get it back either. \"She got help. I was like, 'What the heck? How come it didn't help in my situation?'\" Gomez said of Ridgway. \"I lost all my family photo albums. A lot of important stuff was on there,\" he said. MORE: Angry CA drivers say DMV lookalike website 'NeedTags' tricks them to paying extra fees Facebook's automated help pages kept sending him in circles back to the error message. So, he paid $14.99 for one month of Meta Verified. But his case wasn't so simple. Hackers had used Gomez's Facebook profile to set up a fake Instagram account. Meta suspended the fake account and, in turn, suspended Gomez too. \"I'm here to tell you, Meta Verified does not always work,\" he said. After nearly two dozen live chats with Meta Verified, he still got the same error message. So, he paid for a second month, then a third. MORE: CA insurance commissioner responds to criticism over lack of transparency, accountability \"They can't solve anything too complicated. Maybe my issue is too complicated. Yeah, but it definitely didn't work for me after multiple attempts,\" Gomez said. In the latest chat, an agent typed: \"Hi Danny thank you for contacting the Meta pro team. May I confirm you are calling about bullying?\" \"I don't think they understood what's happening,\" Gomez said. Gomez replied: \"No, not bullying. My Facebook account was hacked and suspended.\" The agent typed: \"Thank you for confirming your phone number and bringing this concern to our attention. We duly understand how important this is for you.\" MORE: Video shows Bay Area USPS driver crashing into parked car, then driving off \"It feels like you're talking to a robot. it doesn't feel human at all. It feels like AI,\" Gomez said. Was he chatting with a bot or a human? He wasn't sure, but the next message said: \"The best way to submit an appeal for your account being hacked is at Facebook.com.\" So it sent him back to the useless automated help page. \"They're basically saying, solve this yourself. I'm paying money to get nothing,\" Gomez said. The next message said: \"May I confirm that I was able to answer all your questions for today?\" MORE: Bay Area man out $3.2K after IRS check stolen, cashed by thief using Wells Fargo ATM He replied: \"Yeah, but it didn't help at all.\" The agent typed: \"It's been a pleasure having you today. This case will now be closed... Have a great and beautiful day.\" We found many reports online and to 7 On Your Side from users saying the service couldn't restore their accounts. We asked Meta for comment but did not hear back. MORE: Consumers upset 400+ SF retailers don't give cash back for recycling. Here's why But in a blog post announcing the service, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote: \"Verifying government IDs and providing direct access to customer support costs a significant amount of money. Subscription fees will cover this and will pace how many people sign up, so we'll be able to ensure quality...\" Gomez says he did get something out of this: verified status for his Instagram. \"Basically, I got a blue checkmark and that's about it,\" he said. From what we saw on his chats, Gomez was getting responses from humans and bots, so the experience wasn't quite as personalized as you might want. The best solution is to use two-factor authentication to prevent a hack in the first place. In a response, Meta told ABC7 News that it wants to look into the cases we've discovered.

    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Edgecombe County, North Carolina from 1901-2000 was 42.1. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Edgecombe County, North Carolina experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Edgecombe County, North Carolina history.",
