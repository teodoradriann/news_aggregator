    "title": "Why the Decorative Arts are essential for our world (Photos)",
    "text": "Recently, my daughter painted an image of [Our Lady of Walsingham ](https://www.walsingham.org.uk/history/)onto a piece of silk. A woman from our parish took the image and sewed it onto a decorated banner so our parish girls could carry it during a May Crowning procession. On the day of the Crowning, the girls all arrived dressed in their fanciest white dresses, hands full of fresh flowers, and proudly took their place in the procession with their new banner. They’d had spent months memorizing and learning to sing Marian hymns such as the Salve Regina, and as we marched, they joined in the singing with enthusiasm. (You can view a PHOTO GALLERY of the May Crowning at the end of this article.) From the look on their faces, I could tell that they were genuinely pleased to be able to participate in something so beautiful and to have been given such an important role in a parish devotion. The girls who participated are all school age, but their work and the liturgy to which they added so much were not childish or low-quality. Their efforts weren’t the sort of thing happy parents gush over while everyone else simply endures until it’s over. What they accomplished was really quite amazing. Over the past year, the girls have been meeting a few times per month to learn what we might refer to as the Decorative Arts. They’ve sewed vestments for priests, made linens for the altar, worked on flower arrangements for the altar, made banners, practiced singing, and crafted all sorts of beautiful devotional items for their homes. They’re amateurs in their chosen arts, yes, but they’re learning quickly. Their contributions to the parish and their homes have already been quite remarkable. The lost art of decorating I’m not sure even many adults currently have the skills to accomplish what those girls did. In our modern era of big box stores and mass-produced factory goods, the Decorative Arts have fallen by the wayside. Many of the skills that were once common have become far less so. It used to be that almost everyone had experience in some craft or other – woodworking, painting, masonry, sewing, embroidery, singing, glasswork, metalwork, and so on. But today, the decoration of local churches is often delegated to large companies who manufacture banners, paintings, rosaries, statues, and all manner of other devotional items. What I notice about these mass-produced items for use in churches is that the quality is lower than with handmade items. The designs are also more generic. After all, those companies must make a profit. That means they must be efficient. They have to sell a design to as large an audience as possible, so the designs tend to be lowest-common-denominator stuff. I cannot say how many churches I’ve been in that display the same bland banners. The value of local artistry The best vestments, in my opinion, are always made by a local Catholic who has worked hard to gain the knowledge and skill required. These locals are crafting their contributions out of love. They love God and also love the local parish with all its unique history and customs. All the best rosaries are handmade. Flowers that are handpicked and donated from local gardens make the best decorations for shrines. And the best altar frontals are always sewed by parishioners. What holds true for the parish also holds true for our homes. My favorite decorations in our home were made by my children, not purchased from a big box store. I love to frame their artwork and I love the flower arrangements they make from plants that they’ve picked in our yard. Our garden is lovely because my wife uses her expanding knowledge of plants to keep it vibrant. In the evenings, I prefer to sit at the piano and make my own music rather than stream a pre-made playlist via the internet. Are our efforts professional? No, but for us there is no substitute. Decorative Arts vs. Fine Arts The reason the Decorative Arts have now been delegated to professionals is because the required skills have languished. Fewer people learn the skills required and it takes great effort to recover them. I wonder if the reason is because we’re intimidated. We are confusing the Decorative Arts with the Fine Arts. There will always be a need for the Fine Arts, of course — artistic creations meant for a public space, concert hall, or museum. We need highly trained professional artists to paint the finely wrought images of saints with which we beautify our spaces. Architects are needed to ensure our buildings meets code. Sacred music can’t be properly performed without professional organists who thoroughly understand not only their instruments, but the deep tradition of sacred music. The Fine Arts will always be with us. They require rare talent, along with the training to bring that talent to fruition. Not just anyone can fill these roles. We would end up with bad results were we to delegate the Fine Arts to amateurs. Anyone can become a decorative artist But anyone (and I mean absolutely anyone) willing to invest enough patience and effort can acquire mastery in a Decorative Art. We don’t need to be endowed with natural genius and trained in professional art schools in order to make beautiful things. I’ve seen neighborhood yards bursting with flowers, girls who have taught themselves to sew and made amazing dresses for themselves, and amateur singers who have joined the parish choir and improved tremendously. All it takes to recover the Decorative Arts is a willingness to put in the effort. Look, I don’t want to be the guy who goes on the internet and bemoans the uglification of our culture. All of us already know that our culture has devolved. Personally, I don’t know if Taylor Swift and current teen fashion and Instagram are all that much worse than what I grew up with in the 80s — but if we compare this era’s culture to the Victorian or medieval eras, it seems pretty obvious that art, architecture, churches, and music are all worse. It’s not because those eras had better artists available than we have today. Rather, it’s because of the value they placed in the Decorative Arts. They viewed those arts as an expression of their love for their local place, their parish and neighborhood. We make beauty because we are made for beauty The pursuit of pure efficiency at the cost of neglecting beauty isn’t a path to human thriving. We are made for beauty. It isn’t enough to make an efficient, plain building or item and then slap a few professionally made decorations on the surfaces in order to dress it up. Beauty needs to be the very idea of the thing. We are crafting beauty into the usefulness of every item in an organic, symbiotic relationship. Human beings delight in beauty, which is an expression of joy and freedom to create alongside God’s creativity. It’s a way of recognizing how good God’s creation really is, while striving to bring to it a little more goodness. The Decorative Arts are how happy, ordinary people create beautiful things. So let this be an encouragement to you to put in the practice, master a Decorative Art, be creative, and value the gifts each of us has been given. ☩ View the PHOTO GALLERY below to see more of the May Crowning procession mentioned in the article.",

    "text": "Man killed in El Paso is SWLA native, family says\nEL PASO, Texas (KPLC) - El Paso police are investigating a homicide near Fort Bliss, a Texas military base, and a Southwest Louisiana family identified the victim as a Sulphur native.\nKameryn LeBert, of Sulphur, said the victim is her brother, Larry Donnell Lacey III, 23. He lived in El Paso at the time of his death.\nThe El Paso Police Department announced in a news release that officers discovered a dead man in a home on the 4000 block of Fillmore Avenue after responding to a welfare check on Wednesday, April 2. Police described the death as “suspicious” but did not give more details.\n7News contacted an El Paso Police Department spokesman, who said he could not provide more information or confirm if Lacey was the victim.\nLacey was raised in Sulphur until he was 17, when he was placed in foster care, LeBert said. He graduated from high school in Baton Rouge and entered the military upon graduation.\n“He was a very special person,” LeBert said. “I know a lot of people probably say that about their loved ones, but he definitely was. He could make anyone smile or laugh. He was very determined in everything he did, and he had big dreams and big plans for his future, and I know he was very excited to become a dad.”\nLeBert said Lacey’s son is to be born within the next month.\nShe believes Lacey had a kind heart, and it may have led to his death.\nShe said the family has suspicions about what happened as Lacey was expecting a visit from a friend on Sunday, March 30. That’s the last day LeBert says family spoke with Lacey.\nThe victim’s family is now desperately searching for answers.\n“We are hoping for justice and seeking justice,” LeBert said. “If anything, we want to get his face out there and his actual story. I feel like right now he’s just being labeled as the seventh murder of 2025.”\nA\nGoFundMe has been created to help with funeral expenses.\nCopyright 2025 KPLC. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "Japan sweltered through its hottest July since records began 126 years ago, the weather agency said, as extreme heatwaves fuelled by climate change engulfed many parts of the globe. Temperatures in the country were 2.16 degrees Celsius higher than average, breaking last year's record for July of 1.91 degrees Celsius above average. \"It was the highest since statistics began in 1898,\" the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) said Thursday, noting that the figures were \"considerably higher\" nationwide. Of 153 observation posts across Japan, 62 broke their average temperature record in July. Contributing factors included a high-pressure system over the Pacific and \"warm air from the south\" that shrouded northern parts of the archipelago, the JMA said. Since April, heatstroke has killed 59 people in Japan, according to the disaster management agency. Parasols and chunky necklaces that can be stored in the freezer have been a common sight around Tokyo, where street performer Jiro Kan, 56, told AFP he was feeling the heat. \"After spending two hours standing here, I get so sweaty I can literally squeeze it all out from my shirt. I'm drenched,\" said Kan, dressed in an all-yellow suit. \"People who are used to a more dry type of heat like in the United States find the heat and humidity in Japan more difficult to handle,\" he said in tourist hotspot Asakusa. Last month, Shizuoka west of Tokyo became the first Japanese region to see the mercury reach 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) this year -- far surpassing the 35-degree threshold deemed \"extremely hot\" by authorities. Heatwaves are becoming increasingly common across the globe, with the European Union's climate monitor saying in July that the Earth experienced its warmest day in recorded history.",

    "text": "El sacerdote nicaragüense Fernando Calero fue detenido por la Policía, con lo que suman tres los curas encarcelados en las últimas 24 horas, denunció este viernes la abogada e investigadora nicaragüense exiliada Martha Patricia Molina. “Policía sandinista secuestra al sacerdote Fernando Calero, párroco de Nuestra Señora de Fátima (en el municipio de) Rancho Grande, (departamento de Matagalpa). Se desconoce su paradero”, señaló Molina, autora del estudio titulado ‘Nicaragua: ¿Una Iglesia perseguida?’, a través de su cuenta de la red social X (antes Twitter). Según la investigadora, Calero fue “secuestrado por la Policía Nacional en su parroquia” tras haber mencionado al obispo encarcelado Rolando Álvarez, quien preside la Diócesis de Matagalpa, en una misa. “No existe una acusación formal en contra de él y no se tiene información de su paradero”, explicó. Calero se suma a los sacerdotes Carlos Avilés y Héctor Treminio, vicario general y tesorero de la Arquidiócesis de Managua, respectivamente, que fueron detenidos el jueves por la Policía y civiles. La semana pasada, las autoridades detuvieron al obispo Isidoro Mora, a dos sacerdotes y a dos seminaristas. Ni el Gobierno ni la Policía Nacional han confirmado o negado la presunta detención de los religiosos. El cardenal nicaragüense y arzobispo de Managua, Leopoldo Brenes, aún no se pronuncia sobre esos arrestos. Quien sí lo hizo fue el exiliado obispo auxiliar de Managua, Silvio Báez, a quien el papa Francisco ordenó dejar Nicaragua en 2019 por motivos de seguridad, quien se declaró indignado por los encarcelamientos de tres sacerdotes de la Arquidiócesis de Managua. Dos obispos, cinco sacerdotes y dos seminaristas presos En el caso de Mora, obispo de la Diócesis de Siuna, en el Caribe de Nicaragua, fue arrestado un día después de mencionar en una homilía al obispo Rolando Álvarez, condenado en febrero pasado a más de 26 años de prisión por delitos considerados traición a la patria tras negarse a abandonar su país. Mora es el segundo obispo detenido en Nicaragua. El primero fue Álvarez, quien el 10 de febrero pasado fue condenado a 26 años y 4 meses de prisión, despojado de su nacionalidad, y suspendidos sus derechos ciudadanos de por vida por delitos considerados traición a la patria. Esa condena fue dictada un día después de que Álvarez rechazó subirse a un avión que lo iba a llevar, junto con otros 222 excarcelados políticos nicaragüenses, hacia Estados Unidos, lo que provocó la indignación del presidente Ortega, quien en una cadena nacional lo calificó de “soberbio”, “desquiciado” y “energúmeno”. Las relaciones del Gobierno de Daniel Ortega y la Iglesia católica viven momentos de gran tensión, marcadas por la expulsión y encarcelamiento de sacerdotes, la prohibición de actividades religiosas y la suspensión de sus relaciones diplomáticas. El Gobierno de Nicaragua excarceló en octubre pasado a 12 sacerdotes y los envió al Vaticano, aunque entre esos religiosos no se encontraba el obispo Álvarez. Nicaragua atraviesa una crisis desde abril de 2018, que se ha acentuado tras las elecciones de noviembre de 2021, en las que Ortega fue reelegido para un quinto mandato, cuarto consecutivo y segundo junto a su esposa, Rosario Murillo, como vicepresidenta, con sus principales contendientes en prisión.

    "text": "According to [ nme.com](https://www.nme.com/news/music/childish-gambino-accused-of-mistreating-awaken-my-love-cover-team-3563708), artist [Childish Gambino ](https://music.mxdwn.com/2021/05/06/news/florida-rapper-kidd-wes-sues-childish-gambino-for-alleged-copyright-infringement-for-this-is-america/)has been accused of alleged mistreatment by the people who allegedly worked on the artwork of Gambino’s alleged album Awaken, My Love!, including the woman who allegedly appears on the alleged album cover. Giannina Antonette Oteto allegedly appeared on the cover of [Gambino](https://music.mxdwn.com/2020/03/22/news/donald-glover-officially-releases-new-album-3-15-2020-as-both-childish-gambino-and-donald-glover-presents/)’s 2016 album wearing a beaded headdress and the model alleged in a statement that she, the stylist and makeup artist were allegedly “[taken] advantage of and lied to,” which allegedly points to Oteto not being allegedly being paid in full for her work. “Being able to hold an album that I’m on the cover of. And having my bestie mom next to me to celebrate! My number 1 cheerleader! This album has been so hard for me to celebrate for many reasons, and for years I resented it even. It put me through a lot but finally being able to celebrate it means a lot! said Oteto. Model Giannina Antonette Oteto from Childish Gambino’s “Awaken, My Love!” album cover says he took advantage of her: “myself, the makeup artist, and stylist (all black women) were [taken] advantage of and lied to. We received low pay but were promised residuals but never… [pic.twitter.com/rIljdoy8RZ] — Pop Crave (@PopCrave) [December 27, 2023] Oteto adds: “We received low pay. [They] promised residuals. But [we] never received anything. The only person who received residuals was a white woman who created the headpiece even though she was not on set to work on this (but she also deserves it). After years of lies and silence then finding out statute of limitation complications… it’s been an exhausting, emotional, and overall sad thing to deal with. So it took so much from me especially the fact that we all worked on it with so much love and being proud to represent black artists.”",
