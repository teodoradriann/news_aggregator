    "title": "Justice Dept. says it will sue Texas over immigration law - The Washington Post",
    "text": "The Justice Department warned Texas on Thursday that it plans to sue over a new state law that would allow local police to make immigration arrests — the latest flash point in the nation’s political and policy battles over border policy and illegal immigration. Abbott said the statute will “help stop the tidal wave of illegal entry into Texas, add additional funding to build more border wall and crack down on human smuggling.” Federal courts, however, have long held that immigration enforcement is the responsibility of the federal government, not state or local authorities — a view that the Supreme Court upheld when it struck down parts of an Arizona law in 2012. In the letter sent Thursday to Abbott, senior Justice Department official Brian Boynton said that if Texas implements the law when it is due to take effect in March, doing so would violate the Constitution. Because the law “is unconstitutional and will disrupt the federal government’s operations, we request that Texas forbear in its enforcement,” Boynton wrote. He said the department “intends to file suit to enjoin the enforcement of SB 4 unless Texas agrees to refrain from enforcing the law. The United States is committed to both securing the border and ensuring the processing of noncitizens. The Texas law, Boynton’s letter said, “is contrary to these goals.” He gave Texas a deadline of Wednesday to respond to the warning. Immigration policy has long been a flash point between Republicans and Democrats, and Congress has tried and failed for years to address the issue. President Donald Trump , a Republican, made cracking down on illegal immigration a central focus of his administration and has vowed to do so again if reelected in 2024. Civil rights groups filed their own lawsuit over the Texas law last week. The issue shows the degree to which immigration — long considered a national political issue — is increasingly a subject of debate within border states, which are overwhelmed with new arrivals, as well as states much farther north, where busloads of migrants have arrived needing assistance. There were more than 2 million illegal crossings at the southwest border with Mexico for each of the past two fiscal years, according to data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Border crossings have surged in the second half of the year since dropping sharply in June, with migrants from around the globe entering from Mexico to seek asylum, economic opportunities or a new life in the United States. Thursday’s letter is the latest jab in a series of fights over immigration between Texas and the Biden administration. The Republican-run state is already embroiled in a court battle with the Justice Department over razor-wire border fencing installed by Texas officials. The record surge in border crossings has reverberated across the country, with Democratic-led cities such as New York, Washington and Chicago struggling to address the needs of tens of thousands of new arrivals. On multiple days this month, U.S. Customs and Border Protection has reported more than 10,000 daily encounters with migrants who entered illegally. The agency last week closed vital commercial rail crossings in El Paso and Eagle Pass, Tex., after thousands of migrants traveling on freight trains to the U.S. border waded across the Rio Grande en masse. CBP also has shut down a busy pedestrian crossing near San Diego and other border checkpoints , saying it needs its officers to help overwhelmed U.S. Border Patrol agents. Republicans, and Abbott in particular, have faulted the Biden administration for the influx of migrants and claim the new law is necessary to do what the federal government has not. “President Biden has repeatedly refused to enforce federal immigration laws already on the books and do his job to secure the border,” Abbott said in a statement earlier this month, vowing to take the fight “all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary.” On Wednesday, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met in the Mexican capital and agreed to form a working group to jointly confront the record numbers of undocumented immigrants arriving at the southern U.S. border. López Obrador said in a statement posted on social media that “important agreements were achieved.”",

Ask the Syrians, they will tell you.\nAnd since October 8th, Hezbollah fired 9,000 missiles at the people of Israel, expelling 70,000 from their homes.\nIsrael, a small nation of 9 million, has taken a stand against barbarism. Its young soldiers are on the front lines in a battle that once would have united Western coalitions. Yet today, much of the West fails to support Israel in its existential fight against groups like Hezbollah and Hamas—both backed by Tehran, which tramples its own people, and races toward a nuclear bomb.\nNo less alarming is the West’s response. In Washington, we hear calls to avoid “escalation,” while in Europe, the UK’s David Lammy just said climate change is a greater threat than terrorism. Incredibly, some have turned against Israel entirely, condemning its efforts to defend itself.\nLadies and gentlemen, this is not a battle over land; it is a battle of civilization against tyranny. Hezbollah, armed with 150,000 missiles aimed at civilians, must be stopped. To criminalize Israel’s right to self-defense, while ignoring the atrocities of its enemies, is a grave injustice.\nWe must stand with Israel. We must stand for democracy, for the rule of law, and for the right of every nation to protect its people from terror. I thank you.",

Así como lo lees, todo parece indicar que el cantante sonorense podría estar dando indicios de estar coqueteando con una mujer que evidentemente no es su nueva novia, la cantante Ángela Aguilar, y en redes sociales ya se dieron cuenta por lo que alertaron a la nieta de Flor Silvestre.

Durante la última publicación de Nodal en la que muestra su participación en la semana de la moda en París, un comentario llamó la atención de los usuarios que siguen de cerca el trabajo del sonorense, pues una joven llamada Paula Machado lo llamó “mejor amigo” y él no dudó en responder a este comentario con un corazón en llamas. Sin embargo, lo que más llama la atención es que Nodal efectivamente sigue en Instagram a esta joven, y además le ha dado like a casi todas las publicaciones que Paula ha hecho a lo largo de este año 2024, pues en 2023 no tiene likes del intérprete de “Cazzualidades”. Debido a esto es que usuarios de redes sociales no perdieron la oportunidad de pedirle a Paula que se declare “fan” de la relación de Nodal y Ángela Aguilar, pues ahora todos apoyan a esta joven, pues, han estado etiquetando a la hija de Pepe Aguilar asegurando que quedó libre la “vacante” de “la mejor amiga” y de “fan de su relación” Cabe señalar que de acuerdo con lo que se puede apreciar en las redes sociales de Paula, la joven se dedica a bailar y montar espectáculos para grandes artistas como Feid, Rihanna, Karol G y hasta con Cazzu también ha trabajado la joven quien es la “nueva mejor amiga” de Nodal. El polémico romance de Nodal y Ángela Aguilar El romance entre Ángela y Nodal ha sido tema de especulación durante semanas, con rumores que sugerían una conexión más allá de la amistad. Sin embargo, fue a través de una famosa revista donde ambos decidieron compartir públicamente su historia de amor, dejando claro que la química que los une va más allá de sus respectivas carreras en la música. El anuncio de su relación ha sido recibido con entusiasmo por parte de sus seguidores, quienes han llenado las redes sociales con mensajes de apoyo y buenos deseos para Ángela y Nodal. Muchos han destacado la naturalidad con la que ambos han compartido esta noticia, alejándose de los típicos escándalos y enfocándose en lo que realmente importa: su felicidad. Ángela, con apenas veinte años, ha cautivado al público no solo por su voz y talento, sino también por su estilo único y personalidad carismática. Por su parte, Nodal, quien ha ganado reconocimiento internacional por su música, es conocido por su genuinidad y letras que hablan de amor y desamor. La combinación de estos dos talentos no solo promete consolidar una pareja mediática, sino también una colaboración artística que podría sorprender a muchos en la industria.",

    "title": "Condenan a dos poetas rusos por participación en operación en Ucrania",
    "text": "MOSCÚ, RUSIA.-Un tribunal de Moscú condenó este jueves a penas de entre cinco años y medio y siete de cárcel a dos poetas rusos, que participaron en una lectura contra el conflicto de Ucrania, un ejemplo más de la represión presente en el país. Miles de rusos, opositores o simples ciudadanos, fueron condenados por tribunales por criticar la ofensiva en Ucrania, iniciada en febrero de 2022, a veces con penas especialmente severas. Según comprobó un periodista de AFP presente en la audiencia, los simpatizantes de Artiom Kamardin, de 33 años, y de Yegor Shtovba, de 23, gritaron “qué vergüenza” al anunciarse la decisión. “Es de una arbitrariedad absoluta”, exclamó el padre de Artiom Kamardin, Yuri. “Todo el mundo es igual ante la ley, pero algunos son más iguales que otros”, ironizó su madre, Elena. Al menos diez personas fueron detenidas por la policía delante del tribunal tras el juicio. Artiom Kamardin y Yegor Shtovba fueron detenidos en septiembre de 2022 tras participar en una lectura pública en Moscú cerca del monumento al poeta Vladimir Maiakovski, punto de cita de disidentes desde la época soviética. En esa lectura, Kamardin declamó un poema, “Mátame, miliciano”, muy hostil a los separatistas prorrusos del este de Ucrania. “Siete años por una poesía” Al día siguiente fue detenido durante un allanamiento en su domicilio, en el que afirma que fue golpeado y violado por los policías con un aparato de halterofilia. Los dos poetas fueron primero acusados de “incitación al odio”, y luego inculpados también de “llamado público a cometer actividades contra la seguridad del Estado”. “No soy un héroe, y el ir a prisión por lo que pienso nunca formó parte de mis planes”, dijo Kamardin en su alegato final ante la corte, publicado en Telegram por sus simpatizantes. El acusado pidió al juez que lo dejara “regresar a casa” y a cambio, prometió distanciarse de cualquier “tema sensible”. Su esposa, Alexandra Popova, dijo a AFP estar indignada por la pena “tan severa” que se le impuso a su marido. “Siete años por una poesía, un delito no violento...”, dijo. “Si tuviéramos unos tribunales normales, esta situación no existiría”, añadió, antes de ser llevada por la policía, junto a un amigo del poeta y dos periodistas. Según la abogada de uno de los periodistas detenidos, están acusados de “alteración del orden público” y se enfrentan a 30 días de cárcel. Shtovba, condenado a cinco años y medio, insistió durante el juicio en que no vulneró la ley. Un tercer poeta, Nikolai Daineko, detenido al mismo tiempo que los dos primeros, fue a su vez condenado a cuatro años de cárcel en mayo, según OVD-info. El Ministerio alemán de Relaciones Exteriores condenó el veredicto y lamentó que la libertad de expresión esté “sofocada” en Rusia. El poder ruso lleva años reprimiendo a las voces críticas, y la campaña se endureció desde el inicio de la ofensiva militar en Ucrania. Según OVD-Info, cerca de 20.000 personas fueron detenidas en Rusia por su oposición al conflicto de Ucrania desde febrero de 2022. La oenegé Memorial tiene contabilizados 633 prisioneros políticos entre rejas.",
