    "title": "Mean Girls (the musical) tops the box office, driven be female audience",
    "text": "Winter storms and cinema closures in North America didn’t dampen the opening weekend for “\nMean Girls. ”\nThe Paramount release, adapted from the Broadway musical and the 2004 Tina Fey movie, earned $28 million in its first three days in theaters according to studio estimates Sunday. Not accounting for inflation, that’s more than the $24.4 million the first movie made in its opening weekend.\nThe “Mean Girls” competition over the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend featured several new releases, including the Jason Statham action movie “\nThe Beekeeper ” and the Jay-Z produced biblical satire “The Book of Clarence,” in addition to a slew of awards contenders capitalizing on buzz from recent nominations and the Golden Globes.\nAs with “Barbie,” another enthusiastically pink movie, female audiences made up the vast majority (76%) of opening weekend ticket buyers for “Mean Girls.” According to exit polls, 70% were between the ages of 18 and 34, which, yes, means that it had appeal for audiences who hadn’t been born when Regina George was first introduced to the world.\n“The property is iconic,” said Chris Aronson, Paramount’s president of domestic distribution. “Tina Fey is legendary and her contemporary twist has resonated with audiences, particularly the female audience.”\nThis iteration of “Mean Girls” stars Angourie Rice, Auli’i Cravalho and\nReneé Rapp, who played Regina on stage. It was originally planned to go straight to streaming on Paramount+, but the studio pivoted after test scores were positive. Social media played a big part in getting the word out and “Mean Girls” also inspired groups of friends to go to the movies together. An estimated 40% went with two or more friends.\nFey returned to write and co-star in the new film, which was directed by Samantha Jayne and Arturo Perez Jr. and cost a reported $36 million to produce. Reviews have been more positive than not, with a 70% on Rotten Tomatoes, but audiences gave it a B CinemaScore which may not bode especially well for word-of-mouth appeal. Recent musicals like “Wonka” and “The Color Purple” scored in the A-range. The studio is optimistic after this weekend though. It also made $6.5 million from 16 international markets.\n“It’s no secret that the release calendar is a little light for the first couple months of the year and because of the reception to this film we stand a chance of broadening this audience,” Aronson said. “It really is a crowd-pleaser.”\nAmazon and MGM’s “The Beekeeper” debuted in second place with an estimated $16.8 million from 3,303 theaters. Men made up approximately 62% of ticket buyers and audiences overall gave it a B+ CinemaScore. By the end of the four-day weekend, the studio expects it to have made $19.1 million. Miramax handled the international distribution for “The Beekeper,” which also grossed $20.4 million from 49 territories.\nThird place went to “Wonka,” which added $8.4 million in its fifth weekend. The Timothée Chalamet-led musical has now made over $178 million domestically and $500 million globally.\n“Musicals are on a roll,” said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. “It seems like a lot of studios run away from putting musical on their films for fear of limiting their audience pool, but I think this is a genre Hollywood should embrace and highlight.”\nThe Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell romantic comedy “Anyone But You,” a Sony release, is turning into a bit of a sleeper success as well, making nearly $7 million in its fourth weekend. By Monday, its domestic total should be around $56.5 million. Universal and Illumination’s “Migration” rounded out the top five with $6.2 million in its fourth weekend.\nNot everything landed this weekend, though. “\nThe Book of Clarence,” a faith-based comedy/drama with a starry, ensemble cast including LaKeith Stanfield, Omar Sy, RJ Cyler, David Oyelowo, Alfre Woodard and Teyana Taylor is not off to a promising start. The Legendary Pictures release opened to an estimated $2.6 million from just over 2,000 locations.\nWritten and directed by the British singer-songwriter Jeymes Samuel (stage name The Bullitts), it was self-consciously styled after Golden Age biblical epics like “The Ten Commandments.” It has also gotten mixed reviews, with 68% on Rotten Tomatoes and a B CinemaScore.\nThe Walt Disney Co. sent its 2020 Pixar film “Soul” to movie theaters this weekend as well, where it made $429,000 from 1350 locations in North America. It’s the first of several Pixar movies, including “Luca” and “Turning Red,” that Disney is bringing to theaters this winter after all had streaming-only releases on Disney+ during the pandemic.\nHollywood’s awards season is also in full swing, and though many top contenders are already available to watch at home, some are still rolling out in theaters and hoping to capitalize on new nominations and awards shows like last weekend’s Golden Globes. “Poor Things,” which was a big winner, added $1.8 million from only 580 theaters. “All of Us Strangers” took in $474,000 from 120 screens. “American Fiction” expanded nationwide and made $1.9 million from 625 screens. “The Zone of Interest,” playing on 25 screens, also crossed $1 million.\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Tuesday.\n1. “Mean Girls,” $28 million.\n2. “The Beekeeper,” $16.8 million.\n3. “Wonka,” $8.4 million.\n4. “Anyone But You,” $6.9 million.\n5. “Migration,” $6.2 million.\n6. “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,” $5.3 million.\n7. “Night Swim,” $4.7 million.\n8. “The Boys in the Boat,” $3.5 million.\n9. “The Book of Clarence,”$2.6 million.\n10. “The Iron Claw,” $2.4 million.",

    "title": "New body cam video shows moment police officer saw Trump shooter just before assassination attempt | National | wkow.com",
    "text": "(CNN) — Dramatic video obtained by CNN shows, for the first time, the moment a police officer climbed up to the roof of a building overlooking the Donald Trump rally on July 13 and saw the former president’s would-be assassin just before the shooting began. Other footage from the rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, which CNN obtained through a public records request, shows local officers lamenting that they told Secret Service to post officers near the building the gunman fired from days earlier. A video from the Butler police officer’s body-worn camera shows how the officer was hoisted up by his colleague onto the roof, quickly dropping down after he sees the shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks. Approximately 40 seconds later, Crooks turned back and fired eight shots at Trump, who was hit in the ear. Seconds later, a Secret Service sniper shot and killed Crooks. After the encounter, the officer runs around to another side of the building before running to his police car to retrieve a rifle. “F**king this close bro,” the officer who saw Crooks says to another officer. “Dude, he turned around on me.” One officer asks where the shooter is and the officer, panting, says, “He’s straight up.” “Who’s got eyes on him?” the officer asks. “He was right where you picked me up, bro. He was on that left side.” Over the radio a voice says: “We have two civilians – tending to them,” and later, “I need an ambulance in the back.” This video was released by Butler Township Police Department in response to CNN’s public records request that asked for any body-camera video or dash-camera video involving Butler Township officers or personnel related to the rally and shooting at Butler Farm Show on July 13. The township initially declined to release the content but did after CNN appealed. ‘Don’t put up your head - he’s right there’ On the dashboard camera of the officer who came face-to-face with Crooks, three shots can be heard ringing out, followed by five more shots fired in rapid succession. “Don’t put up your head – he’s right there!” the officer shouts to others after opening his car half a minute after the shots were fired. Shortly after, video shows law enforcement officers attempting to access the roof. “He’s got glasses, long hair,” the officer who saw Crooks tells several others climbing up the side of the building. “Yo, Mike, I climbed the wall and I popped my head right in front of him bro, he’s got a book bag, he’s got mad sh*t, AR laying down.” “But watch out because he can f**king come right down on you over there,” the officer warns. The officer adds later: “Before you m*therf**kers came up here I popped my head up there like an idiot, by myself, dude. He turned around, I f**king dropped.” When they ultimately access the top of the building, footage shows Crooks’ lifeless body, his rifle and a trail of blood running down the side of the roof. Officers say they asked for Secret Service help earlier that week In a separate video released by the Butler police, one officer can be heard telling colleagues about 10 minutes after the shooting that he had told Secret Service to post law enforcement by the building that Crooks fired from. “I f**king told them they need to post the guys f**king over here,” the officer said. “I told them that, the f**king, the Secret Service, I told them that f**king Tuesday. I told them to post f**king guys over here.” Another officer replied that he wasn’t “even concerned about it because I thought someone was on the roof. I thought that’s how we — how in the hell can you lose a guy walking back here?” “I talked to the Secret Service guys, they were like, ‘Yeah, no problem, we’re going to post guys over here,’” the first officer said. Secret Service posted three local counter snipers inside one of the adjacent buildings, one of whom took pictures of Crooks earlier that day and left his post to go looking for the soon-to-be shooter. The Secret Service declined to comment. Documents from shooting range show Crooks’ preparation On Thursday, Sen. Chuck Grassley released documents obtained from the shooter’s gun club that revealed new details about Crooks’s preparation in the months leading up to the attempted assassination of Trump. The records from Clairton Sportsmen’s Club, reviewed by CNN, show Crooks visited the gun range a total of 43 times after establishing a membership on August 10, 2023 – less than a year before the assassination attempt Sign-in sheets provided to Grassley, an Iowa Republican, by Clairton Sportsmen’s Club also indicate Crooks spent the majority of his time at the rifle range – rather than other designated areas for firing pistols or shotguns – in the months immediately preceding the rally where he ultimately used the same type of weapon to shoot Trump. Crooks attended target practice at the club three to six times per month in 2024, before making one final visit at 2:45 p.m. on Friday, July 12, 2024 – the day before the Trump rally, according to the records obtained by Grassley.

    "text": "Delhi-NCR weather: Delhi-NCR woke up to a thick blanket of fog on Thursday which severely impacted visibility and created challenges for commuters on the roads. The dense fog reduced visibility to just a few meters in several areas which caused delays and disruptions in daily travel routines. Many commuters reported difficulties in navigating through the foggy conditions, with vehicular movement slowing down to avoid accidents.\nThe India Meteorological Department (IMD) attributed the foggy weather to a combination of low temperatures, high humidity, and calm winds prevalent in the region. According to the IMD, these conditions are likely to persist for the next few days which will further impact travel and outdoor activities.\nThe reduced visibility not only slowed down road traffic but also posed risks for early-morning commuters. Authorities have urged drivers to exercise caution, use fog lights, and maintain safe distances to avoid mishaps. Several transport services, including buses and private vehicles, have also been affected, leading to delays in reaching destinations. With the temperature dipping sharply in NCR, residents were seen gathering around bonfires to ward off the biting cold.\nMinimum visibility levels recorded in Delhi\nAccording to data from weather stations, visibility at Palam dropped to a mere 100 meters during dense fog conditions, accompanied by westerly winds at a speed of 6 kmph recorded at 6:30 am (IST). At Safdarjung, visibility levels were slightly better but still limited, with a minimum of 300 meters recorded under moderate fog conditions and calm winds around 5:30 am (IST).\nAccording to the IMD, the maximum temperature in Delhi settled at 16.2 degrees on Thursday, three notches below normal, and the minimum temperature was recorded at 7.6 degrees. A \"cold day\" is when the minimum temperature is under 10 degrees Celsius and the highest or lowest temperature is at least 4.5 degrees lower than what is considered normal for a specific period.\nWarm January likely in most parts of India\nThe IMD also stated that minimum temperatures are expected to be higher than normal in most parts of India in January, except in some areas of eastern, northwest, and west-central regions. Maximum temperatures are also likely to be above normal for most parts of the country, except in parts of northwest, central and eastern India, and central parts of the southern peninsula, it stated. The IMD also said rainfall in north India from January to March is likely to be below normal, with less than 86 per cent of the long-period average (LPA).\nALSO READ: [Weather updates: 'January 2025 likely to be warm in most parts of India', says IMD](https://www.indiatvnews.com/news/india/january-2025-weather-updates-likely-to-be-warm-in-most-parts-of-india-predicts-imd-alert-delhi-rainfall-himachal-snowfall-uttarakhand-kashmir-latest-2025-01-02-969098)",

    "text": "An unusual Christmas miracle of military victory The idea of the United States as an independent nation was saved by an unusual act on Christmas night in 1776. It was a battle, and, God in His providence helped America in one more step toward becoming free. Such was the belief of the leader of this effort. George Washington faced a momentous task — to lead a ragtag army of farmers and merchants, armed with liberty in their hearts and a love for God and country, against the most formidable army and navy in the world at that time. At the beginning of December 1776, things [looked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtXbrxvK1gw) really bad for the American cause. Washington confided to his nephew, Lund Washington, just how bad things were. He [remarked](https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/03-07-02-0228) in a letter dated December 10, 1776, “In short, your imagination can scarce extend to a situation more distressing than mine. Our only dependence now is upon the speedy enlistment of a new army. If this fails, I think the game will be pretty well up, as, from disaffection and want of spirit and fortitude, the inhabitants, instead of resistance, are offering submission.” His troops were reduced that year from around 20,000 to about 3,000. And even some of those 3,000 were tempted to quit. A betting man would have thought it was all over. So, Washington decided to take a risky gamble. He led a surprise attack on Christmas night against a force of German mercenaries — a Hessian Army — that King George III had hired in the war. This became known as the Battle of [Trenton](https://www.mountvernon.org/george-washington/the-revolutionary-war/washingtons-revolutionary-war-battles/the-trenton-princeton-campaign/10-facts-about-washingtons-crossing-of-the-delaware-river/), and it required Washington and his men to row across the Delaware River in the freezing ice. From this comes the iconic image of Washington crossing the frozen Delaware. The [story](https://bible.org/node/10635) is told that a British sympathizer in Trenton became aware of the American plot, and wrote up a note warning the Hessian troops about it. The note is reported to have ended up in the hands of the commander, but he put it in his pocket to read later, and continued his drinking and his card games. Besides, it was Christmas night. Who would have an attack then? The Hessian commander died in the surprise attack. But Washington didn’t stop there. He marched his troops onto Princeton, New Jersey, and soon successfully took on the British there also. Mount Vernon.com [notes](https://www.mountvernon.org/george-washington/the-revolutionary-war/washingtons-revolutionary-war-battles/the-trenton-princeton-campaign/10-facts-about-the-battle-of-princeton/), “The American victory at the Battle of Princeton (January 3, 1777) was one of the most consequential of the American Revolution … Washington's victory bolstered American morale and provided great confidence to his soldiers.” The victories of Trenton and Princeton were important ones, not so much because they were strategic places in America, but to show that the Americans could beat the enemy after all. They led to more badly needed enlistments. Six years later, on May 8, 1783, Rev. [Ezra Stiles](https://riheritagehalloffame.com/Rev-Ezra-Stiles/), the president of Yale College, gave a speech before the leadership of Connecticut. Keep in mind, here was a Christian headmaster addressing a Christian legislature. Note his reference to Biblical faith undergirding the American experiment. [Said](https://www.belcherfoundation.org/united_states_elevated.htm) the president of Yale: “All forms of civil polity have been tried by mankind, except one, and that seems to have been reserved in Providence to be realized in America. “Our system of dominion and civil polity would be imperfect without the true religion; or that from the diffusion of virtue among the people of any community would arise their greatest secular happiness: which will terminate in this conclusion, that holiness ought to be the end [i.e., the goal] of all civil government. ‘That thou mayest be a [holy people](https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Deuteronomy-7-6/) unto the Lord thy God.’” The Rev. Stiles [continues](https://www.belcherfoundation.org/united_states_elevated.htm), “In our lowest and most dangerous state, in 1776 and 1777, we sustained ourselves against the British Army of sixty thousand troops, commanded by ... the ablest generals Britain could procure throughout Europe, with a naval force of 22,000 seamen in above eighty men-of-war. “Who but a Washington, inspired by Heaven, could have conceived the surprise move upon the enemy at Princeton — that Christmas eve [sic] when Washington and his army crossed the Delaware?” Christmas marks the birth of the [Prince of Peace](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+9%3A6&version=NIV). George Washington regularly worshiped Jesus, and he faithfully discharged his duties of defending our country when needed, including on Christmas 1776. Repeatedly, Washington saw the hand of God, whom he referred to 270 times as Providence (the God of the Bible who answers prayer), help the American cause.

    "title": "Il papa resta in condizioni critiche: «Ringrazio medici e bambini»",
    "text": "Francesco prosegue ad essere ricoverato al Gemelli dove lo staff medico lo ha sottoposto a nuovi esami. Il nuovo bollettino ha evidenziato una lieve insufficienza renale sotto controllo. Nel testo dell’angelus scritto dal pontefice, il grazie a quanti si prendono cura in questi giorni, poi il ricordo de terzo anniversario della guerra contro l’Ucraina, «una ricorrenza dolorosa e vergognosa per l’intera umanità»\nLa situazione della salute di papa Francesco continua ad essere grave e a destare la preoccupazione dell’entourage del pontefice come dei fedeli sparsi in tutto il mondo. Dopo il bollettino di sabato sera che testimoniava un peggioramento repentino rispetto ai giorni scorsi, quando sembrava che vi fossero dei lievi elementi di miglioramento, la prognosi è diventata «riservata» e la crisi respiratoria ha conosciuto un nuovo aggravamento.\nPoi, nella tarda serata di domenica, un nuovo bollettino medico riferiva che «le condizioni del Santo Padre permangono critiche; tuttavia da ieri sera non ha presentato ulteriori crisi respiratorie».\nQuindi si informava che il pontefice «ha effettuato le due unità di emazie concentrate con beneficio e con il ritorno del valore dell’emoglobina. Stabile è rimasta la piastrinopenia; tuttavia alcuni esami sanguigni dimostrano una iniziale, lieve, insufficienza renale, allo stato sotto controllo».\nAl contempo «prosegue l’ossigenoterapia ad alti flussi attraverso le cannule nasali. Il Santo Padre continua ad essere vigile e ben orientato». In ogni caso è la conclusione, «la complessità del quadro clinico, e l’attesa necessaria affinché le terapie farmacologiche possano dare qualche riscontro, impongono che la prognosi resti riservata».\nNel frattempo, «nel corso della mattina, presso l’appartamento allestito al 10° piano, ha partecipato alla santa messa, insieme a quanti in questi giorni di degenza si prendono cura di lui». Il quadro generale resta dunque estremamente grave, per quanto stabile, con l’aggiunta di una lieve insufficienza renale.\n«Ringrazio i medici»\nGià nella mattinata, mons. Rino Fisichella, pro-prefetto del Dicastero per l’Evangelizzazione, su delega del papa, ha presieduto la messa pe il Giubileo dei diaconi svoltasi nella basilica vaticana. Prima di leggere l’omelia che il Papa ha preparato per l’occasione, Fisichella ha detto: «Sentiamo Papa Francesco, benché in un letto d’ospedale, vicino a noi, lo sentiamo presente in mezzo e noi e questo ci obbliga a rendere ancora più forte, più intensa, la nostra preghiera perché il Signore lo assista nel momento della prova e della malattia».\nPoi, all’angelus, il testo ancora predisposto dal pontefice, nel quale Francesco ha dato alcune informazioni sul momento che sta attraversando: «Da parte mia, proseguo fiducioso il ricovero al Policlinico Gemelli, portando avanti le cure necessarie; e anche il riposo fa parte della terapia! Ringrazio di cuore i medici e gli operatori sanitari di questo ospedale per l’attenzione che mi stanno dimostrando e per la dedizione con cui svolgono il loro servizio tra le persone malate». Quindi ha aggiunto: «In questi giorni mi sono giunti tanti messaggi di affetto e mi hanno particolarmente colpito le lettere e i disegni dei bambini. Grazie per questa vicinanza e per le preghiere di conforto che ho ricevuto da tutto il mondo!».\nNon è mancato, poi, nel corso dell’Angelus, anche un riferimento alla gravità delle crisi internazionali di questo periodo: «Si compie domani il terzo anniversario della guerra su larga scala contro l’Ucraina: una ricorrenza dolorosa e vergognosa per l’intera umanità!», ha affermato il pontefice nel suo testo che poi ha aggiunto: «Mentre rinnovo la mia vicinanza al martoriato popolo ucraino, vi invito a ricordare le vittime di tutti i conflitti armati e a pregare per il dono della pace in Palestina, in Israele e in tutto il Medio Oriente, in Myanmar, nel Kivu e in Sudan».\nEsami e messaggi\nSempre nel corso della mattinata, erano state diffuse altre notizie circa la salute di Francesco da parte del Vaticano, in base a quanto si veniva a sapere, sembrava che la crisi emergenziale subita ieri dal pontefice, oggi era sostanzialmente rientrata, «come emerge anche dal fatto che abbia trascorso una notte tranquilla».\nAl pontefice comunque, riferivano ancora fonti Vaticane, «sono tuttora applicati i naselli per la somministrazione di ossigeno ad alti flussi, che lo aiutano nella respirazione». Nella mattina di domenica infine, Francesco è stato sottoposto a nuovi esami clinici, in base ai risultati dei quali è stato appunto diffuso l’ultimo bollettino medico.\nNel frattempo si moltiplicano i messaggi di solidarietà e vicinanza al pontefice, fra quelli più significativi, da segnalare quanto ha scritto su Facebook, Ahmad al Tayyeb, grande imam della moschea e dell’università di Al Azhar, la più alta autorità religiosa dell’Islam sunnita: «Prego Dio affinché conceda al mio caro fratello Papa Francesco una pronta guarigione e una buona salute per potere continuare il suo cammino al servizio dell’umanità». Al Tayyeb aveva firmato insieme a Bergoglio la Dichiarazione per la fratellanza umana, documento che apriva nuove e inedite strade al dialogo e alla collaborazione fra fedi e culture.\nImportante anche la mobilitazione della chiesa in Italia, sono molte infatti le diocesi che si sono organizzate per dare vita a momenti di preghiera in favore de papa. La sera di domenica, intorno alle 20, nella chiesa di San Domenico a Bologna, il card. Matteo Zuppi, arcivescovo di Bologna e Presidente della Cei, ha presieduto il rosario per la salute di papa Francesco.\n«Vogliamo stringerci al Santo Padre», ha detto il cardinal Zuppi, «chiedendo al Signore di sostenerlo in questo momento di sofferenza, perché trovi sollievo e possa ristabilirsi al più presto. Sarà un modo concreto per rinnovargli la vicinanza e l’affetto delle comunità ecclesiali italiane, che da giorni hanno intensificato la loro preghiera».\nAnche a Roma, il cardinale vicario Baldassare Reina, sempre nel pomeriggio di domenica, ha presieduto una celebrazione nel pomeriggio, una messa con una speciale intercessione per la salute di papa Francesco; lo stesso hanno fatto i parroci e i sacerdoti nelle celebrazioni svoltesi ieri.\n«Desidero invitarvi ad unirvi spiritualmente alla santa messa che celebrerò questa sera. In comunione di fede e di preghiera, ciascuno nella propria comunità», è stato l’invito del cardinale vicario, «innalzeremo al Signore la nostra supplica per il santo padre, affinché lo sostenga con la Sua grazia e lo ricolmi della forza necessaria per attraversare questo momento di prova».\n© Riproduzione riservata",

    "text": "La Asociación de Trabajadores del Estado (ATE) realizará un paro de 36 horas en todo el país entre el miércoles 9 y el jueves 10 de abril, tras sumarse a las medidas de fuerza anunciadas por la Confederación General del Trabajo (CGT) para esas fechas. La semana pasada, la central obrera anunció una movilización junto a los jubilados el 9 de abril y un paro general el 10 de abril.\nEste jueves, trabajadores nucleados en ATE se movilizaron al Ministerio de Desregulación y Transformación del Estado, que conduce Federico Sturzenegger. Después de la marcha, en la que las fuerzas de seguridad aplicaron el protocolo antipiquetes, el secretario general del gremio, Rodolfo Aguiar, confirmó que los estatales se plegarán al paro convocado por la CGT.\n\"El único lenguaje que entiende esta gente es la fuerza\", expresó Aguiar en sus redes sociales. \"Tenemos que aceptar que en nuestro país el Estado ha sido colonizado por los empresarios y que ya casi no quedan rastros de institucionalidad. Los estatales se movilizaron masivamente en todo el país. Tenemos que seguir aumentando la conflictividad, desgastando antes que dejen en la Argentina sólo tierra arrasada\", agregó.\nAdemás, el dirigente gremial pidió que se profundice \"la campaña de afiliación a ATE en todos los sectores porque hasta ahora el Gobierno recortó salarios con la complicidad de otro sindicato\". \"Basta de bancar a empresarios disfrazados de gremialistas en el Estado\", sentenció.\n\"Está claro que el programa económico del Gobierno fracasa y que los que van a tomar nueva deuda con el FMI son los mismos del 2018 y lo quieren para lo mismo, para fugársela. El acuerdo con el Fondo es más deuda y será más ajuste. Los que firmen ese entendimiento tienen que terminar presos\", concluyó el mensaje de Rodolfo Aguiar.\nLos reclamos de ATE\nEn un comunicado, ATE explicó: \"El 31 de marzo finalizan 50 mil vínculos laborales en el Estado y el sindicato exige la renovación automática y anual de la totalidad de los mismos. Cabe recordar que durante el 2024, las paritarias quedaron 44,4% por debajo de la inflación y la tendencia continúa durante el 2025, con 1,5% y 1,2% en enero y febrero, y una negociación que pasó a cuarto intermedio sin llamado a una nueva convocatoria para discutir los incrementos de marzo\".\n\"También se suma al reclamo la recientemente publicada Decisión Administrativa 7/25 de la Jefatura de Gabinetes, que establece que los funcionarios del Gobierno podrán asignarse unidades retributivas adicionales en función del ahorro presupuestario generado por la reducción de dotación de personal de la respectiva jurisdicción\", añadió.\nTambién exteriorizaron otros reclamos, que sintetizaron:\n- Reincorporación de trabajadoras y trabajadores despedidos de manera ilegal.\n- Rechazo a la privatización de empresas públicas.\n- Rechazo a la fusión y cierre de organismos.\n- Aumento de emergencia para todas las y los jubilados.\n- Restitución del Fondo de Garantía de Sustentabilidad (FGS) de la ANSES.\n- Restitución de la moratoria previsional y normalización del INSSJyP.",

    "text": "ST. LOUIS — Road crews across the bi-state are preparing for a mixed bag of winter weather conditions this weekend.\nThe National Weather Service said the last few winters haven't brought a lot of snow to the bi-state but the storm system moving in this weekend could have a widespread impact that reaches the east coast.\n“Some of the amounts that we're seeing that are in some of the model data, could top the Groundhog Day 2022 storm. That was February 2nd and 3rd of 2022. St. Louis received almost seven inches of snow, that time Columbia was almost 10 inches,” NWS St. Louis Meteorologist Jared Maples said.\nMaples said with the freezing rain, sleet and snow combination, they're particularly concerned about ice on the power lines and the roads.\n“There's kind of this false perception that if I have four-wheel drive, I can drive on ice. That’s completely false. There is no traction in the freezing rain,” Maples added.\nThe Illinois Department of Transportation said they're still dealing with staffing challenges and are trying their best to put their resources in the right place.\n“If the forecast holds, I don't think folks from the south will be able to help us much because they'll be dealing with freezing rain. So now if the setup is that north of us gets heavier snow, we're preparing as if we're going to be on an island and have to handle this ourselves,” IDOT District 8 Engineer Joe Monroe said.\nMaples said the last significant ice storm was in 2009 when some areas received an inch of ice.\n“But when you get that type of weight, that water weight, that is sticking to the tree branches and you start to add wind, especially in those cases, you're talking about tree limbs down, power lines down, that could be power outages that could last days in some cases,” Maples said.\nHe said single-digit temperatures right after this storm will make whatever precipitation we do get stick around for a while and even refreeze, which can cause issues for road crews and drivers...\n“The challenge will be real and the mobility will be compromised at points during that event,” Monroe said.\nThe National Weather Service said if you need to get out and go get some food or run other errands, the last chance to do that safely is during the day on Saturday.\nThe 5 On Your Side team will keep you updated so you know exactly what's going on throughout this storm.",
