    "text": "A protester at NYU spit on a sign that said \"Jewish\" before adorning it over the word \"White.\" The final sign said \"Pure Evil\" and \"Jewish Supremacy.\" (Obtained by Fox News) Fox News' \"Antisemitism Exposed\" newsletter brings you stories on the rising anti-Jewish prejudice across the U.S. and the world. IN TODAY’S NEWSLETTER :- American colleges rocked by numerous antisemitic incidents in 2023\n- Tennis legend Martina Navratilova rips family in viral antisemitic video\n- Jewish students struggling with antisemitism at college now have use of walk-in mental health clinic NEW YORK, NEW YORK - NOVEMBER 15: Students participate in a protest in support of Palestine and for free speech outside of the Columbia University campus on November 15, 2023 in New York City. The university suspended two student organizations, Students for Justice in Palestine, and Jewish Voices for Peace, for violating university policies. The tense atmosphere at many college campuses has increased as student groups, activists and others have protested both in support of Israel and Palestine (Spencer Platt/Getty Images) TOP STORY: A number of antisemitic incidents rocked several college campuses this year in the U.S. following the attack against Israel by Hamas militants. In the wake of the Oct. 7 terror attack in southern Israel which left an estimated 1,200 people dead, several college campuses became hotbeds for pro-Palestinian demonstrations amid an explosion of protests on the same issue from different corners of the world. \"PATHETIC\" : Tennis legend Martina Navratilova showed her disgust with a video that appeared to show a girl telling a rabbi to \"kill yourself\" if they had a problem with \"free Palestine.\" The confrontation took place in Times Square in New York City. \" Pretty sad. And the mother is laughing. Pathetic ,\" Navratilova wrote. The clip received more than 7.3 million views since it was posted on Sunday.\" INNOCENT PEOPLE AT RISK \": A record number of Jewish institutions in the U.S. were targets of swatting incidents over the weekend, and the FBI believes they were coordinated attacks that originated outside the country. \"Swatting\" involves calling 911 and faking an emergency that draws a response from law enforcement – usually a SWAT team. Per an internal FBI memo, more than 30 of the FBI’s 56 field offices are investigating the string of false reports.\" BACK TOWARDS SANITY \": A retired Vanderbilt University professor and one of Harvard President Claudine Gay's alleged plagiarism victims has called for the immediate firing of the embattled higher education leader to \" steer the university back towards sanity .\" \"Fire Claudine Gay posthaste,\" Dr. Carol Swain posted Thursday on X, as part of a social media post titled \"some free unsolicited advice for Harvard University.\" \"She can be relieved of duties until the terms are negotiated.\" QUOTE OF THE WEEK : \"Antisemitism is no longer confined to extremist circles and has become increasingly mainstreamed, a major driver of which is social media and the online sphere.\" - Anti-Defamation League (ADL) study.

    "text": "*I do not support the history of why we have Thanksgiving, nor do I do anything special on Thanksgiving with my family besides eating food.*\nThanksgiving is a time we all take for granted. If you’ve read my other articles you’d know that I stood in my college town for the summer. Basically, the only time in 2023 that I’ve been home with my family is before the spring semester started (2-3 weeks in January), spring break (one week in March), and my 21st birthday in July (one week in July). I have been in Oswego most of 2023 so this Thanksgiving is a bit different for me. We take being home with family and spending quality time with family for granted. Here is what I’m thankful for this Thanksgiving.\nSeeing my Mom\nMy mom is an important person in my life. She raised me single-handedly and shaped me into who I am. I’m thankful to see my mom this Thanksgiving and spend time with her.\nSeeing my Family\nIt has been a while since I’ve seen some of my family members. Family is also important to me. In the past year or so I’ve lost two family members and some other members are experiencing old age and health issues. That’s why this Thanksgiving I’m thankful to see my family before it’s too late. Life is short and you never know what will happen so appreciate your family more because they won’t all be here forever.\nGetting Some Real Home Cooked Food\nCooking in a dorm is NOT convenient at all so all I have is either dining hall or ordering out. Ordering out gets old because Oswego isn’t like New York City where we have so many food options. I am thankful I get to be home and get to cook and get home-cooked meals from my mom. I’ve missed her cooking.\nBeing Home\nI have been in Oswego all year basically. At first, it was peaceful and relaxing since I was there all summer, but oh boy am I thankful to be home. There’s something about Oswego Air that makes the people unpleasant and just not fun to be around. Also, the weather now in Oswego is so gloomy and does not help my mental health at all. I’m glad to be home, my mental health needs it.\nMyself\nI’ll save this for whenever I write a book. I wish I could share everything I’ve been through this year, but it’s best to keep it to myself. I’m grateful to myself, for always being strong and never giving up even though I wanted to so many times this year. I am thankful that I was able to still be successful, go to my class, get a job, work, be President of Her Campus, run my org, get back into reading, get brand deals, and much more all while struggling with my mental health and being alone.\n2023\nI’m thankful I lived through this year even though I didn’t want to and I wanted it all to end. I’m thankful for all the lessons I’ve learned and my self-discovery journey. I’m thankful for the people I got close to this year but I’m also thankful that I am no longer close with them. I’m thankful for my friends I do have and all the supportive people in my life, I appreciate them more than they know. I’m thankful for my sweet bosses at Penfield Library who have taken care of me since the summer. I’m thankful for Her Campus and all our writers.\nI’m thankful for this year to finally end.",

    "text": "Battlefield graduate and East Carolina baseball standout Carter Cunningham started a foundation called \"Homers That Help.\" The foundation help… At ECU’s preseason banquet in February, Cunningham asked for 33 sponsors, one for each of the Pirates’ home games, to pay $300. The donors then would be asked to contribute an additional $100 for each home run hit by an ECU player during the ECU home game they sponsored. In an area where Pirates' baseball is by far the most popular sport in Greenville, Cunningham said 33 slots were filled within the first 12 hours. To date, the foundation has raised over $28,000. The money goes to support families who have children at the hospital. The money can be used however the family wants to help them during their stay. “It’s such a joy to see all the seeds he is sowing,” Howell said. “[He’s] one of those workers.” Cunningham also played an instrumental role in coming up with this year’s team motto: Discipline = Freedom. Godwin always lets each team select the motto. As a team leader, Cunningham facilitated discussion on what that motto should be. The one thing Cunningham added was to have the team find a Bible verse that aligned with the motto. They came up with Hebrews 12:11, which fit perfectly: “No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it.” He's even planting seeds among youth. Webb Tyndall is one of two chaplains for ECU’s baseball team. One day, Tyndall’s wife Laura told him about the testimony she heard from an 11-year-old boy at a recent Community Bible Study end-of-the-year event. The boy, who plays Little League Baseball, is usually quiet. But this time, he spoke up to share how Cunningham had impacted him with a message of encouragement. The boy had been struggling until Cunningham took a moment to lift his spirits. “He’s a servant-leader,” Tyndall said. “He’s bold and very transparent. He doesn’t act like he’s got it all together.” Cunningham remembered speaking to the boy after a game but didn’t recall what he said. Still, he understands the importance of his role. “It’s why I do the things I do,” Cunningham said. “Everything you say or do is being watched.” Going forward Cunningham starts the final phase of his college baseball career Friday when ECU hosts a four-team regional. To reach their first College World Series, the Pirates need to win this regional as well as a Super Regional. Cunningham would love nothing more than to finally help the Pirates reach Omaha. He’s played a significant role in getting ECU to this point, hitting a team-high .371 with 14 homers and 60 RBI. He’d also like a shot a pro ball when the MLB Draft takes place July 14-16. Godwin, for one, thinks Cunningham deserves an opportunity to compete at the next level. Cunningham entered the season ranked as the No. 13 AAC draft prospect by Perfect Game. “I would be shocked if he wasn’t given a chance to play pro ball,” Godwin said. “It’s a broken system if he’s not.” No doubt baseball has been good to Cunningham. From his days as an all-state outfielder at Battlefield to becoming a two-time, all-AAC first-team player at ECU, Cunningham has thrived at each stop. But no matter how far baseball takes him, his priorities remain unchanged. His faith comes first. He is here to establish an eternal legacy, not an earthly one. “We’re all brothers in Christ forever,” Howell said. “Nothing can sever that.” One of Cunningham’s favorite scriptures is Jeremiah 29:11: “For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.” If pro baseball is in his future? Great. If it’s a 9-to-5 job putting his MBA to use? Great. Cunningham is good either way. “I give it to God and say do with it what you want,” Cunningham said. Spoken like a true servant-leader.",

    "text": "A lab technician holds a bacteria culture that shows a positive infection of enterohemorrhagic E. coli from a patient at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf on June 2, 2011, in Hamburg, Germany.\nA small town in Oregon has been under a boil-water notice for a year after bacteria was found in the water supply.\nJewell, which is about an hour northwest of Portland, has a population of 1,403—all of whom haven’t been able to safely use the water from their taps since last December when the water tested positive for E. coli.\nMore than a year later and the water hasn’t been treated, according to the Clatsop County Health Department. Newsweek reached out to Clatsop County Environmental Health via email for comment.\nThe Oregon Health Authority (OHA) told Newsweek via email on Thursday: “A water system inspection was conducted in March 2023. Several deficiencies identified remain unresolved.”\n“I pretty much don’t use this water at all, and if I have to use it, it’s bleach city,” one Jewell resident who wished to remain anonymous told local Fox affiliate KPTV. “I’ve broken out on my hands, on my face, when I didn’t realize what was going on. I could actually taste it in my mouth.”\nLocals have tried to take matters into their own hands to get clean water.\nThe property that the pump house and well are on has new owners, Jennifer and Sam Lynch, but Tony Cavin still has control over the well.\n“We’ve called the county, we’ve called the state, we’ve called the water master, we’ve talked to a lawyer, we’ve just tried to push this in any direction we can to get the state to enforce the regulations that need to be done so that there’s clean water,” Jennifer Lynch told KPTV on Wednesday.\n“What we’re hoping is that the state will enforce the fines that he should’ve had already because there’s tons that have accrued but no one’s enforcing them. How can there be no repercussions for a community with 47 houses that you’re providing E. coli-infested water?”\nOHA told Newsweek: “Ownership of the water system has transferred to a new owner. There may be a dispute with the former and current owner/operators.\n“The county and Drinking Water Services are ready to work with the new owner on steps needed to ensure safe drinking water, including sampling and communicating advisory status to customers. Drinking Water Services will review the existing enforcement action to determine whether assessing civil penalties is appropriate.\n“The Public Utility Commission has been contacted about the situation.”\nThe environmental health supervisor, Lucas Marshall, said that the locals are being “held hostage” by Cavin.\n“I believe it’s fairly unusual because our state partners have also had some difficulties with this situation, it’s not something where we have precedents or a map to follow regarding situations like this,” Marshall told KPTV. “The community is being held hostage by an operator that will not make the corrective actions to improve the water quality, and make sure that the water is safe, but is also not stepping aside and allowing for another operator to come in and get the system back online.”\nWhile multiple residents told the station that Cavin posted a test showing the water to be free of E. coli in the community Facebook group recently, the boil-water notice is still in effect and their water is still yellow.\nOHA representatives from said that Cavin posted the boil-water notice on social media when it went into effect and said that the notice had also been distributed to customers. However, residents told KPTV that they did not know about the notice until a few months after it went into effect.\nIt went into effect on December 15, 2022, the OHA told Newsweek.\nUpdate 12/28/23, 5:10 p.m. ET: This article has been updated with comment from the OHA.\nRelated Articles\nStart your unlimited Newsweek trial",

    "text": "DIGITAL MAOISM\n(JARON LANIER:) My Wikipedia entry identifies me (at least this week) as a film director. It is true I made one experimental short film about a decade and a half ago. The concept was awful: I tried to imagine what Maya Deren would have done with morphing. It was shown once at a film festival and was never distributed and I would be most comfortable if no one ever sees it again.\nIn the real world it is easy to not direct films. I have attempted to retire from directing films in the alternative universe that is the Wikipedia a number of times, but somebody always overrules me. Every time my Wikipedia entry is corrected, within a day I'm turned into a film director again. I can think of no more suitable punishment than making these determined Wikipedia goblins actually watch my one small old movie.\nTwice in the past several weeks, reporters have asked me about my filmmaking career. The fantasies of the goblins have entered that portion of the world that is attempting to remain real. I know I've gotten off easy. The errors in my Wikipedia bio have been (at least prior to the publication of this article) charming and even flattering.\nReading a Wikipedia entry is like reading the bible closely. There are faint traces of the voices of various anonymous authors and editors, though it is impossible to be sure. In my particular case, it appears that the goblins are probably members or descendants of the rather sweet old Mondo 2000 culture linking psychedelic experimentation with computers. They seem to place great importance on relating my ideas to those of the psychedelic luminaries of old (and in ways that I happen to find sloppy and incorrect.) Edits deviating from this set of odd ideas that are important to this one particular small subculture are immediately removed. This makes sense. Who else would volunteer to pay that much attention and do all that work?\n***\nThe problem I am concerned with here is not the Wikipedia in itself. It's been criticized quite a lot, especially in the last year, but the Wikipedia is just one experiment that still has room to change and grow. At the very least it's a success at revealing what the online people with the most determination and time on their hands are thinking, and that's actually interesting information.\nNo, the problem is in the way the Wikipedia has come to be regarded and used; how it's been elevated to such importance so quickly. And that is part of the larger pattern of the appeal of a new online collectivism that is nothing less than a resurgence of the idea that the collective is all-wise, that it is desirable to have influence concentrated in a bottleneck that can channel the collective with the most verity and force. This is different from representative democracy, or meritocracy. This idea has had dreadful consequences when thrust upon us from the extreme Right or the extreme Left in various historical periods. The fact that it's now being re-introduced today by prominent technologists and futurists, people who in many cases I know and like, doesn't make it any less dangerous.\nThere was a well-publicized study in Nature last year comparing the accuracy of the Wikipedia to Encyclopedia Britannica. The results were a toss up. While there is a lingering debate about the validity of the study. The items selected for the comparison were just the sort that Wikipedia would do well on: Science topics that the collective at large doesn't care much about. \"Kinetic isotope effect\" or \"Vesalius, Andreas\" are examples of topics that make the Britannica hard to maintain, because it takes work to find the right authors to research and review a multitude of diverse topics. But they are perfect for the Wikipedia. There is little controversy around these items, plus the Net provides ready access to a reasonably small number of competent specialist graduate student types possessing the manic motivation of youth.\nA core belief of the wiki world is that whatever problems exist in the wiki will be incrementally corrected as the process unfolds. This is analogous to the claims of Hyper-Libertarians who put infinite faith in a free market, or the Hyper-Lefties who are somehow able to sit through consensus decision-making processes. In all these cases, it seems to me that empirical evidence has yielded mixed results. Sometimes loosely structured collective activities yield continuous improvements and sometimes they don't. Often we don't live long enough to find out. Later in this essay I'll point out what constraints make a collective smart. But first, it's important to not lose sight of values just because the question of whether a collective can be smart is so fascinating. Accuracy in a text is not enough. A desirable text is more than a collection of accurate references. It is also an expression of personality.\nFor instance, most of the technical or scientific information that is in the Wikipedia was already on the Web before the Wikipedia was started. You could always use Google or other search services to find information about items that are now wikified. In some cases I have noticed specific texts get cloned from original sites at universities or labs onto wiki pages. And when that happens, each text loses part of its value. Since search engines are now more likely to point you to the wikified versions, the Web has lost some of its flavor in casual use.\nWhen you see the context in which something was written and you know who the author was beyond just a name, you learn so much more than when you find the same text placed in the anonymous, faux-authoritative, anti-contextual brew of the Wikipedia. The question isn't just one of authentication and accountability, though those are important, but something more subtle. A voice should be sensed as a whole. You have to have a chance to sense personality in order for language to have its full meaning. Personal Web pages do that, as do journals and books. Even Britannica has an editorial voice, which some people have criticized as being vaguely too \"Dead White Men.\"\nIf an ironic Web site devoted to destroying cinema claimed that I was a filmmaker, it would suddenly make sense. That would be an authentic piece of text. But placed out of context in the Wikipedia, it becomes drivel.\nMyspace is another recent experiment that has become even more influential than the Wikipedia. Like the Wikipedia, it adds just a little to the powers already present on the Web in order to inspire a dramatic shift in use. Myspace is all about authorship, but it doesn't pretend to be all-wise. You can always tell at least a little about the character of the person who made a Myspace page. But it is very rare indeed that a Myspace page inspires even the slightest confidence that the author is a trustworthy authority. Hurray for Myspace on that count!\nMyspace is a richer, multi-layered, source of information than the Wikipedia, although the topics the two services cover barely overlap. If you want to research a TV show in terms of what people think of it, Myspace will reveal more to you than the analogous and enormous entries in the Wikipedia.\n***\nThe Wikipedia is far from being the only online fetish site for foolish collectivism. There's a frantic race taking place online to become the most \"Meta\" site, to be the highest level aggregator, subsuming the identity of all other sites.\nThe race began innocently enough with the notion of creating directories of online destinations, such as the early incarnations of Yahoo. Then came AltaVista, where one could search using an inverted database of the content of the whole Web. Then came Google, which added page rank algorithms. Then came the blogs, which varied greatly in terms of quality and importance. This lead to Meta-blogs such as Boing Boing, run by identified humans, which served to aggregate blogs. In all of these formulations, real people were still in charge. An individual or individuals were presenting a personality and taking responsibility.\nThese Web-based designs assumed that value would flow from people. It was still clear, in all such designs, that the Web was made of people, and that ultimately value always came from connecting with real humans.\nEven Google by itself (as it stands today) isn't Meta enough to be a problem. One layer of page ranking is hardly a threat to authorship, but an accumulation of many layers can create a meaningless murk, and that is another matter.\nIn the last year or two the trend has been to remove the scent of people, so as to come as close as possible to simulating the appearance of content emerging out of the Web as if it were speaking to us as a supernatural oracle. This is where the use of the Internet crosses the line into delusion.\nKevin Kelly, the former editor of Whole Earth Review and the founding Executive Editor of Wired, is a friend and someone who has been thinking about what he and others call the \"Hive Mind.\" He runs a Website called Cool Tools that's a cross between a blog and the old Whole Earth Catalog. On Cool Tools, the contributors, including me, are not a hive because we are identified.\nIn March, Kelly reviewed a variety of \"Consensus Web filters\" such as \"Digg\" and \"Reddit\" that assemble material every day from all the myriad of other aggregating sites. Such sites intend to be more Meta than the sites they aggregate. There is no person taking responsibility for what appears on them, only an algorithm. The hope seems to be that the most Meta site will become the mother of all bottlenecks and receive infinite funding.\nThat new magnitude of Meta-ness lasted only a month. In April, Kelly reviewed a site called \"popurls\" that aggregates consensus Web filtering sites...and there was a new \"most Meta\". We now are reading what a collectivity algorithm derives from what other collectivity algorithms derived from what collectives chose from what a population of mostly amateur writers wrote anonymously.\nIs \"popurls\" any good? I am writing this on May 27, 2006. In the last few days an experimental approach to diabetes management has been announced that might prevent nerve damage. That's huge news for tens of millions of Americans. It is not mentioned on popurls. Popurls does clue us in to this news: \"Student sets simultaneous world ice cream-eating record, worst ever ice cream headache.\" Mainstream news sources all lead today with a serious earthquake in Java. Popurls includes a few mentions of the event, but they are buried within the aggregation of aggregate news sites like Google News. The reason the quake appears on popurls at all can be discovered only if you dig through all the aggregating layers to find the original sources, which are those rare entries actually created by professional writers and editors who sign their names. But at the layer of popurls, the ice cream story and the Javanese earthquake are at best equals, without context or authorship.\nKevin Kelly says of the \"popurls\" site, \"There's no better way to watch the hive mind.\" But the hive mind is for the most part stupid and boring. Why pay attention to it?\n***\nReaders of my previous rants will notice a parallel between my discomfort with so-called \"Artificial Intelligence\" and the race to erase personality and be most Meta. In each case, there's a presumption that something like a distinct kin to individual human intelligence is either about to appear any minute, or has already appeared. The problem with that presumption is that people are all too willing to lower standards in order to make the purported newcomer appear smart. Just as people are willing to bend over backwards and make themselves stupid in order to make an AI interface appear smart (as happens when someone can interact with the notorious Microsoft paper clip,) so are they willing to become uncritical and dim in order to make Meta-aggregator sites appear to be coherent.\nThere is a pedagogical connection between the culture of Artificial Intelligence and the strange allure of anonymous collectivism online. Google's vast servers and the Wikipedia are both mentioned frequently as being the startup memory for Artificial Intelligences to come. Larry Page is quoted via a link presented to me by popurls this morning (who knows if it's accurate) as speculating that an AI might appear within Google within a few years. George Dyson has wondered if such an entity already exists on the Net, perhaps perched within Google. My point here is not to argue about the existence of Metaphysical entities, but just to emphasize how premature and dangerous it is to lower the expectations we hold for individual human intellects.\nThe beauty of the Internet is that it connects people. The value is in the other people. If we start to believe the Internet itself is an entity that has something to say, we're devaluing those people and making ourselves into idiots.\n***\nCompounding the problem is that new business models for people who think and write have not appeared as quickly as we all hoped. Newspapers, for instance, are on the whole facing a grim decline as the Internet takes over the feeding of the curious eyes that hover over morning coffee and, even worse, classified ads. In the new environment, Google News is for the moment better funded and enjoys a more secure future than most of the rather small number of fine reporters around the world who ultimately create most of its content. The aggregator is richer than the aggregated.\nThe question of new business models for content creators on the Internet is a profound and difficult topic in itself, but it must at least be pointed out that writing professionally and well takes time and that most authors need to be paid to take that time. In this regard, blogging is not writing. For example, it's easy to be loved as a blogger. All you have to do is play to the crowd. Or you can flame the crowd to get attention. Nothing is wrong with either of those activities. What I think of as real writing, however, writing meant to last, is something else. It involves articulating a perspective that is not just reactive to yesterday's moves in a conversation.\nThe artificial elevation of all things Meta is not confined to online culture. It is having a profound influence on how decisions are made in America.\nWhat we are witnessing today is the alarming rise of the fallacy of the infallible collective. Numerous elite organizations have been swept off their feet by the idea. They are inspired by the rise of the Wikipedia, by the wealth of Google, and by the rush of entrepreneurs to be the most Meta. Government agencies, top corporate planning departments, and major universities have all gotten the bug.\nAs a consultant, I used to be asked to test an idea or propose a new one to solve a problem. In the last couple of years I've often been asked to work quite differently. You might find me and the other consultants filling out survey forms or tweaking edits to a collective essay. I'm saying and doing much less than I used to, even though I'm still being paid the same amount. Maybe I shouldn't complain, but the actions of big institutions do matter, and it's time to speak out against the collectivity fad that is upon us.\nIt's not hard to see why the fallacy of collectivism has become so popular in big organizations: If the principle is correct, then individuals should not be required to take on risks or responsibilities. We live in times of tremendous uncertainties coupled with infinite liability phobia, and we must function within institutions that are loyal to no executive, much less to any lower level member. Every individual who is afraid to say the wrong thing within his or her organization is safer when hiding behind a wiki or some other Meta aggregation ritual.\nI've participated in a number of elite, well-paid wikis and Meta-surveys lately and have had a chance to observe the results. I have even been part of a wiki about wikis. What I've seen is a loss of insight and subtlety, a disregard for the nuances of considered opinions, and an increased tendency to enshrine the official or normative beliefs of an organization. Why isn't everyone screaming about the recent epidemic of inappropriate uses of the collective? It seems to me the reason is that bad old ideas look confusingly fresh when they are packaged as technology.\n***\nThe collective rises around us in multifarious ways. What afflicts big institutions also afflicts pop culture. For instance, it has become notoriously difficult to introduce a new pop star in the music business. Even the most successful entrants have hardly ever made it past the first album in the last decade or so. The exception is American Idol. As with the Wikipedia, there's nothing wrong with it. The problem is its centrality.\nMore people appear to vote in this pop competition than in presidential elections, and one reason why is the instant convenience of information technology. The collective can vote by phone or by texting, and some vote more than once. The collective is flattered and it responds. The winners are likable, almost by definition.\nBut John Lennon wouldn't have won. He wouldn't have made it to the finals. Or if he had, he would have ended up a different sort of person and artist. The same could be said about Jimi Hendrix, Elvis, Joni Mitchell, Duke Ellington, David Byrne, Grandmaster Flash, Bob Dylan (please!), and almost anyone else who has been vastly influential in creating pop music.\nAs below, so above. The New York Times, of all places, has recently published op-ed pieces supporting the pseudo-idea of intelligent design. This is astonishing. The Times has become the paper of averaging opinions. Something is lost when American Idol becomes a leader instead of a follower of pop music. But when intelligent design shares the stage with real science in the paper of record, everything is lost.\nHow could the Times have fallen so far? I don't know, but I would imagine the process was similar to what I've seen in the consulting world of late. It's safer to be the aggregator of the collective. You get to include all sorts of material without committing to anything. You can be superficially interesting without having to worry about the possibility of being wrong.\nExcept when intelligent thought really matters. In that case the average idea can be quite wrong, and only the best ideas have lasting value. Science is like that.\n***\nThe collective isn't always stupid. In some special cases the collective can be brilliant. For instance, there's a demonstrative ritual often presented to incoming students at business schools. In one version of the ritual, a large jar of jellybeans is placed in the front of a classroom. Each student guesses how many beans there are. While the guesses vary widely, the average is usually accurate to an uncanny degree.\nThis is an example of the special kind of intelligence offered by a collective. It is that peculiar trait that has been celebrated as the \"Wisdom of Crowds,\" though I think the word \"wisdom\" is misleading. It is part of what makes Adam Smith's Invisible Hand clever, and is connected to the reasons Google's page rank algorithms work. It was long ago adapted to futurism, where it was known as the Delphi technique. The phenomenon is real, and immensely useful.\nBut it is not infinitely useful. The collective can be stupid, too. Witness tulip crazes and stock bubbles. Hysteria over fictitious satanic cult child abductions. Y2K mania.\nThe reason the collective can be valuable is precisely that its peaks of intelligence and stupidity are not the same as the ones usually displayed by individuals. Both kinds of intelligence are essential.\nWhat makes a market work, for instance, is the marriage of collective and individual intelligence. A marketplace can't exist only on the basis of having prices determined by competition. It also needs entrepreneurs to come up with the products that are competing in the first place.\nIn other words, clever individuals, the heroes of the marketplace, ask the questions which are answered by collective behavior. They put the jellybeans in the jar.\nThere are certain types of answers that ought not be provided by an individual. When a government bureaucrat sets a price, for instance, the result is often inferior to the answer that would come from a reasonably informed collective that is reasonably free of manipulation or runaway internal resonances. But when a collective designs a product, you get design by committee, which is a derogatory expression for a reason.\nHere I must take a moment to comment on Linux and similar efforts. The various formulations of \"open\" or \"free\" software are different from the Wikipedia and the race to be most Meta in important ways. Linux programmers are not anonymous and in fact personal glory is part of the motivational engine that keeps such enterprises in motion. But there are similarities, and the lack of a coherent voice or design sensibility in an esthetic sense is one negative quality of both open source software and the Wikipedia.\nThese movements are at their most efficient while building hidden information plumbing layers, such as Web servers. They are hopeless when it comes to producing fine user interfaces or user experiences. If the code that ran the Wikipedia user interface were as open as the contents of the entries, it would churn itself into impenetrable muck almost immediately. The collective is good at solving problems which demand results that can be evaluated by uncontroversial performance parameters, but bad when taste and judgment matter.\n***\nCollectives can be just as stupid as any individual, and in important cases, stupider. The interesting question is whether it's possible to map out where the one is smarter than the many.\nThere is a lot of history to this topic, and varied disciplines have lots to say. Here is a quick pass at where I think the boundary between effective collective thought and nonsense lies: The collective is more likely to be smart when it isn't defining its own questions, when the goodness of an answer can be evaluated by a simple result (such as a single numeric value,) and when the information system which informs the collective is filtered by a quality control mechanism that relies on individuals to a high degree. Under those circumstances, a collective can be smarter than a person. Break any one of those conditions and the collective becomes unreliable or worse.\nMeanwhile, an individual best achieves optimal stupidity on those rare occasions when one is both given substantial powers and insulated from the results of his or her actions.\nIf the above criteria have any merit, then there is an unfortunate convergence. The setup for the most stupid collective is also the setup for the most stupid individuals.\n***\nEvery authentic example of collective intelligence that I am aware of also shows how that collective was guided or inspired by well-meaning individuals. These people focused the collective and in some cases also corrected for some of the common hive mind failure modes. The balancing of influence between people and collectives is the heart of the design of democracies, scientific communities, and many other long-standing projects. There's a lot of experience out there to work with. A few of these old ideas provide interesting new ways to approach the question of how to best use the hive mind.\nThe pre-Internet world provides some great examples of how personality-based quality control can improve collective intelligence. For instance, an independent press provides tasty news about politicians by reporters with strong voices and reputations, like the Watergate reporting of Woodward and Bernstein. Other writers provide product reviews, such as Walt Mossberg in The Wall Street Journal and David Pogue in The New York Times. Such journalists inform the collective's determination of election results and pricing. Without an independent press, composed of heroic voices, the collective becomes stupid and unreliable, as has been demonstrated in many historical instances. (Recent events in America have reflected the weakening of the press, in my opinion.)\nScientific communities likewise achieve quality through a cooperative process that includes checks and balances, and ultimately rests on a foundation of goodwill and \"blind\" elitism — blind in the sense that ideally anyone can gain entry, but only on the basis of a meritocracy. The tenure system and many other aspects of the academy are designed to support the idea that individual scholars matter, not just the process or the collective.\nAnother example: Entrepreneurs aren't the only \"heroes\" of a marketplace. The role of a central bank in an economy is not the same as that of a communist party official in a centrally planned economy. Even though setting an interest rate sounds like the answering of a question, it is really more like the asking of a question. The Fed asks the market to answer the question of how to best optimize for lowering inflation, for instance. While that might not be the question everyone would want to have asked, it is at least coherent.\nYes, there have been plenty of scandals in government, the academy and in the press. No mechanism is perfect, but still here we are, having benefited from all of these institutions. There certainly have been plenty of bad reporters, self-deluded academic scientists, incompetent bureaucrats, and so on. Can the hive mind help keep them in check? The answer provided by experiments in the pre-Internet world is \"yes,\" but only provided some signal processing is placed in the loop.\n***\nSome of the regulating mechanisms for collectives that have been most successful in the pre-Internet world can be understood in part as modulating the time domain. For instance, what if a collective moves too readily and quickly, jittering instead of settling down to provide a single answer? This happens on the most active Wikipedia entries, for example, and has also been seen in some speculation frenzies in open markets.\nOne service performed by representative democracy is low-pass filtering. Imagine the jittery shifts that would take place if a wiki were put in charge of writing laws. It's a terrifying thing to consider. Super-energized people would be struggling to shift the wording of the tax-code on a frantic, never-ending basis. The Internet would be swamped.\nSuch chaos can be avoided in the same way it already is, albeit imperfectly, by the slower processes of elections and court proceedings. The calming effect of orderly democracy achieves more than just the smoothing out of peripatetic struggles for consensus. It also reduces the potential for the collective to suddenly jump into an over-excited state when too many rapid changes to answers coincide in such a way that they don't cancel each other out. (Technical readers will recognize familiar principles in signal processing.)\nThe Wikipedia has recently slapped a crude low pass filter on the jitteriest entries, such as \"President George W. Bush.\" There's now a limit to how often a particular person can remove someone else's text fragments. I suspect that this will eventually have to evolve into an approximate mirror of democracy as it was before the Internet arrived.\nThe reverse problem can also appear. The hive mind can be on the right track, but moving too slowly. Sometimes collectives would yield brilliant results given enough time but there isn't enough time. A problem like global warming would automatically be addressed eventually if the market had enough time to respond to it, for instance. Insurance rates would climb, and so on. Alas, in this case there isn't enough time, because the market conversation is slowed down by the legacy effect of existing investments. Therefore some other process has to intervene, such as politics invoked by individuals.\nAnother example of the slow hive problem: There was a lot of technology developed slowly in the millennia before there was a clear idea of how to be empirical, how to have a peer reviewed technical literature and an education based on it, and before there was an efficient market to determine the value of inventions. What is crucial to notice about modernity is that structure and constraints were part of what sped up the process of technological development, not just pure openness and concessions to the collective.\nLet's suppose that the Wikipedia will indeed become better in some ways, as is claimed by the faithful, over a period of time. We might still need something better sooner.\nSome wikitopians explicitly hope to see education subsumed by wikis. It is at least possible that in the fairly near future enough communication and education will take place through anonymous Internet aggregation that we could become vulnerable to a sudden dangerous empowering of the hive mind. History has shown us again and again that a hive mind is a cruel idiot when it runs on autopilot. Nasty hive mind outbursts have been flavored Maoist, Fascist, and religious, and these are only a small sampling. I don't see why there couldn't be future social disasters that appear suddenly under the cover of technological utopianism. If wikis are to gain any more influence they ought to be improved by mechanisms like the ones that have worked tolerably well in the pre-Internet world.\nThe hive mind should be thought of as a tool. Empowering the collective does not empower individuals — just the reverse is true. There can be useful feedback loops set up between individuals and the hive mind, but the hive mind is too chaotic to be fed back into itself.\n***\nThese are just a few ideas about how to train a potentially dangerous collective and not let it get out of the yard. When there's a problem, you want it to bark but not bite you.\nThe illusion that what we already have is close to good enough, or that it is alive and will fix itself, is the most dangerous illusion of all. By avoiding that nonsense, it ought to be possible to find a humanistic and practical way to maximize value of the collective on the Web without turning ourselves into idiots. The best guiding principle is to always cherish individuals first.\nResponses to Lanier's essay from Douglas Rushkoff, Quentin Hardy, Yochai Benkler, Clay Shirky, Cory Doctorow, Kevin Kelly, Esther Dyson, Larry Sanger, Fernanda Viegas & Martin Wattenberg, Jimmy Wales, George Dyson, Dan Gillmor, Howard Rheingold\nNow, another big idea is taking hold, but this time it's more painful for some people to embrace, even to contemplate. It's nothing less than the migration from individual mind to collective intelligence. I call it \"here comes everybody\", and it represents, for good or for bad, a fundamental change in our notion of who we are. In other words, we are witnessing the emergence of a new kind of person.\nLately, there's been a lot of news concerning the Wikipedia and other user-generated websites such as Myspace, Flickr, and others.\nFor example, in today's Wall Street Journal \"portals\" column, Lee Gomes (\"Why Getting the User To Create Web Content Isn't Always Progress\", June 7, 2006, p B1) writes:\n\"At first, it seemed like the sort of silly, self-serving thing that many companies are wont to say about their products. Only later did I realize it represented the opening of another front in the battle against traditional culture being waged by certain parts of the technology industry.\"\n\"Mash-ups\", which allow active (vs. \"passive\") participation, is another term for \"'user-generated content', referred to by the smart set as \"UGC:\"\n...for a big part of the tech world, these sorts of mash-ups are becoming the highest form of cultural production.\nThis is most clearly occurring in books. Most of us were taught that reading books is synonymous with being civilized. But in certain tech circles, books have come to be regarded as akin to radios with vacuum tubes, a technology soon to make an unlamented journey into history's dustbin.\nThe New York Times Magazine recently had a long essay on the future of books that gleefully predicted that bookshelves and libraries will cease to exist, to be supplanted by snippets of text linked to other snippets of text on computer hard drives. Comments from friends and others would be just as important as the original material being commented on; Keats, say.\nYesterday, at a panel discussion at a Newsweek Conference on Science, Technology and Education, the moderator, Brian Williams, Anchor and Managing Editor, NBC Nightly News, spent a great deal of his time at the hour-long panel disparaging the Wikipedia.\nWilliams noted that NBC Nightly News was the largest news provider in America, reaching 9 to 12 million Americans, vastly more than any of the discrete digital audiences for websites; when he goes to his office and walks in the door, people are there and they are gathering the news. They are professionals, you know their names, and this is very different than anonymous contributors to the Wikipedia or other user-generated websites.\nOn Monday of this week, in \"Digital Publishing Is Scrambling the Industry's Rules\" (June 5, 2006,) Motoko Rich writes:\n\"Yochai Benkler, a Yale University law professor and author of the new book \"The Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom\" (Yale University Press), has gone even farther: his entire book is available — free — as a download from his Web site. Between 15,000 and 20,000 people have accessed the book electronically, with some of them adding comments and links to the online version.\n\"Mr. Benkler said he saw the project as \"simply an experiment of how books might be in the future.\" That is one of the hottest debates in the book world right now, as publishers, editors and writers grapple with the Web's ability to connect readers and writers more quickly and intimately, new technologies that make it easier to search books electronically and the advent of digital devices that promise to do for books what the iPod has done for music: making them easily downloadable and completely portable.\n\"Not surprisingly, writers have greeted these measures with a mixture of enthusiasm and dread. The dread was perhaps most eloquently crystallized last month in Washington at BookExpo, the publishing industry's annual convention, when the novelist John Updike forcefully decried a digital future composed of free downloads of books and the mixing and matching of 'snippets' of text, calling it a 'grisly scenario.' \"\nJohn Updike's comments were also reported by Bob Thompson in The Washingon Post (\"Explosive Words\", May 22, 2006, p C01):\n\"Unlike the commingled, unedited, frequently inaccurate mass of \"information\" on the Web, he said, \"books traditionally have edges.\" But \"the book revolution, which from the Renaissance on taught men and women to cherish and cultivate their individuality, threatens to end in a sparkling pod of snippets\".\n\"So, booksellers,\" he concluded, \"defend your lonely forts. Keep your edges dry. Your edges are our edges. For some of us, books are intrinsic to our human identity.\"\n***\nAbout ten years ago, the big realization (as expounded by Wired, Nicholas Negroponte, among others) was a perceptual migration from atoms to bits, from the world of the physical to the world of information.\nNow, another big idea is taking hold, but this time it's more painful for some people to embrace, even to contemplate. It's nothing less than the migration from individual mind to collective intelligence. I call it \"here comes everybody\", and it represents, for good or for bad, a fundamental change in our notion of who we are. In other words, we are witnessing the emergence of a new kind of person.\nI've been tracking this development since 1969 when I wrote in By The Late John Brockman:\n\"The mass. The human mass. The impossible agglomerate mass. The incommunicable human mass. The people.\" From their places masses move, stark as laws. Masses of what? One does not ask. There somewhere man is too, vast conglomerate of all of nature’s kingdoms, as lonely and as bound.\"* The impossible people.\n*Beckett, Molloy, p. 110\nThis isn't going away. Rather than demonize, we need to think through what's going on.\nIn this regard, no one is deeper, more thoughtful, on the social and economic effects of Internet technologies than Clay Shirky, a consultant and NYU professor. His writings, mostly web-based, are focused on the rise of decentralized technologies such as peer-to-peer, web services, and wireless networks that are leading us into a new world of user-generated content. As adjunct professor in NYU's graduate Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP), he teaches courses on the interrelated effects of social and technological network topology — how our networks shape culture and vice-versa.\nShirky commands wide respect within the user-generated web community, both for his authoritative writings as well as his leadership role as a speaker. I have reached out to him for help in organizing a serious response to Jaron Lanier's essay, and he graciously accepted. The people he assembled, a \"who's who\" of the movers, shakers, and pundits of this new universe of collective intelligence, of the \"hive mind\", have written essays that are at once unfailingly interesting, maddening, thought-provoking, depressing, and a window not to the future but to where we are today.\nI am now pleased to turn the proceedings over to Clay Shirky with warm thanks from Edge for his help in organizing this project. But before I get off the stage, one final note.\nShakespeare's snippets pound in my head, as I ask myself Banquo's question...\n\"MACBETH\n...Say from whence\nYou owe this strange intelligence? or why\nUpon this blasted heath you stop our way\nWith such prophetic greeting? Speak, I charge you.\nWitches vanish\"BANQUO\nThe earth hath bubbles, as the water has,\nAnd these are of them. Whither are they vanish'd?\"MACBETH\nInto the air; and what seem'd corporal melted\nAs breath into the wind. Would they had stay'd!\"BANQUO\nWere such things here as we do speak about?\nOr have we eaten on the insane root\nThat takes the reason prisoner?\"\n— JB\nOn \"Digital Maoism: The Hazards of the New Online Collectivism\" By Jaron Lanier\nIntroduction by Clay Shirky\nWhen Jaron Lanier's piece on \"Digital Maoism\" first went out on Edge, I knew he'd be generating hundreds of responses all over the net. After talking to John Brockman, we decided to try to capture some of the best responses here.\nLanier's piece hits a nerve because human life always exists in tension between our individual and group identities, inseparable and incommensurable. For ten years now, it's been apparent that the rise of the digital was providing enormous new powers for the individual. It's now apparent that the world's networks are providing enormous new opportunities for group action.\nUnderstanding how these cohabiting and competing revolutions connect to deep patterns of intellectual and social work is one of the great challenges of our age. The breadth and depth of the responses collected here, ranging from the broad philosophical questions to reckonings of the ground truth of particular technologies, is a testament to the complexity and subtlety of that challenge.\n— Clay Shirky\nProjects like Wikipedia do not overthrow any elite at all, but merely replace one elite — in this case an academic one — with another: the interactive media elite.\n— Douglas Rushkoff\nOur new tool for communication and computation may take us away from distinct individualism, and towards something closer to the tender nuance of folk art or the animal energy of millenarianism.\n— Quentin Hardy\nNetworked-based, distributed, social production, both individual and cooperative, offers a new system, alongside markets, firms, governments, and traditional non-profits, within which individuals can engage in information, knowledge, and cultural production. This new modality of production offers new challenges, and new opportunities. It is the polar opposite of Maoism.\n— Yochai Benkler\nThe personal computer produced an incredible increase in the creative autonomy of the individual. The internet has made group forming ridiculously easy. Since social life involves a tension between individual freedom and group participation, the changes wrought by computers and networks are therefore in tension. To have a discussion about the plusses and minuses of various forms of group action, though, is going to require discussing the current tools and services as they exist, rather than discussing their caricatures or simply wishing that they would disappear.\n— Clay Shirky\nWikipedia isn't great because it's like the Britannica. The Britannica is great at being authoritative, edited, expensive, and monolithic. Wikipedia is great at being free, brawling, universal, and instantaneous.\n— Cory Doctorow\nThe bottom-up hive mind will always take us much further that seems possible. It keeps surprising us. In this regard, the Wikipedia truly is exhibit A, impure as it is, because it is something that is impossible in theory, and only possible in practice. It proves the dumb thing is smarter than we think. At that same time, the bottom-up hive mind will never take us to our end goal. We are too impatient. So we add design and top down control to get where we want to go.\n— Kevin Kelly\nSo, to get the best results, we have people sharpening their ideas against one another rather than simply editing someone's contribution and replacing it with another. We also have a world where the contributors have identities (real or fake, but consistent and persistent) and are accountable for their words. Much like Edge, in fact.\n— Esther Dyson\nHow can both I reject epistemic collectivism and yet say that Wikipedia is a great project, which I do? Well, the problem is that epistemic collectivists like Wikipedia but for the wrong reasons. What's great about it is not that it produces an averaged view, an averaged view that is somehow better than an authoritative statement by people who actually know the subject. That's just not it at all. What's great about Wikipedia is the fact that it is a way to organize enormous amounts of labor for a single intellectual purpose.\n— Larry Sanger\nThis rich context, attached to many Wikipedia articles, is known as a \"talk page.\" The talk page is where the writers for an article hash out their differences, plan future edits, and come to agreement about tricky rhetorical points. This kind of debate doubtless happens in the New York Times and Britannica as well, but behind the scenes. Wikipedia readers can see it all, and understand how choices were made.\n— Fernanda Viegas & Matthew Wattenberg\nMy response is quite simple: this alleged \"core belief\" is not one which is held by me, nor as far as I know, by any important or prominent Wikipedians. Nor do we have any particular faith in collectives or collectivism as a mode of writing. Authoring at Wikipedia, as everywhere, is done by individuals exercising the judgment of their own minds.\n— Jimmy Wales\nLanier does not want to debate the existence or non-existence of metaphysical entities. But his argument that online collectivism produces artificial stupidity offers no reassurance to me. Real artificial intelligence (if and when) will be unfathomable to us. At our level, it may appear as dumb as American Idol, or as pointless as a nervous twitch that corrects and uncorrects Jaron Lanier's Wikipedia entry in an endless loop.\n— George Dyson\nThe debate does demonstrate how much we need to update our media literacy in a digital, distributed era. Our internal BS meters already work, but they've fallen into a low and sad level of use in the Big Media world. Many people tend to believe what they read. Others tend to disbelieve everything. Too few apply appropriate skepticism and do the additional work that true media literacy requires.\n— Dan Gillmor\nCollective action involves freely chosen self-election (which is almost always coincident with self-interest) and distributed coordination; collectivism involves coercion and centralized control; treating the Internet as a commons doesn't mean it is communist (tell that to Bezos, Yang, Filo, Brin or Page, to name just a few billionaires who managed to scrape together private property from the Internet commons).\n— Howard Rheingold",
