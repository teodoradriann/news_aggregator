    "title": "Snow flies' funky adaptations to survive (and get frisky) in the cold",
    "text": "A snow fly is seen surviving in the Cascades mountains in Washington state. The insect is capable of surviving below the freezing point of water, continuing to move until it finally freezes itself. John Tuthill hide caption\ntoggle caption John Tuthill\nThe winter is usually when insects die or go into a state of paused development, but for tiny specks on the white snow called snow flies, it’s time to run around, find a lover and make baby snow flies.\nJohn Tuthill, a professor at the University of Washington, first came across these creatures on a hike in the Cascade Mountains in late 2016. He normally studies fruit flies – which John says are “screwed” in the cold – which is why he was shocked to see that their distant cousins were able to live in such hostile conditions.\nTuthill and his colleagues slowly decreased the temperature of a cold plate to simulate the wintery conditions snow flies encounter outdoors. They found that the snow flies continued to move around until frozen, unlike other insects that entered a paralyzed, chill coma state before they were frozen.\nCredit: John Tuthill\nTuthill and his colleagues have been collecting snow flies and studying them in the lab to figure out what makes them so special. Not only can they survive in the cold, but if one of their limbs starts to freeze, they can self-amputate and pop it right off. That buys the snow fly time to find a mate and make sweet, sweet snow fly love.\n“There’s still a small chance that they’ll meet the love of their life and end up being able to procreate,” Tuthill says.\nWhen he talks about them, he sounds almost poetic.\n“For me, snow flies are just kind of a paragon of, like, fortitude and bravery,” he says. “They have figured out how to live in an environment where there’s almost no other insect. And the advantage of that is that they have a place where they can make free love on the snow with each other without interruption from predators in incredibly beautiful conditions.”\nTuthill’s lab is harnessing citizen science to continue their snow fly research. If you’re in the mountains and happen to see these spindly insects, you can collect them and send them to him. Find more information here.\nInterested in other winter biology?

    "text": "Published onThe research revealed how threat actors exploit SEO poisoning to redirect unsuspecting users to malicious e-commerce websites, leveraging multiple SEO malware families to achieve their goal.Three distinct threat actor groups were identified, each employing a unique malware family, with one group utilizing multiple families. One malware family’s C&C servers shared limited e-commerce site sets, differentiating it from others with independent lists. The proliferation of fraudulent e-commerce sites, particularly in Japan, poses a growing threat, as sites designed to deceive and exploit users have seen a significant surge in 2023, leading to increased financial losses and compromised personal information.Threat actors deploy SEO malware on compromised websites to manipulate search engine rankings by injecting malicious code into legitimate sites, redirecting unsuspecting users to fraudulent e-commerce platforms for potential financial gain. When websites are compromised, these search engine optimization malwares are installed on those websites in order to intercept web server requests and return malicious content. By doing so, threat actors can send a crafted sitemap to search engines and index-generated lure pages, which contaminates the search results, making the URLs of compromised websites appear in searches for product names they do not actually handle.",

The survival-based mode broke a million followers during its first week and still maintains hundreds of thousands.\nDespite multiple Fortnite skins getting LEGO-fied versions for the new mode, there has yet to be an official release of any LEGO sets or characters.\n This lack of product availability has forced some fans of both franchises to get creative with their own LEGO bricks. Bringing real in-game situations to life to be put on display.\n LEGO builder brings Fortnite’s NPC’s tough jobs to life Villagers play a significant role in LEGO Fortnite by gathering resources, building items, and joining the player on expeditions around the map.\nOne Redditor posted an image of the LEGO set that they had built. The inspiration? Having their villager deal with the skeletons in the caves while they collect resources.\nSubscribe to our newsletter for the latest updates on Esports, Gaming and more.\nEmail Sign up Me running away from the skeletons while my NPC does it all\nby u/angelbg34 in LEGOfortnite “I tried to do as best as I could with the pieces I had,” said the poster. “I even added a spider underneath a rock, so lifting the rock attacks you like in the game. The shield is not accurate, but I had no other shield or item. There’s even a log on the floor, a scorpion, and something to emulate the roots coming out of the walls.”\n Commenters praised the post for the build’s uncanny resemblance, with one user going so far as to declare it indistinguishable from an official LEGO set.\nRelated: Best free games to download & play on PC, PS5, Xbox, or Nintendo Switch “Honestly a sweet set,” said one user. “Looking forward to seeing you on the front page when the official minifigs release, and you can make even more scenes.”\nLEGO has yet to reveal any official merchandise or set collaborations with Fortnite. So, for now, fans will have to use the LEGOs they already have to bring the game into the real world.\nRelated Topics LEGO Fortnite About The Author Daniel Appleford Streaming and Esports Writer.
