    "text": "Secciones\nServicios\nDestacamos\nLos sindicatos con representación en las fábricas de Bridgestone en España ya tienen noticias de la multinacional, que finalmente anuló la reunión prevista para el ... pasado martes ante el enfado de la representación social por la falta de concreción de los recortes que la organización contempla para las plantas de Basauri y Puente San Miguel.\nSerá el próximo martes, 1 de abril, cuando la compañía ponga negro sobre blanco el efecto del retroceso en las ventas europeas en los últimos años, tal y como ha venido lamentando en las reuniones de seguimiento mantenidas con los sindicatos –CC OO, UGT, BUB, SITB y ELA– en estas últimas semanas.\nDichos encuentros, promovidos por los representantes de los trabajadores respecto al rumbo de Bridgestone una vez termine el Expediente de Regulación de Empleo (ERTE) que finaliza el lunes, no han arrojado mayor detalle sobre potenciales recortes, pues la organización se ha enrocado en su discurso de analizar si la situación requiere medidas coyunturales (nuevo ERTE) o estructurales, esto es, despidos. El planteamiento de los directivos, así como la aportación de diagnósticos de consultoras y la asistencia a los encuentros de abogados especializados en reestructuraciones hace pensar al comité de empresa que los despidos serán la vía por la que Bridgestone trate de adaptar su capacidad productiva.\nLas fábricas en el foco son las de Puente San Miguel y Basauri. En la instalación cántabra trabajan a día de hoy 418 empleados y está especializada en neumáticos agrícolas y de camión, precisamente los segmentos más golpeados por el mercado en los últimos años.\nSin ir más lejos, casi 400 personas se concentraron el pasado el 18 de marzo para defender el futuro de sus puestos de trabajo y reclamar a la empresa soluciones que permitieran sortear las turbulencias actuales para el sector.\nSe da la circunstancia de que el martes, mientras los sindicatos conocen los planes de Bridgestone, todos los trabajadores en teoría deberán acudir a sus puestos de trabajo dado que el ERTE ya no estará en vigor. Durante el tiempo que ha permanecido activo este ajuste temporal, que se ha venido prorrogando, la media de jornadas trabajadas al mes ronda los 13 días.\n¿Ya eres suscriptor/a?

    "text": "Responding to the data, a Home Office source said ministers expected a “zero tolerance” approach to all crimes committed by police, with forces agreeing in September to pursue “all lines of investigation for all crimes.” , without exception”.\nThe source said: “Since March, there have been record numbers of police and more than £500m extra has been invested. “These additional resources should result in a significant increase in the number of crimes solved.”\nThe figures emerge from the Telegraph’s analysis of the results of inspections of all 43 forces in 2021/22 against eight criteria.\nForces are rated on metrics including looking after their workforce, offering good value for money and treating the public with respect, but when judged solely on crime investigation, ratings fall.\nThey scored worse on these metrics than on other criteria such as crime prevention, treating the public with fairness and respect, and value for money.\nNo force was rated “outstanding” in either investigating crime or responding to the public. Outstanding is the top level of five levels of performance, which then range from good, adequate, requiring improvement, and inadequate.\nThree forces were deemed inadequate to investigate crimes and 19 of them were judged to “require improvement”. Eight were assessed as “inadequate” in their response to the public, and another 17 “required improvement.”\nThe Telegraph’s analysis was based on inspections from 2021/22, covering all 43 forces over the same period to allow a fair comparison. The actions of five forces – the Metropolitan Police, West Midlands, Devon and Cornwall, Staffordshire and Wiltshire – are so worrying that they are currently under special measures.",

    "text": "Justin’s ‘deep concern’ for being in public is the fault of his worrying appearance in New York City this week, which exacerbated even more the growing fears for their well -being, experts have affirmed.\nThe 30 -year -old singer seemed uncomfortable with a baggy yellow sweatshirt and poorly tight beige pants during a Manhattan excursion on Wednesday.\nThe images arrive in the midst of reports that their “unacceptable” behavior has exercised tension in their marriage to his wife Hailey, 28, who is said to be in a constant battle with her husband for her refusal to listen to her concerns about he.\nNow, experts have told Dailymail.com that his tired figure is the result of becoming ‘limit solcole’ after fighting with the idea of ​​large crowds or mixing with strangers after years of being in the center of attention.\n“Justin has been fighting in recent years and an important part of that is due to his concern to be in certain public situations,” said a source.\n‘It has increased a deep fear of being in spaces with many people and has a deeply rooted concern for large crowds.\nJustin’s ‘deep concern’ for being in public is to blame for his worrying appearance in New York City this week, insiders have told Dailymail.com\nThe images arrive in the midst of reports that his “unacceptable” behavior has pressed his marriage to Hailey, who is desperate for he heard his concerns about him.\n‘That is one of the reasons why he has not made any tour for a while.\n“Justin focused on trying to heal and improve himself to staying away from too many exits away from his homes, where he would have to mix with strangers, and that in turn has made it solo sometimes.”\nHis fears have affected Hailey, who has desperately trying to encourage him to overcome his concerns, with the source claiming that his recent trip to Aspen was his attempt to help him relieve him in public life.\nThey added that their extreme wealth and excessive fame have given him the ability not to have to leave his home.\n“The cost of being locked in the world is also hard,” they said. ‘It is difficult for a couple, like Hailey, who supports and wants to help him overcome these moments.\n“His recent trip to Aspen is an example of how he is encouraging him in public with close friends.”\nThey suggested that their lonely behavior is also connected to becoming a father for the first time.\nThe baby singer welcomed his son Jack with Hailey in August.\n“It has increased a deep fear of being in spaces with many people and has a deep concern for large crowds,” said the source.\nThe 30 -year -old singer seemed uncomfortable with a baggy yellow sweatshirt and poorly tight beige pants during a Manhattan excursion on Wednesday\n“He loves being at home with Jack, which affects his desire to return to work, although he has mentioned that he wants to record, the tours are a difficult question at this time,” said the source.\n‘Hailey has faced the same struggles as many new mothers too. She has her world overturned and that has meant some changes and time to adapt. It has been a challenging moment for her too.\nJustin’s health speculation gained traction following Diddy’s arrest last year. His previously close link with the dishonored rapper, the real name Sean combs, was under intense scrutiny, with fans quickly to comment on his ‘thin’ appearance.\nThe sources at that time told Dailymail.com that the combination of the consequences of Diddy’s arrest and that Justin’s new role as the first time had left him “stressed.”\nSoon the speculation of agitation between Justin and Hailey followed, which was further promoted this month when fans noticed that he no longer followed his father -in -law Stephen Baldwin on Instagram.\nDays later, he caused concern about his use of marijuana when he shared a photo of himself using a Bong, shortly before he stopped following Hailey on social networks.\nHe quickly said he had been “pirated” and dedicated himself to discarding claims of problems by publishing an image of his super model wife of his recent vacations in Aspen, Colorado, where he seemed to be recording new music.\n“Someone went to my account and stopped following my wife,” he wrote in a statement shared to his stories. ‘S *** get Soss here’.\nHis fears have affected Hailey, who has desperately trying to encourage him to overcome his concerns (in the photo together in 2024)\nThe founder of Rhode Beauty, Hailey, also seemed to control damage by sharing a photo of a sleeping Justin.\nThe musician also raised his eyebrows when he stopped following several notable names, including his mentor Usher, his former manager Braun and Ryan Good, who was the best man at his wedding, which caused speculation that he was trying to spill people from his past while focusing on new music.\nFans declared that the musician is in ‘self -destructive’ mode after the publication of the photos of the photos in their week.\nIt looks 40 years. This young man needs help. Help serious, ” a person wrote. ‘Something is eating him. It is not a sign of weakness to ask for help. He has a child to raise.\n“Too much luggage from his past, too many wolves around him when he was young,” another wrote. “We all know, and I hope it can do it.”\n‘My heart breaks for Justin … He is really self -destructive in front of our eyes,’ added a third.\nJustin has fought for the years to be in public and deal with the intense fame that was discovered by Scooter Braun as a child.\nHe signed his first record contract with RBMG the year he turned 14 and became a global superstar when he crushed the albums with the launch of his debut album, My World 2.0, two years later.\nIn 2018, a source told Us Weekly: ‘Justin has become an inmate and a person changed.\n‘He has no interest in being a celebrity and an artist.\n‘He has retired again, just as he did a couple of years ago. He started recording music, but stopped.\nJustin opened on the traps of fame, claiming that he was close to letting “destroy me completely” during an interview with Billboard in 2015.\n(Tagstotranslate) Dailymail (T) TvShowbiz",

    "title": "Samsung labour strike puts spotlight on politically-backed worker group | Company News - Business Standard",
    "text": "A labour strike in India that has disrupted production at a Samsung plant has put the spotlight on a politically-backed worker group which quietly mobilized employees of the South Korean company and now plans to extend its efforts in the country's electronics sector.The Samsung protests over low wages, now in their fifth day, cast a shadow on Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's plan of courting foreign investors to \"Make in India\" and tripling electronics production to $500 billion in six years.From Foxconn to Micron, companies have been lured to more business friendly policies and cheap labour under Modi's decade-long rule, especially as foreign manufacturing giants look to diversify their supply chains beyond the powerhouse of China.On Friday, hundreds of protesting workers wearing blue-coloured Samsung shirts continued to sit inside makeshift tents near the home appliances plant in southern state of Tamil Nadu, sporting red caps with the acronym CITU.The Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) is backed by India's most influential hard-left political party and has 6.6 million worker members. It demands worker-friendly measures, though it has historically focused more on auto sectors and companies like Hyundai.While employees at companies like Samsung can unionize on their own, partnering with groups like CITU, which was started in 1970, is seen by some workers as a way to garner more national support and get their voice better heard by companies.With the Samsung strike, CITU is now planning to make inroads into the electronics manufacturing sector which is growing at a rapid pace but where companies \"are not doing wage revisions properly,\" said S Kannan, its Tamil Nadu deputy general secretary.\"There is no opportunity for collective bargaining either,\" he added.A strike of this scale - which impacts production - is not common in India's electronics industry. Previous notable ones include worker unrests at iPhone factories of suppliers Wistron and Foxconn during 2021, where unpaid wages and a food poisoning incident were triggers, respectively.CITU has plans to push for more worker rights at Apple supplier Flex and electronics firm Sanmina where it has been in talks with the management for demands including union recognition and better wages, Kannan said.Flex in a statement said it upholds highest global standards for labor practices and believe in a respectful and collaborative environment.The prime minister's office, the federal IT ministry, the Tamil Nadu labor ministry, and Sanmina did not respond to Reuters queries.DIRE SITUATIONThe Samsung strike is one of biggest industrial unrests to have caused production disruptions at a foreign multinational company. The plant alone accounts for around a third of its annual $12 billion India revenue.While workers protest, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin has been on a U.S. tour since late August and held talks with companies such as Nike and Ford.In Samsung's case, the CITU privately wrote a letter in July - seen by Reuters - asking the its management for higher wages for workers who it said were forced into a \"dire situation\".When the company didn't agree, CITU supported workers to start a strike this week, which is also serving as a challenge to companies the group says pay low wages to poor workers.Samsung workers are earning 25,000 rupees ($300) on average per month, CITU said, and they are demanding a raise of 36,000 rupees ($430) over three years. One worker outside the plant said he joined Samsung a decade ago and makes only 23,000 rupees a month, which made life difficult with soaring living costs.\"Instances of strikes could be reduced if government ensures a mechanism for multinationals to respect the labour laws including freedom of association and collective bargaining,\" said K.R. Shyam Sundar, an economist who has written on labour reforms in India.In a statement on Friday, Samsung said it has initiated discussions with its workers at the Chennai plant \"to resolve all issues at the earliest.\".storycontent div {margin:10px 0;}",
