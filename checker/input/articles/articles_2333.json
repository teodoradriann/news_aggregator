    "title": "Los sindicatos protestan por la falta de personal en la Seguridad Social, con 5.000 vacantes desiertas",
    "text": "CSIF, CCOO y CIG se han concentrado este viernes ante el Ministerio de Inclusión, Seguridad Social y Migraciones para protestar por las \\\"difíciles\\\" condiciones de la plantilla de la Seguridad Social, personal funcionario y personal laboral. Los sindicatos denuncian el incremento \\\"permanente\\\" de las cargas de trabajo del personal de la Seguridad Social y sus dificultades \\\"por constantes modificaciones normativas y novedades en la gestión telemática y organizativa\\\". Paco Riesgo, representante de CSIF en la Seguridad Social, ha denunciado durante la concentración que actualmente están sin cubrir más de 5.000 puestos de trabajo en todo el territorio nacional, de los que 4.700 son puestos de oficina, normalmente de atención al público. \\\"Tenemos escasez de plantillas con una saturación brutal de trabajo. (...) Esto afecta al ciudadano, que se merece y quiere y tiene su derecho a ser perfectamente atendido (...) Necesitamos plantillas estables y profesionalizadas\\\", ha reivindicado Riesgo. Esta concentración forma parte del calendario de movilizaciones que han diseñado CSIF, CCOO y CIG en la Seguridad Social en todo el territorio nacional por el \\\"incumplimiento sistemático\\\" por parte del Ministerio de los acuerdos firmados en mayo de 2023 y noviembre de 2018, en los que establecen las condiciones iniciales para la implantación de un plan estratégico de recursos humanos en la Administración de la Seguridad Social. \\\"CSIF, CCOO y CIG, que representamos al 67,81% del personal público de la Administración General del Estado, denunciamos las difíciles condiciones en que tienen que realizar su trabajo la plantilla de la Seguridad Social (...) Un personal que en estas difíciles condiciones realiza el mejor servicio público que puede prestar, con responsabilidad, pero sin ser agradecido ni reconocido\\\", subrayan los sindicatos. Los sindicatos piden, entre otras medidas, que se aborde, con carácter prioritario, la ordenación de recursos humanos en la Seguridad Social mediante la reorganización y actualización de la relación de puestos de trabajo e identificación de áreas funcionales y de puestos con trabajo a distancia y/o con lengua cooficial propia. Asimismo, reclaman la convocatoria urgente de un concurso para cubrir la totalidad de puestos de trabajo vacantes o con ocupación provisional afectando a los niveles 22 e inferiores, antes de la resolución de cualquier Oferta de Empleo Público, priorizando la promoción interna ante la oferta libre. Además, CSIF, CCOO y CIG piden la cobertura definitiva de las plazas ocupadas provisionalmente por los procedimientos legalmente establecidos, cumpliendo con los compromisos de la Unión Europea en cuanto a reducción de la temporalidad en el sector público hasta un máximo del 8% de la plantilla, así como la creación de bolsas de trabajo específicas en el ámbito de la Administración de la Seguridad Social. Al mismo tiempo, instan a que, de manera voluntaria, se permita teletrabajar dos días a la semana en todas las Entidades Gestoras y Servicios Comunes de la Seguridad Social, con vocación de ir ampliando los días a tres o más semanales, en línea con el modelo implantado para el resto de personal dependiente del Ministerio y del resto de Departamentos Ministeriales donde se asumen funciones de igual o similares características. En materia salarial, demandan la revisión de complementos específicos y retribuciones ligadas al cargo, entre otras medidas. \\\"Estos sindicatos abogamos por que la Seguridad Social preste un servicio público eficiente y una atención a la ciudadanía de calidad y, por ello, iniciamos estas movilizaciones hasta que el secretario de Estado de la Seguridad Social y Pensiones, Borja Suárez, cumpla el acuerdo que él mismo firmó (en mayo de 2023)\\\", concluyen.",

    "text": "[geralt](https://pixabay.com/users/geralt/)/ Pixabay [Escalating conflict on Lebanon-Israel border raises humanitarian concerns](#) UN officials [warned](https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/09/1154921) of a rapidly deteriorating humanitarian crisis in Lebanon on Thursday as death tolls mounted from Israeli air strikes. On Wednesday, advocacy group Human Rights Watch [called](https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/09/25/lebanon-israeli-strikes-kill-hundreds-hostilities-escalate) for urgent UN action, reporting that some 1,600 Israeli strikes had killed at least 558 people, including 50 children, and injured thousands in the span of two days. The organization’s Middle East and North Africa director, Lama Fakih, urged compliance with international law to protect civilians, saying: The Israeli military killed hundreds of people in Lebanon in just one day; thousands have been injured and forced to flee from their homes, and hundreds of homes, businesses, and farms have been destroyed. … It is paramount for Israel and Hezbollah to comply with the laws of war to minimize civilian harm. As the UN’s refugee agency revealed Thursday that some 90,000 Lebanese residents had been displaced in the span of 72 hours, the organization’s head of peacekeeping operations Jean-Pierre Lacroix painted a grim picture of [chaos](https://soundcloud.com/unradio/un-peacekeeping-chief-pierre-lacroix-26sep2024) along the UN-patrolled line of separation between Lebanon and Syria. And UN Secretary-General António Guterres [warned](https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/09/1154896) the Security Council of unprecedented exchanges of fire amid mounting concerns of a broader regional war. Leaders from across North America, Europe, East Asia, and the Middle East called for a 21-day ceasefire and compliance with UN Security Council resolutions aimed at brokering an end to regional hostilities in [Lebanon](http://unscr.com/en/resolutions/1701#google_vignette) and [Gaza](https://press.un.org/en/2024/sc15723.doc.htm). The leaders said in a joint statement: We call on all parties, including the Governments of Israel and Lebanon, to endorse the temporary ceasefire immediately consistent with UNSCR 1701 during this period, and to give a real chance to a diplomatic settlement. We are then prepared to fully support all diplomatic efforts to conclude an agreement between Lebanon and Israel within this period, building on efforts over the last months, that ends this crisis altogether. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz struck a defiant tone Thursday, [asserting](https://twitter.com/Israel_katz/status/1839229451692872019) via social media: “There will be no ceasefire in the north.” Israel has faced [growing](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/01/israel-must-comply-with-key-icj-ruling-ordering-it-do-all-in-its-power-to-prevent-genocide-against-palestinians-in-gaza/) international calls to respect international humanitarian law in recent months, amid reports of devastating civilian death tolls in Gaza, where it has been engaged in a ground war with terror organization Hamas for nearly a year, and, more recently, Lebanon. It faces ongoing [charges](https://www.icj-cij.org/case/192) of genocide against the people of Palestine before the International Court of Justice.",

    "title": "Jury weighing fate of Pottstown man accused in gunshot slaying of Parkesburg man",
    "text": "NORRISTOWN — The fate of a Pottstown man accused of fatally shooting an unarmed Chester County man with whom he had an angry exchange during a child custody transfer is in the hands of a jury.\nKevin Maurice Morgan, 35, of the 500 block of May Street, showed no outward emotion on Thursday as testimony wrapped up at his trial at which he’s charged with first- and third-degree murder, voluntary manslaughter, possessing an instrument of crime, recklessly endangering other persons and endangering the welfare of children in connection with the alleged 7:13 p.m. June 27, 2023, fatal shooting of Derek Mayo, 38, of Parkesburg.\nThe jury of six men and six women began deliberations at 1 p.m. after hearing the closing arguments of Assistant District Attorney Allison Ruth and defense lawyer John Han and receiving legal instructions from Judge William R. Carpenter.\nA conviction of first-degree murder, which is an intentional killing, carries a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment.\nA conviction of third-degree murder, a killing committed with malice, or a hardness of heart, cruelty or recklessness of consequences, carries a possible maximum sentence of 20 to 40 years in prison.\nRuth argued Morgan had the specific intent to kill, a requirement for a first-degree murder conviction, when he fired a single gunshot at Mayo, mortally wounding him in the chest.\n“He used a deadly weapon on the vital part of the body. He chose to murder an unarmed man in front of his 12-year-old daughter,” Ruth argued during her closing statement to jurors, adding the “specific intent to kill” can be formed in an instant. “This can happen quickly. We’re here because of one person and one person only, and that’s the defendant.”\nThe fatal shooting occurred in the area of May and Hale streets, a short distance from Morgan’s home in Pottstown, as Morgan was transferring custody of his 12-year-old daughter to her mother, Kelsay Love-Sheller. Mayo, who was dating Love-Sheller, was a passenger in Love-Sheller’s vehicle and a confrontation erupted between Mayo and Morgan at that time, according to testimony.\nKevin Morgan is escorted from a Montgomery County courtroom on June 11, 2024, during a break at his homicide trial. (Photo by Carl Hessler Jr. – MediaNews Group) Ruth and co-prosecutor Courtney McMonagle argued Morgan not only intended to kill Mayo but he put others’ lives in danger too, referring to two children and two other adults who were present during the shooting. Morgan’s 12-year-old daughter and a child shared by Mayo and Love-Sheller also were in Love-Sheller’s vehicle at the time of the shooting.\nBut Han suggested Morgan believed Mayo was armed and that Morgan acted in self-defense when Mayo got out of the vehicle and charged at him while stating, “You want some of this?” and grabbing at his waist area as if he had a gun. Han argued Morgan acted to stop Mayo from doing harm to his family, referring to Morgan’s pregnant wife, Julise, who also was present during the custody transfer.\n“This isn’t about ill will or hatred of Derek Mayo. His focus was on protecting his family,” Han argued during his closing statement to jurors.\nWhen Morgan testified in his own defense on Wednesday, he claimed he believed Mayo was reaching for a gun at his waist and he reacted by pulling out his gun and shooting one time during the altercation.\nHan argued prosecutors did not present sufficient evidence that Morgan acted with a specific intent to kill. Han asked the jury to consider a charge of voluntary manslaughter, which occurs when a person causes the death of another person while acting under a sudden heat of passion following serious provocation.\nA conviction of voluntary manslaughter carries a possible maximum sentence of 10 to 20 years in prison.\n“The actions of Mr. Morgan were of someone who was overwrought by sudden fear and terror,” Han argued.\nBut Ruth argued Mayo did not provoke the attack and that the facts and evidence did not support a finding of manslaughter.\nMorgan testified he didn’t expect Mayo, with whom he had heated exchanges in the past, to be accompanying Love-Sheller to the custody transfer. Morgan claimed Mayo had threatened him in the past.\nKevin Morgan, of Pottstown, is escorted by a deputy sheriff from a Montgomery County courtroom where he was arraigned on homicide charges. (Carl Hessler Jr. – MediaNews Group) Han explained Morgan had a license to legally carry a firearm and carried one since experiencing a “traumatic, horrific event” in January 2012 when he witnessed the fatal shooting of his childhood friend after a night out at a West Chester bar.\nMorgan, who cooperated as a prosecution witness against the person convicted of that homicide in Chester County Court in 2013, testified he suffered Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and anxiety after that incident and lived with a fear that somebody was going to harm him. Morgan told the jury that he carried a gun ever since.\n“He never left the house without the gun. Having the gun was his only sense of security,” Han argued.\nRuth argued Morgan’s involvement in the 2013 Chester County case and his self-professed fear afterward were not relevant to the killing of Mayo.\n“That’s not a defense to murdering an unarmed man a decade later,” Ruth argued.\nThe investigation began about 7:13 p.m. June 27 when Pottstown police responded to a report of a shooting in the 500 block of May Street. A 911 call was made by Love-Sheller, who reported that her boyfriend, Mayo, had been shot, according to a criminal complaint filed by county Detective James Lavin and Pottstown Detective Adrian Stead.\nArriving officers found Mayo lying in the roadway on Hale Street just south of May Street, between the curb and the passenger side of Love-Sheller’s Kia Optima vehicle, “suffering an obvious gunshot wound to the chest,” Lavin and Stead wrote in the criminal complaint.\nDetectives noted that Mayo “was not armed with any type of weapon.”\nLavin testified that no fired cartridge casings were recovered at the scene. Lavin added there were no weapons found in Love-Sheller’s vehicle during a search.\nLove-Sheller approached police at the scene and pointed to Morgan’s May Street home and said, “My baby dad just shot him, he’s in that house,” according to the criminal complaint.\nKevin Maurice Morgan, accused of gunshot slaying of Parkesburg man, is escorted by sheriff’s deputies from a Montgomery County courtroom on June 10, 2024 to await the resumption of his homicide trial. (Photo by Carl Hessler Jr. – MediaNews Group) Love-Sheller testified there was a history of tension between Morgan and Mayo. She said that when Morgan approached her vehicle and placed their daughter in the rear passenger seat during the custody exchange he observed Mayo in the front passenger seat and immediately began berating Mayo.\nLove-Sheller testified Morgan refused to close the rear passenger door so she moved her vehicle forward in order to distance Morgan from her vehicle so the door could close. Mayo then asked Love-Sheller to stop the vehicle and he exited the vehicle, according to testimony.\n“Derek stood outside the car and two seconds later he got shot,” Love-Sheller testified.\nA witness to the shooting told detectives the victim did not make any motion during the argument that warranted “that response by the shooter,” according to court documents.\nMorgan retreated to his residence after the shooting.\nMorgan complied with police commands to come out of his residence and when he was asked “Where is the gun?” Morgan replied, “In the house,” according to the arrest affidavit.\nDuring an initial search of the home, police found two semi-automatic handguns in a second-floor bedroom.\nAfter a search warrant was obtained, police found a total of six guns in the house, five of them semi-automatic pistols, according to the affidavit of probable cause.\nDetectives testified one of the guns, a Taurus G2C, was found with an empty cartridge jammed in the barrel. Authorities alleged the Taurus was the murder weapon.\nMorgan allegedly made several statements to the first responding officers that it was “self-defense,” according to court papers.",

    "text": "Tears well up in the eyes of Alison Welch Wednesday afternoon as she sits in front of the Dutch Treat, the family business she has worked at since she was 14 years old. She has decided not to open for the season this year. The restaurant sits high on a hill overlooking Route 3 in Wilton. Russ Dillingham/Sun Journal\nWILTON — The Dutch Treat, an ice cream and fast-food eatery that sits on a hill with a landmark windmill overlooking U.S. Route 2 and state Route 4, will not open this season.\nThat means no cruise-ins, craft fairs or other activities usually held there over the spring and summer months.\n“After a long hard process, we have decided not to open this year,” Alison Welch of Wilton said Tuesday. “It was not an easy decision to make.”\nWelch has run the business since 2007 for her mother, Sharon Rainey.\nThere are multiple reasons it will not be opening, she said.\nThe rising cost of food and other related expenses, including increases in the minimum wage, and getting and keeping employees for the seasonal jobs, are among those reasons.\n“It is the whole business aspect,” she said.\nWelch also has a full-time job at the Mt. Blue Regional School District in Farmington.\nTeenagers and young adults typically work at the seasonal business. Teenagers need time off for sports and other activities, she said.\nThe Dutch Treat sits high on a hill off Route 4 in Wilton. Russ Dillingham/Sun Journal\nSharon Rainey and her sister, Gloria, and their husbands started the business in 1963. Rainey and her husband, the late Robert “Bud” Rainey, later bought the business from Rainey’s sister.\nWelch’s grandfather, Kenneth Foster, the namesake of Foster Career and Technical Education Center at Mt. Blue Campus in Farmington, bought the land decades ago. It was his idea to build an A-frame at the site after a trip to the Netherlands.\nWelch started working at the establishment when she was 14.\nThe business typically opens in April and closes after Labor Day. Families have flocked to the site with children playing on the swing set, eating under a canopy at picnic tables or inside the windmill base.\nThe family has not made a decision about opening next year, Welch said.\nThe closure, so far, is just for this year, she said.",

'Transformers One', vuelven los Autobots, esta vez en versión animada. La nueva entrega de Transformers llega en forma de película de animación, con las voces de Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Lawrence Fisburne y Steve Buscemi, con Josh Cooley en la dirección, responsable de 'Toy Story 4'. 'Transformers One' transporta al espectador al planeta natal de los Transformers, Cybertron, en una precuela en la que muestra el origen de la enemistad entre Optimus Prime (Chris Hemsworth) y Megatron (Brian Tyree Henry), tras salvar juntos su hogar. 'Puntos suspensivos', una batalla interpretativa entre José Coronado y Diego Peretti. David Marqués ofrece este thriller después de sus últimas incursiones en comedia ('En temporada baja', 'El club del paro') con protagonistas de la talla de José Coronado y Diego Peretti, las figuras principales de un film basado en la interpretación de ambos. Leo (Diego Peretti) es un escritor que publica bajo un pseudónimo y del que nadie conoce su verdadera identidad, más allá de su agente, Victoria (Cecilia Suárez). Se encuentra recluido en un solitario chalet mientras trabaja en su nueva novela, y recibe la inesperada visita de Jota (José Coronado), que de algún modo conoce demasiados secretos sobre su vida privada, lo que llevará a un enfrentamiento dialéctico entre ambos intérpretes. 'Marcello mio', Chiara Mastroiani contra el peso de la figura de su padre. La hija del cineasta italiano se cansa de soportar la presión de su apellido y decide convertirse en su propio padre, para sorpresa de todos sus allegados, que piensan que se trata de una broma, pero que empieza a llegar demasiado lejos. Estrenada en la sección oficial del Festival de Cannes 2024, y dirigida por Cristophe Honoré ('Vivir deprisa, amar despacio'), la cinta cuenta, además de con Chiara Mastroiani, con su madre, Catherine Deneuve, Melvil Poupaud y Fabrice Lucchini. 'Sólo para mí', el terror de la cotidianidad de los malos tratos. Presentada en el festival de Cannes 2023, y con más de 700.000 entradas vendidas en Francia, la directora francesa Valérie Donzelli ('Declaración de Guerra') ofrece esta adaptación libre de la novela 'El amor y los bosques', de Eric Reinhart, en la que el abuso y el maltrato psicológico convierten la película en una cruda historia por lo cotidiano y lo habitual de las escenas que representa. Virginie Efira y Melvil Poupaud, estrellas del cine francés, interpretan a Blanche y Grégoire, respectivamente. Ella, una mujer sofisticada que se acerca a los 40 y que no ha encontrado al amor de su vida, y él, un seductor y misterioso soltero, amigo de la infancia de Blanche, entablan una relación que se va degradando por los abusos de Grégoire, hasta llevar al límite a Blanche, en un film heredero del terror psicológico de Hitchcock. Juega o muere', una nueva píldora de terror adolescente. Natalia Dyer ('Stranger Things') y Asa Butterfield ('La invención de Hugo') protagonizan esta nueva muestra de cine de terror adolescente, en la primera película dirigida por Elen Celeboglu ('Scrubs') junto a Ari Costa. Un objeto maldito obligará a un grupo de adolescentes del pueblo de Salem a jugar a versiones violentas de juegos infantiles para poder sobrevivir. 'Topuria: Matador', el camino para llegar a ser campeón del mundo. Un documental que detalla el camino recorrido por Ilia Topuria, junto a su familia, amigos y cuerpo técnico hasta alcanzar su sueño de convertirse en el campeón del mundo de peso pluma de Artes Marciales Mixtas en la UFC. El sacrificio, el afán de superación, el trabajo, la constancia y una buena dosis de autoconfianza, son los mensajes de esta producción, que muestra los momentos más íntimos de la estrella hispano-georgiana de la lucha.

    "text": "Juba (Agencia Fides) - \"La desaparición del P. Luke Yugue y de su acompañante se debe situar en el triste contexto de la violencia intercomunitaria entre los Azande y los Balanda que ha vuelto a estallar después del grave conflicto de 2021\" dice a la Agencia Fides la Hermana Elena Balatti, misionera comboniana en Sudán del Sur, refiriéndose al joven sacerdote desaparecido con su acompañante, Michael Gbeko, el 27 de abril, en Tombura, en el Estado de Equatoria Occidental. Los azande son el grupo étnico mayoritario en Ecuatoria Occidental, mientras que los balanda son un grupo numéricamente importante en la misma región, pero también tienen presencia en el estado vecino de Bahr el Ghazal Occidental\", explica la Hna. Elena. \"Tras años de coexistencia pacífica, en 2021 surgieron tensiones políticas, entre otras cosas por la demarcación de las fronteras territoriales entre las dos tribus; tensiones que desembocaron en un sangriento conflicto, con el desplazamiento de miles de personas. Desde entonces, el conflicto se ha calmado, pero no ha remitido del todo, y en febrero/marzo de este año, las Naciones Unidas habían observado un resurgimiento de las tensiones, lo que provocó, desgraciadamente, el asesinato de algunas personas, nuevos desplazamientos y nueva violencia, que fue contenida en parte por los militares\", informa la misionera. “La desaparición del padre Luke se inscribe en este contexto de odio y violencia”, afirma la hermana Elena. “El padre Luke, de etnia azande, desapareció el 27 de abril en una zona predominantemente de etnia balanda, donde ejercía su ministerio. Desde el principio se especuló con el asesinato del sacerdote y de su chófer. Sin embargo, Mons. Edward Hiiboro Kussala, obispo de Tombura-Yambio, había pedido a los fieles que rezaran sin cesar por el regreso de los dos, y al parecer, ahora que el obispo ha anunciado una oración fúnebre por ambos (véase Fides 23/5/2024), probablemente ha confirmado lo que algunos medios de comunicación locales ya habían informado, que se trataba de un doble asesinato”, afirma la misionera. La hermana Elena concluye pidiendo “que recemos para que este conflicto interétnico, instrumentalizado por los políticos (estamos en periodo pre-electoral en Sudán del Sur), no se renueve con las proporciones de la violencia de 2021”.

    "text": "Maine teen with autism finds success with dog cookie business WALDOBORO, Maine (WABI) - Landen Stewart of Waldoboro was just 3-years-old when he was diagnosed with autism. He’s nonverbal and is also living with a genetic disorder called Fragile X Syndrome, which can cause a range of developmental problems. Now 18, the Medomak Valley High School senior has a few new skills under his belt thanks to his new business, [K9 Kookies.](https://www.k9kookiesonline.com/) Most afternoons after school, you can find Landen sitting at his dining room table with the music cranked up, filling orders of homemade dog cookies. Each one is shaped like a puzzle piece, a symbol for autism. “He helps us with the baking,” said his mom, Danielle Stewart. “That’s not his favorite thing. He doesn’t love to get his hands dirty, so that is a work in progress, but he does all the labeling and all the packaging,” she added. “There’s just limited opportunities for adults with his abilities, so we wanted to find something that he would be passionate about doing.” [K9 Kookies](https://www.k9kookiesonline.com/shop) was born last summer and has really taken off thanks to social media. These days, Landen makes his peanut butter and pumpkin dog treats with help from a furry assistant, a three-month-old Mini Goldendoodle. The family plans to use the proceeds from K9 Kookies to help send Piper to training so she can become a certified service dog for Landen. That process can be quite costly. “We’re going to have to sell a lot of cookies,” Danielle said. Landen has developed several skills in this business. He’s also learning how to interact with his local community. In addition to his online shop, Landen’s creations can be found at 11 Maine stores. “I’m not sure what number store it was, but my husband and I were meeting the owners of the store, so we shook his hand and Landen just independently stuck his hand out to shake his hand, too. My husband and I just looked at each other with our mouths gaped open because we were like, “Oh my word!” From observing us, he picked up that skill, and he has done it several times now. He’s learning more skills that really what we anticipated,” Stewart said. “We just want to give him the skills to communicate, and if he can advocate for himself. You can’t give up. They’re your kids.” Copyright 2024 WABI. All rights reserved.",
