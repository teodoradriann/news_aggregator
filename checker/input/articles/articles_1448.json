    "text": "Massive California waves injure some onlookers and bring flooding, treacherous beach conditions up the West coast A powerful offshore storm is driving towering waves into the California coastline, triggering flooding and warnings of dangerous and damaging swells after several people were injured by a wave along Ventura beach on Thursday. Video above: Large Santa Cruz waves toss kids The wave crashed over a barrier along the southern California beach, tossing a wall of fast-moving water at a group of onlookers who rushed to escape the deluge, witness video shows. Seawater quickly knocked some people off their feet and pummeled cars as drivers tried to speed away. Nearly 20 people were briefly swept away in the incident and eight people were taken to the hospital, Ventura officials said. High water and dangerous rip currents will churn along some of California’s beaches through the weekend as much of the West coast – spanning from the U.S.-Mexico border to southern Oregon – is under coastal flood and high-surf alerts, the National Weather Service said. Waves as high as telephone poles – about 40 feet – could slam into San Francisco through Friday morning. Fifteen to 20-foot waves are expected along the central coast. The dangerous conditions pose an “exceptional risk” of ocean drowning and damage to structures like piers and jetties, the National Weather Service said. The spectacular waters have enthralled some surfers and onlookers, but weather officials are cautioning that the waves and strong rip tides can be perilous for those nearby. “Large breaking waves can cause injury, wash people off beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats near shore,” the National Weather Service warned. At least one fisherman fell overboard in a harbor off Oxnard and later came ashore uninjured, the Ventura County Fire Department said. The conditions have already caused some road closures and evacuations in coastal California communities and prompted the rescue of five campers along the San Luis Obispo coast. Crews in Ventura worked through the night to reinforce a mile-long sand barrier that was damaged by powerful waters on Thursday, the local fire department said. Standing about seven feet tall, the raised wall helps protect beachside communities. Hoping to discourage spectators, local officials closed a main access point to Ventura Pier, which saw a swell of about 20 feet on Thursday. Some coastal streets in the area have also been closed as a precaution. In central California’s Santa Cruz, the sheriff’s office [issued ](https://www.facebook.com/SantaCruzSheriffsOffice/)an evacuation warning for some areas on Thursday, sister station [KSBW](https://www.ksbw.com/article/santa-cruz-flooding-and-evacuations/46243230) reported. The warnings were lifted later in the day. The most extreme impacts were expected along the central and Ventura County coasts, along with Hermosa, Manhattan and Palos Verdes beaches, the weather service in Los Angeles said Thursday. Tempestuous waters are also battering Northern California, where the Bay Area could see waves of 28 to 33 feet, the weather service advised. A high wind alert is also in effect for the Bay Area on Friday as wind gusts of up to 50 mph are expected. Rainfall is likely to stretch northward from the Bay Area throughout the day Friday before shifting south into the weekend. Massive waves attract surfers to Mavericks Despite safety warnings, the massive waves are a welcome sight to surfers hungry to tackle the legendary swells at Mavericks Beach, about 25 miles south of San Francisco. Pro surfers and spectators flocked to the beach on Thursday for a competition at the site known for having [some of the biggest waves](https://www.visithalfmoonbay.org/articles/mavericks-biggest-surf-west-coast) in the world, CNN affiliate KGO reported. Local resident Ion Banner [told the affiliate](https://abc7news.com/mavericks-surf-ca-storm-waves-at-today-weather-half-moon-bay/14235785/) that surfers from Brazil, Tahiti and Hawaii were out in the water. “It’s pretty gnarly, it’s super big,” he said. “The waves looked absolutely massive and it was everything that we expected,” said Miguel Blanco, who told KGO he flew in from Portugal to surf the waves. “It was really big, I’d say 40-60 foot waves.” Mavericks’ jaw-dropping waves – caused by unique underwater rock formations – reach their biggest heights in the winter, when big wave surfers from all over the world make pilgrimages to face the swells. The legendary waves and the surfers who brave them have been the subject of several films and documentaries, including the 2012 biopic “Chasing Mavericks” about American surfer Jay Moriarity’s journey to surf Mavericks as a teen. On Thursday, the conditions were prime for surfers like Blanco. “If it’s your turn, you just gotta go,” Blanco said. “When you see a big wave, you’re kinda scared but at the same time you’re feeling like you should go and you just go and enjoy the ride.” CNN’s David Williams contributed to this report.",

    "text": "India's Best Colleges 2025\nAjit Pawar opposes teaching Hindi from class 1 in Maharashtra schools\nThe state clarified that Hindi would not be mandatory. However, to offer any Indian language other than Hindi, at least 20 students in a class must request it\nAjit Pawar has voiced his opposition to the recent move to introduce Hindi from Class 1 in Maharashtra schools. Speaking to the media in Mumbai, he stressed the importance of allowing children to focus on Marathi from the start of their education, suggesting that Hindi should be introduced only from Class 5 onwards.\nHis comments come in response to a revised directive issued by the state government last week, which proposed that Hindi be offered as a third language in Marathi and English medium schools from Classes 1 to 5. The announcement stirred debate, particularly around the age at which a third language should be introduced in the school curriculum.\nThe state clarified that Hindi would not be mandatory. However, to offer any Indian language other than Hindi, at least 20 students in a class must request it — a clause that has sparked further criticism.\nReferring to a recent high-level meeting on the subject, Pawar expressed concerns about the added academic pressure on young pupils. He remarked that children should begin their schooling with Marathi to ensure they become confident in reading and writing their mother tongue before taking on additional languages.\nHe acknowledged that there is no objection to learning different languages in principle, but emphasised that introducing too many subjects too early can place an unnecessary burden on young learners.\nFollowing the meeting led by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, it was stated that the government would reach a final decision on the matter only after consulting language scholars, educators, cultural figures, and political representatives.\nActor Sayaji Shinde also joined the discussion, backing the view that Hindi should not be taught from Class 1. He underlined the importance of giving priority to Marathi in early education, describing it as a language with deep cultural and literary value. Shinde urged the government to reconsider the decision and avoid imposing an extra language on students too early in their academic journey.",

    "title": "China: Carmakers Implicated In Uyghur Forced Labor, Says HRW – Eurasia Review",
    "text": "China: Carmakers Implicated In Uyghur Forced Labor, Says HRW Global carmakers, including General Motors, Tesla, BYD, Toyota, and Volkswagen, are failing to minimize the risk of Uyghur forced labor being used in their aluminum supply chains, Human Rights Watch said in a report released Thursday. The 99-page report, [“Asleep at the Wheel: Car Companies’ Complicity in Forced Labor in China,”](https://www.hrw.org/node/387181) finds that some carmakers have succumbed to Chinese government pressure to apply weaker human rights and responsible sourcing standards at their Chinese joint ventures than in their global operations, increasing the risk of exposure to forced labor in Xinjiang. Most have done too little to map their aluminum supply chains and identify links to forced labor. “Car companies simply don’t know the extent of their links to forced labor in Xinjiang in their aluminum supply chains,” said Jim Wormington, senior researcher and advocate for corporate accountability at Human Rights Watch. “Consumers should know their cars might contain materials linked to forced labor or other abuses in Xinjiang.” The link between Xinjiang, a region in northwestern China, the aluminum industry, and forced labor is the Chinese government-backed labor transfer programs, which coerce Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims into jobs in Xinjiang and other regions. Human Rights Watch reviewed online Chinese state media articles, company reports, and government statements and found credible evidence that aluminum producers in Xinjiang are participating in labor transfers. Human Rights Watch also uncovered evidence that fossil fuel companies that supply coal to aluminum producers in Xinjiang have received labor transfer workers at their coal mines. Xinjiang’s aluminum smelters depend on the region’s abundant and highly polluting coal supplies to fuel the energy-intensive process of aluminum production. In 2023, domestic and foreign manufacturers in China produced and exported more cars than any other country. Since 2017, the Chinese government has committed [crimes against humanity](https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/04/19/break-their-lineage-break-their-roots/chinas-crimes-against-humanity-targeting) in Xinjiang, including arbitrary detention, enforced disappearances, and cultural and religious persecution, and has subjected Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslim communities to forced labor inside and outside Xinjiang. The Chinese government has sought to make Xinjiang an industrial hub even as it expanded abuses against Uyghurs. Xinjiang’s aluminum production has grown from approximately one million tons in 2010 to six million tons in 2022. More than 15 percent of the aluminum produced in China, or 9 percent of global supply, now comes from the region. Aluminum is used in dozens of automotive parts, from engine blocks and vehicle frames to wheels and electric battery foils, which are both used by manufacturers in China and exported to global carmakers. Most of Xinjiang’s aluminum is shipped out of the region and mixed with other metals to make aluminum alloys in other parts of China, including for the car industry. Once an aluminum ingot has been melted and mixed with other materials, it is impossible to determine whether or how much of it came from Xinjiang, enabling tainted aluminum to enter domestic and global supply chains undetected. Aluminum ingots from Xinjiang are bought and sold by commodities traders, further obscuring the links between Xinjiang and supply chains. Glencore, a global commodities trader, told Human Rights Watch it purchases aluminum from a Xinjiang-based smelter for sale to domestic customers in China but stated that “we recognize the risks of forced labor associated with Xinjiang” and said it had conducted due diligence at the supplier’s facilities in Xinjiang. Car companies have a responsibility under the United Nations [Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/publications/guidingprinciplesbusinesshr_en.pdf) to identify, prevent, and mitigate the presence of forced labor and other human rights abuses in their supply chains. The high level of repression and surveillance in Xinjiang, including threats to workers and auditors, makes it impossible for companies to credibly investigate allegations of forced labor and consider potential remediation. Car companies should instead map their supply chains and disengage from any supplier found to source parts or materials from Xinjiang. Some carmakers contend that because they do not operate or control their Chinese joint ventures, they are less able to address the joint ventures’ supply chain links to Xinjiang. Volkswagen, which holds 50 percent of the equity in its joint venture with SAIC, a Chinese carmaker, told Human Rights Watch it is not legally responsible for human rights impacts in their joint venture’s supply chain under Germany’s supply chain law because the law only covers subsidiaries in which companies have “decisive influence.” German government guidance, however, sets out a range of criteria for determining whether a company has “decisive influence,” including “whether the subsidiary manufactures and exploits the same products or provides the same services as the parent company.” SAIC-Volkswagen manufactures cars for the Chinese market under the Volkswagen brand. The law also applies to Volkswagen’s direct suppliers, which could include SAIC-Volkswagen. Companies in joint ventures also have a responsibility under the UN Guiding Principles to use their leverage to address the risk of forced labor in the joint venture’s supply chain. Volkswagen said that the company “assumes responsibility … to use its leverage over its Chinese joint ventures to address the risk of human rights abuses.” But when asked about potential links between SAIC-Volkswagen and an aluminum producer in Xinjiang, Volkswagen responded: “We have no transparency about the supplier relationships of the non-controlled shareholding SAIC-Volkswagen.” Volkswagen did say that its directly controlled operations outside China had prioritized supply chain mapping for aluminum parts, but acknowledged it had “blind spots” over the origin of the aluminum in its cars. General Motors, Toyota, and the Chinese car company BYD did not respond to questions about oversight of Chinese joint ventures, supply chain mapping, or the origin of their aluminum. General Motors instead said, “GM is committed to conducting due diligence and working collaboratively with industry partners, stakeholders, and organizations to address any potential risks related to forced labor in our supply chain.” Tesla, which builds cars for China’s domestic market and for export at its Shanghai Gigafactory, said that it had “in several cases” mapped its aluminum supply chain and had not found evidence of forced labor. However, the company did not specify how much of the aluminum in its cars remains of unknown origin. Car industry staff and responsible sourcing experts, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the threat of Chinese government retaliation deterred companies from talking to their China-based suppliers and joint ventures about their potential links to forced labor in Xinjiang. The Chinese government has initiated criminal investigations targeting companies or individuals that help businesses investigate their potential links to human rights abuses in China, including forced labor in Xinjiang. The Chinese government’s hostility to scrutiny underscores the need for other governments to pay more attention to companies’ respect for human rights in China. Several jurisdictions, including the [United States](https://www.hrw.org/united-states) and the [European Union](https://www.hrw.org/europe/central-asia/european-union), have enacted or are planning laws banning the import of products linked to forced labor. Governments should also pass laws requiring companies to disclose their supply chains and identify potential links to human rights abuses. “China is a dominant player in the global car industry and governments need to ensure that companies building cars or sourcing parts in China are not tainted by the government’s repression in Xinjiang,” Wormington said. “Doing business in China should not mean having to use or benefit from forced labor.”",

    "title": "CJ Stroud’s Mom Kim Stroud Proudly Shares Her Son’s Encouraging Message for Caleb Williams",
    "text": "Earlier this week, Caleb Williams tasted defeat for the second time in his NFL career after the Bears lost 13-19 to the Texans. The talking point, however, was the awkward post-match interaction between Caleb and CJ Stroud, where the rookie looked to be disinterested while CJ was sharing words of wisdom.\nAdvertisement\nThis visual of “lil bro-ing” led to the Texans QB receiving a lot of flak online. But CJ and his mom are unfazed by the criticism.\nYesterday, during the Texans’ pre-match media interaction,\n[Stroud](/tag/cj-stroud/) clarified that both he and Caleb knew that he wasn’t belittling the rookie. Stroud, by his own admission, was simply acting as a wellwisher. He further added:\n“I had so many guys coming to me after games last year and that meant the world to me that those guys even thought about giving me advice. I just try to give back to what the game is giving me. I wish him the best man. I want him to do amazing in this league. I think he will.”\nWhile some netizens still didn’t believe CJ’s statement, his mother, Kimberly, certainly did. Taking to X, formerly known as Twitter, she reassured her son that he need not pay heed to the haters.\nKim did so by sharing the clip of CJ’s media address and paired it with a caption urging the QB to continue being himself:\nKeep being you C.J. Your a blessing\n— Kim Stroud (@KimStroud510)\n[September 18, 2024]\nKim’s message for Stroud instantly went viral as hoards of netizens flocked to the comment section to leave positive remarks. This warm reception also reflects just how Stroud is heralded by many as one of the most likable personalities in the league, despite this being his sophomore year.\nThus, it’s baffling to see fans hate the QB for simply giving tips to a rookie. And for what it’s worth, unless someone has a personal beef with CJ, it’s hard to dislike him for what he shared with Caleb.\nWhat did Stroud tell Caleb post-match?\nAfter the Texans routed the Bears, Stroud marched over to Caleb and first gave him some false assurance after he had a stinker of a game.\n“Good job out there bro,”\nsaid the Texans QB to the rookie. He then asked Caleb to sort out one glaring mistake he made today, which is to “stop taking those hits”. The Bears QB, at this point, seemed tired as he dryly acknowledged CJ before walking away.\nIt is at this point when Stroud went the extra mile as he got hold of the departing Caleb. “Hey, learn… look, come here,” he said before asking him to learn from his mistakes, as that’s all he needs to do to be great. “You are gonna be a hell of a player,” said the Texans star to Caleb before leaving.\nFor fans, CJ’s act of catching hold of a departing and seemingly disinterested Caleb to give advice was the tipping point. Netizens saw this as an act of “lil bro-ing”. But as CJ clarified, he just wants the rookie to do the best.\nAs someone who was in a similar position to Caleb last year, CJ is ideally the best mentor the rookie could have. So instead of Bears fans contributing to trolling Stroud, they should perhaps be grateful that a rival QB cares so much about their star player. Especially since kindness is a rarity these days.",

    "title": "People Are Sharing The Most Hilariously Awkward Christmas Gifts They’ve Ever Received",
    "text": "The\nmagic of Christmas often lies in the joy of giving and receiving gifts. However, not all presents are created equal, especially when they fall into the category of ‘What were they thinking?’ This festive season, while most gifts bring cheer and warmth, there are those that leave us scratching our heads in bewildered amusement.\nImagine unwrapping a present under the twinkling lights of the Christmas tree, only to find something so absurd, so peculiar, that you can’t help but wonder if Santa had a mix-up at the North Pole. These aren’t just any gifts; they are the epitome of the awkward, the bizarre, the downright ‘WTF’ moments of holiday gift-giving.\nIt’s often said that it’s the thought that counts, but what happens when that thought is a puzzling enigma? These stories are a testament to those Christmas mornings filled with polite smiles, concealed confusion, and the silent question, ‘What were they thinking?’\nAs you dive into this list of the most awkward and bizarre Christmas gifts ever received, remember: while the season of giving is full of surprises, some surprises are more baffling than others. Let’s unwrap these\ntales of holiday hilarity and wonder, where the spirit of Christmas meets the mystery of the most questionable gift choices.\n1. Sexual themes\n“When I was like 12 my mom’s boyfriend gave me a holiday card with sexual themes in the text. My mom pulled me aside later and told me that he was almost illiterate and hadn’t read it before giving it to me and to never talk about it again.” –\nu/hypo-osmotic\n2. Sweet 16\n“16th birthday, then-girlfriend’s dad gifted me a pair of sexy red lacy thong panties. I still don’t know if he was suggesting that I sleep with his daughter, his wife, or him.” –\nu/FunkTurkey\n3. Little bro\n“When I was about 10 my little brother (only 3 or so) was very sweet and told my parents he had a present for me but didn’t want anyone to see and wanted to wrap it himself. Christmas morning comes and I’m very moved by the shoebox-sized gift my little brother taped up as best he could and made my Mom wrap for him. He excitedly brought it over and I noticed it was pretty light but his eyes were giddy with excitement for me to open it. I figured it was a hand-drawn picture or something and so I made a big show about being excited to see what was inside. As I started to remove the tape from the box I noticed a little odd smell but figured it was just because the old box was in the basement. When I finally got the lid open and my brother excitedly exclaimed “Merry Christmas” I got to see what he was so excited about for the past two weeks. The box contained a dead hummingbird that had run into the window, an earthworm, and a few scattered saltines in case the worm and bird got hungry. Best present ever, but definitely WTF.” –\nu/Jelz\n4. The…crust\n“For my bridal shower, my mother-in-law gave me an old bikini. How do I know it was old? The elastic was crusty.” –\nu/Lalina13\n5. Wholesome heater\n“I had one of these with my Nana that turned into a fucking Hallmark life lesson.\nHigh School, 1998 or so. At some point in October or so I mentioned casually during a visit that my bedroom was chilly at night. Come Christmas, I open my gift from Nana. A space heater.\nAs a teenager who was hoping for video games or CDs or other such things, I put on the forced-smile rictus and thanked her for the gift while internally bemoaning all the loot that could have been. I must have been grossly unconvincing because she got a bit anxiously defensive, “You said your room was cold! I thought it’d help out!”\nLater that night we head home, I plug the space heater in when I go to bed because why not?\nMy god. My god, you all. The DIFFERENCE that space heater made. Actual fucking comfortable sleep for once. No waking up halfway through the night shivering, or getting shocked awake by my foot straying too far from out of the covers.\nThe next time I went to her house I gave Nana a giant hug, told her how much better my room was at night with that space heater, and gave her an actual genuine thank you. I didn’t even mind the following “I told you it’d help!”\nEver since that Christmas, when I get something practical for Christmas from Nana, I thank her sincerely, because it WILL be useful. I still use that space heater twenty years after the fact, too.” –\nu/Strawberrycocoa\n6. Honest mom\n“A book called “This Is Why You’re Single.” Thanks, Mom.” –\nu/GlassApricot9\n7. Jews rule\n“This wasn’t me but it’s a great story anyway. My very materialistic sister dated (and eventually married) a pretty rich guy. They met on New Year’s Eve so by the first Christmas they shared they were together for a year. The whole first year he showered her with gifts and trips and all kinds of stuff, even paying for her education. He seemed like a great guy but because he was a little weird and shy my parents didn’t meet him until that first Christmas. Well he showed up with gifts for all, really nice and thoughtful things. My sister opened hers last. It was huge box, inside was another box, and another, that old gag with maybe 10 or 12 boxes. Well we were all thinking “At the bottom there is a ring, he’s going to propose!”. When she got to the final box it was a single roll of toilet paper and a can of Campbell’s soup. I just about pissed myself with laughter looking at my sister’s dumb fucking face. One of the top 10 moments in my life if I’m being honest. We never got an explanation as to why, it wasn’t an inside joke or anything, just a weird fucking thing from a weird fucking guy. I like him (maybe even more than my sister does) but my parents definitely think he’s a weirdo.\nForgot to mention about 8 years after this I moved across the country and my first Christmas without the family he sent me a half eaten box of stale triscuits and a ziplock bag of hair that had fallen off their cat. There was no card but he wrote “jews rule” on the wrapping paper with sharpie. My reward for being the only member of my family to not shun him for his weird behavior over the years.” –\nu/everyoneiknowistrash\n8. Thanks, I hate it\n“Christmas, 1993. I was eleven. My grandma gave me one half of a pool cue. She gifted the other half to my then-8-year-old brother.\nGrandma: “See? You can only use it if you two cooperate and share!”\nWe did not own a pool table.” –\nu/CaptainWisconsin\n9. In a bucket\n“A guinea pig. Just the guinea pig, no cage or anything. They gave it to me in a bucket.” –\nu/Kckc321\n10. Donald Suck\n“When I was in college my sister gave me a Donald Duck cement lawn ornament for Christmas. It weighed at least 40 pounds. I didn’t have a lawn, and I didn’t like Donald Duck. She has an excessive amount of lawn ornaments in her yard. I suspect that she realized that she hadn’t gotten me anything as she was getting into her car and just grabbed the closest thing.” –\nu/SpendLessLiveMore\n11. Big idea\n“I was given a large industrial lightbulb (think of a cylinder the circumference of a soccer ball and about 15” tall) by my uncle. He told me it was worth a lot of money and would be hard to find another one if I ever needed one.” –\nu/iconoclastic_idiot\n12. I’ll take it\n“A cheese and champagne gift set that had the champagne and most of the other goodies taken out of it. So cheese in a mostly empty box.” –\nu/haggisforthesoul\nSome more of our favorites:",

    "title": "Sindacati: meglio contrattare che rivoltare",
    "text": "dopo lo sciopero\nSindacati: meglio contrattare che rivoltare\nCosa resta di una “rivolta sociale” moscia? Dopo il quarto sciopero generale consecutivo che non incide nella realtà, è tempo di un bilancio per Cgil e Uil\nLa preparazione dello sciopero generale di Cgil e Uil è stata caratterizzata da toni sempre più alti. Maurizio Landini ha invocato la “rivolta sociale” per aggregare tutte le realtà politiche e sociali che si oppongono a Giorgia Meloni. Poi si è autoproclamato rappresentante della maggioranza extraparlamentare degli italiani, in opposizione al governo e al Parlamento che non avrebbero la legittimità per approvare la legge di Bilancio. Infine, il suo sodale Pierpaolo Bombardieri ha negato la terzietà del Garante sul diritto allo sciopero.\nA fronte dell’escalation di dichiarazioni incendiarie, culminata nel “vogliamo rivoltare questo paese come un guanto” pronunciato dal Landini nel corteo di Bologna, lo sciopero generale sembra aver prodotto davvero poco. Cgil e Uil parlano di “500 mila in piazza”, che per uno sciopero articolato su 46 piazze non pare un grandissimo risultato. Gli organizzatori dichiarano una “adesione oltre il 70%”, ma i dati ufficiali per le amministrazioni pubbliche parlano del 5,55% e, nel settore privato, altre fonti sindacali segnalano un tasso analogo.\nA prescindere dai numeri, più o meno verosimili, è sul piano sostanziale che lo sciopero ha prodotto poco. La scena mediatica è stata rubata dagli scontri di Torino, dove centri sociali e pro Pal hanno interpretato la “rivolta sociale” aggredendo le forze dell’ordine e bruciando le foto di Meloni e altri ministri. La sensazione è che terminata la manifestazione sarà tutto finito. Questo quarto sciopero generale consecutivo non avrà un seguito politico, anche perché non ha avuto parole d’ordine – incluso l’invito generico alla “rivolta sociale” – capaci di incidere nella società e nell’agenda dei partiti.\nL’aspetto più indicativo dello spirito dello sciopero, a metà tra ribellismo e velleitarismo, è stata la richiesta da parte di Landini – oltre al solito sterminato elenco della spesa insostenibile per il bilancio pubblico e per le regole fiscali europee – del divieto di licenziamento: “Chiediamo che si ripristini il blocco dei licenziamenti come è stato per il periodo del Covid”, ha detto il leader della Cgil. È una richiesta surreale, ma che incarna gli errori clamorosi del sindacato nella lettura della fase del mercato del lavoro degli ultimi anni.\nIl blocco dei licenziamenti fu, già durante il Covid, un provvedimento eccezionale: l’Italia è stato l’unico paese dell’Ocse a introdurlo e non ha avuto particolari meriti nella protezione dei lavoratori, anzi. Ma quando nel 2021 il governo Draghi ne annunciò la rimozione, la Cgil e la Uil lanciarono una campagna di terrorismo mediatico preannunciando da “700 mila” (Cgil) a “un milione” (Uil) di licenziamenti, parlando di “bomba sociale” che era la versione esplosiva dell’attuale “rivolta sociale”. La rimozione di quel blocco è coincisa con una fase di costante aumento di 1,5 milioni di occupati, prevalentemente a tempo indeterminato.\nSe chiedere il blocco allora era un errore, farlo adesso è un delirio. Ciò non vuol dire che Cgil e Uil non rappresentino un disagio reale, come la questione salariale. Perché è vero, come hanno ricordato sul Foglio Marco Leonardi e Leonzio Rizzo, che negli anni passati le imprese, che hanno potuto correggere i prezzi, si sono difese dall’inflazione meglio dei lavoratori, i cui salari si rinnovano in ritardo. Ma nelle fasi di alta inflazione i governi hanno fatto la loro parte con una forte decontribuzione che ha protetto i salari medio-bassi da inflazione e fiscal drag. La legge di Bilancio, come certifica l’Upb, nel prossimo triennio darà 55 miliardi a lavoratori e famiglie e toglierà 13 miliardi a imprese e autonomi.\nIl bilancio pubblico, con il debito in crescita e il piano di rientro concordato con Bruxelles, non può fare di più. Per aumentare i salari, ai sindacati non resta che la contrattazione, a partire dai tanti rinnovi in corso. Tra l’altro se, come da tempo sostiene lo stesso Landini, le imprese hanno fatto tanti profitti, è attraverso i contratti collettivi che i lavoratori possono ottenere la loro parte. Ma questo vorrebbe dire spostare il focus dalla “rivolta sociale” alla contrattazione, dall’opposizione politica all’economia reale.\nIl ritratto",
