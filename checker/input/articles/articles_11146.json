    "title": "Embraer and Mahindra propel India’s defence with C-390 Millennium - Defence News | The Financial Express",
    "text": "Earlier this week, Dr Anish Shah, Group CEO of Mahindra, visited Embraer’s headquarters in Brazil, marking a significant milestone in their collaborative efforts. The primary agenda of the visit was to fortify the partnership between Embraer and Mahindra, with a particular emphasis on advancing India’s defence capabilities through the C-390 Millennium military transport aircraft.Accompanied by senior executives of the group Dr Shah was welcomed by company’s President and CEO, Francisco Gomes Neto. This partnership between Embraer and Mahindra , holds immense strategic importance, especially in light of India ’s evolving defence requirements. The C-390 Millennium has emerged as a pivotal asset in this endeavor, offering unparalleled capabilities in various military operations.As reported previously by Financial Express Online earlier this year, the preliminary agreement signed underscores the shared commitment of both companies to secure orders for the C-390 Millennium from the Indian Air Force (IAF). With its proven track record and versatility, the C-390 Millennium is poised to address India’s medium transport aircraft needs effectively.The meeting between Embraer and Mahindra not only signifies a collaborative business venture but also reflects the broader strategic partnership between Brazil and India. As members of BRICS and G20, both countries share common interests in fostering cooperation and mutual growth.The C-390 Millennium stands out as a symbol of technological prowess and operational excellence. Its multi-mission capabilities, including cargo and troop transport, medical evacuation, and aerial firefighting, make it a highly sought-after asset for modern military forces.Furthermore, the partnership between Embraer and Mahindra aligns seamlessly with India’s ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ (self-reliant India) initiative, stressing indigenous manufacturing and innovation in defence production. This collaboration not only strengthens India’s defence capabilities but also contributes to its vision of self-sufficiency in defence manufacturing.The meeting between Embraer and Mahindra marks a significant step forward in their collaborative efforts to advance India’s defence capabilities through the C-390 Millennium for the IAF.Three Indian nationals have been arrested for the murder of Khalistan separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Canada. The suspects are allegedly part of a hit squad organized by the Indian government. Tensions between India and Canada have been heightened due to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s accusations and India’s concerns about separatists and terrorists being given refuge in Canada.",

Snow will taper to light flurries late Friday morning or early Friday afternoon, as this band shifts to the south,” the weather advisory said.\n“Motorists should expect hazardous winter driving conditions and adjust travel plans accordingly. There may be a significant impact on rush-hour traffic in urban areas.”\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW Environment Canada reminds drivers to slow down in slippery conditions, watch for tail lights ahead and maintain a safe following distance.

    "text": "Burlington, Wash. — In the farm fields near Mount Vernon, scientists are working to build better bread.\n\"Bread is science. It's physics, it's chemistry, it's biology - it's alive,\" said Dr. Stephen Jones, wheat breeder, home baker, and director of\nThe Washington State University Bread Lab. Since 2011, this place has explored the science of tasty whole grain loaves. One of the lab's missions? Developing bread that's affordable, nutritious and delicious. Using grains grown west of the Cascades.\nBill Gates has toured the bread lab, Patagonia's food line,\nPatagonia Provisions, sponsors research at the lab. The Bread Lab even developed a healthier flour tortilla for Chipotle.\n\"They came to us a few years ago, and they wanted to do a few things. They wanted to take some of the ingredients out of their tortillas,\" said Jones.\n\"Part of coming to these classes is taking the intimidation out, and having the instructors and the assistants stand by and say, 'You know, you got this! It's gonna make beautiful bread!’\" said baking instructor Juli Hammond.\nThe students in this Cooking with Whole Grains class will go home with whole wheat loaves, scones, gingerbread, and something more. Baking student Ann Templeton Monin explains:\n\"It sends me back to my childhood, actually. Sounds corny, but really, a lot of my memories, good memories, were back in Kentucky were watching my grandmother make buttermilk biscuits and pancakes and things like that. And I just keep going back to that. Being in the kitchen makes me happy.\"\nThere's more to the Bread Lab than science -- just like there's more to some bread than flour, water, and yeast.\n\"We work with many bakers that talk about the love in their bread. So there's some love involved, there's history and tradition, there's tremendous beauty,\" Jones said, \"I like to say in the lab we have beauty; there's room for beauty, there's tremendous beauty in what we do.’\nFRESH GINGER GINGERBREAD\nINGREDIENTS\n- 1 cup (7 1/2 ounces) brown sugar\n- 1/4 cup (2 1/2 ounces) molasses\n- 3/4 cup (6 ounces) water, boiling\n- 1/4 cup (2 ounces) unsalted butter, softened 1 teaspoon baking soda\n- 1/2 teaspoon salt\n- 1 egg\n- 3/4 cup (3 ounces) King Arthur Unbleached\n- All-Purpose Flour\n- 1 cup (4 ounces) King Arthur Medium Rye Flour\n- 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon\n- 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves\n- 2 tablespoons fresh grated ginger\n- 1/4 cup (1 1/2 ounces) diced crystallized ginger, optional\nDIRECTIONS\n- In a large bowl, blend the brown sugar, molasses, water, and butter, stirring until the butter melts.\n- When the mixture is lukewarm, add the baking soda, salt, and egg.\n- Stir in the flour and spices to the wet ingredients. Then stir in the crystallized ginger, if using.\n- Pour the batter into a greased 8-inch pan, and bake the gingerbread in a preheated 350°F oven for 25 - 28 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center.\n(Recipe courtesy King Arthur Flour)\nWHOLE WHEAT SANDWICH BREAD\nINGREDIENTS\n- 3 cups (12 ounces) King Arthur Whole Wheat Flour\n- 1 1/2 teaspoons salt\n- 1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast\n- 1 1/2 cups (12 ounces) warm water\n- 2 tablespoons (1/2 ounce) dry milk powder\n- 1 tablespoon honey\n- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, soft\n- 1/2 cup (2 ounces) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour\nYield: 1 loaf\nDIRECTIONS\n- Place all of the dry ingredients except the all-purpose flour in a large bowl and stir to combine well.\n- Stir in the warm water, honey and butter and mix until a wet dough forms.\n- Cover the dough with plastic and set it aside to rest about 15 minutes.\n- After resting, stir in only enough of the all-purpose flour to create a soft shaggy dough.\n- Knead on a lightly floured surface until the dough becomes smooth and elastic.\n- Allow the dough to rise in a greased covered bowl for about one hour.\n- Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Shape into a tight log. Place the log into a greased 8 1/2 x 4 1/2-inch bread pan, cover, and allow to rise for about one hour until it has increased in volume and feels soft and airy.\n- Bake the loaf in a preheated 375˚F oven for about 35 minutes. When the loaf is done, the crust will be golden brown on the top and sides. The baked loaf will sound hollow when tapped, and the sides will feel firm right after removing from the oven.\n- Remove from baking pan and cool on a wire rack. The crust will soften some as it cools.\n(Recipe Courtesy King Arthur Flour)\n[KING 5's Evening ](/evening)celebrates the Northwest. Connect with us via",

    "title": "Viruela del mono: se confirmaron los primeros cinco casos en Argentina | Perfil",
    "text": "El Ministerio de Salud de la Nación informó que existen en Argentina cinco casos de mpox , popularmente conocido como viruela del mono . Este miércoles 14 de agosto, la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) declaró la emergencia internacional de salud pública de alcance internacional. El brote mató a cientos de personas en el Congo y ya se registró un caso en Europa. El dato se conoció en el último informe del Boletín Epidemiológico Nacional, que va de las semanas 1 a 31 del 2024. Allí se detalló que fueron evaluados 39 casos, se descartaron 24 y se siguen investigando 10. Respecto a los contagiados, detallaron que uno se confirmó en la provincia de Buenos Aires, dos en CABA, uno en Río Negro y el restante en Santa Fe. Suscribite Este miércoles, el director general de la agencia sanitaria de la ONU, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, fue contundente respecto al brote: \"Es una situación que debería preocuparnos a todos\". La OMS declaró la emergencia de salud pública internacional por la cepa ultramortal de viruela del mono La OMS advirtió que habrá más casos de mpox en Europa tras el caso de Suecia La entidad de salud internacional advirtió el jueves que era probable que se produjeran más casos importados de la nueva y más peligrosa cepa mpox en Europa, después de que Suecia anunciara la primera infección de este tipo fuera de África en un brote que ha matado a cientos de personas en la República Democrática del Congo. El caso registrado en un viajero en Suecia se anunció el día después de que la Organización Mundial de la Salud declarara que el aumento de mpox en África era una emergencia de salud pública de interés internacional. La agencia de salud de la ONU se mostró preocupada por el aumento de casos y muertes en Congo y la propagación a Burundi, Kenia, Ruanda y Uganda. La Agencia de Salud Pública de Suecia dijo al medio internacional AFP el jueves que había registrado un caso del subclado Clade 1b, la misma nueva cepa del virus que ha surgido en la República Democrática del Congo desde septiembre de 2023. \"A una persona que buscó atención médica\" en Estocolmo \"se le ha diagnosticado mpox causado por la variante del clado 1. Es el primer caso causado por el clado I que se diagnostica fuera del continente africano\", dijo la agencia en un comunicado separado. La persona se contagió durante una visita a \"la parte de África donde hay un importante brote de mpox Clade 1\", dijo el epidemiólogo estatal Magnus Gisslen en el comunicado. Y agregaron: \"El hecho de que un paciente con mpox sea tratado en el país no afecta al riesgo para la población general, un riesgo que el Centro Europeo para la Prevención y el Control de Enfermedades (ECDC) considera actualmente muy bajo\". La oficina regional europea de la OMS en Copenhague dijo que estaba discutiendo con Suecia cuál es la mejor manera de gestionar el caso recién detectado. \"La confirmación del Clade 1 de mpox en Suecia es un claro reflejo de la interconexión de nuestro mundo\", afirmó en un comunicado. Y subrayaron: \"Es probable que haya más casos importados de clado 1 en la región europea en los próximos días y semanas, y es imperativo que no estigmaticemos a los viajeros ni a los países/regiones\". 548 muertos en la República Democrática del Congo El ministro de Salud, Samuel-Roger Kamba, dijo en un mensaje de video que el país \"ha registrado 15.664 casos potenciales y 548 muertes desde principios de año\", con las 26 provincias afectadas. La población de la República Democrática del Congo es de alrededor de 100 millones. A raíz de esto, desde el gobierno dijeron que pusieron en marcha un \"plan estratégico nacional de vacunación contra el MPOX \", además de mejorar la vigilancia de la enfermedad en las fronteras y los puestos de control. El ministro dijo que se han creado grupos de trabajo a nivel gubernamental para impulsar el rastreo de contactos y ayudar a movilizar recursos para \"mantener el control de esta epidemia\". Que es el brote de mpox o viruela del mono Antiguamente llamado viruela del mono, el virus fue descubierto en 1958 en Dinamarca, en monos criados para investigación. Se descubrió por primera vez en humanos en 1970 en lo que hoy es la República Democrática del Congo. El Mpox es una enfermedad infecciosa causada por un virus transmitido a los humanos por animales infectados, pero también puede transmitirse de persona a persona a través del contacto físico cercano. La enfermedad causa fiebre, dolores musculares y grandes lesiones en la piel similares a forúnculos. Tedros Ghebreyesus, director de la OMS, advirtió que la próxima pandemia \"es una cuestión de cuándo, no de si ocurrirá\" Campaña de vacunación El Departamento de Salud de Estados Unidos dijo este miércoles que \"donaría 50.000 dosis de la vacuna JYNNEOS aprobada por la Administración de Alimentos y Medicamentos (FDA) a la República Democrática del Congo\". \"La vacunación será un elemento fundamental de la respuesta a este brote\", afirmó en un comunicado.Por otro lado, la farmacéutica danesa Bavarian Nordic dijo que estaba lista para producir hasta 10 millones de dosis de su vacuna dirigida a mpox para 2025. Hay dos subtipos del virus: el clado 1, más virulento y letal, endémico en la cuenca del Congo en África central; y el clado 2, endémico en África occidental. En mayo de 2022, las infecciones por mpox aumentaron en todo el mundo, afectando principalmente a hombres homosexuales y bisexuales, debido al subclado Clade 2b. La OMS declaró una emergencia de salud pública que duró desde julio de 2022 hasta mayo de 2023. AFP / Gi",

    "title": "Vinyl Sales in the UK Hit Their Highest Point Since 1990",
    "text": "In an astonishing revelation, the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) has declared a successful 16th consecutive year of escalating sales, showcasing the resurgence of physical music formats. The BPI's latest report reveals that the vinyl market has experienced an impressive surge, skyrocketing at a rate more than four times faster, boasting an 11.7 per cent rise, amounting to 5.9 million units in 2023 according to [NME](https://www.nme.com/news/music/uk-vinyl-sales-2023-reach-highest-level-since-1990-3563676). Topping the charts as the best-selling album of the year is Taylor Swift's '1989 (Taylor's Version),' closely followed by The Rolling Stones' 'Hackney Diamonds.' According to the BPI's insightful analysis, this resurgence reflects a continuing demand for vinyl albums and other physical music releases, creating a thriving market on the high street. The report attributes this success to the popularity of independent record stores, with iconic shops like HMV leading the way, having reopened its flagship store on London's Oxford Street this year. Delving into the specifics, the report highlights that seven out of the top 10 vinyl LP sellers were releases from 2023, including Swift's 'Speak Now (Taylor's Version),' Blur's 'The Ballad Of Darren,' Lana Del Rey's 'Did You Know There's A Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd,' Lewis Capaldi's 'Broken By Desire To Be Heavenly Sent,' and Kylie Minogue's 'Tension.' Notably, British artists played a significant role in fueling the vinyl growth, contributing to over 40 per cent of the 100 most-purchased vinyl LPs of 2023, with recent releases from The 1975, Depeche Mode, Gorillaz, and Maisie Peters leading the charge. Classic albums and re-issues also continued to captivate audiences in 2023, with top sellers including Fleetwood Mac's 'Rumours,' Courteeners' 'St Jude,' De La Soul's '3 Feet High And Rising,' and Oasis' 'The Masterplan.' Dr. Jo Twist OBE, BPI Chief Executive, expressed optimism about the resilience of the UK music market, emphasizing that the revival of physical formats, especially vinyl, provides consumers with diverse choices to enjoy their favorite music. Interestingly, despite the dominance of streaming, the CD market displayed its smallest annual decline in nearly a decade in 2023, indicating a potential stabilization. As we eagerly await the final figures for vinyl LP, CD, and cassette sales in 2023, set to be disclosed by the BPI on January 3, 2024, it is clear that the music industry is experiencing a remarkable renaissance in physical formats, challenging the digital age narrative.",

    "text": "O fficials in an Illinois county put up signs along exits on Interstate 55 telling migrant buses they were not welcome in the area over the holiday weekend. The move comes as more Chicago suburbs take strides to prevent the city's influx of immigrants from overflowing into their towns.\nGrundy County, which recently passed a resolution declaring it a “non- sanctuary county for immigration,” placed two digital signs along I-55's northbound exits by Dwight and Gardner that read \"NO MIGRANT BUSES THIS EXIT\" on Saturday. The signs went up in response to reports of buses dropping off asylum-seekers in other nearby communities, Grundy County Sheriff Ken Briley said to the .\nHOUSE PREPARES FOR EARLY 2024 SHAKE-UP WITH SLEW OF SPECIAL ELECTIONS\n“We wanted to get us through the holiday weekend so we didn’t run into the unfortunate circumstances of having these people dropped in rural Grundy County with no place to go,” Briley said.\nThe sheriff said no buses stopped in the county, the signs have been removed, and there are no plans to put them back up. He said an emergency plan was in place to take migrants to Joliet if any ended up in Grundy County. Joliet police and Will County emergency management would coordinate to direct migrants to trains bound for Chicago.\n“If someone got lost or thought by mistake that this was Chicago, those signs were a directory,” Grundy County State’s Attorney Russell Baker said. “We thought the signs could persuade bus drivers, if lost, to keep going on I-55 to places that are equipped to handle [migrants].”\nKankakee officials reported that four days before Christmas, a bus dropped off 30 to 40 migrants at a gas station around 4:30 a.m. Three hours later, police showed up to find people wrapped in blankets, with some staying at the gas station while others were spotted walking on the highway.\n“The passengers, hailing from Venezuela, were left without money, food, adequate clothing, and were under the impression that they had reached their destination,” the Kankakee County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement .\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\nThis is the latest event involving immigrants filtering into Chicago suburbs. Naperville, Aurora, Fox River Grove, Elmhurst, and Cicero are among the towns and villages that have witnessed busloads of migrants arriving in recent weeks. Several of the suburbs are rejecting the buses, threatening to fine or impound them if they drop off homeless immigrants. Villages of Schaumburg and Elk Grove Village have passed ordinances preventing illegal immigrants from being housed in hotels, and Oak Park is now evicting 150 immigrants living in the town's hotel and YMCA.\nGrundy County passed its \"non-sanctuary\" status resolution two weeks ago, rededicating its \"limited resources\" to residents in need, such as seniors, veterans, homeless people, and those living below the poverty line.\nLatest New Hampshire 9-year-old calls Nikki Haley 'the new John Kerry' to her face By: Jenny Goldsberry\nRecent backlash against Nikki Haley proves 'momentum': Tiana Lowe Doescher By: Jenny Goldsberry\nChris Christie's conceit By: Varad Mehta Videos\nTrump campaign slams Biden on US-Mexico border in ad: 'The world burns'\nLouisiana joins list of states considering disqualifying Trump from primary ballot\nBiden chides Trump over Christmas Day 'rot in hell' wish\nJudge upholds redrawn Georgia congressional map in win for Republicans Newsletters\nSign up now to get the Washington Examiner’s breaking news and timely commentary delivered right to your inbox.",
