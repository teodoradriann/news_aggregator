    "text": "Escalating geopolitical tensions are driving the profits of defense companies. Almost after two years, major defense corporations have shifted their stance significantly, with many anticipating robust demand in 2024. According to Reuters, on anticipation of aggressive actions from Russia and China, investments by the United States and its allies in costly weaponry and munitions is on an upsurge.\nOptimistic Market Outlook\nAccording to Wall Street estimates, as quoted on Reuters, shares of the largest defense companies are projected to continue their upward trajectory, beating the broader S&P 500 Index. The Dow Jones U.S. Select Aerospace & Defense Index and S&P Aerospace & Defense Select Industry Index have gained about 14.11% and 25.62%, respectively.\nPer the Reuters article, shares of Lockheed Martin\n[LMT](/market-activity/stocks/lmt), General Dynamics [GD](/market-activity/stocks/gd) and Northrop Grumman [NOC](/market-activity/stocks/noc) are estimated to climb 5-7% over the next 12 months.\nNorthrop Grumman and L3Harris Technologies\n[LHX](/market-activity/stocks/lhx), two primary U.S. rocket manufacturers have both reported an upsurge in demand, with Northrop attributing a significant portion of the rise in demand to the increased need for its rocket motors and warheads which see extensive use in Ukraine.\nRecord U.S. Defense Policy Bill\nOn Dec 22, President Joe Biden signed the U.S. defense policy bill that authorizes a record allowance of $886 billion in military spending, marking an increase of 3% in the nation's total national security budget.\nAccording to Reuters, the Defense bill also includes policies such as aid for Ukraine and push-back against China in the Indo-Pacific region. Such aids, in turn, are expected to usher in order flows for defense contractors, enhancing their potential for generating revenue.\nETFs in Focus\nThe escalating Middle East crisis has resulted in a surge in defense stocks driven by increased demand for military equipment. Persisting tensions between Russia and Ukraine further contribute to the volatility within the geopolitical landscape.\nThe U.S. defense market is valued at $613.18 billion in 2023 and is estimated to witness a CAGR of 0.67%, reaching a valuation of $646.83 billion by 2031, according to Mordor Intelligence.\nAgainst this backdrop, we highlight a few defense ETFs that can gain due to the complicated geopolitical landscape.\niShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA)\niShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF seeks to track the performance of the Dow Jones U.S. Select Aerospace & Defense Index with a basket of 35 securities.

    "title": "Malo Gusto: The Rising Star of Chelsea – Latest Updates and Achievements",
    "text": "Doubts were allowed a year ago when Chelsea formalized the arrival of Malo Gusto. Given his lack of experience (less than 50 Ligue 1 matches), his terrifying competition embodied by Reece James, and the lack of success displayed by young French people in recent seasons with the Blues (Tiemoué Bakayoko, Malang Sarr… ), there was no guarantee that the former Lyonnais would shatter this tricky context. But although he arrived injured at the time, the right-back never backed down from his choice, indicating that he was committed to taking the rose and the thorns.\nThe rest after this ad\n“I’m not stupid, nor crazy either. I knew before coming that Reece James was one of the best players in his position (…) If I chose Chelsea, it’s because I have a plan. I know what I’m doing”he repeated in September in an interview given to\nThe Team. Four months later, the plan in question appears to be holding up. Because for several weeks, Gusto has been wearing a fairly broad suit and has managed to dig into the right drawers at the right time. Used on both the left and the right, the 20-year-old optimizes his playing time and takes advantage of the injury to Reece James, who will be absent for at least two more months. It’s simple, since Chelsea’s defeat against Wolves (2-1) on December 24, Mauricio Pochettino has installed him as a starter. A great reward, obviously in the Christmas spirit.\nRead Chelsea: Christopher Nkunku injured again\nHe is adored by Mauricio Pochettino and the supporters\nFacing Crystal Palace three days later, Gusto impressed at Stamford Bridge, which has already made him one of its favorites. Named man of the match, the native of Décines-Charpieu served Mudryk on the first goal after exceptional work in his lane. This Saturday, he repeated the same performance against Preston (4-0), in the FA Cup, but this time serving Armando Broja from his left lane. Tactical flexibility much appreciated by Mauricio Pochettino, and performances praised by the British press. Consultant for Sky SportsMicah Richards got excited about the Frenchman: “I’ll tell you who is exceptional… Malo Gusto. He has so much energy, he is as good in attack as in defense for a full-back, I love him. He has a bright future ahead of him, and it’s very serious.”he appreciated after the Frenchman’s decisive pass against the Eagles a fortnight ago.\nRead more: Roger Federer's Evaluation of Carlos Alcaraz: Impressive Achievements and Future Potential\nThe rest after this ad\nMoreover, this season Gusto tops the ranking of Chelsea’s best passers at Stamford Bridge (4 caviars). All in just 17 games, due to a stubborn knee injury which kept him off the field in November and December. But now, his physical problems seem to be put away in the box of bad memories. Continuing this momentum, the young French\ninternational (1 selection) is well aware that he will be able to apply for a place at the Euro. During his first call-up to the Blues in October to compensate for Jules Koundé’s package, he did not use any pretense at the microphone of Téléfoot : «Play the Euro? It’s in the back of our minds (en implying Castle Lukeba). Obviously, that must be a goal. Personally, I believe that we should not focus on long-term things. We must already take things as they happen, work day after day to claim them.“. Theoretically, Deschamps should unveil his list around May 15. We will therefore have to stay the course for another hundred days to hope to be part of the journey.\nPub. 01/07/2024 10:01 p.m. Updated 01/07/2024 11:09 p.m.\n2024-01-07 21:10:36\n#Malo #Gusto #agreement #Chelsea",

    "text": "CLAUDINEI QUEIROZ\nSÃO PAULO, SP (FOLHAPRESS)\nRepresentantes dos principais institutos meteorológicos e geológicos do país se reuniram nesta quinta-feira (9) para analisar os riscos que a nova frente fria, que chega ao Rio Grande do Sul nesta sexta-feira (10), deve levar para o estado já castigado pelos temporais da semana passada.\nO documento, divulgado por Inmet (Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia), Cemaden (Centro Nacional de Monitoramento e Alertas de Desastres Naturais), Cenad (Centro Nacional de Gerenciamento de Riscos e Desastres) e Inpe (Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais), confirmou a previsão de que, a partir desta sexta, o sistema frontal ficará estacionado sobre a região central do estado, criando condições para a piora do quadro atual das enchentes.\n“Entre a sexta e a segunda-feira (13), as chuvas serão mais intensas no centro-leste e nordeste do estado, incluindo a região metropolitana da capital, Porto Alegre, onde se encontram algumas bacias de captação do Guaíba. Os acumulados de chuva neste período poderão superar os 150 mm, condição que pode agravar ainda mais a situação do estado”, destaca a nota.\nA previsão indica ainda que a passagem da nova frente fria pode provocar até a formação de um ciclone extratropical nas proximidades da costa, o que causaria o incremento dos ventos vindos do leste, dificultando o escoamento das águas da lagoa dos Patos em direção ao oceano.\n“Nos dias seguintes, esta frente fria e o posterior ingresso de uma massa de ar frio e seco irá causar queda nas temperaturas e possibilidade de chuva na próxima semana”, informa a análise.\nAtualmente, segundo os institutos, os rios Taquari, Caí e Sinos continuam voltando lentamente ao nível normal, da mesma forma que toda a região do delta do Jacuí. No entanto, devido à velocidade e direção dos ventos existe uma situação de estabilidade com leve tendência de subida no nível do lago Guaíba, na Grande Porto Alegre. Ao longo dos próximos dias, a volta da chuva para a região metropolitana e norte do Rio Grande do Sul pode aumentar o volume de água que chega no lago.\nConforme a previsão, a chuva volumosa deve atingir as bacias hidrográficas mais próximas à região metropolitana de Porto Alegre, como as dos rios Gravataí, rio dos Sinos e rio Caí. Além disso, ao longo dos próximos dias, a posição dos ventos na lagoa dos Patos dificultará o escoamento das águas, aumentando o risco de inundação dos municípios na região de Pelotas, Rio Grande e arredores.\nOutra região que precisa de atenção redobrada é a bacia do rio Uruguai, localizada na região da fronteira oeste do estado gaúcho com a Argentina, que deve continuar subindo pelos próximos dias.\nDeslizamentos podem voltar a ocorrer\nOutro alerta do documento emitido pelas autoridades é em relação aos deslizamentos de terra, principalmente nas áreas já atingidas pelos temporais da semana passada.\n“Considera-se alta a probabilidade de ocorrência de movimentos de massa (em laranja no mapa) nas mesorregiões centro-oriental e ocidental rio-grandense, além da região metropolitana de Porto Alegre e nordeste rio-grandense, onde se encontra a serra gaúcha, devido aos elevados acumulados registrados ao longo da última semana, que incrementaram significativamente a umidade do solo, intensificaram processos erosivos e causaram diversos deslizamentos de terra”, diz o texto.\nO volume de chuva esperado também é citado como complicador para esses eventos geológicos.\nSegundo a análise, “são esperados novos deslizamentos de terra em áreas urbanizadas e também quedas de barreiras à margem de estradas e rodovias, não se descartando a possibilidade de deslizamentos em encostas naturais, além de reativação de deslizamentos recentes, especialmente entre sábado (11) e domingo (12)”.\nNas demais regiões do estado também existe a possibilidade de deslizamentos e quedas de barreiras, mas em menor proporção, devido ao menor volume de chuva.",

    "title": "Rescue of California Climber Took 28 Hours and 5 Helicopters",
    "text": "Inyo County Search and Rescue is reporting one grueling rescue effort that spanned two days, required five helicopters, and a solo climber who endured one of the most gruesome injuries imaginable on California’s Mt. Williamson – a peak on the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada, northwest of the town of Lonepine. The whole ordeal began on the afternoon of July 2 at an elevation of 13,600 feet when the Inyo County Sheriff’s Office received an SOS from the climber’s Garmin InReach device. From there, a massive rescue effort unfolded.\nTo make matters more urgent, the solo climber had lost her backpack with all her food, water, and extra clothing. She had endured a “serious injury to her lower leg, with bone visibly protruding through the skin,” they said, but she had remained surprisingly calm and responsive in making their first contact via satellite text.\nNext came a storm along with lightning, rain, and winds strong enough that helicopters were grounded before they could reach her. By this point, daylight was gone and SAR workers were forced to continue their work on foot. Once the sun was back up on July 3, rescue workers had reached the base of Mt. Williamson’s west face and were able to make verbal contact with the climber.\nThe terrain was preventing them from reaching her by foot as well as accessing her with the helicopter’s hoist. At this point, SAR dropped two rescuers 300 feet above the climber where they could descend the narrow chute and reach her. All of this took place in 23 hours following the climber’s fall. Another helicopter with a longer hoist cable was brought in but that didn’t work either. Finally, California National Guard deployed a Blackhawk Spartan chopper. After Search and Rescue moved the climber to open terrain that the National Guard chopper could access, they were able to complete the 28-hour rescue.\n“This complex, multi-agency operation involved five helicopters over two days and required tremendous coordination, endurance, and technical skill. Six SAR volunteers were deployed in the field, with seven more supporting base operations and standing by for insertion if needed,” Inyo County SAR wrote this week. “This mission is a powerful reminder of the dangers of high-altitude mountaineering and the extraordinary efforts behind each rescue. The climber’s bravery and composure in extreme conditions were remarkable.”",

    "text": "Talk about luck! Two people are recovering after rainy conditions in California led to an accident. According to [NBC Bay Area](https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/2-people-rescued-san-francisco-glen-canyon-park/3407637/), the San Francisco Fire Department (SFFD) rescued the injured after their car flipped and slid down an embankment. The incident reportedly happened on Wednesday (Dec. 27), with a 911 call logged at 2:45 p.m. local time. A hiker near the accident area — Glen Canyon Park — told officials he had witnessed the navy blue sedan sliding down the hill. Firefighters later assessed that the car had skidded over 100 feet down the embankment. RELATED: [Hannah Payne Disobeyed 911 & That Led To Kenneth Herring’s Murder | TSR Investigates](https://theshaderoom.com/hannah-payne-kenneth-herring-life-sentence-death-threats-tsr-investigates/) To rescue [the driver](https://theshaderoom.com/crash-pennsylvania-school-bus-tow-truck-students-drivers-hospital/) and passenger, fire officials organized and executed a technical rescue. That process involved clearing thick brush leading to the damaged car and using ropes. Police reportedly shut down one lane of O’Shaughnessy Boulevard to carry out the rescue operation. How Did The Car Tumble Unto The Steep Embankment? Police are still investigating the car crash on the embankment. However, the local fire department told NBC Bay Area that things went left after the driver reportedly hit the curb. After the impact, the car rolled once and slid down the steep hill. Thankfully, the driver and passenger — whose connection remains unclear — sustained minor injuries. They were transported to a local hospital for additional evaluation following the incident. Fire officials have not released the identities of the injured. [PEOPLE](https://people.com/2-people-rescued-after-car-rolled-slid-over-100-feet-down-embankment-8420613) reports that rainy conditions in the area contributed to the embankment car accident. According to the National Weather Service, rain poured on the Bay Area between early Wednesday (before the crash) and finally tapered off early Thursday. Another storm is reportedly expected on Friday (Dec. 29). Meanwhile, the San Francisco PD is still investigating the case. Check out the thread below for SFFD’s photo and video of the rescue efforts.

    "text": "[Sociedad](/actualidad/sociedad/) Fallece el sacerdote Luis García Torrecilla, archivero diocesano más de 35 años Huesca Este jueves fallecía en Huesca el reverendo Luis García Torrecilla, perteneciente a la Diócesis de Huesca. Responsable del Archivo Diocesano durante más de 35 años, también fue vicario general de la Diócesis, responsable de varias parroquias o consiliarios de Acción Católica. Su funeral se celebrará este sábado a las 11 de la mañana en la Catedral de Huesca. La capilla ardiente se abre este viernes a mediodía en la Residencia de las Hermanitas de los Ancianos Desamparados. Nacido en Zaragoza en 1933, fue el obispo de Huesca, Lino Rodrigo, quien envió a Luis García Torrecilla a estudiar Teología a la Universidad Pontificia de Salamanca, donde se ordenó sacerdote. Ya en Huesca fue coadjutor de Damián Iguacen en la parroquia de San Lorenzo. Tras ello, rector del Seminario, Consiliario de grupos de los Movimientos de Acción Católica, primer párroco de la entonces nueva parroquia de la Encarnación, párroco de distintos pueblos, y finalmente párroco de San Lorenzo. Javier Osés lo nombró vicario general de la Diócesis, donde impulso la “Asamblea Diocesana” de los años 80. Tras su relevo en este puesto, se incorporó al Archivo Diocesano en el que permaneció más de 35 años, hasta que el 30 de diciembre de 2021 dejó voluntariamente esta responsabilidad. De esa época destacan sus ayudas a los investigadores en la localización de textos, en las traducciones del latín de los mismos, el reconocimiento de nombres ilegibles, las localizaciones de documentos para la genealogía familiar o para recuperar la historia de parroquias o pueblos, la insistencia en la petición de los duplicados a las parroquias, o los más de 700.000 datos de bautismos, matrimonios y defunciones de la Diócesis. Se recuerda que se encontró con un archivo que era prácticamente un almacén de papeles y documentos, y todo fue ordenado, clasificado y recolocado.",
