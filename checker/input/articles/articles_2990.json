    "text": "A week after Greece became one of the first Christian Orthodox-majority country to legalise same-sex marriage and adoption, the Metropolis of Piraeus has announced it will be distancing itself from politicians who voted for the bill. According to [ Kathimerini](https://www.ekathimerini.com/news/1232360/metropolitan-seraphim-to-cut-ties-with-mps-who-voted-for-same-sex-marriage/), in a resolution “to address the consequences of the law on the marriage of same-sex individuals,” signed by Metropolitan Seraphim and other church council and administrative committee members, it stated it would not invite any of the 176 lawmakers who voted for the bill to any parish event until they revoked the law. “To protect our ministry and respect our responsibility before God, we sever our ties with those who voted against divine law, not inviting them to any parish event until they show genuine repentance by repealing this heinous legislation,” it said. The bill was approved by 176 lawmakers in the 300-seat parliament and will become law when its published in the official government gazette. Although members of Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis’ centre-right New Democracy party abstained or voted against the bill, it gained enough support from the leftist opposition in a rare show of cross-party unity despite a tense debate. Greek are divided on the issue. The Orthodox Church, which believes homosexuality is a sin, has strongly opposed same-sex marriage, while many in the LGBTQI community believe the bill does not go far enough.",

    "text": "Today, Australia's major mining stocks are on the rise, echoing the positive momentum of the S&P/ASX 200 Index (ASX: XJO) on Friday. As of the latest update, the ASX 200 has seen a 0.43% increase. Leading the charge among ASX-listed mining giants are: BHP Group Ltd (ASX: BHP), up 0.84% to $45.55. Fortescue Ltd (ASX: FMG), with shares climbing 0.64% to $28.26. Rio Tinto Ltd (ASX: RIO), experiencing a 1.24% increase to $128.97. Australia has long held its reputation as a primary global supplier of iron ore. However, the nation's government is now eyeing a shift towards becoming a clean energy superpower, leveraging its vast deposits of minerals essential for the green energy transition. Budgeting for Australia's Clean Energy Revolution Plans are underway for significant funding initiatives to bolster Australia's renewable energy sector, building upon existing schemes. Reports suggest that the Labor party is considering a multibillion-dollar initiative akin to the United States' Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which channels substantial subsidies towards clean energy projects. Fortescue's executive chair, Andrew \"Twiggy\" Forrest AO, has highlighted the impact of the IRA, indicating that it has steered investments in clean energy projects towards the US over Australia. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is set to address the nation in Newcastle, advocating for substantial investments to propel Australia into a renewable energy superpower. He underscores the importance of government-industry collaboration to drive innovation and growth in the clean energy sector. The proposed initiative is expected to involve a mix of subsidies and co-investment opportunities for clean energy businesses, aimed at strengthening Australia's position in the global renewable energy market. Renewable Energy Sector Developments Fortescue has been at the forefront of efforts to decarbonize its mining operations and expand into renewable energy through its subsidiary, Fortescue Future Industries (FFI). FFI focuses on green hydrogen and green ammonia projects, aligning with Fortescue's sustainability commitments. Other major mining players like BHP and Rio Tinto are also actively investing in renewable energy initiatives and expanding operations in critical minerals essential for the green energy transition. Additionally, numerous smaller ASX-listed mining and energy companies are solely dedicated to renewable energy opportunities and the extraction of critical minerals required for green technologies. Examples include Core Lithium Ltd (ASX: CXO), Pilbara Minerals Ltd (ASX: PLS), Mineral Resources Ltd (ASX: MIN), and Renascor Resources Ltd (ASX: RNU), among others. These companies are well-positioned to capitalize on the growing global demand for renewable energy solutions and the essential minerals driving the transition towards a sustainable future.",

    "title": "Pro-Kremlin X accounts push fake Fox News articles ahead of debate",
    "text": "A network of pro-Kremlin accounts on X pushed fake Fox News articles in the hours ahead of Thursday’s presidential debate, attempting to spread false narratives including one about former President Donald Trump’s support in the business community.\nThe fake articles, first reported on X by the account @antibot4navalny , an anonymous group of analysts tracking Russia-related influence operations, directed people to a fake version of Fox News’ website. That website appears to be part of a known Russian disinformation campaign that has mimicked legitimate news websites from Le Monde in France to The Washington Post. E.U. researchers dubbed it the doppelgänger network in 2022.\nIn March, Alethea , a company that researches online risks including disinformation, identified 81 websites and more than 5,000 X accounts as part of the campaign.\nThe messages posted Thursday on X from some of those accounts, many of which rarely post, were unique but carried similar messaging and had been reposted thousands of times by early afternoon. “Biden’s presidency could be our downfall. Trump seems to be our only hope of recovery,” one read . Many pointed to a fake article with the headline “Businesses Chooses Trump and a Great America” that claimed businesspeople from Silicon Valley and beyond were lining up to support Trump.\nLaundering propaganda through Kremlin-created or approved news outlets is a tried and true tactic, but this campaign has taken on a modern twist. It uses a fake website that credibly imitates a legitimate news outlet, sharing links through a network of seemingly automated accounts in a way that is not easily detected by platforms and researchers.\n2 hours ago Live updates: Biden, Trump debate hours away in first face-to-face since 2020 Decision 2024 1 hour ago Here's a look at the false claims you might hear during tonight's presidential debate Another article shared by accounts in the network with the headline “Mission: Almost Impossible” included an argument that President Joe Biden would need only to remain on his feet to win the debate and that Democrats were plotting to steal the election. It also included dehumanizing language about immigrants, in furtherance of the conspiracy theory of widespread illegal voting by immigrants.\nEfforts to manipulate social media discussion around the debate — arguably the first major event of the campaign season — underscore the warnings that many researchers, technologists and political scientists have issued regarding the threat that disinformation continues to pose, particularly as technology platforms have pulled back on moderation efforts .\nThe fake version of the Fox News website along with the accounts on X also highlight how foreign manipulation efforts have evolved in recent years. The fake website looks almost identical to Fox News’ real website, and the fake article uses the name of a real Fox News reporter.\n“The story is fake,” a Fox News spokesperson confirmed in an email.\nThe X accounts are also more convincing than previous manipulation efforts that often posted in broken English and used similar or identical phrases across dozens of accounts.\nThe aims, however, appear to be similar to those from previous election cycles . The doppelgänger network uses X accounts that mostly pose as conservative voters to spread the manufactured articles and ultimately attempt to stoke division in the U.S. Subjects of previous articles have included Taylor Swift, military aid funding to Ukraine and the border crisis.\nThe doppelgänger operation, while prolific in content creation, often fails to reach and engage Americans, C. Shawn Eib, head of investigations at Alethea, said in an email to NBC News.\nIts latest efforts, “while widespread, do not appear to be gaining substantial engagement from authentic U.S. audiences.”\nThis story first appeared on NBCNews.com .

    "title": "Stand.earth reacts to the B.C. NDP’s election platform",
    "text": "Unceded Musqueam, Squamish, and Tsleil-Waututh territories (Vancouver, B.C.) — Stand.earth climate experts and advocates are responding to the B.C. NDP’s platform released today, with a particular focus on oil and gas, old growth forests protections, and building electrification. With some positive re-commitments to essential measures, the B.C. NDP has acknowledged the overwhelming majority of voters who care deeply about taking real steps to protect nature and reduce pollution – and must now convince voters that it can implement its commitments with the urgency required.\nLiz McDowell, Senior Campaigns Director at Stand.earth , said:\n“Alongside urgent issues like the cost of living, B.C. residents continue to care deeply about environmental protection. Luckily, making life more affordable for everyday people can go hand-in-hand with tackling the climate crisis if we tax big polluters and use the profits to scale up clean, affordable renewable energy. This platform, while markedly less ambitious than the Green platform released earlier this week, recommits to some essential measures – like reining in pollution throug h stronger regulations on methane emissions from oil and gas, a nd protecting critical forests through the Old Growth Strategic Review – that could go a long way, if implemented with the urgency and scale required.”\nSven Biggs, Canadian Oil and Gas Program Director at Stand.earth, said:\n“We are encouraged to see that the B.C. NDP is committing in their platform to make B.C. a “clean energy superpower” by expanding the amount of renewable energy generated in the province and investing in the electrification of our economy. However the omission of a plan to put hard limits on the growth of the number of fracking wells and LNG terminals in the province undercuts this otherwise positive step forward.”\nSunil Singal, Climate Campaigner for SAFE Cities Canada at Stand.earth, said:\n“We need to tackle the affordability crisis by accelerating the transition to more affordable ways of heating our homes. It is good to see the B.C. NDP are committed to reducing the cost of heat pumps for residents, however we need to also end the expansion of inefficient gas systems in new buildings. We shouldn’t be heating and cooling our homes with old technology to the detriment of people’s health and cost of living.”\nTegan Hansen, Senior Forest Campaigner at Stand.earth, said:\n“B.C. parties have presented voters with vastly different visions for the future of forests. It’s hopeful to see both the NDP and the Greens make strong commitments to work in partnership with First Nations on land and water protection, which must be a priority for the next government. While all parties have some hopeful promises, the NDP to an extent and the Conservatives in particular need to step up with solid implementation plans to keep remaining old growth standing and support communities facing the devastating impacts of decades of mismanagement. With many forests teetering on the brink, voters in this election have an opportunity to give a powerful push in either direction.”\nWith just over two weeks to go before voters head to the polls, candidate debates – and the televised leaders’ debate on October 8 in particular – must include questions that press each party on their plans to implement measures that tackle climate change and affordability, as B.C. communities face the devastating impacts of the climate crisis.\nStand.earth’s climate experts and advocates are available for comment on B.C. environmental policy issues during the election campaign, and on the climate priorities the new legislative assembly must put at the top of their agenda.\n###\nMedia contacts:\nFor comment on oil, LNG, electrification and renewable energy –\nSven Biggs, 778-882-8354, sven@stand.earth and Kiki Wood, kiki@stand.earth , 604-757-7030\nFor comment on old growth forests , industrial logging, and forest biomass –\nTegan Hansen, tegan@stand.earth\nFor comment on building electrification and progressive building policies – Sunil Singal, 604-368-3536, sunil.singal@stand.earth\nFor assistance with arranging interviews, please contact Stand.earth’s Canada Communications Specialists –\nKathryn Semogas, 778-653-2303, kathryn.semogas@stand.earth (Pacific Time)\nArin de Hoog, 613-978-7329, arin.dehoog@stand.earth (Eastern Time)",

    "text": "Los últimos días de 2023 estarán marcados en Galicia por una profunda borrasca situada al oeste de Irlanda. Sin embargo, el mal tiempo dará una tregua justo para celebrar el Fin de Año. Esta es la predicción de MeteoGalicia. La predicción para el sábado 30 de diciembre La entrada de un frente atlántico por el noroeste producirá este sábado precipitaciones débiles y dispersas en Galicia. Al final de la jornada se esperan fuertes vientos. Este temporal obligó a activar la alerta naranja en la costa de A Coruña por mar de viento. En la de Lugo y Pontevedra el aviso será amarillo por vientos de fuerza 7. En tierra también habrá alerta amarilla en las comarcas costeras de A Mariña y A Coruña, además de en las zonas de montaña de Lugo y Ourense, por vientos de más de 80 km/h. Las temperaturas serán propias de la época, con mínimas que oscilarán desde los 5 grados en Lugo a los 9º en Pontevedra y máximas que alcanzarán los 16º en Ferrol y A Coruña. La predicción para el domingo 31 de diciembre El temporal remitirá el último día del año, con el tiempo justo para celebrar Nochevieja sin lluvia. La situación, apunta MeteoGalicia, será tranquila en tierra durante el domingo, aunque en el mar las olas continuarán superando los cuatro metros en mar abierto. Venres e sábado agardamos tempo tranquilo. Pero, como virá a— MeteoGalicia (@MeteoGalicia) [#Noitevella]🥳? Estaremos entre dúas borrascas: A primeira deixará chuvia na mañá do 31 e a segunda na mañá do día 1. No medio quedaría tempo seco e frío. Pero todo pende dun fío. Atentos ás pantallas😉 [pic.twitter.com/zhRVYnjZKi] [December 28, 2023] La predicción para el lunes 1 de enero El año arrancará de nuevo con lluvias. A partir del lunes regresarán las precipitaciones en Galicia. Y no habrá cambios en los primeros días de 2024, en los que se espera que el cielo esté condicionado por un tren de borrascas.",
