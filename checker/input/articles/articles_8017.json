    "title": "Massive California waves injure some onlookers and bring flooding, treacherous beach conditions up the West coast - Local News 8",
    "text": "By Elizabeth Wolfe, Robert Shackelford and Cindy Von Quednow, CNN\n(CNN) — A powerful offshore storm is driving towering waves into the California coastline, triggering flooding and warnings of dangerous and damaging swells after several people were injured by a wave along Ventura beach on Thursday.\nThe wave crashed over a barrier along the southern California beach, tossing a wall of fast-moving water at a group of onlookers who rushed to escape the deluge, witness video shows. Seawater quickly knocked some people off their feet and pummeled cars as drivers tried to speed away.\nNearly 20 people were briefly swept away in the incident and eight people were taken to the hospital, Ventura officials said.\nHigh water and dangerous rip currents will churn along some of California’s beaches through the weekend as much of the West coast – spanning from the US-Mexico border to southern Oregon – is under coastal flood and high-surf alerts, the National Weather Service said.\nWaves as high as telephone poles – about 40 feet – could slam into San Francisco through Friday morning. Fifteen to 20-foot waves are expected along the central coast.\nThe dangerous conditions pose an “exceptional risk” of ocean drowning and damage to structures like piers and jetties, the National Weather Service said.\nThe spectacular waters have enthralled some surfers and onlookers, but weather officials are cautioning that the waves and strong rip tides can be perilous for those nearby.\n“Large breaking waves can cause injury, wash people off beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats near shore,” the National Weather Service warned.\nAt least one fisherman fell overboard in a harbor off Oxnard and later came ashore uninjured, the Ventura County Fire Department said.\nThe conditions have already caused some road closures and evacuations in coastal California communities and prompted the rescue of five campers along the San Luis Obispo coast.\nCrews in Ventura worked through the night to reinforce a mile-long sand barrier that was damaged by powerful waters on Thursday, the local fire department said. Standing about seven feet tall, the raised wall helps protect beachside communities.\nHoping to discourage spectators, local officials closed a main access point to Ventura Pier, which saw a swell of about 20 feet on Thursday. Some coastal streets in the area have also been closed as a precaution.\nIn central California’s Santa Cruz, the sheriff’s office issued an evacuation warning for some areas on Thursday, which included areas of Rio Del Mar, where seawater filled beachside roadways and pushed against some homes, CNN affiliate KION reported. The warnings were lifted later in the day.\nThe most extreme impacts were expected along the central and Ventura County coasts, along with Hermosa, Manhattan and Palos Verdes beaches, the weather service in Los Angeles said Thursday.\nTempestuous waters are also battering Northern California, where the Bay Area could see waves of 28 to 33 feet, the weather service advised.\nA high wind alert is also in effect for the Bay Area on Friday as wind gusts of up to 50 mph are expected.\nRainfall is likely to stretch northward from the Bay Area throughout the day Friday before shifting south into the weekend.\nMassive waves attract surfers to Mavericks\nDespite safety warnings, the massive waves are a welcome sight to surfers hungry to tackle the legendary swells at Mavericks Beach, about 25 miles south of San Francisco.\nPro surfers and spectators flocked to the beach on Thursday for a competition at the site known for having some of the biggest waves in the world, CNN affiliate KGO reported.\nLocal resident Ion Banner told the affiliate that surfers from Brazil, Tahiti and Hawaii were out in the water. “It’s pretty gnarly, it’s super big,” he said.\n“The waves looked absolutely massive and it was everything that we expected,” said Miguel Blanco, who told KGO he flew in from Portugal to surf the waves. “It was really big, I’d say 40-60 foot waves.”\nMavericks’ jaw-dropping waves – caused by unique underwater rock formations – reach their biggest heights in the winter, when big wave surfers from all over the world make pilgrimages to face the swells.\nThe legendary waves and the surfers who brave them have been the subject of several films and documentaries, including the 2012 biopic “Chasing Mavericks” about American surfer Jay Moriarity’s journey to surf Mavericks as a teen.\nOn Thursday, the conditions were prime for surfers like Blanco.\n“If it’s your turn, you just gotta go,” Blanco said. “When you see a big wave, you’re kinda scared but at the same time you’re feeling like you should go and you just go and enjoy the ride.”\nCNN’s David Williams contributed to this report.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Along with this, I will also get the privilege of inaugurating and laying the foundation stone of many more development projects, which will make the life of my family members in many areas of the country including Ayodhya and UP easier,\" PM Modi wrote on X in Hindi. भगवान श्री राम की नगरी अयोध्या में विश्वस्तरीय इंफ्रास्ट्रक्चर के विकास, कनेक्टिविटी में सुधार और यहां की समृद्ध विरासत के संरक्षण के लिए हमारी सरकार कृतसंकल्प है। इसी दिशा में कल नवनिर्मित एयरपोर्ट और पुनर्विकसित रेलवे स्टेशन का उद्घाटन करूंगा। इसके साथ ही कई और विकास परियोजनाओं… The day will culminate in a public program at 1 pm, where PM Modi will inaugurate, dedicate to the nation, and lay the foundation stones for several development projects.

Additionally, projects worth Rs 4,600 crore will be unveiled, targeting various areas across Uttar Pradesh. The other projects include a medical college, the Ayodhya bypass, a solid waste treatment, and five parking and commercial facilities. To welcome the prime minister, the holy city has been decked up with flowers, murals and thematic ornamental columns amid heavy security deployment. Huge posters with images of Modi have been put up at prominent locations here, while cut-outs of Lord Ram have been installed outside the redeveloped railway station. Elaborate security arrangements have been made along the Ram Path to the Ayodhya airport, located about 15 km from the main city. Devotional songs dedicated to Lord Ram played out on the streets here on Saturday morning while ringing of bells and holy chants at several temples filled the air. \"The prime minister is expected to reach Ayodhya airport around 10.45 am. After landing at the airport, he will head to the Ayodhya railway station where he will inaugurate the redeveloped railway station. He will then return to the airport, inaugurate the newly-bult airport and subsequently address a 'jan sabha' (public rally),\" Gaurav Dayal, Divisional Commissioner of Ayodhya, told PTI on Friday. About 1.5 lakh people are expected to assemble for the rally that will last nearly an hour, after which the prime minister will depart from Ayodhya, he added. In a statement on Friday, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's office said during PM Modi's visit, more than 1,400 performers will present folk art and cultural programmes in a total of 40 stages set up along the route from the airport to the railway station. The prime minister would hold a roadshow while travelling from the airport to the railway station and acknowledge the greetings of the people of Ayodhya, sources had earlier said.",

    "text": "The Digital Dilemma: Cell Phones vs. Playtime The ubiquity of cell phones has sparked a debate about thier impact on children, notably in the crucial early years. While some argue that children need access to technology, experts warn against excessive screen time, especially before the age of six.\nA Growing Concern: The Impact on Child Advancement\nResearch suggests that prolonged exposure to cell phones can negatively effect children’s physical and mental well-being. studies have linked excessive screen time to developmental delays, sleep disturbances, and attention problems. Furthermore, the sedentary nature of cell phone use can contribute to a decline in physical activity, increasing the risk of obesity and other health issues.\nThe Shifting Landscape of Play\nThe rise of cell phones has also had a profound impact on the toy industry. Toy retailers report a notable decline in sales, attributing it to children’s increasing preference for digital entertainment. Parents express concern that their children are becoming overly reliant on screens, neglecting traditional play activities that foster creativity, social skills, and creativity.\nFinding a Balance: Promoting Healthy Technology Habits\nExperts recommend setting clear limits on children’s cell phone use and encouraging alternative activities. Prioritize Playtime: Encourage children to engage in imaginative play, outdoor activities, and social interactions.\nCreate Tech-Free Zones: Designate specific areas and times as cell phone-free,such as mealtimes and bedrooms.\n* Lead by Example: Model healthy technology habits by limiting your own screen time and engaging in screen-free activities with your children.\nBy fostering a balanced approach to technology,parents can definitely help children develop healthy habits and reap the benefits of both the digital and physical worlds.\nKeep Children Away From Cell Phones Up to Six Years, Experts Advise\nWhy the Expert Consensus? Leading health organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the World Health Association (WHO), strongly recommend limiting or eliminating cell phone use for children under six. The reasons are multifaceted and centered around healthy development:\nBrain Development: Young children’s brains are rapidly developing. Excessive screen time can interfere with this crucial process, perhaps impacting language development, attention span, and social-emotional skills.\nVisual Health: The blue light emitted from cell phone screens can strain young eyes, potentially leading to short-sightedness and other vision problems.\nSleep Disruption: The light and stimulation from cell phones can disrupt melatonin production, making it harder for children to fall asleep and affecting the quality of their sleep.\nCognitive Skills: Interactive play and real-world experiences are essential for developing cognitive skills such as problem-solving,creativity,and critical thinking. Excessive screen time can hinder these crucial developmental milestones.\nSocial Skills: Face-to-face interactions are vital for children to learn social cues, develop empathy, and build strong relationships. Cell phone use can limit these opportunities.\nBenefits of a Cell Phone Free Childhood while avoiding cell phones might seem restrictive,the benefits for young children are significant:\nenhanced Language Development: Children learn language best through interaction with adults and peers. Limiting screen time allows for more opportunities for these crucial conversations.\nimproved Attention Span: Unstructured play and real-world exploration help children develop focus and attention skills, wich are essential for learning and success in school.\nStronger Social Skills: Playing with other children encourages cooperation, communication, and conflict resolution skills.\nEnhanced Creativity: Unstructured play allows children to use their imagination and create their own worlds and stories, fostering creativity and problem-solving abilities.\nBetter Sleep Patterns: A screen-free bedtime routine promotes healthier sleep habits, leading to improved mood, behavior, and overall well-being.\nPractical Tips for Implementing Screen-free Time Set Limits Early: establish clear screen time guidelines from a young age, emphasizing the importance of other activities.\nCreate Screen-Free Zones: Designate certain areas of the home,such as the bedroom and dining room,as screen-free zones.\nLead by Example: Children learn by observing.Limit your own cell phone use when interacting with your child.\nOffer Alternatives: Provide engaging alternatives to screen time, such as:\nReading together: Share stories and encourage a love of books.\nOutdoor Play: Parks, playgrounds, and nature walks offer endless opportunities for exploration and physical activity.\nArts and crafts: Encourage creativity through drawing, painting, sculpting, and other hands-on activities.\nBuilding Blocks: Building with blocks fosters spatial reasoning, problem-solving, and fine motor skills.\nBoard Games: family game nights are a fun way to bond and develop social skills.\nSchedule Tech-Free Time: Designate specific times each day as screen-free, such as during meals or family time.\nTech Breaks: If your child does use a device, encourage regular breaks to avoid eye strain and promote movement.\nTalk to Your Child: Explain why screen time is limited and encourage them to share their thoughts and feelings.\nSeek Support: Connect with other parents and caregivers to share tips and strategies for managing screen time.\nCase Studies: Real-World Impacts Numerous studies and anecdotal evidence illustrate the positive impacts of limiting screen time on young children:\nImproved Sleep: A study published in the journal Pediatrics found that children who were exposed to less screen time before bed had better sleep quality and duration.\nEnhanced Language Skills: Research suggests that children who engage in more interactive play and conversation with adults have larger vocabularies and better language comprehension skills.\nIncreased Attention Span: Studies have shown that children who spend more time playing outdoors and engaging in unstructured activities have longer attention spans.",

    "title": "Alabama justice who ruled embryos are people says American law should be rooted in the Bible",
    "text": "On the same day that Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Tom Parker handed down an opinion declaring that fertilized frozen embryos are people, imperiling women’s access to in vitro fertilization treatments, he espoused support for a once-fringe philosophy that calls on evangelical Christians to reshape society based on their interpretation of the Bible. During an online broadcast hosted by Tennessee evangelist Johnny Enlow on Friday, Parker suggested America was founded explicitly as a Christian nation and discussed his embrace of the Seven Mountains Mandate — the belief that conservative Christians are meant to rule over seven key areas of American life, including media, business, education and government. “God created government, and the fact that we have let it go into the possession of others, it’s heartbreaking,” Parker said in the interview, first reported this week by Media Matters for America, a liberal nonprofit media watchdog. “That’s why he is calling and equipping people to step back into these mountains right now.” Hours before the interview was published, Parker issued a concurring opinion in a case in which he and his fellow justices ruled that frozen embryos have the same rights as living children under Alabama’s Wrongful Death of a Minor Act. Parker wrote that Alabama had adopted a “theologically based view of the sanctity of life” and that “life cannot be wrongfully destroyed without incurring the wrath of a holy God.” To support his legal opinion, Parker repeatedly cited the book of Genesis, including a passage asserting that all people are created in God’s image. “Even before birth, all human beings bear the image of God,” Parker wrote, “and their lives cannot be destroyed without effacing his glory.” Parker did not respond to messages requesting comment. In a written statement, Enlow said, in his view, the Seven Mountains Mandate encourages Christians to fight for their values in government and elsewhere to aid “in the healing of society.” “It is not sinister to desire a voice and relevance in political matters,” said Enlow, who in 2020 suggested that then-President Donald Trump could impose martial law to remain in office following his electoral defeat. “I am pretty sure that is why every citizen takes the time to vote.” Parker’s statements — in his remarks to Enlow and in his written opinion — are the latest examples of Republican politicians and elected officials embracing the Christian nationalist view that America’s laws should be rooted in a fundamentalist reading of the Bible. The Alabama chief justice’s embrace of the Seven Mountains Mandate, in particular, signaled the growing influence of a once-fringe political and religious theology that’s been spreading in recent years among certain segments of evangelical Christians, said Matthew D. Taylor, a senior scholar at the Institute for Islamic, Christian, and Jewish Studies in Maryland. “The Seven Mountains is not about democracy,” said Taylor, who has studied the role Christian extremism played in efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election and the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. “In fact, I would argue that the Seven Mountains itself is a vision that is antidemocratic.” Adherents of the ideology have grown in prominence and power in the years since the 2016 election, when Trump became an unlikely hero of the Christian right and cultivated relationships with celebrity pastors who preach the Seven Mountains Mandate. Parker is the latest in a line of prominent Republicans to openly embrace the concept, Taylor said. Charlie Kirk, the MAGA influencer and founder of Turning Point USA, celebrated the GOP’s shift under Trump when he told attendees at the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2020, “Finally we have a president that understands the seven mountains of cultural influence.” In 2022, Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado called on attendees at a political conference hosted by a group with a mission to “reform the nation via the Seven Mountains” to “rise up” and place “God back at the center of our country.” House Speaker Mike Johnson, the nation’s highest-ranking Republican, also has ties to pastors and activists who preach the Seven Mountains. Johnson, like Parker, has aligned himself with the evangelical activist and self-styled historian David Barton, a leading promoter of the idea that America was founded as a Christian nation whose laws should reflect biblical principles. Barton and other Seven Mountains proponents argue that the idea of separation of church and state, regarded by many as a bedrock of American democracy, is a myth invented by progressives based on a misreading of Thomas Jefferson’s famous 1802 letter to the Danbury Baptists. And any laws or court rulings limiting the influence of religion in schools and government — such as the U.S. Supreme Court’s 1962 and 1963 decisions banning mandatory public school prayer and Bible readings — are an affront to America’s true founding. These ideas aren’t only gaining influence among preachers and politicians, experts say. In a survey last year, Paul Djupe, a political scientist at Denison University, found that about 20% of American adults — and 30% of Christians — agreed with the statement that “God wants Christians to stand atop the ‘7 mountains of society,’ including the government, education, media, and others.” Prior to conducting the survey, Djupe expected to discover only marginal support for the Seven Mountains concept. “It turns out,” he said, “a substantial number of Americans believe these things.” Parker echoed Barton’s views about America’s founding during his interview with Enlow, after Enlow asked the chief justice to comment on the growing use of the phrase “Christian nationalism” among those who support the separation of church and state. “This is an undefined term that’s being thrown around now to label people, and I have no idea what they mean by or what should be meant by it,” said Parker, who then defended his view that America’s “original form of government” was based on the Bible. “It’s constitutional,” Parker said. “It’s our foundation.” The Alabama ruling dealing with in vitro fertilization, or IVF, offers a picture of what that worldview might look like in practice and how it might affect the lives of regular citizens, Taylor said. After Parker and his colleagues issued their ruling, the state’s largest hospital paused IVF treatments while it considered the legal repercussions of the decision. Taylor said it was “jaw-dropping” to hear a state supreme court chief justice espousing a theology that he views as antidemocratic “while making very extreme decisions.” But, he added, “this is the new reality of our politics.”",
