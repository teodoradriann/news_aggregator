    "text": "Lo Sciopero Generale proclamato da Cgil e Uil contro la manovra finanziaria del Governo Meloni ha acceso il dibattito all’interno del panorama sindacale italiano. In particolare, l’ex segretario della Cisl, Savino Pezzotta, ha duramente criticato la decisione dell’attuale leader della confederazione, Luigi Sbarra, di non aderire alla protesta, accusandolo di aver allontanato la Cisl dalla sua storia e dai suoi valori fondanti. La Cisl non aderisce allo Sciopero Generale, Pezzotta: “Un errore storico non cercare unità sindacale” Intervenendo a Radio Radicale, Pezzotta ha espresso preoccupazione per la linea adottata dalla dirigenza della Cisl, che ha scelto di sostenere la manovra del Governo Meloni e di non partecipare allo Sciopero. “La Cisl non è mai stata vicina ai governi di destra. Dissociarsi dalle altre confederazioni è un errore che mette in discussione la capacità del movimento sindacale di rispondere alle sfide del presente,” ha dichiarato Pezzotta.Leggi su Scuolalink.it Scuolalink.it - Sciopero Generale, Pezzotta contro Sbarra: ‘Errore storico non unirsi a Cgil e Uil’ - Sciopero, l’ex segretario Cisl Pezzotta contro Sbarra: “Errore non unirsi a Cgil e a Uil, mai… - Cisl, la carica dei 103 contro Sbarra.

    "text": "A new model to help scientists understand the many influences on young corals finding a \"forever home\" on a reef has been developed by researchers from the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) and The University of Western Australia (UWA).\nThe model can help identify what type of local conditions might maximise restoration actions that use larvae seeding .\nWhen corals reproduce, or spawn, tiny larvae drift around the reef. These coral larvae need to find a suitable reef surface to settle on and begin growing.\nThere are many factors influencing where they end up calling home: water movements or currents driven by waves and tides, the types of reef surface larvae prefer, and which types of reef habitats they encounter as they drift across the reef.\nBut deciphering how these processes interact and influence settlement remain largely unexplored because of the difficultly in observing and measuring the dispersal and settlement of tiny coral larvae in the wild.\nLead author on the study, AIMS@UWA PhD candidate Molly-Mae Baker said the model would help to address key gaps in scientific knowledge.\n\"There's still so much we don't know about how coral larvae settle and attach to a place where they will spend the rest of their lives,\" she said.\n\"So far, studies in controlled environments like aquariums have tended to focus on one factor at a time in relation to settlement and have not been able to fully consider how interactions between factors could be affecting where the larvae settle in the wild.\n\"Our model takes into account the interactions between three main factors - currents, the type of surface corals prefer like sand, rocks or coral rubble, and how these are all configured in the environment.\"\nUnexpected patterns of settlement\nThe scientists tested the model with a variety of scenarios and found the interactions could lead to contrasting and unexpected patterns of coral larvae settlement, including conclusions regarding the surfaces larvae prefer for settlement.\n\"We would expect larvae to settle in the highest abundances on the surfaces they find most attractive on a reef,\" said Ms Baker.\n\"Instead, we found that different types of currents could sometimes influence coral larvae to settle on less attractive surfaces. The interactions between the factors also influenced the number of corals that were able to settle successfully. For example, settlement was generally lower in scenarios with no currents compared to the other hydrodynamic conditions we tested.\n\"What emerged was highly variable patterns of settlement.\"\nThe scientists also applied their model to a case study site on Ningaloo Reef off the Western Australian coast, finding that multiple factors could interact to produce unexpected patterns of settlement in these more complex natural environments.\nThe model will help scientists optimise their field-based sampling methods as well as identify what type of local conditions might maximise restoration success.\nCo-author Dr Anna Cresswell, from AIMS, said understanding settlement processes across small scales is important for predicting population growth and ecosystem recovery from disturbance events.\n\"As pressure grows on coral reef systems from climate change and other natural and anthropogenic disturbances, there is a pressing need for models like this one to help us understand more precisely the many processes that underpin coral reef recovery,\" she said.\nThe paper was published in the journal Ecological Modelling: Modelling interactive effects of biological and environmental factors on fine-scale coral settlement patterns - ScienceDirect .\nThe research was supported by The University of Western Australia and the Australian Coral Reef Resilience Initiative (ACRRI), which is jointly funded by BHP and the Australian Institute of Marine Science.\nhere.",

    "text": "Warangal: Historian Prof Mridula Mukherjee criticised both the Uttar Pradesh and Central governments for treating the inaugural ceremony of the Ram temple in Ayodhya as a ‘state-sponsored event.’ She emphasised that while it’s acceptable for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to attend the programme as an individual, doing so in his capacity as the Prime Minister could be inappropriate due to the constitutional position he holds.\nDuring an interaction with the media at the Indian History Congress at Kakatiya University (KU) campus here on Friday, she clarified that she and her colleagues didn’t align themselves with any political party. However, she strongly criticised the incumbent Central government for neglecting what she termed as the ‘authentic history.’\nAlso Read Yogi govt bans liquor around Ram temple in Ayodhya PM Modi to carry Ram idol to new temple: Sources Mukherjee stressed that it is the responsibility of governments to create employment opportunities for students studying and researching history, asserting that being tourist guides at monuments shouldn’t fall under the purview of history students.\nOn a parallel note, IHC General President Prof Aditya Mukherjee criticised the Centre for attempting to conceal history and propagate certain myths for their political gains. He highlighted the importance of people being well-informed about history to avoid falling prey to false propaganda.\nAdditionally, the second day of the IHC session saw three simultaneous sessions. Prof Syed Ali Nadeem Rezavi, the Secretary of IHC, said that the sessions included 22 research papers on ‘Dalit history,’ over 10 papers on ‘Reconstructing Indian Economic History’ by the Aligarh Historians Society, and 12 papers presented at the IHC Panel on ‘Deccan: Past and Present.’",
