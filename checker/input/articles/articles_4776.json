    "text": "Bimbo di due anni ingoia un pezzo di un giocattolo e muore al Gemelli di Roma: aperta indagine sul decesso Un bimbo di due anni è morto per aver ingerito un pezzo di un gioco: inutili le corse in ospedale, dove è arrivato in condizioni critiche Pubblicato il: Un bimbo di due anni è morto al Policlinico Gemelli di Roma dopo aver ingerito un pezzo di un giocattolo. Il piccolo, arrivato in codice rosso e in arresto cardiaco, è deceduto in struttura dove era stato trasferito d’urgenza dall’ospedale di Monterotondo. Bimbo di due anni morto al Gemelli Le condizioni del bambino sono sin da subito apparse preoccupanti quando i genitori si sono resi conto che qualcosa non andava bene nel suo respiro. Arrivati in ospedale a Monterotondo, in provincia di Roma, il piccolo è stato visitato d’urgenza ed è stata notata una ostruzione nell’esofago. Immediato il trasferimento con l’elicottero del 118 al policlinico Gemelli, dove però il piccolo è deceduto. La scoperta dei genitori A chiamare i soccorsi, a casa, erano stati i genitori che si sono accorti che qualcosa non andava bene quando hanno sentito il bambino rantolare mentre dormiva. Hanno subito chiamato il 118 e il medico dell’ospedale di Monterotondo che lo ha visitato d’urgenza ha visto alcuni pezzi di un giocattolo nell’esofago. Ma nonostante la corsa in ospedale e il successivo trasferimento al Gemelli il piccolo non ha avuto scampo. Aperta indagine Il magistrato Arianna Armanini, della procura di Tivoli, ha quindi deciso di aprire un fascicolo d’inchiesta con l’ipotesi di reato di omicidio colposo contro ignoti. Sono stati quindi disposti accertamenti sulla provenienza e sul tipo di giocattolo ingoiato dal bimbo nella sua abitazione a Monterotondo. In una nota, il policlinico Gemelli ha spiegato che il bambino è arrivato in ospedale già in morte cerebrale dopo oltre un’ora di rianimazione cardiopolmonare. I genitori hanno dato il consenso al prelievo degli organi, che è stato già eseguito.",

    "title": "Barriers to G20 Billionaire Tax Plan Are a Blessing in Disguise",
    "text": "A new proposal showcased at the G20 [aims](https://news.bloombergtax.com/daily-tax-report-international/g-20-plan-calls-for-billionaires-to-pay-2-of-wealth-in-taxes) to coordinate countries to tax at least 2% of the net wealth of billionaires—and it remains open to extending that tax to centimillionaires as well. This plan would be extraordinarily difficult to administer and enforce and would struggle to pass constitutional muster in the US, especially in light of the Supreme Court’s recent Moore v. United States [ruling](https://news.bloombergtax.com/daily-tax-report/democrats-wealth-tax-dreams-look-dim-after-supreme-court-ruling). The economic drawback to taxing a percentage of wealth annually is that it creates an incentive to consume resources quickly, rather than reinvest them into longer term projects. Consider a taxpayer who wins a lottery and becomes subject to a 2% annual wealth tax for the first time. That taxpayers must choose between using a dollar on immediate consumption or investing it for five years, or 10 years. A wealth tax plan wouldn’t levy these three activities equally. Instead, it would tax them at 0%, roughly 10%, and roughly 20%, respectively. We should generally eschew taxes that fall unequally like this, especially when they’re biased against long-term investments. Money reinvested into capital goods makes the world more productive, while money spent on consumption goods doesn’t. The reinvestment of Elon Musk’s PayPal wealth into Tesla Inc. and SpaceX was more socially beneficial than lavish personal spending would have been. The administration and enforcement of any wealth-based tax is unusually difficult, even if authorities attempt to do so faithfully. Wealth-based taxes don’t have market transactions to measure against in the way that income-based taxes do. Authorities instead must invent rules of thumb for valuation, cobbled together from a variety of sources such as comparable assets, multiples of income generated, or multiples of balance sheet value. Taxpayers will inevitably appeal these numbers as arbitrary and incorrect, and often be right in doing so. Worse yet, taxpayers proactively invent complex asset types to trick authorities. In the US, residence trusts sometimes split the right to a home’s price appreciation away from the right to live in the home. Such structures often are designed to reduce effective estate tax liability. Uneven Enforcement Defining and evaluating wealth is difficult, even for a jurisdiction doing its best. But some jurisdictions may implement a wealth tax unfaithfully. The theory of tax competition says small jurisdictions benefit greatly from attracting global income and assets, even if taxed at a very low rate. From the perspective of a tiny country with a tiny budget, a little bit of tax on vast global wealth (generated mostly outside the country’s borders) goes a long way. These jurisdictions will tend to offer extremely low tax rates. Coordination among countries could solve tax competition in theory, but not in practice. Small jurisdictions may agree nominally to a minimum tax, but they’ll still have an incentive to attract global income and assets, for example, by agreeing to low valuations provided by taxpayers or creating rules that systematically undervalue classes of asset. The proposed minimum tax is said to be inspired in part by Pillar Two’s 15% global minimum tax on corporate income. But there are already signs some jurisdictions will comply with the strict text of the Pillar Two framework more than the spirit. Bermuda is putting together [laws](https://www.gov.bm/sites/default/files/2023-11/Bermuda%20Begins%20Third%20Public%20Consultation%20and%20issues%20Illustrative%20Draft%20Legislation%20for%20Corporate%20Income%20Tax.pdf) that would both comply with the 15% minimum but also return money to global corporations through qualified refundable tax credits. In the government’s words, the goal of this package is to “maintain Bermuda’s attractiveness.” Put another way, Bermuda intends to continue participating in tax competition despite the Pillar Two agreement. In the same vein, small jurisdictions that pursue tax-competitive strategies would have incentive to enforce a wealth tax lightly, if at all. The combination of administrative difficulties and tax competition have made wealth taxes relatively scarce in practice, as countries abandon them for better policy tools. Just [four](https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/eu/wealth-tax-impact/) OECD countries have net wealth taxes today, down from a high of 12 countries three decades ago. US Barriers In the US, constitutional law is a significant barrier to enactment of any wealth tax. An unwieldy constitutional requirement (Article 1, Section 2) for apportionment among states by population makes many taxes unfeasible. The 16th Amendment, which permits an income tax, offers a respite from the apportionment requirement. But an income tax isn’t the same as a wealth tax, and the recent Moore [opinion](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/22-800_jg6o.pdf) suggests that the Supreme Court is skeptical that the 16th Amendment permits the taxation of unrealized gains. Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Samuel Alito wrote that “the answer is straightforward: no.” Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch wrote that 16th Amendment income “refers only to income realized by the taxpayer.” Only one more justice would need to join these four to create a majority against the constitutionality of taxing unrealized gains. Gabriel Zucman, the wealth tax proponent, argues that wealth taxes—for example, by turning a wealth figure into an implied income figure—can be designed to fall within an income tax framework, [ but certain counterexamples present difficulties.](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-tax-report/g-20-plan-calls-for-billionaires-to-pay-2-of-wealth-in-taxes) Consider a wealthy founder and shareholder of a valuable company whose value declines during the year, and who doesn’t sell any of his shares. Such a shareholder would have high wealth but negative unrealized income and no realized income. It likely would be difficult to justify a tax on this shareholder in income tax terms, despite his wealth. The substantial administrative and constitutional barriers to a wealth tax probably will keep the policy from moving beyond the proposal stage. But given the economic drawback of a wealth tax, the barriers to setting one up are a blessing in disguise.

    "text": "The book will pay homage to brother Eddie Van Halen\nThis fall, Alex Van Halen will pay tribute to his brother and bandmate Eddie Van Halen with\nBrothers. HarperCollins will release the book in a variety of formats on October 22nd. It is described as “an intimate and open account—nothing like any rock-and-roll memoir you’ve ever read.”\nAlex Van Halen shares his personal story of family, friendship, music and brotherly love in a remarkable tribute to his beloved brother and bandmate.\nTold with acclaimed New Yorker writer Ariel Levy Brothers is seventy-year-old drummer Alex Van Halen’s love letter to his younger brother, Edward, (maybe “Ed,” but never “Eddie”), written while still mourning his untimely death.\nIn his rough yet sweet voice, Alex recounts the brothers’ childhood, first in the Netherlands and then in working-class Pasadena, California, with an itinerant musician father and a very proper Indonesian-born mother—the kind of mom who admonished her boys to “always wear a suit” no matter how famous they became—a woman who was both proud and practical, nonchalant about taking a doggie bag from a star-studded dinner. He also shares tales of musical politics, infighting, and plenty of bad-boy behavior. But mostly his is a story of brotherhood, music, and enduring love.\n“I was with him from day one,” Alex writes. “We shared the experience of coming to this country and figuring out how to fit in. We shared a record player, an 800-square-foot house, a mom and dad, and a work ethic. Later, we shared the back of a tour bus, alcoholism, the experience of becoming famous, of becoming fathers and uncles, and of spending more hours in the studio than I’ve spent doing anything else in this life. We shared a depth of understanding that most people can only hope to achieve in a lifetime.”\nThere has never been an accurate account of them or the band, and Alex wants to set the record straight on Edward’s life and death.\nBrothers includes never-before-seen photos from the author’s private archives.\nEddie Van Halen\npassed away in October 2020 at the age of 65 after suffering from a stroke with pneumonia, a blood disorder known as myelodysplastic syndrome, and lung cancer as underlying causes. Van Halen had been battling the disease since 2000 but was declared cancer-free in 2002, only for it to return in 2011. He rarely spoke about his well-being, but he confirmed a third of his tongue was removed upon initial treatments early on. Shortly before his death, he had begun another round of chemo and was in and out of the hospital throughout the year, mostly due to intestional issues.",

    "text": "TEMPE - First Solar, Inc. (Nasdaq: FSLR) today commissioned a new research and development (R&D) innovation center in Lake Township, Ohio , believed to be the largest facility of its kind in the Western Hemisphere.\nThe Jim Nolan Center for Solar Innovation is dedicated to the late James 'Jim' F. Nolan\n, a former member of First Solar's Board of Directors and the architect of the company's cadmium telluride (CdTe) semiconductor platform. The facility covers 1.3 million square feet and includes a high-tech pilot manufacturing line allowing for the production of full-sized prototypes of thin film and tandem PV modules. Prior to the commissioning of the Jim Nolan Center, First Solar utilized a manufacturing line at its Perrysburg facility for its late-stage product development efforts. This arrangement limited the flexibility for development efforts and created constraints when mission-critical tools had to go offline. By resolving these limitations and constraints, the new facility is expected to accelerate innovation cycles.\n'Thin films are the next technological battleground for the solar industry because they are key to commercializing tandem devices, which are anticipated to be the next disruption in photovoltaics,' said Mark Widmar\n, chief executive officer, First Solar . 'While the United States leads the world in thin film PV, China is racing to close the innovation gap. We expect that this crucial investment in R&D infrastructure will help maintain our nation's strategic advantage in thin film, accelerating the cycles of innovation needed to ensure that the next disruptive, transformative solar technology will be American-made.' The Jim Nolan Center is part of an approximately half-billion dollar investment by First Solar in R&D infrastructure, and the company expects to also commission a perovskite development line at its Perrysburg, Ohio , campus in the second half of 2024. The company, which has invested almost $2 billion in R&D, operates laboratories in Santa Clara, California , and Perrysburg, Ohio , in the US, and Uppsala in Sweden . Significantly, First Solar's California Technology Center (CTC) in Santa Clara recently achieved a 23.1% efficient CdTe cell, a new world record certified by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).\nFirst Solar , founded in 1999 and celebrating 25 years of operations this year, is unique among the world's largest solar manufacturers for being the only US-headquartered company and for scaling the production of thin film solar panels. The company exited 2023 with 16.6 gigawatts (GW) of annual global nameplate manufacturing capacity and is expected to achieve over 25 GW of capacity by 2026. First Solar expects to commission new manufacturing facilities in Alabama in the second half of 2024 and Louisiana in the second half of 2025, bringing its total US nameplate capacity to 14 GW by 2026.\nThe company's ongoing and planned investments in the R&D infrastructure are projected to create approximately 300 new jobs by 2025, the majority of which will be located at the Jim Nolan Center. First Solar's investments in US manufacturing and R&D are believed to make it the most significant enabler of American jobs among solar manufacturers.\nAccording to a recent study conducted by the University of Louisiana at Lafayette and commissioned by First Solar , the company supported an estimated 16,245 direct, indirect, and induced jobs in 2023, representing approximately $1.6 billion in annual labor income. As First Solar grows to an expected 14 GW in annual US nameplate capacity by 2026, it is forecast to support an estimated 30,060 direct, indirect, and induced jobs across the country, representing $2.8 billion in annual labor income. The study projects that every direct job First Solar supports in 2026 will support 7.3 jobs nationwide.\nAbout First Solar, Inc.\nFirst Solar is a leading American solar technology company and global provider of responsibly produced eco-efficient solar modules advancing the fight against climate change. Developed at R&D labs in California and Ohio , the company's advanced thin film PV modules represent the next generation of solar technologies, providing a competitive, high-performance, lower-carbon alternative to conventional crystalline silicon PV modules. From raw material sourcing and manufacturing through end-of-life module recycling, First Solar's approach to technology embodies sustainability and a responsibility towards people and the planet.
