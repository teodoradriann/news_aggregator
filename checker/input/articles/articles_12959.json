    "text": "Wilmington, NC based Bryter Restoration of Wilmington is reaching out to local homeowners to share some tips that can help them prepare for the winter months. The locally owned business is dedicated to providing the community high quality services. This includes 24-hour availability for quality water damage restoration services in Wilmington and all surrounding areas of New Hanover, Brunswick and Pender Counties.\nBryter Restoration says, “Winter and the holiday season that comes along with it can be very beautiful, but like everything else in life, there are things you are going to have to look out for during winter months. For homeowners, a key concern is going to be preventing unexpected damage to their home from a burst water pipe or a leaky roof. Should something go wrong during the holiday season, it's going to put a damper on the mood and ruin what should otherwise be a fun time. The good thing is that there are preventative measures any homeowner can take.”\nBefore considering any specific actions, the company says maintaining an adequate temperature inside the home can go a long way in preventing unnecessary damage. Bryter Restoration recommends keeping the temperature in the house above freezing, especially in areas where pipes are located. This can be done by maintaining a constant indoor temperature or using additional heating devices (like space heaters).\nIn fact, burst pipes are one of the biggest risks homes face during the winter season. As the temperature drops, the risk of burst water pipes increases. When water freezes, it expands, putting pressure on pipes and potentially causing them to burst. A burst water pipe can lead to flooding, water damage and a completely unnecessary headache.\nHomeowners looking to prevent this should take care to insulate critical areas, as this provides protection against the freezing and expansion of water within the pipes. Bryter Restoration of Wilmington shares that homeowners should pay extra attention to colder rooms and areas such as the attic, basement and so on. They should do the same for certain outdoor spaces, such as garages.\nThe company recommends the use of polyethylene pipe lagging material, a flexible foam specifically designed for water pipe insulation. This insulation should be slid onto the pipes, covering them completely, with no gaps left at bends, fittings or valves.\nThe company also shares that homeowners should disconnect and drain outdoor hoses — and shut off the water supply to outdoor taps. This prevents water from freezing and expanding within the pipes, reducing the risk of bursts. However, even with careful preparation, the worst can still happen. Should there be an unpreventable burst water pipe, homeowners should immediately turn off the water supply at the main stopcock, shut off the central heating and then open taps to drain the system.\nHomeowners will also want to possibly get their roofs inspected, which can be a critically important step when preparing a house for winter. Winter storms, including heavy rain and especially hail, can end up wreaking havoc on a roof, so it is important that they take the initiative to repair any damage before their roof is exposed to the worst of winter weather. Homeowners who cannot access their roof can and should have it inspected by a contractor. Contractors will also be able to take care of any minor repairs that are needed. While this might be an unexpected expense, it will be far more affordable than dealing with any damages caused by a leaky roof over the winter.\nBryter Restoration was formed after many years of water damage restoration work in the Carolinas . The members of the team have undertaken numerous projects following storms and hurricanes over the last 15 years, and they boast decades of combined experience serving the families of Wilmington and the Carolinas. In addition to providing their services to the city of Wilmington, Bryter Restoration of Wilmington’s service areas also include the surrounding cities, such as Wrightsville Beach, Myrtle Beach, Moorehead City, Carolina Beach and more.\nAnyone looking for water damage cleanup services in Wilmington or who simply wants to learn more about the services provided by Bryter Restoration of Wilmington should visit the company’s website to get started. The company encourages interested parties to directly get in touch via email or phone.

    "text": "[Skip to main content](#main)\nGet a rabbit at a reduced rate: Guelph Humane Society encouraging more adoptions\nThe Guelph Humane Society is offering rabbits at a reduced rate because they simply have too many.\nThey are hoping this helps with more adoptions considering they are experiencing what they call a bunny crisis, with 13 currently available for adoption.\n“In 2021, we saw the number of rabbits coming into our care triple,” said Lisa Veit, the society’s executive director. “But over the last 12 months or so, we have had a decline in interest in adoptions. And again, that’s being seen in shelters across North America.”\nThe number of lost or abandoned rabbits coming into care remains high and the average length of stay is significantly longer than other types of pets.\nWhile rabbits are not as well-understood as other pets, the humane society says they make good companion animals.\n“They are fun, they’re trainable, they’re affectionate creatures. Some of the things you get out of owning a cat and a dog are some of the same things you get out of owning a rabbit,” said Melissa Stolz, intake and behavior coordinator at the humane society.\nUntil March 15, bunny adoption fees are reduced to $75, from the regular adoption fee of $160.\nAll rabbits available are spayed or neutered, and are up-to-date with vaccines.\nTo see the bunnies available for adoption, you can visit the\nhumane society’s website.\nKitchener Top Stories\nCTVNews.ca Top Stories\nQuebec Appeal Court rules secularism law is constitutional, English schools rebuffed\nThe Quebec Court of Appeal ruled Thursday that the province's secularism law is constitutional and a lower court was wrong to exempt English school boards from the law, known as Bill 21.\nAnand 'very surprised' to learn DND employee's company got ArriveCan contract, Poilievre calls for police probe\nNews that the CEO of Dalian Enterprises, which received $7.9 million for its work on the ArriveCan app, was also an employee of the Department of National Defence (DND) was a 'surprise' to former defence minister Anita Anand.\nSinger Cat Janice dies at 31, after writing final song for young son\nCat Janice, a singer who reached hundreds of thousands through social media, has died at age 31 following a battle with a rare form of cancer.\n'Complete his mission': Criminal psychologist theorizes Sask. mass killer's motives\nMyles Sanderson was most likely on his way to kill his ex-partner and “complete his mission” when officers forced him off the highway and arrested him, according to a criminal psychologist.\nA frog in India has a mushroom sprouting out of it.

Seguro que es capaz de decir que esos niños han sido vendidos y no puede pedirse su devolución o algo similar.\n[#6](c6#c-6) [#42](c42#c-42) [#46](c46#c-46)\nEn serio, por qué perdéis el tiempo con esta gente? Bloqueo y a vivir. Están aquí para joder, nada más.\nNo os llega con Ana Rosa, la Griso, Ferreras, Losantos, Herrera, ABC, El Mundo, etc? Aquí tenéis la oportunidad de taparles la boca a esta gentecilla que a saber por qué están aquí diciendo estas chorradas\n\"Según la organización pro derechos humanos Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo, cerca de 500 bebés fueron robados por la dictadura a sus progenitores, en su mayoría opositores al régimen. En muchos casos, sostiene la organización, las madres que dieron a luz en centros clandestinos de detención y tortura, fueron desaparecidas para siempre, asesinadas o tiradas con vida al mar.\"\nengendros del averno\n[#52](c52#c-52) uff el cansino ese del mensaje kilométrico?\nEse también está entre mis excepciones, igual que el que repetía le mensaje en cada noticia del bitcoin.\nPero es que yo los insultos del calibre de este usuario es que debería estar baneado por el resto del los días.\n[#37](c37#c-37) Pero aún no tienes a ese ente en el ignore? si de cada 10 palabras 20 son insultos...\nLuego preguntan porqué meneame se va al garete..\n[#48](c48#c-48) No uso mucho el ignore, solo tengo a un usuario, el que no quiere hacer crecer a sus hijos en la miseria...\n[#29](c29#c-29) Vaya, qué sorpresa, uno de los seres con mayor nivel de miseria de esta web, y mira que el nivel es alto, alegrándose de que no puedan investigarse los secuestros de niños en una dictadura. Por lo que sea, eh?\nPues ya solo con el banco genético que ha creado ya tiene mayor utilidad que la que puedan tener 10000 seres como tú en 10000 vidas.\n[#31](c31#c-31) ¿Quién se ha alegrado de nada?\nResultados, hay un estudio genético, ok, ¿Cuales son los resultados?\nTu si que eres miserable...\n[#27](c27#c-27) La cuestión es si es necesario un organismo solo para eso o puede derivarse a otro ya existente.\n[#56](c56#c-56) Si tienes empatía, dona a una ONG o asociación que realice esa tarea. Que yo no quiera que esto sea financiado coercitivamente/via impuestos no significa en absoluto que esté en contra de que se realice la tarea, de forma privada.\nLa empatía, con el dinero propio, no con el ajeno.\nEl gobierno dice que el organismo actuaba \"por iniciativa propia, para la individualización de los responsables de posibles hechos criminales\"\nA los que defienden la libertad no les gusta que los organismos sean independientes, sobre todo estos organismos que TIENEN LA OBLIGACION de ser independientes de cualquier gobierno o ideología política.\nEspero que alguien viole la LOPD y ponga esos archivos a salvo\n[#53](c53#c-53) Lo que tú digas, se ha pagado de impuestos por 40 años la investigación de todo esto, más que suficiente.\n40 años después de la dictadura y después de 20 años de trabajo la verdad que ya deberían haber resuelto el tema... o la cuestión es perpetuarse como organismo? En Argentina no sobra el dinero público y deben recortar si quieren seguir teniendo un país habitable, pero algunos piensan que imprimiendo dinero se solucionaria todo, como los niños de 5 años...\n[#70](c70#c-70) El liberalismo se basa en la moral como principio básico, así que difícil. Más fácil si eres socialista o fascista, que viene a ser lo mismo.\n[#23](c23#c-23) Es lo que sospecho, se centran en el número de niños robados, los que reconocen ciertos organismos y los que reconoce el gobierno, pero ¿y los logros de este organismo? ¿cuál es la justificación del gasto? ¿Hay que soltar billetes aunque no haya resultados?\n[#4](c4#c-4) Ni de ti me esperaba defender semejante indignidad. Tiempo suficiente es todo el necesario para la resolución de todos los casos de un crimen tan atroz como es robar seres humanos. Y son cientos.\n[#10](c10#c-10) Semejante personaje despreciable. Como si fuera una \"investigación\" que tarda un tiempo concreto. Es un organismo que se encarga de hacer pruebas de ADN a la población para buscar familiares cercanos de gente que en la mayoría de los casos es por sospecha que puede ser un niño robado o los familiares terminan confesando...\nNo se puede caer más bajo que defender algo así.\n[#10](c10#c-10) No sé cómo te aguantas y llamas simplemente «indigno» a un saco de mierda así. En serio, todo mi respeto a tu templanza\n[#4](c4#c-4) Han tenido 20 años para investigar eso\nEso no es completamente cierto. En el artículo dicen claramente que fue fundada en el 92. No han tenido 20 años, han tenido 30.\nY teniendo en cuenta que 10 años antes ya estaba la Comisión Nacional por la Desaparición de Personas que hacía lo mismo y cuyas funciones luego asumió el organismo que ha cerrado Milei, en realidad han tenido 40 años.\n[#28](c28#c-28) Hace 40 años no habia la capacidad de hacer tests genéticos en cantidad, disponibilidad y coste como la que hay ahora.\n[#38](c38#c-38) Las pruebas genéticas para investigar la filiación con personas desaparecidas las lleva el Banco Nacional de Datos Genéticos y son gratuitas. Para quien tiene sospechas de ser hijo/a de algún desaparecido, quien realmente resuelve el tema es está organización, a la que cualquiera puede acudir y que además lo hace de forma gratuita. No necesitas añadir una capa de burocracia adicional en forma de otra organización.\nhttps://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banco_Nacional_de_Datos_Genéticos\n[#4](c4#c-4) Te voy a poner un ejemplo: España\nAquí hemos tenido 50 años (y contando) y todavía hay un montón de barbaridades que se hicieron en la dictadura de Franco que siguen sin saberse.\nY eso es así porque todavía hay gente viva y con poder, interesada en que no se sepa.\nY en Argentina, igual. Y esa gente con poder ha votado a Milei para que parara esas investigaciones, no sea que se descubra que algún heredero de una familia de bien resulta que tiene genes de rojo piojoso.\n[#30](c30#c-30) Precisamente. Este es de los que dice que no hay que reabrir heridas del pasado obviando que los delitos de lesa humanidad no prescriben\n[#50](c50#c-50) Viniendo del tío que llama fascistas a los que piden acabar con los difusores de fake news racistas, en realidad tu opinión respecto a esto se podía intuir. Has confirmado lo que pareces esmerarte en demostrar cada día; das asco. No eres más que otro ultra conservador sin escrúpulos, como tu máximo héroe, el sociópata Milei.",

    "text": "This week’s\nsevere storms have left behind heartache and debris, along with the flooding.\nAccording to the National Weather Service, the areas that received the most rainfall were north of Interstate 40 — with many spots getting five to eight inches. This led to water rescues in places like Gallatin and Hendersonville. Overall, Sumner and Robertson counties were hit the hardest, with 10 to 11 inches.\nIn some areas, the storms were downright historic: Clarksville got the most rain it’s seen since the May 2010 flood, and Crossville, to the east, set a one-day record for rainfall.\nKrissy Hurley, the meteorologist-in-charge in Nashville, said that the region’s water table is now very saturated. That means it will be important to keep an eye out for future storms this spring and summer that could cause additional flooding.\n“We’re coming out of a pretty significant drought that occurred in the fall and into early winter. That help things from becoming more widespread around the area as far as flooding is concerned,” she explained. “But now that we’ve hit that trigger point, this is something that we’re going to have to watch as we go into a warmer, wetter type of pattern.”\nHurley urged Tennesseans to take the threats posed by flooding seriously.\n“A lot of times when we have these types of severe weather events, the flooding aspect tends to get ignored,” she said, pointing out that flooding has killed 43 people in the state in the last decade.\n“It’s not something to ignore,” she said. “If you see high water, turn around. Don’t drown. Move to higher ground.”\nShe added that people should avoid driving on flooded roads, which could have hidden hazards underneath the water. In Cannon County, there is a boil warning because the Woodbury water treatment facility was contaminated by flooding.\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is monitoring the Cumberland River, and expects that flooding will peak at different points along the waterway Thursday and Friday. The Army Corps announced that its locks and dams along the river basin are performing as designed and are not at risk of failure.\n“We are managing a large amount of water through our projects designed to mitigate flooding, and we strongly discourage the public from recreating in these areas at this time,” said Nashville District commander Lt. Col. Robert Green.\nThe Army Corps predicts that the Cumberland will just barely reach a flood stage in Nashville at its peak early Friday morning, with more significant flooding in Clarksville around midday Friday.",

    "text": "The U.S. saw a big drop in shootings in 2023 ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: When it comes to crime, cities across the country experienced big drops in shootings in 2023. Some of the largest decreases occurred in cities that have become almost synonymous with gun crime, like Chicago, Detroit and Philadelphia. The reduction in Chicago came in areas considered the most violent, with the number of murders and shootings dropping lower than before the pandemic. Patrick Smith of member station WBEZ reports. (SOUNDBITE OF KEYS JINGLING) PATRICK SMITH, BYLINE: Tony Raggs is just getting ready to shut down his boxing gym for the night. Most of the kids who had been here earlier, working out and goofing around, are gone. Raggs and his brother opened the gym up in the basement of a church building a few years ago, the latest tactic to try and teach conflict resolution that doesn't involve guns. TONY RAGGS: I had two guys come in last week - got into a fistfight on the street. Both guys were 17 years old. It could have easily escalated. You know, there's always somebody on the sideline, edging somebody on, so - brought them down, had a conversation with them, and they made up right there. P SMITH: Raggs has been trying to reduce gun violence on Chicago's West Side for years. And in the summer of 2020, Chicago, just like much of the rest of the country, saw the number of shootings and murders in some of its most troubled neighborhoods explode. At the height of the pandemic and in the immediate aftermath of the George Floyd uprisings, murders in Chicago went up more than 50% in one year. Raggs says it was a bad time in his neighborhood of West Humboldt Park. RAGGS: We was actually up against the pandemic and the epidemic of violence. P SMITH: But now, for the second year in a row, shootings and murders are down in Chicago. West Humboldt Park is leading the city in the year-over-year drop. Chicago, overall, is still more violent now than it was in 2019, but some of the neighborhoods with the highest levels of gun violence are safer today than they were before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic according to Kim Smith. She's the director of programs for the University of Chicago Crime Lab. KIM SMITH: You might expect that the community areas where gun violence increased the most might also be the places where the benefits of reduction have been most disproportionately felt, and that is what we're seeing. P SMITH: University of Pennsylvania criminologist Aaron Chalfin says Chicago is part of a national drop in violence. AARON CHALFIN: Homicides are down, you know, pretty convincingly. Like, 2023 has been a great year. Other crimes are not down. Other crimes - at least in many cities, cities that I've seen data for - are up. P SMITH: For instance, Chicago has seen its sharpest spike in robberies in at least 20 years. That robbery trend is unique to Chicago, but motor vehicle theft has soared in many other cities. CHALFIN: That's a puzzle. Usually, all crimes kind of move in the same direction. P SMITH: Chalfin says it's all the more reason not to draw any conclusions from the year-over-year changes, and it's a sign that no one should be taking a victory lap just yet. On Chicago's West Side, they aren't declaring victory, but the front-line anti-violence workers believe they are building something that's going to last. Tavares Harrington works in the city's Austin neighborhood. Harrington says they've been able to negotiate a number of nonaggression agreements between different warring street groups. TAVARES HARRINGTON: These guys are not, you know, trying to be aggressive with each other. They're not sliding or trying to intimidate each other in no type of way. And if we do hear of someone maybe riding through that area and making them feel intimidated, then we'll give a call or get that in place and straighten that out. P SMITH: It's that persistence and deep connection with the guys closest to the violence that Harrington hopes will keep murders and other violent crimes On the decline in 2024. For NPR News, I'm Patrick Smith in Chicago. SHAPIRO: And that story was reported with Andy Boyle and Andy Grimm of the Chicago Sun-Times.

    "text": "Bitcoin News Today: Bitcoin ETFs See $47.39M Inflow on July 30 Extending Five-Day Streak\nBitcoin spot ETFs have recorded a net inflow of $47.39 million on July 30, continuing a five-day streak of positive capital inflows and reinforcing the asset’s growing appeal among investors [1]. This development is seen as a key indicator of maturing investor confidence in crypto-related financial products, particularly as institutional and retail investors increasingly opt for regulated investment vehicles to gain Bitcoin exposure.\nBlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) led the inflow on July 30, with $34.73 million in net inflows, while Bitwise’s BITB added $12.66 million [1]. These figures highlight the dominance of well-established ETF providers in capturing investor demand, as trust in major financial institutions remains a critical factor in adoption. Meanwhile, other Bitcoin spot ETFs showed no significant movement in holdings, underscoring the concentration of inflows among top-tier products.\nThe five-day inflow trend reflects a broader shift in market sentiment, signaling a move beyond short-term speculation toward long-term recognition of Bitcoin’s role in diversified portfolios [1]. This shift has been bolstered by the regulatory approval of these ETFs earlier this year, which has introduced a level of legitimacy and transparency previously absent in the crypto market. The sustained inflows suggest that investors are viewing Bitcoin through a more institutional lens, with the ETF structure offering a regulated and accessible gateway to the digital asset.\nInvestors are drawn to spot Bitcoin ETFs for several reasons, including regulatory oversight, ease of trading through traditional brokerage platforms, and enhanced liquidity [1]. These benefits contrast with the challenges of direct Bitcoin ownership, such as wallet management and security concerns. However, investors must remain cautious of potential risks, including management fees, market volatility, and indirect custody arrangements. As the regulatory environment continues to evolve, these factors will remain central to investment decisions.\nThe ongoing inflows into Bitcoin spot ETFs reflect an expanding convergence between traditional finance and the digital asset space. With major financial institutions at the forefront, these products are not only offering a regulated means to access Bitcoin but also contributing to greater market liquidity and price discovery [1]. The continued inflow of capital into these funds highlights a growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a mainstream investment vehicle, with the potential to influence broader financial markets in the coming months.\nSource: [1] Bitcoin ETF: Unlocking the Astonishing Five-Day Inflow Streak (https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/688ae0b2a46b022297b51d0f/)\nComments\nNo comments yet",
