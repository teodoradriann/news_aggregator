    "text": "La apertura del nuevo Hospital Oncohematológico del Hospital Universitario Virgen de la Victoria de Málaga sigue sin saberse. No tiene fecha, pese a que las obras ya están terminadas y estaba prevista su apertura para aquel entonces.\nLos trabajadores del centro hospitalario no comprenden por qué no ha entrado en funcionamiento ya , según aseguraron en la concentración del pasado lunes a las puertas de este centro hospitalario.\n“Lo tenemos terminado, entregada la obra desde enero y a día de hoy continúa cerrado y esto repercute en los pacientes oncológicos ”, señaló Juan Antonio Martos, presidente de la Junta del Personal del Clínico.\nSanitarios del Clínico de Málaga denuncian el \"colapso\" del hospital: \"Hay pacientes que esperan 70 horas por una cama\" “En los pasillos totalmente hacinados, montados unos a otros prácticamente, con sus mascarillas ”. Así se encuentran los pacientes oncológicos cada vez que acuden a consultas o sus tratamientos en el hospital, según el profesional.\nAdemás, remarcaron que los pacientes cuando entran a que se les administre la quimio, “están codo con codo” . Por lo que ven a las personas que tienen al lado y “uno se pone malo porque uno tiene vómitos, el otro sus problemas psicológicos”.\nSegún los trabajadores esta es una situación que se repite a diario y la califican como “totalmente lamentable e indigna” . Al mismo tiempo, sostiene que les parece “totalmente inviable” el hecho de tener a los pacientes “hacinados” teniendo unas instalaciones por estrenar.\nMientras tanto fuentes sanitarias consultadas por este periódico sostienen que aún no hay una fecha prevista para la apertura.\nSanitarios del Clínico de Málaga se concentrarán el próximo lunes: “Nos enfrentamos a un colapso absoluto” Cabe recordar que el pasado mes de octubre el director gerente del Hospital Clínico, Jesús Fernández Galán, aseguró que el nuevo Hospital de Día Oncohematológico iba a abrir sus puertas para el mes de diciembre o para principios de 2025.\nEstas instalaciones suponen un incremento de 2.000 metros cuadrados a las que ya tiene disponibles el Hospital Clínico de Málaga. Además, triplicará, una vez que se ponga en funcionamiento, la capacidad asistencial y la calidad en la atención a este tipo de pacientes y sus familias.\nLa construcción del nuevo hospital de día supone un aumento de los actuales 15 sillones a 31, y de siete consultas de Oncología a 16. También permite pasar de tres consultas para Hematología a un total de ocho; así como 12 camas, y cuatro camas más para las necesidades de aislamiento de los pacientes que así lo precisen.",

    "text": "ORLANDO, Fla. - Soarin&apos; is a Disney ride that sends guests on a flying journey around some of the world&apos;s best-known landmarks. Visitors experience the sights, sounds, and even smells of the voyage as they go. \"You load on the bottom level, everybody loads across and all of a sudden you&apos;re lifted up into the sky and put in front of a curved screen, and it puts you in that screen and up, down, left, right, all you see is what&apos;s projecting towards you, which is usually flying across the sky,\" said Matt Roseboom, editor of Attractions Magazine. The next time Disney, or another theme park, builds something like Soarin&apos;, this patent from Nashville-based Medici XD may be critical for giving visitors a realistic experience. The technology describes a multi-row seating apparatus, like the one Soarin&apos; uses, but takes it to a new, more extreme level. \"This looks very similar to Soarin&apos; but it has the ability to rock back-and-forth, pitch different directions, so there&apos;s a lot more motion involved in this new system,\" said Annie Wilson, with Universal Parks News Today. Theme park experts say - as with most patents - it may take years, if ever, for these new patents to be put into use at Orlando theme parks. Theme park expert Jason Diffendal from WDWNT.com said it would open up a Soarin&apos;-type ride to more adventurous possibilities. \"Disney is always researching new ideas in all kinds of things, including ride technology. This is sort of the next evolution in a Soarin&apos; ride system. Whether they&apos;re gonna implement this at Soarin,&apos; I don&apos;t think so, because Soarin&apos; is popular enough as it is.\"",

    "text": "William Lai Ching-te, the current vice president of Taiwan, was elected the island’s next president in a closely watched election on Jan. 13, giving his Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) another four years in office and affirming its diplomatic stance in the face of persistent threats from Communist China. Lai, a miner’s son who was trained as a doctor, ran on a platform of continuing the policies of sitting president Tsai Ing-wen, who sought to distance Taiwan from Beijing and strengthen international trade and partnerships to decrease Taiwan’s economic dependency on mainland China, while boosting its diplomatic position. “Between democracy and authoritarianism we will stand on the side of democracy, the Republic of China, Taiwan will continue to walk side by side with democracies from around the world,” Lai said in his victory speech, using Taiwan’s official name. [Under Beijing’s Shadow, Taiwan Heads to the Polls to Elect a New President and Parliament](https://www.visiontimes.com/2024/01/10/under-beijings-shadow-taiwan-heads-to-the-polls-to-elect-a-new-president-and-parliament.html) [Lai Ching-te Elected President of Taiwan](https://www.visiontimes.com/2024/01/13/lai-ching-te-elected-taiwan-president.html) The DPP garnered over 5.5 million votes, or 40 percent of the total, beating out the opposition Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang) by nearly 7 percent. Around 4.5 million ballots went to the Kuomintang’s Hou Yu-ih, while 25 percent of voters picked a third candidate, Ko Wen-je of the newly formed Taiwan People’s Party (TPP). Lai and his running mate, Hsiao Bi-khim, will take office on May 20, replacing Tsai Ing-wen, who has already served two terms, the most she is constitutionally allowed. Staying vigilant Success You are now signed up for our newsletter Success Check your email to complete sign up The election results demonstrate the continuing wariness of the Taiwanese populace towards the communist Chinese regime, which has in recent years stepped up its aerial and naval harassment of Taiwan and tried to use economic coercion and other means to influence Taiwanese politics. Taiwan occupies an awkward international position, with its government and then-dictatorial Kuomintang party having retreated from mainland China in 1949 after losing a lengthy civil war with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Adding insult to injury, in 1971 the ROC lost its right to represent China in the United Nations, which turned over the seat to the communist People’s Republic of China (PRC). Beijing uses the U.N. decision to claim that Taiwan is part of its sovereign territory, despite having never governed the island that lies about 100 miles from the southeastern Chinese coast. [Beijing Deploys Spy Balloons Over Taiwan, Escalating Tensions Ahead of Key Elections](https://www.visiontimes.com/2024/01/05/china-deploys-spy-balloons-over-taiwan-escalating-tensions-ahead-of-key-elections.html) [Nauru Ditches Taiwan in Favor of Communist China Just Days After Taipei Elects New President](https://www.visiontimes.com/2024/01/15/nauru-ditches-taiwan-in-favor-of-china-just-days-after-taipei-elects-new-president.html) The DPP, which champions a separate national identity and statehood for Taiwan, won landslide electoral victories in 2016 and 2020, especially in the later election which came as the CCP prepared to crush civil freedoms in the former British colony of Hong Kong. In June 2020, months after the election that saw Tsai Ing-wen win her second term with 57 percent of the vote, the CCP imposed a draconian “national security law” on Hong Kong, banning virtually all expression deemed critical of the communist regime. Tsai, Lai, and his running mate, vice president-elect Hsiao Bi-khim, have somewhat rolled back the DPP’s demand for formal independence, declaring that Taiwan, as the ROC, is already an independent country. Despite this, and though it only has informal relations with most of the world’s countries, Taiwan has been able to significantly boost its international profile over the last decade, while the U.S., Japan, and other allies have increasingly highlighted the need to help Taiwan defend itself in case of CCP aggression. Meanwhile, the Kuomintang apparently failed to shake its reputation as a pro-Beijing force. Starting in the 1990s, the party’s leaders developed a pro-business approach that saw the prioritization of friendly relations with the Chinese mainland. Fatal error In a shift from previous years, both the DPP and the Kuomintang candidates called to strengthen Taiwan’s military defenses, and to engage with mainland China with caution. In the past, Kuomintang figures dismissed the importance of military preparedness, and even criticized it as a move that could needlessly provoke the CCP. Further, 2024’s Kuomintang candidate, Hou Yu-ih, dropped the party’s longstanding commitment to unification, saying that this had to be decided by the people of Taiwan, who increasingly identify themselves as Taiwanese only, rather than Chinese. Hou also criticized the “one country, two systems,” framework by which Hong Kong was guaranteed, then stripped of, its special political rights. In addition, the Kuomintang has voiced support for Jimmy Lai, the Hong Kong businessman and independent media mogul who has been imprisoned in solitary confinement under the CCP’s National Security Law. However, the core of Hou’s policy on cross-strait relations hinged on recognition of the so-called “1992 Consensus,” which the Kuomintang interprets as the ROC recognizing the existence of the PRC and vice versa. For Beijing, though, the Consensus instead means that the Kuomintang has acquiesced to the CCP’s claim to all of China, including Taiwan. Clinging to this consensus may have made the Kuomintang more amenable to the CCP, but it likely lost the Kuomintang what actually mattered — the votes of the Taiwanese people. According to Sung Cheng-en, a Taiwanese legal scholar and professor at the National Taiwan University, the Kuomintang’s hopes for productive cross-strait dialogue are “completely empty.” “It’s just wishful thinking, but whether or not [dialogue] can actually be achieved, whether the CCP can actually be engaged with, and if the results of this engagement are actually acceptable, how Taiwan’s other international partners will see it, it’s all empty,” he said [in a program](https://youtu.be/BjfNIkjnBhI?si=-XOPFf7bk4Z-OcQp) by NTD Television on Jan. 13. And ironically, while the CCP has lashed out against the “separatist” DPP and tried to influence the election against Lai Ching-te, its actions have had the opposite effect. “The more pressure the CCP puts on Taiwan, and as the Kuomintang expresses a warmer attitude towards Communist China, the number of votes it receives shrinks,” said Ming Chu-cheng, professor emeritus of NTU’s political science department, on the same television program. Adding fuel to the fire, former ROC President Ma Ying-jeou, a Kuomintang figure who championed close ties with Beijing, made controversial statements on the eve of the election, telling Deutsche Welle that the people of Taiwan ought to trust CCP leader Xi Jinping when it came to maintaining peace across the Taiwan Strait. Ma was disinvited to a Kuomintang campaign event the day before the election, many felt the damage was done. Tai Ming-yi, a Taiwanese living in New York for 50 years who applied for and received her ROC citizenship to participate in this year’s election, told The Epoch Times that Ma’s call to “trust Xi Jinping” drove many would-be Kuomintang supporters to the DPP. “Among my old classmates, there are some who changed their vote simply because of what Ma Ying-jeou said. After they cast their ballots, they told me that they voted for Lai Ching-te.” In a separate interview with The Epoch Times, sister media to NTD Television, Ming said that no matter what their party affiliations, politicians in Taiwan had to work together as rivals within a democratic system, not see each other as enemies, lest they become unwitting tools of the CCP. “If the [Communist Party] can ensure that the DPP and Kuomintang camps continue their infighting, they can forever keep [the Taiwanese] from seeing the communists’ deeper conspiracy and stratagem.” Opposing communism: the only chance for a comeback Prof. Ming noted on the Jan. 13 NTD Television program that contrary to popular perceptions, a voter’s family background did not play a decisive role in determining which candidate they would choose. In analyzing the breakdown of Taiwan’s voters and their family backgrounds, Ming observed that many “benshengren,” that is, Taiwanese whose forefathers had left China hundreds of years ago up to 1949, nevertheless voted for the Kuomintang, which is more strongly associated with “waishengren,” or those who emigrated with the ROC government in 1949 from the mainland as it fell to the communists. Likewise, many “waishengren” voted for the DPP or the TPP, Ming said. Victor Cao, a resident of New York originally from China who identifies with the ROC, praised Taiwan’s democratic process and said that if the Kuomintang wants to win in the next elections, it must completely drop its pro-Beijing posturing. He pointed to the Kuomintang’s gains in the Legislative Yuan, Taiwan’s 113-seat parliament, as showing that there was still popular support for the party. “I want to advise the Kuomintang. If you want to win in 2028, don’t criticize the DPP anymore. You should criticize the CCP. You should criticize the CCP’s so-called ‘1992 Consensus,’ which is the [communist] One China principle.” He added in his comments to The Epoch Times that not only was there support for the Kuomintang in Taiwan, but also many mainland Chinese support the ROC, rather than the CCP, which in its war against the Kuomintang killed countless Nationalist officials, including those who had served China in the resistance against Japan in World War II. “If the Kuomintang truly cares about the Republic of China, instead of criticizing the DPP, it should criticize the CCP — the greater its criticism, the more votes it will get, and the more international support it will gain,” he said.",

    "title": "El Ártico, testigo de un nuevo año del cambio climático | El Nuevo Siglo",
    "text": "[Jueves, 28 de Diciembre de 2023] Con pérdida de hielo y temperaturas cada vez más cálidas en el aire, la región ártica atestiguó de nuevo este año el cambio climático que experimenta la Tierra, destacó un reporte de la Organización Meteorológica Mundial (OMM). Las temperaturas del Ártico han aumentado al menos dos veces más rápido que las temperaturas globales desde el año 2000, con afectaciones sobre las personas, comunidades y ecosistemas de toda la región, indicó la OMM citando estudios de la Administración Nacional Oceánica y Atmosférica (Noaa) de Estados Unidos. El informe anual “Arctic Report Card” de la Noaa indicó que durante el verano boreal las temperaturas del aire en la superficie fueron las más cálidas jamás observadas e hicieron de 2023 el sexto año más cálido registrado en el Ártico. Esa “amplificación del Ártico” es un fenómeno ampliamente reconocido, en el cual el calentamiento global causado por el hombre se amplifica en los polos, lo que hace que la región se caliente más rápidamente que el resto del mundo, derritiendo grandes masas de hielo y nieve, explica la OMM. Las 17 extensiones de hielo marino del Ártico más bajas registradas ocurrieron, precisamente, durante los últimos 17 años. El calor inusual en Groenlandia contribuyó a que el área acumulada de días de deshielo se acercara al récord histórico en la capa de hielo de esa isla danesa de 2,1 millones de kilómetros cuadrados entre los océanos Ártico y Atlántico. El punto más alto de la capa de hielo de Groenlandia se derritió por quinta vez en 34 años de registros anuales. El calor inusual en el norte de Canadá coincidió con precipitaciones inferiores a lo normal, lo que contribuyó a la temporada extrema de incendios forestales en la región y llevó grandes cantidades de humo hacia Estados Unidos. Los mares poco profundos alrededor del océano Ártico se han calentado dramáticamente en las últimas cuatro décadas, según los informes. Y muchas regiones del océano Ártico continúan mostrando una mayor proliferación de fitoplancton oceánico. En promedio, esas áreas se han calentado alrededor de dos grados centígrados durante la era de los satélites, parte de un ciclo de retroalimentación en el que el calentamiento de las temperaturas del aire y del agua reduce la capa de hielo marino. Eso expone una mayor parte del océano a la luz solar directa, lo cual provoca un mayor calentamiento. La temperatura media de la superficie del mar en regiones entre 65 y 80 grados de latitud norte está aumentando a un ritmo de 0,5 grados centígrados por década. Lugares que alguna vez estuvieron cubiertos de nieve durante casi todo el año se están descongelando a principios de la primavera. El invierno de 2022-23 trajo acumulaciones de nieve superiores a la media en el Ártico, pero desapareció en la primavera mucho más rápido que antes. El calentamiento ha tenido impactos divergentes en distintos recorridos del salmón de Alaska: algunos con abundancia récord y otros una baja récord. El salmón está madurando en tamaños más pequeños. Desde la década de 1970, el salmón chinook del río Yukón ha disminuido aproximadamente seis por ciento en la longitud media del cuerpo adulto y 15 % en su fecundidad, lo que probablemente exacerbe la disminución de la población. La disminución de la población de salmón ha provocado cierres de pesquerías, empeorado los conflictos entre usuarios e impactado en la cultura y seguridad alimentaria en las comunidades indígenas vinculadas a ese rubro durante milenios. En el aire, la temperatura promedio en la superficie del Ártico el año pasado fue la sexta más cálida desde 1900. Aunque la tundra ártica (región biogeográfica polar cuya vegetación es de bajo crecimiento) es en su mayor parte demasiado fría y seca para los árboles, es hogar de otras plantas que evolucionaron para sobrevivir a los inviernos gélidos. Ubicada entre los bosques boreales y el océano, esta área de arbustos, musgos, líquenes, pastos y plantas parecidas a las hierbas llamadas juncos crecen en la capa relativamente delgada de suelo que se descongela brevemente en el verano ártico. Pero a medida que el Ártico se ha calentado en las últimas décadas, los satélites han documentado un importante “enverdecimiento” de la tundra. Rick Spinrad, administrador de la Noaa, dijo que “el mensaje principal del informe es que ahora es el momento de actuar. Debemos reducir drásticamente las emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero (que calientan la atmósfera) que están impulsando estos cambios”./",

    "text": "从校园卡推销员到月销百万的电商新锐，从一款爆款笔记嗅到商机到一点点做大品牌，从8平米宿舍到千平产业园总部……在山东工商学院校园里，国际经济与贸易专业00后学生李君晨与数学学院大数据专业学生崔邵帅，用三年时间创造了震撼人心的“小成本创业奇迹”。他们创立的DIY手工材料包品牌年度营业额突破1000万元，成为大学生创业赛道上一匹耀眼的黑马。\n淬炼于微时，兼职少年从初中起便开始磨砺商业锋芒\n李君晨的商业基因并非凭空而来。早在中学时期，为减轻家庭负担，他摆地摊、送外卖，高中时更在游乐园带领20人团队，日均管理上万客流。这些看似“小打小闹”的经历，为他锻造了超越年龄的敏锐市场嗅觉与卓越团队协作能力。无独有偶，崔邵帅同样从初中起便对各界创业大佬的传奇事迹非常感兴趣，内心也悄然种下创业梦想的种子，利用各种各样的机会磨砺自己，卖手机卡、摆摊、做自媒体……多番尝试后积累了丰富的经验。\n两人同时进入学校创业先锋班学习后相识，各有优长到两人很快便相互赏识，大二那年，崔邵帅从一款爆款手工制作笔记中嗅到商机，很快他便付诸实践，也向他眼中“完美搭档”李君晨发出邀请，就这样两人在DIY赛道中携手出发。“2021年，我们俩考入山东工商学院，浓厚的双创氛围点燃了心中的创业激情，我们也开启了‘疯狂试错’模式：大一做过校园卡代理、驾校推广、干过洗店运营，大二进入创业先锋班，在导师指导下率队操盘小说推文项目，首次实现单月盈利过万。”李君晨说，丰富的单打独斗经验告诉我们，资源整合才是破局密钥，“我们想要一起在市场空白中拼出一条长期赛道，DIY便进入了我们的视野。”\n一天接的订单通宵干了半个月，DIY赛道跃出电商黑马\n一款沉浸式手工制作礼物笔记本的视频笔记，出人意料到火爆，让脑子里一直想怎么挣钱的李君晨和崔邵帅十分好奇。“当时我看那个视频下边的评论都是‘怎么买材料，自己也想做一个去哪里买工具’等留言，于是我开始到处去调研，发现DIY手工制作材料包这一块处于市场空白，很有市场。”崔邵帅说，自己随后便寻找各个零件、工具的渠道，找到后也开始制作，并将视频发到网上，很快视频就开始火了，“这方面需求很大，现在不少人送朋友、情人礼物都喜欢亲手制作，这样的礼物也给足了情绪价值，这也就透露出了巨大商机。”\n敏锐捕捉手工礼物市场蓝海后，两人创立了DIY手工材料包项目。凭借“供应链直采降成本＋短视频精准引流种草＋社群裂变强转化”的创新三板斧，项目也很快在首月突破了50万元到销售额。“我们独创的‘傻瓜式材料包＋沉浸式教程’模式，让零基础用户20分钟华丽变身手作达人，迅速引爆电商平台，单款材料包销量超5万件。”李君晨回忆起创业初期，两人常常在大学创新实验室、宿舍工作，老师同学经常能在路上碰见两人搬着原料箱子来回折腾，“还记得第一年寒假里，我们拍的一个视频火了，导致一天就接单100多单，随后每一天都在陆续增加订单，而每一单都需要联络对接几十个工厂、组装小配件、包装发货，我俩通宵忙了快半个月才忙完。那时候很拼，有时候一下午我能出11条视频，创业激情汹涌澎湃。”\n从大学宿舍到千平产业园，“小动作”创千万营收\n昔日2人宿舍草台班子，如今已壮大为15名员工的注册公司。公司场地也从8平米逼仄空间，跃迁至1000平米现代化产业园，如今供应链网络高效覆盖浙江义乌、广东东莞等6大核心产业带，产品种类多大100多种。面对千万营收的耀眼成绩，23岁的李君晨却展现出超乎年龄的清醒：“所谓‘逆袭’，不过是把别人眼里的‘小生意’扎扎实实做到了极致。”\n在母校创业分享会上，李君晨以亲身实践提炼出朴素而深刻的“小动作哲学”：“如果总想着颠覆行业，可能连第一步都迈不出。”当无数人追逐宏大叙事与颠覆性创新时，李君晨和崔邵帅用三年千万营收的答卷证明，于细微处深耕，将简单事做到极致，平凡人也能在时代浪潮中刻下非凡印记。这两位00后领跑者的故事，为所有心怀梦想者点亮了一盏务实前行的灯。（山东工商学院薛文成）",

    "text": "El obispo de Torreón, Luis Martín Barraza Beltrán acudió este domingo a emitir su sufragio a la casilla 1217 ubicada en el Colegio Jesús María Echavarría de la colonia Nueva Los Ángeles de Torreón. Monseñor llegó en punto de las 9 de la mañana y dijo que la iglesia católica ha estado invitando a los creyentes a que salgan a votar además de que ha habido una gran insistencia a orar y conocer las plataformas de cada uno de los candidatos. “Y bueno, pues en coherencia con ese mensaje, pues a participar. El mensaje principal es que es una consecuencia del ser creyentes, del mandamiento principal, la participación, es un acto de dignidad, no hay más dignidad, si queremos ser muy dignos, pues servir, pensar en los hermanos y un acto de caridad muy grande es el emitir el voto, es un acto de ciudadano. Un creyente tiene que ser un ejemple ciudadano, es un acto de patriotismo, un acto de caridad. No se falten así mismos con el abstencionismo”,expresó. Barraza Beltrán agregó que espera que en Coahuila haya una jornada tranquila pues en otras entidades federativas se ha escuchado violencia y que hay intromisión de “gente ajena” a los procesos democráticos. A la jovenes, el obispo les dijo que “estamos en las elecciones pensando en el futuro, en el país que ellos van a votar, que ellos van a liderar, van a disfrutar, entonces pues que ya vayan participando, que no se pierda la oportunidad de ser protagonistas desde ahora, eligiendo pues el proyecto de país hacia adelante, en el que ellos van a vivir”, concluyó.",
