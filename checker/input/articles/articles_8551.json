    "title": "Cómo hacer un puff para tu hogar con sólo unos baldes de pintura reciclados",
    "text": "Poder decorar el hogar de la manera más económica posible no es solo conveniente para el bolsillo de quienes lo realizan, sino que además pone a prueba la creatividad y el ingenio. Un ejemplo es convertir un viejo balde de pintura en un glamuroso puff para cualquier espacio de tu casa. Este proyecto es perfecto para quienes desean ahorrar dinero, evitar compras costosas y aportar un toque único y personalizado a su hogar.\nMateriales necesarios\nEste reciclaje requiere materiales accesibles y un poco de imaginación. Para realizarlo vas a necesitar: un balde de pintura vacío y limpio, pintura en aerosol de color blanco, una pistola de silicona, tela dorada, goma espuma, hilo grueso y aguja, una piedra decorativa, tijeras, tiras de piedras, patas para la base y una abrochadora.\nEl paso a paso para reciclar los baldes de pintura\n- El primer paso es cubrir el balde con pintura en aerosol blanca para eliminar cualquier marca o logo visible. Esto garantizará una base uniforme y prolija.\n- Luego tomá la tela de purpurina dorada y forrá toda la superficie visible del balde. Usá tijeras para recortar los sobrantes y asegurate de cubrir también la base inferior con un círculo de tela a medida.\n- Después seguí con la decoración utilizando tiras de piedras o cristales. Colocá una tira en la parte inferior del balde, otra bajo el borde superior de la tapa y distribuí las restantes alrededor del borde.\n- Estas decoraciones añaden un toque sofisticado que eleva el diseño final. Utilizá una agujereadora para realizar un orificio en el centro del balde; este será fundamental para fijar el almohadón.\n- El almohadón se hace forrando un trozo de goma espuma con la misma tela dorada. Pasá hilo grueso a través de la goma espuma y fijá una piedra decorativa en el centro para darle un aspecto elegante.\n- Repetí este proceso en el lado interno del almohadón, añadí un círculo de tela para cubrir la parte inferior, que deberás fijar con una abrochadora para darle estabilidad.\n- Terminá el proyecto colocando patas decorativas en la base del balde. Ajustalas firmemente con tornillos para que el puff tenga un soporte estable y resistente. Este último paso no solo mejora la funcionalidad del mueble, sino que también le aporta un acabado refinado.\nEn pocos pasos y con materiales sencillos, podés transformar un simple balde en un puff glamuroso para tu hogar.",

    "title": "Cher files for conservatorship of son Elijah Blue Allman",
    "text": "Cher has filed for temporary legal conservatorship of her adult son Elijah Blue Allman, citing his alleged ongoing substance abuse issues.\nAccording to a petition filed this week in Los Angeles Superior Court and obtained by CNN, Cher is seeking to be the sole conservator of her son’s estate, alleging that he “is currently unable to manage his assets due to severe mental health and substance abuse issues.”\n“Elijah is entitled to regular distributions from the Trust, but given his ongoing mental health and substance abuse issues,” according to the documents. “Petitioner (Cher) is concerned that any funds distributed to Elijah will be immediately spent on drugs, leaving Elijah with no assets to provide for himself and putting Elijah’s life at risk.”\nThe 47-year-old is the son of Cher and her former husband, the late rocker Gregg Allman.\nPeople are also reading…\nGregg Allman and Cher were married from 1975 to 1979. He\ndied in 2017 at the age of 69 due to liver cancer complications.\nThe petition filed by Cher states that her son is set to receive funds from a trust by the end of the year. It also states that the 77-year-old singer and actress has “worked tirelessly to get Elijah into treatment and get him the help he needs.”\n“Petitioner (Cher) loves Elijah immensely and has always acted with his best interests in mind,” the filing states.\n“I’m not suffering from any problem that millions of people in the United States aren’t,”\nCher told People magazine in October, referring to her son’s substance abuse.\n“I’m a mother. This is my job — one way or another, to try to help my children,” she said. “You do anything for your children. Whenever you can help them, you just do it because that’s what being a mother is. But it’s joy, even with heartache — mostly, when you think of your children, you just smile and you love them, and you try to be there for them.”\nCher is also the mother of Chaz Bono.\nA hearing has been scheduled in March, according to court documents. CNN is working to determine if Allman has legal representation.\nCNN has reached out to representatives for Cher for further comment.",

Notably, the ICJS platform facilitates the seamless transfer of data and information among various pillars of the criminal justice system nationwide. In these, data related to crimes and criminals is exchanged between courts, police, jails, and forensic science laboratories through a single window system. ADG Prosecution Deepesh Juneja said that the Directorate of Prosecution Uttar Pradesh has recorded 1,56,22,514 entries on the ICJS platform so far. Madhya Pradesh is in second place with 35,04,828 entries, and Bihar is in third place with 16,65,107 entries. Through ICJS, records such as FIR, case numbers, jail ID, and records from filing FIRs against suspects to imprisonment of culprits are maintained. Additionally, details of court cases, trials, judgments, prosecution, and forensic information can be accessed by courts, police, jails, and forensic science laboratories through a single platform. Information related to criminal justice related to the investigation, search, case history, case pendency, current status of the criminal, etc. required from time to time is also available on ICJS. The police department gets help in data analytics for the prediction of crimes based on this information and effective management of crime control in the future. In addition to this, photographs, videos, documentary evidence as well as court case data, and video recordings of court proceedings related to crimes and criminals are also preserved on ICJS. Furthermore, it facilitates the enablement of judicial proceedings through video conferencing.",

    "title": "Did Donald Trump Jr just break the law during his meeting with Hungarian leader Viktor Orban?",
    "text": "By Katie Hawkinson ,\n37 minutes ago Donald Trump Jr, four months after being hit with a $4 million fine and a ban on serving as an officer of a New York company for two years , is seeking opportunities elsewhere — namely, Hungary .\nThe former president’s eldest child arrived in Budapest on Thursday morning on an invitation from the Budapest Chamber of Commerce and Industry. There, he met with Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and gave a talk entitled “The World According to Donald Trump Jr .,” an event first reported by Hungarian journalist Szabolcs Panyi .\nTrump Jr’s visit focused on discussions about “the future of Hungarian-American relations, the ongoing Russian-Ukrainian war, and opportunities for peace creation,” according to Zoltan Kovacs , spokesperson for Orbán’s office.\nMultiple legal experts say foreign policy discussions between Trump Jr — who is not employed by the US government — and a foreign prime minister raise questions about the Logan Act, which prohibits unauthorized diplomatic activity in certain circumstances.\nExperts also tell The Independent the Hungarian government’s increasingly authoritarian tilt may serve as a model for Trump’s potential second presidency , should he win the election this November — and that Americans should pay attention as his eldest son speaks not only to Orbán but a prominent conservative college with ties to Orbán’s Fidesz party.\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to multiple requests for comment from The Independent .\nThe Logan Act Trump Jr — who met with Orbán to discuss immigration, Russia’s war in Ukraine, and US-Hungarian relations — followed in his father’s footsteps. The former president met with Orbán in March.\nBut Kim Scheppele, Professor of Sociology and International Affairs at Princeton University and Faculty Fellow at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, says this raises legal questions about Trump Jr’s role.\n“There is an interesting US legal question about whether private citizens can attempt to influence US foreign policy by negotiating with foreign countries,” Scheppele told The Independent . “The Logan Act makes this illegal.”\nSpecifically, Trump Jr, who does not hold any government office, spoke with Orbán regarding US foreign policy as it relates to Ukraine.\nYet, the Logan Act states that any US citizen “without authority of the United States, directly or indirectly,” is not legally permitted to conduct “any correspondence or intercourse with any foreign government or any officer or agent thereof, with intent to influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government” when it comes to conflict situations.\nDonald Baker, former assistant attorney general at the US Department of Justice, told The Independent it is unlikely the Department would ever pursue action against anyone using the Logan Act, given no one has been convicted of violating the 1799 law: “ Any action by the Justice Department would be unwise because it would be jumped all over as being political, given the Act really hasn’t been regularly invoked. ”\nBut Baker said he believes Donald Trump Jr’s discussions about Ukraine raise questions: “Obviously Orbán is opposed to helping Ukraine, has blocked the EU from making a substantial payment to Ukraine, and so therefore he is an ally of the Trump people.”\nAn example of a Logan Act violation that could have taken place during those discussions, Baker added, would be if “Trump Jr encouraged Orbán not to release the funds” or encouraged him “to go on blocking the EU’s funds for Ukraine.”\nBaker told The Independent there needs to be more consideration of the Logan Act in light of recent news: “This is a subject we ought to be discussing.”\nHe added that the former president’s discussion with Orbán earlier this year was also concerning under the Logan Act.\n“To have the Republicans’ likely candidate taking a position on foreign policy [as it relates to Russia and Ukraine], getting close to actively opposing what the administration is doing, is a worrying situation we ought to be talking about,” Baker told The Independent .\nAn ultra-conservative ‘training ground’ Trump Jr was also scheduled to speak on Thursday afternoon at Mathias Corvinus Collegium (MCC), a conservative Hungarian residential college. The event is not listed on the college’s public website as of Thursday.\nScheppele says the college serves as a “training ground” for members of Orbán’s Fidesz party. She said the college is where conservative leaders gather to determine how to keep the party in power.\n“The MCC is a training ground for the young people who are going to go into Orbán’s government,” Scheppele told The Independent .\nThe MCC was founded in 1996 with private money from the Fidesz party. In 2021, The New York Times reported that Orbán had funneled $1.7 billion in government funds and assets to the college as he prepared to seek re-election the following year.\nScheppele said one of the primary functions of the MCC is to maintain Orbán’s hold on Hungary: “[The MCC] is also the idea factory for the Orbán government: ‘How can we adjust the laws so we never lose power?’”\nUnder Orbán, Hungary is in a democratic backslide. Freedom House rates Hungary as only “partly free,” noting the country’s anti-immigration and anti-LGBTQ+ policies, as well as policies “that hamper the operations of opposition groups, journalists, universities, and nongovernmental organizations.”\nLike father, like son Trump Jr’s father and the Hungarian prime minister also have a long-standing allyship.\nOrbán went as far as to call the former president his “good friend” earlier this year when the duo met in Washington, DC. Meanwhile, Scheppele told The Independent, Trump — who famously threatened to become a dictator on day one of his potential second presidency — may be looking to Orbán as a model for policy.\nRichard Benson, a senior policy analyst with the Center for American Progress, told The Independent it is dangerous for American voters to subscribe to “American exceptionalism” and to assume the democratic backsliding in Hungary can’t possibly happen in the US.\n“I think our institutions are resilient — but that resiliency demands a careful eye,” Benson said. “We can’t take it for granted that we’re simply going to be okay. If you talk to Hungarians, they didn’t expect it to happen the way it did.”\nThere are several parallels between Trump and Orbán’s policies.\nTrump has made his far-right, anti-immigration stance clear since day one of his 2016 presidential campaign. Similarly, Orbán has expressed radical views on immigration since 2015 — and in 2022, he said he did not want Hungarians to become “peoples of mixed race.”\nThe pair have also both tossed aside NATO and its processes. The former president has threatened to violate NATO by allowing Russia to attack member states ; meanwhile, Orbán delayed a vote on Sweden’s membership for 18 months. As a result, the country was not admitted until this yea r .\nBoth Scheppele and Benson also pointed to Project 2025, a conservative playbook for the next presidential administration. Along with replacing supposedly impartial federal officials with fellow conservatives, Project 2025 also calls for several policy revisions, such as re-adding the citizenship question to the US Census.\nOrbán’s success leading an “authoritarian” government relied on “decapitating” the civil service and replacing it with his extremist allies, which mirrors the Project 2025 strategy, Scheppele told The Independent .\nWes Coopersmith, the Chief of Staff for the Heritage Foundation who oversees Project 2025, previously told The Independent that replacing employees with Republican allies if Trump is elected would be “democratic.”\n“We think the most democratic way to run the administration is with folks who agree with the president, who voted for the president, who agree with his policies and want to implement that,” Coopersmith said.\nOrbán’s suddenly uncertain future Just days ahead of Trump Jr’s scheduled visit, the European Parliament elections threw Orbán into an unprecedented, weakened position .\n“Orbán, for the first time in 14 years, has a real electoral problem,” Scheppele told The Independent.\nWhile the Fidesz party still received more votes than any other Hungarian party, they will only make up eleven of Hungary’s 21 EU delegates. What’s more, this weekend marked their worst performance since 2004 — long before Orbán’s reign began in 2010.\n“I think he assumed that he was just going to, as usual, swamp the vote,” Scheppele said.\nThe politician responsible for bringing the Fidesz party numbers down is Péter Magyar, a former Fidesz insider who is now looking to end Orbán’s rule.\n“[Orbán] is still winning, but he has lost so much support,” Scheppele said. “The fact that the emperor has no clothes is suddenly visible.”\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "text": "Сырая свекла — частый гость в наших салатах и смузи. Но многие замечали, что после их употребления в горле появляется жжение.\nПо словам токсиколога Михаила Кутушова, свекла богата бетаинами, антоцианами и щавелевой кислотой. Именно она вместе с оксалатами может раздражать слизистые, особенно если в горле есть микроповреждения.\nЧаще всего дискомфорт вызывает свежевыжатый сок или натертый на терке овощ — именно в таком виде концентрация активных веществ максимальна.\nЭто не значит, что от сырой свеклы стоит отказаться. Напротив, она полезна: снижает воспаление, регулирует пищеварение, поддерживает печень и сосуды.\nОсторожнее следует быть людям с мочекаменной болезнью. Также не стоит увлекаться свеклой при гипотонии — в составе есть природные нитраты, которые понижают давление. При диабете стоит учитывать средний гликемический индекс вареной свеклы и избегать переедания.\nДля здорового взрослого хватит 80–150 г свеклы в день. Детям — меньше, желательно в термически обработанном виде, добавил Кутушов в разговоре с \"Доктор Питер\".\nХотите знать больше?

    "text": "Meta has confirmed that every day criminals are using text messaging, dating apps, social media and email to further scams and fraud, most commonly what are known as pig-butchering scams whereby victims are fleeced into fraudulent investment schemes. But Meta is fighting back and, across 2024 alone, it has closed down more than two million accounts being used by organized crime for this purpose on Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. Here’s what you need know.\nForbes Now Hackers Are Using Snail Mail In Cyber Attacks—Here’s How By Davey Winder Facebook, Instagram And WhatsApp Accounts Closed By Meta As Organized Crime Groups Targeted In a Nov. 21 report, “ Cracking Down On Organized Crime Behind Scam Centers ,” Meta has detailed just how it is taking action to target organized crime groups behind pig-butchering scams in Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, the United Arab Emirates and the Philippines. “We’re going after the criminal organizations behind pig butchering and other schemes,” Meta said, “ which target people globally through messaging, dating, social media and crypto and other apps to convince them to invest under false pretenses.”\nThis report represents the first time that Meta has shared details of how it approaches the countering of cross-border criminal activity, in particular those organizations behind forced-labor “scam compounds.” Meta has a Dangerous Organizations and Individuals safety policy that makes it clear there is no place on Facebook, Instagram or WhatsApp “for groups or individuals that promote violence, organized crime, hate or terrorism.”\nThe Meta intelligence report reveals how criminally operated scam compounds are put into play which force workers to engage in everything from cryptocurrency and loan fraud, to the type of pig-butchering already mentioned. “We assess that much of the scam centers’ activity is tightly scripted by criminal syndicates to scale their operations,” Meta said, “it includes some forced-labor scammers focusing on casting a wide net online to ‘spray and pray’ by reaching out to a large number of people via text message or online with a relatively generic appeal in hopes that some of them will respond.”\nElon Musk Apparently Just Became The No. 1 ‘Diablo 4’ Player In The World Stop Using Your Passwords—1Password And Google Warn No, Your Gmail Isn’t Truly Private—2 Ways To Fix That Forbes Don’t Hold Down The Ctrl Key—New Warning As Cyber Attacks Confirmed By Davey Winder Scammers Target Facebook, Instagram And WhatsApp Meta explained in the intelligence analysis report how scammers usually start their attacks on dating apps, or by text message, email, social media such as Facebook and Instagram, or by way of messaging apps such as WhatsApp . All of this is a pretence to moving the conversation, and that scam attack itself, into an environment where it can be more closely controlled by the criminal gangs, such as crypto apps or scam websites.\nMeta said that it set up critical partnerships with key external partners in order to ensure it is taking a holistic approach to defending users against a wide range ion such scams. This means that, during the past two years, Meta has “stood up teams and systems to help identify and go after these scam hotspots globally under our DOI and safety policies.” These actions can be broken down into four main categories:\nDangerous organizations and individuals policy: used to disrupt organized crime, continuously investigate and assess criminal organizations and, once identified, banning them from all Meta platforms. On-platform enforcements: the monitoring of these dangerous organizations and individuals as they attempt to circumvent account banning enforcement. This includes looking for new scam compounds globally and continuously disrupting their operations, Meta said. Working with others: part of the focus of Meta operations is to counter and deter others from using its platforms for illegal purposes. “We know that these are extremely persistent and well-resourced criminal organizations working to evolve their tactics and evade detection,” Meta said, “this makes collaboration within industries and countries even more critical.” Law enforcement: and finally, as part of the threat disruption effort, Meta works with global law enforcement to share intelligence and help them protect their communities wherever they are. Forbes Google’s Gmail And Photos Deletion Warning As 1-Year Timer Expires By Davey Winder Meta Rolling Out New Protective Features Across Facebook, Instagram And WhatsApp Platforms Meta also has an infographic to help users spot scams and stay safe online.\nMeta concluded this new threat intelligence report by confirming that it is constantly rolling out new product features, across its Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp platforms, to help protect users from scammers at scale. “We will show you a warning in Messenger and Instagram DMs reminding you to be aware of potentially suspicious interactions or cold outreach from people you don’t know,” Meta said, “so you can slow down and review before accepting a message request. On WhatsApp, Meta explained, if you’re added to a group chat by someone you don’t know, “you’ll now see a context card giving you more information about the group—it’ll show who added you, how recently the group was created and who created it so you have context on this outreach.”\nForbes Gmail Users Beware—Link Hovering Attacks On The Up By Davey Winder",
