    "text": "AI Guardian: Simplifying AI Risk Assessments with Advanced Governance Solutions 04-02-2025 11:04 PM CET | Business, Economy, Finances, Banking & Insurance\nPress release from: ABNewswire\nIf you have been following the news in artificial intelligence, you probably already know that this field is growing at an exponential pace. Each day we are hearing about new use cases in AI, use cases, and applications that we haven't even dreamt of in the past few years.\nBut in the same news, you probably are also hearing about AI systems that have been deployed to production that are not yielding the expected outcomes. We are hearing about chatbots that have been misdirecting customers and employees into making the wrong decisions.\nWe also heard about chatbots that are hallucinating responses to customers. And we also heard about models that have been generating biased outcomes.\nThere is no denying that there is huge potential in artificial intelligence, but a premature deployment and adoption of AI systems could put companies at a huge risk of reputational and financial loss. And this exactly is the reason why AI governance platforms [ https://www.aiguardianapp.com/ ] have become one of the most relevant and important topics today.\nWhat is an AI Governance Framework?\nAI governance refers to a set of rules, standards, and processes that have been set in place in order to ensure the responsible and ethical development and deployment of artificial intelligence systems.\nThink of it as a set of guardrails, that ensure the ethical use of these artificial intelligence systems so that we minimize the risk in the systems while maximizing the potential benefit.\nImage: https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeU6GYrKkVWsBZvKM-hhQkjzDYvq5L5c4dCBaBiSHkE1rsMB3oly-HCBXpo6fEluYStQ5Gbp9RRBC67ByNOgbw8IG_xAimFdAcQJhrJToc75G3xGNCjT8q2KKb1Jwi6XDo?key=4fVy0rGcaHLlKsWG-WXJDWLK\nBenefits of AI Governance\nNow we all know what the benefits are of artificial intelligence. It leads to reduced costs, improved efficiency, and leads to automation of repetitive and manual tasks. While these benefits make artificial intelligence a highly important topic and the most sought-after technology today, there is still at risk in artificial intelligence that is making AI governance an even more important topic to be discussed.\nWhat are the Components of an AI Governance Framework?\n*\nManage an AI Inventory\n*\nConduct Risk Assessments\n*\nEstablish Roles and Accountability\n*\nConduct Model Testing\n*\nTrack Laws and Regulations\n*\nGenerate Model Documentation\n*\nManage Vendor Risk\n*\nTrain and Educate Your Team\nChallenges of AI Risk AssessmentLack of Transparency\nNo matter how much the AI models become smarter, there will always be the chance of errors with AI, and there are dozens of examples available on the internet. Even the developers who made these systems don't know how AI operates and assess risks. This lack of visibility makes it challenging to assess risks, and due to this organizations struggle to build trust with stakeholders\nRapid Technological Leaps\nAI is growing at a rapid growth and the government is no doubt trying to adopt the new technologies but they can't achieve the maximum. As a result, AI systems lack some crucial resources and fail to detect risks. Even organizations failed to establish stable risk assessment frameworks, as the tools and techniques used today may become obsolete within months.\nRegulatory & Legal Hurdles\nGovernments worldwide are introducing new laws to ensure AI systems remain ethical, transparent, and fair, but they can do this to some extent. Because every region and industry is different so do the rules which may conflict with one another. Moreover, it's early to say that AI will become smart enough to handle legal issues as many AI regulations are still in their early stages.\nEthical Dilemmas\nThe purpose of using AI in risk assessment is to reduce human efforts. The problem we are seeing this AI today is unfair behavior of AI based on different factors like race, gender, or social background. Another ethical issue is deciding how much control AI should have. We all know that AI can analyze huge amounts of data fast, but should it always make important decisions without human supervision?\nBest Practices for AI Risk MitigationAI Model Discovery\nEvery technology comes with challenges and limitations but it does not mean we should not adopt technology. Instead of fear from AI, organizations should have clear information about all AI models that they are using in their systems for transparency and accountability. If you do not know which AI platform works best for risk assessment associated with your business, you will face severe security risks.\nAI Model Risk Assessment\nIf you have done with AI models, the next step is to identify potential threats and weaknesses in artificial intelligence systems before they cause harm. However, a detailed risk check-up will help AI models to work correctly and follow legal rules. To properly check AI risks, organizations should use a clear process that includes regular monitoring, and third-party audits.\nImage: https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcS8q3kS6svjzXPd6IN5u_CRvJuY0TPcBCct75uE6c5gY-1F2mN0Vq06oM5QkIjIUuy-hC20o_QEJE0CMK5ky3PT4R8oIxloYYjdGKUdC0Repj23re5sl3syZ1VOgaciQ?key=4fVy0rGcaHLlKsWG-WXJDWLK\nData & AI Mapping and Flows\nAI needs excessive and accurate data to perform well and AI governance platforms have an abundance of data but without a clear mapping of its sources, organizations face the risk of data breaches.\nHowever, if data is mapped properly then AI will surely help to find weak points. To map data and AI effectively, organizations should record all data sources and track how AI changes the data,\nData & AI Controls\nUsing AI for risk assessment if fine but its important to make sure that AI models operate securely and ethically. Without proper controls, AI system may process unauthorized data, or fail to meet industry standards. As a business owner, you can use AI controls by defining clear policies for data usage and implementing encryption techniques. Additionally, AI models should undergo continuous testing and validation to detect erorors and performance issues.\nConclusion\nThe rapid growth of artificial intelligence presents both opportunities and risks for businesses. Without proper AI governance frameworks, organizations are at risk of reputational and financial loss. To mitigate these risks, businesses should conduct thorough risk assessments and stay updated on laws and regulations.\nImplementing best practices such as AI model discovery and risk assessment can help ensure the responsible use of AI. Ultimately, AI governance platforms play a pivotal role in maximizing the benefits of AI while minimizing the associated risks.\nMedia Contact\nCompany Name: Aiguardianapp\nContact Person: David Thomas\nEmail:Send Email [ https://www.abnewswire.com/email_contact_us.php?pr=ai-guardian-simplifying-ai-risk-assessments-with-advanced-governance-solutions ]\nCity: New York\nCountry: United States\nWebsite: https://www.aiguardianapp.com/\nLegal Disclaimer: Information contained on this page is provided by an independent third-party content provider.

    "text": "November 15, 2024 Cloud adoption poses hurdles for broadcast workflows despite promise of flexibility By Dak Dillon Subscribe to NewscastStudio for the latest news, project case studies and product announcements in broadcast technology , creative design and engineering delivered to your inbox. First Name Last Name Your Email Address (Required)\nAs streaming services flood screens with content and viewers demand programming across ever-multiplying platforms, broadcasters face mounting pressure to produce more content while controlling costs. For many media companies, the answer lies in the cloud—but the transition is proving anything but simple.\nGone are the days when a broadcaster could focus solely on linear television delivery. Today, broadcasters at all levels are juggling content, simultaneously feeding traditional channels, streaming platforms, social media and mobile apps—often with customized versions of content. This new reality naturally pushes the industry toward cloud-based production workflows that promise greater flexibility and efficiency.\n“Broadly, we are seeing a collapsing of media technology product market segments,” said Rick Young, senior vice president and head of global products at LTN . “We are seeing a transformation where segments like live content acquisition, playout, graphics, switching, publishing and delivery are all being combined under one product or solution. This is a new scenario and media companies able to leverage these technology enhancements are best positioned to compete.”\n“Technology is the main driver of efficiency and cost savings today with scalability and elasticity, but it’s not just the technology itself, it’s also the new workflows it enables. With today’s connectivity and collaboration enabled by new tech we are seeing massive efficiencies with mutualized resources across teams, locations and organizations avoiding duplicate efforts while delivering better results,” said Aaron Kroger, product marketing lead, Dalet .\nYet the shift from traditional broadcast infrastructure, built around physical studios and satellite distribution, to cloud-based systems presents challenges as its adoption continues to scale. Industry experts point to legacy integrations, infrastructure costs and training requirements as key barriers impacting adoption. Legacy integration and potential security challenges\nThe broadcast industry’s shift to cloud faces a challenge: integrating new systems with existing infrastructure while maintaining security.\n“My approach would be by islands. That would offer the broadcaster to climb on the learning curve distributing the risks and costs over a longer time span,” said Sergio Brighel, executive vice president of robotics and prompting technology at Videndum Production Solutions . “Hard transitions like ST2110, remote production and cloud based assets cannot be executed without a phased approach.”\nFor many broadcasters, success depends on careful integration planning. Advertisement\n“Moving to cloud is often a trigger to simplify workflows more generally, reducing unnecessary complexity built up over time,” said Tony Jones, principal technologist at MediaKind . “However, a move to cloud is disruptive and requires those workflows to be reconsidered, meaning it can often spur an efficiency-focused reset.”\nThe security implications of these hybrid environments add another layer of complexity.\n“Broadcasters are trying to identify single points of failure in either their own or their service providers’ workflows,” said Chris Clarke, chief revenue officer and co-founder of Cerberus . “Recent security events and DNS issues have highlighted the fact that reliance on particular vendors, networks and cloud providers doesn’t fit into best practices.”\n“To manage this transition successfully, broadcasters should partner with trusted cloud service providers, implement strong security measures, and focus on gradual migration of operations,” said Jay Ganesan, senior vice president of APAC at Amagi . “We recommend starting with specific functions like playout or disaster recovery, then expanding to full cloud-based operations as teams become more comfortable with the new technologies.”\nIn December, we’ll dive deeper into cybersecurity with a special roundtable on cybersecurity for broadcasters. Connectivity demands\nRemote production’s growing prevalence has heightened the importance of reliable connections for acquisition and distribution.\n“Remote production is fast becoming the norm, even for complex live events. That is calling for very sophisticated network connectivity, demanding the highest standards in quality, reliability, latency and security,” said Sergio Ammirata, founder and chief scientist at SipRadius .\nRobert Szabo-Rowe, head of engineering and product management at Tata Communications , noted that broadcasters increasingly view IP-based distribution as an alternative to traditional satellite delivery.\n“Broadcasters find satellite distribution increasingly costly and less accessible as mobile operators use more spectrum for 5G. We can expect broadcasters to accelerate their shift toward IP-based distribution,” Szabo-Row said.\n“The ability to send signals anywhere, to be viewed on any device with ultra-low latency, is transformational,” said Ammirata. “Using techniques like rist2rist means distribution networks — to remote editors, to supervising producers, to final delivery — can be spun up via the cloud when needed; dropped the moment the production ends.” Technical skills gap\nThe transition requires broadcast engineers to develop new IT systems and cloud architecture expertise.\n“You can’t just mirror the fault finding and integration approaches of SDI when moving to IP,” said Paul Turner, director of product management at AJA Video Systems . “Your video engineers must understand the basics of how network switches work, traffic shaping rules, NMOS, etc. It requires a lot of training of the technical staff.” Advertisement\nBroadcast skills gap: The changing landscape of virtual production\n“Moving from traditional production techniques to remote and collaborative live events with people and hardware in multiple locations demands completely fresh thinking,” said Ammirata. “No longer are workflows constrained by the technology: We can put creation, control and processing anywhere, meaning you have the freedom to create the workflows you really need to deliver the program.”\nFor smaller broadcasters, the challenge is particularly acute. While larger media companies can invest in comprehensive training programs, regional stations and smaller operations often struggle to attract and retain talent with the necessary combination of broadcast and IT expertise. Cost and resource management in the cloud\nWhile cloud solutions promise long-term cost benefits through increased flexibility, the transition requires careful financial planning.\n“By transitioning to the cloud, media companies replace large CapEx investments with flexible, on-demand services that can easily provision more resources at a moment’s notice,” said Young.\nDalet report highlights budget, workflow challenges in news industry\n“When considering costs, a holistic view is merited, considering all the costs involved for both the on-premises and cloud options (such as maintenance, server upgrades, cooling, building rent, IT staff),” said Jones, emphasizing the importance of total cost of ownership (TCO) analysis when considering the cloud.\n“Cloud and remote productions enable broadcasters to produce most live content at a lower cost. By utilizing centralized remote production, organizations can operate with smaller teams and transport less equipment, which minimizes travel, transport, and accommodation costs,” said Szabo-Rowe.\nCloud technology offers new possibilities for resource management, which is particularly important as broadcasters face pressure to maximize efficiency (and reduce overhead).\n“Cloud technology brings on-demand flexibility… meaning better utilization of resources as well as the ability to scale up as needed. This avoids the high costs and inefficiencies of maintaining idle resources when they are not being used,” said Jones.\n“With the unpredictable nature of breaking news, sporting events and elections, the cloud allows for resources such as storage and media processing to instantly scale up and down to meet these demands all while doing it sustainably. No longer do you need large systems sitting mostly idle to manage those peaks, instead the cloud scales up just for those moments which can greatly reduce your carbon footprint,” said Kroger.\n“The most palpable benefit of moving workflows to a cloud, whether private and controlled, or public, is that investing in hardware that sits idle most of the time is no longer required,” said Chris Scheck, head of marketing content at Lawo . “Also, less gear needs to be transported to venues and arenas for live coverage, while collaboration and distributed production scenarios may be faster to implement.” Looking ahead\nDespite these challenges, industry experts see cloud adoption as inevitable. The flexibility and scalability offered by cloud-based workflows align with the industry’s need to adapt to changing viewer habits and content delivery requirements.\n“The big shift that I am feeling is an increased sense of pragmatism in the industry. Specifically, a broader acceptance that the broadcast platforms and workflows that we deploy increasingly need to align, from a cost and complexity perspective, with the value of the content being created,” said Andy Hooper, senior vice president of live products at Ateliere Creative Technologies .\n“Cloud services significantly enhance the scalability of broadcast production by allowing broadcasters to rapidly adjust their operations in response to demand. This flexibility enables quick launch of new channels, seamless adaptation to market conditions, and the ability to scale resources up or down as needed, all without the limitations of physical infrastructure,” said Ganesan.\nIndustry Insights: Navigating the future of broadcast workflows\nIndustry Insights: Remote production, automation and efficiency in broadcast workflows\nIndustry Insights: Reshaping broadcast workflows through the cloud\nThe industry’s move to cloud-based workflows represents more than a technological shift—it signals a fundamental change in how broadcast content is produced and delivered. While challenges remain, the potential benefits of increased flexibility, scalability, and efficiency continue to drive adoption across the broadcast sector.

La situación desconcertó al público, pues Colón era uno de los artistas más esperados junto a Gilberto Santa Rosa, Óscar D´León, El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico y Víctor Manuelle, quienes también fueron invitados al evento. Según reportaron medios locales, la ausencia del artista fue causada a raíz de síntomas que estaba presentando por el cambio de temperatura. Dolor en el pecho y la garganta fueron algunos de los malestares que reportó el manager de Colón. Aunque aún no hay declaraciones públicas sobre el suceso, está claro que el cantante se recuperó. Después de la espera, volvió a encender la fiesta y subir a la tarima con un clásico legendario:El Gran Varón. Algunos de los asistentes se quejaron de lo ocurrido, mientras que otros resaltaron la importancia de tener compasión por Colón, ya que con 73 años sigue manteniendo una voz saludable y presentando, bailando y tocando su trompeta. Esta no es la primera vez que el intérprete de Idilio es noticia por su estado de salud. Hace unos años, en 2021, Colón sufrió un accidente de tráfico que lo dejó gravemente herido con una conmoción cerebral y fracturas en sus vértebras cervicales. “Siento no poder responder sus hermosas palabras de apoyo. La noticia de que estoy bien, lamentablemente, no es cierta. Es un largo camino para la recuperación”, escribió el cantante el 27 de abril por medio de su cuenta de X, siete días después del siniestro.

Por fortuna, el salsero se encuentra recuperado de ese incidente.",

    "title": "Humboldt sees heaviest day of rainfall over the last two months on Friday",
    "text": "Heavy rainfall filled the sky on Friday but those showers are not expected to carry over into the weekend with forecasts expecting the precipitation to be behind us by Saturday morning.\n“This is really for the week,” James White, a meteorologist with the Eureka National Weather Servicex, said. “It’s a good burst of rain, probably the single best rainstorm we’ve had for the fall season so far.”\nWhite and the National Weather Service expect close to three inches of rain in the Del Norte region by the time the storm ends, which is expected to end late Friday evening. The Humboldt Bay region is only expected to get around just an inch of rain but White added that this is the farthest south-reaching rainstorm of the year.\n“They’re getting rain down in Mendocino and Lake County. A few tenths of an inch which they hadn’t really seen much this year,” White said. “Except for just a couple days ago. So all told, it’s definitely our first really great widespread rain of the fall season which is always good to see.”\nThe rain isn’t here to stay, with no rain in the forecast next week but is expected to return to the area mid-November. Friday’s rainfall is the largest amount for the area since a surprising storm in August.\n“We’ve had a couple of little short ones, we had some rain earlier this week around Tuesday which was just a little bit weaker than this and we had a little bit of rain in mid-October that wasn’t quite this strong,” White said. “The last we’ve had at this same magnitude was actually, believe it or not, in late-August, which is pretty unusual for us. It’s unusual for us to get an event like that in August but we did this year, then we had a long dry spell through September and in October we’ve gotten some smaller rain events and this is definitely the biggest one of them so far. For this much rain, it’s been since late-August and if you look before that, you’d have to go all the way back to May.”\nThe rain wasn’t the only severe weather on Friday, with a wind advisory placed over most of Humboldt County, but like the rainfall, that too will be past us by Saturday. Gusts got up to 50-60 miles per hour in peak locations with the gusts around the bay at 30 miles per hour. The wind advisory remains in place until 5 p.m. Friday evening.\n“Those strong gusts are ongoing at the moment, the very strongest potential has pretty much already passed and it will slowly decline here through the evening,” White said. “Expect those elevated gusts until the early evening today and by late tonight we’ll be definitely winding down.”\nAt this point in the season, it’s unlikely that the rainfall will cause flooding but the large amount of precipitation could create other problems for drivers on the North Coast.\n“The soil has so much space for it to absorb water still, our flooding impacts are pretty minimal,” White said. “Our normal concerns at this point in the season would be more localize, things like rocks coming down on the road. (Rocks) have been displaced or sat there all summer and the water could kick them onto the road or usually with the early rains we could have a bunch of oils and stuff from summer that can make the roads extra slick. Especially if folks aren’t used to driving in the rain, that’s always a bigger threat earlier in the season and then proper flooding becomes a bigger threat later in the season.”\nFor more up-to-date weather information, go to weather.gov/eka .\nDylan McNeill can be reached at 707-441-0526.",
