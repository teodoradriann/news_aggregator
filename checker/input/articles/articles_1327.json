Nelson was a late addition to the Canadian roster after initially being cut at the [pre-tournament selection camp](https://northernontario.ctvnews.ca/two-north-bay-battalion-players-aim-to-crack-canada-s-world-juniors-lineup-1.6676621). During an interview with TSN’s [Mark Masters](https://www.tsn.ca/talent/mark-masters-1.57261) Thursday, Nelson smiled when he heard about all of the support he has been getting from Battalion fans, and the city as a whole, back home.

He was in Pittsburgh, Penn. to watch the Penguins play and was on his way to catch the Steelers game as part of a family vacation when [Hockey Canada](https://www.hockeycanada.ca/en-ca/home) called him. “I got the news about 10, 15 minutes before I was about to walk out the door for the Steelers game,\" the North Bay Battalion defenceman said. \"Packed up the car and was on the road to Toronto within 20, 30 minutes.\" Nelson boarded a flight in Toronto at 4 p.m. on Sunday. He landed in Gothenburg a little after 3 p.m. on Monday. He would have arrived sooner, but his connecting flight was delayed. \"We were flying into Gothenburg and the winds were too heavy,\" he said. \"We landed, but then had to go right back into the air. It was a pretty scary day, not going to lie. Then we were in Stockholm for about an hour and a half. Luckily, we were able to land in Gothenburg when we flew back. It was about a 45-minute flight so not too bad.\" Nelson played a little over seven minutes against Finland but didn’t record a point. “There’s nothing more grateful than playing at Mem. (Memorial) Gardens with the fans behind me and it’s now amazing to have them behind me here,” Nelson said. Team Canada has the day off on Thursday at the tournament. The next game will be a tough test for the Canadians facing off against host country Sweden on Friday at 1:30 p.m. EST. The game is on [TSN](https://www.tsn.ca/).

Foi a menor taxa de desocupação desde o trimestre encerrado em fevereiro de 2015, também de 7,5%. A população desocupada ficou em 8,2 milhões, um recuo de 6,2% (menos 539 mil pessoas) no ano. Foi o menor contingente de desocupados desde o trimestre móvel encerrado em abril de 2015 (8,15 milhões). Já a população ocupada, de 100,5 milhões, é o novo recorde da série histórica e cresceu 0,8% (mais 815 mil pessoas) no ano. O nível da ocupação (percentual de pessoas ocupadas na população em idade de trabalhar) foi a 57,4%. Diferença do desemprego em relação ao Caged Diferentemente do Cadastro Geral de Empregados e Desempregados (Caged), divulgado pelo Ministério do Trabalho e Emprego, que considera apenas os trabalhadores com carteira assinada, a pesquisa do IBGE mede a taxa de desemprego entre todos os trabalhadores na economia, incluindo o mercado informal. Na quinta-feira (28/12), foram divulgados os dados do Caged referentes a novembro. [O Brasil criou 130.097 empregos com carteira assinada no período](https://www.metropoles.com/negocios/brasil-cria-130-mil-empregos-formais-mas-ritmo-do-avanco-diminui). O resultado é a terceira redução seguida do ritmo de crescimento, embora o indicador tenha se mantido positivo nesse período.",

    "title": "Chuck E. Cheese brings back ‘Sensory Sensitive Sundays’ for kids with autism, special needs – QC Life",
    "text": "Chuck E. Cheese marks Autism Awareness Month with the return of its program for children with autism and other sensory sensitivity needs. The family entertainment and dining venue announced it will bring back its “Sensory Sensitive Sundays” program to participating locations nationwide on Sunday, April 11. The program creates dedicated playtime tailored for children with autism and other special sensory needs, offering a quieter dining and entertainment environment, dimmed lighting and a sensory-friendly arcade experience. Chuck E. Cheese locations that have reopened for games will open two hours early to host Sensory Sensitive Sunday events. The following locations in South Florida will participate in Sensory Sensitive Sunday on these dates: - BOCA RATON 21699 State Road 7, Boca Raton, FL 33428 - BOYNTON BEACH 244 N Congress Ave Bay 2A, Boynton Beach, FL 33425 - FORT LAUDERDALE – SUNRISE 8099 W Oakland Park Blvd, Sunrise, FL 33311 - HIALEAH 3805 West 20th Avenue, Hialeah, FL 33012 - KENDALL 8701 S W 124th Avenue, Miami, FL 33183 - MIAMI – NORTH – 20335 Biscayne Blvd. L-1, Miami, FL 33180 - MIAMI – SOUTH DADE 18575 South Dixie Hwy, Miami, FL 33157 - PEMBROKE PINES 8515 Pines Blvd, Pembroke Pines, FL 33024 - POMPANO BEACH 2201 N Federal Hwy #201, Pompano Beach, FL 33062 - STUART 2400 N.W.

Select locations nationwide will reintroduce the program the first Sunday of every month for the remainder of 2021, according to a release. “For many years, we’ve hosted Sensory Sensitive Sundays to ensure that Chuck E. Cheese is truly the place where every kid can be a kid,” CEC Entertainment chief marketing officer Sherri Landry said in a release. “We’ve heard from families that they appreciated the program and how much they’ve missed it while it’s been paused during the pandemic. Bringing back Sensory Sensitive Sundays during Autism Awareness Month is a fitting way to celebrate and support these children and their families.” Chuck E. Cheese is also launching a month-long round-up campaign benefiting Autism Speaks, allowing guests to round up their purchases to the nearest dollar and support Autism Speaks’ research and advocacy efforts. The CDC estimates that approximately 1 in 54 children in the U.S. are diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder. “Finding ways to create spaces where autistic children feel safe, seen and heard is what makes Chuck E. Cheese the ultimate place where Every Kid Can be A Kid,” the company said. Chuck E. Cheese launched Sensory Sensitive Sundays for the first time in 2018. For more information on Chuck E.

    "text": "POWER CUTS LATEST: Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) say all Highland customers should have the lights back on later today after mass power cuts caused by Storm Gerrit Easier access to your trusted, local news. Subscribe to a digital package and support local news publishing. Engineers from Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) hope to reconnect all remaining Highland customers hit by Storm Gerrit power cuts by later today. Teams from the power giant have been working through the night to tackle faults and breakages. By 11 am today, power had been restored to 47,000 homes and around 450 properties still off-grid. Gales, snow and heavy rain brought widespread damage to the grid infrastructure after storms hit on Wednesday. Localised faults remain in small pockets along the Great Glen, at Maryburgh, Achiltibuie and across Aberdeenshire and Perthshire. SSEN said these were “the sole focus” of today’s repair and restoration efforts, adding: “It is expected all customers will be reconnected through the course of today and this evening, barring any unforeseen challenges.” Improving conditions yesterday saw substantial progress made in reconnecting thousands of people who had lost supplies, helped by the arrival of additional line crews from contractors and other network operators through Wednesday and Thursday. Teams continued to work into the early hours to clear debris, which was hindering access to areas where repairs were needed. That resulted in hundreds more properties being reconnected late last night. Since first light today, crews have resumed targeted efforts to restore those final properties. These include customers in the Fort Augustus area, as well as some in Maryburgh, Ross-shire. SSEN is continuing to work closely with local resilience partners to coordinate welfare arrangements and identify customers who may benefit from additional support. Customer service teams are also in regular contact with those on the Priority Services Register to give updates and offer support with alternative accommodation where necessary. In mobilising its response, SSEN dealt with over 13,000 incoming calls, while making more than 11,000 proactive calls to priority service register customers who might have needed extra assistance. Welfare vans serving free hot food and drink have also been deployed. Andy Smith, operations director at SSEN Distribution, said: “Our operational teams have made excellent progress in restoring customers impacted by Storm Gerrit, in the face of continued challenging conditions last night. “We recognise this has been a difficult couple of days for the customers still affected, and I’m grateful to them for their continued patience and support as our teams work extremely hard to restore power. “Up to now we’ve targeted our restoration plan on repairing the faults that will reconnect the greatest number of customers, and those who have been without power the longest. “Today, we face a number of complex and very localised faults, and we press on to reconnect those final customers affected. “We are still encountering some access challenges. However, I’d like to reassure our customers that all our teams have been directed to these last few remaining areas of damage for this final push.” Anyone who may need additional help or advice should contact SSEN on the power cut helpline, 105.",
