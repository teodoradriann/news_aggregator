    "text": "SWNS Majority of Americans are future-proofing their homes against severe weather Read full article SWNS January 4, 2024 at 11:27 a.m. A new study has identified a growing concern compelling American homeowners to take action for their homes and families: over the next five years, a third of Americans believe severe weather events will leave their homes without power more often. The poll of 2,000 US homeowners found three in four have made improvements to their homes to address severe weather concerns, 73% of whom made modifications proactively to prevent future damage to the home. Homeowners stated they’re the most concerned about tornadoes (44%), hurricanes (30%) and thunder and lightning storms (30%), and that their top concerns as a result of severe weather are structural damage to their home (65%), power loss (58%), and the health and safety of their family/friends (57%). Sixty-four percent were concerned about power loss in their home — so much so that 59% would prioritize buying a portable power supply over other essentials like extra food (54%) and water (53%). To address concerns about their homes, the survey, commissioned by Generac and conducted by OnePoll, found homeowners implemented improvements including repairing or replacing the roof (34%), getting a power generator (32%) and improving the drainage system (24%). If they were to lose power today, nearly half (45%) said that compared to options like relying on an existing backup power source they already have at home (27%) or depending on a home solar system (7%), they would be stuck simply waiting for the utility to restore power. Over one in four (29%) said they “don’t feel confident” their local power provider can keep the power going during severe weather events. “As evolving climate patterns cause more extreme weather events, homeowners are assessing how power loss may affect their homes, and how they can plan ahead before it does,” said Kyle Raabe, president of Consumer Power for Generac Power Systems. “Millions of Americans are left in stressful, potentially dangerous situations amidst severe weather while they wait for power to be restored. No one should ever have to feel powerless at home.” The new data indicated homeowners’ concerns while simultaneously demonstrating a knowledge gap in home power. Half reported they understand how their home is powered only somewhat, a little, or not at all. The survey also looked into the awareness Americans have and lack when it comes to energy use habits and how electricity works within their home. Only 32% somewhat understand how their home consumes electricity, while 30% somewhat understand how their home is powered and 28% somewhat understand how their home is connected to the larger electrical grid. Only two in five (45%) believe their homes need the most power in the evenings, from 6 p.m. to midnight. Likewise, 34% believe their homes consume more than the standard average of 886kWh per month. However, the lack of knowledge isn’t for naught: many respondents monitor and attempt to manage energy consumption within their homes. They do so by checking their energy provider’s statement on a regular basis (50%), estimating energy use based on personal observations (29%), or by using smart energy devices (28%). TOP 9 CONCERNS AMERICANS HAVE OVER SEVERE WEATHER Structural damage to the home - 65% Losing power/electricity in the home - 58% The health and safety of family/friends - 57% Their own health and safety - 49% Damage to personal belongings - 40% Damage to their vehicle - 36% Their pet(s) experiencing discomfort or danger - 32% The home flooding - 31% Mold growth - 23% Survey methodology: This random double-opt-in survey of 2,000 American homeowners was commissioned by Generac between October 11 and October 16, 2023. It was conducted by market research company OnePoll, whose team members are members of the Market Research Society and have corporate membership to the American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) and the European Society for Opinion and Marketing Research (ESOMAR).\nTRENDING 1.

[ANI](/ani-stories)| Updated: 10-03-2024 23:32 IST | Created: 10-03-2024 23:32 IST - Country: - India Anand Mahindra, the Chairman of the Mahindra Group stressed the importance of private industrial corporations in developing military power while stating that there is a huge opportunity for an Indian version of a military-industrial partnership. He was addressing the fourth Atal Bihari Vajpayee Memorial lecture, which was organised by the Ministry of External Affairs. Addressing the lecture, Mahindra said, \"Without industry, as an actor first two prongs military and soft power would only be pale shadows of themselves. Let's take military power, to begin with. The development of the military-industrial complex in America was the pivotal factor in building the might of its armed forces and of course.\" He said that in addition to the robust government spending on military research, American military power was shaped by the formidable manufacturing capabilities of large American corporations. \"There was substantial government funding and spending on military research for sparking innovation. But, it was the formidable manufacturing capabilities of large American corporations that provided the muscle and sinews of American military power,\" he said. The Mahindra Group Chairman said there is a huge opportunity for an Indian version of a military-industrial partnership to emerge. \"Today there is a huge opportunity for an Indian version of a military-industrial partnership to emerge. We welcome the lists of defence hardware that have been put out by the Defence Ministry and which ensure that certain products can only be sourced from Indian suppliers. A step that speaks of confidence in the Indian industry and that's a promise we will fulfil,\" he added. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar also commended Anand Mahindra for his \"insightful address\" while stating that the memorial lecture is MEA's tribute to former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's foreign policy. Taking to social media platform X, he stated, \"The annual Atal Bihari Vajpayee Memorial Lecture is #TeamMEA's tribute to his foreign policy. Commend @anandmahindra's insightful address at its 4th edition. The collaboration between business, technology and foreign policy is essential for Viksit Bharat.\" (ANI) (This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

    "text": "PORTSMOUTH, Ohio (WCHS) — Today's weather did not put a damper on a two decades-old Portsmouth New Year's Day tradition. At noon about a couple dozen waded into the Ohio River and immediately waded out, all for a great cause. For more than 20 years, the polar plunge has been a fun yet crazy way to raise money. Organizers call it \"freezin' for a reason\". The event attracts young and old and childhood friends. Emily Stone has been taking part for six years Her two friends have been doing it for two years. \"It was just a simple text. We are doing this, and they said what time do we need to be there,\" said Stone. Perhaps the hardest part of the event is waiting, till the time comes to jump into the river, with people coming out as quickly as they jumped in. \"Invigorating. Feel alive,\" said Jason Snell. For the Snell family, the polar plunge has become a family tradition. \"We do it in celebration of all the lives that were saved through recovery this year and in memorial of all the lives that were lost,\" said Snell. \"I am immune to it. I don't know. I just am. I can handle it,\" said Ron Ferrell, a participant referring to the cold. John Simon, American Legion Post 23 Commander says his brother and his friends started the polar plunge more than 20 years ago. \"They decided it would be fun to go jump into the river on New Years Day to ring in the New Year. People started showing up, showing up,\" said Simon. A few years later it turned into a fundraiser. This year's money will go to local veterans in rest homes and for their Christmas, but for those taking the polar plunge it supplies them with memories that won't soon forgotten. \"The coldest it has ever been. It was fun though. Cold but fun,\" said Stone. Organizers say on average about 35 take the plunge every year, depending on how cold the weather is.",
