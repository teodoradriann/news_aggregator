    "text": "THAT was an amazing storm. This round of the northern lights has come to an end but the weekend will be almost as beautiful. High pressure is moving in which will create clear skies, light wind and mild temperatures. More good news is that the air quality has improved across the state as the high pressure is creating a northerly flow, pushing the smoke off to the south. Saturday will be mostly sunny with highs in the 60s to around 70. Sunday will mainly clear with highs in the 60s and 70s. Monday and Tuesday will be warmer with highs in the 70s and 80s. A southwest flow will push temperatures up to near record levels but also potentially steer more wildfire smoke up into the state. Late next week, a pattern change is looking more likely with a chance at moisture and cooler temperatures that should slow those wildfires down. Temperatures will drop and snow levels will drop as well. A more active weather pattern is likely from there through the rest of October.Have a great weekend,Curtis GrevenitzChief Meteorologist",

    "text": "LOCALS are furious at being kept all night by a car park of confused driverless AI taxis that continually beep at each other. Residents captured the moment driverless cars began driving around in circles with their lights on in the middle of the night. The driverless taxis, operated by Waymo, have reportedly been causing disturbances throughout the day as well. When the AI cars were first introduced to the neighborhood, locals were excited to see the new technology in practice. But the novelty has quickly worn off for many residents who \"don't find it funny anymore\". Randol White, resident, told the Los Angeles Times: \"I was happy to see the Waymos coming in, but this aspect of it, I'm not a fan.\" The 57-year-old said he first noticed the disturbance two weeks ago when the AI cars began going off at 4am. Despite reaching out to the company, he feels powerless to stop the disturbances. The AI cars are left in the parking lot and residents have no one to speak to once the cars start malfunctioning. \"That's the most frustrating thing, you're just yelling into the void,'\" Randol added. Most read in Motors Waymo has noted the problem and said they are working on a fix. The company said: \"We have identified the cause and are in the process of implementing a fix.\" Russel Pofsky, who has lived in the area for 20 years, said he’s never experienced anything like this. The longtime resident claimed the loss of sleep has made him \"more cranky\" than ever before. Other neighbors echo the sentiment. Christopher Cherry, who was initially excited about the technology, now finds the constant beeping a major distraction, affecting both his work and sleep. As residents wait for a fix, their patience is wearing thin, with many simply wishing the honking would stop. It comes after a new EU rule stated that all cars will now be fitted with speed-limiting AI tech. And new AI speed cameras being rolled out on UK roads can \"see inside your car\" and recognise \"every passenger\" before seeing pictures of them to the police",
