    "text": "HR Certified won the 2023 Best of America Small Business Award sponsored by BASA Awards, coming out on top over hundreds of other competitors\nAtlanta, United States - January 1, 2024 —\nHR Certified, a standout in the realm of professional development, has recently emerged triumphant in the prestigious Best of America Small Business Awards (BASA) by clinching three distinctive accolades. The company, helmed by Anthony P. Howard as its Founder and CEO, secured top honors in the categories of Best Startup - Education & Training, Best Campaign - Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Of The Year, and also secured a coveted spot in the TopList, boasting one of the entries with the highest number of votes from the public across all categories.\nThe BASA Awards, a highly anticipated event in the small business community, provided a platform for HR Certified to shine. Beating out hundreds of competitors, the company's success is a testament to its dedication to excellence in education and its unwavering commitment to fostering diversity, equity, and inclusion.

The comprehensive details available on the website provide insights into the criteria for nomination, the judging process, and the distinguished panel of judges responsible for evaluating the contenders.\nOne distinctive aspect of the BASA Awards is the requirement for potential recipients to self-nominate, fostering a sense of proactivity and commitment to excellence. The judging process, as outlined on the website, involved a meticulous evaluation, with contenders needing to score 75% and above to be considered for the Best of America Small Business Award. The evaluation incorporated input from an independent panel of judges, public voting, and the amalgamation of both public and judge scores ultimately determining the category winners.\nAnthony P. Howard, the visionary behind HR Certified, expressed his delight at the company's stellar performance in the BASA Awards. In a statement, he emphasized the significance of a process devoid of the influences of big corporations, nepotism, or pay-to-play frameworks. Howard articulated the company's gratitude for being recognized and rewarded for its impactful contributions.\n\"It was important for us to be pressure-tested with a process that big corporations, nepotism, or pay-to-play frameworks did not influence. We are grateful to have been noticed and rewarded for our impact,\" remarked Anthony P. Howard, underlining the integrity and transparency of the awarding process.\nHR Certified's triumph in the Best Startup - Education & Training category attests to its innovative approach in the realm of professional development. The company has evidently carved a niche for itself by providing top-notch educational services, with its HR Masterclass which activates the highest potential in HR professionals through HRCI and SHRM certification coupled with professional coaching, opportunities to expand professional networks and providing community to its clients.\nThe recognition for the Best Campaign - Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Of The Year highlights HR Certified's commitment to fostering an inclusive workplace environment. In an era where diversity and inclusion are paramount, the company's emphasis on these values is not just a strategic move but a genuine reflection of its organizational ethos. The organization has made information accessible through hosting LinkedIn Live events on cutting-edge topics and through its Campaign, they have extended scholarships to under-resourced diverse talent and their allies.\nFurthermore, securing a place in the TopList with one of the entries receiving the highest number of votes from the public showcases the widespread support and approval HR Certified enjoys from its audience. The public's validation, coupled with the endorsement from industry experts, solidifies the company's position as a leader in its field.\nFor those keen on delving into the intricacies of HR Certified's journey to success and its notable achievements at the BASA Awards, the company's official website provides a comprehensive resource.

    "title": "B.C. Conservative MLA says drug crisis cost lives of her brothers, niece and nephew",
    "text": "The House Leader of the Opposition B.C. Conservatives has described the “unsurmountable” price paid by her family in the province’s toxic drug crisis, which she said had claimed the lives of three of her cousins and a niece.\nA’aliya Warbus said in question period in the B.C. Legislature on Thursday that she had lost two of her brothers, a niece and a nephew, but later clarified to reporters that the male relatives were all her first cousins.\nShe told the legislature that just last week she attended a memorial for one cousin who died from “a lethal dose of drugs” a year ago.\n“Not only did it take two of my brothers, but also my niece, who died alone in a tent, in one of the tent cities, from an overdose by herself,” she said in question period.\nA member of the Sto:lo Nation and the daughter of former lieutenant-governor Steven Point, Warbus paused at several points as she choked on her words.\n“Just last fall, we buried my 13-year-old nephew, because he found a wallet with drugs in it, which he did that night in his bed while his mom slept in the next room. And he was not an addict,” she said, before renewing calls for a public inquiry into what she called the “failed experiment of safe supply.”\nShe said family members of those who had died deserved a transparent and accountable public inquiry “to expose who knew what, when.”\nWarbus later said that she wanted to clarify her relationships with the family members, because “it’s hard for people on the outside to understand Indigenous families.”\n“I have 35 first cousins. We all grew up in one village, all close proximity, and so my brother, that is my first cousin. My other brother, that is my other first cousin, he’s just a year older than me, very close in age.”\nThe boy she had referred to as a nephew was also a cousin, she told reporters, but “these are my brothers.”\n“To me they are. The outside world might not see us that way, but they are,” she said.\nThe issue of the government’s safer-supply drug program, in which addicted people are prescribed alternatives to street drugs, has dominated debate in the B.C. Legislature which is sitting this week for the first time in nine months.\nOn Wednesday, the NDP government announced a major revamp of the program, converting it to a “witnessed-only” model in which users are watched as they consume prescribed opioids, instead of being allowed to take them away.\nRELATED: B.C. ending take-home safer supply of opioids to stop criminal diversion\nOsborne said this was to prevent diversion of the drugs onto the street.\nHealth Minister Josie Osborne offered “sincere condolences” to Warbus, saying her experiences were “difficult to imagine.”\n“I want to acknowledge that this crisis has touched Indigenous Peoples in particular, in a very disproportionate way,” Osborne said.\nBut she said the safer-supply program had helped many people, and the government had to “act on evidence,” and it would continue with the program to get people the supports they need.\nWarbus said in an interview that she wanted to share her family’s story “to remind people that there are people behind the numbers that we look at every day and to really humanize that statistics and remember that these are lives we’re dealing with.”\n“This isn’t a currency. These people, my family, all of those lives, they’re not currency for people to use. It’s something that needs attention. It’s something that should break your heart. It’s something that is an injustice.”\nShe reflected on a text she received from her 14-year-old son earlier in the day, saying he wanted to go to a friend’s house.\n“I shouldn’t feel fear every time he says that, right? You shouldn’t, but I do, and he’s a good kid and he doesn’t get into trouble,” she said, adding that people don’t want to live in a society where a parent fears their child being exposed to drugs.\nWarbus said money needs to be put into helping people with addiction, trauma and other underlying causes to help them recover permanently.\nDuring question period, Warbus had said that one of her relatives died because the government “not only failed to stop the flow of fentanyl into our communities, they then inflated the market with so-called safe supply or safer supply.”\nDJ Larkin, executive director of the Canadian Drug Policy Coalition, said that “the data does not support that.”\n“That is conflating two things. The unregulated market of fentanyl, which includes analogues, benzodiazepines, tranquillizers, is what is driving people dying, and it tragic, and all of us are harmed by that,” Larkin said.\n“Safe-supply programs are not driving those deaths. The coroner data has been very clear on this that it is the unregulated drug market, not pharmaceuticals.”\nMore than 16,000 people have died in British Columbia since the toxic drug crisis was declared a public health emergency in April 2016.\nLast year’s death toll of 2,253 people was down 13 per cent , lower than any year since 2020.\nRELATED: Victoria saw increase in overdose calls, but drop in deaths in 2024\nLisa Lapointe, B.C.’s former chief coroner, also said statistics show illicit fentanyl, not prescription alternatives, drive overdose deaths in the province.\nShe said last year’s figures show hydromorphone, which is most often prescribed as part of the safer-supply program, was detected in three per cent of overdose fatalities, and those deaths were not necessarily due to the drug.\n“That number has not gone up. It is a very low percentage present,” Lapointe said, adding that fentanyl was present in about 84 per cent of deaths.\n“If the allegation is that safer supply … pharmaceuticals are leading do death, they are not,” Lapointe said.\nOpposition Leader John Rustad has accused Premier David Eby and his government of “gaslighting” the province over the issue of safer supply and drug diversion.\nLast March, both the RCMP’s commanding officer in B.C. and then-solicitor general Mike Farnworth said there was no evidence of “widespread” diversion of prescription alternatives.\nBut earlier this month, a leaked Health Ministry briefing for police said a “significant portion” of opioids prescribed in B.C. were being diverted, and prescribed alternatives were being trafficked provincially, nationally and internationally.\nRustad took credit for Thursday’s policy shift, saying on social media that the government had “caved on one of Eby’s signature policy proposals.”\n— With files from Brenna Owen in Vancouver\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Feb. 20, 2025.",

( KPTV /Gray News) - Oregon authorities say a Portland woman has been arrested and charged with animal abuse after she brought her kitten to an area animal hospital barely responsive and dyed pink.\nAccording to authorities, Elizabeth Zurcher-Wood brought the kitten into the Dove Lewis Animal Hospital on Dec. 12. The animal was suffering from hypothermia and in shock.\nZurcher-Wood reportedly told a veterinarian at the animal hospital that her cat was sick. So, she cleaned her with Windex glass cleaner, Spic and Span household cleaner and rubbing alcohol.\nThe veterinarian said the woman seemed to not understand that the chemicals she used were toxic to the cat.\nZurcher-Wood was taken into custody the following week and charged with two counts of animal abuse.\nThis is not the first time Zurcher-Wood has run into legal troubles.\nPolice said was previously arrested after trying to kidnap a child while wielding a machete.\nAccording to the Oregon Humane Society , the kitten is now healthy and is currently with a foster family.\nCopyright 2023 KPTV via Gray Media Group, Inc.

    "text": "En mai dernier,\nMicrosoft annonÃ§ait la fermeture de quatre studios chez Bethesda, dont son seul et unique studio japonais, Tango Gameworks. Et le gÃ©ant amÃ©ricain prÃ©parerait la suppression dâ€™autres studiosâ€¦ Quelques mois plus tÃ´t, en janvier, Microsoft annonÃ§ait un peu moins de 2Â 000 licenciements du cÃ´tÃ© de chez Activision-Blizzard. Cela reprÃ©sentait pas moins de 9% des 22 000 employÃ©s affectÃ©s au jeu vidÃ©o chez Microsoft. Et en cette rentrÃ©e 2024, le gÃ©ant amÃ©ricain confirme sa purge, avec 650 employÃ©s de nouveau remerciÃ©s.\nLa purge continue chez Microsoft\nAlors que\nles joueurs du monde entier n’ont pas encore fini de s’indigner face au prix exorbitant de la nouvelle PS5 Pro, voilÃ que Microsoft ajoute sa pierre Ã l’Ã©difice (de l’indignation gÃ©nÃ©rale) en annonÃ§ant, non pas une nouvelle console, non pas une nouvelle manette, mais un nouvelle vague de licenciements.\nPhil Spencer a tenu Ã confirmer que celle-ci n’entrainera la fermeture d’aucun studio, et que l’essentiel des emplois supprimÃ©s concerne les personnes occupant des rÃ´les corporatifs et/ou de soutien chez Activision Blizzard.\nPour Microsoft, il s’agit donc de poursuivre la rÃ©organisation de l’Ã©quipe suite Ã l’acquisition d’Activision Blizzard, et d’Ã©liminer les Ã©ventuels postes en doublon depuis le rachat. Le grand manitou de Xbox prÃ©cise que les employÃ©s concernÃ©s recevront des indemnitÃ©s de dÃ©part, mais aussi des services de reclassement, sans oublier une extension des soins de santÃ© pour â€œfaciliter leur transition“.\nAu total, ce sont 650 employÃ©s qui vont devoir quitter l’entreprise, soit environ 3% de l’effectif dÃ©diÃ© au jeu vidÃ©o chez Microsoft. C’est la troisiÃ¨me fois cette annÃ©e que Microsoft procÃ¨de Ã une vaste vague de licenciements. Rappelons que malgrÃ© sa bonne forme, Sony n’est pas en reste, avec l’annonce en fÃ©vrier du licenciement de 900 employÃ©s environ, avec la fermeture de London Studio.\nAu total, depuis le dÃ©but de l’annÃ©e 2024, on estime Ã plus de 12 000 le nombre de licenciements dans l’industrie du jeu vidÃ©o. Outre Microsoft et Sony, le groupe Embracer a lui aussi taillÃ© dans le vif, tout comme Take Two et Electronic Arts, sans oublier SEGA ou encore Epic Games.\nDu cÃ´tÃ© de chez Xbox,\nrappelons que l’on vient tout juste de lancer, dans une indiffÃ©rence assez gÃ©nÃ©rale, un trio de nouvelles Xbox, avec notamment un modÃ¨le Xbox Series X de 2 To, mais aussi une Xbox Series X Robot White de 1 To, dÃ©nuÃ©e de toute lecteur de disque… tout comme la future PS5 Pro, dont le lecteur de disque sera vendu en option (Ã 119â‚¬).\nğŸ“� Pour ne manquer aucune actualitÃ© de Presse-citron, suivez-nous sur\n[Google ActualitÃ©s]et",

    "title": "Dell 14 Plus convertible with Lunar Lake processor discounted by 36% - NotebookCheck.net News",
    "text": "The Dell Plus 14 convertible is currently down to just $699.99 at Best Buy , making for a $400 discount from its MSRP. For that price, buyers are getting a rather basic 14-inch IPS touchscreen with a resolution of 1,920 × 1,200, 60 Hz refresh rate, and peak brightness of 300 nits. However, the main selling point of the 2-in-1 is what's under the hood, namely an Intel Core Ultra 7 256V . The Lunar Lake processor packs four P-cores boosting to 4.8 GHz and another four LP E-cores humming at up to 3.7 GHz, in addition to Arc 140V integrated graphics consisting of eight second-gen Xe cores. Joining it is 16 GB of on-package LPDDR5X-8533 memory and a 1 TB PCIe 4.0 SSD, the latter being upgradable as it's installed in an M.2 2280 slot. Connectivity includes a Thunderbolt 4 port (40 Gbps, DisplayPort 2.1, Power Delivery), one 10 Gbps USB-C port (DisplayPort 1.4, Power Delivery), a 5 Gbps USB-A, HDMI 2.1, as well as a 3.5 mm audio combo jack. An Intel BE201 wireless card adds support for Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.4. The notebook's aluminum chassis measures 12.36 × 8.9 × 0.65 inches (314 × 226 × 16 mm) and weighs 3.55 lb (1.61 kg), while housing a 64 Wh battery capable of charging at up to 65 W through a USB-C adapter. Other features include a 1,080p webcam, a fingerprint reader embedded into the power button, and stylus support with 4,096 levels of pressure sensitivity ( sold separately for $39.99 ).

    "title": "Pipeline Inbox: Which prospects could make Opening Day rosters",
    "text": "Inbox: Which prospects could we see on Opening Day rosters? What a whirlwind it’s been! We’re all trying to catch our breath following our Spring Training travels and the excitement of the inaugural [Spring Breakout games](https://www.mlb.com/news/spring-breakout-standout-prospects-2024?t=mlb-pipeline-coverage). This is a fun time of year with prospects either making Opening Day rosters ( [we’re looking at you](https://www.mlb.com/stories/padres-prospect-jackson-merrill-mlb-debut), Jackson Merrill) or close to nailing them down (the subject of the first question in this week’s MLB Pipeline Inbox). At the same time, the amateur baseball scene is cranking at full-steam and we’re starting to move our attention to the 2024 Draft. With that in mind, I’ve split this week’s Inbox in half between prospects in Spring Training and those on the Draft landscape. There are plenty we knew were going to make it -- the Jackson Chourios and Evan Carters of the world. And we knew going in that guys like Jackson Holliday and Masyn Winn, to name two, would be given a very long look and opportunity to make the club out of Spring Training. Then there are surprise Opening Day guys and that list has to start with the Rangers’ Wyatt Langford. It’s not that we didn’t think he was talented: We do have him as our [No. 6 overall prospect](https://www.mlb.com/prospects/2024/top100/wyatt-langford-694671), after all. It was clear he wasn’t going to spend a long time in the Minors after reaching Triple-A during his pro debut after signing as the No. 4 overall pick in last summer’s Draft, finishing with a .360/.480/.677 slash line. There was little question that he’d impress in big league camp … but make the team? That wasn’t a slam dunk. But it became one thanks to his .388/.446/.796 line over 17 Cactus League games. As of Thursday, Langford leads all Cactus League hitters in home runs (six), slugging percentage and OPS (1.242). It hasn’t been officially announced that he’s on the team, but it should be. With Carter and Langford, the Rangers have two legitimate Rookie of the Year contenders, doubling their chances of earning an extra Draft pick at season’s end. On the pitching side, Pirates right-hander Jared Jones has probably been a bigger surprise in terms of potentially breaking camp with the big league team. With all of the excitement Paul Skenes has brought as the top pitching prospect in the game (as our [Pirates beat writer Alex Stumpf wrote recently](https://www.mlb.com/news/pirates-pitching-prospects-spring-training-discussion-2024?t=mlb-pipeline-coverage)), it’s Jones who might be the most big league-ready pitcher in the system. Our [No. 62 overall prospect](https://www.mlb.com/prospects/2024/top100/jared-jones-683003) made 16 appearances in Triple-A last year, but they were uneven. He’s made a transformation from thrower to pitcher ever since the Pirates took him in the second round of the 2020 Draft. He’s been touching triple digits with his fastball and missing bats with his slider and, most importantly, throwing more strikes. It’s still unclear who will grab the last two spots in Pittsburgh’s rotation, but Jones is doing his best to claim one of them. If Holliday had made the Opening Day roster -- his .326/.370/.628 slash line in 14 Grapefruit League games made a very strong case -- it would have been as a second baseman. Much of that has to do with personnel, of course, with 2023 AL Rookie of the Year Gunnar Henderson likely to get most of the time at Holliday’s natural position, not to mention Jorge Mateo, who played 110 games at short last year. Jordan Westburg, the O’s likely third baseman, could also get some reps there, though that doesn’t preclude Holliday from seeing some time at the premium spot upon his arrival as manager Brandon Hyde can move guys around as he sees fit. I think Holliday would be capable at shortstop long-term should he be needed there, but there has been a general feeling that his arm strength, while improved since he signed as the No. 1 pick in the 2022 Draft, would be better suited for second base. Given the Orioles have better options at short, I’ll say that Holliday settles in as an All-Star-caliber second baseman for the bulk of his career. And now on to some Draft talk. A quick primer on the term “floor.” When a player is perceived to have a high floor, there’s more certainty of him being a solid big leaguer, even if he lacks the “ceiling” of some to become an elite-level player. Sometimes players with high ceilings also come with high risk. Sure, they might become superstars, but they also might not make it at all. In other words, floor = more certainty. This year’s [Draft](https://www.mlb.com/prospects/2024/draft/), with its lean towards college hitters, has plenty of high floor choices at the plate. I think there’s an argument that could be made for two players: Oregon State’s Travis Bazzana and Georgia’s Charlie Condon. Bazzana, a second baseman, is off to a .461/.577/.934 start with eight homers in his first 19 games, while Condon has likely vaulted himself to the top of Draft boards with an absurd .521/.648/1.192 line, smashing 13 homers in 21 games. (Quick aside: If JJ Wetherholt at West Virginia can come back healthy, he could be in this conversation, too.) Both Condon and Bazzana have very high floors with outstanding hit tools; you might give Condon a slight edge in this debate because he has more power, while Bazzana has more speed. On the pitching side, it’s a little bit more up in the air. As the college season began, Wake Forest lefty Josh Hartle would have been the choice, but he’s really struggled so far this year, especially over his last two starts (12 ER in 5 1/3 IP). That said, it’s only five starts in, so there’s time for him to right the ship. For now, though, I’ll give the nod to Tennessee right-hander Drew Beam and his solid four-pitch mix and above-average command. He’s walked just 1.2 per nine and posted a 3.03 ERA in his five starts thus far for the Volunteers. This one is a no-brainer. I’m excited with what Chase Burns has been able to do this season in his first year at Wake Forest. Who wouldn’t like his 16.6 K/9 rate, 2.08 ERA and .157 opponents' average against? It’s exactly the step forward from his more uneven sophomore season at Tennessee that evaluators were hoping for. But comparing him to Paul Skenes, generally considered to be [the best pitching prospect we’ve seen](https://www.mlb.com/news/top-10-best-draft-pitching-prospects-ever?t=mlb-pipeline-coverage) since Stephen Strasburg, is unfair. Even with Burns’ improvements (and while he throws a lot of strikes), he doesn’t have the overall command Skenes had as the Draft approached. That’s particularly true in terms of fastball command, though again, Burns’ fastball and its characteristics have gotten better. Additionally, Skenes’ changeup was much better and the Wake Forest starter doesn’t use the pitch all that often. Burns has closed the gap, but Skenes still wins this debate pretty easily.",
