(KOLN) - The man found guilty in a drive-by shooting that damaged a north Lincoln home in 2023 is appealing his sentence.\nThe defense attorney for 25-year-old Talon Dennis filed an appeal in Lancaster County District Court on April 3, court documents show. He was sentenced just a day prior to 15-20 years in prison for attempted possession of a firearm by a prohibited person, a Class 2 Felony. He was given credit for 219 days served.\nDennis took a plea deal in February, pleading no contest to the charge. In exchange, prosecutors dropped one count of unlawfully and intentionally discharging a firearm and one count of use firearm to commit a felony.\nThe Lincoln Police Department Gang Unit and Fugitive Task Force arrested Dennis on Oct. 31, 2023, following an investigation into a drive-by shooting near 24th and Holdrege streets. A bullet traveled inside the home with four people sleeping inside and struck the drywall in the living area, according to police. No injuries were reported.\nPolice located a single 9mm casing was located near the intersection of 24th and Holdrege streets.\nDuring the investigation, officers learned that Dennis was openly talking about being on the run from law enforcement due to shooting up his ex-girlfriend’s house, court documents show. The reporting party claimed Dennis had a black handgun on his person during the interaction.\nDocuments show Dennis is a convicted felon and is prohibited from possessing a firearm.\nDennis was later arrested and lodged in the Lancaster County Jail.\nCopyright 2023 KOLN.

    "text": "Retired police officer shot dead at a mosque while he was praying in Jammu and Kashmir's Baramulla A retired Senior Superintendent of Police was shot dead by suspected militants at a mosque in Jammu Kashmir’s Baramulla district in early hours on Sunday. While police termed it a terror incident, it is learnt that they are investigating from all possible angles including possible rivalry. Police officers privy to the investigation said the postmortem revealed that the retired officer Mohammad Shafi Mir, was shot with a 12-bore rifle and had splinter injuries. “After finding that the weapon used to attack the retired officer was a 12-bore rifle, we are looking at all angles, including any possible rivalry,” they said. Earlier the day, Police said the retired officer, identified as Mohammad Shafi Mir, was fired upon at Gantmulla village on the Baramulla Uri highway while he was offering the call of prayers in the local mosque. He was shifted to a medical facility in Baramulla where doctors declared him dead on arrival. “Terrorists fired upon Shri Mohd Shafi, a retired police officer at Gantmulla, Sheeri #Baramulla, while praying Azan ( call for prayers) in the mosque and succumbed to injuries,” police said in a post on X. Soon after the attack, a joint team of forces cordoned off the area to trace the attackers. Sources said 71-year –old Mir had retired in 2012 and was living in the village. The incident took place in an area that has not seen any violence even during the heyday of militancy. “This area has always been peaceful and the killing has shocked everyone here,” said a local resident of Gantmulla. The locals said some of them heard a loud sound when the attack took place. “Mir sahib was giving Azan on the loudspeaker from a staircase of the mosque and was fired from behind. We heard a loud blast at that time,” said another local. \" He was regularly giving Azan at the mosque.\" A pall of gloom descended the entire village as the news of the killing spread in the area. The killing of the retired officer has been widely condemned. J&K Lt Governor, mainstream political parties and a Kashmiri separatist group condemned the killing.

I wrote about the upcoming fight over pistol stabilizing braces in [Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton Takes on the ATF Over Their Bizarre Pistol Brace Rule](https://redstate.com/wordpress/wp-admin/post.php?post=713991&action=edit): A pistol brace, also known as a stabilizing brace, is an accessory that attaches to the rear of the gun and allows the firearm, one that is technically a pistol, to be fired one-handed. These have been legal since their invention in 2010. However, on January 31, 2023, an ATF rule went into effect that classifies a pistol with a pistol brace as a “ [short-barreled rifle](SBR),” that is, a rifle with a barrel that is shorter than my…sorry, I meant to say 16 inches. The rule is complicated, but you have [a few options]: - Permanently remove or alter the brace so that it can’t be reattached - Add a barrel longer than 16 inches - Use an e-Form 1 or paper Form 1 to register it as an SBR - Turn it in to your local ATF office - Destroy the firearm Here are a couple of videos explaining what a pistol brace is and how to comply with it. Since writing that, the ATF has ruled that detaching the stabilizing brace is not sufficient to achieve compliance; the brace must be made inoperable or destroyed. The ATF director contradicted that guidance in testimony to Congress, but I wouldn’t count on using his testimony as a criminal defense. The latest [@ATFHQ]rule says the pistol brace must be destroyed, however, the Director of the ATF says it is enough to just separate the brace from the firearm.

Mock, Christopher Lewis, Maxim Defense Industries, LLC, and Firearms Policy Coalition, Inc. (FPC) have sued Defendants Attorney General Merrick Garland, in his official capacity, the United States Department of Justice, Director of ATF Steven Dettelbach, in his official capacity, and ATF. Individual Plaintiffs Mock and Lewis are Texas residents who own at least one braced pistol and would purchase others in the immediate future but for the Final Rule’s additional regulatory requirements. Maxim Defense is a firearms and firearms accessories manufacturer and retailer that specializes in stabilizing braces and braced pistols. The majority of Maxim Defense’ revenues are attributable to sales of products now subject to the Final Rule. FPC is a nonprofit organization that exists to defend and promote its members’ constitutional rights, advance individual liberty and restore freedom through political and legal advocacy and public education. FPC’s membership includes individual gun owners, licensed manufacturers and retailers, gun ranges, firearms trainers and educators, and others. Individual Plaintiffs and Maxim Defense are members of FPC. The District Court judge ruled against them, and they appealed.

    "title": "High Court rules same-sex adoption must be allowed, in landmark decision",
    "text": "In a landmark decision, the High Court of Justice ruled unanimously on Thursday that same-sex couples may adopt children under the terms of a 1981 adoption law.\nThe court re-interpreted the current law that, if read literally, excludes same-sex couples from adopting children, and asserted that the legislation’s true intent was to ensure the good of the adopted child.\nIn light of modern understandings of child welfare, the law could be interpreted as allowing for same-sex adoption, the court said.\nThe issue of same-sex adoption has been the subject of a long running political and legal battle in Israel, and Thursday’s ruling was warmly welcomed by LGBTQ rights groups as well as the Reform Movement in Israel, who’s legal arm led the challenges to the law.\nUltra-orthodox and hardline religious-Zionist MKs denounced the ruling, saying it undermined Jewish identity in Israel, was divisive and “hurts a large portion of the Jewish people.”\nThe 1981 law states that only “a man and his wife together” can adopt children. This has made it very difficult for same-sex couples to adopt, though they have been able to do so in some circumstances.\nIn its ruling, the court noted that it had dismissed a previous petition on the issue in 2017 because the government at the time had promised to amend existing law and annul the preference given to heterosexual couples for adopting children.\nActing Supreme Court President Uzi Vogelman pointed out in his written opinion that such legislation was never completed and that the state in its response to the current petition said there was no prospect for doing so.\nIn the ruling, Vogelman deployed the judicial doctrine of “interpretation” in order to re-read the 1981 law so as to understand the language as allowing two people in a committed relationship to adopt children, as opposed to a specifically heterosexual couple.\n“Though the language of clause 3 [of the child adoption law, 1981] is more consistent, on its face, with the interpretation according to which the phrase of ‘a man and his wife together’ refers to heterosexual couples, an interpretation according to which this section also includes same-sex couples does not go beyond the range of possible linguistic interpretations,” wrote Vogelman.\n“This is because examining the phrase in its full linguistic context shows that the language of the section creates a distinction between two general categories: those who belong to a family framework that includes two parents, versus those who seek to adopt into a single-parent family framework. That is, the focus of the section is that it is an adoption by a stable marital framework to which the child will be given, unlike an single [parent framework].”\nHe added that historical record showed that when the law was legislated the question of whether same-sex couples were fit to adopt was not considered. Vogelman wrote that the language of the law was devised by the Knesset to determine that it was for the benefit of the child up for adoption to be adopted into a two-parent family, and it was not aimed at making a determination regarding same-sex couples.\n“This is based on the concept that the marital relationship between parents is a condition for the creation of a family unit which can provide the child with stability and security, compared to a single-parent family unit,” he wrote.\nVogelman additionally asserted that professional opinions presented to the court demonstrated that the sexual preferences of parents has no bearing on a child’s welfare, meaning that adoption by a gay couple could be commensurate with the “objective purpose” of the law — the good of the child.\nJustices Alex Stein and Gila Canfy-Steinitz both concurred with Vogelman’s opinion.\nThe head of the Association for LGBTQ Equality in Israel Ran Shalhavi described the ruling as “an historic victory and a groundbreaking achievement” that demonstrated the High Court’s importance in protecting LGBTQ rights.\n“This day is an answer to homophobia, to hatred, to darkness, and to welfare ministers who for years denied us [the right to be] parents and rendered us second-class citizens,” said Shalhavi\nAttorney Riki Shapira of the Israel Religious Action Center which led the legal effort to enable same-sex couples to adopt over the years also celebrated the ruling and said it had been a long time coming.\n“For over seven years, we have fought for LGBTQ couples to enable them to realize their dreams to become a family through adoption. We welcome the ruling which accepted the position of the petitioners that there should be no discrimination between same-sex couples and other couples regarding adoption,” said Shapira.\nMK Avi Maoz, head of the explicitly anti-LGBTQ Noam party, denounced the decision.\n“Time after time, High Court justices prove how disconnected they are from the people. The High Court is tearing the nation apart and is choosing to deal with the most extreme points of dispute in Israeli society during a time of war,” he said.\n“The High Court will be enshrined in the pages of the history of the people of Israel and the State of Israel as the entity that most endangers the country’s Jewish identity,” he added.\nSenior United Torah Judaism MK Moshe Gafni also accused the court of “dividing the nation,” and said the ruling “hurts a large portion of the Jewish people,” and that his party would “find a way to fix it,” implying that UTJ may try and circumvent the ruling by passing new legislation.\n“The High Court is making every effort to divide the people, and who knows what else we can expect from them. The laundered words of the High Court judges cover up the indescribable damage [the ruling does] to the Jewish people for generations,” said Gafni.\nNever miss important Israel stories – get the free Times of Israel Daily Edition",
