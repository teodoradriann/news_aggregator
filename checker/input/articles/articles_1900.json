    "title": "After Refueling Mishap, KC-46 Drops ‘Portion’ of Its Boom",
    "text": "A KC-46A tanker from McConnell Air Force Base, Kan., suffered a mishap while refueling an F-15 Eagle on Aug. 21, prompting the crews on the Pegasus to declare an in-flight emergency for its boom, according to multiple statements released by units involved.\nNo one was injured during the incident, but the 931st Air Refueling Wing to which the KC-46 is assigned did say in a release that the aircraft landed with its boom down at Travis Air Force Base, Calif., and dropped a “portion” of the boom nearby the base.\nUnconfirmed photos claiming to show the KC-46 after it landed circulated on the unofficial “Air Force amn/nco/snco” Facebook page—in the photos, the boom appears to have broken in half , with exposed wires and pipes, and the exhaust cone of the tanker is badly damaged.\nThe 931st Air Refueling Wing could not confirm the pictures’ veracity.\nAn investigation is underway to find out the cause of the mishap and details of the damage to both the KC-46 and the F-15, the wing’s statement added. The wing wasn’t immediately available to provide further information on which unit the fighter belongs to or where it landed following the incident.\nThe Travis runway temporarily closed to allow personnel to respond to the aircraft and ensure the crew’s safety but has since resumed normal operations, the 60th Air Mobility Wing said in a separate statement.\n“Our Airmen are not only primed to respond at a moment’s notice, they are also capable of navigating and preventing further danger during an emergency,” Col. Cynthia Welch, 931st Air Refueling Wing commander, said in the statement. “The KC-46 continues to provide our Team McConnell aircrews with precise opportunities for air refueling, cargo and aeromedical supporting are partners here and worldwide.”\nWhile the cause of the mishap remains unclear, the tanker aircraft has been plagued by problems with its refueling system and suffered multiple refueling accidents over the years. This latest incident is the second mishap within two months involving the 931st; in June, one of the wing’s tankers was damaged while refueling a USAF F-16 in Dutch airspace. Audio from the aircraft described a refueling door damage on the fighter due to a “too close breakaway incident” between the two aircraft. An Airman aboard KC-46 then reported the tanker was also “damaged and unable to refuel.” The cause of the mishap is still under investigation.\nAnother midair refueling incident in 2022 left a Pegasus heavily damaged after it attempted to gas up an F-15. Unconfirmed photos posted on social media website following the accident showed a wrecked boom of the plane below its dented tail cone.\nThe Air Force and Boeing are currently working to resolve multiple Category I deficiencies to the KC-46’s refueling system, including a “stiff” boom and a faulty Remote Vision System (RVS), a setup of cameras and monitors the boom operator uses to connect the tanker to the refueling aircraft. The system washes out or blacks out in certain conditions, such as in direct sunlight. The RVS system can also cause issues with boom operator’s depth perception, which creates the risk of the boom operator accidentally hitting the aircraft the KC-46 is refueling.\nFixes for both the stiff boom and the Remote Vision System are still months, if not years, away. In the meantime, Travis is making the transition from the KC-10 to the KC-46—becoming the last base to say goodbye to the Extender.",

    "text": "“The document supports what I have been [saying](/item/36645-former-trustees-say-bullying-rampant-for-upholding-catholic-beliefs) all along: We are born male or female,” said Champagne. “God makes no mistakes.” The Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith condemned attacks on human dignity, including gender theory. It avowed in paragraph 57 of Dignitas Infinita that “desiring a personal self-determination, as gender theory prescribes, apart from this fundamental truth that human life is a gift, amounts to a concession to the age-old temptation to make oneself God, entering into competition with the true God of love revealed to us in the Gospel.” Another aspect of gender theory condemned is its intent to “deny the greatest possible difference that exists between living beings: sexual difference.” “This foundational difference is not only the greatest imaginable difference but is also the most beautiful and most powerful of them,” the document reads. “In the male-female couple, this difference achieves the most marvellous of reciprocities. It thus becomes the source of that miracle that never ceases to surprise us: the arrival of new human beings in the world.” “The trans movement is all about feelings,” Champagne explained. “It is not creational. It is a fleeting sensation. As you know, feelings can change from day to day. Feelings are connected to the imagination, which allows us to become whatever, wherever. Imagination isn’t grounded. It is connected to (identifiers), which are fully promoted in the schools, for example. The people who push the trans movement are not grounded. God gave us a grounding with male and female. That’s solid.” Champagne’s convictions are not in sync with the public positions of the Louis Riel School Division Board (LRSDB). At a June 2023 trustee meeting, she raised concerns about an LRSDB statement on X calling for library books that “allow all students and members of our divisional family to see themselves as valued and respected members of society, including the 2SLGBTQIA+ community.” In an earlier interview, she told The Catholic Register this topic had never been broached during previous board meetings. Neither she nor her colleagues presented their stance. Her inquiries were shut down by board chair Sandy Nemeth. Within weeks of challenging “the wide array of highly explicit material available within LRSD,” she was confronted over memes posted on social media that breached the board’s code of conduct statute that calls for trustees to “refrain from expressing opinions and/or sharing information through social media that would discredit, undermine or compromise the integrity of the board.” Standing up for her beliefs to the school board led to Champagne receiving three straight suspensions with no pay, threats of legal action and the loss of her teaching job at St. Boniface University. She resigned from her trustee role last November. Champagne will continue to speak out. She said she hopes the firm and unequivocal nature of the Vatican’s stance on gender theory instills similar confidence within Canadian Catholic bishops and priests. “I certainly hope they will bring this to light and educate the parishioners and community members,” said Champagne. “Be vocal and actually stand for the Biblical principles.”",
