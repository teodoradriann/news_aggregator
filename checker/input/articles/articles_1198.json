    "title": "Retail sales remain flat in February as poor weather hits food shopping - Jersey Evening Post",
    "text": "Retail sales volumes were flat in February as the fuel and food sectors saw declines, in part due to the bad weather, according to new data. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said sales growth hit 0.0% in February, down from growth of 3.6% in January, a figure which had been revised up by 0.2 percentage points. The ONS said a “mild but wet” month where southern England saw its wettest February on record had helped to weigh on sales. Food shops saw their sales drop by 0.3% during the month, with those who responded to the ONS survey blaming the weather for reducing the number of people visiting the shops. A fall in fuel sales, down 1.3%, was blamed on higher prices. These falls were enough to offset the rise in sales volumes at clothing and department stores, which were boosted by new collections. Meanwhile, the amount spent online, especially on clothes, rose 2.1% during the month, the largest single rise since July, when poor weather was also to thank. “Retail sales were flat in February,” said ONS senior statistician Heather Bovill. “There was growth in clothing, which rebounded after recent falls as people invested in the new season’s collections, as well as department stores. “However, these were offset by falls in fuel sales, possibly affected by rising prices, and a reduction in food sales. “Many shops told us that the wet weather hit in-store sales, with online instead seeing a boost.” Lisa Hooker, leader of industry for consumer markets at the PwC consultancy, said: “Little surprise that retail sales were unable to continue the momentum of the apparent bounceback witnessed in January’s numbers following a lacklustre Christmas.” She added: “Grocery sales slowed slightly from the previous month’s highs, as more people ventured back to eating and drinking out after Dry January. “Overall, February’s retail sales figures confirm that, despite falling inflation, a 2% cut in national insurance at the start of 2024, and improving consumer confidence in their personal finances, shoppers are still hesitant to part with their hard-earned cash. “With inflation forecast to fall to the Bank of England’s 2% target in April, in addition to a 9.8% rise in national living wage and a further 2% cut to national insurance, retailers will be hoping that the spring brings green shoots after a challenging last 18 months.”",

    "text": "Attorney General Jeff Jackson Visits Dream Center Academy in Gastonia, Highlights Importance of Education Funding\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\nTuesday, July 22, 2025\nEmail: bconroy@ncdoj.gov\nPhone: 984-383-9038\nDepartment of Education Froze Over $165 Million in NC Public Education Funding on June 30\nRALEIGH – Today, Attorney General Jeff Jackson visited Dream Center Academy (DCA) in Gastonia and met with students and teachers to highlight the importance of the more than $165 million in federal education funding at stake in North Carolina. On July 14, Attorney General Jackson sued the Department of Education to prevent the federal government from cutting funds for North Carolina’s schools.\n“Programs like Dream Center Academy show us why this funding is so important,” said Attorney General Jeff Jackson. “They’re using these federal funds to help students learn and grow and stay safe when they’re not in school. I’m glad to see that the federal government says it’s giving states back the funding it unlawfully froze for programs like Dream Center Academy, and I’ll keep fighting to make sure our state receives its full share.”\n“The 21st Century Community Learning Grant is critical to the funding of DCA, providing 50 percent of its budget. DCA survives on gifts, grants, and God,” said Dream Center Academy Board of Directors Chair Marty Starnes. “The Board is working diligently on fund development, but the loss of these funds would severely cripple this incredible program, altering the program so that it would not be close to what it is today. Without the 21st Century Community Learning Grant, DCA could potentially cease to exist.”\nDream Center Academy (DCA) is a community learning center that helps middle and high-school students pursue academic and professional development through after-school and summer programming. In 2024, 100 percent of Dream Center graduating high school students graduated college and career ready. The program currently serves 175 students and their families, offering job shadowing, enrichment clubs, college-career planning, service projects, and instruction in reading, STEM, and the arts.\nLast week, Attorney General Jackson sued the federal Department of Education for freezing nearly $7 billion in public education funding, including over $165 million for North Carolina, without warning. If these funds are eliminated, nearly 1,000 educators across the state could lose their jobs and rural school districts would be hit hard. Nine of the 10 school districts losing the most money per student are in rural North Carolina, and counties impacted by Hurricane Helene alone would lose roughly $18 million.\nAfter the lawsuit was filed, the Department of Education announced last week that a portion of the funding that supports 21st Century Community Learning Centers, including Dream Center Academy, will be returned to the states. That totals about $36 million in North Carolina, with approximately $130 million in funding still frozen.\n###",

    "text": "\nWomen priests with the Archbishop of Canterbury on the steps of St Paul’s Cathedral, marking the 20th anniversary of the admission of women to priest’s orders, in 2014\nWomen priests with the Archbishop of Canterbury on the steps of St Paul’s Cathedral, marking the 20th anniversary of the admission of women\nAS WE approach the 30th anniversary of the admission of women to priest’s orders, I still find it a surprise and a delight that the Church has embraced women’s ministry. We now have significant numbers of women priests, deacons, and bishops, as well as lay women in positions of authority.\nSo, I am not sympathetic to a fairly constant campaign (on grounds of continuing misogyny) for the ending of the arrangements by which there can still be no-go areas for women priests. I have clergy friends of that constituency, and I do not find them misogynistic. I have preached for them, wearing my stole priest-wise. I enjoy their hospitality and their company, and I genuinely want them to flourish. I also find that they are often more self-aware around women and more appreciative of their gifts than many of those who are apparently “affirming”.\nThere is misogyny in the Church, but it expressed in subtler ways. Years ago, when I was a deacon, I worked alongside a male priest who was given to bouts of irritation. His explosions raised a few eyebrows, but nobody minded much. Yet, I remember an incident in which I briefly lost my rag while preparing for a service, and I quickly discovered that women were not allowed to be angry: they are only acceptable if they are “nice”. I have also found that senior male priests often prefer to work with women who will not challenge them. And then there are the women who dislike women priests because they feel belittled by not having a (higher-status) male priest.\nAnd perhaps most dismaying are those who loudly support women, in the name of diversity and inclusivity, along with (of course) gays and trans people. But if, as a woman, you answer back, disagree, raise your voice, or apply your intelligence to asking forensic questions, all hell breaks loose, and you are labelled “vehement”, “strident”, “obstructive”.\nSo, two cheers for women in the Church, but we must continue to resist those who are simply uncomfortable with intelligent and capable women; those who prefer women clergy to be dog-collared accessories, endless supports to male pride, and comforters of male fear. There are quite a lot of women willing to play such parts because weak men cannot cope without them, and preferment for women can depend on successfully navigating the male ego. I have spent much of my ministry sitting on my rage about all this, occasionally expressing it, and then suffering for weeks from the guilt and grief of having upset someone.\nMisogyny remains the legacy of a catastrophic moral system that has plagued the Church since its inception, and is very far from the legacy of Jesus, who sparred with women without diminishing them, and relished their company as friends.\n12 Jan 2024\n18 Nov 2022\n11 Nov 2022\n20 Jan 2023\n08 Oct 2021\n02 Feb 2024\n23 Feb 2024\nLetters for publication should be sent to .\nLetters should be exclusive to the Church Times, and include a full postal address.

    "text": "(CNN) — With reports of the first human death from bird flu in the US, some Americans are feeling an uncomfortable flashback to the early days of Covid-19, when infectious disease experts were talking about a new virus that was sending people to the hospital with respiratory infections. Although both viruses can cause breathing problems, they are very different.\nCovid was spreading easily from person to person when it arrived in the US in 2020, but bird flu has been lurking for years, mostly as a problem for animals. Scientists also know a lot more about H5N1 bird flu than they did the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the US has been preparing for the threat of a new flu outbreak for a long time.\nStill, the virus is making moves that deserve attention. Here’s what you need to know about H5N1.\nWhat is bird flu? Avian influenza, or bird flu, is a broad term that refers to several types of influenza that normally infect birds. The bird flu that’s been making news in the United States is a virus called H5N1.\nSome flu viruses carried by birds cause only mild infections and are classified as low-pathogenic viruses. In contrast, H5N1 often kills birds that catch it, so it is classified as a highly pathogenic avian influenza.\nTo complicate matters, although bird flu viruses primarily prey on birds, they can also spread to other animals, including humans. Human infections with bird flu viruses are rare, and they’re usually what scientists call dead-end infections because they don’t typically transmit from person to person.\nIs H5N1 a new virus? You may have heard of H5N1 only recently, but it’s not a new virus. Scientists have been tracking it for almost three decades.\nIt was first identified in geese in Southern China in 1996. Over the years, it has caused sporadic outbreaks in wild and farmed birds around the globe.\nThe virus reappeared in North America in late 2021, and it quickly caught scientists’ attention because it seemed to have broadened its repertoire, spreading beyond birds and infecting a growing variety of mammals. In the current wave of infections, it has spread to more than 48 species in at least 26 countries .\nIt has caused mass die-offs of marine mammals too, including 24,000 sea lions that died in South America in 2023. In February 2024, Dr. Jeremy Farrar, who is chief scientist at the World Health Organization, called the ongoing spread of H5N1 “a pandemic of animals.”\nSince 2022, more than 130 million wild and farmed birds have been affected in America across all 50 states, 919 dairy herds have tested positive in 16 states, and 66 people have tested positive in 10 states, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Department of Agriculture.\nCould H5N1 become a new pandemic? Scientists agree that the virus would need to evolve – or retain key changes in its genetic sequence – to start a pandemic.\nEach time a virus infects a cell and copies itself, it makes mistakes. Usually, these mistakes are benign or even harmful for the virus, but occasionally, there’s a genetic change that helps the virus become better at infecting cells. Given the right set of circumstances, that version of the virus may outcompete others and continue to survive, going on to infect new hosts or new kinds of hosts.\nFlu viruses can change in another way, too\nEach virus has eight segments, and like kids in a lunch room, they are always looking to swap. When two viruses trade whole segments, it’s called a reassortment, and it result in quick and sometimes dramatic changes to a virus’ abilities.\nScientists say either type of change could spell trouble for humans. Although the H5N1 virus is very good at infecting birds and has become a threat for many different kinds of mammals, including dairy cows, it’s still pretty clumsy at infecting people.\nIn cows, for example, the H5N1 virus primarily infects the mammary glands. This causes a dramatic drop in milk production but usually doesn’t kill the cow. In people, the main route of infection seems to be through the eyes; conjunctivitis, or red, inflamed eyes, seems to be the telltale symptom of infection.\nScientists think H5N1 infects the eyes because flu viruses enter cells through sugars on their surface called sialic acids. Birds – and human eyes – primarily have alpha 2,3 sialic acid receptors on their cells. But a different kind of sialic acid receptor, alpha 2,6, is more prevalent in the human respiratory tract. Human flu viruses, including those that cause seasonal influenza, have evolved to infect cells through alpha 2,6 receptors.\nGiven enough time in the human body, the bird flu virus has shown the ability to change to become better at infecting different kinds of cells and tissues, spreading from the eyes to the respiratory tract, for example.\nResearchers detected key changes to the genome of the virus in teenager in Canada who became severely ill with H5N1 in November. Those changes probably helped it infect cells in her respiratory tract. Samples of the H5N1 virus that infected a severely ill patient in Louisiana also showed signs of adaptation to human cells. Infectious disease experts warn that as the virus continues to spread, it’s more likely that it changes to become a fully human pathogen.\nHow are people catching bird flu? When humans have become infected, it’s almost always through contact with infected animals. Nearly all of these so-called spillover infections have been mild. And no one who has gotten H5N1 in the US is known to have given the infection to anyone else.\nHow do we know it’s not spreading from person to person? Success!

    "title": "Gaza: Doctors Under Attack - Powerful Film Review",
    "text": "Gaza: Doctors Under Attack – A Harrowing Account of Medical Persecution Published: July 2, 2025\nThe Weight of Unseen Horrors The recently aired documentary, ‘Gaza: Doctors Under Attack,’ presents a deeply disturbing chronicle of violence against healthcare workers in Gaza.The film meticulously documents instances of targeting, arbitrary detention, and torture inflicted upon medical professionals – a pattern that, according to the World Health Association, has seen over 700 attacks on healthcare facilities and personnel in Gaza since October 2023. The sheer relentlessness of the documented suffering is profoundly affecting, and the images and testimonies are likely to remain with viewers long after the credits roll.\nThe film’s impact is unfortunately complex by the circumstances surrounding its initial creation and subsequent release. The core issue isn’t simply *what* the film shows, but *how* it reached the public.\nA Troubled Path to Broadcast Originally commissioned by the BBC, ‘gaza: Doctors Under Attack’ was shelved following controversy surrounding another documentary, ‘Gaza: How to Survive a War Zone.’ That earlier film sparked debate regarding the broadcaster’s commitment to impartiality. The decision to delay the broadcast of ‘Doctors Under Attack’ appeared, to many, as a direct consequence of this earlier dispute.\nThis delay is notably concerning given the urgency of the subject matter. The film’s revelations are not abstract concerns; they reflect a very real and ongoing crisis. As one medical professional featured in the documentary states, “The biggest, and possibly only, failure of Gaza: Doctors Under Attack is that the circumstances of its broadcast threaten to overshadow its content.” This sentiment underscores the frustration that the film’s vital message could be lost amidst the political maneuvering surrounding its release.\nSystematic Targeting and the Erosion of Humanitarian Principles The documentary doesn’t merely present isolated incidents; it builds a compelling case for the systematic targeting of Gaza’s medical infrastructure. The film details how hospitals have been repeatedly struck,ambulances obstructed,and doctors and nurses subjected to intimidation,arrest,and physical abuse. This isn’t simply collateral damage; the evidence suggests a deliberate attempt to cripple the healthcare system, effectively punishing the civilian population. The situation echoes ancient instances of medical facilities being deliberately targeted during conflicts, such as the bombing of hospitals during the Bosnian War, highlighting a disturbing pattern of disregard for international humanitarian law.\n“The film the BBC refused to air shows the targeting, detainment and torture of medics in Gaza. Its relentless timeline of horrors will never leave you.”\nDocumentary description\nThe film’s power lies in its unflinching portrayal of these abuses. It doesn’t shy away from showing the brutal realities faced by those attempting to provide care in a war zone. The testimonies of doctors, nurses, and patients are particularly harrowing, offering a deeply personal and emotional account of the crisis. The film’s impact is amplified by the fact that, according to Amnesty International, over 200 medical workers have been killed in Gaza as the start of the current conflict.\nA Crucial, Though Challenging, Viewing Experience Ultimately, ‘Gaza: Doctors Under Attack’ is a profoundly important film. While its journey to the screen has been fraught with controversy, its content demands attention. It serves as a stark reminder of the human cost of conflict and the urgent need to protect healthcare workers and facilities in war zones. As one reviewer noted, the film is “the stuff of nightmares,” but it is precisely this unflinching honesty that makes it so vital.\nThe film’s airing on Channel 4 provides a platform for these crucial stories to be heard, even if the initial intent was elsewhere.\nContinue reading…",
