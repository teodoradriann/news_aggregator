    "title": "Growing Classrooms: How Murfreesboro City Schools Adapt to Expansion",
    "text": "MURFREESBORO, Tenn. - As Murfreesboro continues to expand in population, so does the need for classroom space. WGNS spoke to Lisa Trail, Director of Communications for the City Schools, and asked if any new schools are on the drawing board…1 Adding onto existing schools allows the city operated system to grow more efficiently.\nSeven years ago, the city added 7 new classrooms to Blackfox Elementary School, which is a school that has seen high enrollment numbers this year…\nCurrently, enrollment increases are not high enough to build a new standalone school within the City Schools system. However, officials are closely monitoring population trends and the development of new neighborhoods. As new homes are constructed, families tend to move in quickly, potentially impacting school enrollment and capacity…\nIn 2019, the city opened Salem Elementary School near the intersection of Veterans Parkway and St. Andrews Drive. The new school became the 13th facility operated by the Murfreesboro City Schools District. Currently, the district serves over 9,340 students and employs approximately 800 certified staff members. Like the Rutherford County School System, the City Schools accommodate a diverse group of children each year, with over 30 languages spoken in classrooms across Murfreesboro.\nAPPLY: On a side note, now is the time for parents to submit applications for their child to attend the Discovery School, an academic magnet school for high-achieving and gifted students. With only 60 spots available, the deadline to submit applications is open now through January 31, 2025. The applications are for the 2025-2026 school year. For more details, visit the Discovery School HERE.\nLISTEN: Hear our latest interview with the Murfreesboro City Schools HERE.",

    "text": "香港電台-港聞 消防引入電動車滅火救援工具 籲切勿嘗試自行撲滅電動車火警 閱讀整篇文章 香港電台-港聞 2025年3月5日 下午3:46\n消防處 表示，去年發生48宗涉及 電動車 的交通意外及火警，較前年增加92%。處方指出，電動車一旦起火，鋰電池在高溫下可能會導致「熱失控」，火勢急速蔓延，甚至有爆炸風險，消防處各分區已引入電動車滅火救援工具，呼籲駕駛者切勿嘗試自行撲滅電動車火警。 消防處災難應變救援隊助理消防區長文家平表示，灌救電動車火警較傳統汽油車複雜，因為鋰電池一般安裝在車底，有堅固外殼包圍，如果單靠傳統方法在外圍射水，只能間接滅火，成效較低。根據國際研究，有機會要花4小時救援，以及用接近15萬公升水才可冷卻電池。 針對電動車意外增加，消防處添置相關工具包括電動車應急插頭、電動車滅火氈和電池滅火系統等。從訓練及近期行動統計，消防人員只需平均用2小時和大約1萬5千公升水已可令鋰電池穩定。 文家平呼籲，駕駛者若發現車輛電池系統發出警示信號，或車輛產生異常氣味或煙霧，應立即停車及撤離車輛，視乎當時情況聯絡維修人員或報警，等待消防人員到場處理，即使附近有水源也不建議自行救火，因為鋰電池著火釋出的氣體和火焰可以十分危險。",

Según han informado fuentes municipales, el incidente ha ocurrido sobre las siete de la tarde, en hora punta de la noria de 32 metros de altura, que tenía ocupadas todas sus cabinas. Los responsables de la misma han intentado arreglar la avería durante una hora, sin éxito. Transcurrido ese tiempo han avisado a los bomberos, quienes tras comprobar que tampoco se podía reanudar la marcha de la instalación, han decidido ir rescatando poco a poco, mediante dos escalas, a todos los usuarios atrapados. Sobre las 21.00 horas, los bomberos habían rescatado ya a personal que ocupaba diez cabinas de las 24, y seguían desalojando a más clientes, que se encuentran \"tranquilos\", sin que se hayan producido daños personales.",

    "text": "A former Alaska State Trooper [found guilty ](https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/crime-courts/2023/03/24/former-alaska-state-trooper-found-guilty-of-attempted-sexual-abuse-of-a-minor/)of attempted sexual abuse of a minor earlier this year was sentenced this week to serve four years in prison, state officials say. Superior Court Judge Andrew Peterson on Wednesday sentenced 63-year-old Vance Peronto to eight years with four years suspended for his conviction on one count of second-degree attempted sexual abuse of a minor, according to a statement from the Alaska Department of Law. The case stemmed from a [2018 incident ](https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/crime-courts/2018/04/30/alaska-state-trooper-arrested-in-anchorage-for-attempted-sexual-abuse-of-a-minor/)in which Peronto showed up to what he thought was an Anchorage hotel date to meet with a 16-year-old girl, according to charges filed in the case that year. Peronto was a 16-year veteran of the troopers when he first met the teenager after he pulled her over for driving without headlights on the Kenai Peninsula. The “date” was actually arranged by a troopers investigator after the girl’s father contacted authorities. Peronto arrived at the hotel in his patrol car and was arrested by troopers assisted by members of the Anchorage Police Department SWAT team, troopers said at the time. During Peronto’s sentencing hearing in Anchorage Superior Court this week, prosecutors asked for the sentence Peterson ultimately handed down, arguing in part that members of law enforcement needed to be held accountable, according to the statement from the law department. Peronto asked for either a probationary sentence or a sentence of two years to serve, the law department said. Peronto will be on probation for seven years after serving his sentence and must register as a sex offender for 15 years following his release from probation supervision, according to the Department of Law. He was in custody at Cook Inlet Pretrial Facility as of Thursday.",

The children are the focal point, the children are the voices and sometimes at many tables, their perspectives are not there,\" said Freedom Scholars Executive Director Jeremy Smith. \"So at Freedom Schools, we always make sure that that perspective is always to the forefront, especially when it comes to civil responsibility.\"\nThe event also featured original student work, including poetry, songs, and speeches focused on the themes of self-discovery, banned books, and educational access.\n___",

    "text": "New Delhi: The Delhi High Court on Friday refused to permit prayers at the recently demolished 'Akhoondji mosque' and the nearby graveyard in Mehrauli on the occasion of Shab-e-Barat.\nMuslims seek forgiveness from Allah for their sins and those of their ancestors on Shab-e-Barat (the night of atonement).\nJustice Purushaindra Kumar Kaurav, while dealing with an application by the Managing Committee of the Delhi Waqf Board, noted that the court has directed status quo on the site which is now in the possession of the Delhi Development Authority (DDA).\nThe application forms part of a petition by the committee on the issue of demolition.\nJustice Kaurav observed that the main petition, which was heard by the court on several occasions, is already listed for final disposal on March 7.\n\"At this stage, the court is not inclined to pass any directions. The application is dismissed,\" ordered the court.\nThe 'Akhoondji mosque', believed to be over 600 years old, as well as the Behrul Uloom madrasa there were declared as illegal structures in Sanjay Van and demolished by the DDA on January 30.\nThe counsel for the petitioner said worshippers, whose families are buried in the nearby graveyard, should be allowed offer prayers there on the occasion of Shab-e-Barat later this month.\nHe said the mosque was several centuries old and prayers were being offered there for the last many years. There was also an 'active graveyard' which was used by the locals, the advocate told the court.\nOn February 5, the high court had asked the DDA to maintain status quo on the site where the mosque once stood.\nThe petitioner committee has argued that the demolition of the mosque was illegal.\nThe DDA has defended its action before the high court on the ground that the demolition took place pursuant to the January 4 recommendation of its Religious Committee. The decision, it said, was taken after the Religious Committee afforded an opportunity of hearing to the CEO of Delhi Waqf Board. The petitioner has, however, contended that the Religious Committee has no jurisdiction to order any demolition action.\nOn January 31, the court asked the DDA to file its reply clearly setting out the action that has been taken in respect of the property concerned as well as its basis.\nIt also asked the development authority to state whether any prior notice was given before the demolition.\n 23 February 2024, 10:39 IST)",
