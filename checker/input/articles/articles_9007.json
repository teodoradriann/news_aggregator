[Amaris Encinas](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/5133245001/amaris-encinas/) The upcoming year will be filled with blessings, at least that is what the numerical sequence of this New Year’s Eve date suggests. If you take a closer look at the date, written as 12/31/23 or even 123123, you might see an angel number, which are [repeating number sequence](/story/life/2022/11/06/what-are-angel-numbers-meanings-numerology/10525252002/)s, often used as a guide for deeper spiritual exploration.

One, that asks us to “transform and evolve with the times and in the right place to embrace what is coming to us,” [according to the Old Farmer’s Almanac website. ](https://www.almanac.com/123123-meaning-123123) The date has also sparked an online trend, with TikTok users creating videos on the significance of the number and merchandise commemorating the date selling online, including on platforms like [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=123123&ref=cs_503_search), [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2332490.m570.l1313&_nkw=123123&_sacat=0) and [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/market/123123?ref=seller_tag_bottom_image-1), the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA Today Network [reported.](/story/news/local/michigan/2023/12/27/angel-number-meaning-123123-last-day-year-numerology/72001298007/) Here’s what we know about the date. What does 12/31/23 signify within numerology? [Numerology is an ancient esoteric science](https://www.britannica.com/topic/numerology) that deals with numbers and letters and the energy, intention and vibration behind them, professional numerologist [Novalee Wilder](https://www.novaleewilder.com/) shared with USA Today earlier this month. \"Before there was even language, there were numbers,\" she said. \"Before we had named things, we had counted them, and we had assigned meaning to that count.\" The numbers that make up the angel number are just as important as the whole number, especially when you are trying to determine the vibration and intention behind the number. Professional astrologer [Narayana Montúfar](https://www.naramon.com/) told [ Farmer’s Almanac ](https://www.almanac.com/123123-meaning-123123) that the “Number 1 brings the very spark of initiation, 2 focuses on building, and 3 is related to the concept of creation. Together, the sequence of these three numbers speaks of the spark of initiation that seeks to build a new creation.” If you add all the numbers that make up the date 123123 together, you will come up with 12. The number 12 in numerology can symbolize spiritual enlightenment, with potential for the day to deliver epiphanies and “aha” moments for individuals and society at large, the website stated.

    "text": "Bangkok, 5 July 2024 — The Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) is staging the “Amazing Beach Life Festival” between this month and next in Rayong, Phang-Nga, Phuket, and Songkhla, a campaign to boost tourism during Thailand’s green season . D r. Phonpoom Vipattipumiprates, Vice Minister of Tourism and Sports, said “The project shines a spotlight on the government’s ‘Ignite Tourism Thailand’ vision to make Thailand a tourism hub and a centre of world-class events. The goal is to achieve 3.5 trillion Baht in tourism revenue target for this year and much more in the coming years.”\nTAT has initiated the “Amazing Beach Life Festival” project in a lineup of ‘big events’ scheduled for the last half of this year to boost the appeal of Thailand’s green season.\nRayong, Phang-Nga, Phuket, and Songkhla have been chosen as host venues due to their well-established position as tourist destinations.\nMr. Apichai Chatchalermkit, TAT Deputy Governor of Tourism Products and Business said. “The event is intended to stimulate more travel among foreign and Thai tourists with high purchasing power and special interests in beach vibes and beach life. This will help spread tourism benefits across local communities in the four beach resort destinations and nearby attractions during the off-season.”\nThe event will kick off at Laem Charoen Beach in Rayong from 12-14 July, followed by the second edition in Phang-Nga from 26-28 July. The third edition is scheduled for 2-4 August at Patong Beach in Phuket, and the fourth and final edition will be held from 9-11 August at Chalatat Beach in Songkhla.\nActivities include water sports such as Sup-Board Surfskate, music concerts by famous Thai artists, performances by Thailand’s top DJs, beach party tattoos, DIY workshops such as beach paintings on wooden trays and key chains. Other activities include a fair for local art and craft products, food truck, beach bar and fashion items.\nEach host venue’s distinctive character will be showcased via installation arts and inflatable landmarks.\nThe event will reiterate the TAT’s drive towards more sustainable and responsible tourism. This includes eco-friendly venue decorations and a Thailand Tourism Awards booth presenting award-winning sustainable tourism businesses.\nTAT is also cooperating with Global Chemical (PTTGC) on waste management.\nMr. Chaya Chandavasu, Executive Vice President, Sustainability, PTT Global Chemical Public Company Limited (GC) , said “We will install our ‘YOUTURN Platform’ at the event to promote responsible tourism by encouraging tourists to participate in the waste management process. Visitors can also join our DIY activities, such as turning their plastic waste into a key chain or beads. They can also shop for sustainable fashion items made with ‘Revife Fiber by GC UPCYCLING’ at UPTOYOU, our clothing brand.”\nEntry to the Amazing Beach Life Festival is free.
