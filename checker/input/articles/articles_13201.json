    "text": "Update: January 8, 10:41 a.m . ET : Vulcan Centaur took off right on schedule, successfully blasting off from the Cape Canaveral launch pad and delivering Peregrine on its historic mission to the Moon.\nWatch China's Plan to Land Astronauts on the Moon\n China's Plan to Land Astronauts on the Moon Thursday 11:39AM Are\nOriginal article follows.\nAstrobotic’s Peregrine is gearing up for a chance to land on the Moon, hoping to become the first commercial lunar lander to touchdown on the dusty surface of the celestial body and pave the way for other private ventures to follow.\nAdvertisement The lunar lander will ride on board , which is scheduled for liftoff on Monday, January 8, at 2:18 a.m. ET from Cape Canaveral, Florida. The historic launch will be broadcast live on NASA Television , the NASA app , and the space agency’s website, and you can also tune in through the feed below. The live feed is set to begin at 1:30 a.m. ET.\nAs part of NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative and its Artemis program, Astrobotic’s Peregrine lunar lander is packed with government and privately-owned payloads including a host of scientific instruments belonging to the space agency. NASA’s payloads on board Peregrine include the Laser Retro-Reflector Array (LRA), which uses laser beams to accurately measure the distance between the Moon and Earth, and the Linear Energy Transfer Spectrometer (LETS), which measures radiation at the lunar surface for astronaut safety during future missions.\nAdvertisement The upcoming mission is meant to help NASA in its quest to return humans to the Moon, and make it a sustainable place for long-term human presence. It also ushers in a new era whereby private companies create greater access to deep space destinations, providing means for government and commercial customers to deliver payloads to the Moon. Other payloads include a swarm of tiny robots from Mexico, a time capsule from Carnegie Mellon that includes images, poems, music pieces, as well as the cremated ashes and DNA of loved ones for two space memorial companies.\nAdvertisement Peregrine is scheduled for its lunar touchdown in late February, but landing on the Moon is no easy feat. So far, only NASA, Russia, and China have successfully landed on the Moon. Attempts by other nations have not ended well; Israel’s Beresheet crashed onto the Moon’s surface in April 2019, while India’s Vikram spacecraft did the same that September 2023. In April 2023, Japan’s ispace was also hoping to become the first private company to land on the Moon, but its Hakuto-R lander crashed on the surface.\nAdvertisement The lander is aiming for a soft landing at the Moon’s Gruithuisen Domes—a cluster of volcanic formations in the Sinus Viscositatis region (meaning “Bay of Stickiness”).\nFor 2 comments",

    "text": "Keir Starmer has hailed the “reigniting” of Britain’s industrial heartlands after the launch of carbon capture clusters in the north of England as part of the UK’s net zero drive.\nThe technology, which captures carbon dioxide emissions before they reach the atmosphere, will be deployed at scale Teesside and Merseyside – and is expected to support thousands of jobs and bring in £8 billion of private investment.\nIt comes as Britain became the first major economy to stop using coal to generate electricity earlier this week.\nThe Prime Minister said: “We’re reigniting our industrial heartlands by investing in the industry of the future. For the past 14 years, business has been second-guessing a dysfunctional government – which has set us back and caused an economic slump.\n“Today’s announcement will give industry the certainty it needs – committing to 25 years of funding in this groundbreaking technology – to help deliver jobs, kickstart growth, and repair this country once and for all.”\nRecap on all of the news and debate from party conference 2024 by LabourList here.\nThe new project announced today is expected to create 4,000 new jobs and remove more than 8.5 million tonnes of carbon emissions per year.\nThe Prime Minister, Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Energy Secretary Ed Miliband are set to visit the north west today to confirm the funding for the two sites.\nMiliband said: “On Monday, 150 years of coal in this country came to an end. Today, a new era begins. By securing this investment, we pave the way for securing the clean energy revolution that will rebuild Britain’s industrial heartlands.”\nReeves added: “This game-changing technology will bring 4,000 good jobs and billions of private investment into communities across Merseyside and Teesside, igniting growth in these industrial heartlands and powering up the rest of the country.\n“Working in partnership with business is at the heart of our plan to deliver strong growth and investment, so we can rebuild Britain and make everyone better off.”\nGMB general secretary Gary Smith has welcomed the move and said: “This is a serious step in the right direction and a welcome investment in jobs and industries after years of neglect under the previous administration.\n“GMB has long called for this technology to be supported: it’s great to see these calls being answered.\n“Today’s announcement shows what levelling up can really mean: good, well paid jobs reinvigorating communities.\n“If this positive news is followed by a quick decision to support Sizewell C, it shows that we finally have a Government with a serious industrial strategy that will rebuild our nation’s infrastructure after fourteen wasted years.”\nSHARE: If you have anything to share that we should be looking into or publishing about this story – or any other topic involving Labour– contact us (strictly anonymously if you wish) at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).\nSUBSCRIBE: Sign up to LabourList’s morning email here for the best briefing on everything Labour, every weekday morning.\nDONATE: If you value our work, please donate to become one of our supporters here and help sustain and expand our coverage.\nPARTNER: If you or your organisation might be interested in partnering with us on sponsored events or content, email [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).\nMore from LabourList\n[News](/category/news)\nUK strikes deal to transfer sovereignty of Chagos Islands to Mauritius\n[News](/category/news)\nScrapping two-child benefit cap ‘not a silver bullet’, think tank says\n[general election 2024](/category/general-election-2024-comment)",

    "title": "Cidade do Rio de Janeiro decreta ponto facultativo por previsão de chuva forte",
    "text": "A prefeitura do Rio de Janeiro decretou ponto facultativo nesta sexta-feira (22) devido à previsão de fortes chuvas até a tarde de sábado (23) na cidade. A medida, publicada em edição especial do Diário Oficial do Município na noite de ontem (21), contempla servidores de áreas administrativas não essenciais e escolas municipais. O objetivo é reduzir a circulação de pessoas na capital fluminense. A previsão, segundo a prefeitura, é de pancadas de chuva moderada a muito forte, acompanhada de raios e rajadas de ventos de até 75,9 quilômetros por hora (km/h). Estima-se precipitação que pode chegar a 200 milímetros em 24 horas. Isso significa que existe a possibilidade de chover 200 litros por metro quadrado. A média de março é de 124,7 mm durante o mês. O prefeito Eduardo Paes também orienta que escolas particulares e outras empresas privadas suspendam serviços não essenciais hoje. “É ideal termos a cidade esvaziada”, afirmou Paes, em nota à imprensa. “É provável que a chuva comece ao longo da tarde. E, nesse momento, seria importante termos pouco movimento na cidade”. O governo do estado já tinha anunciado ponto facultativo em suas repartições e orientado as prefeituras fluminenses a adotar a mesma medida. Algumas escolas particulares da cidade enviaram comunicados às famílias de estudantes informando que vão se manter abertas, mas que não haverá prejuízo pedagógico caso os alunos decidam se ausentar. Instituições públicas de ensino superior, como a Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), a Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio (UniRio) e o Centro Federal de Educação Tecnológica (Cefet/RJ) suspenderam aulas presenciais. A Universidade do Estado do Rio (Uerj) decretou ponto facultativo. Além do ponto facultativo, a prefeitura se mantém em estágio 2 (em uma escala de 1 a 5, em ordem crescente de gravidade), com mais de 9 mil servidores atuando na cidade, com equipes da Comlurb, das secretarias de Conservação e de Ordem Pública, do Centro de Operações Rio, da Rio Águas, da Defesa Civil, do Sistema Alerta Rio, da Fundação Georio, da Guarda Municipal e da CET-Rio.",

    "text": "News Link •\n[Soros News](/Subjects/00588-LAST-soros-news.htm)\n• https://www.zerohedge.com, by Tyler Durden\n<a href=\"https://www.zerohedge.com/political/el-salvadors-bukele-blasts-soros-cpac\">El Salvador's Bukele Slams Soros At CPAC\n</a>\nIn a fiery address at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), Bukele - who won re-election by a staggering 84% of the vote, said of Globalism: \"It's already dead,\" adding that in America \"dark forces are taking over your country.\"\nHe said that the reason El Salvador ended up becoming the \"murder capital of the world\" was that the people were not equipped to understand just how radically their society was changing because it happened over a period of decades, one increment at a time.\nBukele likened this to boiling a frog, saying that if you keep turning up the heat and slowly boil the frog, it won't realize what is happening until it is too late. The Latin American president urged Americans not to despair, however, as \"you can still jump before the water boils.\" -\nLifesite\nBukele later explained that in El Salvador, a 12-year-long communist-inspired civil war broke out, and that he can \"clear see the signs of a declining\" country when he looks at America.\n\"They were setting the gang members free,\" he said of his home country, adding that in order to clean up El Salvador he had to remove \"corrupt judges, corrupt attorneys and corrupt prosecutors.\"\nHe singled out Baltimore, where \"crime and drugs have become the daily norm,\" and asked the crowd if they could have imagined the fentanyl epidemic 10 year ago.\nShots at Soros\nBukele then too aim at globalist billionaire George Soros, who has funded a nationwide campaign to install soft-on-crime District Attorneys in major US cities.\n\"Who elected [George] Soros to dictate public policy and laws? Why does he feel entitled to impose his agenda?\" he said. \"Soros and his cronies hit a brick wall in El Salvador.\"\n\"Thank God and all glory be to Him, El Salvadorians are now immune to his influence,\" he continued.",

Con el objetivo de reducir la huella ecológica, la empresa suiza está disminuyendo las emisiones de CO2 en la fabricación de sus productos hasta en un 68% gracias a este cambio, apoyando también a sus clientes en el cumplimiento de sus objetivos de sostenibilidad.\nComo distribuidor, Rutronik ofrece a compradores y desarrolladores una opción sencilla para cambiar diseños existentes o nuevos a productos sostenibles. Los componentes “verdes” logran los mismos resultados en términos de rendimiento y vida útil que los componentes fabricados con plásticos a base de petróleo. Los conectores Green Line son particularmente adecuados para su uso en tecnología médica, en la industria o en electrodomésticos de consumo. Los conectores IEC de la línea Green Line están disponibles en\nwww.rutronik24.com.\nLos conectores destacan por su rendimiento y vida útil, pero están hechos de material 100 % biodegradable, la semilla de ricino. Dado que esta planta crece como cultivo en barbecho en zonas semiáridas (secas), no compite con el cultivo de alimentos. Los componentes son neutros en carbono durante todo su ciclo de vida y, según el fabricante, las emisiones de CO2 durante la producción se reducen hasta en un 68 % en comparación con el uso de plásticos convencionales a base de fósiles.\nEl uso de componentes de la línea Green Line ayuda a alcanzar objetivos de sostenibilidad y clima y reduce la dependencia de plásticos fósiles.\nBeneficios:\n- Mismo rendimiento y vida útil que los conectores convencionales.\n- Reducción de las emisiones de CO2 hasta en un 68 %.\n- Apoya el logro de los objetivos de sostenibilidad de los clientes.\n- No compite con el cultivo de alimentos.\nEjemplos de aplicación:\n- Industria.\n- Tecnología médica.\n- Electrodomésticos de consumo.",

    "title": "途昂Pro首搭五代EA888，燃油车的反击战？-车市号",
    "text": "Driver 来了\n6809 2025-03-13\n在新能源汽车高歌猛进的当下，燃油车似乎逐渐被边缘化。然而，上汽大众却在此时推出了搭载第五代EA888发动机的途昂Pro，大有“挽狂澜于既倒，扶大厦之将倾”的气势，试图为燃油车市场注入一针强心剂。那么，这款车到底实力如何呢？今天，咱们就来深入剖析一下。\n外观：硬朗大气，细节升级\n途昂Pro延续了大众家族式设计语言，整体造型硬朗大气，车身线条流畅且富有力量感，展现出中大型SUV该有的魁梧与霸气。前脸部分，大尺寸进气格栅搭配犀利的LED大灯，营造出强烈的视觉冲击力。值得一提的是，此次新车还采用了封闭式格栅设计，搭配贯穿式灯带，不仅增添了科技感，还隐隐有种新能源车的既视感，紧跟当下潮流趋势。\n车身侧面，线条简洁利落，21英寸大轮毂进一步提升了整车的气场，搭配与车身齐平的隐藏式门把手，不仅让车身侧面看起来更加简洁流畅，还能有效降低风阻。车长超5.1米，轴距接近3米，相比老款车型，长度增加106mm，宽度增加2mm，高度增加15mm，虽然轴距不变，但整体尺寸的加大让其在气势上更胜一筹。\n车尾部分，贯穿式尾灯设计是一大亮点，点亮后辨识度极高，同时也拉伸了车尾的视觉宽度。下方的双边共两出式排气布局，虽然取消了，但取而代之的贯穿式反光条以及后保险杠的银色装饰或黑色网格设计（根据不同版本），让车尾看起来更加精致且富有层次感。\n内饰：豪华与科技的完美融合\n坐进车内，途昂Pro的内饰设计让人眼前一亮。大面积的翻毛皮材质搭配蓝色装饰条和银色饰板，营造出豪华且不失运动感的车内氛围。中控台采用了简洁大方的设计风格，悬浮式中控屏尺寸达到15英寸，显示清晰，操作流畅，车机系统支持CarPlay、CarLife等互联功能，并且UI界面经过优化，使用起来更加便捷顺手 。\n全液晶仪表盘、电子怀挡式换挡机构的加入，进一步提升了车内的科技感。此外，车内还搭载了L2级别的智能驾驶辅助系统，包括自适应巡航、车道保持、盲区监测等功能，为驾驶者提供更加轻松、安全的驾驶体验。\n座椅方面，途昂Pro配备有12向电动主/副驾座椅可调，主驾座椅支持3档记忆功能。前排座椅可3档通风调节/3档加热调节以及具有多种按摩模式，让驾乘者在长途旅行中也能享受到舒适的体验。第二排空间宽敞，乘坐舒适性媲美豪华品牌，第三排座椅也能满足成年人的短途乘坐需求，并且三排座椅具备电动翻折功能，放倒后可形成超大的储物空间，实用性拉满。\n动力：全新EA888，性能与油耗的平衡\n途昂Pro最大的亮点之一，便是其搭载的第五代EA888 2.0T发动机，这款发动机堪称燃油动力技术的集大成者。最大功率可达200kW（272马力） ，相比第三代EA888高功率版提升14.3%；峰值扭矩400N·m ，提升23.5%，零百加速时间仅为7.6秒，动力强劲，加速迅猛，一脚油门下去，推背感十足，无论是城市道路的超车并线，还是高速上的驰骋，都能轻松应对。\n在燃油经济性方面，得益于500bar超高压燃油直喷技术、可变进气截面（VTG）增压器以及全工况米勒循环等先进技术，途昂Pro的WLTC工况油耗降低至8.35L/100km，在同级别燃油车中表现相当出色。同时，这款发动机还满足欧7法规的清洁尾气排放，远低于国6排放标准，环保性能也不容小觑。为了确保发动机的稳定性，大众进行了2.5万小时的台架测试、50周极端路况试验以及600万公里的整车测试，可靠性完全不用担心。\n与之匹配的是DQ501 7速湿式双离合变速箱，传动效率高，换挡平顺。此外，新车还配备了4 Motion智能四驱系统和新一代DCC自适应电子悬架，面对复杂路况也能轻松驾驭，并且能够根据不同的驾驶模式自动调整发动机、变速箱、转向系统等设置，为驾驶者带来更加多样化的驾驶体验。\n市场竞争：挑战与机遇并存\n在中大型SUV市场，途昂Pro面临着诸多竞争对手，如丰田汉兰达、本田冠道、长安福特探险者、东风日产探陆等传统燃油车，以及理想L6、问界M7等新能源车型。\n与这些竞品相比，途昂Pro在动力和空间方面具有一定优势。动力上，它的2.0T发动机动力输出强劲，相比部分竞品数据更亮眼；空间方面，其车身尺寸较大，车内空间宽敞，尤其是第二排和第三排的乘坐空间，在同级别车型中表现较为出色。然而，在新能源车型崛起的当下，途昂Pro作为燃油车，在油耗和智能化方面可能稍显逊色。不过，随着新能源汽车补贴的退坡以及充电基础设施不完善等问题的逐渐凸显，燃油车在续航和加油便利性上的优势又重新被放大，这也为途昂Pro提供了一定的市场机会。\n大众途昂Pro凭借着全新的外观设计、豪华科技的内饰、强劲且高效的动力系统，展现出了强大的产品力。它不仅是大众品牌在燃油车领域的一次技术革新，更是对当下新能源汽车浪潮的有力回应。如果你是一位追求大空间、强动力、低油耗，同时又对燃油车情有独钟的消费者，那么途昂Pro绝对值得你去关注和试驾。它或许将成为你未来出行的最佳伙伴，开启一段别样的驾驶之旅。\n声明：本文由车市号作者撰写，仅代表个人观点，不代表网上车市。文中部分图片来源网络，感谢原作者。\n竟然没评论，快去评论~~\n指导价： 26.9-39.5万",
