    "title": "Letter to French Embassy demands Haitian reparations - Trinidad and Tobago Newsday",
    "text": "A letter demanding France pay reparations and restitution to embattled Haiti will be delivered to the French Embassy at its Mary Street, Port of Spain, office on April 17 at 10 am.\nThis is a part of a wider campaign by the regional executive committee of The Assembly of Caribbean People of which politician David Abdulah is a part.\nAt a virtual media conference on April 15, Abdulah and other members, including Haitian economist Prof Camille Chalmers, spoke about why the committee was demanding reparations and other action planned.\nThe letter is also being delivered on the 200th anniversary of France demanding Haiti compensate it for winning its independence in 1804. Haiti was ordered to pay 150 million francs and it took the country more than 120 years to do so. Abdulah said other groups were expected to join the committee’s visit to the embassy and called on anyone else interested in supporting to do so.\nHaiti’s gang problem and Kenyan troops helping in that fight were also discussed. One participating member called for the Kenyan troops’ removal.\nOn April 13, Caricom issued a statement saying it was deeply concerned by recent reports that a coalition of criminal gangs was threatening to seize power and compel a change in the governance arrangements in Haiti.\n“This is completely unacceptable,” Caricom said.\nIt added that it strongly condemned any attempt to replace the transitional arrangements by force and violence.\n“These arrangements were put in place by Haitian stakeholders to pave the way for free and fair elections by February 7, 2026, and to return Haiti to constitutional authority.\nMoreover, any further organised violence will only exacerbate the existing humanitarian crisis. The International Organisation on Migration (IOM) reported that in mid-January of this year there were 1,041,000 internally displaced Haitians, some of whom are already risking their lives in attempting to leave by any means necessary. Over the last month alone, close to 60,000 Haitians have been displaced. Increased violence will simply hurt those who are least capable of protecting themselves.”\nCaricom said it had been in consultation with Haiti and international partners to urgently provide further assistance. It saluted the effort of Haitian security forces and the Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission spearheaded by the Kenyans to enforce order and protect the citizens. It also called on the international community, including the UN and Organisation of American States to take “all necessary steps” to support Haitian authorities addressing this crisis.\nIt was reported on April 15 that the Haitian government had approved a war budget aimed at curbing escalating gang violence.",

    "text": "HONIARA, Solomon Islands – The 1984th U.S. Army Hospital Pacific (USAH-P),a brigade of the 9th Mission Support Command, continued their Global Healthcare Engagement (GHE) in Solomon Islands for two weeks in August of 2024.\nThe teams were spread out across the provinces around the island nation with particular focus on Auki , Honiara, Gizo, and Munda. In Munda, a small community on the island of New Georgia, the team’s centerpiece was the introduction of a new ultrasound machine, and Lt. Col. Richard Teames, the officer in charge (OIC) of the Operating Room and Anesthesia Section for the 394th Forward Surgical Team, played a pivotal role in this endeavor.\nAs an expert in ultrasound technology and a consultant for the manufacturer of the machine (Fujifilm), Teames – who is, a physician anesthesiologist from Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas -- shared his experiences setting up the equipment, working with the local healthcare teams and the profound impact of the mission on the local healthcare system.\n“When we arrived in Munda, Dr. Ray mentioned that a brand-new ultrasound machine had been delivered just three days prior,” Teames explained. “It came in large wooden crates from Japan, and we assisted the local healthcare professionals in setting up the ultrasound.”\nOver several days, Teames and his team worked with local doctors and specialists on various aspects of the ultrasound machine, including scanning techniques, probe use, and image management. It wasn’t long before the machine would be needed for immediate use. Shortly after its assembly, a local professional called for the use of the ultrasound to assess a critically ill premature infant.\n“We used the ultrasound to identify a large amount of free air in the baby’s belly, indicating a perforation in the intestinal tract,” Teames recalled. “The ability to make such swift decisions with the new ultrasound was crucial.”\nThe quick diagnosis enabled the timely transfer of the infant to the National Referral Hospital in Honiara, where she received appropriate care. In another instance, the ultrasound was used to perform nerve blocks for a patient with severe diabetic infection.\n“We worked with the local doctors on using the ultrasound for nerve blocks, which allowed us to perform a toe amputation with effective anesthesia and without additional sedation,” Teames noted. “The nerve block provided 22 hours of pain relief post-operation.”\nTeames highlighted the immense benefit of such medical equipment to communities like Munda.\n“The real challenge isn’t just having advanced equipment but knowing how to use it effectively,” Teams explained. “The ultrasound’s impact on Munda’s health care capabilities is profound, and ongoing use and training is crucial for maximizing its potential.”\nReflecting on his experience, Teames was deeply moved by the local community.\n“The people of Munda make the most of limited resources, which teaches us to be more frugal and grateful for what we have,” Teames said. “The relationship building with the people of Solomon Islands is invaluable. They greatly appreciate our efforts, and our presence made a noticeable impact. Sustaining these medical missions and working alongside their medical professionals should be a priority for the Department of Defense.”\nThe mission to Munda underscores the importance of essential medical equipment but also exposure to said equipment in order to improve efficiency in a given medical community. The collaboration and support from missions like these contribute significantly to improving healthcare outcomes in underserved regions.",

    "title": "Massive waves flood California beach towns as evacuations ordered",
    "text": "Up and down the California coast, monster waves battered beach towns Thursday churned up by a powerful storm in the Pacific Ocean. From San Diego to Los Angeles and beyond San Francisco, the National Weather Service issued Coastal Flood Warnings and High Surf Warnings for breaking waves between 28 and 33 feet. Some locations were forecast to see waves as high as 40 feet. The massive waves overtook beaches and coastal roads. Some even crashed against homes and businesses. The debris deposited on streets was so heavy that road crews used plows to clear the scenic State Highway 1, south of San Francisco. Other stretches of the road were too buried to clear. Officials issued evacuation orders for several northern and central California coastal communities. Residents that local reporters talked to were shocked to see the waves so large. Many went to the beaches to get pictures and videos. Watch the video below as the shocked photographers screamed and ran from a monster in Capitola. “Before anyone says anything, right after a bigger wave came, everyone was asked to leave and evacuate the Esplanade,” posted Yesica Guzman on social media. “The cops were making sure everyone was safe. No one got injured due to the waves, at least no one near us. Shortly after this video, everyone received the evacuation notices and the cops evacuated anyone near.” “We put evacuation warnings into place around 8 a.m. this morning for this area, and, as you can see, these waves are incredibly powerful,” Ashley Keehn, the Santa Cruz County Sheriff’s Office Information Officer, told KTVU FOX 2. “They’re washing logs up here. A lot of debris, a lot of driftwood. So we’ve been asking people to avoid the direct coastal area.” Not everyone heeded the advice, however, and ended up soaked. The waves kept coming. Take a look at this aerial picture of Ventura, California. The swells come in sets, one after another. Ventura County rescue crews were kept busy with both rescues and injury calls as waves smashed windows and glass doors of homes and swept onlookers off piers and beaches. A wave in Ventura County, north of Los Angeles, topped the pier. The NWS estimated that it was 20 feet high. Coastal Flood Warnings and High Surf Warnings in Northern California expire late Thursday and early Friday morning. The NWS warned that the next set of big swells will arrive Saturday. The Los Angeles NWS office is not taking any chances, and Southern California warnings are in place through Saturday night. The worst of the flooding occurs at high tide.",

    "text": "Turkey’s monthly minimum wage will be 17,002 Turkish lira ($578.31) in 2024, Labor Minister Vedat Işıkhan said on Wednesday, marking a 49 percent increase from the level determined in July and a 100 percent hike from January, Reuters [reported](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkey-raises-monthly-minimum-wage-by-49-2024-2023-12-27/). “We are pleased to once again fulfil our pledge to prevent our workers from being crushed by inflation,” Işıkhan said. About a third of the population of 86 million people earn the minimum wage, and other salary rises are determined by the base pay. Turkey’s annual inflation rate edged up to 61.98 percent in November, its highest level this year but just shy of expectations, signaling that an aggressive rate-hiking cycle may be beginning to cool demand. Inflation soared after a currency crisis at the end of 2021 and touched a 24-year peak of 85.51 percent in October last year. This year, the lira has so far lost some 35 percent of its value, compounding the cost-of-living crisis for Turks. Higher wages are feared to strongly contribute to pushing up inflation, which reached 62 percent last month. The central bank was only expecting a peak to be reached in May at 70 percent, and it may now be forced to continue raising interest rates to cool demand. The bank has lifted the benchmark interest rate by 34 percentage points since June after President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was re-elected and appointed a new governor to undo his pre-election economic policies. He had forced the previous bank chief to cut interest rates to single digits to expand the $900 billion economy during his election campaign. Turkey is scheduled to hold local elections on March 31. Erdoğan has vowed to retake control of İstanbul, the biggest city, and the capital Ankara from the opposition, building on the momentum of his re-election earlier this year, when he began his third decade at the helm.",

    "title": "Cómo se utilizan las campañas de desinformación para atacar al papa Francisco",
    "text": "El papa Francisco ha sido objetivo de campañas de desinformación desde su nombramiento hace más de diez años. En Maldita.es, hemos detectado en este tiempo narrativas desinformadoras constituidas a partir de bulos y teorías sin pruebas para atacar su figura, sus decisiones sobre asuntos que afectan a la iglesia Católica y que lo vinculan con conspiraciones.\nLa narrativa de que el papa Francisco quiere acabar con la Navidad\nDesde distintas plataformas se difunde la narrativa de que el papa actual es “una tragedia para los católicos occidentales” y que una de sus acciones contra la propia Iglesia sería la de deshacerse de la Navidad.\n“El Vaticano reemplaza la Navidad por la ‘Fiesta de la Paz’: las palabras del Papa Francisco”. Es un titular que publicó una página web y del que se hicieron eco tanto usuarios en redes sociales como otros sitios en internet. Sin embargo, es un bulo. No hay ninguna evidencia de que así se pronunciara el Sumo Pontífice, y a 2 de diciembre de 2024, la publicación original ya no está disponible.\nEste bulo sobre Francisco sigue la línea de la narrativa que dice que gobiernos e instituciones de poder en Occidente pretenden arrebatar su origen católico para dar paso al islam o a otros credos como el marco cultural dominante. Así nos encontramos, por ejemplo, con una supuesta recomendación de la Comisión Europea de que se feliciten las fiestas y no la Navidad, que en realidad formaba parte de una guía de 2021 que nunca llegó a aprobarse. También el bulo de que la consellera de Igualtat i Feminismes de la Generalitat de Catalunya, Tània Verge, propusiera eliminar la Navidad para no discriminar otras religiones”, en referencia a los musulmanes, o distintas publicaciones en redes sociales que dicen que “celebrar la Navidad es una falta de respeto” para los musulmanes que viven en España.\nLa narrativa desinformadora de que el papa “se rinde al islam”\nEn la narrativa anterior vimos cómo se señala al papa de buscar “despojar a Occidente de sus raíces cristianas”. Siguiendo esa línea, existe una narrativa que va un poco más allá y plantea que Francisco, cabeza del catolicismo, habría “cedido ante el islam”.\nUn ejemplo es cuando se tomó una fotografía del papa Francisco con el presidente de Sudán del Sur y se difundió con mensajes como estos: “Señores, para flipar: el jesuita de la Iglesia Católica se rinde ante el islam” o “arrodillarse ante un musulmán y rendirse al islam”. Lo cierto es que Kiir es católico, y el gesto, que es real, se dio durante un retiro espiritual de los líderes del país africano, el 11 de abril de 2019.\nTambién se ha compartido un bulo que dice que, en ese supuesto intento de despojar a Occidente de sus valores cristianos en favor de otras religiones, Francisco “ha cancelado la Biblia”, libro sagrado de su fe. Estos contenidos dicen que lo habría hecho por “estar desactualizada” y afirman que supuestamente ha propuesto un nuevo libro sagrado.\nLa narrativa desinformadora que vincula al papa Francisco con casos de pederastia\n“Dios ama a los pedófilos, los creó por una razón y tienen un lugar especial en el cielo”. La web The People’s Voice, que afirma que sus publicaciones pueden contener “imprecisiones”, difundió ese titular que luego se viralizó. Es un bulo, en cualquier caso. No hay constancia de que en ningún momento se haya pronunciado de tal manera, y las webs que lo difunden no aportan ninguna fuente.\nNo es el único bulo que difunde esta narrativa desinformadora que intenta vincular a Francisco con la pederastia. Con la desclasificación de documentos en el caso de Jeffrey Epstein, circularon distintos contenidos que señalaban al papa de aparecer “mencionado varias veces” en ellos y que eso sería prueba de que es pederasta. También era un bulo.\nY de nuevo en el contexto del caso Epstein, circularon imágenes en las que supuestamente se ve al papa de fiesta, bebiendo alcohol y besando a una chica, en la mansión del magnate sentenciado por tráfico sexual de menores. Estas, sin embargo, no son reales, sino que fueron creadas con el programa de inteligencia artificial generativa Midjourney.\nTambién hemos visto contenidos que dicen que en enero de 2021 el papa fue detenido por “posesión de pornografía infantil, tráfico de personas e incestos”, un bulo que quedó desmontado inmediatamente porque, el día en que supuestamente estaba detenido “bajo custodia federal de Italia”, Francisco compareció públicamente.\nLa narrativa desinformadora de que el papa es satánico\n“El Papa Francisco ordena a los cristianos ‘rezar a Satanás’ para obtener una ‘verdadera iluminación’”. Otra de las narrativas desinformadoras que circulan sobre el papa es que es “satánico”. Se difunde, por ejemplo, con este titular de la web desinformadora The People’s Voice que es un bulo. En ningún momento hay constancia de que el pontífice se haya pronunciado así, y no aportan ninguna prueba ni fuente que pudiera demostrarlo.\nY en la misma línea circularon unas imágenes en las que Francisco está supuestamente saludando a un sacerdote satánico, pero [se trata de contenido ](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20230414/papa-francisco-sacerdote-satanico-bulo-inteligencia-artificial/)generado con inteligencia artificial.\nEl papa y la teoría de la sustitución demográfica\nExiste una teoría de la conspiración que plantea que hay [un complot de las élites para sustituir a las poblaciones blancas](https://immigrationforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Replacement-Theory-Explainer-1122.pdf) de origen cristiano-europeo por [pueblos no europeos](https://web.archive.org/save/https://twitter.com/Lambert_Landser/status/1499648597079597057). Es la “Teoría del Gran Reemplazo” (sobre la que [ya hemos publicado antes en ](https://maldita.es/migracion/20220531/gran-reemplazo-teoria-conspiracion/)[Maldita.es](https://Maldita.es)) y el papa Francisco no queda exento de ser vinculado, a través de bulos, con ella.\nVemos, por ejemplo, un contenido que circula eventualmente que dice que \"el Papa Francisco pide a las mujeres europeas reproducirse con los inmigrantes musulmanes\". Esto supuestamente sería para combatir la baja tasa de natalidad de Europa. Es [un bulo](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20230907/papa-mujeres-europeas-reproduzcan-migrantes/) que nace de las supuestas declaraciones en una entrevista que el papa concedió al medio católico francés [La Croix](https://archive.li/97tfn) en 2016. Sin embargo, en ningún momento dice que las relaciones deban darse entre mujeres europeas e inmigrantes musulmanes.\nLos bulos sobre el papa a favor de la despoblación\nJusto al otro lado, existen bulos que dicen que el líder de la Iglesia Católica estaría a favor de provocar la despoblación del mundo. Los desinformadores de The People’s Voice publicaron [un titular que dice que](https://archive.ph/mk7Z0) “Bill Clinton y el Papa Francisco piden una ‘despoblación urgente’ para salvar el planeta”. [No hay registros](https://maldita.es/clima/20231002/bill-clinton-papa-francisco-despoblacion/) de que ni el expresidente estadounidense ni el pontífice hayan hecho las declaraciones que el contenido les atribuye.\nEsa misma web publicó el bulo de que el papa Francisco habría dicho que hay que “sacrificar a personas con autismo, alcoholismo y otras (...) enfermedades y discapacidades”, supuestamente para luchar contra el cambio climático.[ De nuevo, es un bulo](https://maldita.es/clima/20230809/papa-francisco-sacrificio-personas-discapacidad-cambio-climatico/) y, de nuevo, lo publican sin incluir ningún tipo de fuente o prueba.\nNarrativas que dicen que Francisco está muerto o que ha desaparecido\n“El papa Francisco ha muerto y saldrá la noticia en Semana Santa. Guarden este tweet”. En marzo de 2023, el papa ingresó en el hospital [por bronquitis](https://www.vaticannews.va/es/papa/news/2023-03/papa-hospital-gemelli-controles-programados.html). A raíz de ello comenzaron a difundirse diversos contenidos que aseguraban que había fallecido, y que le sustituían con un doble. [Un bulo](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20230412/papa-francisco-muerto-semana-santa-teoria/). Esa misma Semana Santa (abril de 2023) encabezó las ceremonias propias del catolicismo por la época.\nEl papa y el movimiento antivacunas\n\"[El papa Francisco pronostica que los negacionistas irán al infierno por no vacunarse](https://archive.ph/rleYV)\". Esa frase se difundió como si hubiese sido un titular del diario El Mundo en abril de 2022. No hay rastro de ninguna clase de que el papa haya hecho tal afirmación, y la supuesta portada de El Mundo en la que aparece ese titular también[ es un bulo: ](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20220425/papa-francisco-negacionistas-infierno/)es un montaje realizado a partir de la portada de ese medio [publicada el 27 de abril de 2021](https://www.elmundo.es/television/medios/2021/04/26/60871f00fc6c83632d8b4687.html).\nHemos actualizado este artículo el 17 de febrero de 2025 para añadir que las narrativas de que el papa Francisco haya muerto o desaparecido son falsas hasta esta fecha.\nPrimera fecha de publicación de este artículo: 02/12/2024",

Questo risultato conferma la sua supremazia nella disciplina, già dimostrata con l'oro ottenuto a Tokyo. Fantin, nato a Latisana 23 anni fa, è soprannominato il \"delfino di Bibione\" per la sua abilità nel nuoto. Attualmente vive oltre il Tagliamento, ma si allena a Lignano Sabbiadoro. La sua carriera è stata caratterizzata da una crescita costante e da una serie di successi che lo hanno portato a diventare uno dei punti di riferimento del nuoto paralimpico italiano. Il percorso di Fantin verso l'oro di Parigi è stato segnato da una preparazione meticolosa e da una dedizione assoluta. Dopo aver dominato le batterie, ha affrontato la finale con determinazione, distaccando nettamente gli avversari e confermando il suo margine di vantaggio. Il tempo di 1:03.13 non solo gli ha permesso di vincere l'oro, ma ha anche stabilito un nuovo record della competizione, migliorando il precedente primato. La vittoria di Fantin ha contribuito in modo significativo al medagliere italiano, che ha raggiunto un totale di 12 ori, 4 argenti e 13 bronzi, superando il record di ori dell'edizione precedente di Tokyo. Questo successo è il risultato di un lavoro di squadra che coinvolge atleti, allenatori e tutto lo staff tecnico, ma è anche il frutto del talento e della determinazione di Fantin.",
