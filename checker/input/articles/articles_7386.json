    "title": "10 Most Important Bears of 2024: #1 Matt Eberflus",
    "text": "I don’t believe in Matt Eberflus as the head coach of the [Chicago Bears](https://www.windycitygridiron.com/). I think he has a good defensive mind and is a good leader for his players, but his in-game management doesn't do it for me. A coach can’t settle for field goal attempts when his opponent is scoring touchdowns. A coach can’t sit on leads and hope for the best. A coach can’t punt on fourth and short from plus territory. Sure, there are outlying instances where it’s wise to do those three things, but generally speaking, coaches who consistently do that are coaching not to lose instead of coaching to win. Today’s NFL is all about the offense. It’s a quarterback-driven league, and it has been for quite some time. The run-the-ball and play-good-defense era is gone, and while those are still two staples for a winning team, you need more than that. Good offense trumps good defense, and even more so with how the league’s rule changes tend to benefit the offense. Eberflus has been known to gamble on occasion — he was middle of the pack last year in going for it on fourth down and in conversion percentage — but several of his fourth quarters have been mismanaged. There’s a time and place for aggressive decision-making, but ‘Flus seemed to turtle with the game on the line. The Bears blew three two-score fourth-quarter games last season, and while the players didn’t execute down the stretch, many of the play calls were head-scratchers. To paraphrase Maya Angelou, when a head football coach shows you he’s conservative, you believe him, and Eberflus has been that through his two years leading the Bears. Now, there’s nothing to say he can’t change. We see players develop all the time, and coaches can do it as well. Year three might be when it all clicks for him. I’m rooting for him because he’s a likable guy, but mostly because the Bears need him to prove he’s the right coach for the job. This franchise is desperate for continuity, especially with a rookie quarterback under center. So, while I’ve had my doubts during his tenure, I understand that circumstances often drive decisions, and Chicago’s circumstances during Eberflus’ two years were that of a rebuilding team. He had to play the hand he was dealt, and in year one, he had an offsuit two and seven. In year two, he was more fortunate but still hoping for a nice flop. His passing offenses have been among the league’s worst, which may have led to some of the conservative decisions. In the fourth quarter of all games last season, Chicago quarterbacks had a 45.4 passer rating, which was by far their worst quarter. In adjusted net yards per pass attempt, which takes yards lost due to sacks into account, Bear quarterbacks averaged 2.4 yards on all fourth-quarter pass attempts. If he didn’t trust his offense to execute, that could have been the reason we got too many run, run, pass, punt series’ during games. I know Luke Getsy was the offensive playcaller, but if Eberflus wanted his offense to step on the gas, then Getsy would have been more aggressive. If the offseason is any indication, then there’ll be a new and improved ‘Flus leading the Bears in 2024. The makeover is one thing, but there’s also an aura of confidence about him during press conferences. He was even asked at a recent presser why the change in front of the podium, and he said all the “time on task” has made him more comfortable. We’ll have to wait for game day to see if Caleb Williams, Keenan Allen, Rome Odunze, D’Andre Swift, and Gerald Everett executing in Shane Waldron’s offense has him comfortable enough to stop being so conservative.",

    "text": "Coming Arctic blast threatens to shut off electricity, US grid monitor warns By Peter Behr | 01/03/2025 06:36 AM EST\nNERC CEO Jim Robb issued an unusual warning via YouTube urging electricity generators and gas companies to prepare for the worst.\nTrucks sit at a standstill on Interstate 35 in Killeen, Texas, after Winter Storm Uri clobbered the region in February 2021. Joe Raedle/Getty Images\nAn Arctic blast that forecasters expect to send temperatures plummeting across much of the United States east of the Rocky Mountains could freeze equipment and trigger widespread power outages if operators aren’t adequately protecting their systems, warned the top U.S. grid monitor.\nThe North American Electric Reliability Corp., the interstate grid’s security monitor, issued an alert to the power and gas industries this week with a personal plea from its chief executive, Jim Robb. Action was essential, he said over NERC’s YouTube channel, “to help us avoid the consequences of events such as we saw in Texas in 2021 and in the mid-Atlantic in 2022 with winter storms Uri and Elliott.”\nAt least 240 people died and electricity and gas shortages left more than 4 million people without power during the nearly weeklong Texas freeze. Then during Christmas week of 2022, frozen gas wells and processing infrastructure nearly caused a catastrophic, long-lasting loss of gas heating for 1.1 million New York City utility customers. Farther south, Duke Energy and the Tennessee Valley Authority had to impose rolling power blackouts to keep their energy systems in balance.\nAdvertisement NERC’s warning followed similar messages from the National Weather Service, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Department of Homeland Security, forecasting very dangerous freezing rain, ice storms and heavy snowfall beginning Sunday across the central U.S. and lower Great Lakes region into the southeast.\nGET FULL ACCESS Related Articles They died with the AC off.

    "text": "Il risultato della nostra\ntenacia \"vale tantissimo: per Giulio, per noi e per tutti i\ncittadini italiani. Siamo riusciti a fare un varco che nessuno\naveva mai fatto prima. Certo ci costa tantissimo però lo\nfacciamo perché crediamo nella giustizia. E' stato lungo otto\nanni ma ce l'abbiamo fatta\". Lo ha detto la mamma di Giulio\nRegeni, Paola Deffendi intervenendo in collegamento da\nFiumicello (Udine) a IL cavallo e la torre su Raitre e\nriferendosi al processo sulla morte del figlio che inizierà il\n20 febbraio.\n\"Speriamo solo nella giustizia processuale - ha aggiunto il padre, Claudio - quella per Giulio in tutto penso non ci sarà mai, il dolore resterà sempre in fondo il cuore\".\nQuesta sera Fiumicello, paese natale di Regeni, ha ricordato il giovane ricercatore a otto anni esatti dalla scomparsa dal Cairo. Tra le iniziative proposte, anche un flash mob per sottolineare che \"tutti i nodi vengono al pettine\". Il riferimento è l'inizio del processo a carico dei quattro 007 egiziani rinviati a giudizio per la morte di Giulio. Nel piazzale dei Tigli, da un lato c'era una fila di pettini, dall'altro una fila di gomitoli. Tutti del colore di Regeni e del popolo che chiede verità sulla sua morte: il giallo. Una volta dato il via, filati e pettini, movimentati da un gruppo di volontari, hanno costruito un telaio come a voler sciogliere i nodi. Al termine, Paola e Claudio, assieme alla sorella di Giulio, Irene, hanno esposto un'illustrazione di Lorenzo Terranera: un pettine giallo che scioglie i nodi aiutato da alcune persone.\nAlle 19.41, la stessa ora in cui Giulio il 25 gennaio 2016 inviò il suo ultimo messaggio, è poi stato osservato un minuto di silenzio. In piazza erano state disposte 36 fiaccole, tante quanti gli anni che avrebbe avuto Giulio oggi. Tutto intorno c'era il popolo giallo, ciascuno con la propria fiaccola accesa e alzata verso il cielo.\nRiproduzione riservata © Copyright ANSA",
