    "text": "Solana is one the best altcoins in the crypto space as it has rallied over 600% from its December 2022 low. Did you miss out on Solana? Don't worry. Analysts have picked three coins that can give such massive gains in 2024. They are Bitcoin, Meme Moguls, and Stacks.\nAnalysts Forecast Bitcoin (BTC) Prices for 2024 Crypto Rover, a crypto analyst with over 615k followers on X, has hopped in on Bitcoin price prediction. The analyst noted that Bitcoin faces a major resistance at $44,300.\nIf Bitcoin price can surpass this resistance level, Crypto Rover noted that the coin would rise to $46,000. Also, another analyst, Michael Van de Poppe, has tagged Bitcoin ETF approval as a significant event for the flagship cryptocurrency.\nMeanwhile, Matrix Port has forecasted that the US SEC will greenlight Bitcoin ETF in January 2024. The crypto company stated that this would be a major rally, taking Bitcoin to $50,000 by February 2024.\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin has fluctuated between $40,766.45 and $44,155.79 in the past week. The bulls are currently gearing up to retest the $44,300 level. A breakout would spark a rally to $46,000.\nStacks (STX) Soars After Praises From Legendary Investor Tim Draper Stacks (STX), the native token of the Stacks Network, saw a 27% increase in value on Wednesday. This uptick followed a series of encouraging remarks from Tim Draper . Draper, while in an interview with CoinBureau, expressed his enthusiasm: \"I'm pretty excited about Stacks.\"\nMeanwhile, 2023 has seen a notable one for Stacks, especially with the launch of Bitcoin-based NFT projects like Ordinals. According to data from DeFiLlama, the amount of capital locked in Stacks has grown from $7 million to $50 million since the start of 2023.\nAlso, the Stacks price has increased 131.4% in the past months as it trades at the $1.4 region. Analysts have predicted a rise to $3 in 2024.\nWhy Meme Moguls (MGLS) Could Soar 50x in 2024 Besides Bitcoin and Stacks, analysts are also bullish on the blockchain ICO, Meme Moguls . Currently, Meme Moguls' tokens are valued at only $0.0025. Meanwhile, analysts have predicted a 50x price surge in 2024. Below are five reasons why Meme Moguls would soar in 2024:\nMeme Moguls stands out with its innovative features in the gaming and financial market:\nUnique Play-to-Earn Model: Meme Moguls introduces a play-to-earn concept where players can play games and earn real rewards. Analysts believe this approach could draw a broad audience interested in gaming and finance. Community-Driven Environment: The DeFi project focuses on community engagement. It provides a space for players to interact, compete, and grow together. Enhanced Gaming with NFTs: The platform's NFTs are more than collectibles. Their rarity and utility bring added value to the game's economy. Educational and Competitive Gameplay: The platform offers trading education beyond entertainment. The DeFi project hosts trading competitions, helping players develop their skills and strive to become top traders in the game. The MGLS token is the in-game currency and is a major part of this blockchain ICO. Players can use it to purchase assets and engage in game trading activities. Because of the uniqueness of the ecosystem, analysts have backed MGLS for a major surge in 2024.\nConclusion According to analysts, Bitcoin, Stacks, and Meme Moguls are among the best altcoins to give Solana-like price gains in 2024. Meanwhile, Meme Moguls is the cheapest of the three. It should be a top choice for investors looking for relatively cheap tokens with huge potential.\nLearn more about the $MGLS here:\nVisit Meme Moguls | Join the Community\nDisclaimer: This is a paid press release, BSC.News does not endorse and is not responsible for or liable for any content, accuracy, quality, advertising, products, or other materials on this page.

This includes Screen Time, Find My, Communication Saftey, Communication Limits, and more.\nOver this year, Apple is introducing new features to build on its commitment to user privacy, security, and safety for children:\nMake it even easier for parents to set up Child Accounts that underlie many of our parental controls.\nPut parents in control by allowing them to share information about the age range of their kids with apps to enable developers to provide only age-appropriate content, all without needing to share their birthdate or other sensitive information.\nAnd further enhance parents' insight and control over their kids' experiences by updating our age ratings, adding more useful information on product pages, and making browsing safer on the App Store.\nChild Accounts\nFirst, Apple is building on its Child Accounts feature with several key improvements. First, the company is streamlining the process of creating those Child Accounts in the first place.\nIn iOS 18.4, which is currently available in beta, Apple has added a new \"Age Range\" step to the setup process of a new iPhone or iPad. On this screen, users will select the age range of the person who will use the device. Apple will then use the information to \"set up parental controls and safety features.\"\nChild: 12 or younger\nTeen: 13 to 17\nAdult: 18 or older\nIf parents prefer to wait until later to finish setting up a Child Account, Apple says that \"child-appropriate default settings will still be enabled on the device.\"\n\"This way, a child can immediately begin to use their iPhone or iPad safely, and parents can be assured that child safety features will be active in the meantime,\" Apple explains. \"This means even more kids will end up using devices configured to maximize child safety with parental controls.\"\nStarting later this year, Apple says that parents will be able to \"easily correct the age that is associated with their kid's account if they previously…\nChance Miller",
