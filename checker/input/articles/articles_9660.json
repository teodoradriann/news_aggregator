    "text": "MEDLEY, Fla. – Detectives reported a man referred to an organized fraud case out of Miami-Dade County’s town of Medley as an “under the table” deal.\nThe Medley Police Department announced the case on Thursday involved the arrests of Guillermo Gonzalez, Rolando Bazail, Reynel Castillo, and Roylis Rodriguez.\nRecommended Videos\n“These arrests mark a significant breakthrough in our ongoing efforts to combat organized crime,” Officer Deglys Chavarria, a spokesman for the department, wrote in a statement.\nThe group defrauded Countywide of Miami, a Medley-based fleet management company, of nearly $78,000 from August 2023 to Wednesday.\nDetectives identified Gonzalez, 45, and Bazail, 46, as Countywide of Miami employees, at 8501 NW 80 St. Surveillance videos show they arrived 45 minutes early to move plywood stacks to a loading dock.\nThe duo would then sell the plywood they had stolen to awaiting buyers. Detectives identified Castillo and Rodriguez as the two buyers present when Gonzalez and Diaz were arrested.\nReynel Castillo, left, and Roylis Rodriguez, were arrested over an organized scheme to defraud in Miami-Dade County. (MDPD) Rodriguez, 44, a certified tradesman for residential repairs, had used Zelle to pay Gonzalez about $15,000 for the stolen plywood.\nThe four men faced charges of organized fraud of $50,000 or more. They remained at the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center on Thursday afternoon.\nCastillo and Rodriguez faced an additional charge of dealing in stolen property.\nDetectives asked anyone with information about this or other cases to call Miami-Dade County Crime Stoppers at 305-471-8477.\nCopyright 2024 by WPLG Local10.com - All rights reserved.",

    "title": "Así es Inmaculada, la nueva película de terror de Sydney Sweeney",
    "text": "Digamos que Inmaculada, la nueva película con Sydney Sweeney, aprueba raspando, quizás porque es el habitual terror religioso con trama trillada, pero relativamente efectiva, que cede cuando recurre a giros de fórmula y a resoluciones perezosas, con diálogos algo tontos y personajes poco atractivos, salvo por dos monjas clave, a las que cometen el error de matar muy rápido. Sweeney, quien también es la productora, hace lo que puede en una película dirigida con cierta solvencia por Michael Mohan, aunque en algunas escenas pareciera que no le queda otra que los gritos sobreactuados y esas miradas de desesperación e inocencia que tan bien le salen, pero que en el contexto de la historia son muy difíciles de sostener. Al contrario de la excelente La primera profecía (estrenada hace un par de meses), con la que comparte terreno, Inmaculada no se arriesga casi nada, como si no se animara a salirse de los estándares de la industria. Es terror en piloto automático, ubicado en la tradición del nunsploitation (películas con monjas) y del eurohorror con curas que quieren engendrar al hijo de Dios y que terminan engendrando al mismísimo Diablo. Y si bien el final es sanguinario y rabioso, lo que lo precede es de una falta de imaginación que aplana la totalidad, aunque tiene un par de sustos aceptables y una fotografía funcional a la atmósfera oscura. Esta vez la víctima es la novicia Cecilia (Sweeney), una joven devota que llega a un convento en la campiña italiana en busca de la consagración espiritual. Apenas llega empieza a ver cosas extrañas y se lleva una mala impresión con el poco amigable recibimiento que le dan, sobre todo el de una monja en particular, la hermana Isabelle (Giulia Heathfield Di Renzi). También aparece otra monja clave, Gwen (Benedetta Porcaroli), quien se hace amiga de Cecilia y le advierte de lo que pasa en el convento. Es Gwen la primera en gritar las verdades del lugar y la que le inspira cierta rebeldía a Cecilia, quien de la noche a la mañana aparece embarazada. ¿La violaron mientras dormía o fue obra del Espíritu Santo? La película se encarga de dar el giro sutilmente sobrenatural, dando a entender que el hijo que espera Cecilia es más del Diablo que de Dios, siempre usando el fuera de campo y sugiriendo con el sonido (uno de los pocos aciertos de puesta en escena). Llama la atención que en las películas de terror con monjas e iglesias aparezca el Mal, justo ahí, en la casa de Dios. Lo bueno es que se puede hacer un paralelismo con la política, ya que la Iglesia y sus representantes exigen a sus devotos pobreza, obediencia y castidad, es decir, lo mismo que exigen la derecha y sus representantes, quienes le piden al pueblo el sacrificio de la obediencia y de la pobreza para que ellos puedan mantener su riqueza y su poder. Si bien el filme es bastante torpe y sus personajes carecen de carisma, el director decide aplicar en el final la furia y el pragmatismo del cine norteamericano, haciendo que la protagonista decida lo que corresponde. Con ese final valiente (aunque obvio), Inmaculada aporta su granito de arena para desenmascarar algunas injusticias. Por esto, y por la esmerada construcción de clima, la película aprueba con lo justo. Para ver “Inmaculada” Immaculate, Estados Unidos/Italia, 2024. Terror. Dirección: Michael Mohan.

    "text": "Norway’s biggest pension fund has blacklisted Gulf companies over human rights abuses, including state surveillance and treatment of migrant workers. KLP yesterday said it will boycott firms in the real estate sector in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, where it said migrant workers have faced human rights violations. The fund manager, which has £55billion of assets under management, also targeted Gulf telecoms companies over concerns they have suppressed freedom of expression. It has separately blacklisted Aramco, the world’s largest oil company, citing a lack of green transition planning and its close ties to the Saudi government. It has withdrawn around £12million from the 12 Gulf companies. Human rights abuses: Riyad in Saudi Arabia. Norway's biggest pension fund said it will boycott firms in the real estate sector in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait The Oslo-based pension scheme said investing in Aramco did not align with its goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. Aramco is 90 per cent state-owned, which has made it ‘difficult for other shareholders to influence the company through the exercise of active ownership’, KLP said. In a statement yesterday the scheme said: ‘Close links between the state and the company result in a significant overall ability to leverage power and influence in favour of a climate and energy transition policy that runs counter to KLP’s goals.’ Aramco has been contacted for comment. The other firms were excluded due to KLP’s concerns about human rights abuses.",
