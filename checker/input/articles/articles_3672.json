    "text": "The metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) market is experiencing significant growth, driven by advancements in targeted therapies, immunotherapies, and personalized medicine. The increasing prevalence of colorectal cancer, along with growing awareness of early diagnosis and treatment options, is fueling demand for innovative treatments.\nLAS VEGAS , April 23, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks as the third most prevalent cancer, with metastasis being the leading cause of mortality among affected patients. The liver and peritoneum are the most frequent sites of distant spread. For most individuals, metastatic CRC (mCRC) remains largely incurable, with common metastatic locations including the liver, lungs, lymph nodes, and peritoneum.\nSeen in approximately 45% CRC patients, KRAS mutations significantly influence the prognosis and treatment outcomes. These mutations are associated with a more aggressive disease course, resistance to chemotherapy and targeted therapies, and overall poorer survival rates.\nIn 2024, the incidence of metastatic colorectal cancer was around 294K cases across the seven major markets, with the United States reporting the highest incidence. This number is expected to rise by 2034. Surgical intervention is the mainstay for resectable CRC, while unresectable cases are typically managed with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy. These conventional therapies, however, often lack specificity and can harm healthy cells, leading to additional health complications.\nThe treatment paradigm for mCRC involves multiple lines of therapy. First-line (1L) metastatic colorectal cancer treatments include combination chemotherapy regimens such as FOLFOX, FOLFIRI, and CAPEOX , alongside anti-angiogenic agents and targeted therapies like VECTIBIX and ERBITUX , with or without chemotherapy. KEYTRUDA and BRAFTOVI (in combination with ERBITUX and mFOLFOX6) are also approved for use in the first line. In the second-line (2L) setting, treatment options expand to include OPDIVO (± YERVOY), JEMPERLI, TUKYSA (± Trastuzumab), LONSURF (± Bevacizumab), and KRAZATI plus ERBITUX . For third-line (3L) therapy, specific agents such as STIVARGA and FRUZAQLA are utilized.\nLearn more about the metastatic colorectal cancer treatment landscape @ Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Drugs Market\nFRUZAQLA (fruquintinib) is a once-daily oral capsule developed by Takeda Pharmaceuticals . It is a kinase inhibitor approved for adult patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have previously been treated with chemotherapy regimens including fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan, as well as anti-VEGF therapy and, for RAS wild-type patients, anti-EGFR therapy. FRUZAQLA works by selectively targeting and inhibiting VEGFR-1, -2, and -3, thereby disrupting VEGF-driven blood vessel formation and tumor growth.\nThe FDA approved FRUZAQLA for previously treated mCRC in November 2023 , followed by the European Commission in June 2024 , and Japan in September 2024—marking it as the first new targeted therapy for mCRC in more than ten years in the Japanese market.\nOPDIVO QVANTIG (nivolumab and hyaluronidase-nvhy) is indicated for adult patients with MSI-H or dMMR mCRC that has progressed after prior treatment with fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan. It can be used as a standalone treatment or following prior combination therapy with intravenous nivolumab and ipilimumab. This drug works by blocking the PD-1 receptor, preventing its interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2 to boost immune system activity against cancer cells.\nIn December 2024 , the FDA approved OPDIVO QVANTIG as a subcutaneous injection for mCRC, making it the first PD-1 inhibitor available in this form. This new route of administration offers quicker treatment delivery—just 3 to 5 minutes—compared to the traditional 30-minute intravenous infusion of OPDIVO.\nTo know more about metastatic colorectal cancer treatments, visit @ Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Aggressive Treatment\nDespite several advancements, the metastatic colorectal cancer drug market remains highly competitive, with significant unmet needs for durable and long-term treatment responses. Ongoing research into investigational agents like amivantamab, zanzalintinib, and vactosertib highlights the push for more effective, resistance-targeting, and tumor microenvironment-modifying therapies, signaling a dynamic and evolving future for mCRC treatment.\nKey companies such as Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine, Shanghai Henlius Biotech, Inspirna, Treos Bio, Cardiff Oncology, Agenus, Leap Therapeutics, Arcus Biosciences, Enterome, Tizona Therapeutics, Innovative Cellular Therapeutics , and others are currently active in the metastatic colorectal cancer drug market.\nDiscover which therapies are expected to grab major metastatic colorectal cancer drug market share @ Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Market Report\nAmivantamab is a bispecific antibody designed to target specific genetic alterations, especially EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations. Its dual mechanism focuses on inhibiting both the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and the MET receptor—two key players in cancer cell growth and survival. By binding to these receptors, amivantamab interferes with their signaling pathways, helping to overcome resistance that tumors often develop to other treatments.\nThis dual targeting not only suppresses tumor cell growth but also enhances the body's immune response, leading to greater cancer cell destruction. The drug is currently in Phase III clinical trials for treating metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).\nZanzalintinib (XL-092) is a third-generation oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks several cancer-related receptor tyrosine kinases, including VEGF receptors, MET, AXL, and MER. These kinases play a role in normal cell function as well as pathological processes like cancer development, metastasis, angiogenesis, and resistance to therapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors. Developed by Exelixis , Zanzalintinib builds on the company's experience with cabozantinib, aiming to improve attributes like pharmacokinetic half-life. It is also in Phase III clinical trials for mCRC.\nDKN-01 is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the DKK1 protein and is being developed for treating esophagogastric, gynecologic, and colorectal cancers. Initial findings from Part A of the DeFianCe trial were shared at the 2024 ASCO Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium. Enrollment for Part B of the DeFianCe trial (NCT05480306) concluded in September 2024 . This Phase II, randomized, open-label, controlled study is assessing DKN-01 in combination with bevacizumab and chemotherapy as a second-line treatment for advanced colorectal cancer in patients previously treated with one systemic therapy. The study enrolled 188 patients, with early results anticipated by mid-2025.\nDiscover more about drugs for metastatic colorectal cancer in development @ Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Clinical Trials\nThe anticipated launch of these emerging metastatic colorectal cancer treatments are poised to transform the market landscape in the coming years. As these cutting-edge therapies continue to mature and gain regulatory approval, they are expected to reshape the metastatic colorectal cancer market landscape, offering new standards of care and unlocking opportunities for medical innovation and economic growth.\nDelveInsight estimates that the market size for metastatic colorectal cancer in the 7MM is expected to grow from USD 13 billion in 2024 with a significant CAGR by 2034.

    "text": "The remarkable success of South Africa’s Springboks in international rugby has had a profound impact not only within South Africa but across the African continent. Their triumphs, especially their recent victories in the 2019 and 2023 Rugby World Cups, have significantly influenced rugby’s growth in Africa in terms of participation, viewership, and social unity.\nIncreased Viewership Across the Continent\nThe Springboks’ continued success has helped increase rugby viewership across Africa. Fans eagerly follow rugby scores , particularly during Rugby World Cup tournaments, which attract large audiences in countries that historically had little exposure to the sport.\nIn 2023, for instance, public screenings and social media engagement during the World Cup highlighted how the entire continent celebrated alongside South Africa. The hashtag #StrongerTogether epitomised the pan-African unity brought about by their wins​.\nCountries like Kenya and Uganda have expanded their domestic leagues and international fixtures to capitalise on rugby’s growing popularity. The Springboks’ global success has also encouraged African broadcasters to provide more coverage, bringing the sport into more homes.\nBoost in Rugby Participation\nThe Springboks’ success has not only impacted viewership, but has also sparked significant participation in various African countries . Their victories serve as inspiration, particularly for countries with smaller rugby communities such as Namibia, Kenya, and Uganda.\nThese countries have seen a rise in youth involvement in rugby, encouraged by the Springboks’ achievements and the visibility of players like Siya Kolisi, the first black South African captain, and Tendai “The Beast” Mtawarira, who hails from Zimbabwe.\nThis surge in interest is also fuelled by the expanding work of Rugby Africa , the continent’s governing body for the sport. They have harnessed the Springboks’ triumphs to promote grassroots rugby development in African nations, creating pathways for more young talent to emerge.\nSocial and Economic Benefits\nBeyond the sport itself, the Springboks’ victories have helped build social cohesion. In South Africa, rugby has long been a symbol of unity post-apartheid, and these victories have once again galvanised the nation across racial and socio-economic lines.\nEconomically, rugby’s growing popularity is creating new opportunities for tourism and merchandising in Africa. South Africa’s hosting of major rugby events attracts international visitors, while brands have increasingly begun to sponsor rugby development programmes across the continent.\nConclusion\nIn summary, the Springboks’ success has had a widespread impact across Africa, inspiring greater rugby participation, increasing viewership, and promoting social unity. Their achievements transcend sport, symbolising African potential on the world stage.",

    "text": "2023 was my 2nd year of freelancing full-time, and things have improved significantly. My breakthrough is that client quality trumps quantity 24/7. Since 2019, when I began my freelance journey, I didn't dare to go all in until last year, doing true independent consulting, aka freelancing, working with multiple clients on multiple projects. Now that I have passed the €100k in total revenue milestone from independent work, I can say what drives most of my success: working with quality clients vs. wannabe entrepreneurs. A little over €100k in total revenue from freelancing ☝ In 2019, I had a few side projects, and then, in 2020 and 2021, I was a full-time employee, so there was no time for playing around. In mid-2021, I said I had to try it and switched from full-time employee to full-time independent consultant. My biggest mistake was working with one client at a time. That led to 2-3 months \"commitments.\" Most were local entrepreneurs with little to no knowledge of running and growing a business. How the number of clients progressed over the years ☝ So the hard lesson I learned last year is to have one or a maximum of 2 big clients that you can focus on, build a human connection, and deliver quality work, and a few smaller retainers (2 to 3 clients maximum). This year, 50% of my income came from one client; it's a steady, small agency run by two very successful and great leaders I've been working with since the beginning of the year (bye-bye, 3-month entrepreneurs). Almost 25% of my income came from a no-code SaaS I love working with. The average contract a SaaS has with independent contracts is relatively low, so I'm aware that this can end anytime soon. The other 25% came from a local marketing agency and a few smaller projects. Here is another mistake ... months with no payment. Total revenue in 2022 ☝ Last year, I had two months with zero revenue. I had to slightly overcharge in the following months to compensate for this loss. I learned my lesson; I only had one month with no revenue this year. Total revenue in 2023 ☝ I noticed that January started quite shy, but the next couple of months made up for it, so it wasn't a big deal, more time with my family. With a new baby coming in mid-January, I expect the same slow growth at the beginning of the year but solid growth starting in March.",
