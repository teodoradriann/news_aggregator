    "text": "Рекордная продажа марсианского метеорита вызвала международный скандал\nНа престижном аукционе Sotheby's в Нью-Йорке был продан крупнейший из известных марсианских метеоритов весом 25 кг. Стоимость покупки составила рекордные 5,3 млн долларов. Однако уникальная сделка вызвала волну возмущения и юридических споров.\nМетеорит под названием NWA 16788 обнаружили в ноябре 2023 года в пустыне Сахара на территории Нигера. Камень выбросило в космос после столкновения астероида с Красной планетой, и он преодолел 225 млн км, прежде чем упасть на Землю, сообщает Phys.org.\nВ США метеориты принадлежат владельцу земли, куда падают, а вот в Нигере считаются частью культурного наследия страны. Именно поэтому власти африканского государства объявили о расследовании случая контрабанды и временно запретили экспорт метеоритов и драгоценных камней.\nSotheby's утверждает, что все процедуры экспорта были соблюдены. Впрочем, аукционный дом признает необходимость дополнительной проверки обстоятельств сделки. Проблема в том, что международное право не имеет четких норм по этому вопросу, и правовой статус метеоритов варьируется в зависимости от страны, которой они принадлежат.\nЭксперты предупреждают, что подобные аукционы могут стимулировать нелегальный рынок космических объектов, лишая науку бесценных материалов для изучения Вселенной. Уникальный метеорит представляет особый интерес для исследователей, так как содержит ценную информацию о геологии Марса. «Это мировое научное наследие, а не украшение для камина», — заявил ученый Пол Серено.\nTelegram",

    "text": "A Conservative MP has been criticised for suggesting most children who struggle in an English town are the “products of crap parents”. James Daly was accused by his Labour rival of “insulting the parenting skills of people in Bury” after the remark was made in a newspaper piece analysing election prospects for the Greater Manchester town. Mr Daly, speaking to the i newspaper, stressed the importance of “stability” offered by the family unit as he outlined what the New Conservatives group of MPs stands for. The Bury North MP said: “I think New Conservatives represent very much working-class conservatism. “We’re not a strange right-wing sect. It’s just people who want to give people the best chance to succeed and thrive in life. “When you think about the family, it’s about stability. “Most of the kids who struggle in Bury are the products of crap parents and so what do we do to try to address that issue? “On the left it would just be we’ll throw money at this and hope something sticks, somebody like me thinks about this more fundamentally.” James Frith, Labour’s prospective parliamentary candidate for Bury North, said: “It is revealing to see how little James Daly thinks of his own constituents. “Rather than insulting the parenting skills of people in Bury, he should look closer to home. “Over the last 13 years the Conservatives have failed to grow our economy, protect our public services or provide opportunities for young people in Bury and across the UK.”",

    "text": "Staff Reporter\nMountain Hazelnuts (MH) is proud to announce the launch of its domestic hazelnut sales at the Bhutan Innovation Forum, in partnership with CSI Market Bhutan. For an initial period, these premium hazelnuts will be available exclusively at CSI Market outlets.\nWhile MH remains committed to exporting high-quality hazelnuts to international markets, the company believes the domestic market should also have the opportunity to savour home-grown hazelnuts, cultivated without toxins or unethical labour practices.\nThe introduction of hazelnuts to the domestic market isn’t just about offering a new product; it’s about promoting a sustainable approach to farming and living. Our vision is one that honours integrity, preserves Bhutanese culture, and fosters harmony between communities and the natural environment.\n“Around the world, hazelnuts will in the coming years, become one of Bhutan’s most recognized high quality and nutritious agricultural products. It is crucial that hazelnuts are also embraced by the nation and integrated into the food culture to truly represent Bhutan abroad. You are what you eat, and with increasing harvests and this launch, we hope more of the nation does consume our healthy and tasty hazelnuts,” states Dr. Sean Watson, CEO, Mountain Hazelnuts.\nNearly every aspect of the product is Bhutanese, from the nuts themselves to the packaging, reflecting a strong commitment to supporting local agriculture and cultural heritage. This initiative not only provides consumers with a healthy, ethically produced food choice but also strengthens the local economy.\n“Our partnership isn’t just about hazelnuts or market access. It’s a testament to the power of shared vision and collaborative effort. Together, Mountain Hazelnuts and CSI Market exemplify how impact-driven enterprises can pioneer a new economic model for Bhutan, one where prosperity is rooted in sustainability, collaboration, and shared success,” says Sonam Chophel, CEO, CSI Market.",

    "title": "Evening in America: Times Are So Bad, All the Old Campaign Slogans Still Fit",
    "text": "Campaign slogans tend to focus on a single issue, such as an underperforming economy, crime, national security, or the likability of the candidate. But this election cycle is different. The current administration has opened our borders , shredded the value of a dollar, ballooned the debt, undermined America’s credibility abroad, turned a blind eye to crime, and abused the justice system—all at once—giving candidates running for office at any level a wealth of sloganeering opportunities. And there’s no need to reinvent the wheel. For instance, you can see a smorgasbord of options just by looking at winning presidential campaigns going back to World War II. Not all the lines below were official campaign slogans; some were turns of phrase that arose organically and happened to define their times. Unfortunately, pretty much any of them also define our times. The Buck Stops Here (Truman) This might make for a good inflation-related commercial outside a dollar store if they weren’t all going out of business . Originally, it was about accountability, however, which never goes out of style. Until you get elected, of course. I Like Ike (Eisenhower) If your name is Mike, go for it. If not, you can always promise what helped elect Dwight Eisenhower to a second term: “Peace and Prosperity.” Both are lacking these days. A Time for Greatness (Kennedy) The Greeks have a word, kakistocracy, which means government by the worst among us. If that doesn’t describe the current state of affairs in Washington, D.C. , I don’t know what does. America Needs a Change (Goldwater) This line was not from the winning campaign, but the idea is evergreen. Besides, as with “I Like Ike,” Lyndon Johnson’s winning campaign slogan, “All the Way with LBJ,” doesn’t work unless your name is Ray (and these days, I wouldn’t recommend such a turn of phrase). Of course, you could go with Barry Goldwater ’s more famous slogan, “In Your Heart, You Know He’s Right,” or frame your opponent with LBJ’s retort: “In Your Guts, You Know He’s Nuts.” Law and Order (Nixon) At the 1968 Republican convention , Richard Nixon used the promise of law and order to appeal to “the great majority of Americans, the forgotten Americans, the non-shouters, the non-demonstrators.” Yep, that was 1968, not 2024. Four years later, he went with “Now, More Than Ever.” Both shoes again fit. A Leader, for a Change (Carter) Jimmy Carter used the above slogan as well as “Why Not the Best?” and “Not Just Peanuts.” All three work in their own way; the last one referring to what average Americans wish they could still afford. Are You Better Off Than You Were Four Years Ago? (Reagan) This one speaks for itself. As does Ronald Reagan ’s reelection slogan, “It’s Morning in America Again.” The night has gone on long enough. Kindler, Gentler Nation (Bush No. 41) A bit of a stretch these days, but we can always hope. Just don’t say anything beginning with, “Read my lips …” That didn’t work out so well. It’s the Economy, Stupid (Clinton) It is the economy, stupid. Again. Compassionate Conservatism (Bush No. 43) The only problem with this slogan was its presumption that conservatism needed an assist. There’s nothing more compassionate than preserving, protecting, and defending what makes for human flourishing. Change We Can Believe In (Obama) This year’s presidential race is a faceoff between two people who have already held the office, so their likelihood of success can be evaluated based on records, not rhetoric. I can’t see either one using this slogan, however, and you might want to stay away from it as well. The country is still smarting from the last time we heard it. Make America Great Again (Trump) The former president aims to “Make America Great Again” again. If you count Reagan’s original use of the slogan in 1980, this year’s campaign is the third iteration, so it’s “Make America Great Again. Again. Again.” But MAGAAA may be a little much (and doesn’t fit so well on a cap). As you can see, candidates running for office in these tumultuous times have a lot of options. Let’s hope they use them to good effect so we can turn things around soon. Otherwise, slogans going even further back will again become relevant: If the bug-eaters at the World Economic Forum have their way, any candidate that promises “A Chicken in Every Pot” will get my vote. We publish a variety of perspectives. Nothing written here is to be construed as representing the views of The Daily Signal.",

Crews assisted two occupants to walk from the vehicle to dry land.\nThis morning (December 29), at 6.20am, fire crews from Easingwold attended an incident on Thornton Bridge in Boroughbridge, which saw firefighters help a man to safety after his car had become stuck in floodwater.\nMeanwhile, several properties in the region were flooded during the last three days of changeable weather.\nOn Thursday (December 28), fire crews attended a house on High Lane in Buttersett, near Hawes, where a fire crew from Hawes responded to a report of flooding in a residential property.\nCrews diverted water away from the property and then attempted to unblock drains to assist in averting the flooding.\nIn the aftermath of the floodwater, North Yorkshire Police has issued some advice to drivers about navigating roads in challenging conditions.",
