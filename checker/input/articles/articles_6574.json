    "title": "As migration increased in 2023, so did pressures on the church's ministry",
    "text": "Unauthorized border crossings increased in 2023, fueled in part by shifts in U.S. policy and global migration trends. The year saw increasingly heated anti-immigrant rhetoric and actions that also put Catholic Charities agencies -- and the church's religious freedom to minister to migrants -- in the crosshairs.\nIn fiscal year 2023 (Oct. 1, 2022-Sept. 30, 2023), U.S. Customs and Border Protection saw almost 2.48 million encounters at the nation's southwest land border, up from close to 2.38 million in the previous fiscal year. (As defined by the agency, encounter statistics represent the number of interactions between CBP and migrants, not the number of individuals.)\nJ. Kevin Appleby, senior fellow for policy at the Center for Migration Studies of New York and the former director of migration policy for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, told OSV News that \"with a record number of migrants arriving at the border, not to mention a record number of displaced globally, persons fleeing violence and poverty may face increasingly punitive immigration policies in 2024 and beyond.\"\n\"The voice of the Church in defending their rights will become even more crucial in the year ahead, especially in an election year in which anti-immigrant rhetoric will become more commonplace,\" Appleby said.\nU.S. policy on unauthorized migration saw significant changes over the course of 2023.\nTitle 42, a part of the federal health law used by the Trump administration to expel migrants, including those seeking asylum, during the COVID-19 pandemic, was officially ended by the Biden administration in May. But the administration quickly followed it with a policy sometimes referred to as an asylum ban. This policy denied asylum to migrants who arrive at the U.S.-Mexico border without first applying online or seeking asylum protections in a different country and faced legal scrutiny, with a judge blocking it in July.\nIn August, a federal appeals court allowed the ban to remain in effect, and the ban along with other more restrictive immigration measures is back on the table as Republican lawmakers seek tougher immigration policies in exchange for supporting the Biden administration's support for Ukraine amid Russia's ongoing war.\nConstruction on the controversial border wall, initiated under the Trump administration and long opposed by the U.S. Catholic bishops, received a renewed green light from the Biden administration in October, with the president saying that although he did not endorse the wall, the 2019 law passed by Congress upheld the project.\nAmong the state laws enacted this year, Texas adopted SB4, legislation that makes crossing into the state unlawfully a state crime separate from a federal one, and gives state judges the ability to issue de facto deportation orders. Several groups have filed legal challenges.\nTexas and several states also are spending large sums to bus migrants throughout the country, hoping to ease the strain on their local social support resources. However, the practice has drawn both legal challenges and humanitarian outrage, while incurring mounting costs.\nFlorida also enacted new, immigration-focused laws in July. A previous version of that bill directly challenged the church's religious liberty by threatening third-degree felony charges for those who transported or harbored migrants -- a broad net that Catholic and other Christian leaders were concerned would have ensnared the church's established ministries and charitable services to migrants, as well as its ordinary pastoral and sacramental care.\nThis year Catholic Charities USA, which represents a network of Catholic humanitarian organizations in the U.S., had to respond to what it called \"disturbing\" violent remarks by a social media influencer suggesting Catholic Charities' workers and volunteers should be shot for sheltering migrants.\nDisturbing anti-migrant rhetoric also has seeped into the U.S. presidential campaign. At a Dec. 17 campaign event in New Hampshire, former President Donald Trump, who is seeking the GOP's nomination to return to the White House and has made a hardline immigration stance part of his platform, said immigrants coming to the U.S. are \"poisoning the blood of our country,\" pointing to migrants from South America, Africa and Asia. He made a similar post on social media in which he said \"illegal immigration is poisoning the blood of our nation.\"\nThe Biden administration immediately responded that Trump had \"parroted Adolf Hitler,\" referencing Nazi Germany leader's use of the term \"blood poisoning\" in his book \"Mein Kampf.\" On CNN's \"State of the Union,\" Trump GOP rival, Catholic and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie called Trump's words \"dog-whistling to blame it (Americans' stress and strain from the economy and global conflicts) on people from areas that don't look like us.\"\nMeanwhile, a June 2023 Gallup survey found that 41% of Americans said even legal immigration should be reduced, while 68% on the whole said immigration was a positive thing for the U.S.\nAppleby said \"a perfect storm of push factors\" have \"driven migration upward in 2023, including oppressive governments and failed states in our hemisphere.\"\n\"Climate change is another emerging push factor which has compounded the problem,\" he added. \"Until the U.S. and other nations effectively address these root causes, we may continue to see higher numbers at the Southern border. Punitive enforcement policies will not solve this challenge, as the push factors driving people are stronger over the long term.\"\nAmong those push factors are corrupt governments in migrants' countries of origin, gang violence and other types of transnational crime, which work to drive up migration to the U.S.\n\"In Central America, criminal gangs are very powerful and violent,\" Louise Shelley, professor at George Mason University's Schar School of Policy and Government and director of its Terrorism, Transnational Crime and Corruption Center, told OSV News. \"The homicide rates in Central America, much related to gang violence, are among the highest in the world. Individuals are threatened with extortion (and) kidnapping, and are tortured.\"\nGangs in Central America as well as Haiti are \"key drivers\" for migration from those countries, Shelley said, with \"more structured organized crime groups ... present in Colombia and (in) many other countries in Latin American and other regions of the world.\"\n\"In order to leave their sometimes dangerous and desperate situations, many immigrants hire smuggling groups -- often part or related to organized crime -- to protect them and move them to what they perceive will be a better place to live,\" she added. \"As the migrants often do not have the money to pay smugglers all they want, some of the migrants become victims of human trafficking.\"\nOthers who minister to migrants expressed frustration with how the U.S. handles those arriving at its borders.\nSister Rose Patrice Kuhn, an Immaculate Heart of Mary sister who currently ministers to migrants on the U.S.-Mexico border at McAllen, Texas with women religious from several congregations, told OSV News, \"It doesn't seem like there's a real policy to take care of the migrants.\n\"I'm not saying that immigration doesn't take care of them, but I don't know of any political figures that are trying to get bills passed that will make it clear what the policy is in the United States for migrants or asylum seekers,\" said Sister Rose, who works with Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley and with ministries in Reynosa, Mexico. \"It doesn't seem like anybody's really pushing to take care of the people ... so that they will know what's happening in their life.\"\nMany of those arriving at the border have experienced physical and sexual violence, as well as kidnapping for ransom, said Sister Rose, who sees anywhere from \"300 to 1,000 migrants\" per day at the humanitarian respite center operated by Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley.\nSister Rose added that migrants crossing directly through the Rio Grande to enter the U.S. \"have nothing with them but the clothes on their back.\"\n\"They have nothing,\" she said. \"I mean, they come to us in Catholic Charities, and they don't have a comb; they don't have a brush; they don't have a toothbrush; they don't have shoes. Most of them have flip-flops at this point. Socks have been given to them here. When they cross the river, they have nothing -- positively nothing. And a lot of times they have no place to go and no relatives that are going to help them.\"\nAs 2023 drew to a close, lawmakers in Congress failed to conclude negotiations on an emergency spending bill to provide billions of dollars in wartime aid to Ukraine and Israel, with Republicans demanding strict new policies at the U.S.-Mexico border in exchange, drawing concern from Catholic bishops and migrant advocates as the White House searches for a deal in 2024.\n\"Recent policy proposals that would undermine respect for the sanctity of human life, including that of the humble migrant seeking asylum at our border, remind us of the perils of our own culture, in which hope and unity collide with an abundance of fear and division, often yielding indifference to our shared humanity,\" Bishop Mark J. Seitz of El Paso, Texas, chairman of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' Committee on Migration, remarked in a Dec. 12 statement marking the feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe.\nBishop Seitz, at the very beginning of the year, had met with President Joe Biden during the latter's brief visit to the U.S.-Mexico border, urging him on behalf of the bishops to reverse course on the country's migration policies. He added, \"As Catholics, we affirm and defend an unconditional respect for human life and dignity, no matter the circumstance.\"",

    "text": "JUEVES, 15 de agosto de 2024 (HealthDay News) -- La Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) tomó el miércoles la inusual decisión de declarar un brote africano en curso de viruela símica como una emergencia de salud global.\nUn nuevo clado (cepa) del virus, además de su preocupante propagación por la República Democrática del Congo (RDC) y los países cercanos de África central, impulsó la declaración, dijo el director general de la OMS, el Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\n\"La detección y la rápida propagación de un nuevo clado de viruela símica en el este de la RDC, su detección en países vecinos que no habían reportado previamente la viruela símica, y el potencial de una mayor propagación dentro y fuera de África es muy preocupante\", dijo en un comunicado de prensa de la OMS.\nSegún los Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades de África, el nuevo brote ha provocado más de 17.500 casos confirmados y presuntos de viruela símica y 524 muertes en 13 países, algunos de los cuales nunca antes se habían visto afectados por la enfermedad.\nLa mayoría de los casos se han producido en la República Democrática del Congo, y las mujeres y los niños menores de 15 años parecen ser los que corren mayor riesgo.\nLa cepa recién detectada aún no se ha identificado en casos fuera de África.\nPero los Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades (CDC) de EE. UU. emitieron una alerta la semana pasada que aconsejó a los proveedores de atención médica que estén atentos a la nueva cepa de viruela símica en pacientes que han estado recientemente en la República Democrática del Congo (RDC) o en cualquier país vecino (Angola, Burundi, África Central).\nAun así, \"debido al número limitado de viajeros y a la falta de vuelos comerciales directos desde la RDC o sus países vecinos a Estados Unidos, el riesgo de importación de viruela símica del clado I a Estados Unidos se considera muy bajo\", añadieron los CDC.\nLa declaración de la OMS del miércoles tiene como objetivo alentar a las agencias de salud de los países de todo el mundo a estar en alerta máxima por los casos locales, y ayudar a suministrar vacunas, tratamientos y otros recursos a las naciones en desarrollo más afectadas por la enfermedad.\n\"Necesitamos una acción internacional concertada para detener este brote reciente y novedoso\", dijo al New York Times Gregg Gonsalves, epidemiólogo de la Universidad de Yale que formó parte del comité de viruela símica de la OMS en 2022.\nEl anuncio de la OMS se produce tras una declaración el martes de los Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades de África de que el brote es una \"emergencia de salud pública de seguridad continental\".\nEs la segunda vez en tres años que la OMS designa un brote de viruela símica como una emergencia sanitaria mundial.\nEn julio de 2022, un brote que se originó en África se propagó por todo el mundo, afectando a casi 100,000 personas, sobre todo hombres homosexuales y bisexuales en 116 países, y matando a unas 200 personas, reportó el Times .\nLo preocupante del nuevo brote es que la tasa de mortalidad vinculada a la nueva cepa de la enfermedad parece más alta: alrededor del 3 por ciento de los infectados han muerto, en lugar del 0,2 por ciento observado en el brote de 2022.\nLa viruela símica se transmite por contacto cercano de piel a piel, incluidas las relaciones sexuales. Se caracteriza por una erupción dolorosa en las manos, los pies, el pecho, la boca o los genitales, así como fiebre, síntomas respiratorios, dolores musculares e inflamación de los ganglios linfáticos.\nExiste una vacuna, Jynneos, que puede proteger a las personas en riesgo de la viruela símica.\nLa vacunación más el cambio de comportamiento entre los hombres homosexuales y bisexuales, el grupo más afectado en Estados Unidos por el brote de 2022, ha hecho que los casos de viruela símica en Estados Unidos caigan de más de 30,000 en 2022 a 1,700 en 2023.\nPero el virus está cambiando: los científicos descubrieron en 2023 que la viruela símica ha adquirido mutaciones que le permiten propagarse más fácilmente entre las personas. La transmisión sexual, a menudo a través de la prostitución heterosexual, es uno de los principales conductos de infección en África.\n\"Creo que aprendimos mucho sobre la velocidad con la que este virus puede propagarse\", dijo al Times Anne Rimoin, epidemióloga de la Universidad de California, en Los Ángeles. Formó parte del panel de viruela símica de 2022.\nLa República Democrática del Congo sigue siendo el epicentro del brote africano, pero el país aún no ha puesto en marcha un plan de inmunización. Dos vacunas, Jynneos y una vacuna japonesa llamada LC16, han sido aprobadas en la RDC para combatir la viruela símica, según el Times .\nLas vacunas donadas están llegando a África, pero los CDC de África han dicho que se necesitarán más de 10 millones de dosis para controlar el brote.\nLa Dra. Nicole Lurie es directora ejecutiva de preparación y respuesta de la Coalición para las Innovaciones en la Preparación para Epidemias, una organización sin fines de lucro que financia el desarrollo de vacunas.\nEn declaraciones al Times, dijo: \"Este brote ha estado latente durante bastante tiempo, y continuamente hemos perdido oportunidades para cerrarlo. Estoy muy contento de que ahora todo el mundo esté prestando atención y centrando sus esfuerzos en esto\".\nMás información\nObtén más información sobre la viruela símica en los Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades (CDC) de EE.
