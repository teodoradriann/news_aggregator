    "text": "Supreme Court sounds conflicted over Trump criminal immunity Published in [News & Features](/currentnews/newsheadlines/) WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court appeared conflicted over how to handle Donald Trump’s claim that his presidency shielded him from federal prosecution during oral arguments Thursday in a case almost certain to shape this year’s presidential campaign. The justices explored the breadth of the criminal case alleging Trump masterminded an effort to overturn the 2020 election, the most high-profile case of the court’s term because it could determine whether he will face trial before the November election. Across nearly three hours, justices on the conservative-controlled court drilled into the arguments on both sides and did not appear to unite around a single decision. As much as the justices seemed to agree there are some actions for which a president could not be charged, they appeared aligned that a president would not have absolute immunity as Trump had argued. They repeatedly mused on complicated constitutional questions and ways to handle the case. Several times justices raised the possibility that they would remand the case to the district court for further decisions on legal questions —an outcome that likely would delay the trial for the former president and current presumed Republican presidential nominee. The justices are set to issue the decision in the case by the conclusion of the court’s term at the end of June. Trump wants the court to overturn a unanimous decision by a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit that found Trump did not have immunity from criminal charges and that any criminal immunity that applied to a current president would not apply to a former one. Justices on the liberal wing of the court uniformly pushed back on Trump’s arguments for absolute immunity from prosecution; those on the conservative majority repeatedly questioned how much the precedent set by Trump’s case would be open to abuse in the future. Trump attorney D. John Sauer agreed that former presidents could face prosecution for purely private acts, ones that were not tied to official presidential actions. And Michael Dreeben, attorney on behalf of special counsel John L. “Jack” Smith, said there were some acts so “core” to the president’s powers such as pardons that Congress could not criminalize. “This case has huge implications for the presidency, the future of the presidency and the future of the country, in my view,” Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh said to Dreeben at one point. ...continued ©2024 CQ-Roll Call, Inc., All Rights Reserved. Visit cqrollcall.com. Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

    "text": "Lleva al Parlamento varias iniciativas para exigir que vuelva a O Salnés La campaña de recogida de firmas sigue vigente y llevan algo más de 2.000\nResponsables del BNG ayer en Vilagarcía. | FdV\nLucía Romero\nVilagarcía 03 JUL 2025 6:00 El BNG exigirá en el Parlamento la devolución de la ambulancia medicalizada a O Salnés tras su traslado a Sanxenxo para el verano y que, en todo caso, se dote a esta localidad de una propia. Y es que rechaza los argumentos ofrecidos por la Consellería de Sanidade: «Esto no es una decisión sustentada en criterios sanitarios, es puramente política y porque Telmo Martín tiene muchísimo peso dentro del PP », apuntó César Rajoy, que es técnico sanitario y acompañó a los nacionalistas.\nLa comitiva estuvo formada por representantes de toda la comarca y encabezada por l a diputada Montse Prado que defenderá sus reclamaciones en la cámara gallega, donde además, registrarán las firmas recabadas hasta ahora –unas 2.000–, así como las conseguidas en estos días, pues la campaña continúa.\nEl BNG acusa a la Xunta de realizar nuevamente este movimiento –desde 2019–por la concentración de turistas que registra Sanxenxo en verano. De hecho, consideran que la solución es sencilla: que «refuercen la zona de costa con otra ambulancia, pero quitarla de su base, en el Hospital do Salnés, para trasladarla en Sanxenxo es una decisión injustificada, temeraria y negligente que pone en riesgo la salud y la vida de los vecinos de O Salnés. No son ciudadanos de segunda, no tienen menos importancia que los turistas . Esperemos que no suceda un desenlace fatal porque no llegue a tiempo, pero si pasa, responsabilizaremos directamente al PP», declaró Prado.\nEl 061 consuma un verano más el traslado de la UVI móvil a Sanxenxo\nTambién aseguró que la preocupación es palpable entre la población, que lo ven cuando recogen las firmas: «Los vecinos son conscientes y te cuentan casos cercanos». De hecho, los nacionalistas consideran que la Consellería de Sanidade es «consciente» de que la comarca «queda infradotada», pues «la inmensa mayoría de los vecinos no tienen una segunda residencia en la costa y en verano siguen en sus casas, aquí, en la comarca». Es más, creen que durante su visita el pasado martes a Vilagarcía el conselleiro, Antonio Gómez Caamaño, «asumió que la decisión era incorrecta, pues dijo entender y compartir las reivindicaciones».\nDel mismo modo, Prado negó que «esto suceda en otros sitios como dijeron, porque no conocemos otro caso» y Rajoy también se quejó de la gestión del servicio intrahospitalario. También quisieron dejar claro que comprenden la necesidad de cubrir el crecimiento poblacional en la época estival, pero «esta solución no arregla nada, simplemente es para contentar a un gobierno local de color amigo», abundó el portavoz de Cambados, Liso González.\nSobre las iniciativas, la diputada detalló que el asunto irá tanto a la Comisión Quinta de Sanidade como al Pleno y «a ver qué votan. Todo el mundo se va a retratar». Asimismo denunció que, en general, la Xunta «no t iene garantizada la atención sanitaria este verano».",
