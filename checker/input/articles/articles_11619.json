    "text": "Kempton Tips: D’Orhy the pick for classy Silviniaco Conti Chase\nI can't believe I'm saying this given the amount of weather-related abandonments recently, but it's currently Good to Soft (Good in places) on the Chase Course and Good to Soft (Soft in places) on the Hurdle Course ahead of Kempton's seven-race meeting on Saturday.\nOne of the highlights on the card is a classy renewal of the G2 Silviniaco Conti Chase - and the first of my two selections comes in that very spectacle.\n14:07 - Pic D'Orhy @\n11/4\nThere may only be five runners, but this renewal of the G2 Silviniaco Conti Chase is top-class.\nFirst and foremost, I want to oppose Joseph Patrick O'Brien's Banbridge. He's the unexposed type in the field, but ultimately he's yet to achieve anything that compares to the form of the three older horses - and maybe even Notlongtillmay - and doesn't deserve to be favourite in my book.\nEdwardstone ought to make a bold bid as he steps up in trip for the first time over fences, but I'm backing Pic D'Orhy to go back-to-back.\nPaul Nicholls' nine-year-old won this race last year - admittedly a much weaker event - by 16 lengths and warmed up for his defence with a triumph by the same margin in the 1965 Chase at Ascot that Shishkin famously refused to contest.\nKempton is a track he excels at, he will cope with the unexpected conditions better than most and Nicholls reckons this is his best chance of a winner on the day.\nDespite conceding three and six pounds to Banbridge and Notlongtillmay respectively, I think he's got an excellent chance of extending his impressive record in open chases to six wins from seven starts.\n15:50 - Rare Edition @\n10/11\nThe final race on the card is a 0-140 handicap hurdle over two miles - and this time I'm siding with the favourite Rare Edition.\nCharlie Longsdon's seven-year-old made a pleasing return from a 246-day layoff when a fast-finishing third in a competitive heat at Doncaster in mid-December, which resulted in no change to his mark of 136.\nProviding he improves as expected for the run, he could prove much too good for this modest-enough field off that rating.\nReturning to Kempton - the scene of his seven-length demolition of the now 149-rated Rubaud last season - and the booking of the brilliant Harry Cobden are two more positives, so it's fair to say he has plenty going for him here.",

    "title": "Despite DeSantis opposition, Florida House passes university presidential search bill",
    "text": "TALLAHASSEE — Amid fierce opposition from Gov. Ron DeSantis, the Florida House on Wednesday approved revamping laws about leadership of the higher education system, including opening information about applicants to become college and university presidents.\nThe House voted 104-8 to pass the bill ( HB 1321 ), which would repeal a 2022 law that provided exemptions to public records and public meetings laws for presidential searches . It also includes ending the state university system Board of Governors’ role in confirming presidential selections made by university boards of trustees and trying to limit the influence of the governor and other officials on presidential selections.\n“We have a fantastic education system,” bill sponsor Michelle Salzman, R-Pensacola, said. “This is not about what we have. This is about showing the voters what we’re doing. This is about transparency in government.”\nBut DeSantis, during an appearance Tuesday in Pensacola, blasted the proposed changes and raised the specter of a veto if the bill passes. He said he needs to have authority to make sure universities “don’t run off the rails.”\n“It removes the ability of us to ensure that we’re holding universities accountable,” he said.\nSalzman said the bill is not an attack on DeSantis. But it came amid clashes between the House and DeSantis on a series of issues — and after former lawmakers in recent years have been appointed to lead several colleges and universities.\nLast month, House Speaker Daniel Perez, R-Miami, went before the Board of Governors to support the bill and compared the college and university presidential search process to a “spoils system.”\nAmong the selections in recent years, former state House Majority Leader Adam Hasner became president of Florida Atlantic University; former House Speaker Richard Corcoran became president of New College of Florida; former Rep. Mel Ponder became president of Northwest Florida State College; former Rep. Tommy Gregory became president of State College of Florida, Manatee-Sarasota; and former Rep. Fred Hawkins became president of South Florida State College.\nIn February, former Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nuñez , also a former lawmaker, became interim president of Florida International University. In addition to Florida International, the University of Florida and Florida A&M University are operating with interim presidents, and University of South Florida President Rhea Law has announced she is stepping down.\nUnder the 2022 law providing public records and public meetings exemptions, identifying information about most presidential applicants is not disclosed, though information about finalists for the positions is made public.\nSupporters of the law argued that it was needed to help attract top candidates who might be hesitant to apply for Florida president jobs if their current employers could find out.\nRep. Mike Caruso, a Delray Beach Republican who opposed the bill Wednesday, questioned what had changed since 2022. He said the law was about balancing transparency and the need to attract candidates.\nSalzman said lawmakers supported the 2022 law after receiving assurances that information about the top three finalists for presidencies would be made public. But she said the way the process has played out “created a huge level of distrust” among people across the state.\nCurrently, university boards of trustees pick presidents, but the Board of Governors must sign off on the picks. The bill would eliminate the Board of Governors’ role in giving approval.\nAlso, it would set term limits for members of the Board of Governors, the State Board of Education and university and college boards of trustees. The State Board of Education oversees the college system.\nIn addition, the bill would prevent the governor and other state officials from discussing vacancies or advocating for presidential candidates with members of the Board of Governors, the State Board of Education and university and college trustees.\nSalzman described that as imposing a “cone of silence” on officials during presidential searches.\nA similar Senate bill ( SB 1726 ) has cleared two committees and would need approval from the Rules Committee before it could go to the full Senate.\nIn addition to Caruso, the House bill was opposed Wednesday by Rep. Wallace Aristide, D-Miami; Rep. Ryan Chamberlin, R-Belleview; Rep. Tom Fabricio, R-Miami Lakes; Rep. Yvonne Hinson, D-Gainesville; Rep. Chip LaMarca, R-Lighthouse Point; Rep. Patt Maney, R-Shalimar; and Rep. Kiyan Michael, R-Jacksonville.\nBy Jim Saunders, News Service of Florida",

    "text": "In the 6th match of the World Championship of Legends (WCL) 2025, AB de Villiers turned back the clock with a breathtaking display of power-hitting against India Champions. Showcasing the flair and timing that defined his prime, the South African legend lit up the stage with a vintage knock that left fans thrilled and bowlers searching for answers.\nAB de Villiers rolls back time with a blistering knock\nComing out to bat on number 4 in the first innings, de Villiers, at 41 years old, rewound the clock with an innings that was a masterclass in modern T20 batting. Leading South Africa Champions against India Champions, he blazed an unbeaten 63 runs off just 30 balls, including 3 fours and 4 towering sixes, at a staggering strike rate of 210.\nWhat truly set his performance apart was the sheer variety and audacity of his stroke play, a hallmark of his prime. Even at this age, de Villiers unleashed his signature shots with remarkable precision and power. Spectators were treated to classic sweeps that defied field placements, audacious inside-out drives over extra cover, perfectly timed lofted pulls that sailed over the ropes, and effortless straight drives down the ground. His ability to manipulate the field and find gaps with such a diverse range of strokes left the Indian bowlers without answers, solidifying his status as ‘Mr. 360’ and proving that age is merely a number when talent and innovation align.\nHere’s the video:\n𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗽 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝗰𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗹, 𝗔𝗕 𝗱𝗲 𝗩𝗶𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗷𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗻𝗲𝗱 𝗯𝗮𝗰𝗸 𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲 🤯\nThe 🐐 just showed that he's still got it, smacking 63* off just 30 balls 🙌\n[#WCL2025][#ABDevilliers][pic.twitter.com/oRvezMqzQ1]— FanCode (@FanCode)\n[July 22, 2025]\nAlso WATCH: South Africa Champions prevail over West Indies Champions in thrilling bowl-out after the match ends in a tie\nIndian batting falters under pressure\nMeanwhile, the defending champions, India Champions, had a dismal outing on Tuesday while chasing a daunting target of 209 runs. The Indian batting lineup crumbled under pressure, losing wickets at regular intervals and failing to build any momentum. Robin Uthappa, Shikhar Dhawan, and Ambati Rayudu fell cheaply, while only Stuart Binny showed some fight with an unbeaten 37 off 39 balls. Yusuf Pathan fell to a stunning relay catch by de Villiers and Sarel Erwee. The middle and lower order offered little resistance as Imran Tahir and Aaron Phangiso ran through the lineup, sealing a dominant 88-run win.\nAlso READ: Pakistan Champions decline points share after India’s withdrawal from the WCL 2025 clash",

    "title": "The Almeida government hires Senator Maroto's husband for a freely appointed position for which 23 candidates applied - The Limited Times",
    "text": "The mayor of Madrid, José Luis Martínez-Almeida, has hired José Manuel Rodríguez Carballo, husband of the first vice-president of the Senate, Javier Maroto (PP), in the City Council. Carballo, as EL PAÍS has learned, started working at the Cibeles palace in October. His position is that of deputy director general of Analysis and Evaluation, which reports to the delegate of Urban Planning and Environment, Borja Carabante, Almeida's right-hand man in the municipal organization chart. The salary of Rodríguez Carballo, a career civil servant who has worked in the City Council of Durango (Bizkaia) for almost 10 years, is around 90,000 euros gross per year, as it is a specific position for category A public employees, belonging to Group 30 of the public administration. A total of 23 people opted for this freely appointed position, according to municipal sources. This newspaper has contacted Maroto by telephone, who has referred to the explanations given by the Madrid City Council.\nA spokeswoman for the Consistory explains by telephone that a \"public, free and transparent\" call was opened for this position where \"any official\" who met the requirements to cover a level 30 could apply. \"Carballo, a career civil servant and level 30 who has been consolidated for more than 15 years, applied for it,\" he says. \"After studying the candidacies, after a report from the governing bodies to which the position of free designation is assigned and certifying all the services rendered, Carballo was elected to the post.\"\nAccording to the information gathered by this newspaper, the Madrid City Council announced the position of Deputy Director General of Analysis and Evaluation in the area of Mobility and Urban Planning in the middle of summer, on August 4. The position was open to all career civil servants at level 30, but the position, according to the Consistory's work portal, was freely appointed. Therefore, the person in charge of the area decides who finally occupies the position based on their curriculum. In this case, the decision corresponded to the then general coordinator of Mobility, Federico Jiménez de Parga, a former deputy in the Assembly of Madrid and a strong man in the PP in Madrid. Jiménez de Parga resigned in October. The City Council, in response to questions from this newspaper, then replied that his departure was due to \"personal reasons\". Two months later, it became known that Jiménez de Parga had resigned from the position of general coordinator of Mobility because he had tested positive in a breathalyzer test on the streets of the capital.\nThe start of the application for the post of Deputy Director-General for Analysis and Evaluation began several days after the call, on 11 August, and ended on 1 September. According to the municipal file, anyone who applied for the position should have \"experience in coordinating work teams, supervising or carrying out innovation projects, strategic planning and environmental sustainability and the 2030 Agenda\". The text ended with a notice of the schedule that the person who wanted to apply for the position would face: \"A more dedicated working day may be required.\" The place was finally awarded to Carballo, who was among the 23 candidates.\nThe award was published in the Madrid City Council Bulletin on the 22nd of the same month. All appointments by the Madrid City Council are published on the Transparency portal, as in this case. However, in Rodríguez Carballo's profile, neither his salary nor his CV still appear, despite achieving the position in September. The calculation of the approximate gross 90,000 euros corresponds to the sum of the different amounts offered by the Madrid City Council for this type of civil servant.\nRodríguez Carballo holds a degree in Economics and Business Administration from the Universidad Comercial de Deusto and is a career civil servant. According to his LinkedIn profile, he has worked as a manager at the Durango City Council (Bizkaia) from 2008 to 2017, 9 years and 10 months. Among other jobs, he has also worked as head of business with clients at the consulting firm Accenture (from 2020 to September 2023) and as deputy general manager of Local Recruitment and Training at the National Institute of Public Administration (between 2017 and 2019). Carballo married Javier Maroto, the current first vice president in the Senate, in 2015. The PP politician was also mayor of Vitoria between 2011 and 2015. Subsequently, he was deputy secretary general of his party under Mariano Rajoy. From 2019 to 2023 he also served as speaker in the lower house. Now, since August and after the changes of Alberto Núñez Feijóo, Maroto serves as first vice president in the Senate.\nJavier Maroto has criticized political nepotism at different times in his career. In 2015, when he was deputy secretary of the PP, he criticized Manuela Carmena, then mayor of the capital. Carmena had appointed Luis Cueto, her nephew-in-law, as general coordinator of the Mayor's Office. \"[Naming a relative] is not doing politics in any other way, but it's the worst thing about the caste,\" Maroto said. In November 2022 and, as stated on the website of the Popular Party, Maroto made another speech in the Senate where he criticised the government of Pedro Sánchez and his advisers: \"There has never been such a large government, not only because of the number of ministers, but also because of the number of advisers, collaborators and other staff, appointed with blatant family and partisan nepotism.\"\nDo you have more information?

    "text": "欧洲债务压力显现：欧盟计划提高免签国游客入境费用\n财联社6月19日讯（编辑 马兰）根据一项正在拟议的计划，欧盟考虑向部分外国游客征收新的入境费用，以偿还2021年因新冠疫情而发行的3500亿欧元共同债务的一部分。\n几位欧洲外交官透露，欧盟委员会可能在7月16日提出预算提案之前，正式提出将欧盟入境费提高到7欧元以上的措施，这是欧盟新推出的欧洲旅行信息和授权系统 (ETIAS) 计划的一部分。\n据报道，自2026年最后一个季度起，ETIAS将适用于与欧盟签有免签证协议的60个国家，其中包括美国和英国。这项费用的任何进一步上调也将同样适用于上述国家。\n而这一收费对英国来说可能影响最为巨大，因为英国脱欧已经导致英国居民进入欧盟实面临着更长的申请排队时间和更多的限制。一些分析人士还指出，新的收费可能也将对英国与欧盟之间的关系缓和造成阻碍。\n支持者与反对者\n欧盟轮值主席国波兰在一份内部报告中写道，入境费有可能逐步提高，以增强长期收入潜力。一些支持者指出，7欧元的费用远低于英国和美国的同类收费。目前，英国的电子旅行授权费为16英镑（18.71欧元），而美国为21美元（18.32欧元）。\n然而，无论这笔钱以何种方式进行征收，其规模相较于新冠债务来说仍不过九牛一毛。假设欧盟自2026年开始征收入境费用，其每年可能只能产生不到10亿欧元的收入，而欧盟从2028年开始需要每年偿还250亿至300亿欧元。\n德国已经表明了其对入境费用计划的反对态度，认为其将影响游客前往欧洲旅游。据欧盟委员会估计，到2027年，将有多达5000万旅客支付该费用。\n英国国会议员Mark Francois则指出，这只会让英国政府与欧盟重新建立亲密联系的努力变得尴尬。此前，欧盟承诺将简化英国游客入欧盟的手续，但Francois认为新费用证明英国游客将快速通关进入欧盟的承诺在很大程度上非常虚无。\n与此同时，为了应对庞大的债务压力，欧盟还在讨论其他额外征税措施，包括对数字和加密公司、航空公司或者跨国公司的利润征税，但这些方案通常面临着更加强有力的反对，批评者威胁其将导致投资者离开欧洲。\n责任编辑：于健 SF069",

    "title": "Dementia-friendly ward opens at South Tyneside Hospital as NHS trust aims to improve experience",
    "text": "A completely dementia-friendly ward has been unveiled at a hospital in the North East.\nSouth Tyneside and Sunderland NHS Foundation Trust is working to improve the experience of older people when they need to stay in hospital. They are planning a series of refits using features proven to have a calming influence or help avoid confusion.\nWard 8 at South Tyneside District Hospital in South Shields is the first dementia-friendly ward to be completed. Colour-coded bays and bright yellow toilet doors are among the design choices made to help older patients.\nColours are used to help direct patients to different areas\nThe ward was previously used during the pandemic as an Intensive Care Unit but was freed up after a £3m replacement was set up on its ground floor. It has now become a Care of the Elderly ward.\nThe new dementia-friendly design choices include:\nWalls painted in pastel colours to create a calm environment\nDiffused lighting to reduce shadows, which can cause people to trip or cause upset if someone is experiencing hallucinations\nColour-coded bays which are blue on one side and green on the other, helping patients identify their own bed more easily if they are returning to their space\nToilet doors painted in bright yellow, with images added so those who struggle with words know where to find the loo\nEntrances to each room or bay are painted their own colour and are numbered to help guide people to where they are recuperating\nDoors to staff areas and the rooms beyond are painted white, so they blend in with the main corridor\nThe design has been led by Chris Cairns, the Trust’s Nurse Consultant for Older Persons. He worked alongside CHoICE, the Trust’s subsidiary which runs its facilities, as the estates team worked on the transformation of the previously white-beige ward.\nDifferent colours have been used to help set out different sides of each bay\nHe said: “We’ve worked hard to incorporate many features into the refit of this ward, putting research into practice to help keep them safe. We know staying in hospital, which is somewhere unfamiliar and can be quite busy, is an unsettling time for anyone if they’re feeling unwell or recovering from an injury or surgery.\n“We know it’s extra hard for those who have dementia, are experiencing delirium or maybe struggle to see or hear as well as they once did. Now it will be very clear which areas are for them.\n“Even something as simple as being able to say to someone, ‘Your bed is in the green area’ will be much easier for them to understand than if we point to numbers or words.\n“We’ve already used diffuse lighting in other areas and we know it helps because patients don’t think they’re going to trip over what is really a shadow or think it’s something it’s not if they are experiencing delirium.\n“Now the ward is finished, I think it looks really good, it’s bright, modern and will be a real asset to our Trust. Most of all, it will make a difference to our patients.”",

    "title": "No 'blind eye' to Philippine provocations - Chinadaily.com.cn",
    "text": "No 'blind eye' to Philippine provocations Ministry rejects Manila's claims on Ren'ai Reef, calls its actions dangerous China \"will not turn a blind eye\" to the Philippines' repeated provocations and harassment in the South China Sea, although the nation is always committed to resolving differences through dialogue and consultation, a spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense said. Wu Qian, the spokesman, made the remarks on Thursday at a news conference in Beijing, rejecting the groundless accusations made by the Philippines regarding China's Ren'ai Reef. Several Philippine officials have recently claimed that China Coast Guard vessels used water cannons to attack Philippine ships near the reef and rammed at least one of them, triggering regional tensions. In addition, the Philippine side has accused China of using a \"long-range acoustic device\" and a laser weapon to attack crew members on Philippine ships. Calling these allegations completely false, Wu said the Philippine side, in disregard of repeated warnings from the Chinese side, insisted on sending vessels to intrude into the adjacent waters of China's Ren'ai Reef and provocatively rammed a China Coast Guard vessel. \"Such behavior is very dangerous and extremely unprofessional,\" Wu said, emphasizing that China Coast Guard took necessary law enforcement measures, which were totally justified and legitimate. He said that although the Philippines claimed it was transporting humanitarian supplies to its grounded warship near the reef, those Philippine resupply vessels actually carried journalists, who propagated plenty of disinformation. \"In my view, it was not a humanitarian mission at all, but playacting in the name of humanitarian aid.\" Wu said the Philippines' allegation that China used so-called sonic and laser weapons is entirely groundless, adding that China has no intention or need of using such devices. \"China is always committed to resolving differences through dialogue and consultation and making joint efforts to maintain maritime stability, but we will not turn a blind eye to the Philippines' repeated provocations and harassment,\" he said. The spokesman also rejected as unfounded the accusations made by the United States regarding China's actions in the South China Sea, and demanded that the US immediately cease meddling in South China Sea affairs. Recently, the US Department of Defense said the US and Philippine military are maintaining close consultation, reaffirming the US' \"ironclad\" commitment to upholding its obligations under its mutual defense treaty with the Philippines. Wu said that China has indisputable sovereignty over the Nansha Islands, including Ren'ai Reef, and their adjacent waters. He pointed out that the US, to serve its own interests, encourages and provokes the Philippines to infringe upon China's rights and interests, while attempting to coerce China by using the US-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty. \"The issue of Ren'ai Reef is a matter between China and the Philippines, with no involvement of any third party,\" he said. \"We urge the US to stop inciting and supporting the Philippines' provocative actions, and to take practical actions to uphold regional peace and stability.\" Responding to a question on the recent video call between the chiefs of staff of China and US militaries, the spokesman said it has yielded \"positive and constructive outcomes\". Last week, General Liu Zhenli, chief of the Joint Staff Department of the Central Military Commission, held a video call with General Charles Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the US military. \"The two sides exchanged candid and in-depth views on implementing the important military-related consensus reached between the two heads of state in San Francisco, and on other issues of common interest,\" Wu said. \"Going forward, we expect the US side to work with us in the same direction and take concrete actions on the basis of equality and respect, in order to promote the sound and steady development of China-US military ties.\" Wu also slammed the comments made by the defense authorities of the Taiwan region, who recently claimed that during the Taiwan regional leader election next year, the Taiwan military will remain on high alert, and closely observe the dynamics of the People's Liberation Army. Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party authorities have deliberately hyped up the so-called mainland military threat and played up tensions for the sake of seeking electoral benefits, Wu said, noting that \"the PLA is in control of all dynamics of the Taiwan military\". \"We will, as always, take all necessary measures to resolutely safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity,\" he added.
