    "text": "Loose Steering Wheel: Causes & Solutions When your steering feels loose. Don’t panic or ignore it either, it means that your steering wheel has more play or movement than it should have before the wheels turn. The loose steering wheel can be caused by some basic problems. Let’s delve into this topic and find out the reason and solution for the issue. Understanding the Steering System Ever wondered how cars respond so well to the driver? it’s because of the steering system. Invented in the 50s of the 19th century, up to now, the car steering system is still constantly being improved to give a better driving experience to drivers. The car steering system plays a pivotal role in controlling the direction of the vehicle’s movement. The structure of the steering system is very complex, divided into many component clusters and parts but still interconnected and mutually supportive. A proper steering system mechanism is necessary to effectively control the vehicle with safety during its entire speed range without much effort. The structure of the steering system includes: - Steering wheel - Steering shaft and column - Tie rods, rack - Idler arms - Pitman’s arm - Drag or center link. Knowing the structure of the steering system will help you understand how important the steering wheel is in the steering system and the vehicle. The steering wheel is a part of the steering system, helping the driver easily change direction when driving and perform several other operations through basic buttons. So let’s move to the next part to find out what causes loose steering wheel ? >> Related post: Steering Wheel Returns To Center After Turn – Know The Reason Here! Why Does My Steering Wheel Feel Loose? Driving the loose steering wheel can feel wiggly or turn more readily (or farther) before the wheels react when the steering wheel is loose. This extra play or looseness can make the steering wheel feel unresponsive, vague, and less conducive to driver control. There are some common loose steering wheel symptoms you shouldn’t ignore: - Difficulty maintaining a straight path - Excessive play or movement in the steering wheel - Vehicle pulling to one side - Vibrations from the steering system What are the culprits behind these problems? - Over time, the various parts of your steering system can wear down causing excessive play in the wheel like a loose steering nut. The steering nut, which physically fastens the steering wheel to the steering column, is located behind or beneath the airbag. The steering nut can occasionally come loose. Worn ball joints are also the reason for the loose steering wheel. The steering system contains numerous ball joints. Ball joints provide a pivot point for each front wheel to pivot, or turn upon, as the steering system turns the front wheels left and right and the control arms move up and down. Ball joints are a significant part, but they deteriorate over time, they become loose which can create a vibration that you can feel through the floor or the steering wheel while you drive. - Broken pitman arm: Pitman arms connect the steering linkage to the steering column and support the other end of the linkage from the idler arm. This part typically lasts the lifetime of a car, but if one starts to deteriorate, it can cause everything to feel a little sloppy and impair steering. Additionally, improper wheel alignment can put added stress on the steering mechanism, resulting in a loose feeling when you turn. For hatchbacks or sedans, MC Pherson front suspension is often used, combined with a rack-and-pinion, hydraulic, or electric power steering system. This connection provides high performance and if the system fails, it is usually because the rotor is damaged or worn out. How To Fix Loose Steering Wheel? Steering wheel slippage can occur while driving on the road, changing direction, and detecting a problem with the steering system, sometimes when your car is standing still, even though you try to steer, you discover a noise and the steering wheel shows signs of slipping… Regardless of the situation, your car needs to be checked, and find a solution. We’ve pinpointed the potential causes of the loose steering wheel. Now, we will equip you with simple solutions to regain control of your steering wheel: To adjust the loose steering wheel, the driver can take the following steps: - Put the car in park mode and make sure the brake is activated - Check the power steering fluid level and ensure it is adequate - With the steering wheel in the middle, pull and push it to the right and left to check for looseness. If you feel the looseness is large, you can make corrections. - Adjust the looseness by removing the steering wheel protective cover and using a wrench to adjust the torque of the steering wheel shaft. - When finished, reinstall the steering wheel protective cover and check the steering wheel again before driving. Please note that to ensure safety, steering wheel adjustment should be done by people with experience or training in vehicle repair. Besides these steps, you can try to fix it by other methods: - Fasten loose components: Take a wrench and check for any loose bolts or connections in your steering system. Tightening them up will help eliminate excess play in the wheel. - Check steering column: Pop the hood and check the steering column for any signs of looseness. If you detect any play, you may need to tighten or replace the fasteners holding it in place. - Wheel alignment: Go to your local mechanic or auto shop to get your wheels properly aligned. This not only improves steering responsiveness but also prolongs the tire lifespan. >> Read more: How To Unlock Steering Wheel Without Key?

To avoid the situation of loose steering wheel, car owners should maintain the car on time and check the steering system as follows: - Tightness of steering box, bracket, steering column, and hydraulic power steering system. In case a problem arises, it needs to be fixed immediately or replaced. - If the steering wheel pulley and steering wheel free play exceed the allowable standard, appropriate adjustment is required. - Add oil to the steering joints and adjust the steering wheel accordingly.

    "title": "IDF Says It ‘Failed in Its Mission’ Following Probe Into Killing of 3 Hostages",
    "text": "Following an investigation by the Israel Defense Forces into its killing of three hostages during a rescue mission in the Shejaiya area in Gaza on Dec. 15, the IDF Chief of the General Staff, Herzi Halevi, said on Thursday that it “failed in its mission to rescue” them and “the entire chain of command feels responsible.” The report reads, “An IDF soldier fired toward three figures, identified as threats, and hit two of the hostages who were killed. The third figure fled.” The fighters were then told to hold their fire. “After approximately 15 minutes, the battalion commander heard shouts in Hebrew of ‘help’ and ‘they are shooting at me,’ and gave additional orders to hold fire, calling out in Hebrew ‘come toward us’.” But when the third man, who was injured at this point, walked out of the building he was hiding in, two IDF troops “who did not hear the order due to noise from a nearby tank,” shot and killed him. The IDF’s review stated that the three hostages–Yotam Haim, 28, Alon Shamriz, 26, and Samer Talalka, 22–were unarmed and walking shirtless, with one of them waving a white flag, but they were “standing at a point with limited visibility relative to the position of the soldier that fired the shot.” Aerial footage of the Shejaiya area was attached to the press release with a “blind spot” region from the soldier’s window highlighted. Halevi said, “The shooting at the hostages should not have occurred–this shooting did not match up to the risk and the situation. However, it was carried out under complex circumstances, and in intense combat conditions under a prolonged threat.” The press release cited that forces previously encountered cries of “help” and “hostages” in Hebrew that turned out to be “a terrorist deception attempt,” and the engineering unit accompanying the combat group identified the particular building the three men were hiding in as “suspected of being rigged with explosives.” “We, the commanders, must ensure that the operational instructions are clear,” Halevi added, stressing the need for “improving communication, transferring information from the command to the forces, and reporting on suspected signs of hostages’ presence from the field to the command.” According to The Jerusalem Post , the military wing announced on Thursday that it would not take any action against the soldiers who killed the three abductees, despite them violating rules of engagement by firing on people who presented no immediate danger.

Sin conceder, aclaró que la responsabilidad es absoluta del partido y no de los candidatos ya que es falso cualquier tipo de interpretación que tenga que ver con financiamiento ilegal o con mal uso de recursos y no les corresponde ninguna a las \"corcholatas\".",

    "title": "Luis Díaz punishes wasteful Arsenal and seals Liverpool’s FA Cup progress",
    "text": "Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian\nIt was one of those days when Arsenal might have played for another 90 minutes and failed to score. It was so deeply frustrating for Mikel Arteta and the home support. The sting in the tail, however, would devastate them, sparking boos at full-time and the sense that the club have stumbled into a mini-crisis.\nLiverpool’s joy knew no bounds. There had been the sense that this FA Cup tie was more important for Arsenal, given the form that they had taken into it – three Premier League defeats in five. The need for them to recover momentum was greater. Liverpool, sitting pretty at the top of the table, had the security of their shot at Carabao Cup glory; they face Fulham in the semi-final, first-leg at Anfield on Wednesday.\nIt was Liverpool who rode out the Arsenal storm or, to put it another way, watched them repeatedly lack ruthlessness in the areas that mattered the most – an increasingly worrying trend. And then they hit them hard.\nThe opening goal was a body blow for Arsenal, Trent Alexander-Arnold whipping in a free-kick from the left on 80 minutes and Jakub Kiwior, under no huge pressure, directing an attempted clearing header into his own net.\nThe die was cast. Top of the league at Christmas but now down to fourth, Arsenal have had a sinking feeling. Luis Díaz pushed them down even further when he lashed into the near top corner on the break at the very end. In terms of the title race, this was Liverpool laying down a marker ahead of their return here in the league on 4 February. Yet progress in the cup still matters. And they did it without Mohamed Salah, who is on Africa Cup of Nations duty.\nArteta had described last Sunday’s league defeat at Fulham as the low point of the season, a “painful and sad day,” and he got a reaction from his players, Arsenal storming out of the blocks, the flashing lights on the underside of Bukayo Saka’s boots not the only eye-catching detail. He would change into a more conventional pair later in the first-half.\nMartin Ødegaard should have scored on 11 minutes after Saka robbed Joe Gomez and Arsenal worked the ball into the area. The shooting opportunity opened up only for Ødegaard to thump the ball off the crossbar.\nIt was not the only good chance that Arsenal created in the early running. Arteta had started Reiss Nelson ahead of Gabriel Martinelli on the left and there was Nelson in the second minute, streaking on to a long ball by the club’s domestic cup goalkeeper, Aaron Ramsdale. Nelson got around Alisson but he was forced too wide and shot into the side-net.\nNelson would see another effort deflect wide while Kai Havertz worked Alisson with a curler after a lovely touch by Ødegaard. It was possible to wonder from an early juncture whether Arsenal would live to regret their profligacy.\nThe major team news item had been Liverpool’s loss of Virgil van Dijk to illness. Jürgen Klopp started with Jarell Quansah in what was pretty much his strongest available lineup. Anybody who wanted evidence of the strain on the club’s resources needed only to look at the substitutes’ bench which was heavily stocked with youngsters. Conor Bradley and Bobby Clark would get on.\nArsenal drew breath before pushing again. Arteta played Havertz in the No 9 role in the absence of the injured Gabriel Jesus and he had decent chances to score before the interval. Twice, Havertz dallied before shooting without much conviction and Arteta was howling when his player levered Quansah out of the way on a corner only to direct a close-range header wide. Ben White had won it when he forced Alisson to tip over his rising drive.\nIt was practically all Arsenal in the first-half and yet Liverpool, for whom Darwin Núñez had glanced wide following a 22nd minute corner, almost stole the lead at the end of it. Alexander-Arnold ran on to an inviting ball up the inside right and unfurled a venomous shot that made a serious mark on the crossbar. Alexander-Arnold had done something similar in the 1-1 league draw between the teams at Anfield before Christmas.\nArsenal, wearing an all-white kit as part of their No To Red anti-knife crime initiative, had to think that Liverpool would push more in the second-half. Their inability to find a way past Alisson in the first period also had to be on their minds.\nIt turned into a psychological test, as much as anything else, and it was draining just to watch Arteta on the touchline. He went through all kinds of agonies and they resumed after the interval when Odegaard released Havertz and he stood up a cross for Saka at the back post. Saka could not sort out his feet and volleyed high. Moments later, following a deflected Havertz cross that Alisson clawed away, Saka shot wastefully.\nKlopp reshuffled. On came Diogo Jota in the No 9 role, Núñez moving to the left. On came Ryan Gravenberch as the left-sided No 8, Curtis Jones moving to No 6. Slowly but surely, Liverpool set about advertising the breakthrough.\nNúñez missed a pass to Díaz on the break. Jota sliced from left to right and fed Díaz, whose low shot was brilliantly saved by Ramsdale. From the ensuing corner, Jota rose to head against the crossbar. Arsenal looked out of ideas. They would be floored by the late goals.",

    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\n[#1](c1#c-1) Esta gente siempre ha existido, simplemente ahora tienen un altavoz mas grande y les hacemos caso en vez de simplemente decirles que son homófobos.\n[#2](c2#c-2) [#5](c5#c-5) [#1](c1#c-1) [#3](c3#c-3) [#4](c4#c-4) Pues no. Es muy insultante que porque dos personas sean homosexuales, el estereotipo es que su hijo puede ponerse tutus de ninia. Eso si que que es un estereotipo insultante... basicamente estan llamando a los padres: \"fags\".\nY lo peor es que lo que implica es que los padres gays son unos carcas al poyectar en su hijo estereotipos de genero tan rancios como que se ponga el vestido de bailarina.\nLo de \"se quien quieras ser\", eso ya es para que les quiten la custodia a ellos y a todos los glipollas/os que dicen esas gilipolleces y no han leido que a los ninios/as hay que ponerles limites. O van a ser como la panda de \"ninos con problemas de percepcion de la realidad\" de 11-12-13 anios que se mato a principios de los 80 porque querian volar como el Gran Superheroe Americano.\n[#10](c10#c-10) Pues no se por que. O sea, que eres un homofobo, para empezar. Y ademas te gustan los estereotipos de genero machistas.\nCuando yo erea un adolescente nos enseniaron a no juzgar y normalizar la homosexualidad y el lesbianismo porque los homosexuales y lesbianas eran personas normales que podian tener hijos y adoptarlos. Este vide es completamente lo contrario. Es precisamente lo que decian los homofobos hace 20 anios.\n[#12](c12#c-12)\nAnda ya.\nYo soy gay, y padre. Y si mi hijo quiere vestirse con un tutú, no veo el problema, no va a dejar de vestirse así porque a ti te parezca mal.\nEres un plumofobo.\n[#14](c14#c-14) Pos muy bien, pero esto es que como los padres son gays el ninio tiene que ser trans. Vamos, precisamente lo que defendiamos hace 20 anios que eso no pasaba y era discriminatorio, que los padres homosexuales y lesbianas podian tener hijos o adoptarlos.\nNo es que se ponga un tutu... eso lo hemos hecho todos... es que se lo ponga y los padres refuerzen los esterotipos de genero de hace 30 anios como algo \"bueno\". A mis hijos/as les he enseniado que no hay cosas de ninios o ninias.",

Tra questi, il Hàkarl islandese, ovvero lo squalo fermentato dall’odore pungente di ammoniaca, il Ttongsul coreano, un vino di riso fermentato con feci umane. Il museo, fondato per far riflettere sul relativismo alimentare, inserisce il casu marzu come rappresentante dell'Italia tra i cibi considerati “disgustosi”.\nNon è la prima volta che il casu marzu finisce sotto i riflettori internazionali. Già nel 2008 il Guinness dei Primati lo aveva definito “il formaggio più pericoloso del mondo”, sottolineando il rischio che le larve sopravvivano alla digestione e possano causare disturbi intestinali. Un’affermazione priva di solide basi scientifiche. Nel 2005, infatti, lo studioso canadese Massimo Marcone , docente presso la University of Guelph in Ontario, aveva analizzato campioni di casu marzu e condotto studi microbiologici, arrivando alla conclusione che il formaggio, se prodotto correttamente e consumato con moderazione, non presenta particolari rischi per la salute. La legge italiana vieta la vendita del formaggio con i vermi dal 1962, in quanto il prodotto rientra tra gli alimenti “infestati da parassiti”.\nTuttavia, la sua produzione non si è mai fermata, trovando un florido mercato clandestino. Nel 2004 un comitato di esperti aveva avviato le pratiche per ottenere il riconoscimento della Denominazione di Origine Protetta (DOP), con l’obiettivo di regolamentarne la produzione e renderlo legale. Tra le proposte c’era la creazione di un metodo di produzione in ambiente sterile, studiato dalla facoltà di Agraria dell’università di Sassari in collaborazione con la Facoltà di Veterinaria. L’idea era di controllare il ciclo biologico della Piophila Casei, la mosca casearia responsabile della fermentazione del formaggio, in modo da garantire standard igienici accettabili per la commercializzazione. Nonostante gli studi abbiano dimostrato la possibilità di un casu marzu “sicuro”, la certificazione DOP non è mai arrivata e il formaggio è rimasto ufficialmente fuorilegge. Il casu marzu non è un’eccezione nel panorama gastronomico.\nL’Italia vanta diverse varianti di formaggi con larve, radicate nelle tradizioni locali. Tra questi: il Saltarello, tipico di Udine, il Bross ch’a Marcia (Piemonte), il Robiola Nissa (Emilia-Romagna), il Marcetto (Abruzzo), il Casu Punt (Molise e Puglia), diffuso nelle campagne del Sud Italia, il Casu du Quagghiu (Calabria).\n{\"props\":{\"pageProps\":{\"authorization\":{\"auth\":true,\"count\":0,\"user\":\"anonymous\"},\"article\":{\"type\":\"Articolo\",\"meterLabel\":\"metered Sassari Il casu marzu, il celebre formaggio sardo noto per la presenza di larve vive, è finito tra le attrazioni del Disgusting Food Museum di Malmö, in Svezia, accanto ad altri alimenti ritenuti estremi dalla cultura occidentale.
