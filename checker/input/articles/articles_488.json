    "text": "Fictitious relatives; countless meals; the road to Morocco; and other highlights of recent tax cases.\nKennedale, Texas: Tax preparer Anthony \"Tony\" Floyd, 51, who previously pleaded guilty\nto a $2.6 million tax fraud, has been sentenced to 77 months in prison. He filed some 400 fraudulent returns that included false information designed to inflate refunds. He recruited victim \"clients\" outside big box stores and through other clients obtained victims' personal information, such as income and deduction information, via text or cell phone conversations, rarely meeting clients in person. Floyd submitted the returns without reviewing them with the taxpayer and then diverted all or most of the refund to his own account.\nThe tax filings included falsified W-2s for individuals purportedly working in catering, lawn care, event planning, interior décor and other professions and included nonexistent charitable deductions, non-existent college attendance and fictitious relatives. The tax loss to the U.S. exceeded $2.6 million.\nFloyd was also ordered to pay more than $1.9 million in restitution.\nPhiladelphia: Abdur Rahim Islam, former CEO of Universal Community Homes and Universal Education Companies, has been sentenced to 84 months in prison, to be followed by three years of supervised release, for his convictions on 18 fraud, corruption and tax charges.\nIslam was convicted on charges that he stole more than half a million dollars from the two charities that were established to develop affordable housing and manage charter schools in Philadelphia. The jury also convicted Islam on charges that he bribed the president of the Milwaukee public schools board of directors and cheated on six years of personal income taxes.\nThe jury also convicted Islam and his co-defendant, former Universal CFO Shahied Dawan, of conspiring to defraud the federal government by impeding, impairing, obstructing and defeating functions of the IRS.\nIslam and Dawan used their positions at Universal to pay themselves unauthorized bonuses and to pay Islam \"expense reimbursement\" checks, which included payments for such purely personal expenses as trips to Caribbean resorts, family vacations, travel upgrades, Broadway shows, personal gym memberships, cellphone bills, and countless meals at restaurants with friends and family members.\nIslam and Dawan hid these illegal payments from the IRS, which enabled Islam to cheat on six years of personal income taxes. Islam also bribed Dr. Michael Bonds, the former president of the Milwaukee public schools board of directors, in return for political favors. Bonds has since pleaded guilty to the bribery scheme and awaits sentencing.\nDawan has been sentenced to 18 months in prison, a year of supervised release and a $15,000 fine; he must also pay $196,952 in restitution to the IRS.\nIslam has also been ordered to forfeit $609,651.31 and pay restitution to Universal of $609,651.31 plus attorneys' fees; he must also pay $309,581.66 in restitution to the IRS and a special assessment of $1,800.\nBedford, New Hampshire: Andrew Park, 49, of Bedford, co-founder and CEO of a startup technology company, has pleaded guilty to failing to pay more than $14 million in employment taxes and for not filing personal returns.\nPark was responsible for the company's financial matters, including quarterly employment returns and collecting and paying over Social Security, Medicare and income taxes withheld from the employees' wages to the IRS, as well as the Social Security and Medicare taxes the company owed. He was also responsible for collecting and paying over state and local employment taxes.\nFrom the company's founding in 2014 through the third quarter of 2021, Park withheld these taxes from employees' wages but did not pay them over, nor did he pay over the portion of the employment taxes that the company owed. A payroll service company that he hired notified him that the taxes were due and in more than one instance was notified by an employee that the amount paid to Social Security listed on her W-2 did not match what was reported by the Social Security Administration.\nFrom 2013 through 2020, Park also did not file individual returns despite paying himself a salary of some $250,000 each year.\nIn total, Park caused a tax loss to the IRS exceeding $14 million, as well as additional losses to state and local taxing authorities.\nSentencing is Nov. 14. He faces a maximum of five years in prison for willful failure to account for and pay over payroll taxes and a year in prison for the willful failure to file a return. He also faces additional penalties including supervised release and fines, as well as the payment of restitution to the IRS and other tax authorities.\nHendersonville, Tennessee: Resident Scotty Thomas Lumley has been sentenced to 47 months in prison and ordered to pay $1,198,833.62 in restitution in connection with financial and tax crimes.\nLumley pleaded guilty to federal wire fraud and money laundering charges in 2015. The more recent charges are based on additional federal crimes that he committed between 2015 and 2021.\nBeginning shortly after he was sentenced in 2015, Lumley kept taxes he withheld from his employees' paychecks rather than paying those funds over to the IRS. In 2017, to avoid a tax debt, Lumley told the IRS that the only vehicle he owned was a GMC 3500 with a negative value; in fact he owned a 2012 Ferrari that he sold the following year for $187,000.\nIn 2017 and 2018, Lumley obtained a series of loans in connection with commercial real estate-related businesses he owned. His loan documents falsely claimed his personal net worth exceeded $30 million, including cash of some $630,000. Lumley also did not disclose that he had an outstanding tax liability of more than $119,000.\nHe tricked lenders into providing more than $3.5 million in loans and later provided one bank with additional false personal financial statements purporting to show that his net worth had risen to more than $42 million.\nIn November 2020, after becoming aware of a federal investigation, he flew to Morocco and did not return until extradited in February 2023. While in Morocco, Lumley also used a fabricated purchase order to defraud a Utah company of more than $500,000.\nBartlesville, Oklahoma: Nonprofit exec Deanna Rachel Long has been sentenced to a year and a day in prison for bank fraud and tax evasion.\nIn 2012, the Family Crisis and Counseling Center in Bartlesville hired Long as a manager and entrusted her with accounting and finance functions, including recordkeeping.\nWithin two years of being hired, she began embezzling to fund personal expenses and fuel her gambling addiction. Long embezzled more than $278,000. She also failed to report the illegal income and failed to file federal returns for 2014 through 2022. After leaving FCCC, Long filed false tax forms with her new employer, claiming exemptions to which she was not entitled. Long has been arrested many times for bogus checks and has pleaded guilty.\nShe was also ordered to serve three years of supervised release and to pay $278,257.54 in restitution to FCCC and $96,622 to the IRS.\nPensacola, Florida: Wesner Jean-Pierre, 33, of Orlando, Florida, owner of the tax prep business WJP Financial Services, has been sentenced to 26 months in prison after previously pleading guilty to charges of preparing false returns.\nBetween 2015 and 2019, Jean-Pierre prepared and filed some 1,949 false federal returns for clients. He falsely represented the taxpayers' income, deductions, credits and the refund due.\nHis prison time will be followed by a year of supervised release, and he was ordered to pay $830,840 in restitution to the IRS.",

    "text": "Scorpio Horoscope Today: Welcome to the mysterious depths, Scorpio! You're celebrated for your intense nature, unwavering determination, and the ability to uncover hidden truths. Scorpios love debates, aren't afraid of controversy, and won't back off from any such situation. They also hate people who aren't genuine, and are all about being authentic. Your horoscope delves into your passionate and transformative spirit, offering insights on how to harness your power and emerge from life's trials stronger and more self-aware.\nHere is what is in store for you today:\nFor Scorpio individuals, today holds promising prospects across various facets of life. Those engaged in employment might find themselves in discussions with senior officials or high-ranking authorities. Such interactions have the potential to streamline their tasks, garnering respect and possibly paving the way for promotions. On the entrepreneurial front, Scorpio businesspersons might feel the pressures of unmet profit expectations. However, perseverance remains key. By maintaining a steady approach and exhibiting patience, success will inevitably manifest.\nYoung Scorpios preparing for competitive examinations should remain dedicated and steadfast in their efforts. Wholehearted commitment and rigorous preparation could very well culminate in achieving their desired objectives. Furthermore, to fortify their network, these individuals must proactively engage with peers and cultivate meaningful relationships. Building initial acquaintanceships can later evolve into lasting friendships, which can be beneficial both personally and professionally.\nTurning attention to dietary habits, Scorpios are advised to incorporate more whole grains into their meals today. A balanced intake will not only cater to nutritional needs but also promote overall well-being. On the familial front, families with eligible young individuals might see alliances maturing today, leading to joyous celebrations and contentment. However, in terms of health, Scorpios should remain vigilant about potential digestive issues like constipation.

    "text": "ET Online | Oct 11, 2024, 04:41:53 PM IST 1 / 5 Northern lights illuminate UK skies once again The northern lights, also known as the aurora borealis, lit up the skies across the UK with stunning vibrant colours. Initially expected to be visible only as far south as the Midlands, this breathtaking display reached more regions, marking one of the strongest displays since May, according to BBC Weather. As solar activity winds down, there might still be a chance for those in northern areas to witness the phenomenon on Friday night.\niStock 2 / 5 How are the northern lights formed? The northern lights occur when high-energy particles from the sun collide with Earth's upper atmosphere. These particles, travelling at speeds of up to 72 million kph, are redirected toward the Earth's poles by the planet's magnetic field. This interaction produces a spectacular light show, as these particles cause the atmosphere to emit different colours, depending on the atmospheric gases involved.\niStock 3 / 5 The solar cycle and its impact on auroras The sun undergoes an 11-year cycle, fluctuating between periods of low and high solar activity. Auroras tend to be more vivid and frequent during periods of high solar activity, known as the solar maximum. As we approach the next solar maximum between 2024 and 2025, there are more opportunities for intense auroral displays.\niStock 4 / 5 Tips for viewing the northern lights For the best aurora viewing experience, it's crucial to be in the right location at the right time. The \"auroral zone,\" located around 1,550 miles from the North Pole, offers the highest chance of seeing the lights. Locations like Fairbanks (Alaska), Yellowknife (Canada), Tromsø (Norway), Abisko National Park (Sweden), Rovaniemi (Finland), and various sites in Iceland are ideal spots, and the best viewing time is between September and April, from 9pm to 3am. Always check local weather forecasts, as cloud cover can block visibility. You can also monitor aurora activity using forecasts from the University of Alaska Fairbanks and NOAA. While some recommend avoiding bright moonlit nights, strong auroras can still be visible, and the moonlight can even enhance the experience by lighting up the landscape.\niStock 5 / 5 Auroras beyond Earth Auroras are not exclusive to Earth. They have been observed on planets like Jupiter and Saturn, which have strong magnetic fields. Even Mars, despite its weaker magnetic field, exhibits different types of auroras. Observing auroras on other planets enhances our understanding of this stunning phenomenon and reveals its presence throughout our solar system.\niStock Read more on northern lights Northern Lights aurora borealis UK skies viewing tips breathtaking displays solar activity atmospheric phenomena photography tips best locations Popular Slideshows 9 Ayurvedic secrets to burn stubborn belly fat These 5 stocks' PE ratios are higher than industry PE Clove water: How to make this spray for stronger hair Gainers & Losers: Adani Ports among 6 stocks that hogged limelight today Zomato and 4 other stocks with very high PE ratio How to decide between trading and investing: Which is Better for You?

    "text": "( MENAFN ) In an exclusive interview with RT, Vincent Magwenya, the spokesman for South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, revealed that the South African government has approached the International Court of Justice (ICJ) seeking additional measures to address the humanitarian crisis unfolding in Gaza. Magwenya emphasized the urgency of resolving the conflict in Gaza and preventing a potential famine crisis that could result in significant casualties.\nAccording to Magwenya, South Africa is advocating for measures directed at Israel to avert the emerging famine crisis and facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid to those in need.\nPresident Ramaphosa is actively working towards a \"cessation of hostilities\" and the establishment of humanitarian corridors to ensure the efficient distribution of aid.\nExpressing the government's commitment, Magwenya stated that South Africa is leveraging every available legal means and instrument to put an end to what he described as a \"genocide\" in Gaza. The country is resolute in its pursuit of justice and humanitarian intervention to address the dire situation facing the Palestinian population.\nAddressing the potential impact on South Africa's relations with the United States due to its support for Gaza, Magwenya acknowledged existing differences on various issues between the two nations. However, he emphasized the importance of ongoing dialogue and engagement, drawing inspiration from the teachings of former President Nelson Mandela. Despite disagreements, South Africa remains steadfast in voicing its displeasure with Israel's actions towards the Palestinians.\nThe article explores South Africa's legal initiatives at the ICJ, shedding light on its efforts to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and its commitment to advocating for the Palestinian cause. It delves into the complexities of international relations and the balancing act that South Africa faces as it navigates its stance on the Israel-Palestine conflict.\nMENAFN10032024000045015687ID1107957304\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the information “as is” without warranty of any kind.

    "text": "On June 10, as part of the official visit to France by Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh, Minister of Science and Technology Nguyen Manh Hung held a working session with Institut Polytechnique de Paris (IP Paris).\nMinister Nguyen Manh Hung meets with Institut Polytechnique de Paris. Photo: PV\nDuring the meeting, the IP Paris leadership presented an overview of the institute’s history, operational model, and academic mission.\nFounded in 2019 by decree of the French Prime Minister, IP Paris consolidates six of France’s premier technical institutions: École Polytechnique, ENSTA Paris, Télécom Paris, Télécom SudParis, ENSAE Paris, and the Graduate School of Engineering and Innovation.\nThe creation of IP Paris reflects the French government’s ambition to elevate its global university rankings, particularly in international education performance assessments.\nIP Paris currently houses numerous large-scale interdisciplinary research centers and laboratories. Among its standout models is Hi! Paris - France’s leading center for artificial intelligence and data science.\nAt the session, Minister Hung shared Vietnam’s need for strategic technology development and expressed that IP Paris, with its world-class research infrastructure, is an ideal strategic partner - especially in AI, a sector identified as critical to Vietnam’s long-term growth.\nThe minister also proposed that IP Paris collaborate with Vietnam’s leading ICT universities to co-develop joint graduate programs in science, technology, and ICT.\nThis proposal aligns with insights from Professor Nguyen Van Tam, Acting Head of the Department of Computer Science, Data, and AI at IP Paris, who noted that deep tech sectors now especially require high-level researchers, particularly at the PhD level.\nBoth sides agreed to continue communication via the Science and Technology Representative Office to exchange information and explore concrete cooperation opportunities.\nOn the same day, Minister Hung also joined Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh in a meeting with Vietnamese intellectuals and experts residing in France. At the event, attendees shared recommendations on technology selection, standards development, and talent ecosystem building across key sectors including nuclear energy, semiconductors, railways, and artificial intelligence - contributing to deeper Vietnam-France cooperation.\nIn response, Minister Hung offered insights and suggestions on practical working models that could enable experts and scientists to make more impactful contributions to Vietnam’s science and technology development.\nThai Khang",
