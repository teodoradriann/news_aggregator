    "text": "Moderna delivered better-than-expected profit and sales in the third quarter after an early start to sales of this season’s COVID boosters.\nThe company’s latest COVID shot was approved three weeks earlier than last year, according to a statement Thursday, helping drive product sales up 3.6 percent. Moderna still foresees 2024 product sales of $3 billion to $3.5 billion.\nIt’s unclear whether Moderna will sell as many COVID vaccines as it did last year, but it looks like a “durable and sizable market,” Moderna CFO Jamey Mock said in an interview. “It proves that there’s certainly a patient population that wants to be protected against COVID.”\nInvestors have been spooked since the pandemic by fading sales of COVID vaccines and a slow rollout for Moderna’s only other product, an RSV vaccine. The RSV shot was cleared in May, after customers had ordered rival products, and had just $10 million in sales in the quarter.\nModerna’s shares fell more than 3 percent. The stock has fallen 48 percent this year through Wednesday’s close. It plunged in September after the company forecast 2025 sales below analysts’ expectations and pushed back its target to break even by two years to 2028.\nAdvertisement",

    "title": "Colossal winter storm to unleash snow, ice, severe weather from Plains to mid-Atlantic",
    "text": "By Courtney Travis ,\n3 hours ago Over a dozen states could see travel-snarling ice and snow, while other areas brace for a new round of severe weather as a major storm tracks across the United States.\nA massive storm is expected to bring both wintry and severe weather to millions of Americans as early as this weekend, AccuWeather meteorologists warn.\n\"Over a dozen states are forecast to be impacted by one or more aspects of this storm,\" said AccuWeather Meteorologist Brandon Buckingham.\nThe storm emerging from the Rockies late on Saturday is forecast to deliver a far-reaching swath of ice and snow across the middle of the country while rain and thunderstorms spread across the southern tier of the United States.\nSnow, ice to sweep Central states this weekend The intrusion of bitterly cold, Arctic air into the middle of the country will set the stage for wintry weather in the Plains, starting on Saturday. Snowflakes could fly as far south as northern Oklahoma. Meanwhile, enough snow to shovel and plow will extend for about 1,000 miles from central Nebraska to Ohio through early Monday.\n\"The accumulating snow, which could approach or exceed a half of a foot is expected to bring travel to a stand still in places like Kansas City, St. Louis, Indianapolis and Cincinnati,\" said Buckingham.\nAn AccuWeather Local StormMax™ of 30 inches is most likely to occur somewhere from northern Missouri to west-central Illinois.\nJust to the south, parts of Kansas, Missouri, Illinois and Indiana are forecast to experience ice mixing with snow during the storm, which can limit the amount of total snow accumulation. A difficult battle between warm and cold air will determine exactly how much snow, versus ice, falls in some areas like Kansas City and St. Louis in Missouri. A change of just 20-30 miles farther south with the track of the storm could result in much more snow and less ice.\n\"A major freezing rain event is expected to unfold, making for dangerous ice accretions across the northern Ozarks, middle Mississippi Valley and Ohio Valley this weekend,\" Buckingham said.\nCommunities from Springfield, Missouri, to Lexington, Kentucky, could be in for a substantial amount of ice that brings dangerous travel conditions. Additionally, this much ice can weigh down tree limbs, increasing the chance for tree damage and resulting power outages.\n\"Power outages, extensive tree damage and lengthy travel days will be a concern in the worst-hit areas,\" said Buckingham.\nThe power could be out for several days in some communities when dangerously cold air invades in the wake of the storm. There may be a great need for shelters to be set up to account for the affected population.\nEven a trace of icing can lead to a coating on cars and cause slippery spots, especially on bridges and overpasses. Untreated roads or sidewalks could be slick for much of the weekend.\nFar-reaching cold following behind the storm could pave the way for more wintry weather in the same zones as January continues.\nSevere thunderstorms to spark again in southern US Some of the same states still reeling from last weekend's severe weather will once again need to watch for severe thunderstorms with the coming storm.\nThe potent storm will bring a clash of cold air in the Plains, and warm moisture from the Gulf of Mexico will help to fuel the severe weather chances on Sunday.\n\"A line of thunderstorms is expected to develop across eastern Texas Sunday afternoon, strengthening as they move into Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi and Alabama through Sunday night,\" said AccuWeather Meteorologist Gwen Fieweger.\nFieweger also warns that many storms in the Interstate 10 and 20 corridors could bring damaging wind gusts, hail and flooding downpours, but a few thunderstorms may also be capable of producing a few tornadoes.\nHave the app? Unlock AccuWeather Alerts™ with Premium+ Disruptive snow, ice in Northeast and mid-Atlantic to start week After dumping snow and ice across the center of the country, portions of the East Coast will be next to endure the winter weather.\n\"Residents and visitors across the mid-Atlantic states are also in line to deal with the first winter storm in quite some time, posing a major risk to travel between Sunday night and Monday evening,\" Buckingham warned.\nAccumulating snow is expected to reach as far north as central Pennsylvania and extend southward through northern Virginia. Major metro areas such as Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, D.C., can expect several inches of accumulation.\n\"The western suburbs of Baltimore and Washington, D.C., could have snowfall totals nearing half a foot by the end of the storm,\" said Buckingham. The higher terrain in West Virginia and western Maryland are the most likely to see totals near the AccuWeather Local StormMax™ of 15 inches.\nSlippery conditions can be expected as the storm moves into the area, disrupting travel. The heaviest snow late Sunday night and into Monday morning could lead to longer commute times in bustling hubs like Philadelphia.\nLocations across central Virginia and the Carolinas are unlikely to see much snow accumulation, but cold air will create sleet and freezing rain instead.\nSleet and freezing rain are likely to be most extensive near the Appalachians, but the ice could reach the beaches of Virginia late on Sunday night, continuing into Monday before the storm moves offshore.\nLingering cold air in the wake of this storm will likely keep any snow or ice around for several days after the end of the storm. The lack of warm air will also leave open the door for more wintry storms to sweep through the region into mid-January.\nWant next-level safety, ad-free?

    "text": "Most businesses will have to adjust their wage structures in the wake of this April’s national minimum wage rises.\nOrganisations will have to consider the effect on employee retention and overall pay differentials, said an analysis by HR insight firm Brightmine.\nBrightmine’s data shows nearly 60% of organisations will need to raise wages, with three-quarters expecting challenges around pay gaps between job levels.\nFrom 1 April, 2025, the national living wage for those aged 21 and over will rise to £12.21 per hour, while the national minimum wage for 18-20 year olds will increase to £10 per hour and the rate for 16-17 year olds and apprentices will be £7.55 per hour.\nBusinesses will need to head off the risk of employee friction over the changes, said Sheila Attwood, HR insights and data lead at Brightmine.\nShe added: “One of the key challenges is the impact on pay differentials, as lower pay bands catch up with the next job level.\n“Nearly three-quarters (74.3%) of affected organisations expect pay differentials to be squeezed, which can create pay compression issues and potential dissatisfaction among more experienced employees.”\nShe said those organisations that had anticipated the changes were reviewing their pay structures, either by adjusting salaries across multiple levels, defining minimum differentials, or even reshaping their grading systems. “Others are exploring alternative solutions such as upskilling employees, offering bonuses, or enhancing benefits to retain staff and maintain motivation,” said Attwood.\n“Employers need a clear strategy to manage these changes, ensuring they remain competitive while maintaining fair and structured pay progression.”\nFor companies looking to alter wage structures and increase pay, Recruitment and Employment Confederation chief executive Neil Carberry said that, based on poll results from February, business sentiment had improved this spring. This was despite the impact of the national insurance hike hanging over companies “like a fog”.\nHe said REC survey respondents were now optimistic about their intentions to hire permanent staff in the short term.\nCarberry said employers “felt the most confident about medium-term permanent hiring (the next four to 12 months). Medium-sized organisations (50-249 employees) were clearly the most optimistic about permanent hiring”.\nSign up to our weekly round-up of HR news and guidance\nReceive the Personnel Today Direct e-newsletter every Wednesday\nLatest HR job opportunities on Personnel Today\nBrowse more human resources jobs",

    "title": "Supreme Court’s sorry record on elections is bad news for 2024",
    "text": "The famed Chicago columnist Finley Peter Dunne, better known as “Mr. Dooley,” once said to his pal Hennissy, in Chicago Irish dialect, that “No matter whither th’ Constitution follows th’ flag or not, th’ Supreme Court follows th’ election returns.” Well, this Supreme Court, and specifically the Republican majority that has dominated it for the last half-century, doesn’t follow the election returns. It—pardon the expression—screws up U.S. election returns. And it’s not done yet. Who benefits? The ultra-rich and the criminal capitalist class. Who suffers? Workers, women, voters of color, the young, the old, and the rest of us. Starting with Buckley vs Valeo in 1976, the justices have systematically dismantled all protections against corrupt corporate influence on elections, eliminated voting rights, tossed out limits on and disclosure of campaign contributions and spending, and, most recently, [legalized corruption](https://www.peoplesworld.org/article/supreme-court-oks-payoffs-for-politicians-doing-corporate-bidding/). They even picked a president. Remember Bush vs Gore in 2000? The court stopped the vote count in Florida, with Republican George W. Bush in the lead. Bush’s corporate backers wanted that. The Republican-named justices cloak some of their rulings in the garb of freedom of speech, invoking the Constitution’s First Amendment. But—and this is important for workers—free speech for whom? Because when the justices turn the corporate treasuries loose on political campaigns, when they eliminate limits on individual contributions and campaign self-funders when they let shady corporate donors hide behind SuperPACs and supposed “non-profit” organizations, when they bar common methods of absentee voting, when they reject partisan redistricting plans unless they’re racially motivated, and on and on and on, guess who gets frozen out? Let’s start with Buckley, and you’ll see what we’re talking about: That 1976 decision said limits on election spending are unconstitutional. GOP Chief Justice Warren Burger’s court ruled campaign spending limits “contravene free speech because a restriction on spending for political communication necessarily reduces the quantity of expression.” Yes, it does, but only for those who don’t have the dollars to spend…like you and me. We, not the big givers and spenders, get no say. The money men, and they’re almost all white men, do. Even one justice who went along, Democratic-named Byron “Whizzer” White, recognized the danger. White warned his colleagues the post-Watergate Congress “legitimately recognized unlimited election spending as a mortal danger against which effective preventive and curative steps must be taken.” But for White, and the others, supposed “freedom of speech” trumped all. Fast forward 24 years, to Bush vs Gore. Now, they could very well do it a second time in the 2024 election. Guess who their pick will be. Regardless of how they rule, the jurists have legitimized the delay-delay-delay tactics of Republican nominee Donald Trump. That convicted felon, womanizer, and white supremacist demands unlimited immunity from federal prosecution for any crime, in and out of the White House he once inhabited, forever. Just the delay alone—we’ll repeat that, just the delay alone – lets Trump run again, without fear of prosecution. If he wins, he’ll institute his “dictatorship on day one” vow. Nobody believes he’d stop then. First, Trump would shut down federal prosecutions he faces. Then he’d pardon his Capitol invaders. But back to the Supreme Court and what it’s let loose upon us. First, 14 years ago, came Citizens United. That unleashed corporate treasuries, with no limits and no accountability, again in the name of free speech. A right-wing operative, seeking to finance an anti-Hillary Clinton borderline slander, brought the case because his film could be deemed an illegal corporate contribution. It cost too much for the limits. Voila! No more limits. Justice John Paul Stevens, leading the dissenters, called Citizens United “a rejection of the common sense of the American people, who recognized a need to prevent corporations from undermining self-government.” The Republican court majority didn’t listen. Two years later, the justices turned individual campaign donors loose, in a case involving a GOP megadonor from Alabama. In legal briefs, the party gleefully backed him—and won. The U.S. people lost. Then the court gutted key provisions of the Voting Rights Act, especially its enforcement in states, cities, and elsewhere with histories of discrimination. Who got hurt? Women, students, people of color, workers, the poor, and the old. How fast did we lose rights? The Rev. William Barber II, co-chair of the Poor People’s Campaign, said after the justices issued that Holder decision, the gerrymandered GOP-run North Carolina legislature took only “45 minutes” to disenfranchise thousands of voters in his home state. Speaking of gerrymandering, the Republican court majority ignores it in most cases. “It’s a political question,” they declare. Two exceptions: - (a) If it’s based on race, not politics, and - (b) If it’s literally shoved in the justices’ faces. That happened in Alabama and Louisiana, but not—the justices said—in the two Carolinas. Pre-Holder, the Voting Rights Act would have forced the feds to toss all gerrymandering, including both Carolinas and Florida and Texas and Georgia and…and….and…and. Not now. Not content with letting politicians choose their voters, the justices also make it harder for voters to vote. One ruling rejected common methods of collecting absentee ballots, in a case from Arizona. And on June 26, they dealt more carnage to our elections. The court majority [legalized post-election bribery](https://www.peoplesworld.org/article/supreme-court-oks-payoffs-for-politicians-doing-corporate-bidding/), though the Republican justices don’t call it that. They call such payments “gratuities.” Bribes are illegal, the justices said. In most cases, gratuities aren’t, Trump-named Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote. When they are, Kavanaugh called them “two separate crimes” with “two different sets of elements.” The five other Republican-named justices agreed. Even Trump knows there’s no difference. “When you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do,” he said of politicians nine years ago. That’s why Trump, now a politician, promised a quid pro quo of lower taxes and less regulation to oil barons when he met them at Mar-a-Lago in May—if they gave his campaign a billion bucks. The other June ruling, in a small win for sanity, says social media has editorial control over its content. The right wanted to dictate what you see and hear. It lost the case on technical grounds. Of course, the right and the GOP now manipulate social media to toe their line, and shut workers and others out. When they brought the case, they were screaming about corporate censorship via algorithms and government pressure through complaints. You don’t hear them screaming now, not when right-wing multibillionaire Elon Musk imposes his will on Twitter/X. Trump isn’t on the High Court. Yet its justices, including the three he named, by their delays, impose the possibility of a Trump dictatorship, and no more free and fair elections, upon all of us. Does anybody seriously doubt that after all his disproven cries of fraud in 2020 and others as far back as 2016, Trump won’t scream fraud again this year? And if voters elect him, he’ll ensure there’s no future fraud against him. He – and his Trumpites in lower-level offices, from election boards to state courts to governors – will rig the vote. For Trump. Thank you, U.S. Supreme Court. As with all op-eds published by People’s World, this article reflects the views of its author. We hope you appreciated this article.

Historias de millonarios Javier Espinosa llevaba casi toda su vida apostando por los mismos números en la Primitiva, una tradición iniciada por sus padres, hasta que la suerte llamó a su puerta en 2019 y se llevó [80 millones de euros de la Primitiva](/las_provincias_2017/noticias/201901/06/sorteos/la-primitiva/claves-numero-loteria.xml). La combinación ganadora estuvo formada por los números 7, 13, 23, 40, 41 y 49, el complementario fue el 16 y el número clave (reintegro), el 3. Estos 8 números cambiaron la historia de un vecino de Bonrepós que había sellado su boleto en Tarvernes Blanques, junto a Valencia. Javier tenía un negocio familiar dedicado a la venta de materiales de fontanería, con más de 25 años de historia y que había pasado por una grave crisis durante años. Cuando Javier llamó a su novia para contarle la noticia, ella, incrédula, le dijo antes de colgar que fuera a los premios Oscar por su buena interpretación. Javier encargó un Ferrari, un sueño de la infancia, y poco después se construyó una casa en Bonrepós. Sus vecinos cuentan que ya tiene media docena de bólidos y que ha entrado por derecho propio en el selecto 'Club Ferrari' gracias al dinero de la Primitiva. La historia de Rachel Kennedy y Liam McCrohan es de tener mala suerte. La pareja de Inglaterra estuvo muy cerca de ganar 182 millones de euros. Los jóvenes estudiantes participaban siempre en el sorteo de Euromillones y, además, apostaban siempre por los mismos números. No fallaban ningún día, de hecho, tenían configurado una plataforma con la que podían comprar automáticamente boletos cada semana. When your Mrs decides to not play the EuroMillons... and all 7 of her usual numbers come up😭😭£182M Liam M (@LiamMccrohan)[pic.twitter.com/3iXMo38wQG][March 1, 2021] Sin embargo, un viernes no lo hicieron dado que su cuenta bancaria se encontraba sin fondos. «No pensamos que iban a salir», contaron al medio británico The Sun. Estaban equivocados. Cuando revisaron la aplicación, recibieron una notificación con los números con los que siempre jugaban, que estaban configurados. Y vieron que eran los que se habían llevado el mayor premio. Así, se privaron de embolsarse 182 millones de euros, que era la cifra exacta del bote. Rufino se convirtió en el vecino más famoso de Valuengo, un pequeño pueblo de Jerez tras ganar el Gordo de la Primitiva. Se hizo con 5 millones cuatrocientos mil euros. Lo más curioso es cómo se enteró de que era millonario: en el bar y por casualidad. Rufino se tomaba un café en el bar de siempre. Entre los clientes, surgió la conversación que a alguien de la localidad le había tocado el premio del Gordo de la Primitiva. El camarero del local se ofreció a comprobar el boleto de Rufino: «El del Gordo eres tú». Y a partir de ahí, incredulidad general. Nadie en el bar se lo creía, ni el propio ganador. Rufino tuvo un accidente en la empresa en la que trabajaba que le costó tres dedos de una mano y la incapacidad laboral. [Jane Park ganó el Euromillones con 17 años](https://www.lasprovincias.es/sorteos/euromillones/triste-historia-ganadora-euromillones-20190504082822-nt.html). Ahora, cuatro años después, ha desvelado que lo que pensaba que le iba a mejorar la vida, ha conseguido todo lo contrario. De hecho, desea demandar a la Lotería por «arruinarle» la vida. La joven tuvo suerte porque ganó el premio con el primer boleto que compró. La cifra con la que se hizo fue, exactamente, de 1.175.000 euros. Según ha contado en una entrevista del diario Mirror, el premio le hizo perder la cabeza y derrochó el dinero en ropa de diseño, coches y operaciones estéticas. Ahora, reconoce que preferiría no haber ganado el Euromillons porque su vida sería «más fácil». Tal y como ha confesado, a pesar de que tiene mucho dinero su vida está «vacía» y le cuesta mucho encontrar una pareja que no se interese, únicamente, por su dinero. Daniela pasó del cielo al infierno en cuestión de segundos. Cuenta que, como todos los años, su madre le regaló a ella y a sus hermanos un [boleto de la ONCE](https://www.lasprovincias.es/temas/generales/el-cuponazo-sorteo-once.html) del sorteo del 1 de enero. Lo compró en la Avenida del Oeste, el puesto más cercano al Mercado Central. Una tradición familiar. Nunca perdían la esperanza de que algún día fueran los afortunados. Y por fin, el boleto premiado con el número 8290 estaba entre sus manos. A la mujer le habían tocado 400.000 euros. Pero pronto, la que había sido la suerte de su vida se convirtió en una auténtica pesadilla. «Le pedía a mi marido que se acercara a la Delegación Territorial de la ONCE para que se informara de cómo tenía que cobrarlo porque yo no podía ausentarme del trabajo. Le explicaron mal el proceso y le dieron tres folios, uno encima del otro, y no se dio cuenta de que estaba firmando que el boleto era suyo», cuenta Daniela Tucelli entre llantos. Noticia Relacionada Belén Hernández Meses atrás, su marido se había inscrito en el Registro General de Interdicciones del Acceso al Juego (RIAJ). Esto implica que no pueda acceder al juego online y a los juegos de carácter reservado (loterías) que se desarrollan de forma presencial. Por lo tanto, tampoco puede cobrar el cupón premiado. «Mi marido no es ludópata. Se inscribió ahí tras una discusión que tuvimos porque siempre está viendo el fútbol y alguna vez apostaba. Poca cosa. Unos 20 euros. Pero le dije que se inscribiera porque estaba cansada y quería que en mi casa se pudiera ver otra cosa en la tele», dice la mujer desconsolada. Le da miedo las repercusiones que le puedan acarrear a su marido a nivel personal por una acción que fue «una tontería. El resultado de un broncazo». Pero ahora, fruto de esa decisión precipitada, no puede cobrar los 400.000 euros que le corresponden. Ruth Breen, de 39 años, ganó el premio de Euromillones cuando atravesaba una mala racha económica. La británica, matrona de profesión y con una hija pequeña, vio cómo cambió su suerte al ser ganadora del sorteo. No obstante, ella tuvo bien claro que no quería cambiar el rumbo de su vida. Siguió trabajando y utilizó el dinero para llevar a su hija a una buena escuela, para ayudar a su hermano a comprar una casa y para pagar a sus padres un seguro.
