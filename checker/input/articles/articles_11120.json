Причины беспокойства Парижа связаны с его экономическими связями с российским энергетическим сектором. Так, часть акций компании «Новатэк», занимающейся газодобычей в России, по-прежнему принадлежит французской TotalEnergies.

    "title": "Former Oregon high school track coach files suit in wake of trans athlete controversy",
    "text": "Former Lake Oswego cross country and track and field coach John Parks is suing his former employer, alleging that the school district has infringed on his First Amendment and 14th Amendment rights. In a lawsuit filed in federal court on Wednesday, Parks claimed that Lake Oswego School District committed an “unlawful retaliatory investigation and subsequent termination” of his contract after he spoke out against transgender female athletes competing in Oregon high school events in the girls division. Parks is asking that Lake Oswego School District remove the investigation and subsequent termination from his personnel file and employment record; return him to his positions as both cross country and track and field coach, as well as his role as special education teacher assistant at the district. He is also asking the district to declare that it violated his rights under the First Amendment, which protects free speech, and the 14th Amendment, which includes the due process and equal protection clauses, and also pay him damages to be set in a trial. Parks sent a letter to the Oregon School Activities Association earlier this spring, protesting a transgender girl’s participation and asking that the OSAA create an “open” division that allowed transgender athletes to compete separately from their cisgender peers. The Oregonian/OregonLive is not naming the student-athlete to protect her privacy. At the end of the school year, Parks’ contract with Lake Oswego was not renewed. He told The Oregonian/OregonLive that the investigation into him by the district started when Portland Public Schools athletic director Marshall Haskins sent a complaint to the district in May. Haskins’ letter to the district alleged that Parks had contacted coaches and parents from around the state, asking them to demand the OSAA bar the transgender athlete from competition. Haskins also claimed that Parks asked coaches to boycott medal presentations and that he was “riling up” spectators to boo the transgender athlete at the state meet at Hayward Field, among other things. Parks has denied all of the accusations made by Haskins. In the lawsuit, he claims that his communication with the OSAA was not discriminatory. “A staff member’s expression of concern for the welfare of both transgender and non-transgender athletes in a letter to a third party and conversations with third parties does not constitute discrimination prohibited by law,” the lawsuit reads. “The Board’s policy on hazing and harassment, even construed liberally, would not preclude conversations, emails, and letters by staff to third parties where the primary concern is the welfare of all student athletes.” The lawsuit adds that Parks both has had transgender student-athletes on his teams at Lake Oswego High School in the past, as well as transgender family members. The exhibits of the lawsuit include a copy of the letter sent to Parks from Lake Oswego High School Principal Kristen Colyer that detailed the investigation into him after the complaint submitted by Haskins. The letter from Colyer notes that the school district was allegedly able to find evidence of Parks violating multiple school board policies from his actions, including: Sending an email directly to the OSAA as a representative of Lake Oswego School District in an effort to stop the transgender student-athlete from participating in the state meet. Contacting coaches from other schools as the Lake Oswego track and field coach prior to the state meet asking them to also submit letters and emails and call the OSAA office to stop the transgender student-athlete from being allowed to participate at the state meet. Communicated with student-athletes at the state meet, recommending they not participate in the medal presentation if the transgender student-athlete won their events. Spoke with coaches, student-athletes and families before and during the state meet regarding their plans if the transgender student-athlete were to win and be on the podium. The letter also claims to confirm other items from Haskins’ original complaint, which weren’t listed as violations of district policies: Was directed by athletic director Chris Coleman to not discuss issues related to transgender student-athlete participation in events, specifically the state meet. Was insubordinate to that same directive given by the athletic director. Spoke to the transgender student-athlete during the medal presentation for the 400-meter race. The letter includes that it is unclear if the interaction was positive or negative. There were also two items where the school district found no evidence: Spoke to the transgender student-athlete during the medal presentation for the 200-meter race. Riled up state tournament spectators in the stands to boo the transgender student-athlete during the medal presentation. “After reviewing all of the information and circumstances around this incident, there is a preponderance of the evidence that indicates that Coach John Parks was insubordinate and discriminated against the McDaniel High School transgender athlete,” reads the letter from Colyer in the summary after the findings. “This violates board policies AC - Nondiscrimination and JFCF - Hazing, Harassment, Intimidation, Bullying, Menacing, Cyberbullying, Teen Dating Violence, or Domestic Violence.” The lawsuit also contains a follow-up letter to Parks from Colyer that discusses the findings. “As an educational institution, we are committed to providing a safe and inclusive environment for all students,” the letter from Colyer reads. “In light of these findings, the Lake Oswego School District has decided that the District cannot support your actions and behaviors. The length of any coaching contract is for the current season only. Consequently, we will open the cross country and track coach positions for Lake Oswego High School for the 2024-25 school year.” In an appeal of the school district’s decision (also added as an exhibit in the lawsuit), Parks denied the school district’s findings. “The basis of the appeal is that the findings in the letter I was given on June 12, 2024, are not based on fact,” he wrote. Parks did reapply for the open coaching and assistant teaching positions at Lake Oswego High School, the lawsuit states, and his application was denied. The OSAA’s policy allows students to participate in “the athletic or activity program of their consistently asserted gender identity.” The association’s policy is set to align with guidelines set by both the Oregon Department of Education and also federal rules. Parks is being represented by Luke Miller of Miller Bradley Law in Salem, as well as Buck Dougherty from the Liberty Justice Center based in Austin, Texas. ©2024 Advance Local Media LLC.

    "text": "The cost of the European Commission’s new headquarters in Luxembourg has risen to almost €1 billion, nearly twice the original amount agreed for the project close to a decade ago.\nLuxembourg’s State Council, the country’s de facto upper chamber, approved a further €351 million spending increase for the Jean Monnet 2 building on Tuesday, according to a report published on its website.\nThe price tag for the building has been increased twice from its initial budget of €526.3 million and now stands at €992.5 million.\nThe drive for a new Commission building to house most of the EU executive arm’s staff and services in Luxembourg has been in the pipeline for two decades and its scheduled completion has been postponed several times.\nIn 2009, the government signed an agreement with the commission after years of negotiations to pre-finance the building’s cost.\nThe budget was increased to €641.5 million In 2016. The government requested an additional €351 million of funding in a draft law earlier this year, bringing the overall cost to just under €1 billion.\nAll 17 State Council members present for the vote backed the huge increase, the body said.\nThe project was scheduled initially to be completed by 2015, but it faced delays, including as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, Luxembourg’s minister for public works, Yuriko Backes, said earlier this year in a draft bill outlining the requested funding increase.\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine created inflation and supply chain problems, with some contract bids now showing “significant price overruns compared to the tender quotes” from late 2022 and early 2023, Backes said.\n“Market fluctuations and interruptions in supply chains are leading to additional delays in the delivery of materials, not only causing an increase in costs, but also impacting the smooth running of the project,” Backes wrote in her draft law.\n“Faced with these exceptional circumstances, extensions of contractual deadlines have been granted to companies by the government without the application of penalties,” Backes wrote.\nThe seven-storey commission headquarters is now expected to be completed by the end of next year and include space for around 3,600 staff. The building is to include a library, medical centre, catering area, logistics operation and underground car park with 2,000 spaces.",

    "text": "RIO DE JANEIRO, RJ (FOLHAPRESS) – Quase metade dos cancelamentos de voos da ponte aérea no ano passado feitos sob alegação de má condição climática em um dos aeroportos ocorreu em dias nos quais nem Congonhas (São Paulo) nem Santos Dumont (Rio de Janeiro) fecharam um minuto sequer.\nEmpresas aéreas, especialistas e a Anac (Agência Nacional de Aviação Civil) afirmam que a identificação de mau tempo inclui outras variáveis além do fechamento do aeroporto, como modelo da aeronave, certificados dos pilotos e rajadas de ventos momentâneas.\nContudo, o levantamento mostra cancelamentos em dias nos quais tanto Congonhas como o Santos Dumont operavam nas melhores condições climáticas possíveis. Uma das companhias aéreas reconheceu o erro na justificativa dada em um dos casos apontados.\nComo mostrou reportagem da Folha de S.Paulo, as companhias apresentaram no ano passado justificativas divergentes aos dois aeroportos para cancelar voos da ponte aérea. Há também um vácuo na fiscalização dessas informações, já que nenhum órgão do setor assumiu a responsabilidade pela tarefa.\nToda rota de voo utiliza dois slots: um no aeroporto de partida e outro no de chegada. Ao cancelar um voo da ponte aérea, as companhias são obrigadas a apresentar uma justificativa para cada um dos aeroportos por não utilizarem o espaço reservado a elas.\nA cobrança ocorre porque Santos Dumont e Congonhas são considerados aeroportos coordenados, em que há intensa disputa por uma posição a ser operada.\nResolução da Anac exige das empresas um índice de utilização de 80% dos slots. No entanto, não são considerados no cálculo cancelamentos por motivos fora da capacidade de gerenciamento das empresas, como má condição climática.\nDos 2.004 cancelamentos de voos nessa rota, 634 indicaram em ao menos uma das justificativas condição climática adversa no aeroporto de partida ou de chegada (código 71 e 72 da portaria da Anac sobre o tema). O levantamento não inclui mau tempo na rota (código 73).\nNeste grupo, 279 (14% do total e 44% dos cancelamentos por mau tempo) ocorreram em dias nos quais nenhum dos dois aeroportos fechou.\nEntre os 634 voos cancelados com indicação de má condição climática em um dos aeroportos, também foi identificado 368 divergências em relação ao código atribuído no outro ponto da rota (partida ou chegada).\nAlém disso, em 121 desses cancelamentos, o outro código atribuído não confere abono no cálculo do índice (6% do total de cancelamentos ou 19% dos que indicam mau tempo em um dos aeroportos).\nFoi, por exemplo, o que ocorreu com o voo 3916 da Latam, que partiria às 14h do dia 25 de maio do ano passado de Congonhas para Santos Dumont. No aeroporto de partida, a empresa atribuiu o código 99 (“motivos diversos”) para justificar a não utilização do slot causa não abonável no índice de regularidade. No de chegada, porém, incluiu o código 72 (“problema no aeroporto de destino causado por condições climáticas adversas”).\nDados da Rede de Meteorologia da Aeronáutica mostram, porém, que o Santos Dumont operou em condições visuais ao longo de todo o dia são as melhores condições de voo, segundo especialistas ouvidos pela reportagem. Não houve, também, qualquer fenômeno naquele dia que impedisse o pouso.\nAlgo semelhante ocorreu com o voo 1031 da Gol em 29 de março de 2023, que sairia do Santos Dumont em direção a Congonhas às 14h40. A companhia atribuiu o código 72 como justificativa do cancelamento nos dois aeroportos.\nO aeroporto de São Paulo operou ao longo de quase todo o dia em VFR (operação segundo as regras do voo visual), tendo uma leve piora apenas as 17h mais de uma hora depois do horário previsto para pouso do voo. A companhia reconheceu o erro na atribuição do código, mas afirma que o correto seria outra justificativa também abonável no índice de regularidade colisão de aeronave com um pássaro.\nEntre as divergências nas justificativas, há também casos de contradição flagrante. Em 32 voos, o motivo dado para o cancelamento no aeroporto de partida foi má condição climática no de chegada (código 72), enquanto no de destino foi apontado motivo inverso: mau tempo na partida (código 71). Um é da Azul e os 31 restantes, da Latam.\nA indicação de má condição climática em ao menos um dos aeroportos foi mais comum na Azul. Ela aparece em 85% dos 129 voos cancelados nesta rota no ano passado. Neste grupo da companhia, há divergência entre os códigos em 30% dos casos. Em 9%, a outra justificativa dada não confere abono.\nA Latam inclui os códigos 71 e 72 em 44% dos cancelamentos que realizou no período nesta rota. Em 30% houve divergência entre os códigos, e em 10% a outra causa impacta no cálculo do índice de regularidade.\nA Gol foi a que proporcionalmente menos usou condição climática adversa nos aeroportos como justificativa (6% dos cancelamentos).\nO coordenador do curso de Aviação Civil da Universidade Anhembi Morumbi, Alexandre Kaperaviczus, diz que o aeroporto estar aberto não é o suficiente para indicar a possibilidade de pouso e decolagem.\n“Não basta o aeroporto estar aberto. Isso é decisão do piloto. Ele vai analisar os dados meteorológicos. Dentro do avião, ninguém toma decisão se não for o piloto”, afirma.\nAroldo Soares, mestre em segurança de voo pelo ITA (Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica), diz que há aeronaves que têm limitações específicas. Rajadas de vento, mesmo em boas condições meteorológicas, podem impedir a decolagem e o pouso. Ele afirma, porém, que há a possibilidade de uso sem critério da justificativa.\n“Usam esse termo ‘condições meteorológicas’ para tudo, quando na verdade são outros fatores que acabam interferindo.”\nNEM TODAS AS ADVERSIDADES CLIMÁTICAS FECHAM AEROPORTO, DIZ ANAC\nEm nota, a Anac diz que “nem todas as adversidades climáticas se referem à visibilidade mínima, que é o parâmetro típico para que um aeródromo declare operação abaixo dos mínimos”.\n“Condições climáticas adversas abarcam um escopo amplo de incidências climatológicas. Além de chuva forte, são consideradas condições climáticas adversas ventos fortes que possam interferir no equilíbrio da aeronave durante uma manobra de aproximação ou neblinas que prejudiquem a visibilidade, por exemplo”, afirma a agência.\n“O próprio impacto da meteorologia em operações é amplamente relativo e dependerá de aspectos como os procedimentos de segurança operacional da empresa e do piloto que comanda o voo, o próprio horário da operação, entre outros. Trata-se, portanto, de um dado complexo e de avaliação metódica”, diz a nota.\nA agência não comentou os casos de divergência nas justificativas, por afirmar não ter a atribuição para fiscalizar os motivos de não utilização dos slots.\nA Azul afirma que “pousos e decolagens podem ser afetados por uma série de fatores, decisões operacionais da tripulação ou do centro de operações da companhia, seja por ventos fortes, incidência de chuvas, contingenciamento de tráfego aéreo e outros fatores, mesmo que o aeroporto esteja apto e aberto para operações”.\nA Latam diz que “a maior parte dos cancelamentos ocorre por questões alheias ao seu controle” e que registrou “95% de regularidade nos voos da ponte aérea” no ano passado.\n“Quando uma aeronave é impossibilitada de decolar ou pousar em algum aeroporto por situações alheias ao seu controle, como questões meteorológicas ou de infraestrutura, os demais voos programados para aquela aeronave podem ser impactados em uma espécie de ‘efeito cascata'”, diz a companhia.\nA companhia não se posicionou sobre o cancelamento voo 3916 do dia 25 de maio.\nA Gol afirma que voos podem ser afetados por um efeito cascata de cancelamentos causados por má condições climáticas em outros aeroportos motivo não incluído nos códigos 71 e 72, usados no levantamento.\n“Os aviões não estão restritos a rotas específicas diariamente, e entram numa escala conhecida como ‘trilho’, utilizando um jargão do setor aéreo. No mesmo dia, as aeronaves, assim como as tripulações, podem atender de dois a sete aeroportos distintos, obedecendo a um trilho previamente planejado. Essa versatilidade, embora valiosa, também significa que condições adversas em qualquer uma dessas localidades pode impactar negativamente as etapas subsequentes da aeronave”, diz a companhia.\nA companhia, porém, reconheceu equívoco na atribuição do código 72 para justificar o cancelamento do voo 1031 do dia 29 de março do ano passado. A Gol afirma que ele ocorreu em razão da colisão de uma aeronave com um pássaro em Congonhas, o que levou ao fechamento temporário do aeroporto.\n“A Gol salienta que tanto o código 72 (meteorologia adversa no aeroporto de destino) como o 81 (tráfego aéreo) são usados em situações não gerenciáveis pela empresa aérea.”",

    "text": "Prefeito de Belo Horizonte, Fuad Noman é internado pela terceira vez em menos de um mês\nPolítico deu entrada no Hospital Mater Dei, na capital mineira, com quadro de diarreia e desidratação\n[Minas Gerais](/minas-gerais)|Andrea Silva, da RECORD MINAS\nO prefeito de Belo Horizonte, Fuad Noman (PSD), voltou a ser hospitalizado nesta quinta-feira (19), no Hospital Mater Dei, localizado na região Centro-Sul da capital mineira. A Assessoria de Imprensa do Mater Dei confirma a internação e informa, em nota, que o prefeito deu entrada na unidade de saúde com desidratação e diarreia. Ainda segundo o hospital, Fuad está realizando exames para avaliação do quadro.\nA nova internação ocorreu[ quatro dias após ele receber alta](https://noticias.r7.com/minas-gerais/prefeito-de-belo-horizonte-recebe-alta-apos-ficar-nove-dias-internado-16122024/), no último domingo (15) depois de uma semana de internação devido a um quadro de pneumonia e sinusite. No dia, o prefeito reeleito por BH foi liberado para continuar o tratamento em casa.\nAntes desses episódios, em novembro, logo após as eleições, o prefeito já havia sido internado ao sentir fortes dores nas pernas. Exames realizados na ocasião revelaram uma neuropatia periférica secundária, uma condição que pode ser consequência de doenças graves, como o câncer — tratamento ao qual Fuad se submeteu no início da campanha eleitoral.\nEm julho, pouco antes de começar a campanha das eleições municipais deste ano, Fuad Noman tornou público que estava enfrentando um linfoma não Hodgkin - câncer que afeta o sistema linfático. Ainda sim, ele atuou pessoalmente na campanha de sua candidatura. Em 15 de outubro, antes do segundo turno das eleições, ele comunicou à imprensa que havia alcançado a remissão total da doença.\nDiplomação\nQuanto à cerimônia de diplomação, ocorrida nesta quinta-feira (19), no Tribunal Regional Eleitoral de Minas Gerais (TRE-MG) em Belo Horizonte,[ Fuad Noman não pôde estar presente](https://noticias.r7.com/minas-gerais/prefeito-fuad-noman-e-representado-por-procurador-geral-em-diplomacao-no-tre-mg-19122024/) devido à sua condição de saúde. Em seu lugar, o procurador-geral do município, Hércules Guerra, representou o prefeito e recebeu o diploma que formaliza a sua eleição perante a Justiça Eleitoral.",
