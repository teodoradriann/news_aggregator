    "text": "Arina Rodionova has claimed the scalp of one-time Australian Open champion Sofia Kenin in an energy-sapping 7-5 7-6 (9-7) win at the Brisbane International.\nThe 34-year-old Australian needed a wildcard to compete at the event but is through to the round of 16 after thwarting and frustrating world No.37 Kenin at every turn at Pat Rafter Arena on Tuesday.\nApologising to fans for clogging up the court and delaying their chance to see Rafael Nadal on his return from injury, the world No.113 outlasted an errant Kenin in a near two-and-a-half hour battle royale.\nRodionova – Australia’s highest-ranked female player – sounded a warning when she broke 2020 Australian Open Champion Kenin in the first set.\nDespite Kenin breaking back Rodionova was able to hang on to take the set.\nBut the ding-dong head to head was typified by the gripping seventh game of the second set which lasted 17 minutes.\nKenin had broken Rodionova’s serve and looked to be on her way to squaring the match and sending it to a third set.\nThe Australian gave Kenin a scare but was left to rue her failure to convert eight break points with her American opponent going 5-2 up.\nHowever, Kenin won the battle and Rodionova the war, with the Australian holding serve either side of a break to force a tiebreak where she calmly eked out victory.\nArina Rodionova thanked fans for their support but playfully said she won’t share her prize money. (Jono Searle/AAP PHOTOS)\n“I’m a little speechless,” Rodionova said before turning to the crowd in Brisbane.\n“I only won because of you guys … but if you think I’m going to share my prize money with you, it’s not happening.\n“It was a great match and I really enjoyed being there … I know you guys are waiting for Rafa tonight but I’m sorry you had to suffer with us.”\nRodionova will play the winner of Liudmila Samsonova and Mirra Andreeva.\nBad weather delayed the start to many of Tuesday’s matches in both the men’s and women’s draw in Brisbane, with former world No.1 Victoria Azarenka in action along with the all-Australian tie between Olivia Gadecki and Kimberly Birrell.",

    "text": "Buenos Aires (EFE).- La líder de la oposición venezolana, María Corina Machado, rechazó este jueves la propuesta de Brasil de que se celebren nuevas elecciones o se forme un Gobierno de coalición, e insistió en que los resultados que dieron ganador a Nicolás Maduro en las presidenciales son fraudulentos.\n“Las elecciones tuvieron lugar y la sociedad venezolana se expresó en condiciones muy adversas, donde hubo fraude y aun así logramos ganar”, respondió Machado en una rueda de prensa virtual con medios en Argentina y Chile, entre los que estaba EFE.\n“Hay que respetar la voz del pueblo, hay que respetar la soberanía”, enfatizó Machado y preguntó: “¿Aceptarían ustedes que se llamara a otra elección en sus respectivos países?”.\nBiden no apoya unas nuevas elecciones en Venezuela, entendió mal la pregunta “¿Si esta es una decisión que se va a tomar en una mesa, para que la hicieron en primer lugar?”, agregó.\nMachado destacó además que “las elecciones las definen los votos, no los acuerdos de cúpulas”.\nLa propuesta de Brasil El Consejo Nacional Electoral (CNE) proclamó a Maduro vencedor, pero Machado insistió este jueves en “la victoria monumental” del opositor Edmundo González Urrutia con 7,3 millones de votos -casi el 84 % de las actas-, contra los 3,3 millones de votos que dijo obtuvo Maduro.\nEl presidente brasileño, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, sugirió este jueves dos posibles salidas a la crisis postelectoral en Venezuela: la formación de un Gobierno de coalición que integre miembros del chavismo y de la oposición o la celebración de nuevos comicios.\nEsta última iniciativa la apoyó su par estadounidense, Joe Biden, pero la rechazó el Gobierno de México, mientras que el presidente colombiano, Gustavo Petro, sugirió para Venezuela un “frente nacional” como el que hubo en su país en el siglo XX, en el que liberales y conservadores se turnaban el poder como paso “transitorio” hacia una “solución definitiva” a la crisis.\nLa líder opositora de Venezuela María Corina Machado habla durante una protesta en rechazo a los resultados oficiales de las elecciones presidenciales -que dan la victoria al presidente Nicolás Maduro-, en Caracas (Venezuela). EFE/ Ronald Peña R. “Se va a una segunda elección, y si no le gusta las resultados ¿se va a una tercera, cuarta, quinta, hasta que le gusten los resultados a Maduro? ¿Aceptarían eso en su país?”, se preguntó Machado.\n“Desconocer” las elecciones del 28 de junio “es una falta de respeto a los venezolanos que han dado todo. La soberanía popular se respeta. Las elecciones ya ocurrieron”, afirmó.\nEl régimen se ha negado a negociar la transición Respecto a la idea de un Gobierno de coalición, pidió “tener mucho cuidado” porque diferenció los ejemplos en otros países donde los partidos tienen “diferencias de orden político” pero “han sido democráticos o no han sido involucrados en casos criminales”, de lo que sucede en Venezuela.\nMachado recordó que su agrupación ofrece “incentivos y salvaguardas” a los oficialistas que quieran acercarse a sus filas para lograr una transición democrática de cara a una asunción de González Urrutia el 10 de enero próximo, a los que promete que no habrá “persecución” ni “venganza”.\n“Estamos dispuestos”, pero “el régimen se ha negado hasta ahora” a negociar la transición, señaló.\nLópez Obrador no cree “prudente” pedir nuevas elecciones en Venezuela Después de las elecciones en Venezuela, los Gobiernos de Brasil, Colombia y México iniciaron contactos para encontrar una solución a la crisis, un esfuerzo de mediación que cuenta entre otros con el respaldo de Estados Unidos.\nMachado, “convencida” de que parte de las Fuerzas Armadas venezolanas quieren negociar María Corina Machado se mostró “convencida” de que parte de las Fuerzas Armadas, que apoyan al presidente Nicolás Maduro, son proclives a negociar con su agrupación una transición hacia la investidura de Edmundo González Urrutia como presidente del país caribeño.\n“Hemos sido claros” en la postura de “brazos abiertos” y de “no persecución ni venganza” para los oficialistas, y “eso ocurre también en las fuerzas armadas”, dijo Machado en respuesta a una pregunta de EFE durante una rueda de prensa virtual con periodistas de Argentina y Chile.\n“No hubiéramos podido tener el acceso a las actas si no hubiera habido colaboración de los efectivos”, recordó la líder antichavista, en referencia a que la oposición cuenta con casi el 84 % de las actas, que le permiten afirmar que 7,3 millones de personas votaron por González Urrutia, contra los 3,3 millones de votos a Nicolás Maduro, y así denunciar “el fraude en los comicios del 28 de julio pasado”.",

    "text": "Shows, clima e rotina Confirmada a causa da morte da fã da cantora Taylor Swift no show do Rio de Janeiro: exaustão devido ao calor excessivo – algo lógico, pois ocorreu na onda de calor, evento que deve se tornar cada vez mais frequente no futuro próximo. Este ano, a participação do El Niño potencializou os efeitos desse nefasto evento climático. Novidade? Depende. Para os organizadores do show, foi algo inédito em décadas de atuação. Já para a ONG Amigos da Água, a crise da água e a emergência climática fazem parte do rol de alertas que a entidade emite à sociedade há 24 anos. Organizadores de shows e autoridades terão de incluir em suas agendas de responsabilidade socioambiental a emergência climática a fim de que se tenha mais cuidado na farta e ampla distribuição de água a seus clientes! Rodolfo José Bonafim - Santos Manchete que mancha Veículo jornalístico de grande penetração nacional estampou nesta semana a seguinte manchete: “Natal tem pior venda em três anos, aponta Serasa”. O WhatsApp quase colapsou e os leitores de manchetes fizeram críticas ao governo, pois a manchete dava munição para esses detratores. Algo não batia com tal notícia, pois as vendas on-line estavam no topo das preferências. Pelo que se via nos corredores dos shoppings nos telejornais e se lia, inclusive aqui em A Tribuna, as compras de Natal estavam aquecidas. Mas o mistério foi desfeito, em um trecho perdido no meio de um parágrafo: “compras em cartão de débito ou crédito e Pix não são termômetro nessa pesquisa”. Marcus Aurelio de Carvalho - Santos Remoção de árvore No dia 18, solicitei à Ouvidoria a remoção de um tronco de árvore de cerca de três metros de altura que está infestado de cupins, ameaçando cair sobre os carros ou até mesmo de minha residência. Para minha surpresa, a Secretária das Prefeituras Regionais de Santos indeferiu meu pedido, alegando se tratar de área particular, cujo responsável pelo manejo arbóreo é o proprietário da área. Solicito a revisão do meu pedido, pois a área é pública e a própria Prefeitura podou a árvore anos atrás, deixando somente um enorme tronco, agora condenado e ameaçando cair sobre minha residência. Se a área fosse particular, a Prefeitura não faria melhorias no local nem varreria toda semana o espaço. Silvio Rodrigues - Santos Homenagem Na semana passada, houve uma justa homenagem ao diretor-presidente da TV Tribuna e ex-presidente da Associação Comercial de Santos (ACS), Roberto Clemente Santini. Também merecem os parabéns o artista Paulo Frade, que fez um lindo retrato, agora exposto na galeria da ACS, e a jornalista Ravena Soares, pela reportagem no jornal A Tribuna. Grupo de Proteção da Família e da Cidadania Luisa Baptista O atropelamento criminoso da atleta olímpica Luisa Baptista em São Carlos prova que o crime no Brasil compensa. Quem vai pagar todo prejuízo de uma vida dura dedicada ao esporte? A atleta estava treinando e não media esforços para alcançar suas metas. E agora, ministro da Justiça, que adora dar uma de machão: onde está? O Brasil nunca será sério e os nossos políticos so pensam nos bolsos deles. Zureia Baruch Jr. - São Paulo Resposta Em resposta aos leitores Toshio Shiokawa e Cesar Tavares Cunha, a Prefeitura de Santos esclarece que o projeto Levante a Partir das Calçadas, em discussão na Câmara, foi criado para integrar a ampla política voltada ao resgate da população em situação de rua. A proposta foi inspirada no conceito housing first (moradia primeiro) já adotado em vários países e, inclusive, em cidades brasileiras como Recife e, mais recentemente, São Paulo. O projeto santista será voltado apenas a pessoas em situação de rua já assistidas e devidamente acompanhadas pela Secretaria de Desenvolvimento Social. O benefício mensal de R$ 660 terá destino exclusivo para auxílio-aluguel e estará condicionado à participação nos programas de capacitação profissional realizados nas Vilas Criativas. Nos 12 meses definidos como duração do benefício, estas duas comprovações - pagamento do aluguel e frequência na capacitação - serão feitas mensalmente, além do acompanhamento por psicólogos e assistentes sociais da Prefeitura. Ressaltamos ainda que, inicialmente, serão apenas dez beneficiários e, de acordo com projeto de lei, poderão ser ampliados até o limite de 50. A proposta também resultará economia ao Município, uma vez que cada vaga em abrigo custa, em média, R$ 2,2 mil por mês. Por fim, a Prefeitura destaca que o programa não será uma ação isolada: acontecerá em paralelo às outras ações já adotadas, como a ampliação das vagas em abrigos, reforço das equipes da abordagem social (que podem ser acionadas pelo telefone 153) e o recâmbio qualificado que, só neste ano, já possibilitou que 300 pessoas em situação de rua em Santos retornaram aos seus municípios de origem.
