    "text": "Recommended Stories\nThe regional center of India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Friday issued a yellow warning for the Twin cities of Cuttack and Bhubaneswar for the next three hours. Intense spells of rainfall, accompanied by thunder and lightning may occur in some parts of the cities, it predicted.\n“Intense spells of rain are very likely over some parts of #Cuttack & Bhubaneswar city during the next two hours. Showers just after the Diwali Celebration is like ashirbaad as pollution in the air will get washed away by the rain,” IMD scientist Umashankar Das tweeted on X (formerly known as Twitter).\nThe districts likely to be affected include parts of Khordha (including Bhubaneswar) and Cuttack district including Cuttack City. The yellow warning has also been issued for the districts of Jajpur and Dhenkanal. The weather agency has also forecast light to moderate rain/thundershower at one or two places in the districts of Malkangiri, Koraput, Nabarangpur, Bolangir, Nuapada, Kalahandi, Bargarh, Sonepur, Jharsuguda, Sundargarh, Keonjhar and Mayurbhanj districts.\nLight to moderate rain may continue in North and South Odisha. However, dry weather may prevail from November 3, it was learnt.\nPeople have been advised to keep a watch on the weather and move to safer places accordingly to protect themselves from lightning strikes.",

    "text": "Two relatives of murdered British backpacker Grace Millane have said they are honoured that their work to help abuse victims as a positive legacy in her name has been recognised in the New Year Honours list.\nThe newly graduated university student was strangled to death in a hotel in Auckland, New Zealand, the day before her 22nd birthday on December 1 2018, by Jesse Shane Kempson who she met on Tinder.\nKempson was found guilty by a unanimous verdict in November the following year.\nGrace’s mother Gillian Millane and cousin Hannah O’Callaghan have been honoured (PA) Grace’s mother Gillian Millane and cousin Hannah O’Callaghan, both from Essex, co-founded an organisation in her name called Love Grace, which aims to “empower victims of domestic abuse”.\nThey described their OBEs for services to charitable fundraising and tackling violence against women as an “incredible honour” and dedicated it to Grace, saying she “would have been very proud and keen to get involved with what we are doing”.\nMs O’Callaghan said: “I don’t think she would believe how big Love Grace has become and how many women we can help by offering a bit of normality to.\n“She would have also probably been amused that we have been to Downing Street and are now to meet a member of the Royal Family.”\nLove Grace collects handbags and fills them with toiletries for domestic abuse victims, as well as raising money for White Ribbon charities in the UK and New Zealand, which educate men and boys about attitudes that can contribute to violence against women and girls.\nGrace Millane was murdered (Lucie Blackman Trust/PA) Ms O’Callaghan said: “We wanted to create a legacy in Grace’s memory and directly help women who have been affected by domestic abuse, to turn our negative into a positive.\n“If we help just one woman, then we have achieved that.\n“We have been overwhelmed by the support people have shown our ‘Love Grace Handbag Appeal’, from donating handbags and toiletries, to running appeals in their own area.\n“This has allowed more women to receive a little bit of normality and remind them to believe in themselves as they matter.\n“So thank you to everyone who has donated, and all of our friends & family who have helped us with Love Grace.\n“We would like to accept this award on their behalf and in Grace’s name. We will continue to raise awareness of the issues many face, and make sure that no other family has to go through this.”\nThe handbag appeal started as a practical way for the relatives to try to deal with their grief as “it was very cathartic and allows us to talk about Grace”, Ms O’Callaghan said.\nShe added: “We had no idea how our initiative would take off. It helped that Grace loved a handbag.\n“Detective Inspector Scott Beard (who was part of the murder investigation team) said that each bag was a smile on the face of someone who needs it, so how lovely to think that 16,000 people have smiled because of Grace.\n“We are so proud of the legacy we have created in her memory.”\nThe next step is to try to get charity status for Love Grace, which started with a 50 bag target and is now at 16,000 bags worldwide.\nMs O’Callaghan said: “This will allow us to reach more areas and help offer practical empowerment to more women who need it.\n“Logistics is a key area for development, we rely on volunteers to set up and run appeals and then give back to refuge charities in their local areas. Hopefully we will be able to get our bags further afield.”\nSince Grace was murdered both women have also been fundraising for the White Ribbon charity to help raise awareness of male violence towards women.\nThe body of Ms Millane, who had been on her gap year, was found buried in a suitcase in Waitakere Ranges, a forested area outside the city of Auckland.\nIn February 2020, Kempson was jailed for life with a minimum term of 17 years, with the judge rejecting his argument that the pair had rough sex that went too far.\nHe was later found guilty of raping another British tourist, who he also met on Tinder, eight months before he killed Ms Millane.\nThe rape victim reportedly went to the police after recognising Kempson from media coverage of the death of Ms Millane.\nThe sex offender was also convicted in a separate trial, with a different victim, of threatening to kill, two charges of assault with a weapon, three assaults and two counts of sexual violation.",

    "text": "For over 15 years, we have collaborated with New River College in Islington to inspire students and encourage positive life choices. The school supports young people aged 11 to 16 who have been excluded or are at risk of exclusion from mainstream education.\nMany of these students face significant challenges, including special educational needs, traumatic experiences, and risks of criminal exploitation or gang involvement. Through this partnership, Arsenal’s programmes provide students with opportunities to develop essential interpersonal skills, foster teamwork, and envision brighter futures.\nThe partnership’s impact was recently celebrated during Arsenal’s 3-0 victory over Nottingham Forest, where the school was awarded a No More Red white shirt. This symbolic gesture, now proudly displayed at New River College, reflects the shared commitment to creating opportunities for young people.\nOur No More Red initiative, in partnership with adidas offers vital safe spaces to play sport, access to trusted role models, and a sense of belonging, providing opportunities and access for young people to prosper.\nNew River College’s commitment to its students is further supported by external agencies such as CAMHS, Safer Schools, and Islington Early Help Children’s Services. As a trauma-informed school, it offers a nurturing environment that helps students cultivate positive attitudes towards learning and relationships. The goal is clear: to ensure every student feels safe, valued, and prepared for a healthy, successful future.\nFreddie Hudson, head of Arsenal in the Community said: “Our partnership with Islington alternative education provision stretches back to 2004. Since then, our staff have been a constant presence each week. Working alongside committed New River College staff, we see first-hand the positive learning environment created for students and the important role models we are able to provide together.”\nCllr Michelline Safi-Ngongo, Islington Council’s Executive Member for Children, Young People and Families, said: “New River College provides fantastic support for some of the most vulnerable young learners in Islington, truly making a difference and helping them to achieve their best. This shirt is a symbol of the potent positive impact the college has on young people’s lives, and I can’t think of a more deserving organisation to be the first to receive such an honour.\n“The No More Red programme exemplifies genuine, truly meaningful partnership working; we’re proud and privileged to have Arsenal support us in our journey to make Islington the best place for children and young people to go to school, learn and live.”\nCopyright 2024 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.

    "text": "by Stefan Stanford, [All News Pipeline](https://allnewspipeline.com/Globalists_Program_Us_To_Expect_Heart_Failure_Pandemic_In_2024.php): – Remember Majority Of Democrats Wanted To Put Unvaxxed In Camps While 2023 is finally, and thankfully, coming to a rapid end, a new story has come out [from globalist mouthpieces CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/26/world/2023-year-of-the-brink-intl-cmd/index.html) giving us a taste of what’s to come if the globalists get their way. Titled “How 2023 has been the ‘year of the brink’ and 2024 could be worse,“ the story doesn’t hold back, warning “2024 could make 2023 seem rational and sober,” something that might seem like an impossibility to some. TRUTH LIVES on at [https://sgtreport.tv/](https://sgtreport.tv/) Warning that holding back from the brink in 2023 has simply deferred vast crises to 2024, their story immediately spoke of a ‘post-Covid world,’ although if you look at [this new story over at MSN](https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/other/doctors-fear-new-covid-strain-could-trigger-heart-failure-pandemic-across-the-globe/ar-AA1m8HLh?) that ANP reader [‘Oky’ had linked to in our breaking news section](https://allnewspipeline.com/Breaking_News_Alerts_3.php) Thursday morning you’ll see that Doctors are now speaking of a [‘new COVID strain,’](https://www.irishstar.com/news/us-news/covid-strain-heart-failure-pandemic-31759724) they call ‘JN.1,’ confirming we must be living in ‘some special kind of post-COVID world’ when what they call ‘new strains of COVID’ keep emerging. And as that alarming MSN story warns of this ‘new strain,’ its’ special health affliction is “Doctors fear new Covid strain could trigger ‘heart failure pandemic’ across the globe.” Once again attempting to cover up their own mass-murder spree, with independent media reporting for quite some time about the alarming numbers of ‘mysterious heart failures’ happening all across the planet post-vax, the MSN story is trying to ‘misinform’ those who still get their news from the mainstream media, preparing them for a ‘heart failure pandemic’ being ‘caused‘ by ‘JN.1,’ though anyone who gets their news from the independent media knows these massive numbers of heart failures seen all across the planet are ‘vax caused‘. As we [warned back on November 12th](https://allnewspipeline.com/Globalists_Using_Climate_Change_To_Cover_Up_Carrying_Out_Genocide_Upon_Our_Children.php), back then the WEF had just published a new study claiming that the sudden spike in fatal heart attacks and strokes were caused by ‘man-made climate change.’ And as we had warned in our November 12th story, that astonishing rise in the number of heart attacks was being largely seen in young children and healthy young adults, often athletes in the primes of their lives, and the independent media back then made mincemeat of the WEF’s argument that suddenly, all of these mysterious and sudden deaths were being caused by ‘climate change’. Showing beyond a shadow of a doubt that the globalists in ‘big pharma‘ and ‘government‘ were busy trying to find ‘anything to blame but the vax’ for the huge die-off taking place across the planet, they’re clearly at it again, trying to blame ‘JN.1’ for the next coming die-off which they’ll call a ‘heart failure pandemic.’ But they’ll never, ever blame themselves for carrying out genocide via the ‘forced vax’.

    "text": "Missing hiker found alive after being lost for 10 days in mountains SANTA CRUZ COUNTY, Calif. (KSBW) - A missing hiker was finally rescued after he was lost for 10 days in the Santa Cruz Mountains of California. The 34-year-old man was only going for a three-hour hike when he disappeared. “I didn’t bring anything because I thought I was doing a three-hour hike to go to work,” Lukas McClish, the rescued hiker, said. He was lost in the woods for nine nights and 10 days, shirtless with only a flashlight and folding scissors. It would be more than a week before the raggedy-looking hiker would be found. “So, I kind of just hiked. Each day, I go up a canyon, down a canyon to the next waterfall, sit down by the waterfall, drink water out of my boot,” Lukas McClish recalled. It was a Tuesday when Lukas McClish went for a hike in Boulder Creek and ended up getting lost. “I felt comfortable the whole time I was out there. I wasn’t worried about it,” Lukas McClish said. “I had a mountain lion that was following me, but it was cool. It kept its distances. I think it was just somebody watching over me.” The problem was that Lukas McClish didn’t tell anyone where he was going. By the time Father’s Day rolled around on Sunday, his family started worrying and filed a missing person’s report. The search was on then. “Some nights, although, I just had to trust God that he was going to be OK, and that was hard to do some nights when we would go to bed at night because I would worry about where he was, where he was sleeping and how cold he was and where he was if he was alive,” Diane McClish, the hiker’s mother, said. Lukas McClish drank from water from creeks, ate wild berries and slept on a wet bed of leaves all while yelling for help and thinking of his next meal. “‘Just help. Help, I’m over here.’ Or, ‘Is anybody out there?’” Lukas McClish remembered saying while he was lost. “I want a burrito or a taco bowl. That’s what I thought about every day when I, after the first five days, when I started to kind of realize that I might be in over my head.” But on Thursday afternoon, someone finally heard his cries for help. The Boulder Creek Fire Department deployed a drone and spotted his location. A K-9 tracked him down and Lukas McClish was escorted out of a remote canyon, finally reunited with family. “Met a lot of people because I had more people come to me and tell me how much they love my son and how they just hoped that we would find him,” Diane McClish said. “I didn’t realize that so many people in this town love Luke.” Fortunately, Lukas McClish had no major injuries.
