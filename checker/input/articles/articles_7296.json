    "text": "Cambio climático\nEl nivel del Mediterráneo aumenta en las costas tres veces más rápido de lo previsto\nUn estudio italiano revela que el ritmo es preocupante y mucho más rápido de lo previsto\nEl nivel del mar Mediterráneo está subiendo en la costa tres veces más rápido de lo previsto \"y a finales de siglo pondrá en peligro las actividades humanas y las infraestructuras\", según un informe publicado hoy por el Instituto Nacional de Geofísica y Vulcanología italiano (INGV)\nEl informe, en el que también ha colaborado el Radboud Radio Lab del Departamento de Astrofísica de la Universidad de Radboud (Países Bajos), explica que las proyecciones actuales de aumento del nivel del mar, publicadas en 2021 por el Grupo Intergubernamental de Expertos sobre el Cambio Climático (Ipcc) están \"subestimadas a lo largo de las costas\".\n\"La subsidencia, es decir, el lento movimiento descendente del suelo debido a causas naturales o antropogénicas, desempeña un papel crucial en la aceleración de la subida del nivel del mar a lo largo de las costas, desencadenada por el calentamiento global desde 1880\", explica Marco Anzidei, investigador del INGV en una nota.\n\"Nuestros análisis muestran que, precisamente debido al hundimiento, en algunas zonas del Mediterráneo el nivel del mar está aumentando casi tres veces más rápido que en zonas estables \", añade Antonio Vecchio, investigador de la Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen y primer autor del estudio.\nA la luz de estas evidencias, el equipo de investigadores recalculó las proyecciones del IPCC hasta 2150 en 265 zonas del Mediterráneo, correspondientes también a los 51 mareógrafos de las redes internacionales de vigilancia, incluyendo en los análisis datos relativos al hundimiento.\n¿Los resultados muestran diferencias máximas y mínimas con respecto al informe del IPCC que oscilan, respectivamente, entre aproximadamente más 109 cm y menos 77 cm, con un valor medio superior en aproximadamente 8 cm ¿, explica Vecchio.\nSe explica que, según estos datos, \"aproximadamente 38.500 km2 de costas mediterráneas - de los cuales aproximadamente 19.000 km2 sólo en el sector norte de la cuenca - pronto estarán más expuestas al riesgo de inundaciones marinas, con los consiguientes mayores impactos sobre el medio ambiente, actividades humanas e infraestructuras\".\n\"Por lo tanto, es necesario tomar medidas concretas para apoyar a las poblaciones costeras, que serán cada vez más vulnerables al aumento del nivel del mar y a los mayores riesgos asociados a él a finales de este siglo y en el futuro\" , concluye el informe.\nTras los acuerdos con el PSOE",

Before the match, New Zealand accused their opponents of using drones to spy on their training sessions ahead of the match.\nAs a result, two staff members were removed from their positions, Joseph Lombardi, an analyst with the team, and Jasmine Mander, an assistant coach, though Priestman has now joined those staffers in packing bags.\nIn a staggering turn of events, TSN have reported that both the\n[Canada](/en/team/canada-132) Soccer have been allegedly ‘relying on drones and spying’ for years.\nCanada allegedly used this strategy during the women’s gold-medal winning Olympic tournament in 2021, plus at least one training session before a women’s national team game against Panama in July 2022.\nCanada Soccer will reportedly conduct an ‘independent external review’ of the incident, while FIFA has launched ‘disciplinary proceedings’ of their own.\nIn a statement announcing Bev Priestman’s suspension,\n[Canada](/en/team/canada-132) Soccer CEO and general secretary Kevin Blue said, “Additional information has come to our attention regarding previous drone use against opponents, predating the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.\n“In light of these new revelations,\n[Canada](/en/team/canada-132) Soccer has made the decision to suspend Women’s National Soccer Team Head Coach, Bev Priestman for the remainder of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, and until the completion of our recently announced independent external review.”",

    "text": "Tribune News Network\nDoha\nDefending champions Qatar are determined to match up to their showing of 2019, when they won the AFC Asian Cup, in the upcoming 18th edition of the continental championship, stated Al Annabi coach Marquez Lopez.\nThe Spaniard is also happy with the way the Qatar national team is preparing for the tournament which begins January 12 and will last till February 10 at the FIFA World Cup Qatar stadiums.\n“I am happy with the determination players are showing during the training sessions. I am very happy with the way the preparations are going on at this moment,” Lopez, who replaced Carlos Queiroz as Qatar coach, told the local media on the sidelines of the training camp.\nQatar are to play two friendlies against Cambodia on December 31 and later vs Jordan on January 5 in Doha as part of their preparations for the AFC Asian Cup 2023.\n“I have great confidence in everyone, and although time is limited before the tournament, we will work with all our strength and try to reach the best preparation,” stressed Lopez.\n“The friendlies are important as these games will give us good opportunity to attain readiness.”\n“Pressure is there in football and it is important for the players to enjoy the moments. If there is no enjoyment of the game, then why do we play in the first place,” he added.\nOn the focus being on Qatar as reigning champions, Lopez said: “We are the title holders and certainly this is a great responsibility for the team and all the players. We will go step by step as this is a big challenge. We will first think about winning the first match,” he said.“Our first goal is to make the Qatar fans happy, and without a doubt their support for the team will give us great motivation and additional strength.”\nLopez who was recently given the responsibility of managing the Qatar national team had been busy with the Qatar Stars League as coach of Al Wakrah.\nOn his new role, he said, “This is a good opportunity for me after a long career with Al Wakrah. I believe in my mentality and style. I am not new to the national team and I know all the players well.”\n Copy 29/12/2023 10",

    "title": "Hillel Neuer on Sky News: Concerns mount over UNRWA terror ties following investigation",
    "text": "SHARE: Twitter | Instagram | Facebook | YouTube\nUN Watch’s Hillel Neuer appeared on Sky News Australia’s Power House, hosted by Gabriella Power, to discuss UNRWA’s deep ties to Hamas terrorism and the October 7th massacre, after the agency was forced to fire nine of its employees found to have been involved in carrying out the atrocities.\nGabriella Power, Sky News: The UN has admitted several employees of UNRWA may have been involved in the horrific October 7 attack on Israel. An investigation found nine UNRWA employees were linked to Hamas’ attack, which killed 1 ,200 people. Joining us now is human rights lawyer and Executive Director of UN Watch, Hillel Neuer.\nHillel, thank you for joining us. Last time we spoke was earlier in the year, and you warned that Australia may be enabling terrorism if it restored UNRWA funding, and it only took our government a couple of months until funding was reinstated. Firstly, can I get your reaction to the findings of this investigation?\nHillel Neuer: Look, we’re talking about a supposedly UN humanitarian agency where nine of its employees have been found by an internal UN investigation to have taken part in the perpetration of the Hamas massacre of October 7th. We don’t know if it’s mass murder, rape, or other sadistic atrocities. So this is absolutely horrific. And what we’re seeing from the United Nations is a kind of mealy-mouthed acknowledgement. A lot of spin, a lot of weasel words. We’re not seeing strong condemnations of what this really involves. We’re not seeing talk of the international law violations. We’re not seeing talk of prosecuting these people- it’s not enough to fire nine people. What about the prosecution? Finally, it’s not – very clearly – just about a few people. The whole agency itself is rotten to the core.\nSky News: You mentioned spin. What do you make of the reporting around this? The New York Times had the headline, ‘U.N. Clears Half the Aid Workers Accused of Taking Part in the October 7 Attack.’ Is that really the point?\nNeuer: No, look, this kind of taps into when there were mass violent riots in the wake of the George Floyd episode, we saw headlines like ‘mostly peaceful demonstrators hold a protest,’ or something, even if they were burning down half the city. So this is the same kind of spin from the New York Times.\nNine supposedly humanitarian aid workers were found by the UN to have engaged in the massacre. And their headline is that other people were cleared. By the way, the other people weren’t cleared. The UN said that they just found insufficient evidence for a number of them, but they were going to take measures. So the Israelis only gave 12 names at the time. Since then, they’ve given 100 names. There is evidence. The UN acknowledged it for nine people. The New York Times tried to find some kind of bizarre, inverted headline. Very disappointing for the New York Times.\nSky News: UNRWA claims that it’s continuing life -saving work with more neutrality than anyone else. How can that possibly be the case?\nNeuer: Well, it’s ridiculous. The Colonna report, which was a supposedly independent review that was conducted several months ago, in fact, it was an entirely rigged process. The head of the review, Catherine Colonna from France, is a major, on the record, supporter of UNRWA. Three Scandinavian groups involved in the review were all major UNRWA supporters, including Kjersti Berg from the Danish group, CMI. She is part of a Global Palestine Network, run by UN rapporteur Francesca Albanese, that was lobbying to fund UNRWA. So the same person involved in reviewing UNRWA is involved in a lobby group lobbying to fund UNRWA, the same person. So this is the supposedly independent group that found that UNRWA had more neutrality than any other agency.\nLook, this is ridiculous. I spoke in the Dutch Parliament recently, and in the Swiss Parliament, and I said that this was like the Stalinist constitution of the 1930s, which was portrayed as the most democratic in the world, and maybe on paper there were provisions, but this was a time when Stalin was executing tens, hundreds of thousands of people in show trials.\nSo UNRWA may have dozens of neutrality manuals. All of that is meaningless when hundreds, indeed thousands of UNRWA teachers, school principals, other employees, regularly engage in promotion of jihadi terrorism and incitement to antisemitism. All of this is documented on our website, UNWatch.org. The fact that they claim to have developed neutrality procedures is just really Orwellian.\nSky News: The UN was asked how the Secretary-General feels about the findings. Let’s take a listen.\n[from video clip]\nJournalist : What does the Secretary General feel about these findings? What is his view of it? What are his personal feelings about what the OIOS found?\nU.N. Spokesman: He believes it’s important that we go through this very carefully, given the fact that any involvement in these attacks would constitute a major betrayal of trust. Obviously there were actions that were taken for the benefit of the agency that were very swift and very decisive in terms of dealing with the individuals who had been named at first.\nWe want to make sure that the reputation of our UNRWA staff, our dedicated staff, including about 200 people who have lost their lives since the 7th of October, is fully recognized and that UNRWA gets the support that it needs.\nSky News: So the focus should be on the reputation of UNRWA staff.\nNeuer: Look, it’s unbelievable. He was asked specifically, how does the Secretary-General feel, his personal feelings about the fact that nine of his supposedly humanitarian aid workers were found by the UN to have engaged in a horrific massacre, mass murder, rape, torture, other atrocities, and his answer is, ‘we’re most concerned about the reputation of UNRWA.’ That’s shameful. Absolutely shameful.\nSky News: Absolutely. Look, you are in Jerusalem at the moment. We know that Israel’s military is preparing for major destruction in the event of an Iranian attack. What can you tell us?\nNeuer: Look, I’m based in Switzerland. I was in the Swiss Alps. I heard that the evil Ayatollah of the Islamic regime in Iran was threatening Israel with an assault with missiles and suicide drones from Iran, from the Hezbollah terrorist proxy in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen, Shiite proxies in Iraq and Syria, I decided to show my support and solidarity with the people of Israel by buying a ticket and flying here as soon as I could. I’ve arrived here in Jerusalem. On the streets, you will see regular daily life. But if you speak to people, they are very nervous. If you speak to families, they’re sleeping in bomb shelters. Children are traumatized. Where is the international community? The Iranian regime and Hezbollah are openly threatening military aggression in violation of the United Nations charter. They are saying not only military targets, civilian as well. Where is the outcry from the United Nations? Where is the outcry from the European Union and their foreign minister Joseph Borrell. You know, we’re hearing crickets.\nSky News: Yeah. absolutely. Another point: Israel’s Olympic Team said that some athletes have been receiving threats as they compete in Paris. Is antisemitism being normalized in your view?\nNeuer: Absolutely. What we’re seeing today in Paris at the Olympics and indeed around the world is an outburst of antisemitism that we really haven’t seen since World War II. This is the lowest level of incitement to hatred, demonization of Jews, violence, attacks on Jews in the United States, Canada, Australia, Europe, really worldwide, and the response by institutions that are supposedly anti -racist, groups like Amnesty International, in many cases, once again, it’s silence. We should see the writing on the wall. We saw what happened in Europe in the 1930s when demonization of the Jews was allowed to run rampant. It led to terrible things. I think history is sending us a warning, and we need to stamp out any demonization of Jews, attacks on Jews, there needs to be zero tolerance, whether it’s in Paris or anywhere else in the world.\nSky News: Just quickly, on the U .S. election, Kamala Harris chose Tim Walz over Josh Shapiro. What do you make of that decision?\nNeuer: Look, a little over two decades ago, the Democratic Party ran Senator Joe Lieberman as their vice president. This was an openly identifying observant Jew, an Orthodox Jew. And it was quite welcome across certainly the Democratic Party and the United States. People and having a man of faith, and he actually got the majority of the votes. They didn’t get the electoral college. So America was ready back in the late 90s to elect a Jewish vice president, to vote for Jewish vice president.\nToday, we’re seeing the opposite. We’re seeing the Democratic Party’s radical left -wing fringe that seems to have taken over and actually has become not the fringe, but is quite dominating, sadly. The camp that includes Cori Bush and AOC and other even more overtly antisemitic elements seem to have taken over the Democratic Party, and they seemingly vetoed the choice of the governor of Pennsylvania, Mr. Shapiro, whose positions are, whether on Israel or other issues, are no different than the other candidates, including the one that she chose. So it seems the only objection to Shapiro was the fact that he was Jewish, a bad sign for the Democratic Party, a bad sign for where we are in the world today.\nSky News: And I’ve had plenty of Jewish people say that and express that to me, and it just breaks my heart. Finally, on UNRWA, Australia’s opposition Leader Peter Dutton says Australia should reconsider its involvement, engagement, and funding of UNRWA. What should Australia do in your view?\nNeuer: The first thing Australia needs to do is to stop lying for UNRWA. You know, there were hearings held in the Australian Senate several months ago. A representative of your foreign ministry came and said that reports about UNRWA staff promoting antisemitism are false. He attacked our reports without any basis. You can go, you know, the Foreign Ministry of Australia and Minister Wong and Prime Minister Albanese should go on our website, UNWatch.org. You will see hundreds of screenshots from the UNRWA staff themselves, teachers like Elham Mansour of Lebanon, who works for UNRWA, as a teacher at UNRWA, who openly says, “in the name of Allah, we need to slaughter the Jews.” The head of the teachers’ union in Lebanon is Fathi al -Sharif. He is a senior Hamas official. He doesn’t hide it on his Facebook page. UNRWA knows it, they refused to fire him. Finally, the head of the teachers union in Gaza, overseeing over 200 ,000 students for many years was someone by the name of Suhail al -Hindi and is now on the Hamas Politburo with Yahya Sinwar, who was the head of the UNRWA Teachers Union in Gaza.\nUNRWA knows all of this. The heads of UNRWA, other than a few Swiss and other internationals at the top, the people running UNRWA are Hamas terrorists, the agency is pervaded with terrorists. All the evidence is there, undisputed. The Australian government needs to stop fronting for this agency that is corrupted by terrorists. There are many other options if we want to help Palestinians. And sadly, Australia is embracing a group, UNRWA, that is only promising further education for generations of resentment, grievance, and war.\nSky News: Executive Director of UN Watch, Hillel Neuer. Thank you so much for joining us on Power Hour.\nNeuer: Thank you for having me.",

    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO -- For 30 years, the Boulevard restaurant has served quintessentially Californian cuisine in San Francisco. Owner and Chef Nancy Oakes opened Boulevard in 1993 in the historic Audiffred building on the Embarcadero waterfront. \"I am shocked that it's 30 years. I really am,\" expressed Oakes. \"It sounds crazy, but I've really loved being here.\" \"There's sort of an opulence,\" the Boulevard's Executive Chef Dana Younkin adds. \"And then a lot of care, and curation of ingredients. But also, just like hospitality, just a really warm and fun environment to be in.\" Nancy is knows as a pioneering American chef and mentor. She's kept the Boulevard menu fresh and creative. \"I don't know if people really think the food has changed very much, but it has changed radically,\" explained Oakes. \"I would get very bored if I didn't also try to learn new things and experiment with them and bring them in.\" The menu is bursting with carefully curated flavors and of course, San Francisco seafood. \"It's a very collaborative kitchen,\" said Younkin. \"Everybody has to care along the way to make something awesome, because, you know, chef can come up with the idea, but like day in, day out the team is holding that, bringing it through to the guest.\" Oakes adds, \"When they come in. And they tell you...we got engaged here. And we met, we've been married 20 years, and we celebrate every anniversary here. And I mean, that's becoming a part of somebody's life. And you have to look at it as an honor.\" For more information, visit here .",

    "title": "U.S. Federal Trade Commission Announces Rule Banning Non-Competes for Employees - By Jim Butler",
    "text": "The U.S. Federal Trade Commission’s recent decision to ban non-compete agreements marks a pivotal shift in employment regulations nationwide. This rule not only prohibits new agreements but also retroactively impacts existing ones. From its broad definition of “worker” to its exceptions and impending legal challenges, understanding the nuances of this rule is crucial for employers preparing for compliance. JMBM Partner Michael H. Strub, Jr. explains the implications of this landmark decision. FTC Announces Rule Banning Non-Competes - By Michael H. Strub, Jr., JMBM’s Litigation Group Employers throughout the country should be aware that on April 23, 2024, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission adopted a rule that would generally prohibit non-compete provisions, which prohibit workers from accepting work in a competing business or operating a competing business. Specifically, the rule prohibits employers from entering into new non-compete provisions and acts retroactively to prohibit employers from enforcing existing ones. The rule defines “worker” broadly, and includes, for example, independent contractors and unpaid workers. The rule includes an exception in connection with the bona fide sale of a business and allows existing lawsuits to enforce non-compete clauses to continue. The rule also permits enforcement of existing non-compete provisions with senior executives—policy makers whose total compensation is at least $151,164 when annualized—but prohibits new ones. The rule also requires employers to give notice of the new rule, so there will be yet another piece of paper that must be tacked to the cork board in the company kitchen. The ban will take effect 120 days after the final rule is published in the Federal Register and employers should be prepared to develop compliance plans. Update Employers should take note that lawsuits from several business lobbies, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, have already been filed against the FTC in response to this rule. Stay tuned for ongoing updates as legal challenges progress. Employers may consider filing a lawsuit of their own, but it’s worth considering: why spend money if others are already waging the war? You can read two of the recently filed complaints below seeking to stop effectiveness of the new rule: Chamber of Commerce of The United States of America, Business Roundtable, Texas Association of Business, and Longview Chamber of Commerce v.

    "text": "[Estauracio](/user/Estauracio)a [ultimasnoticias.com.ve](/go/link/3971617) [#1](c1#c-1) Una cómplice más de la dictadura de Maduro que terminará en la cárcel.\nTienen el ejemplo de Añez que se va a pasar lo que le queda de vida en la cárcel.\nMe imagino que no habrá ningún problema en hacer públicas las actas electorales.\n[#3](c3#c-3) Me imagino que ya habrán tenido tiempo de falsificar las actas.\nTambién piden que hagan públicas las actas, casi un mes después... Se ve venir.\n[#33](c33#c-33) El chavismo lleva custodiando las actas, las urnas con votos y las máquinas de votación desde hace un mes. Ellos dirán que las suyas son las buenas.\n[#1](c1#c-1) Eres un facha que no acepta los resultados legítimos de un país democrático y soberano. Las elecciones en Venezuela son las más seguras del mundo y el Supremo es un organismo profesional e independiente.\nNo hay más que ver quienes lo integran para estar totalmente seguro de su imparcialidad y profesional, yo confio >\nEsta es Caryslia Beatriz Rodríguez, la presidenta del Tribunal Supremo de Venezuela [#1](c1#c-1) Bueno, ya era oficial desde 2015 cuando la oposición arrasó en las elecciones legislativas (consiguieron 2/3 de los diputados) y Maduro simplemente ignoró al parlamento se creó su propia asamblea con el 100% de los diputados a su favor. Ahora la dictadura continua.\n[#27](c27#c-27) Ah, que en Venezuela se voto en el 2015, y ya es para siempre, te recuerdo que no fue al presidente.\n[#27](c27#c-27) exacto, dejo esto para que se recuerde lo que ocurrió en 2015 y 2017\nhttps://www.infobae.com/venezuela/2024/07/27/el-recuerdo-de-las-legislativas-2015-la-victoria-opositora-que-llevo-a-maduro-a-terminar-de-convertir-su-regimen-en-una-dictadura/\nLa victoria en las parlamentarias del 2015 parecía sembrar una luz de esperanza en un pueblo que soñaba con un cambio.\nLa victoria en las urnas no solamente representó una ventaja legislativa para la oposición que pasó a ocupar 109 bancas contra 55 del Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) y 3 de Representación Indígena\nEn 2016, el TSJ anuló todas las decisiones de la Asamblea Nacional opositora, alegando que los legisladores incurrieron en desacato al incorporar a tres diputados cuya elección había sido impugnada. Esta medida, junto con otras decisiones del TSJ, limitó significativamente el poder legislativo del Parlamento opositor y llevó al país a un nuevo nivel de confrontación: el conflicto de Poderes.\nEl chavismo se impuso en el poder legislativo por medio de la creación ilegal de la Asamblea Nacional Constituyente (ANC) en 2017, Maduro halló el camino para perpetuarse en el poder y evitar que los opositores bloquearan sus políticas y reformas.\nLa razón de ser de la ANC era sostener un parlamento paralelo, en el que solo fueron admitidos diputados chavistas. Si bien la Constitución venezolana contempla la creación de nuevos organismos, para que estos sean considerados oficiales deben ser aprobados por medio de un referéndum.\n[#1](c1#c-1) Resumen: tenemos los resultados de verdad, y las actas pero no se las podemos mostrar. También nos hackearon, de verdad, créannos, se los juramos por este puño de cruces. Porque yo lo digo.\n[#14](c14#c-14) no. Pero que daba igual que dijese maduro, el cne, el TSJ venezolano o el espíritu de Chávez reencarnado en un pájaro dando un mitin en un balcón de Miraflores ni cotizaba.\nSe decidió que había ganado el guaido de turno, y de ahí no se ha de mover nadie.\nMientras el país seguirá manejado por un completo inútil, solo superado por la inutilidad de su oposición\n[#21](c21#c-21) Guaidó Guaidó Guaidó... Comodín universal.\nLo que se os olvida el porqué de Guaidó, la oposición ganó la Asamblea Nacional y el chavismo creo otra y despojo ilegalmente a la original de funciones. La dictadura chavista no empezó hoy.\n[#24](c24#c-24) ¿he negado yo que lo que tienen ahí montado sea una aberración?\nPero de todas formas, puedes volver al comentario inicial. Si hoy el TSJ hubiese dicho que no ganó Maduro entonces de repente si que tendría legitimidad y la separación de poderes estaría restaurada?\nPues eso, que unos no se van a ir por las buenas, y los otros son todavía más inútiles y no han de aceptar nada que no sea un todo. Y así hasta que se líen a tiros bien.\nPero dramas de otra petro dictadura, que por algún motivo nos tiene que importar mucho. Ya me avisas cuando salgan las actas de cualquiera de nuestros otros proveedores de crudo como los sauditas\n[#32](c32#c-32) sí, pero si hoy el TSJ dice lo contrario de repente tendría legitimidad y sería menos dictadura. No?\nVuelve a mi primer comentario entonces, da igual lo que hagan o digan en Venezuela a estas alturas.\n[#42](c42#c-42) Que el chavismo diga que el chavismo ha ganado las elecciones no tiene ninguna legítimad. Legitimidad tendría si hubieran hecho público las actas hace ya casi un mes, lo que presenten ahora, ya poca fiabilidad tiene.\nsí, pero si hoy el TSJ dice lo contrario de repente tendría legitimidad y sería menos dictadura. No?\n[#46](c46#c-46) Maduro tiene de Chávez el pájaro que le habla.\nFlaco favor se le hace a nadie encumbrandolo en su propio discurso de que es continuismo cuando es posiblemente uno de los más mediocres políticos de América latina. Y hay competencia.\nPor suerte para él en su casa lo tiene fácil con la almagama de golpistas con las espaldas cubiertas por 'occidente' que tiene enfrente para bunquerizarse\n[#18](c18#c-18) ¿Realmente estás comparando la seriedad de ambas instituciones? Aunque el TS español sea muy objetable, es que no es lo mismo en absoluto.\nEl golpe de estado de Maduro se ha hecho realidad... una victoria electoral sin mostrar públicamente los resultados detallados y contradiciendo, por mucho, el resultado el 83% de las actas conocidas.\nHabría que recordar a la neutral Presidenta del Tribunal Supremo:\n[#12](c12#c-12) la dictadura de Maduro es dictadura o vecino según interese.\nPor ejemplo hace unos meses pasó a vecino que podía vender petroleo a USA.\nCosas de ser el amo, que ellos mismos definen las reglas y la ley del embudo\n[#16](c16#c-16) EEUU le puso a Maduro como condición hacer unas elecciones limpias y como gesto de buena voluntad retiró las sanciones. Maduro no ha cumplido, pues vuelven las sanciones.\n[#12](c12#c-12) Ahora es cuando dicen tener pruebas de que en Venezuela hay \"arepas de destrucción masiva\" e inician una acción militar preventiva, lo habitual en el matón policía de la democracia en los países con petróleo que no les rinden pleitesía.\nYa lo dijo Trump... \"EEUU se tendría que haber quedado con todo su petróleo\".\n[#20](c20#c-20) Ya sabes, si EEUU mueve ficha Maduro negocia con los BRIC's la cesión de sus reservas y a ver si a China-Rusia le van a quitar el contrato\ninfluencer-venezolano-greg-aventuras-confiesa-haber-recibido/c012#c-12",

    "text": "CHARELSTON, W.Va. — Appalachian Power and Wheeling Power customers continue to display their opposition against a $265 million rate increase. Four organizations, West Virginians for Energy Freedom, WV Citizens Action Group, People’s Action Institute and 350 Network Council came together for a ‘Bills Too High Rally’ in front of the AEP Office in Charleston Thursday afternoon to address the increasing power bills. However, the event was not only a way to address their concerns of the rising energy costs, but advocate for locally-owned and renewable energy solutions. Emmett Pepper is an attorney who has been representing various organizations going before the state Public Service Commission on the matter. He said the company’s aim to raise customers rates by 15.4% is very concerning. “Of course I’m wearing the city council hat too, I’m concerned about the constituents as well, a lot of low-income folks are going to be affected by this,” Pepper said. Another spokesperson of the event, Tyler Blake last week started an online petition called ‘AEP Stop the Hike’ after he felt something needed to be done. He said the petition has now reached nearly 500 signatures. Blake said the petition reflects a resounding sense of anger from all who are living pay check to pay check and on a fixed income as it is. “People in West Virginia who are current rate-payers of AEP or Appalachian Power are aggravated, they’re upset and they cannot afford these rate hikes,” Blake said. He said he also took the petition door-to-door around different communities from Princeton to Huntington. The power company filed the request for the increase with the PSC a couple of weeks ago and Thursday’s rally marked a series of several pushback events that have been held in West Virginia since then. If approved, it would increase the average residential bill by approximately $28.72 a month. Blake said he doesn’t understand how the utility company has the audacity to raise the bill by such an extreme amount considering many are relying on disability checks and social security. “When I went to the public hearing on Monday at the PSC in Charleston, I was sitting there and I was listening to the stories that people were giving and I mean, they’re absolute tear jerkers, you had people there, mothers there who were crying and begging and pleading to the PSC and to AEP not to allow this rate increase,” he said. At the same time, AEP is also in the middle of another rate hike and fuel cost case where they are seeking a rate increase of $20.4 million under what’s called the Expanded Net Energy Cost. They held a hearing on Monday for that as well. Pepper said what’s not being publicized much about that particular case is the fact that it will significantly increase rates for small businesses, churches, and schools by 25 to 30%. In addition, he said there’s also another concern where the company is not letting those trying to be more energy efficient off the hook either. “The other thing that may have not been as well publicized that’s concerning is that if an individual looks at a big rate increase like that coming and says ‘well, gosh maybe I should just buy some solar panels so I can cut some of my cost,’ according to the proposal, they actually are making it harder for people to even go solar, slashing the amount of a credit that you get if you have solar panels,” Pepper said. According to the organizations that were host to Thursday’s rally, West Virginia has some of the highest growing electricity rates in the country due to the state’s dependency on privately owned power companies that prioritize profits over affordable energy solutions. However, it’s part of a movement across 17 states to secure more affordable energy as well accountability from for-profit utilities. There are currently over two dozen similar events taking place across the country this week. Blake said people can still sign the petition by going to his ‘AEP Stop the Hike’ Facebook page as well as get up-to-date on the movement. He encourages everyone to sign it to help remind the power company that they don’t accept the hikes. “Your voice needs to be heard, you deserve to be heard, you’re the one paying the bill,” Blake said. “We want your voice to be heard, AEP needs to know that you can’t afford these rate increases.” He said you can also test him at (304)908-0089 and it will automatically send you a link to the petition to sign online.",
