    "title": "Storm Darragh causes power cables to SPARK after covering them in sea salt",
    "text": "Storm Darragh certainly did a number on Cornwall last weekend. Not only did it bring trees down, close roads, cover the streets of coastal towns with tonnes of sand and cause lengthy power cuts, but it also messed up the power grid.\nMany people have been complaining that their lights have been flickering since the storm, but there are now concerns over sparking powerlines. From Hayle to Newquay, residents have taken to social media to wonder why the power lines are still sparking days after Storm Darragh has passed.\nOn a post on the public page Newest Newquay, Pauline Fillery said she spoke to two National Grid engineers out doing repairs in Cubert who told her the salt build up along the lines accumulated from Storm Darragh is the reason why the lines are sparking.\nShe posted: \"I have news from two National Grid men currently in Cubert. This is what's really going on with the power. Due to the storm last weekend it has caused a build up of salt on the power lines. They said it's built up and tracking along the lines, causing the power to trip.\nSign up to receive daily updates and breaking news alerts from CornwallLive straight to your inbox\n\"Also there are lots of sparking of power lines due to the salt. They said they are getting on top of it but it's random where and when it happens. They need it to rain to wash the salt off. They said that sticky salty stuff that's coated our windows, is what is coating the power lines.\"\nGary Price added: \"All the power lines are supported by either glass or ceramic discs that act as insulators to the steel pylons. Build up of salt can cause power to track to steelwork on the tower. Some companies power wash them off if lines are isolated. Rain will generally keep them rinsed off of salt and sand build up.\"\nWolf Akuma saw the funny side of it, adding: \"Damn, so we need another storm to fix the first storm and the root of all our problems is cloudy, white, sticky and salty? Gotcha!\"\nAccording to scientific open access publishing site MDPI, \"over time, atmospheric contaminants, such as salt spray or chemical dust, can build up on an insulator, creating a conductive path that can cause a high-voltage electric discharge known as a flashover. Flashovers can be dangerous or even fatal if a person is too close to the insulator when it occurs\".\nHayle resident Lee Nicholas sent CornwallLive a video of sparking powerlines near the Asda store in the town. You can hear little pop sounds and see flashes where the lines are connected to the pylons.\nNational Grid has confirmed that it is indeed the case that salt incrustation is causing the sparking adding that they are on top of it. A spokesperson for the utility company said rain would be welcome to clean it all off, but the forecast is not promising for the next few days. They insisted it poses no danger to people and properties.\nThe utility firm said what happened is rare but can happen from time to time and was made worse by the storm and wind direction which pulled a lot of moisture from the sea. They said: \"During Storm Darragh strong winds at some costal locations and high grounds led to sea salt crystals coating overhead lines.\n\"This is an unusual occurrence due to the exceptionally strong northern westerly winds experienced during the storm that pulled moisture from the sea.\n\"We would like to reassure our customers that we are aware of the issue and are taking action. We will continue to monitor the situation closely.\"\nClick here to join CornwallLive on WhatsApp. We also treat our community members to special offers, promotions, and adverts from us and our partners.

I tried the qr code on camera, and even manually entering set up code, no luck. This is a first time install with google home and there are no other devices connected. I can't even pass the 1st step, it searches for cameras near me and nothing comes up. I am using on iphone\n38m ago\nHi zenga,\nThank you for reaching out to our community.\nI’m sorry to hear that you can’t install your Nest Cam with floodlights using the Google Home app. I can see you have other Nest products that you use with the Nest app, and because of your recent purchases of two Google devices, you have to use the Google Home app. Thank you for sharing with us these important details, such as the distance you are from the camera to set it up, the symptoms the camera is showing, and some of the steps you have taken to set the camera up through your iPhone. I would be more than pleased to help you with this inconvenience, so don't worry.\nBefore we get started with further troubleshooting, let me ask you some important questions:\nHow far is the Nest Cam with floodlights from the router?\nAre you getting any error messages on your Google Home app? If so, please describe it.\nAre there devices or appliances (such as baby monitors, microwaves, cordless phones, etc.) near the device you want to pair?\nCould you please double-check if your Google Nest devices and your iPhone are connected to the same WiFi network?\nIs Bluetooth enabled on your iPhone?\nIs the Nest Cam with floodlights connected to a 2.4 GHz frequency?\nIs the local network enabled for the Google Home app?\nIn case you would need to know how to enable the local network for the Google Home app, here are the instructions:\nFrom your iPhone's settings, enable Local Network for the Google Home app:\nThanks for your kind attention. I will be looking forward to your response.\nBest regards,\nVirna",

    "text": "News Community UC Santa Barbara Students Set Up Gaza War Protest Camp Peacefully Chancellor Sends Message on Conduct, Safety, and Dialogue\nBy Jack Magargee\nSat May 04, 2024 | 3:31pm Share this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on X (Opens in new window) Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Add to Favorites One of about 10 tents forming a pro-Palestinian encampment at UC Santa Barbara. | Credit: Ingrid Bostrom Friday was Day Three of an encampment constructed at UC Santa Barbara, where supporters of Palestinians have engaged in peaceful activism and demonstrations for a cease-fire in the Israel-Gaza conflict.\nThe encampment began at 4 a.m. on May Day — historically a day recognized for worker protests since it was first celebrated in the United States in 1886 as a part of laborers’ fight for an eight-hour work day. As on university and college campuses nationwide, the encampment at UCSB is informally recognized as a “liberated zone” on the greens in the area between Davidson Library and the chemistry and engineering buildings. The group is asked not to talk to the press, but they include 30-50 university-affiliated individuals who remain in about 10 tents for the day-and-night protest.\nThe camp has rules. Upon entering, protesters are asked to sign-in — a name or code name suffices — and to give emergency contact information. Organizers ask participants for their confrontation comfort level on a scale of green (least), orange, or red (okay with being arrested). Additionally, the group is instructed not to go off script when sloganeering.\nCollege campuses have been at the forefront of demonstrations in support of Palestinians in Gaza and against Israel, and in some cases violence has occurred and participants arrested. At the University of Southern California (USC) 93 people have been arrested, and at UCLA, violence between pro-Palestine protesters and counter protesters ensued late on April 30. More thatn 2,000 arrests occurred across the nation in recent weeks.\nAt UCSB, an “unsanctioned rally” on Wednesday and the encampment have been peaceful, attracting a limited presence by Campus Security Officers (CSOs) but great attention from students, who have posted a multitude of photos and videos of the encampment since it began. As of Friday evening, no reports were made of any confrontations. However, the unsanctioned encampment has drawn attention from Chancellor Henry Yang.\nThe chancellor issued a statement, saying he cherished the long the tradition of student activism and First Amendment rights on UCSB’s campus but also informed students, “Those violating laws and codes of conduct in unsanctioned, illegal, and disruptive activities, whether non-affiliates or members of our campus community, are subject to legal and disciplinary action.”\n“Moving forward,” Yang’s letter continued, “we are willing to work with student groups that wish to protest or express their rights and views peacefully, consistent with law and campus conduct policies, without disrupting or interfering with our core educational and research mission.”\nYang was likely referring to protest signs at the MultiCultural Center in February targeted anti-Semitic statements at the Jewish president of Associated Students. That occurrence sparked a Federal Discrimination Probe by the U.S. Department of Education that began in the last week of March and is still ongoing.\n“We must ensure campus safety, and respect the right of everyone on campus to feel safe,” Yang wrote. “We recognize that the violence and suffering in the Middle East have caused great distress in our campus community and we urgently hope that a peaceful resolution will be found. We remain committed to dialogue and education, especially where there are strongly held and differing views. As a public university, the University of California welcomes regular reviews of its policies and practices; there is much that can be debated with analytic rigor.”\nSat May 04, 2024 | 22:35pm https://www.independent.com/2024/05/04/uc-santa-barbara-students-camp-in-peace/",

    "title": "CHRISTIANITY: God’s peace through prayer",
    "text": "In his letter to the church in Philippi, the Apostle Paul provides timeless wisdom and encouragement for believers facing anxiety and worry.”Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.” Philippians 4:6-7.This passage offers practical steps for dealing with anxiety and the promise of divine peace.\nThe Problem of Anxiety: Anxiety is a universal human experience that many people face, especially in today’s fast-paced world. It manifests as feelings of unease, worry, or fear, often stemming from uncertainties about the future or situations beyond our control. Common sources of anxiety include concerns about our families, jobs, health, and overall future. The Bible offers a pathway to cope with these feelings, rooted in faith and trust in God.\nThe Call to Prayer: Paul instructs us to respond to anxiety with prayer. He emphasizes three key elements: prayer, petition, and thanksgiving. Prayer is an invitation to bring our worries and concerns before God. When we pray, we acknowledge our dependence on God and seek His guidance and comfort. Petition involves telling God exactly what we need and what is troubling us. By doing so, we entrust our burdens to Him, knowing that He cares for us. Thanksgiving shifts our focus from our problems to the blessings we have received. By cultivating a thankful heart, we remind ourselves of God’s faithfulness and goodness, which strengthens our faith.\nThe Promise of God’s Peace: God’s peace is described as transcending all understanding. It is not dependent on our circumstances or our ability to comprehend it fully.\nPaul tells us that God’s peace will guard our hearts and minds in Christ Jesus. This imagery suggests protection and security. God’s peace watches over our inner being, keeping us safe from the turmoil of anxiety. Let us commit to bringing our anxieties before God, trusting in His care, and embracing His peace.",

    "text": "George A., Kevin M. fueron sentenciados a trece aÃ±os y cuatro meses de privaciÃ³n de libertad como autores de extorsiÃ³n. La misma pena recayÃ³ tambiÃ©n para JosÃ© B., quien fue seÃ±alado como coautor por el Tribunal de GarantÃas Penales que conociÃ³ el caso, en Quito.\nEl fallo incluyÃ³ el pago de una multa de cuarenta salarios bÃ¡sicos unificados y una reparaciÃ³n integral de USD 1.000, montos que deben ser asumidos por los procesados de forma individual.\nEn la audiencia de juicio, el fiscal que manejÃ³ el caso explicÃ³ que los acusados extorsionaron a una mujer, exigiÃ©ndole USD 50.000. La amenazaron con atentar contra su integridad y la de su familia. Aseguraron que las represalias alcanzarÃan a los estudiantes y al personal docente del plantel educativo donde trabajaba la vÃctima.\nLos mensajes extrosivos comenzaron el 21 de diciembre de 2023.

Esa advertencia la obligÃ³ a hacer dos transferencias a la cuenta de George A. un dÃa despuÃ©s, aunque no por el monto total exigido.\nLos extorsionadores exigieron que la vÃctima pusiera un vehÃculo a nombre de uno de ellos. Para este trÃ¡mite, la citaron en una notarÃa en Carapungo, donde Kevin M. recibiÃ³ un sobre con USD 200.\nAntes de asistir a la notarÃa, la mujer alertÃ³ a la PolicÃa sobre lo que estaba ocurriendo. Los uniformados aprehendieron a Kevin M. en delito flagrante. Ã‰l condujo a los agentes hasta los otros dos procesados.\nEl fiscal aÃ±adiÃ³ que -segÃºn las primeras investigaciones- una persona del cÃrculo familiar de la vÃctima participÃ³ en el delito. JosÃ© B. es sobrino polÃtico de la hermana de vÃctima, y su cercanÃa le permitiÃ³ acceder a informaciÃ³n.\nLe puede interesar: Un hombre muriÃ³ tras ser apuÃ±alado en la cabeza durante un asalto en el barrio Ecuador, norte de Quito",
