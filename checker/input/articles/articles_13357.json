    "text": "Report: “OpenAI, Google and Anthropic are Struggling to Build More Advanced AI”\nFrom Bloomberg (via Bloomberg BNN):\nOpenAI isn’t alone in hitting stumbling blocks recently. After years of pushing out increasingly sophisticated AI products at a breakneck pace, three of the leading AI companies are now seeing diminishing returns from their costly efforts to build newer models. At Alphabet Inc.’s Google, an upcoming iteration of its Gemini software is not living up to internal expectations, according to three people with knowledge of the matter. Anthropic, meanwhile, has seen the timetable slip for the release of its long-awaited Claude model called 3.5 Opus.\nThe companies are facing several challenges. It’s become increasingly difficult to find new, untapped sources of high-quality, human-made training data that can be used to build more advanced AI systems. Orion’s unsatisfactory coding performance was due in part to the lack of sufficient coding data to train on, two people said. At the same time, even modest improvements may not be enough to justify the tremendous costs associated with building and operating new models, or to live up to the expectations that come with branding a product as a major upgrade.\n[Clip]\nTech companies are also beginning to wrestle with whether to keep offering their older AI models, perhaps with some additional improvements, or to shoulder the costs of supporting hugely expensive new versions that may not perform much better.\n[Clip]\nAs costs rise, so do the stakes and expectations for each new model under development. Noah Giansiracusa, an associate professor of mathematics at Bentley University in Waltham, Massachusetts, said AI models will keep improving, but the rate at which that will happen is questionable.\nLearn More, Read the Complete Article (about 1630 words)\nFiled under: Data Files, News\nAbout Gary Price\nGary Price ( ) is a librarian, writer, consultant, and frequent conference speaker based in the Washington D.C. metro area.

    "text": "Govt set to amend law to recognise more specialists\nKUALA LUMPUR: Thousands of patients needing government specialist healthcare can expect a reprieve in June with Parliament expected to amend the Medical Act so that specialists and surgeons who had earlier been rejected can be recognised and help perform much-needed operations.\nThese surgeons are part of the Parallel Pathway Programme (PPP) which has since 2016 allowed the Health Ministry to directly train its medical officers to become specialists in public hospitals, without the need to go back to universities.\nHowever, a differing view held by the Malaysian Medical Council (MMC), which governs the medical profession and education, has made it hard for such specialists to be recognised.\nALSO READ: From hair to heart and lungs – a history of surgeons\nHealth Minister Datuk Seri Dr Dzulkefly Ahmad said in a statement on Tuesday that the Cabinet would soon decide on amendments to the Act.\n“Given the critical shortage of medical specialists in public hospitals, the ministry intends to ask the Cabinet to expedite the proposed amendments, hopefully in June’s third session of Parliament.\n“Concurrently, efforts to bolster specialists training through home-grown master’s programmes will be intensified,” he added.\nThe issue became public when four Malaysian heart and lung trainee surgeons – the least available specialists in Malaysia – failed to become full surgeons despite passing their examinations under the cardiothoracic surgery PPP.\nALSO READ: He teaches neurosurgeons, but can’t be one in M’sia\nThey were awarded Fellowships of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh (RCSEd) but MMC refused to recognise their fellowships.\nThere are only 14 heart and lung surgeons in public service now and several are retiring in a few years, while there are over 1,500 heart and lung disease patients urgently needing surgery.\nLaunched in 2016, the Health Ministry’s PPP for heart and lung surgery was its first effort. The ministry has since developed 14 other specialist PPP training systems in the fields of urology, plastic surgery, anaesthesiology, family medicine, as well as obstetrics and gynaecology, to name a few.\nThese systems make it possible for the ministry to train its own doctors to become specialists, under the guidance of bodies such as the RCSEd instead of waiting for local public and private universities to produce postgraduate specialists.\nHowever, conflicting opinions within MMC appears to be complicating the process.\nThe matter has also gained international attention when RCSEd president Prof Rowan W Parks, wrote a four-page letter to express concerns to Dzulkefly while Ireland ambassador Orla Tunney and UK deputy high commissioner David Wallace visited the minister.\n“This goes against the principle of the partnership and work undertaken at the request of the ministry and places trained excellent surgeons in an untenable, distressing and unfair position,” Prof Parks wrote.\nPPP training for government heart and lung surgeons was started by the Health Ministry, Academy of Medicine Malaysia, Malaysian Association for Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery and RCSEd in 2016.\nAs of now, 32 candidates have entered the training, four of whom completed it, while another eight have successfully passed their exit examinations, said Prof Parks.\nThis means there are now 12 newly-qualified Malaysian heart and lung surgeons but they are in a limbo as they remain unrecognised by MMC.\nProf Parks also said RCSEd were willing to meet MMC on its concerns over the PPP training, examination and qualification.\nThe Medical Act 1971 gives MMC broad powers to manage and decide on all matters concerning medical practitioners.\nMMC is headed by the Health director-general and comprises appointed and elected medical professionals from the government, private sector and universities.\nTunney, in a statement to The Star, confirmed meeting with Dzulkefly about the Malaysian-Ireland Training Programme for Family Medicine, which is adopted as PPP training for family medicine specialists in Malaysia.\nThis is part of partnership between RCS of Ireland and University College Dublin, which has foreign campus status in Penang.\n“There are currently 378 Malaysian doctors enrolled, in addition to the 22 who have already graduated,” she said.\nWallace said UK medical institutions have been working in partnership with Malaysian counterparts to equip healthcare providers with the knowledge and expertise to keep pace with the evolving needs of a modern healthcare system.\nOpen Modal ×",

O IPMA emitiu na quarta-feira um aviso amarelo para todas as ilhas do arquipélago dos Açores (grupos Oriental, Central e Ocidental) por causa da \"precipitação por vezes forte, podendo ser acompanhada de trovoada\". O aviso amarelo vigorava nas ilhas das Flores e do Corvo, que constituem o grupo Ocidental do arquipélago, entre as 14:00 locais (mais uma hora em Lisboa) e as 23:00 de hoje, mas o IPMA prolongou-o até às 05:00 de sexta-feira. Para o grupo Central (ilhas do Faial, Pico, São Jorge, Graciosa e Terceira) o mesmo aviso vigorava das 20:00 de hoje às 11:00 de sexta-feira, tendo sido alargado para as 14:00 de sexta-feira. Nas ilhas de São Miguel e de Santa Maria, que constituem o grupo Oriental açoriano, o aviso amarelo por precipitação \"por vezes forte\" foi na quarta-feira declarado para o período entre as 02:00 e as 23:00 de sexta-feira, mas foi hoje estendido até às 05:00 de sábado. O aviso amarelo, o menos grave de uma escala de três, é emitido sempre que existe uma situação de risco para determinadas atividades dependentes da situação meteorológica.",

    "text": "Living\nWoman Takes Son Out Of School Early To ‘Make Memories’ With Dying Dog\nA woman was determined to give her kids one last special day with their beloved family dog, even if it meant cutting school short for the day.\nTo some, dogs are more than simply pets; they're family. It therefore follows that the death of a canine companion can sometimes feel like the loss of a family member.\nA 2015 study published in the journal Anthrozoos concluded that human grief following the death of a pet often depends on the \"level of attachment\" and the bonds formed.\nGiven that dogs live longer, require more human interaction and even share some basic human characteristics, it's perhaps logical that the death of a canine would hit hard.\nThe death of Buddy, Natasha Hopper's 11-year-old dog hit her family hard. \"I got him when he was 8 weeks old around Valentine's Day,\" Hopper told Newsweek. \"He loved going to the field and being able to chase the birds and even the footballs when kids were playing. He also loved getting toys and it being his mission to get the squeak out of it.\"\nHopper, who is from Kent in the U.K., shared a special bond with Buddy. \"He'd lay at the end of my bed but he'd come and bury himself under the covers through the night,\" she said.\nIt was a similar story with her children. Some dogs have been known to express unhappiness or jealousy following the arrival of a baby on the scene. Buddy was different though.\n\"When the kids were babies he'd be by their side throughout the day, I've got a picture of him and my son where Buddy's on the changing mat and my son was next to it where he had rolled off.\"\nBuddy seemed to instinctively know how to behave around Hopper's kids. \"My son's autistic and whenever he was having a meltdown he would be by his side,\" Hopper said. \"As my daughter got older he'd sit next to her when playing dress up and always let her put headbands on him.\"\nFor over a decade, Buddy was a beloved part of the family, but over Christmas, Hopper noticed he kept getting sick and was off his food. Hopper took him to the vet where he underwent blood tests. A few days later, an ultrasound confirmed her worst fears: Buddy had cancer.\nA large tumor was found on his spleen. The veterinarians told Hopper they could operate and remove the tumor but the blood test results suggested it was \"likely to already be elsewhere\" and, given his age, the surgery would likely only delay the inevitable.\nHopper and her vet came to an agreement that saw Buddy prescribed a week's worth of pain medication and steroids, at the end of which he would be put to sleep. That time would give Hopper and her family a chance to say goodbye to the dog who had meant so much to all of them. She was determined to make the most of it.\n\"I decided to go collect my eldest son from school early,\" Hopper said. \"We took Buddy to McDonald's so he could have a burger and all went down to the beach, he slept in the car all the way home and he had all his favourite treats and cuddles back at home.\"\nHopper shared some highlights from their day in a video posted to her TikTok @tashalouise_95 showing their efforts to \"make memories\" with their beloved dog.\nHopper was appreciative of her son's school for allowing him this time. They understood that dogs like Buddy are more than pets. \"His school was brilliant and couldn't have been better with the support they gave,\" Hopper said.\nThe next morning, Hopper took Buddy to the vet. \"It was the hardest decision I've ever had to make but the right one for him,\" she said. The family has been in mourning ever since.\n\"My son has been very emotional and struggling to come to terms with it,\" Hopper said. \"My daughter is too young to fully understand, she still believes he's coming home.\"\nThough it will take time for them, Hopper has no regrets about being honest with her kids about the situation. More than anything else, she's just happy that they got to spend one final day together as a family.\n\"It meant the world,\" she said. \"Being on the beach and Buddy running between the children and myself showing his true protector self, I know he'll forever be by our side and my children will forever talk about that day.\"\nRelated Articles\n2025 NEWSWEEK DIGITAL LLC.\nThis story was originally published January 23, 2025 at 3:11 PM.",
