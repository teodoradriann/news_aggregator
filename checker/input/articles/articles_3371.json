    "text": "Living\nThese schools don’t just teach kids. They help families build ‘a community where we all work together’\nSAN DIEGO - When Lucero Alejandra Cardenas moved to the United States with her family from Mexico four years ago, it wasn't an easy transition.\nHer oldest son, now 10 years old, suffered from anxiety and struggled to learn English at his first school. Cardenas had a difficult time, too. She didn't speak any English herself, and she says it was hard to navigate her new life, raising a family with young sons without being able to talk with teachers about their progress.\n\"It's frustrating having to communicate with some teachers and not even know how to help,\" Cardenas said in Spanish.\nBut she noticed a difference - for her children and herself - when she moved her son to Fay Elementary School in City Heights.\nFor the last two years, Fay Elementary School has been a community school - part of a state-level program designed to strengthen the partnership between local schools and their communities by providing school-specific resources for families and students.\nSan Diego County already has 142 such schools, 25 of them in San Diego Unified. The district plans to have another 10 of its campuses become community schools this fall.\n\"It is a collaborative process. We share ideas, seek input, and work with the surrounding community to deliver the resources that support each community, both inside and outside of the classroom,\" Fabi Bagula, the district's interim superintendent, has said of the expansion. \"The needs are different in each school community, and the opportunity to tailor the services provided is what makes this a truly special effort.\"\nAt Fay, those offerings include adult English language classes and workshops for parents and guardians, as well as a food pantry, a washer and dryer on campus and a range of partnerships to connect families with other local organizations' resources.\nCardenas' son started at Fay in 2021, and she says it was clear from the beginning that it was a better fit. His English started to improve. He was less stressed. And recently - he's now in fourth grade - he passed his English language proficiency assessment.\nCardenas has experienced her own personal development, too. She enrolled in the English language classes and took a workshop on the neuroscience of teaching and learning and social emotional development to gain more skills for raising her three children - who range in age from 2 to 10.\nLast September, she even was hired at the school as a campus supervisor, keeping an eye on students during lunch and recess and helping as an aide during classes.\n\"The programs teach me how to work on my patience, and they also teach me how to participate here at school,\" Cardenas said.\nAnd learning English has meant she can help her kids with their homework and better communicate with their teachers. \"They give me the opportunity to enter their classrooms and participate with them,\" she said.\nThat's a key goal of the program, created by a 2021 state law and expanded the following year in an effort to forge better relationships between local schools, governments and communities.\n‘A light in the dark'\nBut identifying what each community school should offer is a process.\nWithin San Diego Unified, each community school focuses on different top-priority areas of need, such as wellness, engagement, enrichment, attendance, safety and basic needs. Then, each school focuses on different areas within those categories where it most needs to improve - and how, with the help of a survey shared with families, students and community partners.\nThree-quarters of the school community needs to participate in the survey. Fay managed to hit 85%, thanks to a combination of movie nights, lunches and a volunteer appreciation day.\nAt Fay, which serves more than 500 students from around 400 families, the survey identified the top areas of improvement as behavior, communication and learning environment, said Daniel Castillo, the campus' community schools program coordinator.\nThen they began to create programming based on what the community wanted.\nParents said they wanted to learn English and to better understand their children.\nSo Fay partners with the San Diego College of Continuing Education for language courses, which focus on language skills centered around family and community. And the UC San Diego Extended Studies' education and outreach department works with Fay to hold its parenting workshops.\nThe students, meanwhile, wanted more sports. So the school now partners with Crawford High School for the kids to play soccer, and with Pro Kids, First Tee for twice-a-week golf clinics. Pro Kids offers annual student memberships for free to Fay students.\n\"Golf has that stereotype that is usually for older folks with more money,\" said Eduardo Corona, Pro Kids program director. \"City Heights is a pretty diverse community, and golf is usually not in the picture. So when they hear that they have an opportunity to play golf, it stands out.\"\nThere's also a partnership with Say San Diego, which has a full-time staffer to help families connect with housing support, clothing and food, and with the International Relief Teams, which provide food for families in need.\nCommunity members at large can also connect with resources through the school, including enrolling in the adult language class and accessing donated clothes. But the focus of the programming is on the families and students.\n\"We're trying to make it basically a resource hub,\" Castillo said. \"They can come in and not just see the school as a learning place, but also as a place to support them, to help them, like a light in the dark.\"\n‘They start getting involved'\nThe effort to get the community of students' families involved has paid off. Those families are coming together and building relationships across language barriers, Castillo said - especially since parents and guardians often prefer hearing from each other rather than from the school.\nCardenas has experienced that first-hand. She's in a WhatsApp chat with a group of moms to stay connected, and she's seen how the supportive network helps them feel more comfortable and eager to be a part of the school community.\n\"Sometimes they come in with fear and see all the help available, and they start getting involved,\" she said.\nAt Fay, creating a safe school community and addressing those fears is paramount.\nNearly all of its students are economically disadvantaged. More than half are English language learners. And chronic absenteeism has been a persistent problem, one that school officials have gotten more proactive in addressing as immigration enforcement fears affect their community.\nTo help reverse attendance declines, Castillo and other staff members have gone to families' homes to try to understand why some students weren't coming to school. There are many reasons a student can be chronically absent, he said, and they're trying to identify ways to help.\n\"They used to not open the door, but now they see us as something positive,\" he said.\nThat development of trust has become more important since the Trump administration rescinded a longstanding federal policy that limited immigration enforcement at sensitive locations including schools. As fear from families threatened to worsen absenteeism, Fay offered families presentations to inform them of their rights.\nIt's personal for Castillo. He himself immigrated as a child and was a recipient of the Obama-era deportation protection known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, and he can relate to many of the families his school serves.\n\"We're here to really protect your kids,\" he said.\n‘Teach the whole child'\nTo fifth-grade teacher Kinsey Klug, it's especially important for students to feel safe and loved at school, so they can make mistakes and learn. She's seen leaps in school morale over the years.\nThe PTA has gone from basically nonexistent to thriving. And she was recently able to take her students to the San Diego Zoo Safari Park, where they rode the Africa Tram and admired the savannah animals up close.\n\"A lot of these kids come in the door with so much more loaded into their backpack than just their books or their computer,\" she said. \"We have kids that have faced trauma, kids that have escaped war-torn countries.\"\n\"You have to take all of those things into account,\" she added. \"You've got to teach the whole child, not just the fifth-graders sitting in front of you.\"\nThat can be tough when she's teaching literacy. Her classroom has 36 students who speak a wide range of languages and whose skills range from the level of kindergarten to sixth grade and above.\nA diagnostic assessment helps her understand where all her students stand - in phonics, in vocabulary and in comprehension for literature. But she usually has a group of newcomers for whom she starts with the basics.\n\"I really try and just focus on the need of the student, not what their native language is,\" she said.\nFor Cardenas, her son's advancing English language skills have not only helped him academically since moving to the U.S. but are helping her learn the language, too. \"He's like my translator,\" she says.\nBut through the adult language classes, she's getting better at English on her own.\nThis element of the community schools - where parents themselves are able to grow as caregivers and experience personal development - is key, Cardenas says.\n\"Sometimes, as a mother, it's hard to move forward. I abandon myself to be with my family, with my children, and I don't think about myself,\" she said. \"So this is my favorite part. It's where I get the chance to keep an eye on my children, but I'm also growing as a person.\"\nAnd the bonds being forged between families, children and the school feel like they are creating a lasting network.\n\"It's no longer seen as help,\" she says, \"but rather as a community where we all work together.\"\nCopyright (C) 2025, Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

Marco Cantile/LightRocket via Getty Images hide caption\ntoggle caption Marco Cantile/LightRocket via Getty Images Big news for history buffs and the morbidly curious: An ancient Roman beach is now open to the public for the first time since it was destroyed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD.\nThe beach at the Herculaneum archaeological park, located in the southern Italian region of Campania, opened on Wednesday after a multi-year restoration project.\n\"Today, after three years of intensive work aimed at the enhancement of the ancient beach of the Herculaneum excavations, by draining and filling the area formerly occupied by the sandy shore, visitors are given free access over the entire area and an understanding of the dynamics that led to the burial of the city,\" said Carabinieri Brigadier General Giovanni Capasso, who oversees the Great Pompeii Unit.\nAbbiamo riaperto l’antica spiaggia di Herculaneum, all’interno del Parco Archeologico di Ercolano.\nIl nostro impegno sta ridando splendore e valore a questo luogo.\nGrazie al direttore Francesco Sirano e al personale per il loro impegno. pic.twitter.com/tEvpl6YBwP\n— Gennaro Sangiuliano (@g_sangiuliano) June 20, 2024 Herculaneum — named for the Greek god Hercules — is believed to have been founded by the Oscans in the 7th century BC and dominated by Rome in 90 BC. Its location on Italy's west coast and mild climate made it a popular resort town for Rome's patrician families.\nIt was much smaller (both demographically and geographically) than the city of Pompeii, about 10 miles to the south. Both were destroyed in the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, buried by clouds of ash and volcanic debris that preserved them in place for centuries.\nHistory That's no pizza: A wall painting found in Pompeii doesn't depict Italy's iconic dish Herculaneum lay buried longer, beneath some 50 meters of ash, until it was discovered by accident in 1709 as a worker drilled a well for a monastery.\nA series of excavations of the site during the 18th and 19th centuries uncovered parts of buildings, ornate works of art, papyrus scrolls and other artifacts.\nBut archaeologists found few human remains in Herculaneum, unlike the perfectly preserved casts of bodies at Pompeii. That led them to believe that most of the city's inhabitants had been able to escape the volcano's wrath in the direction of Naples.\nSubsequent digs in the 1980s and '90s, however, uncovered the skeletons of more than 300 people in stone boathouses near the beach.\nHistory A team of students deciphered a 2000-year-old papyrus scroll, with some help from AI Researchers now believe that they died from the heat as they waited in vain to be rescued by Pliny the Elder , a Roman statesman who died while attempting to save civilians by boat. One 2020 study suggests the heat from the eruption was so intense that it turned one victim's brain into glass.\nA view of the skeletons of the fugitive victims of the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 AD on the ancient beach, open to the public for the first time, in the archaeological excavations of Herculaneum. Marco Cantile/LightRocket via Getty Images hide caption\ntoggle caption Marco Cantile/LightRocket via Getty Images The human remains hold clues for researchers about how inhabitants of Herculaneum both lived and died.\nOne famous skeleton, for example, is referred to as the \" Ringed Lady ,\" because of the emerald and ruby rings sparkling on her finger. Another, first discovered in the 1980s near the remains of a boat, is now thought to belong to a senior Roman soldier likely sent on a rescue mission, based on his belt and weapons.\nAnd in their most recent dig in 2021, archaeologists uncovered the remains and personal belongings of a man they are calling \" the last fugitive .\" The black and reddish bones (stained by blood, experts say) of a man believed to be between 40 and 45 years old were found just steps away from the shoreline.\nHe was clutching a satchel. Inside was a wooden box containing a ring, made of iron or bronze.\n“He was possibly escaping with his treasures,\" conservator Nunzia Laino told The Guardian at the time.\nThe boathouses, with their arched entryways and skeleton replicas , are still visible at the beach.\nPlanet Money The Second Biggest Disaster at Mount Vesuvius Park director Francesco Sirano said in a news release that the conservation work aimed to reduce the risk of flooding, restore the original level of the beach and bring back sand, to \"let everyone walk on the beach again.\"\n\"If we turn our heads to where the sea once was, we become modern explorers of the immense blanket of volcanic flows that covered the city in a few hours,\" he added. \"And we cannot help ourselves from sharing almost the sense of total annihilation of our human condition in the face of the evidence of [the] cataclysm of 79 AD.\"\nThe beach area is one of multiple sites visitors can explore at Herculaneum. Other popular attractions open to the public include well-preserved baths, an underground theater and luxurious residences with elaborate mosaics .",

    "title": "10 Best Shrubby Salvias that Grow Tall and Big",
    "text": "Shrubby Salvias bloom the longest and Grow Big and Tall, giving the garden volume and a mosaic-like richness! With cultivars for every season, shrubby salvias grow tall, big, and bouncy and produce long-lasting, nectar-filled blooms in pigmented hues—a magnet for bees, butterflies, and hummingbirds! Let’s explore.\nWhy Grow Shrubby Salvias? Immaculate in any garden setting—borders, underplants to flowering shrubs like roses, mixed beds, and hedges—shrubby salvias are also superb container plants that thrive in patios, balconies, and windowsills.\nDrought-tolerant, deer-resistant, and excellent companions to other vegetation, nearly all salvia varieties have leaves that give blackcurrant-to-minty fragrance when crushed and are effective at preventing fungal diseases and certain pests.\n Thriving in light, free-draining soil, and ample sunshine, these big salvias may all not survive extreme cold except for a few varieties when the soil is frosty and wet. Winter is a good time to salvage your salvias and move the potted ones indoors. You could also back them up by saving cuttings!\nBest Shrubby Salvias In this article, we will explore the best shrubby salvias with exquisite, bushy foliage and flowers that often last 4-5 months, even into the first frost!\n1. Hot Lips\nBotanical Name : Salvia microphylla ‘Hot Lips’\nUSDA Zones : 8-10\nLet’s kickstart our shrubby list with the hardy Salvia microphylla and dive into its popular Hot Lips cultivar! Growing over three feet tall and wide, this compact, bushy cultivar features spikes of beautiful white-red blooms and lip-shaped petals.\nWith scalloped, light green foliage, this heat-tolerant variety thrives in well-drained soil, tolerates both full sun and part shade, and is effective in mass planting, hedges, groundcover, or as an accent plant, and pairs well with the aromatic lavender.\n2. Wild Watermelon\nBotanical Name : Salvia microphylla ‘Wild Watermelon’\nUSDA Zones : 7-9\nAnother shrubby S.microphylla cultivar is Wild Watermelon, emerging from Cerro Potosi mountain in Mexico. Growing up to 3-4 feet tall and wide, this fruity-fragrant variety sports small leaves and tubular flowers in magenta that bloom from mid-summer to late fall.\nSuitable for dry terrains once established, this cultivar attracts hummingbirds, honeybees, and hummingbirds, making it perfect for creating native, wildlife rich mini-habitats.\n3. Autumn Sage Instagram Botanical Name : Salvia greggii\nUSDA Zones : 6-9\nHow about a salvia sub-shrub that’s always in bloom? Native to North America, Autumn sage is another quintessential shrubby species that can grow up to five feet tall and wide, and blooms from March all the way to November .\nS.greggii sports smooth-edged, minty leaves unlike S.microphylla’s ribbed ones, and boasts tall racemes of tubular blooms from pastel to deep shades of red, purple, pink, and orange. Check out shrubby cultivars like ‘Salmon,’ ‘Teresa,’ and ‘ Furman’s Red ‘ for bushy hedges.\n4. Jame Sage\nBotanical Name : Salvia × jamensis\nUSDA Zones : 8-12\nJame Sage is primarily a cross between microphylla and greggii, perhaps with some other species thrown in! It is a hardy shrubby salvia hybrid with small, aromatic toothed leaves and grows up to three feet tall and wide.\nPopular cultivars include ‘Nachtvlinder’ with rich violet blooms, ‘Tangerine Ballet’ with sorbet hues in pink and orange, and several others! Thriving in well-draining soils, it is drought-tolerant once established, and easy to maintain.\n5. Mexican Bush Sage Instagram Botanical Name : Salvia leucantha\nUSDA Zones : 7-10\nNow, this shrubby salvia isn’t all that cold-tolerant, and cannot withstand harsh winters! Mexican bush sage has arching stems and soft foliage that are a pretty gray-green to silver color, making for one of the best border plants.\nPerfect for late-season container gardens, it produces stunning purple and white flowers that emerge from its mound-like velvety foliage, which can grow up to three feet tall. This variety likes plenty sun, and rich, well-drained, moist soil.\n6. Jezebel\nBotanical Name : Salvia ‘Jezebel’\nUSDA zones : 8-10\nJezebel is a tall hybrid sage that’s covered with bright pink-red flowers that bloom throughout the summer and fall. It’s great for rock gardens, beds, and containers and needs 6-8 hours of direct sunlight to thrive.\nMake sure you plant it in well-drained, acidic soil. It’s also great for cut flower arrangements .\n7. Purple & Yellow Yunnan Sage\nBotanical Name : Salvia Bulleyana\nUSDA Zones : 5-9\nThis Chinese species from the Yunnan province features custard yellow flowers with purple-blue tips. The blooms tower over this variety’s soft, hairy, shrubby foliage, which reaches about two feet in height with a wider spread.\nTolerating extreme cold as well as heat, this sage enjoys a moderate bit of hydration unlike other varieties on this list. Plant it on garden borders, in containers, cottage gardens, and even in wildlife gardens—it’s versatile and easy to care for.\n8. Pineapple Sage\nBotanical Name : Salvia elegans\nUSDA Zones : 8-11\nThe Pineapple sage is a semi-woody, herbaceous shrub that has a clumping growth habit with open branches covered with yellow-green fuzzy leaves and serrated edges. There are many cultivars of the Pineapple sage, some of which can easily grow 5 feet in height.\nIf not grown in frost-free regions, these plants die back after hard frosts. However, they reappear in spring if the weather is mild enough. In colder areas, they can be grown as an annual, thanks to their fast growth habit.\n9. Cleveland Sage Reddit Botanical Name : Salvia clevelandii\nUSDA Zones : 9-11\nThis shrubby sage is well known for its spreading habit, growing up to four feet tall, but nearly eight feet wide! The foliage of Cleveland sage is gray-green, and it also has blue, purple, or lavender flowers on tall stalks that make it stand out.\nIt’s pretty low maintenance and needs about 6-7 hours of full sun like other salvia varieties . Not too much water, though.\n10. Clary Sage\nBotanical Name : Salvia sclarea\nUSDA Zones : 5a-9b\nClary sage is a short-lived perennial that’s cherished in the essential oil industry for its healing properties. It’s bigger than most on this list, easily crossing the 6-foot mark in height, and has bell-shaped flowers of pink and white.\nThis popular Mediterranean native thrives in full sun with moderate watering, and it’ll bloom from June to August.",

    "title": "Copernicus: 2024 was first year on record to breach 1.5°C threshold",
    "text": "Earth’s temperature remained 1.5°C above the pre-industrial average throughout all of last year, representing the first calendar-long breach of the milestone on record. Copernicus, European Union's climate change monitoring service, said the global temperature of 15.10°C was 0.12°C above 2023's temperature, the previous warmest year. It was also 1.60°C higher than the pre-fossil fuel era 1850-1900 temperature estimate. Scientists said the figures suggested it was now “very likely” the world fail to reach its 2060 global warming targets. Akshay Deoras, a research scientist at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science and the Department of Meteorology at the University of Reading told<i> The National</i> that the milestone shows humanity is “treating our planet like a credit card with no limit”. “The annual global temperature crossing the 1.5°C mark for the first time in 2024 shows the bill is coming, which unfortunately could lead to a further increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events across the globe,” Mr Deoras said. To breach the Paris Agreement, the average global temperature over a period of at least 20 years must exceed the temperature recorded during the pre-industrial period, from 1850–1900, by at least 1.5°C, he said. “Whilst we are yet to breach the Paris Agreement, several consecutive months since summer 2023 have been warmer by at least 1.5°C, showing how serious the problem of global warming is. The more often 1.5°C threshold gets breached, the closer we would be to the breaching of the Paris Agreement,” he said. “We're already seeing homes become uninsurable and disasters costing billions. This isn't about future generations any more – it's about us, today. We are on track to see new warming records getting broken, unless we immediately cut down the emission of greenhouse gases,” added Mr Deoras. During the first half of the year, which was the world's hottest on record, each month registered higher readings than the same month in any previous year, leading to a 13-month streak of record-breaking temperatures. Global temperature remained significantly above average in the second half, which saw the world set a record daily global average temperature of 17.16°C on July 22. It was the warmest year for all continental regions, except Antarctica and Australasia, as well as for sizeable parts of the ocean, particularly the North Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and the western Pacific Ocean. Around Antarctica, sea ice reached record or near-record low values during a large part of the year, while in the Arctic, the sea ice extent was relatively close to its 1991–2020 average until July, but fell well below average in the following months. At its annual minimum in September, levels were fifth lowest in the satellite record. Carlo Buontempo, Director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service said he was “running out of metaphors” to explain the warming. “The many record breaking events that we have seen over the course of the last 12 months are not statistical oddities, but rather a direct consequence of the generalised warming of our climate system,” he said. “The underlying physics is very clear. A warmer global climate produces more frequent and intense events, such as for example, heatwaves. A warmer atmosphere also holds more moisture, leading to heavier rainfall, where warmer seas amplify the potential for destructive storms,” he added. The Paris Agreement’s long-term goal to limit global warming to 1.5°C was chosen to avoid the most severe effects of climate change, albeit with more common extreme heatwaves and droughts compared to today. Under this scenario, the world is expected to exceed 1.5°C from 2030 before dropping below 1.5°C by 2060. Samantha Burgess, strategic lead for climate at Copernicus, told a press conference on Thursday that 2024’s milestone means it is “very likely” the world will overshoot the target. “Given that we have had our first calendar year of 1.5ºC, there is an extremely high likelihood that we will overshoot the long-term average of 1.5ºC and the Paris Agreement limit. “However, my personal opinion is that this is an extraordinarily important policy that all countries around the world have committed to, so I don’t think it’s fair to say the Paris Agreement is dead. And I think if we do overshoot 1.5ºC, which has a high probability associated with it, the next target does not automatically deflect to 2ºC, but the next target becomes 1.51ºC. And the sooner we get to net zero emissions, the sooner we will stabilise our climate and reduce the potential impacts of future extreme events.” According to the Carbon Brief, if warming exceeds 1.5°C beyond 2100 and peaks at 1.89°C, sea-levels will rise by 20cm in more than 70 per cent of the Earth's coastlines. To achieve this, greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced by 9.2 per cent from current global levels. If warming continues to rise, peaking at 2.69°C by 2100, the world would pass a catastrophic point of no return, with the loss of all ice sheets, sea level rises of several metres, extreme heatwaves occurring most years and the drying out of the Amazon rainforest. Warming of 4°C would result in unprecedented heatwaves, severe drought and major flooding, creating millions of global climate refugees. Wide-scale adaptation to global sea rise would also be necessary.",
