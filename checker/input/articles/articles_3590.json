    "text": "- WTI price may regain its ground due to supply concerns amid rising tensions between Israel and Iran.\n- CBS journalist reported that US officials have been told that Israel is fully prepared to launch an operation into Iran.\n- Oil prices may receive support from improved optimism for energy demand as US-China trade tensions ease.\nWest Texas Intermediate (WTI) Oil price pulled back from a two-month high of $67.82, currently trading around $66.50 per barrel during the early European hours on Thursday. However, the crude Oil prices may regain their ground due to increased fears over supply disruptions, sparked by the escalating tensions between Israel and Iran.\nAccording to a Reuters report, the United States (US) decided to scale back American personnel in the Middle East. CBS News senior White House correspondent Jennifer Jacobs reported that US officials have been told that Israel is fully ready to launch an operation into Iran.\nUS President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that the US would not permit Iran to have a nuclear weapon, per Reuters. The US and Iran are expected to meet on Sunday for nuclear talks. Axios reporter Barak Ravid reported that White House envoy Steve Witkoff is going to meet Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi in Muscat on Sunday to discuss the Iranian response to the recent US proposal.\nOil prices also receive support as optimism for energy demand increases amid easing trade tensions between the US and China, the two largest Oil consumers. Trump posted on Truth Social on Wednesday, saying that the trade deal with China is done and added that it is subject to his and Chinese President Xi Jinping's final approval. \"We are getting a total of 55% tariffs, China is getting 10%. Relationship is excellent! Thank you for your attention to this matter,\" Trump said on Wednesday.\nHowever, China is prepared to grant only six-month rare-earth export licenses for US automakers and manufacturers, which shows that China wants to have control over critical minerals as leverage in future talks, per the Wall Street Journal (gated).\nMoreover, the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) released Crude Oil Stocks Change, showing a decline of 3.6 million barrels in Oil inventories in the previous week, exceeding forecasts of a 2 million-barrel decline.\nWTI Oil FAQs\nWTI Oil is a type of Crude Oil sold on international markets. The WTI stands for West Texas Intermediate, one of three major types including Brent and Dubai Crude. WTI is also referred to as “light” and “sweet” because of its relatively low gravity and sulfur content respectively. It is considered a high quality Oil that is easily refined. It is sourced in the United States and distributed via the Cushing hub, which is considered “The Pipeline Crossroads of the World”. It is a benchmark for the Oil market and WTI price is frequently quoted in the media.\nLike all assets, supply and demand are the key drivers of WTI Oil price. As such, global growth can be a driver of increased demand and vice versa for weak global growth. Political instability, wars, and sanctions can disrupt supply and impact prices. The decisions of OPEC, a group of major Oil-producing countries, is another key driver of price. The value of the US Dollar influences the price of WTI Crude Oil, since Oil is predominantly traded in US Dollars, thus a weaker US Dollar can make Oil more affordable and vice versa.\nThe weekly Oil inventory reports published by the American Petroleum Institute (API) and the Energy Information Agency (EIA) impact the price of WTI Oil. Changes in inventories reflect fluctuating supply and demand. If the data shows a drop in inventories it can indicate increased demand, pushing up Oil price. Higher inventories can reflect increased supply, pushing down prices. API’s report is published every Tuesday and EIA’s the day after. Their results are usually similar, falling within 1% of each other 75% of the time. The EIA data is considered more reliable, since it is a government agency.\nOPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) is a group of 12 Oil-producing nations who collectively decide production quotas for member countries at twice-yearly meetings. Their decisions often impact WTI Oil prices. When OPEC decides to lower quotas, it can tighten supply, pushing up Oil prices. When OPEC increases production, it has the opposite effect. OPEC+ refers to an expanded group that includes ten extra non-OPEC members, the most notable of which is Russia.\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

Trade uncertainties and sustained US Dollar weakness on dovish Fed bets support the main currency pair. Attention now turns to ECB-speak and US PPI inflation data.\nGBP/USD pares gains toward 1.3550 after downbeat UK data\nGBP/USD is paring back gains toward 1.3550 in European trading on Thursday. The UK GDP fell by 0.3% in April, compared to a 0.1% decline expected while the industial data missed forecasts, exerting downward pressure on the Pound Sterling.\nGold price retains positive bias near weekly high; could climb further amid safe-haven buying\nGold price sticks to modest intraday gains near the weekly top heading into the European session on Wednesday and remains well supported by a combination of factors. The optimism over a positive outcome from the high-stakes US-China trade talks faded in the wake of US President Donald Trump's fresh tariff threat.\nLitecoin struggles below resistance, bearish bets hit monthly high\nLitecoin is showing signs of weakness on Thursday as it fails to break above its key resistance level. The price action emerges as a classic dead-cat bounce pattern, which favors bears. The technical outlook suggests that sidelined traders looking to short LTC could consider entry points between $93 and $95.\nUS and China agree to implement the implementation of the already-agreed consensus\nAfter two days of back-and-forth in London, the U.S.–China trade circus wrapped with what can only be described as a diplomatic tautology: a late-night announcement that both sides have “agreed in principle on a framework to implement the Geneva consensus”.",

    "title": "Eager for Christian votes, Trump stokes religious insecurity - The Washington Post",
    "text": "By occupation, Donald Trump is a salesman. In 2015, he shifted from selling products and condominiums bearing the Trump label to selling Trump directly: himself. And he has proved to be very good at it. To a religious audience, this presentation is more potent. A struggle between good and evil over the fate of the world is essential to many religious traditions and certainly to the right-wing evangelical Protestants to whom Trump most often tries to appeal. So when speaking to Christian conservatives — as Trump did on Thursday evening — the apocalyptic rhetoric and warnings of imminent doom carry an additional weight. Especially when Trump’s focus is on the threat to Christianity itself. Trump’s speech carried familiar doomsdayism. The audience was told, for example, that the whoevers had “unleashed mobs of foreign jihadists to praise Hamas in our streets — they’re praising Hamas while they slander law-abiding Americans as domestic terrorists.” They were told that there existed legislation allowing newborn babies to be killed in an extension of abortion rights. They were informed that a second Trump administration would “take back our education system from the communists and the freaks that are destroying it.” The “freaks” here presumably include those advocating the “transgender insanity” he mentioned in the next sentence. But his pitch was focused centrally on the need for Christians to rally around him and his candidacy. “How any Christian can vote for a Democrat — Christian, or person of faith, a person of faith — how you can vote for a Democrat is crazy,” he mused at one point. “It’s crazy. They’ve got to stop.” After all, he said later, Christians were under attack from the left. It was something he pledged to stop. “I will create a new federal task force on fighting anti-Christian bias. It’s become a very big term anti-Christian bias. Not believable that you have a term like that, is it? When you think about it, it’s like, where did that come from? And it’s very, very recent phenomena,” he said. “Its mission will be to investigate all forms of illegal discrimination, harassment and persecution against Christians in America.” Where it came from, of course, is the evolution of the backlash against America’s declining religiosity — an evolution to which Trump himself has eagerly contributed. The decline itself isn’t new. In 1976, Tom Wolfe wrote about the emergence of the “Me” generation, observing that, “since the late 1950s both the Catholic Church and the leading Protestant denominations had been aware that young people, particularly in the cities, were drifting away from the faith.” By the time Wolfe was writing, though, it wasn’t just young people. Nor was it just people on the left. Every four years, the American National Election Studies (ANES) survey evaluates the views of the public. Since the 1960s, there’s been a steady decline in the percentage of Americans who identify as Christian — across political groups. But most Democrats, like most Republicans, are still Christian. But Trump was speaking to a specific subset of American Christians: conservative Christians, a group that overlaps heavily with White evangelical Christians. In his two previous bids for the presidency, Trump has been the beneficiary of overwhelming evangelical support. Pew Research Center estimates that Trump won evangelicals by 60 points in 2016 and nearly 70 points four years later. Data from PRRI published in 2021, meanwhile, showed that there was a strong correlation between the percentage of White Christians in a county and Trump’s margin of support. Religious leaders are worried about the decline of religious participation, certainly, as they were in Wolfe’s day. There’s a reason that Jesus Christ was being advertised during the Super Bowl . But it’s mostly on the right that this extension of that insecurity, that sense of embattlement exists. YouGov polling from October (and regularly before that) shows that Republicans are more likely to say that Christians face discrimination than they are to say that Muslim people do — or than they are to say that Black people do. Of course, this is far less about religion than it is about culture. Conservative Christians who rally around Trump are not doing so because he is a strong Christian. Trump even joked about that during his speech on Thursday, admitting that he “may not know [the Bible] actually so well at all.” They rally around him because he promises to combat broader social change, change that provides space for non-conservative-Christian sentiments and values. There’s an irony to his rhetoric that Trump probably doesn’t recognize. One of the likely reasons that Republicans are faring better with Black Americans — which Gallup data suggests they are — is that younger Black Americans are less likely to regularly attend church services and Black Americans who don’t attend church are less likely to be Democrats. The erosion of the community that comes from regular church attendance correlates to an erosion of partisan loyalty among Black voters. But, again, Trump’s a salesman. He’s making a sales pitch to an audience. If atheists made up a fifth of the electorate (as evangelicals did in 2020 ) and responded fervently to Trump’s rhetoric, does anyone doubt that Trump would happily give speeches to atheist groups centered on how he would be their defender? In this case, he’s telling a group that feels as though it is losing cultural power that it is right and that he will ensure that it doesn’t. It worked in 2016 and 2020. Why shouldn’t it work now?

    "text": "Manifestação\nOs bispos católicos moçambicanos anunciaram ter decidido que “não se dê bênção” às “uniões irregulares e uniões do mesmo sexo”, apesar da decisão contrária anunciada pelo Vaticano.\n“Nós, os bispos, decidimos que em Moçambique não se dê bênção a uniões irregulares e uniões do mesmo sexo. Que o modelo de Igreja Família de Deus continue a ser o que inspira o nosso ser Igreja em Moçambique, e que Maria, Rainha da Família, guie e proteja as nossas famílias”, de acordo com um comunicado divulgado pela Conferência Episcopal de Moçambique (CEM).\nO Vaticano autorizou em 18 de dezembro, oficialmente, a bênção dos casais do mesmo sexo, “em situação irregular” para a Igreja, mantendo a oposição ao casamento homossexual.\nÉ a primeira vez que a Igreja se pronuncia claramente sobre a bênção dos casais do mesmo sexo, um assunto que gera tensões no interior da instituição, devido a uma forte oposição do setor conservador, nomeadamente nos Estados Unidos.\nEsta bênção não “será realizada ao mesmo tempo que os ritos civis de união, nem mesmo em relação a eles”, indicou, em documento, o Dicastério para a Doutrina da Fé, órgão da Santa Sé, aprovado pelo papa Francisco.\n“O documento, depois de ter apresentado a riqueza e variedade do conteúdo indicado pelo termo bênção, autoriza o ministro ordenado a abençoar casais irregulares ou do mesmo sexo, facto este que está a provocar no meio das nossas comunidades cristãs, e não só, questionamentos e perturbações”, reconhece a CEM.\n“A doutrina sobre o matrimónio e a família permanece inalterada porque, a bênção de que fala a Declaração, nada tem a ver com a liturgia e a celebração do sacramento do matrimónio, e a celebração deste sacramento não pode ser substituída de nenhum modo com uma bênção, como é prática nalgumas igrejas não católicas”, acrescentam os bispos, na mesma declaração.\nDefendem, contudo, que as pessoas que vivem em “situação de união irregular não devem ser afastadas da comunidade cristã, mas devem ser ajudadas, como todo o fiel, a adequar a sua vida à vontade de Deus por meio da proximidade da Igreja que conforta, cuida e infunde coragem”.\n“A Declaração [do Vaticano] afirma que a bênção apresentada como possível a ser invocada sobre uma união irregular ou do mesmo sexo, não pretende legitimar estas uniões. Porém, na mente de muitos fiéis e na linguagem comum, com o termo bênção entende-se o mesmo que legitimar o que se abençoa. Por isso, a CEM exorta todos os ministros ordenados para que manifestem proximidade e acompanhamento a quem vive em uniões irregulares”, conclui a declaração.\nApesar do não reconhecimento da Santa Sé, a bênção dos casais do mesmo sexo era já praticada por alguns padres, nomeadamente na Bélgica e na Alemanha.\nEsta declaração surgiu seis semanas depois do encerramento da assembleia geral do Sínodo para o Futuro da Igreja Católica, uma reunião mundial consultiva, durante a qual, bispos, mulheres e laicos, debateram temas da sociedade como o acolhimento de pessoas LGBT+ ou os casamentos de divorciados.\nNo início de outubro, cinco cardeais conservadores exigiram publicamente ao papa Francisco que reafirmasse a doutrina católica sobre os casais gay, mas o documento final do Sínodo deixou esta questão de parte.\nEm 2021, o Vaticano havia reafirmado que considerava a homossexualidade “um pecado” e confirmou a impossibilidade de os casais do mesmo sexo receberem o sagrado matrimónio.\nDesde a eleição, em 2013, que Francisco insiste na importância de uma Igreja “aberta a todos” e tomou várias medidas que suscitaram a ira dos conservadores.",
