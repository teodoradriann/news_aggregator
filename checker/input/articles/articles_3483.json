Something went wrong. Please try again later. More content below Oops! Something went wrong. Please try again later. More content below\nAmong the three opinions issued Thursday by the Supreme Court was one that shut down an attempt to trademark the double entendre “Trump too small.” The high court was unanimous on the bottom line that the rejection didn’t violate the First Amendment.\nBut the justices fractured on the reasoning in a way that calls into question how the Republican-led court goes about deciding cases generally — including gun cases .\nTo get a sense of the underlying split in the trademark case, Vidal v. Elster, look at the breakdown here , which may help to explain why it took this long to decide the appeal argued back in November:\n“On the bottom line, there is no dispute,” wrote Justice Clarence Thomas , who authored the opinion joined at various points by different justices, as shown above.\nBut beyond the bottom line, the justices were more divided.\nIn her concurrence, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote that “perhaps the biggest surprise (and disappointment) of today’s five-Justice majority opinion is its reliance on history and tradition as a dispositive test to resolve this case.” Joined by fellow Democratic appointees Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson , she called out Thomas’ citation of the 2022 ruling in Bruen (also authored by Thomas) that further expanded gun rights under a supposedly historical approach .\n“The majority attempts to reassure litigants and the lower courts that a ‘history-focused approac[h]’ here is sensible and workable” by citing Bruen, Sotomayor wrote. “To say that such reassurance is not comforting would be an understatement,” she went on, lamenting that “one need only read a handful of lower court decisions applying Bruen to appreciate the confusion this Court has caused.”\nShe cited an amicus brief that makes that point in the pending gun case of United States v. Rahimi , on the constitutionality of a law that bars gun possession for people subject to domestic violence restraining orders. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the law under Bruen, prompting the government to appeal to the justices.\nWe could learn as soon as Friday morning how the court attempts to settle that Second Amendment confusion in Rahimi, which forces the majority to confront the mess that it made in Bruen.\nSubscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for weekly updates on the top legal stories, including news from the Supreme Court, the Donald Trump cases and more.\nThis article was originally published on MSNBC.com\nView comments",

    "text": "Citizens want a 2024 without crime and more access to jobs Santo Domingo—A few days before the arrival of 2024, the hopes and wishes of many Dominicans who, as always, in addition to hoping that the year ending will be much better, wish that their requests will come true during the next 365 days. Some of these are the reduction of the high crime levels and more job opportunities expressed by citizens in a survey conducted by Hoy newspaper among citizens of the National District. Others do not fail to have extraordinary wishes, and Betania Perez expressed that the new year brings much prosperity and blessings to working people who never give up. Juan Amador, resident of Santo Domingo Oeste, asked for a healthy start to the year and more support for low-income people. Félix Montero, expressed the same opinion. Rafael Pontier, a resident of Ensanche la Fe, defined the high patrolling carried out by the National Police during the festivities as positive. However, he considers that this work should be carried out throughout the year, not only on special occasions. In this sense, Maria Lorenzo, who omitted to be photographed, said that people get up early. Still, they do not celebrate as before due to the increase in violence by criminals. The year 2023 has left many life lessons to the population. According to Marisol Paredes, a resident of Ensanche Kennedy, the year closes with many tragedies never seen before in such a short time, which should leave a lesson, including our rulers. More job opportunities Even though the government is permanently carrying out initiatives to create jobs and facilitate entrepreneurial opportunities for young people, some citizens expressed how difficult it is to get employment, pointing out the desire to improve that surrounds them. The concern extends to parents who fear for their children’s future and ask the authorities to pay more attention to the unemployed. Less inflation Andres Rijo, a merchant in La Esperilla, wishes that the cost of goods would not skyrocket and that it could be more sustainable for everyone regardless of social status. Another merchant, Manuel Larancuent, said inflation has hit him, forcing him to seek loans to meet his consumers’ demands. 2024 without crime is a hopeful daydream. The public has to wake-up and push comatose authorities to enforce the laws to lessen crime, if there is to be a change for the better. Build more jails and/or make tent city prisons. Get the criminals off the streets.",
