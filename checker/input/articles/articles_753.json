    "text": "NFL Wild Card Weekend parlay: Let's make some money We're heading into the NFL postseason, and we have 6 games on the schedule for NFL Wild Card Weekend. Weather is going to play a huge factor, which is something we'll be watching awfully close as it affects our plays. Saturday's K.C. outlook -- when the Kansas City Chiefs (11-6) host the Miami Dolphins (11-6) -- calls for 0 degrees with winds at 13-16 MPH. The good news is that there is no precipitation in the forecast. The same cannot be said for Orchard Park, N.Y., where the Pittsburgh Steelers (10-7) visit the Buffalo Bills (11-6) Sunday. They will not only face temperatures of 21 degrees, but there is a 60% chance of snow with 22-24 MPH winds. This season, the Under cashed at a 14-2-1 rate in games played with an average wind speed of 13 MPH or greater. Wrapping up the schedule Monday, rain is expected in Tampa. There is a 70% chance of the wet stuff, but at least temperatures will be in the upper 60's with a 6-8 MPH. After looking at [FanDuel Sportsbook's](https://wlfanduel.adsrv.eacdn.com/C.ashx?btag=a_27628b_2436c_&affid=11104&siteid=27628&adid=2436&c=) NFL Wild Card Weekend odds, here is our \"Let's make some money\" NFL parlay bet to cash in on among SportbookWire's [NFL expert picks and predictions](https://sportsbookwire.usatoday.com/category/nfl-odds-lines-spreads-picks-predictions/). We have 3 rematches from the regular season, too. In fact, the Cleveland Browns (11-6) and Houston Texans (10-7) just met in Week 16 at NRG Stadium in Houston with the Browns winning 36-22 as 3-point favorites with the Over (40) easily connecting. The Dolphins and Chiefs probably wish they could go back to Frankfurt, Germany, and play, instead of being in a refrigerator this weekend. Kansas City earned a 21-14 win over Miami in Germany back in Week 9, covering as a 1-point underdog as the Under (51.5) cashed. Lastly, the Philadelphia Eagles (11-6) and Tampa Bay Buccaneers (9-8) met for Monday Night Football in Tampa back in Week 3. Philadelphia came away with a 25-11 win and cover as a 5.5-point favorite as the Under (44) hit. That was a while ago, and Philly was playing much better football. They meet again in Tampa this Monday for the final game of the Wild Card round. FOOTBALL NEVER STOPS Live games, analysis and more 7 days a week: [Get ESPN+](https://go.web.plus.espn.com/GjNV9m) NFL Wild Card Weekend: Let's make some money parlay Odds provided by [FanDuel Sportsbook](https://wlfanduel.adsrv.eacdn.com/C.ashx?btag=a_27628b_2436c_&affid=11104&siteid=27628&adid=2436&c=); access [USA TODAY Sports Scores and Sports Betting Odds hub](https://sportsdata.usatoday.com/football/nfl/scores) for a full list. Lines last updated Friday at 12:01 a.m. ET. All games ET. Leg 1: DOLPHINS +4.5 (-110) at Chiefs – Saturday, 8 p.m. (Peacock) There is a lot being made out of geography ahead of this game. Obviously, the Dolphins play in tropical conditions more often than not, rarely having to deal with low temperatures. We're not likely going to see Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes and Dolphins QB Tua Tagovailoa spinning it frequently. Expect both teams to count on the run. Both of the Dolphins RBs, Raheem Mostert and De'Von Achane, are capable of housing it, while the Chiefs counter with RB Isiah Pacheco. With their physical styles, all 3 should be tough to tackle on a frigid afternoon. The combination of Mostert and Achane will wear down the defending champs, helping the warm-weather Dolphins keep it close and cover. Plus, the public drove this number up quite a bit, from an open of 1.5, and I never like siding with the public. Leg 2: Steelers at Bills UNDER 36.5 (-115) – Sunday, 1 p.m. ET (CBS) The weather is going to be absolutely atrocious. If you love a good snow game, then you are going to love the weather at Highmark Stadium Sunday. The forecast calls for temperatures around 20 degrees with a 60 percent or greater chance of snow throughout the game. If that wasn't enough, they're calling for winds whipping off of Lake Erie anywhere from 22-26 MPH with gusts to gale force. We're unlikely to see much in the way of passing as Steelers QB Mason Rudolph and Bills QB Josh Allen would do well to keep it on the ground. Allen and the Bills will have a leg up as he can tuck it and go. Buffalo RB James Cook is likely to see a strong workload, too. In addition to the passing games being hindered, the kicking game will be affected, too. Think back to Dec. 6, 2021, when the Bills hosted the New England Patriots on a Monday night, and we had snow and ice with heavy winds crushing the pass and kick games. In fact, field-goal attempts were downright comical. We're going to get one of those kind of games, and points are going to be at a premium. Leg 3: COWBOYS -7 (-110) vs. Packers – Sunday, 4:30 p.m. (FOX) The Packers (9-8) head into Jerry World , and it could be considered the Mike McCarthy revenge game. The Dallas coach will get a crack at his former employer, and while the personnel has mostly changed, the logo on the helmet remains the same. More importantly, though, the Packers barely made the playoffs, while the Cowboys (12-5) caught fire at the end of the season, blew past the Eagles and rolled to the NFC East title. The Cowboys scored 33 or more points in 6 of the final 9 games as QB Dak Prescott had the offense humming. The Packers won 3 games down the stretch, but all of those victories came against non-playoff teams. Wins are wins, and Green Bay qualified for the playoffs, but they're not likely going to be around very long. Green Bay was just 2-5 ATS in its final 7 road games, while Dallas went 6-2 ATS in 8 games this season at home. Parlay payout: Bet $10 to profit $58.14 (payout = $68.14).

Leg 4-*: BROWNS -2.5 (-105) at Texans – Saturday, 4:30 p.m. (NBC) *-If you want to add a 4th play to this parlay. The Browns and Texans kick off the Wild Card round in H-Town, and as mentioned, these teams are familiar with each other. Cleveland fired out to a 22-7 lead by halftime in their 1st meeting and led 36-7 with 12:31 to go, before settling for the 36-22 victory. Don't expect the same type of high-scoring game, but the winning result should be the same. The Browns finished with 418 total yards of offense in that 1st meeting with QB Joe Flacco throwing for 368 yards, and WR Amari Cooper setting a single-game franchise record with 265 receiving yards on 11 catches with 2 TDs. It's safe to say Cooper won't have anywhere near that production -- if he even plays at all. He has been sidelined with a heel injury. The matchup features Houston rookie QB C.J. Stroud against the former Super Bowl MVP Flacco. Experience will be a huge difference. Flacco has been the consummate professional since landing in Cleveland, and he and the starters are well-rested after basically a week off. Nearly all starters sat in Week 18 at Cincinnati with the team locked into the AFC's No. 5 seed. So the bumps and bruises are mended, and this Browns team is ready to roll.

    "text": "出品 | 搜狐财经\n　　出海业务订单暴增，新能源企业招聘需求也在相应激增。\n　　“最近海外业务很多，供不应求，招聘需求也多了起来。”瑞浦兰钧一位内部人士说道； “储能出海招聘挺火热的。”派能科技方面表示。\n　　类似的情形，也出现在其他企业。“一直就挺热的，我们的岗位一直都是在招状态，有售前技术、销售和PM等。”新能安方面也如此告诉搜狐财经。\n　　中关村储能产业技术联盟数据显示，2025年上半年，中国储能企业新增海外订单规模高达163GWh，同比增长246%，覆盖50余个国家和地区，涉及出海企业超50家。\n　　多家龙头企业在欧、澳、东南亚等多区域实现突破，如 阳光电源 （ 300274 ）2.4GWh欧洲储能大单、 宁德时代 （ 300750 ）2.2GWh东南亚最大光储项目、远景能源1.5GWh澳洲风光储一体化项目等。\n　　“远景能源近期在澳洲签了一个大订单，然后迅速投入人力资源。”猎头李寻说道。\n　　《中企出海外派员工薪酬指南》显示，新能源行业已成为中国企业出海招聘的主力军，2024年出海招聘职位73194个，同比增长35%，增速位居各行业前列。\n　　根据猎聘数据，2025年1-2月，新能源行业出海招聘量稳定在7700人以上，虽较2024年12月的峰值8107人略有回落，但仍高于2023年同期水平，出海人才需求依旧很强。\n　　“新能源行业涵盖光伏、储能、风电等细分领域，但目前的出海招聘，储能需求量最大，风电次之，光伏则处于紧缩状态。” 另一位猎头Floris指出。\n　　熟悉国际市场、具备行业经验的拓展型人才被抢夺，具备跨文化沟通能力的留学生变“香饽饽”，一场新能源人才的争夺战正在展开。但并不是所有人都能站在这个就业风口，外语门槛阻挡了国内绝大多数资深从业者。\n　　 出海招聘火热，储能人才缺口大\n　　“目前，很多人在国内卷不动，有意愿出海工作的不在少数。但完全适配比较难，企业招聘会强调拥有相关经验，熟练掌握一门外语；如要去非洲一些国家工作，还要会讲法语。”某新能源材料龙头出海员工刘耀告诉搜狐财经。\n　　在他的感知中，今年的用人需求没有去年旺盛，大部分企业因海外的情况，可能会一定程度的放缓项目，做一些风险上的管理。“但整体来看，出海招聘需求依旧很热。”\n　　北非的摩洛哥，目前已形成一个新能源产业集群；欧洲西班牙，也形成了一个中企出海的产业集群。“这些地方我们经常去，项目也都慢慢在落地，但节奏肯定不会那么快。” 刘耀说道。\n　　据Floris回忆，新能源出海招聘的火热，从2023年就已开始，当时有一波特别急的招聘，更倾向于技术侧，现在则主要是销售和解决方案岗位。 “未来等订单销售的差不多时，企业端会更倾向于招聘项目管理、项目履约、交付岗位” 。\n　　出海企业招聘员工分两类，一是从国内外派，二是招聘当地人。至于以哪种方式为主，Floris称需根据企业所处的出海阶段判断，头部企业对出海有明确规划，初期倾向于国内外派，后期逐渐转向本地化部署、招聘外籍人员。\n　　反观被迫出海的企业，则是从国内招聘去海外出差，或是以外派常驻的形式为主。“从当下需求来看，中小厂商的出海招聘需求也蛮大的，它们要试水、跟着大企业的方向走。”\n　　头部企业出海早，用人体系较为完善，如 比亚迪 （ 002594 ）、宁德时代，对出海人才的第一原则是本地化，“如我们给他们招的南美、智利及欧洲区域的人，除了负责人是从国内外派或招聘，其余大多是当地员工。” 李寻说道。\n　　从新能源细分领域来看，目前出海招聘最热的是储能行业，主要分为工商储、户储和大储。“国外储能市场还是一片蓝海，尤其是工商储与大储，现场运维和交付人才很稀缺，企业大多是从国内招聘”。\n　　“新能源企业出海招聘呈多领域并行态势，储能领域需求相对突出，欧洲是主要目标市场之一；氢能在中东地区显现岗位需求；新兴的碳管理领域，特别是ESG方向的人才招聘活跃度持续提升；光伏领域的人才需求保持稳定态势。”上海檀丹科技有限公司创始人赵丹告诉搜狐财经。\n　　“出海人才需求的主力大军，主要集中在商务类岗位（如BD、销售、市场）以及专注于市场进入策略（GTM：Go-to-Market）的职位。” 她曾在一家新能源上市公司担任英国区域负责人，具备多年海外经验，目前正在打造一个出海求职的一站式解决方案平台。\n　　“技术类岗位中，特定领域如欧洲市场的储能工程师需求也较为突出，寻找具备匹配技能和国际化经验的专业人才，已成为业内普遍面临的挑战。”赵丹说道。\n　　 留学生成“香饽饽”，国内应届生机会少\n　　在分析出海求职者群体时，赵丹称背景呈现多元化，包括具备优秀外语能力的应届毕业生、拥有海外学习背景的国际化人才、积累了行业经验的专业人士，以及寻求职业新路径的转型群体。\n　　“但无论是哪一类群体，扎实的语言沟通能力，尤其是商务英语或目标市场语言，通常是参与海外岗位的必备基础。”\n　　但企业在甄选海外人才时，普遍重视候选人的国际化视野、跨文化沟通协作能力以及有无相关垂直行业经验和目标客户资源。“对目标市场环境有认知、理解本地化运营逻辑的候选人，其适配性往往更高，能更有效地支持企业海外业务的落地。” 赵丹强调道。\n　　“出海人才缺口确实很大，但主要是缺乏有出海经验、行业经验或是了解当地市场的人。” 猎头Floris说道，她面试的应聘者当中，大部分是留学生。\n　　“更多是从当地找留学生，这是比较常见的。他们既懂中国文化，也适应当地生活。” 刘耀也如此说道。\n　　除此之外，已出国定居或是当地的华人，也颇受出海企业欢迎。在李寻看来，他们正站在难得一遇的就业风口上，“特别多的新能源公司，包括配套的基建公司、EPC公司，很多机会供他们来选择”。\n　　“他们现在每天都在接触猎头，选择各种各样的机会。”\n　　对于国内的应届生，从多位人士的反馈看，并不太匹配出海企业的需求。“以我正在服务的一家新能源头部企业为例，更倾向于从欧洲当地招聘应届大学生。” 李寻指出，绝大多数招聘还是以资深人士为主，招聘应届生主要是出于品牌提升需求。”\n　　赵丹也深有同感，对于应届毕业生参与海外业务，她认为企业的策略很务实，开放程度因岗而异。基础运营支持、语言服务类或特定技术辅助岗位，常向优秀应届生开放；而涉及市场开拓初期攻坚或核心业务团队搭建的关键岗位，则更依赖具备实战经验的人才。\n　　但从刘耀所在企业看，蓝领出海需求也很高，包括一线的装配工、钳工、司机等，但大部分在东南亚。“我们公司在印尼的司机有2000多人，大部分是从国内招聘，因为当地人工作效率较低，我们卷不动他们”。\n　　在他看来，蓝领出海到东南亚工作，当下是一个好选择，生活方面无太大开支，半年报销一次往返机票，吃住行基本全包。“但划定生产园区后，基本不能外出，因为有风险，有时候在岛上。”\n　　 工程师薪酬比国内至少高2倍，欧洲最受欢迎\n　　“愿意出海去工作的人，有一个共同特性——想赚钱，赚钱欲望比较强烈。” Floris指出。\n　　据刘耀透露，其所在企业的出海蓝领，月薪在1.5-2万元区间，相比国内高出1.5倍。如果工种是钳工、暖通工程师、水电工程师等偏技术性工人，工资会更高。\n　　白领或更高级别岗位更是如此，据KOS 2025中国内地薪酬指南，移动储能海外销售总监、户用储能海外销售总监、工商业储能海外业务开发负责人年薪为100-200万元；全球营销负责人年薪在150-200万元；国际业务负责人年薪在200-300万元。\n　　“外籍人士在华薪酬平均比国内员工高30%-50%，而中国工程师外派至发展中国家总薪酬约为国内3倍，发达国家约2倍。”赵丹说道。\n　　根据《中企出海外派员工薪酬指南》，新能源行业外派员工的平均薪酬，从2023年初的2.2万元，已增至2024年末的2.37万元。\n　　“整体而言，考虑到海外工作生活的综合成本、人才稀缺性以及国际化竞争等因素，企业为海外岗位提供的整体薪酬待遇通常具有市场竞争力，具体水平会因国家地区、生活成本、岗位性质和个人资历等因素而有差异。” 赵丹表示。\n　　据她观察，最受求职者关注的海外市场，欧洲凭借其成熟的市场环境、丰富的职业机会以及文化吸引力，持续吸引大量求职者关注。东南亚地区因其快速发展的市场潜力、相对临近的地理位置及多元包容的文化环境，也吸引了相当数量的出海人才。\n　　 招聘、求职两头难，猎头是主要渠道\n　　但无论是企业端还是求职端，目前均面临一个难题——相互匹配的问题，企业端认为出海人才难招，而求职者则是难以获悉企业的招聘岗位与渠道。\n　　“精准定位海外岗位的人才需求画像本身具有复杂性。”赵丹分析称，如一个负责新市场开拓的国家经理角色，往往需要融合市场战略、商务拓展、本地化运营、团队管理乃至初期团队搭建等多维度能力。\n　　“这要求招聘团队对海外目标市场的业务场景有深入理解，并能清晰定义岗位的核心职责与能力要求。”\n　　“不少企业的高层管理者会深度参与核心海外人才的寻访过程，但寻找同时满足这些要求的复合型人才是行业的普遍难点。”赵丹称，“这也是我们打造专注解决出海求职定位及岗位对接平台的意义所在。\"\n　　对此，李寻也深有感触，他直言高端出海人才的招聘，头部大厂之间竞争非常激烈。\n　　Floris偏向于高端职位招聘，年薪在40万左右，包括销售工程师、销售总监或营销负责人。据其透露，猎头招聘主要以搜寻为主。“如果等别人投简历，那黄花菜都凉了，我们这个赛道竞争也挺激烈，一般都是去寻找合适的候选人。”\n　　“单从猎聘这一渠道，每天能阅读的简历大概是170份；如果是领英，一般会发邮件，这个就多了。”\n　　企业招聘往往会通过多种方式寻找海外人才，包括利用专业猎头服务。同时，求职者也会通过各类平台寻找机会。“如何更高效、精准地连接双方的需求与供给，提升匹配的成功率，降低双方搜寻成本，是整个行业都在探索的课题。”赵丹总结道。\n　　（为保护隐私，李寻、刘耀为化名。）",

    "text": "Independence activist Tony Chung is pictured in a street in Hong Kong, China January 8, 2019. Picture taken January 8, 2019. REUTERS/James Pomfret/File Photo Reuters\nBy Kanishka Singh\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The former leader of a Hong Kong pro-independence group, who was sentenced under a national security law imposed by China, fled to Britain and will seek asylum over there, he told the Washington Post.\nWHY IT IS IMPORTANT\nIn November 2021, Tony Chung, who was then 20, was sentenced to 43 months in prison for trying to separate the city from China, and for money laundering. Chung was charged with secession under the sweeping national security law in 2020 and denied bail.\nBeijing imposed the national security law on the Asian financial hub in 2020 after months of anti-government protests. The law punishes acts including subversion, secession, collusion with foreign forces, and extremism with up to life in prison.\nKEY QUOTES\nThe trauma of detention and continued surveillance left Chung with a feeling of \"immense pressure and fear,\" compelling him to leave, he told the newspaper.\nChung also said he was made to take part in a compulsory \"deradicalization\" program in detention.\nGuards \"kept telling us (him and others in prison) that the United States government is really bad and that we had been manipulated by the United States,\" Chung was quoted as saying. \"We felt like we had to agree with them, that we couldn't disagree or argue back.\"\nChung was eventually released in June 2023 after his time was reduced for good behavior, according to the Washington Post. He plans to continue his studies and told the Post he will contribute everything he can in exile, \"just as before.\"\nCONTEXT\nChung is the former leader of Hong Kong pro-independence group Studentlocalism that dissolved in 2020 before the security law came into effect.\nProsecutors had said at the time he was charged that he acted as an administrator for the Facebook pages of the U.S. branch of Studentlocalism and an organization called the Initiative Independence Party. They also said pro-independence T-shirts, flags and books were seized from his home.\nThe former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the promise of a high degree of autonomy. Democracy activists and some Western governments say China broke that promise, an allegation that Beijing denies.\n(Reporting by Kanishka Singh in Washington; Editing by David Gregorio)\nCopyright 2023 Thomson Reuters .\nJoin the Conversation See Comments Tags: United States , Hong Kong , United Kingdom , Europe\nRead More",

    "text": "Les plus grands producteurs de sables bitumineux du Canada sont favorables au paiement d'une taxe sur le carbone, mais considèrent le projet de plafonnement des émissions de gaz et de pétrole comme une législation inutile, ont déclaré les PDG des entreprises aux législateurs à Ottawa jeudi.\nLes dirigeants de Suncor Energy, Imperial Oil, Cenovus Energy, Enbridge et Shell ont comparu par liaison vidéo devant une commission de la Chambre des communes pour répondre à des questions sur leurs efforts de réduction des émissions.\nLe secteur du pétrole et du gaz est l'industrie la plus polluante du Canada, représentant plus d'un quart de l'ensemble des émissions. En 2022, il a enregistré des bénéfices records lorsque les prix du pétrole ont grimpé pendant l'invasion de l'Ukraine par la Russie. Les défenseurs du climat estiment que les entreprises devraient investir une plus grande part de leurs bénéfices dans la décarbonisation.\nLe gouvernement libéral du Premier ministre Justin Trudeau prévoit d'introduire un plafond sur les émissions du secteur, mais se heurte à une forte opposition de la part de l'industrie, qui soutient que la législation n'est pas nécessaire car le Canada a déjà mis en place des incitations réglementaires, y compris un prix sur le carbone produit par l'industrie.\n\"Je suis en faveur d'un prix du carbone dans l'ensemble de l'économie, car je pense que cela favorisera l'innovation et les incitations économiques pour que nous continuions à améliorer nos activités\", a déclaré Rich Kruger, PDG de Suncor.\n\"Je crains fondamentalement qu'un plafonnement des émissions, tel qu'il est conçu, soit un plafonnement de la production\", a-t-il ajouté.\nLe Canada est le quatrième producteur mondial de pétrole.

    "title": "Karen McDougal's payment was known by Trump, David Pecker says",
    "text": "Former tabloid executive David Pecker testified Thursday that he believed former president Donald Trump knew of former Playboy model Karen McDougal and knew about the $150,000 payment she received for rights to her story. On day seven of Trump's trial for 34 counts of falsifying business records, Pecker, the former head of the National Enquirer parent company, took the witness stand again. Prosecutors had already peppered him with questions Tuesday to set the stage about how his company American Media Inc. sought to help Trump's campaign by stopping negative stories about him. McDougal had a story about a 2006 affair to share, though Trump denies it happened. Here is what Pecker testified about Trump and McDougal's relationship. Trump trial live updates: David Pecker testifies about contract with Karen McDougal 'Karen is a nice girl,' Trump said, according to Pecker In June 2016, McDougal's lawyer contacted the National Enquirer offering her story about the alleged affair with Trump, according to a Federal Election Commission agreement with the company. Pecker and another executive within American Media Inc. notified Cohen about the story, the FEC agreement states. During his testimony Thursday, Pecker described a phone call he had with Trump about McDougal's story. \"I spoke to Michael. Karen is a nice girl,\" Trump said during the call, Pecker said on the witness stand. Pecker said that comment made him believe Trump knew who McDougal was. Trump asked what Pecker thought he should do, according to Pecker. Pecker recommended Trump buy McDougal's story and take it off the market. Pecker testified he thought Trump knew about $150,000 paid for McDougal's story Asked by prosecutor Joshua Steinglass why Pecker thought Trump should buy the story, Pecker testified he believed her story was true, and he thought it would have been very embarrassing for Trump personally as well as for Trump's campaign. Pecker went on to recount a discussion with Michael Cohen about who would ultimately pay the $150,000 hush money to Karen McDougal to keep her story of an affair with Trump quiet ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Cohen allegedly told Pecker not to worry, \"the boss will take care of it.\" Pecker testified he understood that to mean he would be reimbursed either by the Trump Organization or Donald Trump. Pecker described the agreement with McDougal, which included the $150,000 and a monthly column in two different magazines. Pecker also said Michael Cohen knew about the hush money agreement to keep McDougal quiet, and he believed Donald Trump also knew. Who is Karen McDougal? Karen McDougal is a former Playboy model. Former Trump lawyer and convicted felon Michael Cohen negotiated the payment she received as part of a \"catch and kill\" strategy to block negative stories about Trump while he ran for president. McDougal has since spoken out about her affair with Trump , saying it lasted for 10 months starting in 2006. He denies the allegation. She is expected to take the stand, though the prosecutors have kept the official witness list close to their chest. Who is David Pecker? David Pecker , former CEO and president of American Media Inc., is the first witness on the stand at Trump's Manhattan criminal trial . AMI entered a non-prosecution agreement with the Justice Department, acknowledging the payment was “substantially more than AMI otherwise would have paid for the story,” because they were to be repaid by Cohen. The company was also fined $187,500 by the FEC for helping Trump's election, but the Justice Department granted Pecker immunity from prosecution. Contributing: Bart Jansen",
