Tommy Tuberville (R-Auburn) blasted President Joe Biden Thursday for being an “EMBARRASSMENT” for America at the WWII memorial ceremony in France.\nThe senator was a part of a bipartisan Congressional delegation traveling to Normandy to mark the 80th anniversary of the D-Day allied invasion in the war.\nTuberville posted a picture of the president on X and said he looked “practically ASLEEP.”\n“I took this photo of [Joe Biden] practically ASLEEP during a ceremony honoring our WWII heroes,” Tuberville said. “Joe Biden continues to be an EMBARRASSMENT to our country.”\nI took this photo of @JoeBiden practically ASLEEP during a ceremony honoring our WWII heroes.\nJoe Biden continues to be an EMBARRASSMENT to our country.\nHe turned a speech honoring HEROES into a Ukraine pep rally, bragging about body counts. pic.twitter.com/uv3hWpYlfw\n— Coach Tommy Tuberville (@SenTuberville) June 6, 2024\nThere has been a lot of speculation of Biden’s mental and physical decline, including a piece in The Wall Street Journal detailing the president’s “slipping” behind closed doors.\nTuberville also criticized part of Biden’s speech during the ceremony where he talked about how many Russian soldiers have been killed in Ukraine.\n“He turned a speech honoring HEROES into a Ukraine pep rally,” Tuberville said, “bragging about body counts.”\nBiden uses his D-Day address in Normandy to talk about how many Russians have been killed in Ukraine pic.twitter.com/6u4m0SNAIv\n— RNC Research (@RNCResearch) June 6, 2024\nBefore the trip, Tuberville said he was “honored” to be joining his colleagues in Normandy to mark the occasion.\n“I am honored to join my colleagues in honoring the brave soldiers who lost their lives on the beaches of Normandy 80 years ago,” he said. “It has always been a bucket list item for me to see the beaches where young adults, like my father, heroically fought for our freedom. May we never forget their sacrifices and honor them by making sure our children know the truth about the freedoms that make America so great.”\nTuberville’s father, Charles Tuberville, participated in the battle as a member of the U.S. Army. The senior Tuberville landed and fought on Utah beach on June 6, 1944 as the driver of a tank.\nYaffee is a contributing writer to Yellowhammer News and hosts “The Yaffee Program” weekdays 9-11 a.m. on WVNN .

    "text": "Toronto FC played out a goalless draw against the Vancouver Whitecaps before falling to a 4-2 penalty shootout loss in the 2024 TELUS Canadian Championship Final at BC Place on Wednesday night. First Half: TFC Head Coach John Herdman rotated his side for the cup final, making nine changes from the starting eleven that featured on the road against Colorado Rapids on Saturday evening with Sigurd Rosted, Aimé Mabika, Kobe Franklin, Brandon Servania, Deybi Flores, Kosi Thompson, Tyrese Spicer, Derrick Etienne Jr. and Prince Owusu making way for Kevin Long, Raoul Petretta; Federico Bernardeschi, Jonathan Osorio, Alonso Coello, Matty Longstaff, Richie Laryea; Deandre Kerr and Lorenzo Insigne. The Reds began early proceedings on the front foot, testing Vancouver’s backline with four goalscoring attempts from Federico Bernardeschi, Shane O’Neill, Jonathan Osorio and Richie Laryea within the opening 20 minutes in British Columbia. After settling into the contest, Vancouver Whitecaps created opportunities of their own and Toronto’s Sean Johnson was on hand to make an important save to deny Fafa Picault’s powerful 35th minute effort. Moments later, TFC were awarded a penalty kick down the other end when Richie Laryea was hauled down by Vancouver’s Mathías Laborda, leaving referee Marie-Soleil Beaudoin with no option except to the penalty spot in the 37th minute. Federico Bernardeschi stepped up for the visitors and saw his effort saved by the goalkeeper Isaac Boehmer, who dove to his right to deny the Italian and keep the scores level at zero going into the half-time interval at BC Place. Second Half: Much like the first half, Toronto FC fashioned early opportunities to score the evening’s opening goal upon returning from the break. Richie Laryea first saw a long-range effort narrowly miss the target before Lorenzo Insigne volleyed Deandre Kerr’s low cross into the box a few inches wide of the mark within the first three minutes of the restart. Seeking the all-important breakthrough, both TFC and the Whitecaps exchanged opportunities to take the lead with both shot-stoppers called into action in the closing stages. In the 83rd minute, Toronto’s Sean Johnson made a routine save from Alessandro Schöpf’s long-range effort before Isaac Boehmer denied Federico Bernardeschi a late game-winner twice with a pair of crucial saves in the space of five minutes down the other end. With the two rivals unable to break the deadlock in regular time, the Canadian Championship was set to be decided by a penalty shootout for the fourth time in tournament history. Canadian goalkeeper Isaac Boehmer saved two penalties for Vancouver and helped the Whitecaps win the penalty shootout by a score of 4-2 and lift the 2024 TELUS Canadian Championship and earn a spot into the 2025 Concacaf Champions Cup. The Reds wrap up their three-game road stretch with a return to MLS action against the Chicago Fire on Saturday evening. Kick-off from SeatGeek Stadium in Bridgeview, Illinois is set for 8:30 p.m. ET and will be broadcast globally on MLS Season Pass on Apple TV. LINEUPS VANCOUVER WHITECAPS FC – Isaac Boehmer; Bjørn Inge Utvik, Mathías Laborda, Ranko Veselinović; Ali Ahmed (Ryan Raposo 46’), Andrés Cubas, Pedro Vite (Stuart Armstrong 85’), Sam Adekugbe (Sebastian Berhalter 72’), Ryan Gauld (C); Brian White, Fafà Picault (Alessandro Schöpf 60’) Substitutes Not Used: Yohei Takaoka, Tristan Blackmon, Levonte Johnson TORONTO FC – Sean Johnson; Shane O’Neill (Sigurd Rosted 72’), Kevin Long, Raoul Petretta; Federico Bernardeschi, Jonathan Osorio (C), Alonso Coello (Deybi Flores 84’), Matty Longstaff, Richie Laryea; Deandre Kerr (Prince Owusu 68’), Lorenzo Insigne (Kosi Thompson 68’) Substitutes Not Used: Luka Gavran, Aimé Mabika, Kobe Franklin MEDIA NOTES - Toronto FC midfielder and captain Jonathan Osorio made his 32nd Canadian Championship appearance tonight, tying Russell Teibert (formerly of Vancouver Whitecaps FC) with the most appearances in tournament history. - Deandre Kerr earned the 2024 TELUS Canadian Championship Golden Boot award after scoring a tournament-high five goals. - Sean Johnson and Alonso Coello each made their 50th appearance for Toronto FC across all competitions, becoming the eleventh and twelfth current TFC players (Jonathan Osorio, Richie Laryea, Deandre Kerr, Federico Bernardeschi, Shane O’Neill, Kosi Thompson, Kobe Franklin, Lorenzo Insigne, Raoul Petretta and Sigurd Rosted) to reach the milestone. - Sean Johnson also recorded his ninth clean sheet of the 2024 season across all competitions (MLS regular season, Leagues Cup and Canadian Championship) and the fifteenth clean sheet of his career with Toronto FC.",

    "title": "Watch: Charlotte Church gives impassioned interview during march for ceasefire in Gaza",
    "text": "[News](https://nation.cymru/category/news/) Watch: Charlotte Church gives impassioned interview during march for ceasefire in Gaza Charlotte Church has given an impassioned interview during a “peaceful and loving” march for peace, and discussed why she feels more public figures aren’t speaking out about what she calls the “biggest spiritual quest of our time”. On Saturday, the Welsh singer and activist marched alongside thousands of protesters in central London calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. Speaking to Novara Media, she said: “I am here today to show my solidarity with the people of Palestine and with all of the people of the UK who are very bravely upholding our democratic right to be able to come out on to the streets and show our displeasure in a very peaceful and loving and strong way.” When asked why more public figures aren’t speaking out, she said: “I’m not sure why more public figures aren’t coming out and speaking about Palestine. “I feel like clearly there is risk in it – the risk of being labelled an anti-Semite almost immediately which is what happened to me.” “Personally, I think that this is the biggest spiritual quest of our time. And I can do nothing but be a part of this movement, and be a part of this fight.” Ceasefire Earlier in the day, Charlotte told the PA news agency: “I am here today to call for an immediate ceasefire, to ask our Government and governments all over the world to send as strong a message as we possibly can. “But a strong, a peaceful, a loving message, that’s what every single march that I’ve been on for Palestine has been about. “There’s been singing, there’s been drumming, yes, there’s been emotion, but in the majority that emotion has been love, has been compassion because that’s why we’re all here. “We’re all here because we cannot bear what we’re witnessing. “We cannot bear to see civilians, children, women slaughtered. “And so we are here because our hearts are so full of love for the Palestinian people.” Church added: “We’re also showing that we are absolutely not going to tolerate our Government being a part of propping up an apartheid regime. “We as citizens of the UK will not tolerate our Government being complicit in this.” The Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC) organised the protest, following the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on October 7 in which about 1,200 people were killed and more than 240 kidnapped before Israel retaliated with months of attacks on the Gaza Strip, killing and wounding thousands. At the march demonstrators waved Palestine flags and carried banners which read “Stop the war on Gaza” and “Ceasefire now” as they walked from Hyde Park Corner to the US embassy. It comes as the Government’s counter-extremism tsar warned that London’s streets have become a “no-go zone for Jews” during pro-Palestine protests. Bedwas Following Church’s involvement at a fundraising event at Bedwas Workmen’s Hall on February 24, she told Novara Live that it was “misguided” to draw an inference of antisemitism from the pro-Palestinian chants. “To be honest, I hate the idea that anyone thinks that I am at all antisemitic or trying to make things more divisive, but I stand by everything we sang,” she said. “It was a deeply spiritual experience for me and I would do it again 100 times – and plan to.” Church added at the time: “It is a really powerful chant that every single activist that I have met, every march that I have been on, in every context that I have ever heard it sang, it always has been for the human rights and for the equal liberty of Palestinian people, as well as Israeli people, on the lands of Palestine and Israel, and that is what I have always taken it and understood it to mean and that’s what I think it does mean. “And for anyone who is taking from that genocidal intent towards Israel, or about there not being a state of Israel, I think is misguided – that is not what the chant means.” The Campaign Against Antisemitism accused Church of encouraging hatred and called for the Charity Commission to investigate the incident. However, the Jewish choir conductor who co-organised the fundraising concert, which attracted a sell out audience of 400, rejected the allegations. Wendy Lewis, who has conducted Côr Cochion Caerdydd (Cardiff Red Choir) since 1987, said that was “absolute nonsense”. She said: “It was the most positive life-enhancing event I’ve ever taken part in. The range of people who attended was very broad and included Muslims, Christians, Jews and others who came together to celebrate the ideas of peace and goodwill. “Our hearts are heavy because of the slaughter of more than 29,500 people in Gaza by the Israeli Defence Forces since the invasion last October.” She added: “There was a huge amount of energy flowing in the hall, and we had 30, then 50, then 100 people on the stage at once. “As a Jew myself who has had family members killed in pogroms, I know very well what antisemitism is, and it wasn’t present at all in the workmen’s hall.” Support our Nation today For the price of a cup of coffee a month you can help us create an independent, not-for-profit, national news service for the people of Wales, by the people of Wales.",
