    "text": "> VATICAN CITY, March 10 — Pope Francis has urged parties in the Ukraine war to “have the courage to negotiate”, and do so “before things get worse”, in an interview broadcast yesterday by Swiss television.\nThe 87-year-old pontiff was asked by the public broadcaster RTS about a debate within Ukraine on whether to surrender to Russia’s invasion.\n“I believe that the strongest are those who see the situation, think about the people, and have the courage to raise the white flag and negotiate,” he said in the interview, which the Vatican said was conducted in early February.\nHe added: “That word negotiate is a brave word. When you see that you are defeated, that things are not working out, to have the courage to negotiate.”\nAdvertisement He said people might feel ashamed but asked how many lives were being lost.\n“Today, for example with the war in Ukraine, there are many who want to act as mediators. Turkey for example,” he said.\n“Don’t be ashamed to negotiate before things get worse.”\nAdvertisement Speaking about conflict in general, including the Hamas-Israel war, he added: “Negotiations are never a surrender. It is the courage not to carry a country to suicide.”\nThe Vatican’s director of communications, Matteo Bruni, later issued a statement seeking to clarify the pope’s words.\nFrancis had used the term white flag “to indicate a cessation of hostilities, a truce reached with the courage of negotiation”, Bruni said in a statement published by Vatican News.\nHe repeated the pontiff’s call for a “diplomatic solution in search of a justing and lasting peace” in what Francis calls the “martyred” Ukraine.\nFrancis was also asked in the interview about the Israel-Hamas war, where he laid blame on both sides.\n“War is made by two, not one. The irresponsible ones are these two who wage war,” he told the broadcaster. — AFP",

    "title": "Extreme heat far outpaced cold in U.S. during record-warm 2023 - The Washington Post",
    "text": "The year 2023 — which is set to become the Earth’s hottest on record — featured a disproportionate amount of extremely warm weather in the United States. The disproportionate number of warm weather records in 2023 fits into a long-term increase driven by human-caused climate change. The strong El Niño event that developed this year also contributed to the warm weather extremes. In the United States, there have been 41,703 calendar day temperature records and, of those, 31,230 were on the warm side compared to just 10,043 on the cool end (through Dec. 28). August alone had 5,701 warm records. And during this abnormally mild December, there have been only 53 cold weather records compared to a whopping 2,826 warm ones. Warm weather records were also especially numerous during the hot summer months. Between July and September, warm weather records outnumbered cool ones by a factor of six. How the year evolved The year 2023 got off to a hot start with 165 warm weather records on Jan. 3 from the central states to the East Coast. Jan. 3 became the first of 35 days in 2023 with 100 or more high temperature records; by comparison, there were just five days with 100 or more record low temperatures. Spikes of abnormally warm temperatures continued in the late winter and spring. There were nearly 500 record highs set Feb. 22 and 23, while April 13 had just shy of 250. June was the only month to feature more cool records than warm ones. But the peak summer months of July and August produced a torrent of heat records focused across the southern tier, expanding from the Desert Southwest to the Gulf Coast states. The results by season If the climate wasn’t changing, warm and cold records would tend to balance each other out over time. But since the 1970s, the balance has tilted heavily toward warm records, and 2023 fits into this trend, as shown in the month-by-month breakdown below: January was one of the year’s most extreme months, with record highs outnumbering record lows by a factor of 6.5. Heat records outpaced cold ones during the spring, but by a factor of less than 2. Then, summer heat sprang to life. From July to September, there were 11,557 warm records compared to just 1,834 cool ones. During October, there were more than three times as many warm records as cool ones, but that ratio dropped to about 1.5 in November. The fall lull in extensive record heat was somewhat similar to what was observed in spring. December has proven to be exceptionally warm, with about 53 warm records for every cold one. It’s poised to become the warmest December on record across a large swath of the northern tier, including in Fargo, N.D., Minneapolis and Milwaukee. Some of the most memorable numbers Although there were bouts of record-setting warmth throughout the year, the intensity of the heat was most extreme in July and August. Following its coolest June since 2009, temperatures rose to unprecedented levels in Phoenix. With an average temperature of 102.7 degrees during July, the highest on record by nearly 4 degrees, Phoenix became the first major city in the United States to average 100 degrees or higher for a month. It also posted its second-hottest August and hottest summer overall, which included a record-setting 31-day stretch reaching at least 110 degrees. During July and August, the core of the heat shifted east. El Paso sweltered through 70 days reaching at least 100 degrees, surpassing the old record of 62 days in 1994. On Aug. 27, with a temperature of 105 degrees, New Orleans joined many others along the Gulf Coast in setting all-time record highs, including Baton Rouge (106 degrees), Houston (109), Mobile, Ala. (106) and Shreveport, La. (110). The heat across the southern states helped push the Gulf of Mexico to record highs, while the water temperature surged to 101.1 degrees at a buoy just off the Florida coast.",

    "title": "\\\"Un terzo dei dipendenti è sotto stress e oberato di lavoro\\\"",
    "text": "In Svizzera la percentuale di dipendenti costantemente sull'orlo dell'esaurimento è ai massimi storici: si parla di uno su tre. È quanto emerge dal \"Barometro delle condizioni di lavoro\", un'indagine condotta annualmente dal sindacato Travail.Suisse in collaborazione con la Scuola universitaria professionale di Berna (BFH) i cui risultati sono stati presentati oggi alla stampa. L'associazione di categoria ha lanciato l'allarme: la percentuale di dipendenti altamente stressati è in costante aumento e l'esaurimento si sta diffondendo, il che significa che lo stress è diventato il problema più grande nel mondo del lavoro negli ultimi anni.\nL'84% dei dipendenti è troppo stanco per questioni private\nLa stragrande maggioranza dei dipendenti, l'84,2%, risulta essere occasionalmente troppo stanca dopo il lavoro per occuparsi di questioni private o familiari; per più di uno su tre ciò accade spesso o molto spesso, condizione quantificata da Travail.Suisse come equivalente a un esaurimento permanente. Per questo motivo, \"la lotta allo stress deve diventare una priorità politica assoluta\", ha enfatizzato la vicepresidente del sindacato e consigliera nazionale Léonore Porchet (Verdi/VD). Travail.Suisse ha attirato l'attenzione anche sulla situazione dei dipendenti con problemi di salute: secondo il barometro, una persona su tre è affetta da disturbi e circa la metà si sente limitata nel lavoro. Colpisce il fatto che, anche tra i dipendenti che lamentano gravi disturbi, più di due terzi non hanno avuto un adattamento dei propri compiti o del luogo di lavoro, sottolinea il sindacato. Di conseguenza, queste persone valutano la qualità delle condizioni di lavoro in modo costantemente peggiore rispetto ai loro colleghi sani.\nPiù sostegno alla formazione continua\nPer contro - è stato sottolineato davanti alla stampa - si registrano sviluppi positivi nell'ambito della formazione continua, con un maggiore impegno da parte dei datori di lavoro nel promuovere la formazione continua, anche se con grandi differenze a seconda delle dimensioni dell'azienda e del livello di occupazione dei dipendenti. Secondo Travail.Suisse, tuttavia, la percentuale di copertura dei costi da parte dei datori di lavoro non è cambiata: quasi la metà dei dipendenti non riceve alcun sostegno finanziario, o lo riceve solo in parte, per i propri sforzi formativi. \"È necessaria un'ulteriore campagna in favore della di formazione e il sostegno ai costi diretti e indiretti deve essere ampliato\", ha detto Adrian Wüthrich, presidente di Travail.Suisse. Il sondaggio, ha indicato il sindacato, è stato effettuato diversi mesi fa. Per realizzarlo sono stati sollecitati circa 1400 impiegati rappresentativi del mercato del lavoro elvetico e provenienti da tutte le regioni.",

    "text": "In the decade-plus history of the cryptocurrency industry, this year has been particularly challenging. Factors like wars and interest rate hikes put global capital markets under pressure, and the crypto industry faced its Lehman moment, along with frequent hacker attacks. Amidst this downturn, we still witnessed the smooth progress of Ethereum's merger and the return of the Layer2 wave, demonstrating the vitality and anti-fragility of the crypto industry. Persistence often leads to hope. In 2022, alongside the crypto industry, BISSNEX maintained a healthy respect for risk without losing control. This approach led to our contrarian growth this year, completing several funding rounds, and establishing an independent ecological fund and educational academy to help propel the industry forward - all valuable achievements in overcoming challenges. In April, BISSNEX successfully completed its second round of funding, garnering interest from renowned investment institutions Paradigm and NGC Ventures. This support solidified our position and foresight in the crypto industry. With more stable financial backing, BISSNEX laid a solid foundation for future innovations and expansions, significantly aiding our product development plans. June saw the establishment of the independent ecological fund, BISSNEX Labs, a milestone development. The lab operates globally, focusing on asset management product issuance, media collaboration, and crypto-economic research. It rigorously evaluates potential investment projects from multiple dimensions and focuses on linking the crypto industry supply chain, helping high-value projects in various fields gain support and contribute back to the industry's growth. Following some regrettable black swan events in the crypto industry, we aimed to make a meaningful impact, particularly for less experienced investors. In September, we began building BISSNEX College, an important initiative to help users better enter the crypto industry. On this specially designed educational platform, we offer a wealth of course resources, including basics of cryptocurrencies, trading skills, and investment strategies. BISSNEX College, as a robust learning platform, helps many users learn to cope with the crises and challenges of the crypto market. We believe that only through in-depth learning and understanding can investors succeed in a competitive and rapidly changing market. During dark times, light becomes more noticeable. Amid the turbulent crypto market, BISSNEX withstood external pressures and tests, receiving more offers of collaboration. In December, we welcomed a new wave of investment from Multicoin Capital and Pantera Capital. During the bear market, this achievement brought us exhilarating strength. The collaboration with these two VCs provides more financial and strategic support for BISSNEX. We will fully utilize this opportunity to invest more time and effort in product development, technology upgrades, and global market expansion. We particularly focus on upgrading our overall security system and more comprehensive risk monitoring to better serve our users. Time doesn't speak but gives answers, and navigating through cycles is BISSNEX's answer this year. A good crypto trading platform requires a holistic view of technology, team, product, service, and risk resistance. From this perspective, BISSNEX is already one of the leading exchanges in the crypto industry. We remain clear-headed amidst the fog, cautious and focused in a rapidly evolving field, striving to make BISSNEX a beacon of light illuminating the entire crypto industry.

    "title": "State officials question RiverLink as tolls set to increase | News | newsandtribune.com",
    "text": "SOUTHERN INDIANA — Riverlink has announced new rates on the three toll bridges connecting Louisville and Southern Indiana, as slight increases will begin on July 1. Toll rates are updated every year, and they are determined by a bi-state resolution established in 2013. The toll bridges are the Interstate 65 Abraham Lincoln Bridge, I-65 Kennedy Bridge and Ind. 265/Ky. 841 Lewis and Clark Bridge. Increases made to the tolls are to ensure the operations and maintenance of the bridges, RiverLink stated in a news release. Toll increases have caused many discussions about how it will affect those who drive on the toll bridges daily and the companies who rely on them for transporting their products. “We have a minimum of 80 crossings a day,” said Jim Bohannan, the senior vice president at Mister “P” Express. “We’re certainly not happy (about the increase), but there’s not a lot you can do about it.” Mister “P” Express is a trucking company based in Jeffersonville. Bohannan added that it can be a challenge to get in touch with people at RiverLink. “You don’t pick up the phone and call RiverLink. It’s not that easy,” he said. One concern about Riverlink that District 72 state Rep. Ed Clere has is that in 2021, only 88% of the tolls that were charged were collected. “What has been more troubling to me is that doesn’t include the amount that was never billed,” Clere said. “In 2021 there was more than $18 million that was never invoiced.” The reason why that amount of money was never invoiced is mostly because of technical problems and lack of information, Clere added. “It’s not fair to people who are paying their tolls,” Clere said. “Way too many users are getting away without paying their toll… the situation with the vendor is simply unacceptable.” “When we have a process that is not consistent and it is not user friendly, it can undermine all of the economic development benefits because it’s not being managed the way that it’s supposed to be,” said Wendy Dant Chesser, the District 71 state representative and the chief director of corporate strategy and external affairs at River Ridge. From the perspective of River Ridge, the industrial field has been intentional about hiring the right people and talent they need, Chesser added. If they have employees that are affected by these concerns with the sloppy procedure, that’s going to have a negative effect on River Ridge, she said. The increases and operational concerns deserve a conversation with the people who oversee the contract and any legislator who is interested in fixing it, Chesser said.",

    "text": "Trágica muerte para un medallista olímpico\nEl histórico esquiador noruego perdió la vida tras ser alcanzado por un rayo.\nUn rayo terminó de manera trágica con la vida de Audun Grønvold, histórico esquiador noruego y medallista olímpico, a los 49 años. La noticia, confirmada por la Federación Noruega de Esquí, causó conmoción en el deporte mundial y dejó un profundo pesar entre quienes forman parte del esquí. Grønvold, que se subió al podio en los Juegos Olímpicos de Vancouver 2010, perdió la vida tras ser alcanzado por un rayo durante una salida familiar a una cabaña, un hecho tan inusual como devastador que generó múltiples homenajes en Noruega y el exterior.\nEl trágico episodio ocurrió el sábado previo al martes 15 de julio, cuando Grønvold disfrutaba de unas vacaciones de verano junto a su familia. Mientras se encontraban al aire libre cerca de la cabaña, un rayo impactó sobre él. Según detalló la Federación Noruega de Esquí, el exdeportista recibió asistencia médica de inmediato y fue trasladado de urgencia al hospital, donde permaneció internado por la gravedad de sus lesiones. A pesar de los esfuerzos del personal médico, Grønvold murió entre la noche del martes y la madrugada del miércoles debido a las heridas causadas por la descarga eléctrica.\nLa familia del exesquiador comunicó la triste noticia, que luego fue confirmada por la federación. El hecho de que un atleta de alto rendimiento, habituado a los riesgos de la velocidad y la montaña, perdiera la vida en un accidente tan imprevisible como la caída de un rayo generó un fuerte impacto en la opinión pública y en la comunidad del deporte.",
