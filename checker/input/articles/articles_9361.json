Se trata de la procesión más solemne que se lleva a cabo en la ciudad y en la que participan distintas entidades festeras. El Santísimo Sacramento del Señor ha reunido a cientos de alicantinos. Primero, ha tenido lugar la solemne misa oficiada en la [Concatedral de San Nicolás](https://www.informacion.es/tags/concatedral-de-san-nicolas/) y, después sobre las 20 horas ha comenzado la procesión, que ha recorrido algunas de las calles del casco antiguo de Alicante. En el recorrido han estado presentes las principales fiestas de la ciudad, con las [Hogueras de Alicante](https://www.informacion.es/hogueras/) al frente. Las [Belleas](https://www.informacion.es/fotos/alicante/2023/01/13/belleas-foc-hogueras-sant-joan-4831886.html) del Foc, [Alba Muñoz](https://www.informacion.es/tags/alba-munoz/) y [Martina Lloret](https://www.informacion.es/tags/martina-lloret/), y sus damas de honor han estado acompañadas por representantes de los [Moros y Cristianos](https://www.informacion.es/tags/moros-y-cristianos/), las Hermandades y Cofradías de la [Semana Santa](https://www.informacion.es/semana-santa/), las Fiestas de la Federación De Asociaciones Festivas de Barrios y Partidas de Alicante (FAFBA) y otras celebraciones tradicionales. Altares El Corpus Christi ha recorrido las calles del centro histórico, donde se han colocado siete altares en los que se ha realizado una breve parada. Los vecinos, desde sus balcones, han recibido a la figura divina con pétalos de flores y miradas de emoción. El incienso ha ido contagiando de su olor las calles, que se han llenado de fieles que no han querido perderse la figura divina. No han faltado, como cada año, los pequeños que este año han tomado la primera comunión ni tampoco autoridades políticas, civiles y militares. El alcalde, [Luis Barcala](https://www.informacion.es/tags/luis-barcala/), el vicealcalde, [Manuel Villar](https://www.informacion.es/tags/manuel-villar/), la concejala de Fiestas, [Cristina Cutanda](https://www.informacion.es/tags/cristina-cutanda/), además de otros miembros de la corporación y autoridades políticas y militares también realizaron el recorrido, que finalizó donde había empezado, en la Concatedral de San Nicolás.

    "text": "Jonny Johnston, 45, went to bed before realising the next day he had won\nA supermarket delivery driver got an early Christmas present – after scooping £3.8million on the lottery.\nJonny Johnston, 45, had just finished his rounds for Tesco when he spotted an email announcing ‘good news about your ticket’.\nAssuming he had won a lucky dip, the father of three went to bed and it was only when he checked his phone the next day that he realised he had become a millionaire overnight.\nBut the down-to-earth supermarket worker kept his news a secret for a week, even completing a click and collect shift at his local store, handing out bags of turkey and trimmings to customers in County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland, on Saturday, before news of his win spread.\nMr Johnston, who has never been abroad in his life, now plans to take his partner of 25 years, Christina, and their three children, aged 19, 20 and 23, on holiday together for the first time.\nJonny Johnston and his partner Christina Williams celebrate at the Culloden Estate & Spa Hotel in Belfast after winning £3.8million on the Lotto draw\nThe father went to bed and it was only when he checked his phone the next day that he realised he had become a millionaire overnight\nThe supermarket worker then kept his amazing news a secret for a week\nHe said: ‘I’m still in disbelief. This is a dream come true for me and my family. I’ve always worked hard, and this win will allow us to do things we could only ever have dreamt of before. I would love for us all to go to the Caribbean, maybe on a cruise as it sounds and looks incredible. We have never had a family holiday together. I just need to apply for my passport first.’\nMr Johnson has played the lottery with the same numbers for more than 20 years. Three weeks ago, however, he matched two numbers and won an additional Lucky Dip for the Lotto draw on Saturday December 16. It was the free Lucky Dip line, with numbers 4, 12, 23, 30, 50 and 56, which proved to be the winner.\nReferring to the moment he realised he had won, Mr Johnston said: ‘I was sitting on the edge of the bed on Sunday morning trying to make sense of what I was seeing. I just kept staring at the numbers on my account. I thought maybe I had won £38,000 but then there were too many zeros. I passed the phone to Christina for her to check and she was in disbelief too. We both began to think that it was a trick, a scam even. We decided we had better call Camelot and double-check.’\nMr Johnson has played the lottery with the same numbers for more than 20 years\nReferring to the moment he realised he had won, Mr Johnston said: ‘I was sitting on the edge of the bed on Sunday morning trying to make sense of what I was seeing’\nMr Johnston said both him and Christina were in disbelief when they first found out the news\nOnly when the National Lottery confirmed the win did the couple break the news to their children.\n‘The kids were silent at first, looking at both of us in disbelief,’ Mr Johnston added. ‘Then the screaming and shouting started, everyone was jumping around the kitchen, cheering. Seeing as it was still early, we popped the kettle on and toasted the amazing news with a cup of coffee.’\nMr Johnston said he also had his eye on a vintage car and may also buy a new tractor for one of his sons, who works on a farm.\n‘I am incredibly grateful and still trying to wrap my head around it all,’ he said.",

    "text": "Florida priest accused of biting woman who was trying to take Communion A Florida priest is accused of biting a woman during a dispute at Sunday Mass and could be charged with battery. The woman attended a 10 a.m. service at St. Thomas Aquinas Church in St. Cloud on Sunday and tried to take Communion, the Diocese of Orlando said. She had a brief discussion with the Rev. Fidel Rodriguez, who told her she hadn't taken the proper steps to secure Communion and sent her away with a blessing, the diocese said in a statement. The woman returned for a service two hours later and again tried to take Communion, and when Rodriguez asked her whether she had performed the prerequisite of Confession required by the Catholic Church to receive the Eucharist, she told him “it was not his business,” according to the diocese. Rodriguez, who didn't have any information or details about the woman's background, offered her Holy Communion, the church said. \"At that point, the woman forcefully placed her hand in the vessel and grabbed some sacred Communion hosts, crushing them,\" the diocese said. Rodriguez, who had only one free hand, struggled with the woman \"as she refused to let go of the hosts.\" The church said the woman then pushed Rodriguez, who \"bit her hand so she would let go of the hosts she grabbed.\" She was immediately asked to leave. Police investigated the incident at the church in St. Cloud, which is about 30 miles south of Orlando, and a charging affidavit accused Rodriguez of battery. The woman told police that Rodriguez tried to \"ram\" the wafer into her mouth after he became upset with her for not having completed the necessary steps to take Communion, according to a police report. She accused him of grabbing and biting her arm as she tried to take a wafer he was holding, the report said. Rodriguez told police that she attacked him first and that he was trying to protect the sanctity of Communion, according to the police report. He told police that the woman pushed him and wouldn't let go of the tray and that \"the only way he thought to extract her from it was to bite her arm,\" the police report said. Police said witnesses provided video of the incident. The Diocese of Orlando said Rodriguez responded in a way that was aimed \"to protect the Holy Communion from this sacrilegious act.\" \"While the Diocese of Orlando does not condone physical altercations such as this, in good faith, Father Rodriguez was simply attempting to prevent an act of desecration of the Holy Communion,\" it said. The Eucharist, the church said, \"is considered 'the source and summit' of worship and faith.\" \"It is not something a person can arbitrarily demand and is certainly not a mere 'cookie' as the complainant called it,\" the diocese said.",

    "title": "Israel ready to let ships bring aid to Gaza’s shores – minister",
    "text": "By Dan Williams\nJERUSALEM (Reuters) – Israel is prepared to let ships deliver aid to the war-ravaged Gaza Strip “immediately” as part of a proposed sea corridor from Cyprus, the Israeli foreign minister said on Sunday, naming four European countries as potential participants.\nUnder the arrangement first suggested by Nicosia in November, cargo would undergo security inspection in the Cypriot port of Larnaca before being ferried to the Gaza coast, 370 km (230 miles) away, rather than through neighbouring Egypt or Israel.\nIf the plan goes ahead, it would mark the first easing of an Israeli naval blockade imposed on Gaza in 2007 after militant Hamas Islamists seized control of the Palestinian enclave.\nIsrael has described the corridor as a means of ending its civilian ties to Gaza, where it has been waging an 12-week-old offensive in retaliation for a cross-border killing and kidnapping spree by Hamas gunmen.\nWith hundreds of thousands of Palestinian civilians displaced, the idea may also go some way toward meeting a U.N. Security Council resolution of Dec. 22 calling for expanded humanitarian relief mechanisms.\n“It can start immediately,” Foreign Minister Eli Cohen told Tel Aviv radio station 103 FM when asked about the Mediterranean corridor.\nHe said Britain, France, Greece and the Netherlands were among countries with vessels able to land directly on the shores of Gaza, which lacks a deep-water port. He appeared to suggest he expected them to do that rather than offload aid in Israel.\n“They requested of us that the equipment come via (the Israeli port of) Ashdod. The answer is no. It won’t come via Ashdod. It won’t come via Israel. We want disengagement, with security control. That’s the goal of this process,” Cohen said.\nThere was no immediate response from London, Paris, Athens or Amsterdam.\nBritain and Greece have previously expressed support for the Cypriot initiative, with Britain offering shallow-bottomed vessels to approach the Gaza coast, a senior Cypriot official told Reuters.\nGreek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has also backed the Cypriot plan, which would involve Israeli security agents taking part in the Larnaca inspections.\n“As of now there is a maritime blockade, and if such an (aid) ship comes from Larnaca, it will be with our approval,” Cohen said. “It will of course be a secured corridor, as we have no intention of endangering a British or French ship coming in coordination with us.”\nSeveral European and Arab donor countries have been sending aid to Gaza through the nearby Egyptian coastal town of Al Arish. Israel has been involved in monitoring those shipments, in what some humanitarian relief agencies say creates lags.\nCairo tracks traffic across its Gaza border and has ruled out any influx of Palestinian refugees. On Saturday, Israel signalled it would seize control of the Gaza-Egypt border zone as part of its efforts to demilitarise the enclave.\n(Additional reporting by Michele Kambas; Writing by Dan Williams; Editing by Andrew Heavens)",

    "text": "Vancouver’s Catholic Archbishop says a ‘Sacred Covenant’ agreement has been reached with the First Nation in Kamloops, B.C., that announced the discovery the remains of more than 200 children at the site of a former residential school. Archbishop J. Michael Miller of the Catholic archdiocese of Vancouver says the agreement with the Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc will open a “new chapter” in the relationship between the church and First Nations in B.C. Miller says the church recognizes its complicity in the Canadian government’s colonialist policies toward First Nations and the “resulting tragedies” from the residential school system. Chief Rosanne Casimir of Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc says the covenant will see the church share records and information as the nation continues to investigate the site of a former Kamloops Indian Residential School where hundreds of children went missing. The nation announced in May 2021 that a search around the former school site using ground-penetrating radar found the unmarked burial sites of the remains of more than 200 children who were students at the school. The Nation and the archdiocese say the agreement includes commitments from the church on how to properly memorialize residential school survivors, information sharing about missing children and to offer “healing services” to family members of those who attended the school.

    "title": "Sacramento Diocese ordains new Filipino Catholic bishop | Sacramento Bee",
    "text": "Local Nearly every pew was filled with attendees Friday inside downtown’s Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament as the Catholic Church ordained Auxiliary Bishop Rey Bersabal, who became the fifth Filipino to be ordained as a bishop in the United States. “I’m hoping we continue to work shoulder-to-shoulder in serving the people of God in Sacramento,” Bersabal said at the conclusion of a two-hour ordination ceremony held at the cathedral on 11th Street. Bersabal, 59, speaks English, Tagalog, Visayan and Spanish. Since 2012, he has been the liaison in the Catholic Diocese of Sacramento for the Filipino presbyterate, or priesthood. Bishop Jaime Soto, who presided over Friday’s ceremony, welcomed Bersabal into the college of bishops, many of whom traveled to Sacramento from throughout California and as far as Philadelphia and the Philippines. “To provide us with another coworker,” Soto said during the ceremony. “To unite us under the Lord.“ Bersabal joined the Diocese of Sacramento in 1999 at the invitation of Bishop Emeritus William K. Weigand, serving in multiple parishes and capacities, including parochial vicar, pastor and dean across several parishes. He also has served on the diocesan priests’ personnel board, liturgical commission and independent review board. He has served as pastor of St. Francis of Assisi Parish in midtown since July 2022, and he will continue in this role while serving as vicar general of the diocese, which serves Catholics across interior California from the capital to the Oregon border. “I join you in your happiness today,” said Cardinal Christophe Louis Yves Georges Pierre, the apostolic nuncio to the U.S. on hand to read an official letter from Pope Francis elevating Bersabal. Bersabal was born in Magsaysay, Misamis Oriental in the Philippines; the youngest of three children. His family’s deep faith inspired his choice to join the priesthood. He attended both Catholic and public schools, before entering the seminary of San Jose de Mindanao in the Philippines. Bersabal later obtained a degree in philosophy from Ateneo de Cagayan Xavier University in his home country. Bersabal was ordained as a priest in April 1991, for the Archdiocese of Cagayan de Oro — holding various roles including parochial vicar, parish administrator and parish priest. He served as chancellor, archdiocesan director of the Pontifical Mission Societies, and assessor of marriage cases for the metropolitan tribunal.",
