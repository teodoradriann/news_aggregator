    "text": "Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI) warned that frequent internet disruptions in Pakistan “could derail” the country’s economic progress. In a statement posted on social media platform X on Thursday, OICCI said it has consistently advocated for a strong digital infrastructure as the backbone of Pakistan’s economic development. “However, frequent internet disruptions, such as the one currently affecting the nation, as highlighted by the Wireless and Internet Service Providers Association of Pakistan (WISPAP), threaten this vision. WISPAP has reported that, over the past few weeks, internet speeds have plummeted by 30-40%,” OICCI said. Internet services are currently disrupted across Pakistan, with the exact cause yet to be identified. OICCI statement highlights issues plaguing Pakistan’s economy that has for decades struggled to attract and retain investment. Its constant run-ins with instability, inconsistent policymaking, and a general knack of increasing expenditure in non-productive sectors have pushed away investors that do not see the population of over 240 million as a viable enough market. Bailouts with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are a frequent event, and the economy has stayed more susceptible to shocks than regional peers. In its statement, OICCI highlighted that in 2023, Pakistani startups raised just $75.8 million across 39 deals, reflecting a sharp year-over-year decline of 77% in funding and 42% in deal volume. “More significantly, freelancers generate over $1 billion in revenue for Pakistan’s economy each year, with this additional income being spent on local goods and services, thereby supporting other businesses,” it said. “These setbacks, coupled with recurring internet curbs, exacerbate the challenges faced by the services sector and erode investor confidence. With Pakistan already struggling to attract FDI, these actions risk further isolating the country from the global digital economy,” it said. The OICCI warned that such disruptions “could derail Pakistan’s economic progress, stifle innovation, and severely impact the prospects for much-needed FDI—a vital component for the nation’s economic revival”.",

    "text": "PITTSBURGH (KDKA) — Star Penn State football player Abdul Carter is accused of assaulting a tow truck driver.\nThe 20-year-old football player from Philadelphia is facing a simple assault charge in connection with the March 16 incident, WTAJ reported .\nAccording to the TV station, a tow truck driver told police officers that he noticed a Dodge Challenger parked in a lot without a parking pass at the Aspen State College apartment complex. The parking lot requires all residents to register their vehicles and obtain a parking pass.\nWTAJ reported, citing the criminal complaint, that when the driver attempted to tow the vehicle, which belonged to Carter, the vehicle's alarm went off and Carter came outside. Carter asked the tow truck driver what needed to be done to keep the car, according to the criminal complaint obtained by the TV station.\nThe driver reportedly told Carter that his vehicle would not be towed if he paid a drop fee. In the complaint obtained by WTAJ, police said Carter went inside to get the money and when he returned, he asked the tow truck driver for his credentials because Dodge Challengers are frequently stolen. The tow truck driver reportedly provided his credentials and asked the football player to fill out paperwork to drop the vehicle.\nThe interaction reportedly quickly escalated, with Carter being accused of yelling at the tow truck driver and grabbing him from behind, carrying him across the parking lot and throwing him into the grass.\nCarter's preliminary hearing is scheduled for May 22.\nLast season, Carter played in 13 games, tallying 48 tackles, 5.5 tackles for loss and 4.5 sacks. He was a first-team All-Big Ten selection. He came to Penn State after dominating the prep scene at La Salle College High School in Philadelphia.\nMore from CBS News Pro-Palestinian protesters march through Philadelphia at Temple, Penn Man fatally struck by car in Philadelphia's University City section, police say Woman charged after striking 5 pedestrians with car in Northeast Philly, police say Drexel University program helps students with autism find jobs after graduation In: Pennsylvania Football Penn State Assault Penn State University College Football Philadelphia Michael Guise Michael Guise is a web producer for KDKA-TV.
