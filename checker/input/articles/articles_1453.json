    "text": "Sexual assault cases are formally removed from the U.S. military chain of command A new system that will put independent lawyers in charge of the prosecution of sexual assault cases in the U.S. military took effect on Thursday, marking a significant change to the way the Department of Defense tries those accused of an offense. As a result of the change, sexual assault and other serious crimes [will shift away from military commanders](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/28/1190731402/military-code-sexual-assault-biden-gillibrand) to legal organizations within each military service called the Offices of Special Trial Counsel. The reform comes after years of efforts by members of Congress and others to counter a troubling rise in sexual assaults within the armed forces. For fiscal year 2022, the Pentagon's [Annual Report on Sexual Assault in the Military](https://www.sapr.mil/sites/default/files/public/docs/reports/AR/FY22/DOD_Annual_Report_on_Sexual_Assault_in_the_Military_FY2022.pdf) showed incidents rose 13% in the Navy, 9% in the Air Force and 3.6% in the Marine Corps. While incidents in the Army fell 9%, there were still 8,942 reports of sexual assault across the entire force. Last year, Congress passed legislation to strengthen protections for service members, and in July, President Biden approved the system that takes effect today. In a [statement](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3627334/statement-by-secretary-of-defense-lloyd-j-austin-iii-on-the-offices-of-special/), Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin called the reform a \"landmark change to the U.S. military justice system.\" \"It is the most important reform to our military justice system since the creation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice in 1950,\" he said. \"This reform aims to help strengthen accountability and increase all of our service members' trust in the fairness and integrity of the military justice system.\" The offices will be staffed by special trial counsel which will also have the authority to prosecute over a dozen other charges including murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, domestic violence, stalking, child pornography and most sexual misconduct within the military. The change aims to ensure decisions are not influenced by the inherent conflicts of interest and political pressures faced by commanders tasked with prosecuting members of their unit. But Rachel VanLandingham, the president emerita of the [National Institute of Military Justice](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.nimj.org/__;!!Iwwt!UbPCvSmbGISuvrCLw1BPxxJS6qOL83gyaz8yBDSEXfcqUNpX0M2GK3oeNrdji2ifc4zOhakHQBUDl2_hTJPlMVGkag$), said it remains to be seen whether the change will be effective. \"While the military lawyers are 'independent' in the sense that they no longer are part of the accused or victim's chain of command, instead working for civilian service secretaries, the entire military justice structure is one that lacks independence and impartiality and disserves service members,\" she said. The special trial counsels will now handle over a dozen crimes, but VanLandingham said the majority of offenses in the military code, including disobedience, dereliction of duty and insubordination, will still be handled by those in the chain of command who are no longer trusted to decide whether to charge murder or rape. \"The change, while in the right direction, establishes a two-track justice system depending on the alleged offenses, and thus creates due process concerns,\" VanLandingham said. Josh Connolly, a member of the board of directors of Protect Our Defenders, viewed the reform as a step forward, but said it would require truly impartial lawyers to achieve change. \"All this depends on how this is implemented,\" he said. \"If you don't have the right personnel in these divisions and they have bias, then this is all for naught.\" Copyright 2023 NPR.

    "text": "The Scripps News Group and the Scripps Howard Fund have raised more than $75,000 to provide relief for those impacted by the devastating floods in Central Texas. But Scripps said with many families in need of support, its looking for additional donations. Every donation to the Scripps disaster relief campaign supports local, trusted nonprofit organizations in Central Texas working tirelessly to help neighbors in need with response, relief and recovery efforts. Since the Scripps campaign launched on July 7, the support has seen more than $50,000 donated by hundreds of people from more than 25 states. The E.W. Scripps Company has also contributed $25,000 to bolster the relief efforts. Last Friday’s flooding killed at least 120 people, while more than 150 people remain unaccounted for nearly a week later. Among the lives lost were those of dozens of campers and staff from a Central Texas summer camp. The floods are now the deadliest instance of inland flooding in the U.S. since 1976, when Colorado’s Big Thompson Canyon flooded, killing 144 people, according to a new report. “The scale of this disaster is devastating,” said Meredith Delaney , Scripps Howard Fund president and CEO. “The donations from hundreds of Scripps News Group viewers from across the U.S. and our local station markets will make a significant impact toward providing essential care and support. But the need is far from over. This campaign, in partnership with The E.W. Scripps Company, allows us to connect the generosity of Scripps viewers with our neighbors in Texas who need immediate and sustained assistance.” The Scripps News Group, which is comprised of national and local Scripps journalists, will show the impact of the donations in the coming weeks across all of its platforms.

I watched as Eve and OS1’s staff quickly jumped into action to help the patient by taking her information and prepping an exam room. While my eyewitness account ended there, it showed that OS1 is a place that is quick and efficient and truly cares about its patients.

WHY IT IS IMPORTANT In November 2021, Tony Chung, who was then 20, was sentenced to 43 months in prison for trying to separate the city from China, and for money laundering. [Reuters](/reuters-stories)| Updated: 29-12-2023 03:34 IST | Created: 29-12-2023 03:34 IST The former leader of a Hong Kong pro-independence group, who was sentenced under a national security law imposed by China, fled to Britain and will seek asylum over there, he told the Washington Post. WHY IT IS IMPORTANT In November 2021, Tony Chung, who was then 20, was sentenced to 43 months in prison for trying to separate the city from China, and for money laundering. Chung was charged with secession under the sweeping national security law in 2020 and denied bail. Beijing imposed the national security law on the Asian financial hub in 2020 after months of anti-government protests. The law punishes acts including subversion, secession, collusion with foreign forces, and extremism with up to life in prison. KEY QUOTES The trauma of detention and continued surveillance left Chung with a feeling of \"immense pressure and fear,\" compelling him to leave, he told the newspaper. Chung also said he was made to take part in a compulsory \"deradicalization\" program in detention. Guards \"kept telling us (him and others in prison) that the United States government is really bad and that we had been manipulated by the United States,\" Chung was quoted as saying. \"We felt like we had to agree with them, that we couldn't disagree or argue back.\" Chung was eventually released in June 2023 after his time was reduced for good behavior, according to the Washington Post. He plans to continue his studies and told the Post he will contribute everything he can in exile, \"just as before.\" CONTEXT Chung is the former leader of Hong Kong pro-independence group Studentlocalism that dissolved in 2020 before the security law came into effect. Prosecutors had said at the time he was charged that he acted as an administrator for the Facebook pages of the U.S. branch of Studentlocalism and an organization called the Initiative Independence Party. They also said pro-independence T-shirts, flags and books were seized from his home. The former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the promise of a high degree of autonomy. Democracy activists and some Western governments say China broke that promise, an allegation that Beijing denies.

    "title": "L’impression 3D au service de la lutte contre la « fast fashion »",
    "text": "L’impression 3D au service de la lutte contre la « fast fashion »\nMélanie W.\nQuand on se penche sur la question de l’environnement et les problématiques que l’on connaît actuellement, l’impact de l’industrie textile arrive vite dans la discussion. L’évolution rapide des tendances de la\nmode, l’apparition constante de nouvelles collections et la consommation croissante de vêtements entraînent une production énorme dans le monde entier. Ce que l’on appelle la « fast fashion » signifie en fin de compte que d’énormes quantités de vêtements finissent chaque jour à la poubelle et qu’on continue à trop en produire. Pour remédier à cette situation, les écologistes et les nouvelles directives gouvernementales demandent que la chaîne de valeur textile mondiale devienne plus efficace en termes de ressources et soit plus durable. Aujourd’hui, afin de contrer le cercle vicieux qui consiste à jeter et à acheter de nouveaux vêtements et de promouvoir la production locale et l’économie circulaire, une équipe de chercheurs de l’Université d’art et de design de Linz a débuté un projet intéressant. L’idée est de s’appuyer sur des matériaux et des technologies innovants, tels que l’impression 3D, pour fabriquer des vêtements.\nDans le cadre de leur projet artistique et scientifique PEEK « Fashion and Robotics », les chercheurs développent de nouvelles approches pour une production de mode plus durable. Le projet, financé par le Fonds autrichien pour la science (AWF), combine le développement de tissus organiques qui poussent en trois dimensions à partir d’une solution nutritive, de robots pour réparer les trous dans les vêtements et de l’IA pour rationaliser les usines. La recherche de l’équipe s’est principalement concentrée sur une approche fondamentalement nouvelle du processus de production en utilisant des technologies innovantes telles que l’impression 3D et de nouveaux matériaux, plutôt que d’optimiser le processus traditionnel.\nProduire, réparer des vêtements et lutter contre la fast fashion grâce à l’impression 3D\nDans la première phase du projet de recherche, les chercheurs ont produit un vêtement à l’aide de\nrobots utilisant l’impression 3D. En outre, l’équipe interdisciplinaire a développé des bras robotiques capables de couper ou de coudre en trois dimensions. L’étape suivante a consisté à développer l’électrofilage. Cette technologie visait à remplacer le « reprisage » conventionnel par un processus innovant et plus durable. Selon M. Braumann, un polymère est pulvérisé sur la zone déchirée d’un vêtement dans un champ de haute tension par un bras robotisé, formant ainsi des nanofibres qui se lient au textile.\nCette robotique de réparation des vêtements présente des avantages prometteurs. L’automatisation peut réduire les coûts de réparation à environ 2 dollars, ce qui rend les réparations plus abordables que l’achat de nouveaux articles et donc plus attrayantes. Ces robots pourraient également être utilisés dans des usines à grand volume et contribuer ainsi à une production plus durable. De plus, pour les usines, une IA serait capable de scanner les vêtements défectueux à l’avance et de reconnaître les zones qui doivent être réparées. Toutefois, la technologie pourrait également être utilisée au-delà de la réparation pour la « refonte en 3D » des vêtements dans les ateliers de retouche. Cela permettrait de prolonger le cycle de vie des vêtements.\nPour rendre les matériaux de la mode plus durables, les chercheurs ont également travaillé avec Werner Baumgartner pour cultiver pour la première fois des pantalons et des chaussures en 3D. Au cours de ce processus, des biomatériaux non fibreux nouvellement développés remplacent les opérations habituelles de coupe et de couture des textiles. Les matériaux se développent à partir de bactéries, et même en trois dimensions, par exemple à l’aide d’embauchoirs – la chaussure finie peut alors être détachée facilement.\nChristiane Luible-Bär, maître de conférences à l’université d’art et de design de Linz, qui a participé au projet, explique : « Le robot est également important dans ce cas, mais dans un nouveau rôle, à savoir celui de fournisseur de nourriture. Les bactéries ont besoin d’une solution nutritive régulièrement et à des heures précises, et une machine peut les nourrir de manière plus fiable qu’un être humain« .\nBien que les vêtements produits à partir de cellulose bactérienne ne soient pour l’instant que le résultat d’expériences de recherche fondamentale, ils représentent une étape vers l’application un jour concrète du processus. De plus amples informations sont disponibles\nICI.\nQue pensez-vous de l’utilisation de la fabrication additive pour lutter contre cette tendance de la fast fashion ?
