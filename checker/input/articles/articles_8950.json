    "title": "Collaboration Between Roadway Safety Research and Automated Vehicle Testing Unveiled at U-M",
    "text": "The University of Michigan (U-M), renowned for its rich legacy in transportation safety research, is embarking on a significant initiative to merge its expertise in connected and automated vehicle technologies with a renewed focus on saving lives. This endeavor marks a notable expansion of the University’s Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI) as it incorporates the Mcity public/private partnership and test facility. Effective from March 1, this organizational shift is positioned to transform the landscape of mobility technology research and testing, enhancing safety measures for the future of transportation.\nAt the helm of this transformative expansion is Henry Liu, who has been leading Mcity since 2022. Liu, a distinguished professor of civil and environmental engineering, articulates the potential this merger holds for amplifying the impact of their work. He emphasizes that while UMTRI contributes invaluable research focused on safety, Mcity’s unique testing capabilities will complement this by facilitating the development of cutting-edge technologies. This collaborative approach is designed to extend beyond engineering advancements, addressing the societal impacts and human factors associated with transportation innovations.\nThe transition is significant not only because it brings a synergistic approach to transportation safety but also because it brings together the historical legacies of UMTRI and Mcity. UMTRI, recognized for launching substantial safety research initiatives, will be guided by Liu, succeeding James Sayer, who has led the institute for nearly a decade. Under Sayer’s leadership, the institute has made considerable strides in reducing roadway fatalities, correlating its research with real-world vehicle safety developments.\nMcity, established in 2015 as the world’s inaugural purpose-built test track for connected and automated vehicles, represents a substantial investment in the future of transportation safety. The collaboration that produced this facility illustrates a commitment from academia, industry giants, and government bodies to reshape the way vehicles are tested in increasingly complex urban environments. Sayer’s assertion that their trajectory in road safety has now come full circle underscores the urgent need to reevaluate strategies in light of the staggering number of fatalities occurring each year.\nDuring the 1960s, traffic fatalities surged alarmingly as vehicle ownership rose and cars became faster and more powerful. In response, a consortium of federal agencies and automotive manufacturers, including Ford and GM, established UMTRI’s predecessor to specifically address traffic safety concerns. Over the years, the institute’s research has been pivotal in achieving a 35% estimated decrease in roadway fatalities per capita, which underlines the effectiveness of early safety innovations and ongoing research.\nAs automakers accelerate their focus on connected and automated technologies, UMTRI’s methodologies for crash analysis and safety research have attracted significant attention. This includes pioneering efforts in connected vehicle deployments that collectively encompassed millions of miles driven by thousands of participants. These studies have provided invaluable insights into how technology can substantially mitigate the risks posed by impaired and distracted driving.\nAmong the notable advancements initiated at UMTRI are developments in crash test dummy technology and occupant safety systems. During the 1970s, enhancements to the realism of crash test dummies facilitated a deeper understanding of human physiology and safety needs in vehicle design. This research has had enduring impacts, serving as foundational elements for vehicle safety systems like airbags, child safety seats, and seatbelt technologies.\nUMTRI’s research extended into discomforting statistics around roadway safety in the early 1990s, prompting researchers to introduce an array of data-driven solutions. Notably, their investigations culminated in the establishment of the International Roughness Index, which has become vital for evaluating road quality and safety. By ensuring that vehicles are optimized not only for performance but also for safety in diverse environments, UMTRI has laid the groundwork for safer roads globally.\nAs the industry continues to pivot toward automation, the recent focus on connected vehicle data in real-world settings has become pivotal. UMTRI’s partnership with federal transport agencies to implement large-scale connected vehicle deployments demonstrates a proactive approach to integrating technology into safety protocols. The earlier Safety Pilot Model Deployment revealed the potential for connected vehicles to decrease unimpaired crashes by an astounding 80%, setting the stage for further enhancements in safety protocols.\nMcity’s test facility is an exemplar of a proactive approach to developing automated technologies. Encompassing 32 acres designed to simulate urban and suburban environments, the facility affords researchers and manufacturers a controlled environment to rigorously test and validate new mobility technologies. This testing mechanism not only provides safety assurances but also creates a benchmark for the deployment of emerging automated systems that prioritize user safety.\nThe current intersection of UMTRI and Mcity signifies an unprecedented leap towards comprehensively addressing the challenges of road safety. Liu’s outlook suggests that innovative automation is crucial in significantly reducing roadway fatalities. Thus, the collaboration seeks to focus not solely on the technological enhancement of vehicles but also on evolving safety designs to protect occupants in an automated context, considering factors like seating positions and safety restraints.\nAs the landscape of transportation evolves, U-M’s Transportation Research Institute and Mcity are reaching a pivotal moment framed by an escalating public safety crisis. Each year, more than 40,000 individuals lose their lives on U.S. roads, compelling a collective reevaluation of safety strategies. Current governmental frameworks are recognizing this epidemic and advocating for the integration of automated technologies as part of a comprehensive solution. The need for collaborative and systemic approaches to transportation safety cannot be overstated, highlighting the importance of research that not only innovates but also informs policy and practice in a rapidly changing landscape.\nIn conclusion, U-M’s emphasis on merging the strengths of UMTRI and Mcity illustrates a forward-thinking approach to developing safer transportation solutions. As researchers navigate the complexities of integrating automated technologies into everyday driving, their focus remains steadfast on creating an environment that prioritizes safety and well-being. By fostering partnerships within the education, industry, and government sectors, U-M is poised to drive the future of transportation safety into previously uncharted territories.\nSubject of Research : Integration of Transportation Safety Research and Automated Vehicle Technologies\nArticle Title : The Future of Safe Transportation: University of Michigan Integrates UMTRI and Mcity\nNews Publication Date : March 1, 2023\nWeb References : https://www.umtri.umich.edu, https://mcity.umich.edu\nReferences : National Safety Council, 2023 NRC data, U.S. Department of Transportation\nImage Credits : University of Michigan\nKeywords",

    "title": "In Kanyakumari, PM Modi concludes meditation; says he feels divine energy",
    "text": "KANYAKUMARI (Tamil Nadu), June 1: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday concluded his 45-hour-long meditation at the Vivekananda Rock Memorial here and said he felt a divine energy.\nOn conclusion of his dhyana session, Modi, clad in white, visited the 133-ft statue of Thiruvalluvar, located next to the rock memorial and placed a huge garland there marking his tribute. He arrived at the statue complex by a ferry service and later reached the shore using the service.\nBJP leader and Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in a post on ‘X’ said: “On completing his meditation on the Vivekananda Rock Memorial PM @narendramodi writes: Visiting the ‘Vivekananda Rock Memorial’ at Kanyakumari, the southernmost tip of India, I feel a divine energy.”\nFurthermore, the PM said: “It is on this rock that Mother Parvati and Swami Vivekananda had meditated. Later, Eknath Ranade transformed this rock into a ‘Shila Smarak’ that brought Swami Vivekananda’s thoughts to life.\nSwami Vivekananda, a leader of spiritual renaissance, has been my ideal, my energy, and the source of my spirituality. Years ago, after traveling across the entire country, when Swami Vivekananda meditated here, it was here that he envisioned a new direction for India’s revival.\nIt is my fortune that today, after so many years, as India embodies the values and ideals of Swami Vivekananda, I too have had the opportunity to meditate at this sacred place.\nMy meditation at this ‘Shila Smarak’ is one of the unforgettable moments of my life. Sitting at the feet of ‘Ma Bharati’, I once again reaffirm my resolve that every moment of my life and every particle of my body will always be dedicated to the service of the nation.\nWith wishes for the progress of the nation and the welfare of its citizens, I offer my utmost reverence to ‘Ma Bharati'”.\nThe Prime Minister left by a helicopter for Thiruvananthapuram and from there, he left for Delhi. On his arrival here on May 30, the PM prayed at the Bhagavathy Amman temple and later arrived at the Vivekananda Rock Memorial.\nDuring his stay at the memorial, the PM did meditation and also performed ‘Surya Arghya’ at the time of sunrise, a ritual associated with spiritual practice. Modi was clad in saffron while he was engaged in meditation at the Vivekananda Rock Memorial.\nThe PM’s visit to Kanyakumari to perform meditation evoked opposition from INDIA bloc constituents including Tamil Nadu’s ruling DMK. The opposition was to the broadcast of meditation in view of last phase of polling on June 1.\nIn view of the PM’s stay, senior DMK leader and Water Resources Minister Duraimurugan on May 31 alleged that tourists were not allowed in that area which had seriously affected the local businesses and ‘we have pointed out that this is not good.’\nTamil Nadu Congress Committee president K Selvaperunthagai on Saturday told reporters that those doing meditation do it peacefully without any hindrance and all alone. “How can a person do Dhyana with 14 cameras in front of him? Is this meditation? This is dhyana eyeing electoral politics,” the Congress leader alleged. He accused Modi of trying to sully Swami Vivekananda’s reputation by acting against the spiritual leader’s legacy and hence, ‘condemnable.’\nAt the Vivekananda Rock Memorial, the PM embarked on his 45-hour long meditation on the evening of May 30 and completed it on Saturday. Kanyakumari is famous for its sunrise and sunset and the memorial is located on a tiny islet near the shoreline. (PTI)",

Try to stay up late if you can tonight, October 3rd and tomorrow, October 4th as the Aurora Borealis could be visible from Toronto.\nWhat’s happening? If the weather holds up, Toronto could get an overhead view of the Northern Lights!\nAccording to the University of Alaska Fairbanks, “High(+) aurora activity forecasted. If skies are clear, highly active auroral displays may be visible overhead from locations such as Inuvik, Yellowknife, Rankin and Iqaluit, Canada, to Vancouver, Helena, Minneapolis, Milwaukee, Bay City, Toronto and Montpelier, U.S.A., and Charlottetown, Canada; and may be visible low on the horizon from Salem, Boise, Cheyenne, Lincoln, Indianapolis and Annapolis, U.S.A..”\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), states that a storm watch is issued tonight with a G1 rating meaning the aurora will be moderate, today, October 3rd a G3 storm is issued (active) and on October 4th another G2 storm (moderate).\nHow intense will they be? Active Region 3842 produces another (R3 – Strong) solar flare, an X9.0 at 1218 UTC on October 3rd, 2024.\nStay Tuned to https://t.co/YLUbTRM02y for the latest updates! pic.twitter.com/0b0GR5xEY7\n— NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center (@NWSSWPC) October 3, 2024\nBased on the Kp number system that Alaska Fairbanks University uses to measure the aurora strength – 0 being calm to 9 being a major geomagnetic storm with strong auroras visible, tonight, October 3rd and tomorrow October 4th will peak at a Kp 7 into Saturday.\nWhat are the best times to watch for auroras? According to the University of Alaska , “the best time to watch for the aurora is the three or four hours centred around midnight.”\nWhere can I see them? The downtown core won’t be the best spot to see the Northern Lights because of light pollution so you’ll want to get a little outside of the city.\nThe closest Ontario Dark Sky Preserves near Toronto include Point Pelee National Park, Torrance Barrens Conservation Reserve and Point Pelee National Park – these will be your best bet for catching a great view!\nWeather According to Environment Canada, the weather in Toronto is calling for a chance of showers tonight, October 3rd and clear skies tomorrow, October 4th so tomorrow may be your best bet!\nWill you be checking out the Northern Lights, Toronto?\nRecent Posts:\nLionel Messi could play in Toronto this weekend & tickets are still available\nCanada’s first & largest pickle festival is coming to Toronto",

    "text": "Por Mubasher Bukhari LAHORE, PAQUISTÃO (Reuters) - Pelo menos dez membros de uma comunidade minoritária cristã foram resgatados neste sábado, depois que uma multidão muçulmana atacou o assentamento sob acusação de blasfêmia no leste do Paquistão, disseram a polícia e um líder comunitário. A multidão acusou o grupo de blasfêmia e atirou pedras e tijolos contra a polícia, disse Shariq Kamal, chefe da polícia do distrito de Sargodha. Pelo menos uma casa e uma pequena fábrica de calçados foram incendiadas pelos manifestantes, que se reuniram depois que vizinhos alegaram que o livro sagrado muçulmano, o Alcorão, havia sido profanado por um membro da comunidade, segundo um porta-voz da polícia e Akmal Bhatti, um líder cristão. “Eles queimaram uma casa e vários cristãos foram espancados”, disse Bhatti. Um grande contingente de policiais isolou o assentamento, disse Kamal, acrescentando que a multidão foi rechaçada. Mais tarde, informaram que um membro da comunidade cristã que foi levado ao hospital estava em condição estável. A situação se acalmou tarde da noite, com líderes de ambos os lados pedindo paz, disse a polícia. Um grupo de direitos cristãos, o Minority Rights March, disse que um homem de 70 anos acusado de blasfêmia foi espancado e arrastado pela multidão. O grupo afirma que imagens de vídeo mostraram que a polícia não interveio. A polícia negou a alegação. (Reportagem de Asif Shahzad)",

    "text": "Los aires se respiran candentes en Génova. Con el telón de fondo del caso judicial que se cierne sobre la pareja de la presidenta madrileña Isabel Díaz Ayuso, al igual que la investigación sobre su ‘número 3’ en Madrid por hasta cuatro presuntos delitos, la cúpula del Partido Popular rehúsa de ahondar en las cuestiones que sitúan en el foco a la lideresa regional en el debate político.\nFuentes de Génova señalan a ElPlural.com que “el único caso judicializado es el de su pareja”, Alberto González Amador, investigado por dos presuntos delitos fiscales y otro de falsedad documental. Un aspecto que, tal y como alegan, “no corresponde con el tiempo en el que llevan juntos” sentimentalmente.\nAsimismo, respaldan que, en el caso de González Amador, del cual se están conociendo cada vez más detalles, “no hay indicios de implicación de la Comunidad de Madrid”. Unas palabras que la propia Ayuso ya ha venido defendiendo en los últimos días, señalando que su novio no ha ido a hacer negocios a la Puerta del Sol; sin embargo, y en tono de férrea oposición al Gobierno de Pedro Sánchez, sí que emplea el mismo argumento, a la inversa, para señalar a Begoña Gómez.\nEn cuanto a la investigación judicial que rodea a Ana Millán, ‘número 3’ del PP de Ayuso y vicepresidenta de la Asamblea regional, bajo la lupa por haber cometido, presuntamente, hasta cuatro delitos -prevaricación, cohecho, tráfico de influencias y fraude contra la administración pública-, desde Génova se limitan a señalar que las responsabilidades son de la dirección de Ayuso y descartan entrar en valoraciones: “Al no tratarse de un cargo nacional, corresponde al PP de Madrid tomar las decisiones que considere oportunas”.\nFeijóo esquivaría el camino que tomó Casado\nEsta actitud adoptada por los populares sobre una cuestión que sitúa en el epicentro a uno de los pesos pesados del partido como es Díaz Ayuso y su entorno, ¿sería una postura que pretende alejarse de los pasos que declinaron en la salida de Pablo Casado de la dirección del PP?\nLo cierto es que la hemeroteca da muestra de un escenario similar a la crisis interna que el PP vivió cuando salieron a la luz los contratos sanitarios durante la pandemia en los que estuvo implicado el hermano de la presidenta madrileña, Tomás Díaz Ayuso, momento en el que el entonces cabeza de los populares denunció públicamente estos hechos. Posteriormente, y tras un breve periodo de enfrentamiento a puerta cerrada, Casado terminó por abandonar la dirección y dejar el testigo a Núñez Feijóo.\nDe vuelta a lo acontecido en los últimos días, tanto por los últimos detalles que han trascendido mediáticamente acerca de la causa que rodea a González Amador como por la decisión de Díaz Ayuso de no reunirse con Sánchez en clave institucional -alegando como razón de peso la primera causa-, desde la cúpula de Núñez Feijóo han respaldado su postura, pero, al tiempo, han evitado ahondar mucho más allá al respecto.\nNo hay más que recordar las palabras de este lunes del portavoz nacional, Borja Sémper que, tras conocer la decisión del Ejecutivo de la Puerta del Sol, alegó que las relaciones entre Madrid y Moncloa “ya están rotas” por “los insultos y el acoso permanente del Gobierno a Díaz Ayuso”.\nUna postura que chocó frontalmente con las palabras de Núñez Feijóo hace un mes atrás en una entrevista en ‘El Mundo’, cuando calificó de “error” el hipotético escenario en el que un mandatario autonómico no acudiese a la llamada del presidente del Gobierno. Dando la vuelta así al argumentario, el líder del PP, hace apenas unos días atrás, reiteró que esta cuestión “ya está suficientemente explicada y la gente lo ha entendido”, reiterando así su cierre de filas con la dirigente madrileña.\nAyuso, férrea en sus ataques a Moncloa\nEsgrimiendo que el Ejecutivo de Sánchez y los socialistas están impulsando una “campaña de desprestigio” en su contra y de su entorno más cercano, Díaz Ayuso, en sus últimas intervenciones públicas en las que ha sido preguntada por estas cuestiones, ha volcado su defensa en reforzar su papel de oposición desde la Puerta del Sol.\nEjemplo de ello, lo sucedido este jueves en el Pleno de la Asamblea de Madrid, donde estas temáticas han vuelto a aflorar de la mano de la oposición en aras de que la lideresa madrileña dé las explicaciones pertinentes. No obstante, Ayuso se ha enrocado, de nuevo, en la crítica al Gobierno de Sánchez, defendiendo así que “un hilo dental” -haciendo referencia a las publicaciones de prensa que señalan las actuaciones de su pareja- no tapará “la montaña de corrupción” que asegura que se cierne sobre Moncloa.\nEn estos términos, ha acusado al \"aparato del Gobierno\" de ir \"en contra de un ciudadano particular\": \"Confío en la justicia y el tiempo pone todo en su sitio. Iremos hablando uno en uno ante la defensa contra un gobierno organizado de distintos departamentos ante el ataque desmedido para intentar desguazar su prestigio para ir contra un adversario político, es muy estalinista y no es propio de una democracia. (…) La montaña de corrupción es tan grande que, créanme, un hilo dental no lo va a tapar\", ha subrayado.",

    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\nSolo hay una cosa más peligrosa que los alérgenos para los niños alérgicos y son las personas que no entienden el peligro que puede provocar esto.\nMe ha pasado sobre todo con gente mayor y curiosamente con gente que trabaja en restauración.\n[#1](c1#c-1) Qué importante es la educación, y clave en los propios afectados, que han de saber que ciertas cosas NO pueden tomar.\nLa noticia no especifica el origen...\n[#1](c1#c-1) La gente no entiende que antes no tenías tantos niños con alergia, precisamente, porque se morían antes...\nLa mortalidad infantil es ahora mínima porque los niños que antes morían por alergias o por problemas de salud derivadas de dichas alergias ahora no lo hacen...\nY en lugar de \"molestar\" un par de años, están vivos a los 10.\nEs el \"sesgo del superviviente\" y es tela de complicado que lo vea la gente con mas edad.\n[#6](c6#c-6) ¿Siglos?\nA ver, que la tasa de muertes infantiles llegó a sus mínimos (donde se mantiene) en la década de los 10, pero eso significa que era más alta en los 2000, en los 90s, en los 80s, etc...\nEl comentario inicial habla de gente mayor y esa gente era niña en los 70s y 80s...\nEs que hoy en día no existen muchos niños con alergias, lo que ocurre es que, esos niños siguen vivos muchos años mientras que antes podían morir.\n[#7](c7#c-7) Me ha picado la curiosidad, y veo en multitud de sitios que sí, que el número de niños alérgicos está aumentando continuamente.\nhttps://cadenaser.com/nacional/2023/06/16/el-numero-de-ninos-con-reacciones-alergicas-a-los-alimentos-aumenta-cada-ano-un-2-cadena-ser/\nQue no es por discutir, yo de esto ni idea, pero parece ser que tu teoría no es correcta.\n[#23](c23#c-23) y uno de los motivos es la mejora en los diagnósticos, lo pone en el propio artículo:\n\"La doctora Valdesoiro Navarrete asegura que este aumento de casos se debe, por un lado, a la mejora en los diagnósticos y, por otro, a las características de nuestro entorno.\"\n[#26](c26#c-26) y, por otro, a las características de nuestro entorno. “Este aumento de alergias es multifactorial y hay varias hipótesis para explicarlo: por un lado, está la higienista que defiende que la reducción del contacto microbiano a una edad temprana hace que aumenten las enfermedades alérgicas. Luego están los que sostienen que es todo lo contrario, que se desarrollan más alergias por la exposición a contaminantes ambientales y aditivos alimentarios.”\nEs decir, que no es sesgo del superviviente. Es que, probablemente, enfermen más por haber estado menos expuestos a alérgenos... o todo lo contrario. De cualquier modo, hay más alérgicos y mejor tratados, no los mismos pero mejor tratados.\n[#28](c28#c-28) Creo que no lo estás entendiendo. Somos más alérgicos porque estamos vivos.\nYo estuve a punto de palmar con 9 años un día que estaba en casa de un amigo y me dejé el Ventolin en casa. De no ser por la existencia de la alergología y los broncodilatadores, yo sería una cifra más de muertes infantiles y una cifra menos de alérgicos.\nAntes la gente se moría por causas indeterminadas: fiebres, debilidad extrema, asfixia, toses persistenes... Hoy le podemos poner bombre: septicemia, celiaquía, asma, cáncer.\n[#36](c36#c-36) Es una cuestión multifactorial, claro. Pero yo que lo he sufrido toda mi vida y mi hermana que sí ha estudiado sobre inmunología tenemos razones bien fundamentadas.\n[#34](c34#c-34) Yo debería haber muerto con 10 años o así por una neumonía.\nAdemás de al nacer porque \"me lié\" con el cordón umbilical y la suerte que ya existía una prueba para saberlo antes de comenzar las contracciones.\nMi hija sin bronco dilatadores podría haber muerto porque es alérgica a los ácaros del polvo de España y no lo sabíamos porque no había estado en España lo suficiente para descubrirlo (al parecer los ácaros son distintos en España y en Taiwán... Primera noticia que tengo pero aquí nunca ha tenido alergia y en España tuvimos un susto de hopitalizarla)\n[#52](c52#c-52) Sobre la celiquia salio un articulo hace poco que todavia no me he leido.\nLos investigadores resuelven un misterio de la celiaquía: ¿dónde comienza la reacción al gluten? (Eng) [#34](c34#c-34) repito, no es tan simple, la mortalidad infantil NO ha disminuido en los últimos 15 años, pero el número de alérgicos se ha ... duplicado en los últimos 15 años., Ni los expertos te dan una razón específica, se cree que son varias pero no es como dices\n[#58](c58#c-58) En otra respuesta más abajo dije que era multifactorial, pero parece que hay suficientes factores como para explicarlo sin teorías locas de que nos echen droja en el colacado, que es por donde suelen ir los comentarios alarmistas.\nSomos segunda o tercera generación de alérgicos graves supervivientes, muchos con hijos alérgicos (la selección natural ya no nos elimina), moderna exposición vírica intensa con estrés al sistema inmune (alteraciones de intensidad/agresividad de respuesta), monocultivo disparado por regiones (mayor densidad de polen), productividad agraria en máximos históricos (mayor polen en términos absolutos)...\n[#28](c28#c-28) supongo que por una parte, que los niños tengan menos contacto con la naturaleza, que se coman tierra, se ensucien, etc. y que estén siempre en un entorno más limpio, hace que el cuerpo esté menos \"adaptado\", pero por otro, que la contaminacion, la mierda que hechan en la comida, etc. También provoca estas alergias, por muy en el campo que te cries.\nClaro esta que también ahora se detectan mas cosas que antes. Todo suma\n[#29](c29#c-29) Es muy probable, no es el único factor.\nPero yo, cuando estaba en la EGB, recuerdo a compañeros que casi no salían de casa por las alergias que tenían.\nAntes se ocultaban (como los que tenían problemas de movilidad) ahora en la clase de mi hija tienes una niña que va todas las semanas al hospital y va a clase todos los días.\nLa visibilidad también es un factor a tener en cuenta.\n[#23](c23#c-23) Yo tengo un colega que le diagnosticaron la alergia a la leche con más de 20, cuando se fue a currar a Irlanda...\ncomo dice\n[#26](c26#c-26)\nPero como digo, también es que ha aumentado.\n[#35](c35#c-35) No es el único factor porque también nos reproducimos ahora.\nYo soy alérgico porque mi madre no murió por ser alérgica, mi abuelo también lo era. Éramos cuatro (abuelo, madre, dos nietos) que se hubiera quedado en uno sin diagnosticar, si mi madre hubiera muerto de pequeña.\n[#44](c44#c-44) Mi hermana es como mi abuelo, podría haber sobrevivido sin diagnóstico porque apenas necesita tratamiento. Mi madre las pasó canutas de pequeña y yo que soy mucho más alérgico tengo claro que estaría muerto.\nO lo mismo hubiera sobrevivido por la protección de la virgen de Covadonga yendo a Asturias a un sanatorio no científico por la casualidad de que allí no hay olivar extensivo. Cuando observas y experimentas los límites de tu propia alergia pues te da una perspectiva histórica interesante de cómo se trataban estas cuestiones.\n[#23](c23#c-23) tiene y no tiene que ver pero es como el problema/acertijo sobre por què cuando se empezaron a usar cascos en las guerras empezó a haber más heridos en la cabeza si se supone que el casco era una protección extra….. porque había menos muertos…. Hoy en día incluso la gente muy mayor se muere por esto por aquello o por lo otro, hace 50/60 años (por poner un número) la gente mayor de moría…. Porque era muy mayor…..con los niños/bebés pasa exactamente lo mismo, enfermedades que hoy se detectan/subsanan hace años ni se sabía que existían hace años no, por eso (entre otras muchas razones) la mortalidad infantil era bastante mayor\n[#7](c7#c-7) no es del todo correcta, por ejemplo en USA hay mas mortalidad infantil que en Europa y hay mayor numero de alérgicos\n[#56](c56#c-56) Hemos estado hablando del tema varios por aquí y nos hemos dado cuenta que, los hijos de quienes han tenido alergias y han sobrevivido también tienen más posibilidades de tener alergias.\nYa llevamos unas 3 generaciones, en USA, han tenido un mayor acceso a los medicamentos contra la alergia o incluso para durante los 40 y 50, incluso más, porque aquí tenías gente sin vacunar de la Polio en los 70s por la corrupción (y el odio al pobre) del franquismo.\nAsí que eso son otros dos o 3 generaciones más...\nAl final puede ser que eso pueda explicar un amplio % del número de alérgicos o el porqué en USA tienen más que en el resto del mundo.\nEdito: Se me olvidó comentar lo de la mayor mortandad infantil en USA.\nSobre todo es en parto y de personas de bajos recursos.\n[#4](c4#c-4) eso que comentas puede tener alguna incidencia limitada, sobre todo en alergias extremas, pero la realidad es que el número de personas alérgicas ha ido creciendo de manera consistente y no es atribuible únicamente a una mayor tasa de diagnóstico y menos a una menor mortalidad infantil.\nNo está del todo claro pero se cree que está relacionado con cambios en los hábitos de vida. Menor exposición a patógenos y alérgenos, contaminación ambiental, etc.\n[#29](c29#c-29) Yo diría que incluso al revés, estamos más expuestos a alérgenos ahora. Yo soy alérgico al melón y es algo que desarrollé muy tardío respecto a otras alergias que tengo.\nQuien hace un siglo no tuviera contacto con el melón, cacahuetes... Simplemente no tenía alergias porque su alimentación no era variada. Quien fuera celíaco simplemente se moría sin razón.\nY hay una posible causa que poco se menciona porque afecta a los terratenientes: Hoy en día también se fomenta mucho el monocultivo. Antes alrededor de los pueblos había variedad de cultivos para abastecer al pueblo de productos bariados (aceites, cereales, frutas, hortalizas...). Ahora sólo ves olivo, olivo, olivo y más olivo, todo junto. La densidad de pólenes iguales que se alcanzan son tremendos.\nTengo una amiga que no era alérgica hasta que tuvo que pasar un año de traslado en Jaén y le dio una alergia tremenda esa primavera y desde que volvió es alérgica también fuera (menuda putada). Yo he dejado de necesitar medicación específica e intensa de un año para otro desde que me mudé a la ciudad para estudiar y me fui del pueblo rodeado de olivares. Y por supuesto si se me ocurre volver en primavera me pongo enfermísimo.\n[#37](c37#c-37) hace un siglo vivirías en un entorno mucho menos estéril, con mucha más exposición a alérgenos y patógenos, por mucho que no conocieses el melón.\nQue no se trata de que desarrolles una alergia por no exponerte un alimento en concreto, sino por no exponer tu sistema inmune, que es extremadamente complejo, a distintos alérgenos en general. Si la comida que te llevas a la boca contiene un sinfín de patógenos porque no existen estándares de seguridad alimentaria y de higiene, o si el agua que bebes está contaminada, es menos probable que tu sistema inmune reaccione contra un alimento que resulta inocuo, simplemente porque tiene asuntos más importantes con los que lidiar.\nPor ejemplo, está documentado como el contacto temprano con animales reduce las posibilidades de desarrollar alergias alimentarias.\n[#47](c47#c-47) De verdad, si no sois alérgicos, inmunoalterados o médicos especialistas... no tengáis opiniones tan tajantes porque no sabéis lo que vivimos. (Yo soy las dos y la tercera en la familia).\nPatógenos bacterianos estamos menos expuestos que nunca por la limpieza y los antibióticos. Pero estamos expuestos muchísimo más a patógenos víricos porque la economía y los tranaportes están globalizados: el covid viajó por todo el planeta en tres meses, la gripe A es común desde hace una década, la gripe estacional no era estacional porque no había una red global de transmisión y supervivencia entre hemisferios...\nUn sistema inmune del siglo XIX, o palmaba de niño por debilidad o no estaba expuesto a tanta mierda vírica de adulto constantemente. Por eso el sistema inmune de un adulto del siglo XXI es más probable que desarrolle patologías: supervivencia y exposición intensa.\nLa alergia es una consecuencia, no una causa. Estamos más expuestos a alérgenos porque comemos de todo, viajamos, vivimos rodeados de monocultivo y picos de polen nunca antes alcanzados en la historia por el rendimiento agrícola actual.\nYo no soy alérgico al ciprés japonés porque nunca he tenido contacto con él. Si fuera la única alergia posible yo no sería alérgico... hasta que viajara a Japón. Igual que un japonés alérgico al olivo nunca lo sabría hasta que viaje a España. Y es probable que ambas situaciones ocurran hipotéticamente, de cero a dos alérgicos por un sencillo viaje en avión que antes era imposible.\n[#50](c50#c-50) debe de ser que ser alérgico te convierte en una autoridad en la materia... Y familia de médico... Eso te convierte en el candidato perfecto a Dunning-Krugger de cojones.\nQue aquí el que está siendo vehemente eres tú. Que yo he señalado que \"no está del todo claro\". Que no te enteras, que la relación entre la exposición a patógenos virales y el desarrollo de alergias no está clara; podría desempeñar un papel protector, potenciador, o ambos simultáneamente, interactuando de manera compleja. Lo que sí es evidente es que hoy en día vivimos en un entorno más estéril, con estándares de higiene y seguridad alimentaria.\nAdemás, aunque factores como la polución también influyen, lo que intento explicar es que no todo se reduce a la exposición a un alérgeno específico. Por ejemplo, la exposición a ciertas bacterias, como las presentes en heces de animales, podría protegerte contra alergias alimentarias o incluso contra la alergia a un ciprés, a pesar de que nunca hayas estado en contacto directo con ese árbol. Vamos, que te intento explicar la \"hipótesis de la higiene\" porque claramente no la estás comprendiendo, no estoy diciendo que sea algo más que una hipótesis, o que no haya otros factores involucrados.\nQue por cierto, soy alérgico y médico especialista (aunque no alergista). Y no lo digo como argumento de autoridad, sino para señalar que dices tonterías.\n[#54](c54#c-54) Vaya, hoy eres médico especialista, el año pasado eras ingeniero... Por cómo le hablas a la gente de la web deberías estar baneado ( [@admin](/user/admin) ), sinceramente, por lo que he visto en todos los posts que me han salido en varias búsquedas.\nTe doy un pin porque me has hecho perder 10 minutos en mirar un poco a ver qué clase de persona eres. Al ignore por imbécil profundo.\nhttps://www.meneame.net/search?q=ingeniero&w=comments&h=&o=date&u=elmakina\nespana-logra-67-millones-fondos-europeos-desplegar-3-437-puntos/c018#c-18 [#54](c54#c-54) lo que dice [#50](c50#c-50) es totalmente cierto. No se por qué no lo quiere entender nadie porque es el factor más obvio.\nSi matamos a todos los pelirrojos antes del año de vida, apuesto a que el porcentaje de pelirrojos decrece en las próximas décadas.\nSi hoy dejamos de tratara a todas las personas alérgicas y dejamos que se mueran, veréis como el porcentaje de alérgicos decrece.\nY por completar, si empiezan a limitarse las visas, se cierran fronteras, aumentan los aranceles enormemente…las alergias también bajarán.\nQue los expertos en inmunología o medicina en general se enfoquen en su área es normal, porque tampoco sirve de mucho la explicación obvia de arriba (que sería la de los expertos en “lógica”). Lo único que se puede hacer es buscar tratamientos.\n[#60](c60#c-60) No es cierto. No digo que no pueda contribuír de alguna manera, pero no pasa de ser una simplificación que no es acorde a los datos.\nY es que la prevalencia de las alergias en general ha estado incrementándose consistentemente, incluyendo poblaciones donde el acceso a la atención médica es limitado.\nTambién se ha observado esto para alergias que no son potencialmente mortales, como polvo, pelo de animales, polen, látex.\nAdicionalmente, se observa que niños en entornos rurales sufren significativamente menos alergias, a pesar de no haber diferencias de supervivencia.\nEtc.\nVamos, que lo que decís es una idea peregrina, que podría tener algo de sentido en principio pero no se sostiene en los datos disponibles.\n[#1](c1#c-1) Con los que trabajan en restauración es la hostia. Cuando les dices que no puedes tener X porque tienes alergia, intolerancia o eres celíaco siempre te dicen \"bah, pero si es muy poquito\", \"no lleva casi nada, no pasa nada\" o \"por una vez no pasa nada\" es de traca...\nNo entienden que si tienes algo de eso, tiene que ser 0. Un poquito, por muy poquito que sea te provoca la reacción. 0 significa 0, nada, tiene que ser 0. En mi caso tengo suerte de no tener alergias e intolerancias pero tengo amigos que si. Y no terminan de entenderlo a pesar de ser supuestamente profesionales de ello.\n[#20](c20#c-20) [#1](c1#c-1) Mi padre es alérgico a las almendras. Hace unos años fuimos a un restaurante y, como siempre, se lo dijimos al personal. Pidió de postre helado de avellana. Al llegar el helado en cuestión, mi madre lo probó (siempre lo hace por si acaso) y era de turrón. Se lo dijimos a la dueña y nos dijo: \"corazón, no me quedaba de avellana y te he puesto de turrón que está más rico\".\nEn serio que la gente es imbécil.\n[#51](c51#c-51) Dime que lo de \"corazón\" es de cosecha propia, porque si lo dijo la dueña encima es como recochineo o trataros como a críos caprichosos que no quieren algo por capricho.\n[#51](c51#c-51) Ahí entiendo que lo pedisteis de avellana pero no le dijisteis que era alérgico a las almendras ¿no? Si no es una cagada por parte de la dueña que aunque no lo hizo con mala fe, podría haberos dicho que no quedaba y si queríais otro...\n[#1](c1#c-1) Pero a la niña de la noticia le dió la alergia de repente? Es decir, si era alérgica de antes deberían haberlo sabido y prevenido. Es normal que te de una alergia tan fuerte de repente? No empieza gradualmente hasta ir haciéndose mas grave con el tiempo al exponerte a los alérgenos?\nLa niña, de 10 años, se toma un producto lácteo en casa de los abuelos.\nTeniendo un sobrino alérgico a los frutos secos no quiero imaginar la tragedia que es que te dejen al cargo de un chiquillo y metas la pata hasta ese extremo.\nHay que enseñar al niño a no comer nada que no conozca y a los adultos a poner la adrenalina. En mi familia lo hacemos así porque mi hermana está paranoica, pero es obvio que tiene motivos para ello.\n[#5](c5#c-5) he conocido algún niño alérgico y se niegan a tomar nada sino están sus padres delante, bien enseñados.\n[#8](c8#c-8) Si se va una semana a casa de los abuelos \"sin estar sus padres delante\" y se niega a tomar nada, se muere de inanición\n[#8](c8#c-8) Mi sobrino es alérgico al huevo desde que nació. Tuvo un shock bastante importante y sus padres van siempre con una jeringa de adrenalina. Ahora tiene 3 años y antes de comer nada pregunta si tiene huevo. Si le dices que sí, pierde el interés y se va a otra cosa. Trabajazo de sus padres, pero aún así me sorprende lo claro que tiene ese tema.\n[#11](c11#c-11) Mi hermana es alérgica desde siempre al melocotón, hasta el punto de hincharse como un globo sólo de estar cerca de alguno. Desde que era bien pequeña (5 años o así), debido al miedo, siempre preguntaba si le ofrecian cualquier cosa de frutas (tipo sugus, yogures, caramelos) que pudiera contener algo de melocotón. Lo que no entiendo es como una niña de 10 años no tenía más suspicacia y control sobre lo que tomaba si tenía una alergia tan fuerte.\n[#5](c5#c-5) No creo que le dieran un producto lácteo. Pero sí seguramente el típico dulce que no piensas que tiene proteína de la leche y la cagan a lo grande. Como peor no se puede.\nQué dolor tiene que estar pasando la familia. Pero los abuelos no quiero ni imaginar.\n[#24](c24#c-24) A ver, cuñao, lo que digo es totalmente válido sea lactosa o caseina, el problema es que le puede dar un ataque por comer por ejemplo chorizo\nhttps://cuidateplus.marca.com/familia/bebe/2018/12/09/consejos-comer-alergia-proteina-leche-168440.html\nLo has entendido ya, o no?\nLa proteína de la leche está presente en un montón de alimentos procesados, como por ejemplo embutidos. Teniendo un niño con una alergia tan potente hay que mirar SIEMPRE los ingredientes de cualquier alimento que vaya a tomar. Es verdad que no es fácil, yo soy alérgico a los cacahuetes y recuerdo varios viajes al hospital de pequeño, sobre todo cuando viajaba a Francia a visitar a mi familia, ya que ahí antes se usaba mucho el aceite de cacahuete en productos como patatas fritas, o por comer algo con trazas. Otras ni siquiera es necesario comer nada, en algún cumpleaños en el que otros niños los habían comido, simplemente por jugar y tocar algo que hubieran tocado los demás, como el mando de la play, era suficiente para desencadenar una reacción.\n[#42](c42#c-42) Buah lo del stock por contacto siempre me ha impactado. Como el chico que murió por la barra de cacao de su novia. Es de estas cosas que cuesta imaginarme algo tan inofensivo haciendo tanto daño...\n\"quitale las cosas que te dan alergia y te lo comes\"\n\"Tiene muy poco, no pasa nada\"\n\"Cuando estés más tranquila eso de alergias se te pasa\"\n\"Es que eres muy rara comiendo\"\n\"Creo que no tiene, no lo sé\"\nY así, infinidad de comentarios cuando pregunto por ingredientes. Respuestas tanto de familiares hasta camareros.\nNo sé sabe el daño que puede hacer\nSaliendo del tema de este caso, hay comunidades autónomas donde ya hay tratamiento vacunal contra las alergias pediátricas.\nLuego está la opción privada.\nMi mujer es alérgica a un mónton de cosas (frutos secos, cacahuetes y otras legumbres, piña, kiwi, patatas, marisco). Ir de restaurante o bares es ir a pasar un mal rato, porque en general la gente no es consciente del daño que puede hacer la contaminación cruzada. E ir de visita o a comer con amigos o familiares también es deporte de alto riesgo, pero por suerte todos son conscientes del peligro y aceptan que o declinemos ir o que a veces llevemos nuestra comida, porque es lo más sencillo para todos.\n[#12](c12#c-12) Bastante tendran ya los abuelos con lo que ha pasado, la pena inmensa por perder una nieta, y encima la culpabilidad. Pobre familia. Pobre niña, D.E.P.\n[#18](c18#c-18) Está claro que no debía de ser tan obvio porque si no los abuelos no se lo habrían dado, y una niña alérgica de 10 años, sabría perfectamente que no puede tomar lacteos.\n[#18](c18#c-18) o tenía reacciones menores a la leche, incluso ausencia de reacciones, y de pronto hay en casa un lácteo crudo, el alergeno que es traza o inexistente en leche procesada es un porcentaje de valor entero en ese producto.\nMuchísima gente puede ser alérgica a la leche cruda y no lo sabe por ser un consumo residual.\nSupongo que a lo que era alèrgica es a la lactosa, y deben haber cientos de alimentos que no parecen làcteos pero llevan lactosa, sobretodo procesados. Los celìacos tienen el mismo problema, pero creo que las consecuencias no son tan bestias\n[#19](c19#c-19) literalmente del artículo “ La proteína de la leche de vaca no debe ser confundida con la lactosa, un azúcar natural al que muchas personas son intolerantes en diversos grados, pero que lo más habitual es que no genere cuadros más graves que diarreas o desarreglos intestinales.” amigo, está bien confundirse y aceptarlo, no es una vergüenza, lo que no está bien es faltar al respeto para defender tu postura.\n[#14](c14#c-14) A la lactosa no se le es alérgico puesto que es un azúcar. La lactosa en todo caso causa intolerancia (dispepsia, flatulencias, alteraciones en el tránsito intestinal y heces, etc. vaya, problemas a lo largo del tracto digestivo fruto del sobrecrecimiento bacteriano (SIBO, LIBO)).\nCasi todas las alergias dietéticas son causadas por proteínas. La leche tiene muchas y pueden causar desde un daño leve/moderado (como por ejemplo la caseina en cierta gente con autoinmunidad) hasta la muerte (alérgicos a ciertas fracción de las proteína de la leche). Por lo general las caseínas suele ser mucho más reactivas/problemáticas que el suero.\nLa celiaquía no es ni una intolerancia (intolerancia no celíaca al gluten), ni una alergia (alergia al trigo), sino una enfermedad autoinmune (enteropatía por sensibilidad al gluten) que como mínimo daña el intestino delgado (lo cierto es que es bastante sistémico).",

    "text": "Рубрики\nМЕНЮ\nКравцев Сергей\nРоссия пытается наращивать ракетно-дроновые удары по Украине. Причем невозможно предугадать, какой город агрессор может выбрать следующим для удара. Что больше всего настораживает в планах врага? Сможет ли он запускать сразу 1000 и более \"Шахедов\" по Украине в сутки? Издание \"Комментарии\" разбиралось в этих вопросах, изучив мнения экспертов.\nДроны-камикадзе. Фото: из открытых источников\nБывший спикер Генштаба ВСУ Владислав Селезнев напомнил в эфире общенационального телемарафона предупреждение руководителя разведки Кирилла Буданова о том, что РФ будет договариваться с Северной Кореей о производстве \"Шахедов\". Эксперт считает, что это серьезный вызов.\nПо мнению Селезнева, в последнее время армия РФ использует тактику волнообразных атак. То есть в некоторые дни они уменьшают интенсивность применения дронов, а в этот промежуток времени продолжают производить, накапливать их, а потом используют их по максимуму: 200, 300 и более.\nВладислав Селезнев продолжает, причем тактика действий российской армии в определенной степени изменилась. Россияне выбирают не огромное количество объектов по всей Украине, а два-три населенных пункта, по которым начинают бить.\nАвиационный эксперт Валерий Романенко отметил, что пока что не стоит ожидать, что россияне могут ударить в сутки по Украине 1000 и более дронов. Россияне пока вряд ли способны производить такое количество дронов даже на двух своих заводах.\nПо данным эксперта, противник не способен производить более трех тысяч дронов в месяц, а именно такое количество нужно, чтобы ежедневно запускать по Украине 100 дронов.\nЧитайте также на портале \"Комментарии\" — Кабмин запускает эксперимент: кого будут привлекать для борьбы с российским дронами.",
