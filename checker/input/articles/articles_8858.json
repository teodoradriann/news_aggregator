    "title": "Chelsea's James: Fernandez situation could be 'problem' - ESPN",
    "text": "[Reece James](http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/189007/reece-james) said the controversy surrounding [Enzo Fernández](http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/285450/enzo-fernandez) could cause a \"problem\" within the [Chelsea](/football/team?id=363) camp and believes the situation can only be fully resolved in face-to-face talks with his teammates. Fernandez is currently on holiday after winning the Copa America with [Argentina](/football/team?id=202). During the celebrations after the win he posted a video in which the midfielder, along with several other players, sang a racist and derogatory about the heritage of some [France](/football/team?id=478) players. [France filed a complaint after the video surfaced](/football/story/_/id/40575987/france-federation-legal-complaint-racist-argentina-chants-copa) and Chelsea defender [Wesley Fofana](http://espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/270190/wesley-fofana) labelled the video \"uninhibited racism\" and the club issued a [statement condemning Fernandez's actions](/football/story/_/id/40579715/chelsea-condemn-enzo-fernandez-discriminatory-chant), while also citing the incident as \"as an opportunity to educate.\" Despite issuing a public apology, Fernandez is still facing internal investigations by both the Blues and FIFA. The 23-year-old is due to join up with the Chelsea squad on Monday as they continue their preseason tour of the United States. In an exclusive interview with ESPN on Tuesday, Chelsea captain James said the situation could have an impact on team spirit: \"Of course, there's always the factor where it doesn't sit right with people when there could be a problem. \"But until the day comes where everyone's together and in a room together, I don't know, but I hope things can be resolved smoothly and we can move forward with the season. \"It's a really difficult situation. There's no room for racism or discrimination in football. I think he quickly put his hand up and acknowledged he'd done wrong and apologized to his teammates, the club and the rest of the people that were offended. I think that was probably the best he could have done in that situation. \"I spoke to him a bit, but it was hard because we were on different time zones. [It was] just a general chat really. His views on what happened and him trying to explain his situation and how things happened.\" On a personal front, James said he believes he has finally put his injury problems behind him after suffering a series of fitness issues including hamstring surgery, which ruled him out for five months last season. The defender made just 26 [Premier League](/football/league/_/name/ENG.1) appearances in the past two seasons, but he said: \"There were times before where I would think, 'Can I do this? Can I do that?' When you have that doubt, you don't feel full confidence. Most recently, I've definitely felt like that fear's gone and I feel free again.\" James operated as a full-back stepping into midfield in Enzo Maresca's first game in charge during Wednesday's [2-2 draw](/football/report/_/gameId/700486) with Wrexham in Santa Clara, California, and he said the new position could suit his game after spending the 2018-19 campaign on loan at Wigan as a midfielder. \"I played midfield before when I was younger and then when I was on loan I played midfield as well,\" James said. \"So it's quite similar to that. It's quite clear. Usually one of the defenders come inside into the middle and we play from there pretty much. \"The role this season will be a lot different for many players so trying to understand the role as early as possible will help the team the most.\" Chelsea continues their preseason with a game against [Celtic](/football/team?id=256) on July 27 before playing their final match of the U.S. tour against [Arsenal](/football/team?id=359) on July 31.",

    "text": "Cooper Kupp declarou na última terça-feira (19) que tinha muitas dúvidas após ter sido dispensado pelo Los Angeles Rams , mas o novo wide receiver do Seattle Seahawks disse que mal pode esperar para jogar pelo time de sua cidade natal.\n“Tem sido difícil, com toda a honestidade, tem sido muito difícil e frustrante. É uma situação difícil. Eu disse que sempre imaginei que terminaria a minha carreira (com os Rams), mas esse não era o plano que Deus tinha para mim e minha família”, disse o jogador, durante a apresentação, de acordo com Brady Henderson , da ESPN americana.\nKupp assinou com os Seahawks na semana passada por três anos e US$ 45 milhões após ser dispensado pelo rival divisional, onde passou suas primeiras oito temporadas na NFL.\n“Estamos muito animados com o que o futuro reserva aqui em Seattle”, disse o novo reforço, acrescentando que ingressar nos Seahawks parece um “momento de ciclo completo” para ele.\nO jogador de 31 anos está entre os cinco melhores da história dos Rams quando o assunto é recepção. Ele registrou 634 recepções, 7.776 jardas de recepção e 57 touchdowns em 104 aparições na NFL.\nEscolha de terceira rodada do Draft de 2017, Kupp viveu uma temporada histórica em 2021, quando venceu a ‘tríplice coroa’, registrando o maior número de jardas, recepções e touchdowns entre os recebedores da liga. O desempenho rendeu o prêmio de MVP e título do Super Bowl LVI contra o Cincinatti Bengals, no entanto, as lesões limitaram o WR a 12 ou menos jogos em cada das últimas três temporadas.\n“Eu ainda me vejo jogando esse jogo em um nível muito alto. Eu me vejo como um jogador em ascensão. Qualquer narrativa que seja diferente, eu acho, é apenas alguém que não assistiu a muitos filmes”, Kupp acrescentou, de acordo com a NFL Network .\nEm Seattle, Kupp se junta ao jovem Jaxon Smith-Njigba como um dos principais alvos, depois que a franquia negociou DK Metcalf com o Pittsburgh Steelers e dispensou Tyler Lockett no início deste ano.",

    "text": "MONTREAL — A 19-year-old man has been charged in the firebombing of a Montreal-area synagogue in December.\nMohamed Ilyess Akodad faces two arson-related charges, two counts of attempted arson, one count of destruction of property and one count of possession of incendiary material.\nThe charges relate to a Dec. 18 fire at the Congregation Beth Tikvah in a suburb of Montreal, which caused minor damage to the synagogue.\nPolice at the time reported broken glass and damage to the door of the synagogue, as well as smoke damage, and a smashed glass door at the nearby offices of Federation CJA, a Jewish community group.\nThe incident in Dollard-des-Ormeaux, Que., was widely condemned, including by then prime minister Justin Trudeau, who called it \"a vile antisemitic attack against Montreal’s Jewish community.\"\nAkodad pleaded not guilty during a virtual appearance at the Montreal courthouse on Wednesday, and is scheduled to appear again on Thursday to discuss next steps.\nThe Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs welcomed news of the arrest.\n\"Now, it is up to prosecutors to responsibly proceed with this case focused on maximizing its deterrent effect,\" said Eta Yudin, the organization's vice-president for Quebec \"It must be made clear that the hateful targeting of the Jewish community has serious consequences.\"\nMontreal police say the suspect was arrested in the Montreal borough of Anjou, and investigators seized evidence during a search of a home.\nThey say the investigation is ongoing and anyone with information is invited to contact police.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published April 9, 2025.\nThe Canadian Press",
