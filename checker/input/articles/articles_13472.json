    "text": "Chris Caners, general manager of Toronto’s [Solar Share](https://solarbonds.ca/) renewable energy co-operative, is talking to me about solar power’s many virtues. He smiles and his whole face comes to life. He clearly loves this technology. “Solar is an amazing electricity generation mechanism because you can literally do it anywhere,” he says. “So, you avoid things like transmission losses because … you’re generating the power where you’re consuming it.” He also speaks with exuberance about solar’s affordability. When he joined Solar Share in 2016, solar was 75 cents per watt. Now it’s closer to 30 cents – less than half. “So, it’s pretty incredible,” he says. Caners explains that research and development and mass production in China are key factors in solar’s cost reduction. He’s looked at the price of various energy sources and has no hesitation saying that “industrial solar and wind — the big, big solar and wind — are the cheapest by quite a ways.” The cost of solar is lower but it’s also stabler. “You don’t have the volatility of operational cost like [with other] fuels,” Caners says. “If we have to rely on uranium or gas or coal… those are international markets or continental markets, and the prices go up and down. Whereas for solar, you know, it lasts for 25 years and there’s no fuel for it other than the sun.” The cost of solar is lower but it’s also stabler. “You don’t have the volatility of operational cost like [with other] fuels,” Caners says. “If we have to rely on uranium or gas or coal… those are international markets or continental markets, and the prices go up and down. Whereas for solar, you know, it lasts for 25 years and there’s no fuel for it other than the sun.” Solar Share was founded in 2010 and now owns and operates more than 50 solar energy projects in Ontario. It raises capital by selling “solar bonds” to Ontarians — at a minimum of $1,000 each — that pay a fixed interest rate, typically three to five per cent a year. The co-op has some $80 million in investments. (Full transparency: I’m a member myself!) Playing devil’s advocate, I ask Caners if organizations like his can operate on a scale sufficient to address the climate crisis. Solar Share is one of the country’s largest renewable co-ops, yet it has only about 2,000 members. Caners says there’s no reason in principle why co-ops must be small and, with supportive government policy, they could become large, powerful organizations. “It is possible for co-ops to scale [up]; and if we look at places around the world where cooperatives have been successful, I think you’ll see [they] had to have … support from government. But they can certainly be huge players.” He cites, in particular, the huge number of co-ops in Germany. “It is very common for German citizens to be part of an energy co-op and to buy their electricity from co-ops,” he says. Of course, this large group of residents profiting from renewables is a powerful voting block that can protect these projects from hostile governments — a crucial lesson for us in Canada. If we want wind and solar to thrive, we need to ensure the benefits of these power sources accrue to many people. If we want wind and solar to thrive, we need to ensure the benefits of these power sources accrue to many people. Those benefits include local employment. Caners tells me solar energy creates a whole array of good jobs, some of them not immediately obvious. “[Consider] project development. Well, there’s a lot of work in trying to find suitable sites for solar. You need to have people who are going and talking to people to find land and do interconnection,” he says. “Then there’s all the [work] once you get a site and you have the agreement of the landlords and neighbours. Then you have the engineering, procurement and construction. So that’s a huge number of jobs. Once that’s done, then we have operations and maintenance [on the solar panels].” Our conversation turns to the federal government’s proposed clean electricity regulations, which, over time, will largely end gas- and coal-fired power generation. The David Suzuki Foundation believes the phase-out can be accomplished by 2035 but some politicians are skeptical. What’s Caners’ view? Beyond the mid-2030s do we need fossils on the grid? “It’s clear that we don’t. We’ve seen lots of examples. California is generating all of its power over time from 100 per cent renewables. They’re huge and they’ve done it. Costa Rica has done it. I believe the U.K., even for different periods of time, has done it. … I remember 20 or 30 years ago people saying ‘Oh, there’s no way we can put more solar on the grid than 15 per cent or 10 per cent. It’s just not possible.’ Okay, well it is possible. I don’t buy the argument that we can’t do it.” “It’s clear that we don’t. We’ve seen lots of examples.

It’s just not possible.’ Okay, well it is possible. I don’t buy the argument that we can’t do it.” As our conversation draws to a conclusion, I ask Caners what’s next for his organization. He says he’d like the co-op to participate in something called “virtual net metering.” “So right now, we can’t set up a solar project and sell our power to you,” he says. “We can just sell our electricity to the government. What we want to do is be able to set up a solar project and then sell the kilowatt hours to people who want to buy kilowatt hours from Solar Share. … I think that would be very exciting and it would allow us to deploy more solar. I’d love that! Virtual net metering is the thing that I’m probably most keen on as a path forward.” Related Projects Always grounded in sound evidence, the David Suzuki Foundation empowers people to take action in their communities on the environmental challenges we collectively face.",

    "title": "Dennis P. Farrell, 73, banker and volunteer who found joy in helping people",
    "text": "Dennis Farrell had a 44-year career in banking, but it wasn’t money that attracted him to the world of finance. “He was in it for the people,” his son Michael said, “for the comradery and for the opportunity to offer other people opportunities. It also was an opportunity to wear really nice ties.” In retirement, he became a Eucharistic minister in hospitals and did other volunteering for the same reasons. “He treated his volunteer work like a job ... in a good way,” his son said. “He took it very seriously. People always remarked about how well-dressed he was. They thought he was a doctor.” He pursued a full schedule of volunteer work until shortly before his unexpected death Dec. 28 in Strong Memorial Hospital, Rochester. He was 73. Born in Buffalo, the second of 11 children, Dennis Patrick Farrell was the son of Neil and Ella Collins Farrell. His father owned and operated Farrell’s Dairy in South Buffalo and was the subject of a chapter in Tim Russert’s book, “Wisdom of Our Fathers: Lessons and Letters from Daughters and Sons.” He attended St. Teresa’s School, was a 1968 graduate of what was then Bishop Timon High School and earned a bachelor’s degree in American history from Canisius College, now Canisius University. While attending college, Mr. Farrell took a job at Liberty Bank, and became a teller. For a while he also wrote an employee newsletter, which led him to interview Jeane McFillin, who worked at another branch. They were married in 1972. Mr. Farrell joined Bank of New York the following year and held various branch positions. In the late 1970s, he became a branch manager in South Buffalo. He went to the former Marine Midland Bank in 1981 and managed branches in Hamburg and Williamsville. When it became HSBC Bank, he continued with the company as a commercial credit officer, district executive and regional credit executive. After Mr. Farrell retired in 2012, he threw himself into volunteering, assisting at the St. Vincent de Paul Society, St. Luke’s Mission of Mercy, the Response to Love Center and Meals on Wheels. Inspired by the examples of two of his aunts, who were Sisters of Mercy, he became a Eucharistic minister at Mercy Hospital in South Buffalo, Sisters Hospital and Buffalo General Medical Center, chatting with patients and offering Communion several days a week. He took master’s degree classes in pastoral studies and counseling. “He would talk to anybody about anything,” his son Michael said. “He was always interested in people’s backgrounds and he would go out of his way to remember things about their lives.” A longtime Hamburg resident, he was active in a series of Catholic parishes as a lector and religious educator, including St. Ambrose, Our Lady of Perpetual Help, SS. Peter and Paul in Hamburg, St. Francis of Assisi, St. Mary of the Lake and St. John Paul II. “As a family,” his son said, “we were notorious church-hoppers.” At St. Ambrose in 1986, Mr. Farrell and his wife were among families who hosted children from Colombia for a year. When their guest’s orphanage closed, he stayed on and they legally adopted him. Mr. Farrell later visited Bogota and befriended several members of his adopted son’s extended family. Proud of his Irish heritage, Mr. Farrell displayed a large shamrock on his home and, as a member of the Blackthorn Club, marched every year in Buffalo’s St. Patrick’s Day Parade. He was a devoted fan of the Buffalo Bills and Notre Dame football and enjoyed literature, film and music, ranging from Nat King Cole to the Clancy Brothers. In addition to his wife, who worked at Wanakah Landscaping and Lockwood’s Greenhouses in Hamburg, survivors include two sons, Alfredo and Michael; two daughters, Katharine Bair and Mary Cullinane; four brothers, Tim, Neil, Joseph and Martin; five sisters, Mary Farrell, Joanne Oscadal, Colleen Holman, Maureen Farrell and Patricia Farrell; and eight grandchildren. A Mass of Christian Burial was offered Jan. 4 in St. John Paul II Church, Lakeview. Email [danderson@buffnews.com](mailto:danderson@buffnews.com).",

    "title": "Spain’s Unparalleled Destination: Córdoba’s October Weather Reaches A Stunning 27°C",
    "text": "The Andalusian region in Spain boasts numerous stunning destinations, each one captivating enough to enchant visitors.\nSeville is famous for its vibrant energy and breathtaking architecture, while Malaga offers stunning beaches, a wealth of cultural experiences, and a lively nightlife. Granada features the iconic Alhambra, a spectacular palace and fortress celebrated as one of the most significant examples of Islamic architecture.\nHowever, amidst this remarkable collection of cities lies Córdoba—a delightful destination that frequently goes unnoticed.\nCórdoba, recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, boasts a deep historical legacy, with its origins tracing back to Roman times in 152 BC. Visitors can still explore traces of its rich past throughout the city today.\nIn the 10th century, Córdoba served as the capital of the Moorish Empire during the ‘Islamic Golden Age.’ During this period, the city thrived as a hub for art, science, and philosophy, establishing itself as one of the most sophisticated cities in Europe.\nToday, Córdoba is frequently overlooked in favor of more famous Andalusian locations. However, those who venture here will discover breathtaking architecture and a vibrant cultural landscape, featuring the impressive Mezquita-Cathedral, the historic Roman bridge, and the charming alleys of the Jewish quarter.\nCórdoba has even earned a spot in Skyscanner’s annual list of the most sought-after destinations for 2025.\nIt ranked fifth among locations that have experienced the most significant rise in searches in the past year, joining other remarkable places like Tromsø in Norway and Siem Reap in Cambodia.\nWhile we’ve already highlighted Córdoba’s appeal, here’s everything you should know before you finalize your travel plans to this Andalusian gem.\nGetting to Córdoba: Your Travel Guide\nThe closest airport to Córdoba is in Seville, approximately 130 kilometers (81 miles) southwest of the city.\nFrom Seville, travelers have various options for reaching Córdoba. Renting a car allows for a scenic drive of about 90 minutes. Alternatively, a direct train ride takes between 45 minutes to an hour.\nSeveral airlines, including Ryanair, EasyJet, and British Airways, offer direct flights from London to Seville. The flight duration is roughly two hours and 45 minutes, with ticket prices starting at around £45 in late October, according to Skyscanner.\nAnother option is to fly into Malaga Airport, located about 165 kilometers (103 miles) from Córdoba. Direct flights from London to Malaga take approximately two hours and 40 minutes and can be more budget-friendly, with fares starting at just £20 in October, according to Skyscanner.\nThe journey from Malaga to Córdoba is comparable in time; driving takes around one hour and 45 minutes, while direct train services cover the distance in roughly 50 minutes.\nCórdoba’s Climate: What to Expect\nThe ideal time to visit Córdoba is in the spring (April to early June) or during the autumn months (September to October), when the weather is mild and perfect for exploring the city in comfort.\nAs an inland city in southern Spain, Córdoba experiences more intense temperatures compared to coastal regions, with its summers often reaching scorching and uncomfortable levels.\nFor this reason, it’s best to avoid visiting between July and August, as temperatures often climb above 40°C.\nOctober is an excellent alternative, offering cooler but still warm weather, with temperatures reaching up to 27°C—ideal for those looking to soak up some late-season sun.\nWinter in Córdoba is also enjoyable, with mild temperatures ranging from 10-16°C and fewer tourists, making it perfect for those seeking a quieter experience away from the crowds.\nTop Things to Do in Córdoba\nCórdoba, with its UNESCO World Heritage designation, is rich in history and culture, offering countless attractions for visitors.\nNo trip to the city would be complete without exploring the Mezquita Cathedral, hailed by Lonely Planet as one of the “world’s most remarkable examples of Islamic architecture.”\nInitially constructed as a mosque in the 8th century, the Mezquita was transformed into a Christian cathedral in the 13th century.\nIt showcases distinctive horseshoe arches with red and white stripes, a prayer hall adorned with carved columns, and an exquisitely designed mihrab.\nWith over 23,300 reviews on Tripadvisor, the Mezquita boasts a five-star rating, with visitors frequently describing it as “magnificent.”\nCórdoba is also home to numerous Roman landmarks, with the most striking being the Roman Bridge of Córdoba. Initially constructed in the 1st century BC during the reign of Emperor Augustus, it remains an iconic symbol of the city’s ancient history.\nThough it has seen numerous renovations throughout its history, much of the Roman Bridge’s original structure remains preserved. Visitors on Tripadvisor have praised it as both “marvelous” and “fascinating,” highlighting its timeless appeal.",
