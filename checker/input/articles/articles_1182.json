    "text": "On the occasion of celebrating her 500th robot-assisted weight-loss surgery at Conemaugh Memorial Medical Center, Dr. D’Arcy Duke reflected on her 20-year career as a Johnstown surgeon. “I am honored to have reached this significant milestone in my career,” Duke said. “Surrounded by a great team with brilliant minds, I am grateful to continue to provide our patients with the most advanced, minimally invasive options resulting in faster recovery and better overall outcomes.” Duke has become a trailblazer for robotic-assisted surgery at Conemaugh, using the technology for weight-loss procedures, including gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy and revisional bariatric surgery, as well as hernia repair, and acid reflux and gallbladder surgery. Minimally invasive robotic surgery procedures are performed through small incisions. “The da Vinci robot allows surgeons to perform complex operations with more precision, flexibility and control than is possible with conventional techniques,” Duke said. “The robot translates the surgeon’s hand motions into smaller, more precise movements.” ‘Wanted to give back’ She earned her medical degree from Temple University School of Medicine in Philadelphia and completed her residency at Boston University before returning to Johnstown. Duke said her exposure to the larger university-related medical systems made her appreciate the expertise at Memorial. “I grew up around here,” Duke said. “I knew what the hospital had to offer and I wanted to give back to the community.” Duke’s medical career began in 2002 when she joined the surgery team at Conemaugh and became a colleague of her father, surgeon Dr. Bruce E. Duke, who joined the hospital in 1971. After two years in Johnstown, she completed fellowship training in bariatric surgery at UPMC in Pittsburgh and became a fellow of the American College of Surgeons. “It was cutting-edge in 2004,” she said. “I was able to do that and expand that in this area.” Family ties Bruce Duke has remained in the Johnstown area after retiring in 2011. His daughter said he enjoys the region and he likes to fish. D’Arcy Duke said that as a child, she didn’t intend to follow her father’s footsteps, and her father did not push her or her sister toward any career path. “He was not involved in pressuring us,” D’Arcy Duke said. “Whatever we were good at, we could go in that direction.” Randy Griffith is a reporter for The Tribune-Democrat.

    "title": "GPay, PhonePe Will Not Allow Users To Send Payment Requests From October 1: Here's Why",
    "text": "A key UPI feature is soon vanishing. UPI person-to-person (P2P) 'collect requests' will no longer be allowed starting October 1, as directed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). This means users on GPay, PhonePe, and other UPI apps will not be allowed to send payment requests to friends and families.\nUPI’s P2P collect feature, commonly used to request money from friends or split bills, has increasingly become a target for fraudsters, who send deceptive payment requests that trick users into unwittingly authorizing transfers. Although NPCI had lowered the per-transaction limit to Rs. 2,000 and capped daily usage, scams persisted.\nNPCI has therefore decided to eliminate the feature altogether to safeguard users and uphold UPI's trust and security standards.\nNPCI is disabling person-to-person collect requests in a phased manner. However, merchant collect requests, used by platforms like Flipkart, Amazon, Swiggy, and IRCTC, will remain active. These still require user approval and UPI PIN entry to complete payments.\nFurthermor, users can still send payments via 'Scan & Pay' or by entering the recipient’s UPI ID/number and authorizing with their PIN.\nWith the deactivation of this feature, GPay or PhonePe users will no longer be able to send 'please pay me' UPI requests to friends or peers, after October 1. To pay someone, users must initiate transactions, such as scanning a QR code, entering a UPI ID, or using contact selection within the UPI app.",

    "text": "Bangladesh: A Precipitous Descent [Sharif Hussain Khan](https://m.greaterkashmir.com/author/sharifhussainkhan/765) The specter of instability once again looms large over Bangladesh. A nation that, under Sheikh Hasina, seemed to chart a steady course, now finds itself at a perilous crossroads. The echoes of the 2009 Bangladesh Rifles mutiny, a stark reminder of the fragility of power, reverberate through the current upheaval. Hasina’s ascent in 2009 was meteoric. Backed by a surging tide of popular support, particularly among women and youth, she navigated a political landscape marred by military intervention. The BDR mutiny, a brazen challenge to her authority, was quelled, but the seeds of discontent were sown. Fifteen years on, the aura of invincibility that once surrounded her dissipated. The democratic spaces that once flourished have constricted. The economy, once a beacon of hope, now casts a long shadow of despair, especially among the disillusioned youth. The recent student protests, met with a heavy fist, were a stark indictment of a regime losing touch with its people. The army, under General Waker-uz-Zaman, finds itself in a complex predicament. Unlike the 2007 coup, when the military was the bulwark against chaos, it is now perceived as a reluctant midwife to a new political order. The appointment of Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus as interim leader is a departure from the usual playbook of military regimes, signaling a recognition of public sentiment. Yet, the army's role remains fraught with challenges. The specter of violence, once again, haunts the nation. The resurgence of extremist elements, coupled with the deep-seated political divisions, threatens to plunge Bangladesh into a vortex of strife. The desecration of national symbols underscore the gravity of the situation. India, a steadfast partner, faces a delicate balancing act. While its development initiatives have endeared it to the Bangladeshi people, it must tread carefully to avoid being caught in the crossfire. The parallels between Bangladesh and Myanmar are striking. Both nations, after periods of relative stability, are now grappling with the consequences of authoritarian rule. The international community, including India, must remain vigilant and support the aspirations of the Bangladeshi people for a democratic, inclusive, and prosperous future. The path ahead is fraught with uncertainty, but the stakes could not be higher. Sharif Hussain Khan, Delhi Based Author & Researcher",
