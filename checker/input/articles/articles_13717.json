    "text": "NUCLEAR WEAPONSA New U.S. Russia, China Nuclear Arms Race Spells Danger Unlike in the Cold War, the United States faces the prospect in the next decade of two peer nuclear adversaries, which will together have twice as many strategic nuclear weapons as it does. While extended nuclear assurance and persuasion have been important factors in the US for a long time, there does not appear to be any widely accepted methodology for reaching a decision on how many weapons are needed for these purposes. Unlike in the Cold War, the United States faces the prospect in the next decade of two peer nuclear adversaries, which will together have twice as many strategic nuclear weapons as it does. According to a senior American official visiting Australia last month, by 2034 China will have as many strategic nuclear weapons as the US does today. So, a decade from now America may be outnumbered by Russia and China combined having over 3,000 strategic nuclear warheads to America’s 1500. Under the terms of the 2018 New START Treaty, Russia and America are each allowed 1550 strategic nuclear warheads and 700 deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles and heavy nuclear bombers. This treaty expires on 5 February 2026. But Russia last year ‘suspended’ its treaty commitments—though it claims it will abide by the numerical limit of 1550 deployed nuclear warheads. The United States and Russia have successfully negotiated strategic nuclear arms reduction talks from the early 1970s until now. At the height of the Cold War, the US nuclear arsenal numbered more than 32,000 weapons and the Soviet arsenal more than 45,000. The two have also withdrawn about 14,000 tactical nuclear weapons from forward deployments in places such as Europe. But the question now arises whether that era of careful, considered—and verifiable—cuts to strategic nuclear capabilities is over. The Russians and the Americans are no longer talking at the political level about these vital issues, although expert talks do continue. And several previous bilateral arms control treaties have been cancelled, including the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, the Theatre Nuclear Forces in Europe Treaty, the Open Skies Agreement, the Conventional Forces in Europe Agreement and others. On 7 June, according to Pranay Vaddi—the special assistant to the president for arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation at the National Security Council—Russia, China and North Korea ‘are all expanding and diversifying their nuclear arsenals at a breakneck speed and showing no interest in arms control.’ Vaddi observed that the last decade has revealed serious cracks in the international pillars of reducing nuclear dangers, the salience of nuclear weapons, and limiting strategic arsenals of the largest nuclear powers.",

    "text": "Myanmar has been embroiled in a devastating conflict for the past three years, resulting in the loss of an estimated 50,000 lives.\nDespite the alarming death toll, this Southeast Asian nation’s war has largely remained under the radar, with minimal global attention or intervention.\nLet’s look into the details of Myanmar’s prolonged and overlooked conflict, shedding light on the humanitarian crisis unfolding far from the spotlight.\nACLED’s Startling Findings\nThe Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED) identifies Myanmar as the world’s most violent conflict.\nAmong the 50 wars it monitors globally, Myanmar stands out with a staggering death toll.\nDeath Toll: 4,000\nACLED’s conservative estimate puts the death toll at 47,000 since the 2021 coup, including 8,000 civilians.\nHowever, a grim possibility looms, with a potential death toll of 59,000, including 2,000 civilian deaths.\nMilitary Attacks Escalate\nMyanmar’s military has launched numerous attacks over the years, with recent increases in rebel-controlled territories further intensifying the violence.\nAndrea Carboni, ACLED’s head of analysis, highlights the growing conflict.\nGovernment Silence\nDespite the escalating conflict, Myanmar’s Information Ministry remains silent regarding the ongoing crisis.\nThis silence has raised concerns and questions about the government’s stance on the violence.\nRebel Gains and UN’s Alarming Stats\nIn late 2022, an alliance of insurgent groups made significant gains against the junta’s forces.\nThe United Nations reports that approximately 2.3 million people have been displaced by the war, adding to the humanitarian crisis.\nGlobal Neglect\nMyanmar’s conflict has garnered significantly less global attention compared to high-profile conflicts in Ukraine or Gaza.\nWestern governments and activists have largely remained silent on the issue, despite the escalating violence and suffering.\nResilient Myanmar Citizens\nAmid adversity, Myanmar’s people have displayed remarkable resilience.\nThey have continued their resistance campaign from within the country, providing a glimmer of hope for weakening the military’s grip in some regions.\nHuman Rights Abuses Continue\nMyanmar’s economy is in shambles, and the military junta faces accusations of mass killings, arbitrary detentions, crimes against humanity, and war crimes.\nHuman rights abuses persist, with little international intervention.\nLack of Global Awareness\nGoogle Trends data reveals minimal interest in Myanmar compared to more prominent global conflicts like Ukraine and Gaza.\nGlobal Community’s Ignorance and Hypocrisy\nThinzar Shunlei Yi, advocacy coordinator with the grassroots coalition ACDD told Newsweek, “Day by day, the junta in Myanmar mercilessly slaughters its own people without consequences. The global community, unfortunately, turns a blind eye, giving attention to other urgent conflicts. This isn’t just ‘internal affairs’; it’s a blatant display of ignorance, particularly from hypocritical leaders in our neighboring countries, especially China and Russia.”\nUS Support Under Scrutiny\nThe United States faces growing domestic pressure regarding its support for Ukraine and Israel.\nCritics question both the cost of these involvements and Israel’s conduct in the densely populated Gaza Strip.\nDelegated Diplomacy\nWestern countries have largely delegated diplomatic efforts over Myanmar to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).\nHowever, the junta has remained dismissive of ASEAN’s attempts to address the crisis, further complicating the situation.\nComplex Dynamics\nMyanmar’s complex political landscape hinders traditional diplomatic engagement.\nEngaging with the junta necessitates accepting their terms, contributing to the nation’s isolation from the international community.\nEscalating Risks\nAs the embattled Myanmar army retreats, the risk of worsening conflict grows.\nIncreased reliance on air strikes and shelling raises concerns over civilian casualties and further destabilization.\nA Coup Derails Democracy\nMyanmar’s army seized power following a 2021 coup, disrupting the nation’s tentative experiment with democracy.\nThe junta subsequently sentenced elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi to 27 years in prison on charges that her supporters deem fabricated.\nProlonged State of Emergency\nDespite promises of holding elections, the junta has repeatedly extended the state of emergency.\nGrowing military pressure from various factions within the country fuels the ongoing conflict.\nA Nation in Conflict\nThe International Institute of Strategic Studies’ conflict map illustrates widespread conflict across Myanmar, affecting both urban and rural areas.\nThe National Unity Government and allied forces pledge to persist in their resistance efforts, providing a glimmer of hope amid the ongoing turmoil.\nRead More From The Stock Dork\nRon DeSantis Loses Legal Battle Over District Attorney Suspension Donald Trump Jr Named in Bankruptcy Case of Chinese Billionaire Miles Guo",

    "text": "Right-wing media have lavished praise on embattled Mark Robinson during his NC gubernatorial campaign Right-wing media figures on Robinson: “Not afraid to say what he is thinking, which I think we need more of”; “he’s got spirit, he’s got gusto”; “he’s like a hero of the internet” Published Updated Update (9/19/24): Following the publication of this post, CNN's Andrew Kaczynski and Em Steck [reported](https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/19/politics/kfile-mark-robinson-black-nazi-pro-slavery-porn-forum) that Mark Robinson “made dozens of disturbing comments on porn forum.” The below post has also been updated with additional examples. Republican gubernatorial candidate Mark Robinson is reportedly facing calls to drop out of his race due to an impending bombshell story that could torpedo his candidacy. Some of Robinson's biggest supporters have been prominent right-wing media figures, including people Donald Trump Jr., Dan Bongingo, and Charlie Kirk. Robinson is a [right-wing commentator](https://www.mediamatters.org/nratv/nratv-and-dana-loesch-host-pro-gun-pundit-who-called-parkland-students-silly-little-immature) who became lieutenant governor of North Carolina in [January 2021](https://ballotpedia.org/Mark_Robinson_(North_Carolina)). He has a history of [toxic](https://www.mediamatters.org/crime-and-criminal-justice/north-carolina-lt-gov-mark-robinson-said-mass-shootings-are-karma) [remarks](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/north-carolina-gop-mark-robinson-worst-comments-1234984155/), including about women and [LGBTQ people](https://glaad.org/gap/mark-robinson/). Media Matters previously [uncovered](https://www.mediamatters.org/sexual-harassment-sexual-assault/mark-robinson-claimed-harvey-weinstein-and-bill-cosby-were-victims) that Robinson claimed in 2018 that Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby were victims of a left-wing “plot” to destroy them for their “so-called sexual crimes.” Robinson also called on his followers to “stand up against” the supposed “plot to build up a climate of fear, to shut people's mouths.” Media Matters also [reported](https://www.mediamatters.org/crime-and-criminal-justice/north-carolina-lt-gov-mark-robinson-said-mass-shootings-are-karma) that he said mass shootings are “karma” for allowing abortion. Despite his well-known history of extremist remarks, Robinson has gotten support from numerous Republicans. That list includes former President Donald Trump, who [endorsed](https://apnews.com/article/north-carolina-donald-trump-endorsement-governor-cf9092cc8c10d0f2106aacedc63fd8af) him by claiming he’s “Martin Luther King on steroids.” Since Robinson began running for governor last year, numerous right-wing media figures have endorsed him with strong praise. Here is a look at those remarks prior to today's reporting about Republicans urging him to leave the race. Donald Trump Jr. said “we need more” people like Robinson who are “not afraid to say” what they’re thinking. During his Rumble show, Trump Jr. [said](https://x.com/mmfa/status/1836814550223475135) that he likes Robinson and he’s a “good guy, funny guy, not afraid to say what he is thinking, which I think we need more of.” [Eric Trump](https://www.mediamatters.org/media/4024062): “Amazing, amazing, amazing guy. Amazing guy. … Mark is a wonderful person, a wonderful guy. A person I’ve gotten to know very, very well. And I think not only are we going to win the state, I think he’s going to win the state.” Lara Trump dismissed concerns about Robinson hurting Trump’s candidacy. During an August interview with Bloomberg, the Republican National Committee co-chair was [asked](https://youtu.be/kvnePePKifk?feature=shared&t=299) if she was concerned about Robinson’s candidacy. She dismissed concerns that it would hurt her father-in-law's campaign, saying that “Donald Trump typically helps out the candidates in these various races, down-ballot races. … So that’s not a concern for us at all.” Turning Point USA’s [Charlie Kirk](https://www.mediamatters.org/media/4024056): “Mark, great work. We have your back.” Kirk also [said](https://www.mediamatters.org/media/4024058) of Robinson: “He’s got spirit, he’s got gusto, and I think he’s going to be a great governor of this state.” Newsmax’s Rob Schmitt: Mark Robinson's “no-BS” style is “very refreshing.” During his March 12 program, Schmitt [said](https://www.mediamatters.org/media/4024054): “The left, as you just saw, is going nuts over this guy. The avalanche of attacks against him have been piling up in recent days. A sample of Mark Robinson's no-BS, very refreshing style has never been seen better than in 2021 when he talked about gender ideology.” Fox-host-turned-streamer Dan Bongino: Outside of Trump, Robinson is “my personal favorite guest” and “favorite candidate.” In a video clip [posted](https://rumble.com/v57he7x-future-governor-mark-robinson-layin-down-the-law.html) to his Rumble account during the Republican National Convention, Bongino [introduced](https://www.mediamatters.org/media/4024053) Robinson by calling him “my personal favorite guest of all time outside of President Donald J. Trump” and “my favorite candidate in the country outside of President Trump. They’re neck-and-neck.” Former Trump adviser Sebastian Gorka: “We need Mark Robinson in the governorship of North Carolina. … Support this man today.” Interviewing Robinson on his show in March 2024, Gorka [added](https://www.mediamatters.org/media/4024055): “He's got my vote if I lived in North Carolina. He's got my support.” Trump adviser Roger Stone: “Mark Robinson is one of the most dynamic inspiring leaders. I have seen in my 45 years in American politics.” The longtime Republican [dirty trickster](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/25/roger-stone-a-master-of-the-political-dirty-trick) and right-wing commentator [wrote](https://x.com/RogerJStoneJr/status/1771154669328351352) that Robinson “is as great a communicator as Ronald Reagan and he has the courage of Donald Trump. I pray to God that he is elected governor of North Carolina.” GOP operative [Jack Posobiec](https://x.com/JackPosobiec/status/1804724354736869886): “TRUMP-ROBINSON 2024.” The right-wing commentator also [wrote](https://x.com/JackPosobiec/status/1805640587896353152) online: “Listening to Mark Robinson speeches in the gym.” Moms For America Action: “We are proud to endorse Mark Robinson for Governor because he is a fellow warrior for freedom and shares the same values of faith and family as Moms for America.” The political side of right-wing group Moms for America [wrote](https://mfaa.prowly.com/260766-national-moms-group-endorses-mark-robinson-for-nc-governor) a press release endorsing Robinson in September 2023 that stated, in part: “We are proud to endorse Mark Robinson for Governor because he is a fellow warrior for freedom and shares the same values of faith and family as Moms for America.” Newsmax’s [Carl Higbie](https://x.com/CarlHigbie/status/1765364662839673209): “For those of you who don’t know @markrobinsonNC, he is the next Star!!!” Higbie added that “he is now the likely next Governor of North Carolina.” Former Trump national security adviser and right-wing commentator [Mike Flynn](https://x.com/GenFlynn/status/1751296759047901537): “I stand and fully support this great PATRIOT to be the next Governor of North Carolina! @markrobinsonNC.” Far-right troll [Brenden Dilley](https://www.mediamatters.org/media/4024057): “I’m a big fan of this guy. I’ve met him, he’s a great gentleman. … Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson has won the North Carolina Republican primary for governor. That’s your next governor in North Carolina, God willing.” Actor and right-wing commentator [Dean Cain](https://x.com/RealDeanCain/status/1798538750034898968): “Go get ém @markrobinsonNC !! North Carolina needs you for Governor!” Fox’s Sean Hannity defended Robinson, saying “Democrats have been trying to smear, slander, you know, besmirch, attack the lieutenant governor day in and day out.\" On the March 19 edition of his radio program, Hannity [said](https://www.mediamatters.org/media/4024061), “Democrats have been trying to smear, slander, you know, besmirch, attack the lieutenant governor day in and day out. ... I watch what any politician like yourself goes through, and I do wonder. I'm like, why would anybody bother? And I know why you bother because you care.” Radio host [Buck Sexton](https://rumble.com/v4kgj7x-nc-lt.-governor-mark-robinson-tells-c-and-b-why-hes-running-for-governor.html) to Robinson: “Mark, when you win, you’ve got to come on and celebrate with us, OK?” Right-wing host Benny Johnson: “I just love the energy of this dude.” After airing Robinson’s campaign ad, Johnson [said](https://youtu.be/pAfG4Ls1Ecw?feature=shared&t=633): “I just love the energy of this dude. And I love his story because he’s like an internet story. He’s like a hero of the internet. Guy just went to a town council meeting, gave a speech, and then is going to become governor. That’s like the stuff of the Founding Fathers.”",
