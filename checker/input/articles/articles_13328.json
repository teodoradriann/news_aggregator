    "text": "La Oficina del Alto Comisionado de las Naciones Unidas para los Derechos Humanos condenó la “desaparición forzada” desde hace nueve días en Nicaragua del obispo Isidoro Mora y una “nueva ola de detenciones de religiosos” por parte del gobierno de Daniel Ortega. Medios de prensa nicaragüenses que trabajan desde el exilio y la abogada Martha Molina, investigadora de temas de la Iglesia de Nicaragua, denunciaron este jueves que la policía detuvo al vicario general de la Arquidiócesis de Managua, Carlos Avilés, que se suma a los arrestos en las últimas semanas de otros dos sacerdotes y del obispo Mora. La agencia de la ONU “condena la desaparición forzada del obispo Isidoro Mora en #Nicaragua desde hace 8 días y la nueva ola de detenciones de religiosos”, dijo en la red social X la oficina para América Central y el Caribe, con sede en Panamá. “Además de atentar contra su libertad personal, violarían el derecho a la libertad religiosa, pilar de cualquier Estado democrático”, agregó. La policía nicaragüense aún no se ha referido a la situación de ninguno de los religiosos. Además de Mora, de 53 años y obispo de Siuna, en la región del Caribe nicaragüense, está detenido el obispo Rolando Álvarez, de 57 años, condenado el 10 de febrero a 26 años por traición a la patria, propagación de noticias falsas y desacato, un día después de que rechazara salir a Estados Unidos junto a 222 opositores presos expulsados. La relación entre la Iglesia y el gobierno de Nicaragua se deterioró en medio de las protestas del 2018, luego de que Ortega acusó a religiosos de apoyar a los opositores en lo que consideró un intento de golpe de Estado. Tres meses de bloqueos de calles y choques entre opositores y oficialistas dejaron más de 300 muertos, según la ONU. Álvarez ha preferido la cárcel al exilio y no figuró entre los 12 sacerdotes liberados en octubre y enviados a Roma tras un acuerdo del gobierno con el Vaticano. Con Mora, suman ahora dos los obispos detenidos. Una investigación de Molina, en el exilio en Estados Unidos, sostiene que desde 2018 hubo 740 ataques contra la Iglesia y que 176 sacerdotes y religiosas fueron expulsados, desterrados o se les prohibió ingresar al país.",

    "title": "Liberal financial regime to help double IT exports: minister - Newspaper - DAWN.COM",
    "text": "ISLAMABAD: Caretaker Minister for Information Technology and Telecom Dr Umar Saif has said steps have been taken to liberalise the financial regime that will help double IT exports and facilitate freelancers to receive their remittances legally with minimum charges. “The IT exporters park a major part of their earnings outside the country, as they need to give payments to their international vendors and even employees based abroad,” the minister said while talking to a select group of journalists. “We worked with the SIFC (Special Investment Facilitation Council) and the State Bank of Pakistan, and now IT companies can keep 50 per cent of their export revenue in dollars in an account in Pakistan to make their international payments,” he added. Boosting IT exports from the current $2.6 billion to around $5bn was possible by facilitating the industry with the liberal financial regime, he said, adding that the inflow from IT exports had already jumped by 13 per cent in November last year and it would continue to grow. “This initiative [liberal financial regime] is aimed at addressing the challenges faced by approximately 1.5 million freelancers,” he said, adding that the caretaker government had resolved a long-standing demand of the freelancers by channelising inflows of their remittances. Dr Saif said the other initiatives undertaken by his ministry included providing smartphones to customers on instalments, standardised quality test for IT graduates to make Pakistan a ‘tech destination’ and approval of the space policy. He expressed the confidence that 5G services in the country would be launched by July this year and 300MHz spectrum would be offered for auction. He said that before the launch of 5G services, the optic fibre network had to be enhanced. Currently, only 6,000 mobile towers are connected with optic fibre out of around 56,000 towers across the country. He said the government would on January 12 launch a scheme to provide smartphones on easy instalments. “Telecom companies are on board as Jazz is even planning to offer iPhones on instalments; this will help the companies retain their customers on a long-term basis.” He said this initiative will also help increase smartphone accessibility across the country, besides increasing broadband usage. Dr Saif said his ministry had taken a significant decision to revamp IT education in universities in collaboration with the Higher Education Commission, National Computing Accreditation Council, Examination Testing Council, Pakistan Software Export Board and Pakistan Software Houses Association. Under the programme, around 31,000 students have registered themselves for the test so far and successful among them would be offered jobs through the Industry Placement Programme. Dr Saif disclosed that the government would initiate a project on Jan 11 to establish 10,000 e-Rozgar centres across the country that would be equipped with the latest facilities for freelancers and startups. The minister said the cabinet had approved the National Space Policy allowing private sector companies to use low-orbit satellites for communications and provide internet services across the country. He said all international companies, including Starlink, would be allowed to launch satellite communication services in Pakistan after obtaining a no-objection certificate from the Strategic Plans Division and licence from the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority.

    "title": "Christina Hall’s Inner Circle Reportedly Feared Her Marriage to Josh Would Fail",
    "text": "Kathy Hutchins/Shutterstock Christina Hall’s ongoing divorce from Josh Hall means that they’re one of the many celeb couples who’ve broken up in 2024. But while the couple’s divorce— which is the third time that Christina, who was once married to Tarek El Moussa, has split from a spouse—came as a shock to fans, her friends apparently had fears about their union before their breakup.\nChristina has since labeled Josh as a dishonest thief who betrayed her trust. “Josh contacted my professional property manager via text and stated, ‘Hi. For June payments, can we please get it sent to a different account when it’s time? Thank you,'” she wrote in her divorce filings about Josh’s supposed theft of her rental income (via People).\nAccording to Life & Style, Christina’s friends aren’t surprised that the former lovers have turned into enemies as they work to legally untangle their previous life together. “It’s not really a surprise to anyone that things have gotten so bitter so quickly,” shared a source with the publication in August 2024. “Plenty of people warned her not to rush into marrying Josh. Now she’s saying she didn’t really have a clue who he is.”\nAnother insider revealed that Christina is eager to recoup the money Josh allegedly stole from her. “Christina wants her money back. She never imagined Josh would sink so low,” they said, adding that her friends believe that this is only the start of ugliness between them.\nUnfortunately, all signs point to them being right.\nChristina Hall’s inner circle may have spilled some major tea about her messy divorce from Josh Hall to the media, but at least it seems that they’re squarely in her corner (even if they’ve been critical of her choices). Perhaps that’s why she’s still opting to lean on her friends as she journeys through the divorce process.\nFor example, Christina took to Instagram on August 13 and uploaded a slideshow titled “Life Lately,” which featured some of the fun she’s been having with her circle. Judging from the snaps, Hall has been enjoying some fine dining, fresh air, and physical activity with those closest to her. Of course, she also included a snapshot of her filming one of her HGTV projects at the end.\nUnfortunately, divorce is never a walk in the park, and in some cases may even be temporarily debilitating. But the HGTV alum has also proven that she’s not going to allow her personal trials to prevent her from finding time to celebrate the special folks in her life.\nOn August 18, the “Christina on the Coast” star posted an Instagram carousel featuring her and her friend, Kristin flying, surfing, and eating together, among other things. “Happy Birthday to my sweet & gorgeous friend—Kristin,” she wrote. “No matter the situation (home & chilling or off on some crazy adventure) we always are in our own world having the best time. Love you—this is your year girl …can’t wait to watch you shine.”\nChristina Hall is also making beautiful memories with her three children, which she had during her marriages to Tarek El Moussa and Ant Anstead. In August, Christina made an extra special Instagram post celebrating her son Brayden’s 9th birthday. Alongside several photos of Brayden through the years, the mom-of-three showered her son with praises. “I can’t believe my sweet guy is 9!” she wrote. “I knew when I was pregnant with him that this kid would be my biggest protector and I wasn’t wrong.”\nChristina also revealed that Brayden possesses more “courage, wit, and humor than most grown men,” which sounds a little like a dig towards her estranged husband, Josh Hall. Just saying!\nThe HGTV star also recently squeezed in a little much-needed female bonding time with her daughter, Taylor. In a post uploaded by the Lush Locks by Latitude Instagram account, Christina and Taylor can be seen flaunting their fresh dye jobs. The short video, also featured on Christina’s account, shows her and Taylor doing a fun before and after montage of their hair prior to receiving the Lush Locks treatment alongside the finished product. They also posed together at the end.\n“Mom & Daughter hair day!” read the post’s caption. “Christina got a fresh microfoil & Lush Lucks extensions, while Taylor added soft partial highlights to blend her sun-kissed ends.” And while this wasn’t quite the divorce makeover we envisioned for Christina, she and Taylor definitely settled on great styles!\nSource: Nicki Swift, People, Life & Style",
