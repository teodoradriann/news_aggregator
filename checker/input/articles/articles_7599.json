    "text": "[Cricket Score Centre ](/news/sport/score-centre/cricket)\nPerth Scorchers beat Brisbane Heat in Big Bash League, after brilliant run outs and big hitting from Nick Hobson\nThe Perth Scorchers have overcome a masterclass bowling display from Spencer Johnson to secure a crushing 33-run Big Bash League win over the Brisbane Heat in front of 41,921 fans at Perth Stadium.\nThe Scorchers posted 6-165 in Thursday night's clash, with power hitter Nick Hobson blasting an unbeaten 47 off 16 balls to help the hosts recover from a sluggish start.\nJohnson, who missed the Heat's first two games of the season with a toe injury, starred with a career-best 4-20 from four overs.\nIn reply, the Heat's hopes were cruelled by two incredible run outs before being bowled out for 132 in 19.4 overs, with only Matthew Renshaw (36 off 24 balls) and Max Bryant (35 off 20 balls) able to get on a roll.\nThe result improved Perth's record to 2-2, while the Heat are now 2-1 following their first defeat of the season.\nHobson struck five sixes and two fours in his blistering knock.\nHe smacked Xavier Bartlett for 24 runs in the Scorchers' final over, with the first four deliveries being a 6, 4, 6, 6.\n\"I love batting at that six role, but definitely it has its pros and cons,\" Hobson said.\n\"Some days you feel like you're batting the wrong way around. It can be hard work to hit it.\n\"And then days like today, it finds the middle and the crowd go wild.\n\"It was pretty cool that last over when the crowd were getting involved and the momentum was starting to build. It was a lot of fun.\"\nThe Heat slumped to 3-22 in the fifth over of their run chase after Tom Banton (7), Jimmy Peirson (1) and Colin Munro (6) departed cheaply.\nAshton Agar's effort to run out Heat skipper Peirson sent the crowd wild.\nAgar dived full length at gully to reel in the racing ball with his right hand. He then switched the ball to his left hand and swivelled on his knees in the one action before throwing down the stumps.\nRenshaw unleashed a series of huge blows to get the scoreboard ticking along after that.\nBut the Heat were on the back foot yet again when Scorchers import Finn Allen threw down the stumps from backward point to run out Nathan McSweeney at the non-striker's end.\nThat moment of magic reduced Brisbane to 4-62 in the ninth over, and when Renshaw holed out in the deep, the Heat were 5-73 and not in a position to launch another counter-attack.\nAgar finished with 1-14 from his four overs as Perth's stand-out bowler.\nEarlier, Allen's disastrous start to his time at the Scorchers continued, with the NZ blaster out for a five-ball duck.\nIt followed on from scores of six, four and 0.\nJohnson had figures of 1-0 after nine deliveries, and his miserly spell helped Brisbane restrict Perth to 1-18 from the four-over power play.\nMatty Hurst (28 off 25 balls), Cooper Connolly (37 off 37) and Aaron Hardie (24 off 23) all struggled for fluency, but Hobson's late heroics helped give the total an important boost.\nAt one point, Johnson had figures of 2-4 off 2.5 overs in a superb return from injury.\n\"It was nice to get back out there,\" Johnson said.\n\"I missed a couple of games, so just to be back in the Brisbane Heat shirt is nice, and to contribute as well is always good.\n\"But unfortunately, we couldn't get the win.\"\nIn the earlier game, James Vince overcame illness to hit a blazing century and help the Sydney Sixers pull off one of the most dominant BBL chases ever, hauling in 195 with 11 balls to spare to beat the hapless Melbourne Stars.\nUnwell before the match and requiring medication to settle an unhappy stomach, Vince hit 101 from 58 balls at the SCG to win the battle of the Brits over the equally hard-hitting Ben Duckett.\nThe successful chase with eight wickets to spare was the eighth biggest in the 14-year history of the BBL, and the biggest in any match at the SCG.\nIt also kept the Melbourne Stars winless after four games with their finals hopes fading fast, while the Sixers remain undefeated after three matches.\nAAP\nThe ABC of SPORT\n[ABC Privacy Collection Statement](https://help.abc.net.au/hc/en-us/articles/360001511015).",

Eso [Xiaomi ](https://www.fayerwayer.com/moviles/2023/09/24/versatilidad-a-toda-prueba-asi-es-la-nueva-redmi-pad-se-de-xiaomi/)lo sabe bien, ya que en los últimos años ha estado innovando con todo tipo de aparatos electrónicos. Tal es el caso de su nuevo SU7, un vehículo eléctrico con el que planean entrar a lo grande al negocio automotriz. Y es que la revelación de este automóvil marca un hito significativo en la estrategia de la empresa, que aspira a ser uno de los cinco principales fabricantes de automóviles del mundo en los próximos 15 a 20 años. Un vehículo ambicioso: Así es el Xiaomi SU7 Según [Xiaomi](https://c.mi.com/global/post/677336), el SU7 no es sólo un vehículo, sino que se define como una extensión del ecosistema tecnológico de la firma. De partida, incorpora el sistema operativo [HyperOS](https://www.fayerwayer.com/moviles/2023/10/26/xiaomi-14-presentada-la-nueva-linea-de-la-marca-con-pantallas-de-3000-nits-y-camaras-de-apertura-variable/), diseñado para integrarse perfectamente con una amplia gama de dispositivos Xiaomi, incluidos IoT, televisores, altavoces, y más. Este sistema operativo es el cerebro detrás del SU7, capaz de gestionar tanto los sistemas de info-entretenimiento como la conducción autónoma. El SU7, también denominado “Speed Ultra”, estará disponible en dos versiones; la primera con el motor HyperEngine V6 y la otra con un HyperEngine V6S, que ofrecen potencias impresionantes de 295 CV y 663 CV respectivamente. Su autonomía, en tanto, varía entre 1.000 y 1.200 kilómetros, dependiendo de la batería seleccionada. HyperOS: Más que un sistema operativo Sin dudas el lanzamiento de HyperOS representa un gran avance, tanto en términos de vehículos eléctricos como también en la integración de la tecnología en la vida cotidiana. Este sistema operativo permite una conexión instantánea con otros aparatos, permitiendo acceder y controlar aplicaciones móviles directamente desde el sistema del SU7. Con una pantalla de 16,1 pulgadas y resolución 3K, HyperOS también permite la visualización de parámetros de conducción y la gestión de otros dispositivos conectados. Xiaomi contra Tesla: ¿Una competencia real? Por supuesto que Xiaomi no compite solo, ya que la compañía se enfrenta a un mercado de vehículos eléctricos dominado directamente por [ Tesla](https://www.fayerwayer.com/entretenimiento/2023/12/03/el-cybertruck-de-tesla-ya-esta-aqui-conoce-su-precio/). Así que tras el lanzamiento del SU7, Xiaomi entrará en este mercado y, según su [comunicado](https://c.mi.com/global/post/677336) oficial, intentará reinventarlo gracias a su amplia gama de tecnologías. El tiempo dirá si el SU7 logra establecerse como un serio competidor de Tesla y si logrará su objetivo de ser uno de los principales fabricantes de automóviles del mundo. Por ahora, estaremos atentos a su fecha de lanzamiento para contarles todos los detalles oportunamente.",

    "title": "Court locks in Georgia's new map that draws Rep. Lucy McBath out of her district - POLITICO",
    "text": "Court locks in Georgia’s new map that draws Rep. Lucy McBath out of her district The map carved up her “coalition district” to create a majority Black district to Atlanta’s west. A federal judge on Thursday approved a new congressional map in Georgia, which maintains the overall partisan split of the state’s congressional delegation. It also imperils Rep. Lucy McBath, who was drawn out of her congressional district. District Judge Steve C. Jones, an appointee of President Barack Obama, signed off on lines drawn by the GOP-controlled legislature earlier this month . Jones had previously tossed the lines used in the 2022 elections for violating the Voting Rights Act by diluting the power of Black voters in the state, ordering the state to draw more districts where Black voters can elect candidates of their choosing. Both the map used in the 2022 elections and the one approved by Jones on Thursday would ultimately result in the same partisan split: Republicans are favored to hold nine seats and Democrats five. The new map includes five congressional districts where Black voters made up a majority or near-majority, up from the previous map’s four, creating a new majority Black district to the west of Atlanta. But McBath’s former district, to the city’s northeast, was not a majority Black district. Georgia Republicans dismantled her “coalition district,” (which created a majority-minority district through a combination of Black, Latino and Asian voters), to create the new majority Black district. Democrats contended the Republicans’ efforts to redraw the map by dismantling that coalition district also violated the Voting Rights Act and didn’t comply with the court’s orders, and urged the court to block it. Jones declined to do so on Thursday. “The Court finds that the General Assembly fully complied with this Court’s order requiring the creation of a majority-Black congressional district,” he wrote in his order . Notably, Jones did not rule on if the elimination of the coalition district violated the Voting Rights Act — but wrote that if Democrats wanted to bring that claim, it would be “better suited for a separate case.” Democrats will almost assuredly pursue that separate claim, either on appeal or in a distinct lawsuit. But Jones’ decision Thursday means the new maps will likely be used for at least the 2024 elections in the state. In a statement shortly after Thursday’s court order, McBath said she would run in that new majority Black district west of Atlanta. “I hope that the judicial system will not allow the state legislature to suppress the will of Georgia voters. However, if the maps passed by the state legislature stand for the 2024 election cycle, I will be running for re-election to Congress” in the new 6th District, she said.",
