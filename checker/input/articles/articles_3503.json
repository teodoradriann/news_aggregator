    "title": "Covid-19 and flu cases double in a week as deadly new JN.1 strain spreads - Daily Star",
    "text": "The Health Service Executive (HSE) has issued a warning as a surge in Covid-19 cases has led to 30 outbreaks in hospitals. The number of people visiting emergency departments with Covid-19 infections has doubled this week, with 54 outbreaks reported in hospitals and nursing homes nationwide. There's also been a 72% rise in patients presenting with flu symptoms over the past week. The HSE warns that infection numbers are likely to keep rising in the coming weeks. This week, emergency departments treated 538 people with flu and 282 with Covid-19. This is a significant increase from the previous week, which saw 312 flu patients and 144 Covid-19 patients, the [Irish Mirror reports](https://www.irishmirror.ie/news/irish-news/hse-issues-warning-covid-19-31764250).

The HSE emphasises that everyone must do their part to prevent hospitals from becoming overwhelmed. \"Hospitals and community services around the country have put a sustained effort into ensuring hospitals are positioned for the traditional post-Christmas demand,\" said a spokesperson. However, they warned that the rise in flu and Covid infections is very steep. They urged the public to only visit the Emergency Department for major health emergencies and to use other options for non-emergency situations. People are advised to utilise local pharmacies and check the HSE.ie website before going to their GP or ED if they have respiratory symptoms. The HSE also advises people to get vaccinated at their GP clinic or pharmacy. \"If you are unwell, you should stay at home until 48 hours after your major symptoms have resolved; avoid visiting people who are more vulnerable if you are unwell, especially avoid visiting hospitals or nursing homes.\" Dr Colm Henry, the HSE's chief clinical officer, warned that rising flu and Covid rates will put \"significant pressure\" on hospitals and care homes. He said: \"Our emergency departments are expected to encounter significant pressures as a result and we know from experience that a delayed peak in flu season such as we are seeing now, will inevitably lead to further pressures throughout the healthcare system with heightened risk of outbreaks in all facilities and delays discharging patients to nursing homes or step down facilities if they have flu or Covid,\" He added: \"Vaccination remains the best way to reduce the incidence of these respiratory illnesses. The HSE is urging every eligible person to get vaccinated against flu and Covid as soon as possible.\" Join the Daily Star's WhatsApp for the sexiest headlines, showbiz gossip and lots more The Daily Star is now on WhatsApp and we want you to join us!

The new JN.1 variant of Covid-19 is fast becoming the dominant strain, and is more transmissible, resulting in more infections, according to Dr Eamonn O'Moore, director of national health promotion. \"We are still collating data in Ireland and internationally on whether it will result in more illness requiring hospital care but at this time we are not seeing that signal. However, with more infection around, there is greater risk some people who are vulnerable could become ill and require hospital care and we still need to protect our vulnerable members of society, children and adults, by doing what we can to reduce the spread of respiratory viruses.\" * This article was crafted with the help of an AI tool, which speeds up Daily Star's editorial research.

    "title": "Pope's 'critical': What's next for the Vatican and Catholic church?",
    "text": "Pope's 'critical': What’s next for the Vatican and Catholic church?\nPope Francis remains in a critical condition, raising urgent questions about the Vatican's leadership and the future of the Catholic Church. The 88-year-old pontiff has been hospitalised at Rome’s Gemelli Hospital since February 14, initially admitted with bronchitis, which later worsened into double pneumonia. The Vatican confirmed he suffered a prolonged respiratory crisis requiring high-flow oxygen and blood transfusions, while tests revealed thrombocytopenia associated with anaemia, further complicating his recovery.Despite his condition, Francis remains alert, though visibly weaker, as reported by news agency AFP. The Vatican’s latest update stated that his prognosis remains uncertain. The pope’s ongoing health concerns have reignited discussions about the possibility of resignation, following in the footsteps of Pope Benedict XVI, who stepped down in 2013 due to deteriorating health. However, Francis has repeatedly insisted that he sees the papacy as a lifelong commitment.\nVatican’s response\nWhat happens if the pope becomes incapacitated?\nUnlike the clear guidelines for a pope’s resignation or death, no formal rules exist if a pontiff becomes permanently incapacitated. Canon law has provisions for bishops in such situations, but not for the pope, leading to a significant grey area. In 2021, canon lawyers proposed norms for such an event, suggesting that if a pope were to become totally unable to govern, the College of Cardinals could assume temporary control. However, these proposals have not been formally adopted.\nFrancis has previously disclosed that he wrote a letter of resignation shortly after his election, to be used in case of medical incapacity. The letter is believed to be in the hands of Vatican officials, though its conditions and validity remain unclear. According to church law, a resignation must be “freely and properly manifested,” raising questions about whether an already incapacitated pope could formally step down.\nWhat's next?\nAs Pope Francis battles serious illness, speculation grows over the Vatican’s next steps. While he remains in charge for now, the possibility of resignation looms larger than ever. The situation has also prompted fresh discussions on the need for clearer succession procedures in cases of papal incapacity. For the world’s 1.4 billion Catholics, the coming days will be crucial in determining not only Francis’s future but also the stability of the Church’s leadership.\nVatican’s response\nWhile Pope Francis remains the head of the Catholic Church, the day-to-day operations of the Vatican continue under the leadership of Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin and other senior officials. Vatican governance remains intact, with Parolin initially overseas but now back in Rome to oversee critical matters. Other key events, including preparations for the 2025 Holy Year, are proceeding as planned, with Archbishop Rino Fisichella recently leading a Mass in St. Peter’s Basilica in place of the ailing pontiff.\nWhat happens if the pope becomes incapacitated?\nUnlike the clear guidelines for a pope’s resignation or death, no formal rules exist if a pontiff becomes permanently incapacitated.

    "title": "Iowa Hawkeyes Receiver Credits Jesus After Scoring 2 Touchdowns",
    "text": "In a standout performance that marked the beginning of his college football career, University of Iowa freshman wide receiver Reece Vander Zee made headlines not just for his athletic prowess but also for his public declaration of faith. After scoring two touchdowns in the No. 21-ranked Hawkeyes’ 40-0 victory over the Illinois State University Redbirds at the season opener, Vander Zee credited his success to his faith in Jesus Christ.\nFor any freshman, the first game of the college football season is a nerve-wracking experience. But for Reece Vander Zee, it was an opportunity to showcase the talent and faith that had brought him to this point. The Rock Rapids, Iowa native, who had been a two-time all-state selection in high school, recorded 66 receiving yards on five catches in his debut game. More importantly, he found the end zone twice, helping to lead the Hawkeyes to a dominant victory.\nWhen asked during a post-game press conference if he had anticipated such a performance in his first game, Vander Zee’s humility and faith were on full display.\n“To be honest, I didn’t,” Vander Zee responded candidly. “I credit my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ for just giving me this opportunity. A lot of things fell into place for me to be here, and I just get all my confidence from Him. I just prayed that He gave me confidence. And I went out there, and I showed that today.”\nFor Vander Zee, faith is more than just a part of his life—it’s the foundation upon which he builds everything. His social media presence, particularly his X (formerly Twitter) account, is a testament to this. The biography section of his profile features a reference to Luke 14:11, which reads, “For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.” This verse encapsulates the humility and faith that guide Vander Zee’s life.\nIn a pinned post from June 2023, when Vander Zee announced his commitment to play football at the University of Iowa, he expressed his gratitude and dedication to glorifying God through his athletic career.\n“I want to thank my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ for blessing me and equipping me with amazing gifts,” Vander Zee wrote. “I truly want to glorify Him in everything I do and can’t wait to see what amazing plans He has for me!”\nAfter such a strong start, fans and teammates alike will be eager to see how this Christian freshman receiver continues to develop.",
