    "text": "Ministro Ceballos asegura disminución de 16% en el índice de criminalidad en 2023 Remigio Ceballos Ichaso, ministro de Relaciones Interiores informó sobre una disminución de 16,8% en el índice de criminalidad en comparación con años anteriores, y calificó el descenso como «un duro golpe a las mafias criminales». Por su parte, el director del Observatorio Venezolano de Violencia (OVV), Roberto Briceño León, destacó que pese a la disminución registrada este año, la tasa nacional es superior a la de países tradicionalmente violentos, como México, Colombia y Brasil El ministro de Relaciones Interiores, Remigio Ceballos Ichaso, aseguró que durante el 2023 el índice de criminalidad tuvo una disminución de 16,8% en comparación con años anteriores, y calificó como «un duro golpe a las mafias criminales» que les ha permitido «obtener grandes victorias». En la presentación de un balance, el también vicepresidente sectorial para la Seguridad Ciudadana y la Paz, destacó que en operativos contra el narcotráfico, fueron incautados “más de 52 toneladas” durante 2023, lo que representa un 26,91% en relación al 2022. Asimismo, el ministro informó cerca del despliegue de 3 mil cuadrantes de paz en 804 parroquias de los 329 municipios del territorio nacional, que beneficiará al 83,65% de la población. *Lea también: [Ceballos afirmó que directores de penales intervenidos están siendo investigados](https://talcualdigital.com/ceballos-afirmo-que-directores-de-penales-intervenidos-estan-siendo-investigados/) Al respecto, Ceballos destacó la labor de los órganos de seguridad en el desarrollo de la Operación de Liberación Gran Cacique Guaicaipuro, contra las mafias carcelarias, que “permitió liberar a Venezuela de las mafias carcelarias (…) eso se acabó, y ha sido gracias a la acción radical del equipo de Gobierno que lidera nuestro Presidente Nicolás Maduro Moros”, señaló. Dotaciones El ministro Ceballos también informó sobre la entrega y dotación de 2 mil 903 vehículos, camionetas especiales y motocicletas para el fortalecimiento de la Gran Misión Cuadrante de Paz. Asimismo, anunció la activación del Grupo Motorizado de Emergencias (Grumae) para la atención y administración de desastres. Asimismo, Ceballos junto al jefe de Gobierno de Distrito Capital, Naum Fernández, reinauguraron la sede principal del Cuerpo de Bomberos de Caracas. Destacó que, «durante todo el año» el departamento recibió dotación en general, equipamiento constante y permanente a todos nuestros bomberos”. 6.973 muertes violentas en 2023 Durante el 2023 se registraron al menos 6.973 muertes violentas, según datos presentados por el [ Observatorio Venezolano de Violencia (OVV) ](https://talcualdigital.com/ovv-registro-159-menos-en-tasa-de-asesinatos-en-comparacion-a-2022/)en su informe 2023. La cifra supone una reducción en comparación con los años 2021 y 2022. El director del Observatorio Venezolano de Violencia (OVV), Roberto Briceño León, dijo que se calcularon 581 fallecimientos violentos por mes, 134 por semana y 19 por día. El informe arroja que hubo 1.956 homicidios y 953 muertes por intervención policial. *Lea también: [OVV registró 15,9% menos en tasa de asesinatos en comparación a 2022](https://talcualdigital.com/ovv-registro-159-menos-en-tasa-de-asesinatos-en-comparacion-a-2022/) “Se nota que a lo largo del año (2023) se ha dado una estabilización en las muertes violentas. En años anteriores había meses que tenían una mayor presencia de violencia, este año vemos que hay una cierta homogeneización a lo largo de 12 meses, lo cual lo interpretamos como una estabilización de los eventos en una fase de violencia crónica que se ha ido instalando en el país”, expresó Briceño. Agregó que las cifras de desaparecidos en Venezuela siguen siendo altas. El observatorio contabilizó 1.443 personas desaparecidas a lo largo del año. “Aunque observamos una reducción importante en las cifras de las tasas de muertes violentas en el país, la tasa que tenemos a nivel nacional es superior a la de países tradicionalmente violentos, como México, Colombia y Brasil. La tasa de Venezuela es solo superada por Ecuador y Honduras, que serían los países que encabezarían las cifras en la región”, alertó Briceño.",

    "title": "Binance’s CZ Warns of macOS and iPhone Exploit Affecting Crypto Community",
    "text": "Binance’s former CEO cautions Mac users on a major security vulnerability. Apple has a history of security flaws that can lead to crypto losses, calling for safeguards. Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the former CEO of Binance Exchange, recently informed the crypto community of a new vulnerability targeted at Intel-based Mac users. The vulnerability affecting iPhones and iPads may expose users’ digital assets.\nZhao Sounds An Alarm Taking to the X platform, Zhao urged Mac users with Intel-based chips to update their devices, following a zero-day exploit on November 19. “If you use a Macbook with an Intel-based chip, update asap. Stay SAFU,” CZ wrote .\nIf you use a Macbook with Intel based chip, update asap!\nStay SAFU! https://t.co/mk2Jsicnte\n— CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) November 20, 2024\nZero-day vulnerabilities are flaws identified and exploited by hackers before a patch becomes available. The term “zero-day” refers to developers having limited time to fix the vulnerability upon discovery.\nThese vulnerabilities pose a high risk because the longer they remain undetected, the longer attackers have to exploit them. It can result in severe consequences for end users, such as data breaches, financial loss, privacy violations, and disruption.\nApple confirmed the attack in a postmortem and introduced major macOS and iOS security updates to prevent further damage. The company urged users to update to iOS 18.1.1, macOS Sequoia 15.1.1, and the older iOS 17.7.2. Apple described one of the addressed vulnerabilities as a cookie management issue.\nThe tech giant identified the vulnerabilities as CVE-2024-44308 and CVE-2024-44309, which affected macOS Sequoia’s JavaScriptCore and WebKit components. Hackers can use this to execute “cross-site scripting attacks” and covertly launch malicious code.\nCross-site scripting (XSS) is a web security attack that involves injecting malicious scripts into legitimate websites or applications. Crypto hackers have previously used similar vulnerabilities on Mac and Windows computers to steal wallet passwords and insert malware to steal private keys and digital assets.\nResearchers at Google’s Threat Analysis Group, notorious for probing government-backed hacks, initially uncovered the latest vulnerabilities. As a result, speculation has grown over the possible involvement of state-sponsored actors. Meanwhile, Apple has yet to share any details regarding the extent of the damage other than the fact that the vulnerabilities were “actively exploited.”\nConcerns For Apple and MacOS Users Apple users have been at risk on several occasions this year alone despite the Company’s stellar reputation for security. CNF reported earlier this month that North Korean hackers exploited macOS with malware hidden in decoy PDFs to steal crypto keys.\nIn March, researchers discovered a flaw in Apple’s M-series chips that hackers could leverage to retrieve cryptographic keys stored in the CPU’s cache. A month later, Web3 wallet provider Trust Wallet warned about another zero-day exploit in Apple’s iMessage framework. This attack allowed hackers to infiltrate iPhones without any user interaction.\nAmid these attacks, Apple launched the iPhone 16, its first smartphone with native Artificial Intelligence (AI) support. As CNF noted , the news stirred excitement among holders of AI crypto tokens.",

    "title": "Why isnʼt elemental on Disney+ plus?",
    "text": "Why Isn’t Elemental on Disney+?\nDisney+ is the latest streaming service to hit the market, and it has been making waves with its extensive library of Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, and National Geographic content. However, one notable absence from the platform is the popular animated series Elemental . In this article, we will delve into the reasons behind Elemental’s absence from Disney+ and explore the possibilities of when it might arrive.\nWhat is Elemental?\nFor those who may be unfamiliar, Elemental is a Disney-Pixar animated series that premiered on Disney Junior in 2021. The show is set in a world where the elements of nature, such as fire, water, and earth, are alive and personified. The story follows three elemental siblings, Ember, Wade, and Onyx, as they navigate the challenges of growing up and learning to control their elemental powers.\nWhy isn’t Elemental on Disney+?\nDisney+ has been criticized for its limited selection of Disney Junior content, and Elemental’s absence is a major disappointment for fans of the show. So, why isn’t Elemental on Disney+? Here are some possible reasons:\nLicensing agreements : Disney may not have the necessary licensing agreements in place to stream Elemental on Disney+. The show is produced by Disney Junior, but it’s possible that the licensing rights have been sold to another platform or network.\nTarget audience : Elemental is primarily targeted towards young children, and Disney+ may not be the best platform for this age group. Disney Junior is designed specifically for young children, and its content is more geared towards preschoolers.\nContent restrictions : Disney+ has strict content guidelines, and some shows may not meet the platform’s standards. Elemental may contain elements (pun intended) that are not suitable for all audiences, such as mild violence or mature themes.\nUnavailability of episodes : Elemental has only two seasons with a total of 26 episodes. It’s possible that Disney+ is waiting for the show to complete its run or produce more episodes before adding it to their library.\nWhen will Elemental be on Disney+?\nWhile we can’t predict the future, we can make some educated guesses. Disney+ has a track record of adding Disney Junior shows to their platform , such as Sofia the First and Doc McStuffins . Given this trend, it’s possible that Elemental will eventually make its way to Disney+.\nFuture of Disney Junior content on Disney+ : Disney has announced plans to increase the amount of Disney Junior content on Disney+, including new shows and exclusive content. This could mean that Elemental will be part of this expansion.\nElemental’s popularity : Elemental has a dedicated fan base, and its popularity could prompt Disney to reconsider its absence from Disney+. If the show performs well on other platforms, it may increase the likelihood of it being added to Disney+.\nConclusion\nElemental’s absence from Disney+ is a mystery that has left fans of the show disappointed and curious. While we can’t confirm the exact reasons behind its absence, we can speculate that licensing agreements, target audience, content restrictions, and unavailability of episodes may be contributing factors. However, Disney+ has a history of adding Disney Junior shows to their platform, and Elemental’s popularity could increase the likelihood of it being added in the future. Until then, fans of the show will have to continue watching on other platforms.",

    "title": "Passenger, Who Felt Pressured To Give Up His Seat On Flight, Reveals How Quick Thinking Got Them Out Of Seat Swapping",
    "text": "No one likes to swap seats on a flight. Often, you're paying a premium for certain seats anyway. Plus, you would catch me walking before I catch that dreaded middle seat. It turns out one passenger agreed with me. A passenger shared a time that one traveler tried to pressure them to give up their seat.\nBut they quickly turned the table. On Reddit, the passenger decided to share their story. They wrote, \"Just sharing one of my favorite seat swapping stories. I was in an aisle seat and the woman in the aisle seat across from me decides she wants to help out this family. She turns to me and says the guy next to her (in the middle seat) would very much like to sit next to his family (wife and daughter seated in the middle and window seat next to me). She asks, would you be willing to help them out by swapping seats?\"\nIn response, the passenger smiled and said, \"Sure! So you'll take the husband's middle seat and then I'll take your seat.\" However, the woman appeared confused by the request.\nPassenger Turns The Tables\nShe said, \"They just want to sit together.\"\nThe passenger responded, \"Sure! Happy to switch with you. So you'll take his seat and I'll take yours.\" According to the Reddit post, that's when the woman learned to mind her own business.\nThe Redditor wrote, \"The confusion sets in. Brow furrows. And, then...the glorious moment when that lightbulb goes off. Shaking her head violently and frowning, says: 'Oh no, I don't want to give up my seat?' I relax in my seat with my smug smile and thinking my job here is done. By saying yes to her, I forced her to be the one to say no.\"\nIt's best to just not be that person. In fact, writer and advisor, Nicole Campoy Jackson told People that you shouldn't ask your fellow passengers to swap seats with you. Instead, it's better to alert a flight attendant if you have issues and let them solve it.\n\"I am always in the camp of getting a flight attendant involved for sticky in-flight situations,\" she said. \"Tensions run high when we're traveling plus they would know, for example, if there was another aisle seat or another solution to this problem. They have more context than we, the passengers, do.\"",

Este programa de becas forma parte de la iniciativa de empoderamiento comunitario Contigo de Univision Arizona. Ofrece una beca a un estudiante de Arizona para cubrir el costo total de matrícula y alojamiento durante cuatro años de estudios de pregrado en NAU.\nNAU es una de las 10 principales universidades en el país en la producción de títulos de licenciatura para estudiantes hispanos. Reconocida como una Institución que Sirve a Hispanos (HSI, por sus siglas en inglés), NAU está reforzando su compromiso con el logro educativo, aumentando los fondos para becas y recursos adicionales para su diversa comunidad estudiantil. La Oficina de Becas y Ayuda Financiera de NAU igualará la contribución de Univision Arizona cada año, proporcionando una beca correspondiente a un estudiante de pregrado, duplicando así el impacto.\n“Univision Arizona se siente honrada de asociarse con Northern Arizona para otorgar esta beca completa, basada en un ensayo, de cuatro años. La educación es la clave para el futuro de nuestra comunidad, y Univision Arizona está comprometida a tomar medidas concretas para ofrecer oportunidades educativas”, dijo Mark Masepohl, presidente y gerente general regional de Univision Arizona.\nLa asociación y el apoyo de Univision Arizona elevan a NAU como una HSI, reforzando los sistemas de apoyo para los valiosos estudiantes de la universidad.\n“La Fundación NAU está profundamente agradecida con Univision Arizona por invertir en nuestros estudiantes y fortalecer la designación de NAU como una Institución que Sirve a Hispanos”, dijo Nick Lobjeko, vicepresidente de Avance de NAU y director ejecutivo de la Fundación NAU. “Su compromiso con el éxito estudiantil crea acceso y oportunidades para que los estudiantes persistan en su búsqueda de un título universitario”.\nLos estudiantes que ingresen como primer año para el ciclo escolar de otoño de 2025 podrán postularse para la beca entre el 2 de diciembre de 2024 y el 15 de abril de 2025, presentando un ensayo de 250 palabras describiendo el impacto profundo que su título universitario tendrá tanto en su trayectoria personal como en la comunidad hispana en general.
