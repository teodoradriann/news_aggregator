    "text": "The Diocese of Cartago received this Friday a sample Carlo Acutis’ hair. Acutis will be proclaimed a saint for a miracle granted to a Costa Rican woman. The Vatican has sent to the Diocese of Cartago a relic of Carlo Acutis, who will be proclaimed a saint after granting a miracle to the young Costa Rican Valeria Valverde, 21 years old.\n“We are going to receive in the Diocese of Cartago a first-degree relic. When we talk about first-degree relics, we talk about parts of the body. In this case, it is from this young man who is an example for the youth. Through a normal and ordinary life, he celebrated his faith and believed in the presence of Jesus in the Eucharist, and as he said, ‘the most ordinary way to get to heaven is to attend mass,’” noted David Arley, a priest of the diocese.\nThe relic arrived during on Friday at the Cathedral of Cartago . It will remain there for the weekend.On Sunday at 2:00 p.m., it will be transported to the Parish of Santa Maria Goretti—in the Pitahaya sector—where it will reside permanently. A mass will be celebrated at the site by the local Bishop, Mario Enrique Quirós.\nFor the Church, this is very symbolic as St. Maria Goretti also died young, so both figures will now be known as the patron saints of diocesan youth.\nThe Diocese of Cartago also stated that other parishes will be able to request a visit from the relic for a few days.Acutis was born in London in 1991, where his family was based for work. He was an avid Catholic and was very active on social media, which he used to spread his faith. This led him to become an “influencer” of the Church or “internet apostle.”\nAcutis died of leukemia in 2006, and since then, prayers to him began to spread. In 2018, he was declared “venerable,” the first step towards sainthood. By 2020, his first miracle was recognized when the unexplained healing of a child in Brazil was attributed to him. According to the norms of the Catholic Church, another case of intercession needed to be presented, and a few days ago, the Vatican recognized the unexplained recovery of a young Costa Rican woman named Valeria Valverde.\nPrevious article Costa Rica Birding: Meet the Lesser Ground-Cuckoo Next article Milagro Mena Solano to Represent Costa Rica in Paris 2024 Olympics",

    "text": "| |\nSupport\nContact\nAce:\naceofspadeshq at gee mail.com\nCBD:\ncbd at cutjibnewsletter.com\nBuck:\nbuck.throckmorton at protonmail.com\njoe mannix:\nmannix2024 at proton.me\nMisHum:\npetmorons at gee mail.com\nJ.J. Sefton:\nsefton at cutjibnewsletter.com\nPowered by\n|\n|\nCNN: The Biden Administration Is Moving Towards Allowing US \"Contractors\" -- Military Personnel Paid by Third Parties -- to Aid in the Fight Against the Russians in Ukraine\nBut now? They're going to keep escalating until they claim \"we have to fight them there so we don't have to fight them here.\" They're going to get into a nuclear war with Russia. CNN claims these military contractors will \"only\" be repairing the engines of war Ukraine is using to attack Russia. Well, first of all, Russia will certainly consider repairing and improving America-provided military armaments to be an act of war. Second of all, I sure do remember American governments sending military advisors into foreign countries claiming their role would be strictly of a non-combat nature...\n... The discussions follow a series of decisions the US has made in recent months to try to help Ukraine beat back the Russians. In late-May, Biden gave Ukraine permission to strike targets inside Russia, near the border with the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, with US weapons--a request the US had repeatedly denied in the past. Last week, that policy appeared to expand once again, when National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said Ukraine could counterstrike anywhere along the Ukraine-Russia border using US weapons.So prudent.\nBiden is going to Mr Magoo us into WW III. Dumb bastard. Posted by: Frank Barone\nI believe you. I also believe President Johnson when he tells me we're just sending a few dozen \"military advisors\" to Vietnam. You know who's behind this, right?\n\"This would be a much more focused and thoughtful effort to support Ukraine in country,\" said retired Army officer Alex Vindman, who served as the director for European Affairs on former President Donald Trump's National Security Council. Vindman has been pushing the administration to lift the restrictions for nearly two years and said the administration has been working on a plan to ease the restrictions since earlier this year.This how The Regime gets America into foreign wars it does not want to fight: It's always just the tip, just the tip, just a little bit further now, boom, Now Our Flag Is On the Line and you're pregnant with a nuclear war with Russia. Oops! Ooopsie!\nSo, what apparently happened was: A US made ATACMS detonated cluster bombs over a recreational beach in Crimea on Sunday afternoon, killing four people and wounding more than 150.The video in the post I linked shows that attack.\nA Russian fighter jet shot down a US drone off of Crimea in international waters in response. (US drones are used to provide targeting information for \"Ukrainian\" weapons.) The Russian government responded with \"no comment\" when asked about shooting down the drone. The US government chose not to make an issue of the drone shootdown. We are very, very close to World War Three. Posted by: The ARC of History!Russia is warning the US about this.\nUkraine, Moscow warns Washington: \"With weapons in Kiev there is a risk of escalation\"American weapons, Moscow means.\nWhile Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visited the troops engaged in repelling the massive Russian attacks in Donetsk, on the 'diplomatic' front there was yet another distant clash between Moscow and Washington. Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov, during a telephone conversation with Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin, warned the US of the \"danger of further escalation of the situation in connection with the ongoing supply\" of US weapons to the Ukrainian armed forces . The Kremlin then made it known that, at the moment, no telephone call is planned between Russian President Vladimir Putin and American President Joe Biden. ... On the battlefield, Moscow later reported that its army destroyed three US-made Himars multiple-launch rocket launchers and the \"foreign specialists\" operating them.Are they saying that American \"contractors\" are already in Ukraine?\nZelensky is going to deal with non-Urkanians \"shirking\" their \"duties\" to fight Russia with a \"hard fist\"? What?\nFunny this isn't being reported by the American media. BTW I didn't translate that. I wanted to, but it's hard, guys. It's the google translation. Italian is easy to hear and easy to speak, but it's much harder to read than French. My vocabulary is still molto poco.\nBoy, I remember when \"they're gonna provoke a nuclear war with Russia\" was Tucker Carlson Nutter Territory. Good times, good times. Posted by: Problem with conspiracy theories is that they keep being vindicated yes, I meant to admit that I was doubting this \"just the tip, just the tip\" escalation into actual war, but I was wrong. I was hurrying to get the post up. I'll add that admission now.

    "title": "Fiscalía de Ecuador abre investigación contra Roberto Canseco tras asalto a Embajada de México",
    "text": "QUITO.- La Fiscalía de Ecuador abrió una investigación contra Roberto Canseco, integrante de la misión diplomática de México en dicho país que intentó oponerse a la detención del ex vicepresidente Jorge Glas durante el asalto a la embajada mexicana. La indagatoria contra el diplomático mexicano surge a raíz de una denuncia formal por el presunto delito de obstrucción de la justicia. Durante el [asalto a la Embajada de México en Ecuador](https://www.yucatan.com.mx/mexico/2024/04/09/amlo-exhibe-video-sobre-asalto-a-embajada-de-mexico-en-ecuador.html), el diplomático se opuso a que las fuerzas policiales ecuatorianas sustrajeran a Jorge Glas, señalado por presunto peculado, de la sede diplomática. Investigan a Roberto Canseco en Ecuador De acuerdo con la Fiscalía de Ecuador, una denuncia formal contra Canseco por obstrucción de la justicia se presentó el pasado 16 de abril, de la cual fue informado apenas ayer miércoles 24 de abril. La denuncia fue presentada por Galo Monteverde y Milton Castillo, según la documentación del caso dada a conocer por Infobae. La Fiscalía indicó que cualquier ciudadano puede presentar una denuncia y que es su obligación recibirla, sin embargo, recalcó que Canseco cuenta con inmunidad diplomática. Por tal motivo su capacidad para proceder con la denuncia se ve reducida a únicamente informar a México sobre la existencia de la querella. “Al haber sido parte de una misión diplomática, goza – conforme lo dicta el derecho internacional – de inmunidad diplomática, por lo que la FGR no tiene facultad investigativa motivo”, señala el comunicado. “Se ha dispuesto que – a través de la Dirección de Asuntos Internacionales – dicha noticia del delito se ponga en conocimiento de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos, como corresponde”, agrega el comunicado. La Secretaría de Relaciones Exteriores (SRE) en México no ha respondido a la denuncia. México denuncia a Ecuador ante CIJ por asalto a embajada El gobierno de [México presentó una denuncia formal](https://www.yucatan.com.mx/mexico/2024/04/11/presentan-denuncia-formal-ante-la-cij-la-irrupcion-de-ecuador-en-la-embajada-de-mexico.html) ante la Corte Internacional de Justicia (CIJ) en la que exige suspender a Ecuador de las Naciones Unidas hasta que ofrezca una disculpa pública por el asalto a la embajada en Quito. “Nuestra demanda es contra el Estado de Ecuador, no contra ninguna persona en particular”, aclaró la canciller sobre la denuncia en La Haya. Al respecto, el presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) afirmó que la orden de asaltar la Embajada vino de forma directa del mandatario ecuatoriano, Daniel Noboa. “La población de Ecuador, su propio pueblo, tendrá que definir cuál es el futuro político de Noboa internamente”, señaló la canciller Alicia Bárcena durante la mañanera de AMLO el pasado 11 de abril. Fue el pasado 5 de abril cuando la policía en Quito irrumpió para detener al ex vicepresidente Jorge Glas, quien había recibido asilo político de México y es acusado por las autoridades ecuatorianas de corrupción. La [irrupción a la Embajada de México en Ecuador](https://www.yucatan.com.mx/mundo/2024/04/05/ecuador-detiene-a-jorge-glas-en-la-embajada-de-mexico.html) derivó en la ruptura de relaciones diplomáticas y la suspensión de las negociaciones del tratado de libre comercio con el gobierno ecuatoriano con el cual buscaban ingresar a la Alianza del Pacífico. “¿Qué consecuencias puede traer esto? Varias, en primer lugar el rechazo flagrante de todos los países, prácticamente de la comunidad internacional, no ha habido un solo país que se haya pronunciado en contra de lo que México está acusando”, expresó la canciller.

    "text": "DUISBURGO (dpa-AFX) - Los empleados de la división siderúrgica de Thyssenkrupp protestaron el jueves por la noche contra los recortes de empleo previstos con cruces de madera, velas y antorchas frente a la sede siderúrgica de la empresa en Duisburgo. Según el comité de empresa, unas 200 personas participaron en la \"acción de guerrilla visual\" de 30 minutos de duración. Cuatro hombres vestidos de negro portaban un ataúd con una muñeca en su interior. También se encendieron bengalas y cacerolas humeantes.\n\"Dar ejemplo\"\nLos empleados querían manifestarse con la acción a favor del futuro de la división siderúrgica, explicó el comité de empresa. En vísperas de una importante reunión del Consejo de Supervisión, querían \"dar ejemplo\", dijo Jens Burnicki, del Comité General de Empresa.\nEl Consejo de Supervisión del mayor productor siderúrgico alemán, Thyssenkrupp Steel Europe (TKSE), debatirá el viernes una reorganización fundamental. Para ser más competitivos, está prevista una reducción de la capacidad de producción, que también implicará recortes de plantilla. Sin embargo, se descartan los despidos por razones operativas. La división está a punto de independizarse. Sin embargo, aún se discuten los recursos financieros que la empresa matriz utilizará para independizar la división siderúrgica.\nEl comité de empresa ve peligro de insolvencia\nEl presidente del comité de empresa de la planta de Duisburg/Beeckerwerth, Ali Güzel, expresó el jueves por la noche su preocupación por que la empresa matriz no aporte dinero suficiente. \"El temor es que nos den la menor dote posible, para que al final del día el administrador concursal esté en la puerta\", dijo Güzel a los periodistas. \"El riesgo de insolvencia es muy alto\", continuó.\nSegún él, el encargo de otro peritaje sobre los recursos financieros necesarios de la división también figura en el orden del día de los supervisores del viernes. Las ideas previas de la dirección siderúrgica, del Consejo de Administración de Thyssenkrupp y de la cogestión seguían estando demasiado alejadas. Según Güzel, la parte de los trabajadores sólo aceptará un plan de empresa elaborado por la dirección siderúrgica cuando se haya aclarado la futura financiación.\nEn la división siderúrgica de Thyssenkrupp trabajan unas 27.000 personas, 13.000 de ellas en Duisburgo./tob/DP/he\nComparte Acceder al artículo original .\nAviso legal Aviso legal\nPóngase en contacto con nosotros para cualquier solicitud de corrección\nVolver © dpa-AFX - 2024",

    "text": "Thursday's EuroLeague action offered five Round 22 games: Anadolu Efes vs. Barcelona, Crvena Zvezda vs. Baskonia, ALBA vs. Bayern, Olympiacos vs. Maccabi, and Virtus vs. ASVEL. After two consecutive double-round weeks, the EuroLeague competition returned with Round 22 action. To kick things off, Anadolu Efes, coming off a sensational win against Virtus last Friday, continued its revival with a cruising 24-point victory over second-placed Barcelona. Rodrigue Beaubois dropped his season-high 21 points and dished out five assists. After that, Baskonia, led by coach Dusko Ivanovic, returned to Belgrade to take on former team Zvezda and secured a position in the Top 10. Markus Howard exploded for 17 points in the third quarter and finished with 32. Moving on to a German derby, where ALBA failed to claim consecutive wins for the first time this season, hosting Bayern. The latter team recovered after four consecutive losses in 2024. Later, Olympiacos, coming off two road losses in the latest double-round week, achieved redemption by comfortably beating Lorenzo Brown-less Maccabi.

    "text": "The Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota, are full of family fun, even in blustery weather. The Great Northern Festival runs Jan. 25-Feb. 4 and celebrates cold, creative winters. Immerse your crew in art experiences, outdoor adventures and climate education. Plus, the Mall of America is nearby with indoor rollercoasters and you can even dine at a James Beard Award-winning Indigenous restaurant.\nGetting to The Twin Cities\nMinneapolis/St. Paul is a 10-hour drive from the Detroit/Ann Arbor area. Take I-94 W to I-294 N, then I-90 W and I-94 W to Minneapolis.\nYou can break up the drive a number of ways by making interesting stops along the way:\n- Make it a rambling road trip and stop in Chicago and/or Rockford, Illinois, then Madison, Wisconsin Dells and/or Eau Claire, Wisconsin.\n- Another idea is to go over the top of Lake Michigan and visit Mackinac City and Escanaba, Michigan, before hitting Marinette and Wausau, Wisconsin, en route.\nWhat Families Love about the Twin Cities\nIt’s true that it gets quite cold during Minnesota winters, yet the people there have truly learned how to embrace the chill. The best example of that is\nThe Great Northern Festival, which is now headed up by a new executive director, Jovan C. Speller Rebollar, who is also a mother and an artist. “As a mom, I’m always looking for opportunities to activate my kids’ imaginations, excitement for life and the world we live in,” she says. “The Great Northern is dedicated to creating experiences where families can immerse in the winter spirit and celebrate local culture.”\nEnjoy the new signature event this year, Midwinter Melt. Halfway between winter and spring on Groundhog Day Feb. 2, families can kicksled, play cosmic footgolf, ice skate and view sparkling lights while roasting s’mores by a campfire.\nMelanin in Motion, a BIPOC movement towards motion in the outdoors, will host a reception with food and music. There are indoor and outdoor events throughout the 10-day festival, focused on art, community, culture and athletic activities. Sweat it out at the new Family Day Steam Sessions at Sauna Village, where ages 5 and up can sample 22 saunas and play outdoor games like cornhole and mega pong. Drink steamy cocoa on National Hot Chocolate Day at The Great Northern Ice Bar and snowshoe, cross-country ski, fat bike or skijor at Luminary Loppet. Mill City Museum boasts one of the coolest museum tours I’ve ever been on. What was once the world’s largest flour mill literally exploded from a fire. See the sights and hear the sounds of what it was like to work in the historic mill during its peak flour milling days on the Flour Tower tour. You can also view vintage advertising, sample breads and baked goods and play in the Water Lab.\nVisit the\nSt. Paul Winter Carnival for events like ice carving competitions, concerts and a parade. Take a gander at the free Ice Sculpture Park, where you can see huge shoes, hands and bears carved out of snow and ice. Afton Alps is a ski resort 25 minutes from St. Paul with 300 skiable acres, where you can even ski through a tunnel. If you’re wondering what to wear in the wintry tundra, Mill’s warm, Minnesota-made mittens come with a policy to replace a lost mitten for free, which definitely comes in handy with kids. Mall of America, the largest mall in the Western Hemisphere, is a 15-minute drive away. With more than 500 stores, 60 restaurants, an indoor amusement park and aquarium, it’s a great escape from the cold. My son loves the rollercoasters at Nickelodeon Universe. Buy a wristband to take full advantage of the seven acres of attractions. Fly through the mall with smiles spread across your faces on Pepsi Orange Streak, a perennial favorite coaster.\nWhere to Eat in the Twin Cities\nOwamni won the 2022 James Beard Award for Best New Restaurant. It is an Indigenous eatery serving true Native North American foods minus colonized ingredients like wheat flour, cane sugar and dairy. Located by the Minnehaha Falls, the mid-sized, modern restaurant can be a challenge to get into, but my son and I walked in right when it opened and were able to snag seats at the bar. Many of the staff members are Native Americans. The menu features seasonal plant, game and sweet dishes. My teen really enjoyed a snack mix featuring crickets while I preferred a savory bean dip. We were enamored with the beautiful elk poyha, which is like a meatloaf, topped with colorful flowers and a bright blueberry sauce. It was a wonderful dining and learning experience for us both. The Market at Malcom Yards is a food court bustling with delicious food and drink options. My son went wild for Wrecktangle Pizza, which is inspired by Detroit-style pizza, and I indulged in a few international dishes. You can choose from Japanese, Argentinian and Indian cuisines, to name a few. Wise Acre is a farm-to-fork restaurant serving fresh breakfasts and lunch. It also has a deli that’s open in the afternoons and hosts a dinner series, where you can book a special evening to indulge in a chef-driven meal to remember. Hell’s Kitchen is a super cool, employee-owned restaurant that hosts live music on the weekends. It’s decked out in a devilishly fun way and the menu boasts unique options like Huevos Rancheros “of the Gods,” Toasted Sausage Bread and a Ham and Pear Crisp sandwich. My son loved the crispy tater tots, which can come with a variety of toppings. I heard the peanut butter was worth buying as a gift, so I toted some home for my husband, only to eat it all myself.\nWhere to Stay in the Twin Cities\nRenaissance Minneapolis Hotel, The Depot is a beautiful hotel with an indoor heated pool and eclectic art scattered throughout. My son and I had fun finding adorable and historic statues around the hotel. Renaissance is downtown near the Stone Arch walking bridge, which crosses the Mississippi River, and the historic flour mill that’s now Mill City Museum. There are also a handful of accommodations with water parks in Bloomington, near the Mall of America.\n ",
