    "text": "Javi Guerra y Hugo Duro se ausentan del entrenamiento por enfermedad Los dos jugadores, que serán titulares el próximo martes ante el Villarreal, sufren un proceso gripal. La plantilla del Valencia no es ajena a los virus que asolan en estas semanas a media España. Esta mañana, de hecho, se han ausentado del entrenamiento dos jugadores que deben de ser titulares el próximo martes, en Mestalla, contra el Villarreal: Javi Guerra y Hugo Duro. Los dos futbolistas valencianistas sufren un proceso vírico-gripal que les ha impedido entrenarse esta mañana con el resto de sus compañeros, tras [hacerlo ayer por la tarde, en Mestalla](https://as.com/futbol/primera/gaya-de-regreso-ante-medio-mestalla-n/). No obstante, tanto el mediocentro, que regresa tras cumplir dos partidos de sanción, como el delantero centro, deben estar recuperados para afrontar el derbi de la Comunitat Valenciana el próximo martes, ante el Submarino. Como viene siendo habitual en los tres últimos meses, tampoco ha estado en la sesión André Almeida, quien tiene una fractura en una vértebra y no tiene fecha prevista de vuelta. Diakhaby ha sido el otro ausente, aunque el franco-guineano, que cumplirá su partido de sanción ante el Villarreal, ya no se le espera hasta finales de enero ya que se marcha a la Copa de África. En el plano positivo está de nuevo José Luis Gayà, que ha vuelto a entrenarse esta mañana con normalidad. El capitán, si no surge ningún contratiempo de última hora será de la partida ante el Villarreal tras tener que parar varios partidos por diversas molestias. El lateral ha trabajado a buen ritmo y ya es uno más del grupo.

UK's flag carrier British Airways reportedly cancelled 13 flights due to inclement weather. In Ireland, Dublin Airport remained unscathed, though Cork saw four diversions, to Dublin and Shannon, reported CNN. UK Met Office on Wednesday (December 27, 2023) predicted Storm Gerrit would bring strong winds and heavy rain to many parts of the UK on Wednesday, with wintry hazards also likely, especially across northern Scotland. Met Office Chief Meteorologist Frank Saunders had said: “Storm Gerrit will run towards western UK on Wednesday and bring with it potential impacts for much of the UK.\" “Winds across southern coastal areas of England will be strong, possibly peaking around 70 mph on exposed coastlines, but more widely around 50-60 mph within the warning area,\" Saundaers said.

    "text": "Developing an efficient material as a counter electrode (CE) with excellent catalytic activity, intrinsic stability, and low cost is essential for the commercial application of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Photovoltaic properties DSSCs fabricated with low-cost and platinum-free CEs based on different mixtures of carbon allotropes graphite (GR), activated carbon (AC) and PEDOT: PSS films. The DSSCs assembled with PEDOT: PSS/GR/AC showed an impressive photovoltaic conversion efficiency of 4.60%, compared to 4.06% for DSSCs with GR/AC CE or 1.66% for PEDOT: PSS alone or 6.56 % for Pt under the illumination 100 mW cm− 2 (AM 1.5 G) due to the superior electrocatalytic activity and the conductivity of AC and PEDOT: PSS. The fabricated carbon counter electrodes were extensively characterized by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry (CV), Tafel measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The CV, EIS and Tafel measurements indicated that the PEDOT: PSS/Graphite/AC composite film has low charge-transfer resistance on the electrolyte/CE interface and high catalytic activity for the reduction of triiodide to iodide than the GR/AC CEs. It is potentially feasible that such a carbon configuration can be used as a counter electrode, replacing the more expensive Pt in DSSCs.",

    "title": "‘May the 4th be with you’: How World War II influenced ‘Star Wars’",
    "text": "“By accident, a great deal [of J.R.R. Tolkien’s book series “The Lord of the Rings”] can be read topically,” Maj. Warren Lewis, brother to C.S. Lewis, wrote in possibly the first ever review of the novel in 1949. “The Shire standing for England, Rohan for France, Gondor the Germany of the future, Sauron for Stalin.”\nAnd while Tolkien later explicitly rejected the idea that his “story was an allegory of any historical event, most of all the recent war against Nazism … for all such protestations, Lewis had clearly been on to something back in 1949,” historian Alan Allport wrote in his 2020 book about the social and military history of the U.K. during World War II, “Britain at Bay.”\nRather than singularly weaving a mythopoeic fantasy world, Allport contended, Tolkien’s future audience “was going to see associations between events in Middle Earth and those in their own world.”\nTolkien, however, was not the first nor the last to draw inspiration from the cataclysmic bloodletting that was the Second World War.\nToday, as fans celebrate May the Fourth (be with you), one does not have to stray far to glean that the galaxy of “Star Wars” is rife with WWII-based allegories — and its fanbase might equal, if not surpass, Tolkien’s.\n“Star Wars” creator George Lucas famously studied over 25 hours of footage from\nWorld War II dogfights and jittery newsreel imagery while researching for the films — even using the footage as placeholders in the film before special effects were added.\n“So one second you’re with the Wookiee in the spaceship and the next you’re in ‘The Bridges at Toko-Ri.’ It was like, ‘George, what is going on?’” Willard Huyck, a screenwriter and personal friend of Lucas,\nstated in a 1997 interview.\nThough the b-roll was eventually edited out, the aerial tactics established in World War II remain visible.\nOne such shot, according to National WWII Museum and Memorial curator\nCorey Graff, “showed aircraft peeling out of formation and dropping from sight. The clip was used as a model for the memorable shot of Rebel craft diving to attack the Death Star. One at a time, the fictional spaceships elegantly ‘aileron roll’ across the screen, mimicking the movements of the 1940s aircraft almost exactly.”\nEntire books have been devoted to such analogies, but we’ve summed up a few of our favorites for some May the Fourth enjoyment.\nThe Millennium Falcon’s cockpit came from the Boeing B-29 Fortress\nAfter studying hours of WWII footage, Lucas became particularly enamored with the cockpit of B-29s — the famous bomber known for dropping the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.\nThe result? The cockpit of Han Solo’s beloved Millennium Falcon looks like it was lifted straight out of Boeing’s blueprints, replete with the B-29′s signature greenhouse-style cockpit. And, exactly like on the Superfortress, the Falcon sports defensive gun turrets — which come in handy when battling a Death Star.\nThe Empire’s similarities to Nazi Germany\nFrom stormtroopers to Imperial officers’ uniforms and even Darth Vader’s helmet, which resembles those worn by the Wehrmacht during WWII, the analogies between Nazi Germany and the Galactic Empire are not exactly subtle.\nThe gradual rise of Hitler from German chancellor to Nazi dictator is further mirrored in the rise of Darth Sidious, or Sheev Palpatine, from chancellor to world’s most in-need-of-facial-moisturizer emperor.\nDepictions of Star Wars spaceships were influenced by WWII fighters\nOnce again Lucas turned to World War II aviation for inspiration to give his spaceships unique sounds. According to Ian D’Costa for\nTacairnet, sounds couldn’t easily be synthesized in the same way studios can create movie sound effects today. To get around that, Lucas sent out sound designer Ben Burtt to Reno Air Races in Nevada, where he was allowed to record the noise of P-51 Mustangs racing overhead.\nBurtt later recalled, “I just said, ‘I want to record some planes,’ and they said ‘Yeah? Then go on out there.’ You could never do that nowadays. I was out at the pylons, and planes were passing 15 feet above my head. They were so fast that I could hardly see them go by; they were just a blur, though I could smell the oil and exhaust. ... Almost all of the spaceships came out of those Mojave recordings, including the Falcon.”\nThe Death Star trench run was inspired by the British Dambuster Raid\nLucas further drew inspiration from the 1955 film “The Dam Busters,” which chronicles the audacious British raid on Germany’s strategic river dams in 1943. The dams were heavily defended by anti-aircraft fire, a recurring theme in “Star Wars.”\n“The Death Star attack is all about combat in the face of desperate odds,” Graff wrote in\nSmithsonian Magazine in 2020. “It’s a clear homage to the epic air battles seen in movies from the 1950s and 1960s.”\nThe Rebels suffer catastrophic losses, and the Death Star raid, just like in 1943, teeters on the brink of failure, “until a pivotal moment when [the] Millennium Falcon comes diving out of the ‘sun,’ a trick as old as military aviation itself,” Graff concluded.\nClaire Barrett is the Strategic Operations Editor for Sightline Media and a World War II researcher with an unparalleled affinity for Sir Winston Churchill and Michigan football.",

Signos con buena suerte y salud Tauro Este es uno de los signos que tiene todo a su favor en lo profesional para obtener un aumento en su salario o un ascenso. Aunque los signos les piden no confiarse y continuar con el gran trabajo que han hecho hasta ahora y por el que han llamado la atención de personas importantes, pues no son los únicos que serán considerados para el crecimiento laboral que se aproxima.

Los astros les advierten sobre su salud, pues la mala alimentación que tienen podría pasarles factura en algo relacionado con su corazón. Virgo Aunque Virgo atraviesa por un buen momento en su vida personal, amorosa y familiar es probable que este día enfrenten un nuevo reto en su trabajo. Esto es algo que no deben ver como algo negativo, pues tienen todo para hacerle frente y está relacionado con la imaginación y la creativa que deberán colocar en un nuevo proyecto a su cargo. Libra En los últimos meses este signo ha gastado más de lo que puede pagar, algo sobre lo que le advierten los astros ante el poco esfuerzo que han mostrado en su lugar de trabajo. Por ello, les recuerdan la importancia de esforzarse ya que las cuentas de sus costoso estilo de vida podrían provocarle otros conflictos. Capricornio Este signo de Tierra podría experimentar un fuerte problema en su lugar de trabajo por diferencias en la forma de pensar con uno de sus compañeros, es importante que consideren que no se trata de algo personal y trata de mantener la cordura para evitar que el conflicto crezca logrando afectarlos de manera profesional. Piscis Piscis goza de una gran fortuna en los negocios y desde antes de comenzar el 2024 ya veía despegar su emprendimiento de manera favorable.

    "text": "Informe copernicus\nL’extensió global de gel marí arriba a la xifra més baixa des que hi ha registres\nA l’Àrtic, la superfície va ser un 8% inferior a la mitjana per a aquesta època, mentre que a l’Antàrtida va ser un 26% més baixa del que s’esperava.\nNo hi havia hagut mai tan poc gel al planeta com ara mateix. Segons revela l’últim informe del Servei de Canvi Climàtic de Copernicus (C3S), el gran termòmetre per entendre l’avançament de la crisi climàtica en el conjunt del planeta, al febrer l’extensió global del gel marí va arribar a un nou mínim històric. Les dades revelen que l’extensió diària del gel marí combinada, és a dir, la suma del gel a l’Àrtic i l’Antàrtida, va caure al seu nivell més baix des que van començar les observacions satel·litàries el 1978. A l’Àrtic, l’extensió del gel va ser un 8% inferior a la mitjana per a aquesta època, mentre que a l’Antàrtida va ser un 26% més baixa. \"És una de les moltes conseqüències de viure en un món cada cop més càlid\", avisa Samantha Burgess, del Centre Europeu de Predicció a Mitjà Termini (ECMWF). D’acord amb els registres, l’extensió del gel marí àrtic ja encadena tres mesos consecutius de mínims rècord, cosa que reforça les alertes sobre el seu progressiu declivi. Tot i així, els experts remarquen que el rècord del febrer no vol dir que estiguem davant un mínim absolut, ja que just en aquesta època el gel de la regió està en la fase de creixement estacional i s’espera que, si no hi ha més imprevistos, remuntarà aquest març i registrarà el seu valor més alt de l’any.",

    "text": "It was a night to forget for Declan Rice against his former club as West Ham put on a counter-attack clinic to win 2-0 at the Emirates Stadium. Tomas Soucek put the Hammers in front in the first half when Jarrod Bowen managed to keep the ball in play at the byline and find the Czech international who fired it into an empty goal. Then in the second half, former Arsenal centre-back Konstantinos Mavropanos came back to haunt the Gunners as the Greek international sprung in the air to meet James Ward-Prowse’s effortless corner delviery to make it 2-0. Another highlight of the night came when Brazilian left-back Emerson tricked his way past his former teammate Rice, who could not get anywhere near him after being misdirected with wonderful trickery. Emerson sending Declan out for a hot dog x [pic.twitter.com/lMHWBfREph] — West Ham Xtra (@WestHamXtra) [December 28, 2023] Rice also compounded his miserable game when he conceded a penalty right in front of the away supporters that once adored him.
