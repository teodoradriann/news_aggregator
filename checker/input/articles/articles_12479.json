    "text": "It’s an inevitable part of Christmas. With joy in the air and mistletoe hanging, we’ll inevitably see some more engagement rings featured on our social media timelines. It is the most wonderful time of the year after all!\nBut just how much do you spend on an engagement ring?\nTo give you some idea, Bespoke Diamonds Ireland have published the results of their latest survey which shows exactly how much, on average, each county in Ireland spends.\nWhile the average spend in Wexford put us third lowest in Ireland, the Model County also saw one lucky couple spend the third highest amount on a single engagement ring.\nNationally, the average spend on an engagement ring comes in at €4,810. Wexford’s spend comes in less than that at €3,557. Only Kilkenny (€3,465) and Roscommon (€3,458) saw a lower average spend.\nThe average diamond carat weight for a ring in Wexford was 1.1ct.\nThe county with the highest average spend in Ireland was Galway with €6,425, followed by Cork (€6,325) and Limerick (€5,325).\nThere was some retribution for Wexford, however, as the Model County saw the third most expensive ring purchased according to Bespoke Diamonds’ data.\nThe most expensive ring purchased in the country was in Cork for €52,000. This was followed by a €39,500 ring in Dublin and then a €31,000 ring purchased by a couple in Wexford.\nThe happy Wexford spent big on a “bespoke designed three stone engagement ring with a natural oval centre stone and a complimenting stone on each side”.\nThe figures published by Bespoke Diamonds shows that an oval cut diamond remains the most popular and that 51% of rings are chosen by couples, while the man/one partner makes the choice in 49% of cases.\nGet ahead of the day with the morning headlines at 7.30am and Fionnán Sheahan’s exclusive take on the day’s news every afternoon, with our free daily newsletter.",

    "text": "Nova Scotia and New Brunswick have signed memorandums of understanding to remove trade barriers between themselves and Ontario.\nA news release from the Ontario government says these agreements will bolster interprovincial trade.\n“Ontario will also work with Nova Scotia and with New Brunswick on a framework for direct-to-consumer alcohol (DTC) sales, so that producers have easier access to new market opportunities, and so that consumers have greater choice and access to a broader selection of alcoholic beverages,” the release says. “This collaboration will enhance economic resilience, create job opportunities and set a precedent for other provinces to follow.”\nIn February, Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston introduced legislation to help remove trade barriers and spur greater investments opportunities with other Canadian provinces and territories who pass similar legislation.\nHouston said “The Free Trade and Mobility within Canada Act” is meant to signal to other Canadian jurisdictions that Nova Scotia is “open for business.”\n“This legislation just makes sense,” said Houston, who is also the minister of Trade for the province. “It will allow goods and services to be sold in Nova Scotia without further testing or red tape and puts trust in other provinces and territories that have appropriate requirements to keep people safe.”\nThe act is reciprocal and requires other provinces to agree to terms and pass similar legislation, which Ontario Premier Doug Ford indicated he’s on board with at the time.\n“There is a goal, a challenge, that has been laid down across the country of free trade in Canada, full free trade in Canada, and across Canada by Canada Day. I don’t know if we’ll make that goal, but Nova Scotia is all in,” said Houston.\nOn Wednesday the Ontario government said it would introduce the “Protect Ontario through Free Trade within Canada Act,” which focuses on labour mobility and free trade.\nInterprovincial exports contribute to roughly 17 per cent of Nova Scotia’s gross domestic product and with trade to other provinces being valued at nearly $29 billion in 2023.\n“Today we’re taking a historic step forward to protect and unify our country ... to build on Canada’s economy by tearing down internal trade barriers. The cost to these barriers to our economy is absolutely enormous,” said Ford.\nRobert Huish, an international development studies associate professor at Halifax’s Dalhousie University, closely studies sanctions and tariffs. He says Wednesday’s agreement is a good first step.\n“These tariffs aren’t necessarily intentional to try and reduce trade between provinces, but they are there and they are having an impact,” said Huish.\nWhile legislation is key to reducing trade barriers, Huish says Canada lacks the infrastructure to support seamless trade across the country.\n“We do not have a rail or highway network that connects the country anywhere near to what the United States does,” he said.\nNew Brunswick\nIn a separate news release, New Brunswick Premier Susan Holt said knocking down interprovincial trade barriers is one of “the four pillars” of the province’s response to U.S. tariffs.\n“Ontario is New Brunswick’s second-biggest trading partner, and we are excited to be building on the positive momentum to reduce internal trade barriers across Canada,” said Holt. “Today’s signing of this bilateral memorandum of understanding commits both jurisdictions to enhance direct-to-consumer alcohol sales and improve interprovincial labour mobility.\n“It will also encourage the free flow of goods, services and investment, all while maintaining and strengthening public safety.”\nLast month, the New Brunswick government introduced amendments to the “Fair Registration Practices in Regulated Professions Act” that, if passed, would allow workers in regulated professions to start working in new jurisdictions during the registration process.\nPrince Edward Island\nEarlier this month, the Prince Edward Island government introduced the “Interprovincial Trade and Mobility Act,” which is similar to Nova Scotia’s legislation.\n“Leaders across the country are expressing interest in removing trade barriers, and I’m very pleased that P.E.I. and Ontario have tabled legislation to remove all their trade barriers,” said Houston. “This is a significant moment for our country, and these actions say a lot about our commitment to make our economies stronger.”",

    "text": "Temperatures are expected to fall as low as minus 8C overnight as a week-long spell of wintry conditions hits the UK.The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has issued cold weather health alerts for all of England ahead of a week of low temperatures.Amber alerts have been issued from 12pm on Thursday until January 8, meaning a rise in deaths, particularly among those aged 65 and over or with health conditions, is likely, the UKHSA said.Temperatures had been expected to fall as low as minus 8C in rural Scotland and northern England on Thursday night.The Met Office also forecast cold weather in parts of Wales and rural spots in southern England, with between minus 4C and minus 5C expected.Dan Stroud, a meteorologist at the Met Office, said: “There’ll be widespread frost across the country (overnight), from Land’s End to John O’Groats.“It will be comfortably below where we should be for this time of year and I would expect temperatures to hit minus 8C in parts of Scotland.”Mr Stroud confirmed conditions should become warmer by the end of this weekend before cold weather strikes again early next week.He said: “The second half of the weekend should be in the high singles or low doubles.“But temperatures will dive again next week, particularly on Monday and Tuesday.“They should start to improve towards the latter end of the week. But there’s a lot of water to go under the bridge until then.”The NHS Black Country integrated care board has warned the public to “avoid going out early when the frost is thick or late at night when it’s dark”, adding people should keep hands free and wear shoes with a good grip.In Herefordshire, the Wye Valley NHS Trust told people to “have sufficient food and medicine and take measures to reduce draughts in your home”.Age UK director Caroline Abrahams said the Government’s decision to limit the winter fuel allowance to only the poorest pensioners will be put “into sharp relief” by the cold snap.Ms Abrahams said the charity had already been contacted by older people “worrying about what to do when this moment arrived”.From this winter, only people on pension credit or certain other benefits will receive the winter fuel payments while more than nine million others are set to be stripped of the allowance.The charity director said: “We urge older people to do everything they can to stay warm, even if that means risking spending more on their heating than they feel they can afford.“The energy companies are under an obligation to help if you are struggling and there may be support available from your local council too.”Meanwhile, fresh weather warnings have been issued by the Met Office for ice ahead of a blast of snow over the weekend.The yellow warning indicates there could be icy surfaces in northern and western Scotland, the north-west of England and Northern Ireland.It will remain in place from 5pm on Thursday until 10am on Friday morning, and could make for difficult travelling conditions, the forecaster warned.A snow and ice warning is also in place covering parts of northern Scotland between 4pm on Thursday and 10am on Friday.A yellow warning is in place from noon on Saturday until 9am on Monday and covers all regions of England, other than the South West, the majority of Wales and parts of southern Scotland.About 5cm of snow is expected widely across the Midlands, Wales and northern England, with as much as 20-30cm over high ground in Wales and the Pennines, the forecaster added.Strong winds could lead to snow drifts in some areas, and freezing rain as temperatures creep up could add to the risk of ice.Met Office meteorologist Tom Morgan said: “At the moment we’ve issued a very large snow warning for Saturday until Monday but it doesn’t mean that everywhere within that warning could see snow, it’s just a heads-up there could be some impacts.”On Thursday, London councils activated an emergency accommodation protocol for people sleeping rough in freezing conditions.The emergency measures, which see extra beds made available, have been active for three nights so far this winter.A major incident declared in Greater Manchester on Wednesday because of flooding has been stood down, with emergency services and partners now focusing on recovery efforts.There have been no casualties or reports of serious injuries.",

Lana will be granted as a legendary card to all players as of January 1.\nStarting January 15, players can anticipate the debut of Electric Monk, a magic-type beast faction unit. Electric Monk's special ability, Electric Blast, creates a magnetic field on critical hits, affecting the surrounding area.

    "title": "Higher quality of life reported among children who feel they are being heard: Japan study - The Mainichi",
    "text": "TOKYO -- Children who are often asked how they are feeling or what their opinions are by adults tend to have a higher quality of living even under adverse circumstances, according to a survey conducted by Japan's National Center for Child Health and Development. The latest finding suggests that accepting children in a positive manner affects their mental and physical health. The survey was conducted by mail during the COVID-19 pandemic in December 2020 by sending the questionnaires to 1,500 households with fifth graders and second-year junior high school students. It asked whether children felt their thoughts about changes in daily life due to the pandemic were being heard by those around them. According to the results, 52.9% of children reported that their thoughts and feelings were either \"often\" or \"always\" listened to and considered by both their parents and teachers. However, 24.6% of children responded that they were not listened to by either group of the adults. The survey found that the proportion of children with above-median quality of life was about five times higher among those who said their voices were being heard compared to those who felt they weren't. The U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child that recognizes children's rights stipulates that \"Children have the right to give their opinions freely on issues that affect them. Adults should listen and take children seriously.\" Dr. Arisa Yamaguchi from the Department of Social Medicine at the National Center for Child Health and Development, who led the study, stated, \"It's important for children to feel that various types of people are listening to them in their daily lives. I hope more people will understand the significance of listening carefully to children's voices.\" (Japanese original by Natsumi Hara, Tokyo City News Department)",

    "text": "UFC MMA ¿Por qué Paddy Pimblett es uno de los peleadores más odiados de la UFC? Paddy Pimblett se presentará en su casa y allí estará más resguardado, pero aún así seguirá siendo el luchador menos querido en la UFC.\nTom Aspinall entrena con gasolina para UFC 304 El motivo de los números en UFC Por Lucas Lescano\n25/07/2024 - 15:55hs CST\nwhatsapp 25/07/2024 - 15:55hs CST\n© IMAGO/ZUMA Wire Paddy Pimblett no es querido en el mundo de la UFC ni por sus compañeros ni por el público. Por Lucas Lescano\nEn el mundo del deporte, es más que normal ver como entre los protagonistas se dicen cosas para buscar sacarse de situación y que alguien caiga en la trampa de la provocación para que cometa algún error en su plan de la búsqueda de la victoria. Lo que sucede en el mundo de la UFC , es que hay un protagonista que es poco querido por sus fuertes dichos que en reiteradas ocasiones no han caído nada bien .\nSe trata de Paddy Pimblett (21-3-0). El inglés, que estará presente este sábado 27 de Julio en UFC 304 enfrentando al estadounidense Bobby Green, es un personaje al cual las críticas son lo que le sobran y uno de sus mayores enemigos es el español, actual campeón del peso pluma,, Ilia Topuria .\nver también\n¿Por qué Tom Aspinall moja sus nudillos en nafta en sus entrenamientos previo a pelear por UFC?\nDe los brutales dichos de Paddy Pimblett a la respuesta de Ilia Topuria A veces, los dichos por querer calentar un combate o tratar de acercarse a uno se pueden ir de las manos y este fue el caso de Pimblett, quien se metió directamente con la nación georgiana y con los ataques que sufren por parte del gobierno ruso. “Qué estúpidos son estos georgianos, tío. Con razón los rusos aterrorizan sus vidas” , disparó el inglés de manera agrevisa.\nEstos dichos generaron que a Pimblett se lo mire de reojo entre el resto de sus compañeros y, de hecho, no tiene una gran relación con muchos de ellos, sino más bien una cordialidad meramente profesional que se queda en un simple estrechamiento de manos o hasta en un solo cruce de miradas .\nTopuria, por su parte, no perdonó para nada esto y se puso como objetivo destruir a Pimblett cuando se lo encuentre. Sucede que para el español no es un rival al que quiera enfrentar por la diferencia que existe hoy en día entre el nivel de uno y el del otro, pero, aún así, el dueño del cinturón declaró en varias oportunidades que, donde se lo cruce, se armaría un verdadero escándalo .\n“Me tomo cada pelea como un profesional, miro a todos mis rivales como un profesional, pero con él, es personal. Si le viese en el supermercado, le aplastaría ahí mismo “, afirmó Topuria con furia.\nPublicidad Publicidad Paddy Pimblett quiere mostrarle a la UFC que tiene nivel para ganarse una pelea de las grandes. (IMAGO)\nPoco le importa esto Paddy, quien jamás se ha preocupado por agradar sino más bien por ser un showman para la empresa con el fin de alcanzar las mejores peleas, algo que no ha sucedido tal y como él esperaba. Este enfrentamiento en el Reino Unido ante Bobby Green será uno que le permita volver a escena (su última pelea fue en diciembre con victoria por decisión ante Tony Ferguson) con la mira en mostrar que todavía puede dar pelea.\nver también\n¿Qué significan los números de los eventos de UFC? La explicación detrás del misterio\nLo primero, para él, será ganar este fin de semana, posteriormente seguir subiendo posiciones y, a partir de allí, ver si en un futuro se pueda llegar a organizar un duelo con Topuria. Claro, todo esto está muy lejos y parece utópico, pero no imposible.\nPublicidad Publicidad Lucas Lescano Redactor en Futbol Sites, cubriendo el boxeo y todo lo que lo rodea.

    "title": "Michelle Pfeiffer reveals ’80s movie audition left her “humiliated”",
    "text": "The 1980s were mostly a great time for\nMichelle Pfeiffer. She established herself as one of the most reliable stars in Hollywood with her best ’80s movies, including the crime thriller movie Scarface and the fantasy movie The Witches of Eastwick.\nBut before she had made her name as one of the\nbest actors around, Pfeiffer had an excruciating interview for her breakout role – a sequel to one of the best musicals of all time.\nPfeiffer played one of the main roles in Grease 2 as Stephanie Zinone, the leader of the Pink Ladies at Rydell High. But before she got the role, she worried that she’d blown her chances in the final stage of the audition process.\nLooking back on the 1982\nteen movie, Pfeiffer told Entertainment Weekly that the last phase was the dancing portion of the audition, and things started to go wrong for her.\n“It literally was like you see in the movies where one line would come and they would dance across the stage and then the next line would come and they would dance across the stage. I kept moving further to the back, so I ended up in the very last line and stumbled my way through because I couldn’t remember the choreography. I left with my tail between my legs, feeling so humiliated.”\nIt clearly hadn’t gone as badly as Pfeiffer thought, though. She said: “Somebody’s assistant, I think it was [director] Pat Birch’s assistant, ran after me across the Paramount studio lot. I said something about being really embarrassed and she said: ‘Well, you shouldn’t be because she wants you to come back tomorrow’.”\nPfeiffer ended up getting the role, of course, and it paved the way for her\nbest movies and subsequent success. By the end of the decade, she was a box office sensation and had secured a nomination at the Oscars. Not bad for someone who nearly blew a dance audition.",
