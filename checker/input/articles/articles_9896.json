    "text": "LG xboom Buds deals £119.99 £74.98 View We check over 250 million products every day for the best prices powered by If you're in the market for a pair of the best earbuds , the sheer volume of options on the market can be quite intimidating. There's an option for every style, budget and use case, which can quickly become overwhelming.\nIf that sounds like you, you're in the right place. Here at T3, we've been reviewing the cutting edge of audio equipment for almost 30 years, with the current team enjoying more than a century of combined experience in the industry.\nRecently, I've been testing the LG xBoom buds – a pair of more affordable earbuds which were tuned by legendary Black Eyed Peas singer, will.i.am. Do they offer enough to set them apart? There's only one way to find out. Let's get it started!\nBest picks for you\nBest noise cancelling headphones 2025: ace ANC from Bose, Sony, Apple and more\nBest wired headphones 2025: perfect picks for every price point\nBest soundbars for LG TVs 2025: Upgrade your LG TV's sound LG xBoom buds review: Price and availability The LG xBoom buds retail for £119.99 in the UK. Other markets can pick up the buds for €129 / US$110. There is currently no listing for the buds on the Australian version of the site.\nThe buds were unveiled early in 2025, with the first units hitting the market later in the year.\n(Image credit: Sam Cross) LG xBoom buds review: Design and Features First things first, let's talk design. These buds certainly aren't the worst looking things out there, though you'd probably struggle to pick them out of a lineup, too.\nPerfectly middle-of-the-road, and rather unassuming on the whole, you'll enjoy these if you're not into the showier side of life. The case is also nicely done, with a small footprint which your bag or pocket will enjoy profusely.\nFortunately, there's a lot more to shout about in the features than in the design stakes. That starts with the drivers, which are graphene-coated to reduce distortion.\nElsewhere, you'll find IPX4 water resistance, making these a solid pick for those who wear earbuds at the gym, or out in the rain. They should last well, too, with 10 hours of listening on a single charge, and a further 20 hours from the case.\nANC is also on offer, with up to 35dB slated on the spec sheet. And of course, the audio performance has been tuned by will.i.am – so you'd hope they sound pretty darn good.\n(Image credit: Sam Cross) LG xBoom buds review: Performance In the ear, you'll first be wowed by the xBoom buds' sonic performance. Audio quality is stellar no matter what you're pumping through them.\nBass response is definitely given a little more attention here, with low end rumble neatly controlled and punchy. It might leaving you thinking, \"where is the love (for treble frequencies)?\", but fear not – the overall profile is agreeable, and the app allows for a good degree of customisation for those so inclined.\nIt's not the prettiest app in the world, but it does get the job done. You'll have access to the noise cancellation, EQ settings and other settings adjustment in the app, which means you can keep tabs on just about every aspect of the experience.\nSpeaking of the noise cancellation, that's one place where I'd mark these down. It's okay, but it's nothing worth writing home about – if you've used a proper pair of noise cancelling buds, you'll notice the difference quickly.\n(Image credit: Sam Cross) LG xBoom buds review: Verdict In short, if you want killer earbuds without busting the bank, the LG xBoom buds are well worth your attention. Audio quality is stellar, with a sonic profile that really doesn't need much fiddling to get to your liking.\nANC performance does let it down slightly, but it's never going to be perfect at this price point. Personally, I'd rather have better sound quality than ANC, so it's far from a dealbreaker.\nLG xBoom buds review: Also Consider If you're shopping in the circa £100 region, the Nothing Ear is worth a listen. The technology start up has always had strong value in its earbuds, and these are no different.\nElsewhere, the OnePlus Buds 3 – or indeed the recently released and yet to be reviewed Buds 3 – are a killer option, with a great blend of sound quality and ANC performance.\nA classic pick in this price range is the Sony WF-C710N . Those are the safe bet for most people, and will serve up decent competition here.\nLG xboom Buds: Price Comparison £119.99 £74.98 View We check over 250 million products every day for the best prices powered by Sign up to the T3 newsletter for smarter living straight to your inbox Get all the latest news, reviews, deals and buying guides on gorgeous tech, home and active products from the T3 experts\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors By submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\nSam Cross Social Links Navigation\nSenior Staff Writer Sam is an award-winning journalist with over six years of experience across print and digital media.
