    "text": "Business Operations\nSeventy Percent of Manufacturers Still Enter Data Manually\nManufacturers are deluged by data. As companies adopt more advanced technologies, they are increasingly overwhelmed by the quantities of raw data that must be collected, analyzed and put to use.\nIndeed, a new survey from the Manufacturing Leadership Council—the NAM’s digital transformation arm—reveals that 70% of manufacturers still collect data manually. Here are some highlights from the survey, which reveals where manufacturers need to improve, and how they’re planning to do it.\nExponential data growth: While the survey’s respondents report an explosion of new data, they also expect to keep on top of it over the next few years.\n- Forty-four percent of manufacturing leaders have seen at least a doubling of the amount of data they collect in their organization today compared to two years ago.\n- While many manufacturers still lack standardized data due to operating a mix of older equipment and systems along with newer technologies, more than half expect that their data will be in a standardized format by 2030.\nAnalytical improvements: How are manufacturers planning to use all this new data?\n- Nearly 60% of respondents say they are focused on understanding their operations with an eye toward optimizing them in the future.\n- While 30% of manufacturers say they are using manufacturing data to predict operational performance, another 60% say that predictivity will be a primary objective by 2030.\nBetter decisions: Manufacturers use data to make better, more proactive decisions, according to the survey. Today, these decisions are made at a relatively high level.\n- Seventy-seven percent of respondents said that the responsibility to employ data in decision-making falls to plant leaders and managers.\n- Only 33% said that factory floor employees held that responsibility—a percentage that might grow as manufacturers seek to empower frontline employees with greater decision-making ability.\nLooking ahead: As artificial intelligence and other emerging digital technologies become more established, they will likely reshape many if not all aspects of manufacturing operations.\n- Thanks to advanced sensors and robust data networks connecting equipment and machinery, manufacturers will collect copious data in real time and act on it almost as swiftly.\nRead more: To get a deeper look at the current state of data mastery in manufacturing, download the full survey,\nData Mastery: A Key to Industrial Competitiveness.

    "text": "Le masse d'aria più fredde ed instabili concluderanno la loro corsa nel bacino del Mediterraneo, tuffandosi direttamente dalla Porta del Rodano e scavando un vero e proprio ciclone sui nostri mari: per questo motivo è lecito attendersi una fase decisamente movimentata per Natale e Santo Stefano, con elevata probabilità di precipitazioni su tante regioni.\nVisto il calo delle temperature, inoltre, non escludiamo la possibilità di neve fino a quote piuttosto basse (se non addirittura in pianura) specie al Nord; di questo avremo modo di parlarne nei prossimi giorni, molto dipenderà dall'aria fredda in ingresso e da dove di formeranno i minimi depressionari.\nSuccessivamente, in vista degli ultimi giorni del 2024, l'ipotesi dei Centri di Calcolo è quella di una rimonta anticiclonica, con maggiore stabilità atmosferica ed il ritorno delle nebbie al Centro-Nord.\nSe ancora non è possibile dare delle previsioni di dettaglio, ciò che possiamo affermare con discreta attendibilità è che potremmo assistere ad un calo delle temperature con valori in linea con il periodo, se non al di sotto.",

    "text": "LOS ANGELES (TNND) — Actress and comedian Amy Schumer is crediting Internet trolls for helping her figure out she had Cushing syndrome.\nShe shared the news during the Jan. 22 episode of the hit podcast \"Call Her Daddy.\"\n“A year ago, the Internet really came for me,” Schumer told Alex Cooper, who is the show's host.\nIn February 2024, Schumer called out people on social media who ridiculed her for what she described as her \"puffier than normal appearance.\"\nAt the time, she said she had a \"moon face.\" She also said she was diagnosed with endometriosis, which the World Health Organization (WHO) classifies as a disease that causes tissue similar to the lining of the uterus to grow outside the uterus. It often causes pain in the pelvis and makes it harder for a woman to get pregnant.\nThere are some medical and hormonal things going on in my world right now but I’m okay,\" Schumer previously wrote on Instagram. Schumer joked about all the \"input about my face\" and sarcastically noted that she has \"enjoyed feedback and deliberation about my appearance\" for almost 20 years.\nNow, she's grateful for the feedback, saying medical professionals also offered advice.\n“Doctors were chiming in in the comments and they were, like, 'No, no something's really up. Your face looks so crazy,'\" Schumer told Cooper.\nSchumer went on to say she was then diagnosed with Cushing’s syndrome, which the Mayo Clinic said occurs when the body has too much of the hormone cortisol over an extended period of time.\n\"This can result from the body making too much cortisol, or from taking medicines called glucocorticoids, which affect the body the same way as cortisol,\" according to the Mayo Clinic. \"Too much cortisol can cause some of the main symptoms of Cushing syndrome —--a fatty hump between the shoulders, a rounded face, and pink or purple stretch marks on the skin. Cushing syndrome also can cause high blood pressure or bone loss. Sometimes, it can cause type 2 diabetes.\" The Mayo Clinic said treatments help lower the body's cortisol levels and improve symptoms.\n\"The sooner treatment starts, the better the chances for recovery,\" according to the Mayo Clinic.\nFor Schumer, her treatment started about a year ago, which was right after her diagnosis.\n“At first, I was like, \"F--- off,'\" Schumer said during her interview with Cooper.\nBut then she remembered something important: she had been getting steroid injections for scars related to a breast reduction and C-section after giving birth to her son, Gene, in 2019.\n“I was getting these steroid injections, and so it gave me this thing called Cushing syndrome -- which I wouldn't have known if the Internet hadn't come for me so hard,” Schumer told Cooper.\nSchumer, in her Instagram post, said while she feels \"a woman doesn’t need any excuse for her physical appearance and owes no explanation,\" she wanted to advocate for self love.\n\"Like every other women/person some days I feel confident and good as hell and others I want to put a bag over my head,\" she wrote.",
