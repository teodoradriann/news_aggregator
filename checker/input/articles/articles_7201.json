    "text": "Fusion record\nThe energy supply of the future is at a crossroads. Fossil fuels are being phased out, climate change is putting political and technological systems under pressure, and traditional renewable energies alone are reaching their limits when it comes to base load capacity and storage problems. In this context, nuclear fusion is often seen as a savior – an almost inexhaustible, CO₂-neutral source of energy that neither leaves behind long-lasting radioactive waste nor carries the risks of traditional nuclear fission. But the road to this goal was and is rocky. For decades, the promise of fusion was considered “ready for the market in 30 years”, a running joke among physicists.",

El Síndic de Greuges, Ángel Luna, se pronuncia en estos términos en la resolución publicada el pasado 25 de junio (documento completo al final de la información) en respuesta a una queja planteada por la concejala de Compromís Eva Coscollá, al considerar que se habían vulnerado sus derechos a la obtención de información al haber dirigido la mencionada pregunta a alcaldía sin haber obtenido la información requerida. La pregunta pretende fiscalizar si la alcaldesa de València, María José Catalá, con una compatibilidad en vigor para dar clases en la Universidad Internacional de València (VIU) que privatizó en su etapa como consellera de Educación, cumple con las horas de docencia que tiene autorizadas según esa compatibilidad que le permite mantener el 100% de su sueldo como primera edil.",

    "text": "Los Ángeles, 8 ago (EFE).- El congresista Rubén Gallego, candidato demócrata al Senado por Arizona, dijo este jueves que el Gobierno del presidente Joe Biden no ha brindado el apoyo suficiente para combatir el calor extremo.\nEn un comunicado el congresista hispano manifestó que \"la Administración habla mucho y no hace nada cuando se trata del calor extremo en Arizona\", que supera a diario los 40 grados centígrados (105 Fahrenheit).\nEl secretario del Departamento de Salud y Servicios Humanos, Xavier Becerra reconoció este miércoles en una visita Phoenix (Arizona) que el calor extremo es una crisis de salud pública que está causando nuevos desastres naturales que deben abordarse en leyes y políticas federales.\nEn respuesta Gallego dijo que desde la Casa Blanca \"se pide a los residentes de Arizona que hagan más, pero se niega a asumir un papel activo\".\nEl congresista demócrata aseguró que cuando hay huracanes o tornados, los funcionarios federales ofrecen recursos, \"pero con el calor solo ofrecen consejos\".\nEl secretario Becerra admitió que las normas federales como la Ley Stafford de Ayuda en Desastres y Asistencia de Emergencia, todavía \"parecen centradas\" en desastres como inundaciones, fuertes lluvias, huracanes y frío extremo, y no en problemas como la exposición al calor y la necesidad de lidiar con un número creciente de incendios forestales.\n\"El Congreso tendrá que analizar esto principalmente para asegurarse de que los estatutos aborden la realidad actual\", señaló Becerra.\nLas autoridades de Arizona investigan 322 muertes ocurridas este año hasta el pasado 13 de julio posiblemente relacionadas con el calor en el condado de Maricopa, el cuarto más poblado de Estados Unidos.\nPor ahora se han confirmado 23 muertes este año vinculadas con el calor en el condado de Maricopa, casi el doble de las registradas el año pasado hasta esta fecha.\nEl peligro por el calor sofocante ha impulsado a la fiscal de Arizona, Kris Mayes, a renovar su llamado para que la Agencia Federal para el Manejo de Emergencias (FEMA) reconozca el calor extremo como elegible para declaraciones de desastre mayor.
