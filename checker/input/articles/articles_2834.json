    "text": "The Coronavirus Pandemic and learning loss is a topic often discussed, and one still impacting many students. One group of children still dealing with those difficulties are the ones who were not yet in school when the pandemic began. \"He mostly just struggles in most of the aspects,\" said Victoria, a mom of three. \"He’s just a little bit behind.” Victoria is talking about one of her sons, who was too young for school at the start of the pandemic. \"He actually didn’t go through a full year of school until second grade,\" Victoria said. \"It’s been rough but he’s finally catching up but there’s still a lot of catchup that I’ve noticed.” \"If you think about it, they didn’t see the facial expressions that we learned by,\" said Jan Wilson, a grandparent. \"They were missing all of that, and I think every grandchild was affected by that.\" Pre-K to first graders in 2020 may have missed a critical window during which foundational skills develop, according to recent research from Curriculum Associates . \"They should’ve been picking up words, sounds, and reading books and reading with another adult to understand books,\" said Georgetown ISD Superintendent Dr. Devin Padavil. \"It was during the pandemic when everyone was wearing masks.\" This can lead to compounded gaps in learning over time. \"We have a lot of kids that are still behind on fundamental reading skills that we are working hard to catch up on,\" Dr. Padavil stated. \"Coming out of COVID we saw the dip,\" said San Marcos CISD Superintendent Dr. Michael Cardona. \"We knew the dip was gonna come back. COVID really took us for a loop.” ALSO| UT faculty report criticizes handling of pro-Palestine protests on campus From San Marcos CISD to Georgetown ISD, school districts we spoke with agree: that learning loss from the COVID-19 pandemic might still be around, but they have seen an increase in students’ abilities to learn at pre-pandemic levels. \"We have a lot of glimmers of hope and optimism when it comes to student learning,\" said Dr. Padavil. Research shows school and life after school get harder if a student cannot read on grade level by the third grade, according to Dr. Padavil. He said Georgetown ISD is focused on improving elementary literacy. \"We have a priority to see every student read and write on grade level because we know that strong readers and writers succeed in all of their other classes,\" said Dr. Padavil. Over at San Marcos CISD, Dr. Cardona said progress was made last year. \"The state went down in many areas, but we went up,\" he said. \"It kind of highlights the work teachers are doing, but we have a lot of work to do still.”",

    "title": "MDMA-Assisted Therapy Shows Significant Positive Response on Self-Experience in Patients With PTSD",
    "text": "Lykos Therapeutics recently received priority review of MDMA-assisted therapy for patients with PTSD. Check out the latest research update here! According to new research, midomafetamine capsules (MDMA) may enhance treatment efficacy by improving problems of self-experience that are associated with treatment resistance. In particular, MDMA-assisted therapy has shown significant positive response on the processes of self-experience in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) when compared with therapy plus placebo.1 In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-site phase 3 clinical trial of participants with severe PTSD, MDMA-assisted therapy induced significant positive change in the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 when compared with therapy plus placebo. Investigators evaluated the effects of MDMA-assisted therapy and therapy plus placebo on 3 transdiagnostic outcome measures, then examined how the changes in self-experience improved PTSD scores. Approximately 90 participants were randomized to receive manualized therapy with either MDMA or placebo (MDMA-assisted therapy, n = 46; therapy plus placebo, n = 44) during 3 experimental sessions. Of those participants, 84.4% (76/90) had history of developmental trauma and 87.8% (79/90) had suffered multiple traumas. Investigators visited participants 3 times in preparation and 9 times for integration therapy. Symptoms were measured at baseline and 2 months after the last experimental session using 3 different scales: (1) 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20); (2) the 26-item Self Compassion Scale (SCS); and (3) the 63-item Inventory of Altered Self-Capacities (IASC). MDMA-assisted therapy generated statistically significant greater improvement on the TAS-20, the SCS, and most IASC factors of interpersonal conflicts including idealization disillusionment, abandonment concerns, identity impairment, self-awareness, susceptibility to influence, affect dysregulation, affect instability, affect skill deficit, and tension reduction activities. The only exception was identity diffusion. As transdiagnostic mental processes of self-experience are often associated with poor treatment outcome and therapy alone may not adequately help patients with severe PTSD, MDMA-assisted therapy’s significant positive effects provide an important treatment opportunity. “It is hypothesized that the MDMA lowers psychological defenses, increases self-confidence, increases empathy, increases trust, increases emotional learning, decreases anxiety and fear, and improves mood. The combination of MDMA with intensive therapy seems to create a safe holding environment for the patient to be more likely to allow these traumatic memories to surface and be consciously processed,” Psychiatric Times Editor-in-Chief, John J. Miller MD, [wrote](https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/you-have-to-say-hello-before-you-can-say-goodbye).2 In February 2024, the US Food and Drug Administration accepted a New Drug Application for MDMA-assisted therapy for individuals with PTSD.3 The FDA also granted priority review status to the application and set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act target action date of August 11, 2024. If approved, this will mark the first instance of MDMA-assisted therapy and psychedelic-assisted therapy. “Securing priority review for our investigational MDMA-assisted therapy is a significant accomplishment and underscores the urgent unmet need for new innovation in the treatment of PTSD,” said Amy Emerson, chief executive officer of Lykos Therapeutics and developer of the investigational MDMA-assisted therapy, in a press release.4 Stay up-to-date on news related to research on promising new interventions and developments in the treatment of a wide variety of psychiatric disorders at [psychiatrictimes.com](https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/).

    "text": "Gaza: UN rights experts condemn ‘killing and silencing’ of journalists\n[Human Rights](/en/news/topic/human-rights)\nOngoing military operations by Israel in Gaza have made it the deadliest and most dangerous war for journalists covering it “in recent history”, UN independent human rights experts warned on Thursday.\nExpressing deep concern, the\nHuman Rights Council-appointed experts highlighted the alarming toll on journalists and media workers in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, particularly in Gaza.\n“We are alarmed at the extraordinarily high numbers of journalists and media workers who have been killed, attacked, injured and detained in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, particularly in Gaza, in recent months blatantly disregarding international law,” the experts\nsaid.\nThe experts noted “disturbing reports” of attacks against media workers despite being clearly identifiable in jackets, helmets and vehicles marked “press”, seemingly indicating a “deliberate strategy” by Israeli forces to obstruct and silence critical reporting.\nDozens dead\nSince 7 October, 122 journalists and media workers have lost their lives in the Gaza Strip, with many others sustaining injuries.\nFour Israeli journalists were killed by Hamas on 7 October, when fighters from the extremist group which controls Gaza and other Palestinian militants, attacked Israeli communities in southern Israel.\n“We condemn all killings, threats and attacks on journalists and call on all parties to the conflict to protect them,” they said.\nDozens of Palestinian journalists have also been detained by Israeli forces in both Gaza and in the West Bank where harassment, intimidation and attacks on journalists have increased since the Hamas terror attacks.\nCourage and resilience\nThe experts paid tribute to the resilience and courage of media workers in Gaza, noting that rarely have journalists “paid such a heavy price for just doing their job” as those in Gaza now.\n“[They] continue to put their own lives on the line every day in the course of duty, while also enduring enormous hardship and tragic loss of colleagues, friends and families in one of the bloodiest, most ruthless conflicts of our times,” the experts said.\nThey highlighted the case of Al-Jazeera journalist, Wael al-Dahdouh, who lost his wife, two children and a grandson in an Israeli bombing on 25 October. He also survived a drone attack that killed his cameraman in late December.\nHe lost another son, also an Al-Jazeera journalist, along with another colleague, who were killed by an Israeli drone strike targeting their car on 7 January 2024.\nPossible war crimes\nThe experts stressed the critical importance of the right to information as a “survival right” during times of conflict, on which the very lives of civilians depend, and that journalists play an “indispensable role” as a vital source of information, and as human rights defenders and witnesses to atrocities.\n“Journalists are entitled to protection as civilians under international humanitarian law. Targeted attacks and killings of journalists are war crimes,” the experts warned.\nThe independent expert called on the International Court of Justice (\nICJ) and the International Criminal Court (ICC) to pay “particular attention” to the dangerous pattern of attacks and impunity for crimes against journalists.\nAccess to Gaza\nThe experts further urged Israeli authorities to permit journalists to enter Gaza and safeguard the safety of all journalists in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\nThey called on all combatants to facilitate prompt, independent, and impartial investigations into every journalist’s killing, in accordance with international standards.\nMandate to investigate\nThe experts speaking out are all Special Rapporteurs, who along with other independent rights experts are mandated to monitor and report on specific thematic issues or country situations.\nThey work on a voluntary basis, serve in their individual capacity, are not UN staff and do not receive a salary.",

    "title": "Positive progress made in Hamas-Israel negotiations: Egyptian media | Politics",
    "text": "“Positive progress” has been made in negotiations between Israel and Palestinian resistance group Hamas to reach a cease-fire agreement in Gaza, Egyptian state media said Sunday, but warned against believing reported details of a possible deal. “A high-level source confirmed that there is positive progress in negotiations regarding reaching a cease-fire agreement in the Gaza Strip,” reported Egyptian Al Qahera News. But the unnamed source added: “What has been published about the terms of the agreement in the media is inaccurate.\" The source confirmed that \"the Egyptian security delegation is continuing its consultations with all parties,” adding that \"the return of the displaced Palestinians to the northern Gaza Strip is among the terms of the agreement.\" Media reports said earlier that negotiations between the two sides had hit a “dead end,” with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisting on invading the southern city of Rafah despite international warnings of the danger this would pose to the some 1.5 million displaced civilians there. Netanyahu reportedly faces growing pressure not to accept a deal that would lead to ending the war in Gaza and canceling plans for a military offensive into Rafah. Israel's opposition accuses Netanyahu of trying to sabotage a hostage swap deal with Palestinian group Hamas. Tel Aviv believes 134 Israelis are being held in Gaza, while Israel is holding some 9,000 Palestinians in its jails. Israel has killed more than 34,600 Palestinians since an Oct. 7, 2023 cross-border attack by Hamas in which some 1,200 Israelis were killed and around 250 hostages taken. A previous deal last November saw the release of 81 Israelis and 24 foreigners in exchange for 240 Palestinians, including 71 women and 169 children. The US, Qatar, and Egypt have tried to broker an agreement to release the remaining Israeli captives. The conflict has pushed 85% of Gaza's population into internal displacement amid acute shortages of food, clean water, and medicine, while 60% of the enclave's infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed. Israel stands accused of genocide at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which in January issued an interim ruling that ordered Tel Aviv to stop genocidal acts and take measures to guarantee that humanitarian assistance is provided to civilians in Gaza.",

Se desconoce su paradero', señaló Molina, autora del estudio titulado ‘Nicaragua: ¿Una Iglesia perseguida?’, a través de su cuenta de la red social X (antes Twitter).Según la investigadora, Calero fue 'secuestrado por la Policía Nacional en su parroquia' tras haber mencionado al obispo encarcelado Rolando Álvarez, quien preside la Diócesis de Matagalpa, en una misa.'No existe una acusación formal en contra de él y no se tiene información de su paradero', explicó.Calero se suma a los sacerdotes Carlos Avilés y Héctor Treminio, vicario general y tesorero de la Arquidiócesis de Managua, respectivamente, que fueron detenidos el jueves por la Policía y civiles.La semana pasada, las autoridades detuvieron al obispo Isidoro Mora, a dos sacerdotes y a dos seminaristas.Ni el Gobierno ni la Policía Nacional han confirmado o negado la presunta detención de los religiosos.El cardenal nicaragüense y arzobispo de Managua, Leopoldo Brenes, aún no se pronuncia sobre esos arrestos.Quien sí lo hizo fue el exiliado obispo auxiliar de Managua, Silvio Báez, a quien el papa Francisco ordenó dejar Nicaragua en 2019 por motivos de seguridad, quien se declaró indignado por los encarcelamientos de tres sacerdotes de la Arquidiócesis de Managua.",
