    "title": "Pope Francis: In the Eucharist, Jesus Offers Himself For the World",
    "text": "Pope Francis: In the Eucharist, Jesus Offers Himself for the World After giving a blessing to the crowd, Pope Francis asked people to continue to pray for those who are suffering in Ukraine, Palestine, Israel, and Myanmar. In the Eucharist, Jesus offers himself for the life of the world, Pope Francis proclaimed from the window of the Apostolic Palace on the Solemnity of Corpus Christi. Speaking to a crowd huddled together under colorful umbrellas on a rainy Sunday afternoon in Rome, the Pope underlined that the body and blood of Christ offered at every Mass is a gift from God. “It is He who gives Himself for all humanity, and offers Himself for the life of the world,” Pope Francis said on June 2. “Let us remember this: Jesus made a gift of all His life,” he added. Pope Francis explained that just as Jesus “did not keep his life for himself, but gave it to us,” so too are Christians called to make their lives a gift for others. Quoting Saint Leo the Great, he said: “‘Our participation in the Body and Blood of Christ has no other end than to make us become that which we eat.’” Pope Francis added that “to become what we eat, to become ‘eucharistic,’” means to become “people who no longer live for themselves, in the logic of possession and consumption, but who know how to make their lives a gift for others.” “Let us understand, then, that celebrating the Eucharist and eating this Bread, as we do especially on Sundays, is not an act of worship detached from life or a mere moment of personal consolation; we must always remember that Jesus took the bread, broke it and gave it to them and, therefore, communion with Him makes us capable of also becoming bread broken for others, of sharing what we are and what we have,” he said. After giving a blessing to the crowd, Pope Francis asked people to continue to pray for those who are suffering in Ukraine, Palestine, Israel, and Myanmar, appealing to leaders to “stop the escalation and to make every effort for dialogue and negotiation.” The Pope also asked for prayers for the African country of Sudan, where a civil war has displaced millions of people since the conflict broke out last year. “May the weapons be silenced and, with the commitment of the local authorities and the international community, help be brought to the population and the many displaced people; may the Sudanese refugees find welcome and protection in neighboring countries,” he said. Following the Angelus address, Pope Francis is scheduled to preside over a Corpus Christi Mass in the Archbasilica of St. John Lateran at 5 p.m. local time followed by a Eucharistic procession through the streets of Rome to the Basilica of St. Mary Major. The Solemnity of Corpus Christi, meaning the “Body of Christ” in Latin, is traditionally celebrated on the Thursday following Trinity Sunday or, in some countries including the United States and Italy, on the Sunday following that feast. The feast provides an opportunity for the Church to focus on the real presence of Jesus in the Eucharist. “May the Virgin Mary, who welcomed Jesus, bread descended from Heaven, and gave herself entirely together with Him, help us too to become a gift of love, united with Jesus in the Eucharist,” Pope Francis said. - Keywords: [eucharistic adoration](https://www.ncregister.com/tag/eucharistic-adoration) [solemnity of the most holy body and blood of christ](https://www.ncregister.com/tag/solemnity-of-the-most-holy-body-and-blood-of-christ) [corpus christi sunday](https://www.ncregister.com/tag/corpus-christi-sunday)",

A Palermo si fermeranno i lavoratori di Fincantieri, Leonardo, Sirti, Sispi e di tutte le altre aziende metalmeccaniche della provincia.

E domani – dichiarano il segretario generale Fiom Palermo e Sicilia Francesco Foti, il segretario generale Fim Cisl Palermo Trapani Antonio Nobile e il segretario generale Uilm Uil Giovanni Gerbino – saremo di nuovo in piazza contro l’arroganza di Federmeccanica e Assistal che, anziché aprire una vera trattativa e discutere delle nostre rivendicazioni, hanno chiuso a ogni possibilità confronto presentando una contro piattaforma che di fatto annulla la piattaforma votata col 98 per cento dei consensi dei metalmeccanici italiani. Chiediamo la riapertura del tavolo sulla base delle richieste presentate da Fiom, Fim e Uilm”.\nCon gli scioperi, la mobilitazione e il blocco dello straordinario, Fiom, Fim e Uilm non mollano e chiedono aumenti certi ed esigibili sui minimi contrattuali che vadano oltre l’inflazione, la tutela del potere d’acquisto dei salari, il contrasto della precarietà con l’estensione dei diritti e la riduzione dell’orario di lavoro, l’aumento delle tutele in materia di salute e sicurezza nei luoghi di lavoro e negli appalti, l’avvio di una giusta transizione, che tuteli l’ambiente e l’occupazione nell’ottica di una nuova stagione di sviluppo industriale.",

Thank you for joining us today​ to discuss the relationship between the⁣ menstrual cycle and‌ physical exercise.\n**Dr. ‌Thompson:** Good morning! I’m happy to be here to shed ‌some light on this important topic.\n**Interviewer:** Research suggests ​that light and‍ core strengthening exercises can be⁣ particularly ‌beneficial ​during⁢ menstruation. Can you elaborate on why ⁤gentle exercises like yoga and​ swimming are recommended during this time?\n**Dr. Thompson:** Absolutely. ​During menstruation, many women experience various symptoms such as cramps, mood swings, and ​fatigue. Gentle exercises like yoga and swimming can ‍help‍ ease these symptoms by promoting ⁢relaxation and increasing blood ​flow, which can alleviate pain and discomfort. ⁢These activities also have a⁤ calming effect, which ​is essential since many women feel the need for ⁢gentleness and rest during their period.\n**Interviewer:** That makes sense. ​You mentioned the importance ⁤of adapting exercise according to the⁢ menstrual cycle. Can you‍ explain how physical‌ activity can ‍vary during ⁣different phases ⁣of ⁣the cycle?\n**Dr. Thompson:**​ Certainly! The menstrual ⁣cycle has different ⁢phases—menstrual,⁢ follicular, ‍ovulatory, and luteal—each⁣ influencing ‍energy‍ levels and hormonal‌ balance. During the menstrual phase, it’s best to focus on light activities. As you enter the follicular phase, energy levels ⁣may rise, allowing for more ⁤intense⁣ workouts. Around ovulation, many ‌women feel their best and can handle higher intensity training, while in the luteal phase, it may be wise to switch back⁢ to gentler exercises as PMS⁤ symptoms can kick ‌in.\n**Interviewer:** That’s really insightful! You also ‌mentioned the ‍Aviva‍ method⁤ and hormonal yoga. How ​do these approaches help with hormonal disorders or menstrual-related issues?\n**Dr. Thompson:** The Aviva method, along with hormonal yoga, involves specific movements ​that target the pelvic⁢ area, which can stimulate blood flow and energy. These practices ​help women⁢ understand and connect with their bodies ‌and symptoms, promoting relaxation while addressing issues such​ as⁣ menstrual pain,⁢ reduced libido, and even menopause symptoms. They also serve as a‌ gentle reminder to honor one’s body during different phases of ⁢the cycle.\n**Interviewer:** It sounds like being⁤ in tune ⁢with one’s body and adapting workouts is key ‍for ⁤overall well-being. What advice would ​you give to women looking to incorporate this knowledge into their fitness routines?\n**Dr. Thompson:**‌ I would say start⁤ by tracking your menstrual cycle and paying attention to how​ your body feels ⁤during⁢ different phases. Choose activities that resonate ‍with you—yoga, walking,‍ or gentle‌ stretching during your period,‍ and higher ⁣intensity ⁤workouts⁤ when​ you feel more energized. Listen ​to your body; ⁤it’s the best guide for how to move​ and adjust your fitness ‌routine.\n**Interviewer:** Thank you, Dr. Thompson! ⁢Your ​expertise is⁢ invaluable, and⁣ it’s⁣ encouraging ⁢to ‌see how thoughtful adjustments to exercise can lead to improved‍ health ‍and well-being.\n**Dr. Thompson:** Thank you for having me! I’m glad to share this information⁣ and hope it helps women feel empowered ‌in⁤ their fitness ‍journeys.",

    "text": "Dos detenidos por robar el dinero del cepillo de 28 iglesias de la provincia de León En todos los casos, sustraían el dinero de cepillos y lampadarios, los cuales previamente habían forzado, sin llevarse otros objetos de valor que se encontraban en el interior de los templos. La [Guardia Civil](https://www.heraldo.es/tags/instituciones_empresas/guardia_civil.html) ha detenido a dos personas, un hombre y una mujer, como supuestos autores de los delitos de robo con fuerza ocurridos desde mayo de 2023 en el interior de 28 iglesias y ermitas ubicadas en localidades de la provincia de León en las que sustraían el dinero de cepillos y lampadarios. La operación se inició a finales de 2023, al detectar los investigadores la comisión de varios delitos de idéntica naturaleza, todos robos con fuerza en interior de templos religiosos, que compartían el mismo modus operandi, ha informado este sábado la Subdelegación del Gobierno de León en un comunicado. En todos los casos, sustraían el dinero de cepillos y lampadarios, los cuales previamente habían forzado, sin llevarse otros objetos de valor que se encontraban en el interior de los templos. A la vista de los hechos, que habían generado gran alarma social entre los vecinos de las localidades afectadas y, tras la práctica de numerosas diligencias de investigación y otras pesquisas, se determinó que los detenidos se valían del empleo de la fuerza para violentar tanto las puertas de acceso a los templos como los cepillos y lampadarios que se encontraban en los mismos para, posteriormente, sustraer el dinero en efectivo que hallaban en su interior. Además, todos los hechos fueron cometidos en el interior de iglesias ubicadas en pequeñas localidades y en horas –generalmente por las noches– en las que los supuestos autores se aseguraban una baja afluencia de personas para así evitar ser descubiertos. Si bien todos los robos se circunscriben al ámbito geográfico de la provincia de [León](https://www.heraldo.es/tags/lugares/leon.html), los detenidos llegaron a recorrer cientos de kilómetros en una sola noche para cometer los robos en distintas localidades. Los detenidos se habían especializado en la comisión de este tipo de robos y les figura un amplio historial delictivo en los registros policiales. Con las detenciones practicadas se dan por esclarecidos los robos en 28 templos religiosos acontecidos durante los últimos años en la provincia de León, concretamente en las localidades de Castrotierra de la Valduerna, Brimeda, Destriana, Pobladura de Yuso, Ransinde, Villibañe, Mozóndiga (2), Chozas de Arriba (2), Pozuelo del Páramo, Moral de Orbigo, Villarín del Páramo, Cazanuecos (2), La Antigua, Torneros del Bernesga, Val de San Román, Altobar de la Encomienda (2), Navianos de la Vega, La Nora del Río, Quintana del Marco, Genestacio de la Vega (2), Moscas del Páramo (3). Las actuaciones han sido llevadas a cabo por componentes del Área de Delincuencia Patrimonial-Económica de la Unidad Orgánica de Policía Judicial de León. Los detenidos fueron puestos a disposición de los Juzgados de Instrucción de La Bañeza (León). [Regístrate gratis](#) [Iniciar sesión](#)",
