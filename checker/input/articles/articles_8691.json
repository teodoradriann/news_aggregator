    "title": "Notre Dame Quarterback Riley Leonard Pays His Offensive Line in Latest NIL Deal",
    "text": "Notre Dame QB Riley Leonard Makes Ultimate Teammate Move in Latest NIL Deal One of the biggest takeaways from Notre Dame's 23-13 victory at Texas A&M on Saturday night was that transfer quarterback Riley Leonard didn't get sacked once while dropping back for the Fighting Irish. Perhaps as a result of that, but more likely because he's a good teammate, the Notre Dame signal caller is planning on giving his next NIL deal to the offensive line that protects him. Leonard is slated to be at Dick's Sporting Goods as part of an NIL deal on Friday from 11:30 a.m.-2 p.m. ET. Instead of taking the money (and gift cards) and running however, Leonard is inviting his entire offensive line and letting them all split the payment. Leonard said the following in a statement to [On3 Sports](https://www.on3.com/nil/news/notre-dame-fighting-irish-football-quarterback-riley-leonard-using-nil-deal-dicks-sporting-goods-give-back-offensive-line/): “It means a lot to be able to share an opportunity like this with my teammates, in fact it’s essential to me,” Leonard told On3 in a statement. “I know I’m the quarterback of this team, but we can’t win on and off the field if we’re not doing this stuff together. “I am very grateful to DICK’S for giving us the chance to connect with fans in such a fun way as a unit and especially to be able to involve my O-Linemen. Things are always better for everyone when they’re around.” [Notre Dame, Leonard, and his offensive line are set to take on Northern Illinois at 3:30 p.m. ET Saturday for the Fighting Irish home opener.](https://www.si.com/college/notredame/football/notre-dame-football-college-niu-preview-how-to-watch-listen-betting-odds-info) [Notre Dame on Sports Illustrated](https://www.si.com/college/notredame/) [Urban Meyer discusses Marcus Freeman's growth following Texas A&M win](https://www.si.com/college/notredame/football/notre-dame-football-news-urban-meyer-marcus-freeman) [Notre Dame Updates Depth Chart Ahead of Northern Illinois Game](https://www.si.com/college/notredame/football/notre-dame-football-riley-leonard-depth-chart-northern-illinois-preview-irish-marcus-freeman) [Notre Dame vs. NIU: How to watch, listen, and bet on Irish home opener](https://www.si.com/college/notredame/football/notre-dame-football-college-niu-preview-how-to-watch-listen-betting-odds-info) [Joel Klatt Gives Very High Praise to Notre Dame](https://www.si.com/college/notredame/football/college-football-news-notre-dame-joel-klatt-rankings-week-2) [Notre Dame Hero From Saturday Learned Valuable Lesson After Huge Play](https://www.si.com/college/notredame/football/notre-dame-college-football-texas-a-m-beaux-collins-sec)",

    "text": "Internautas compartilharam no X (ex-Twitter) momentos considerados “constrangedores” do presidente dos Estados Unidas, Joe Biden, durante a cerimônia de celebração do 80º aniversário do Dia D. O evento foi realizado nesta 5ª feira (6.jun.2024) na Normandia (França).\nEm um dos vídeos, o democrata cumprimenta o presidente francês, Emmanuel Macron, e depois trava em uma posição semi-agachada ao quase sentar em uma cadeira atrás dele. O registro foi compartilhado pela RNC Research , conta no X administrada pela campanha do ex-presidente Donald Trump e pelo Comitê Nacional Republicano.\nFormulário de cadastro receba alertas grátis do Poder360 quero receber por e-mail concordo com os termos da LGPD . quero receber no WhatsApp Inscreva-se quero receber no Telegram Inscreva-se “Constrangedor” , disse a publicação ao divulgar a imagem.\nAwkward 😬 pic.twitter.com/3KNLco85hj\n— RNC Research (@RNCResearch) June 6, 2024\nO filho de Trump, Donald Trump Jr., comentou o episódio. “Existe algum momento em que os norte-americanos percebem o quanto isso é um constrangimento no cenário mundial? Será que esse tipo de incompetência e fraqueza encoraja nossos inimigos a agirem da forma como estão agindo? Claro que sim!” , escreveu em publicação no X.\nOutro registro publicado pela RNC Research mostra Biden saindo do local da cerimônia de mãos dadas com a primeira-dama Jill Biden, enquanto Macron cumprimenta militares e veteranos de guerra que participaram do evento. A página afirmou que o democrata foi “escoltado” por sua mulher.\nJill, Ed.D., escorts Joe Biden out as French President Macron stays behind to greet veterans pic.twitter.com/n4rpRgdbv5\n— RNC Research (@RNCResearch) June 6, 2024\nUsuários compartilharam o registro e questionaram a ação de Biden. “Jill Biden acabou de retirar Joe do evento na Normandia, enquanto Macron ficou com os veteranos. O que está acontecendo?” , escreveu um internauta.\n“As coisas não estão indo bem na França. Quando essa farsa de presidência vai acabar? Joe não está bem” , disse uma usuária do X.\nA idade e a aptidão cognitiva de Biden têm sido temas recorrentes nas redes sociais, com o presidente cometendo diversas gafes durante seu mandato na Casa Branca.\nO Wall Street Journal publicou na 3ª feira (4.jun.2024) uma longa reportagem detalhando momentos em que o presidente dos EUA demonstrou sinais de desconexão em conversas, fechou os olhos e aparentou confusão de memória.\nAo longo de vários meses, o jornal entrevistou mais de 45 pessoas, incluindo republicanos e democratas que participaram de reuniões com Biden ou foram informados sobre esses encontros, além de funcionários do governo.\nSegundo o Wall Street Journal, a maioria dos entrevistados que notaram sinais de envelhecimento em Biden pertence ao Partido Republicano, embora alguns democratas também tenham relatado situações semelhantes.\nDISCURSO DE BIDEN Em suas declarações nesta 5ª feira (6.jun), o presidente dos EUA afirmou que as “forças sombrias” que os Aliados (aliança formada pela França, Reino Unido, EUA e, posteriormente, pela URSS) combateram em 6 de junho de 1944, na 2ª Guerra Mundial, não desapareceram.\nTambém afirmou que a luta entre ditaduras e liberdade é “interminável” e que a Ucrânia é um exemplo claro disso porque foi invadida por um “tirano”.\nSegundo o democrata, o Dia D provou que a democracia é mais forte do qualquer Exército do mundo. “O que os Aliados fizeram há 80 anos supera em muito qualquer coisa que poderíamos ter feito sozinhos” , disse.\nDIA D Em 6 de junho de 1944, tropas aliadas invadiram as praias da Normandia, na França, com o objetivo de libertar a Europa da Alemanha Nazista. A chamada Operação Overlord é conhecida como a maior manobra militar terrestre da história e marcou o “início do fim” da 2ª Guerra Mundial e do regime nazista de Adolf Hitler.",

    "title": "Frustrated Democrats want Biden to follow asylum limit with immigrant protections",
    "text": "House\nFrustrated Democrats want Biden to follow asylum limit with immigrant protections\nHispanic Democrats are ramping up the pressure on President Biden to take unilateral action to protect immigrants living and working in the United States.\nMembers of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) are\nfurious that Biden moved this week to put new limits on asylum-seekers without also advancing legal protections for farmworkers, Dreamers and other undocumented immigrants — reforms they had presented during a meeting with the president at the White House last month.\nIn the wake of Biden’s new restrictive asylum policy, they want the White House to launch another round of immigration executive orders to provide some equilibrium between strict enforcement and immigrant rights — a difficult balance in an election year when Biden is scrambling to address the border crisis without alienating Hispanic voters.\n“I think he’s trying to address half the issue, the half the issue he was able to address. But he needs to address the other piece of it,” said Rep. Robert Garcia (D-Calif.), a first-term CHC member. “I am hopeful, and so are my conversations with the White House, that there’s more action coming, and that’s what I’m hoping for.”\nRep. Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.), deputy chair of the Hispanic Caucus, ticked off a number of reforms at the top of the CHC’s executive order wish list. These reforms include efforts to shield from deportation the undocumented spouses of U.S. citizens, a group estimated to number more than 1 million; to apply similar protections to the so-called Dreamers, people brought into the country illegally as children and estimated to number more than 3 million; to grant new labor protections and legal rights to immigrant farmworkers; and to expand work permits to include more undocumented immigrants.\n“I think those four — maybe in that order — could be interesting pieces that could balance what seems to be an enforcement-only initiative,” Espaillat said.\nThose aren’t the only proposals the CHC is advocating for.\nThe group is also clamoring to expedite — or in some cases, simply create — a pathway to citizenship for the estimated 12 million undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. Many of those people are already working, paying taxes and feeding into the Social Security and Medicare systems, the Democrats argue, and should be empowered to benefit from those contributions.\n“Having an enforcement-only executive order, I think it’s disappointing, and I think that we really need to make sure that we’re actually solving the problem, which requires expanding a path to citizenship,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) told reporters shortly before Biden officially rolled out his action.\nThe citizenship pathway has been controversial for decades, however, especially among conservatives who characterize such a policy as “amnesty” for those who broke the law the moment they arrived in the country.\nIn 2014, when House GOP leaders floated a comprehensive\nimmigration reform package that included legal status for the undocumented population, conservatives in their conference killed it within days. And the party has shifted only further to the right since then.\nWith that in mind, some Democrats are suggesting that Biden adopt a more targeted proposal to offer citizenship to those serving in the U.S. armed forces — a less contentious concept that could insulate the president from Republican attacks on the campaign trail.\n“There’s other conversation about whether or not he can formalize a stronger pathway to citizenship for folks that are serving in the military, strengthening issues around DACA,” Garcia said. “So I think that there are — and he has done some of that already — there are places where more can be done, and I strongly encourage the president to move on this.”\nStill, other Democrats are urging the administration to streamline the system for processing asylum-seekers at the southern border, where thousands of migrants are arriving each day.\nFunding to increase the number of immigration judges was included in a bipartisan Senate deal earlier in the year that was sunk by Republicans after former President Trump came out against the package. But Rep. Juan Vargas (D-Calif.), who represents a border district around San Diego, suggested that Biden can shuffle funding internally to boost that number without congressional action.\n“The way to do it is to move resources around within the budget that you have. I think you can do that through executive order, and that’s what I would like to see,” Vargas said. “People then could apply for asylum, but you could figure out pretty quickly whether they really had a case or it’s just economic asylum that they’re asking for, where they don’t have a case.”\nBiden, for his part, has signaled that more action — including on the issue of immigration — will be on the way after he moved to address the situation at the southern border by unveiling an executive order that would shut off asylum requests when the seven-day average of daily border crossings exceeds 2,500 people ports of entry.\n“Today, I have spoken about what we need to do to secure the border. In the weeks ahead — and I mean the weeks ahead — I will speak to how we can make our immigration system more fair and more just,” he said Tuesday.\nHis decision to go at it alone came after Senate Republicans twice blocked a bipartisan border bill — once in February, again in May — from advancing, despite it being negotiated by the GOP Sen. James Lankford (Okla.) and hailed as a conservative product.\nThe timing, however, is significant: The situation at the southern border has emerged as a central campaign issue — and a key vulnerability for Biden — this election cycle. Voters have consistently named immigration and the border as the most important problem facing the U.S. in the lead-up to November, and more have said they trust Trump to address the situation over Biden.\nThose dynamics led to Biden’s executive order, which has fractured the Democratic caucus, pitting vulnerable Democrats concerned about the situation at the southern border — and looking for something to campaign on in their purple districts — against liberals up in arms over what they see as a harsh policy that mirrors moves taken during the Trump administration.\n“Today’s executive order severely limits access to asylum and is deeply concerning to our caucus,” Espaillat wrote in a statement with CHC Chair Nanette Barragán (D-Calif.) and caucus Whip Sylvia Garcia (D-Texas). “Such measures impede progress and harm migrants fleeing violence and persecution, who otherwise would present a credible and meritorious case for asylum.”\nBut even within some of the most liberal corners of the Democratic caucus, Biden’s executive order is splitting progressives.\nIn a move that raised some eyebrows, Rep. Steven Horsford (D-Nev.) — a vulnerable lawmaker who chairs the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) — praised Biden’s move as “an essential step to protect our border,” while Rep. Yvette Clarke (D-N.Y.), the co-chair of the CBC’s Foreign Affairs and Immigration Task Force, railed against the executive order, arguing that it will “prevent countless Black immigrants” from utilizing their legal right to apply for asylum in the U.S.\n“We should move toward a more nuanced approach that considers the real humanitarian issues that migrants are facing each day,” she added.\n[Adriano Espaillat](\nhttps://thehill.com/people/adriano-espaillat/ ) [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez](\nhttps://thehill.com/people/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-2/ ) [James Lankford](\nhttps://thehill.com/people/james-lankford/ ) [Joe Biden](\nhttps://thehill.com/people/joe-biden/ ) [Juan Vargas](\nhttps://thehill.com/people/juan-vargas/ ) [Robert Garcia](\nhttps://thehill.com/people/robert-garcia/ ) [Steven Horsford](\nhttps://thehill.com/people/steven-horsford/ ) [Sylvia Garcia](\nhttps://thehill.com/people/sylvia-garcia/ ) [Yvette Clarke](\nhttps://thehill.com/people/yvette-clarke/ )\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc.

    "text": "Thousands of jobs under threat in British Steel closure plans\nThousands of jobs are at risk after a steelmaker unveiled closure proposals.\nBritish Steel has launched a consultation on the future of its Scunthorpe blast furnaces and steelmaking operations.\nBosses say the ventures are “no longer financially sustainable due to highly challenging market conditions, the imposition of tariffs and higher environmental costs”.\nOperations – which include a rod mill – could close by as early as June 2025, affecting as many as 2500 jobs.\nThe consultation follows the breakdown of talks between British Steel owner Jingye and the Government over investment support for new electric arc furnaces, and comes amid reports the firm has rejected a £500 million Westminster rescue package.\nUnion Unite has branded the company’s plans a “disgrace”, accusing British Steel of “trying to hold the Government to ransom”.\nZengwei An, British Steel chief executive, said the “difficult” decision comes as the firm battles with “significant” losses of around £700,000 a day.\nHe added: “We understand this is an extremely difficult day for our staff, their families and everyone associated with British Steel.\n“But we believe this is a necessary decision given the hugely challenging circumstances the business faces.\n“We remain committed to engaging with our workforce and unions, as well as our suppliers and customers during this time.”\nResponding to the company’s announcement, Sharon Graham, general secretary at union Unite, ordered the company to revive discussions with the Government.\nShe added: “The Government has clearly made an offer to invest heavily in British Steel.\n“This offer comes with long-term job guarantees - anything less would be a complete misuse of taxpayers’ money.\n“British Steel must now withdraw its job threats and work with the Government and Unite on a sustainable way forward.\n“The UK has the opportunity of becoming a leader in green steel and British Steel should be at the forefront of that transformation.”\nLooking to promote your product/service to SME businesses in your region?\nFind out how Bdaily can help →\nEnjoy the read?

    "text": "[Verdaderofalso](/user/Verdaderofalso)a [eldesmarque.com](/go/link/3953652)\nHay españoles nativos con apellidos españoles como peleteiro o españoles hijos de inmigrantes como Nico Williams que llevan el nombre de España a lo más alto, nos engrandecen y son un orgullo para mí país.\nAhora bien, hay otros hijos, como los hijos de puta racistas de mierda, que son una lacra y un puto cáncer para España y no hay manera de librarse de ellos. Bueno, si hay maneras.\n[#24](c24#c-24) Según el baremo de algunos los requisitos son: ser mala persona, perseverar en la ignorancia y dar vergüenza ajena.\n[#24](c24#c-24) Lo que ponga en tu NIE. Ser españól es básicamente una situación administrativa. Más allá de eso, nadie te debería poder imponer de dónde te sientes, si es que te sientes de algún lado.\nEl gran problema de las redes sociales actuales es el efecto altavoz que provocan.\nQuien es el Alberto Caliu este y por qué debería importarme\n[#27](c27#c-27) Cualquier gilipollas irrelevante se tira un pedo en Twitter y crea tendencia. No creo que eso aporte nada bueno al desarrollo social de un país.\nVaya por delante que si twitter tuviera un mínimo de filtro, la cuenta del calio ése debería probablemente haber sido suspendida hace años, habría que hacerse responsable de comentarios xenófobos en redes sociales y deporte.\nPero tampoco estoy de acuerdo con Peleteiro. Si nos ponemos a buscar gilipollas en twitter, red que parece dedicada a ese perfil en concreto, necesitariamos más mano de obra en ir denunciando twitts que en construir 10 nuevos estadios Bernabeus. No creo que sea razonable encontrar algún tarado en twitter para hacer un \"no quiero generalizar pero...\".\n[#15](c15#c-15) un insulto racista es un insulto racista, aunque la gente se escude en el anonimato para demostrar lo saco de mierda que es.\nLas cosas no son menos graves porque ocurran a través de las redes sociales.\nPorque por esa regla de tres, el bullyng que sufren cientos de adolescentes en España a través de ellas y que tantos estragos hacen a su salud mental, quedaría minimizado. Y estamos seguros de que nadie quiere eso.\n[#1](c1#c-1) Nació y estudió en Pamplona, y su familia vive allí. Para algunos es vasco y para otros, no. Por tanto, puede jugar con la selección española, o con la de Ghana, de donde son sus padres. Su hermano Iñaki juega con Ghana, creo.\nUn abrazo muy fuerte de un vecino suyo de la Rotxapea\n[#3](c3#c-3) No todos pueden jugar donde le de la Ghana.\nJo, vaya día que llevo. Esto no se lo merece nadie, ni yo mismo.\n[#9](c9#c-9) A mi ver a personas con rasgos de cualquier otra parte, pero con un acento típico de una región de España me saca la sonrisa, ya que es signo de que desde pequeño vive aquí como uno más, y en la mayoría de los casos es nacido aquí.\n[#1](c1#c-1) \"Yo no soy racista. Yo prefiero a un negro, negro, que hable euskera que a un blanco que lo ignore\"\nXabier Arzalluz.\nLo jodido para Arzalluz es que Williams ni es blanco ni habla euskera, que yo sepa. Y si tenemos en cuenta sus comentarios sobre el RH vasco, ya queda claro que el problema de Williams, como siempre, son los rancios de derechas de toda la vida.\n[#13](c13#c-13) Con el PNV hemos topado, otros que no son ni de izquierdas ni de derechas ...\n\"Aita\" Arzallus era de los últimos que enseñaban la patita en público, pero son todos iguales. Es lo que tiene la endogamia ...\n[#13](c13#c-13) El comentario de Arzallus fue bastante manipulado. De hecho el tenía el RH positivo, al contrario que el típico RH negativo vasco.\n[#37](c37#c-37) Medir el patriotismo en si pagas o no impuestos tela... ¿Quienes pagan más impuestos son más patriotas que los que pagan menos impuestos? ¿El que se va a Alemania para tener buenas condiciones de trabajo ya no puede ser patriota?\n[#42](c42#c-42) Sí, pero el que dice que vive en Suiza para no pagar impuestos en España, además de no ser patriota es un delincuente.\n[#37](c37#c-37) A mí mientras vivan de verdad en Andorra, nada que objetar. El problema es que muchos de ellos siguen viviendo en España, y en Andorra simplemente se han comprado una casa para declararla (falsamente) como su residencia.\nPara mí está noticia es una buena noticia\nNico Williams ha recibido UN comentario racista en Twitter.\nAna dice que jamás se ha encontrado con un comentario racista.\nLos infrahumanos siempre existirán, pero mientras sean cuatro gatos...\nVaya, seguramente el que ha hecho ese comentario tenga bastantes genes \"moros\", como muchos españoles\nDesafortunadamente son y siempre serán negros, y aunque sean españoles y lo que queramos siguen siendo negros y eso a ojos de la derecha española es gente prescindible, no digna, subhumanos, como los rojos más o menos",

    "title": "5 Ways To Measure Your Pastoral Progress",
    "text": "As we stand on the cusp of a new year, it’s only natural to reflect on where the year has taken us. Growth is a perpetual companion on this path, and measuring it helps us stay aligned with our purpose. It’s also helpful to take a look back with gratitude for what God has done. It’s easy to forget as you ramp up into a new year. Let’s explore five practical ways to gauge your pastoral progress over the past year.\n1. Spiritual Milestones and Reflections\nStart by revisiting the\nspiritual milestones you’ve encountered in the past year. Consider the sermons that resonated deeply, the moments of personal revelation, and the testimonies of transformation within your congregation. Reflect on your own spiritual journey—have you deepened your connection with God? Use these reflections as markers of spiritual growth.\n2. Impactful Ministry Moments\nThink about the ministry moments that left a lasting impact on both you and your congregation. Were there events,\noutreach programs, or initiatives that brought the community closer to God? Measure your growth by the positive impact your ministry has had on the lives of those you shepherd. Celebrate the victories, no matter how small, as indicators of your effectiveness in spreading God’s love.\n3. Feedback and Testimonials\nFeedback is a powerful tool for growth. Look back at the feedback you received from your congregation, peers, and mentors. Were there common themes or recurring praise? Equally, consider constructive criticism as an opportunity for refinement. Testimonials and stories of transformation provide tangible evidence of the impact of your pastoral care. Let these narratives guide your understanding of your ministry’s influence.\n4. Personal and Professional Development\nPastoral growth extends beyond the spiritual realm to encompass personal and professional development. Evaluate the skills you’ve acquired or honed over the past year. Have you attended workshops, sought mentorship, or engaged in continuous learning? Recognize that personal and professional growth contributes significantly to your effectiveness as a\nshepherd.\n5. Congregational Connection and Engagement\nThe strength of a\npastor lies not just in the pulpit but in the connections forged within the congregation. Measure your growth by the depth of these connections. Have you fostered a sense of community? Have you engaged with your congregation on a personal level, beyond the formalities of church services? The relationships you’ve built are a testament to the growth of a vibrant, connected community.\nAs you reflect on this past year, remember that growth is often subtle, and its impact may not always be immediately apparent. Embrace both the successes and the challenges as opportunities for refinement and improvement. The journey of a pastor is a continuous cycle of growth and learning, and each year brings new insights and experiences.\nMay the lessons of the past year fuel your passion for the ministry, and may you continue to grow in grace and wisdom in the year ahead.\nThis article originally appeared\nhere.",

    "text": "Murr. Im Tarifkonflikt beim Dönerspieß-Hersteller Birtat gibt es eine Einigung - es ist zugleich nach Gewerkschaftsangaben der erste Tarifvertrag in der Dönerfleischindustrie. Für die rund 120 Beschäftigten wurde der Einstiegslohn auf 2.600 Euro festgelegt, wie die Gewerkschaft Nahrung-Genuss-Gaststätten (NGG) und das Unternehmen Meat World SE (Birtat) in Murr bei Ludwigsburg gemeinsam mitteilten. Ferner sei eine Anhebung der Entgelte in zwei Stufen im Gesamtumfang von bis zu 17 Prozent in der Spitze bei einer Laufzeit bis Ende 2026 vereinbart worden. Für eine direkte Stellungnahme war das Unternehmen zunächst nicht erreichbar.\nAdUnit Mobile_Pos2 AdUnit Content_1 Die Gewerkschaft NGG forderte eine Erhöhung der Entgelte um 375 Euro und einen Tarifvertrag. Bisher wurde die Arbeit an elf unterschiedlichen Tagen zeitweise niedergelegt. NGG-Verhandlungsführerin Magdalena Krüger sagte, dieser Tarifabschluss sei ein historisches Ergebnis in der Dönerfleischbranche und ein Erfolg der Beschäftigten. Cihan Karaman, der Pressesprecher der Meat World SE erklärte laut der gemeinsamen Mitteilung: «Wir sind überzeugt, dass dieser Vertrag nicht nur Planungssicherheit schafft, sondern auch das Vertrauen und die Zusammenarbeit zwischen Unternehmen und Beschäftigten stärkt.»\nBirtat gehört zur Meat World SE und ist der NGG zufolge der größte Hersteller von Dönerspießen in Baden-Württemberg - und einer der führenden Anbieter in Deutschland. In der Fabrik stecken die Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter Fleisch vom Kalb, Hähnchen oder Rind auf Spieße - und geben dem Ganzen die traditionelle Form. Die Spieße werden dann schockgefrostet und ausgeliefert.\n© dpa-infocom, dpa:250808-930-888721/1",
