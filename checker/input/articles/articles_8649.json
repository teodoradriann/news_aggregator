    "title": "Friends and family mourn the loss of Canadians killed by Hamas in Israel - SaskToday.ca",
    "text": "Friends, family and government officials have confirmed that at least seven Canadians were killed when Hamas militants conducted a series of attacks in Israel on Oct. 7. Global Affairs Canada has said an eighthperson who was not a citizen but had deep ties to Canada also died in the ensuing conflict. Another Canadian, who has not been identified, died in Lebanon during the hostilities. The Hamas attacks killed an estimated 1,200 people and militants took another 240 hostage, 105 of whom were released during a temporary pause in the violence at the end of last month. As Israel continues its retaliation on Hamas in the Gaza Strip, authorities there say more than 20,000 Palestinians have now been killed. Here's what we know about the Hamas victimswith ties to Canada: Judih Weinstein Haggai Judih Weinstein Haggai, 70, was out on an early-morning walk when Hamas started its attack, her family says. She told members of her Nir Oz kibbutz that a militant on a motorcycle shot her husband and she was less severely wounded. The community was unable to dispatch an ambulance before militants arrived there. Last week, the kibbutz confirmed Gadi Haggai, Judih's husband, died on Oct. 7, and on Thursday they confirmed Weinstein Haggai also died that day, and her body is being held in Gaza. Weinstein Haggai was born in New York state but arrived in Toronto at the age of three, and moved to Israel 20 years later to live with her husband. She held Canadian, Israeli and American citizenships. Weinstein Haggai was an artist and a volunteer who the kibbutz said \"pursued many initiatives to advance peace in the region.\" Her brother Larry Weinstein said the family is distressed by Israel's offensive in Gaza and the rise of hateful speech in Canada toward both Jews and Muslims. \"We're inspired by my sister, who believed in peace and believed in harmony,\" he said. \"There can't be any kind of resolution when people are at each other's throats.\" Vivian Silver Vivian Silver, 74, was in her home on Kibbutz Be'eri near the Gaza border and talking on the phone with her son Yonatan Zeigen when they learned of the incursion by Hamas into Israel. \"We couldn’t grasp the incapability of the Israeli army to defend the civilians … we started to say goodbye because we realized this is probably our last words to each other,\" Zeigen later told a news conference organized by the Jerusalem Press Club. He said they shifted their conversations to text messages so his mother could stay silent, and someone broke into her home. They said they loved one another before the messages stopped coming. Zeigen said he had received information that she was taken hostage, and her phone had been geolocated in Gaza. On Monday, his brother Chen Zeigen confirmed their mother's death. He said Israeli authorities told him the remains found earlier in the kibbutz had been identified as Silver. He said his mother was born in Winnipeg and moved to Israel in 1974. She dedicated her life to peacebuilding and fostering understanding between Israelis and Palestinians, he added. She also volunteered to help children in Gaza access medical care in Israel. Tiferet Lapidot Tiferet Lapidot, 22, was a few days shy of her 23rd birthday and attending a music festival when the Hamas attack began. Her cousin Oran Zlotnik remembered Lapidot as a charismatic and compassionate person who had travelled the world, taught in Africa and spent time in Australia before she returned to Israel in the fall. Her uncle Harel Lapidot said she called her mother the morning of the attack to say she was hiding in a bush and to ask whether she should flee. Her cellphone was later tracked to the Gaza Strip, leading family to believe she was being held hostage. They then mounted a campaign to secure her freedom. Zlotnik said that when the cellphone of one of Lapidot's friends, confirmed deceased, was also traced to Gaza, the family realized it was possible she wasn't a hostage. Harel Lapidot said his niece's body was later identified and the family held a funeral. \"We know for a fact they were hunted,\" he said. \"They ran away and they were hunted and killed.\" Tiferet Lapidot was an Israeli citizen but her family was from Canada, including her father, Ohad, who was born in Saskatchewan. Harel Lapidot thanked the Jewish community in Canada and MPs who had reached out to help and offer support. The family had a meeting with Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly while she was in Israel. Netta Epstein Israeli-Canadian Netta Epstein, 21, died when his home, Kibbutz Kfar Aza, came under attack. His mother, Ayelet Shachar-Epstein, said he loved life. She learned the circumstances of his death from text messages he sent her in the moments before he was killed, and from his fiancée, Irene Shavit, who survived. Netta Epstein was inside a safe room with Shavit, and he jumped on a grenade thrown in by the attackers. Shachar-Epstein, who also lost her mother-in-law and two brothers-in-law in the attacks, described it as a terrorist invasion. She said her son, who had worked with special needs youth, had returned home two months earlier after completing military service. He was born in Montreal and was a Canadian citizen. Shachar-Epstein said many members of the family still live in that city. Shir Georgy Israeli Canadian Shir Georgy, 22, was killed by Hamas militants who ambushed the music festival near Kibbutz Re'im. Georgy's aunt Michal Bouganim confirmed the death. \"We are currently a mess, heartbroken,\" Bouganim said in a Facebook message. Bouganim shared a 22-second clip on her social media in which a terrified Georgy was seen sitting on a floor, with her back against a wall and surrounded by other festival attendees — some of them injured. Georgy's funeral was held in Israel. Adi Vital-Kaploun Adi Vital-Kaploun, 33, was killed by Hamas militants in her kibbutz near the Israeli border with the Gaza Strip, said the Jewish Federation of Ottawa. The group's CEO made a statement on behalf of Vital-Kaploun's family, saying the dual citizen has a large extended family in the Ottawa area. The family said she died a hero, after convincing her killers to spare her two young children and warning her father and husband to stay hidden during the attack. \"Adi was a beautiful woman that brought love and lightness to the people around her, but also she was very focused and determined to make a beautiful life for her family,\" her cousin-in-law Aaron Smith said in an interview. The family said she was an amazing mother and wife, always bringing love and laughter to their household. She was also a talented dancer, saxophonist and basketball player. After completing her master's degree in engineering, Vital-Kaploun excelled in her cybersecurity career, they said. \"We are mourning trying to process this unconscionable act of terrorism in her kibbutz and across the country,\" said the family, adding that they wish her memory to be \"a blessing.\" Ben Mizrachi Canadian Ben Mizrachi was one of at least 260 people gunned down by Hamas militants at the music festival in southern Israel. Mizrachi, 22, from Vancouver, was described as \"larger than life with a big personality\" in a statement by his former high school in B.C. Ezra Shanken, CEO of the Jewish Federation of Greater Vancouver, said Mizrachi was about to start university in Israel after serving with the country's national defence force. Hilit Nurick, a home economics teacher at King David High School in Vancouver, remembered Mizrachi as a \"kind, wonderful, and community-minded\" young man who had a positive influence on everyone around him. Nurick said she and Mizrachi once put a large event together for more than 100 people at school. \"He was in charge of making Moroccan-style spicy fish stew. He brought his mother's recipe and shared it with everyone and taught us how to make it,\" said Nurick. \"He was incredible, just an incredible human being.\" Alexandre Look Alexandre Look, who had recently celebrated his 33rd birthday, was among those killed while attending the musical festival. Look, who lived in Montreal with his family before moving to Mexico, died a hero, his dad said in a Facebook post. \"Like a true warrior he left as a hero wanting to protect the people he was with,\" Alain Haim Look said. Friend Lior Horovitz described him as a \"once-in-a-lifetime person\" who became like family during their five-year friendship. In a phone interview from a town outside Tel Aviv, she said she and her boyfriend met Alexandre Look in Mexico. They became fast friends and would organize their vacations to meet up, either in Mexico or Israel. He was a proud Jewish Canadian and a generous person who would do anything for his friends, she said. \"He's a person who loves people,\" she said. \"He's the guy that's always going to help others, especially if they are Jewish.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 28, 2023.

    "text": "“Hippie Christian Group” Turns Out To Be Cult That Tells Followers To Donate Their Kidneys A controversial group dubbed “The Kidney Cult” encourages followers to donate their organs to strangers. Officially named [The Jesus Christians](https://www.boredpanda.com/horrible-childhood-stories/), the group has consequently drawn criticism and accusations of being a manipulative and destructive cult. The Jesus Christians, a secretive community led by David McKay, was formed in 1981. Its headquarters are tucked away in suburban Melbourne, Australia. The Kidney Cult’s Aussie members live in a nondescript home, but smaller congregations have since emerged in other parts of the world, including Canada, the US, Mexico, and Kenya. Almost two decades ago, David and his followers, who currently include a few hundred worldwide, hosted a whipping of their members in a public display of supposed atonement for the sins of others, [7News ](https://7news.com.au/spotlight/spotlight-exclusives/7news-spotlight-investigates-the-kidney-cult-inside-the-church-that-encourages-followers-to-donate-their-organs-c-14720590)reported on Monday (May 20). The Jesus Christians, dubbed “The Kidney Cult,” encourage followers to donate their organs to strangers Image credits: [TV Central](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3voJAOXWI0) Despite other [scandals](https://www.boredpanda.com/jordan-turpin-boyfriend-house-of-horror-matt-ryan/) emerging in the news, the group is best known for being referred to as The Kidney Cult, with devout followers encouraged to donate a kidney to complete strangers as an act of kindness. The purpose of this seemingly heroic gesture is currently unknown. [Cult ](https://www.boredpanda.com/man-raised-cult-kingston-group-mormon-reveals-horrifying-truth-inside-practices/)specialist Rick Ross told 7News: “Think of the people that have donated kidneys because Dave McKay influenced them and coerced them in his own methodical way to give up a kidney. “Those people are scarred literally for the rest of their lives. “Dave McKay’s demands on them will change their lives forever.” Image credits: [TV Central](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3voJAOXWI0) Rick has reportedly followed The Jesus Christians closely and subsequently found that the group fit the profile of a “destructive [cult.](https://www.boredpanda.com/children-of-god-cult-survivor-horrifying-stories/)” He explained: “Over the years, he has recruited very young people often, and they are idealistic. “They care about the condition of the world. “They have faith in God, they believe in the Bible.” The group has drawn criticism and accusations of being a manipulative and destructive cult Image credits: [TV Central](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3voJAOXWI0) “And Dave McKay manipulates that and orchestrates that for his own purposes. “I see him as a deeply narcissistic man, a man that craves attention, and he will do virtually anything so that he can get attention.” In 2007, a Canadian hospital refused to accept the offer of a kidney to a stranger by one of the group’s members as a way of expressing his faith in God, [The Sydney Morning Herald](https://www.smh.com.au/national/hospital-refuses-to-accept-kidney-20070605-gdqb00.html) reported. At the time, over half of the Jesus Christian members had donated a kidney to people they did not know prior to agreeing to donate. Image credits: [TV Central](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3voJAOXWI0) Renee Spencer, mother to daughter Ellicia, who has been embroiled in the [cult](https://www.boredpanda.com/escaping-twin-flames-universe-jeff-shaleia-netflix/) since 2017, told 7News that Elicia found The Jesus Christians on YouTube when she was 22 years old. According to Renee, her daughter began fervently watching their videos, emailing a contact address on the channel, and meeting members in person. One of the members, a man named Joseph, would reportedly become her husband within months. Renee told 7News: “She fell in love. I think she genuinely fell in love with Joseph almost as soon as she met him.” The secretive community, led by David McKay, was formed in 1981 Image credits: [ The 𝐓𝐑𝐔𝐓𝐇 shall make you free](https://youtu.be/Fa-wolpHn04) When Ellicia joined The Jesus Christians, Renee reportedly said she didn’t initially open up completely on the nature of the church. Instead, Elicia directed her mom to a website that, on the surface, “just seemed very much like that website that they were just this hippie [Christian](https://www.boredpanda.com/woman-moves-from-gibraltar-to-oklahoma-live-trad-wife-lifestyle/) group.” Ultimately, Renee came to understand that her daughter hadn’t simply joined any Christian group. The heartbroken mom said: “It’s led by a controlling, manipulative leader who thinks that he has divine authority and that he’s an apostle of God.” Renee went on to sue David for defamation after one of his videos accused her of worshipping the devil. An official [court document ](https://www.countycourt.vic.gov.au/files/documents/2023-12/judgement-spencer-v-mckay.pdf)showed that on December 18, 2023, Renee won the case, and a judge awarded her $85,000 in damages and $100,000 in court costs. “This case involves a plaintiff whose daughter joined a religious group,” the document reads. “Ms Spencer considers that the religious group is a coercive [cult](https://www.boredpanda.com/british-boy-alex-batty-found-alive-france-6-years-missing/).” It further states: “Ms Spencer has become estranged from her daughter and believes that the estrangement has been orchestrated by the defendant in his capacity as the leader of that group.” The group’s headquarters are tucked away in suburban Melbourne, Australia Elicia went as far as to testify against her mother, further damaging an already frayed relationship. Meanwhile, David has been adamant that he is not the figurehead of a cult, telling 7News that calling his church a cult is akin to calling someone an “a**hole.” He told the Australian broadcaster: “It’s just an insult. “That’s all it’s, it’s purely and simply an insult.” watching this kidney cult on spotlight, the owner of Jesus Christians is not even a real Christian.

According to the [World Religions and Spirituality Project](https://wrldrels.org/2019/05/19/jesus-christians/) and [New Religious Movements](https://newreligiousmovements.org/j/jesus-christians/), the group rejects traditional Christian institutions, criticizing them as overly focused on doctrine rather than the direct teachings of Jesus. Their activities have included public demonstrations and the distribution of religious literature. Despite announcing their disbandment in 2010, they have continued their work through various online platforms, maintaining a presence and promoting their beliefs.

    "title": "'I can't leave now' - filmmaker was determined to tell Ferguson's story after Michael Brown killing",
    "text": "FERGUSON, Mo. — One event can change the trajectory of a person's life, and certainly, the unrest that followed after the death of Michael Brown greatly affected a Ferguson filmmaker. Christopher Phillips lived in the Canfield Apartments for years, right in the heart of Ferguson's Third Ward. He spent much of that time paying a higher monthly rent simply to have the freedom of going month-to-month. He had spent years trying to move but was too busy trying to break into film and television. \"I was just in my little one-bedroom apartment, doing multiple things, working multiple jobs,\" said Phillips. \"I just didn't have the time to look for a new apartment and things like that.\" But on August 9, 2014, when 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot and killed by police, it brought protests right to Phillips' front door. \"When that shooting happened, I was just like, 'I can't leave now.'\" Phillips said he started shooting video on the second day of protests and never looked back. As he was documenting the community response to Brown's death, he realized he needed to utilize storytelling for the common good. He started looking into systemic and institutionalized issues that served as catalysts to Brown's shooting. He tried to provide context and nuance to complex issues. He added a perspective from the inside, out. \"For me, I understood how important it was having lived in Ferguson,\" said Phillips, who had also experienced racism and systemic challenges growing up in the city. It wasn't just about documenting what was happening around him. His goal was to spark change, and for the next decade, he recorded how Ferguson shaped national conversations centered around racial justice. Phillips created a short documentary called Ferguson 365 , which got picked up at a dozen festivals, domestically and internationally. It won awards for taking a deeper look at the racial divide in Missouri and how the once-Caucasian suburb transformed into the community it is today, predominantly Black. All the while, Phillips has faced costly and painful challenges. Police in Ferguson arrested him in 2015 while recording a protest in Ferguson. He and others claimed they also confiscated cameras and destroyed footage, which five people challenged in a federal lawsuit. In 2020, Phillips traveled the country covering unrest after the killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, both at the hands of police officers. Police pepper sprayed him at another protest in Ferguson in 2020, and Phillips also went viral while shooting a peaceful Black Lives Matter protest in the Central West End. \"I had a moment where I was filming when the protesters walked past [the McCloseky's house], and there's this shot of me pointing my camera at her [Patricia McCloskey] and she's pointing her gun at me.\" Patricia and Mark McCloskey went viral after pointing their guns at protestors as they marched through the Central West End. The protestors were attempting to march to the home of then-mayor Lyda Krewson. The McCloskeys drew their guns on the protestors, which launched them into the national spotlight, which later included a failed senate attempt for Mark and misdemeanor charges for the couple. \"For me, the end game is peace,\" said Phillips. \"It's been a blessing, but there's ups and downs to it, you know. I've been fortunate enough to be profiled by the Washington Post, and Aljazeera, and lend my voice to the conversation.\" Phillips also works with corporations for inclusion work. That might mean making a Black excellence video for Adidas or producing a video about a cultural celebration. Phillips is also working on a project that has yet to be announced, though it likely looks at social justice in retrospect. Even after a decade of compiling stories, he feels the work is needed now more than ever. And, for him, it all begins in Ferguson. \"I pray that God uses me in the way that he sees fit so that it helps other people,\" said Phillips. \"Ferguson is really a microcosm of a national epidemic and problem. Not everything has a happy ending, but we hope to get to that place.\"",

    "text": "Partidarios de Bolsonaro, 8 de enero de 2023 (Photo by EVARISTO SA / AFP) Brasil le ha pedido a Argentina información sobre decenas de partidarios del ex presidente Jair Bolsonaro que buscaron refugio en ese país para evitar las consecuencias legales a las que se enfrentarían por los disturbios en Brasilia del año pasado, como parte de un presunto intento de golpe de Estado . Los funcionarios policiales brasileños dijeron que la solicitud presentada el lunes era precursora de posibles pedidos de extradición.\nEl 8 de enero de 2023 , una semana después de que el presidente izquierdista Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva asumiera el cargo, miles de manifestantes irrumpieron en el Congreso, el Tribunal Supremo y el palacio presidencial en un alboroto que algunos esperaban que creara un caos que justificara un golpe militar para anular la elección de Lula.\nMiles de bolsonaristas del campamento golpista instalado ante el Cuartel General del Ejército, obra de Oscar Niemeyer, descendieron a la plaza de los Tres Poderes y asaltaron el corazón de la democracia brasileña. Los radicales estaban acampados desde hace dos meses frente a los cuarteles de varias ciudades pidiendo una intervención militar con un golpe de Estado contra el presidente electo.\nMiles de simpatizantes del ex presidente brasileño Jair Bolsonaro protestan contra los \"abusos\" del Tribunal Supremo, en la Avenida Paulista en Sao Paulo (EFE/Isaac) Fontana El diario O’ Globo ha informado que la acción policial permitió la detención de 49 prófugos que eran buscados en 18 estados. Según relató la columnista del mismo medio periodístico, Bela Megale, el gobierno de Lula da Silva enviará los datos al Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF), que investiga los actos golpistas de ese día que fueron provocados por los seguidores de Bolsonaro, para que emita las correspondientes órdenes de extradición.\nSegún han declarado los funcionarios de la Policía Federal a Reuters, se cree que entre 50 y 100 partidarios de Bolsonaro que habían sido acusados de vandalismo e insurrección por su papel en los disturbios habían huido a Argentina después de que el derechista Javier Milei asumiera el cargo el diciembre pasado. Brasil ha pedido a la policía argentina que identifique su paradero y también su situación en el país antes de decidir si solicita las extradiciones, indicaron los funcionarios policiales.\nLos fugitivos tenían restricciones de movimiento por orden judicial y algunos llevaban tobilleras electrónicas . Muchos de esos prófugos, algunos ya condenados y otros que todavía estaban bajo investigación, obviaron las barreras migratorias y se quitaron las tobilleras electrónicas que se les habían colocado para su seguimiento. En mayo, el portal UOL había consignado que el fiscal general de la República, Paulo Gonet, pidió que los prófugos sean incluidos en la notificación roja de Interpol .\nEl ex presidente brasileño Jair Bolsonaro (EFE/ Sebastiao Moreira) Se cree que habrían ingresado a la Argentina a pie por alguno de los puentes fronterizos, en baúles de vehículos particulares o a través del río Paraná. Además, todas las filtraciones se habrían producido en 2024.\n”La cooperación policial determinará cuántos son. Basándonos en la información que tenemos hasta ahora, estimamos que entre 50 y 100 de ellos están en Argentina”, dijo el martes a la prensa el director general de la Policía Federal, Andrei Rodrigues.\nLa policía federal de Brasil comenzó a investigar el caso después de que legisladores de derecha, incluido el hijo de Bolsonaro, Eduardo, visitaron Buenos Aires el mes pasado y pidieron públicamente al Gobierno argentino que tratara a los fugitivos como “exiliados políticos”.\nLa policía brasileña dijo que creía que la mayoría de los seguidores de Bolsonaro desaparecidos han solicitado asilo político. La Comisión Nacional para los Refugiados de Argentina dijo que no hace comentarios sobre las solicitudes de asilo.\n(Con información de Reuters)",

    "text": "There is a new, second security camera facing the door of Israel and Dorin’s cosy North London home. The first went up shortly after they returned from a family holiday to Jerusalem that coincided with the October 7 massacre, a truly terrifying experience that saw them cowering in a safe room with their three young children. Knowing from bitter experience that whenever there is tension in the Middle East that Jews are likely to be targeted, back in London, the couple quickly moved to protect themselves and their three children. The extra layer of security, however, came only this week after the British-Israeli couple — and their darling five-month-old baby daughter Ronnie, all smiles and chuckles when I visit them at home — suddenly found themselves on the frontline of the war against anti-Semitism. Shockingly, it emerged little Ronnie’s birth certificate had been defaced by a Home Office employee after being submitted for her first passport application. Israel and Dorin with their three children Ella, left, Adiel and Ronnie When the certificate was returned in the post, her parents were distraught to see that her father’s place of birth — Israel — had been crossed out and the document ripped. The impact on them has been seismic. Put simply, they no longer feel safe — even here, in their peaceful London suburb. ‘My heart beats a little faster each time the doorbell goes,’ admits Dorin, 29, talking for the first time about their ordeal and revealing that she now also carries a self-defence spray in her handbag. ‘I check and check again who it is before I open the door.’ Her husband, meanwhile, admits he fears a ‘Molotov cocktail’ could be thrown through their window as revenge for speaking out. Indeed, so intense are their concerns that they could be targeted the Mail is withholding their surname from this interview. Their brave disclosures — in a tense week that saw MPs express concerns that they could be attacked over a Gaza ceasefire vote, and the Hamas slogan ‘From the River to the Sea’ projected onto Big Ben — has caused a furore about the growing levels of anti-Semitism in the UK. Home Secretary James Cleverly attempted to calm matters on Wednesday, saying ‘some staff’ members of Sopra Steria — a Paris-based company contracted to process British passports — had been suspended pending an investigation. But Dorin and Israel are still justifiably on edge. After all, when you apply for a passport each and every personal family detail is disclosed. If such private details are in the hands of such seemingly committed anti-Semites, how safe can this Jewish family be, even in leafy area? ‘They have our names, our address, our ages — they know practically everything except my waist size,’ says Israel, 32, the owner of a drain engineering company. ‘They are handling the most sensitive information and they don’t appear to be good people.’ Ronnie’s birth certificate had been defaced by a Home Office employee after being submitted for her first passport application. When the certificate was returned, her parents found that her father’s place of birth — Israel — had been crossed out and the document ripped For as the couple reflect, while Israel is a war zone, the UK feels menacing to Jews in a different, but no less palpable, way. ‘What happened to us, and all the things that are going on, has made me wonder whether we have a future here — whether our children do,’ he continues. ‘The people singing “From the River to the Sea” down the streets and in our universities might one day be our leaders.’ Indeed, just a few weeks ago, Dorin saw a schoolboy on her street tearing down posters begging for the release of one of the hostages from October 7. Shockingly, the posters were of nine-month-old Kfir Bibas, the youngest hostage to be seized by Hamas, whose fate remains unknown. ‘I asked what the boy was doing and he just shouted “Free Palestine”,’ she says. ‘This beautiful baby has been kidnapped by terrorists. Where did people get this hate from? ‘There is a whole new generation being schooled in anti-Semitism. They don’t want us here; they don’t want us there; they don’t want us to exist. We are a people who try to fit in. We aren’t criminals, and this hatred follows us.’ Both parents look down at their smiling baby, utterly unaware of the headlines her birth certificate has created around the world. ‘She’s a drama queen and she doesn’t even know it,’ smiles Israel lovingly, as he plants a kiss on her head. But as he and Dorin discuss in detail what happened, his face becomes grim; at points, they both become emotional. The story started two weeks ago when they sent off Ronnie’s birth certificate for her first passport. Attached to the back of it was something called an ‘apostille certificate’ which requires a lawyer’s certification, and is necessary for dual nationals to prove the signature and stamp of any UK document is genuine — something Ronnie would need if she also gets an Israeli passport. Her first British passport arrived last week. Then, a few days later, her birth certificate was returned. The word Israel is on it three times, as place of birth for both parents, and as her father’s name. Her father’s place of birth had been furiously crossed out. As for the tear, it was clearly intentional. ‘When I saw the rip I thought, “Could this have happened by accident?”’ says Dorin. ‘But it is not a small cut. And when I turned it over, I saw that it went through the apostille [too]. And then I realised that the word Israel had been crossed out. ‘Then I became scared; we know there have been many instances of anti-Semitism and then it comes through my letterbox, into my home. How can anyone have so much of a problem with us that they would do this to a baby — not even a child but a baby?’ The impact on the family has been seismic. Put simply, they no longer feel safe – even living in their peaceful London suburb She called Israel who was at work. ‘I immediately came home,’ he recalls. ‘I felt killed from the inside. How could this happen?’ Like many Jews since October 7, Israel is on a WhatsApp group set up to help those who experience anti-Semitism, as well as to give out information about vigils for the dead of October 7 and the hostages (Jewish demonstrations are advertised mainly in secrecy and at the last-minute because of terror threats). On it, he wrote in Hebrew: ‘Is there a lawyer on here who can help? We got my daughter’s documents back from the Home Office and they crossed out the bit talking about Israel.’ A fellow group member put him in touch with the charity Campaign Against Antisemitism, who tweeted about his experience. Suddenly, Israel and Dorin found themselves discussed on television shows and in newspapers. ‘At first, I didn’t really want my name mentioned but the people from the campaign group said, “This is the story of every Jewish man and woman in this country”. ‘We all agreed something needs to be changed; at the very least someone in that position needs to be checked out to ensure they don’t hold dangerous values. That is not the Britain we know.’ Israel says he is now considering suing Sopra Steria for breach of contract, saying that, just as we citizens pledge to look after these documents, so should the people we trust them to. Their eight-year-old son and six-year-old-daughter — who they are not naming — are unaware of the events, but on Wednesday were in the newsagent with their dad when they saw their parents’ pictures on the front page of some of the papers. ‘They asked why, and we just laughed and said it was something silly,’ says Israel. ‘We will tell them what happened, but when they are older.’ Before all this, every day life for the family was utterly conventional: their daughter is gymnastics mad, so they spend their time ferrying her to lessons, while their Manchester City supporting son — despite being just eight — loves Harry Potter so much he has read all the books three times. Sundays sees them go enjoying long family walks. For Dorin and Israel, their daughter’s defaced birth certificate is nothing less than a punch in the stomach from a country they fell in love with when they moved here ten years ago — a country which, Israel says, helped his Holocaust survivor grandparents in their escape from a concentration camp. One of his grandmothers Rachel Erlanger-Cohen, who was captured by the Nazis in Holland, was freed from Bergen-Belsen by the British in April 1945 and then made her way to the then British-controlled Palestine. His other grandmother, Bitja Weinberger-Goldschmidt, whose father was a German diplomat who lived in Holland, was saved in an unusual and little-known 1944 deal called Transport 222 in which German PoWs in British-controlled Palestine were exchanged for 120 Dutch Jews in camps. Bitja, who was just six, was the youngest on the train out and travelled without her parents who, thankfully, survived and found her when the war ended. ‘The reason I was born in Israel is because my grandparents went there after the Holocaust,’ says Israel emotionally. ‘They knew it was the only place safe for Jewish people — that has become my sin, to be born there. ‘Both my grandmothers were in Holland and had passports which were stamped with the word ‘Judah’ and ended up in Bergen-Belsen. ‘Now my baby’s document has also been marked. Of course, this is nothing like what my grandparents went through, but it is a warning sign.’ And yet the couple still speak warmly about the country they chose to make their home. Both were brought up in ultra-Orthodox households; Israel in Jerusalem and Dorin in the North of Israel. After meeting as teenagers, they left Israel for adventure as a young married couple, travelling first to Ukraine where they worked as cooks. It was there they first met British people. ‘They were so happy and charming we thought we should visit,’ says Dorin. They came for a holiday and decided to stay for two years. Ten years later, they consider it home. Still religious, but not ultra-Orthodox, they have a large community of friends. They loved ‘British manners’ and ‘the peace’ says Dorin, who became a British citizen several years ago. Israel, a dual Israeli and Swiss national, nods in agreement: ‘It is quiet and peaceful. People are calm. When I came here, I didn’t know a word in English, but I soon realised many immigrants could be successful in London; it is an international capital where everyone is welcome. People could make something of themselves here. ‘That’s how it was a decade ago. Now I am not sure if things are going in the wrong direction.’ The family were staying with relatives in Jerusalem on October 7, when they were disturbed at 8am by the shriek of air raid sirens. Trained in what to do, they promptly ran into their safe room. It soon became clear this was more than just your average warning, however — whenever they ventured out of the room, more sirens would come, a clarion call telling them to hide for their lives. ‘We tried to make a game of it with the children so they weren’t scared,’ says Dorin. ‘But it is this mad thing where you are having to run to a siren because there is a rocket attack; that is something no one in England has experienced since World War II.’ Israel recalls hysteria on the streets as the news of the massacre spread; particularly among tourists who had no idea what to do, so he invited some of them into the family safe room. ‘My mother has dementia and she kept going backwards and forwards in time,’ recalls Israel. ‘At one point she got confused and said, “Don’t worry, my daddy will save us, he’s in the militia”. He’s been dead for 11 years.’ As the day went on, and the full-scale of the horror became known, Israel admits he had his first ever panic attack in the shelter. ‘I was crying, shivering and struggling to breathe. It felt mad to be like this — I have been closer to rocket attacks. But this time I had Dorin and the children.’ Later, he was to discover that his old school friend Elia Toledano had been taken hostage from the Nova Festival — his dead body was later recovered from Gaza by the IDF. ‘He was this sweet boy and they took away his future. Every person in Israel knows someone who was killed on October 7.’ In the last few days, since he started speaking out publicly, Israel has been contacted with story after story of people affected by anti-Semitism. It is not just Jewish people who have expressed their worries to him. ‘I went to my barber on Wednesday, who is not Jewish, and he said to me, “Thank you”. And I said, “Thank you for what?” He said: “Being the voice of the normal people. We only hear the crazy Islamists making a hell of a noise. But that doesn’t mean what they say is the truth. So I am glad you spoke for normal people.”’ What would he say to the ‘normal people’ of Britain who are concerned about this rising hatred? Israel, a thoughtful man, ponders for just a few seconds: ‘We need to let racist people understand that [these actions are] not in our names. These values have no place in our beautiful England. ‘For so many years it has been a welcoming place for Jews — it was the safest place in Europe — and became known as a ‘malkhut shel chessed’ in Hebrew or “Kingdom of Kindness”. ‘We need to remember those values not just for Jews, but for all minorities. If this is not a safe place for us to live, something has gone very wrong.’ *** [Read more at DailyMail.co.uk](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13118459/grandmothers-passports-baby-Jewish-parents-targeted-Passport-Office.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490)",

En este espacio, la Embajada de Israel en Ecuador, representada por el embajador Tzach Sarid, hizo entrega de 15 sillas de ruedas al Ministerio de Inclusión Económica y Social (MIES).\n(Sigue leyendo: Voluntarias donan 15 sillas de ruedas y ropa a Solca)\nImpacto de la Fundación Familia Herbalife en la nutrición infantil en Ecuador\nLeer más\nEste acto reafirma la calidad de vida de las personas con discapacidad y con la promoción de la cooperación internacional. El embajador Sarid explicó que esta donación se encuentra inspirada en el concepto judío de Tikún Olam, que significa “reparar el mundo”.\nEste principio filosófico y ético es central en la tradición judía y subraya la importancia de la responsabilidad colectiva. “Israel tiene el compromiso de apoyar a las comunidades vulnerables de Ecuador”, afirmó Sarid en intervención.\nLa entrega de las sillas de ruedas, además de ser un acto de solidaridad, refleja los lazos históricos de cooperación entre ambas naciones. Israel ha trabajado durante décadas en proyectos de desarrollo, inclusión y bienestar en diversos países, y en Ecuador, estos gestos de apoyo son una demostración concreta de cómo las relaciones internacionales pueden tener un impacto positivo en el día a día de las personas.\n(Te puede interesar: El efecto de esquivar la licencia por Abad)\nLa ONG Muchachos Solidarios vela por los niños vulnerables\nhttps://www.expreso.ec/buenavida/ong-muchachos-solidarios-vela-ninos-vulnerables-225758.html\nPor su parte, la ministra de Inclusión Económica y Social, Zaida Rovira, agradeció el aporte, destacando la importancia de contar con aliados estratégicos como la Embajada de Israel para lograr objetivos de inclusión y accesibilidad. “Gracias a este tipo de iniciativas, las personas con discapacidad pueden mejorar su movilidad, lo que se traduce en una mayor autonomía y una mejor calidad de vida. Este gesto refuerza nuestra misión de construir una sociedad más justa e inclusiva”, expresó Rovira.\nLa ministra también resaltó que este tipo de colaboraciones fortalecen el tejido social al promover valores de empatía, solidaridad y compromiso.
