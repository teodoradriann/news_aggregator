    "text": "A cremation-only cemetery at St. Katharine Drexel Parish in Frederick is the first of its kind in the area, according to Nathan Nardi, director of cemetery operations for the Archdiocese of Baltimore.\nThe site includes five standing columbaria, structures built specifically for the interment of cremated remains. Each granite hexagon has 72 niches, which can hold two urns each, whose shutters (doors) have brass plaques with the name of the deceased.\nFamilies proceed from St. Katharine Drexel carrying the ashes of loved ones that will be placed in columbariums at the parish’s new memorial garden following services Sept. 28, 2024, in Frederick. (Courtesy St. Katharine Drexel Church) The cemetery also has places for in-ground burial of ashes, which must be in biodegradable containers. “We didn’t want to introduce plastic to the area,” Nardi said. “We’re trying to be green.”\nIn addition to the archdiocesan cemetery, New Cathedral Cemetery in West Baltimore, about 50 parishes in the archdiocese have either graveyards or cemeteries. Graveyards are smaller, rectangular spaces immediately adjacent to the church; cemeteries are more set apart from the church. Not all the cemeteries are active and not all have columbaria for cremated remains, Nardi said.\nAt St. Katharine Drexel, the property, which was once part of a working farm, had family members buried there between 1803 and 1888. The parish “wanted to preserve that, because it was already set aside as a cemetery.”\nThe project includes a wall that displays headstones that were cleaned and preserved. “It tells the whole story, not just that we are burying people, but honoring past generations of people,” Nardi said. “The whole purpose of a cemetery is to honor the generations that came before.”\nThe site was dedicated and blessed Sept. 28. Nardi said before construction began, more than 100 families had purchased space in the new cemetery.\nA wall with the headstones of families that worked on the farm dating back to the 1800s and are buried in a family plot at what is now St. Katharine Drexel Church and St. John Regional Catholic School in Frederick, stands outside the new memorial garden at the Frederick parish. Some 26 plots in all were identified using ground-penetrating radar and are marked with a short obelisk-style markers. (Courtesy St. Katharine Drexel Church) The decision not to have full-body burials at St. Katharine Drexel reflects a growing trend in final disposition of human remains.\nAccording to a July 2024 report from the National Funeral Directors Association, more than six in 10 final dispositions in 2024 were cremations, up almost 3 percent from just two years ago. The NFDA expects cremations to take up 82 percent of final dispositions by 2045, with full-body burials decreasing to 13 percent by that time.\nCremation tends to be more popular in Western states, with seven states already at more than 83 percent. In Maryland this year, cremations were 55 percent of dispositions, versus 38 percent for burials.\nThe Vatican allowed cremation for Catholics beginning in 1963, as long as the practice remains in line with the fundamental belief in the resurrection. The remains should be interred in the ground or a columbarium, not kept at home or scattered.\n“Cremation is becoming increasingly more popular – with all people, not just Catholics,” Nardi said. “We expect that will continue to increase until the national average is closer to 75 or 80 percent.”\nAs a result, the archdiocese will continue to work with parishes and cemetery properties to create more opportunities for the interment of cremated remains. “At the end of the day, we need to have something parishioners want,” Nardi said.\nFamilies place the ashes of loved ones in one the columbariums at the new memorial garden at St. Katharine Drexel, Frederick, following Sept. 28, 2024, services and blessing of the new space. (Courtesy St. Katharine Drexel Church) Parishes in Glen Burnie and Fullerton are working on building columbaria, and his office is helping St. Bartholomew in Manchester to build a new cemetery. They are also working with another parish to install an indoor columbarium inside a chapel that was used as the former parish church, another unique project.\nAs the church celebrates All Saints and All Souls Day at the beginning of November, Nardi said a Catholic cemetery is a response to the call for the church to care for the dead, one of the corporal works of mercy. “We’re not driven by profit; we’re driven by mission. This is sacred ground, and it’s blessed that way.”\nProceeds from the cemeteries support perpetual care of the grounds and graves, as well as other ministries, such as burial of urns that people may have been keeping in their homes for years, and burial of miscarried or still-born babies.\nFather Patrick Carrion, director of cemetery management for the archdiocese, said the burial of urns in a common vault, done once a year for a nominal fee, ensures that cremated remains don’t become a “possession” that has to be passed along from generation to generation.\n“Be respectful and lay the person to rest,” he said. “It’s a relief for many. They know they are doing the right thing.”\nRead More Local News Calvert Hall Marching Band wins fifth national championship Catholic leaders call passage of abortion amendment ‘painful moment in Maryland history’ Volunteers relocate Giving Garden from St. Pius X to Immaculate Heart of Mary Corpus Christi embraces new mission of campus, marriage ministries Sister Elizabeth Mary Novak dies at 88 Jesuit Father Donahue, New Testament scholar and Loyola Blakefield graduate, dies at 91",

    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "text": "Vance Peronto, 57, covered his face in Anchorage Jail Court on Monday, April 30, 2018. Peronto, an Alaska State Trooper, is charged with attempted sexual abuse of a minor. (Casey Grove/Alaska Public Media photo) A former Alaska State Trooper has been sentenced to eight years in prison with four years suspended, after being caught by his own colleagues in a high-profile child sexual abuse sting.\nVance Peronto, 63, was sentenced on one count of attempted child sexual abuse in the 2018 case, according to a Thursday statement from the Alaska Department of Law. The prison term was handed down by Superior Court Judge Andrew Peterson.\nCharging documents say Peronto — then a Soldotna-based trooper with 16 years on the force — met his intended victim during an April 2018 traffic stop for driving with her headlights off. Although he knew she was underage, Peronto exchanged text messages with the 16-year-old girl in which he offered to be her “personal trooper.”\nPeronto eventually tried to end the escalating online relationship due to the risk it posed to his career, as the girl’s father learned of the messages and contacted troopers. The Alaska Bureau of Investigation took over the case, leading to his arrest.\n“Eventually, an ABI investigator, posing as the victim, used a social media account to arrange for Peronto to meet ‘her’ at a hotel,” prosecutors said Thursday. “On the designated day, Peronto arrived at the hotel and was immediately arrested. A search of Peronto during his arrest revealed recently purchased Victoria’s Secret underwear.”\nThe charges against Peronto said he arrived at the hotel in his patrol vehicle.\nTroopers ended Peronto’s employment after his arrest. They also conducted a wider investigation of his contacts with the public, after a lawsuit accused him of sexual harassment over disturbing text messages he allegedly sent to a state prosecutor’s personal cellphone.\nA jury took nearly three days to convict Peronto on the attempted-abuse count in March. It didn’t reach a verdict on additional charges of possessing child pornography, based on explicit images Peronto allegedly requested from the teen.\nAt his sentencing Wednesday, the Department of Law said Peronto’s defense presented him as a “least serious” offender, arguing for probation to two years of prison time. But Peterson imposed the full sentence sought by prosecutors, the department said, emphasizing the “twin sentencing goals of general deterrence and the reaffirmation of societal norms.”\n“Judge Peterson pointed out that general deterrence should be especially effective in this case as it is likely every trooper in the state will learn of Peronto’s sentence,” prosecutors said. “And he emphasized that the particular sentence was necessary at least in part because the Alaska community must be able to trust that members of law enforcement will not, themselves, violate the law.”\nUnder the terms of Peterson’s sentence, Peronto will spend seven years on probation after his release. Upon leaving probation, he must then register as a sex offender for the following 15 years.\nChris Klint, Anchorage Chris Klint is a web producer and breaking news reporter at Alaska Public Media.

(WFSB/Gray News) - A firefighter who was plowing the snowy streets of Trumbull, Connecticut, jumped into action to rescue four people and three dogs when he happened upon a house fire.\nWFSB reports Shaun Bogen’s quick actions were credited with saving the lives of the victims.\nThe Long Hill Fire Department said the house fire on Haviland Drive began just before 4 a.m. Sunday.\nWhile he was on the plowing route, Bogen discovered a house with a fire in the garage, according to the fire department. Bogen radioed into his base to alert them of the fire and called 911.\nBogen then sprung into action, waking up the four sleeping residents and their three dogs and making sure everyone was outside before the fire department arrived.\nA total of 26 firefighters responded to the fire, and the first unit to arrive found the fire most heavy in the garage and extending into the home.\nThe firefighters brought the fire under control in less than one hour.\nOfficials said there did not appear to be any injuries.\nThe cause of the fire remains under investigation.\nCopyright 2024 WFSB via Gray Media Group, Inc.
