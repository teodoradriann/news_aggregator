    "title": "Delhi Pollution: AQI Remains ‘Severe’, SC Orders Monitoring Of GRAP Compliance; Directs NCR States To Form Teams",
    "text": "Delhi: The air quality in the national capital remained in ‘severe’ category on Friday morning, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). AQI was recorded at 430 on Thursday at 6 am. A layer of fog also covered parts of the city affecting visibility. Minimum temperature dropped to 5 degrees Celsius on Thursday. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued yellow alert for today with maximum temperature predicted at 24 degrees Celsius and minimum temperature at 6 degrees Celsius.\nDelhi Pollution: Air Quality Across Delhi Anand Vihar (458), Alipur (427), Bawana (468), Ashok Vihar (457), Jahangirpuri (450), Rohini (454), Pusa (396), Patparganj (447), Vivek Vihar (452), Wazirpur (463), Shadipur (437), Narela (432), Mundka (465).\n#WATCH | Delhi: A layer of fog engulfs the national capital as coldwave grips the city.\nVisuals from Kartavya Path. pic.twitter.com/qb5lm2TdTj\n— ANI (@ANI) December 20, 2024\nResidents Demand Action Talking to ANI, Bhagat Singh, a local resident, said, “Pollution has become an incurable disease, especially for Delhi. This is a problem every year. Earlier, several people went for a morning walk here, but now, a lot of them have quit due to pollution. A willpower by the government is needed to resolve this issue.”\nSC On Delhi Pollution Furthermore, the Supreme Court on Thursday, directed the states of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana to implement complete bans on firecrackers similar to that imposed in Delhi.\nThe apex court was hearing matter pertaining to air pollution in Delhi-NCR, with focus on the year-round ban on firecrackers, the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), and implementation of the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016.\nIt also directed the NCR states to constitute multiple teams comprising officials of the police, revenue, and other departments to visit entry points to Delhi and monitor compliance with GRAP IV measures.\n“Considering the magnitude of the task, all NCR states shall create multiple teams. We also make it clear that the members of the teams so constituted will work as officers of this court and not officers of any government. So long as GRAP III and GRAP IV measures are in force, they shall regularly submit reports regarding compliance as well as breaches to the respective governments and stakeholders and give copies to the CAQM so that immediate action can be taken,” said the Supreme Court.\nGRAP IV Measures In Effect Notably, GRAP stage IV measures have been in effect in the entire NCR since December 16 after the deterioration in air quality. This decision came into effect after Delhi’s AQI surpassed the 400 mark after remaining ‘poor’ for several days. On Monday night, the AQI was reported as 399 at 9 PM and crossed into the severe zone at 401 by 10 PM.\nAlso Read: Delhi: School Receives Bomb Threat Again, Classes Shifted To Online Mode",

    "title": "Jalin Hyatt has incredible reaction to not receiving a target in Giant's loss to Eagles",
    "text": "New York Giants rookie wide receiver Jalin Hyatt didn't receive a single target in his team's loss to the Philadelphia Eagles on Christmas Day. That's despite the fact that Hyatt's six receptions for 109 yards against the New England Patriots in late November is still the best game by a Giants wide receiver this season. Hyatt played 35 snaps (56%) in the loss to Philly. While I'm sure it's frustrating for the former Tennessee Vols standout to get shut out by his own offense, he's not pouting because of it. In fact, quite the opposite. \"To me, I feel like I didn't help the team, that’s really how I take it,” said Hyatt said this week ( via SNY ). “Feel like I didn’t contribute. Feel like I wasn’t there for my team.” “At the end of the day you can look at it two ways,” continued Hyatt. “You can either be down and pout and have a bad week or you can come back this week and still prepare the same and still be ready for your opportunities at the end of the day it’s all about taking advantage of the opportunities. So that’s what I’m focused on.” “You can’t pout because you never know, next week it might be five targets for me, six targets, seven targets, and what if I’m not ready?” added the former Vol. Hyatt was known as incredibly hard worker during his junior season at Tennessee and it paid off in a big way on the field. We've already seen this season what Hyatt is capable of -- a 100 yard receiving game against one of the best defenses in the league -- and because of his refusal to pout, it feels like a huge breakout is on the way for the South Carolina native. The Giants just need to find a way to get him the ball.",

    "title": "Prenatal acetaminophen linked to higher risk of autism and ADHD",
    "text": "Researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai have found that prenatal exposure to acetaminophen may increase the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), in children.\nThe study, published today in BMC Environmental Health, is the first to apply the rigorous Navigation Guide methodology to systematically evaluate the rigor and quality of the scientific literature.\nAcetaminophen (often sold under the brand name Tylenol®, and known as paracetamol outside the United States and Canada) is the most commonly used over-the-counter pain and fever medication during pregnancy and is used by more than half of pregnant women worldwide.\nUntil now, acetaminophen has been considered the safest option for managing headache, fever, and other pain. Analysis by the Mount Sinai-led team of 46 studies incorporating data from more than 100,000 participants across multiple countries challenges this perception and underscores the need for both caution and further study.\nThe Navigation Guide Systematic Review methodology is a gold-standard framework for synthesizing and evaluating environmental health data. This approach allows researchers to assess and rate each study's risk of bias, such as selective reporting of the outcomes or incomplete data, as well as the strength of the evidence and the quality of the studies individually and collectively.\nOur findings show that higher-quality studies are more likely to show a link between prenatal acetaminophen exposure and increased risks of autism and ADHD. Given the widespread use of this medication, even a small increase in risk could have major public health implications.\" Diddier Prada, MD, PhD, Assistant Professor, Population Health Science and Policy, and Environmental Medicine and Climate Science, Icahn School of Medicine, The Mount Sinai Hospital\nOur findings show that higher-quality studies are more likely to show a link between prenatal acetaminophen exposure and increased risks of autism and ADHD. Given the widespread use of this medication, even a small increase in risk could have major public health implications.\"\nDiddier Prada, MD, PhD, Assistant Professor, Population Health Science and Policy, and Environmental Medicine and Climate Science, Icahn School of Medicine, The Mount Sinai Hospital\nThe paper also explores biological mechanisms that could explain the association between acetaminophen use and these disorders. Acetaminophen is known to cross the placental barrier and may trigger oxidative stress, disrupt hormones, and cause epigenetic changes that interfere with fetal brain development.\nWhile the study does not show that acetaminophen directly causes neurodevelopmental disorders, the research team's findings strengthen the evidence for a connection and raise concerns about current clinical practices.\nThe researchers call for cautious, time-limited use of acetaminophen during pregnancy under medical supervision; updated clinical guidelines to better balance the benefits and risks; and further research to confirm these findings and identify safer alternatives for managing pain and fever in expectant mothers.\n\"Pregnant women should not stop taking medication without consulting their doctors,\" Dr. Prada emphasized. \"Untreated pain or fever can also harm the baby. Our study highlights the importance of discussing the safest approach with health care providers and considering non-drug options whenever possible.\"\nWith diagnoses of autism and ADHD increasing worldwide, these findings have significant implications for public health policy, clinical guidelines, and patient education. The study also highlights the urgent need for pharmaceutical innovation to provide safer alternatives for pregnant women.\nThe Mount Sinai Hospital\nPrada, D., et al.

    "title": "León, en aviso este sábado por temperaturas que podrían alcanzar los seis grados bajo cero",
    "text": "MADRID/LEÓN, 13 Dic. (EUROPA PRESS) -\n El frío, las olas y el viento pondrán este sábado en aviso a seis provincias en un día en el que la peor parte se la llevará El Hierro (Canarias), con aviso naranja por viento, según la predicción de la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (AEMET).\n La mitad de las provincias afectadas lo estarán por avisos por bajas temperaturas: Huesca (Aragón), León (Castilla y León) y Lleida (Cataluña), todas con -6º C. Por lo demás, habrá avisos por oleaje en Girona (Cataluña); y por rachas de viento ambién en La Palma, La Gomera y Tenerife (Canarias).\n En líneas generales, AEMET prevé un día marcado por el anticiclón en la Península y Baleares, con predominio de cielos poco nubosos o con intervalos de nubes altas. La excepción estará en áreas del extremo norte peninsular, donde se prevé un ambiente más nuboso, con precipitaciones que afectarán al Cantábrico oriental y Pirineos.\n El organismo estatal no descarta que caigan precipitaciones en otros puntos del Cantábrico, oeste de Galicia, nordeste de Cataluña o norte de Baleares. Asimismo, señala que podría caer algún chubasco a primeras horas en Huelva. A partir de los 1.000/1.200 metros se esperan en forma de nieve.\n Por otro lado, la predicción recoge que habrá nubosidad baja matinal, con probables nieblas, que afectarán a zonas de ambas mesetas y depresiones del nordeste. Mientras, en Canarias, se pronostica abundante nubosidad de tipo medio y alto que tenderá a más a lo largo del día y dejará probables chubascos en las islas de mayor relieve al final, cuando también se prevé la entrada de calima ligera.\n En lo que respecta a las temperaturas, las máximas estarán en aumento, con ligeras subidas en la Península y Baleares y moderados incrementos en Canarias. Por otra parte, bajarán en el nordeste peninsular. A su vez, las mínimas estarán en aumento en los archipiélagos y en descenso en el resto.\n Durante el sábado, se registrarán heladas débiles en la mayor parte de zonas de interior de la mitad norte peninsular, este de la meseta sur y sierras del sureste, y llegarán a fuertes en montañas del extremo norte. Las capitales de provincia que registrarán valores más bajos serán León con -4ºC; Ávila, Palencia y Soria con -3ºC; y Burgos, Cuenca, Lugo, Segovia, Valladolid y Zamora con -2ºC.\n AEMET avanza que este sábado soplarán vientos del este y sureste en Canarias con intervalos fuerte y rachas muy fuertes en las islas occidentales. A su vez, también predominarán los vientos de componente este, pero en general flojos, en el sur peninsular; mientras que lo harán los de componentes oeste y norte, flojos, en el resto. Se prevén más intensos en el Estrecho, Cantábrico, Ebro, Baleares y Ampurdán, donde podrían darse intervalos de tramontana fuerte al final.\nLeer más acerca de: AEMET",
