    "title": "Are You Debating a Bot? Investigation Reveals Israel's AI Bots Argue With Online Critics",
    "text": "In recent months, reports have surfaced that Israel is deploying artificial intelligence not only on the battlefield in Gaza but also online, where the goal is to influence public opinion through social media bots spreading disinformation.\nIsrael has a long history of using social media for propaganda, whether by working with tech companies to flag pro-Palestine content or by mobilizing troll armies to support its narrative. With the advent of AI, Israel has found new methods to shape public opinion in its favor, employing AI-driven social media accounts to “debunk” allegations against the state.\nNour Naim, a Palestinian AI researcher, has observed this shift firsthand. “From day one, I have encountered a troubling number of fake accounts disseminating Israeli propaganda,” Naim told MintPress News. “These accounts, functioning as digital trolls, systematically attempt to either discredit well-documented evidence of the genocide in Gaza—backed by audio and video proof—or distort the facts altogether.”\nIsrael’s AI Troll Army Israel has long used social media to manage its image with great effect. It collaborates with tech firms to flag pro-Palestinian content and employs coordinated online groups to quell online criticism. But now, AI offers new tools for influence. MintPress News has identified several accounts operating under names like Fact Finder (@FactFinder_AI), X Truth Bot (@XTruth_bot and @xTruth_zzz), Europe Invasion (@EuropeInvasionn), Robin (@Robiiin_Hoodx), Eli Afriat (@EliAfriatISR), AMIRAN (@Amiran_Zizovi), and Adel Mnasa (@AdelMnasa96892). Each account appears designed to “debunk” criticisms and circulate a streamlined pro-Israel perspective.\nThese people aren’t real. Ai israel bots.\nI got banned for a week when I made this list btw and I’ve been shadowbanned ever since pic.twitter.com/ahzHvQMcmk\n— PoliticallyApatheticBozo (@the1whosright) September 10, 2024\nThe first three accounts do not mention Israel in their bios, but most of their posts exhibit clear signs of pro-Israel propaganda.\nFact Finder’s bio states: “Empowering #SmartConversations with AI-driven facts. Countering misinformation with knowledge, not censorship, one post at a time! #FactOverFiction .”\nThe account’s posts aim to debunk information portraying Israel negatively. This is done by replying to news articles or pro-Palestinian voices or by creating posts purportedly refuting reports on Israel’s killings of Palestinian civilians and aid workers, as well as other acts of state violence. Yet these so-called clarifications read like they’re straight from a military spokesperson’s transcript—often justifying attacks as the elimination of terrorists.\nThe X Truth Bot operates under two profiles: @XTruth_bot, established in August 2024, and @xTruth_zzz, created in January 2024. Both accounts are managed by the user Vodka & Seledka (@seledka_vodka), a British-Russian blogger. They promote a Telegram bot that claims to utilize Google search for verifying statements made on X, which Vodka & Seledka asserts to have developed. Notably, Vodka & Seledka follows several pro-Israel accounts and frequently shares Zionist content.\nEurope Invasion focuses mainly on xenophobic content targeting immigrants, particularly Muslims. The account frequently draws connections between pro-Palestine protesters and Hamas supporters, equating the two in its posts.\nRecent investigations have uncovered that the X account “Europe Invasion,” known for disseminating xenophobic content targeting Muslim immigrants and equating pro-Palestinian protesters with Hamas supporters, is likely operated by a Turkish entrepreneurial couple based in Dubai. Swedish news outlet SVT reported that this couple is also connected to the X account “Algorithm Coach” (@algorithmcoachX). When approached, the couple denied direct involvement, stating they had engaged an advertising agency to promote their business. Both accounts have undergone multiple rebrandings; notably, “Europe Invasion” was previously a cryptocurrency account under the username @makcanerkripto and has a bot score of 4 out of 5, according to Botometer.\nFollowing SVT’s investigation, Europe Invasion updated its profile, claiming to be managed by “Stefan,” a Montenegrin of Serbian origin. However, SVT reported that when they contacted the advertising agency linked to the Turkish couple allegedly behind the account, a person named Stefan responded — with an email account set to Turkish.\nThe next three accounts on the list—Robin (@Robiiin_Hoodx), Eli Afriat (@EliAfriatISR), and AMIRAN (@Amiran_Zizovi)—do explicitly reference Israel or Zionism in their Bios.\nRobin, who joined X in May 2024, describes himself in his bio as: “• Think of nothing but fighting • PROUD JEWISH & PROUD ZIONIST.” Two of these accounts use AI-generated profile pictures of Israeli soldiers. They frequently interact with each other, replying to and reposting each other’s content, and follow various pro-Israel accounts.\nOther accounts, including Mara Weiner (@MaraWeiner123), Sonny (@SONNY13432EEDW), Jack Carbon (@JaCar97642), Allison Wolpoff (@AllisonW90557), and Emily Weinberg (@EmilyWeinb23001), display bot-like behavior. Their usernames include random numbers, and they either lack a profile picture or use vague images. Most of these accounts were created after October 2023, coinciding with the start of Israel’s military actions in Gaza. They predominantly respond to pro-Palestine posts by promoting Zionist talking points.\nLebanese researchers Ralph Baydoun and Michel Semaan, from the communications consulting firm InflueAnswers, describe “superbots” as Israel’s new secret weapon in the digital information war over its operations in Gaza.\nEarlier versions of online bots were far more rudimentary, with limited language abilities, and were able only to respond to predetermined commands. “Online bots before, especially in the mid-2010s … were mostly regurgitating the same text over and over and over. The text … would very obviously be written by a bot,” Semaan told Al Jazeera .\nOn the other hand, AI-powered super bots that utilize large language models (LLMs)—algorithms trained on vast amounts of text data—can produce smarter, faster, and, most critically, more human-like responses. Examples of these LLMs include ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini.\nThese AI bots have not only been covertly deployed on social media; pro-Israel activists have also assembled AI-powered troll armies to bolster their messaging.\nIn October 2023, as Israel launched its military campaign in Gaza, Zachary Bamberger, a graduate student at Israel’s Technion University, created an LLM specifically designed to counter what he saw as “anti-Israel” content and amplify pro-Israel posts across online platforms.\nBamberger’s company, Rhetoric AI, is designed to generate translations of Arabic and Hebrew social media content, assess whether posts violate platform terms of service, and swiftly report any infractions. For posts that don’t violate terms, the tool generates what it considers the most effective counter-argument.\n“When deployed on a larger scale, our platform will shift the balance of content and take away the numbers advantage of those who propagate hate, violence, and lies,” Bamberger told the American Technion Society .\nTo develop Rhetoric AI, Bamberger enlisted the help of 40 doctoral students, and the company now collaborates with tech giants Google and Microsoft.\nAnother platform, AI4Israel , also leverages AI to craft counter-arguments on social media. Founded by Israeli-American data scientist and pro-Israel activist Amir Give’on, the tool is part of a volunteer-based project. In November 2023, Give’on promoted AI4Israel in a LinkedIn article and has since posted about the platform on his X account.\nGive’on provided details on how the AI4Israel platform operates, explaining:\nIt scans incoming claims and checks them against a pre-existing database. If a claim has been encountered before, the tool retrieves a stored response. If it’s a new claim, the tool generates a response using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model, which draws on a vast corpus of data.”\nHe also emphasized the role of volunteers in enhancing AI4Israel’s effectiveness:\nVolunteers prioritize claims based on frequency and refine responses, ensuring relevance and accuracy. They also identify gaps in our knowledge base, constantly enriching it, especially in response to current events.”\nThe Israeli government’s role AI has played a central role in Israel’s online influence operations, aimed at swaying public opinion on the war. In May 2024, social media company Meta and ChatGPT’s owner, OpenAI, disclosed that they had banned a network of AI-powered accounts spreading pro-Israel and Islamophobic content. The campaign, orchestrated by Israel’s Ministry of Diaspora Affairs and executed by Israeli political consulting firm Stoic, was designed to influence online discourse.\nNaim, a Gaza resident, highlighted the damaging effects of these disinformation efforts.\n“Every day, I face comments on Twitter [now X] where I am either accused of lying or my news is questioned, despite providing verified sources,” Naim told MintPress News.\nSome individuals…have denied the news of the death of seven of my cousins and family members, falsely claiming that their families are responsible for their sacrifices. This persistent disinformation campaign is a daily challenge as I strive to share accurate information about the atrocities occurring in Gaza.”\nIn September, Israel joined the first global treaty on AI — an international agreement established to regulate the responsible use of the technology while safeguarding human rights, democracy, and the rule of law. The treaty is in cooperation with the United States, United Kingdom, European Union, and other countries, and Israel’s participation was met with backlash , especially given Israel’s weaponization of AI to carry out its genocidal campaign in Gaza.\nYet Israel’s dangerous AI advancements on the battlefield and online may only intensify. In addition to joining the international treaty, Israel announced the second phase of its Artificial Intelligence Program, which will run until 2027 with an allocated budget of NIS 500 million (approximately $133 million).\nFor Naim, Israel’s misuse of AI to distort and fabricate information reveals a troubling side of the technology, particularly in its manipulation of public opinion, erosion of trust, and incitement of hate and violence.\nAs AI’s darker applications make it harder to distinguish fact from fiction, Naim suggests approaching social media content with “a healthy dose of skepticism.”\n“Not everything you see online is true, especially if it seems overly sensational or emotional,” Naim cautioned. “Always verify information by searching for the original source, checking its credibility, and looking for confirmation from multiple sources.”\nShe recommends watching for red flags, like spelling errors and doctored images, and utilizing verification tools, such as reverse image searches and fact-checking websites.\nYet, Naim notes, AI isn’t inherently harmful. “While Israel exploits AI for harmful purposes, we have the opportunity to use AI constructively,” she said. “By leveraging AI, we can amplify and accurately convey the Palestinian narrative, ensuring that the true stories of those affected by the genocide in Gaza are heard across multiple languages and platforms.”\nFeature photo |Illustration by MintPress News\nJessica Buxbaum is a Jerusalem-based journalist for MintPress News covering Palestine, Israel, and Syria.

    "text": "All-inclusive? Von wegen: Wie Hotels ihre Gäste austricksen\nZum Frühstück Sekt und „Käse bis zum Horizont“: Ein Hotelexperte verrät, wie sich all-inclusive für Hotels rechnet und für welche Urlauber es sich lohnt.\nWas haben\nEltern mit Kindern und Menschen, die im Urlaub gerne viel Alkohol trinken, gemeinsam? Für beide lohnt sich am ehesten ein Urlaub im All-inclusive-Hotel, sagt der Hotel- und Gastroexperte Michael Bauer. „Die Rechnung geht für den Gast nur auf, wenn man gerne Alkohol konsumiert. Sonst wird es schwierig, den Preis zu rechtfertigen“, erklärt er BuzzFeed News Deutschland von IPPEN.MEDIA. Auch Eltern gehören zur Zielgruppe, weil Kinder ständig etwas essen und trinken wollen würden. „Mit einem All-inclusive-Paket nervt das nicht mehr.“\nDrei Cappuccinos zum Frühstück, um 10 Uhr den ersten Prosecco,\nKinder, die abwechselnd Fanta, Eis oder Pommes fordern – für die entsprechenden Zielgruppen rechnet sich das All-inclusive-Paket also. Doch mit welchen Strategien beeinflussen Hotels ihre Gäste, um am Ende trotzdem Gewinn zu machen?\nTricks, wie All-inclusive-Hotels ihre Gäste im Urlaub beeinflussen\nHotels kalkulieren genau, was ihre Gäste konsumieren. „Bei Getränken rechnet der Hotelier zum Beispiel mit Pauschalen: Mehr als vier Cappuccinos trinkt niemand“, sagt Bauer. 4,70 Euro Wareneinsatz pro Person würde in etwa für Kaffee und Frühstück reichen. Beim Speisenangebot am Bufett würden die Hotels mit günstigen Sattmachern und Füllern arbeiten: „Hühnerbeine kosten fast nichts, Spaghetti-Salat macht satt und ist billig. Frische Komponenten findet man da oft nicht“, sagt Bauer. Beim Dessert sehe es ähnlich aus: Wassermelonen und Softeis für die Kinder – das sei günstig und fülle das Bufett.\nMit einfachen Tricks erwecken\nAll-inclusive-Hotels bei ihren Gästen den Eindruck einer breiten Auswahl. „Ein gutes Beispiel ist der Käse am Bufett. Da wird billiger Käse im Block gekauft, und ein guter Küchenchef schneidet ihn in Scheiben, Dreiecke und Würfel, legt ihn auf silberne Platten und präsentiert ‚Käse bis zum Horizont‘. Der Kunde denkt dann: ‚Was für eine Auswahl!‘ Aber in Wahrheit ist es immer derselbe Käse“, sagt Bauer. Mit kleinen Gläsern am Bufett könne das Hotel seine Gäste bei den eher teuren frischen Säften bremsen. „Sie müssten öfter gehen, und das macht fast niemand.“\nAuch bei alkoholischen Getränken hätten die All-inclusive-Hotels ihre Strategien. Inländische Spirituosen, Bier und Wein seien dabei, aber kein Bordeaux-Rotwein aus erster Lage. Stattdessen gebe es günstige Marken, die als Tischwein in vielen Clubs ausgeschenkt werden würden. „Teure Export-Spirituosen schließt der Hotelier aus, um sich abzusichern“, sagt Bauer BuzzFeed News Deutschland.\nWoran Gäste ein wirklich gutes Hotel erkennen\nDer Experte verrät, woran Gäste ein wirklich gutes Hotel erkennen: „Am Müsli!“ Gute Hotels hätten meist eine Getreidemühle, würden das Getreide frisch schroten. Manchmal werde es dann über Nacht in Orangensaft eingelegt. Am nächsten Tag kämen Apfel,\nNüsse und Beeren dazu. „Das sind die kleinen Details, an denen man erkennt, ob ein Hotel Qualität liefert oder spart“, erklärt Bauer.\nAll-inclusive-\nUrlauber wissen schon bei der Buchung, was sie am Ende bezahlen und können sich frei auf dem Hotel-Gelände bewegen. Damit dieses Konzept nicht von Touristen aus anderen Hotels ausgenutzt werde, gebe es in All-inclusive-Hotels sehr starke Sicherheitsmaßnahmen, weiß der Hotelexperte Bauer. „Die Anlagen sind vom Zutritt her gut geschützt, mit Security und Bändchen. Externe erkennt man schnell, etwa an anderen Handtüchern“, sagt er. Doch das Bändchensystem habe Schwachstellen. Es gebe nicht viele Hersteller, und Muster könne man sich gegen Geld besorgen. „Wenn jemand wirklich tricksen will, ist das immer möglich.“",

    "text": "Cannabis Significantly Improves Symptoms For Most Cancer Survivors, Confirms New Study A newly published study in the Journal of Cancer Survivorship has shown the prevalence and motivations behind cannabis use among individuals who have battled cancer. See Also: Cannabis Treatment Improves Cognitive Function, Reduces Pain And Depression Among Advanced Cancer Patients, New Study About The Study - Conducted at a comprehensive cancer center in Houston, Texas, the research enlisted 1,886 participants from 41 U.S. states undergoing cancer treatment. - Notably, the study found that 17.4% of respondents were current cannabis users, 30.5% were former users, and 52.2% had never used marijuana. - Among the 510 participants who turned to cannabis after their cancer diagnosis, 60% cited managing sleep disturbances, 51% pain, 44% stress, 34% nausea, and 32% mood disorders or depression as reasons, as reported by Marijuana Moment. See Also: BREAKING: Ibogaine Therapy Show Promising Outcomes For Veterans With Trauma Brain Injury Cannabis As Symptomatic Relief: A Closer Look Encouragingly, a substantial proportion reported significant symptomatic improvement, with 47.7% finding marijuana effective for cancer itself to a great extent, and 74% of those using it for nausea and vomiting perceiving substantial benefits. However, the study unveiled a low awareness of potential health risks associated with cannabis use during cancer treatment. Only 1 in 10 participants were aware of such risks, including suicidal thoughts (5%), intense nausea and vomiting (6%), depression (11%), anxiety (14%), breathing problems (31%), and drug interactions (35%). Author Recommendations: Policy And Education Researchers from the University of Texas’s MD Anderson Cancer Center emphasized the immediate need for medical guidance on cannabis use within the broader context of cancer treatment. \"With most survivors reporting benefits from cannabis use in cancer management, there is a need for more studies to strengthen current evidence on cannabis therapeutics,\" they stressed, also calling for the development of policies, clear guidelines, and educational programs for healthcare providers and survivors regarding the use, benefits, and risks of cannabis in cancer management. As the medical community navigates these findings, notable industry players, including Verano Holdings Corp. (OTCQX:VRNOF) and TILT Holdings Inc. (OTCQB:TLLTF), along with its subsidiary Standard Farms, have recently contributed to breast cancer awareness initiatives.

    "text": "Los Angeles Under Curfew As Atlético De Madrid Arrives Amidst Protests Los Angeles is currently grappling with a tense atmosphere as protests continue and a curfew has been imposed. These events coincide with the arrival of Atlético De Madrid for the Club World Cup, adding another layer of complexity to the situation. The convergence of civil unrest and international sports preparations has created a unique set of challenges for the city.\nCurfew Imposed Amidst Downtown Unrest As of Tuesday evening, a city-wide alert echoed across downtown Los Angeles, triggered by Mayor Karen Bass’s curfew decree. The curfew, effective from 8 P.M.to 6 A.M., aims to quell vandalism stemming from Latin community demonstrations against Trump administration raids and deportations that began the previous Friday. The message warns residents to limit travel to essential work, home commutes, and emergency care, under threat of arrest. The situation is especially affecting the area around the Hotel Conrad,where Atlético De Madrid is lodging for the Club World Cup.\n“We are right in the heart of everything,” a club employee stated, noting the proximity to City hall and protest hotspots. The employee also admitted to experiencing sleeplessness, attributing it more to jet lag than fear.\nHeightened Security Measures The Los Angeles airspace above the hotel is buzzing with activity. Half a dozen helicopters and surveillance drones constantly monitor the area. Police sirens add to the cacophony, creating an unsettling environment for the visiting team. Despite the visible security presence, one member of the Atlético delegation downplayed concerns, stating that while the noise from the helicopters is disruptive, reports from Spain exaggerate the situation.However,nearby,citizens draped in Mexican flags continue to gather,voicing their discontent.\n“You shouldn’t resort to violence,” Gloria, a Los Angeles native raised in Mexico and an uber driver, cautioned. “You have to protest, but not fall into banditry as we are going to pay taxpayers with more taxes.” She ominously added, “The most powerful country in the world is about to collapse.”\nAtlético’s Preparations Under Watchful Eyes Diego Pablo Simeone, Atlético’s coach, was alerted to the situation by club employees who arrived earlier in the week. While concerned about potential disruptions to the team, Simeone’s primary focus remains on minimizing any impact on their training schedule. Two notable explosions punctuated Tuesday night near the team’s accommodation, amid patrols by local police and National Guard units dispatched by Trump. According to the club, security around the team remains consistent with their standard protocol, leaving any augmentation decisions to Los Angeles authorities. “We are aware of the riots that are happening because we see them from the hotel,but they have not altered our plans,” César Azpilicueta confirmed.\nChallenges and adaptation The current environment presents less-than-ideal conditions for atlético as they prepare for a competition crucial to their brand expansion ambitions. Los Angeles leaders hope the curfew will restore calm. By 4 A.M., the helicopter noise subsided, revealing another challenge: individuals under the influence of fentanyl wandering the deserted streets. This scene has also affected the Atlético members. However, they are eager to start their work and establish a sense of normalcy. Atlético commenced training this Wednesday at the Los Angeles Coliseum . The players initially worked out in a tent equipped with gym equipment and devices, before Simeone lead the team in intense drills, maintaining the high standards he set during last week’s training in Majadahonda.\nThe Argentine coach anticipates having all international players available by tomorrow, following their recent national team duties.\nKey Facts at A Glance Event details Curfew 8 P.M. to 6 A.M. in downtown Los Angeles due to protests. Atlético De Madrid Arrived in Los Angeles for the Club World Cup, lodging at the Hotel Conrad. Security Increased aerial surveillance with helicopters and drones; police patrols. Training Began at the Los Angeles Coliseum under Coach Simeone. Understanding Civil Unrest and Its Impact On Major Events Civil unrest can significantly disrupt major events, as seen in Los Angeles. Protests often lead to increased security measures, road closures, and potential safety concerns for participants and attendees. Cities hosting large-scale events must balance the right to protest with the need to maintain public order and safety.\nBest Practices For Managing Event Disruptions Enhanced Security: implement visible security measures, including increased police presence and surveillance. Dialog: Keep participants and the public informed about potential disruptions and safety guidelines. Contingency Plans: Develop choice routes and venues in case of protest-related disruptions. Community Engagement: Engage with community leaders to address concerns and foster cooperation. Pro Tip: Stay informed about local regulations and emergency protocols. Always have a backup plan in place!\nRecent data indicates that cities with strong community engagement programs experience fewer disruptions during major events. According to a 2023 study by the National League of Cities, proactive community involvement can reduce protest-related incidents by up to 30%.\nFrequently Asked Questions About The Los Angeles Situation\nWhy Was A Curfew Imposed In Los Angeles?

    "text": "A fantastic start to November, but heavy rain moves in for the weekend.\nWe are First Warning you that we have a series of soaking rains in the forecast that begin this weekend. But before we get there, we have a wonderful Friday to enjoy. The morning will have a bite with lows in the upper 30s, but bright blue skies and light northwest breezes will make for an enjoyable fall afternoon. Highs will be typical for this time of year, topping out in the low 60s.\nPlans outside Saturday may be OK for a good chunk of the day. Computer forecasts continue to bicker over the timing of the onset of the rain, with a minority bringing some rain as early as Saturday afternoon. But the bulk of our weather charts point to Saturday evening being the start of the rain. This will likely be heavy at times Saturday night and into Sunday. Sunday morning and the first half of the afternoon are likely quite wet, though we may catch a break by mid-late day Sunday. Highs through the weekend will be in the 60s.\nSo that’s round #1 of rain, with round #2 coming in Sunday night or Monday morning. This will make much of Monday wet, and potentially stormy. There is a chance for strong to severe storms. The timing for rain does include the Chiefs return to Arrowhead, so it would be wise to prepare for a wet and chilly tailgate and game. There is time for this to change, but the forecast has consistently looked wet for this time frame.\nRain likely comes to an end Tuesday morning or afternoon. The rain totals from Saturday through Tuesday could be impressive, with widespread 2-5″ possible, and even pockets of a half-foot not out of the question. At this point, it looks like the heaviest rain will be south and east of the Kansas City metro, with much lighter rain totals for northwest Missouri and northeast Kansas.\nCopyright 2024 KCTV.

    "title": "Irish Ukraine volunteer now missing in action revealed how deaths of friends and family motivated him – The Irish Times",
    "text": "A 20-year-old Irishman missing in action and presumed to be dead in Ukraine following a suspected Russian drone attack was motivated to fight on the frontline following the deaths of family members and friends. Alex Ryzhuk was officially deemed missing in action by the Ukrainian military while serving on the frontline in the war against Russia earlier this month and is presumed dead. Mr Ryzhuk, an Irish citizen from Rathmines in south Dublin and born to Ukrainian parents, travelled to Ukraine to fight more than 12 months ago. In an interview recorded on the frontline by filmmaker Finn Boylan in recent months, which aired on RTÉ's Prime Time on Thursday night, Mr Ryzhuk said he needed to be in Ukraine to help out while he still could. He explained that serious allegations against Russian soldiers such as rape initially motivated him, alongside the deaths of friends and family members. “I have a few friends from 18 to 23 who lost their life in this war, and a few older family members that also unfortunately lost their life in this war,” he said. He described war as “brutal”, saying those who value their life too much can panic and overthink, “but at the same time, if you’re not scared, you have a sense of like heroship, and you’ll die very quickly because of that because you’ll feel invincible.” “War is not a joke, death in war is a very high probability, and it is something that constantly happens, even if it’s not to you, it’s to someone else or to someone you know. “You always have to be on edge and just keep improving, because the moment you stop improving yourself is the moment where you get lazy, and that’s kind of the moment where most people start dying,” he said. Although initially planning to remain in Ukraine for a year, Mr Ryzhuk stayed on, saying that he was in an “addiction” stage of war. Mr Ryzhuk recalled how his parents had hid his passport after he informed them of his intention to go to Ukraine. His parents refused to return his passport until he “cooled down a bit”, he said, adding that it did not work, prompting him to apply for a new passport. “I got my new passport and didn’t tell anyone,” he said adding that he slowly collected money and eventually moved to Ukraine. His parents, who are from Rivne in Ukraine, moved to Ireland more than two decades ago. “I was born and raised in Ireland. Ireland has given me many opportunities and many things in my life that I’m grateful for. so I would consider myself Irish. “But at the same time, I cannot forget about my heritage and where my parents come from,” he said. - Sign up for [push alerts](https://www.irishtimes.com/media/2023/11/07/stay-informed-with-push-alerts-from-the-irish-times-delivered-straight-to-your-phone/)and have the best news, analysis and comment delivered directly to your phone - Join [The Irish Times on WhatsApp](https://www.irishtimes.com/media/2023/10/27/find-the-irish-times-on-whatsapp-and-stay-up-to-date/)and stay up to date - Listen to our [Inside Politics podcast](https://www.irishtimes.com/podcasts/inside-politics/)for the best political chat and analysis",

    "text": "El Papa no estará para celebrar el Jubileo de los artistas . Y es que, tal como han anunciado los medios vaticanos, debido a la hospitalización de Francisco en el Policlínico Gemelli este viernes debido a la bronquitis que padece desde hace cinco días, este no podrá estar presente en la celebración.\nEn su lugar, la eucaristía será presidida por el cardenal José Tolentino de Mendoça , prefecto del Dicasterio para la Cultura y la Educación . Asimismo, el Vaticano ha anunciado que se cancela la audiencia jubilar de mañana, sábado 15 de febrero, y la visita del Pontífice a los estudios de Cinecittà , prevista para el domingo.\nWhoopy Goldberg, en una audiencia del Papa con artistas en 2024\nIngresado después de cinco audiencias Francisco permanece desde esta mañana ingresado en Policlínico Gemelli, tal como anunciaba la Santa Sede a través del siguiente comunicado: “Esta mañana, al término de las audiencias, el papa Francisco ha sido ingresado en el Policlínico Agostino Gemelli para someterse a algunas pruebas diagnósticas necesarias y continuar en un ambiente hospitalario su tratamiento contra la bronquitis , que aún continúa”.\nJorge Mario Bergoglio, de 88 años, acudió al hospital después de cumplir su agenda prevista , que incluía cinco audiencias, lo que podría interpretarse no como un ingreso de urgencia, sino previsto y sin que revista una extrema gravedad.",
