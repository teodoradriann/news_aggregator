    "text": "Mexico Metropolis. President Andrés Manuel López Obrador pressured that reform of the Judiciary is “pressing” as a result of “there’s quite a lot of corruption” in that area of the Union. He “he’s kidnapped by each organized crime and white-collar crime, and he isn’t on the service of the individuals.”\nHe even hoped that in September, earlier than his administration ends, this reform may very well be mentioned and finally accredited.\n“I believe the brand new Congress might do it, in September, it’s the month of the homeland. In September it may very well be made, after all, that from immediately, in truth, the talk is already underway, but it surely have to be made public, as a result of those that don’t want the reform are already appearing. They’re already transferring as they all the time do. “Simply as they are saying in baseball, I’ve them effectively fielded, I already know they do not prefer it, as a result of there are 20 reform packages, that is the one that offers them rashes.”\nHe thought of that “he who owes nothing fears nothing”, which is why he known as on the Congress of the Union to convene the boards or no matter is critical to start the talk on the constitutional reform to reform the Judicial Department, an initiative that is likely one of the priorities for her eventual successor, Claudia Sheinbaum, as she herself expressed it yesterday after the assembly she had with the president.\nQuestioned within the morning about this initiative that he despatched final February, the top of the Government emphasised that it’s the “machuchones” who oppose this reform as a result of “they don’t want the individuals to elect the judges, the magistrates, the ministers. Why are they afraid of the individuals? Why are they afraid of democracy?”\nAs a result of it’s the sectors on the high who don’t like this reform, he mentioned, there’s nervousness within the markets. Nonetheless, López Obrador assured that the nationwide economic system “could be very sturdy.”\nTo which he added: “So, how lengthy will it final for them to be selling that nervousness, on tv, on the radio, within the columns of monetary areas?”\nHe highlighted that though as of late the peso has misplaced slightly towards the greenback, standing at 18.45 this morning, regardless of this, in his six-year time period the nationwide foreign money has not been devalued, however moderately has strengthened.\nThe person from Tabasco offered the stability of the neoliberal six-year phrases. In keeping with the figures with Miguel de la Madrid, the value was devalued by 4,482 p.c; with Carlos Salinas de Gortari he misplaced 47 p.c; with Ernesto Zedillo, 187 p.c; with Vicente Fox, 21 p.c; with Felipe Calderón the devaluation was 26.8 p.c; and with Enrique Peña Nieto it reached 56 p.c.\nHowever, he pressured, “with us the peso has not depreciated, it has strengthened, 10 p.c” upwards to date within the six-year time period.\n“No downside, no downside. They’re pondering, they’re used to blackmail: ‘No, you retain my privileges as a result of if not, look, there can be capital flight, there can be devaluation.’ That they had them like this, trembling (…) We’re going to go down in historical past as the federal government that didn’t devalue its foreign money.”\n#reform #pressing #organized #whitecollar #crime #kidnapped #AMLO\n– 2024-06-13 17:15:38",

    "text": "A group of roughly 50 people gathered Sunday afternoon on the third and final day of a demonstration opposing the Israel-Hamas war in a show of solidarity with students across the country. Again, demonstrators displayed signs around the area urging support for Palestinians and Gaza. The organizers, a student group known as as the Students for Justice in Palestine, have made several demands of university administrators, including: - An immediate end to all U.S. military funding to Israel. - That the University of Iowa fully divest from weapons manufacturers which arm Israel. - The dissolution of the University of Iowa Police Department. - The university, the Carver College of Medicine, and the UIHC \"make a statement in support\" of a ceasefire. Tension has been low throughout the weekend, with a few mild verbal exchanges with passersby during the Iowans for Palestine protest on the campus Pentacrest Friday afternoon. That hasn't been the case on other campuses across the country, where hundreds of protesters have been arrested during a wave of recent demonstrations. Police in riot gear arrested 132 people at UCLA in Los Angeles Wednesday night, a day after New York police arrested more than 300 individuals at Columbia University and City College. At the University of Iowa campus, the group has held conversational sessions about the Israel-Hamas war, a divestment training, a rights training and a Jewish Voice for Peace-led Shabbat this weekend. Sunday’s scheduled events included: - 1:30 p.m. — Understanding the Palestinian Struggle with Rima Afifi, a Palestinian-American University of Iowa professor and member of the school’s Center for Human Rights. - 3:00 p.m. — Music Circle. - 4:00 p.m. — The history of anti-Zionism at the U of I. - 6:00 p.m. — Interfaith community town hall. - 8:00 p.m. — Maghrib prayer and scheduled end of demonstrations.",

    "text": "Mumbai: The Bombay High Court has permitted Adani Cementation Limited to cut 158 mangrove trees for its proposed jetty project along the Amba River in Raigad district. However, the court underscored the importance of balancing development with environmental conservation and directed the company to strictly adhere to the conditions imposed by regulatory authorities.\nA division bench of Chief Justice Alok Aradhe and Justice Bharati Dangre stated that while the project serves commercial interests, it must not lead to excessive depletion of natural resources.\n“By ensuring that any activity, though aimed as a commercial activity, does not deplete the available natural resources — and even if it does so in a minimized way, by ensuring that its loss is compensated — we are convinced that the project propounded by the petitioner deserves our approval,” the bench observed. However, the court made it clear that the approval is subject to the company’s compliance with all statutory conditions.\nThe court further highlighted the importance of sustainable development, stating, “By keeping in mind the goal of sustainable development — of striking a balance between the necessity of the project, which aims at meeting the ever-increasing need for cement, and, at the same time, not compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs — it is necessary to ensure that the project results in minimum damage to the environment and natural resources, particularly when the entire planet is coping with the crisis of climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution.”\nFPJ Shorts President Donald Trump Doubles Tariffs On China To 20%, White House Says US Prepared For Any Trade War Fight Jhanak: Netizens Slam Hiba Nawab-Krushal Ahuja's Show For Allegedly Using Colour On A Newborn; Makers Clarify It Is A Silicone Baby (Video) Prolonged Use Of Anti-Inflammatory Pills May Help Prevent Dementia: Study 'President Donald Trump Delivered Justice For American Heroes Killed At Abbey Gate': US Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt On Detention Of Mohammad Sharifullah As a safeguard, the court directed the company to file an affidavit within two weeks, assuring compliance with the conditions laid down by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MOEFCC) and the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA).\nThe HC was hearing a petition by Adani Cementation seeking permission to cut mangroves to facilitate construction of a berthing jetty, conveyor corridor, and approach road to transport cement, clinker, and raw materials via waterways. The project, estimated at Rs 172 crore, aims to reduce road congestion and carbon emissions by shifting freight movement to water transport.\nMCZMA had granted clearance for the project on December 10, 2020, subject to compliance with mitigation measures. The High Court noted that the project serves a public purpose by supporting infrastructure development in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, which relies heavily on cement transported over long distances.\nCiting environmental concerns, the Bombay Environmental Action Group (BEAG) opposed the project, arguing that a captive jetty primarily benefits the company rather than the public. The NGO also questioned the project’s impact on CRZ-1A areas and mangrove ecosystems.\nHowever, the court rejected these objections, stating, “We are not at all impressed by the said objection, since we have the details before us which are also taken note of by the MCZMA and the Forest Department.”\nThe court acknowledged that the project will affect 0.6497 hectares of mangroves but noted that Adani Cementation has committed to planting ten times the number of affected trees as compensatory afforestation. The company also plans to implement eco-friendly measures, including a mechanised conveyor system to reduce noise pollution and prevent material spillage.\nThe bench observed that shifting cement transport to waterways aligns with India’s commitment under the Paris Agreement to reduce carbon emissions. The court referred to studies highlighting the environmental benefits of water transport, noting that “1 liter of fuel moves 24 tonnes per kilometer via road, 95 tonnes via rail, and 215 tonnes via waterways.”\nThe court further noted, “... we find exhaustive deliberation about the nature of the Project covering a jetty to be used for transporting cement through sea or inland waterways instead of road, which according to us will achieve the object of easing congestion in roads and help in reduction of carbon emission by more than 60%.”\nRead Also Bandra Reclamation Project: Adani Group, MOEFCC Assert Land Is Outside CRZ, Defend Development In... <img data-src=\"https://media.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2024-01/1123bcb9-5087-4791-97c5-96d1cc28f663/2023_05_26.jpg\" ?format=webp&w=768&dpr=1.3 \" src=\" images/FJP-default-16x9.png\" alt=\"article-image\"> Adani Cementation has already secured approvals from the Maharashtra Maritime Board, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC), and the Forest Department.

Concrètement, [comme nous l’expliquait David Dehenauw](https://www.sudinfo.be/id906805/article/2024-10-30/la-goutte-froide-responsable-des-pluies-torrentielles-et-meurtrieres-en-espagne) ce jeudi, DANA (Depresión Aislada en Niveles Altos) est donc une goutte froide en altitude. « Due à la vague de chaleur de cet été, la température de la Méditerranée est toujours élevée. Cette chaleur ne disparaît pas, et le refroidissement se fait toujours plus lentement. » Auprès de nos confrères de [RTL Info](https://www.rtl.be/actu/belgique/meteo/le-phenomene-de-la-goutte-froide-cause-les-inondations-de-2021-est-ce-que-cela/2024-10-31/article/726482), le météorologue de l’IRM Pascal Mormal a rappelé que c’était bien ce phénomène qui était à l’origine des inondations qui ont fait des dizaines de morts en Belgique en 2021, principalement dans la région de Verviers. Et pour Frank Deboosere, météorologue ancien présentateur météo de la VRT, ce phénomène touchera assurément notre territoire dans le futur. « La question n’est pas de savoir si cela peut arriver, mais quand ? », déclare-t-il au[ Nieuwsblad](https://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/dmf20241030_93717672). « Et ce, même si nous ne sommes pas au bord de la Méditerranée. » « Certaines études avaient montré que la répétition de ce genre de phénomène avait une période de retour d’une fois tous les 400 ans. Il est évident que quand on prend en compte le réchauffement climatique, on a malheureusement de fortes probabilités d’assister à ce genre de phénomène dans un laps de temps beaucoup plus court », a pour sa part précisé Pascal Mormal. Au lendemain de ce drame, trois jours de deuil national ont été décrétés. Pedro Sanchez, le premier ministre espagnol, s’est rendu en visite à Valence jeudi matin. Les autorités ont lancé un appel à la vigilance auprès des citoyens, alors que les intempéries pourraient toujours perdurer. Inondations dévastatrices en Espagne : au moins 158 morts, mais le bilan va s’alourdir, il y a encore «des dizaines et des dizaines de disparus» Le dernier bilan provisoire fait état de 155 dans la seule région de Valence, la plus durement frappée. Deux autres décès ont été enregistrés dans la région voisine de Castille-La Manche, et un troisième en Andalousie, selon les autorités, tandis que plus de 13.000 Belges se trouvent dans la zone sinistrée. [> Maria Cajal, une Bruxelloise en séjour à Valence, raconte l’horreur des inondations](https://www.sudinfo.be/id906960/article/2024-10-30/aurait-dit-la-fin-du-monde-maria-cajal-une-bruxelloise-en-sejour-valence-raconte) Ce bilan, le plus élevé depuis des inondations qui avaient fait 300 morts en octobre 1973 dans le pays, « va augmenter parce que nous partons du principe qu’il y a de nombreux disparus », a prévenu mercredi le ministre de la Politique territoriale Ángel Víctor Torres. Revivez ci-dessous les informations les plus importantes de la journée: 20h50 «Je n’aurais jamais pensé vivre ça» «Je n’aurais jamais pensé vivre ça», a confié à l’AFP Eliu Sánchez, habitant de Sedavi, commune de 10.000 habitants dans la banlieue de Valence, racontant une nuit de cauchemar. «Nous avons vu un jeune homme dans un terrain vague réfugié sur le toit de sa voiture», a raconté cet électricien de 32 ans. «Il a essayé de sauter» sur un autre véhicule, mais le courant «l’a emporté». 19h25 Il y a encore «des dizaines et des dizaines de disparus» Il y avait encore jeudi soir «des dizaines et des dizaines» de personnes portées disparues dans le sud-est de l’Espagne, 48 heures après des inondations dramatiques qui ont déjà fait au moins 158 morts, a annoncé un ministre. C’est la toute première fois que les autorités espagnoles donnent une estimation du nombre de personnes portées disparues. «Nous avons déjà 155 morts dans la région de Valence, deux en Castille-La Manche et un autre en Andalousie, soit un total de 158 personnes, auquel s’ajoutent des dizaines et des dizaines de disparus», a déclaré le ministre de la Politique territoriale, Ángel Víctor Torres, lors d’une conférence de presse. 18h25 Les inondations 12% plus intenses que dans le climat pré-industriel, selon une analyse Les pluies diluviennes qui ont frappé l’Espagne ont été 12% plus importantes et deux fois plus probables que lorsque le climat ne s’était pas réchauffé, ont estimé jeudi les scientifiques du World Weather Attribution, un réseau de référence, dans une analyse rapide. Le réseau d’experts, qui a systématisé une méthode scientifique pour estimer le lien entre des phénomènes météorologiques extrêmes et le changement climatique, prévient toutefois que vu le caractère très récent de l’événement, son «analyse n’est pas une étude d’attribution complète et détaillée» comme il a l’habitude d’en faire, «car les scientifiques n’ont pas utilisé de modèles climatiques pour simuler l’événement dans un monde sans réchauffement d’origine humaine». Une étude d’attribution complète met généralement plusieurs jours ou plusieurs semaines à être réalisée. Cette fois, les scientifiques du WWA ne se sont penchés que sur la comparaison entre ce qu’il s’est déroulé en Espagne depuis mardi et des «observations météorologiques historiques». Il ont examiné les données du passé sur les précipitations d’une journée dans le sud de l’Espagne pour comprendre comment ce type d’événement a évolué depuis le climat préindustriel (1850-1900), quand la planète était 1,3°C moins chaude que maintenant. Leur conclusion est que «les observations météorologiques historiques indiquent que les précipitations en rafale d’une journée dans cette région augmentent à mesure que les émissions de combustibles fossiles réchauffent le climat». Les scientifiques estiment donc que «le changement climatique est l’explication la plus probable» à la violence des intempéries en Espagne «car une atmosphère plus chaude peut contenir plus d’humidité, ce qui entraîne des averses plus importantes». 18h17 La Croix rouge lance un appel aux dons La Croix-Rouge de Flandre a ouvert un numéro de compte spécial pour soutenir les victimes des inondations. La Croix-Rouge espagnole travaille jour et nuit pour venir en aide aux populations sinistrées. Depuis le début de la tempête, la Croix-Rouge espagnole a déjà ouvert sept abris et déployé 42 équipes d'intervention d'urgence. 158 volontaires et employés sont actuellement actifs sur le terrain et plus de 225 kits d'hygiène, 1.325 couvertures et 3.126 repas ont déjà été distribués. Cependant, l'aide reste nécessaire dans les jours et les semaines à venir. C'est pourquoi la Croix-Rouge de Flandre a activé un nouveau numéro de compte pour l'aide d'urgence à l'Espagne. Les personnes peuvent faire un don au numéro de compte BE53 0000 0000 5353 avec la mention 'Noodweer Spanje'. 17H19 Des images impressionnantes dans une maison de retraite La scène paraît surréaliste. Des vidéos sur les réseaux sociaux montrent des images dramatiques. Les résidents de la maison de retraite ont été surpris par une vague lors des inondations. En un rien de temps, l’eau boueuse et brune atteint leur taille. -> Retrouvez l’article complet ici. Si la plupart des résidents on put être sauvés, 6 personnes ont trouvé la mort. 17H11 La recherche de survivants se poursuit Le bilan des inondations apocalyptiques de cette semaine dans le sud-est de l’Espagne a atteint jeudi 158 morts, alors que les recherches se poursuivaient pour retrouver les personnes disparues, dont le nombre n’est toujours pas connu. À Paiporta, une ville martyre de 25.000 habitants de la banlieue sud de Valence, au moins 62 personnes ont péri, selon la maire, Maribel Albalat. 16H09 158 morts selon un nouveau bilan des services de secours Le bilan, toujours provisoire, des inondations qui ont ravagé cette semaine le sud-est de l’Espagne s’établit désormais à 158 morts, selon un communiqué officiel des services de secours publié sur le réseau X. Sur ce total, 155 victimes ont été enregistrées dans la seule région de Valence, la plus durement frappée, deux autres décès ayant eu lieu dans la région voisine de Castille-La Manche et un en Andalousie. Le communiqué ne précise pas le nombre de personnes qui sont encore portées disparues. 15H38 Le bilan, toujours provisoire, des inondations en Espagne atteint 140 morts Le bilan provisoire des inondations dramatiques qui ont dévasté, dans la nuit de mardi à mercredi, le sud-est de l’Espagne est passé à 140 morts jeudi après-midi, selon l’agence espagnole EFE. Il était jusqu’alors de 95 décès. 15H33 Le SPF Affaires étrangères communique pour les voyageurs Le SPF Affaires étrangères a adapté jeudi ses conseils aux voyageurs à destination de l’Espagne après les inondations qui ont lourdement touché le sud-est du pays. Les personnes qui voudraient se rendre dans la région de Valence sont invitées à reporter leur voyage ou à faire preuve de prudence et à éviter les déplacements inutiles. « Les régions de Valence et d’Albacete se remettent actuellement de la récente tempête Dana, qui a provoqué de fortes précipitations, des inondations et même des tornades », indique le SPF dans un avertissement publié sur le site diplomatie.belgium.be. « Si le centre de gravité de la tempête est passé, plusieurs zones de la région de Valence connaissent encore de graves inondations. Les routes, les lignes ferroviaires et les aéroports, y compris celui de Valence, subissent encore des perturbations en raison des importants dégâts causés ». Le ministère belge conseille aux voyageurs de rester prudents, car des phénomènes météorologiques locaux inattendus pourraient encore se produire. 14H56 Le match de football entre Valence et le Real Madrid, prévu samedi, est reporté La rencontre entre Valence et le Real Madrid, prévue samedi et comptant pour la 12e journée de Liga, a été reportée en raison des inondations qui ont frappé durement la région de Valence, a annoncé la fédération espagnole jeudi. Le match entre Villarreal, au nord de Valence, et le Rayo Vallecano, prévu samedi est aussi reporté, ainsi que toutes les rencontres de football, amateures ou professionnelles, dans la région où 92 personnes, au moins, sont décédées parmi les 95 morts que compte provisoirement le pays après les pires inondations depuis plus de cinquante ans. « Au-delà des reports, le football espagnol a voulu montrer sa solidarité avec les personnes touchées, notamment avec les proches des personnes décédées dans cette catastrophe naturelle », explique la fédération (RFEF) dans un communiqué publié jeudi. 13h39 > Des arrestations après des vols La police espagnole a annoncé sur le réseau social X avoir arrêté 39 personnes après des vols dans des centres commerciaux. « Une multitude d’effets volés ont été récupérés », a-t-elle ajouté. 13h22 > Alerte sur les déplacements en voiture Une alerte a été émise par la protection civile dans la province de Valence. Les riverains sont appelés à éviter les déplacements en voiture, « afin de permettre le travail des professionnels d’urgence ». 12h27 > Sánchez appelle les habitants à « rester chez eux » Le Premier ministre espagnol Pedro Sánchez a appelé jeudi les habitants de la région de Valence à « rester chez eux », le risque étant encore présent. L’épisode de mauvais temps à l’origine de ces inondations « continue », a déclaré à la presse M. Sánchez au terme d’une visite à Valence, capitale de la région éponyme qui a enregistré le plus grand nombre de victimes (92 sur un total de 95). « S’il vous plaît, restez chez vous (…) écoutez les appels des secours d’urgence », a-t-il insisté. 11h50 > L’épisode n’est « pas encore terminé » L’épisode météorologique « n’est pas encore terminé », a affirmé jeudi le roi Felipe VI. Dans une allocution lors d’une cérémonie à Madrid, le souverain espagnol a souligné que « dans certains cas, il y a toujours des prévisions de risque », dans une référence apparente à l’annonce par l’Agence nationale de météorologie (Aemet) d’une « alerte rouge » (risque le plus élevé) pour la province de Castellón, située au nord de Valence. 11h15 > Les trains grande vitesse supprimés entre Madrid et Valence La circulation sur la ligne de train à grande vitesse reliant Madrid à Valence va être interrompue au moins pendant « deux ou trois semaines », au vu des nombreux dégâts, a déclaré le ministre des Transports Óscar Puente. « De nouvelles voies doivent être installées. Nous travaillons déjà, mais même l’accès est compliqué. » 10h43 > 13.200 Belges impactés Le SPF avait indiqué mercredi qu’environ 13.200 Belges demeuraient dans la région frappée par les inondations. Les ressortissants qui s’y trouvent sont invités à s’enregistrer via Travellers Online, la plateforme des Affaires étrangères qui leur permet de joindre les Belges à l’étranger en temps de crise. « Nous recevons continuellement des appels de Belges qui ne parviennent pas à joindre les membres de leur famille. Le réseau téléphonique dans les communes de Turis et Montserrat n’est toujours pas opérationnel », explique le consul honoraire Lodewijk Cuypers du Consulat belge à Valence. 10h36 > Nouveau code rouge au nord de Valence Le service météorologique espagnol a de nouveau placé la région au nord de Valence en code rouge. « Des pluies très intenses dans le nord de la province de Castellón » sont attendues, précisant que la région est en « danger extrême ». 10h10 > Un couple belge avec deux enfants a dû passer la nuit sous un pont De nombreux Belges sont aussi présents dans les régions touchées par les inondations en Espagne. Ce jeudi, HLN révèle qu’un couple avec deux enfants a été contraint de passer la nuit sous un pont. Un couple belge avec deux enfants a passé la nuit sous un pont parce que leur voiture était inondée. Jeudi matin, la police les a secourus et les a emmenés à un hôtel. Ils tentent maintenant de quitter Valence par leurs propres moyens », a appris le consul honoraire Lodewijk Cuypers au média flamand. 09h31 > « Pas de tourisme de catastrophe » Le consulat honoraire de Belgique à Valence déconseille fortement de venir à Valence, à cause des inondations, rapporte Het Laatste Nieuws. « Il n’y a rien ou presque dans le centre, tout est fermé. Nous ne sommes pas d’humeur à passer des vacances. Ne faites pas de tourisme de catastrophe », a déclaré le consul Lodewijk Cuypers. 09h15 > 250M pour les victimes Carlos Mazón Guixot, président de la communauté autonome de Valence, a annoncé ce jeudi matin débloquer 250 millions d’euros pour aider les victimes des inondations. « L’aide viendra rapidement, sans paperasse, pour que les victimes puissent reconstruire leur vie, acheter des meubles et réparer leur maison », a-t-il déclaré. 08h23 > Les recherches ont repris Les opérations de recherche de victimes se poursuivent jeudi dans le sud-est de l’Espagne, sous le choc après les pires inondations depuis plus de cinquante ans dans le pays, qui ont fait au moins 95 morts et de nombreux disparus. Près d’un millier de militaires sont deployés sur le terrain, principalement dans la région de Valence, aux côtés des pompiers, policiers et secouristes qui cherchent à localiser d’éventuels survivants et s’efforcent de déblayer les zones sinistrées. 07h55 > « Il n’y a plus rien à sauver » Dans les zones touchées par les intempéries, les habitants ont fait part de leur sidération. « Il n’y a plus rien à sauver (…) J’ai tout perdu en une nuit », a confié à l’AFP Emilio Muñoz, septuagénaire vivant à Utiel, une localité située à l’ouest de Valence dévastée par les trombes d’eau et par la boue. La pluie a cessé de tomber mercredi dans la région, mais les précipitations de la veille et de la nuit, par endroits sans précédent, ont plongé dans le chaos de nombreuses localités, qui étaient coupées du monde alors que des dizaines de milliers d’habitants étaient encore privés d’électricité. Bien que de très fortes pluies étaient attendues mardi, amenant l’Agence nationale de météorologie (Aemet) à décréter une alerte rouge, elles ont été si brutales et si violentes que de nombreux habitants n’ont pas pu se mettre à l’abri. 07h27 > « 200 opérations de sauvetage terrestres » Le président de la région de Valence, Carlos Manzón, a indiqué mercredi soir que les services d’urgence avaient effectué dans la journée « 200 opérations de sauvetage terrestres et 70 aériennes » avec des hélicoptères, et qu’il ne restait en principe plus de rescapés à récupérer sur les toits ou les toitures. « Il ne reste plus de centres urbains qui n’ont pas été inspectés » et mesure que la couverture téléphonique se rétablit « des personnes signalées comme disparues réapparaissent », a-t-il ajouté lors d’une conférence de presse. 07h18 > 491 litres d’eau par m2 À Chiva, un petit village dans l’arrière-pays de Valence, il est ainsi tombé 491 litres d’eau par m2 en seulement huit heures, soit l’équivalent d’une année de précipitations, selon l’agence météorologique espagnole (Aemet), qui parle d’« accumulations extraordinaires ». Dans la presse, certains demandaient si le gouvernement régional n’avait pas trop attendu avant de demander à la population de se mettre à l’abri. 07h10 > Un deuil national de trois jours Le gouvernement a décrété un deuil national de trois jours à partir de jeudi, jour où le Premier ministre Pedro Sánchez a prévu de se rendre sur les lieux. Dans une brève allocution télévisée dans la matinée, M. Sánchez a apporté son soutien aux familles des victimes et aux sinistrés, mais a appelé à la vigilance, car, a-t-il dit, « nous ne pouvons pas considérer que cet épisode dévastateur est terminé ». 06h58 > L’UE « prête à aider l’Espagne » À Bruxelles, la présidente de la Commission européenne, Ursula von der Leyen, a assuré que l’UE était « prête à aider l’Espagne ». Pour sa part, le roi Felipe VI souverain s’est dit « dévasté » par cette tragédie dans un message sur X. « La situation est dantesque (…) Je n’avais jamais vu cela », a déclaré à la TVE Consuelo Tarazona, la maire d’Horno de Alcedo, commune de la banlieue de Valence. La montée des eaux a été « monstrueuse (…º Nous avons été inondés tout d’un coup, sans pouvoir prévenir les voisins », a-t-elle ajouté. Un millier de militaires, soutenus par des hélicoptères, ont été déployés sur la zone aux côtés de 1.500 membres des forces de l’ordre afin de prêter main-forte aux services de secours. 06h47 > « Un nouveau rappel terrible du changement climatique » La région de Valence et la côte méditerranéenne espagnole en général subissent régulièrement, en automne, le phénomène dit de la « gota fria » (la « goutte froide »), une dépression isolée en haute altitude qui provoque des pluies soudaines et extrêmement violentes, parfois pendant plusieurs jours. Les scientifiques avertissent depuis plusieurs années que les phénomènes météorologiques extrêmes, tels que les vagues de chaleur et les tempêtes, sont à la fois de plus en plus fréquents, de plus en plus longs et de plus en plus intenses en raison du changement climatique. « Ces inondations soudaines en Espagne sont un nouveau rappel terrible du changement climatique et de son caractère chaotique », souligne dans une note Jess Neumann, professeur d’hydrologie à l’université de Reading au Royaume-Uni. Ces catastrophes peuvent désormais toucher « n’importe qui, n’importe où : » nous devons sérieusement réfléchir à la façon de mieux concevoir nos paysages, nos villes et nos cités «, a-t-il prévenu.
