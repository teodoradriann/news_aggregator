    "title": "TTC Group inks MoU with Sojitz Vietnam",
    "text": "TTC Group and Sojitz Vietnam will collaborate in renewable energy, new energy (biogas, bio - LNG, and sustainable aviation fuel), and energy solutions. They will also look at agriculture, real estate, and education.This year is a pivotal moment for TTC Group, as it looks to achieve its goals set for 2030. Based on its strengthened foundations, TTC is committed to enhancing service quality and management capabilities, as well as business control and operations, to assert its brand on the international stage.Speaking at the event, Dang Van Thanh, chairman of TTC Group, expressed his sincere gratitude to Sojitz Corporation and Sojitz Vietnam for choosing TTC as a partner for their upcoming development strategies.

    "text": "Friends, family and government officials have confirmed that at least seven Canadians were killed when Hamas militants conducted a series of attacks in Israel on Oct. 7.\nGlobal Affairs Canada has said an eighthperson who was not a citizen but had deep ties to Canada also died in the ensuing conflict. Another Canadian, who has not been identified, died in Lebanon during the hostilities.\nThe Hamas attacks killed an estimated 1,200 people and militants took another 240 hostage, 105 of whom were released during a temporary pause in the violence at the end of last month.\nAs Israel continues its retaliation on Hamas in the Gaza Strip, authorities there say more than 20,000 Palestinians have now been killed.\nHere's what we know about the Hamas victimswith ties to Canada:\nJudih Weinstein Haggai\nJudih Weinstein Haggai, 70, was out on an early-morning walk when Hamas started its attack, her family says.\nShe told members of her Nir Oz kibbutz that a militant on a motorcycle shot her husband and she was less severely wounded. The community was unable to dispatch an ambulance before militants arrived there.\nLast week, the kibbutz confirmed Gadi Haggai, Judih's husband, died on Oct. 7, and on Thursday they confirmed Weinstein Haggai also died that day, and her body is being held in Gaza.\nWeinstein Haggai was born in New York state but arrived in Toronto at the age of three, and moved to Israel 20 years later to live with her husband. She held Canadian, Israeli and American citizenships.\nWeinstein Haggai was an artist and a volunteer who the kibbutz said \"pursued many initiatives to advance peace in the region.\"\nHer brother Larry Weinstein said the family is distressed by Israel's offensive in Gaza and the rise of hateful speech in Canada toward both Jews and Muslims.\n\"We're inspired by my sister, who believed in peace and believed in harmony,\" he said. \"There can't be any kind of resolution when people are at each other's throats.\"\nVivian Silver\nVivian Silver, 74, was in her home on Kibbutz Be'eri near the Gaza border and talking on the phone with her son Yonatan Zeigen when they learned of the incursion by Hamas into Israel.\n\"We couldn’t grasp the incapability of the Israeli army to defend the civilians … we started to say goodbye because we realized this is probably our last words to each other,\" Zeigen later told a news conference organized by the Jerusalem Press Club.\nHe said they shifted their conversations to text messages so his mother could stay silent, and someone broke into her home. They said they loved one another before the messages stopped coming.\nZeigen said he had received information that she was taken hostage, and her phone had been geolocated in Gaza.\nOn Monday, his brother Chen Zeigen confirmed their mother's death. He said Israeli authorities told him the remains found earlier in the kibbutz had been identified as Silver.\nHe said his mother was born in Winnipeg and moved to Israel in 1974.\nShe dedicated her life to peacebuilding and fostering understanding between Israelis and Palestinians, he added.\nShe also volunteered to help children in Gaza access medical care in Israel.\nTiferet Lapidot\nTiferet Lapidot, 22, was a few days shy of her 23rd birthday and attending a music festival when the Hamas attack began.\nHer cousin Oran Zlotnik remembered Lapidot as a charismatic and compassionate person who had travelled the world, taught in Africa and spent time in Australia before she returned to Israel in the fall.\nHer uncle Harel Lapidot said she called her mother the morning of the attack to say she was hiding in a bush and to ask whether she should flee. Her cellphone was later tracked to the Gaza Strip, leading family to believe she was being held hostage. They then mounted a campaign to secure her freedom.\nZlotnik said that when the cellphone of one of Lapidot's friends, confirmed deceased, was also traced to Gaza, the family realized it was possible she wasn't a hostage.\nHarel Lapidot said his niece's body was later identified and the family held a funeral.\n\"We know for a fact they were hunted,\" he said. \"They ran away and they were hunted and killed.\"\nTiferet Lapidot was an Israeli citizen but her family was from Canada, including her father, Ohad, who was born in Saskatchewan.\nHarel Lapidot thanked the Jewish community in Canada and MPs who had reached out to help and offer support. The family had a meeting with Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly while she was in Israel.\nNetta Epstein\nIsraeli-Canadian Netta Epstein, 21, died when his home, Kibbutz Kfar Aza, came under attack.\nHis mother, Ayelet Shachar-Epstein, said he loved life. She learned the circumstances of his death from text messages he sent her in the moments before he was killed, and from his fiancée, Irene Shavit, who survived.\nNetta Epstein was inside a safe room with Shavit, and he jumped on a grenade thrown in by the attackers.\nShachar-Epstein, who also lost her mother-in-law and two brothers-in-law in the attacks, described it as a terrorist invasion.\nShe said her son, who had worked with special needs youth, had returned home two months earlier after completing military service.\nHe was born in Montreal and was a Canadian citizen. Shachar-Epstein said many members of the family still live in that city.\nShir Georgy\nIsraeli Canadian Shir Georgy, 22, was killed by Hamas militants who ambushed the music festival near Kibbutz Re'im.\nGeorgy's aunt Michal Bouganim confirmed the death.\n\"We are currently a mess, heartbroken,\" Bouganim said in a Facebook message.\nBouganim shared a 22-second clip on her social media in which a terrified Georgy was seen sitting on a floor, with her back against a wall and surrounded by other festival attendees — some of them injured.\nGeorgy's funeral was held in Israel.\nAdi Vital-Kaploun\nAdi Vital-Kaploun, 33, was killed by Hamas militants in her kibbutz near the Israeli border with the Gaza Strip, said the Jewish Federation of Ottawa.\nThe group's CEO made a statement on behalf of Vital-Kaploun's family, saying the dual citizen has a large extended family in the Ottawa area.\nThe family said she died a hero, after convincing her killers to spare her two young children and warning her father and husband to stay hidden during the attack.\n\"Adi was a beautiful woman that brought love and lightness to the people around her, but also she was very focused and determined to make a beautiful life for her family,\" her cousin-in-law Aaron Smith said in an interview.\nThe family said she was an amazing mother and wife, always bringing love and laughter to their household.\nShe was also a talented dancer, saxophonist and basketball player.\nAfter completing her master's degree in engineering, Vital-Kaploun excelled in her cybersecurity career, they said.\n\"We are mourning trying to process this unconscionable act of terrorism in her kibbutz and across the country,\" said the family, adding that they wish her memory to be \"a blessing.\"\nBen Mizrachi\nCanadian Ben Mizrachi was one of at least 260 people gunned down by Hamas militants at the music festival in southern Israel.\nMizrachi, 22, from Vancouver, was described as \"larger than life with a big personality\" in a statement by his former high school in B.C.\nEzra Shanken, CEO of the Jewish Federation of Greater Vancouver, said Mizrachi was about to start university in Israel after serving with the country's national defence force.\nHilit Nurick, a home economics teacher at King David High School in Vancouver, remembered Mizrachi as a \"kind, wonderful, and community-minded\" young man who had a positive influence on everyone around him.\nNurick said she and Mizrachi once put a large event together for more than 100 people at school.\n\"He was in charge of making Moroccan-style spicy fish stew. He brought his mother's recipe and shared it with everyone and taught us how to make it,\" said Nurick. \"He was incredible, just an incredible human being.\"\nAlexandre Look\nAlexandre Look, who had recently celebrated his 33rd birthday, was among those killed while attending the musical festival.\nLook, who lived in Montreal with his family before moving to Mexico, died a hero, his dad said in a Facebook post.\n\"Like a true warrior he left as a hero wanting to protect the people he was with,\" Alain Haim Look said.\nFriend Lior Horovitz described him as a \"once-in-a-lifetime person\" who became like family during their five-year friendship.\nIn a phone interview from a town outside Tel Aviv, she said she and her boyfriend met Alexandre Look in Mexico. They became fast friends and would organize their vacations to meet up, either in Mexico or Israel.\nHe was a proud Jewish Canadian and a generous person who would do anything for his friends, she said.\n\"He's a person who loves people,\" she said. \"He's the guy that's always going to help others, especially if they are Jewish.\"\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 28, 2023.\nThe Canadian Press",

    "text": "Crece nivel del mar por efecto de La Niña y el cambio climático, según la NASA El análisis de la agencia estatal espacial estadounidense se basa en más de 30 años de observaciones satelitales El nivel medio global del mar aumentó alrededor de 0,76 centímetros entre 2022 y 2023, casi cuatro veces más que entre 2021 y 2022, afirmó la NASA el jueves, atribuyendo el \"salto significativo\" al fenómeno de El Niño y a un clima más cálido. El análisis de la agencia estatal espacial estadounidense se basa en más de 30 años de observaciones satelitales, iniciadas con el primer lanzamiento de un satélite, en 1992. \"Las tasas actuales de aceleración significan que estamos en camino de añadir otros 20 centímetros al nivel medio global del mar hacia 2050\", dijo Nadya Vinogradova Shiffer, directora del equipo de cambio del nivel del mar de la NASA y del programa de física oceánica en Washington. Ello supondría el doble de cambios en las próximas tres décadas en comparación con el siglo anterior, afirmó, lo que hará que las inundaciones sean mucho más frecuentes y catastróficas que en la actualidad. La causa inmediata del aumento es el fenómeno climático de El Niño, que reemplazó a La Niña entre 2021 y 2022, cuando el nivel del mar subió alrededor de 0,20 centímetros. El Niño genera temperaturas oceánicas más cálidas que el promedio en el Pacífico ecuatorial. \"En los años de El Niño, gran parte de la lluvia que normalmente cae sobre la tierra termina en el océano, lo que eleva temporalmente el nivel del mar\", explicó Josh Willis, investigador en el Laboratorio de Propulsión a Chorro (JPL) de la NASA. Pero también hay una clara huella humana en la tendencia subyacente de aceleración. \"Los conjuntos de datos a largo plazo, como este registro satelital de 30 años, nos permiten diferenciar entre los efectos a corto plazo sobre el nivel del mar, como El Niño, y las tendencias que nos indican hacia dónde se dirige el nivel del mar\", dijo Ben Hamlington, líder del programa marino de la NASA. Las innovaciones tecnológicas han aportado una mayor precisión en las mediciones. Por ejemplo, los altímetros de radar hacen rebotar microondas en la superficie del mar y luego registran el tiempo que tarda la señal en regresar al satélite, así como la intensidad de la señal de retorno. También verifican sus datos con otras fuentes, como mareógrafos y mediciones satelitales del vapor de agua atmosférico y el campo gravitatorio de la Tierra.

Sin embargo, [ otros países también lograron hitos](https://www.nationalgeographic.com.es/llegada-del-hombre-a-la-luna/carrera-espacial-paso-a-paso_14369) importantes en este aspecto, principalmente en la época de la Guerra Fría. Por ejemplo, Alexei Leonov (Unión Soviética) fue el primer ser humano en realizar una caminata espacial en 1965, mientras que Valentina Tereshkova (Unión Soviética) se convirtió en la primera mujer en el espacio en 1963. Más recientemente, Jing Haipeng (China) fue primer astronauta chino en realizar una caminata espacial en 2008. Un hito histórico para Japón y la exploración espacial Ahora, el presidente de los Estados Unidos, Joe Biden, y el primer ministro de Japón, Fumio Kishida, anunciaron un acuerdo histórico que convertirá a un astronauta japonés en el primer humano no estadounidense en pisar la Luna. Este hito se alcanzará en una futura misión Artemis, programa espacial de la NASA que tiene como objetivo el regreso del ser humano a la Luna. El primer ministro Kishida mencionó que este acuerdo es un sueño hecho realidad para Japón, que ha estado trabajando durante años para convertirse en una potencia espacial líder. La participación de un astronauta japonés en la misión Artemis marca un paso crucial en este camino. Unos celebran, otros no tanto Si bien el acuerdo entre Estados Unidos y Japón es un hito emocionante, genera sentimientos encontrados en Europa. A pesar de que la Agencia Espacial Europea (ESA) ha contribuido significativamente al programa Artemis, suministrando los módulos de servicio de la nave espacial Orion, las plazas europeas en las misiones Artemis IV y V no contemplan un alunizaje. De todos modos, lo más importante del acuerdo entre Estados Unidos y Japón es que abre las puertas a una mayor cooperación internacional en la exploración espacial. En ese sentido, esta colaboración será fundamental para alcanzar objetivos ambiciosos como la construcción de una base lunar permanente y la exploración de Marte. Al final del día, la participación de diversos países en proyectos como Artemis es crucial para lograr avances significativos. Solo la colaboración internacional permitirá alcanzar nuevos horizontes y descubrir los misterios del universo.",

    "text": "Ukrainian President thanks Pope for support for peace efforts in Ukraine By Vatican News Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky recently expressed his gratitude to Pope Francis for his Christmas greetings to Ukraine and for supporting the Peace Formula. This appreciation was conveyed during their latest phone conversation, details of which President Zelensky posted Thursday on the official presidential website and on his X account. “I have just spoken with His Holiness Pope Francis to express gratitude for his Christmas greetings to Ukraine and Ukrainians, for his wishes of peace – just peace for all of us,” said President Zelensky. “We discussed our joint work on the Peace Formula – more than 80 states are already involved at the level of their representatives. There will be more. I am grateful to the Vatican for supporting our work.” Series of telephone conversations Pope Francis received the Ukrainian President in the Vatican on 13 May for their second in-person meeting. The first was in 2020, before Russia’s all-out invasion of its neighbor on 24 February 2022. Since then, the two men have spoken by phone several times, the first of which was on 26 February 2022, just two days after the outbreak of the war. Following that first phone conversation, President Zelensky said the Pope had expressed his deep sorrow for the tragic events that were unfolding in the European nation, while the President had thanked the Pope for his spiritual support for the people of Ukraine. They spoke again by phone on 22 March 2022. President Zelensky said he had told the Pope about the dire humanitarian situation and welcomed the Holy See’s offer to mediate in order to seek a solution to human suffering. Later, on 12 August 2022, the pair held another telephone conversation to discuss the horrors endured by the Ukrainian people due to Russia’s invasion, according to President Zelensky. He also expressed his appreciation to Pope Francis for his prayers and invited him to visit Kyiv.",

    "text": "Some Christians celebrate Christmas in January. Due to a difference in calendars used for religious observances. This distinction primarily affects Orthodox Christians. These are in countries like Russia, Ukraine, Serbia, and Ethiopia. The Calendar Talk The Roman calendar was introduced by Julius Caesar in 45 BC. This was used. This Julian calendar had a slight miscalculation in the solar year’s length. It overestimated it by 11 minutes. Over centuries, these minutes added up, causing significant drift from the astronomical seasons. By the 16th century, this change was so evident. To correct it, Pope Gregory XIII introduced the Gregorian calendar in 1582. This new calendar was more accurate in aligning with the Earth’s orbit around the Sun. But, not all countries adopted it immediately. Many Orthodox Christian nations continued using the Julian calendar for religious observances. Including the date of Christmas. In the Julian calendar, December 25th falls on January 7th in the Gregorian calendar. Hence, many Orthodox Christians celebrate Christmas on January 7th. This difference is solely due to the calendar discrepancy. Customs and Traditions Orthodox Christians often observe Christmas with unique customs and traditions. These can include special church services, fasting before Christmas, and cultural festivities. The question of whether Christians can unite in celebrating Christmas on the same day is complex. It involves theological, historical, and cultural considerations. Calendar alignment is just one aspect. For unity to occur, there would need to be a broad consensus. Across various Christian denominations. Ways to Join Several attempts have been made to join the calendars. Many created a Vave login to vote on this. Some Orthodox churches, such as the Greek Orthodox Church, have changed. But, even these churches continue to celebrate Christmas on January 7th, maintaining tradition. Unifying the celebration of Christmas would need more than just agreeing on a date. It would entail bridging centuries-old theological and liturgical differences. It’s a matter that goes beyond calendars to the heart of diverse Christian identities. Ecumenism encourages cooperation and better understanding among different Christian denominations. Such efforts promote respect. And even appreciation for various traditions and practices. That is ncluding the date of Christmas. In recent years, there’s been a growing awareness and acceptance of these differences. Within the global Christian community. Many Christians now recognize and respect the January celebration of Christmas as a valid and venerable tradition. The celebration of Christmas in January illustrates the diversity within Christianity. It’s a reminder of the rich tapestry of traditions that make up the Christian faith. While complete unification in celebration dates might not be workable. Or even necessary. The shared core of the Christmas message. peace, love, and goodwil. remains central to all Christians, regardless of when they celebrate. Some Christians celebrate Christmas in January due to historical calendar differences. This practice is particularly prevalent among Orthodox Christians following the Julian calendar. The focus on shared beliefs and values. Rather than the exact date of celebrations. might be a more meaningful approach to unity within the faith.",

    "text": "Olympic Men’s Sevens quarter-final: Fiji 19 Ireland 15 [Ireland](https://www.irishtimes.com/tags/ireland-rugby/) fell out of the medals in the Stade de France on Thursday night when twice [Olympic](https://www.irishtimes.com/tags/olympic-games/) champions Fiji sprung a second-half blitz of tries to win their [Olympic Games ](https://www.irishtimes.com/tags/olympic-games/)quarter-final match. It was a brave end but short of Irish pre-tournament ambitions to win a first rugby medal at an Olympic Games. The pity is they were good enough to do it. From the whistle against Fiji it was a tough challenge with Ireland getting off to a shocking start to the match after kicking off. Within a few phases and a matter of seconds the athletic Iosefo Baleiwairiki was punching a hole through the centre of the field and galloping away to score under Ireland’s posts. It was a deflating start and barely a minute had passed with the conversion putting Ireland 7-0 in arrears in the blink of an eye. [Olympics: Complete day-by-day guide to the Irish athletes in action in Paris](/sport/2024/07/26/olympics-complete-day-by-day-guide-to-the-irish-athletes-in-action-in-paris/) [Olympics: essentials and coverage](/opinion/letters/2024/08/09/olympics-essentials-and-coverage/) [Olympics day 13 as it happened: McLaughlin-Levrone breaks 400m hurdles world record; Tebogo beats Lyles in 200m](/sport/2024/08/08/olympics-day-13-live-updates-ireland-kate-oconnor-heptathlon-athletics-leona-maguire-paris/) [Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone touches the seemingly impossible by smashing 400m hurdles world record](/sport/athletics/2024/08/08/sydney-mclaughlin-levrone-touches-the-seemingly-impossible-by-smashing-400m-hurdles-world-record/) The upswing was that Ireland didn’t lose composure and three minutes into the game Chay Mullins replied, muscling over the line with a Fijian defender on his shoulder. After a second look for a possible knock-on the referee awarded the try, an unsuccessful conversion leaving Fiji 7-5 ahead. [ [Fiji 19 Ireland 15: As it happenedOpens in new window](https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/2024/07/25/olympic-rugby-sevens-ireland-fiji-new-zealand/) ] But Ireland continued in that vein, holding on to the ball and not allowing Fiji play their natural game. Ireland also kept pushing and again Mullins went over for his second score of the match. Good work from Gavin Mullin on the left side of the pitch made the space but again Mullins execution was good as Ireland closed the half 10-7 ahead. What a turnaround that was for confidence and momentum. Certainly, Ireland had the go-forward game at that stage with the Irish players continuing to press after the break. Again, they found themselves pressing the Fijians back and on to their line in the left corner. When it looked as though the defence had covered the Irish numbers, the outstanding Zac Ward went around the outside to dive in at the corner flag for his third try of the competition. Again, the referee looked for a knock-on and again the Irish try was awarded with Ireland taking a 15-7 lead. Comfortable at that point Fiji did as they often do and struck back twice from nothing really. The first came in the 11th minute with Joji Nasova bumping off a number of Irish tackles before finishing an attacking phase from deep in the Fijian half. Within a minute they were up again scoring, this time the ball from a restart running loose but with hints of a Fiji knock-on as the athletic Waisea Nacqu latched on to it first and drove over the Irish line. It was converted for 19-15 and suddenly Ireland were chasing the match. It was to end that way, much good endeavour from Ireland but ultimately magic from Fiji in another game that was there for winning. It was the body language of the Irish players after narrowly losing to New Zealand in their last Pool A match earlier on Thursday said as much as they needed to say about the Olympic journey. It wasn’t over but had just become steeper. Ireland had stolen a step on New Zealand with tries from Ward and Jordan Conroy for a 12-0 half-time lead before New Zealand hit back in the second half scoring a late try and converting it just as the final hooter sounded. Although Hugo Keenan was bravely upbeat about his side’s potential to beat any team, Ireland’s involvement in the medal matches, the ones they had set their hearts on winning, perished a little with New Zealand’s last-gasp try and conversion for a snatched 14-12 win. There was no little shock in the way the game upended a momentum that appeared to be working in Ireland’s favour before shockingly falling the way of the Sevens All Blacks. Ireland deserved more. They deserved more on the pitch and a better draw for coming second in the pool, although the likely scenario if they lost, was known before they played. A few lapses that allowed New Zealand surge back from two tries down to win the match by two points and consign Ireland to a quarter-final against twice Olympic Champions Fiji and not South Africa, who they had already beaten in the pool meeting, certainly coloured the canvas differently. Fiji came into the quarter-final with a gold standard unmatched by any other Sevens team. Unbeaten over eight years, three Olympic Games and 15 straight matches, their athletic, open style of playing the game as effective as it was thrilling to watch. Fiji won the 2016 Rio gold medal by winning six matches in succession, repeated that against in Tokyo with a second gold medal and have won their three Pool C games and a quarter-final.
