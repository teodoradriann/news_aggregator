    "text": "Raleigh voters will see a familiar name on their ballots this fall. [Terrance (Truth) Ruth](https://indyweek.com/news/wake/terrence-ruth-interview/), 41, a professor in NC State University’s School of Social Work and community activist, will run for mayor once again after narrowly losing to Mayor Mary-Ann Baldwin in the race for the office in 2022. “We will be prepared to face the challenges of tomorrow by inspiring Raleigh to make different choices today,” Ruth said in a press release announcing his candidacy dated March 14. “Our biggest challenges require long-term solutions. Long-term solutions are generated only when a city, not a small segment of a city, is invested in the process and the outcomes.” Ruth’s candidacy will focus on three principles: security, representation, and change, the press release continued. “Emphasizing the need for authentic leadership and innovative solutions, Dr. Ruth is committed to challenging the status quo and championing policies, prioritizing all Raleigh residents’ well-being,” the release stated. Ruth holds a Ph.D. in Public Affairs from the University of Central Florida and has worked as a teacher and principal in Wake County and as a nonprofit leader. Ruth is “deeply involved in local, state, and national social justice initiatives” and “leads coalitions to address local challenges through impact investing and creative collaborations, including projects to enhance affordable housing and innovate philanthropy,” according to the release. Ruth, who has not held elected office before, joins an already-crowded race for mayor. Raleigh city council member Corey Branch announced his candidacy this winter, as did former Raleigh council member, state senator, and NC treasurer [Janet Cowell](https://indyweek.com/news/wake/opportunities-and-wealth-for-some-and-displacement-and-burden-for-others-a-qa-with-raleigh-mayoral-candidate-janet-cowell/). Activist Delmonte Crawford, Republican mortgage broker Paul Fitts, and Peace University student James Shaughnessy IV have also announced their bids for the office. Mayor Mary-Ann Baldwin has not formally announced whether she will run for reelection but has said that she expects to. In 2022, Ruth received 41 percent of the vote to Baldwin’s 47 percent. Community advocate DaQuanta Copeland placed third with 10 percent of the vote. The candidate filing period opens July 5 and Election Day is November 5. All eight city council seats will be on the ballot. Follow Editor-in-Chief Jane Porter on [jporter@indyweek.com](mailto:jporter@indyweek.com).",

    "text": "El estado de Alabama, en EE. UU., se dispone a aplicar en horas de la tarde de este jueves, 25 de enero, la pena capital a Kenneth Smith, quien lleva 35 años en la llamada fila de la muerte. La ejecución, ya de por sí polémica, ha causado muchas críticas pues utilizará un método que nunca se ha probado: asfixia con nitrógeno. El propio Smith hizo hoy un pedido de última hora para que se detenga. Kenneth Smith, de 58 años, fue declarado culpable del asesinato de una mujer de 45 años en 1988, ordenado por su esposo, un pastor muy endeudado e infiel, para que pareciera un robo que acabó mal. Pero lo que acabó mal fue el destino de Smith, que está a horas de ser ejecutado con gas nitrógeno, pese a que emprendió una batalla legal para impedir que muriera con este método nunca antes probado. Además, alega que está siendo tratado como un conejillo de indias. Ante su inminente muerte, son muchas las voces críticas de este método que se usa para matar cerdos después de ser anestesiados. La ONU es la principal voz en contra de las ejecuciones en general. “Esto podría constituir tortura u otros tratos o penas crueles, inhumanos o degradantes, según las normas internacionales de derechos humanos\", indicó Ravina Shamdasani, portavoz de derechos humanos de la ONU. La ejecución está en la mira porque sus oponentes denuncian que puede provocar dolor excesivo en el proceso e incluso ser tortuoso. Publicidad “Es impresionante cómo el Estado tolera algo que es objetable como tortura. Así que no sé, si la máscara no se ajusta del todo bien y hay fugas de gas nitrógeno alrededor de la máscara o algo así, podría tardar más”, señaló el anestesiólogo Joel Zivot. La comunidad religiosa no se queda por fuera. Desde Sant’Egidio aseguraron que este tipo de pena de muerte es una prueba de fuego para la civilización actual que está perdiendo la batalla de una cultura de la vida. Mario Marazziti, representante de Sant’Egidio, enfatizó que este tipo de pena de muerte “rebaja a la humanidad al nivel de un estado que tiene un frenesí y una furia asesina contra un individuo, tratando de matarlo dos veces después de una terrible ejecución fallida que duró cuatro horas”. Publicidad En todo caso, la ejecución está programada para este jueves a las 6 p. m. hora local. Y solo un hecho extraordinario podría cambiar el destino de Kenneth Smith.",

    "text": "Esportes\nDorival Júnior quer a seleção atuando bem independente do adversário\nO técnico Dorival Júnior afirmou que espera ver a seleção brasileira atuando bem diante de qualquer adversário. A declaração foi dada em entrevista coletiva concedida nesta quarta-feira (19), um dia antes da partida contra a Colômbia, válida pela 13ª rodada das Eliminatórias Sul-Americanas para a Copa do Mundo de 2026.\n“Quero ver a seleção render em qualquer momento, independentemente do adversário que tenhamos. Teremos dois compromissos muito complicados [contra a Colômbia e a Argentina], mas nossos adversários também reconhecem a condição da seleção brasileira. Estamos melhorando a cada momento, é uma subida gradativa que está acontecendo”, declarou o treinador.\nDiante da equipe colombiana Dorival Júnior espera uma partida complicada e disputada: “A Colômbia tem uma estrutura de jogo muito bem definida, são 30 jogos do treinador, os jogadores já muito bem definidos em suas funções e posições. Com certeza teremos um jogo muito complicado, jogado, porque é uma equipe que joga e propõe e busca variações”.\nNeste compromisso, que será realizado a partir das 21h45 (horário de Brasília) da próxima quinta-feira (20) no estádio Mané Garrincha, em Brasília, o técnico Dorival Júnior pode optar por algumas novidades na equipe titular. Uma delas pode ser a entrada de João Pedro na posição de centroavante.\n“É um jogo importante [contra a Colômbia], dentro da nossa casa, contra uma grande seleção. Acho que temos que focar essa semana, fazer um grande trabalho, para apresentar um bom futebol e poder vencer a partida”, declarou o jogador de 23 anos de idade formado no Fluminense e que atualmente defende o Brighton (Inglaterra).\nUma possível escalação da seleção brasileira para o jogo com a Colômbia é: Alisson; Vanderson, Marquinhos, Gabriel Magalhães e Guilherme Arana; Bruno Guimarães e Gerson; Rodrygo, Raphinha e Vinicius Júnior; João Pedro.\nEsportes\nDorival Júnior quer a seleção atuando bem independente do adversário",

    "text": "Photo: Trifonov_Evgeniy / iStock / Getty Images\nBrevard County, FL - A rare celestial event is unfolding in our night sky. Comet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS) is currently making a once-in-a-lifetime pass by the Sun and is visible to the naked eye for a limited time.\nWhile the comet was initially visible in the morning sky, its path has brought it to the evening sky, making it observable in the west shortly after sunset.\nDespite its recent social media buzz, many are still unsure how to spot this celestial wonder.\nTo spot the comet, look to the western sky just after sunset for the next few nights.\nEnsure you have a clear view of the western horizon and allow your eyes to adjust to the darkness.\nWhile a telescope or expensive equipment is not necessary, strong eyesight is recommended. However, simple sporting binoculars can aid in viewing the comet and its faint tail.\nFor those with smartphones, using the night shot setting on your camera can help capture the comet.\nThis setting takes a longer exposure, gathering more light and revealing details not visible to the naked eye.\nThe comet will be visible in the western sky at the following times:\nTonight (Thursday): 7:07 PM Friday: 7:21 PM Saturday: 7:20 PM Sunday: 7:19 PM Monday: 7:18 PM As the comet continues its journey away from the Sun, it will become dimmer each night. Therefore, now is the ideal time to observe this extraordinary celestial event before it fades from our view.",
