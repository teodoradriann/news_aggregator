    "title": "Russia pushes forward in Ukraine’s east as Kursk offensive slows - The Boston Globe",
    "text": "KYIV — More than two weeks into its surprise offensive in western Russia, Ukraine’s advance has slowed, with its troops making only marginal gains around territory they already control.\nBut more than 200 miles to the southeast, another offensive is gaining momentum: Russia’s drive toward Pokrovsk, a stronghold in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region. In recent days, Russia’s troops have seized at least three settlements and reached the outskirts of a town along a railroad to Pokrovsk, a logistics hub for the Ukrainian army in the region.\nThe Russian advance has put the Ukrainians in the precarious position of defending one critical front while attempting to press forward on another, all with limited troop numbers and weaponry. President Volodymyr Zelensky said this week that Ukraine was working on boosting its forces in the east with more men and weapons to resist the Russian advance.\nAdvertisement\nRussia’s troops are now about 8 miles from the center of Pokrovsk.\n“They’re now within artillery range of the city,” Michael Kofman, a senior fellow in the Russia and Eurasia program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told the military podcast War on the Rocks on Wednesday.\nPokrovsk, a city of more than 40,000 inhabitants, is a transit hub for Ukrainian forces in the east. It is on a key road, Highway T054, linking several cities that form a defensive arc protecting the part of the Donetsk region that is still held by Ukraine.\n“The loss of Pokrovsk would be fairly significant to Ukraine’s ability to maintain defenses overall in Donetsk,” Kofman said. “Its loss wouldn’t be disastrous but it would have downstream effects for the overall organization of defense.”\nA map of the battlefield produced by the Finland-based Black Bird Group, which tracks developments in the conflict, appears to indicate that Russian troops have approached the final line of Ukrainian anti-tank ditches and trenches near the town. They have already breached several defensive layers during their advance, the Black Bird Group said, although these were less densely fortified.\nLocal Ukrainian authorities have called on Pokrovsk’s residents to evacuate within the next two weeks, before conditions worsen significantly. Families with children have already been ordered to leave. But Serhii Dobriak, the head of Pokrovsk’s military administration, reported that the evacuation pace was not fast enough, with only 500 to 600 people departing daily, though the authorities could bring out at least 1,000 a day.\nAdvertisement\n“People don’t want to evacuate,” Volodymyr Nikulin, a police officer in Pokrovsk, said in a text message. “This is not a surprise. People in these cities used to live in war since 2014. They’ve experienced so many war atrocities. They just hope to survive.”\nTo the northeast of Pokrovsk, around the towns of Toretsk and Niu-York, Russian forces have been slowly but steadily gaining ground, sending waves of troops in bloody attacks.\nFootage geolocated by the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, shows Russia’s troops are on the doorstep of Toretsk and now control most of Niu-York, which took its name in the 19th century and is sometimes referred to as New York. A medic from a brigade fighting near Niu-York, speaking on condition of anonymity for security reasons, said this week that Ukrainian soldiers still controlled a small part of the town but were under relentless attacks.\nUkrainian positions in Niu-York and Toretsk protect another city in the defensive arc: Kostiantynivka, about 9 miles to the northwest.\nAnalysts say one aim of Ukraine’s offensive into western Russia has been to force Moscow to divert troops from the eastern front lines. But the Kremlin appears to have largely resisted such a redeployment, prioritizing its military effort in the east.\n“The Russians have hardly moved any forces from here,” Maksym Zhorin, the deputy commander of the Third Separate Assault Brigade, which is fighting in the east, told Ukrainian media Wednesday. The Ukrainian offensive in Russia has had little impact on the fighting in the Donetsk region, he said.\nAdvertisement",

    "text": "O Palmeiras teve mais um resultado importante para a briga pela liderança do Campeonato Brasileiro ao bater o Fluminense, fora de casa, por 2 a 1. Após a partida, Aníbal Moreno conversou com a imprensa e analisou a partida.\n“Sabíamos que o Fluminense se defende muito bem. Nós fizemos um grande jogo, circulamos a bola. O primeiro gol saiu assim, com paciência. No segundo foi mais a postura do time e o Vítor fez um belo gol”, disse.\nAlém disso, Aníbal Moreno também comemorou o gol de Vítor Roque, que foi decisivo no confronto e marcou o segundo gol da vitória.\n“Ele fez uma grande partida, está ajudando muito. Hoje foi por causa dele, fizemos uma pressão muito boa e ele conseguiu o gol”, comentou.\nAlém do jogador, Abel Ferreira também falou sobre a fase de atacante e chamou as críticas sofridas pelo atleta de “selvagens”.\n“Quem teve que ouvir foi ele. Ele já sabe. Para ser jogador nessa país e aguentar as críticas selvagens que fazem a jogadores com 20 anos, independente se ganham muito ou pouco, chamam de bagre. Tem ódio. Isso deixam marcas emocionais nos jogadores. Estamos a falar de um jogador que é capaz, e como nós parece que vivemos em um mundo perfeito, que todo mundo faz tudo perfeito no trabalho”, declarou.\nQuer saber onde assistir aos jogos de futebol hoje na TV?

Б. Ключи) из-за огромной пробки увеличили количество нарядов ДПС для регулирования транспортных потоков и обеспечения беспрепятственного движения транспортных средств. Об этом сообщили в краевой Госавтоинспекции.\nНапомним, утром 12 июня Чуйский тракт сковала гигантская пробка в сторону Бийска. Предположительно, причиной затора стало ДТП.\n\"В связи с длительными выходными днями резко увеличивается поток транспортных средств на участках автодорог, ведущих к местам отдыха, особенно к популярным курортным зонам и природным достопримечательностям. Это приводит к пробкам и заторам, что затрудняет и замедляет движение\", — добавили в ведомстве.\nГосавтоинспекция призывает водителей быть предельно внимательными и осторожными. При поездке на загородных автодорогах следует учитывать дорожную обстановку, интенсивность движения, время суток и особенности погодных условий. В ведомстве напомнили о важности строгого соблюдения скоростного режима, дистанции между машинами и бокового интервала.",

Stefani Reynolds/Pool via REUTERS\nIsrael is praying that an emergency shipment brought to the Gaza border through Egypt, in a deal arranged by Qatar and France, will reach hostages held by Hamas in the besieged Palestinian enclave, Israel i President Isaac Herzog said on Thursday.\n“We are praying that all the medication …. will reach them, but that’s only the beginning,” Herzog told the World Economic Forum in Davos, sitting next to a picture of the youngest of the 132 hostages, one-year-old Kfir Bibas.\nHerzog, whose role is largely ceremonial, repeated his government’s stand that the Gaza war must result in the removal of the ruling Palestinian Islamist faction Hamas, which carried out a shock cross-border rampage in southern Israel on Oct 7.\nWhile saying he was not shying away from the “human tragedy” inflicted on Gaza civilians, Herzog cast the Israel i offensive as a step towards more peaceful relations with the Palestinians in the future, and as bolstering global security.\nHerzog called on world powers to help in post-war Gaza and noted that, before the Hamas attack, Israel had been on a path to establishing relations with Saudi Arabia after doing so in 2020 with Gulf neighbors United Arab Emirates and Bahrain.\n“We all understand that there has to be a vision, and I think part of it should be also going back to the normalization process of Israel and its neighbors in the region. I think it’s part of a package,” he said.\n“But that requires to support Israel ‘s efforts to undermine the capabilities of Hamas, and it’s still there.”",

    "text": "'La Revuelta' entona el 'mea culpa' por un 'gravísimo' error: «Cruzamos una frontera que no nos podemos permitir» El programa de Broncano ha recibido a Bad Gyal. La cantante española acaba de estrenar su propio documental ['La Joia: Bad Gyal', la historia del lanzamiento de su primer álbum](https://www.abc.es/play/cine/joia-bad-gyal-historia-lanzamiento-primer-album-20241024093906-vi.html) 'La Revuelta' mantiene en alto secreto la identidad de sus invitados cada noche, si bien es cierto que el nombre de la famosa que acudió este jueves 24 de octubre resonaba fuerte desde hace semanas y era la ocasión perfecta para que darle esa satisfacción a sus fans. Alba Farelo i Solé, conocida por todos como [Bad Gyal, acaba de estrenar 'La Joia'](https://www.abc.es/play/cine/joia-bad-gyal-historia-lanzamiento-primer-album-20241024093906-vi.html), un documental que sigue a la popular cantante desde la vertiginosa salida de su primer álbum. Hubo además un cruce de invitados. Juan Enrique Soto, policía, psicólogo, divulgador y analista de conductas criminales que trabajó, entre otros, en el caso Bretón, presentó la serie documental 'SAC: En la mente criminal,' que se estrena en RTVE Play el próximo 30 de octubre. Sensacional cruce de invitados este. De los mejores momentos de la temporada, si me preguntan. — La Revuelta (@LaRevuelta_TVE)[#LaRevuelta][@bad_gyal_pussy][@JuanEnriqsoto][pic.twitter.com/7rcoph0j1q][October 24, 2024] Antes de recibir en plató a los invitados intervino como es[ habitual, Jorge Ponce](https://www.abc.es/espana/madrid/jorge-ponce-revoluciona-true-crime-realidad-vestida-20241019122030-nt.html). Sin embargo, esta vez se trataba de «una cosa cortita, rápida y de poco chiste», anunciaba apesadumbrado el colaborador, nada que ver con la ironía y el sarcasmo que se gasta normalmente. Tanto es así que el propio Broncano le recordó que «aquí prima el chiste». «Hay veces que no se puede», espetó él. «Entramos en temas políticos a veces, hemos traído a Jordi Mollá, otras tiramos de la cuerda… Pero ayer cruzamos una frontera que no nos podemos permitir; ni hacerlo, ni hacer como si no hubiera ocurrido», afirmaba Ponce con severidad. «Al final del programa actuó Dani Fernández», empezó contando. A lo que añadió que «se hizo un corte de edición y se puso un rótulo para indicarlo». La 'vergüenza' de Broncano por lo sucedido con la edición El presentador, en ese momento, ya supo de qué se tratabas. «Haces bien en decirlo, esto es gravísimo. No nos podemos equivocar así», sentenciaba. El error en cuestión era que se les había escapado un 'trás' en el rótulo, con tilde en la 'a'. «Yo me avergüenzo, y no es broma», manifestaba el cómico manteniendo el mismo tono serio. Ponce seguía con la flagelación. «Es mearse encima de las preposiciones. Y eso porque estamos en La 1, si estuviéramos en La 2 nos habrían cancelado ya el programa», bromeaba. Pedimos perdón por un error IMPERDONABLE que sucedió en el programa de ayer. 🙏🏻 — La Revuelta (@LaRevuelta_TVE)[#LaRevuelta][pic.twitter.com/4z7rLgQ418][October 24, 2024] Grison apuntillaba que «si estuviéramos en Telecinco nos emitirían en 'prime time'», aunque acto seguido se dio cuenta de que quizá se le había ido la lengua. «Otra cadena más en la que no trabajo ya». Broncano siguió explicando que antes de la emisión se dieron cuenta, «preguntamos si se podía volver a enviar el programa para editarlo, pero nos dijeron que entonces no se emitía». Con lo cual, «hubo que elegir entre falta ortográfica o emitir el programa». sus fans.
