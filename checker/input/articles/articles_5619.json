    "title": "Around 33,000 Boeing workers vote to strike over pay dispute, putting company's recovery in jeopardy (WATCH)",
    "text": "Boeing workers voted overwhelmingly on Thursday night to go on strike, demanding higher pay and protesting against the company’s current leadership practices.\nSunita Iyer First Published Sep 13, 2024, 10:46 AM IST | Last Updated Sep 13, 2024, 10:46 AM IST Follow Boeing workers voted overwhelmingly on Thursday night to go on strike, demanding higher pay and protesting against the company’s current leadership practices. This strike, which marks the first since 2008, threatens to halt the production of Boeing’s top-selling jet and comes at a critical time for the aerospace giant as it struggles with chronic production delays and rising debt.\nThe strike action was triggered after approximately 33,000 Boeing employees from the US Pacific northwest rejected a tentative agreement reached between their union, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), and Boeing management. Workers voted 94.6% to reject the proposal, with an overwhelming 96% in favor of striking. The decision is set to come into effect on Friday at midnight Pacific Time (7 a.m. GMT).\nThe tentative agreement, reached on September 8 after marathon negotiations, included a 25% pay increase over a four-year period. However, this fell short of the union’s push for a 40% increase. Despite the union leadership recommending the deal, local union president Jon Holden told The Seattle Times that he expected workers to reject the agreement, given the intense backlash from employees.\n“Boeing is saying they are in a tough spot recovering, yet their executive salaries haven’t changed,” commented one Boeing mechanic, who spoke to the press on condition of anonymity. “COO [Chief Operating Officer] Stephanie Pope makes over $300,000 every two weeks. It’s much deeper than pay and benefits—it’s Boeing’s culture. We are a family here in my shop.”\nWorkers had expressed their discontent earlier in the week, staging a rally outside Boeing’s Everett, Washington, production facility, in protest of the tentative agreement. Many workers are particularly frustrated by Boeing’s allocation of resources in recent years.\nThe company has spent $68 billion on stock buybacks and dividends since 2010, despite being embroiled in scandal and grappling with production challenges.\nAdditionally, high executive salaries and compensation packages have fueled anger among workers.\nOutgoing CEO Dave Calhoun received a 45% raise in 2023, bringing his total earnings to nearly $33 million for the year. His predecessor, Dennis Muilenburg, who was ousted in 2019 after Boeing's 737 MAX crashes, walked away with a $62 million golden parachute.\nKelly Ortberg, Boeing’s newly appointed CEO, made a last-ditch effort to prevent the strike, urging workers not to jeopardize the company’s recovery. In a letter to employees in Washington and Oregon, Ortberg acknowledged the company’s turbulent history and the mistakes made in the past. He appealed for unity and patience, expressing concern that a strike would damage Boeing’s recovery efforts and further erode trust with customers.\n“I know the reaction to our tentative agreement with the IAM has been passionate. I understand and respect that passion, but I ask you not to sacrifice the opportunity to secure our future together, because of the frustrations of the past,” wrote Ortberg in a message to Boeing employees in Washington and Oregon.\n“For Boeing, it is no secret that our business is in a difficult period, in part due to our own mistakes in the past. Working together, I know that we can get back on track, but a strike would put our shared recovery in jeopardy, further eroding trust with our customers and hurting our ability to determine our future together.”\nDespite Ortberg’s plea, the workers' decision to strike underscores a deep-seated dissatisfaction with the current direction of the company. Many workers feel that Boeing’s leadership has failed to recognize the sacrifices they have made during the company’s recent struggles, even as top executives continue to receive large pay packages.\nThe strike comes at a particularly sensitive time for Boeing. The company has faced significant production delays across multiple aircraft lines, most notably the 737 MAX and the 787 Dreamliner, due to supply chain issues and ongoing regulatory scrutiny. The strike is expected to exacerbate these delays, further affecting Boeing’s ability to meet delivery schedules and fulfill customer orders.\nBoeing’s challenges are compounded by its mounting debt, which has increased as a result of recent production issues and a slow recovery in air travel demand following the COVID-19 pandemic. The halt in production due to the strike could put additional financial strain on the company, raising concerns about its long-term viability.\nBoeing Strike Aviation Latest Videos Follow Us: Download App: RELATED STORIES Groundbreaking!

    "text": "[Back to top](#skip-link) L'OMS a alerté jeudi 15 août que d'autres cas importés de variole du singe (mpox) étaient susceptibles d'être détectés prochainement en Europe après le signalement en Suède d'un premier cas d'un variant plus contagieux et dangereux de cette maladie qui a fait au moins 548 morts depuis le début de l'année en République démocratique du Congo (RDC), le pays le plus touché. \"Il est probable que d'autres cas importés de clade 1 (variant NDLR) soient enregistrés dans la région européenne au cours des prochains jours et des prochaines semaines\", a dit la branche Europe de l'Organisation mondiale de la santé (OMS) dans un communiqué. L'organisation avait déclenché mercredi son niveau d'alerte le plus élevé au plan international face à la résurgence des cas sur le continent africain. (Re)lire [Variole du singe : \"une urgence de santé publique\" pour l'agence de santé de l'Union africaine](https://information.tv5monde.com/node/2736026) Au total, 38.465 cas de cette maladie, anciennement connue sous le nom de variole du singe, ont été recensés dans 16 pays africains depuis janvier 2022, pour 1.456 décès, avec notamment une augmentation de 160% du nombre des cas en 2024 comparé à l'année précédente, selon des données publiées la semaine dernière par l'agence de santé de l'Union africaine, Africa CDC. (Re)lire [RDC : 548 décès de la variole du singe depuis le début de l'année](https://information.tv5monde.com/node/2736259) Et jeudi, l'Agence suédoise de santé publique a annoncé qu'une personne vivant dans la région de Stockholm avait été diagnostiquée comme porteuse du sous-type clade 1 du virus du mpox, plus contagieux et dangereux, une première hors d'Afrique. \"La personne touchée a été infectée au cours d'un séjour dans une région d'Afrique où sévit une importante épidémie de mpox du sous-type clade 1\", a expliqué Olivia Wigzell, la cheffe intérimaire de l'agence suédoise, pendant une conférence de presse. L'agence a assuré dans un communiqué que le fait qu'\"une personne soit traitée pour le mpox dans le pays n'implique pas de risque pour le reste de la population\". Le Centre européen de prévention et de contrôle des maladies (ECDC) considère pour l'heure ce risque comme étant très faible, a-t-elle ajouté. L'agence a précisé à l'AFP dans un message qu'il s'agissait du variant du mpox du sous-type clade 1b, qui connaît une résurgence en RDC depuis septembre 2023. Dans ce pays d'environ 100 millions d'habitants, toutes les provinces sont désormais touchées par l'épidémie. Pour l'OMS, \"il est impératif que nous ne stigmatisions pas les voyageurs ou les pays/régions\". \"Ce n'est qu'en travaillant ensemble, en partageant les données et en prenant les mesures de santé publique nécessaires que nous pourrons contrôler la propagation de ce virus\", a ajouté l'organisation qui estime crucial d'éviter restrictions de voyage et fermetures de frontières. Selon le dernier rapport épidémiologique, \"notre pays a enregistré 15.664 cas potentiels et 548 décès depuis le début de l'année\", a déclaré jeudi le ministre congolais de la Santé Samuel-Roger Kamba. Au 3 août, Africa CDC avait recensé 455 décès et 14.479 contaminations dans 25 des 26 provinces de la RDC. Les provinces du Sud-Kivu, du Nord-Kivu, de Tshopo (est), d'Équateur, du Nord-Ubangi, de Tshuapa, de Mongala (nord) et de Sankuru (centre) sont les plus affectées, selon le ministre. A travers la mobilisation internationale, \"nous activons tous les mécanismes nécessaires pour identifier et traiter les cas\" gratuitement, a souligné M. Kamba. Selon un communiqué du ministère américain de la Santé diffusé mercredi, \"la vaccination sera un élément essentiel de la riposte à cette épidémie. Pour soutenir cet effort, les États-Unis font don de 50.000 doses du vaccin Jynneos approuvé par la Food and Drug Administration (FDA) à la RDC\". Le laboratoire pharmaceutique danois Bavarian Nordic, dont le titre a bondi jeudi en Bourse, s'est dit prêt à produire jusqu'à 10 millions de doses de vaccins d'ici à 2025. Le mpox est une maladie virale qui se propage de l'animal à l'homme mais qui se transmet aussi via un contact physique étroit avec une personne infectée par le virus. En 2022, une épidémie mondiale, portée par le clade 2, s'était propagée dans une centaine de pays où la maladie n'était pas endémique, touchant surtout des hommes homosexuels et bisexuels. L'épidémie avait fait quelque 140 morts sur environ 90.000 cas. (Re)lire [Vaccin contre la variole du singe : fonctionnement, efficacité, production, ce qu'il faut savoir](https://information.tv5monde.com/node/1025813) L'épidémie actuelle, partie de la RDC, a ses spécificités, en premier lieu un virus plus contagieux et dangereux. Elle est provoquée par le clade 1 et par un variant encore plus dangereux, le clade 1b. Son taux de mortalité est évalué à 3,6%. Le clade 1b fait apparaître des éruptions cutanées sur tout le corps, quand les précédentes souches étaient caractérisées par des éruptions et des lésions localisées sur la bouche, le visage ou les parties génitales. Le mpox a été diagnostiqué pour la première fois chez des humains en 1970 dans l'actuelle RDC (ex-Zaïre), avec la diffusion du sous-type clade 1 (dont le nouveau variant est une mutation), principalement limitée depuis à des pays de l'ouest et du centre de l'Afrique, les malades étant généralement contaminés par des animaux infectés.",
