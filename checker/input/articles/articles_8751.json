    "title": "Harvard settles lawsuit alleging it ignored sexual harassment",
    "text": "By Nate Raymond\nBOSTON (Reuters) – Harvard University has settled a lawsuit accusing the Ivy League school of ignoring sexual harassment by a professor who three graduate students said had threatened their academic careers if they reported him.\nIn a filing on Wednesday in federal court in Boston, the three women – Margaret Czerwienski, Lilia Kilburn and Amulya Mandava – voluntarily dismissed their 2022 lawsuit following months of mediation with Harvard.\nTheir lawsuit gained national attention with its claims that John Comaroff, then an anthropology professor, for years kissed and groped students and threatened to sabotage students’ careers if they complained.\nTerms of the settlement were not disclosed. The law firm that represented the women, Sanford Heisler Sharp, said it was “glad that our clients will now be able to move on with their lives and careers.”\n“We’re proud of our clients’ courage in coming forward, speaking up about their experiences, and shedding light on important issues,” the law firm said in a statement.\nHarvard and Comaroff’s lawyer did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday. Comaroff, who retired earlier this year, issued a statement on his website in July calling the allegations false.\nWhen the suit was filed, his lawyers said he categorically denied ever harassing or retaliating against any student.\nThe #MeToo-era lawsuit followed an internal Harvard investigation that found Comaroff had engaged in verbal conduct that violated professional conduct and sexual harassment policies.\nThe three women said they were among the students who reported Comaroff to Harvard officials. Despite their warnings, Harvard watched as he retaliated by ensuring the students would have “trouble getting jobs,” the lawsuit said.\nThey said Harvard’s inaction allowed Comaroff to repeatedly and forcibly kiss Kilburn and grope her in public, and claimed he graphically described ways she would be supposedly raped or killed in South Africa for being in a same-sex relationship.\nThe lawsuit alleged Harvard violated Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which protects students from discrimination based on sex, and various Massachusetts laws. A judge largely rejected Harvard’s bid to dismiss the case in March 2023.\nComaroff was not a defendant. On his website, he said that as a result of the “fact-free allegations” he had before his retirement become the subject of an “ugly, ferocious campaign” by activists on campus who had occupied his classrooms and pressured students not to take courses with him.\n(Reporting by Nate Raymond in Boston; Editing by Howard Goller)",

    "title": "BSF’s ‘mahila praharis’ keep a hawk’s eye on border with Pak",
    "text": "In combat fatigues with automatic weapons on their shoulders and eyes glued to binoculars, a foot patrol of Border Security Force (BSF’s) women constables (mahila praharis) led by a woman officer maintain a hawk’s eye on Indo-Pak international border from anti-national elements on a chilly and foggy morning.Despite a renewed truce deal in February 2021 between the two nuke countries, peace is always fragile along the 198 km long Indo-Pak border in Jammu.However, these young women match the BSF men shoulder-to-shoulder when it comes to ward off any threat that could be armed terrorists from across the border, drug smugglers or ceasefire violations by the Pakistan.Hundreds of miles away from the comforts of their houses, these young women undergo rigorous training before being posted at the international borders in Jammu, Punjab, Rajasthan and West Bengal.An inspector deployed at the post on Jammu’s IB joined the BSF in 2010 as sub inspector and promoted as inspector in 2016.“I have served the nation on Indo-Bangladesh border before being posted at Indo-Pak border in Jammu. Guarding the border has its challenges but we were trained adequately to deal with them,” says 35-year-old young and energetic inspector.“On Jammu IB, ceasefire violations by Pakistan used to pose challenges to the men and women of the BSF on the border but we are always watchful to deal with such contingencies,” she adds.The woman officer, who is a company commander, informed that like their male colleagues, these young women also undergo rigorous trainings at different training centres of the BSF.“From weapons handling to drills and self-defence techniques, everything is taught to us before deploying us on the border. We are trained in handling all sorts of weapons with the BSF and we are performing our duties shoulder-to-shoulder with our male colleagues in all the tasks assigned to us including operational duties,” says the inspector.These women come from various states of the country and present a finest example of unity in diversity at the nation’s borders.“From foot patrolling to dog patrolling, we are present 24x7 on the border. There is not even a single moment when we are not dominating the IB to keep it safe from cross border threats,” she says.The woman inspector who belongs to Punjab’s Jalandhar, was brought up in an atmosphere where she frequently saw men in uniform.“Though there was none in my family, who served the armed forces, I am the first child in my family, who joined BSF. When I decided to join the BSF, there were no restrictions by my family,” she recalls.The company commander on the strategic border with Pakistan strongly feels that the BSF has given women equality, dignity and a congenial working atmosphere.“However, mental toughness is required for the girls desirous of joining the BSF,” she says.Women inspector is a post graduate.“Home sickness, at times, creeps in but the desire to serve the nation keeps us going. At the same time liberal leave for the women are also available in the BSF,” she says.These women guard the border in shifts, including night patrols, along with men colleagues.Another woman, a 28-year-old sub inspector is graduate and a bachelor in education. She joined the BSF in 2022. She comes from a family of men, who were in belt forces.“I was inspired by them to join the force,” she says. Trained in firing all automatic and semi-automatic weapons, she also underwent training at different places including Hazaribagh.“When villagers look up to us with honour, it gives a sense of pride to us. Many village girls frequently reach out to us and ask us how to get into the BSF,” she says.“I tell them to believe in themselves, pursue their academics and join the force for a bright career. At times, women also seek guidance for their daughters and it certainly gives a sense of pride,” she adds.It may be stated here that during winters when fog and chill engulf the international border making it vulnerable for the Pak terrorists and intruders to intrude into Indian territory, these women officers and constables get no special treatment by the BSF.They remain part and parcel of the border guarding duties even in winters.“During winters we have modern devices to keep 24x7 surveillance on the IB but there is no compromise on foot patrolling and constant surveillance by the BSF guards. Every morning, the fence and the patrolling tracks are checked and dog squads accompany us in it,” says the officer.Another woman constable from Uttarakhand, who joined the BSF in 2017, did so to serve the nation and at the same time be independent.She has also served on the border in Rajasthan’s Jaisalmer where border guarding was altogether different, compared to Jammu’s IB.“In our foot patrols, we increase or decrease the number of personnel depending upon the threat perception,” she says.Her colleague, a 34 -year old constable is from Punjab, who joined the BSF in 2008, had always cherished one dream--to don the uniform and serve the nation.“Mine was first batch of women that was inducted in the BSF. I was good in sports, so I was always confident of getting into the BSF,” she says.Her children live with her in a separate accommodation facility raised by the BSF close to the BOPs.From hectic regimen at the border, these women and men also get the time to beat the stress at recreational rooms where BSF has provided them indoor games like carom board, badminton, table tennis etc.Another senior constable with whom we interacted says, “Apart from recreational rooms, we do celebrate national and other festivals like we do with our families back home. We hold camp fire, sing songs, dance to the music. Rather, celebrating festivals with a large family of the BSF brings us more joy and adds colour to the festivities.”BSF Jammu frontier IG DK Boora said, “Unlike other armed forces, who have peacetime postings, there is no peacetime for the BSF. It’s 24x7x365 day job on the frontline. Women called ‘Mahila Prahari’ in combat roles are inducted in BSF since 2009 and they are performing all type of duties along with their male colleagues’ shoulder-to-shoulder on the international boundary of Jammu. Apart from frisking duties they are performing all type of combat roles as their male colleagues do,” said the IG.“These women Praharis are breaking stereotypes and have become a beacon of women empowerment. They are proving themselves in every field, be it in border guarding in combat role, leading the Seema Bhawani Squad or performing as Mahila camel contingent in RD parade,” he added.They are treated at par with their male colleagues and they are performing each and every task on BOPs. However, their special needs are looked after sympathetically. There is no issue of leave and welfare, he informed.“In today’s world, I feel the women work better than men. Not just shoulder-to-shoulder but better than men,” says the IG.“I convey this message to aspiring young women, who wish to join BSF that BSF is a professional force where they can deliver with pride and contribute to national cause. BSF offers them excellent opportunities to rise in their ranks through in service courses and they can lead a very dignified and satisfied life,” said Boora.It may be stated here that the BSF has set up 18 Ankur Schools (play way schools for toddlers) beside crèche facilities at different locations for the serving BSF women in the frontier.",

    "title": "DANA CANARIAS: Alerta por lluvia y la prealerta por vientos, tormentas, nieve y fenómenos costeros en Canarias",
    "text": "El Gobierno de Canarias, a través de la Dirección General de Emergencias, ha declarado la situación de alerta por lluvias en Gran Canaria, Lanzarote y Fuerteventura, a partir de las 15:00 horas de este viernes, 22 de marzo, y la prealerta por este mismo fenómeno en el resto las islas. A esto se suman, las declaraciones de prealerta por tormentas, nieve, viento y fenómenos costeros en diferentes puntos del Archipiélago, coincidiendo con el paso por las islas de una Depresión Aislada en Niveles Altos (DANA), que traerá inestabilidad durante varios días. Estas decisiones se toman en base a la información facilitada por la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (Aemet) y otras fuentes disponibles, y en aplicación del Plan Específico de Emergencias de Canarias por Riesgos de Fenómenos Meteorológicos Adversos (PEFMA). Las lluvias afectarán principalmente a las islas orientales, donde se esperan precipitaciones que serán mayoritariamente chubascos débiles a moderados con probables aguaceros, puntualmente fuertes, que podrán alcanzar o superar los 15-30 litros en 30 minutos y acumulados de 50 litros en doce horas. Las precipitaciones más intensas y copiosas se esperan en zonas del interior de la vertiente este de estas islas. En las islas occidentales se esperan chubascos débiles a moderados y probables aguaceros que superarán los 15-25 litros en una hora. Esta situación de inestabilidad puede generar actividad eléctrica atmosférica en toda la comunidad autónoma, lo que ha llevado a la Dirección General de Emergencias a declarar también la prealerta por tormentas en todo el archipiélago, ya que pueden ser localmente fuertes. En cuanto a la nieve, la prealerta afecta a las cumbres de La Palma y Tenerife, donde se espera aire frío en capas altas que pueden generar precipitaciones en forma de nieve por encima de los 1.800 metros de altitud. También podrán producirse cencelladas y placas de hielo en las carreteras de las cumbres de estas islas y de Gran Canaria. La fuerza de los vientos previstos ha hecho que la Dirección General de Emergencias declare también la prealerta en las islas occidentales donde se espera viento del norte y noroeste flojo a moderado con intervalos fuertes y probables rachas muy fuertes que podrán superar los 70 kilómetros hora en cumbres y medianías altas del norte. Asimismo, el Gobierno mantiene la prealerta por fenómenos costeros en toda la comunidad autónoma, declarada el pasado miércoles 20 de marzo, ya que se mantiene el mal estado del mar en costas abiertas al norte y al oeste con olas de mar combinada de 2,5-3,5 metros. Ante esta situación de inestabilidad se recomienda evitar circular en coche durante las lluvias fuertes. Si es imprescindible preste especial atención a la altura del agua, moderando la velocidad y vigilando los frenos. Si el vehículo comienza a llenarse de agua, es mejor abandonarlo. Debe tener especial precaución con la formación de placas de hielo en zonas altas. Durante la tormenta no se refugie bajo los árboles, la madera mojada también es conductora de la electricidad. Desenchufe los aparatos eléctricos, las subidas de tensión pueden dañarlos o se pueden producir descargas eléctricas. Para evitar incidentes por las fuertes rachas de viento previstas revise las viviendas para que no haya cornisas, balcones o fachadas en mal estado que puedan producir caídas de cascotes y escombros y retire los objetos que puedan caer a la calle y provocar un accidente. Además, recuerde no circular con vehículos por carreteras cercanas a la línea de playa y no se sitúe en el extremo de muelles o espigones, ni se arriesgue a sacar fotografías o vídeos cerca de donde rompen las olas.",

    "title": "How 4 female hospital leaders are driving change",
    "text": "Women in healthcare leadership roles across the U.S. drove significant improvements within their organizations in 2024. From reducing patient length of stay to boosting employee engagement, these leaders achieved measurable growth through percentage changes and other key metrics.\nHere are four women who recently shared their success stories with Becker's.\n1. A mindset shift for lowered infection rates: Susan Carroll, president of Inova Loudoun Hospital in Leesburg, Va., met with her senior nursing team in March 2022 to tackle rising hospital-acquired infections, which had reached six in the first two months of the year. Ms. Carroll implemented a \"stop the line\" program, encouraging medical staff to evaluate whether a line was truly needed.\nOver two years, the hospital's ICU reduced the number of lines from 245 per month to 42. The hospital had reported six confirmed infections in 2024, Ms. Carroll told Becker's in November. This includes two central line-associated bloodstream infections, matching the total from just the first two months of 2022.\n2. Transparency to increase engagement: Dana Weston Graves, president of Virginia Beach, Va.-based Sentara Princess Anne Hospital, told Becker's in October that her hospital's employee engagement scores increased from the 60th percentile to the 81st in one year.\nTo drive these improvements, all leaders developed customized action plans based on team feedback. Ms. Graves also implemented an initiative where QR codes allowed staff to submit questions directly to her, which she would answer publicly at town halls. The transparency and following through to address concerns has led to greater trust.\n3. Three keys to reduced length of stay: Lee Ann Liska, president of Vanderbilt University Hospital in Nashville, Tenn., has led the facility to a sustained reduction in patient length of stay over the past few years. The mean length of stay in 2024 is 5.86, Ms. Liska told Becker's in November. This is compared to 6.08 days in 2023.\nExecutive physician leadership, bedside care provider engagement, and accurate documentation of patient acuity and comorbidities contributed to this improvement, Ms. Liska said.\n4. Boosting employee engagement as a new leader: Debbie Streier set out to improve employee engagement scores after becoming regional president and CEO of Avera Marshall (Minn.) Regional Medical Center in 2021. Between 2021 and 2024, employee engagement scores increased by 43%, Ms. Streier told Becker's in October.\nThe belief that staff are the best experts influenced her prioritization of employee feedback, holding listening sessions with each department to understand what needed improvement and whether staff had the necessary tools for their jobs.",

    "text": "The Agriculture Ministry is paying special attention to the destruction of nearly 40% of fresh Vegetable and Fruits, while being transported from distant cultivation areas to major vegetable markets, including at Dambulla, Peliyagoda and other vegetable markets, and said proper transportation guidelines should be maintained to minimise the destruction of Vegetables and Fruits. According to the Industrial Technology Institute of Sri Lanka (ITISL),Vegetable and Fruits are mainly transported from the cultivation Districts of Dambulla, Peliyagoda, Polonnaruwa, Giritale, Nuwara Eliya, Welimada, Ampara and Anuradhapura to countrywide Economic Centres, and from there to Colombo and suburban towns. Agriculture Minister Minister Mahhinda Amaraweera said Vegetable and Fruit destruction during transportations could be decreased from the current 40% to at least around 10%, by using Plastic crates to transport certain varieties of Vegetables and Fruits such as Tomatoes, Cabbage, Leeks, Green vegetable, Lime, Chilies, Capsicum, Oranges, Mangoes, Pineapple, Grapes etc. The Minister also highlighted that, in addition, destruction of Vegetable and Fruits could also be minimised if the harvest of certain Vegetables such as Ladies fingers, Beans, Dambala and String Beans and also Fruits such as Papaw, Mangoes and Pineapple are done at the proper time, before they mature. ITISL reports also indicate that many farmers harvest without following proper agricultural guidelines, in order to maximise profits from their harvest. According to research, Vegetable cannot be preserved for long periods when workers are seated on gunny bags full of fresh Vegetables during transportation. Meanwhile, Peliyagoda Manning Market Vegetable Traders Association, member Somasiri Peiris said, in addition, a large quantity of Vegetable and Fruits need not be destroyed if Railway transportation is strengthened by the Agriculture Ministry. He said due to this situation around 3,000 kg of Vegetables and Fruits are considered garbage almost every day.",
