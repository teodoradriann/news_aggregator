    "title": "Virginia reports first pediatric death of 2023 flu season",
    "text": "The Virginia Department of Health reported the state’s first influenza-associated pediatric death for the season on Thursday.\nOfficials reported that a child between the ages of five and 12 in Virginia’s Eastern region died from complications associated with the virus. To protect the family’s privacy, VDH said they will not provide any further information.\n“We at the Virginia Department of Health, are brokenhearted and extend our sympathies to the family of this child during this difficult time,” said State Health Commissioner Dr. Karen Shelton. “Even though the flu is common, it can cause serious illness and even death […] I urge everyone who is eligible to receive the flu vaccine to do so, not only to protect themselves, but to protect those around them.”\nVDH said that as we get into the tougher part of flu season amidst the onset of winter months, three main actions are recommended to prevent the flu, or reduce its effects if you do contract it:\n- Everyone over the age of six months should receive a yearly flu vaccine, consulting your healthcare provider as needed;\n- Practice good preventive measures inclusing hand hygiene (regularly washing your hands with soap and water or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer), respiratory etiquette (coughing and sneezing into a tissue or the inside of your elbow, rather than your open hand), and staying home when you feel sick; and\n- If you do become sick with the flu, seek healthcare early in your illness when necessary. Antivirals prescribed by a healthcare provider are a treatment option for some patients and can help prevent serious flu complications.\nThe state’s flu numbers are expected to climb as the weather gets colder.\nFor the week ended December 23, VDH said emergency department and urgent care visits due to flu-like illness were elevated (6.9% of total visits), especially among young children and school-aged children (14.7% and 13.2% of visits, respectively).\nWhile the department isn’t expecting a dramatic spike, even typical seasons vary widely and result in illness, hospitalizations, and deaths. Virginia reported five influenza-associated pediatric deaths during last year’s flu season.\nAnother issue is the shortage of eligible people getting their flu shot.\n“The percent of eligible Virginians reporting receipt of a flu vaccine this season is only 27%,” the state said in a release.\n“Vaccines are available and can help protect people from the most serious health effects of flu viruses.\nA recent study estimated that flu vaccination reduced the risk of flu-related emergency department and urgent care visits by almost half and hospitalization by more than a third among U.S. adults during the 2022-23 season. With flu activity increasing in Virginia, now is still a good time to get a flu vaccine if you have not already,” the release said.\nTo locate a seasonal flu vaccine near you, you can visit\nvaccinate.virginia.gov or contact your local health department. For further information, call (804) 864-8141.\nCurrent data updates and additional information about respiratory diseases in Virginia are available on the\nVDH Respiratory Diseases website.",

    "title": "Roach City: Houston Tops National Ranking with 37% of Homes with Roaches, San Antonio #2",
    "text": "Cockroaches. Just the thought of living with cockroaches gives most people the jeepers. But it seems that residents in Houston have to live with them.\nPest Gnome, a company that connects people with pest exterminators, recently ranked the most roach-infested cities in the U.S. using data from the Census Bureau, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The study looked at “The 25 Roachiest Cities in America.”\nThe city that earned the highest average score was ranked as No. 1, or the “Roachiest,” and the lowest average score as No. 25, or “Least Roachy.”\nAt the top of the list is Houston,\nTexas. A staggering 37 percent of homes showed signs of roaches in the past 12 months. Pest Gnome attributes this high prevalence to Houston’s hot and humid climate, which provides ideal conditions for roach infestations, CW39 reported.\nAccording to Pest Gnome, the two most common types of cockroaches in Houston are the big, brown, and flying American cockroach (aka palmetto bug) and the kitchen, pantry, and sink-dwelling German cockroach.\nAnother Texas city came in second. San Antonio claimed the second position on the list, with approximately 28 percent of homes displaying signs of roaches in the past year. Rounding out the top five were Tampa, Florida; Phoenix, Arizona; and Las Vegas, Nevada.\nDiscover How Affordable Peace of Mind Can Be: Get Your Life Insurance Quote Today!\n“All of these cities have sun and heat in summer, which roaches love, and winters here just don’t get that cold to kill them off,” Pest Gnome said,\nKSAT reported.\nAt the bottom, at no. 25, was Seattle, WA.\nCockroaches can also pose a health risk to humans.\n“Cockroaches are known to transfer disease pathogens, such as the various bacteria that produce ‘food poisoning’ in humans, by contaminating food, food preparation surfaces, dishes and eating utensils,” the Illinois Department of Public Health stated on its\n website.\nPhoto by Erik Karits, https://www.pexels.com/photo/a-cockroach-on-a-rock-11032990/We Love Houston photo, Flickr, by Kristina D.C.
