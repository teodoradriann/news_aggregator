    "title": "FIRs filed after video shows mob taking bloodied man to police station in Raipur | India News - The Indian Express",
    "text": "Two FIRs have been filed in Chhattisgarh’s capital Raipur after a video emerged Thursday purportedly showing a man, who runs a madrasa, with blood on his face and surrounded by a mob. According to police, the video is of an incident from Sinodha village, around 50 km from [Raipur](https://indianexpress.com/elections/raipur-lok-sabha-election-results/), which took place Wednesday. It shows the man being taken to Tilda Newra police station, surrounded by a mob chanting slogans and carrying saffron flags. While he has blood on his face, the video does not show him being assaulted. A senior police officer said, “A 14-year-old boy from the village had uploaded an allegedly objectionable video. We received a complaint from a villager, and during investigation, learnt that 3 persons, including the man in the video, had allegedly provoked him. We lodged an [FIR](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/fir-cognizable-offence-ipc-explained-7780266/) against them.” Before police could make arrests, he was allegedly assaulted by a mob. Two FIRs have been filed. One is against members of the mob. No arrest has been made so far. The other is against the man and 2 other accused. Bihar's political landscape is in turmoil as the JD(U)-RJD-Congress alliance faces a potential split, with Chief Minister Nitish Kumar likely to switch sides to the NDA. Amidst talks of a rift, separate meetings were held by the RJD and JD(U) while BJP leaders discussed the situation in Delhi. Tensions rose after Nitish appeared to criticize dynastic rule, causing further speculation.",

    "text": "Today marks the end of the third week since the launch of the ambitious new Seven West Media digital newspaper The Nightly.\nAlthough early in its life, editor-in-chief Anthony De Ceglie spoke confidently about the outlook. He indicated its revenue base was secured and that initial audience numbers were encouraging.\nThat minor three-week milestone has coincided with a launch event held in Sydney for the publication.\nThe event was held at the offices of Seven West Media and co-hosted by the Kennedy Foundation and Telum Media.\nAn evening with The Nightly: Seven’s Neil Warren and Craig McPherson, The Nightly’s Sarah-Jane Tasker and James Warburton\nTop: Warburton with Tasker, Anthony De Ceglie and Jeff Howard\nThe event space inside Seven was close to full as guests were welcomed by Seven West Media chief executive James Warburton . A number of guests also watched a live stream from inside Seven. “We have replaced Home and Away for the night,” smiled Warburton. He was joined by members of his management team including chief marketing and audience officer Mel Hopkins , CFO and CEO-in-waiting Jeff Howard , director of news and public affairs Craig McPherson , chief digital officer Gereurd Roberts, chief people and culture officer Lucinda Gemmell, and chief content officer Angus Ross . Also in attendance were Seven Sydney news director Neil Warren , director of 7RED Kate Finney and head of Seven Network publicity Kate Amphlett .\nThe West’s Maryna Fewster was unable to attend, but she received special thanks from De Ceglie for her support for the new project. Commercial director Bruce McWilliam was also absent, quite possibly attending an auction or open for inspection.\nSeven’s Gemma Acton\nInvestment banker-turned-Seven finance editor Gemma Acton hosted the event and introduced the panel from The Nightly . Speaking about the launch and initial learnings at The Nightly were editor-in-chief Anthony De Ceglie, editor Sarah-Jane Tasker and chief correspondent Sarah Blake .\nMediaweek was lucky enough to be called on to pepper the panellists with a series of questions about the publication and its outlook.\nThe panel: Anthony De Ceglie, Sarah Blake and Sarah-Jane Tasker with Mediaweek’s James Manning\nIn less than three weeks The Nightly has delivered an impressive list of editorial features. Those features have included an interview with J ames Packer , and a launch week feature from Christopher Dore on the first two years of the Labor government with insiders rating the performance of the cabinet members.\nCover stories this week have included problems with green laws, a China-linked café selling coffee to Canberra’s top spies, and Sarah Blake on the likelihood of an Australian TikTok ban.\nSome of the team from The Nightly including Sarah-Jane Tasker, Anthony De Ceglie, Sarah Blake, Matthew Quagliotto, Remy Varga and Christopher Dore\nDe Ceglie and Tasker explained how the small team was managing the workload. De Ceglie admitted that they were on the lookout for new contributors. He and Tasker were thrilled with the columns being provided by his Seven West colleagues including Michael Usher, Hugh Whitfeld, Gemma Acton, and Mark Riley.\nEast-coast-based Sarah Blake was joined by fellow Sydney-based staffers including Christopher Dore, Remy Varga, Matthew Quagliotto and Wenlei Ma .\nThe local journalism in The Nightly is supplemented by editorial from The New York Times, The Economist, Daily Mail and The (London) Telegraph .\nSeven’s Angus Ross (left), Manning and Seven’s Gereurd Roberts\nPeople who sign up for The Nightly not only also receive the daily edition for free at 6pm. They can also engage across the day via news alerts and there are regular posts across the socials X, Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn.\nWhen asked about the advertising, De Ceglie didn’t want to reveal too many details. He did indicate the title’s future has been secured by the initial partners. Yet he was also keen to see the advertiser base widened. When it was pointed out that some of Australia’s major newspapers don’t carry much display advertising, he said that confirms there is a massive opportunity for The Nightly .\nSee also: Launch day for The Nightly – Seven West Media’s daily paper aimed at “mainstream middle”",

    "text": "I love seeing the differences in the dynamics between a big family and a small family. I have 2 sisters, and I would consider my family to be small. Growing up with only two siblings got me to become really close with them. There is a two-year gap between me and my older sister, and also a two-year gap between me and my younger sister, so we have a lot in common. Meanwhile, my best friend grew up in a family of 10. Being 8 siblings, there is an 18-year gap between the youngest and the oldest sibling. By the time the younger siblings grow up, they barely get to see their older siblings. Although my friend claims they are all also very close, and that the family gatherings are a blast. There are also a lot of families in between these two situations, and so I like to observe the relationships in these different families. This brings me to the story of this woman who turned to the people of Reddit to see if she was in the wrong for not wanting her boyfriend's kids to show up at their house unannounced. As he has 7 of them, that can make things a little complicated in their household. The people of Reddit did not hesitate to fully judge this woman and her situation, so scroll down for the full story.

    "text": "应柬埔寨国王西哈莫尼邀请，国家主席习近平即将对柬埔寨进行国事访问。柬埔寨各界人士热切期待习近平主席来访，认为此访必将进一步巩固柬中铁杆友谊，赋予柬中命运共同体新的时代内涵。他们表示，相信在两国领导人战略引领下，柬中全面战略合作伙伴关系将取得更多积极成果，更好造福两国人民。\n　　“牢不可破的友谊”\n　　4月的柬埔寨，绿意正浓。时隔近9年，习近平主席将再次到访。\n　　2016年10月，习近平主席访问柬埔寨，其间看望柬埔寨太后莫尼列。莫尼列太后邀请习近平主席在西哈努克太皇生前常坐的椅子上就座。\n　　太皇的小女儿阿伦公主对这温暖一幕印象深刻。“这是只有最尊贵、最亲密的客人才能享有的待遇，让我感受到两国根植于历史的深厚情谊。”阿伦公主说，她对习近平主席再度访问柬埔寨热烈欢迎，充满期待，相信这次历史性访问将成为一座鼓舞人心的灯塔，照亮柬中加强互利合作和伙伴关系的前行之路。\n　　中国和柬埔寨是同甘共苦、守望相助的铁杆朋友。回望历史，中柬传统友谊由两国老一辈领导人共同缔造、精心培育。数十年来，中柬始终坚定支持彼此核心利益，两国友谊历经风云变幻考验，始终根深叶茂。近年来，在两国领导人战略引领下，中柬命运共同体建设迈入高质量、高水平、高标准的新时代。\n　　柬中友好协会主席艾森沃用“牢不可破”形容柬中关系。他说，两国树立了大小国家平等相待、互利共赢的典范，他为柬中铁杆友谊感到自豪。“期待习近平主席此访进一步巩固两国团结合作，推动柬中命运共同体建设取得更多丰硕成果。”\n　　柬埔寨贝尔泰国际大学教授约瑟夫·马修斯表示，中方始终支持柬埔寨在地区和国际事务中发挥更大作用，不断加强两国在东盟、澜湄合作等多边平台的协调配合，为维护发展中国家利益、壮大全球南方力量作出贡献。他相信，习近平主席此访将进一步丰富两国铁杆友谊的深刻内涵，成为柬中传统友好新的里程碑。\n　　“架起通向希望与发展的桥梁”\n　　“习近平主席的访问足以表明两国关系正在不断巩固并持续发展。”柬埔寨首相洪玛奈12日说，柬中深厚友谊与合作是双方携手并进的坚实基础。\n　　当天，由上海建工集团股份有限公司承建的柬埔寨71C号国家公路在柬埔寨特本克蒙举行通车启用仪式。柬方表示，71C号国家公路与已建成的柬中友谊大桥相辅相成，改善了交通条件，促进人文交流与商贸往来，真正架起一座通向希望与发展的桥梁。洪玛奈在致辞中说，这是“柬中务实合作的又一有力见证”。\n　　这些年来，中柬“钻石六边”合作架构不断充实，“工业发展走廊”和“鱼米走廊”建设持续推进；中国连续多年是柬埔寨最大外资来源国和最大贸易伙伴，过去10年双边贸易额增长近4倍；中柬自贸协定和《区域全面经济伙伴关系协定》生效实施带来的政策红利持续释放；金港高速公路、西哈努克港经济特区等中柬共建“一带一路”合作重点项目为柬埔寨发展繁荣带来新动能……\n　　“依托‘一带一路’倡议，金港高速公路等多个项目加强了柬埔寨与世界的联通，让柬埔寨走上发展快车道。期待习近平主席此访能为柬埔寨带来更多机遇，为两国互利合作开辟更广阔前景。”柬埔寨商业部国务秘书兼发言人宾索维吉说。\n　　柬埔寨皇家科学院国际关系研究所国际经济系主任洪瓦纳表示，中国秉持开放理念，积极与柬方共享技术和经验，有效提升柬埔寨自主发展能力。“期待此访助力柬埔寨实现有韧性的可持续发展。希望在两国领导人战略引领下，柬中能不断发掘未来合作新的发力点，实现优势互补。”\n　　“中国高质量发展道路为柬埔寨提供有益借鉴。”柬埔寨证券公司董事会主席邓镇岳说，中国创造了举世瞩目的绿色发展奇迹，在科技创新领域也取得长足进步。“期待此访进一步深化柬中两国在清洁能源、人工智能等领域合作，推动两国务实合作朝着更高质量、更高水平方向前进。”\n　　“为两国铁杆友谊汇聚友好力量”\n　　中国和柬埔寨都是文明古国，两国间人文交流源远流长。中国元代使节在《真腊风土记》一书中记载了两国人民的友好往来，柬埔寨巴戎寺壁画上展示了古代中国商人同柬埔寨人民往来的生动情景。\n　　“柬中两国都有深厚历史和灿烂文明，有着精神共鸣，这为两国民心相通奠定坚实基础。”柬埔寨吴哥古迹保护和管理机构副局长兼发言人隆戈萨说，两国多年来积极开展古迹修复合作，正是两个文明之间互学互鉴的体现。“期待习近平主席此访深化柬中文明对话，进一步拉近柬中人民的心灵。”\n　　2019年举办“中柬文化旅游年”，2023年举办“中柬友好年”，2024年举办“中柬人文交流年”……种类多样的交流活动近年来在两国轮番登场，中柬人民相知愈深、友谊愈坚。\n　　去年4月，“当少林遇见吴哥”功夫文化交流活动在柬埔寨暹粒举行。中国武僧与柬埔寨斗狮拳手同台，给亚太旅游协会柬埔寨分会主席吞西南留下深刻印象。吞西南说，各类民间交流活动为两国人民深入体验对方文化提供宝贵契机，期盼习近平主席的访问能给柬中文化交流带来更多暖意，不断增进两国人民了解与信任。\n　　随着中国文化在柬埔寨影响力不断扩大，当地民众学习中文的热情持续升温。柬埔寨开办了4所孔子学院，另有多个孔子课堂和汉语中心，中文已纳入柬国民教育体系。作为中国职业教育第一所海外应用技术大学，中柬共建的柬华应用科技大学采用“技能+中文”模式，助力柬埔寨复合型人才教育培养。\n　　“柬中人文纽带日益紧密，两国在教育、医疗、体育、旅游等领域合作潜力巨大。”柬埔寨皇家科学院孔子学院柬方院长陈统崇说。“我对习近平主席此次访问充满期待，相信此访将推动柬中人文交流不断走深走实，为两国铁杆友谊汇聚友好力量、提供人文支撑。”新华社",

    "text": "Cluster of new mpox variant found in China: Know what it is\nChinese health officials have identified a new mutated strain of mpox, clade Ib, in a foreigner who travelled to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).\nIn Short\n- China has discovered a cluster of new mpox strain, clade Ib\n- The WHO declared mpox a public health emergency due to the spread of the strain\n- The strain has higher virulence causing skin rash and blisters\nChinese health officials have detected a new mutated strain of mpox, called clade Ib, as the virus continues to spread to more countries. The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared mpox a global public health emergency last year.\nChina's Centre for Disease Control and Prevention reported a cluster of cases linked to a foreigner who had travelled to and lived in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).\nFour additional cases were found among people who had close contact with this individual. The symptoms in these patients are mild and include skin rashes and blisters.\nMpox spreads through close contact and causes flu-like symptoms along with pus-filled lesions on the skin. While it is usually not severe, it can be fatal in rare cases.\nIn August last year, the WHO declared mpox a global health emergency for the second time in two years, following an outbreak in Congo that spread to neighbouring countries.\nThe outbreak in Congo initially involved an endemic strain called clade I. However, the clade Ib variant is thought to spread more easily through regular close contact, including sexual contact.\nThis new variant has since spread to neighbouring countries like Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda, prompting the WHO's emergency declaration.\nIn response, China announced in August last year that it would monitor people and goods entering the country for mpox.\nThe National Health Commission also classified mpox as a Category B infectious disease. This allows authorities to take emergency measures such as restricting public gatherings, suspending work and school, or locking down areas during an outbreak.\nIndia had reported the mpox clade Ib strain last year September. This newer strain is known for its higher virulence, leading to more severe symptoms and complications.\nPatients infected with the strain are at greater risk of experiencing serious health issues, including a higher mortality rate of up to 10%.\nAccording to a report published in Nature, \"Clade Ib seems to be different, and is spreading largely through contact between humans, including through sex. Around 18,000 suspected cases of mpox, many of them among children, and at least 600 deaths potentially attributable to the disease have been reported this year (2024) in the DRC alone.\"\nOther health conditions can affect death rates. For example, people with untreated HIV are twice as likely to die from mpox compared to the general population. This is especially significant in many African countries where a large number of people live with HIV.\nWHAT IS MPOX?\nMpox is a severe illness caused by the monkeypox virus, which was first identified in 1958. It causes fever, chills, body aches, headache, muscle pain, and fatigue, with the highlighting signs being a skin rash that develops into blisters and sores.\nThe virus also causes swollen lymph nodes in some cases.\nA person infected with the virus must be isolated as the infection is easily transferrable to another with close contact via person, animal and contaminated materials.\nWhile most cases of mpox are mild and can resolve on their own. Severe cases require antiviral treatment.\nThe virus has two distinct clades: clade I (with subclades Ia and Ib) and clade II (with subclades IIa and IIb).\nThe one that led to WHO's emergency declaration was clade Ib.\nIn September, the WHO approved the first mpox vaccine, MVA-BN, for the prequalification list. The MVA-BN vaccine is administered as a two-dose injection given four weeks apart, and approved for people over 18 years old.\nAfter being stored in cold conditions, it can remain stable at temperatures between 2 to 8 degrees Celsius for up to eight weeks.\n(With inputs from Reuters)",
