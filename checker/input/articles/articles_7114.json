    "title": "Colors and Emotions: How Visuals Enhance Our Experiences - The Design Inspiration",
    "text": "Colors have a massive impact on emotions and overall human psychology. This explains why ‘what is your favorite color’ is among the most popular first date questions. People perceive color differently based on their life experiences. However, there is a universal feeling that is elicited by different colors, and you will find them having the same impact on many people and evoking certain responses. They tend to tell a story without using words. Let us explore the power of visuals in our day-to-day experience.\nThe psychology of colors is deeply considered in the design processes of various websites. For instance, all casinos have the same goal, so you will find some similarities in the choice of colors. When you go to the [HitnSpin app download](https://hitnspincasino.com/app/), the first feeling it elicits usually encourages you to kickstart your experience. The designers must have intentionally picked the colors to achieve this magic!\nTwo Main Types: Warms & Colds\nEvery color has a meaning and personality that gives it the power to arouse certain emotions. Thus, it is the first thing that communicates to your audience. There are two general types of colors based on their emotional impact.\n-\nWarm – they include red, yellow, and orange. They tend to instill feelings of energy, passion, happiness, hunger, and positivity. All of them have an uplifting vibe that encourages you to take a step. They are used in warning signs, restaurants, and romantic places.\n-\nCool – they include blue, purple, and green. They have a calming and sometimes sad effect on people.\nThese colors have different shades so designers can tweak them to enhance a certain feeling. Let us take a look at what different colors can do to our emotions:\nRed & Blue\nRed is the most outstanding in the world. It signals extremes. It is the universal color of love on its positive end and also the universal color of danger. Red usually arouses passion and fires you to do things. In Asian cultures, it signifies happiness and luck, and this explains why it is the color of the Lunar New Year.\nIf you are looking for a calming, relaxing, and friendly effect, blue will always deliver. It is a bold color that usually stamps authority and builds trust. Most of the top organizations have blue branding for this reason. However, there are different shades, and the darker ones tend to be gloomy and are thus less preferable. People prefer lighter shades!\nGreen & Yellow\nGreen is the color of nature that produces a relaxed and positive effect. People love green spaces with vegetation because of this. It elicits feelings of positive growth and inspires optimism.\nYellow is another shouting color that is associated with sunlight. It is the one that signifies joy and happiness. Yellow will always inspire a light moment and is impossible to not notice it.\nPink & Black\nPink has different shades that can either elicit feelings of sweetness and playfulness, or rebellion and attention seeking. It is also regarded as feminine while blue is regarded as masculine.\nBlack color elicits a feeling of class and elegance. It is regarded as professional, and this explains why it is used in official attire. Black tends to have a subtle professional look with a tinge of mystery. However, it is also used in times of mourning especially when used purely without combining any other color. Due to the terms black magic and black market, it can also be associated with evil and danger.\nBlack is closely related to gray, which also shows professionalism. It is less outstanding making it seem more conventional.\nWhite & Purple\nPeace, innocence, and simplicity are associated with white. It is used in hospitals, hotel rooms, baby clothes, and also by religious men and women to show purity. However, white also tends to pull attention because it stands out, especially if used exclusively.\nThis is the color of royalty and luxury. It has a calm and reassuring effect on people. In the Catholic church, it is used in funerals. You will often find it in elegant perfumes and bags because of the royalty aspect.\nChoose the Color Wisely!\nThese are the main ones that are used for branding. For them to work, you must use the right shade and the best quality graphics that will illuminate the desired feeling. Secondly, you may desire to pass different messages at a go. This makes it necessary to use a blend of colors as opposed to one. One of the colors may be dominant but the rest come in to soften the feelings. The psychology of color is a complex subject that bothers even the most seasoned designers. Hence, they do various tests and pilots before settling for a color scheme.\nColors have a significant impact on the emotions of people. Each of them tells a certain story. It goes even deeper to the specific shade that could pass a different message. It is important to use the right blend of colors to pass the desired message.",

    "text": "Weather warning zones for England and Wales on Saturday and Sunday\nThe Met Office has issued a severe weather warning ahead of the New Year’s weekend as the country recovers from Storm Gerrit. Just days after the storm wreaked havoc on roads, damaged properties and cut power across the UK, another band of powerful winds are set to strike the nation.\nThe warnings covers the whole of the South West, parts of western Wales and the South English coastline. The Met Office has said this wave of bad weather is caused by an active cold front which will move eastwards on Saturday, December 30 and into New Year’s Eve. The alert is in place from 11am on Saturday until 3am on Sunday morning.\nThe Exeter-based forecaster says: “A spell of strong and gusty winds will move east across England and Wales, bringing some disruption to travel and services.” There may be some disruption to road, rail, ferry and air transport services, power cuts and large waves along the coastline.\n“An active cold front will move east across England and Wales during Saturday and into Sunday and will be characterised by strong winds and some heavy rain,” the Met Office adds. “Gusts of 45-50 mph widely, but squally near the cold front with some gusts around 60 mph, whilst the strongest gusts are likely near coasts in the west and south, with 65-75 mph in places.”\nIt comes just days after similar conditions brought by Storm Gerrit. Parts of the UK faced winds of more than 80mph, with trees and scaffolding blown down by the powerful gusts. In Greater Manchester, around 100 properties were damaged by a 160mph ‘tornado’ which reportedly swept through the city.\nThe warning is expected to end at around 3am on Sunday, December 31 and the strong winds are likely to weaken through the day and into January 1. Though the warning is just for wind, heavy rain is also expected the batter the region. Steven Ramsdale is a Met Office Chief Forecaster. He said: “This system is likely to bring a range of weather including hill snow. Heavy rain will spread across all but the far north on Saturday affecting similar areas previously affected by Storm Gerrit. However, this rainfall will be a step down from that seen during Storm Gerrit.”\nWhat to Expect Some delays to road, rail, air and ferry transport are likely It’s likely that some coastal routes, sea fronts and coastal communities will be affected by spray and/or large waves Probably some bus and train services affected, with some journeys taking longer Some short term loss of power and other services is possible Delays for high-sided vehicles on exposed routes and bridges likely",

    "text": "Washington, DC, May 6, 2025 — The U.S. is unprepared to handle the huge pollution footprint flowing from the imminent launch of tens of thousands of commercial communications satellites into low-Earth orbit, according to Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER). Yet, when needed most, the scientific entities tracking these impacts are on the chopping block.\nLed by corporations such as Elon Musk’s Starlink, the current 8,100 telecom satellites in orbit are about to proliferate at an estimated rate of 10,000 new satellites a year. By 2040, some 60,000 satellites are projected to be arrayed in mega-constellations across the stratosphere.\nThe environmental impact of the tens of thousands of satellite launches and reentries is not fully understood, but early indications are that they could be significant enough to alter stratospheric temperatures and ozone coverage. A big portion of that impact comes from the discharge of metals, such as aluminum, lithium, and copper, into the atmosphere due to –\nOld satellites burning upon reentry into our atmosphere, with the projected five-year life of each satellite ensuring a heavy shower of metal particles steadily descending to Earth; Discharge of liquified natural gas fuel to power satellite launches and chemical propellants accelerants to reposition to avoid collisions; and Collisions, as armadas of satellites from different companies and countries reach orbit. As many as 150,000 near-collisions now occur each year, a number likely to multiply. “The sheer volume of atmospheric pollution from this satellite revolution is not on our national radar,” stated PEER Executive Director Tim Whitehouse, a former senior enforcement attorney with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, noting that control of atmospheric pollution is not even part of the licensing process. “The need for inter-agency and international cooperation in addressing these space impacts is becoming urgent, just as the U.S. has begun to retreat dramatically from climate science and global eco-coordination.”\nMusk’s Starlink and SpaceX are poised to benefit most from this expansion, with Starlink owning roughly three-quarters of satellites now in orbit and roughly half of slated launches via SpaceX rockets in the coming decade. In response to concerns raised by scientists, PEER has been trying to trace Musk’s actions through his Department of Government Efficiency on the federal agencies dealing with commercial space operations, principally NASA, NOAA, and the National Science Foundation. All three agencies are now slated for major cutbacks.\n“A huge and expanding chemistry experiment is taking place in our atmosphere while we fire the scientists needed to monitor it,” Whitehouse added. “Unfortunately, and unbelievably, the person best positioned to profit from lax satellite regulation has been put in charge of dismantling the oversight agencies and eliminating their scientific capacity.”\nReview NOAA’s projections for future satellite debris\nSee intense Musk/DOGE involvement with space-related offices\nLook at PEER’s request for records on cutbacks in stratospheric monitoring\nNASA FOIA\nNOAA FOIA\nNSF FOIA",

    "text": "Just under a tenth (9.5%) of software engineers do almost no work, according to new research from academics at Stanford University.\nOne researcher, Yegor Denisov-Blanch, posted the findings to his X account, dubbing the staff who work less than 10% as hard as the median engineer as ‘ghost’ engineers.\nThese engineers do “virtually nothing,” Denisov-Blanch said, and it’s possible that some may even have multiple jobs.\nThe report used data from more than 50,000 engineers at hundreds of different companies. According to the paper itself , the researchers collected this data specifically from private commercial repositories and public repositories.\nThe research was undertaken to help automate the code review process via the use of an algorithm developed by the researchers. It was inspired, in part, by the demand for efficient software development practices.\n“ Manual code reviews are an essential but time-consuming part of software development, often leading reviewers to prioritize technical issues while skipping valuable assessments,” the researchers said.\n“This paper presents an algorithmic model that automates aspects of code review typically avoided due to their complexity or subjectivity, such as assessing coding time, implementation time, and code complexity ,” they added.",

    "text": "breaking\nTransit union accepts recommendations aimed at preventing possible Metro Vancouver strike\n 1:36 pm.\nLast Updated February 1, 2024 2:09 pm.\nThere’s been a positive step in the ongoing labour dispute between CUPE 4500 Coast Mountain Bus Company, with the union announcing Thursday it has accepted recommendations aimed at ending the impasse.\nCUPE 4500, which represents about 180 transit supervisors with CMBC, says it has accepted the plan from special mediator Vince Ready, noting the recommendations “represent an acceptable compromise” for unionized workers. It is now urging CMBC to also accept the recommendations so further job action can be cancelled.\nAccording to the union, Ready’s plan “takes sufficient steps to addressing the key issues” of its members.\n“While they don’t completely address our issues, these recommendations are clearly our best path towards a mutually acceptable settlement. We are calling on Coast Mountain to accept them and avoid any further disruptions for transit users,” said Liam O’Neill, spokesperson for CUPE 4500.\nThe union was threatening to launch another shutdown of bus and SeaBus service as early as Saturday, if an agreement was not reached by 12:01 a.m. Feb. 3. This escalation would last 72 hours.\nCUPE 4500 says it still stands by this plan if both sides can’t come to a deal by that deadline.\n“We don’t see any reason to leave transit users in a state of uncertainty. We hope Coast Mountain will be quick in its deliberations and make its intentions clear,” said O’Neill. “For the sake of transit users, and the on-going relationship between CUPE 4500 members and Coast Mountain, let us put this dispute behind us.”\nThe looming escalation of strike action comes as a Labour Relations Board hearing continues, with the union seeking permission to also set up pickets at SkyTrain stations, TransLink facilities, and BC Transit sites in the\nFraser Valley and Victoria.\nIf the board agrees with CUPE 4500’s arguments, and if the union follows through with its threat, that could effectively shut down all transit services — including SkyTrain — in Metro Vancouver and the other regions.\nHowever, the transit authorities have been trying to have those additional sites designated as\nessential services, shielding them from being shut down by labour action.\nIn January, CUPE 4500’s transit supervisors began an overtime ban as a first step. Later in the month, on Jan. 22 at 3 a.m., the union launched new strike action, with bus and SeaBus service in Metro Vancouver grounding to a halt for 48 hours.\nOn Jan. 24, the province\nappointed Ready as a special mediator to help resolved the dispute between CUPE 4500 and CMBC. He had already been acting as a mediator before talks broke down between the two sides.",

    "text": "Tous les vols au départ et à l’arrivée de l’aéroport de Charleroi sont annulés ce vendredi : le personnel de BSCA poursuit la grève La réunion convoquée jeudi après-midi chez Cécile Neven, la ministre en charge des Aéroports wallons, s’est prolongée trop tardivement que pour relancer la machine sur le plan opérationnel. Le mouvement de grève se poursuit donc ce vendredi à l’aéroport de Charleroi. « Pour des raisons de sécurité et par manque d’effectifs, tous les vols au départ et à l’arrivée de l’aéroport de Charleroi sont annulés » précise Nathalie Piérard, Communication Manager de BSCA. Côté syndical, on parle d’une même voix : cette réunion, sous l’égide de la ministre, a été sereine et constructive. Et si elle a duré longtemps, elle a permis de poser clairement la situation. Particulièrement l’absence de dialogue avec la direction de BSCA, déclarent en substance les permanents syndicaux qui ont pris part à ce tour de table. Ce vendredi matin, direction et syndicats reprendront le dialogue. Une action spontanée pour les syndicats Jeudi matin, le personnel de BSCA avait débrayé de manière spontanée. « Une action sauvage non couverte par un préavis », avait dénoncé la direction de l’aéroport, qui a fait appel à la police et un huissier pour constater la situation de blocage. Pour les syndicats, il s’agit là d’un débrayage spontané du personnel, qui fait suit à un ras-le-bol généralisé. Il est question de saturation de l’outil, de pression sur les conditions de travail ou encore de l’arrogance de la direction. Tous font aussi chorus pour épingler l’ampleur de la mobilisation du personnel. « C’est une première fois. Et elle intervient sans aucun mot d’ordre des organisations syndicales », insistent Carl Yernaux (CNE), Michel Gretzer (CSC) et Alain Goelens (Setca) Les 186 vols programmés jeudi ont été annulés. La décision avait été partiellement anticipée par la direction de l’aéroport en concertation avec les compagnies aériennes. Au total, 30.000 passagers ont été impactés par cette action. Parmi eux, Alain Schumacker, qui aurait dû embarquer pour Alicante ce jeudi. « Ryanair nous laissait le choix entre prendre un ticket sur un autre vol, en l’occurrence celui de mercredi prochain alors que notre retour était programmé vendredi, ou alimenter un portefeuille pour de futures réservations. Nous avons finalement racheté un billet auprès de la compagnie Vueling, au départ de Bruxelles National. Soit un surcoût de 200 euros. Et deux jours de vacances en moins », regrette le Carolo. Les passagers qui devaient s’envoler ce vendredi depuis ou vers Charleroi seront contactés par leur compagnie aérienne. Pour tout renseignement concernant de nouvelles réservations ou demandes de remboursement, il leur est demandé de s’adresser à leur compagnie aérienne. Et ne pas se rendre à l’aéroport.

    "text": "Never trust someone who teaches swimming but’s afraid to get wet.\nReal advice comes from those who’ve drowned before—and now swim in their own capital.\nMost people giving you money advice… need money.\nAnd that changes everything.\nTV sells you gurus.\nLinkedIn sells you formulas.\nTikTok? Every intern thinks they’re a fund manager.\nBut real investors don’t sell courses.\nThey don’t have time—they’re busy compounding returns.\nWant to know if the advice is worth anything? Ask yourself:\nDoes this person depend on me—or anyone—to pay next month’s bills?\nIf yes, that “advice” is biased.\nIt’s marketing, not wisdom.\nThe real investor doesn’t operate to pay bills.\nHe operates to multiply a fortune that already bought him freedom.\nIt’s not arrogance. It’s a filter.\nIf you’re building—or defending—an empire, you need voices unshackled from the system, the paycheck, the ego.\nOnly take advice from someone you’d trade places with.\nThe truth is simple—just hard to swallow:\nThose who live off their own capital say little—but think clearly.",

    "text": "Los puertos egipcios se han convertido en importantes estaciones para los barcos que transportan mercancías para los israelíes hacia y desde la Palestina ocupada.\nUna investigación publicada este jueves por Arabi Post monitoreó la actividad de 19 barcos durante los últimos tres meses y rastreó sus rutas marítimas, utilizando datos marítimos de fuentes abiertas. El estudio encontró que estas embarcaciones se limitaban a viajar de ida y vuelta entre puertos israelíes y egipcios.\nSegún el informe, decenas de otros barcos también transportaban mercancías hacia y desde los territorios palestinos ocupados por Israel, pero no se limitaban a moverse entre los puertos israelíes y egipcios. También, durante el mismo periodo, ningún barco de otros países árabes llegó a puertos israelíes.\n“Los puertos egipcios son puntos vitales para el transporte de mercancías hacia y desde Israel debido a su proximidad a los puertos israelíes, especialmente el puerto de Ashdod, que está a unos 29 kilómetros de Gaza, así como el estratégico puerto de Haifa”, destacó el medio.\nSeñaló que la proximidad entre los puertos reduce los costos de envío que afectan los precios de las mercancías enviadas.\nEgipto advierte de “graves consecuencias” de ataque israelí a Rafah | HISPANTV La Cancillería de Egipto mediante un comunicado ha advertido sobre las graves consecuencias de una agresión militar israelí contra Rafah, en el sur de Gaza.\nLa investigación se basa en datos de la actividad de siete puertos, incluidos los israelíes de Ashdod y Haifa, y los egipcios de Port Said, Abu Qir, Alejandría, Dekheila y Damieta, situados en el mar Mediterráneo.\nEl grupo de 19 buques incluían siete portacontenedores, seis transportadores de cemento, cinco buques de carga general y un granelero que transporta carga a granel como granos, azúcar y carbón.\nFuerzas yemeníes atacan dos barcos vinculados al régimen de Israel También, la pesquisa reveló que estos barcos navegaron bajo la bandera de Panamá, Liberia, Israel, Egipto, Antigua y Barbuda, Singapur y San Cristóbal y Nieves.\nConforme a los datos de seguimiento de barcos de Vesselfinder, 12 de estos barcos son propiedad de empresas de Egipto, Israel, Turquía, Grecia, Singapur, Alemania y Chipre.\nAumento de intercambios entre Egipto e Israel Igualmente, Arabia Post informó que los seis transportistas de cemento no visitaron con frecuencia los puertos egipcios en 2022 y 2023, sino que sus viajes se centraron en Israel y Egipto durante la guerra en Gaza.\nDesde el pasado octubre y con el estallido de la guerra genocida israelí contra los palestinos en Gaza, el comercio entre Israel y Egipto ha aumentado.\nEgipto califica de “línea roja” el desplazamiento de palestinos Arabi Post citó datos que indican que las exportaciones de Egipto a Israel entre octubre de 2023 y el 31 de julio de 2024 alcanzaron los 170,1 millones de dólares, mientras que las exportaciones durante el mismo período en 2022 y 2023 ascendieron a 162,8 millones de dólares.\nLas importaciones de Egipto desde Israel después de la guerra casi se triplicaron. Entre octubre de 2023 y julio de 2024, las importaciones de Egipto desde Israel ascendieron a 331,6 millones de dólares, mientras que las importaciones durante los mismos meses de 2022 y 2023 ascendieron a 106,8 millones de dólares.\n msr/ncl/hnb",
