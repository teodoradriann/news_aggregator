    "text": "In what was the first top-flight meeting between the sides since January 1983, Ipswich were looking to build on their recent victory over Chelsea and draw away at Fulham against a Seagulls side who had drawn their last four PL matches.\nAnd although the visitors saw more of the ball in the first half, it was the Tractor Boys who had the better opportunities.\nWales international Nathan Broadhead was the first to test goalkeeper Mark Verbruggen with 23 minutes on the clock when his effort, which was heading for the right-hand corner, was pushed away by the Dutchman.\nKieran McKenna’s side had the full backing of the capacity crowd at Portman Road, and they visibly grew in confidence as the half wore on.\nAs they continued to threaten, Brighton had Verbruggen to thank again two minutes before the interval as he showed impressive agility to get across and push Omari Hutchinson’s goalbound effort from 25 yards away to safety.\nIt appeared that the momentum was with the home side as the second half got under way, however it was the Seagulls who went ahead with the first real opportunity a minute before the hour mark.\nHaving broken free down the right, Yasin Ayari squared to Matt O’Riley who laid it off to Kaoru Mitoma, and the Japanese international’s first-time shot beat Christian Walton following a slight deflection off Leif Davis to make it 1-0.\nIt could have been 2-0 less than 10 minutes later when Joao Pedro cushioned a ball into the area and shot on the turn, only to be denied by a fantastic reaction save from Walton.\nTo Brighton’s credit, they were far superior in the second half, and they doubled their advantage with eight minutes remaining when substitute Georginio Rutter showed great awareness to swivel and shoot a loose ball on the turn into the left corner to secure a hard-earned victory which lifts them two places to ninth.\nDespite another battling display, Ipswich tasted their 11th defeat of the season and remain in the drop zone by virtue of goals scored.\nFlashscore Man of the Match: Carlos Baleba (Brighton and Hove Albion)",

    "text": "WEST PALM BEACH — Federal prosecutors say the wife and brother-in-law of a high-ranking member of Palm Beach County law enforcement defrauded Medicare out of more than $9 million . If convicted, they could spend up to 55 years in federal prison. Ted Albin and Erin Foley, South Florida twins and owners of a medical billing company, are accused of conspiring with clients to bill insurers for medical equipment their patients didn't need. In addition to the multimillion dollar payout from insurers, investigators say the twins earned kickbacks for helping others commit fraud, too. Foley's husband, Randy Foley, leads the Behavioral Services Division at the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office . He was not named in the 14-page indictment and has not been charged with a crime. His wife and brother-and-law were indicted in December after investigators identified the siblings' West Palm Beach company, Grapevine Professional Services Inc., as one of several across the country believed to have exploited the federal insurance program. “Medicare is a valuable taxpayer-funded program, designed to provide affordable health care to people over 65 or with disabilities,” said U.S. Attorney Damian Williams in the wake of their arrest. “Not to line the pockets of those who would enrich themselves through fraud.\" ' Spine crime': Patients say Lake Worth-area back doctor did 'fake surgeries,' left them in pain Investigators say a network of medical equipment companies provided the twins with sham prescriptions for durable medical equipment, or DME, between 2018 and 2021. DME includes braces, wheelchairs, oxygen equipment and other medical supplies. The indictment does not name the people who wrote the bogus prescriptions but said Albin and Foley knew of their illegitimate origins and used them to bill insurance companies anyway. The twins owned several medical equipment companies themselves and are accused of funneling their own illegally purchased prescriptions into Grapevine's mix as well. Investigators believe the pair also charged a fee to connect associates who wanted in on the scam with people willing to sign off on the phony prescriptions. Foley, 46, of Loxahatchee and Albin, 46, of Stuart were charged in the Southern District of New York with conspiring to commit, and actually committing, health care fraud and wire fraud, as well as conspiring to violate the Anti-Kickback Statute. Foley's court-appointed defense attorney, Jeffrey Pittell, declined to comment on the allegations Thursday. Albin's attorney, Sean Maher, did not immediately return requests for comment. Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office spokesperson Teri Barbera said Capt. Randy Foley is a \"highly respected member of PBSO and is not implicated in these yet-to-be proven allegations.\" She declined to comment further.

    "text": "Comunidades de Veracruz iniciaron acciones legales por la contaminación fecal de los ríos en la cuenca de La Antigua y, el pasado 8 de abril, lograron que el Juzgado Decimoquinto de Distrito en Veracruz concediera una suspensión provisional a un amparo para obligar a los ayuntamientos a sanear los afluentes.\nEn conferencia de prensa, los ambientalistas indicaron que dicha situación representa un gran logro en la lucha para la defensa del agua, el territorio y las comunidades, ya que los afluentes enfrentan una crisis socioambiental debido a la contaminación por aguas residuales no tratadas.\nXavier Martínez Esponda, co-coordinador en Territorios Diversos para la Vida (Terravida), dio a conocer que en coordinación con la Asamblea del Agua de los Pueblos Unidos de la Cuenca Antigua por los Ríos Libres y Limpios (Pucarl) el 24 de marzo de 2025 presentaron una demanda de amparo ante los tribunales federales, en contra de las autoridades de los tres niveles de gobierno por la contaminación de los cuerpos de agua.\nEn 2023, la asamblea de Pucarl creó una comisión de monitoreo comunitario del agua, que realizó inspecciones de 13 sitios en los municipios de Xico, Teocelo, Tlalnelhuayocan, Xalapa, Coatepec, Jalcomulco, Coetzala y Apazapan, entre diciembre de 2023 y abril de 2024.\nLos resultados arrojaron que el 100 por ciento de los sitios muestreados presentan niveles de E. coli, es decir, bacterias fecales por encima de los límites permitidos para el contacto humano y la vida que habita en ellos. Esto en respuesta a la grave contaminación fecal que afecta a los ríos y humedales de la cuenca Antigua, ubicada en la región central del estado de Veracruz, lo que representa un peligro para las poblaciones.\nExplicaron que la demanda de amparo es un recurso legal para defender los derechos humanos frente a las acciones u omisiones de las autoridades responsables.\nEn esta demanda los habitantes de la cuenca exigen la adopción de medidas para detener la contaminación fecal en los cuerpos de agua de la región y, al mismo tiempo, solicitan se reconozcan los derechos del río.\nLa Asamblea del Agua de los Pueblos Unidos de la Cuenca La Antigua por los Ríos Libres y Limpios hizo un llamado enérgico para fortalecer la defensa de los ríos y humedales de la región.\nA las autoridades les pidieron implementar medidas inmediatas para la restauración de la calidad del agua en los ríos y humedales, garantizando el cumplimiento de las normativas en materia de saneamiento y protección al ambiente.\nA la jueza del Juzgado Decimoquinto de Distrito de Veracruz le solicitaron conceder la suspensión definitiva para salvaguardar los proyectos de vida de las comunidades que dependen de la calidad del agua de sus rios.\n“A las comunidades y organizaciones: Respaldar el proceso de amparo en curso, que busca asegurar el derecho al agua limpia, la protección del ambiente y el reconocimiento de los derechos de los ríos. Es crucial fortalecer una respuesta colectiva ante la crisis ambiental que afecta a toda la región. A la sociedad: Sensibilizar sobre la crisis ambiental que enfrenta la Cuenca La Antigua y su impacto en la vida cotidiana. Apoyar las acciones legales y comunitarias para proteger los ríos, reconocer sus derechos y asegurar un futuro sostenible para las generaciones venideras”, enfatizaron.",

    "text": "- By [Prerna Targhotra](/authors/prerna-targhotra) - Published: Fri, 29 Mar 2024 08:39 AM (IST) - Source:JND Good Friday 2024: The occasion of Good Friday is an important observance in the Christian community. It is observed before Easter Sunday and after Maundy Thursday and this year is being celebrated on March 29. The Good Friday week is extremely important and includes special days such as Palm Sunday, Holy Monday, Holy Tuesday, Holy Wednesday, Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, Holy Saturday and Easter. Usually, the date of Good Friday and Easter celebrations depends on the lunar cycle and the timing of the Jewish festival of Passover, which is rooted in the Biblical account of Jesus’s crucifixion and resurrection. Good Friday signifies the victory of good over evil as Christians believe that with his death, Jesus Christ took all the sins of the world. Usually, people think that Good Friday is a celebratory day because of ‘Good’ in it, but according to the beliefs, it is a mourning day and is also known as ‘Black Friday’ or ‘Resurrection Day.’ On Good Friday, people indulge in reading the holy Bible and connecting with God, Jesus Christ. Here are some beautiful Bible verses that you can read on this day and include joy and spirituality in your life. Good Friday Bible Verses 1 Peter 2:24 He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. By his wounds you have been healed. John 3:16-17 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. Mark 9:31 For he was teaching his disciples, saying to them, “The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill him. And when he is killed, after three days he will rise. Isaiah 53:5 But he was pierced for our transgressions; he was crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace, and with his wounds, we are healed. Mark 10:34 And they will mock him and spit on him, and flog him and kill him. And after three days he will rise. Romans 5:6-10 For while we were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly. For one will scarcely die for a righteous person—though perhaps for a good person, one would dare even to die— but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Since, therefore, we have now been justified by his blood, much more shall we be saved by him from the wrath of God. For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, now that we are reconciled, shall we be saved by his life. Mark 8:31 And he began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed, and after three days rise again. Matthew 12:40 For just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. John 19:30 When Jesus had received the sour wine, he said, “It is finished,” and he bowed his head and gave up his spirit. Matthew 17:22-23 When they came together in Galilee, he said to them, 'The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men. They will kill him, and on the third day he will be raised to life.' And the disciples were filled with grief. Matthew 26:2 As you know, the Passover is two days away - and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified. Matthew 26:12 When she poured this perfume on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial. Matthew 26:24 The son of man will go just as it is written about him. Matthew 26:39 Going a little farther, he fell with his face to the ground and prayed, 'My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will.

El ataque, que tuvo lugar el miércoles por la noche, ha sido condenado por el gobernador en funciones de Níger, Yajubu Garba, quien ha descrito los hechos como \\\"satánicos, insensibles y atroces\\\". \\\"Es muy desalentador y perturbador que otros seres humanos lleven a cabo un acto tan bárbaro y cruel\\\", reza un comunicado. El gobernador ha reafirmado \\\"la determinación y compromiso inquebrantables\\\" de \\\"controlar la ola de inseguridad en el Estado\\\", mientras que ha alentado a las fuerzas de seguridad a \\\"no desanimarse por los ataques a las comunidades\\\", asegurándoles \\\"todo el apoyo\\\". El noreste de Nigeria es el epicentro de las actividades de Boko Haram y su escisión, Estado Islámico en África Occidental (ISWA), si bien la inseguridad se ha extendido a otras zonas del centro, el norte y el noroeste, haciendo saltar las alarmas sobre la posible expansión de estas redes terroristas y criminales.",

    "text": "“Shows that passion for your community can really make a difference.”\nLeanne Hamilton made this comment after successfully petitioning Sicamous council to revisit the zoning amendment of Bylaw 1044 required to start work on the Shuswap North Okanagan Rail Trail. The effort led to Mayor Colleen Anderson calling for a re-vote at the Feb. 28 council meeting.\nIn her presentation, which received a standing ovation from the approximately 35 people in the gallery, Hamilton stressed the district has to “take advantage of this now.” Since the Feb. 14 4-3 split vote on the rezoning, Hamilton has collected over 700 signatures in person and more than 6oo online, requesting that council reconsider its decision.\n“Councillors have stated that they want the rail trail to happen, but are wanting to pause it. Has council considered what this pause could mean financially?” Hamilton asked. “Will it cost Sicamous more money… and at whose cost, the taxpayers? We can’t keep stalling this project for a small part of the community.\n“Our community does not want another unfinished project in our town,” she added.\nWhile the trail is jointly owned by the Columbia Shuswap Regional District (CSRD), Regional District of the North Okanagan and Splatsin, the starting point is in Sicamous. Council needs to approve rezoning of the district’s portion of trail, from R-1 Residential to P-3 Park, so that work can begin on it. Elsewhere in the CSRD, that work is expected to begin this spring.\nUnder the Community Charter, the mayor can direct council to vote on it again on the matter, which Anderson did.\n“In light of what I’m hearing from the community, and information that we heard from the CSRD earlier today at the COW [Committee of the Whole] I’ll be exercising my authority under section 131 of the Community Charter for council to reconsider third reading of Bylaw 1044 as soon as convenient,” Anderson said to a round of applause.\nShe noted that at the Feb. 14 public hearing, there was a lack of representation from the Economic Development Committee, Sicamous & District Chamber of Commerce and the business community, adding “there was a miss there.”\nChief administrative officer Kelly Bennett said that as this requires another public hearing, it won’t come back to the next council meeting, but council can discuss where and when that will happen.\nDespite Hamilton’s success in getting the zoning reconsideration, she admitted that she “didn’t see that coming.”\n“I am absolutely amazed by all of the support, not only from the residents of Sicamous, but the many others that signed the petition. Thank you Mayor Colleen Anderson for listening to the people!” she said, adding that the petition will remain open until the public hearing, and encouraged people to attend that. “Together we can make this happen.”\nRead more:\nCSRD announces spring start to rail trail construction, but not in Sicamous\nRead more:\n Petition protests Sicamous council decision holding up work on rail trail",

Los agentes, fueron requeridos por el sacristán de la iglesia, que se había percatado de la sustracción de diversos objetos religiosos y de instrumentos musicales.\nEntre los objetos robados, había un crucifijo, una cruz metálica dorada, medallas con la imagen de la Virgen y una esfera dorada.\nTodos los elementos han podido ser recuperados y entregados de nuevo a la iglesia parroquial, que está ubicada en la Plaza Reyes Católicos.\nEl sacristán comentó a los agentes de la Policía Local ilicitana que había visto merodear por delante de la sacristía, a un hombre a quien no conocía de nada, dándose cuenta poco después, de que la cerradura de la puerta de la sacristía había sido forzada.\nTras tener conocimiento de los hechos, se hizo cargo de la investigación la unidad especializada en robos de la Comisaría del Cuerpo Nacional de la Policía de Elche cuyos efectivos, tras analizar las imágenes de las cámaras de seguridad del lugar, pudieron identificar plenamente al autor de los hechos.\nTras ello, se activó un dispositivo de búsqueda de esa persona que culminó con su detención y recuperación de una caja de color rojo que contenía los objetos religiosos sustraídos.\nEl arrestado, que tiene un amplio historial de antecedentes por delitos similares, ha ingresado en prisión por orden judicial.",
