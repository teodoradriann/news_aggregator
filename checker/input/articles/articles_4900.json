    "text": "La Semana Santa es un período de reflexión espiritual que inicia el domingo 24 de marzo y culmina el domingo 31 del mismo mes, y es una festividad cristiana en donde se conmemora el sacrificio de Jesucristo en la cruz y su paso por la tierra, incluyendo su pasión, muerte y resurrección. Durante estos días, los religiosos dedican tiempo a visitar las iglesias y a congregarse, reconectando así con su fe. Sin embargo, muchos también aprovechan este momento para tomar vacaciones y participar en actividades recreativas que les permitan despejar sus mentes de la rutina diaria. Recomendados Municipios batallan por operar balnearios Desnivelada la balanza para la pesca local ¿Por qué la gente niega el cambio climático? Esta festividad se caracteriza por la presencia de diversos símbolos que representan la vida, pasión, muerte y resurrección del Salvador. Entre estos símbolos se incluyen los ramos, las palmas, el pan, el vino, la cruz y el lavatorio de pies. No obstante, hay uno en particular cuyo significado a menudo pasa desapercibido. ¿Por qué se debe tener un clavel en Semana Santa? Estas plantas herbáceas, conocidas con el nombre científico Dianthus Caryophyllus, se encuentran disponibles en una variedad de colores y llevan consigo el significado de “flores de los dioses” o “flor de agua”. Tener claveles rojos en el hogar no solo se relaciona con el simbolismo religioso, sino también con las prácticas del Feng Shui. Más allá de embellecer el ambiente del hogar, los claveles rojos representan la pasión y el sacrificio de Jesucristo en la cruz, evocando el derramamiento de sangre que tuvo lugar hace siglos en Judea, específicamente entre los años 30 y 33 d.C. Además de su belleza visual, la fragancia de los claveles simboliza la pureza y la devoción espiritual, aspectos centrales durante esta semana de reflexión. Por otro lado, los claveles blancos se asocian con la Virgen María, madre de Jesús, según la creencia católica. Existe una leyenda que sugiere que durante la crucifixión de Jesús, algunos claveles brotaron donde cayeron sus lágrimas. Considerando las creencias religiosas y la filosofía del Feng Shui, los claveles tienen la capacidad de atraer energía positiva y paz. Además, están relacionados con sentimientos como el amor, la admiración, el respeto y la sinceridad, valores fundamentales que deben destacarse durante la Semana Santa.",

    "text": "Allan Souza Lima , de 39 anos de idade, relembrou a depressão e o burnout que lidou enquanto gravava a segunda temporada de Cangaço Novo , série do Prime Video. O ator, que recentemente lidou com um aborto espontâneo de um filho e o fim do relacionamento com Rafa Kalimann , contou em entrevista ao Sem Censura que se identificou tanto com o personagem Ubaldo, que entrou em colapso.\nContinuar lendo \"Esse personagem sou eu. A segunda temporada foi muito dolorida. Eu fui afundando. Tinha dias, que silenciosamente, eu acordava chorando de dor e solidão. Sabia da minha responsabilidade, levantava e ia. Botava os óculos escuros e fingia que nada acontecia. Até o dia que eu caí e tive que pedir ajuda. Vivi situações no meio disso tudo que foram muito complicadas. É muito difícil quando as pessoas te olham, sabem que você caiu e você fala: 'Eu tô pelado e sem a armadura, não tenho como me proteger agora'. Isso, para mim, foi de muita dor. As pessoas preocupadas\", relembrou ele, que exaltou o apoio que recebeu do elenco e equipe da série.",

    "text": "By Jovita Trujillo - Los Angeles December 28, 2023 5:18 PM EST Gypsy Rose Blanchard is officially out of prison and has become a true crime sensation. The 32-year-old woman gained public attention in 2015 when she and her then-boyfriend, Nicholas Godejohn , murdered her mother, Dee Dee Blanchard.\n©ABC 20/20 Dee Dee had Factitious disorder, formerly known as Munchausen syndrome, which is a serious mental disorder where someone deceives others by appearing sick, by purposely getting sick, or by self-injury. It can also happen when family members or caregivers falsely present others, such as children, as being ill, injured, or impaired, per Mayo Clinic.\nDee Dee had been falsely claiming that Gypsy Rose had health issues and was terminally ill, leading to unnecessary and painful medical treatments and interventions. She was wheelchair-bound and subjected to things like feeding tubes.\nGypsy Rose pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. She was granted parole earlier this year after only seven.\nGypsy Rose’s first hours after prison Gypsy Rose was picked up from Chillicothe Correctional Center in Chillicothe by her husband, Ryan Scott Anderson, around 3:30 a.m. local time, the Missouri Department of Corrections confirmed to multiple outlets.\nAnderson emailed her in 2020 after watching the documentary Mommy Dead and Dearest and the hit series, The Act. They were married on July 21, 2022, in a small prison ceremony with no guests.\nMORE: Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen unite in the face of a heartbreaking family loss\nKamar de los Reyes passes away at 56: Who was the Puerto Rican actor?\nNick Carter’s family tragedy: The devastating deaths of almost all his siblings\nTMZ published photos of Anderson with a cameraman, as she has an upcoming Lifetime Doc. Per DailyMail, he drove her to her first night of freedom at a budget hotel in a Cadillac.\nOn Thursday Morning, photographers spotted Blanchard and Anderson leaving her hotel room. In photos published by ET , Blanchard was rolling out her luggage and bags of food.\nAnderson is a middle school teacher from Louisiana, and they told PEOPLE , they have plans to move there, which is where they could be headed.\nAs for what next for Gypsy Rose, we know there is a documentary on the way, and she wants to redo her wedding one day, telling the outlet, “with all of our family and our friends and the dress and the cake and everything because we deserve that. I deserve that. He deserves that,”\nShe also wants to be a mother, and have a family, “I have learned what not to do,” she told PEOPLE.\nRelated Video: Demi Lovato Is Engaged to Jordan ‘Jutes’ Lutes Loading the player...

Fortunately, there are plenty of incredible barbecue restaurants found all around the country that offer everyone the chance to dine on classic dishes.\nAccording to a list compiled by LoveFood , the \"best barbecue restaurant\" in all of South Carolina is Lewis Barbecue. This popular eatery serves Texas barbecue that is worth sampling alongside its Carolina-style counterpart. Lewis Barbecue has locations in Charleston and Greenville. Find out more by visiting the restaurant's website .\nHere's what the site had to say about the best \"unmissable\" barbecue in the state:\n\"At this popular joint, Texas barbecue is taken seriously. Meat is prepared in a custom-made smoker built by the pitmaster, and many people say the brisket is the best they've ever had. You order at the counter; choose your meat (brisket, pulled pork, turkey breast, house-made sausages, or ribs) by weight, then add on sides like smoky pinto beans, green chili born pudding, and tangy coleslaw. Kick back in the huge outdoor area and enjoy.\" See the full list at lovefood.com to read up on more of the tastiest barbecue joints around the country. In the mood for something sweet?
