    "text": "Sam Mikulak Finally Has His Medal\nI have never been so happy to have a blog of mine age so poorly.\nA couple of days ago I wrote about Sam Mikulak, the top male gymnast in the U.S. who has struggled in major international competition. Mikulak, a five-time U.S. national champion, had yet to earn a world or Olympic medal. He had been to two Olympics Games and three world championships. (This year’s worlds were his fourth.) You couldn’t help but wonder if it would ever happen for him.\nMikulak, 26, had two especially heartbreaking finishes in the all-around at the world championships. The first one came in 2013 when he was in second place heading to the final event: high bar. He faltered there and slid to sixth in the rankings. Mikulak did the same thing again a few days ago during the all-around final at the 2018 world championships. He was in third place heading into the last rotation and missed his grip on high bar, and slipped from a podium position to fifth.\nNot to mention a whole bunch of almosts: fourth at the 2013 worlds on high bar, fourth at the Olympic Games on high bar, fourth in yesterday’s pommel horse final, and fourth in today’s parallel bars finals.\nOnce again, it all came down to high bar for Mikulak, the last event of the 2018 world championships. He qualified into the final in second place, behind Japan’s Kohei Uchimura, and ahead of 2012 Olympic high bar champion Epke Zonderland, who qualified in fourth. With the exception of his mistake in the all-around final, Mikulak hadn’t missed a routine on that event. During the team final, he posted the highest high bar score to help the U.S. men to a fourth-place finish.\nHe competed third in the lineup, right after a stellar routine from Zonderland, who won the silver last year after he caught his Kovacs—a tucked double back over the bar— with just one hand and managed to keep the routine going without losing his rhythm.\nThis year was more successful for Zonderland, who caught all of his releases with both hands and stuck his dismount.\nNext up was Mikulak, who caught everything, including the release move that dashed his all-around hopes a few days. He landed his double twisting double layout with just a small hop forward to go into second place behind Zonderland with five gymnasts remaining.\nOnly Uchimura would end up bumping Mikulak further down with his absolutely stellar high bar work. The Japanese legend took second place, pushing Mikulak down to third, which is where he remained until the end of the competition. Mikulak finally had his medal, a bronze on his best event.\nAnd he seemed particularly thrilled when he came out to collect it during the medal ceremony.\nIn the post-meet interview, however, he mostly seemed relieved. He had finally done what he had been trying to do for years. He would no longer be the guy who had all the talent and ability, but none of the international accolades to show for it.\n“It’s been a big weight off my chest,” he said.\nThe U.S. men’s program likely feels the same way. Mikulak’s medal means that the men will not go home empty-handed this year.",

    "text": "Eating disorders among college students increased 13% from 2013 to 2021-22, according to a 2022 study published by Science Direct. As cases of this complex issue rise, UCF Health’s Student Health Services (SHS) and Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) reminds the campus community the university is here to help those in need.\nEating Disorder Awareness Week is Feb. 24-March 2.\nMultidisciplinary treatment is the standard of care for eating disorders, says Caiti Bradbury, a licensed mental health counselor with CAPS. To provide this support, UCF has an Eating Disorder Management Team (EDMT), which includes professionals like Bradbury, as well as medical providers, dietitians, therapists, psychiatrists and, sometimes, substance abuse clinician from SHS and CAPS.\nSHS, CAPS and the EDMT aim to empower students to seek education, support and treatment as they are comfortable and ready to do so.\n“Any treatment advice we provide is always a recommendation, not a requirement. If you decide after that meeting that you aren’t quite ready to pursue treatment, you’ll have acquired some knowledge of how to get started when you are ready,” says Rebecca Kuerbitz, a primary care provider with SHS and EDMT member.\nHere Bradbury and Kuerbitz share insight on eating disorders and how students can get help.\nWhat are some common eating disorders and their symptoms?\nRebecca Kuerbitz (RK): Eating disorders are defined as a persistent disturbance of eating behavior that impairs health or psychosocial functioning. The most common are binge eating disorder, bulimia nervosa, anorexia nervosa, avoidant/restrictive foot intake disorder and disordered eating that doesn’t fit into other categories. Binge eating disorder is characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating in which the person eats a large amount of food in a short period of time accompanied by feeling a loss of control overeating with some distress (like disgust, guilt or depression) after the binge.\nBulimia nervosa, like binge eating disorder, involves recurrent episodes of binging but binging is followed by a compensatory behavior such as purging, excessive exercise or misuse of medications like insulin. Compensatory behaviors are typically influenced by a person’s concern about their body shape and weight.\nAnorexia nervosa is an eating disorder that is characterized by restriction of caloric intake that leads to a low body weight. It is accompanied by an intense fear of gaining weight and distorted perception of body shape.\nAvoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) is a more recently recognized eating disorder that involves food restriction and/or avoidance due to anxiety about certain foods. This leads to low body weight and nutritional deficiency but is not due to fear of weight gain or distorted perception of body shape or weight. Often people with ARFID will have only a few different foods that are comfortable eating.\nHow prevalent are eating disorders? Are some types of eating disorders more common than others?\nRK: There is a lifetime prevalence of eating disorder of 8% in females and 2% in males.\nCaiti Bradbury (CB): The most common diagnoses are anorexia, bulimia and binge eating disorder among college students. ARFID, although less common, has become increasingly prevalent in recent years.\nWhat are some common misconceptions about eating disorders?\nCB: One major myth is that eating disorders are simply about food, when, in reality, they stem from deeper emotional and psychological issues, such as control, self-esteem and past trauma. Another misconception is that only women are affected but eating disorders impact people of all genders. It’s also not true that everyone with an eating disorder is underweight — disorders like bulimia and binge eating can occur in people of all body sizes. Some believe eating disorders are a choice or a temporary fad or are solely about appearance, but they are serious mental health conditions that require professional treatment and can be lethal. The idea that those with eating disorders are seeking attention is also false; most individuals hide their symptoms due to shame and guilt. Furthermore, recovery isn’t simply about gaining or losing weight, as eating disorders are long-term conditions requiring ongoing treatment, even after physical health improves. Many also think eating disorders are rare, but they affect millions of people across all demographics. Finally, while media and societal pressure can contribute, eating disorders are influenced by a combination of genetic, psychological and environmental factors.\nWhat should students who are seeking help with eating disorders expect from the treatment process here at UCF?\nRK: They can expect compassionate care from therapists at CAPS, nutritional guidance from our registered dietitian, medical care to address any health concerns by one of our primary care providers and psychiatric care from our Behavioral Health providers, if needed.\nWhat advice would you give to students who are hesitant to seek help for an eating disorder, or for family and friends who want to support someone in need?\nCB: To family and friends, I’d say don’t be judgmental and avoid comments or criticisms about one’s physical appearance and eating habits. For those in need, there is no shame in seeking help. You deserve to have a life you can feel proud of and enjoy without feeling consumed by thoughts of food or body image.\nStudents who are struggling with eating disorders are encouraged to set up an appointment at SHS or CAPS. Join SHS and CAPS for UCF Loves EveryBODY, a celebration of self-love with photo booths, ask a dietitian and FreshU, and more, Feb. 26 at Ferrell Commons 10 a.m.-noon.",

    "title": "Trading Guru Uncovers This Notable Pattern On Solana: What’s Next For SOL Investors?",
    "text": "Trader and market analyst Peter Brandt has provided valuable perspectives on the recent price movement of Solana (SOL), suggesting the completion of a notable chart pattern. In particular, Brandt has noted a descending triangle pattern forming on Solana’s 4-hour price chart. Related Reading: Paradigm Drives $225M Funding Round For Monad Labs, Blockchain Rival To Ethereum, Solana Identified Chart Pattern On SOL And Its Implications The descending triangle pattern identified by lower highs and a horizontal support line is often interpreted in technical analysis as a signal of a potential downtrend continuation. Brandt’s recent post highlighted the completion of this pattern, drawing attention to a crucial development for SOL traders. Brandt’s analysis extends beyond the mere identification of the pattern. He underscores the significance of pattern validation over its completion. According to Brandt, a pattern’s failure to fulfill its expected role carries more weight than its mere completion. With the descending triangle pattern now confirmed for SOL, market participants’ anticipation is palpable as they await potential price movements, whether to the upside or downside. A descending triangle has been completed in $SOL I am only the messenger, not the message Remember, a pattern failure (to do what it is supposed to do under classical rules) is more important than a pattern completion pic.twitter.com/ezershgA5A — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) April 10, 2024 Solana Network Challenges Amidst Price Fluctuations While Solana’s price performance has fluctuated over the past week, recent network challenges have added another layer of complexity to the asset’s situation. Despite a 12.7% decline in SOL’s value over the past week, there has been a slight uptick of 4% in the last 24 hours. However, ongoing network congestion has presented obstacles. Solana developers are actively addressing these issues, with efforts underway to resolve network congestion experienced on April 15. Mert Mumtaz, CEO of Helius Labs, a key contributor to Solana’s maintenance and enhancement, clarified that the current network challenges stem from implementing a specific protocol rather than an inherent design flaw in Solana. solana’s current issue is not a design flaw, it’s an implementation bug it is now hitting me that some folks might not understand what we’ve been trying to say by this for the past week I’ll simplify it (intended for non-technical people) it is important to make this… pic.twitter.com/fNZzu9f90S — mert | helius.dev (@0xMert_) April 8, 2024 Meanwhile, Solana’s open interest in the futures sector, a metric used in derivatives markets referring to the total number of outstanding contracts, has experienced fluctuations in recent times. While it saw steady growth from January to April, reaching an all-time high of $2.86 billion on April 1, recent network issues have led to a decline. Coinglass data indicates that Solana’s open interest has fallen to $2.4 billion since April 11, reflecting a 5% decline in just over a week. Featured image from Unsplash, Chart from TradingView",
