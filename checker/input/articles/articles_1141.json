    "text": "Geneva Humdy was retired and living in Costa Rica when a tour guide and friend scheduled a 5,000-foot hike up to a dramatic vista: an overlook of the Continental Divide where the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea can be seen. Humdy was 66 and recently retired from her career as a professional fundraiser. She was still fit enough to run 12 miles, so she didn't think twice about the climb. On the way back down, she started feeling lightheaded and off-kilter. By the time she was back at her hotel, she was feeling even worse. She suspected something was very wrong with her health. She decided to seek medical help, which was complicated by the fact that it was September 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic had severely stressed the medical system. She went to a health clinic, where a doctor checked her blood pressure. It was alarmingly high. She was driven in an ambulance for five hours to a private hospital in San Jose. There, she received medication to control her blood pressure and was told to see a specialist as soon as she could. That was tough, too. Because of pandemic restrictions, she had to stay in Costa Rica for two months until she could see a cardiologist in Florida. While she waited, she could barely walk around her apartment. By the time she made the trip, she was traveling in a wheelchair. She told her doctor, \"This is a humbling experience for someone who's used to running every day.\" The doctor diagnosed Humdy with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, a congenital heart condition that causes the heart to beat abnormally fast. The doctor explained her treatment options and told her to take some time to think about what she wanted to do. \"I told him I didn't need any time to think about it,\" she said. \"I knew I wanted to get the procedure done and get back to my life, and running.\" The diagnosis seemed to clear up a lingering health mystery. Years before, she'd had several episodes of a racing heartbeat and shortness of breath. Her cardiologist at the time never determined the cause; he didn't offer any treatment or express much concern. After the scare, she became more careful about her diet. She underwent a procedure called an ablation, which essentially burned away the spots that triggered her racing heart. It went well. So did her recovery. But, 15 months after her diagnosis, she was back at the hospital with a new health issue. \"My heart started shaking like a bowl of Jell-O,\" she said. In March 2022, Humdy was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, or AFib, another type of abnormal heartbeat. She had a second ablation and settled into another period of recovery to let her heart heal. She couldn't run, but had faith she'd be back – and she spent a lot of her downtime thinking about when she could lace up her shoes again. She would close her eyes and imagine her ideal 70th birthday. \"I always knew I wanted to run another half-marathon for my 70th birthday,\" she said. \"I told my cardiologist I would do anything he told me if I could run it.\" In June, her cardiologist granted her wish and told her she could start training again. She slowly built her miles back up. She registered for her 13.1-mile birthday party. \"Life can be rough and difficult, but running helps me work out so many things and it changes my mood,\" Humdy said. \"Running makes me feel good and I feel grateful every day that I'm healthy and able to run again.\" Her strong return is no surprise to Adrian Clough, her friend and longtime training partner. Clough has seen Humdy run through every kind of weather. And when they finished a run, Humdy would sometimes keep going for a few more miles. \"She's always been so active and driven, I knew she wasn't going to let anything stop her from running again,\" Clough said. \"If she says she's going to do something, you can bet your bottom dollar that that's what she's going to do.\" Humdy, who now lives in Roanoke, Virginia, will head to Hawaii in March to celebrate her 70th birthday at the Ku'ikahi Half Marathon. She'll also use the race to raise money for the American Heart Association in hopes of helping other people detect and manage heart conditions. \"This run is more than just a personal milestone,\" said Humdy, who has run five previous half-marathons. \"I'm grateful for those who saved my life.\" She credits her cardiologists, surgeons, friends and family. \"Without all of them, I'm not sure if I would have survived and returned to the life of adventure that inspires me.\" Stories From the Heart chronicles the inspiring journeys of heart disease and stroke survivors, caregivers and advocates.

    "text": "TAMIU Live Presentation: “Aurora Borealis at its Peak During Solar Maximum 2025\" Friday, Feb. 28\nThe Northern Lights are at their 11-year peak during Solar Maximum 2025, as solar explosions interact with Earth’s magnetic field.\nJoin Texas A&M International University (TAMIU) Lamar Bruni Vergara Planetarium Director Peter Davis, an expert in the Aurora Borealis, for a live presentation explaining the science behind these stunning displays on Friday, February 28, at 6:30 p.m. at the Planetarium.\nThe discounted admission for this live presentation will be $5 for general admission, as well as University faculty, staff, students and alumni, $5 for seniors 65 years and older, and $4 for children, ages 3-12. Tickets can be purchased in-person at the Planetarium’s box office.\nThe first 25 people attending this event will receive a free, glossy photo bookmark of the Northern Lights over the Mendenhall Glacier near Juneau, Alaska as a memento of the event.\n“I lived for three decades in Northern Minnesota near the Canadian border where you often see the Northern Lights in the night sky,” Davis said, “You are invited to a live presentation about how and where to watch the awesome Northern Lights (Aurora Borealis) and how huge explosions on the Sun cause this awesome phenomena.\"\nDavis continued, \"Using my own photographs, and those of my friend Kevin Milani, I will explain what causes the aurora’s gorgeous colors and shapes, how to stay informed about when and where it will occur, and how to photograph the Northern Lights.”\nThis is a not-to-be-missed event since the aurora will be at peak activity and beauty this year during Solar Maximum 2025, Davis explained. It will be another 11 years until the Sun reaches its next peak in its activity cycle.\n“Drawing on the knowledge gained during my decades-long fascination with and study of the Northern Lights, I will show the audience how and why beautiful, yet violent, plasma ejections from the surface of the Sun will affect us 93 million miles away, causing significant disruptions to Earth's technology, with power grid failures, satellite malfunctions, radio communication disruptions, and stunning auroras,” Davis said.\nAfterward, at 7:30 p.m., the spectacular film, “Aurora: Lights of Wonder” filmed in Yellowknife, in the Northwest Territories of Canada, will be shown. This ground-breaking full dome (hemispheric) show was filmed in real time with digital surround sound, so the audience is transported to Northwest Canada to experience the glorious colors, constantly changing shapes, and mysterious, dance-like movements of the Northern Lights as if you were there in person.\nTicket prices for the film, “Aurora: Lights of Wonder” following the presentation are $5 for general admission, $5 for TAMIU University faculty, staff, students and alumni, $5 for seniors 65 years and older, and $4 for children, ages 3-12.\nLocated under a distinctive glass pyramid, TAMIU’s Lamar Bruni Vergara Planetarium is part of the TAMIU Lamar Bruni Vergara Science Center on the east side of TAMIU's campus.\nFree parking is available next to the Planetarium at the west entrance to the LBV Science Center at Entrance 2 on University Boulevard. The Planetarium is a barrier free, accessible, air-conditioned facility with handicapped parking spaces near the door, curb cuts, ADA push plate door openers, and 8 wheelchair spaces in its dome.\nFor a schedule of the wide variety of shows that will be offered this spring, visit the “Now Playing” page of the Planetarium’s website at https://www.tamiu.edu/planetarium/showschedule.shtml or the Planetarium’s Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/txamiu.planetarium/.\nFor a campus map, visit https://www.tamiu.edu/map.shtml.\nFor more information, visit the Planetarium’s webpage at https://www.tamiu.edu/planetarium/index.shtml, call Davis at (956)326-3128 or email planetarium@tamiu.edu.",

    "title": "Deutsche Schulen: Schüler-Vertreter offenbaren „gravierende Missstände\"",
    "text": "Deutsche Schulen: Schüler-Vertreter offenbaren „gravierende Missstände“\nEine Sprecherin der Bundesschülerkonferenz beschreibt bei Ippen.Media, woran es in Deutschlands Schulen fehlt - samt Forderungen an Kanzler Friedrich Merz.\nBerlin - Am Dienstag (24. Juni) war es so weit. Die schwarz-rote Bundesregierung aus CDU/CSU und SPD hat ihren Entwurf für den Bundeshaushalt 2025 vorgelegt. Darin sind im Umfeld von Ukraine-Krieg und Russland-Aggression nicht zuletzt immense Verteidigungsausgaben zur Aufrüstung der Bundeswehr enthalten.\nSchulen in Deutschland: Thema Bildung ging im Bundestagswahlkampf unter\nBis zu 95 Milliarden Euro sollen in die deutschen Streitkräfte fließen. Die Verteidigungspolitik war schließlich auch ein zentrales Thema im Wahlkampf zur Bundestagswahl 2025. Ganz im Gegensatz zur Bildung allgemein und zu Schulen im Speziellen. Dabei wird seit Jahren über eklatante Versäumnisse in der Ausstattung deutscher Bildungseinrichtungen berichtet.\nZum Beispiel bei ausreichend und zeitgemäßen digitalen Geräten. Im Umfeld von Bundeshaushalt und schwarz-roten Plänen für Deutschland hat die Sprecherin der Bundesschülerkonferenz auf Anfrage der Frankfurter Rundschau von Ippen.Media jetzt „gravierende Missstände“ benannt. Sie stellt eindringliche Forderungen an die Koalition von Bundeskanzler Friedrich Merz (CDU) und Bundesfinanzminister Lars Klingbeil (SPD).\nBildung in Deutschland: Expertin berichtet von Missständen an deutschen Schulen\n„Die Missstände an deutschen Schulen sind vielerorts gravierend und sie ziehen sich durch nahezu alle Bereiche: Vom akuten Lehrkräftemangel, über unzureichende digitale Infrastruktur bis hin zu baulichen Mängeln, die zum Teil gesundheitsgefährdend sind. Es ist keine Ausnahme, sondern bittere Realität, dass Schülerinnen und Schüler in Räumen mit Schimmelbefall, undichten Fenstern und defekten Böden unterrichtet werden“, erklärt Tilda Skerra – „Wenn überhaupt Lehrkräfte zur Verfügung stehen“. Digitale Endgeräte würden ebenso fehlen wie stabiles WLAN oder zeitgemäße Lernumgebungen, schildert sie.\nSkerra ist Mitglied im Bundessekretariat der Bundesschülerkonferenz (BSK), die sich als Vertretung von Schülerinnen und Schülern der Bildungspolitik in Deutschland annimmt. Und zwar bei Themen von überregionaler Bedeutung. So sollen Anliegen von Schülern und Schülerinnen bundesweit Gehör verschafft werden, während für das Thema Bildung im deutschen Föderalismus vorrangig die Bundesländer zuständig sind.\nEs ist keine Ausnahme, sondern bittere Realität, dass Schüler*innen in Räumen mit Schimmelbefall, undichten Fenstern und defekten Böden unterrichtet werden.\nDie Kulturhoheit der Länder im Bildungsbereich ist im Grundgesetz verankert. Der Bund nimmt durch Fördermittel und Subventionen, etwa bei Bauvorhaben, aber sehr wohl erheblichen Einfluss auf die Bildungspolitik und kann die Länder je nach Gewichtung des Themas bei der Budgetierung erheblich entlasten - oder eben nicht.\nSondervermögen der schwarz-roten Koalition: Schüler-Vertreter fordern viel mehr Geld von Merz\nNach Ansicht von Skerra und ihrer Mitstreiter kommen aus Berlin zu wenige Signale und vor allem zu wenig Geld, um frühere Versäumnisse anzugehen und bestenfalls zu beheben. „Wir fordern, dass mindestens zehn Prozent des geplanten Infrastruktur-Sondervermögens, also rund 50 Milliarden Euro, zweckgebunden in die Sanierung und Modernisierung von Schulen investiert werden“, erklärt Skerra unserer Redaktion. „Darüber hinaus braucht es ein langfristig angelegtes Förderprogramm, das die bauliche, digitale und strukturelle Weiterentwicklung unserer Schulen strategisch begleitet.“\nFerner müsse der schon unter der früheren Ampel-Bundesregierung so bezeichnete „DigitalPakt deutlich aufgestockt und ausgebaut werden, um Bildung endlich nachhaltig im 21. Jahrhundert anzukommen zu lassen“, meint die Expertin. Zu weiteren Forderungen der Bundesschülerkonferenz gehört die Sicherstellung der Finanzierung von verpflichtenden Fort- und Weiterbildungsbereichen, was etwa die Themen „mentale Gesundheit“ und „digitale Lehrformate“ betreffe. Und ein realistischer Betreuungsschlüssel, wie es die BSK-Sprecherin beschreibt: „Mindestens eine Schulsozialarbeiterin oder ein Schulsozialarbeiter auf 300 Schüler*innen und auf 150 Schüler*innen eine Schulpsychologin oder ein Schulpsychologe je Bundesland.“\nLars Klingbeil stellt Bundeshaushalt 2025 vor: Bildungsausgaben steigen leicht\nDas alles gebe es bislang nicht. Die Investitionen in die Bildung, die Vize-Kanzler Klingbeil im Bundeshaushalt 2025 vorstellte, dürften bei den Experten aus dem Bereich jedoch für überschaubare Begeisterung sorgen. Laut Website des Bundesfinanzministeriums entfallen von 488,60 Milliarden Euro aus dem Regierungsentwurf gerade mal 4,57 Prozent auf die Themen Bildung und Forschung - rund 22,31 Milliarden Euro.\nDas ist ein leichter Anstieg. Zum Vergleich: Die gescheiterte Ampel-Bundesregierung hatte für 2024 noch 21,49 Milliarden Euro eingeplant. Laut Bundesfinanzministerium sollen aus dem Sondervermögen zudem insgesamt 6,5 Milliarden Euro in Investitionen für die Kindertagesbetreuung und in die digitale Bildung fließen. In einem Zeitraum bis 2029. Von den geforderten 50 Milliarden Euro der BSK ist das weit entfernt. (pm)",

    "text": "Störungen im Stromnetz in Mannheim\nIm baden-württembergischen Mannheim sind Haushalte im Durchschnitt nur wenige Minuten jährlich stromlos. Bundesweit ist das Stromnetz sehr resistent gegen Störungen. In den meisten Fällen liegen sehr lokal begrenzte Niederspannungsstörungen vor. Aktuell bestehen Strom-Störungen im Verantwortungsgebiet von MVV Netze GmbH in Mannheim. An zwei Standorten sind Techniker im Einsatz, um die Probleme zu beseitigen. Ob diese im Zuge von geplanten Wartungsarbeiten aufgetreten sind, ist nicht bekannt. Alle Detailinformationen zu möglichen und bestehenden Netzproblemen finden Sie hier in unserer Übersicht.\nFolgende Störungen liegen aktuell am 08.05.2025 in Mannheim vor\nStörung im Stromnetz\n- Standort: Umkreis von 📍\nKarlsternstraße in Mannheim (PLZ 68305), OT Gartenstadt - Start: 08.05.2025, 03:21 Uhr\n- Ende: 08.05.2025, 05:25 Uhr (voraussichtlich)\n- Netzbetreiber: MVV Netze GmbH\nStörung im Stromnetz\n- Standort: Umkreis von 📍\nBoehringerstraße in Mannheim (PLZ 68307), OT Schönau - Start: 08.05.2025, 03:27 Uhr\n- Ende: 08.05.2025, 05:30 Uhr (voraussichtlich)\n- Netzbetreiber: MVV Netze GmbH\n(Stand: 08.05.2025, 04:45 Uhr)\nAbgeschlossene Arbeiten am Stromnetz in Mannheim\nStandort | beendet seit | Status |\n---|---|---|\nBereich Helmut-Kohl-Straße in Mannheim (PLZ 68163), OT Lindenhof | 07.05.2025, 07:55 Uhr | Störung behoben |\nBereich Ludwig-Ratzel-Straße in Mannheim (PLZ 68165), OT Schwetzingerstadt/Oststadt, Oststadt | 07.05.2025, 04:00 Uhr | Störung behoben |\nBereich Riedfeldstraße in Mannheim (PLZ 68169), OT Neckarstadt-West | 07.05.2025, 02:55 Uhr | Störung behoben |\nBereich Schulstraße in Mannheim (PLZ 68161), OT Innenstadt/Jungbusch, Innenstadt, S6 | 07.05.2025, 02:55 Uhr | Störung behoben |\nStromausfall in Mannheim melden: Wie landet meine Störungsmeldung an der richtigen Stelle?\nWas Sie wissen sollten: Ein Ausfall des Stromes ist in den meisten Fällen kein Notfall. Wählen Sie nur im Ernstfall die Notrufnummern der Polizei oder der Feuerwehr. Versuchen Sie vielmehr zunächst herauszufinden, ob das Problem zum Beispiel nur in Ihrer Wohnung besteht, etwa weil eine Sicherung in Ihrem Sicherungskasten herausgeflogen ist. Ist das nicht der Fall, dann suchen Sie die Seite für Strörungsmeldungen Ihres Stromnetzbetreibers auf und melden dort Ihren Vorfall.\nHier gelangen Sie zur Störungsauskunft Ihres Netzbetreibers MVV Netze.\nWordurch können Blackouts und Stromausfälle entstehen?\nEin Blackout kann durch technische Probleme entstehen, etwa wenn mehr Strom benötigt als erzeugt wird oder Defekte an Leitungen auftreten. Häufig sind aber auch Unwetter die Ursache – Stürme oder Schneefall können Hochspannungsleitungen beschädigen und den Strom in einer Region lahm legen. Auch Kriege führten in der Vergangenheit schon zu Stromausfällen, wie 2003 im Irak oder 2022 in der Ukraine, wo gezielte Angriffe auf die Netzinfrastruktur die Energieversorgung massiv beeinträchtigten.\nFolgen Sie news.de schon bei Facebook und YouTube?
