    "text": "The nation jumped on the Matildas bandwagon after their success at the 2023 World Cup held in Australia and New Zealand. Now many are asking if the ride can continue.Controversial Brisbane radio host and former Wallaby fullback Greg Martin might have said what everyone was thinking on Triple M on Friday morning.\\u003cbr\\u003eThe Matildas must now beat Zambia in their next match on Sunday or their hopes of making the quarter-finals could be quickly over, given the perennial powerhouse US women's team awaits in the final group stage game. The US beat Zambia 3-0 Friday morning (AEST) to join Germany at the top of Australia's group.And let's not forget about the other Australian women's teams, some of them perhaps a more realistic chance for a medal. Some of them might even be asking why the Matildas are getting all the attention.The women's rugby sevens team start their campaign on July 29 at midnight local time against South Africa. They might have finished a disappointing fifth in Tokyo but they've been in great form during the international sevens season, finishing only two points behind New Zealand in second place.And the Opals are currently ranked third in the world behind US and China. Their opening game is against Nigeria at 7pm on July 29.The Hockeyroos might surprise a few people, too. Their opening match is July 28 at 8.45pm against South Africa.Our women's water polo team, the Stingers, have an experienced squad and could also upset more fancied teams. Their first game is July 28 at 4.05am against China.\\u003cbr\\u003e",

    "title": "Palestinian Organizations Warn Against Potential Complicity in Genocide Due to UNRWA Funding Cut Impacting Humanitarian Aid to Gaza",
    "text": "01، Feb 2024 Al Mezan, Al-Haq, and the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights (PCHR) strongly condemn the decision of several donor states to suspend funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA). Targeting the humanitarian agency that plays a crucial role in preventing mass starvation and death in Gaza, based on unverified allegations originally against 12 employees, and now reduced to four, amounts to an act of collective punishment against 5.9 million Palestinian refugees registered with UNRWA. If the (already) insufficient funding results in a significant reduction or complete cessation of UNRWA's life-saving activities in Gaza, these states may be implicated in complicity with genocide.\nOn 26 January 2024, the same day that Israel raised its unverified allegations against UNRWA, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) acknowledged the plausibility of Israel committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Since the plausible genocide ruling, Israeli authorities have intensified their orchestrated campaign against UNRWA, alleging that at least four out of UNRWA’s 30,000 employees are linked to the attack carried out by Palestinian armed groups on 7 October 2023. We acknowledge that UNRWA has dismissed the implicated staff, and the United Nations (UN) has initiated an inquiry into the allegations. While the UN and other states verify the Israeli allegations, it is crucial to remind them that obtaining forced confessions through torture, or any other forms of coercion is a serious breach of international human rights law [1] .\nIsrael's prolonged campaign to close down UNRWA is fundamentally driven by the core issue embedded in UNRWA's mandate: the implementation of UN General Assembly Resolution 194 (III). Since 1948, UNRWA has served as a vital support system for millions of Palestinian refugees residing across the occupied Palestinian territory and in Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan, to whom Israel has consistently denied their inalienable right to return. Our organizations stress that UNRWA must be preserved as an institution to protect the rights of Palestinians, still systematically denied their inalienable right of return and left for generations to live in refugee camps, denied their freedom of movement and basic human rights.\nThe international community has clear and unequivocal legal obligations to the Palestinian people who remain under the permanent responsibility of the United Nations until the Palestinian question is resolved. This includes obligations to protect and provide for Palestinian refugees and facilitate, without further delay, their right of return to their homes and lands from which they were forcibly expelled by the Israeli military and Zionist militias between 1947 and 1949—obligations which are partly met, in terms of humanitarian assistance, by UNRWA. Notably, the denial of return of the Palestinian people, deliberately and permanently fragments the Palestinian people as a group, and coupled with Israeli statements and plans to destroy Palestinians as a group, including its plan to dismantle UNRWA to deny Palestinian refugees their right of return, may in itself amount to a genocidal act.\nAt the time of writing, the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Iceland, Japan, Austria, Latvia, Lithuania, and Romania have abruptly suspended funding from UNRWA based on Israel’s assertions. This decision is particularly disconcerting considering our persistent appeals to these same states to cease providing arms to Israel and impose arms embargoes and economic sanctions. Despite compelling evidence of Israel committing numerous international crimes in Gaza—including acts of genocide—over the past three and a half months, our pleas have consistently been disregarded. This exposes these states' egregious double standards in the application of their obligations under international law.\nSeventy percent of the population in Gaza are refugees registered with UNRWA. During the ongoing genocidal military campaign carried out by Israel in Gaza, at least 26,900 Palestinians, including 152 UNRWA staff members, have been killed. This represents the highest number of UN aid workers killed in any conflict in the history of the UN. Moreover, at least 141 UNRWA facilities have been destroyed or damaged, including the headquarters in Gaza City. UNRWA-run schools, sheltering hundreds of thousands of internally displaced persons, have also been targeted, resulting in the death of 357 displaced individuals and injuries to 1,255 others. Despite these challenges, UNRWA persists in its operations and remains the primary provider of relief services to Palestinians in Gaza.\nThe decision to cut funding to the primary provider of humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza is even more sinister as it comes just a few days after the ICJ ordered Israel to take immediate and effective measures to enable the provision of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance to address the adverse conditions of life faced by Palestinians in Gaza. The timing of Israel's recent allegations against UNRWA suggests a malevolent motive to circumvent the applicability of the legally binding ICJ provisional measures in the case of South Africa vs. Israel. In effect the conveniently timed allegations, amount to reprisals against UNRWA, whose statements are referenced with support in the authoritative ICJ ruling against Israel for plausible genocide, and against the Palestinian people in Gaza.\nThe suspension of funding to UNRWA will significantly curtail the agency's operations in all areas, with a particularly pronounced impact in Gaza, where the population is grappling with conditions of life calculated to bring about physical destruction and erasure deliberately created by Israel. Our organizations caution that the suspension of funding to UNRWA, leading to the halt of humanitarian aid in Gaza, could potentially constitute complicity in genocide, especially for the primary donors of UNRWA , namely Germany and the United States.\nWe applaud Norway, Belgium, Luxembourg, Ireland, Spain, Slovenia, and Scotland for demonstrating moral and legal judgment and refraining from withdrawing funding from UNRWA. Our organizations call on donors to immediately resume their funding for UNRWA to ensure the continuity of its relief role, especially in the face of the ongoing Israeli genocide in Gaza. We emphasize the need to increase funding to address the unprecedented challenges in the midst of a collapsed healthcare system, the risk of famine, the spread of epidemics, and the lack of basic humanitarian services for Palestinian civilians in Gaza.",

    "text": "Families ‘scunnered’ with Humza Yousaf inquiry evidence Families who lost loved ones during the Covid-19 pandemic have said they were “scunnered” with First Minister Humza Yousaf’s evidence to the inquiry on Thursday and said it had given them “no answers”. The First Minister gave evidence to the UK Covid-19 inquiry on Thursday where he made an “unreserved apology” to families over the Scottish Government’s handling of WhatsApp messages exchanged throughout the pandemic. Lee Dodds, from the Scottish Covid Bereaved group, said it was hard to listen to the evidence given on Thursday. His son, also named Lee Dodds, died in 2021 when he was just 32. He said: “They go on about the WhatsApps, everything disappears and they don’t know how. “I was just scunnered with it. “I was getting bored listening to it about who was to blame, somebody else. “But nothing about what happened to our loved ones. “There was nothing there for us bar them blaming it on other people. “And for me that wasn’t good enough for my son. “I wanted answers but I didn’t get any.” Maggie Watterton lost both her husband and mother during the pandemic. She told reporters after Mr Yousaf’s evidence that his apology was “woeful”. And she described the “rhetoric” of the Scottish Government as “very far from the reality”. Mrs Watterton added: “They failed to act, they failed in fact to take evidence, advice from well renowned experts. “They hid behind the empty words of the four harms framework, hid behind the mantra of reserved powers, delayed locking down in 2020, and it is obvious that ministers and officers of the government have been deleting crucial information which could materially impact the outcome of this inquiry.” Mrs Watterton said their actions had “broken trust”. She pleaded with both Mr Yousaf and former first minister Nicola Sturgeon to reflect on what they were doing deleting crucial evidence and their plans to reinstate independence campaigning while “people were dying in care homes”. The inquiry, which is being held in Edinburgh before Lady Hallett, continues.",

    "text": "Here is a list of the number of antisemitic and Islamophobic hate crime offences recorded by police forces from October 7 to November 7 2023 inclusive, together with totals for the equivalent periods in 2022 and 2021.\nThe figures have been obtained by the PA news agency from Freedom of Information requests sent to all forces in the UK.\nThe data is a snapshot of what has currently been recorded by forces and may be subject to change.\nAll figures are for crimes recorded by police forces, not incidents.\nSystems and methods of recording and collating hate crime are not consistent across all forces, so the data cannot be used to compare the volume of offences between different areas or provide an overall total for the whole of the UK.\nSome forces provided notes and responses to the data and these are included where appropriate.\nNot all forces are included in the list and reasons for omissions are given at the end.\n– Avon & Somerset\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 5, 2022 – 3, 2023 – 7\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 5\nThe force said that completion of the “hate type” field on its records is not mandatory. Where a crime has taken place it will be recorded, but the hate crime indicator or type will not always be ticked, meaning some offences will have been recorded without an indication of the type of hate crime that has been committed.\n– Bedfordshire\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 2\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 3\n– British Transport Police\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 11, 2022 – 8, 2023 – 87\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 22\n– Cambridgeshire\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 6\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 5\nThe force said the figures are the number of police-recorded religious hate crimes where the perceived religion was Jewish or Muslim, based on the keyword assigned to the crime.\n– Dorset\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 4\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 1\n– Durham\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 0\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 1\nThe force said the figures refer to the number of recorded hate crimes where the victim’s religion has been known to be Judaism or Islam.\n– Gloucestershire\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 2\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 3\nThe force said the figures are for crimes where a hate tag has been applied, which have then been filtered to identify the hate strands “Religion – Jewish” and “Religion – Muslim”.\n– Greater Manchester\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 14, 2022 – 15, 2023 – 74\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 42, 2022 – 43, 2023 – 34\nThe force said antisemitic offences are where the perceived targeted religion was recorded as Jewish.

The search only returned exact matches and does not account for differences in terminology and/or spelling used. The force added that keyword searches are problematic and in no way provide accurate results or figures.\n– Northumbria\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 10, 2022 – 3, 2023 – 9\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 7, 2023 – 5\nThe force said the figures were for offences flagged as “Judaism” and “Islam” and that hate crimes are based on the perception of the victim.\n– Nottinghamshire\nAntisemitic: 2021 – under 5, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 7\nIslamophobic: 2021 – under 5, 2022 – under 5, 2023 – 19\nThe force said all crimes have a religious and/or belief marker.\n– South Wales\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 8\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 7, 2022 – 6, 2023 – 9\nThe force said the figures are for occurrences with the qualifier of “Hate/prejudice – anti-Jewish” and “Hate/prejudice anti-Muslim”.\n– Suffolk\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 1\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 0\n– Surrey\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 7\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 8, 2023 – 10\nThe force noted that offences are flagged as hate crimes at the discretion of the police officer or staff member.\n– Thames Valley\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 21\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 12, 2022 – 14, 2023 – 20\n– Warwickshire\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 3\nIslamophobic: No information held\nThe force said the figures were obtained by searching for all crimes with a marker of “Hate Motivated – Religion – Jewish” and “Hate Motivated – Religion – Muslim” during the stated periods.\n– West Mercia\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 3\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 4\n– West Midlands\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 22\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 23, 2022 – 33, 2023 – 25\nThe force said the figures were obtained by searching for the hate strands “Religion – Judaism” and “Religion – Islam”.\n– West Yorkshire\nAntisemitic: 2021 – 14, 2022 – 10, 2023 – 53\nIslamophobic: 2021 – 38, 2022 – 29, 2023 – 49\nThe force said the figures represent the number of faith hate crimes recorded where Islam or Judaism was identified as the religion targeted.

The force has specialist hate crime co-ordinators who assist investigating officers in identifying perpetrators, providing after-care support for victims and working with communities to increase awareness of hate crime and reporting mechanisms.
