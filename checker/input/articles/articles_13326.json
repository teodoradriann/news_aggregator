    "title": "PM Modi opens Sela tunnel, puts military mobility in fast lane to counter China",
    "text": "The ‘Sela Tunnel’ was virtually inaugurated by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday dedicated the Sela tunnel project in Arunachal Pradesh to the country, with the infrastructure upgrade putting in the fast lane military mobility and logistics support for deployed forces in the strategic Tawang sector, where Indian soldiers hold posts close to the contested border with China.\nModi remotely inaugurated the tunnel, built by the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) at a cost of ₹825 crore, from Arunachal Pradesh’s capital Itanagar during the “Viksit Bharat Viksit Northeast” (developed India, developed Northeast) programme. He laid the foundation stone for the tunnel, the world’s longest twin-lane tunnel above 13,000 feet, in February 2019.\nRead here: PM inaugurates Sela tunnel, dedicates projects worth ₹55000 cr to six NE states\nSela tunnel’s inauguration is a moment of great pride for the country, he said.\n“When I had laid the foundation stone for it a few years ago, some people were unsure that this project will be completed soon because the work culture that prevailed for several decades normalised delays. But the NDA (National Democratic Alliance) government works with a different approach and the tunnel has been inaugurated, giving you all yet another reason to visit Arunachal Pradesh,” he wrote in a post on X, taking a dig at the previous Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government ahead of general elections expected to be held this summer.\nThe new route will provide all-weather connectivity and allow quicker deployment of weapons, soldiers and equipment to forward areas near the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the Tawang sector. The BRO, which is at the centre of India’s border infrastructure push, has built the tunnel on the road connecting Tezpur in Assam to Tawang in Arunachal’s West Kameng district. The army’s Tezpur-based Gajraj Corps is responsible for guarding the Tawang sector.\nIn his address, Modi reiterated the government’s unwavering resolve to develop the northeast, while stressing that the aim was to work to fulfil the country’s needs, and not electoral considerations. He promised soldiers that he would visit the tunnel and meet them in his third term, once again expressing confidence that the ruling NDA will be voted back to power.\nArunachal Pradesh chief minister Pema Khandu and minister of earth sciences Kiren Rijiju were among those present at the programme.\n“The tunnel will provide all-weather connectivity to Tawang across the pass, Sela, on the Balipara-Charduar-Tawang road, boosting the preparedness of the armed forces and augmenting the socio-economic development of the border region,” the defence ministry said in a statement.\nThe project is significant as winter connectivity to Tawang over the 14,000ft Sela pass posed a logistics challenge for the army for decades, with the movement of men, weapons and stores severely affected for three to four months every year. The tunnel will cut down the travel time to Tawang by at least one hour. The tunnel has been designed for a daily traffic density of 3,000 cars and 2,000 trucks, with a maximum speed of 80 kmph, officials aware of the matter said, seeking anonymity.\nThe Sela project consists of Tunnel 1, which is 1,003 metres long, and Tunnel 2, a 1,595-metre twin tube tunnel. The tunnels have come up through two ridges west of Sela. The project also includes two roads measuring 8.6 km. Tunnel 2 has one bi-lane tube for traffic and an escape tube for emergencies. Only tunnels longer than 1,500 metres need to have an escape passage alongside.\nThe project will not only provide a faster and more efficient transport route in the region but is of strategic importance to the country, the defence ministry statement added.\nThe completion of the Sela tunnel project has put spotlight on India’s border infrastructure push aimed at bridging the gap with China, which has fast-tracked the development of its forward areas. India and China have been locked in a dragging military standoff along LAC in eastern Ladakh since May 2020, and a full resolution of the border crisis through ongoing negotiations still appears elusive.\nThe BRO has completed 330 infrastructure projects at a cost of ₹8,737 crore in the past three years, and significantly improved the strategic mobility of the Indian armed forces along the contested border with China.\nThe Sela tunnel signals a monumental enhancement in the army’s logistical prowess in the Tawang sector, Lieutenant General Harpal Singh (retd), who oversaw critical phases of the project as BRO chief, had said earlier.\n“It will offer a fortified, expeditious and dependable conduit for troop mobilisation, equipment conveyance, and vital supplies distribution. The tunnel will allow the army to mount swifter responses to security challenges and assert a more resolute presence in the forward areas,” said Singh, who was BRO’s director general during 2018-20.\nRead here: After Sela tunnel, focus shifts to other key border infra projects\nIndia’s infrastructure push along its farthest frontiers is a firm and focussed response to China’s thrust on developing its border areas, and has supported the military’s pursuit of robust deterrence against the neighbour.\nChina’s unrelenting infrastructure push over a span of just three to four years, confirmed by satellite images, encompasses new airbases, missile sites, roads, bridges, tunnels, reinforced bunkers, underground facilities to protect military assets from aerial strikes, accommodation for soldiers and ammunition depots.\nChina has an edge over India in border infrastructure, but the country is catching up fast with the neighbour on the back of speedy execution of strategic projects to support military operations, increased spending, and focussed adoption of technology and techniques.\nRead more news like this on HindustanTimes.com",

    "text": "Kane Brown Plays Good Samaritan During Nashville Snowstorm It was an epic snow day in Nashville on Monday (Jan. 15). Many [country artists ](https://tasteofcountry.com/country-stars-snow-day-kid-pictures/)were out watching the magic of the winter wonderland through their children’s eyes, but [Kane Brown](https://tasteofcountry.com/tags/kane-brown/) also took some time out to help others. Brown and his wife, Katelyn, made good use out of the multiple inches of snow their front yard had accumulated. Katelyn captured little girl giggles as Kane aggressively sledded down their hill with their oldest daughter, Kingsley. \"Oh, it's all in her face. Are you okay?\" says Katelyn from behind the camera. \"Yeah, it's so cold I can't see,\" Kingsley replies. However, not everyone got to spend the day playing in the snow and having fun with loved ones. Many still had to brave the treacherous weather conditions and go to work. Brown, recognizing this, knew he could directly help transport people back and forth from work back home. “Kane went to the gas station this morning and has been seeing people working,” Katelyn shares on her Instagram Story. “So, he’s giving them rides home from work. He gave them his number and told them to call whenever they got off work.” Brown knew he had a vehicle capable of plowing through the powdered terrain, so he decided to assist where he could. “So currently Kane is like the Uber driver of Nashville,” Katelyn jokes. Per the [ Tennessean](https://www.tennessean.com/story/weather/2024/01/15/record-snowfall-in-nashville-city-surpasses-yearly-average-in-one-day/72234215007/), Nashville’s Monday snowfall surpassed the yearly average within 24 hours. The city hasn’t hit the overall average yet, but meteorologists are predicting more harsh weather on the horizon. Snow Day!

    "title": "Judge orders removal of wind farm opposed by Osage",
    "text": "Curtis Killman\nTulsa World\nA judge has ordered the removal of a wind farm in Osage County and set a trial for damages in a win for the Osage Nation and its Mineral Council, which, along with the federal government, have been fighting the erection of the turbines for more than 10 years.\nU.S. Court of International Trade Judge Jennifer Choe-Groves, sitting by designation, issued the ruling Wednesday in Tulsa federal court against Osage Wind LLC, Enel Kansas LLC and Enel Green Power North America Inc.\nThe ruling grants the United States and the Osage Nation through its Minerals Council permanent injunctive relief via “ejectment of the wind turbine farm for continuing trespass.”\nThe Minerals Council is an arm of the Osage Nation that manages the Osage Minerals Estate.\nThe ruling follows a 2017 appellate court ruling that determined that construction of the wind farm constituted mining and required a lease from the Osage Nation’s Minerals Council, which the defendants failed to obtain.\n“The developers failed to acquire a mining lease during or after construction, as well as after issuance of the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals’ decision holding that a mining lease was required,” Choe-Groves said.\n“On the record before the Court, it is clear the Defendants are actively avoiding the leasing requirement,” Choe-Groves said. “Permitting such behavior would create the prospect for future interference with the Osage Mineral Council’s authority by Defendants or others wishing to develop the mineral lease.\n“The Court concludes that Defendants’ past and continued refusal to obtain a lease constitutes interference with the sovereignty of the Osage Nation and is sufficient to constitute irreparable injury.”\nOsage Minerals Council Chairman Everett Waller said in an interview Thursday morning that he was still “stunned” by the ruling.\n“I hope no other tribe has to do what we had to do,” Waller said, referring to the long court battle.\n“This is a win not only for the Osage Minerals Council; this is a win for Indian Country,” Waller said.\n“There are a lot of smaller tribes that couldn’t have battled this long, but that’s why we’re Osages,” Waller said. “We’re here, and this is our homeland, and we are going to protect it at all costs.”\nOsage Wind, for its part, claimed that while an appeals court found that it had “mined without a lease in 2014, it did not hold that Osage Wind was obligated to obtain a lease for that completed mining or for any other ongoing purposes.”\nThe legal saga has been ongoing for more than a decade, at one point reaching the U.S. Supreme Court.\nThe Osage Nation filed a federal lawsuit in October 2011 seeking to halt the construction of the wind farm, alleging that the project unlawfully deprived the Osage Nation of access to and the right to develop the mineral estate.\nThe nation’s claims were denied, and the case was dismissed on merits.\nThe defendants began leasing surface rights for the project in 2013, according to the ruling.\nThe wind farm includes 84 turbines spread across 8,400 acres of leased surface rights in Osage County, underground lines, overhead transmission lines, meteorological towers and access roads, the ruling said.\nConstruction on the wind towers began in October 2013, with excavation for the towers beginning in September 2014.\nThe federal government filed a federal lawsuit in November 2014, seeking a declaratory judgment that the defendants engaged in unauthorized mining and excavation in the Osage Mineral Estate, according to the ruling.\nThe U.S. Department of the Interior administers the Osage Nation’s mineral rights, which include ownership of rocks and minerals below the ground’s surface. Federal law requires developers to obtain a permit from the tribe’s Minerals Council to engage in any mining activity in the county.\nA federal district judge initially ruled in favor of the wind farm project in 2015, finding that excavation of the rock for the wind turbine concrete foundation did not constitute mining.\nBut the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver reversed that decision in a 2017 ruling.\nThe appellate court held that Osage Wind’s extraction, sorting, crushing and use of minerals as part of its excavation work constituted mineral development, thereby requiring a federally approved lease that was not obtained. It disputed the district judge’s interpretation that the definition of mining required the sale of minerals.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court rejected a request by Osage Wind to review the appeals court decision.\nIn considering whether to issue a permanent injunction, Choe-Groves weighed several factors, including balancing the tribe’s claim that the unleased wind farm damages its sovereignty against Osage Wind’s claim that it would suffer the inevitable loss of hundreds of millions of dollars if the wind towers were removed.\nOsage Wind also claimed that removal of the wind turbines would result in a loss of revenue from two local schools, jobs, income for the surface estate owners and renewable energy for 50,000 homes.\nBut Choe-Groves was not persuaded by Osage Wind’s claims of the harm that would occur if the turbines were removed.\n“Even if negative effects were to result, including the significant monetary impact of hundreds of millions of dollars, such effects would not negate the public interest in private entities abiding by the law and respecting government sovereignty and the decision of courts,” the judge wrote.\nA spokesman for Osage Wind could not be reached for comment on the decision.",

    "text": "NASA's New Astrophysics Missions Set to Unlock Cosmic Mysteries [Kelly Martin](https://investorshangout.com/profile/view?id=79570)Updated: 10-03-2024 04:54 PM Nasa's Innovative Steps in Astrophysics Exploration Nasa has taken a significant leap forward in its quest to unveil the mysteries of the universe with the announcement of new mission proposals aimed at studying X-ray and far-infrared wavelengths. This initiative, designed to kickstart the next generation of astrophysics missions, seeks to deepen our understanding of essential cosmic phenomena. Mission Proposal Overview Two notable proposals have emerged from this initiative, each receiving up to $5 million for detailed mission concept studies that will last one year. These studies are integral for establishing feasibility and outlining scientific objectives that align with pressing astrophysical challenges. Following these assessments, one pioneering concept will be selected by NASA in 2026, preparing for a launch that aims for 2032. The Probe Explorers Initiative This selection marks the introduction of a new mission class called Probe Explorers within NASA's renowned Explorers Program. The Probe Explorers are designed to bridge the gap between the larger flagship missions and smaller undertakings, allowing for a broader range of scientific inquiries. Expectations from the Selected Concepts The selected proposals are expected to not only advance our scientific knowledge but also develop essential technologies that could be pivotal for future flagship missions. These concepts hold the potential to address top astrophysical priorities and engage the wider scientific community in using the new observatory for collaborative research. Key Contributions from the National Academies A noteworthy recommendation from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine paves the way for these explorations. Their 2020 Decadal Survey, dubbed \"Pathways to Discovery in Astronomy and Astrophysics for the 2020s,\" urged NASA to establish this new class primarily focused on observing X-ray or far-infrared wavelengths. Capping mission costs at $1 billion ensures strategic allocation of resources while promoting the advancement of significant scientific inquiries. Focus of the Selected Proposals The two selected mission proposals include: Advanced X-ray Imaging Satellite This mission focuses on launching an advanced X-ray imaging observatory that promises to deliver high spatial resolution and a wide field-of-view. Its objectives include scrutinizing the beginnings of supermassive black holes, understanding stellar feedback processes that mold galaxy evolution, and unearthing energy sources behind various cosmic explosions. It aspires to build on the achievements of past X-ray observatories while enhancing capabilities essential for X-ray imaging. Leading this ground-breaking project is Principal Investigator Christopher Reynolds from the University of Maryland, College Park, with the project management handled by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Probe Far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics The second proposal features a 1.8-meter telescope dedicated to studying far-infrared wavelengths, aimed at filling gaps between existing infrared and radio telescopes. This mission seeks to unpack the origins of planets, supermassive black holes, stars, and cosmic dust by analyzing radiant energy in the far-infrared spectrum. Lead by Principal Investigator Jason Glenn at NASA Goddard, project management is managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Legacy of the Explorers Program The Explorers Program, regarded as the oldest ongoing NASA initiative, has been pivotal in offering consistent and cost-efficient access to space. Since the historic launch of Explorer 1 in 1958, this program has facilitated over 90 missions, enhancing our universal knowledge and recognition in the field of science.

On Thursday, the national capital's minimum temperature settled at 8.4 degrees Celsius, one notch above the season's average, while the maximum temperature was recorded at 21.4 degrees Celsius, also one notch above normal.\nVisuals on social media showed people sleeping inside shelter homes in Delhi.
