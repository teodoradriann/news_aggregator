    "title": "Guerra das IAs! Anthropic Apresenta rival da OpenAI com performance avançada. Será o fim do ChatGPT?",
    "text": "Claude 3.7 Sonnet: Novo modelo de IA promete “raciocinar” melhor que o famoso e clássico ChatGPT!\nA startup Anthropic, rival direta da OpenAI, acaba de lançar seu mais novo modelo de inteligência artificial: o Claude 3.7 Sonnet. O diferencial? A promessa de raciocinar melhor, seguir instruções com mais precisão e ser muito mais eficiente para programadores, de acordo com o site Uol.\nIA híbrida: Pensamento rápido e raciocínio aprimorado\nSegundo Jared Kaplan, cofundador da Anthropic, o Claude 3.7 Sonnet vai além das respostas rápidas. Ele é um modelo híbrido, ou seja, pode dar respostas instantâneas ou “pensar” por mais tempo para resolver perguntas complexas, analisar dados e redigir textos mais sofisticados.\nMas, o que muda na prática?\n✔️ Mais inteligência na programação: Melhor para desenvolvedores criarem códigos.\n✔️ Maior precisão: Segue instruções com mais exatidão.\n✔️ Raciocínio avançado: Responde perguntas difíceis com lógica aprimorada.\n✔️ Textos longos e detalhados: Maior capacidade de organizar e estruturar conteúdos complexos.\nOpenAI vs Anthropic: A nova batalha da IA\nNos últimos meses, a disputa entre Claude e ChatGPT ficou ainda mais acirrada. A OpenAI lançou o GPT-4o, um modelo que promete ser mais humano ao demonstrar os passos do seu “pensamento”.\nJá a Anthropic inovou na autonomia da IA com a função “Computer Use”, permitindo que o Claude acesse a internet, navegue em sites e até use programas como um ser humano.\nAs empresas Google, Meta e a chinesa DeepSeek também correm para dominar a IA generativa. O modelo DeepSeek R1, lançado recentemente, promete qualidade altíssima a um custo menor, desafiando as gigantes do setor.",

    "text": "First Alert Safety Check: Test for the flu at home\nSIOUX FALLS, S.D. (Dakota News Now) - Multiple sources have called this flu season the worst in decades. Data from the CDC shows that at least 24 million people in the U.S. have caught the flu so far this season, and that number continues to climb. For the first time, you can test yourself and your family at home for both COVID-19 and the flu.\nPediatric infectious disease specialist at Sanford Health, Ashley Sands, MD, said, “They’re very similar to the at-home COVID test that we took, that were mailed to us. So, it tests for a little bit of the virus to see if you have been infected.”\nAll you do is swab your nose for about 10 seconds in each nostril and wait 15 to 30 minutes for the test to develop. However, these over-the-counter tests come with their own limitations.\n“You can have false negatives if you test yourself too early, so you may need to test two or three times before you get that positive test,” said Sands.\nThese tests can be found at your local pharmacy or on Amazon. A positive test can help determine whether you’ve contracted COVID-19 or the flu, ultimately getting you treatment faster.\n“Because we do have some oral treatments that you can do at home to try and decrease your symptoms and make your symptoms not so bad,” Sands explained.\nHealth officials said there’s still time to get your flu vaccine and encourage you to implement healthy habits into your life to prevent contracting or spreading the virus.\n“Washing your hands. If you’re not feeling well stay home. we can wear makes out in public if we have to go out in public and just take care of ourselves and get lots of rest and keep yourself hydrated with fluids and get a nice well-balanced diet,” said Sands.\nIf you are experiencing concerning symptoms, such as high fevers that haven’t broken for multiple days, shortness of breath, or trouble breathing, health officials urge you to seek medical attention.\nCopyright 2025 Dakota News Now.

Meu pai veio aqui e levou a minha outra filha para a casa dele porque ele ficou com medo de deixá-la aqui e acontecer a mesma coisa. Eu só consigo dormir tomando remédios, não tenho paz. Quero a minha filha de volta, quero que devolvam ela. Acabaram com a minha família, nós nem tivemos Natal. Eu comprei uma roupa de presente e ela nem chegou a usar — desabafa Márcia da Silva.\nDe acordo com a mulher, a menina vestia camisa do Flamengo, short jeans e chinelos na cor verde quando sumiu no trajeto de retorno para casa. Os colegas afirmam que ela chegou ser acompanhada, por um dos meninos que participava das brincadeiras, até determinado ponto, antes de desaparecer. Por volta das 21h30, a manicure estranhou a demora da filha e pediu ao filho, de 15 anos, para procurar a irmã. Sem informações, Márcia pediu apoio aos familiares, vizinhos e amigos, que iniciaram as buscas na região.\n— Algumas pessoas falaram que chegaram a vê-la depois das 22h andando sozinha. Uma conhecida minha disse que chegou a perguntar o que ela estaria fazendo tão tarde na rua, mas ela só disse que \"iria ali\" — relata Márcia da Silva.\nO desaparecimento foi registrado na 54ª DP (Belford Roxo), que encaminhou o caso para o Setor de Descoberta de Paradeiros da Delegacia de Homicídios da Baixada Fluminense (DHBF). A Polícia Civil informou que testemunhas estão sendo ouvidas e diligências estão sendo feitas para localizar a criança.\nInformações sobre o desaparecimento de Luynara Elias podem ser repassadas ao Disque-Denúncia (2253-1177), 190 (PM) ou ao Programa SOS Criança Desaparecida (2286-8337/98596-5296).

    "title": "Two Penn Nursing Professors Selected for Induction to the International Nurse Researcher Hall of Fame",
    "text": "Two Penn Nursing Professors Selected for Induction to the International Nurse Researcher Hall of Fame\nPenn Nursing’s Eileen Lake and Salimah Meghani will both be honored by Sigma Theta Tau International for their contributions to the nursing profession during the organization’s 35th International Nursing Research Congress in Singapore, in July, 2024.\nProfessor of Nursing, the Edith Clemmer Steinbright Professor in Gerontology, and Associate Director of the\nCenter for Health Outcomes and Policy Research\n“When I was inducted into Sigma Theta Tau International Honor Society of Nursing over forty years ago, I never dreamed that I could join an International Hall of Fame of nurse researchers. To me, this award represents the pinnacle of achievement in nursing scholarship worldwide. Receiving this award means that my research and mentoring have had a profound impact on our profession, the communities we serve, and the students we train,” said Lake. “This award means that my parents’, husband’s, and children’s support and belief in me throughout my lifetime have been fulfilled. Likewise, no one receives a major award without having dedicated mentors, colleagues, and administrators. I am deeply grateful to my University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing and Center for Health Outcomes and Policy Research colleagues and my colleagues from other institutions. I hope that my example inspires other nurses and nurse scientists to follow their passion to advance nursing science, practice, policy, and population health.”\n“Dr. Lake’s scholarship in improving nurse work environments means a better work climate for all of us,” said\nPenn Nursing Dean Antonia M. Villarruel, “and her induction into the Hall of Fame highlights the importance of her work for nursing, health care, and patients and families. She is truly deserving of this honor as a nurse, a researcher, and a leader.”\nAbout Dr. Lake’s Work\nWith training in nursing administration, public policy, and sociology, Lake developed a foundational measure of nursing care performance to demonstrate nursing’s impact on patient outcomes: the Practice Environment Scale of the Nursing Work Index. Continually endorsed for two decades as a U.S. national quality performance standard, the index provides scientific evidence that health care settings that capitalize on nurses’ education and skills – by providing competent and supportive managers, expecting physicians to treat nurses as partners in care, providing sufficient staff and resources, and encouraging nurse input on decisions – achieve higher quality outcomes. Her goal with the index, which is used in over 23 languages, is to motivate managers and policymakers to make nursing resources a priority investment.\nLake’s research impact spans clinical practice, policy, and methods. She has focused mainly on neonatal intensive care units (NICU), linking nurse staffing and work environments to critically ill newborn outcomes. Her publications are cited in the National Association of Neonatal Nurses 2021 Position Statement on RN Staffing in the NICU and the Association of Women’s Health, Obstetric, and Neonatal Nurses 2022 Professional Registered Nurse Staffing for Perinatal Units standards, which will support widespread changes in clinical practice.\nFor policy impact, her publications documenting superior patient outcomes in better staffed hospitals as well as in Magnet hospitals have catalyzed policy changes including the adoption of hospital nurse ratios in Wales, Ireland, Queensland AU, and several U.S. states; and the expansion of Magnet Recognition. Her research on hospital performance in Chile linked nurse staffing to rates of patient mortality and readmission throughout Chile’s public hospitals. The bi-national research team shared these results with the Chilean Ministry of Health. She is presently collaborating with scientists in Scotland to evaluate their Safe Staffing Law.\nLake is one of few researchers exploring health disparities from the hospital nursing system perspective. Her publications revealed poorer patient outcomes, worse nursing resources, and poorer nursing care quality in NICUs that serve predominantly Black very low birth weight infants. Last year she published on racial disparities in low-risk cesarean rates across hospitals and presented research documenting poorer nurse outcomes (worse moral distress and mental health) during the pandemic in hospitals where Black people predominantly access care. These contributions open a potential pathway through poorer nurse staffing and work environments to disparities in both racial minority patients and the nurses in hospitals where Black patients are served disproportionately. Lake is recognized for mentoring with national and school awards. As co-director of a 25-year long NIH-funded training program, she contributes to the development of future scientists.\nSalimah H. Meghani, PhD, MBE, RN, FAAN\nProfessor of Nursing & Palliative Care, and Associate Director of the\nNewCourtland Center for Transitions and Health\n“I am profoundly honored to be inducted into Sigma’s International Nurse Researcher Hall of Fame. Receiving this honor holds significant meaning for me as it symbolizes the culmination of a long and dedicated journey,” said Meghani. “This award is especially meaningful because it serves as a testament to impact, underscoring that the true value of scholarship and funding success lies in their ability to make a tangible difference. I am deeply thankful for this recognition and wish to acknowledge the invaluable support of all those who have contributed to this path.”\n“Dr. Meghani’s long-standing commitment to advancing the field of palliative care—and her myriad accomplishments—has been impactful not only to nurses but to patients and families,” said\nPenn Nursing Dean Antonia M. Villarruel. “Her induction into the Hall of Fame reflects her leadership in palliative care policy, education, practice, and scholarship. She is passionate about engaging with nurses, healthcare providers, and policy makers at all levels to impact the field of palliative care.”\nAbout Dr. Meghani’s Work\nDr. Meghani is considered the foremost expert in her field and is acknowledged for her substantial contributions by state and federal agencies and professional organizations. She was appointed by Governor Edward Rendell of Pennsylvania to serve on a task force dedicated to enhancing end-of-life care for Pennsylvanians. As a member, Meghani played a pivotal role in developing a blueprint aimed at improving access to end-of-life care for minority and underserved communities in the state.\nMeghani was one of only two nurses who served on the landmark National Academy of Medicine (NAM) report, Dying in America: Improving Quality and Honoring Individual Preferences Near the End of Life, and the NAM Planning Committee on Pain Management For People With Serious Illness in the Context of The Opioid Use Disorder Epidemic. She also reviewed the NAM report, Assessing Progress on the Future of Nursing. Meghani is the past Chair of the American Pain Society’s Pain Disparities Shared Interest Group and has served on numerous editorial boards including the official Journal of the American Academy of Pain Medicine. Meghani was recently invited by the Director of the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) to serve on its Partner Consultation Board for the Multilevel Interventions to Reduce Harm and Improve Quality of Life for Patients on Long-Term Opioid Therapy Research Network as part of NIH HEAL initiative. Her research findings have been utilized in congressional testimonies and influential policy reports, highlighting their tangible impact on guiding key decision-makers.\nMeghani spearheads a highly impactful research program aimed at enhancing pain and symptom management for individuals with cancer, particularly in the context of the opioid crisis. Her research adeptly navigates this challenging landscape compounded by the intersections of federal policies, state restrictions, and clinical practice guidelines governing opioid access and use. Her research offers valuable insights into the multifaceted nature of cancer pain management and spans an understanding of clinicians, systems, and policy factors that affect clinicians’ decision-making, patients’ self-management through the trajectory of their illness, and patient-reported outcomes. Her research is supported National Institutes of Health, National Institute on Nursing Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH Office of Director, the American Cancer Society among others. Her career highlights also include receiving the highly competitive NIH American Recovery and Reinvestment Challenge Grant. Her research, policy and advocacy work has led to informing federal policies, clinical practice guidelines and congressional testimonies.",

    "text": "Q: Our condominium building has termites and needs to be tented. This means everyone must be out of the building for a few days. Some owners are protesting the idea, its timing and the expense. Do all of the owners have to cooperate? — Hardy\nA: Yes, ultimately, all of the residents will need to temporarily vacate the building for the fumigation. Your association is responsible for maintaining the common areas, including mitigating termite damage. While this has to be balanced with the resident’s rights to enjoy their homes, they must cooperate with reasonable safety, maintenance, and repair requests.\nThe association should ensure that tenting is absolutely necessary and that no less disruptive alternatives exist.\nGood communication with the residents explaining the situation and the need for the fumigation should help smooth things over.\nWhile moving out for a few days is a hardship, having their homes destroyed by termites is much worse. It is important to remember that communication works both ways. The protests may be more general, such as worrying about the cost or where to stay, or more specific, such as a homebound resident. Listen to the residents’ concerns and address them as best you can.\nThat said, not every concern will have a good solution, and eventually, everyone will need to leave for a few days.\nIf an owner remains uncooperative, the association may need to take legal action to enforce compliance. However, it may be necessary for the association to send their attorney to court for an “injunction” ordering the resident to cooperate.\nAfter that, if they still refuse to cooperate, the court can send law enforcement to remove the recalcitrant person and allow the fumigation to proceed.\nFortunately, after proper communication, such extreme measures are rarely necessary.\nGary M.

    "text": "The Best Natural Methods For Lash Lifting\nEyelashes Are Trending\nIf you’ve ever tried fake eyelashes, you may have discovered achieving Bambi eyes isn’t an entirely painless (or affordable) beauty trend. Lash extensions and lifts require maintenance and care, and the chemicals used along the way are rarely safe for you or the environment. This goes for the toxic glues used in single-use drugstore lashes, too.\nThe good news is, Mother Nature has us covered. Though we believe that each person is beautiful as they are, we also get that it can feel good to have thicker, longer, or just healthier lashes. And for that, we turn to plant-based oils and remedies.\nHere are a few of our favorite natural methods—and then a couple of our favorite natural products for when we’re feeling less DIY. Top off with natural mascara and a few of our other favorite organic makeup products.\n*When using oils, we recommend ones which are cold-pressed, fair trade, and/or organic.\nAt-Home Methods For Lash Lifting\nApplication: Use a small mascara wand and apply a few drops at night after washing your face. You can also use a Q-Tip or your fingers to coat lashes gently. Apply faithfully for three to six months to begin seeing results!\n1. Castor Oil\nOne of the most talked-about oils for lifting lashes is castor oil—a vegetable oil derived from seeds of a plant native to tropical areas in Africa and Asia. It’s a thick and glossy liquid with a yellowish tint, and it’s touted as one of nature’s best for healthier and longer lashes.\nCastor oil is mostly ricinoleic acid, an omega fatty acid which nourishes brittle and fine hairs, spurring health and growth. The oil is also rich in vitamin E, which repairs damaged follicles and prevents further breakage. It also includes properties that moisturize and hydrate even the most delicate of lashes.\nOur Picks\nAura Cacia Organic Castor Oil| $14.99 / 16 ozMaker + Merchant Just Castor Oil| $22 / 4 ozAllpa Botanicals Castor Hair Oil| $27 / 2 oz\n2. Grapeseed Oil\nGrapeseed oil has been used for beauty, skin care, and natural health remedies for centuries. It’s made from leftover pressed grape seeds from winemaking, and many historians believe it was used for medicinal purposes in ancient Greece.\nWith its linoleic acid content (an omega 6 fatty acid to combat hair loss), this lightweight oil is ideal for long and luscious lashes. It also contains vitamin E, which is loved for its moisturizing and strengthening abilities.\nOur Picks\nNow Foods Grapeseed Oil| $10.99 / 16 ozMaker + Merchant Just Grapeseed Oil| $22 / 4 ozAllpa Botanicals Grapeseed Hair Oil| $27 / 2 oz\n3. Jojoba Oil\nJojoba oil is a golden liquid extracted from Jojoba seeds; the shrubby plant is native to the dry, southern regions of Arizona and California and parts of northwestern Mexico. The oil is loved for its abundance of rich vitamins and minerals, including vitamin E, which, as mentioned above, is essential for healing damaged hair.\nAs an eyelash enhancer, jojoba oil is a favorite because it moisturizes, protects follicles, and encourages growth. It has regenerative properties as well, and, when used loyally, it is said to gift longer and thicker lashes.\nOur Picks\nhttps://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7880526-12529075?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthrivemarket.com%2Fweb%2Fp%2Fnow-foods-jojoba-oil| $39.99 / 16 ozAllpa Botanicals Jojoba Hair Oil| $27 / 2 oz\n4. Aloe Vera\nAloe vera is one of those plants with a laundry list of health and skincare benefits, and it’s beloved for gifting lashes a natural shine. The gel even has antibacterial and antifungal properties to combat infections that may harm your hair and prevent growth. The best part is, many of us already have this lanky succulent growing in our homes. Here’s how to cut up and scoop the juice from the leaves.\nFor lash lifting, aloe vera gel is best used in conjunction with other oils—many DIY beauty bloggers recommend combining it with castor/jojoba oil, mixing one part oil with one part gel.\nOur Picks\nAubrey Organics Pure Aloe Vera Gel| $8.79 / 4 ozBeauty By Earth Aloe Vera Gel| $19.99 / 8 ozMountain Rose Herbs Aloe Vera Gel| $4.75 / 8 oz\nNatural & Eco-Friendly Products\n1.
