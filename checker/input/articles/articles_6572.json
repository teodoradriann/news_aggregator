    "text": "June 12, 2025\nLOS ANGELES: Protests over hardline immigration tactics ignited across the United States on Wednesday after days of demonstrations in Los Angeles, as California prepared for a legal showdown with the White House over US President Donald Trump’s deployment of the military.\nOver 1,000 people massed in America’s second biggest city for a sixth day of protests, with the crowd peaceful as they marched through the streets.\nA second night of curfew was expected as city leaders try to get a handle on the after-dark vandalism and looting that scarred a few city blocks in the 500-square-mile (1,300 square kilometres) metropolis.\n\"I would say for the most part everything is hunky dory right here at Ground Zero,\" protester Lynn Sturgis, 66, a retired school teacher, told AFP.\n\"Our city is not at all on fire, it’s not burning down, as our terrible leader is trying to tell you.\"\nThe mostly peaceful protests ignited over a sudden escalation in efforts to apprehend migrants who were in the country illegally.\nPockets of violence — including the burning of self-driving taxis and hurling stones at police — were nothing the 8,500 officers of the Los Angeles Police Department had not dealt with before.\nTrump won the election last year partly on promises to combat what he claims is an \"invasion\" by undocumented migrants.\nHe is now seizing the opportunity to make political capital, ordering the California National Guard to deploy despite Governor Gavin Newsom’s objections, the first time a US president has taken such action in decades.\n\"We’re going to have a safe country,\" he told reporters on his way into a theatre performance.\n\"We’re not going to have what would have happened in Los Angeles. Remember, if I wasn’t there... Los Angeles would have been burning to the ground.\"\nAround 1,000 of the 4,700 troops Trump deployed were actively guarding facilities and working alongside ICE agents, said Scott Sherman, Deputy Commanding General Army North, who is leading operations.\nThe rest — including 700 active duty Marines — were mustering or undergoing training to deal with civil disturbances, he said.\nThe Pentagon has said the deployment will cost taxpayers $134 million.\nGovernor Newsom, a Democrat, has charged that Trump is seeking to escalate the confrontation for political gain.\nHis lawyers were expected in court on Thursday to demand a temporary restraining order that would prevent troops from accompanying immigration officers as they arrest migrants.\nAdministration lawyers called the application a \"crass political stunt\".\nNewsom said the unprecedented militarisation would creep beyond his state’s borders.\n\"Democracy is under assault right before our eyes,\" he said on Tuesday. \"California may be first, but it clearly won’t end here.\"\nDespite Trump’s threats to deploy the National Guard to other Democratic-run states over the objections of governors, protesters appear undeterred.\nDemonstrations were reported in St Louis, Raleigh, Manhattan, Indianapolis and Denver.\nIn San Antonio, hundreds marched and chanted near city hall, reports said, where Republican Texas Governor Greg Abbott has deployed the state’s National Guard.\nA nationwide \"No Kings\" movement was expected on Saturday, when Trump will attend a highly unusual military parade in the US capital.\nThe parade, featuring warplanes and tanks, has been organised to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the founding of the US Army but also happens to be the day of Trump’s 79th birthday.\nThe Trump administration is painting the protests as a violent threat to the nation, requiring military force to support regular immigration agents and police.\nBut Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said the crisis had been manufactured in Washington.\n\"A week ago, everything was peaceful in the city of Los Angeles,\" she told reporters.\n\"Things began to be difficult on Friday when raids took place... that is the cause of the problems.\n\"This was provoked by the White House.\"\nArrests by masked and armed men continued on Wednesday.\nA pastor in the LA suburb of Downey said five armed men driving out-of-state cars grabbed a Spanish-speaking man in the church’s parking lot.\nWhen she challenged the men and asked for their badge numbers and names, they refused.\n\"They did point their rifle at me and said, ‘You need to get back,’\" Lopez told broadcaster KTLA.\nFootage seen by AFP shows what appears to be federal agents ramming a car in the Boyle Heights area of Los Angeles.\nSome kind of smoke device is deployed and masked men with assault weapons order a man from the car, leaving what witnesses said was his wife and children badly shaken.",

    "title": "TikTok ban news: Final days for TikTok? App faces ban in US as Jan. 19 deadline looms - The Economic Times",
    "text": "TikTok, the widely-used social media app owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, faces a critical decision from the US Supreme Court that could determine its future in the United States. Unless ByteDance sells TikTok to a US-based company by January 19, the platform could be removed from app stores and blocked by internet providers, as mandated by a bipartisan law signed by President Joe Biden in 2023.The legislation stems from growing concerns over national security, with lawmakers asserting that TikTok’s parent company could share sensitive user data with the Chinese government or use the platform to spread disinformation. ByteDance, however, has categorically denied these allegations, stating in an April 2023 statement, “ByteDance does not have any plans to sell TikTok,” calling the sale rumours untrue. Supreme Court to Hear Arguments on Free Speech and SecurityTikTok has challenged the law, filing an emergency motion claiming it violates the First Amendment and could result in substantial losses. The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear oral arguments on January 10. The central legal question revolves around whether the government’s concerns about national security justify overriding the First Amendment’s protections for free speech.Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, has supported the law, stating, The right to free speech enshrined in the First Amendment does not apply to a corporate agent of the Chinese Communist Party. In contrast, Jameel Jaffer, Executive Director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, criticised this perspective. “It is not the government’s role to tell us which ideas are worth listening to,” he argued.Efforts to Purchase TikTok’s US OperationsAmid these legal and political debates, several entrepreneurs have expressed interest in acquiring TikTok's US operations. One prominent bidder is Shark Tank investor Kevin O’Leary, who described the opportunity as about something much bigger: protecting the privacy of 170 million American users.” In a January 6 post on X (formerly Twitter), O’Leary added, “It’s about empowering creators and small businesses. And it’s about building a platform that prioritises PEOPLE over algorithms.”O’Leary revealed that his efforts would require collaboration with President-elect Donald Trump, who will assume office on January 20. “Trump will be who we have to work with to close the deal in the months ahead,” O’Leary said during a January 6 interview on Fox News. “So, I wanted to let him know—as well as others in his cabinet—that we’re doing this, and we’re going to need their help.”This case brings to light the delicate balance between free speech and national security, a debate the Supreme Court has addressed in past cases. In the landmark 2010 decision in Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, the Court upheld restrictions on speech linked to foreign entities deemed threats to national security, while also applying strict judicial scrutiny.Earlier cases, such as the 1971 Pentagon Papers decision, showed the Court’s reluctance to allow the government to suppress information, even in the name of security. Justice Hugo Black, in his concurrence, wrote, “The word ‘security’ is a broad, vague generality whose contours should not be invoked to abrogate the fundamental law embodied in the First Amendment.”This tension is further highlighted by differing opinions. A brief from the Knight First Amendment Institute argues that the law banning TikTok “is far more aggressive” than prior measures, as it outright prohibits access to the platform. On the other hand, Zephyr Teachout, a law professor at Fordham University, argues that regulating foreign ownership is distinct from restricting free speech. “The regulations are wholly concerned with the firms’ ownership, not the firms’ conduct, technology, or content,” Teachout noted.The Broader ImplicationsThe Supreme Court’s decision will carry far-reaching implications, not only for TikTok but for digital platforms operating in sensitive political contexts. With TikTok’s sophisticated algorithm providing personalised content to over 170 million US users, many of them young, its potential ban would mark the end of a cultural phenomenon.As legal arguments unfold, the case will serve as a litmus test for how governments can balance safeguarding national security while preserving the foundational principles of free expression in a globally connected digital era.",
