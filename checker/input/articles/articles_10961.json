    "text": "3 Min Read\nChina’s decision to reduce export rebates on solar modules and components, effective 1 December, is set to increase electricity tariffs in India, creating short-term challenges but potentially paving the way for long-term benefits.\nThe rebate for modules will drop from 13% to 9%, while ancillary components like aluminium and copper wires will lose rebates entirely.\n“The change in rebate from 13% to 9% would result in an increase in price at the module level by about 2–4 cents per watt-peak. For every one cent increase in module prices, tariffs are expected to rise by 6–7 paise, leading to an overall increase of 12–28 paise per unit of electricity,\" Sabyasachi Majumdar, Senior Director at CARE Ratings, explained.\nThis price hike will also affect existing contracts. “For contracts where a portion of modules arrive after December 1, the additional cost burden due to reduced rebates will likely be passed on by Chinese manufacturers, raising electricity generation costs for Indian developers,\" Saurabh Agarwal, Tax Partner at EY India, added.\nDependency on China continues\nIndia remains heavily dependent on China for solar cells, with an 80% reliance that is unlikely to decrease before 2027, when domestic capacities are expected to stabilise. Majumdar noted: “While module production is becoming largely domestic, our dependency on China for upstream components like wafers and polysilicon will persist for years.”\nDespite short-term difficulties, experts see a silver lining for Indian manufacturers. The rising cost of Chinese exports could enhance India’s global competitiveness. Agarwal remarked: “This aligns with India’s Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative, indirectly making Indian manufacturers more competitive as Chinese exports become costlier.”\nIndia’s solar exports have already seen remarkable growth. According to a recent JMK Research report, Indian PV module exports surged by over 23 times between FY2022 and FY2024. This growth positions India as a reliable alternative to Southeast Asian manufacturers, particularly as the US imposes strict tariffs on Chinese imports.\nBalancing domestic and export markets\nHowever, domestic supply remains under pressure. Module production is expected to reach 28GW by FY2025, falling short of the 30GW required to meet India’s renewable energy goals.\nMajumdar warned: “Balancing export growth and domestic demand is critical. Small-scale projects like rooftop solar, which have smaller order sizes, risk delays due to the supply-demand gap.”\nThe government is promoting localised production of wafers and ingots to mitigate dependency on imports. Experts believe long-term self-sufficiency will require sustained investments and targeted policies.\nAgarwal emphasised: “The measures taken by China indirectly support India’s ambitions to become a global solar hub, but ensuring adequate domestic supply remains a pressing priority.”\nThe rebate for modules will drop from 13% to 9%, while ancillary components like aluminium and copper wires will lose rebates entirely.\n“The change in rebate from 13% to 9% would result in an increase in price at the module level by about 2–4 cents per watt-peak.

    "title": "Zodiac killer ‘victim’ nurse last seen walking with blonde man near her home is identified after 37 years",
    "text": "A MISSING person who is believed to be connected to the Zodiac killer has been identified after almost 40 years. The Placer County Sheriff’s Office has announced that they were able to identify the remains of Donna Lass who went missing in 1971. Lass's skull was found on Highway 20 near the Sierra Nevada mountains In 1986. However, it was revealed that there was no ways to identify her at the time, leading to the skull being preserved until coroners were able to get access to more advanced technology, according to recent press release. Placer County Sheriff’s Office along with the Placer County District Attorney’s Office had decided to work together to create a cold case team, which would lead to their shocking discovery. The team was able to send the skull to the California Department of Justice Bureau of Forensic Services, where they were able to identify the DNA from a sample due to Lass's other family members. \"We are extremely grateful that this team effort was able to bring closure to the Lass family and are hopeful that cold case detectives can continue to make advances in these cases,\" the sheriff explained in the recent press release. At the time of her disappearance, she was 25 years old and just moved into her apartment in South Lake Tahoe, according to a news article shared by the police. She was last seen walking with a blond man who had not been identified. After she vanished police found her car, clothes, and bank account information. There has been speculation that Lass's disappearance had been connected to the Zodiac killer for years. In 1971, the San Francisco Chronicle received a strange postcard that had a symbol resembling the signature of the Zodiac Killer. The card had phrases such as “Sierra Club,” “Sought victim 12” and \"peek through the pines,\" and the words \"around in the snow,\" written upside down, The Sacramento Bee reported. This has led many to believe that Lass could have been murdered by the prolific killer, however authorites have not found proof of that just yet. As of now there is still a lot of unanswered questions surrounding the missing nurse's death. \"It hasn’t been proven to be a homicide at this point, but we’re obviously treating it that way,” South Lake Tahoe Police Chief David Stevenson told NBC affiliate KCRA .",

This approach promotes a sustainable and harmless environment through practices like crop rotation, cover crops, and balanced relationships between host and predator. Organic farming also recycles nutrients back into the soil through organic residues and composted manure. Organic crops have higher levels of antioxidants, such as polyphenolics, which reduce the risk of chronic diseases. These crops also have lower levels of toxic metals and minerals, such as cadmium, lead, and mercury, as well as lower concentrations of nitrogen, nitrate, and nitrite. Additionally, organic crops have fourfold less pesticide residue than conventional crops. The health-conscious consumer trend is driving the shift towards organic farming, leading to less use of agrochemicals. However, the increasing awareness of the benefits of organic farming may negatively impact the growth of the global crop protection chemicals market during the forecast period.

One of the nicest feelings ever.\"\nRuthe is a middle-distance runner and already broke several records this year, including becoming New Zealand's youngest senior national champion while setting a world record time for his age in a 3,000-meters race in February.\nHe won the 3,000-meters title during the New Zealand Track and Field Championships with a time of 7:56.18, CNN reported.\nRuthe also tied Tanner for first place to win a share of the senior national championship in a 1,500-meters race in March.\nRuthe's world-record mile run was more than three seconds faster than his prior best of 4:01.72, which he posted during the Cooks Classic in January.\nRuthe turns 16 in April, and his time in the mile on Wednesday also bested Tanner's prior under-20 and under-19 records of 3:58.41.\nBritain's Roger Bannister was the first human to break the four-minute barrier in the mile in 1954.\nCopyright 2025 UPI News Corporation.
