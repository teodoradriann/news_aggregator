    "text": "A presidential candidate in Ghana has vowed “no, no and no” on LGBTQ+ issues in the West African country.\nAddressing clergy at a campaign stop, vice-president Mahamudu Bawumia said of homosexuality, “We will not agree. Our religion says no, our culture says no, our values say no. So it is a no, no and no.”\nRelated:\n[Ghana’s parliament unanimously votes to criminalize LGBTQ+ identities & allyship]\nGhanaian legislators claim that homosexuality is a Western import, but that’s a lie.\nBawumia compared same-sex attraction to polygamy, saying the West’s rejection of the practice justified Africa’s repudiation of LGBTQ+ identity.\nGlobal perspectives delivered right to your inbox\nOur newsletter bridges borders to bring you LGBTQ+ news from around the world.\n“They don’t agree with polygamy. Do we force it on them? So they shouldn’t force it on us,” he said, speaking of LGBTQ+ acceptance.\nPolygamy is illegal in Ghana under civil law, but it’s not strictly enforced.\n“We will never accept it no matter the consequences,” he continued. “We will defend our values. And we will let the world know, we will not change our values for them.”\nPolygamy, the practice of having two or more spouses, is illegal in every U.S. state but widely accepted around the world, particularly in Muslim-majority countries where it’s common for men to have more than one wife.\nIt is generally illegal for women to enjoy more than one husband.\nIn February, Ghana’s Parliament\nvoted unanimously to approve a bill that would worsen criminal penalties for homosexuality and persecute LGBTQ+ people and their allies. The bill awaits a signature from outgoing President Nana Akufo-Addo and he’s vowed to sign it.\nThe Promotion of Proper Human Sexual Rights and Ghanaian Family Values Bill 2021 would increase the penalties for homosexuality from three years in prison to five. It would also make it a crime to identify as LGBTQ+ or as an ally, and punish anyone who provides support, advocacy, or funding for LGBTQ+ people’s rights.\nThe U.S. State Department has warned Ghana that\nthe legislation could jeopardize aid to the West African nation.\nThe country’s current law is a holdover from colonial times when the British occupied the small country on Africa’s Guinea Coast, and sexual acts between men were deemed “unnatural carnal knowledge.”\n ",

    "title": "Exclusive--Joe Kent: Iran's Proxies Have 'Definitely Infiltrated Our Wide Open' Border",
    "text": "Joe Kent, Republican candidate for Washington state’s 3rd district and retired Army Special Forces chief warrant officer 3, said in an exclusive interview that Iranian proxies that just killed three troops in Jordan have also “definitely infiltrated” into the U.S. through the unsecured southern border.\nHe called for the Biden administration to pull U.S. troops out of Iraq and Syria, where he said they were “sitting ducks” at the hands of the Iranian proxy militants that have attacked U.S. bases there over 160 times since October.\nHe said President Joe Biden needs to focus instead on “where our threats are” — the U.S.-Mexico border.\n“Iran fights by proxies. Their proxies have definitely infiltrated our wide open southern border,” Kent, who also worked for the CIA, said during the interview.\n“We can’t secure our own border. Iran has most certainly already penetrated our borders. We’ve got to get serious about securing our border and starting to track down, locate and deport all the people that have penetrated our borders,” he said.\n“The Democratic Party basically prioritizes the security and sovereignty of every other country other than the United States of America. And the Democrats have become the new war mongers,” he added. “They want to leave our troops exposed all throughout the Middle East, just waiting for us to get into a shooting war with Iran.”\n“They send billions and billions more to Ukraine, but the last thing they ever want to do is actually secure our borders. So she’s utterly failed on everything but most importantly, when it comes to securing our district and securing our country,” he said.\nHe said his Democrat opponent, Rep. Marie Glusenkamp Perez (D-WA), “refuses to secure our southern border, while fentanyl kills hundreds of our citizens here in Washington State, and killed over 118,000 American citizens in the country.”\nHe also said even though Perez ran as a moderate Democrat, she votes in lockstep with the Democratic Party.\n“Marie Perez voted to leave our troops in Iraq and in Syria and to continue these combat operations that were being supported by this outpost in Jordan. She voted to leave them there. And then she also voted against giving Israel any kind of funding or support while they were attempting to locate American hostages taken by Hamas,” he said.\n“She fully supports Biden’s agenda of giving Iran untold billions and billions of dollars, while at the same time voting to leave our southern border wide open in lockstep with the most radical wing of the Democrat party,” he said. “She is absolutely incapable of defending the country,” he said. “She does not understand national security and she is voting exactly how she’s told by the Democratic Party.”\nKent said while the United States needs to retaliate in response to the attack that killed the three American troops, going forward, the United States should pull troops out of vulnerable locations in Iraq and Syria to be attacked by Iran’s proxy forces.\n“We are playing directly into Iran’s hands. Never fight your enemy, according to their strength and according to their terms. But that’s what we’re doing here,” he said, adding, “Iran fights by proxy, whether it’s Iranian-backed militias in Iraq and Syria, the Houthis, Hezbollah, Hamas — this is how these guys fight. And in order for proxies to be effective, they need proximity to their targets. So by us leaving these small scattered outposts and even the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad within their range, we’re playing directly to their hands.\n“So I’ve been advocating for quite a while, let’s get our troops out of there. Let the Iranians declare victory and say, ‘Oh, we drove America out.’ Let them have that temporary victory. And then once our forces are out away from striking distance, then we can strike back against Iranian Quds Force officers, their special operators and against Iranian proxy groups in Iraq and Syria.”\nKent said he is against striking Iran’s mainland, since it would rally Iranians who are unhappy with the government around the Ayatollah. “If we go and do you know, Iraq war 2.0 in Iran and start bombing the Iranian regime on Iranian soil, that’s just going to rally the Iranian people around the Ayatollah.”\nHe also criticized Biden’s policies that have given Iran access to oil revenue, and noted that the U.S. currently pays Iraq “billions of dollars a year” that Iran directly controls. He said this means that the U.S. taxpayer is funding Iranian proxy forces to attack U.S. troops.\n“People need to understand that those militants are funded, trained and equipped by the Government of Iraq, which is funded, trained and equipped by the U.S. taxpayer,” he said.\n“So not only was it completely and totally tragic and avoidable and predictable, it’s also absolutely absurd and every American taxpayer should be absolutely furious about this situation that we’ve put ourselves in [in] the Middle East.”\nHe also said Biden’s energy policy of killing off energy production in the U.S. puts more money in the pockets of Iran. “Just the other day Biden froze LNG sales and a lot of ports in Texas, in Louisiana, making the top exporters of LNG Iran, Qatar, and Russia.\n“So we’ve got to get smart economically and diplomatically,” he said.\nFollow Breitbart News’s Kristina Wong on ”X” , Truth Social , or on Facebook .\n2024 Election Politics Congress Iran Iraq Joe Biden Joe Kent Marie Gluesenkamp Pérez On the Hill On The Hill Exclusive Video Syria U.S. House Washington State",

    "title": "Fishing Line: Favorable ice conditions forming in the Black Hills",
    "text": "For the ice fishing population, the weather gods have accomplished what hopeful hearts couldn’t: set up favorable ice conditions in much of the Black Hills’s area.\nThough daytime temps will hover around the freezing mark for the next week or so, nighttime temps will drop down into the teens over the weekend and single digits (and lower) by late next week adding additional ice.\nJudging by area fishing reports, anglers are taking advantage of the improving ice conditions by flocking to the safer upper elevation Black Hills lakes. And they're enjoying a modicum of success as catches of trout have been commonplace in the smaller lakes, while larger bodies of water have been offering up perch, pike and lakers.\nConditions have not been as favorable at the two larger prairie lakes. Orman has frozen over and does have some workable ice near the dam and docks (6 inches reported) though conditions are iffy elsewhere, and Angostura is largely unworkable at this time.\nPeople are also reading…\nDespite improving ice, hazardous spots do exist most everywhere and safety remains the primary concern of any ice fishing outing. Remembering always that in reality no ice, even seemingly safe clear, blue variety, is 100% safe.\nIce Thickness Recommendations\n3 inches--a single person on foot\n4 inches—group in a single file line\n7 1/2 inches—passenger car (2-ton gross)\n8 inches—light truck (2 ½-ton gross)\n10 inches—medium truck (3 1/2-ton gross)\n12 inches—heavy truck (8-ton gross)\nRecommended Safety Equipment\nSpud bar or chisel, ice picks, floating ice suit or life jacket, whistle, 50-100 feet of rope and a cell phone.\nArea Reports\nAngostura Reservoir: Conditions are the same as the last week. Recently formed ice is unsafe, and no fishing activity reported.\nBelle Fourche Reservoir (Orman): The lake is frozen over and does have some workable ice (6 inches or so) near the dam and dock area. Though activity has been scarce, one report told of walleye taken on minnows in the dam area.\nBlack Hills Steams: Trout have been active through Rapid Creek. Nymphs have been the presentation of choice.\nCenter Lake: Like other small high elevation Black Hills lakes, ice conditions are excellent and plenty of trout activity reported.\nDeerfield Lake: Good ice reported particularly in the Gold Run and Dutchman Campground areas. Perch are particularly active though some lake trout have been showing up on chubs and frozen smelt. Among the catches: a 35-inch specimen.\nIron Creek Lake: Safe ice and an excellent trout bite are reported.\nLakota Lake: Small perch have been active.\nLegion Lake: Trout have been feeding and there has reportedly been some pike activity as well.\nPactola Reservoir: The lake is frozen though only thick safe ice is likely to be found in bays. Jenny Gulch has seven-plus inches and has been producing a northern pike bite.\nRoubaix Lake: The lake has safe ice and likely trout activity though accessing the lake easily may be a problem.\nSheridan Lake: Lake is frozen though ice is unsafe in main lake. Reports indicate that the Chipper Bay area has been producing a steady perch bite—mostly small--on wax worms and small minnows. Crappie activity reported near Dakota Point on similar presentations.\nStockade Lake: The lake has been a popular spot with bluegill and pike bites reported in various locations.\nMissouri River: The river is still problematical at this point as open water conditions prevail in most locations other than in bays. Snowy conditions have added to the dismal prospects on the river thus far.\nScheduled Ice Fishing Tournaments\nWhitney Dock Ice Fishing Tournament: Jan. 20\nSheridan Lake Ice Derby: Jan. 28\nDakota Angler & Outfitter, 1010 Jackson Blvd., Rapid City; The Rooster, 1441 W. Main St., Rapid City; Wheel in Bait Shop, 18696 Fisherman’s Road, Fruitdale have contributed to this report.",

(Valley News Live) - Thursday, December 5, will be a day that Ali Moses, a student at the University of North Dakota, will remember for a long time.\nShe was chosen as the recipient of a Sanford Health scholarship that are awarded to veterans, Guard/Reserve members or active-duty military service members who have demonstrated leadership and commitment in their community.\n“It means so much to me, with especially the amount of it, and to get in from Sanford as I want to work for them in the future and it’s just a big accomplishment,” said Ali Moses, UND student.\nAli is currently working towards getting her degree in [Commercial Aviation.](https://und.edu/programs/commercial-aviation-bsaero/index.html) In 2022, Ali joined the Army National Guard for North Dakota, she also has experience in putting out wildfires, and is a member of Thompson’s Fire Department.\n“I joined when I was 14 since my dad was with the fire department and so was my sister as well, so that kind of started the emergency thing, and then my dad was also in the Army and so was my Grandpa so there was also some history with the Army,” said Moses.\nThe surprise celebration was actually suppose to take place on Tuesday, December 3, but it was canceled as Moses was called to assist with a structure fire in Manvel, North Dakota.

    "text": "[News](https://newsday.co.tt/category/news) Flash flooding in north, east, central after heavy rain [Yvonne Webb](https://newsday.co.tt/reporter/yvonne_webb) ROADS were turned into rivers on Thursday afternoon as a heavy downpour resulted in flash flooding in parts of North, East and Central Trinidad. The northbound lanes of the Uriah Butler Highway at Chaguanas as well as the eastbound lanes of the Churchill Roosevelt Highway near Macoya and parts of the Priority Bus Route at Tunapuna became nearly impassable as high tides prevented the run-off. The Disaster Management Unit (DMU) warned of traffic jams and asked motorists to be careful. The warning came a little too late as some motorists, caught unawares in the absence of any weather alerts from the Meteorological Office, tried to meander their way through the swirling flood waters. Fire officers were called to rescue a woman and her daughters from their car, which stalled in the flooded area near Eleanor Road and Market Street, Chaguanas. That Borough was one of the worst hit areas as knee-high water engulfed Caroni Savannah Road, near the corner of Medford Gas Station, IDC street, Endeavour Avenue, Xavier Street 10th Avenue and St Yves Street. Presentation College, Chaguanas, was also flooded out. Chaguanas mayor Faaiq Mohammed said cleaning and restoring the school will be the priority. “I think school is set to reopen on January 2. A disaster management team will be dispatched to the school on Friday to do an assessment. If it means we have to wash down the area, we will do so. Usually, when an area is flooded out, water seeps into the septic tanks, so we may have to assist with that as well.” He said he was surprised to see knee-high water in some parts of the Borough. He said he was first alerted to the floods when someone called for sandbags as the roads became impassable. “The rains fell in big drops consistently for about one and a half hours shortly after noon.” He said the volume of water overwhelmed the drains' capacity to store and move the water. Mohammed said debris got caught in WASA lines that hang low in the drains, clogging the free flow of water. He said he would soon be engaging WASA to either remove the lines or lift them to a higher level. Replacing old culverts and ensuring zero tolerance for littering, he said, are also on the agenda for 2024. Rural Development and Local Government Minister Faris Al-Rawi did not respond to calls from Newsday, but in a brief statement, the ministry strongly advised the public to exercise caution. Anyone affected by the floods is urged to contact their relevant DMU hotline, the statement said. Mohammed said there were a few incidents after the water ran off, but while cleaning areas where water seeped into some yards will have to be done, thankfully there were no major damage or incidents.",
