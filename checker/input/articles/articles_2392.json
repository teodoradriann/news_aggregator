    "text": "(Colonial Williamsburg Foundation) WILLIAMSBURG — Neil Handa from Henley Middle School in Crozet was named the first-place winner at the 2025 National Civics Bee Virginia State Finals competition hosted June 7 by The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation at the Art Museums of Colonial Williamsburg.\nHanda advances to compete against finalists from across the country at the National Civics Bee in Washington, D.C., Nov. 10-11.\nYousef Kiani from J. Lupton Simpson Middle School in Leesburg placed second, and Arianna McBride from Andrew Lewis Middle School in Salem placed third.\nAccording to the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, the National Civics Bee is an annual competition designed to inspire young Americans to engage in civics and contribute to their communities. A nonpartisan initiative of The Civic Trust of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation , it aims to enhance civic literacy, skills, and participation among students in 6th, 7th and 8th grades in participating states across the country.\nTo compete, middle school students submit an essay identifying issues within their community and solutions on how to solve them based on civic principles, according to the foundation. During the state finals, the students participated in three rounds of competition, including two live quiz events with questions on the U.S. Constitution, presented a summary of their essays, and answered questions from judges to test their knowledge.\n“It’s incredibly heartening to see young people embrace their responsibility to be civically engaged,” said Cliff Fleet, president and CEO of The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation. “The example set by Neil and his fellow competitors here in Williamsburg, where the ideals that shaped American democracy were debated over 250 years ago, should inspire all of us to be more active and informed citizens.”\nThe Colonial Williamsburg Foundation said that the Commonwealth’s involvement in the National Civics Bee is one of the many 2026 initiatives of the VA250 Education Steering Committee , led by Secretary of Education Aimee Guidera in partnership with the Virginia American Revolution 250 Commission and the Virginia Department of Education. These initiatives are designed to bring history to life, spark a civics renaissance, and celebrate democracy in the months leading up to America’s 250th anniversary, it added.\n“This event exemplifies the spirit of VA250 — educating, engaging, and inspiring the next generation,” said Sen. Mamie Locke, Vice Chair of the VA250 Commission. “This commemoration is as much about the future as it is about the past, and these students are shaping our future by demonstrating the knowledge, curiosity and civic engagement our democracy requires.”\nFourteen students advanced to the state competition as the top finalists in Civics Bee competitions that were held in April by the Greater Augusta Regional Chamber of Commerce, the Halifax County Chamber of Commerce, the Loudoun County Chamber of Commerce, the Louisa County Chamber of Commerce and the Roanoke Regional Chamber of Commerce Foundation.\n“We are so proud of the students who came together this weekend from across the state,” said Secretary Guidera. “These students bring to the state and national stage what Gov. Youngkin’s history and social science standards bring to the classroom … enthusiasm for civics and civic mindedness, and the inspiration to be more engaged citizens.”\nSecretary Guidera was a judge at this year’s state competition alongside Cathie Vick, President and CEO of the Virginia Chamber, and Rachel Williams, Civics Educator with the John Marshall Center for Constitutional History and Civics. Kurt Smith, who portrays Colonial Williamsburg Nation Builder Thomas Jefferson, served as emcee.\nMiddle School students from public, private, charter, and homeschools are invited to apply to the 2026 National Civics Bee using resources that will continue to populate here .

The committee will invite the Special Director General of Police for protection of women against atrocities, for the meetings.\nThe high-level committee has been mandated to review the government decisions for children’s safety taken from time to time. It will also review the safety measures in the schools, in surrounding areas of the schools and during the travel to the schools.\nMost importantly, it will give recommendations for the effective implementation of POCSO Act and any legislation for children’s safety brought about thereafter.\nThe Maharashtra government had formed a committee on August 23, soon after the Badlapur incident to look into the safety of the anganwadi, pre-primary and secondary school students. When the Bombay High Court had taken a suo motu cognisance of the matter, the government had informed the court about the formation of this committee.

    "text": "[La tensión mundial](https://heraldodemexico.com.mx/temas/tension-mundial-67564.html) por los conflictos armados en Ucrania, la Franja de Gaza y posiblemente en Taiwán ante el acecho de China, comienzan a preocupar al mundo por lo que podría generar, haciendo recordar los sucesos de la primera y segunda Guerra Mundial del siglo XX, hechos que el considerado “Nuevo Nostradamus”, Kushal Kumar, a vaticinado como una posibilidad que está más cerca de lo que se piensa. En ese sentido, la posibilidad del surgimiento de la Tercera Guerra Mundial toma fuerza por la profecía realizada por el “Nuevo Nostradamus”, el astrólogo nacido en la India que basa sus predicciones al leer los mapas de nuestros karmas, quien afirmó que durante este 2024, se desataría un conflicto armado en el planeta.

Kushal Kumar dice ser un astrólogo que tiene el don de predecir los acontecimientos mundiales y lo hace a través de la carta astrológica védica basada en la cultura hindú donde se mira una especie de “mapa de nuestro karma” que percibe al utilizar la alineación planetaria y estelar, señala el Daily Star. Por lo anterior, el “Nuevo Nostradamus” afirmó que sería durante este 2024 cuando el mundo volvería a estar en guerra con la participación de varias naciones, fecha que están más cercanas. Al respecto, el vidente indicó citado por el medio. ¿Cuándo inicia la Tercera Guerra Mundial? “Se predijo que 2024 sería muy preocupante en relación con las condiciones de guerra en los puntos críticos de todo el mundo, particularmente alrededor del 8 de mayo; se indicó que traería la mayor escalada en frentes de guerra como Corea, China-Taiwán, el Medio Oriente que involucra a Israel y En otros países de Oriente Medio y Ucrania-Rusia, la ira hacia la OTAN también podría encontrar expresión”, dijo. De manera que Kushal Kumar precisó: \"Ahora, el martes 18 de junio de 2024 tiene el estímulo planetario más fuerte para desencadenar la Tercera Guerra Mundial, aunque el 10 y 29 de junio también pueden tener voz y voto\", acotó el oráculo de la India.",

De hecho, el golero sigue firme en la convocatoria de su país y afronta certámenes de alto nivel con rivales de jerarquía.\n\"Es un partido de difícil pronóstico, porque Sporting Cristal está bien en su país y vemos que el arquero boliviano está muy bien, en buen nivel. Esperemos que Bolívar lo haga mejor y haga respetar la localía\", expresó el hincha.\n(VIDEO: TiGO Sports)\nHinchas de Bolívar dudan de un buen resultado de Bolívar ante Sporting Cristal\nDentro de las entrevistas a los aficionados bolivianos, algunos aseguran que ambos no se encuentran en gran nivel para este choque de Copa Libertadores.

    "text": "Escándalos Conoce a Sebastián, hijo de Mary Paz Banquells que NIEGA a Alfredo Adame como su padre | FOTOAdemás de peleas callejeras y enfrentamientos con otras celebridades, el actor también tiene diferencias con su propia familia Es bien sabido que Alfredo Adame ha tenido enfrentamientos con propios y extraños, sin embargo, dichos problemas también se han presentado con sus familiares, incluso Sebastián Adame, hijo de Mary Paz Banquells , que niega al actor como su padre debido a todos los escándalos que lo han rodeado en los últimos años. Alfredo Adame llegó a ser uno de los actores más cotizados de México, lo que lo llevó a ser modelo de diversas marcas y hasta conductor de televisión, no obstante, ha pasado bastante tiempo desde que se habla más de sus pleitos que de sus trabajos profesionales, situación que también lo ha llevado a alejarse de su familia. El actor no solamente ha tenido enfrentamientos frente a cámaras y en plena vía pública, sino que también dentro de su propio hogar, pues hace años se separó de su esposa Mary Paz Banquells en medio del escándalo, ya que la acusó a ella y a su familia de \"ladrones\" y “mantenidos”. Pero por si fuera poco, el también conductor tampoco tiene una buena relación con sus hijos, principalmente Sebastián. Este es el motivo principal por el que Sebastián Adame niega a Alfredo Adame como su padre En declaraciones para el programa 'El minuto que cambió mi destino', Mary Paz Banquells dijo que Alfredo Adame rechazaba a su hijo Sebastián por su homosexualidad, que en conjunto con los problemas familiares, terminaron por alejarlos completamente al punto de que el joven niega al actor como su padre. “Él (Alfredo Adame) rechazó a mi hijo por su homosexualidad y pues definitivamente... Yo a mi hijo lo amo por el ser humano que es, no amo su preferencia sexual, amo al ser humano y mi hijo para mí es importante y yo doy la vida entera por mi hijo”, dijo la exesposa del actor en el programa de televisión. Aunque hace unos años, Sebastián llegó a mencionar que no le tenía rencor a Alfredo Adame, con el paso del tiempo su perspectiva ha cambiado radicalmente, principalmente por los escándalos, peleas callejeras y enfrentamientos con otras celebridades en las que se ha involucrado el también conductor. “Quiera o no es mi papa, desafortunadamente, yo creo que lo dije alguna vez en una de mis historia, mi papá se murió hace mucho, lo que está ahorita con su cara no es mi papá, entonces si bien sí me da tristeza, pero la verdad ya también no hago caso a comentarios que hace porque, repito, no es mi papá y es alguien que no conozco”, ha señalado Sebastián. Alfredo Adame y Mary Paz Banquells procrearon durante su matrimonio a tres hijos: Alejandro, Diego y Sebastián. Actualmente, este último tiene 23 años y en su cuenta de Instagram indica que es Chef, Gamer y está incursionando en el mundo del doblaje. Al contrario del alejamiento que ha tenido con su padre, el joven es muy allegado a su mamá y ha compartido en sus redes sociales varias fotos junto a ella.",

    "title": "Nintendo remove quase 20 anos de conteúdo de clássico mod",
    "text": "A\nNintendo\nnovamente mostrou que não tem medo de usar seus advogados para proteger suas propriedades intelectuais, dessa vez indo para cima de um dos títulos que estava há mais tempo na Steam. Garry's Mod\n, jogo que permite que jogadores inventem o que bem entenderem, recebeu uma notificação para tirar do ar conteúdo que estava lá há 20 anos relacionado à empresa japonesa.\nGarry's Mod é um jogo sandbox desenvolvido pela Facepunch Studios, em que o jogador pode utilizar vários elementos para manipular e criar vídeos ou o que bem entender. Lançado em 2006 na Steam, o game tem diversos itens e elementos que foram enviados pelos jogadores, sendo que vários deles são de propriedades de outras empresas, como a Nintendo, que depois de tanto tempo, não gostou muito da ideia.\nNintendo não perdoa nada\nJogadores começaram a notar que elementos da oficina de Garry's Mod , onde ficam os add-ons para baixar, estavam sumindo. Não demorou muito para que o próprio Facepunch Studios fizesse um pronunciamento dentro da Steam.\n-\nBaixe nosso aplicativo para\niOS\ne Android\ne acompanhe em seu smartphone as principais notícias de tecnologia em tempo real.\n-\n\"Alguns de vocês devem ter notado que certos itens da oficina relacionados à Nintendo foram recentemente removidos. Isso não foi um erro, essas remoções foram uma solicitação da Nintendo\", confirmou o representante do estúdio.\n\"Honestamente, isso é justo. Isso é conteúdo da Nintendo e o que eles permitem ou não é um direito deles. Eles não querem vocês jogando com as coisas deles em Garry's Mod — essa é uma decisão deles, vamos respeitar e remover tudo o que pudermos.\"\nO Facepunch Studios concluiu informando que esse processo deve demorar um tempo, já que são praticamente 20 anos de conteúdos que eles precisam revisar para remover. O estúdio pede aos fãs que subiram itens relacionados à Nintendo que os deletem e nunca mais os enviem para a oficina novamente, já que isso os ajudaria bastante.\nAdvogados da Nintendo não param de trabalhar\nA Nintendo é bastante conhecida por ter o \"dedo nervoso\" para pedir a visita do amigo processinho a todos aqueles que usam de alguma forma suas propriedades intelectuais. Apesar de alguns casos parecerem mais justos, como a situação com os desenvolvedores do emulador Yuzu, que emulava jogos de\nNintendo Switch\n. Os desenvolvedores receberam uma multa de mais de US$ 2 milhões e o emulador e seus servidores vêm sendo eliminados da internet.\nOutros casos beiram o absurdo, como o caso contra o programador canadense Gary Bowser, de 54 anos, que foi preso e deve pagar até 30% de seu salário mensal para a Nintendo para cobrir danos avaliados em 14 milhões de dólares. Gary era parte de um grupo que distribuía ROMs de jogos da Nintendo.\nDe acordo com uma entrevista ao jornal The Guardian\n, ele afirma que não estava envolvido com a distribuição e só fazia manutenção do site.\nBowser ficou preso de fevereiro de 2022 até o início de 2024, mas já aceitou que pagará sua dívida para a Nintendo pelo resto de sua vida. A empresa japonesa teve um lucro líquido de US$ 1.85 bilhão em 2023.\nLeia a matéria no\nCanaltech\n.\nTrending no Canaltech:\n-\nPlaca Mercosul: Uruguai usa gambiarra para incluir cidade\n-\nExclusivo | Carro a hidrogênio da GWM chega em 2025\n-\nObjeto atinge estação espacial da China e causa apagão\n-\nJoe Biden sanciona lei que pode banir TikTok nos EUA\n-\nUbuntu 24.04 LTS é liberado; veja as principais novidades\n-\nDeadpool 3 | Novas imagens revelam visual completo e perfeito do Wolverine",
