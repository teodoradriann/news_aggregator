    "title": "3 Best Intermediate Exercises for a Stronger and More Attractive Chest",
    "text": "Strengthening the chest is essential for functional fitness, athletic performance, and achieving a balanced, aesthetically pleasing upper body.\nFor intermediate lifters, chest exercises should focus not only on muscle growth but also on enhancing muscle definition and symmetry. In this article, we’ll explore three of the best exercises tailored for intermediate-level lifters aiming for a stronger, more attractive chest. Each exercise is supported by scientific research to maximise muscle recruitment, hypertrophy, and progressive overload.\nLet’s delve into these intermediate exercises and discuss how they can significantly enhance your training routine.\nTable of contents Why Chest Training is Important Exercise 1: Incline Dumbbell Press Why it Works How to Perform Science-Backed Benefits Exercise 2: Dumbbell Flyes Why it Works How to Perform Science-Backed Benefits Exercise 3: Cable Crossover Why it Works How to Perform Science-Backed Benefits Implementing These Exercises into Your Routine Conclusion Key Takeaways Bibliography Why Chest Training is Important A well-developed chest is crucial for functional and aesthetic reasons. The pectoralis major, pectoralis minor, and surrounding stabilising muscles contribute to arm mobility, pushing strength, and shoulder stability.\nThe National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA) highlights that a robust chest also reduces the risk of shoulder injuries (Baechle & Earle, 2008). Beyond functionality, a strong chest conveys an attractive, balanced physique that symbolises strength and power. A structured chest workout routine can lead to substantial gains in both strength and aesthetics for intermediate lifters.\nExercise 1: Incline Dumbbell Press Why it Works The incline dumbbell press targets the upper portion of the pectoralis major, a region that is often underdeveloped in most gym-goers. This exercise is more effective for upper chest hypertrophy than the flat bench press, as shown in a study published in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research (Trebs et al., 2010). The incline dumbbell press emphasises muscle fibre recruitment in the clavicular head, which is essential for chest thickness and overall upper body symmetry.\nHow to Perform Set an adjustable bench to a 30-45 degree incline. Research indicates that this angle provides optimal upper chest activation while minimising shoulder strain (Saeterbakken & Fimland, 2013). Hold a dumbbell in each hand, resting them at chest level. Press the weights upward in a controlled motion, fully extending your elbows at the top without locking them. Slowly lower the dumbbells to the starting position to maximise eccentric loading. Science-Backed Benefits Incline pressing movements recruit the pectoralis major’s upper fibres more effectively than flat or decline presses. A study comparing muscle activation during different bench angles found that the 30-degree incline bench had the highest electromyographic (EMG) activity for the clavicular portion of the pectoralis major (Glass & Armstrong, 1997). Incorporating this movement into your routine will strengthen your upper chest, enhancing the balance and aesthetics of your entire torso.\nExercise 2: Dumbbell Flyes Why it Works Dumbbell flyes isolate the pectoralis major by reducing tricep involvement, which is common in pressing exercises. This isolation allows for a full stretch across the muscle fibres, leading to increased hypertrophy. Research suggests that exercises with greater muscle stretch, such as flyes, lead to significant gains in muscle size and strength due to the tension applied across a broader range of motion (Ogborn & Schoenfeld, 2014).\nHow to Perform Lie flat on a bench, holding a dumbbell in each hand above your chest with your arms slightly bent. Slowly lower the weights to your sides, maintaining the bend in your elbows to reduce shoulder strain. Once you feel a stretch in your chest, bring the dumbbells back together at the top in a controlled motion, keeping tension on the chest. Science-Backed Benefits Studies indicate that exercises with a larger range of motion, such as dumbbell flyes, enhance muscle hypertrophy due to increased mechanical tension across the fibres (McMahon et al., 2014). When paired with compound movements, flyes can promote balanced muscle development and reduce the risk of imbalances. Additionally, dumbbell flyes place less strain on the shoulder joint compared to barbell presses, making them an ideal choice for those prone to shoulder injuries.\nExercise 3: Cable Crossover Why it Works The cable crossover allows for constant tension throughout the movement, a key component in muscle growth. Unlike dumbbell or barbell exercises where resistance can vary through the range of motion, cables maintain consistent tension, which enhances time under tension. A study in the Journal of Applied Biomechanics found that cable exercises increased pectoral activation compared to traditional dumbbell and barbell exercises (Schick et al., 2010).\nHow to Perform Position the cable pulleys above shoulder height and grab a handle in each hand. Step forward and pull the cables downwards and across your body in a sweeping arc, bringing your hands together at hip level. Squeeze the chest at the end of the movement and slowly return to the starting position to maximise tension. Science-Backed Benefits Cable exercises like the crossover offer a unique advantage by providing consistent tension through both the concentric and eccentric phases. Research demonstrates that consistent tension, especially in the eccentric phase, leads to greater muscle fibre recruitment and metabolic stress, both of which are key drivers of muscle growth (Schoenfeld, 2010). Moreover, cable crossovers allow for more movement control, making them suitable for intermediate lifters aiming to refine their chest aesthetics without risking injury.\nImplementing These Exercises into Your Routine These exercises work best when combined into a comprehensive chest workout, performed 1-2 times per week to allow for adequate recovery. Aim for 3-4 sets of 8-12 reps, ensuring that each set is performed with proper form to prevent injury and maximise hypertrophy.\nIncline Dumbbell Press : 3-4 sets of 8-10 reps Dumbbell Flyes : 3-4 sets of 10-12 reps Cable Crossover : 3-4 sets of 10-12 reps Incorporate progressive overload by gradually increasing the weight, reps, or time under tension as you advance. This approach stimulates continual growth and adaptation, optimising your efforts and results in the gym.\nConclusion For intermediate lifters, targeted exercises such as the incline dumbbell press, dumbbell flyes, and cable crossover can offer unparalleled benefits for chest development. These exercises, backed by scientific research, enhance muscle activation, hypertrophy, and balance, resulting in a stronger, more attractive chest. Incorporate these movements into your routine consistently, prioritising proper form and progressive overload for optimal results.\nKey Takeaways Exercise Main Benefits Recommended Sets & Reps Incline Dumbbell Press Targets upper chest for balanced development 3-4 sets of 8-10 reps Dumbbell Flyes Enhances muscle stretch and hypertrophy 3-4 sets of 10-12 reps Cable Crossover Maintains constant tension for growth 3-4 sets of 10-12 reps",

    "title": "Australia's Nations Cup clash with Uganda will bring Mary Cholhok and Sunday Aryang together for a unique meeting",
    "text": "Both Aryang and Cholhok fled war-torn countries as children for a new life. (Getty: Misha Jordaan)\nIt’s a new year and there’s a new challenge on the horizon for our Australian netball team at the inaugural Nations Cup, where among their usual competitors – England and New Zealand – the side will also play Uganda for the very first time.\nRanked seventh globally, the She Cranes finished at the World Cup in August higher than any other African team, beating South Africa to claim fifth place.\nThose efforts have seen them receive the call-up to face the top three international teams in the new-year window typically reserved for the Quad Series, which features the Proteas instead.\nThe Diamonds’ desire to play African teams more often was a topic of conversation during their World Cup-winning campaign in Cape Town, where head coach Stacey Marinkovich spoke about the continuous need to test her netballers against a diverse range of playing styles.\nThis significance of the Nations Cup is therefore not lost on defender Sunday Aryang, whose parents fled Ethiopia when she was a one-year-old to escape the civil war, and 20 years later, watched on as their daughter became the first African-born Diamond.\n“I’m super proud and excited to see Australia come up against Uganda, they’ve come such a long way,” Aryang told ABC Sport.\n“Even just from watching the She Cranes a couple of years ago, now seeing the way they’re playing, they’ve come so far and done so well.\n“It’s going to be a great challenge for us, obviously with our hard, one-on-one style of defence and just letting the ball go, it is a big change when you face someone like Uganda because you’re not used to having to get so low to hunt for the ball.\n“We’re very used to flying high and getting up to try and win the ball back, so it’s good to face another style and opponent, it makes it interesting.”\nAryang has never been back to Ethiopia to visit her extended family since moving to Perth, but in 2023 she finally returned to Africa, first for the January Quad Series and later the World Cup.\nEthiopia doesn’t currently have a national netball team, but the idea of one day helping the country get a side together and potentially even coaching them has definitely crossed Aryang’s mind.\n“It’s been hard to get everyone in our immediate family here in Australia on the same schedule and organise a trip back, because we all want to go together so our mum can play tour guide,” she said.\n“I understand the language but I’m not as strong as her, and she knows all the places to go.”\nOne of the biggest names set to feature in the Nations Cup is Ugandan shooter Mary Cholhok, who has a similar story to Aryang.\nOriginally from South Sudan, Cholhok’s family fled to Uganda as refugees to escape civil war and hoping to find a fresh start, after her father died when she was six.\nBeyond her role in the She Cranes’ impressive run at the World Cup, Cholhok was also the top scorer in the UK Netball Super League last year for a third time (2019, 2021, 2023); shooting 808 goals during the regular season to lead the Loughborough Lightning to its second title.\nAlthough Aryang is unlikely to match up directly at goal keeper against Cholhok, the pair may still cross paths in the circle at some point during the Nations Cup.\n“I’m looking forward to coming up against her, she’s been doing amazing.\n“I’ve watched her play a couple of times and I’ve seen her on socials and she is definitely killing it … I think the Super Netball league here in Australia is something she could slot into one day if she keeps working hard and putting herself out there.\n“It would be amazing to be able to see a few more African athletes in our competition and as their national programs get better like Uganda’s has, it gives the players more of an opportunity to be seen and be able to be picked up.\n“Even for African immigrants like me living in Australia, that’s something that I always talk to my sister about … hopefully being able to see a lot more young African people in our country make it through the pathways and do amazing things across a range of sports.”\nIf Cholhok was to one day make her Super Netball debut, she’d be following in the footsteps of former She Cranes captain and fellow shooter Peace Proscovia, who will be at the Nations Cup with the national team in a coaching capacity.\nProscovia played three years with the Sunshine Coast Lightning (2019-2021) and there have been several South Africans that have also appeared in the league, although that number has drastically dropped off in the past two seasons.\nFor Cholhok, to one day play in Australia and get a crack at the controversial super shot is a dream that she has earmarked, whilst also not being in any rush to fulfil.\n“I’m just in this phase of life where I go with the flow,” Cholhok told ABC Sport.\n“Yes, for sure I want to play in Australia, but could it be today? I could just jump on a plane and play, but I personally don’t feel like I’m quite ready.\n“When the time comes, I just want to be as great as I can be with nothing holding me back and I feel like the UK league has helped me grow so much as a person to be more confident.\n“It’s the super shot that’s pulling me, I know there’s a lot of mixed feelings about the rule, but I just love the whole idea, it’s fun.”\nJust like Aryang has been watching Cholhok, Cholhok has also been keeping an eye on Aryang’s movements with the Australian team.\n“I don’t know her personally, but I know that she’s from Africa and a similar background,” she said.\n“I’m really excited to have a conversation or a chat with her, and also to just see her shine.”\nIn preparation, Uganda recently played the Welsh Feathers where, after losing the first match by 12 goals, they showed significant improvement to win the last two matches and clinch the series.\nNow, the She Cranes have set themselves a target to upset at least two of their opponents at the Nations Cup in the hope of proving how far they can go if given an opportunity.\nThe team are significantly underfunded compared to the other big three, but Cholhok says her side are focused on the experience itself rather than result – particularly against the Diamonds.\n“We have huge respect for Australia and for us, it’s not about winning or losing, it’s the whole experience and the added growth we’ll get, so that’s what I’m most excited about as an individual, but as a country it just means so much.\n“After the World Cup we received so many positive messages from people back home and we just hope that through our performances we can inspire the next generation and push the game to new areas when it comes to prioritising the standards for player welfare.\n“We hope we can open a lot of doors for netball in Uganda, because our success is making people question the funds our sport receives and helping us fight for what we deserve, better investment for our sport in our country.”\nThe Nations Cup begins with two days’ play in London, before continuing a week later in Leeds.\nNations Cup Fixtures: Saturday, 20 January: Australia v New Zealand – 2am AEDT\nSunday, 21 January: England v Australia — 3:15am AEDT\nSaturday 27 January: Australia v Uganda – 2am AEDT\nSunday, 28 January: Third-place play-off – 1am AEDT\nSunday, 28 January: Final — 3:15am AEDT",

Estoy interesada en firmar un canje con ustedes, vi que hacen postres muy bonitos y justo se acerca el cumple de mi hermana menor”, fueron las primeras palabras de la influencer en su mensaje. Pero eso no fue todo, porque lo más increíble vino después. “Quisiera 50 unidades de alfajores, 50 mini brownies y 30 chocotejas de Hello Kitty. Si puedo elegir el diseño de los alfajores estaría mejor”, agregó. Polémica Pero la polémica vino por el canje y el cambio que ofreció para recibir los productos. Los pasteles los quería a cambio de unas simples historias de Instagram: “Podría etiquetarlos y así más gente les compre. Si desean enviar algún postre extra también los mencionaría y puedo agregar un código de descuento de mi parte“, ofreció. “¿Esos influencers sabrán que las marcas deben contactarlos y no al revés?“; “Y quiere escoger el diseño de los alfajores“; “Te quería pedir 130 postres por dos historias, ni se compara“, fueron algunas de las respuestas de apoyo hacia la emprendedora en el viralizado video.",

    "text": "I guess it’s a bit of a story about the (little) independent film who could, as Ash and Bone launched a “story and character driven film” onto the film festival circuit in early 2022 and by the time of release it had won Mindfield, Paris Play, Top Indie Film Awards, WSXA, and The Indie Gathering among others including over 30 Nominations,and is currently at 88% Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes\nAsh and Bone was produced by Painted Creek Productions and Cama Productions with Kaiti Wallen, Annette Cama & Joe Williamson.\nAsh and Bone was released with fanfare October 4th 2022 and quickly became one of the hottest horror films of the year, trending as one of the Most Popular on Amazon Ptime, Tubi, Vudu and more it will now go to Screambox and Kanopy for 2024.\nWe caught up with Wallen to ask him if he had any idea Ash and Bone would take off the way it has? “Obviously no one knows what will happen when you make a film, I try to be as subjective as I can and make a film I want to see then hopefully enough people like me find it and enjoy it.” Wallen said. “I definitely felt everyone believing in what we were doing on set, we had our cast and crew fired up!”\nSince the release of Ash and Bone Wallen has kept busy with the release of “The Devil’s Left Hand” a supernatural Horror/Thriller and the recent release of “Beneath Us All” a Viking Vampire origin story and both seem to be following in the footsteps of Ash and Bone.\nAfter making such a wide range of genre films the last three have been (although different sub genres) horror movies and we asked if that was by design? “I’ve always been a horror fan and love watching well crafted horror movies, but I am really enjoying this especially as I think I have a bit of a unique spin on horror especially from the independent perspective by prioritizing the story, the characters and the acting performances.”\nAs an emerging Director in the Horror genre it seems there is an ever growing audience who like seeing his films and I wouldn’t be surprised to see more of Wallen’s films going mainstream as well as catch the eye of casual horror fans with his approach.\nAsh and Bone will be available on Screambox and Kanopy in January 2024.",

    "text": "As announced in September , Google Wallet is starting to test the ability to make digital IDs with US passports. It can be used as some TSA checkpoints.\nOpen the “Add to Wallet” menu for the renamed “ID” option that sees “U.S. Passport (beta)” join the existing “Driver’s license or state ID” option.\nThis three-step process starts by taking a picture of your passport info page that has your picture (or entering that informational manually), and then scanning the security chip found inside the back cover of your passport:\nPlace your passport on a flat surface. Open the back cover of your passport. To scan, remove your phone case. To find the chip, slowly move the back of your phone around the inside back cover.\nAfterwards, you need to send a brief video of your face. Google will “review the video to make sure you’re a real person, and compare the video to your passport photo to make sure you’re the owner of the passport.”\nThis passport option in Google Wallet is appearing for users enrolled in the Google Play services beta . It requires Android 9+ and is only available in the US for domestic flights at select airports. You can use NFC to send the information to the reader, with users asked to “Review the shared info” and “Continue” or “Cancel.”\nLike with state IDs, you’re able to remove your ID pass online remotely if your phone is ever lost.\nMore on Google Wallet: Google Wallet rolls out Quick Settings Tile on Samsung phones Google Wallet purchases get a new notification icon Google Wallet improves Wear OS app and expands website, Gmail integration",

    "text": "Tradición y devoción. Es lo que movió una vez más a Leopoldina Gonzabay, de 63 años, a levantarse a las 06:30 y acudir a la iglesia Nuestra Señora de la Alborada para participar de la procesión este viernes, 29 de marzo. Ella es una fiel seguidora de la romería del Cristo del Consuelo, pero en este año, por una lesión en la cadera, decidió asistir a la caminata del norte por la distancia del recorrido. ”No me caminaré, como lo he hecho en los últimos 30 años, la procesión del Cristo del Consuelo, pero haré esta en el norte con la misma devoción de siempre”, dijo Gonzabay, quien escribió en un papel -que amarró a un cuadro del Sagrado Corazón de Jesús- sus peticiones. Publicidad Ella en este año elevó su plegaria por la sanación de su cadera y del cáncer de seno que padece una hermana. La mujer caminó lento con un bastón en la mano izquierda. Un mar de feligreses copó por completo la av. Rodolfo Baquerizo Nazur, cerca de las 07:00. Desde la iglesia Nuestra Señora de la Alborada partió una de las tradicionales procesiones del norte de la urbe. Publicidad En este año, cinco parroquias se unieron a esta romería: Nuestra Señora de La Alborada, Rosa Mística, San Miguel de Arcángel, Santa Isabel y Nuestra Señora de Czestochowa. Alrededor de la imagen del Jesús Crucificado se formó un cordón de seguridad, en el que se ubicaron los representantes de cada una de las parroquias. Publicidad Quienes asisten portan sus ofrendas: flores y rosas rojas y blancas, cruces, estampas, rosarios y cirios encendidos que elevan con devoción en cada una de las estaciones. Cada uno de los fieles llegó con un pedido en mente. En su mayoría, las oraciones se elevan por la salud, por el bienestar de la familia y por la paz. También llegaron portando gorras, sombrillas y ropa con manga larga, para protegerse del sol. #ViernesSanto Procesión del Norte se desarrolla este Viernes Santo en el sector de La Alborada. Informan Priscilla Alvarado y José Beltrán.Publicado por [El Universo]en Viernes, 29 de marzo de 2024 El dolor de rodillas que aqueja a Lourdes Ibáñez, de 71 años, no impidió que acudiese a la peregrinación de este viernes, 29 de marzo. Publicidad La mujer vestía una camiseta blanca y en la mano izquierda un bastón. La caminata la hizo sola en los primeros metros hasta que se le unieron sus nietos y sobrinos.” Yo dije que quería caminar los primeros metros sola, sin ayuda como forma de penitencia y para pedir por mi salud, pedir por mis rodillas. Ya ahora en el resto de la procesión me tomarán de las manos mis nietos y sobrinos más jóvenes y terminaremos todo el recorrido”, dijo Ibáñez, quien llegó desde la ciudadela Los Rosales, norte de la urbe. Mientras avanza la caminata, el eco de un megáfono se extendía por cada cuadra, contagiando a los fieles con cánticos y oraciones. La peregrinación se inició con el rezo del Dios te salve y el padrenuestro. Alicia Enríquez, quien es moradora de la Alborada, dijo que esta muestra de fe le brindará la fuerza para lidiar con las malas noticias que a diario aquejan a Guayaquil. “Hay que pedir por la paz de Guayaquil, del país, hay que pedir mucho para que todo mejore. Hay que pedir por la paz que es lo que más necesitamos”, dijo. La romería, que tomará de dos a dos horas y media, recorrerá las avenidas Rodolfo Baquerizo Nazur, Jaime Roldós Aguilera, Isidro Ayora, Antonio Parra y José María Roura. En esta última se ubica el santuario de San Miguel de Arcángel, en donde se realizará la última estación del viacrucis y se dará un mensaje a los fieles. El párroco Luis Pólit dijo que esta tradicional romería tiene la intención de elevar plegarias por la seguridad y por la paz del país. “El mensaje es que haya paz en la ciudad, paz en el país y que este tiempo sea de reflexión para todos”, manifestó. En diferentes puntos de la avenida principal de la Alborada se ubicaron miembros de la Agencia de Tránsito y Movilidad (ATM) para bloquear el tránsito vehicular a medida que avanza la romería. Se ubicaron, además, personas que forman parte del grupo organizador de la procesión para dar soporte a aquellas personas que puedan sufrir deshidratación. (I)",
