    "text": "Fashion, oh fashion! It’s like a never-ending game of dress-up, where each era tries to outdo the last in the battle of style supremacy. But let’s be real here, not all trends are winners. In fact, some of them are as appealing as wearing a pineapple on your head while riding a unicycle. Get ready to question humanity’s taste level, my stylish comrades!\n1. Saggy Pants Editorial credit: Page Light Studios / Shutterstock.com\nThe trend of sagging pants gained popularity among men and, surprisingly, even some women. This style involves wearing trousers incredibly low on the waist, often exposing a significant amount of underwear. While loose-fitting pants have become a recent fad, the original intention behind saggy pants was not to showcase undergarments. Many fashion experts consider this trend ludicrous, insulting, obscene, and indecent.\n2. Powdered Wigs Editorial credit: AJR_photo / Shutterstock.com\nIn the 19th century, wigs made from human hair, goat hair, horsehair, and even wool became a fashion statement. The powder was used to style and give these wigs a glossy appearance. It helped prevent excessive sweating during hot summer months and neutralized the odor of hair grease. Powdered wigs were primarily worn to display wealth and social status. Today, they are mostly seen as part of costume competitions and are often viewed as humorous relics of the past.\n3. Foot Binding Editorial credit: Yu Zhang / Shutterstock.com\nFoot binding was a practice that was prevalent in ancient China. It involved tightly wrapping the feet of young girls, usually between the ages of 4 and 9, in order to deform them and keep them small. This process caused immense pain and often led to severe deformities, disabilities, and lifelong health problems for the women who underwent foot binding.\n4. Men’s Ties Editorial credit: LightField Studios / Shutterstock.com\nNeckties originated in the 17th century but have faced criticism in recent times. Many fashion bloggers argue that wearing a tie can be cumbersome, causing discomfort and even potential health issues such as restricted blood circulation to the brain. As a result, many uniformed professions, including postal workers, firefighters, and police officers, no longer require ties as part of their dress code.\n5. Tight Jeans Trend Editorial credit: SFIO CRACHO / Shutterstock.com\nJeans gained popularity in the 1960s, and the trend of wearing tight jeans emerged. These jeans fit close to the body and eliminate the need for a belt. However, some fashion experts warn that wearing excessively tight jeans can be uncomfortable and potentially dangerous, affecting nerve function and overall well-being.\n6. String Bikinis Editorial credit: Altrendo Images / Shutterstock.com\nString bikinis feature narrow strips or strings on the hips, replacing wider bands of fabric found in traditional bikini bottoms. Critics of this trend argue that it has eroded a sense of modesty among women. While some may feel self-conscious or uneasy about being observed, others believe that people should not be judged based on their choice of swimwear.\n7. Graphic T-shirts Editorial credit: Warrasade EGIE-MU / Shutterstock.com\nGraphic T-shirts have existed for over 50 years but only gained high fashion recognition during the 1990s. While they may not be suitable for corporate settings, some fashion analysts dismiss graphic T-shirts as lacking in style. They argue that someone who exclusively wears T-shirts is devoid of fashion sense. However, others appreciate the versatility and self-expression that graphic T-shirts offer.\n8. High Heels for Walking Editorial credit: Kaspars Grinvalds / Shutterstock.com\nOriginally intended for men’s shoes, high heels have become predominantly associated with women’s footwear. However, wearing heels while walking can strain the knees, hips, and lower back excessively. Prolonged use of high heels can lead to chronic discomfort and even contribute to conditions like arthritis. The negative effects extend beyond the feet, affecting the body’s overall posture and mechanics.\n9. Corsets Editorial credit: Elisanth / Shutterstock.com\nAlthough corsets were once associated with the affluent elite, by the 17th century, the middle class had also embraced them. However, dress reformers argued that corsets deformed women’s bodies, leading to widespread criticism of this fashion trend. Today, many people view corsets as tools of oppression and symbols of an era when women’s bodies were subjected to unrealistic beauty standards.\n10. Low Rise Jeans Image Credit: Shutterstock.\nPopularized by pop icons like Beyoncé and Jennifer Lopez, low-rise jeans became a trend embraced by the general public. However, some individuals found them uncomfortable, especially when sitting, as the hip line was often exposed, leading to self-consciousness and body image concerns.\nSource: Reddit\n10 Hairstyles for Men That People Hope Never Come Back in Fashion Again Editorial credit: Nejron Photo / Shutterstock.com\nWhile some styles stand the test of time and continue to be popular, there are certain haircuts people hope will never come back.

Shah, accompanied by his family, performed 'dhwaj puja' and later met with officials regarding the May 25 fire tragedy in Rajkot.
