    "title": "Kansas QB Jalon Daniels' Recovery Progresses, Spring Football Prospects Brighten",
    "text": "As Kansas University's football team gears up for its spring practices, all eyes are on quarterback Jalon Daniels, who is making promising strides in his recovery from a significant back injury. KU coach Lance Leipold recently provided an optimistic update on Daniels' condition, hinting at a strong comeback for the upcoming season. With the Jayhawks' spring showcase looming, the quarterback situation is under the spotlight, with Cole Ballard and newcomer Isaiah Marshall also in the mix for vital roles.\nSteady Recovery and Spring Preparations\nDaniels, whose last season was cut short due to a back injury, has been the subject of much concern and speculation among Jayhawks fans. However, Coach Leipold's latest comments suggest that Daniels is on the right track, participating in workouts and team activities with a positive attitude. The focus is not just on getting him ready for the spring showcase but ensuring he is fully prepared and healthy for the start of the season in August. This cautious approach underlines the importance of Daniels to the team and the desire to manage his recovery wisely.\nQuarterback Depth in Focus\nWith Daniels' availability for spring somewhat uncertain, attention turns to the depth chart behind him. Cole Ballard, who stepped in as the third-string quarterback last season, is making noticeable improvements, particularly in his physical conditioning. Incoming freshman Isaiah Marshall, hailed as a future star, is poised to join the fray, adding excitement and competition to the quarterback room. Coach Leipold emphasized the necessity of having multiple quarterbacks ready to play, a lesson learned from past seasons marred by injuries at the position.\nAdjusting Spring Showcase Expectations\nThe upcoming Spring Showcase, scheduled for April 12 at Rock Chalk Park, is set to be a critical moment for the team, albeit with a format more akin to a practice than a traditional scrimmage. This decision, aimed at keeping key players healthy, reflects the coaching staff's strategy to balance preparation with preservation. With several experienced players on the roster, the focus is on fine-tuning skills and strategies rather than engaging in full-contact play. This approach also allows younger players and those in backup roles an opportunity to shine and gain valuable experience.\nAs the Jayhawks prepare for their Spring Showcase, the progress of Jalon Daniels offers a beacon of hope for a team eager to make its mark in the upcoming season. With a talented group of quarterbacks ready to step up, Kansas football is poised for an exciting and competitive spring. The careful management of Daniels' recovery, combined with the development of Ballard and Marshall, sets the stage for a dynamic and resilient quarterback unit capable of leading the Jayhawks to success.",

The report, which gathered data from 3,536 workers across six APME countries and territories between March 14 and April 11, 2025, reveals a complex landscape of employee well-being, job satisfaction, and confidence in the rapidly evolving world of work.\n\"Our latest Global Talent Barometer offers a timely look at how workers across the region are feeling. While confidence in the future remains strong, job satisfaction is not keeping pace,\" says François Lançon, Regional President, Asia Pacific & Middle East, ManpowerGroup. \"Notably, almost a third of workers say they lack opportunities for advancement within their current organizations. This is sending a clear signal: people are looking for more than just a paycheck. They want flexibility, balance, growth, and a sense of purpose. They want to feel supported and empowered to shape their own futures.\"\nIn APME, almost 4 in 5 employees (78%) find their work meaningful and purposeful, and 69% feel well or fully supported with regards to work-life balance. However, the workforce reports experiencing high daily stress (50%) and low job satisfaction (42%), with the younger generations—Gen Zs and Millennials—feeling the most stressed and dissatisfied.\nGen Z reports the highest levels of daily stress (56%) despite 73% of them saying they feel supported with regards to work-life balance. They are also the most likely to change jobs within the next six months (56%).\nView the full press release and results of the Global Talent Barometer 2025, Volume 1—APME Report and Key Findings, here:\nhttps://www.manpowergroup.com.sg/global-talent-barometer-apme\nAbout ManpowerGroup\nManpowerGroup® (NYSE: MAN), the leading global workforce solutions company, helps organizations transform in a fast-changing world of work by sourcing, assessing, developing, and managing the talent that enables them to win.

    "title": "Accidents on the rise, but MVD lenient on ‘fitness’ of school buses in Kerala",
    "text": "KOCHI: The recent fatal accidents that shook Kerala have sparked calls for stringent measures to reduce the number of mishaps.\nHowever, the Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) has gone more lenient, allowing educational institution buses (EIB) whose fitness certificates have expired or about to expire soon, to continue plying for another four to five months.\nSo far, the practice was to withdraw the vehicles from service and carry out repair and maintenance works before subjecting them for fitness tests as and when their validity ended, even if it meant the vehicle couldn’t be operated for two to three weeks during the academic year. The lone exemption was provided during the pandemic.\nNow, as per the written directive issued to all deputy transport commissioners, regional and joint regional transport officers, the validity of the fitness certificate of all EIBs, whose fitness expired or is about to expire in the coming months, has been extended till April 2025.\n“It’s directed that fitness tests of such vehicles need to be conducted only in the month of April, May 2025. The same is aimed at avoiding subjecting the vehicles to fitness tests by the institutions multiple times in a single academic year,” read the December 18 directive issued from the office of the transport commissioner.\nThe decision was taken after the Kerala Private School Management submitted a memorandum, saying that schools had reopened after being closed for a long period during Covid in December 2021, and the same led to a situation where many schools are forced to submit school buses multiple times for fitness tests in an academic year as the validity period of some buses ends midway.\n“The (latest) move will result in EIBs plying without carrying out timely maintenance activities. This increases the risk of mishaps, especially like moving vehicles catching fire. Also, will insurance companies approve claims if such vehicles meet with accidents? Such leniency at a time when accidents are rising will send a wrong message,” said a former senior MVD official on the condition of anonymity.\nFor instance, on November 14, the wheels of a school bus got detached due to loose nuts amid operations at Pattanakkad in Cherthala, he said, adding the same will result in a loss to the state exchequer, with vehicles skipping tests based on the year of registration.\nMeanwhile, MVD sources said the usual practice was that such vehicles are subjected to fitness tests at the start of the academic season itself without waiting for the expiry of the fitness validity period.\n“If the fitness validity of a school bus is till August, the management can submit the bus for fitness certificate in April-May itself, ensuring its operation can be availed without interruptions throughout the academic year. This ‘reduction’ of validity period in fact ensures the vehicle is in top condition. Now, many vehicles would be plying without carrying out the periodic maintenance tests,” said a source.\nIn Kerala, over 23,000 vehicles are being operated by schools. Of these, around 9,000 are owned by CBSE schools while the rest belong to aided, unaided schools and colleges. A huge number of vehicles are operated by private parties.\nThe development comes even as the Ernakulam Regional Transport Office (RTO), the first in Kerala to register one million vehicles, lacks a dedicated Vehicle Testing Centre despite the rise in the number of fitness test inspections over the years. There are nearly 750 school vehicles under the Ernakulam RTO alone.",

    "text": "Status: 29.12.2023, 15:04 PM\nBy: Jennifer Lanzinger\nCommentsPrint Share\nAlthough the situation has been tense for days in numerous flood areas, the situation on the ground could worsen even further: the DWD predicts rain. The news ticker.\nUpdate from December 29, 14:43 p.m.: \"We have a very, very tense situation,\" said Lower Saxony's Interior Minister Daniela Behrens (SPD) on Deutschlandfunk. The flood situation remains critical. Almost all of Lower Saxony is under water. The approximately 100,000 personnel from the fire brigade and the Federal Agency for Technical Relief (THW), among others, are therefore deployed everywhere.\nThere is \"really no easing in sight,\" added the SPD politician. According to the weather forecast, there will be more rain in the next few days, as well as storms. This does not ease the situation, but \"exacerbates it at one point or another\".\nContinuous rain could exacerbate flood situation Update from December 29, 12:20 p.m.: Thousands of emergency workers are still fighting against the floods in numerous regions in Germany, and the next water is already on the horizon. As the German Weather Service published on Friday, rain must be expected in the coming days. Meanwhile, in the Serengeti Park, keepers and emergency services are fighting against time: numerous animals are trapped by the water.\n\"There will be a good swing until Saturday, but it will no longer rain in such large quantities,\" said meteorologist Christian Herold from the DWD on Friday morning in Offenbach. After that, it tones down a bit. According to this, the north of North Rhine-Westphalia in particular must be prepared for the most rainfall. According to the meteorologist, showers are predicted in particular from the Bergisches Land to the Sauerland and north of it from the Weser Uplands to the Harz Mountains. \"In this area, 15 to 20 liters per square meter are expected until Saturday, in reservoirs up to 30 liters per square meter.\" The Harz will be particularly affected. Locally, even higher quantities could be achieved there.\nBut Lower Saxony can't breathe a sigh of relief either: In the north, in the Bremen and Hamburg area, the meteorologist expects less precipitation. \"There are more isolated showers moving through. Maybe there will be short thunderstorms.\" In Saxony, according to Herold, precipitation is limited to the region north of Dresden. \"But these are just very isolated showers.\"\nFlood situation in Germany remains tense: DWD makes threatening rain forecast Original report from 29 December : Munich/Dresden – Tension still prevails in numerous regions in Germany, and rain announced by the DWD could even further exacerbate the situation on the ground. Emergency services are already reporting soaked dikes, and in Saxony-Anhalt a dike has now even been opened in a controlled manner. Numerous people have already had to leave their homes, and others are preparing for an imminent evacuation. The situation in Lower Saxony remains particularly tense. Emergency services had to evacuate the first animals from the Serengeti Park on Thursday.\nMy news Thief fills 189 liters in canister reading\nDischarged water from reservoir threatens places in Thuringia\nLake in Baden-Württemberg is the largest in the country – it is often overlookedread\nThe oldest butcher's shop in Germany comes from Baden-Württemberg read\nJetstream is heading for Germany: Current weather forecast makes people sit up and take noticeread\nThese outlet centers in Baden-Wurttemberg areRead more\nFlood situation in Germany remains tense: DWD announces new rain For the coming days, the German Weather Service announces a lot of rain, especially in the already severely affected flood areas, the situation could come to a head. In the reservoirs of the Bergisches Land and the Siegerland in North Rhine-Westphalia as well as the Harz Mountains, continuous rain must be expected from Friday morning until the night to Saturday. Up to 40 liters per square meter could fall within 24 hours.\nTension also continues to prevail on the border between Thuringia and Saxony-Anhalt. In order to avert the risk of flooding there, a dike of the river Helme has been opened in a controlled manner. The water is now flowing onto fields, the Kyffhäuserkreis district announced on Friday night. The opening was necessary because water had been deliberately drained from the overloaded Kelbra reservoir for several days and the Helmen was carrying a lot of water as a result. According to the district, firefighters have laid around 4,6000 sandbags since Thursday to protect the small town of Mönchpfiffel-Nikolausrieth and raise the dikes.\nLower Saxony continues to be severely affected by floods – evacuations prepared In Lower Saxony, areas along the rivers Aller, Leine and Weser in the southern and central parts of the state are affected. There, the situation worsened further on Thursday. The dikes were no longer able to withstand the masses of water everywhere. Thousands of relief workers are deployed across the country. Evacuations were prepared in some places. In the municipality of Langlingen in the district of Celle, about 120 people left their houses and apartments as a precaution on Friday night. On Friday morning, the state government wants to give an update on the flood situation at a press conference.\nThe Weser is flooded in the district of Nienburg/Weser. The situation remains tense. © Moritz Frankenberg/dpa\nPrime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) said on Thursday that there had never been a flood of this magnitude before. \"Experts have long warned that the increasing frequency of weather extremes is linked to climate change,\" he said. According to the Ministry of the Interior, a so-called extraordinary event was detected in six districts as well as the city of Oldenburg. With this measure, for example, counties can more easily access auxiliary staff.\nFlood situation is also causing problems for Bremen – numerous residents have left their homes There is also no all-clear yet around Bremen. According to the authorities on Thursday evening, numerous houses along the Wümme in the Katrepel area are surrounded by water and without electricity. Most of the residents have left this area. In the district of Timmersloh, the water is standing on the dikes. Roads and fields are flooded. According to the information provided by the Interior Ministry, measures to secure the dike have already had to be carried out several times.\nFlood situation: No all-clear yet in Dresden either On the Elbe in Dresden, rising water levels are expected. Early Thursday afternoon, 5.92 meters were measured. This was still just below the six-metre mark from which the second-highest alert level 3 would apply. The state flood control center expected this limit to be exceeded on Friday morning - but only very slightly with a maximum of 6.01 meters. A normal water level of 2.00 meters in the Elbe in the state capital is normal.\nThe hydrologists expected a decrease in the Elbe flood water from Friday, as a spokesman for the State Office for the Environment, Agriculture and Geology said. Only locally light rain is expected, in the Czech catchment area of the Elbe neither precipitation nor snowmelt until Friday.\nDownstream in Magdeburg and Schönebeck in Saxony-Anhalt, the State Agency for Flood Protection and Water Management opened the Pretzien weir on Thursday. This means that about a third of the Elbe's water is channelled past the two cities through a flood channel and across meadows and fields before flowing back into the Elbe.",

En este caso, la Argentina Sub 20, que empató 1-1 sobre el final con Mauritania, en un encuentro jugado este jueves por certamen de L’Alcudia, en Valencia.\nEl nuevo incidente se produjo en el torneo internacional Cotif que se disputa cada temporada en España. La Argentina perdía por 1-0 contra Mauritania, cuando el árbitro cobró un penal muy discutido en el tercer minuto de descuento. Tras un ataque desde la derecha, Sosa intentó enviar un centro, pero chocó contra uno de los defensores africanos y el árbitro marcó penal, ante la sorpresa, primero, y la reacción destemplada luego del equipo de Mauritania.\nEl festejo de Carrizo tras anotar el gol del empate - Créditos: @X\nMaher Carrizo anotó el 1-1 definitivo desde los once metros, pero mientras Argentina celebraba la igualdad, los jugadores africanos se fueron encima del árbitro, que debió salir del campo custodiado. La Guardia Civil tuvo que entrar el terreno de juego para defender al referí.\nMás allá del resultado, no fue bueno el partido del Sub 20, que jugó todo el segundo tiempo con uno menos, después de que Juan Manuel Villalba fue expulsado a los 44 minutos. Mauritania abrió la cuenta a los 8 de la segunda parte a través de Bilal Maouloud. Sin embargo, dos minutos después, los africanos también se quedaron con diez por la tarjeta roja que vio Saidou Sy.\nEl equipo dirigido por Diego Placente no tuvo claridad, pero llegó a la igualdad en tiempo de descuento con el discutido penal que anotó Carrizo, una infracción que desató las quejas y reclamos de los mauritanos. De este modo, la selección Sub 20 se mantiene invicta y es líder con siete puntos (previamente les ganó por 1-0 a ADH Brasil y a Levante) en el Grupo B. Completará la primera fase y se jugará la clasificación a las semifinales este sábado, cuando se enfrente con Valencia, desde las 18 de nuestro país.\nAsí terminó el partido entre Argentina 🇦🇷 y Mauritania 🇲🇷 en L'Alcúdia. Maher Carrizo empató de penal. El árbitro tuvo que salir custodiado por la Guardia Civil. 👇 pic.twitter.com/YYy2klmi93\n— VarskySports (@VarskySports) July 25, 2024",

    "text": "Politics Politics & Government News Fox News’ Laura Ingraham Botches Attack on Tim Walz, Saying She’s Watched Minnesota Change — ‘Especially Milwaukee’ After touting her familiarity with Minnesota, Ingraham incorrectly implied that it's home to Wisconsin's largest city\nBy People Staff Published on August 8, 2024 05:04PM EDT Close Laura Ingraham seen speaking during the American Conservative Union's Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) at the Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center in Oxon Hill, MD. Photo: Michael Brochstein/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty\nLaura Ingraham’s attempt to criticize Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz 's home state backfired when she confidently mixed up her Midwest geography.\nOn Wednesday, Aug. 8, Ingraham made a distracting error while trying to argue that Minnesota has gone downhill under Walz's leadership. Walz, who was recently selected as Kamala Harris ' 2024 running mate, was elected governor in 2018.\n“If you know Minnesota — and I know it well — especially Milwaukee, it’s changed,” the talk show host said.\n\"It has never recovered from 2020 and it is not the same place,” she added. “And Tim Walz was empathizing with all the DEI initiatives that were swirling about the controversies.\"\nIngraham’s error was promptly pointed out on social media as viewers noted that Milwaukee is in Wisconsin, not Minnesota.\nTim Walz Joins Kamala Harris on Stage Hours After He’s Named Her 2024 Running Mate According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel , Ingraham and her panel had been speaking about Walz’s stances on diversity, equity and inclusion when the flub dominated viewers' attention.\nLaura Ingraham Dismisses John Eastman’s 2020 Election Fraud Claims: ‘I Haven’t Seen That Evidence’ Kamala Harris and Tim Walz at a campaign rally in Philadelphia on Aug. 6, 2024. Andrew Harnik/Getty\nWalz is an Army National Guard veteran and former educator who turned to politics in 2006 when he was elected to Congress in a conservative district. Since he was chosen as the Democratic vice presidential candidate, Republicans have begun poring over his legislative record in an attempt to portray his stances as radical.\nSome allies of Donald Trump began calling the governor \"Tampon Tim,\" in reference to an education bill he signed into law that called for public schools to provide menstrual products to girls between 4th and 12th grade.\nWhy Are Tim Walz's Critics Calling Him 'Tampon Tim'? Harris, meanwhile, has continued praising her VP pick on the campaign trail, as the pair tours through the seven battleground states this week.\n\"One of the things that stood out to me about Tim is how his convictions on fighting for middle class families run deep. It's personal,\" Harris said in a statement explaining what drew her to Walz. \"We are going to build a great partnership. We start out as underdogs but I believe together, we can win this election.\"",
