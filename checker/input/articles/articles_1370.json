    "text": "ST. LOUIS — Some great news for workers across Missouri and Illinois! Starting Jan. 1, 2024, the minimum wage will increase across the Bi-state. In Missouri, the minimum wage is increasing from $12 to $12.30. Across the river in Illinois, the hourly rate is jumping up from $13 to $14. Illinois now has the [highest minimum wage in the Midwest](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/minimum-wage/state). Both states are way above the federal minimum wage, which remains at $7.25 in the new year. Illinois and Missouri are part of 22 states where wages are increasing in 2024. For Missouri, the increase comes after a proposition was passed in 2018. The measure ensured the Show-Me State's minimum wage would increase by 85 cents per hour each year through 2023. For tipped employees in Illinois, the minimum wage is also increasing from $7.80 to $8.40. According to Forbes, inflation rates for 2024 are expected to be at 2.4%.

    "title": "Les vaccins à ARN contre le Covid ont bien provoqué des troubles menstruels",
    "text": "Selon cette étude française, le risque persiste 3 mois après la première injection avant de disparaître\nDepuis le début des campagnes de vaccination anti-Covid, voici près de deux ans et demi, de nombreuses femmes ont fait état de perturbations dans leurs cycles menstruels. Sur la base de ces déclarations, l’Agence européenne du médicament (EMA) a fini par inclure la présence de saignements menstruels importants comme effet secondaire possible des vaccins à ARN messager, ceux de Pfizer/BioNTech et Moderna. Mais ce lien restait fortement débattu dans la communauté scientifique.\nUne étude publiée ce mercredi 24 janvier par les autorités sanitaires françaises, apporte des arguments en faveur de l’existence d’un tel lien. Selon les conclusions des chercheurs, il existerait bel et bien un risque de troubles menstruels dès la première injection d’un vaccin à ARN messagers.\n» LIRE AUSSI – Covid: plus de 200 millions de doses de vaccins jetÃ©es en Europe\nUn risque temporaire Plus précisément, l’étude en question «met en évidence une augmentation de 20% du risque de saignements menstruels abondants ayant nécessité une prise en charge à l’hôpital dans un délai de 1 à 3 mois», après avoir reçu un vaccin Pfizer ou Moderna pour la première fois , résume l’organisation Epi-Phare, qui associe l’autorité du médicament et la Sécurité sociale, en charge notamment de la protection des individus en matière de santé.\nPour parvenir à cette conclusion, les chercheurs ont recensé le statut vaccinal de plusieurs milliers de femmes hospitalisées pour saignements menstruels abondants en 2021 et 2022. Ils ont comparé leur situation à un groupe témoin de femmes n’ayant pas été prises en charge pour ce motif. Selon les résultats, le risque d’une telle perturbation des cycles menstruels serait légèrement plus élevé la première fois qu’une femme reçoit un vaccin Moderna ou Pfizer, chacun administré en deux doses successives. Cependant il ne serait que transitoire, estiment les chercheurs car il disparaîtrait après trois mois, même lorsqu’une dose de rappel est administrée ultérieurement.\n» LIRE AUSSI – Covid-19 : les troubles menstruels aprÃ¨s la vaccination sont-ils Â«temporairesÂ» et Â«bÃ©ninsÂ» ?\nDes positions encore contradictoires Toutes les études ne vont pourtant pas dans le même sens. Les présents résultats contrastent avec ceux d’une étude de vaste ampleur réalisée en Suède et publiée au printemps 2023 dans le BMJ. Celle-ci avait estimé qu’aucun élément solide n’avérait un lien entre vaccination Covid et troubles menstruels. Selon les chercheurs d’Epi-Phare, cela s’expliquerait par l’utilisation d’approches méthodologiques différentes.\nIls relèvent notamment que l’étude suédoise prenait en compte une période à risque qui commençait à peine plus d’une semaine après la vaccination des patientes. Un tel choix «a pu conduire à masquer une éventuelle augmentation du risque survenant dans un délai un peu plus tardif», explique l’épidémiologiste Rosemary Dray-Spira, qui a supervisé l’étude française. Avec son équipe, ils ont à l’inverse choisi d’attendre un mois après la première dose de vaccin. Ainsi, d’autres preuves sont nécessaires pour venir consolider ce lien.",

    "title": "How I Quit Shame Cold-Turkey",
    "text": "How I Quit Shame Cold-Turkey\nIn order to do what was right, I had to break a life-long pattern.\nShame is like the mythical monster under your bed. You are so terrified it will devour you that you won't even look to see if the monster is real. When you allow yourself to see and feel your shame by shining a light on it, you will see how the story about your shame was all made up — just like the monster under the bed.\nI have let shame run my life for many years, by not allowing myself to look at it, acknowledge it, or feel it.\nBy keeping it at bay, I thought I was protecting myself from the pain it generated, but what I did was create an environment for it to fester and grow.\nMy shame pattern (and likely yours) looks like this:\n1. I do something\n2. Someone I care about doesn’t like it and reacts\n3. I register their disappointment or anger, feel immediate shame, and freeze\nWhen preparing to write this article, I thought about a pattern of engagement I had with a close friend. Our personalities went into battle in such a way I\nplayed the victim for a long time.\nWhen I went to run the idea past her, she was not happy with the idea or what I wrote, and did not want me to publish it. What happened next was the perfect illustration of how I begin a shame-spiral.\nfizkes via Shutterstock\nShe thought I should have known she wouldn’t want me to write about it since I knew she was a private person. When I heard her negative reaction, I felt a pang in my stomach and a wave of nausea.\nThen I froze. I didn’t want to feel like that. I thought, “I can’t write about shame, because it will hurt my friend. I have to trash the article.”\nI stopped myself in my tracks. Then I got angry.\nI thought she was trying to control me and started to explain how it was really about me, and how I noticed my pattern around pushing away shame, not looking at it to feel peaceful.\nThen I felt another pang in my stomach and nausea again. This time, however, it occurred to me to pay attention to that\nphysical reaction. It was telling me something.\nFollowing the feeling of shame instead of running from it\nSuddenly it dawned on me I felt ashamed for not thinking of how the article would impact my friend — how it would feel to her.\nInstead of\nrunning away from the feeling, I decided this time to let it come and wash over me. I dropped my thoughts, turning my attention to the sensation in my body, and the emotion I was feeling. Quite frankly, it felt awful.\nI cried and cried with fear I had created a\npermanent disconnection with my friend by even conceiving of the article. But, lo and behold, after not such a long period, my breathing slowed down, my muscles began to relax, the nausea and fear went away — and I was, much to my surprise, okay. I was okay, and I realized I hadn’t done anything wrong.\nThen I began to laugh out loud. It occurred to me I didn’t need to write about the pattern with my friend at all. I had all I needed right there in front of me.\nThe experience of writing something that triggered a\nfear reaction in my friend ended up triggering a shame reaction in me and I could see it in real-time, allowing me to observe who I become when I am in the grips of shame.\nSo here is what I saw:\n- I feel shame\n- I go through my physical response cycle, then I try to resist the feeling and turn away from the shame\n- Then I judge the messenger — whoever delivered the words or judgment that triggered my shame\n- Then I make up stories about them. They shouldn’t have reacted that way. They just don’t understand me. They are trying to control me. They don’t care about my creativity\n- Then I feel more shame and blame myself. How could I react that way? I am\nso mean and insensitive\nI jump to\nartificial compassion for the messenger, to avoid my feelings and feel better about myself imagining I am more understanding than them. Then I deflate and become a smaller version of myself.\n- I cry.\n- I hide.\n- I disengage.\n- I lose focus.\n- I am unable to think.\nOn and on it goes.\nIn a nutshell, I utterly and completely go out of the state of being present in my emotions and experience, and I lose myself as I resist the shame.\nWhat I was reminded of through this experience is I have a habit of shaming myself and running away from the shame I created. I\ncreate more pain for myself when I resist feeling the shame and go into my tailspin, fueled by judgments about myself and others. The tailspin lasts far longer than a couple of minutes it takes to drop my judgment stories and let the shame wash over me and dissipate.\nIt is the not wanting to look at and feel the shame that is the problem, not the feeling of shame itself.\nThere was a time in my life when I would let shame knock me down for days, months, years at a time. It was a well-established habit. What I eventually came to understand is the only way to break the habit is to practice allowing the shame to roll through.\nIt is just a form of fear I trigger in myself, believing I shouldn’t have done what I did.\nIt is far more productive to let the shame move through, from a space of presence for it, and then consider whether a different course of action would bring me closer to what I want.\nI admit, I do feel surprised when I realize that I, even with\npracticed awareness, can still let shame stop me in my tracks. And, if I am not present, I can shame myself twice over for getting stuck in shame.\nOver the years, I have come to accept this is an ignored factor for me, but I am OK with that because I know the antidote is simple.\nHold the shame lightly and let it go.\nNot only do I get to free myself from prolonged pain when I\n break the shame habit, but there is the benefit of who I become when I free myself from shame.\nReliably, after\nreleasing shame, my creativity flows. I am more open-hearted, compassionate, and understanding. I am open to possibilities and solutions. I have so much more energy. I feel much more powerful and joyful. To me, the benefits far outweigh the relatively brief period of discomfort.\nSo, when you imagine the shame monster lurking under the bed, instead of pulling the covers over your head, wishing it would go away and leave you alone, grab your flashlight and take a look.\nMichelle Thompson is a life coach specializing in personal and relationship transformation, helping stuck individuals and couples improve their positive energy flow, reconnect with their inner selves and their partners, and embrace their capacity to love more fully.",

    "title": "‘Masters Of The Air’ Inside Look Promises Carnage And Death In WWII Series",
    "text": "Videos by OutKick\nApple continues to tease “Masters of the Air” ahead of its release, and the series looks awesome.\nThe true\nWWII series about bomber crews from Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks, and Gary Goetzman – the same team that made “ Band of Brothers” and “The Pacific” – premieres Apple TV+ January 26th with the first two episodes, and history buffs are fired up.\nFans have had a trailer, a couple promos and images from the show to stoke excitement. Now, the giant tech company released a special inside look that is bound to have people amped up and ready to roll.\nGive it a watch below, and send me your thoughts at David.Hookstead@outkick.com.\n“Masters of the Air” tells a harrowing true story.\nI would like to say that we have a big review coming Wednesday morning of “Masters of the Air.” I think you’re all going to like it. I can’t say much more than that right now, but keep your eyes peeled Wednesday morning.\nWhat I will say is everything we’ve had to see so far of the WWII series with Austin Butler indicates it’s going to be amazing (it will be), and it definitely has a high bar to meet.\n“Band of Brothers” is the greatest war story ever told on film. It turned Easy Company into a household name and it cemented Richard “Dick” Winters and the rest of the main men as WWII legends. I watch it multiple times a year, and it never gets old.\nWhen the same team responsible for “\nBoB” drops a new series, fans are going to expect that same level of excellence.\nAlso, it’s great to see WWII bomber crews are getting the respect they deserve. It was arguably the most dangerous job of the entire war. Bomber crews had to fly through German flak (think of buckshot being fired into the air, but it’s powerful enough to blow up entire planes), and if the crews survived that, their reward was gunning it out with German fighters.\nMany bomber crews ended up dead or POWs. It was a brutal job, and not one the public knows enough about. As I’ve said many times, I’m very biased because a family member of mine – Connie – earned two Distinguished Flying Crosses raining hell down on the Germans during WWII. He was later killed in Korea.\nWhile “Masters of the Air” doesn’t follow his unit, it does shine a light on the same job, and I’m excited to see how it’s received.\nOn Memorial Day, I remember my Uncle Connie.— David Hookstead (@dhookstead)\nHe was a pilot in WWII and earned the Distinguished Flying Cross twice in the aftermath of D-Day.\nHe was recalled for Korea, and was shot down in 1952. Connie was never seen again.\nHe was 30 years old and only knew war.\n[pic.twitter.com/tstFdmAsOd] [May 29, 2023]\nYou can catch “Masters of the Air” starting this upcoming Friday, and definitely check out our full review Wednesday morning.

    "text": "目前正值高考时报志愿的时候，很多高校的招生办都忙的不可开交。不过网传哈尔滨工程大学的几位老师，在群内回答新生疑问时，发表了一系列的逆天言论，不但让很多新生望而却步，甚至在本校的学生群体当中都引起了很大的讨论。\n据悉，在该学校的招生群内，有新生询问宿舍内是否有空调，因为通过查询得知，近几日哈尔滨的温度高达37度左右，在贴吧内也有在读学生反应晚上会被热醒等，所以有新生担心没有空调的话，会休息不好。\n按照常理来讲，遇到这种问题，老师们正常回答就好了。然而一位张老师却剑走偏锋，硬生生的把学生宿舍没有空调的问题，一下子上升到了境外势力的高度。\n张老师表示：正常懂气候知识的人，讨论哈尔滨天气热，就不合理，就很好笑。跟大家说实话，因为学校的军工、国防特色，核心地位，所以会有境外势力和其余势力，以一些天气，气候等事情抹黑学校。\n先不说作为招生办老师，上来就指责新生“不懂气候知识”“行为可笑”，这种行为合不合理。张老师随后还搬出“国防七子”被美国拉黑一事，来告诫大家要有判断力。但国防七子的事情，和哈尔滨工程大学又有什么关系，这不是说的是人家哈尔滨工业大学吗？张老师这不是在混淆概念以及蹭人家哈工大的热度吗？\n更加让一些学生们接受不了的是，群内的程老师还附和：空调对身体有很大危害。\n这就更让人搞不懂了，既然有很大危害，那学校的行政楼还有其他楼里，为什么都装有空调？甚至留学生的宿舍内也有空调？\n对此，另外一位葛姓老师称：是因为考虑到欧洲白种人体质和咱们不同，他们耐冷不耐热。\n然而在贴吧内，有学校称其实学校内的白人留学生很少，大多是东南亚地区以及黑人留学生，按道理还说这群人应该是耐热不耐冷才对。\n另外，还有学生发帖表示，前几天热的时候一度跑去楼道、草场睡了",

Ils ont également voté à 96% en faveur d'une grève qui débutera dès minuit, menaçant de paralyser la production du concurrent américain d'Airbus déjà fragilisé par de multiples crises. Les employés de Boeing ont massivement rejeté la proposition sur le projet de nouvelle convention , ouvrant la voie à une grève sans précédent qui menace de paralyser la production du géant aéronautique. BREAKING:— Ryan Simms (@RyanTVnews) [@Boeing]machinists vote to STRIKE, effective immediately. This means 32,000 [@IAM751]and W24 members are on the picket lines starting TONIGHT. Vote to strike was 96% for it [pic.twitter.com/gBUKmkRYOn] [September 13, 2024] Avec 94,6% des voix contre l'accord et 96% en faveur de la grève, les 33.000 salariés de la région de Seattle et de l'Oregon (Etats-Unis) ont envoyé un message clair à la direction : les conditions proposées sont inacceptables.\"Nous ferons grève à minuit\", a déclaré Jon Holden, président du syndicat IAM District 751, qualifiant ce mouvement de \"grève pour pratiques de travail déloyales\". Il accuse Boeing de discrimination, d'interrogatoires coercitifs et de surveillance illégale des employés. Une hausse salariale de 25% Cette nouvelle convention, qui concerne les adhérents de l'IAM dans la région de Seattle (nord-ouest), prévoyait une hausse salariale de 25% sur quatre ans ainsi qu'un engagement d'investissements dans la région. Et aussi la construction du prochain avion - annoncé pour 2035 - dans le berceau historique de l'avionneur qui assurerait des emplois pour plusieurs décennies. Cependant, les travailleurs ont jugé ces propositions insuffisantes face à l'augmentation du coût de la vie, ayant initialement demandé des hausses d'environ 40%. Une perte d'1,5 milliards d'euros Cette décision représente un revers majeur pour Kelly Ortberg, PDG depuis seulement cinq semaines. Cette grève risque d'avoir d'importantes répercussions sur Boeing avec l'arrêt de la production de la plupart des avions. Selon certains analystes, 30 jours de grève pourraient coûter 1,5 milliard de dollars et la déstabiliser potentielle des fournisseurs et des chaînes d'approvisionnement.

(...) Une grève mettrait en péril notre reprise commune\", a prévenu mercredi soir Kelly Ortberg, qui a succédé le 8 août à Dave Calhoun au poste de directeur général.",

Following accusations of drug trafficking, including the sale of Viagra, a Spanish priest from Don Benito in the western Extremadura region has been temporarily suspended by the Roman Catholic Church.

Expressing pain and dismay at the suffering and scandal caused by the events, the diocese has decided to temporarily remove the priest from public ministry and his role as parish priest while awaiting clarification on the situation. The clergyman, whose identity remains undisclosed, is receiving psychological and spiritual accompaniment following his arrest. Spanish media reports indicate that the priest, accompanied by a second arrested man alleged to be his lover, was engaged in the trafficking of Viagra, aphrodisiacs, and narcotics. The two individuals, under police surveillance for several months, reportedly utilised a residence rented by the priest for storing the illicit products. El Espanol, an online newspaper, highlighted the news, causing disbelief among the parish's faithful. However, numerous incidents involving the priest community have been reported in recent years. A recent case highlighted the arrest of a Roman Catholic priest near the US-Mexico border facing criminal charges related to alleged sexual molestation of a child. The arrest of Fernando Gonzalez Ortega on charges of sexually abusing a minor and human trafficking emphasise the argument made by abuse victims and their advocates that not all molesters within the jurisdiction of US Catholic bishops have been eliminated, despite reforms initiated in response to the global church's decades-old clergy molestation scandal. A probe conducted last year by the Spanish Catholic Church into such cases revealed grim details. The investigation identified 728 alleged abusers, including clergy and non-clerical staff, and 927 victims over eight decades since the 1940s. Spain's Catholic Church faced criticism after El Pais newspaper uncovered disturbing details of the institution's abuse of hundreds of children by members of the clergy. (With inputs from agencies)",
