    "title": "Hot seat update: When will Sam Pittman, Billy Napier be fired?",
    "text": "- Sam Pittman and Billy Napier are battling the most heat prior to their openers, but others in the SEC also will encounter critical seasons. - Sam Pittman's buyout clause works against him. Billy Napier's buyout affords some protection, but enough? - Shane Beamer set a high bar for himself in his first two seasons. Is Vanderbilt's bar low enough for Clark Lea? The mercury is rising on the SEC’s hot seat before the season even begins. Multiple SEC coaches face potential make-or-break seasons. Sam Pittman (Arkansas) and Billy Napier (Florida) are battling the most heat prior to their openers, but Clark Lea (Vanderbilt) and Shane Beamer (South Carolina) also will encounter critical seasons. On this edition of “ SEC Football Unfiltered ,” a podcast from the USA TODAY Network, hosts Blake Toppmeyer and John Adams take the temperature of those four jobs. ∎ Beamer is the only member of the quartet above .500 during his tenure, but the Gamecocks are coming off a year of regression. ∎ If Pittman’s record doesn’t rebound after last year’s tailspin, he could trigger a performance clause in his contract that would allow Arkansas to fire him for a discount. ∎ Napier’s Gators face one of the nation’s toughest schedules, and he's already just 11-14 at Florida. ∎ Lea’s last SEC win came in 2022. TOPPMEYER: Florida's Billy Napier would handle hot seat better with Tennessee's cushy schedule ADAMS: The new version of 'college' football is too big to fail Here's how we see the fate of these four coaches: Sam Pittman (Arkansas) Adams: He'll be fired on Sept. 29 after loss to Texas A&M. Firing Pittman early in the season would allow Arkansas to elevate Bobby Petrino to interim coach for a two-month trial to evaluate Petrino's candidacy for the job. Toppmeyer: He'll be fired on Oct. 20 after loss to LSU. I've got the Razorbacks starting the season at 2-5. If they do so, Pittman's record since 2021 would dip below .500, trigging a discounted buyout clause in which Arkansas could save about $4 million by firing Pittman before his record rebounds. Clark Lea (Vanderbilt) Adams: He'll be fired on Dec. 1, 2025, after a loss to Tennessee ends his fifth straight losing season. Vanderbilt will be bad this season, but it will retain with Lea for another year of futility. Toppmeyer: He'll be fired on Dec. 1. If Vanderbilt's season goes the way I think it will, there's no reason to wait another year to fire Lea. This remains an incredibly tough job, and there's zero evidence Lea is up to the task. Shane Beamer (South Carolina) Adams: He'll be fired on Dec. 1 after a loss to Clemson. Beamer set the bar too high for himself by winning 15 games throughout his first two seasons. A second straight losing season in Year 4 will trigger a change. Toppmeyer: He'll remain South Carolina's coach for at least the 2025 season. Will Muschamp got five seasons at South Carolina. Beamer will get at least that many. The Gamecocks might spin their tires this season, but it won't get bad enough to make a change. Billy Napier (Florida) Adams: He'll be fired on Dec. 1 after a loss to Florida State. Napier will get a full third season to show he's worth a fourth season, but a third straight loss to FSU and third straight losing season will tip the scales to a firing. Toppmeyer: He'll be fired on Dec. 1 after a loss to Florida State. The Gators would owe Napier more than $25 million if he's fired, but I don't see how Florida can stick with Napier if he delivers three straight losing seasons. Florida's depth chart is in its best state since Napier's hire, but UF's rugged schedule is tailormade for a firing.

    "title": "Pat Castaneda: Certified to Lead Committed to Caring | Gonzaga University",
    "text": "Pat Castaneda: Certified to Lead, Committed to Caring In 2021 Pat Castaneda received a Certificate in Foundational Leadership (CFL) from Gonzaga. That same year she started Manzanita House, a nonprofit organization that attempts to meet the needs of immigrant and refugee populations. Castaneda grew up in Venezuela before moving to England and then lived throughout the U.S. before finally settling down in Spokane. It was in Spokane that she found her passion for working with immigrants, as she feels empathetic to their needs being an immigrant herself. Before starting Manzanita House with friends, Castaneda was invited to receive a certificate from Gonzaga through her former workplace. Gonzaga’s Certificate in Foundational Leadership is a 9-month program that strengthens students’ individual and team leadership skills through practical learning, mentorship and assessments. Students are matched with a respected mentor based on their professional field and personality and are expected to meet once a month for the program. The program focuses on improving interpersonal communication skills, self-awareness and working with diverse identities. Some credits earned in the program can be transferred to a range of master’s degrees later if students wish to enroll. Castaneda participated in the program during the COVID-19 pandemic, meaning the typically hybrid certificate was completely online. Participants met on Fridays over Zoom and listened to presentations in the morning, engaged in discussion in the afternoon, and completed homework that included evaluating and talking with their mentors about what they had learned. While Castaneda did not get the opportunity to connect and network with the members of her cohort in person, she reflects on what she was able to take-away from the program: an understanding of what being a leader means and how to be the leader you want to be for others. Manzanita House is about creating a space where everyone can feel welcome and safe. The organization provides immigrant legal aid, often at low cost or not cost for immigrants. Manzanita House hosts family empowerment and engagement programs such as heritage language learning, offering Arabic, Farsi and Marshallese. A space for women named Teatime is provided as well as workshops and events to help educate, empower and provide resources for immigrant and refugee families in Spokane. All of which help families with their transition to living in the U.S. Castaneda strongly recommends a CFL and is still connected with her mentor whom she was introduced to through the program. Considering advice for others thinking about starting a certificate or going back to school, Castaneda urges that it is “never too late, especially immigrants feel that at a certain age that you cannot pursue a change, but it is never too late.”",

    "text": "[Featured News](/news/featured) - [Current News](/news) - [Archived News](/news/archive) - [News Categories](/news/category) First of 3 EPs releases today Press Release The cinematic and compelling story of the Book of Revelation has been put to music, courtesy of David and Nicole Binion. As we lead into the celebration of Easter, the timely release of their EP, “The Revelation Of Jesus” (Integrity Music), is available today. It’s the first of three Revelation projects to be released from the Binions this year. Listen to “The Revelation of Jesus” [here](https://t.e2ma.net/click/33gvxk/b2w4wt/7iv7t7). The seven songs found on “The Revelation of Jesus” bring the Book of Revelation to life, illuminating the glory, mystery and encounters between God and man. Inspiration to create the project began one day in May 2020 during the throes of the global pandemic when David was awakened by God’s voice to write the Revelation of Jesus. He explained, \"I was stunned by the invitation, uncertain if I was even qualified to take on such an endeavor. But I told the Lord yes immediately.\" All of the songs were recorded live at the Huckabee Theater in Hendersonville, Tennessee. Joining David and Nicole Binion are featured artists including Danny Gokey, Rita Springer and Mitch Wong, among others. The three projects were produced by David Binion and Daniel Lopez. Leading up to today's release, TBN is set to air the live recording of “The Revelation Of Jesus” on Tuesday, April 16. Check local listings for airtime. David Binion, who co-penned the track “I Was in the Spirit on the Lord’s Day” with Krissy Nordoff, reflects on Revelation 1:10, connecting the narrative of John’s experience to his own and to listeners. Track two, \"Patmos,\" written by Binion with Wong, is a favorite of Nicole’s, a raw and melodic piece that reminds listeners of God’s promise “The Lord is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit.” \"It is our desire to bring illumination to a new generation of worshipers about the glory and mystery of this beautiful, poetic book of the Bible,\" the Binions shared. \"John shows us the kind of encounters that are possible with God and man. This encounter isn’t only for John, it’s for all of us.\" With the hope that these songs bless the listeners, they added, “In the first few verses of Revelation, John writes, 'Blessed is the one who reads aloud the words of this prophecy, and blessed are those who hear, and who keep what is written in it.' We want those who hear it, and those who sing it, to receive the blessing of Revelation that was promised.\" About David & Nicole Binion David and Nicole Binion are a Dallas-based husband and wife ministry team sharing a passion to worship God and lead others into his presence. Married for 28 years, the Binions have been in ministry together for almost as long, working with a myriad of artists, evangelists and organizations representing the global church. A few years ago, David and Nicole pursued a long-held dream, launching Dwell Ministries to mentor and train a new generation of worshipers, worship leaders, and church creatives. Since then, the couple planted Dwell Church in Dallas. The Binions, who serve as guest hosts for TBN’s flagship “Praise!” program, also hosted “Dwell Nights” of worship across the U.S. and abroad after their 2018 critically acclaimed album fittingly called “Dwell.” Their most recent album, “Glory of Eden,” came out in 2020 and was followed by multiple collaborations with Integrity Music’s REVERE.

    "text": "Indian-origin man arrested for multiple break-ins, thefts at Hindu temples in Canada Police have arrested an Indian-origin person in connection with a series of burglaries that occurred at Hindu temples in Ontario province of Canada. The arrested person was identified as Jagdish Pandher. Durham Regional Police Service said in a statement on Thursday (December 28, 2023), \"Although these offences occurred at places of worship, they do not appear to be hate crimes or motivated by hate.\" Police said on October 8 its personnel responded to reports of a break-and-enter in progress at a Hindu temple in the area of Bayly Street and Krosno Boulevard in Pickering. \"A male was seen on security surveillance breaking into the temple and taking a large quantity of cash from the donation boxes,\" police said. \"The male fled the area prior to police arrival. The male was seen on surveillance footage later that morning committing additional break-and-enters at Hindu temples in Pickering and Ajax,\" read the statement. Investigators have linked the same suspect to numerous other break-and-enters at Hindu temples throughout the year.
