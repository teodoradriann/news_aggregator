On Tuesday, Kristopher Taylor Jr., 47, was charged with “Collision Involving Death, a second-degree felony offense,” according to police. As a result of an extensive joint investigation with the Fort Cavazos Criminal Investigation Division, traffic investigators were able to identify the suspect, Killeen Police Department announced in a news release on Thursday. The United States Marshals Service-Lone Star Fugitive Task Force also assisted. Taylor was located and arrested on Wednesday without incident in Bryan. He was taken to the Brazos County Jail and is pending arraignment. The fatal wreck happened a year ago. “On Sunday, June 11, 2023, at approximately 2:31 a.m., officers were dispatched to the 1900 block of E. Elms Road in reference to a crash. Upon the officers’ arrival, paramedics were on scene attending to a male lying in the roadway with serious injuries. The victim, Eric Rucker, succumbed to his injuries,” according to the release. Back in June 2023, the preliminary investigation revealed that two motorcycle operators were traveling westbound when the victim dropped an item in the roadway. Both motorcyclists stopped and got off their motorcycles to retrieve the item. While the victim was trying to recover the dropped item, he was struck by a passing vehicle, according to the release.

    "text": "Leer todo el artículo EFE Latam Estados Unidos condena \"cualquier intento de subvertir el orden constitucional\" en Bolivia Agencia EFE 28 de junio de 2024, 1:10 a.m. · 2 min de lectura Enlace copiado\nAsunción/Washington, 27 jun (EFE).- Estados Unidos condenó este jueves \"cualquier intento de subvertir el orden constitucional\" en Bolivia y consideró que los acontecimientos de las últimas 24 horas muestran que la democracia sigue siendo \"frágil\" en el continente americano.\nEstas declaraciones las realizó el subsecretario de Estado de EE.UU. para Gestión y Recursos, Richard R. Verma, durante la Asamblea General de la Organización de los Estados Americanos (OEA) en Paraguay y representan la primera condena explícita de Washington a lo ocurrido en Bolivia.\n\"Condenamos enérgicamente el despliegue ilegal de unidades del Ejército en Bolivia, así como cualquier intento de subvertir el orden constitucional\", afirmó Verma, quien forma parte de la delegación estadounidense en la Asamblea General de la OEA, el foro más importante del organismo.\nVerma se refirió precisamente a la importancia de la OEA como organismo y consideró que \"los acontecimientos de las últimas 24 horas en Bolivia dejan claro que la democracia sigue siendo frágil en el hemisferio\".\n\"Debemos trabajar juntos, en línea con la Carta de la OEA y la Carta Democrática Interamericana, para proteger las instituciones democráticas de nuestros países\", añadió Verma, quien consideró que aunque los países de la región enfrentan \"desafíos\" también hay muchas razones para la \"esperanza\".\nEsta es la primera condena de Washington a los acontecimientos, después de que ayer adoptara una postura prudente. No hubo declaraciones públicas y solo una portavoz de la Casa Blanca dijo a EFE en una breve declaración escrita: \"Estados Unidos está siguiendo de cerca la situación en Bolivia e insta a la calma y moderación\".\nLa portavoz de la Casa Blanca, Karine Jean-Pierre, fue preguntada este jueves sobre la crisis en Bolivia. \"Nos alegra que se haya restaurado la calma, y lo dejaré ahí\", respondió en declaraciones a periodistas que viajan a bordo del Air Force One.\nEl miércoles por la tarde, tropas leales al ahora excomandante general del Ejército boliviano Juan José Zuñiga rodearon la sede del Poder Ejecutivo en La Paz en un intento por cambiar el gabinete.\nEl presidente de Bolivia, Luis Arce, quien llegó a encararse con Zuñiga en la entrada del edificio, denunció que se trataba de un \"acto ostensiblemente violento y contrario al orden constitucional\" y llamó al pueblo boliviano a movilizarse en favor de la democracia.\nTras el intento de golpe, el mandatario del país andino nombró nuevos comandantes del Ejército, quienes llamaron a las tropas a volver a los cuarteles, orden que fue cumplida.\nZuñiga fue detenido y acusó a Arce de haber planeado un autogolpe para aumentar su popularidad.\n(c) Agencia EFE",

See story WEATHER Gerrit. Infographic PA Graphics. An editable version of this graphic is available if required. Please contact graphics@pamediagroup.com. Three men died after their 4×4 vehicle was submerged in the River Esk, near Glaisdale, on Thursday, North Yorkshire Police said.\nA supercell thunderstorm moved across the northwest of England on Thursday after a similar storm is thought to have resulted in a tornado that damaged homes in Greater Manchester on Wednesday.\nAround 100 properties were damaged by what police called a “localised tornado” in Stalybridge, Tameside and in the badly-hit village of Carrbrook.\nHayley McCaffer, 40, who lives in Carrbrook, told the PA news agency that some of her neighbours’ houses “are an absolute disaster” with missing roofs and “squished” cars.\nDamage will be covered by standard property insurance policies, the Association of British Insurers has said.\nScreengrab taken from PA Video of a damaged gate in Stalybridge after the Tameside tornado (Richard McCarthy/PA) ScotRail said many lines have been reopened but urged passengers to check for the latest information before travelling, a message echoed by LNER, Avanti West Coast and London Northwestern Railway who suspensed or cancelled services due to damage or system faults.\nFriday will see significant disruption for travellers wishing to travel on the London Euston and Watford Junction lines with services expected to be up and running by the end of the day.\nIn Wales, the aftermath of the recent severe weather will see rail services hampered until Monday.\n🌦️ Blustery showers are possible on Friday morning, with these most likely in the north and west. Many of us will also see some sunshine and some places may stay dry.\n🌬️ Still windy in northern England and later Shetland, with gales possible, but otherwise somewhat less windy. pic.twitter.com/hInP8LNF2c\n— Met Office (@metoffice) December 28, 2023\nFerry services also experienced cancellations and delays due to storm activity with operator DFDS confirming sailings between Dover and France were delayed due to strong winds in the English Channel.\nAir travel in and out of the UK saw cancellations but most services have returned to normal.\nThe Met Office reported the worst of Storm Gerrit had passed with the last few days of 2023 forecast to be unsettled with strong winds, rain and even snow on higher ground.\nMet Office chief forecaster Steven Ramsdale said: “Heavy rain will spread across all but the far north on Saturday, affecting similar areas previously affected by Storm Gerrit. However, this rainfall will be a step down from that seen during Storm Gerrit.”",

    "text": "The time has come to accept these eco-friendly methods and collaborate to transform end-of-life aluminium products, creating a route towards a more sustainable and prosperous future for the generations ahead.Sustainability has become a key focus for industries across the globe, and the concept of a circular economy has gained significant traction. Engineered Aluminium is at the forefront of this movement, a versatile and infinitely recyclable material with immense potential for closing the loop on end-of-life products. With its myriad applications and high recyclability rate, engineered Aluminium presents a compelling case for implementing circular economy strategies that conserve resources and drive economic growth and environmental stewardship.Aluminium's sustainability credentials stem from its unique properties and the efficiency of its recycling process. Unlike many other materials, Aluminium does not degrade during recycling and can be endlessly reprocessed without losing its inherent properties. It makes it an ideal candidate for closed-loop recycling systems, where products at the end of their life cycle are collected, sorted, and recycled back into new products, thus minimizing waste and reducing the need for virgin resources.The Journey of Aluminium to End-User ProductsAluminium is the third most abundant element in the Earth's crust. The journey of its production begins with the extraction and processing of bauxite, its primary ore, into a refined form, which subsequently undergoes different manufacturing techniques to produce an extensive range of downstream and engineered products tailored to multiple industry-specific requirements. Across various sectors, including transportation, construction, packaging and electronics, Aluminium finds many applications with products boasting a decades-long lifespan. However, the end-of-life phase is where Aluminium shines, presenting unique opportunities for recovering and repurposing it into the production cycle.Aluminium's Everlasting PropertiesAt the centre of Aluminium's sustainability aspect lies its remarkable ability to retain its intrinsic properties through reuse. Unlike many other materials that degrade with each recovery cycle, Aluminium maintains its high integrity, making it endlessly reusable without any significant loss in quality or performance. Data indicates that about 75 per cent of all the Aluminium ever produced is still being used today. Moreover, it takes only 5 per cent of the total energy required to make the same quantity of virgin Aluminium. This unique characteristic also enhances the economic viability of Aluminium's recovery while significantly reducing companies' environmental footprint. As a result, it has emerged as an ideal candidate for circular economy initiatives, offering a compelling solution for closing the loop on the material consumption cycle for a more sustainable and resource-efficient future.Circular Economy Strategies for AluminiumA critical aspect of achieving a circular economy for Aluminium involves implementing efficient recovery processes. These encompass a range of techniques designed to efficiently reclaim Aluminium from end-of-life products, including collecting, sorting and processing methods to extract its valuable metal content. The benefits of reusing Aluminium in manufacturing processes are substantial, where industries can conserve natural resources and reduce the dependency on virgin ore extraction from primary production. Efficient Recovery Process Design: By designing products with easy-to-dismantle elements, manufacturers can facilitate the separation of Aluminium from other materials during recycling, streamlining the recovery process and maximizing resource utilization. Upcycling: Upcycling transforms end-of-life aluminium items into new, higher-value products with improved functionality or aesthetic appeal. By repurposing these materials creatively, upcycling not only diverts waste from landfills but also adds value to discarded items, contributing to the circular economy by creating new opportunities for resource utilization and economic growth.The integration of advanced technologies holds immense promise in optimizing the recovery cycle and enhancing supply chain management within the aluminium industry. AI-tracking systems are helping trace recovered Aluminium through its production stages, ensuring transparency in the process. The potential for scaling up these circular economy strategies within international aluminium supply chains presents a compelling opportunity to drive systemic change on a global scale. Harnessing Aluminium's timeless properties is a shining opportunity to realize circular economy principles in real-world situations, achieving sustainable development goals for countries. The time has come to accept these eco-friendly methods and collaborate to transform end-of-life aluminium products, creating a route towards a more sustainable and prosperous future for the generations ahead.",

    "text": "We're heading into the NFL postseason, and we have 6 games on the schedule for NFL Wild Card Weekend . Weather is going to play a huge factor, which is something we'll be watching awfully close as it affects our plays.Saturday's K.C. outlook -- when the Kansas City Chiefs (11-6) host the Miami Dolphins (11-6) -- calls for 0 degrees with winds at 13-16 MPH. The good news is that there is no precipitation in the forecast.The same cannot be said for Orchard Park, N.Y., where the Pittsburgh Steelers (10-7) visit the Buffalo Bills (11-6) Sunday. They will not only face temperatures of 21 degrees, but there is a 60% chance of snow with 22-24 MPH winds. This season, the Under cashed at a 14-2-1 rate in games played with an average wind speed of 13 MPH or greater.Wrapping up the schedule Monday, rain is expected in Tampa. There is a 70% chance of the wet stuff, but at least temperatures will be in the upper 60's with a 6-8 MPH.After looking at FanDuel Sportsbook's NFL Wild Card Weekend odds , here is our \"Let's make some money\" NFL parlay bet to cash in on among SportbookWire's NFL expert picks and predictions .We have 3 rematches from the regular season, too. In fact, the Cleveland Browns (11-6) and Houston Texans (10-7) just met in Week 16 at NRG Stadium in Houston with the Browns winning 36-22 as 3-point favorites with the Over (40) easily connecting.The Dolphins and Chiefs probably wish they could go back to Frankfurt, Germany, and play, instead of being in a refrigerator this weekend. Kansas City earned a 21-14 win over Miami in Germany back in Week 9, covering as a 1-point underdog as the Under (51.5) cashed.Lastly, the Philadelphia Eagles (11-6) and Tampa Bay Buccaneers (9-8) met for Monday Night Football in Tampa back in Week 3. Philadelphia came away with a 25-11 win and cover as a 5.5-point favorite as the Under (44) hit. That was a while ago, and Philly was playing much better football. They meet again in Tampa this Monday for the final game of the Wild Card round. FOOTBALL NEVER STOPS Live games, analysis and more 7 days a week: Get ESPN+ Odds provided by FanDuel Sportsbook ; access USA TODAY Sports Scores and Sports Betting Odds hub for a full list. Lines last updated Friday at 12:01 a.m. ET. All games ET. There is a lot being made out of geography ahead of this game. Obviously, the Dolphins play in tropical conditions more often than not, rarely having to deal with low temperatures.We're not likely going to see Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes and Dolphins QB Tua Tagovailoa spinning it frequently. Expect both teams to count on the run. Both of the Dolphins RBs, Raheem Mostert and De'Von Achane , are capable of housing it, while the Chiefs counter with RB Isiah Pacheco . With their physical styles, all 3 should be tough to tackle on a frigid afternoon.The combination of Mostert and Achane will wear down the defending champs, helping the warm-weather Dolphins keep it close and cover.Plus, the public drove this number up quite a bit, from an open of 1.5, and I never like siding with the public.The weather is going to be absolutely atrocious. If you love a good snow game, then you are going to love the weather at Highmark Stadium Sunday.The forecast calls for temperatures around 20 degrees with a 60 percent or greater chance of snow throughout the game. If that wasn't enough, they're calling for winds whipping off of Lake Erie anywhere from 22-26 MPH with gusts to gale force.We're unlikely to see much in the way of passing as Steelers QB Mason Rudolph and Bills QB Josh Allen would do well to keep it on the ground. Allen and the Bills will have a leg up as he can tuck it and go. Buffalo RB James Cook is likely to see a strong workload, too.In addition to the passing games being hindered, the kicking game will be affected, too. Think back to Dec. 6, 2021, when the Bills hosted the New England Patriots on a Monday night, and we had snow and ice with heavy winds crushing the pass and kick games. In fact, field-goal attempts were downright comical. We're going to get one of those kind of games, and points are going to be at a premium.The Packers (9-8) head into Jerry World , and it could be considered the Mike McCarthy revenge game. The Dallas coach will get a crack at his former employer, and while the personnel has mostly changed, the logo on the helmet remains the same.More importantly, though, the Packers barely made the playoffs, while the Cowboys (12-5) caught fire at the end of the season, blew past the Eagles and rolled to the NFC East title. The Cowboys scored 33 or more points in 6 of the final 9 games as QB Dak Prescott had the offense humming.The Packers won 3 games down the stretch, but all of those victories came against non-playoff teams. Wins are wins, and Green Bay qualified for the playoffs, but they're not likely going to be around very long. Green Bay was just 2-5 ATS in its final 7 road games, while Dallas went 6-2 ATS in 8 games this season at home. Parlay payout: Bet $10 to profit $58.14 (payout = $68.14). Try out the USA TODAY Parlay Calculator . *-If you want to add a 4th play to this parlay. The Browns and Texans kick off the Wild Card round in H-Town, and as mentioned, these teams are familiar with each other. Cleveland fired out to a 22-7 lead by halftime in their 1st meeting and led 36-7 with 12:31 to go, before settling for the 36-22 victory.Don't expect the same type of high-scoring game, but the winning result should be the same.The Browns finished with 418 total yards of offense in that 1st meeting with QB Joe Flacco throwing for 368 yards, and WR Amari Cooper setting a single-game franchise record with 265 receiving yards on 11 catches with 2 TDs. It's safe to say Cooper won't have anywhere near that production -- if he even plays at all. He has been sidelined with a heel injury.The matchup features Houston rookie QB C.J. Stroud against the former Super Bowl MVP Flacco. Experience will be a huge difference. Flacco has been the consummate professional since landing in Cleveland, and he and the starters are well-rested after basically a week off. Nearly all starters sat in Week 18 at Cincinnati with the team locked into the AFC's No. 5 seed. So the bumps and bruises are mended, and this Browns team is ready to roll.

    "text": "Halle Bailey, que nunca confirmó que estuviera embarazada, anuncia el nacimiento de su bebé\nRocío Muñoz-Ledo\n(CNN) — La cantante y estrella de “La Sirenita” Halle Bailey da la bienvenida a un nuevo bebé que formará parte de su mundo.\n“Aunque llevamos pocos días de año nuevo, lo mejor que ha podido hacer 2023 por mí ha sido traerme a mi hijo”, escribió Bailey en su cuenta de Instagram junto a una foto en la que se ve la mano de su hijo recién nacido con una pulsera de oro con su nombre, “Halo”, grabado.\n“Bienvenido al mundo, mi halo”, escribió. “El mundo está ansioso por conocerte”.\nHalle Bailey comparte un momento difícil que vivió en la grabación de “The Little Mermaid”\nEl novio de Bailey, el rapero DDG, publicó la misma foto en su Instagram este sábado, y escribió: “mi mayor bendición por mucho” y que “nunca había estado tan enamorado”.\nLa pareja, a la que se vincula sentimentalmente desde 2022, no había confirmado que estuvieran esperando un bebé, por lo que el anuncio de este sábado fue una sorpresa.\nAunque no se pronunció sobre el crecimiento de su familia, Bailey ya había hablado de su floreciente relación con DDG en una entrevista de 2022 con la revista British Vogue en la que dijo que “experimentar un amor profundo por primera vez en mi vida es algo que creo que me ha abierto un mundo completamente nuevo desde el punto de vista creativo”.\n“Me gustan todos los sentimientos aterradores que vienen con eso. Me gusta el suspenso, el no saber qué va a pasar, y siento que eso es lo que se supone que tengo que vivir en la feminidad”, añadió.\nEste es el primer hijo en común de Bailey y DDG.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

    "title": "SEQUÍA: Andalucía se despide del año más seco en tres décadas y pone la puntilla a la sequía más larga desde que hay registros",
    "text": "Doce meses atrás, el análisis meteorológico global para Andalucía en 2022 situaba a aquel año como el más cálido y uno de lo más secos desde que se toman registros de temperatura y precipitación en la región. Por fortuna, diciembre de 2022 tuvo una importante inyección húmeda en forma de lluvias intensas y persistentes, que maquillaron los valores finales del año y dieron esperanza para que el 2023 marcara el cambio de tendencia meteorológica. Un año después, no sólo no ha cambiado, ha ido a peor. Así se seca La Viñuela, el embalse que riega el aguacate y el mango de Málaga\n2023 ha estado caracterizado en Andalucía, de nuevo, por la intensa sequía y por los episodios de calor extremo. A falta de que la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología emita su habitual informe anual, ya ha avanzado que probablemente sea el segundo más cálido de toda la serie histórica y el año que haya puesto la puntilla a la sequía más prolongada desde que existen registros en todo el sur peninsular. Las cuencas hidrográficas del Guadalquivir, el Guadiana, y las del resto del sur andaluz viven la sequía más larga jamás registrada , superando ya a la histórica de los años 90.\nCon el actual, Andalucía lleva en sequía meteorológica la friolera de casi ocho años consecutivos. Un periodo con altibajos y que ha concentrado en los dos últimos años los peores registros de precipitación en el conjunto de las estaciones meteorológicas de la región. Si ya el pasado año las capitales andaluzas acumularon un déficit medio del 16 % respecto a lo normal, el de 2023 va a cerrar con una carencia del 45 % respecto a lo habitual. Dicho de otro modo, en los últimos 12 meses ha llovido casi la mitad de lo que debería haberse registrado.\nEl año más seco desde principios de los 90 El valor, que a duras penas ha ido maquillándose con la entrada reciente de diversos sistemas frontales, se sitúa como el más bajo de las tres últimas décadas, acercándose a los registros más extremos de la sequía de comienzos de los 90. Además, y a diferencia de 2022, el presente año termina con todos los observatorios meteorológicos de la red principal andaluza con valores de precipitación acumulada por debajo de lo normal. Casi todos rondan entre el 40 y el 50 % de sus registros medios, aunque destaca el caso de la capital malagueña donde la lluvia caída desde el 1 de enero ha acumulado un déficit del 66 % respecto a lo habitual. Es decir, ha llovido un tercio de lo que debería haber llovido en condiciones normales.\nEl mes de abril marcó un hito en toda la región con temperaturas propias de verano en el valle del Guadalquivir\nComo es lógico, los pobres valores de precipitación acumulada durante todo el año han tenido reflejo en las reservas hídricas de la región. La cuenca del Guadalquivir, la mayor en capacidad y que vertebra el territorio, llega a finales de 2023 al 19 % de su capacidad total, lo que supone unos cinco puntos menos que hace un año. De igual modo, la del Guadiana o las cuencas mediterráneas andaluzas, comenzarán el nuevo año con valores muy por debajo respecto a enero de 2023, situándose al 26.6 y al 19.1 % de su capacidad respectivamente. De ellas, las mediterráneas han perdido casi 19 puntos respecto a los valores en que se encontraban a finales de 2022. Datos por completo nefastos y que situarán a comienzos de 2024 las reservas de agua del conjunto de la región a poco más del 20 % de su capacidad total, 8 puntos por debajo de lo registrado el pasado 1 de enero.\n2023, año de registros extremos propios de un clima alterado Junto a la escasez de lluvia, las altas temperaturas han sido, otro año más, las protagonistas meteorológicas del 2023. Los episodios por calor extremo se han sucedido a lo largo de todo el curso, y de entre todos, han destacado tres. Más allá del verano, las altas temperaturas, o más bien, unas temperaturas anormalmente elevadas, protagonizaron los meses de abril, octubre y diciembre. En todas las ocasiones, los valores de temperatura media o absoluta se situaron muy por encima de lo habitual para la época del año en que ocurrieron. Ocasiones que la propia Agencia Estatal de Meteorología ha ido situando como propias de un clima alterado, y de las que sin duda destaca el vivido durante el pasado mes de abril.\nDesde finales del pasado marzo y hasta comienzos de mayo, todo el sur y buena parte del resto del territorio peninsular vivieron una situación de permanente estabilidad anticiclónica con la irrupción puntual de masas de aire muy cálidas en altura. Dicha situación llegó a concluir como un hito nunca antes registrado y que tuvo a Andalucía, y particularmente a todo el valle del Guadalquivir como epicentro del episodio. La anomalía de las temperaturas medias del mes llegó a superar los 4 grados en numerosos puntos de la depresión bética . La intensidad del episodio llegó a dejar nuevos récords de temperatura máxima para la España peninsular en un mes de abril, alcanzándose los 38.8 °C en la capital cordobesa. Valores propios de los meses de julio o agosto y que rompían por casi cinco grados los anteriores registros históricos mensuales.\nPero no sólo abril. La sensación de rotura climática ha ido salpicando el resto del año con otros dos episodios de patrón similar aunque mucho más concentrados en el tiempo. Entre finales de septiembre y la primera semana de octubre, y a comienzos del mes de diciembre, la estabilidad anticiclónica y la entrada de aire anormalmente cálido en altura volvían a dejar registros extremos mensuales en numerosas estaciones meteorológicas de la región. En octubre de 2023, Sevilla y Córdoba, junto a otras localidades andaluzas, batían sus registros históricos para el mes . Por su parte, la capital malagueña y el resto de localidades de la Costa del Sol, marcaban un hito durante la tarde del 12 de diciembre con máximas que rozaban los 30 grados a poco más de una semana del comienzo del invierno astronómico.\nSin cambio de rumbo claro para el 2024 El futuro inmediato no es especialmente prometedor. A pesar de que los primeros días de 2024 estarán protagonizados por diversos episodios borrascosos que dejarán precipitaciones en la mayor parte de la región, el avance climatológico de la AEMET para los primeros meses del año desdibuja cualquier síntoma de cambio de tendencia radical que pudiese llegar. La propia Agencia prevé un trimestre de enero a marzo mucho más cálido de lo normal y unas lluvias, eso sí, que podrían terminar en valores de relativa normalidad. Sea como sea, lo que parece evidente y a la vista de los datos es que Andalucía llega exhausta al 2024, casi sin capacidad para resistir otro año como el que ahora termina.\nÚnete al canal de Telegram de elDiario.es Andalucía A través de nuestro canal en Telegram trasladamos de forma inmediata lo que ocurre en Sevilla y Andalucía: últimas noticias que van aconteciendo, o dónde, y te ofrecemos un resumen de la información más relevante del día.",
