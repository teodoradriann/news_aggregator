    "text": "Yesterday we learned that Kevin Roberts, the cosplaying Yall Qaeda coal roller truck driving, Lucchese cowboy boot-wearing president of the Heritage Foundation whose Project 2025 preaches the centrality of “the family” as the foundation of American society, a foundation to be achieved in part by forcing impregnated incest and rape victims to give birth, is so far astray from the teachings of Jesus that he reportedly once bragged about killing a neighbors’ dog with a shovel.\n[…]\nToday […] Opus Dei [a Catholic organization that exists today at the red-hot center of the judicial and right-wing donor world in Washington D.C.] has achieved influence at the highest echelon of American power. The organization has been increasingly active in Washington since at least the early 1990s when it set up shop at 15th and K — the heart of the capital lobbying industry. From there, one of its priests (wearing a spiked garter under his robes to restrict his bodily urges) converted at least a half dozen of the top right-wingers in Washington to the Opus Dei brand of regressive Catholicism. Among his converts — future Trump administration National Economic Advisor Larry Kudlow, and other men in the highest echelons of American law and government — future House Speaker Newt Gingrich, former Senator Sam Brownback, failed Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork, and many other leaders who found themselves in need to priestly guidance.\nSome of the most powerful figures in American politics and political finance today have Opus Dei connections. One of the most effective Opus Dei-affiliated Catholics in DC today is Leonard Leo, bagman for rightist billionaires, who spent decades working to capture the federal judiciary for the anti-choice movement. Five of the six members of the right side of the Supreme Court are right-wing Catholic — Chief Justice Roberts, Amy Coney Barrett, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Brett Kavanaugh who replaced Opus Dei adjacent Antonin Scalia after Mitch McConnell refused to let Obama fill his vacancy for almost a year. These modern-day priest-kings have been working to force American law into line with a creed most Americans — including the vast majority of Catholics — reject — all under the guise of “religious freedom.”\n[…]\n[log in or register](/login)to comment.\n[masterofn001 ( @masterofn001@lemmy.ca )](/u/masterofn001@lemmy.ca)1•2 hours agoone of its priests (wearing a spiked garter under his robes to restrict his bodily urges)\nUm, yeah, that’s definitely some cuck/chastity/kink shit.\nIf you need spikes to resist urges, you’re not the kind of person who should be talking about regulating people’s urges.\n[hddsx ( @hddsx@lemmy.ca )](/u/hddsx@lemmy.ca)7•8 hours agoI had to read the title twice.

The numerical sequences can range anywhere from [000](/story/life/2022/11/30/angel-number-000-meaning/10589434002/) to [999](/story/life/2023/01/30/angel-number-999-meaning/10806425002/), with each number having a distinct meaning and energy, USA Today previously [reported. ](/story/life/2022/11/06/what-are-angel-numbers-meanings-numerology/10525252002/) The once-in-a-century date, which won’t be seen again on our calenders until Dec. 31, 2123, marks a new beginning. One, that asks us to “transform and evolve with the times and in the right place to embrace what is coming to us,” [according to the Old Farmer’s Almanac website. ](https://www.almanac.com/123123-meaning-123123) The date has also sparked an online trend, with TikTok users creating videos on the significance of the number and merchandise commemorating the date selling online, including on platforms like [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=123123&ref=cs_503_search), [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2332490.m570.l1313&_nkw=123123&_sacat=0) and [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/market/123123?ref=seller_tag_bottom_image-1), the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA Today Network [reported.](/story/news/local/michigan/2023/12/27/angel-number-meaning-123123-last-day-year-numerology/72001298007/) Here’s what we know about the date. What does 12/31/23 signify within numerology? [Numerology is an ancient esoteric science](https://www.britannica.com/topic/numerology) that deals with numbers and letters and the energy, intention and vibration behind them, professional numerologist [Novalee Wilder](https://www.novaleewilder.com/) shared with USA Today earlier this month. \"Before there was even language, there were numbers,\" she said. \"Before we had named things, we had counted them, and we had assigned meaning to that count.\" The numbers that make up the angel number are just as important as the whole number, especially when you are trying to determine the vibration and intention behind the number. Professional astrologer [Narayana Montúfar](https://www.naramon.com/) told [ Farmer’s Almanac ](https://www.almanac.com/123123-meaning-123123) that the “Number 1 brings the very spark of initiation, 2 focuses on building, and 3 is related to the concept of creation. Together, the sequence of these three numbers speaks of the spark of initiation that seeks to build a new creation.” If you add all the numbers that make up the date 123123 together, you will come up with 12. The number 12 in numerology can symbolize spiritual enlightenment, with potential for the day to deliver epiphanies and “aha” moments for individuals and society at large, the website stated.

    "text": "Mig segle de l’atemptat que va sacsejar el Portús per venjar Salvador Puig Antich\nUn cotxe bomba va explotar davant un establiment comercial sense produir-se danys personals\nMalgrat la seva gravetat, els fets van tenir repercussió a França i van passar inadvertits a la Jonquera\nSònia Fuentes\nFa cinquanta anys, un cotxe bomba va explotar al\n[Portús](/tags/el-pertus/), just davant d'un establiment comercial, la perfumeria Comas. L’atemptat, reivindicat pels Grups d’Acció Revolucionària Internacionalista (GARI), va tenir com a objectiu venjar la mort de Salvador Puig Antich, executat pel règim franquista el 1974. Malgrat la gravetat dels fets, la presència d’un arbre davant del negoci, va mitigar l’impacte de la detonació, evitant danys personals. Albert Comas, el propietari de l’establiment, encara recorda aquell moment i com va haver de sufocar el foc que va afectar la seva llar. \"Crec que el cotxe bomba es va col·locar davant casa seva perquè el meu pare havia penjat banderes espanyoles, catalanes i franceses a la façana, i potser els atacants van pensar que érem una entitat o ajuntament», explica.\nL’atemptat es va produir el 29 de juliol de 1974, pocs mesos després de l’assassinat de Puig Antich, (1948-1974), qui es va convertir en una figura clau de la resistència contra el franquisme. Detingut i acusat d’haver participat en un atracament que va acabar amb la mort d’un policia, Puig Antich va ser condemnat a mort després d’un judici ple de controvèrsies i dubtes sobre la seva imparcialitat. L’execució, realitzada mitjançant el garrot vil el 2 de març de 1974, va convertir Puig Antich en un símbol de la lluita contra la repressió franquista, inspirant nombrosos moviments socials i polítics tant a Catalunya com a la resta d’Espanya i Europa.\nDesprés de la seva mort, els GARI, una organització armada d’orientació llibertària creada per internacionalitzar la lluita contra el franquisme, van dur a terme diverses accions armades per evitar que altres membres del MIL, com Oriol Solé Sugranyes i Josep Lluís Pons Llobet, acabessin amb el mateix destí. Aquests militants es trobaven empresonats i pendents de judici, i els GARI volien evitar una nova execució.\nPoca repercussió a la Jonquera\nTot i la gravetat dels fets, l’atemptat al Portús va tenir més repercussió a França que a Espanya on va passar gairebé desapercebut, fins i tot entre els veïns de\nla Jonquera. No obstant això, la memòria persisteix entre els habitants del Portús, especialment per a Comas, que té molt presents aquells moments. «L’explosió va ser de matinada, al número 100 de l’avinguda Catalunya, en una carretera que, tot i ser francesa, té la vorera espanyola. Vaig baixar corrents en pijama amb un extintor per apagar el foc. L’arbre davant de casa va atenuar l’impacte, però la porta del vehicle va volar pels aires, entrant per la claraboia fins a dins de casa», relata Comas, que llavors tenia vint-i-quatre anys.\nL’explosió va ser de matinada, al número 100 de l’avinguda Catalunya. Un arbre va atenuar l’impacte, però la porta del vehicle va volar i va entrar a casa\"\nComas explica que, afortunadament, no hi va haver danys personals gràcies a la presència de l’arbre que encara avui es conserva. Malgrat això, els productes exposats davant de la botiga van quedar destrossats. «Els danys materials van ser coberts per l’estat francès. Recordo que al barri francès del Portús, en aquell temps, hi havia unes 22 persones amb negocis de canvi de divises. Just davant de casa nostra hi havia dues persones treballant, però per sort ja havien marxat quan va explotar el cotxe. És possible que els responsables esperessin que la gent marxés per fer esclatar el vehicle a les dues o tres de la matinada», diu Comas.\nEls Gari i el Tour de França\nEls GARI van aprofitar la cobertura mediàtica del Tour de França aquell estiu de 1974 per denunciar la repressió franquista i venjar la mort de Puig Antich amb una sèrie d’atemptats coordinats. El 22 de juliol, el Tour de França va passar per la Jonquera, i dies més tard, el 29 de juliol, el cotxe bomba va esclatar al Portús. Aquell mateix dia, altres atemptats van sacsejar París, on van explotar dos autocars de la SEAFEP, mentre un altre cotxe bomba va ser desactivat a Bourg-Madame, a la Catalunya del Nord.\nGas Mountain recorda els fets\nAquest any, en commemoració del cinquantè aniversari de la mort de Salvador Puig Antich, l’associació Gas Mountain, dedicada a promoure l’activitat a l’aire lliure, l’esport, la conservació de la natura i la memòria històrica a l’Empordà, ha decidit recordar aquest esdeveniment. Amb aquesta iniciativa, es pretén revifar la memòria d’uns fets que, amb el temps, s’han anat diluint en la consciència col·lectiva, fins i tot entre els veïns de la Jonquera i altres localitats properes.\nCinquanta anys després de la seva mort, Salvador Puig Antich continua sent un símbol de resistència i compromís amb la llibertat. Al llarg d’aquest any, s’han celebrat múltiples homenatges en honor a la seva figura, mantenint viu el seu llegat.\nSubscriu-te per seguir llegint\nAquest és el poble gironí que s'ha convertit en la meca del turisme de compres Necrològiques del 9 d'agost de 2024 L'exnúmero 2 de la Policia Nacional a Catalunya assassina la seva parella, la seva exdona i se suïcida Un home de 67 anys mor ofegat a la platja del Port Bo de Palafrugell",
