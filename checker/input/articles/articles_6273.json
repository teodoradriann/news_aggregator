    "title": "Cardinal tries to ban girls from being altar servers",
    "text": "Sri Lankan Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith of Colombo has tried to ban girls from serving as altar servers in his archdiocese, on the grounds that the role of altar server is potentially part of the pathway to the male-only priesthood and having girls as altar servers could impact vocations.\nIn a 22 October 2024 letter addressed to the priests of his diocese, which has since come to light, Ranjith said: “It has been brought to my knowledge that several parishes in the Archdiocese of Colombo have appointed girls as altar servers.\n“In this context, I wish to reiterate, what I stated at the presbyteral meeting held on Oct. 21, 2024, that no girls should be invited to serve at the altar, as altar servers in the archdiocese.”\nRanjith insisted that “it should always be young boys” who take on the role of altar server, “because this is one of the main sources of vocations to the priesthood in Sri Lanka and it will affect the number of candidates entering the seminaries, [the risk of which] we cannot take”.\n“Since females are not allowed to be ordained priests, we have to make that decision,” he said, warning priests that “this cannot be changed at your discretion”.\nHe asked them to comply with the rule “as faithfully as possible and do not think that it is in your faculty to grant [otherwise]”, and thanked them for their “usual cooperation”.\nRanjith, 77, has served as archbishop of Sri Lanka since 2009 and was given a red hat by Pope Benedict XVI in 2010, after previously holding various positions in Vatican diplomacy, including as the Vatican’s envoy to Indonesia and East Timor, and as secretary of the then-Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments from 2005-2009.\nHe also served as adjunct secretary of the Vatican’s Congregation for the Evangelisation of Peoples from 2001-2004.\nRanjith, who has been dubbed by some as the “little Ratzinger” due to his short stature and more conservative theological leanings, raised several eyebrows with the letter, especially as Pope Francis himself formally lifted the ban on girls becoming altar servers three years ago.\nIn 2021, Pope Francis issued a new law formalising the ability for women and girls to be lectors and altar servers at Mass, something which had long been common practice in Western countries such as the United States but had yet to be written formally into law.\nPrevious to that, in 2016 Pope Francis made a similar gesture when he modified the rubric for the foot-washing ritual during Mass on Holy Thursday, formally allowing women to be selected, and putting an official stamp on a practice that, again, had been common for years in countries such as the United States.\nThese moves were hailed by many progressives as significant steps forward in terms of facilitating a greater sense of inclusion for women in the Church.\nSince his election in 2013, Pope Francis has gone to great lengths to underline the role of women in the Catholic Church and has spoken often about the need to place more competent, professionally apt women in positions of authority, leadership and governance.\nHe has named several women to leadership roles in Vatican departments and has appointed several women to his Council for the Economy and has even appointed women to a group that helps vet candidates for the episcopacy.\nThe role of women was a major talking point during the Pope’s recently concluded Synod of Bishops on Synodality, and it has also been a primary talking point in this year’s meetings of the Council of Cardinals, the advisory body that assists Pope Francis in matters of governance and reform.\nThough specific issues such as women’s priestly ordination and their ordination as deacons have currently been taken off of the table, the discussion on how to more fully incorporate women into meaningful positions of leadership in the Church continues.\nYet while the practice of women serving as lectors, acolytes and altar servers had long been commonplace in western countries prior to Pope Francis’s edicts – making Ranjith’s letter a potential shock to some who might feel they are reading something from far in the Church’s past – this is not necessarily the case for the Catholic Church in all areas of the global South, many of which still tend to have more conservative leanings.\nAs a theological conservative, Ranjith could also be motivated in his decision by the traditional view that an altar server is a formal aide to the priest who – acting in persona Christi (“in the person of Christ”) – has to be male in order to offer the Eucharist and the rest of the sacraments available to the faithful.\nRanjith’s ban on girl altar servers will likely ruffle the feathers of many Catholic women and progressives who see the move as an impediment to progress, and potentially also a direct rebuke of Pope Francis and his reforms.\nHowever, in his 2021 edict formalising the ability of women to serve as lectors, acolytes and altar servers, Francis said its implementation would depend on the discernment of local bishops, and the specific needs of evangelisation in their territories.\nIn Ministeria quaedam , the Pope instructed bishops to establish “adequate criteria” for both the “discernment and the preparation of men and women candidates” to these roles, according to the specific criteria he outlined in the text, and “subject to the approval of the Holy See and according to the needs of evangelization in their territory”.\nSri Lanka is a nation where Christianity is a minority, as 70 per cent of the population of around 21.6 million are Buddhist, followed by Hindus and Muslims.\nChristians themselves make up just seven to eight per cent of the population, most of whom are Catholic, with Catholics numbering somewhere around 1.5 million.\nCatholicism in Sri Lanka remains the only major religious denomination that crosses the local ethnic divide separating Sinhalese and Tamil communities, with a significant portion of both camps adhering to the Catholic Church.",

    "title": "‘May the 4th be with you’: How World War II influenced ‘Star Wars’",
    "text": "“By accident, a great deal [of J.R.R. Tolkien’s book series “The Lord of the Rings”] can be read topically,” Maj. Warren Lewis, brother to C.S. Lewis, wrote in possibly the first ever review of the novel in 1949. “The Shire standing for England, Rohan for France, Gondor the Germany of the future, Sauron for Stalin.”\nAnd while Tolkien later explicitly rejected the idea that his “story was an allegory of any historical event, most of all the recent war against Nazism … for all such protestations, Lewis had clearly been on to something back in 1949,” historian Alan Allport wrote in his 2020 book about the social and military history of the U.K. during World War II, “Britain at Bay.”\nRather than singularly weaving a mythopoeic fantasy world, Allport contended, Tolkien’s future audience “was going to see associations between events in Middle Earth and those in their own world.”\nTolkien, however, was not the first nor the last to draw inspiration from the cataclysmic bloodletting that was the Second World War.\nToday, as fans celebrate May the Fourth (be with you), one does not have to stray far to glean that the galaxy of “Star Wars” is rife with WWII-based allegories — and its fanbase might equal, if not surpass, Tolkien’s.\n“Star Wars” creator George Lucas famously studied over 25 hours of footage from\nWorld War II dogfights and jittery newsreel imagery while researching for the films — even using the footage as placeholders in the film before special effects were added.\n“So one second you’re with the Wookiee in the spaceship and the next you’re in ‘The Bridges at Toko-Ri.’ It was like, ‘George, what is going on?’” Willard Huyck, a screenwriter and personal friend of Lucas,\nstated in a 1997 interview.\nThough the b-roll was eventually edited out, the aerial tactics established in World War II remain visible.\nOne such shot, according to National WWII Museum and Memorial curator\nCorey Graff, “showed aircraft peeling out of formation and dropping from sight. The clip was used as a model for the memorable shot of Rebel craft diving to attack the Death Star. One at a time, the fictional spaceships elegantly ‘aileron roll’ across the screen, mimicking the movements of the 1940s aircraft almost exactly.”\nEntire books have been devoted to such analogies, but we’ve summed up a few of our favorites for some May the Fourth enjoyment.\nThe Millennium Falcon’s cockpit came from the Boeing B-29 Fortress\nAfter studying hours of WWII footage, Lucas became particularly enamored with the cockpit of B-29s — the famous bomber known for dropping the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.\nThe result? The cockpit of Han Solo’s beloved Millennium Falcon looks like it was lifted straight out of Boeing’s blueprints, replete with the B-29′s signature greenhouse-style cockpit. And, exactly like on the Superfortress, the Falcon sports defensive gun turrets — which come in handy when battling a Death Star.\nThe Empire’s similarities to Nazi Germany\nFrom stormtroopers to Imperial officers’ uniforms and even Darth Vader’s helmet, which resembles those worn by the Wehrmacht during WWII, the analogies between Nazi Germany and the Galactic Empire are not exactly subtle.\nThe gradual rise of Hitler from German chancellor to Nazi dictator is further mirrored in the rise of Darth Sidious, or Sheev Palpatine, from chancellor to world’s most in-need-of-facial-moisturizer emperor.\nDepictions of Star Wars spaceships were influenced by WWII fighters\nOnce again Lucas turned to World War II aviation for inspiration to give his spaceships unique sounds. According to Ian D’Costa for\nTacairnet, sounds couldn’t easily be synthesized in the same way studios can create movie sound effects today. To get around that, Lucas sent out sound designer Ben Burtt to Reno Air Races in Nevada, where he was allowed to record the noise of P-51 Mustangs racing overhead.\nBurtt later recalled, “I just said, ‘I want to record some planes,’ and they said ‘Yeah? Then go on out there.’ You could never do that nowadays. I was out at the pylons, and planes were passing 15 feet above my head. They were so fast that I could hardly see them go by; they were just a blur, though I could smell the oil and exhaust. ... Almost all of the spaceships came out of those Mojave recordings, including the Falcon.”\nThe Death Star trench run was inspired by the British Dambuster Raid\nLucas further drew inspiration from the 1955 film “The Dam Busters,” which chronicles the audacious British raid on Germany’s strategic river dams in 1943. The dams were heavily defended by anti-aircraft fire, a recurring theme in “Star Wars.”\n“The Death Star attack is all about combat in the face of desperate odds,” Graff wrote in\nSmithsonian Magazine in 2020. “It’s a clear homage to the epic air battles seen in movies from the 1950s and 1960s.”\nThe Rebels suffer catastrophic losses, and the Death Star raid, just like in 1943, teeters on the brink of failure, “until a pivotal moment when [the] Millennium Falcon comes diving out of the ‘sun,’ a trick as old as military aviation itself,” Graff concluded.\nClaire Barrett is the Strategic Operations Editor for Sightline Media and a World War II researcher with an unparalleled affinity for Sir Winston Churchill and Michigan football.",

    "text": "U.S.-based AI solutions provider BigBear.ai (BBAI) recently posted its Q2 results, falling short of market expectations. While the setback has sparked investor concerns about the company’s prospects, analysts are looking past the short-term turbulence and focusing on the broader growth potential. As a result, the recent dip could present a buying opportunity for long-term investors, with BBAI stock down more than 17% since the earnings release.\nElevate Your Investing Strategy:\n- Take advantage of\nTipRanks Premium at 50% off!Unlock powerful investing tools, advanced data, and expert analyst insights to help you invest with confidence.\nFor context, BigBear.ai delivers AI-powered decision support solutions, mainly serving the U.S. defense, intelligence, and federal government sectors.\nBigBear.ai Misses Expectations in Q2\nIn Q2, the company’s revenue fell by 18% year-over-year to $32.5 million, missing analyst projections of $40.59 million. It was primarily due to reduced activity on select U.S. Army programs.\nOn the earnings side, BigBear.ai reported an adjusted loss of $0.71 per share, marking a steep miss compared to the consensus forecast for a $0.06 loss.\nWall Street Stays Bullish\nDespite the disappointing results, Wall Street analysts expressed support for BBAI stock, choosing to look past short-term challenges.\nAnalyst Scott Buck at H.C. Wainwright reiterated his Buy rating but trimmed his price target from $9 to $8. Buck argued that Q2 results weren’t surprising given similar delays affecting other defense companies. He expects revenue visibility to improve as the business approaches 2026 and sees BigBear.ai benefiting long-term from the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which boosts investment in its core areas. He also highlighted that the company ended Q2 2025 with over $390 million in cash, providing flexibility for reinvestment and acquisitions.\nSimilarly, five-star-rated analyst Jonathan Ruykhaver of Cantor Fitzgerald maintained a Buy rating and raised his price target to $6 from $5 per share. Ruykhaver pointed to meaningful progress in key areas, including enhancements to core products and improved balance sheet strength. Notably, the company’s backlog rose 42.9% year-over-year to $380 million, suggesting healthy demand and improved revenue visibility. Overall, he views the expanding backlog and ongoing strategic initiatives as key factors supporting his Buy rating and a higher price target.\nIs BBAI a Good Stock to Buy?\nOn TipRanks, analysts have a Moderate Buy consensus rating on BBAI stock, based on two Buys and one Hold assigned in the last three months. The average BigBear.ai share price target is $6.67, which implies an upside of nearly 15% from current levels.",
