It’s hot down here, so when it gets cold, people just love to be out here in the cold.” Both businesses are anticipating an even busier holiday weekend. “We are really hoping because it’s supposed to be chillier, so I’m really hoping that’ll bring more people outside,” Jackson said.

    "title": "Controversial Claim by Shaman Durek Verrett Sparks Outrage: ‘Suicidal Spirit’ Exorcism Technique Causes Uproar",
    "text": "SHAMAN: Durek Verrett.\nPhoto: Frode Hansen / VG\nPetter Eide in the organization Leve reacts to Durek Verrett’s claim that there is a suicidal spirit that can be exorcised.\nPublished:\nLess than 40 minutes ago\nUpdated just now\nIn a new\nvideo on Instagram, Verrett says he will share shamanic knowledge and techniques on how to deal with suicide.\n– Yes, we are talking about something heavy here, but it is important for us to be able to protect ourselves. In shamanism, we believe that there is a suicidal spirit, says Verrett, who is engaged to Princess Märtha Louise.\nVerrett claims that one can get rid of the “suicidal spirit” themselves. He tells about a technique that will help you get this spirit out of you.\nThis technique involves, among other things, breathing and saying a few selected words to remove the “suicide spirit”.\n– Almost at a loss for words\nPetter Eide, chairman of Leve – the National Association for survivors of suicide – believes this is a life-threatening message.\n– Here he makes a claim that suicide is caused by a spirit taking up residence in your body and that you should be able to drive it out with the help of your own thinking power. I hardly have words for how upset I get when I hear such nonsense. He plays with people’s lives, says Eide to VG.\nOver 600 people take their own lives every year, according to the Norwegian Institute of Public\nHealth (FHI).\nFHI does not have figures on attempts, but Eide believes that perhaps ten times as many attempt it or have suicidal thoughts every year.\nLEVE: Petter Eide is chairman of the National Association for Survivors of Suicide.\nPhoto: Helge Mikalsen / VG\nEide points out that research on suicide shows that you should seek professional help and fellowship, not sit alone with your thoughts.\n– Verrett pushes this exclusively back on the individual, without explanation or connection – just that an evil spirit has taken up residence in you that you can drive out yourself. What he says can make it worse.\n– It is difficult to imagine him in the royal family with this type of attitude, says Eide, and points out that Durek Verrett is marrying Princess Märtha Louise in Geiranger this summer.\n– Shamanism a supplement to the healthcare system\nDurek Verrett has been submitted to the criticism, via his spokesperson in Norway, Simon Valvik.\nValvik says Verret’s content is intended for his followers and supporters who are familiar with his methods and practices of shamanism.\nThe majority of followers are Americans, not Norwegians, according to Valvik.\n– In the\nUSA, there is closer contact between alternative medicine and school medicine. I see shamanism as a useful addition to the healthcare system, as many people in America also do, says Durek Verrett.\nThose who do not agree with him do not have to follow him either, says Verrett.\nAt the same time, he says that he recognizes the importance of the\nhealth system and school medicine.\n– I respect what professionals, such as doctors and psychologists do, and I don’t try to tell them how to do their job. It’s about respecting each other and understanding that we all have different ways of helping people, says Verret.\nHe says that he wants to be able to offer an alternative to those who want it.\nThe press guard at the Castle tells VG that on a general basis they do not comment on statements from Durek Verrett.\nNeed someone to talk to?\nBy for urgent crisis assistance, you must call 113. If you want to get in touch with your local emergency room, call 116 117.\nThere are several helplines, chat services and support groups where you can share your thoughts and feelings completely anonymously, and get support, advice and guidance.\nHere you will find more\n helplines and chat services which can be helpful when you are having a hard time.\nFor children and young people:\nSource: Helsenorge.no\nPublished:\nPublished: 29.12.23 at 15:59\nUpdated: 29.12.23 at 16:36\n2023-12-29 14:59:51\n#Knallhardt #Durek #Verretts #discussion #suicide",

    "text": "SMoCA pays homage to the vivid color fields of Arizona artist Dorothy Fratt An exhibit at the Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art pays tribute to a Phoenix artist you may not have heard of before. “Dorothy Fratt: Color Mirage” is the first large-scale solo exhibition of Fratt’s work in a U.S. museum. Dorothy Fratt lived in the Phoenix area for more than 70 years. To get here, she drove cross-country with four kids in 1958; she died in 2017. The Show recently visited SMoCA to talk to Jennifer McCabe about Dorothy Fratt and her work. McCabe is the museum’s director and chief curator. How would she describe Fratt’s painting style? “It did evolve over time,” McCabe said, “but her works that she is most known for are large-scale color field, what we would call color field. And so that just means they’re big patches of usually bright colors, often with shapes. She had a lot of different philosophies about painting, and so she explored those through her paintings.” What were some of those philosophies? “One was dialogue. So different colors and shapes in conversation within the paintings. Another was about the periphery, so she explored formes around the outsides of the painting. She painted a lot of landscapes, so ... knowing the titles of her works is really helpful because it will give you a clue as to what you might be looking at,” McCabe said. “And what's so interesting about (Fratt) is that when she was painting this color field or abstract style, people really wanted to see cowboys, horses, sunsets,” she added. “They wanted that Western feel. And she did it, but in her own unique way. So that's what makes her work really special to me.” We turn a corner and see more bright, vibrant colors — but instead of on canvas, these are prints. “Yes, she did a lot of prints,” McCabe explained. “She worked with another local artist, John Armstrong, who is a master printmaker. And he told me this wonderful story about printing with Dorothy, and they ran out of an orange color in the middle of the run. And she said, ‘No worries. I’ll be right back.’ And she left the room, came back with an exact match. She had left and mixed the same orange color. So she had a visual memory of color that really stood out to this master printmaker.” The exhibit is arranged chronologically, which allows visitors to follow along as Fratt’s style evolved over time. The Show asked McCabe what stands out to her about Fratt’s later work, relative to what we saw from earlier in her career. “As we move into the ’80s and ’90s, the scale of the paintings increases. So they’re a much larger scale. Really vibrant colors, as we were talking about — so we’ve got some royal blues and bright reds. Additionally, she really explores the edges of the paintings with her forms but also, in one particular painting, her signature. She signs the painting on all four edges so that you can rotate it when you display it,” McCabe said. “Dorothy Fratt: Color Mirage” will be on display at SMoCA through July 21.",

Die Ursache des Brandes ist noch unklar – ebenso, ob das Festival nun stattfinden kann.\nUpdate vom 17. Juli, 6.40 Uhr: Bereits im Vorfeld des vergangenen „Tomorrowland“-Festivals hatte das Team betont, dass das Design der ikonischen Hauptbühne vollständig in Eigenregie entstanden sei – von den ersten Ideen bis hin zur finalen Umsetzung. Über zwei Jahre hinweg habe das hauseigene Kreativteam mit viel Hingabe an der spektakulären Kulisse gearbeitet. „Jahrelange Liebe und Leidenschaft sind in den Aufbau dieser Bühne geflossen. Die Teams sind am Boden zerstört“, sagte Festivalsprecherin Debby Wilmsen am Mittwochabend (16. Juli) auf einer Pressekonferenz.\nBrand zerstört Hauptbühne von „Tomorrowland“-Festival: DJs zeigen sich bestürzt\n„Ich habe das gerade überall in den News gesehen. Es bricht mir das Herz“, so Charlotte de Witte, die am Samstag beim „Tomorrowland“ spielen sollte, bei Instagram. Auch die DJs Armin van Buuren und Boris Brejcha zeigten sich betroffen, während Afrojack vor allem erleichtert ist, dass es keine Verletzten gab. Das Duo Blasterjaxx lobte die Crew für ihren Einsatz: „Respekt an die Crew, dass sie es dennoch stattfinden lassen wollen.“ Anouk Matton, die auf der Hauptbühne auftreten sollte, sagte noch vor ihrem Set im Ushuaïa auf Ibiza: „Ich bin völlig geschockt … Ich hoffe sehr, dass das Festival trotzdem stattfinden kann.“\nSelbst das konkurrierende Festival „Parookaville“ meldete sich zu Wort und kommentierte unter einem Beitrag von „Tomorrowland“: „Wir schicken all unsere Liebe.“\nUpdate vom 16, Juli, 22.37 Uhr: Auch eine Sprecherin der Feuerwehr bestätigte, dass es bislang keine Verletzten durch den Brand auf dem Gelände des „Tomorrowland“-Festivals gebe. Rettungsdienste sind vor Ort, so die belgische Nachrichtenagentur Belga.

Diese sei „schwer beschädigt“ worden. Immerhin könne man bestätigen, dass niemand verletzt sei.\nDennoch werde der Campingplatz „Dreamville“ am Donnerstag, 17. Juli, wie geplant für Besucher öffnen. Zudem würden alle sogenannten Global Journey-Aktivitäten rund um das Festival in Brüssel und Antwerpen „wie geplant“ stattfinden.\nDoch was heißt das für das Festival an sich? „Wir arbeiten mit Hochdruck an der Lösung des Festivalwochenendes (Freitag – Samstag – Sonntag)“, heißt es vom Veranstalter. Neue Informationen will man „so bald wie möglich bekannt geben.“\nErstmeldung vom 17. Juli: Es sollte das Musik-Highlight des Sommers werden, doch jetzt steht alles in Flammen! Die gigantische Hauptbühne des weltberühmten Tomorrowland-Festivals in Belgien ist am Mittwochabend komplett abgebrannt.

Menschen in der Umgebung wird geraten, Fenster und Türen geschlossen zu halten.\n„Tomorrowland“-Gelände wegen Brand evakuiert – Unklar, ob Festival stattfinden kann\nZum Zeitpunkt des Unglücks befanden sich keine Festivalbesucher auf dem Gelände, aber rund 1.000 Mitarbeiter, die mit den Vorbereitungen beschäftigt waren. Wie der flämische Sender VRT berichtet, wurde das gesamte Gelände evakuiert. Ob es Verletzte gibt, ist derzeit noch unklar.\nDas Tomorrowland-Festival sollte am Freitag beginnen und bis Sonntag dauern. Jährlich strömen rund 400.000 Techno- und Elektro-Fans aus aller Welt zu dem Event. Für dieses Jahr waren Star-DJs wie ArminVan Buuren, Charlotte De Witte und Swedish House Mafia, David Guetta und Robin Schulz angekündigt. Ob das Festival wie geplant stattfinden kann, ist nach dem verheerenden Brand völlig unklar. (sp/cln)",
