    "text": "If you use Apple devices, you must be familiar with the HEIC image format; the default image format for these devices.\nThe best thing about the High-efficiency Image format (HEIC) is that images, image sequences, and animation.\nHowever, despite the almost unmatched quality, HEIC images have limitations that may force you to convert them to other formats.\nConverting HEIC to PDF helps with shareability; here are methods of converting HEIC to PDF effortlessly.\nConverting HEIC to PDF Online\nOnline conversion tools are the quickest and easiest way to change a HEIC file to a PDF. You only need to identify a reliable tool that you can navigate with ease.\nWhile you may encounter slight differences with many online tools, the process will be almost identical.\nThe following are the steps to convert HEIC to PDF online.\n- Identify your preferred converter and\nvisit URL.\n- Click “Add Files” or a similar alternative, depending on your chosen tool. Some will provide a “Select Link” option to change from an image URL.\n- Select “PDF” as your output method.\n- Click “Convert” or “Convert Now” or any other similar option to start the conversion.\n- Select a saving location for your PDF and click “Save.”\nOne of the main downsides of online converters is that you must have an internet connection. In addition, many of them do not allow more than 100 MB file size.\nConverting HEIC to PDF on Mac\nHEIC format is Mac-friendly since it is especially for Apple devices. Thus, converting them to PDF or merging HEIC and PDF is straightforward.\nFollow the following steps to change HEIC to PDF on Mac.\n- Use Preview to open the HEIC image on Mac.\n- Click “File” followed by “Export Selected Images.”\n- Select an output format for your conversion; click “PDF.” Suppose you selected several images to convert to PDF; select “Choose to Convert all HEIC Images in Separate PDF format.”\n- Once the conversion is complete, Preview will display the newly converted PDF as a Thumbnail; check the sidebar.\n- Return to “Files” and click “Save” to store the file on your Mac.\nConverting HEIC to PDF on Windows\nYou need two programs to change HEIC to PDF on Windows: Adobe Reader and Adobe Photoshop CC.\n- Launch Adobe Photoshop on your computer, then click “Files.”\n- Choose “Save As.”\n- Pick “Save as JPEG,” then click “Run” to commence the conversion.\n- Once the HEIC image is in JPEG format, launch Adobe Reader and click “File” followed by “Open.” Identify the image you want to change to PDF.\n- Click “Enhance Scans” in the right-side panel and choose the image you wish to convert.\n- Click “Select a File” then “Start.”\n- Choose a suitable location to save your newly converted PDF file, then click “Save.”\nConverting JEIC to PDF on iPhone\nYou can convert a HEIC image to PDF on your iPhone using XODO through the browser. Here are simple steps to do this.\n- Tap the Safari browser on your iPhone, then go to Xodo. Go to its free HEIC to PDF converter.\n- Upload the HEIC pictures you wish to change to PDF.\n- Click “Convert” to begin processing the files.\n- Download the newly converted PDF files to your iPhone.\nWhile the conversion is easy and seamless, paying to use the converter is one of the main downsides.\nConverting HEIC images to PDF files is seamless, but only if you understand the process. It would also help to use appropriate tools compatible with your browser. Before converting your images, it would be best to know\nhow to open HEIC images on Windows and Mac.\nInteresting Related Article: “\nTips To Convert Files into PDF Format“",

    "text": "AIADMK blames Annamalai for the party&#039;s exit from BJP-led NDA alliance After the DMK-led INDIA alliance secured a clear majority in the Lok Sabha polls in Tamil Nadu, the principal opposition party, AIADMK, blamed the BJP&#039;s state chief, K Annamalai, on Thursday for the party&#039;s decision to part ways with the NDA. In a press briefing, AIADMK leader SP Velumani said that if it weren&#039;t for him, the party, in alliance with the NDA, would have won 35 seats.Â Highlighting AIADMK&#039;s performance in the polls, Velumani said that the party was successful in increasing its vote share from 19.39 per cent in 2019 to 20.3 per cent in 2024.Â He claimed that the party severed ties with the NDA due to Annamalai&#039;s alleged insults to the legacies of Anna and Jayalalithaa. Slamming Annamalai, he stated, &quot;Earlier, we were in alliance with the BJP under the leadership of Tamilisai Soundararajan and later, L Murugan. However, after Annamalai assumed power, he continued to criticize our leaders, including Amma, Anna, and our leader, Edapadi K. Palanisamy, despite our alliance. Annamalai&#039;s actions led to our decision to exit the alliance. If the alliance had continued, we would have secured 35 seats.&quot;Â Annamalai was defeated by DMK&#039;s Ganapathy Rajkumar by a massive margin of more than 1 lakh votes.Â In contrast to the last election, where the AIADMK was able to secure one constituency, the party faced defeat in all 39 Lok Sabha seats this time. Once a dominant force, the Dravidian party has now been pushed to third position in 12 key constituencies, with the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) coming in second place behind the DMK. The BJP secured the second position in nine of these seats.",

    "title": "'The matches will be sillier': Overwatch 2's competitive changes for season 10 will finally let you play with that one friend who's been stuck in bronze since 2016",
    "text": "‘The matches will be sillier’: Overwatch 2’s competitive changes for season 10 will finally let you play with that one friend who’s been stuck in bronze since 2016\nThe latest developer update for Overwatch 2 saw Gavin Winter, senior systems designer, explain some of the biggest changes coming in season 10, and one of them will hopefully help you help that one friend who can’t seem to get out of bronze.\nThere’s been a lot of talk concerning Overwatch 2 season 10, and what this means for the game going forward, with a new DPS hero, Venture, being added and plans to “give the game a regular heartbeat.” However, I’m more interested in the competitive changes scheduled for the next season and what this means for groups and matchmaking.\nIn a developer update posted to Twitter, Winter explains that “Overwatch is at its best when you’re playing with friends,” and it’s for this reason that Blizzard has decided to revise its grouping restrictions. You used to only be able to team up with friends if everyone was within two ranks of each other (or one if someone is Masters or above). This was supposed to help ensure fair matches and remove the possibility of boosting, but I think we’ve all seen a gold Mercy main attached to a Diamond DPS hero of some kind during a competitive match, so I’m not sure how effective this was.\nBut this also meant that if there was one particularly good or bad player in your group, everyone was forced to a life of Quick Play, forbidden to enter a competitive match together. My group has had some trouble with this in the past with one of my ex-top 500 friends who now floats around Champions and Grand Master and another old mate of mine who’s perpetually stuck in “wood league”—what he fondly calls the bottom of bronze. I haven’t played with him in a while, but it looks like now’s a great time to check in and see what he’s been up to.\nHowever, this change doesn’t come without at least some limitations. If you do play in a group with a wide range of ranks, then you will be labeled as a “wide group” which means that you’ll only go up against other groups like yourself. “We expect all of this to be a huge match-quality win for our solo players because they’ll never play against wide groups,” Winter explains.\nThere’ll also be a new modifier attached to players who compete in particularly wide groups. “Avoiding boosting is really important to us, so the wider your group is, the less your rank will change,” Winters says. So if you’re bronze and are playing with a Masters rank, you’ll see little to no change in your rank after a match. There may also be “fewer smurfs after these changes, too, since we know some players were only creating alt accounts to play competitive with their friends,” Winters concludes. I’m not sure if this will massively help the situation, but anything’s worth trying once.\nAs someone who’ll likely play quite a bit of competitive in these wide groups, it’ll be interesting to see if and how it will affect each match. The matchmaking in season 9 has been alright so far, with Quick Play actually being more sweaty at times. So, as long as it doesn’t mess with the composition too much, I think this change could be great for larger groups and for those who want to play with friends, no matter the skill level.",

    "text": "Veteran defensive lineman Arik Armstead didn’t stay on the open market for long following his release from the San Francisco 49ers.\nAccording to Bleacher Report’s Jordan Schultz and ESPN’s\nAdam Schefter, the Jacksonville Jaguars are signing the 30-year-old Armstead to a massive three-year contract worth $51 million. The reigning NFC Champions cut the longtime fan favorite in a cap-saving move that cleared $18 million against the cap.\nAlso Read:\nBREAKING: Washington Commanders Trade QB Sam Howell To NFC Rival In Surprise Blockbuster Move\nAccording to The Athletic’s Dianna Russini, Armstead also spoke to the\nHouston Texans and Buffalo Bills. Russini added there was a discussion between the 49ers and the Texans for a one-for-one player swap that ended once the AFC South club signed Danielle.\nClick on ‘Follow Us’ and get notified of the most viral NFL stories via Google!\nFollow Us\nSome responding to Russini’s tweet wondered if she was talking about star wide receiver Nico Collins, but she was presumably talking about defensive lineman Maliek Collins. Yesterday, the 49ers acquired Collins via trade in exchange for a seventh-round pick.\nSo after all that, Armstead remains in the AFC South and now joins a Jaguars front seven led by young stars\nJosh Allen and 2022 first overall pick Travon Walker and veteran stalwart Foyesade Oluokon.\nArmstead was drafted 17th overall by the 49ers back in 2015. He had spent each of his first nine years on the west coast, helping San Fran to four NFC Championship Game appearances and two Super Bowl berths.\nFor his career, Armstead has 33.5 sacks, three forced fumbles, six pass defenses and 302 combined tackles.\nAlso Read:\nREPORT: 49ers Looking To Pull Off Blockbuster Trade For Chargers Superstar Player",

    "text": "The chief developer of Mastodon has sharply criticized the change of direction announced by Meta regarding the moderation of content and assured that by far the largest instance of its short messaging service will also enforce its own rules regarding threads. Accounts on Meta's short messaging service can be linked to Mastodon. Mastodon chief developer Eugen Rochko points out that Meta's \"deeply disturbing\" new line may also have consequences for other social networks. If an account on Threads violates the rules of mastodon.social, action will be taken. Users there should switch directly to Mastodon.\nAnzeige\nThe changes announced by Meta are important for Mastodon because posts from Threads can also end up in the timelines of Mastodon accounts thanks to the connection via the ActivityPub protocol. If threads are moderated less strictly, posts that would previously have been blocked could be distributed in this way. However, Meta will still have to intervene in the case of content that is relevant under criminal law. It remains to be seen what concrete consequences the changes at Meta will have. However, Rochko is not alone in his criticism . With regard to the moderation of content, Rochko can only speak for instances that Mastodon itself operates , but many accounts are located on other sites with different rules.\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced on Tuesday that controversial and political topics on Facebook, Instagram and Threads will be less restricted. However, accounts on Threads can be opened outside the EU for the so-called Fediverse, so accounts on Mastodon and other platforms can follow them. A connection to Bluesky is also possible. While this opening ensures that users will have more freedom in choosing a social network in future without having to forego potential contacts, this week's developments show the pitfalls that lurk. The opening of threads was therefore also viewed critically on Mastodon beforehand.\nRead also The Fediverse is growing: After Threads, Bluesky can also be linked to Mastodon",
