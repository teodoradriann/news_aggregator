    "title": "Turkey hits PKK targets in Syria, Iraq following attack on state aviation site",
    "text": "Turkey's Defense Ministry on Oct. 24 announced that it struck 29 PKK targets in Syria and Iraq, killing 59 militants. The move came in response to the previous day's gun attack at the Turkish Aerospace Industries (TUSAŞ) headquarters that killed five and injured 22. Thursday October 24 2024 11:00 pm A view shows smoke rising after explosions among buildings in Tal Rifaat, Aleppo Governorate, Syria in this screen grab from a CCTV footage obtained from a Oct. 24 social media video. Reuters\nTurkey's Defence Ministry on Oct. 24 said that it launched fresh air strikes on Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militants in northern Syria and Iraq overnight, killing 59 militants, in response to a gun attack that killed five people in the capital province of Ankara.\nTwo assailants - a man and a woman - carried out the Oct. 23 assault with automatic rifles and explosives on the headquarters of Turkish Aerospace Industries (TUSAŞ) in Ankara. Twenty-two people were also wounded.\nThere has been no claim of responsibility for the attack, during which both militants were killed. Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said the male attacker was confirmed to be a PKK member, while the female assailant had not yet been identified.\nTurkish forces struck 29 PKK targets in northern Iraq and 18 in northern Syria, Defence Minister Yaşar Güler said. Later, his ministry said 59 militants, including two believed to be \"high level\", were \"neutralised\", a term usually used to mean killed.\nThe U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said on Oct. 24 that the Turkish strikes in northern and eastern Syria had killed 12 civilians, including two children, and wounded 25 people.\nSpearheaded by the Kurdish YPG and including Arab fighters, the SDF has been a major partner for the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State. It holds a quarter of Syria including oil fields and areas where some 900 U.S. troops are deployed.\nTurkey says the YPG is a terrorist organization that is closely tied to the PKK. Turkey's defense ministry said every precaution had been taken to prevent harm to innocent civilians.\n\"No member of the treacherous terrorist organization will be able to escape the grasp of Turkish soldiers,\" Güler said in a memorial ceremony at a defense industry fair in Istanbul.\n\"It is not a coincidence that this site was targeted,\" he added, referring to TUSAŞ.\nTurkey regularly targets the PKK in Iraq and Syria with fighter jets and drones and TUSAŞ is Turkey's largest aerospace manufacturer, producing drones, helicopters, training craft and developing the country's first indigenous fighter jet, KAAN.\nSecurity was tightened at TUSAŞ headquarters on Oct. 24, with security forces searching vehicles and checking people's identities, the state-owned Anadolu news agency (AA) reported.\nThe alert level was raised to \"orange\" at Turkish airports as part of increased security measures, an aviation sector source told Reuters.\nEyes on PKK leader\nPresident Tayyip Erdoğan, speaking alongside Russia's Vladimir Putin at a BRICS conference in the Russian city of Kazan, condemned the attack, as did NATO, the United States, and the European Union, which all designate the PKK as a terrorist organization.\n\"This cowardly attack has further strengthened Turkey's determination to eliminate terrorism,\" Erdogan said at the Oct. 24 summit.\nWednesday's attack came a day after a key ally of Erdoğan said the PKK's jailed leader Abdullah Öcalan may be allowed to speak in Turkey's parliament, if he announces an end to the group's insurgency, in exchange for the possibility of being released.\nNationalist Movement Party (MHP) leader Devlet Bahçeli made the surprise suggestion following media speculation in recent weeks about fresh efforts to end the PKK insurgency, in which more than 40,000 people have been killed.\nThe PKK took up arms 40 years ago with the initial aim of creating an independent Kurdish state. It subsequently moderated its goals to seek greater Kurdish rights and limited autonomy in mainly Kurdish southeast Turkey.\nIt was not immediately clear whether Wednesday's attack would affect Bahçeli's offer or whether it was intended to derail any such move.\nÖcalan's nephew said he visited the PKK leader on Oct. 23 in the island prison south of Istanbul where he has been held since his capture in 1999. It was the first such visit in around four years.\n\"If the conditions are right, I have the theoretical and practical power to move this process from a foundation of conflict and violence to legal and political ground,\" Ömer Öcalan quoted his uncle on X as saying.\nAttackers kill 5, injure 22 at Turkish aviation site Domestic State aviation site attacked in Turkey's Ankara, leaves some dead, injured Domestic Jailed Öcalan allowed to meet family after 43 months, says he has ‘power to move process from violence to politics’ Politics Topics PKK TUSAŞ terrorist attack Syria Iraq Most Populars Man discovers massive Roman mosaic floor while gardening Turkish man dies by suicide after murdering two women on same day Turkey lifts visa requirement for six countries Record number of resident foreigners leave Turkey in 2023",

    "title": "Kanpur: Danish lured minor Hindu girl using photos of luxury cars and houses, kept hostage, raped, fed beef, gave Muslim name and forced her to do Namaz",
    "text": "A shocking case of love jihad has come to light in Uttar Pradesh’s Kanpur where a 20-year-old young man named Danish was arrested after he trapped a 14-year-old girl in a relationship by promising her the world on social media under the pretext of a Hindu name. Afterwards, he kidnapped and kept her hostage when she fell into his web, and raped her multiple times.\nFurthermore, Danish forced the minor Hindu girl to consume beef and perform namaz. Furthermore, she was beaten if she refused to follow the orders. She was also taken to a Mosque and her name was changed to Muskaan Khan. The accused used to send pictures of bungalows and cars to the minor on Instagram and presented himself as extremely wealthy. However, he lived with his family in a one-room slum built on a drain. He kept the victim hostage there and would sexually assault her as his family slept as well as threatened her if she made any noise.\nThe matter pertained to the Chakeri police station area of Kanpur where Danish, son of Gulfam, called a 14-year-old girl to meet him on 22nd October 2023 and abducted her as well as took her captive in Maikupurwa after she arrived at the location. He raped her for two months while she made several unsuccessful attempts at escaping during this period. On 30th December the perpetrator planned to convert her to Islam and marry her against her wishes. Meanwhile, Hindu organisations such as Vishva Hindu Parishad and Bajrang Dal learned about the incident and rescued her with the help of locals.\nThe father disclosed that on that fateful day, he was enjoying himself with his family after returning from the office when his daughter received a call after which she left, leading the family to believe that she had gone to the bathroom. However, when didn’t return for a long time, they looked for her but were unable to locate her and were unaware of her ordeal for the entire time. He reached the police station to lodge a complaint and demanded justice for his child.\nThe girl’s father, who works in a factory, said that Danish was contacting the girl for three months on social media. He then lured her to go with her and then kept her captive.\nA Hindu activist informed, “During Ramnavami or Navratri, an underage girl came in contact with a boy named Danish on Instagram. He used to communicate with her under a Hindu pseudonym. She was pleased by the numerous photos he shared of himself in opulent homes and cars. She went to meet him at his place where the offender and his mother Maksooda invited her to stay with them for a few days before taking her as their prisoner. He started using her phone after they damaged her SIM card. She tried to contact her family numerous times but Maksooda used to lock the youngster inside the house whenever she went outside.”\nHe added, “She wanted to flee but failed. Meanwhile, they brought her to a Mosque and served her cow and buffalo meat, per the statement of the girl. She was even given the new name Muskaan Khan. We were tipped off about the instance and showed up at the scene along with her family as well as other people of the region and found her but Danish had already absconded from there.” He unveiled that the culprit sexually violated her in the same room he shared with his parents and sister and added, “The minor’s mother has submitted an application and we have asked for a proper legal investigation based on the former’s testimony.”\n“Durga Vahini worker living near Maikupurwa informed about the situation after which Vishva Hindu Parishad and Bajrang Dal members went to the spot. The terrified girl initially spoke in support of the culprit before breaking down in tears and narrating the horrifying events,” mentioned Anand Singh who is the District Vice President of Vishva Hindu Parishad while talking to the media.\nHe charged, “The accused and his family gave her meat to eat and claimed that with this she would become Muslim from Hindu and be married. They made her pray every day and assaulted her if she objected. One day he brought a cleric along with his journalist friend and discussed about marriage on 30th December.” However, she was saved by his team of Hindu activists and others.\nAccording to the Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police (ADCP)-East of the Kanpur Commissionerate, Danish has been apprehended and a case has been registered against him under relevant sections while further inquiry is underway.\nथाना चकेरी में एक व्यक्ति द्वारा सूचना दी गई कि उसकी पुत्री जो 22 Oct को चली गई थी वो 29.12.23 को वापस आ गई है उसने बताया कि वह किसी लड़के के साथ चली गयी थी,पिता की तहरीर पर अभियोग पंजीकृत करते हुए 01 व्यक्ति को हिरासत में लेकर कार्यवाही की जा रही है।\nByte-ADCP East @uppolice pic.twitter.com/RNo0sNRKs5\n— POLICE COMMISSIONERATE KANPUR NAGAR (@kanpurnagarpol) December 29, 2023 In her complaint, the victim stated to Hindu outfits that Danish had shared images of automobiles and houses on Instagram. He liked to capture and send out images while standing around the bungalow. However, he brought her to a shack where he resided with his family. with only a curtain hanging over it.",

    "text": "By Ahmed Aboulenein, Sriparna Roy\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services will cut about 10,000 full-time jobs and close half of its regional offices, it said on Thursday, a major overhaul of the department under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\nThe latest job cuts, and about 10,000 recent voluntary departures, will reduce the number of full-time employees at the department to 62,000 from 82,000, the department said.\n\"We aren't just reducing bureaucratic sprawl. We are realigning the organization with its core mission and our new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic,\" Kennedy said in a department statement.\nPresident Donald Trump and billionaire ally Elon Musk, who oversees the DOGE cost-cutting initiative, have been gutting agencies as part of an effort to shrink the federal bureaucracy.\nThe HHS plan involves cutting 3,500 full-time employees at the Food and Drug Administration, the department said in a fact sheet breaking down the cuts, adding that the cuts would not affect inspectors or drug, medical device, or food reviewers.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will see 2,400 staff cut and the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, currently an independent HHS agency with 1,000 employees, folded into it.\nThe National Institutes for Health will see a reduction of 1,200 employees across its 27 institutes and centers, the breakdown showed. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services was comparatively spared with a reduction of about 300 people.\nAs part of the restructuring, 28 units of the department will be consolidated into 15 new divisions, including a new 'Administration for a Healthy America', or AHA.\nAHA will combine offices in HHS that address addiction, toxic substances and occupational safety, among others, into one central office, the agency said.\nThe new units will also centralize functions such as external affairs, human resources and IT.\n(Reporting by Ahmed Aboulenein in Washington and Sriparna Roy in Bengaluru; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli and Franklin Paul)",

    "text": "AQI shows improvement in city, better than last year The air quality index (AQI) in the industrial city, as compared to last year, has shown a considerable improvement. Still, people are experiencing ‘moderate’ to ‘poor’ air quality conditions. The data taken for the first seven days of November 2024 shows there has been much improvement in the quality of air as compared to 2023, which remained “poor” for all seven days, starting from November 1-7. While this year in November, the conditions remained ‘poor’ and ‘moderate’ except for ‘very poor’ on November 2, after the bursting of crackers on Diwali on November 1. On other days, the air quality index recorded included 204 on November 1, 339 on November 2, 108 on November 3, 184 on November 4, 155 on November 5, 210 on November 6 and 173 on Thursday. While last year, the AQI was 245 on November 1, 219 on November 2, 228 on November 3, 289 on November 4, 243 on November 5, 282 on November 6 and 239 on November 7. Throughout the first week of November 2023, the AQI was ‘poor’. There is slight improvement in the air quality as compared to last year may be due to strict action against farm fires or awareness drives. In 2023, it rained in October which cleared the skies, this time there are no rains so far since October, still improved conditions are witnessed as far as the AQI is concerned.",
