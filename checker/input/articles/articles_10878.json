    "text": "VANCOUVER — British Columbia's abnormally warm winter has left local ski resorts grappling with a lack of snow during the holiday tourism season, as resorts struggle to keep runs open.\nFewer than half of Whistler Blackcomb's trails are open, while Vancouver's Mount Seymour is closed entirely while it waits for better conditions.\nWarmth related to the El Niño climate phenomenon this week has pushed temperatures to record highs in regions including Metro Vancouver, Greater Victoria, the Sunshine Coast and the Okanagan.\nIn Whistler, 120 kilometres north of Vancouver, Environment Canada was reporting no snow on the ground on Christmas Day, compared to 40 centimetres last Christmas.\nOn Thursday, the Whistler Blackcomb resort reported 117 of its 275 trails were open, as well as only 42 per cent of its terrain.\nWarm weather has hit Metro Vancouver's three main ski hills even harder, with Cypress and Grouse mountains operating only one or two runs each.\nMount Seymour closed entirely on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, pending more snow.\nJames Shalman, general manager at Apex Mountain Resort in the Okanagans, says resorts across the province are \"definitely behind the 8-ball\" because of the warm weather, with visitors lost during the holidays unlikely to return later in the season.\n\"All resorts in B.C. are very reliant on the Christmas holidays as a significant portion of their financial picture for the season,\" Shalman said.\n\"This is not something where you can make up what you're down during Christmas break. You won't make that up later in the season, even if we get amazing snowfall in January, February, March.\"\nApex on Thursday had about a third of its roughly 79 runs open, a stark contrast from 2022 when every run was open in the first week of December thanks to heavy snowfalls.\nShalman said Apex had significant snow-making capacity and used it to combat the lack of precipitation, but there were weeks this month where the temperatures were too warm to make snow.\n\"I mean, we are essentially snow farmers,\" he says. \"We're Mother Nature-dependent, and we just have to take what we get.\"\nAt Cypress Mountain in West Vancouver, management warned skiers of \"thin snow coverage\" for what little of the hill was open.\nSeveral resorts have been offering discounted passes and tickets to entice skiers to visit.\n\"Rain's the star of the show today,\" Cypress Mountain's update on Thursday said, noting that night skiing had been cancelled.\nEnvironment Canada meteorologist Brian Proctor said that in addition to El Niño, a ridge of high pressure had created a \"blocking pattern\" across much of North America. That was preventing the warm air generated by El Niño from passing over mountains and continuing inland.\nProctor said it meant the warm air mass had lingered over B.C., unable to go east due to high pressure acting like \"a wall.\"\nHe said Environment Canada's long-term forecast called for more seasonal temperatures to return for the first week of January, bringing potential snowfall to higher elevations in the Interior.\nBut Proctor said snowfall was less certain for coastal areas in coming weeks, adding that skiers and resorts should temper expectations.\n\"We may see potential for some snowfall,\" Proctor says. \"But really longer term it does look like an El Niño winter at this point in time, continuing and remaining fairly significant into the early spring.\"\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 29, 2023.\nChuck Chiang, The Canadian Press",

    "title": "Circle's Revenue Alert: How Fed Rate Cuts Threaten USDC's Stability",
    "text": "The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with a crucial question: how will impending U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate cuts affect major players like Circle? This isn’t just a theoretical debate; it directly impacts Circle’s revenue , especially as the issuer of USDC, one of the leading stablecoins. Recent insights from Omar, a Director at Dragonfly, shed light on a potentially significant challenge facing the stablecoin giant. This analysis offers a clear look at what the future might hold for the prominent stablecoin issuer .\nWhat Does This Mean for Circle’s Revenue ? Omar’s analysis, shared on X, highlights a stark reality for rate-sensitive companies like Circle. A 100-basis-point cut in U.S. interest rates could have a substantial ripple effect on the company’s financials. Why does this matter so much? Stablecoin issuers like Circle earn a significant portion of their income from holding reserves, often in short-term U.S. Treasury bills, which yield interest.\nHere’s a breakdown of the potential financial hit:\nGross Revenue Reduction: A 100-basis-point cut could reduce Circle’s run-rate gross revenue by an estimated $618 million, representing a 23% drop. Gross Profit Decline: The impact extends to profitability, with gross profit potentially falling by $303 million, a 30% decrease. Margin Compression: Operating margins could also see a squeeze, decreasing by 3.3 percentage points. This detailed breakdown provides a clear picture of the financial pressures Fed rate cuts could impose on a company heavily reliant on interest income from its reserves.\nHow Will the USDC Impact Play Out? To offset the projected revenue loss from lower interest rates, Omar estimates that the supply of USDC would need to increase dramatically. Specifically, the USDC impact necessitates an additional $28 billion in supply to reach a break-even point. This represents a substantial 44% increase over today’s approximately $64 billion USDC circulation.\nAchieving such growth in USDC supply is a significant undertaking, especially in a competitive stablecoin market. It underscores the challenge of maintaining profitability when a core revenue stream is under pressure. For any stablecoin issuer , diversifying revenue becomes paramount in such an environment. The road ahead for growth will require strategic maneuvers.\nHow is Circle Adapting to the New Crypto Finance Landscape? Understanding these potential headwinds, Circle has already begun implementing strategic maneuvers. The recent $1.5 billion share sale, which occurred just yesterday according to Omar, can be seen as a proactive measure to shore up capital. This move is critical as the company navigates a period of likely Fed rate cuts . This capital infusion provides a cushion against potential revenue shortfalls.\nFurthermore, Circle is actively pushing to launch new products designed to monetize transaction flow rather than solely relying on interest income from reserves. Initiatives like the Circle Payments Network (CPN) and Circle Chain are examples of this strategic shift. These platforms aim to generate revenue through transaction fees and services, creating more resilient and diversified income streams in the evolving landscape of crypto finance . This strategic pivot is essential for long-term sustainability and maintaining Circle’s revenue .\nIn conclusion, while the prospect of U.S. Fed rate cuts presents a clear challenge to Circle’s revenue model, the company is not standing still. Through capital raises and innovative product development focused on transaction monetization, Circle is actively working to mitigate the impact and ensure its continued growth as a leading stablecoin issuer. The ability to adapt to changing economic conditions will be crucial for its future success in the dynamic crypto space.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. How do Fed rate cuts specifically affect stablecoin issuers like Circle? Stablecoin issuers often hold a significant portion of their reserves in interest-bearing assets like short-term U.S. Treasury bills. When the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates, the yield on these assets decreases, directly reducing the interest income that stablecoin issuers, including Circle, earn on their reserves.\n2. What specific financial impact could Circle face from lower interest rates? According to a Dragonfly director, a 100-basis-point cut could reduce Circle’s run-rate gross revenue by $618 million (23%), gross profit by $303 million (30%), and operating margins by 3.3 percentage points. This highlights the significant potential USDC impact on the company’s financials.\n3. How much would USDC supply need to grow to offset revenue loss from rate cuts? To break even and offset the projected revenue loss from lower interest rates, the supply of USDC would need to increase by an estimated $28 billion. This represents a substantial 44% increase over its current circulation, posing a significant growth challenge for the stablecoin issuer .\n4. What strategies is Circle employing to counter the impact of rate cuts? Circle is implementing several strategies, including a recent $1.5 billion share sale to raise capital. Additionally, the company is focusing on launching new products like the Circle Payments Network (CPN) and Circle Chain, which aim to monetize transaction flow and diversify its revenue streams beyond interest income from reserves.\n5. What are Circle Payments Network (CPN) and Circle Chain? The Circle Payments Network (CPN) and Circle Chain are new product initiatives by Circle designed to generate revenue through transaction fees and services. These platforms aim to facilitate payment flows and build out blockchain infrastructure, contributing to Circle’s diversification in the broader crypto finance ecosystem.\nShare Your Thoughts!

    "text": "El Servicio de Emergencias 112 del Gobierno de Cantabria recomienda extremar la prudencia ya que la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (AEMET) ha activado los avisos amarillos por lluvia y tormentas para el sábado, día 10 de mayo.\nLa meteorología adversa se iniciará a las 13:00 horas y se extenderá hasta las 20:00 horas. Se esperan acumulaciones de 15 litros por metro cuadrado en una hora, tormentas y no se descarta granizo.\nRecomendaciones\nAnte este episodio el 112 recomienda retirar del exterior de las viviendas aquellos objetos que puedan ser arrastrados por el agua; revisar canalones y desagües; no estacionar vehículos en cauces secos ni a la orilla de ríos; circular, en la medida de lo posible, por carreteras principales y autopistas, y aumentar la prudencia al volante.\nEn el caso de encontrarse en campo abierto al inicio de una tormenta, es necesario buscar un lugar en el que cobijarse, como un coche o un edificio, evitando permanecer al aire libre. En el caso de estar lejos de un refugio adecuado, se insta a los ciudadanos a mantenerse alejado de masas de agua y de zonas altas, se deben de buscar lugares bajos o una depresiones del terreno y no tumbarse en el suelo. Además, nunca hay que refugiarse debajo de árboles, en particular si están aislados, y es conveniente alejarse de alambradas, verjas, vías del tren y otros objetos metálicos, al igual que de zonas ricas en mineral de hierro.\nEn casa se recomienda evitar corrientes de aire, ya que atraen los rayos, cerrando puertas y ventanas. Durante la tormenta se deben de evitar los baños y las duchas, ya que el agua es una buena conductora de la electricidad. Es conveniente, también, proteger los electrodomésticos desenchufando aquellos que se pueda, para evitar que sean dañados por una subida de tensión o que ocasionen descargas eléctricas.\nAdemás, se insta a la ciudadanía a que ante cualquier incidencia llame lo antes posible al 112 para procurar una rápida intervención. Además, a quienes tienen cuenta en redes sociales, se les anima a seguir los perfiles oficiales de entidades que facilitan información sobre emergencias, estado de las carreteras o meteorología.\n¿Desea recibir notificaciones cuando se publica algo nuevo?",
