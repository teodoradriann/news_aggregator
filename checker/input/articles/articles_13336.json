    "title": "First Alert Forecast: Snow squalls possible as arctic front sweeps Tri-State Area on Sunday",
    "text": "If you like the cold and snow, you’re going to love this week’s forecast!\nSunday, temperatures started off 20-30 degrees colder than Saturday. We were near 60 degrees in spots early yesterday, before dropping into the 40s by afternoon.\nToday, temps will only climb into the upper 30s to around 40.\nCBS New York\nWe have some sun to start and will likely have some to finish as well.\nIn between, an arctic front will sweep through bringing midday snow showers and squalls to the region. The window looks like 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., west to east.\nCBS New York\nWhile not much accumulation is expected, the issue with squalls is the sudden reduction in visibility on the roads, as a brief burst of heavy snow and gusty winds moves through. They’ll only last 10-20 minutes, but you’ll certainly want to avoid travel in areas where warnings are issued. Expect quick clearing once they pass.\nBehind the front, temps will tumble again tonight. Lows will fall to around 20 degrees in New York City and the teens in the suburbs.\nCBS New York\nWaking up Monday, wind chills will be in the teens and single digits. It’ll be cold but dry, and highs will struggle to get into the low and mid 30s.\nLate Monday night into Tuesday brings our next chance of more widespread snow. As of now, it’s not looking major, with accumulations generally in the 1-3″ range.\nCBS New York\nHowever, the Tuesday morning commute could be slick. Models have really struggled with this, but hopefully we’ll be able to fine tune the forecast over the next 24 hours.\nOtherwise, prepare for a true winter feel. Highs will only be in the low 30s at best this week, with wind chills in the teens and 20s.\nCBS New York",

    "title": "New snakehead species of fish found in Chokpot",
    "text": "SHILLONG, March 2: Meghalaya has once again gained recognition in the scientific community with the discovery of a new snakehead fish species, Channa nachi, found in a stream near Chokpot village in South Garo Hills.\nA team of researchers — J Praveenraj, N Moulitharan, A Pavan Kumar, RS Naveen, T Thackeray, R Yumnam, and SD Gurumayum — described the species in a recent study, highlighting its unique features and ecological significance.\nThe study notes that Channa nachi was found in a shallow, slow-flowing tributary of the Simsang river, a habitat rich in biodiversity. The stream also supports other freshwater species such as Schistura reticulofasciata, Dario kajal, and Pseudolaguvia sp., but Channa nachi stands out due to its striking appearance and distinct morphology.\nAccording to the study, Channa nachi belongs to the genus Channa, a group of elongated, predatory fish known as snakeheads, which are capable of surviving in low-oxygen environments. Researchers described the species as having a slender body with a bicolor pattern — creamish-yellow to pale-brown in the front and a rich blue in the rear, Pale-blue marbling on the ventral side, 10-12 pale brown saddles on the dorsal half, Absence of spots or blotches and No transverse markings on the caudal fin.\nThe name Channa nachi is derived from the Garo language, where “nachi” is a local term for the fish, reinforcing the cultural connection between the region’s indigenous communities and their aquatic biodiversity.\nFarham Sangma, a local nature enthusiast, first spotted the fish in 2020 and shared images with Dr Praveenraj, leading to its identification as a new species. Recognising his role in the discovery, researchers have proposed the common name “Farham’s snakehead.”\n“This discovery highlights the importance of local knowledge in scientific research,” the study stated. “Ornamental fish collectors from Northeast India have been instrumental in identifying new species, including Channa andrao, Channa bipuli, and Channa aristonei.”\nThe unique coloration and patterns of Channa nachi make it a potential candidate for the international ornamental fish trade. In recent years, colorful snakeheads from Northeast India have gained popularity among aquarium enthusiasts worldwide, bringing attention to the region’s rich aquatic biodiversity.\nHowever, scientists emphasise the need for standardised species descriptions using both morphological and molecular data to ensure accuracy in future identifications.\n“The discovery of Channa nachi is another example of Northeast India’s untapped biodiversity,” the study mentioned. “There is an urgent need for conservation measures to protect these unique species and their fragile habitats.”",

    "text": "Nikki Haley didn't say slavery caused the Civil War. Now she's facing major backlash Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley is facing significant backlash after failing to mention slavery as a driving force behind the Civil War during a campaign stop in New Hampshire. At an event on Wednesday, a voter asked Haley: \"what was the cause of the United States Civil War?\" She replied that the cause \"was basically how government was going to run, the freedoms, and what people could and couldn't do.\" \"I think it always comes down to the role of government and what the rights of the people are,\" Haley continued. \"And I will always stand by the fact that, I think, government was intended to secure the rights and freedoms of the people.\" After Haley gave her answer, the voter told her that it was \"astonishing\" that she gave an answer \"without mentioning the word 'slavery.'\" Last night, [President Biden](https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1740221284284256645?) said on X in response to a video of this exchange that the Civil War was indeed \"about slavery.\" It was about slavery.— Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) [https://t.co/q9bTDvtPne] [December 28, 2023] During an interview with a local radio station on Thursday, Haley addressed what happened. \"Of course the Civil War was about slavery,\" she said. \"We know that. That's the easy part of it.\" Haley explained that she was interested in talking about what lessons should be drawn from the Civil War and defended her answer to the voter. \"I know it's about slavery,\" she said. \"I am from the South.\" Haley has a [complicated history](https://www.npr.org/2023/02/15/1157122486/nikki-haley-confederate-flag-race-president-2024) when it comes to issues of race. As a woman of color, her campaign was angling to strike a different tone on issues of race and identity – especially in comparison to her chief rival in the GOP primary, former President Donald Trump. As South Carolina's governor, Haley ordered the confederate flag be removed from the grounds of the state capitol following the 2015 shooting of Black parishioners at a church in Charleston in 2015. Haley also [condemned Trump](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/25/haley-trump-charlottesville-comments-401587) following the racist and antisemitic gathering in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017. (She also served as U.N. ambassador to Trump from 2017 to 2018.) The Republican Party, though, has been striking an overall different tone when it comes to issues of race and the country's history with slavery and white supremacy. Republican governors, including some of Haley's rivals in the race, have been [eliminating](https://www.npr.org/2023/05/15/1176210007/florida-ron-desantis-dei-ban-diversity) diversity and inclusion efforts in higher education, as well as [banning books](https://www.wusf.org/education/2023-06-01/politifact-fl-desantis-said-not-a-single-book-was-banned-districts-have-removed-dozens) that are about race. Backlash to Haley's comments comes less than three weeks before Republican voters start voting in early primary states. The Iowa caucus, the first primary contest, is Jan. 15. Haley's campaign, in particular, has had a surprising amount of momentum in the last several months. The once crowded field of presidential hopefuls has been shrinking ahead of early state elections but Haley has been one of the few candidates actually gaining more support. Just this week, there have been reports that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' campaign is [struggling](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/24/us/politics/desantis.html) and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy has [cut TV ad spending](https://www.npr.org/2023/12/27/1221828944/vivek-ramaswamys-campaign-has-slowed-tv-ad-spending-ahead-of-the-iowa-caucus). Trump has had a commanding lead in the polls in early states and nationally. Haley, however, has been the only candidate in the primary that has presented any sort of challenge for the former president. Haley routinely polls second or third in early state polling and performs well when in head-to-head polling with Biden. Copyright 2023 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.",

    "text": "TORONTO — Chris Bassitt declared everyone in the Toronto Blue Jays organization should bear the blame for its shoddy season.\nBassitt (8-9) made his remarks after the Tampa Bay Rays (52-51) throttled the Blue Jays (46-56) 13-0 with 16 hits in the rubber match of their three-game series on Thursday.\n“I would say there’s not a single person in probably the whole organization who's not disappointed right now,\" Bassitt said.\n“It just sucks. I don’t think anyone thought this is what was going to happen.\n“I don’t think there’s one person with clean hands right now. I really don’t think we’ve done anything well this year. Well, maybe (Daulton) Varsho’s defence.\n“Besides Varsho’s defence, I don’t see how anyone can say ‘I’ve done what I should.'\"\nBassitt also remarked that the embarrassing loss was because the team has been fighting \"demons.\"\nWhat did he mean?\n“Everything that’s been going on,\" Bassitt said.\n\"It’s whatever it might be, giving up that many hits, not being able to hit and the trade deadline. Who’s going to be here, who’s not going to be here? There’s a million different things right now that are just not great.\"\nWith the trade deadline five days away, and the Blue Jays not meeting expectations of contending, the assumptions have been general manager Ross Atkins will sell off a handful of veteran players in exchange for prospects.\n“You have ideas of who’s not going to be around much longer and a lot of these people mean a lot to you so yeah, it’s not fun,\" Bassitt said.\nBassitt admitted he wasn't sharp before 41,148 at Rogers Centre. He departed after five innings down 3-0 after tossing 97 pitches, giving up five hits and a walk with six strikeouts.\nBut then reliever Trevor Richards entered and was worse. He only faced seven hitters, giving up four runs on four hits and two walks.\n“He’s been really good for us, especially earlier in the year,\" Blue Jays manager John Scheider said of Richards. \"But he doesn’t have a good feel for his change-up right now.\n\"When you have two pitches you have to be good with them. He doesn’t have his command right now and he’s falling behind (in the count).”\nTampa followed its four-run sixth inning by tacking on five more in the seventh.\nErnie Clement and his knuckleball had to be summoned from his third-base position to pitch the ninth and save the bullpen from further depletion. He gave up a run as the Rays pushed their hit total to 16.\nTaj Bradley (6-4) pitched six shutout innings and allowed only two hits, winning his third straight start.\nThe 23-year-old Bradley surrendered a one-out double to left from Spencer Horwitz and an infield hit to Vladimir Guerrero Jr. in the first inning.\nBut then the Rays righty settled down to retire 11 in a row and 17 of his final 18, allowing only a walk to Danny Jansen in the fifth. Bradley finished with seven strikeouts and a walk.\nBrandon Lowe, Isaac Paredes, Alex Jackson and Amed Rosario were the big offensive producers in the series finale before 41,148 at Rogers Centre.\nLowe sent a 414-foot homer into the fifth deck down the right-field line to open the scoring. He knocked in two more runs with four hits and also twice walked.\nParedes drove in four runs with two hits, while Jackson checked in with three RBI with two hits. Rosario pounded a double and two singles.\nON THE MEND\nBlue Jays utility infielder Isiah Kiner-Falefa (sprained left knee) could begin a rehab assignment with Triple-A Buffalo on Saturday, provided there are no setbacks, according to Schneider.\nKiner-Falefa has been out since July 1 and has enjoyed a solid season with a .292 average and .338 on-base percentage.\nON DECK\nThe Blue Jays begin a three-game set against the Texas Rangers on Friday to conclude their nine-outing, 10-day homestand. Toronto's Yusei Kikuchi (4-9) will open the series against lefty Andrew Heaney (4-10).\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published July 25, 2024.\nTim Wharnsby, The Canadian Press",

    "text": "By Priscilla Alvarez and Michael Williams, CNN\nWashington (CNN) — A new law that gives local law enforcement in Texas the authority to arrest migrants “violates the US Constitution,” the Department of Justice said in a letter to Gov. Greg Abbott on Thursday, threatening to sue unless Abbott backs down from enforcing it.\nThe letter, obtained by CNN, marks the latest escalation between President Joe Biden and Abbott over the handling of the US-Mexico border.\nEarlier this month, Abbott, a Republican, signed into law the measure, known as Senate Bill 4 , which gives local law enforcement the power to arrest migrants and gives judges the ability to issue orders to remove people from the United States. The White House slammed the law, calling it “incredibly extreme.” It’s expected to take effect in March.\nPrincipal deputy assistant attorney general Brian Boynton said in his letter to Abbott Thursday that “the United States intends to file suit to enjoin the enforcement of SB 4 unless Texas agrees to refrain from enforcing the law.”\nWhile the federal government is “committed to … securing the border,” Boynton wrote, the Texas law is “contrary to these goals.”\nThe ongoing surge of migrants at the US-Mexico border has placed immense pressure on local and federal resources. Thursday’s legal threat follows a DOJ lawsuit against Texas earlier this year over the state’s use of floating barriers in the Rio Grande . That lawsuit is still making its way through the courts.\nThe enforcement of immigration law is a federal responsibility, and opponents of the Texas measure argue it’s unconstitutional.\nThe law has sent ripples of fear throughout the Latino community in Texas, which makes up 40% of the state’s population . Civil-rights groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, filed a lawsuit seeking to block the measure.\nThe Justice Department’s threat to sue comes on the heels of a high-levels talks between senior US and Mexican officials this week",

Stephen William Wells told officers who interviewed and charged him with five counts of sexual assault on a young girl that if they searched his phone and personal computer they would discover hundreds of images of children being sexually abused - which they did.\nAppearing before Truro Crown Court for sentencing today (Thursday, August 8), having pleaded guilty to all charges against him at Truro Magistrates&apos; Court last month, it was heard that the 68-year-old from Northey Close in Shortlanesend started touching up the girl.\nJason Beal, prosecuting, said Wells&apos; crimes were discovered when his victim gave reason for her mum to become suspicious and she then informed the NSPCC children&apos;s charity and Devon and Cornwall Police . In a victim impact statement read out in court, Well&apos;s victim&apos;s mother said the assault had devastated her whole family and left her daughter traumatised, angry and sad.\nRead next: Jailed in July at Truro Crown Court: Fake builder who lied about wife&apos;s death and other criminals banged up\nRead next: Paedophile left girl, 13, so traumatised she was unable to go to school\nRobin Smith, defending, said Wells had not shrunk from his shocking behaviour and had made a full admission to the police after being arrested and charged almost three years ago. He said: \"In his interview with the police he admitted other things to officers and told them that they would find indecent pictures of children on his electronic devices. He accepts his fate today.\"\nMs Smith added: \"He was in the grip of an alcohol dependency and had been for some time which had a degree of impact on his thinking. Being arrested by police in 2021 was a watershed moment for him.\"\nGet the best stories and latest news delivered to your inbox every day. Choose what you want here .\nHis honour Judge Simon Carr told Wells the abuse he inflicted had been systematic and prolonged adding that he had broken this young person&apos;s and her family&apos;s trust in the worst possible way.\nHe added: \"This abuse went on... for your own sexual gratification and when your devices were examined hundreds of images of the worst type of child abuse were found. Your actions have had a profound effect on your victim and her family who have shown great courage to appear in court today. Your alcohol problem does not justify or explain your behaviour in any way.\"\nWells was sentenced to five years in prison.

Learn more\nThe key to any flawless makeup look is a well-crafted makeup brush. A good brush is durable, distributes pigment evenly, and blends seamlessly without irritating the skin or causing patchiness. While different brushes are intended for different purposes, there aren't technically any hard and fast rules. The most important thing is to find what works for you and invest in quality brushes — and most of the time, bristle softness is a major indicator of quality.\nAside from feeling luxurious, the softest brushes will also help your makeup to look its best. \"Whether they are natural hair or synthetic, you want something that feels soft to touch against the eyes and face — this will be key to blending,\" says makeup artist and Stila Global Beauty Director Charlie Riddle . \"Any brush that is more coarse will make your makeup look more textured and difficult to blend.\"\nWhen choosing brushes, it's also helpful to consider how often you'll use them. If you typically use makeup brushes daily or travel with them regularly, it is worth it to invest in high-quality ones. \"I always look for quality because I wash them so often,\" says Los Angeles-based makeup artist Tarryn Feldman .\nAdvertisement Our top picks for the best makeup brushes, according to makeup artists: Advertisement The best face brushes Stila Double-Ended Complexion Brush This multitasking tool features a large fluffy brush on one end and a smaller, more precise brush on the other.\nShop at Amazon External link Arrow An arrow icon, indicating this redirects the user.\"\nSpecifics\nBristle type: Synthetic Great for: Powder, light foundation, cream products, concealer, highlighter This multitasking tool features a large fluffy brush on one end and a smaller, more precise brush on the other. \"I love dual ended brushes,\" says Riddle. \"Not only are you getting two for one but this is great for buffing on a light foundation or cream products.

It is one of the most versatile brushes in my kit.\"\nAdvertisement Natural hair versus synthetic brushes Makeup brush bristles are available in three main categories: natural, synthetic, or a blend of the two. If you adhere to a vegan lifestyle, prefer vegan products, or have any allergies to animal hair that's used in natural brushes, you'll want to stick with synthetic brushes. These are typically made from nylon, polyester, and other synthetic fibers.\nBoth natural and synthetic brushes can be beneficial for different reasons. \"Anything natural hair is amazing for blending; eyes, blush, powder.\" Riddle explains. \"Synthetics are great for applying primers, foundations, concealers, contour. I wouldn't say one is better than the other — it really depends on the specific use of the brush.\"\nCatherine Santino Freelance Writer Catherine Santino is a freelance writer who covers beauty, culture, and entertainment.
