    "text": "By Ismael Lopez\nSAN JOSE, Dec 28 (Reuters) – Nicaraguan police detained on Thursday two senior Catholic priests who are close to the country’s top church leader, a person with knowledge of the matter said, raising to at least six the number of clergymen detained this week.\nThe source, who declined to be named for fear of arrest, said the two priests were detained for publicly praying for jailed Bishop Rolando Alvarez, the most prominent critic of President Daniel Ortega.\nLocal media outlet Confidencial named the priests as Carlos Aviles and Hector Treminio, and noted that their arrest brings to at least six the number of priests detained over the past week, adding that two of the clerics had already been released.\nThe government’s press office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nOver the past few years, Ortega’s government has targeted members of the Catholic church, a crackdown officials have in the past said was needed to punish treasonous behavior or other alleged crimes.\nAviles is the second-highest ranking cleric in the Archdiocese of Managua, led by Cardinal Leopoldo Brenes, while Treminio is its treasurer.\nAlvarez, the bishop of Matagalpa, forcefully criticized the government’s deadly response to mass protests that broke out in 2018, and was convicted of treason and sentenced to a 26-year prison term earlier this year.\nLast week, police arrested Bishop Isidro Mora of the Siuna diocese, making him the second bishop to be detained after Alvarez’s detention in 2022.\nMany of the latest clergymen detained were arrested because they publicly offered prayers for Alvarez, according to the source and local media, but the government has not issued any statements explaining the priests’ alleged crimes.\nNicaraguan Bishop Silvio Baez, who has been living in exile in Florida since 2019 and is the second-ranking leader of the archdiocese, called for the priests to be released.\n“I ask God to protect them and that they be freed immediately!” wrote in a post on X on Thursday.\nAccording to exiled Nicaraguan researcher Martha Patricia Molina, who publishes records of what she describes as the persecution of the Catholic Church under Ortega, the number of bishops, priests and seminarians behind bars in the country currently stands at nine.

Plus, too much alcohol and not enough water is dehydrating.\n\"This means that the urinary tract is not able to expel any bacteria present as water is needed to get rid of bacteria.”\nThe main signs of cystitis include pain when urinating, cloudy urine, blood in urine or feeling feverish and run down.\nHow can you reduce the risk?\nSultan explained the best ways to avoid getting ill.\nHe continued: \"Drink plenty [of water] and don’t rely on alcohol for fluid as it dehydrates.\n\"Aim for two litres of water more every day, including a big glass of water last thing before you go to bed and first thing when you get up.\n\"If you get up in the night to pee have another glass of water then. When you go to the loo wipe yourself front to back.\n\"The source of bacteria in a urinary tract infection is usually the back passage and the distance between this and the urinary opening in women is very short putting women at particular risk of cystitis.\nLATEST DEVELOPMENTS\nPartying and drinking more alcohol in December can increase the risk of the illness\nPA\n\"Wet cotton underwear too as this allows the genital area to breathe.”\nHow to get rid of it?\nSultan said: \"If you get cystitis, tackle it fast and try an effervescent tablet.\n\"When fully dissolved in water, the solution contains Potassium citrate and Citric acid.\n\"Potassium citrate makes the urine more alkaline, which helps soothe the bladder and urethra lining, helping to relieve the discomfort caused by the infection swiftly.\"",

    "text": "2023-12-29 00:47:29 For fans of online gaming, being able to communicate with teammates is vital. In Battle R Switch games, as with other titles, using a gaming headset with a built-in microphone can significantly improve the gaming experience. However, some players may experience issues using their microphone or enabling voice chat. Without making you wait any longer, here’s how to talk on Fortnite Switch with a gaming headset. Fix the problem by checking your audio settings If your headset is compatible, make sure the audio settings are configured correctly in the console and game menus. To do this, follow these steps: - Go to the Nintendo Switch settings and select “ Son ”, and “Audio output” - Choose the option “ Headphones plugged into digital audio porte » if your headset plugs directly into the console jack. Instead, opt for “Any USB Device” if you are using a wireless adapter - In the Fortnite options, go to the “Audio” section. Then, make sure the microphone volume is set to a sufficient level. Follow these steps and make sure your headset is compatible. If, however, your microphone still does not work, the problem may be due to a poor connection or a hardware failure. In this case, try plugging your headphones into a different jack. Put it on the console itself, on the dock or via an adapter. Otherwise, consider investing in a new gaming headset specifically designed for the Nintendo Switch, as compatibility is often guaranteed. Enable voice chat in Fortnite Switch Once your headset is properly connected and configured, it is crucial toenable voice chat in Fortnite game settings. Here are the steps to follow to enable this feature: - Launch the Fortnite game and go to the options - Select the “ Audio » - Locate the option “ Chat vocal » and activate it by switching it to “ Oui » or « Enabled » according to the terms used - Also check that the option “ Mode audio » is set to “ Communicate with my team » to be able to hear your teammates and talk to them during games Note that some game modes, notably single-player games, may automatically disable voice chat. To take full advantage of this feature, choose team games with your friends or members of your community. Also consider investing in a good gaming headset from our comparison of the best audio equipment of the moment. Adjust voice chat settings When using voice chat in Fortnite Switch, it may be helpful to adjust certain settings to enjoy optimal communication with your teammates. So, reduce the volume of music and sound effects to better hear your teammates. This prevents background noise from drowning out their voices. Ensuite, adjust the microphone volume at a level sufficient for your voice to be clearly heard by your playing partners, but not so loud as to disturb them. Furthermore, do not hesitate to activate the “Noise reduction” option of your gaming headset. Available as an option, this feature eliminates extraneous ambient sounds and improves the quality of voice chat. Finally, to get the most out of your gaming headset on Fortnite Switch, choose a quiet environment to play. You limit parasitic noise that could disrupt communication. Prefer to use closed headphones offering good sound insulation rather than open headphones which allow more external noise to pass through. 1703813976 #optimize #gaming #experience #gaming #headset #Fortnite #Switch",
