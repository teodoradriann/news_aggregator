    "title": "Even SP has wilted under the Hindutva wave, says party leader",
    "text": "Former SP leader Saleem Sherwani and party president Akhilesh Yadav.\nSamajwadi Party member, five-time former Badaun MP and ex-Union minister, Saleem Sherwani, says things have reached such a pass that even a staunch secularist party like his, has wilted under the Hindutva onslaught.\n“Times have really changed. Even if a Muslim raises a legitimate issue today, he is branded an anti-national,’’ Sherwani told this reporter.\nLast week, he quit the post of Samajwadi Party (SP) national general secretary over the party’s “inappropriate” selection of Rajya Sabha candidates and neglect of the Muslim community and their issues.\nSherwani has denied that he had left the party post because he was denied a Rajya Sabha berth from UP this time. “I have repeatedly requested a Rajya Sabha seat for the Muslim community, according to the party’s tradition. Although my name was not considered, there was not a single Muslim candidate among the nominees announced by the party. The way tickets have been distributed for the Rajya Sabha shows that the SP does not give importance to the PDA or the pichada, Dalit, alpsankhyak (backward, Dalit, and minorities) sections anymore,’’ he said.\nThe SP has fielded veteran Dalit leader Ramji Lal Suman, actor Jaya Bachchan, whose term as RS member of SP comes to an end on April 2, and a former UP chief secretary Alok Ranjan, for the current Rajya Sabha election.\nThe veteran former MP said: “I have been consistently discussing the situation of Muslims with party chief Akhilesh Yadav, conveying to him that the community is feeling neglected and losing faith in the SP. There is a growing distance between the two, and the party should not underestimate their support. The sentiment among Muslims is increasing that no one in the secular platform is willing to address their legitimate issues.”\nTaking his logic to another level, Sherwani queried: “This raises the question of how different the SP from the BJP is?”\nAccording to him, when the political discourse centres only around the BJP’s ability to ‘show Muslims their place’, the country has taken a dangerous turn. “Unemployment, poverty, joblessness, you name it, impact the majority 80% population of the country, who are Hindus. Where is the question of putting Muslims their place? The worst affected are the Hindus.’’\nSaleem Sherwani won his first Lok Sabha election as a Congress candidate from Badaun in 1984. After that, he won four elections from the constituency as the SP candidate. When the party denied him a ticket to the seat in 2009 and fielded Mulayam’s nephew Dharmendra Yadav instead, Sherwani moved back to the Congress and re-contested the seat. But Dharmendra won. In 2020, Sherwani came back to the SP.\nAsked how Mulayam Singh Yadav would have stood up to this new alignment of forces and this new atmosphere, Sherwani said it is difficult to say, but “maybe, he would have been more independent and taken a stand.”\nSherwani did not place too much trust in the INDIA alliance. “The attempt to form a strong opposition alliance is proving to be futile. No one seems to be taking it seriously. It appears that the Opposition is more interested in fighting each other rather than combating the BJP,’’ he said, but added that “the only silver lining is the new SP-Congress seat sharing in UP.’’\nAs per the terms of this agreement announced this week, Congress will contest 17 seats while the remaining 63 will go to Samajwadi Party and other allies as part of the INDIA bloc.\nRead more news like this on HindustanTimes.com",

    "title": "Will Zohran Mamdani kill the best thing about New York City public schools?",
    "text": "With Zohran Mamdani projected to win the New York City Democratic mayoral primary, his slate of socialist-influenced policies , from city-owned grocery stores to a rent freeze, are one step closer to reality. Mamdani's socialist agenda won't stop with housing policy or the minimum wage. It will also hit America's largest public school system and aim to kill the best thing about it.\nWhile New York City schools are routinely criticized for overspending, underaccountable teachers' unions, and general dysfunction, the city's group of selective high schools is a consistent bright spot. Eight schools, including Mamdani's alma mater, Bronx High School of Science, admit students through an exam. The schools give talented students from all over the city the ability to escape chaotic local schools and receive an education at some of the top public high schools in the country.\nHowever, the Specialized High School Admissions Test (SHSAT), which is the test used to admit students, has long come under fire for what critics say is a racial bias. That's because Asian students overwhelmingly perform best on these tests. In 2023, for example, over two-thirds of the students at Stuyvesant High School (widely regarded as the best of the eight high schools) were Asian. However, this framing is reductive. It's worth noting that Asians have the lowest median income of any racial group in New York City. And, contrary to the popular vision of magnet schools being comprised of upper-middle-class white and Asian students, New York's selective high schools are economically diverse; 50 percent of Stuyvesant students are economically disadvantaged. At Bronx Science, it's 52 percent .\nBut that hasn't kept politicians from attacking the schools as segregated, and the SHSAT as racist. In 2018, then-Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) called the high schools a \"monumental injustice.\" He attempted to survert a state law protecting the SHSAT, but the admissions change has so far been tied up in a legal battle.\nOver the years, Mamdani has stated that he would also attempt to ditch the admissions test. \"As a graduate of Bronx Science, I have personally witnessed just how segregated New York City public schools are, especially our specialized high schools,\" he said in a 2022 interview . \"I support measures to integrate our public schools and fully fund our education system, including the abolition of the SHSAT.\"\nLast month he made a similar statement , saying that \"My administration will focus on addressing the root educational causes of this segregation by implementing recommendations from the 2019 School Diversity Advisory Group's at elementary and middle schools across our city and support an independent analysis of the Specialized HS exam for gender and racial bias.\" The recommendations he mentions argue in favor of eliminating elementary school-level gifted and talented programs, and placing a moratorium on new test-in high schools.\nWhile it's reasonable to be troubled by the disproportionate lack of black and Hispanic students at specialized high schools, it's important to remember that ditching a test that reveals entrenched inequalities does nothing to ameliorate them. Further, the city already has a program to allow low-income students who barely missed out on admissions to still attend specialized schools with extra study during the summer, which seems like a fair way to balance merit with concerns that students with fewer resources may miss out on admissions.\nGetting rid of a merit-based opportunities metric can't close persistent achievement gaps between ethnic groups. Instead, it will deprive talented students—low-income students whose parents can't afford private school in particular—of the ability to attend a school with similarly talented peers, while making it harder to identify how and why other students are struggling.",

    "text": "Environ 25’000 personnes sont confinées depuis dix jours et risquent de manquer de nourriture dans des villages indigènes de l’Amazonie colombienne (sud), en raison des menaces de dissidents des FARC, a déclaré jeudi le gouverneur local. Dans les municipalités de Solano et Milan (sud), «une confrontation est imminente» entre l’État-major central (EMC) et la «Segunda Marquetalia», a indiqué sur une radio nationale le gouverneur du Département Caqueta, Luis Francisco Ruiz. Ces deux groupes armés rivaux sont tous deux des dissidents des FARC (Forces armées révolutionnaires de Colombie), guérilla marxiste démantelée depuis la signature d’un accord de paix historique signé en 2016 avec cette guérilla marxiste. «Très dangereux» Avec des tracts, ainsi que des audios et des vidéos diffusés sur les réseaux sociaux, les rebelles interdisent aux habitants de se déplacer. «Nous ressentons de la peur, de l’angoisse, de l’anxiété (...) Nous ne pouvons pas dormir», a déclaré par téléphone à l’AFP un dirigeant communautaire local qui a préféré garder l’anonymat. «Il est très dangereux de sortir». Un audio attribué à un chef présumé de la guérilla circule depuis la semaine dernière. «Personne n’est autorisé à marcher le long de la rivière (...) De peur que des innocents n’y tombent (...) Tout le monde reste tranquille», prévient cet enregistrement, dont l’AFP n’a pas pu vérifier l’authenticité. «Il y a une restriction de la mobilité sur les rivières Orteguaza et Caqueta qui nuit principalement» à deux communautés indigènes situées près de la triple frontière entre la Colombie, l’Équateur et le Pérou, a expliqué le gouverneur Ruiz. «Aucun contrôle» «Cela concerne environ 25’000 personnes, isolées par les restrictions imposées sur les rivières dans une zone où le seul accès se fait actuellement par voies d’eau». Au cours des dix derniers jours, seules «deux barges (...) avec des denrées non périssables» ont pu entrer dans cette zone. Pour le reste, il n’y a «aucune mobilité de transport commercial», a-t-il déploré. Le gouverneur s’est joint à l’appel lancé lundi par les organisations indigènes, qui ont demandé au président Gustavo Petro «des solutions immédiates face à l’encerclement permanent, aux menaces et aux atteintes à la libre circulation des communautés» dans la région. «Ce qui est démontré ici, c’est que nous n’avons aucun contrôle sur le fleuve Caquetá», a constaté de son côté le président Petro, en demandant aux forces de sécurité d’intervenir. Cessez-le-feu Premier président de gauche de l’histoire du pays, Gustavo Petro a entamé des discussions avec les principaux groupes armés opérant dans le pays, dont les dissidents des FARC, avec l’ELN guévariste, des groupes paramilitaires et des narcotrafiquants. Cette politique de «paix totale» se heurte à de nombreux obstacles et est sévèrement critiquée par l’opposition, alors que certains de ces groupes armés ont multiplié leurs actions pour accroître leur influence territoriale. L’EMC est le plus grand groupe dissident des anciennes FARC, avec quelque 3500 combattants. Il discute avec les délégués de Gustavo Petro depuis octobre dans le cadre d’un cessez-le-feu convenu jusqu’à juillet. La «Segunda Marquetalia» compte environ 1600 hommes sous le commandement de l’ancien numéro deux des FARC, Ivan Marquez, qui avait participé à l’accord de paix de 2016. En 2019, le chef de la guérilla a renié le pacte, repris les armes et s’est réfugié à la frontière colombo-vénézuélienne où il a été un moment donné comme mort, selon les renseignements militaires.",
