    "title": "3 Tech Stocks Suited Nicely for Income Investors",
    "text": "Tech stocks have been red-hot in 2023, delivering outsized gains. They’ve jumped back in favor following a tough 2022, with expectations of a less-hawkish fed helping drive performances.\nOther than tech stocks, investors also love dividends, as they can provide a nice buffer against drawdowns in other positions and a passive income stream.\nAnd interestingly enough, several tech stocks – Microsoft\nMSFT, NetEase NTES, and International Business Machines IBM – reward their shareholders with quarterly payouts.\nLet’s take a closer look at each.\nMicrosoft\nMicrosoft shares have been big-time outperformers in 2023 thanks to artificial intelligence excitement and a broader sentiment shift overall. Analysts have taken a bullish stance on the company’s current year outlook, with the $11.13 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate 2% higher over the last year.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMSFT shares presently yield a respectable 0.8% annually, modestly above the respective Zacks sector average. And the tech titan has shown a commitment to shareholders, carrying a 10% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMicrosoft’s cash-generating abilities help secure the payout. The company generated a sizable $59.5 billion in free cash flow in FY23, with the trailing twelve-month figure totaling an equally impressive $63.3 billion.\nNetEase\nNetEase, Inc. is an Internet technology company engaged in the development of applications, services, and other technologies for the Internet in China. The stock is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with earnings expectations moving higher across all timeframes.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nShares currently yield a solid 2.3% annually paired with a sustainable payout ratio sitting at 36% of the company’s earnings. And NetEase has shown a notable commitment to increasingly rewarding shareholders, boasting a 27% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nIn addition, the company’s growth profile is impossible to ignore, with consensus expectations for its current year suggesting 45% earnings growth on 2% higher sales. Peeking ahead to FY24, estimates allude to an additional 8% earnings growth paired with a 12% revenue bump.\nIBM\nIBM is an information technology (IT) company. Shares have been considerable outperformers over the last three months, up 18% compared to the S&P 500’s 11% gain on the back of better-than-expected quarterly results.\nShares currently yield a sizable 4.1% annually, nowhere near the 0.7% average within the Zacks Computer and Technology sector. Impressively, the company is a member of the elite Dividend Aristocrats group, showing a commendable commitment to shareholders through 25+ years of increased payouts.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nBottom Line\nInvestors love tech stocks. And dividends.\nFor those seeking exposure to each, all three above – Microsoft\nMSFT, NetEase NTES, and International Business Machines IBM – fit the criteria nicely.\nZacks Naming Top 10 Stocks for 2024\nWant to be tipped off early to our 10 top picks for the entirety of 2024?\nHistory suggests their performance could be sensational.\nFrom 2012 (when our Director of Research, Sheraz Mian assumed responsibility for the portfolio) through November, 2023, the Zacks Top 10 Stocks gained +974.1%, nearly TRIPLING the S&P 500’s +340.1%.

    "text": "Construction Equipment Guide\n470 Maryland Drive\nFort Washington, PA 19034\n800-523-2200\nThu April 11, 2024 - National Edition\nIgnite Attachments, a manufacturer of compact equipment attachments, has introducted The Fit Finder tool, a digital tool that allows customers to find the attachments and implements that match compact equipment machine specifications for existing machines with the click of a button.\nIgnite Attachments was the first OEM attachment manufacturer to develop this type of reliable online tool, ensuring customer confidence and satisfaction even in a new digital landscape. With more than 10,000 data points from across all major compact equipment brands, the Fit Finder remains the most robust and user-friendly tool of its kind in the attachment and implement industry, according to the manufacturer.\n\"Online shopping is a staple of the modern economy,\" said Trisha Pearson, business director of Ignite Attachments. \"However, making large purchases online, like attachments, can still be nerve-wracking for many. When we set out to disrupt a stagnant industry, we knew we'd need to develop a tool that takes the guesswork out of attachment ordering and allows customers to shop with confidence. The Fit Finder provides the convenience of online shopping, available when and where it works best for customers, with a precise fit for peace of mind.\"\nPurchasing after-market attachments for existing compact equipment can be a challenging process, especially for customers looking to buy outside the carrier brand. Backed by a database of more than 10,000 relevant specs from across all major models and manufacturers, the Fit Finder eliminates the need for tedious side by side spec comparisons. Customers simply select the make and model of their existing equipment from the tool's drop-down menu. In seconds, customers are served all the Ignite products that perfectly match with the specified carrier. From there customers can either check out the details of a product or simply click \"add to cart.\"\n\"It's as easy as that\" Pearson said. \" Time is money. The more time we can save customers, the more efficient and hassle-free we can make the buying process, the more our customers benefit. The Fit Finder tool can eliminate hours of research. This convenience, paired with our transparent pricing, overall economy and direct-to-you shipping, provides significant savings.\"\nFor more information, visit www.igniteattachments.com.",

Stay on top of boredom and hunger with these insanely genius car travel hacks for parents traveling with kids!\nSource: Better Homes & Gardens\nEvery car deserves a well placed trash bin, especially if you have kids in the vehicle. This cereal container turned car garbage bin is genius! Keep extra bags underneath and swap them out each time you hit a gas station. The plastic container ensures that if your bag leaks your vehicle will stay clean and dry!\nYour vehicle is bound to get a little stinky with kids in tow. Between smelly diapers and stinky feet I do not want to be stuck in a stinky car on my road trip. Forget the air fresheners that get in the way and go with this genius PERK Visor Wrap car air freshener instead! It tucks onto your visor using a specially contoured clip that grips, allowing the visor to be used as intended – to block the sun.

Pack a separate bag with eggs filled with dry snacks like cheese crackers, dry cereal and raisins.\nThese ready made dinner kits from Modern Parents Messy Kids are the perfect way to eat dinner on the go while in the car. I make up several of these with plastic utensils, napkins, and a straw all tucked in a plastic bag and keep them in the glove box.

    "text": "According to a Reuters exclusive report , disagreements over Israel’s future military presence in Gaza are hindering progress on a ceasefire and hostage deal.\nThe report, based on information from ten sources including Hamas officials and Western diplomats, reveals that disagreements over Israel’s future military deployment in Gaza and Palestinian prisoner releases are the main obstacles.\nThe sources say Hamas is particularly concerned about Israel’s demand to keep troops deployed along the Netzarim Corridor, which divides northern and southern Gaza, and the Philadelphi Corridor along the Egypt-Gaza border. These demands were reportedly introduced after Hamas had accepted a version of the ceasefire proposal presented by President Joe Biden in May.\nHamas Expresses Frustration Over ‘Last Minute’ Demand One source close to the talks stated, “Hamas sees Israel as having changed its conditions and parameters ‘last-minute,’ and worries any concessions it makes would be met by more demands.” The Israeli Prime Minister’s office, however, denies making new demands, asserting that their position builds on the previous proposal.\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken recently concluded a trip to the region, urging Hamas to accept a new U.S. proposal aimed at narrowing differences between the parties. Blinken emphasized, “Once that happens we also have to complete the detailed implementation agreements that go along with putting the ceasefire into effect.”\nRelated Story: US Continues to Back Israel Despite Global Calls for Gaza Ceasefire\nThe next round of talks is expected to take place in Cairo in the coming days, focusing on the U.S. bridging proposal. Key negotiators, including CIA director Bill Burns and Mossad chief David Barnea, are expected to attend.\nAs negotiations continue, control over the Philadelphi Corridor remains a sensitive issue, particularly for Egypt. Egyptian security sources say that while Egypt is prepared to enhance security measures in the area, it rejects the presence of Israeli troops there.\nRead more at Reuters.",
