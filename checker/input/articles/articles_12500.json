    "text": "Madison Streets Division no longer plowing in response to snowstorm MADISON, Wis. (WMTV) - Madison Streets Division will no longer be plowing all Madison streets in response to Friday’s snowstorm. According to the city, a rapid response to the salt routes kept the main thoroughfares open. Crews began plowing [Thursday night](https://www.wmtv15news.com/2024/03/22/madison-streets-division-plows-continue-monitoring-salt-routes/) and continued through the day Friday while the storm was taking place. Melting is expected to continue throughout the day as the most intense part of the snowstorm has passed. The warmer weather and rising pavement temperatures will help improve conditions, including residential areas that were not plowed or salted. The city says drivers can expect the salt routes to be in good driving condition and note that untreated residential areas may still be slippery. Cold temperatures are expected Friday night and might cause patchy slick spots. The weekend could potentially bring another snow event overnight Saturday and last into Sunday. Streets Division crews will be monitoring the weather to see if plows will be needed again.

The key areas to tackle are the detergent drawer, drum, seals, window and filter.\n“Firstly I would locate the filter and remove it. Soak the filter itself in a bucket of warm water with one part of white vinegar added while you tackle other areas of the machine.\n\"If you can reach inside the filter housing, then clean this area using a vinegar spray which is antibacterial and will destroy any mould spores in there.\"\nThe same vinegar spray and a cloth can be used to wipe down all the seals inside the washing machine.

    "title": "Don't Buy the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE - These 4 Alternatives are Better - Tech Advisor",
    "text": "Samsung has just announced the Galaxy S24 FE smartphone alongside the Galaxy Tab S10 series of tablets. However, if you’re considering buying one, I have important news for you.\nAs we noted in our Galaxy S23 FE review , the timing of the FE (‘fan edition’ by the way) is pretty awkward. It comes many months after the flagship range of the same name and that’s a big problem.\nIn a nutshell, the issue is price drops.\nSamsung has launched the S24 FE with a starting price of £649 (or £699 to double storage to 256GB).\nThat might be cheaper than the base models in the iPhone 16 and Google Pixel 9 ranges – although not by much – but comparing it to Samsung’s own phones means there’s little reason to buy the latest FE.\nCheck out the best Black Friday deals on Samsung Galaxy devices .\nSamsung\nGet the regular S24 It doesn’t take long for tech to start receiving price cuts at major retailers – even if the price is still the same on official stores – and with the S24 range arriving back in January you can get a bargain now.\nHead over to Amazon and you can buy the excellent Galaxy S24 for as little as £510 at the time of writing. Or £659 in the 256GB capacity which is only just more than the cheapest S24 FE.\nHannah Cowton-Barnes / Foundry\nOr the similarly big screen S24+ Granted, the Galaxy S24 FE has a larger screen than the regular S24 at 6.7-inch compared to 6.2-inch as well as a bigger battery at 4700mAh.\nHowever, you can buy the Galaxy S24+ from Dealmonday for £649 if that suits you better.\nHannah Cowton-Barnes / Foundry\nHow about last year’s S23 FE Another alternative would be to buy last year’s Galaxy S23 FE, especially when you look at how much it costs now. Only £378 on Amazon at the time of writing.\nIt is worth noting that while not a whole lot has changed compared to its predecessor, the S24 FE gets the same seven-year software support as the other S24 phones which is a lot better than the four years of the S23 FE.\nHannah Cowton-Barnes / Foundry\nCan I tempt you with a Xiaomi? Another spanner in Samsung’s works is a phone Xiaomi announced less than two hours ago. The Xiaomi 14T Pro starts at the same £649 as the S24 FE but has some seriously impressive specs. And is available from Amazon for £599 .\nIt’s got a flagship-level Mediatek Dimensity 9300+ processor, an impressive 6.67-inch 144Hz OLED display, a potent Leica-branded triple camera system, and rapid 120/50W (wired/wireless) charging support.\nThere are downsides when comparing the software but if it’s high-end hardware you are after then it’s a solid option and you can read more in our full Xiaomi 14T Pro review.\nJon Mundy / Foundry\nIn the US? If you’re in the US, the Xiaomi 14T Pro isn’t an option. I don’t have US pricing for the S24 FE but if rumours are true then it will cost $650 or $710 for the 128- and 256GB options.\nIn that case, you could grab the S24 or S23 FE for $699 and $599 (256GB) respectively from Amazon.\nNew phones can be tempting but this is another off-beat release from Samsung that doesn’t make all that much sense.\nAuthor: Chris Martin , Reviews Editor, Tech Advisor Chris got his break as a reporter at infamous site The Inquirer and has been at Tech Advisor for more than 12 years.

    "text": "O Cruzeiro reformulou o elenco no ano passado e faturou com a venda de atletas. Nesta quarta-feira (23), o clube celeste divulgou o balanço financeiro de 2024, onde consta ter recebido R$ 39,3 milhões com a saída de cinco jogadores. Desses atletas, quatro renderam valores milionários aos cofres da Raposa.\nA mais cara das transferências foi a venda do atacante Arthur Gomes para o Dinamo Moscow-RUS por 3 milhões de euros, o equivalente a R$ 19,3 milhões. Outro que deixou Belo Horizonte rumo ao exterior foi o centroavante Rafael Elias, que acertou com o Kyoto Sanga-JAP por 1,2 milhões de dólares - cerca de R$ 7,43 milhões, à época.\nO valor é semelhante aos R$ 7,44 milhões que o Cruzeiro recebeu do Internacional pelo atacante Wesley. O negócio, inclusive, teve um desfecho positivo após o Colorado deixar de pagar parte das parcelas pelo jogador. Isso porque, neste ano, a Raposa abateu o restante da dívida com a contratação de Wanderson, que estava no Inter.\nJá o quarto atleta que rendeu quantia milionária ao Cruzeiro foi o atacante Bruno Rodrigues. O Tombense repassou à Raposa o equivalente a R$ 4,9 milhões, cerca de 768 mil euros, pela venda do jogador ao Palmeiras.\nAinda no documento, o Cruzeiro revela ter recebido R$ 150 mil pela transferência do lateral-direito Helibelton Palacios ao Sport. O defensor permaneceu emprestado para o clube de Recife por meia temporada. Em fevereiro deste ano, a diretoria cruzeirense acertou a saída do colombiano para o Millonarios-COL.\nVeja os valores das transferências do Cruzeiro em 2024\n- Arthur Gomes, Dinamo Moscow-RUS - R$ 19,3 milhões (3 milhões de euros)\n- Rafael Elias, Kyoto Sanga-JAP - R$ 7,43 milhões (1,2 milhões de dólares)\n- Wesley Ribeiro, Internacional - R$ 7,43 milhões\n- Bruno Rodrigues, Palmeiras - R$ 4,9 milhões (768 mil euros)\n- Helibelton Palacios, Sport - R$ 150 mil",

Players are killing it in‌ their​ ratings\n⁣ ⁢\n⁤ ‌ ⁢ Published on 11/20/2024 at 11:14\n‌ ‍ ⁤‌\nDepartment:\nJust yesterday, air⁣ simulation fans proudly tossed their tickets to paradise, eager to board Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 . ‍Unfortunately, the turbulence was almost immediate! Since its launch, some players have had a huge⁤ problem and they were based ⁢on the story. While Microsoft and Asobo are looking for a solution to this problem, players are attacking the title on Steam.\nMicrosoft Flight Simulator fails ‍to spread its wings In ‍August 2020, the license Flight simulator fly to⁢ other skies. After fourteen years of waiting, the franchise spread its wings again, carried by the masterpiece of the French​ studio Asobo.⁢ Crowned with an excellent critical reception from the press – the ⁢players, on the other hand, were‌ a little less enthusiastic – this famous return made Microsoft’s thoughts inevitable. ‌ Not surprisingly\nFor aerobatics and air travel enthusiasts, the appointment is made: they will be ready for take-off ⁣on ⁣November ‍19. However, the turbulence in⁣ the middle‍ of the crossing was only temporary Microsoft flight simulator 2024 to me they ‍stem .‍ On paper, all the conditions are met‌ for a ​smooth ride worthy of⁣ a business class service, but ​the title – available on Xbox Series X/S​ and PC, but also via Game⁤ Pass Ultimate‍ and PC ⁣Game Pass – has had major difficulties -. On the players’ side, the passengers, impatient to fly⁢ to seventh heaven, were quick to express their displeasure.\nLaunch that turns into an accident on the Steam platform Like in real life, this is the nightmare that ‌happened to many gamers / ⁣travelers. For some, the flight on board Microsoft flight simulator 2024 postponed due to a technical incident, and not the least. Loading times were what forced some players to stay on the tarmac. ​ unusually long ⁤», to repeat the message displayed on many screens . As a result, the ⁤title was simply unplayable, which failed to quell the frustration of players, stuck in⁢ front of a progress bar that stagnated at 97%. Quickly, the players spread the‌ word and ‍took their ⁤pens to express their difficulties on Steam.\nWe are aware of user reports of long initial ⁣load times in ⁢Microsoft⁢ Flight Simulator 2024.\nWith so many users starting the SIM at the same time, we have⁤ a large number of server requests.

After a difficult⁤ first day, conditions​ are now good ⁤for the ⁣title. ⁣This morning, the technical incident⁣ that⁤ caused heavy criticism of the game seems to have disappeared. Go to the skies!\nHow can developers effectively regain player trust after a disappointing ⁤game launch? Interview: The Flight Simulator Fumble – An In-Depth Look with Dr. Emily Cartwright, Gaming Technical Analyst\nEditor⁣ (Time.news): Welcome, Dr. Cartwright! Thank you for ​joining us today. As‌ you know, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 has faced a‌ rocky start with numerous‌ complaints from eager⁢ players. What’s your take on the situation?\nDr. Emily Cartwright: Thanks for having ⁤me! It’s disappointing to see a highly anticipated title like Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 run into such issues ⁢right at‍ launch. Players ⁢were‍ looking forward to an immersive experience, especially given the success of the previous iteration released in 2020. However, facing ⁢technical⁤ incidents that prevent players from ⁢even taking off is a serious​ problem.\nEditor: Indeed, loading times and performance problems seem to be ‍the main culprits. Can you explain why such‌ issues might be particularly prevalent in a flight simulation game compared‌ to other genres?\nDr. ⁤Cartwright: Flight simulators are incredibly complex ‍because they balance a vast array of variables—from realistic⁣ physics and weather‍ to multi-layered graphical ​data. The ⁢newer hardware can handle way more than ever, but⁢ if the software isn’t perfectly optimized, players experience lag, crashes, or excessively long load times. It can be like trying to run‌ a luxury jet on a‌ small plane’s engine!\nEditor: That’s ⁢a vivid analogy! Given the‍ franchise’s rich history and ‍the ⁤hype surrounding this ​release, how‍ do you think Microsoft and Asobo⁢ can⁤ recover ⁣from this setback to⁢ regain player trust?\nDr.‍ Cartwright: Transparency⁤ is ⁢key. They need ⁢to‍ acknowledge⁤ the issues⁤ publicly and provide regular updates on their progress toward a solution. This⁤ involves listening to player⁢ feedback actively. Launching patches​ and ‌updates promptly will also⁢ help to demonstrate their commitment ‍to improving the player experience. ‍It seems players are particularly ⁢vocal on platforms like Steam, which could be both a challenge and an opportunity for the ⁣developers.\nEditor: Given the mixed ⁣reception from players, do you‌ think this will impact the sales and future‍ developments of the franchise?\nDr. Cartwright: ⁢Absolutely. Negative reviews can greatly influence‍ potential buyers, especially when they’re vocalized on major​ platforms. If the issues are not resolved promptly, ⁢it can lead to a lasting stigma ⁢around the franchise, making ‍it hard ‍to attract new players for future expansions or sequels. Fans of⁤ the genre may turn to ‍alternate simulations that offer a smoother​ experience.\nEditor: The gaming community is known for being passionate and vocal. What advice would you give to players ⁤currently feeling frustrated with the‍ game?\nDr. Cartwright: My advice‍ would be to remain⁣ patient and stay informed. Issues like these are often addressed⁤ through community engagement. Besides,⁣ providing feedback ‌in a constructive manner‌ can help developers understand the specific pain points. Players should also explore forums or communities where they ⁣can share their experiences; often, discussing‌ issues can⁢ make ⁤it⁢ feel less isolating.\nEditor: Great perspective,⁢ Dr. Cartwright. As a final‍ thought, could you ‍predict where this rollercoaster of ‍a​ launch ​might lead⁤ us in the future of gaming simulation?\nDr. Cartwright: If ⁣handled correctly, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 ‌could emerge stronger than ​ever, ⁤becoming a case study in crisis management within the gaming industry. Developers‌ need to lean into technology—think AI and cloud computing—to enhance realism while managing performance. This situation⁣ could ultimately lead to better practices across the industry, ‌where titles⁣ are better ⁣tested beforehand, resulting in smoother launches in the future.\nEditor: Thank you for your insights, Dr. Cartwright! It seems ​that ‌while⁣ the flight ‍has encountered ‍some turbulence, there may yet ⁤be a chance for it to soar. We ‌appreciate your time today.\nDr. Cartwright: Thank you! I hope for a‌ smooth takeoff ​soon.",

According to the Colorado Springs Police Department, detectives with the department's Strategic Investigations Unit initiated an investigation into several known, violent criminals in Colorado Springs, all of which had connections to local gangs for firearm-related offenses. Through this investigation, detectives identified 22-year-old Ramon Garcia — an offender prohibited from owning a firearm to any degree due to a violent felony conviction, police said. Through investigative efforts, detectives learned Garcia had multiple firearms, had been providing firearms to juveniles, and carried a history of eluding law enforcement. On Wednesday, police followed Garcia to the 7700 block of Penway Heights. The department's Tactical Enforcement Unit contacted him after seeing him walk to his car alongside a 17-year-old juvenile. According to detectives, a handgun with a \"Glock switch,\" was discovered concealed on the body of the 17-year-old suspect. \"A Glock switch is an aftermarket device attached to a semi-automatic handgun, making the handgun capable of fully automatic fire,\" according to the department. Detectives later acquired a search warrant of Garcia's apartment where they discovered and seized an AR-style rifle and a 50-round drum-style handgun magazine. According to police, Garcia is facing charges of possession of a weapon by a previous offender, providing a handgun to a juvenile, and possessing a dangerous weapon, alongside additional firearm-related offenses. The juvenile offender, who will not be identified per Colorado state law, is also facing firearm-related charges.",
