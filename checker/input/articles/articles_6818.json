Es manifiesto que se alegran de destruir sus hogares, negocios; de matarlos y hacerlos desaparecer.\nEs imposible que alguien aún no sepa apreciar el genocidio que están cometiendo. No se alegran de destruir a un grupo terrorista, sino de hacer desaparecer a Gaza y a todo el pueblo palestino que lo habitaba.\nMe entristece enormemente lo que sucede y la incapacidad de intervenir. No parece que ni mil manifestaciones más servirían para que se tomen medidas reales y rápidas para detener lo que lleva meses aconteciendo. Es horrible.\nMe dan el mismo ascobque cuando los palestinis escupian al cadaver de aquella chica muerta por hamas y paseaban por Gaza",

    "title": "Bethlehem ‘without Christmas trees, without lights’ due to Israel-Hamas war | Gazette",
    "text": "Bethlehem, the normally bustling biblical birthplace of Jesus, resembles a ghost town this Christmas Eve, with celebrations called off due to the Israel-Hamas war. The festive lights and Christmas tree that normally decorate Manger Square are missing, as are the foreign tourists who gather each year to mark the holiday. Dozens of Palestinian security forces patrol the empty square. Gift shops have been slow to open on Christmas Eve, although a few did open their doors once the rain stopped pouring down. There are few visitors, however. Brother John Vinh, a Franciscan monk from Vietnam who has lived in Jerusalem for six years, said: “This year, without the Christmas tree and without lights, there’s just darkness.” He said he always comes to Bethlehem to mark Christmas, but this year was especially sobering, as he gazed at a nativity scene in Manger Square with a baby Jesus wrapped in a white shroud, symbolising the hundreds of children killed in the fighting in Gaza. Barbed wire surrounds the scene, with grey rubble added to the spectacle reflecting none of the lights and bursts of colour that normally fill the square during the Christmas season. Ala’a Salameh, one of the owners of Afteem Restaurant, a family-owned falafel restaurant just steps from the square, said: “We can’t justify putting out a tree and celebrating as normal, when some people (in Gaza) don’t even have houses to go to.” Mr Salameh said Christmas Eve is usually the busiest day of the year. “Normally, you can’t find a single chair to sit, we’re full from morning till midnight,” he said. This year, just one table was taken – by journalists sheltering from the rain. He said his restaurant was operating at about 15% of normal business and was not able to cover operating costs. Mr Salameh estimated that even after the war ends, it will take another year for tourism to return to Bethlehem as normal. The cancellation of Christmas festivities is a severe blow to the town’s economy. Tourism accounts for an estimated 70% of Bethlehem’s income – almost all of that during the Christmas season. With many major airlines cancelling flights to Israel, few foreigners are visiting. Local officials say around 70 hotels in Bethlehem have been forced to close, leaving thousands of people unemployed. Under a banner that read “Bethlehem’s Christmas bells ring for a cease-fire in Gaza,” a few teenagers offered small inflatable Santa figures, but no one was buying. Instead of their traditional musical march through the streets of Bethlehem, young scouts stood silently with flags. A group of local students unfurled a massive Palestinian flag as they stood in silence. Bethlehem’s mayor, Hana Haniyeh, said in an address: “Our message every year on Christmas is one of peace and love, but this year it’s a message of sadness, grief and anger in front of the international community with what is happening and going on in the Gaza Strip.” Dr Joseph Mugasa, a paediatrician, was one of the few international visitors. He said his tour group of 15 people from Tanzania was “determined” to come to the region despite the situation. “I’ve been here several times, and it’s quite a unique Christmas, as usually there’s a lot of people and a lot of celebrations,” he said. “But you can’t celebrate while people are suffering, so we are sad for them and praying for peace.” More than 20,000 Palestinians have been killed and more than 50,000 wounded during Israel’s air and ground offensive against Gaza’s Hamas rulers, according to health officials there, while some 85% of the territory’s 2.3 million residents have been displaced. The war was triggered by Hamas’ deadly assault October 7 on southern Israel in which militants killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took more than 240 hostages. The fighting in Gaza has also affected life in the West Bank. Since October 7, access to Bethlehem and other Palestinian towns in the Israeli-occupied territory has been difficult, with long lines of motorists waiting to pass military checkpoints. The restrictions have also prevented tens of thousands of Palestinians from exiting the territory to work in Israel.

But the picture is unrelated to the Israel-Hamas war; an AFP photographer captured it in 2018 after a suspected Syrian chemical attack near Damascus.\n\"She was holding her sister's oxygen mask inside the ambulance. She had already passed away, yet her hand remained on the mask firmly,\" says text over the image . \"She took her last Breath while taking care of her sister.\"\nThe same picture and text rocketed across X , formerly Twitter, and platforms such as Instagram in late December 2023 -- nearly three months into Israel's war with Hamas.\n\"We will Never forget. We will NEVER stop sharing. FREE PALESTINE !!\" says a December 26 post on X.\nScreenshot from X taken December 28, 2023 Similar posts have spread across social media since the start of the conflict, including in Spanish .\nIsrael's bombardment and ground offensive in Gaza have killed more than 21,320 people -- mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.\nThe military operation began after fighters associated with the Palestinian Islamist movement attacked Israel on October 7, taking some 250 hostages and killing around 1,140 people -- also mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.\nBut the photo of the child holding an oxygen mask up to an infant is unrelated to the war in Gaza.\nPhotographer Hasan Mohamed captured the photo for AFP on January 22, 2018 in Syria, reverse image searches show .\nThe picture depicts the girl and baby in a makeshift hospital after a reported chemical weapons attack in Douma, Syria, according to its caption.\nA Syrian girl holds an oxygen mask over the face of an infant at a make-shift hospital following a reported gas attack on the rebel-held town of Douma in the eastern Ghouta region on the outskirts of the capital Damascus on January 22, 2018 Hasan Mohammed AFP\nAt least 21 people suffered breathing difficulties after the attack, AFP reported at the time.\nThe original photo also shows a second child -- a boy in a striped, yellow shirt -- beside the girl, who is wearing pink. Other AFP shots show the boy and other victims of the attack.\nA Syrian boy holds an oxygen mask over the face of an infant at a make-shift hospital following a reported gas attack on the rebel-held town of Douma in the eastern Ghouta region on the outskirts of the capital Damascus on January 22, 2018 Hasan Mohammed AFP Syrian men wear oxygen masks at a make-shift hospital following a reported gas attack on the rebel-held town of Douma in the eastern Ghouta region on the outskirts of the capital Damascus on January 22, 2018 Hasan Mohammed AFP\nThe children also appear in AFP footage from the scene.\nThe civil war in Syria erupted in 2011 after President Bashar al-Assad's crackdown on pro-democracy protests.\nThe ongoing conflict has killed more than 500,000 people, reduced cities to rubble and displaced half of Syria's pre-war population -- while also roping in foreign countries and global jihadists.\nDuring this time, Israel has also launched hundreds of air strikes on targets in Syria, primarily against Iran-backed forces and Hezbollah fighters as well as Syrian army positions. Israel rarely comments on strikes targeting Syria, but it has repeatedly said it will not allow Iran to expand its presence in the country.\nAFP has debunked other misinformation about the Israel-Hamas war, including misrepresented visuals from Syria, here .\nView comments",

    "title": "Flexible Work Company ‘LAUFT’ Discusses Expansion Plans and New Government Collaboration [Interview]",
    "text": "As workplaces in Canada have been reshaping from in-office to hybrid and remote environments,\nLAUFT, known for its flexible on-demand offices, has announced ambitious expansion plans, including a contract with the federal government of Canada.\nCurrently located in the Greater Toronto Area, LAUFT offers convenient and compact workspaces equipped with spaces to meet the needs from solo entrepreneurs to large corporations who are looking for flexible workplace solutions.\n“Really what we are looking at doing and really what we want, is to build the Starbucks of workspaces with an Uber-like experience”, shares\nGraham Wong, Founder and CEO of LAUFT. “In this evolving landscape, LAUFT is not just creating spaces; it is crafting experiences catering to the modern professional’s need for flexibility, innovation, and a work-life balance. As LAUFT expands its footprint, it brings us one step closer to a future where workplaces are as dynamic and diverse as the people who use them, offering a glimpse into a world where our environments are tailored not just for our tasks – but for our lifestyles.”\nCurrently the company has six locations including Vaughan, Burlington, Ajax, Castlefield, Dufferin, Don Mills, and King at Church in downtown Toronto. The company is planning to expand in the GTA and beyond, with a future site planned for Ottawa with a potential location in Oakville.\nThe space in Ottawa will be a pilot program aiming to introduce its flexible workplace environments to federal agencies, offering government employees a new way to work. Beyond these plans, LAUFT will be exploring opportunities throughout Canada and eventually will take its concept globally. The location in Oakville has not been confirmed, but Wong says he is hoping to open a space there for around September.\n“We are expanding and have a pipeline of more locations that extend all the way outside of the GTA in the commuter areas. We are also expanding into Ottawa where we won a contract with the federal government of Canada. We will be taking the LAUFT concept there as a pilot for their federal agencies and workers. From there, the vision extends across Canada. We see the value and demand for our model in providing flexible workspaces that cater to not just individual freelancers, but also to large organizations looking for adaptable solutions for their teams.”\nSpecialized spaces for events\nLAUFT will be expanding its King and Church location in Toronto and the additional space designed for meeting areas, workshops, professional and social gatherings, and provide parties.\n“We are expanding into the West unit, transforming it into a street-level space. This is about more than just providing space; it is about creating an experience that blends seamlessly with our vision of work and life.”\nThe new event space is scheduled to open in early May and Wong says it has the potential to be a landmark destination for professional and social events in downtown Toronto.\n“We need to look at space, and we need to figure out what people need. And what we saw and identified in the downtown core was an opportunity for event spaces. This is really just about how you can entertain and host larger groups in a space that is highly customizable, but very convenient and very accessible in the downtown core.Maybe it is for a book club, a wedding party, or maybe a sporting event. That hasn’t existed in a very on demand way and this is what we are bringing into the market.”\nThe new event space will be a test before expanding the concept to other locations.\nBlending travel and work\nLAUFT is aiming to be the “Starbucks of workspaces,” and would like to take the concept into airports, hotels, and globally.\nWong says he is exploring innovative venues that are not traditional office settings such as integrating flexible workspaces in airports and hotels. These locations will allow LAUFT to reach travelling professionals to work efficiently and comfortably while on the move.\n“Imagine having LAUFT in airports or travel hubs where between flights, professionals can catch up on work in a conducive environment, or hotels offering dedicated workspaces allowing guests to seamlessly blend travel and work. This vision represents a significant opportunity for LAUFT to embed itself into the fabric of the global business ecosystem.”\nWong also has plans to expand LAUFT internationally, such as in the US and Europe, but before this, he wants to establish a foundation in Canada. LAUFT is working with\nNick Iozzo from Savills Canada for their real estate search expansion needs.\nFuture plans\nAs the business is expanding its offerings into the Nation’s capital, Wong shared what’s to come for LAUFT.\n“The next step would likely be in Quebec and then we would love to go across Canada and then look into the US as that would probably be our second market.\nWong also said LAUFT is planning to bring back its loyalty program to enhance the user experience and foster a deeper sense of community. Wong says the company is working on rebuilding the loyalty program for guests, but is unsure when it will be available. The loyalty program Wong says is a great way to support local businesses, as it could possibly offer discounts to businesses around them such as cafes, restaurants, and retailers.\nCurrently, LAUFT already supports and promotes local businesses as it integrates local vendors and services into its workplaces, this loyalty program Wong says could be another way to interact with the community.\n“Our aim with revitalizing the loyalty program is not just about rewarding our users; it is about creating a thriving ecosystem where everyone benefits. By potentially offering discounts and special offers from nearby cafes, restaurants, and retailers, we are not only adding value for our members, but also driving meaningful support to local businesses. It is a tangible expression of our commitment to the communities we are part of and a reflection of our belief that when local businesses flourish, we all flourish.”",

Companies are looking at how to remove mainly CO2 from the air and water. The companies want to make it profitable. Currently, the cost per captured ton of CO2 is prohibitive. To invent cheaper solutions, universities are coming to the rescue, where academics are looking to mimic natural processes and use commonly found materials that have high adsorbent CO2 properties.\nNew Ways To Sequester Carbon Despite Retreat From Climate Change Action\nCarbon capture is an offshoot of the energy industry and manufacturing. Rapid decarbonization has produced many potential business models but the cost per ton of captured CO2 remains prohibitive. Researchers at Stanford and Ben Gurion Universities, however, have each come up with low-cost CCS solutions that emulate and accelerate natural weathering processes.\nGet Published - Build a Following\nThe Energy Central Power Industry Network® is based on one core idea - power industry professionals helping each other and advancing the industry by sharing and learning from each other.\nIf you have an experience or insight to share or have learned something from a conference or seminar, your peers and colleagues on Energy Central want to hear about it.
