    "title": "Jaylen Waddle dons Michigan gear after losing Rose Bowl bet with Dolphins CEO",
    "text": "There’s been a fair share of NFL players who paid up for miscellaneous wagers on college football during the regular season. For Dolphins wide receiver Jaylen Waddle , he made one with his team president — and it meant he had to wear Michigan gear during Friday’s media availability. Waddle wore a UM hat and sweatshirt while meeting with reporters yesterday after Monday’s Rose Bowl, which his Alabama Crimson Tide lost in overtime to Tom Garfinkel’s Michigan Wolverines. Waddle starred at Alabama before the Dolphins drafted him No. 6 overall in the 2021 NFL Draft , helping lead the Crimson Tide to a national championship in 2020. This year, though, Alabama fell short, and Waddle paid the price . Waddle is the latest high-profile athlete to publicly wear a rival school’s gear during a media session. San Francisco 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy — an Iowa State alum — had to wear Iowa gear after the CyHawk game . Then, Detroit Lions wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown wore a Leprechaun outfit after his USC Trojans fell to Notre Dame this season. It’s all part of the good fun in the NFL. For Waddle, though, the media session was important as his status for Sunday’s game against the Buffalo Bills becomes clearer. He has been dealing with an ankle injury and is questionable for the matchup. However, he told reporters “there’s always a chance” he plays. NFL Network: Jaylen Waddle expected back for playoffs after high ankle sprain Waddle has been an important part of the Dolphins’ passing game this year, ranking second on the team with 1,014 yards and four touchdowns. Miami holds the No. 2 seed in the AFC playoff picture as part of an impressive regular season. Waddle is officially questionable for Sunday’s game against the Bills, according to the Dolphins’ injury report. He suffered a high ankle sprain against the Baltimore Ravens last week, putting his status in question. Immediately afterward, though, NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport indicated the former Alabama star could find a way to play against the Bills. “He’s dealing with a high-ankle sprain, didn’t practice this week,” Rapoport reported on Sunday . “Not considered to be a severe one but could keep him out next week as well. My understanding is that Waddle, who is a quick healer, is expected back for the playoffs. “Remember a couple of years ago, he played in the National Championship when people were saying he shouldn’t, he heals quick, he wants to be on the field, that’s what I would expect in the playoffs.”",

    "text": "Lo hemos comentado en otras ocasiones que Microsoft está en un momento clave de la historia de su departamento de videojuegos y que tiene que explicar a sus usuarios cuál es el camino que va a coger. Si lo va a confiar todo a Xbox Game Pass sin importar que se vendan consolas o no porque su servicio puede utilizarse en cualquier lugar, o si será fiel al espíritu del mercado de las consolas y continuará lanzando nuevas en cada generación. Y cada vez estamos más cerca de conocer la respuesta.\nY esto es así porque en las últimas horas, Microsoft ha iniciado una campaña de publicidad que es, cuando menos, confusa, o al menos intenta demostrar que estamos ante el ecosistema de juego más versátil que existe, que podemos disfrutar en cualquier parte de él y sin las limitaciones tradicionales de una máquina anclada a la televisión del salón, como le ocurre a Sony con su actual PS5. O así, al menos, lo está entendiendo todo el mundo.\n¿Microsoft sabe lo que es una Xbox?\nEsa es la pregunta que todos nos hemos hecho tras ver la campaña de publicidad que ha puesto en marcha al más puro estilo noventero. Es decir, con páginas de publicidad de las que se insertaban en los medios impresos de la época y que son un fiel reflejo de las intenciones que vienen arrastrando los de Phil Spencer desde hace años. Y el resumen más sencillo que podemos hacer es que cualquier aparato con pantalla y conexión a internet puede ser una Xbox.\nEn un mensaje que publicó en sus redes sociales Geoff Keighley, el responsable de The Game Awards, se puede ver detenidamente todo el listado de aparatos que Microsoft considera que son una Xbox gracias a que pueden, o bien ejecutar juegos de forma nativa, o bien conectarse a la aplicación de Xbox Game Pass para disfrutar en streaming de muchos de los juegos del catálogo. Así que empezad a contar…\nGeoff Keighley@geoffkeighleyXbox has announced its new ad campaign «THIS IS AN XBOX.» https://t.co/UZVEesy7Xm14 de noviembre, 2024 • 16:04\n8.9K\n540\nPara Microsoft, no solo Xbox Series X|S son una Xbox como tal, sino también nuestro portátil, nuestro smartphone, nuestra handheld PC (en este caso aparece una Asus ROG Ally X), unas Meta Quest 3, una Smart TV o un Fire TV Stick de Amazon. Por lo que desde hoy, todos estos lugares en los que podemos jugar toman carta de naturaleza como sucursales de Xbox, y por tanto así podemos tratarlos.\n¿Microsoft ya no quiere vender consolas?\nCon esta campaña queda bien a la claras que, a partir de hoy oficialmente, a Microsoft le importa un bledo vender pocas Xbox Series X|S y da igual si PS5 duplica o triplica su parque porque su guerra está en otro sitio, porque el core de su negocio ya no es el hardware, sino más bien el software: Xbox Game Pass con sus casi 500 juegos y todos los estudios que han comprado para exprimir también a los usuarios de PlayStation.\nCon decisiones así, uno acaba pensando si existirá una nueva consola Xbox en la siguiente generación. ¿De verdad que Microsoft necesita una después de ver esta publicidad?",

    "title": "What rug pull scams are and how to avoid them",
    "text": "In November 2024, a 12-year old trader made headlines after attempting a crypto [rug pull](/learn/crypto-promotional-scams) on a [memecoin](/learn/solana-memecoins-utility) he created, called Gen Z Quant (QUANT), during a live stream.\nThe trader launched QUANT on the popular Solana-based platform [Pump.fun](/learn/what-is-pump-fun-how-to-create-memecoin). The token quickly gained traction as its price surged. During a live stream, the trader expressed surprise at the growth before dumping his holdings — 51 million QUANT tokens — for 128 Solana (SOL), equivalent to $30,000.Despite his attempts to exit the market, the crypto community rallied behind the token, pushing its price up by an astonishing 77,000%. QUANT briefly reached a market cap of $82.3 million, peaking at $0.08 before retracing to $50 million. Ironically, the trader’s holdings would have been worth $4 million had he not sold them prematurely.\nThe incident sparked mixed reactions from the crypto community. Some thought the community’s actions were a kind of poetic justice for rug pullers, while others criticized the situation. They wondered how traders let a child trick them.\nIn any case, rug pulls are harmful to the crypto community, and create fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD). In this article, we’ll explore rug pulls in detail and detail how to keep your digital assets safe.\nTL;DR\nRug pulls happen when crypto project creators cash out and abandon the project, leaving traders with worthless tokens.\nRed flags of potential rug pulls include anonymous developers, lack of transparency or a clear roadmap, unrealistic returns, and poor liquidity.\nYou can research development teams, analyze tokenomics, verify audits, and use reputable platforms to protect yourself.\nScammers trap traders using pump-and-dump schemes, exit scams, and liquidity scams. They also often manipulate contracts to restrict selling.\nUse rug pull detection tools like TokenSniffer, Honeypot, and RugDoc to analyze token contracts, assess risks, and avoid scams.\nWhat is a rug pull?\nA rug pull is a deceptive maneuver where developers of a cryptocurrency project abruptly withdraw their support and funds, leaving traders with worthless tokens. Developers launch a new cryptocurrency or [decentralized finance (DeFi) project](/learn/defi-explained), often accompanied by aggressive marketing to attract traders. They establish a liquidity pool on [decentralized exchanges (DEXs)](/learn/best-decentralized-exchanges) like [Uniswap](/learn/what-is-uniswap), Pump.fun or PancakeSwap, allowing traders to acquire the new token.\nEnticed by promises of high rewards, traders purchased the token, increasing its value and liquidity. Once a substantial amount of money is pooled, the developers withdraw all funds, causing the token’s value to plummet and leaving traders with significant losses.\nRug pull examples\nOneCoin: Launched in 2014, OneCoin was promoted as a revolutionary cryptocurrency. However, the \"blockchain\" OneCoin was on was nothing more than an Excel sheet. It turned out to be a Ponzi scam, resulting in participants losing over $4 billion.\nSquid Game Token: In 2021, capitalizing on the popular Netflix series, developers introduced the Squid Game Token. The token’s value skyrocketed, but traders soon found they couldn’t sell their holdings. Eventually, the developers vanished with approximately $3.3 million, leaving participants empty-handed.\nRecognizing red flags\nAnonymous developers: Projects with unknown or unverified team members can be risky.\nLack of transparency: Absence of clear information about the project’s goals, roadmap, or tokenomics.\nUnrealistic returns: Promises of guaranteed high returns in a short period should be approached with skepticism.\nNo external audits: Reputable projects often undergo third-party audits to ensure security and legitimacy.\nUnderstanding and spotting rug pulls can help keep your crypto safe from scammers.\nHow does a rug pull work?\nRug pulls can manifest in various ways, primarily through pump-and-dump schemes, exit scams, and liquidity scams.\nPump-and-dump schemes\nScammers artificially inflate the token’s price through coordinated buying and spreading positive news. The surge in price creates a [fear of missing out (FOMO)](/learn/what-is-fomo) among traders, leading them to buy in at elevated prices. Scammers sell their holdings when the price peaks, crashing the price and causing new traders to lose money.\nExit scams\nDevelopers launch a seemingly legitimate project, often with a detailed roadmap and whitepaper. They raise funds through token sales or Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). After collecting substantial funds, the developers abandon the project and disappear with their own gains, leaving users stranded.\nLiquidity scams\nScammers create a new token and pair it with a base cryptocurrency like [Ethereum (ETH)](/price/ethereum-eth) on a DEX. They establish a liquidity pool, allowing individuals to trade the new token. Through aggressive marketing, they lure traders to buy the token, increasing its value and liquidity. Once sufficient funds are built up, the developers withdraw all liquidity, causing the token’s value to plummet and leaving traders with worthless assets.\nDEXs platforms allow you to trade tokens without intermediaries. While this promotes freedom, it also enables scammers to list fraudulent tokens easily. That's why it’s important to [do your own research](/learn/dyor) before trading on DEXs.\n[Smart contracts](/learn/what-are-smart-contracts) with the terms directly written into code can be manipulated by malicious developers. For example, they might include functions that prevent traders from selling the token, trapping their funds. This is also known as a [honeypot scam](/learn/crypto-investment-withdrawal-scams).\nWhat are the red flags of a potential rug pull?\nIt’s important to be aware of the red flags when it comes to rug pulls. Not only will this spare you the stress of having to deal with losing your tokens, it can also make you a better trader.\nAnonymous developers\nProjects led by unidentified or pseudonymous teams can be risky. Transparency about the team’s identity and experience builds trust. For instance, the Squid Game token scam involved anonymous developers who vanished with traders’ money.\nLack of a clear roadmap\nLegitimate projects provide a detailed plan outlining their goals and development stages. The absence of a roadmap or unclear goals can be a red flag. A clear roadmap typically indicates a project’s commitment to long-term success.\nUnrealistic returns\nBe careful of promises of high or guaranteed returns. Scammers often lure traders with the prospect of quick gains. Remember, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.\nPoor liquidity\nLow liquidity means difficulty in buying or selling tokens without affecting their price. Scammers may create tokens with limited liquidity to control the market and execute a rug pull. Always check the liquidity pool of a token before committing funds.\nNo external audit\nReputable projects undergo third-party audits to validate the security and integrity of their code. The absence of an audit or reliance on an unknown auditor can be a red flag. An audit provides an extra layer of security for participants.\nSuspicious tokenomics\nPay attention to the token distribution. If developers hold a significant portion of the tokens, they could dump them, causing the price to plummet. Balanced tokenomics are essential for a project’s stability.\nMarketing hype with low substance\nExcessive marketing without a working product or clear utility can be a warning sign. Scammers often use hype to quickly attract traders. Look for projects that focus on development and community engagement over flashy promotions.\nHow to protect yourself from a rug pull\nKeep these steps in mind to protect yourself from rug pulls.\nConduct thorough research\nInvestigate the team: Make sure the project’s developers are transparent about their identities and have credible backgrounds. Anonymous teams can be a red flag.\nAnalyze the whitepaper: A comprehensive\n[whitepaper](/learn/what-is-bitcoin-white-paper)should clearly outline the project’s goals, technology, and roadmap. Vague or poorly written documents may indicate a lack of substance.\nExamine tokenomics\nDistribution: Assess how tokens are allocated. If a small group holds a large percentage, they could potentially control the market.\nLiquidity: Check the liquidity pool. Low liquidity can make it difficult to sell tokens and may be a tactic used in rug pulls.\nVerify external audits\nProjects should undergo third-party audits to ensure the security of their code. The absence of an audit or reliance on an unknown auditor can be worrying.\nUse trusted platforms\nEngage with well-established exchanges and platforms known for their security measures. These platforms often have vetting processes that can help filter out fraudulent projects.\nBe wary of unrealistic promises\nIf a project guarantees high returns with minimal risk, approach it with caution. Such promises are often used to lure unsuspecting traders.\nCheck out the community engagement\nActive and transparent communication from the development team is a positive sign. Engage with the community to measure the project’s legitimacy.\nStart small\nWhen exploring new projects, consider starting small with your initial commitment of funds. This approach limits potential losses if the project turns out to be fraudulent.\nWhat are some tools to detect rug pulls?\nBesides spotting red flags, there are [rug pull detection tools](/learn/how-scam-detection-tools-protect-crypto) you can use. These tools help analyze token contracts, assess risks, and provide insights that protect you from scams.\nTokenSniffer\nThis tool lets you quickly and easily check smart contracts. Enter a token’s contract address and get a detailed analysis. It spots suspicious code patterns, similarities to known scams, and issues like locked liquidity or excessive token ownership. This helps traders to know the risks before getting involved in a project.\nHoneypot.is\nScammers sometimes create tokens that you can buy but can’t sell, known as honeypots. Honeypot.is tests smart contracts by simulating buy-and-sell transactions to make sure there are no hidden restrictions. This tool is handy for spotting projects designed to trap your tokens.\nRugDoc\nRugDoc reviews crypto projects, giving risk ratings. It offers tools like a Honeypot Checker and educational guides to help you understand scams and make informed decisions.\nDe.Fi Scanner\nThe De.Fi Scanner is a multi-chain tool that scans smart contracts for risks. It provides a security score so traders can evaluate project risks.\nThe final word\nRug pulls are one of the most harmful scams in the crypto world, leaving traders with worthless tokens and significant losses. These scams exploit the nature of [DEX platforms](/learn/best-decentralized-exchanges), letting malicious developers make fake tokens, inflate their value, and take the money.\nTo protect yourself, watch for red flags like anonymous developers, unrealistic promises, lack of audits, and poor liquidity. Remember to do your research, check the project's tokenomics, and verify its credibility. And, always do due diligence before adding a new token to your [wallet.](/web3)\nFAQs\nA rug pull is when crypto developers attract participants to a project to inflate the project token's price, before selling their own holdings and abandoning the project, leaving users with worthless tokens.\nWatch out for red flags such as anonymous developers, unclear roadmaps, unrealistic promises of returns, and no external audits.\nTokenSniffer, Honeypot.is, and RugDoc analyze token contracts and risks. They help you assess a project’s legitimacy.\nResearch thoroughly, check audits, and verify tokenomics. Use trusted platforms and start with a small commitment of funds when exploring new projects.\n[www.okx.com](/).\n© 2024 OKX.

    "text": "In a three-month span filled with widespread layoffs and billions spent on AI, Microsoft made more than $27 billion.\nThe tech giant released financial results for its fourth fiscal quarter, which ran from May through the end of June, on Wednesday and exceeded Wall Street estimates. Microsoft reported $76.4 billion in revenue with $27.2 billion in profit, both metrics showing their highest year-over-year growth in over two years.\nThe company chalked up its superb growth to demand for artificial intelligence and cloud computing services.\nCloud and AI is the driving force of business transformation across every industry and sector,\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a news release Wednesday.\nFor the first time Microsoft also broke out revenue for its cloud platform, Azure. Microsoft previously grouped the revenue with other products and services like Microsoft 365, which diluted comparisons with its rivals Amazon and Google parent company Alphabet.\nNadella said Azure surpassed $75 billion in revenue during the fiscal year, which ended on June 30. Amazon Web Services, Azure's biggest rival, is projected to reach over $111 billion in revenue this year, Amazon said in March.\nMicrosoft's financial results come a week after Nadella addressed the company's layoffs amid a consistent run of record quarterly revenues and profits. Nadella acknowledged the \"uncertainty and seeming incongruence of the company's job cuts.\nDuring the quarter, the company laid off more than 6,300 employees. Microsoft laid off another 9,000 in early July, days after its new fiscal year began.\nMicrosoft's stock rose by 7.5% in after-hours trading.",

Wade leaves behind his 5 children and 11 grandchildren; son, Jason Dotson (Paula) who reside in New Smyrna, Florida, son, Jeremy who resides in Daytona Beach, FL with 4 sons (Ethan, Jackson, Jase, and Elijah) and daughter, Abigail, son, Joshua, who lives on a sailboat in St. Augustine, Fl with his dog, Lady, daughter, Lindsay Sandy (Chad) who reside in Charlotte, NC with their daughter, Gracelynn, and son, Hunter, and daughter, Meredith (Mara) Burge who reside in Quiet Dell, WV, with their daughters, Madyson, Savannah, and Kate, and son, Carter. Wade was an avid skier and boating enthusiast. The family boated at Tygart Lake, Annapolis MD, and Florida. They skied most Sundays for many years at Snowshoe, Silver Creek, Canaan Valley, Timberline, Wisp, and 7 Springs. They also traveled \"out west\" visiting various locations with favorites being Aspen, Vail, and Beaver Creek. Wade and Nancy loved to travel, and their children have many fond memories of all the family adventures they shared together. The family also enjoyed spending time in Jupiter, Florida where Wade and Nancy resided part-time in addition to Bridgeport. Wade had a way of making people laugh. He could strike a conversation with anyone and could bring a smile even on the darkest of days. He will be missed deeply by so many. In lieu of flowers, Wade requested that donations be made to Bridgeport United Methodist Church, 251 Worthington Drive, Bridgeport. The family has entrusted the arrangements to the Ford Funeral Home, Allen Chapel, 215 East Main Street, Bridgeport. In accordance with Wade's wishes, cremation services will occur. Friends will be received at the Bridgeport United Methodist Church on Saturday, March 29, 2025 from 10 am until 12 Noon. A celebration of life service will be held in the church on Saturday at 12 Noon with Reverend Dr. Matthew Paugh and Reverend Dr. Dan Kimble officiating.
