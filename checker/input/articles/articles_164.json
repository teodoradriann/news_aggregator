    "text": "Defence Minister Guido Crosetto stressed the need for the Italian Army to adapt to a changing world as the armed force celebrated its 163rd anniversary with a ceremony in Rome on Friday. \"The challenge of change is the most difficult one,\" said Crosetto. \"The world has changed, the army must adapt. \"It is difficult to adapt, but this challenge does not only concern the defence (sector), but also parliament and all of the institutions, and industry too. \"The scenarios, the technology, industry and the way in which industry collaborates with the armed forces have changed. \"Before there was no rush, now there is no time to wait. \"The time-frames are not dictated by our habits but by the needs that arise. \"These are profound changes that affect everyone. \"We thought that war had disappeared, but over the last two years war has returned to our home\" Premier Giorgia Meloni was among the officials attending the ceremony for the anniversary at the 'Gen. C.A. Pietro Giannattasio' military hippodrome in Rome's Tor di Quinto district. (see related). ALL RIGHTS RESERVED © Copyright ANSA",

    "text": "Event Highlights Joint Venture’s Role in Global Adoption of HPDI™ Fuel System,\nAdvancing Commercial Transportation to Smarter, Cleaner Power with IC Engines\nVANCOUVER, British Columbia, July 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Volvo Group (“Volvo”) and Westport Fuel Systems Inc. (\"Westport\" or the “Company”) (TSX: WPRT / Nasdaq: WPRT ) today marked a defining moment in the journey of the newly formed joint venture (JV) as the two companies celebrated the official launch of their partnership with an exclusive event at the University of British Columbia, the birthplace of Westport's HPDI™ fuel system technology.\nNurtured for nearly 30 years within Westport, the two partners are coming together to jointly promote, develop and further accelerate the commercialization of the HPDI technology. In doing so, the JV will resolutely focus on moving forward affordable, sustainable transportation solutions using the internal combustion engine operating on renewable fuels now and hydrogen in the future.\n“This joint venture is poised to make a significant impact on global long-haul and off-road heavy-duty applications,” said Dan Sceli, Chief Executive Officer and Director of Westport Fuel Systems, and interim President of the Volvo/Westport JV. “By combining Volvo’s extensive expertise in commercial vehicle and power system manufacturing with Westport’s innovative fuel system technology, we are creating a powerful force for change that can make a meaningful contribution to reduce carbon emissions immediately and affordably. Together we are committed to delivering sustainable, efficient, and economically viable solutions for long-haul transportation.”\nPartnership is the New Leadership\nLeaders from both companies joined-in on the celebration of this milestone, emphasizing the significance of the partnership in driving forward HPDI’s breakthrough technology in tackling the urgent challenges of climate change.\n“Today is a day of celebration as we join together to collectively advance this critically important clean transportation initiative,” said Lars Stenqvist, Chief Technology Officer of Volvo Group. “We believe HPDI-powered internal combustion engines, running on hydrogen and renewable fuels, play a crucial role in global decarbonization efforts in commercial transportation. The joint venture enables us to combine this innovative fuel system with our strategic expertise to guide OEMs and fleets as they navigate the energy transition.”\n“This is a momentous occasion for Westport and the HPDI technology. The alliance between our two companies affirms our steadfast commitment to drive decarbonization in the heavy-duty sector utilizing alternative fuels while still providing the efficiency, power and durability that comes with diesel cycle engines,” said Scott Baker, Vice President, Product Development and Technology Officer of the Volvo/Westport JV.\nBaker continued, “Together, we will provide unparalleled expertise and counsel to customers around the globe on optimizing their existing CO 2 reduction strategies, ultimately paving the way for a more sustainable future in heavy-duty transportation.”\nCollaboration with transportation partners and end-users has led to the deployment of the HPDI system in thousands of Volvo trucks across Europe, underscoring its effectiveness in achieving carbon neutrality. Since the commercial release of HPDI in 2018, fleets have collectively avoided hundreds of thousands of tons of CO 2 emissions annually. This success demonstrates the immediate impact of integrating hydrogen and biogas technologies into existing infrastructure.\nAt the heart of the HPDI ™ Fuel System is a revolutionary patented injector with a dual concentric needle design that delivers small quantities of diesel fuel and large quantities of natural gas, at high pressure, to the combustion chamber. The natural gas is injected at the end of the compression stroke. Launched in 2024, the Volvo FH Aero gas-powered is a long-haul truck shaped for aerodynamic efficiency.\nIMAGE: VOLVO TRUCKS\nAbout Westport Fuel Systems\nAt Westport, we are driving innovation to power a cleaner tomorrow.

    "text": "Monrovia – As part of its ongoing 30th anniversary celebrations, AME University demonstrated its unwavering commitment to community care with a heartfelt visit to the Liberia-Japanese Maternity Center at JFK Hospital.\nBy Emmanuel Weedee-Conway\nDuring the visit, the university distributed essential maternal and newborn health materials to mothers who had recently given birth.\nAME University President, Reverend Dr. Alvin Attah, expressed the institution’s dedication to fostering compassion and support, stating, “In the spirit of our anniversary, we have come to present these items to you, the mothers and babies here at the maternity center.”\nThe gesture was met with gratitude, as Maternity Center Administrator Davidetta Parker-Sirleaf lauded AMEU for its goodwill, affirming the significant impact this act of kindness will have on patients and staff alike.\nThe celebration extended further when AMEU stepped in to relieve the burden of medical bills for 24 patients who had been discharged but unable to leave the facility due to financial constraints.\nPartnering with JFK Hospital, the university pledged to cover 30% of over one million Liberian dollars in bills, enabling these patients, some of whom had been stranded since April, to finally reunite with their families.\nDr. Attah described this act of generosity as a pivotal moment in the university’s anniversary celebrations, adding, “We are pleased to make this contribution to help you go home with smiles on your faces as you reunite with your families and communities.”\nThis milestone reinforces AMEU’s legacy of service and compassion, emphasizing the university’s role as a pillar of hope and support in the Liberian community.",

    "title": "BYD Shark 6 ute's newest triumph: Plug-in hybrid ute receives a five-star safety score after impressive results in crash tests to match key rivals the Ford Ranger, Toyota HiLux and Mitsubishi Triton",
    "text": "The BYD Shark 6 dual-cab ute is a five-star car, according to the Australasian New Car Assessment program (ANCAP).\nThe plug-in hybrid workhorse performed strongly in physical crash tests and has plenty of active driver aids and its maximum five-star rating matches its more established, and top selling, rivals.\nIt received a solid 85 per cent score for adult occupant protection, which is better than the Ford Ranger (84 per cent) but lower than the Mitsubishi Triton (86 per cent) and Toyota HiLux (96 per cent).\nIt was marked down as ANCAP deemed the driver chest and neck protection just adequate during some crash tests for the driver and adequate for rear passenger’s neck and just marginal for chest protection.\nIt scored a whopping 95 per cent in the child occupant protection field, which beats its rivals the Toyota HiLux (87 per cent), Mitsubishi Triton (89 per cent) and Ford Ranger (93 per cent)\nANCAP boss Carla Hoorweg said the top score continued BYD’s run of five star cars and showed new brands were putting safety first.\n“With five of BYD’s current local models having now earned top ANCAP safety ratings, it's evident that new manufacturers are prioritising safety as they enter the market to align with consumer demands,” said Ms Hoorweg.\n“Following the recently rated GWM Cannon Alpha hybrid ute, we expect to see an increase in electrified options in the utility space. And so far, they’re meeting the mark.”\nThe BYD Shark has made waves in Australia, it has beat big name players such as Ford, Toyota and Mitsubishi to market with a plug-in hybrid ute.\nBYD didn’t report official sales data last month for the Shark 6, but the brand said it already held between 5000 and 6000 orders for the vehicle, and said it expects to add in excess of 10,000 sales before the end of 2025.\n\"We're very happy with where Shark is, this month [February] will be a record month,\" said CEO of BYD importer EVDirect, David Smitherman, to CarsGuide.\n\"The ultimate way to validate anything is the scoreboard. It's going to be north of 15,000 (sales this year).\"\nFord has confirmed a plug-in hybrid Ranger ute is headed here this year, but no official word from Toyota or Mitsubishi yet.",
