    "text": "Schefter: Browns' Amari Cooper (heel) now inactive for Week 17 The Cleveland Browns have ruled out Amari Cooper (heel) for Thursday's Week 17 game against the New York Jets. Cooper appeared to be trending in the right direction for tonight's game against the Jets' elite defense, but evidently wasn't able to do enough in the team's pregame warmups to suit up for the game. He'll take the weekend off to recover as the Browns gear up for playoff push. Cooper's absence could lead to even more targets for tight end David Njoku, but also for wideouts Elijah Moore and Cedric Tillman. Njoku should be the top priority for the Browns' passing game, and has a $6,600 salary to go with his 9.2-FanDuel-point projection.

    "text": "Himachal: BJP President JP Nadda offers prayers at temple before casting his vote in Bilaspur The four Lok Sabha constituencies in Himachal Pradesh -- Kangra, Mandi, Hamirpur, and Shimla--are polling in a single phase on June 1. [ANI](/ani-stories)| Updated: 01-06-2024 10:14 IST | Created: 01-06-2024 10:14 IST - Country: - India Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national president JP Nadda along with his wife Mallika Nadda offered prayers at a temple near his residence, in Himachal Pradesh's Bilaspur on Saturday, ahead of casting their votes in the seventh phase of Lok Sabha elections. Nadda was also spotted feeding cows at a cowshed in Bilaspur ahead of exercising his franchise. The four Lok Sabha constituencies in Himachal Pradesh -- Kangra, Mandi, Hamirpur, and Shimla--are polling in a single phase on June 1. In addition to the Lok Sabha elections, by-polls are also being held in six Himachal Pradesh assembly seats on the same day. These seats fell vacant after the disqualification of rebel Congress MLAs. The by-poll results are crucial for the future of the Sukhvinder Sukhu government in the state, which received a jolt after the Congress Rajya Sabha candidate, Abhishek Manu Singhvi, lost against BJP's Harsh Mahajan despite the former party having more MLAs in the state. The seventh and final phase of polling in the largest festival of democracy started on Saturday as voting started in the last 57 parliamentary constituencies at 7 am across seven states and the Union Territory of Chandigarh. The seventh phase marks a grand finish to the world's largest polling marathon that began on the 19th of last month and has already covered six phases and 486 Lok Sabha seats. According to the Election Commission of India, over 10.06 crore electors including approximately 5.24 crore male, 4.82 crore female and 3574 third gender electors are expected to exercise their franchise.

    "text": "MUNCIE, Ind. – After a tough end to the season and a head coach's departure in the offseason, the Ball State soccer team was in the hunt for new leadership ahead of their next season. On March 11, it was announced that the position had been filled by Andy Stoots.\nAs a seasoned collegiate coach with 22 years of experience, Stoots felt that Ball State was the perfect place to start his first head coaching campaign.\n“I’ve been doing this a long time, and certainly being a first-time head coach there are things we’re going to learn no doubt about it, but I’ve worked for a lot of really good head coaches so I do feel prepared in that way,” Stoots said.\nAfter a three-year stint with the University of Missouri as their associate head coach, Stoots brings a championship-oriented mindset with him to Ball State.\n“That’s why we play, we play because we’re competitive and because we want to win championships at the end of the year,” Stoots said.\nOn top of wanting to win championships, Stoots said he was drawn to Ball State because of the people he met on campus.\n“From my first conversations with Jeff [Mitchell] and his staff, I was really blown away with the people first and foremost… that really reeled me in,” Stoots said.\nAfter the Cardinals lost their last five games, Stoots said he is ready to implement his own play style.\n“Something really exciting, we want to play, if we can, a really fast-paced and attacking style of game… I think it's a style that players want to be a part of… and I think our fans are going to really enjoy it also,” Stoots explained.\nFans can get a glimpse of the new Cardinal team in the Fall when their season kicks off at Briner Sports Complex.\nContact Stephen Grata with comments at stephen.grata@bsu.edu.",
