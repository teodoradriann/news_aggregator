    "text": "Divided Michigan redistricting commission unable to act after three members leave early Paul Egan Detroit Free Press View Comments LANSING — A divided Michigan redistricting commission sank into dysfunction Thursday, unable to make a decision on whether to appeal a recent court ruling that struck down as unconstitutional 13 of the metro Detroit legislative maps it drew.\nOne commissioner cried \"sabotage\" after three others did not return after a closed session that lasted more than two hours. Those absences, along with recent resignations, left the 13-member commission without a quorum and unable to pass a motion. The meeting was held virtually, over Zoom.\nAll three of the commissioners who were present at the start of Thursday's meeting but did not return after the closed session, held to decide whether to appeal the court ruling, had voiced opposition to appealing the ruling during the public session. They were Republican commissioners Rhonda Lange and Erin Wagner and Independent commissioner Rebecca Szetela.\nTime is short to complete district maps Lange and Wagner both said they were called away by emergencies, while Szetala, an attorney, said she had pressing legal work to take care of, commission Executive Director Edward Woods III said.\nSome other commissioners weren't buying all of those stories.\n\"They pretty much sabotaged this meeting, on purpose,\" said Independent commissioner Richard Weiss.\nAnother independent commissioner, Anthony Eid, called the absences \"a delay tactic, at a minimum.\"\nTime is tight to finalize maps before the 2024 election, and any decision on an appeal, which would go to the U.S. Supreme Court, would need to be made quickly. The commission is next scheduled to meet on Jan. 11.\nOn Dec. 21, a three-judge federal court panel struck down a significant portion of the commission's map-drawing work .\nIn response to a lawsuit brought by Detroit voters, the court ruled that 13 state legislative maps running through the majority-Black city are unconstitutional because race predominated in Michigan's first-ever citizen-led mapping process. The judge said the maps were drawn in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits drawing district lines on the basis of race. Under the ruling, the maps must be redrawn and no more elections can be held under the current lines.\nAt the urging of attorney David Fink, commissioners voted 8-3 to go into closed session to hear legal advice about how to proceed. A closed session requires a two-thirds vote, so the eight \"yes\" votes were the minimum number needed.\nBefore moving to closed session, several commissioners expressed their opinions on whether to file an appeal. That was against the advice of Fink, who said anything said could potentially be used as an admission in the legal fight.\n'An insult to the Black voters in Detroit' Accepting legal advice during an open session would restrict what the commission's lawyers would be able to say, and holding a legal discussion in public would be like the commission playing poker with only its cards dealt face up, while its legal opponents keep theirs hidden, Fink said.\nCommissioner Steven Lett, a semiretired attorney who sits as an independent, said during the public session that the commission should file an appeal and also request a stay of the recent ruling, which would leave the current maps in place until the legal case is resolved.\nLange said she is \"adamantly opposed\" to an appeal. \"I think the court got the ruling right,\" Lange said.\nSzetela, who testified during a recent federal trial in Kalamazoo that the commission's map-drawing was \"100% about race,\" said she is also opposed to appealing and questioned what the grounds for an appeal would be. The panel made \"pretty robust factual findings,\" which an appellate court would be reluctant to overturn, she said. Szetela expressed concern about the cost of continued litigation, saying the commission has already spent over $5 million on legal fees, much of it related to the current case.\nAppealing the ruling \"is kind of an insult to the Black voters in Detroit,\" Szetela said. \"I'd rather just see us redraw maps and be done with the litigation.\"\nRepublican Commissioner Erin Wagner said she agreed an appeal would be \"a big disservice to the people of Detroit.\"\nDustin Witjes, a Democrat who resigned from the commission Dec. 20, used the public comment section of the meeting to urge his former colleagues to \"appeal and appeal hard.\"\nBruce Adelson, the voting rights attorney who has represented the commission in the case, gave notice Wednesday that he is resigning effective Friday, Woods said.\nIt's not clear what role the commission will have in drawing new maps.\nSherry Gay-Dagnogo, a former state lawmaker who is a spokeswoman for the Detroit plaintiffs, said at a Wednesday news conference the court should appoint an expert attorney known as a \"special master\" to assist with drawing the new lines.\n\"We can't depend on the commission,\" she said at the news conference in Detroit, a video of which she posted on Facebook.\nThe Michigan Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission , created as a result of a 2018 vote to amend the state constitution , is composed of four Democrats, four Republicans, and five commissioners who are not affiliated with either party. Its numbers are down currently, due to a spate of resignations .\nContact Paul Egan: 517-372-8660 or pegan@freepress.com. Follow him on X, formerly known as Twitter, @paulegan4.\nView Comments",

Sweden has made a free, democratic, sovereign and united choice to join NATO\", he said.\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken said that few would have expected Sweden as well as Finland to join NATO before Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\nThere is \"no clearer example than today of the strategic debacle that Putin's invasion of Ukraine has become for Russia\", Blinken said.\nSweden has not been involved in a war, including World War II, since the Napoleonic conflicts of the early 19th century.\nSweden and Finland, while militarily intertwined with the United States and both members of the European Union, had historically steered clear of officially joining NATO, formed in the Cold War to unite against the Soviet Union.\nFinland and Sweden launched a joint bid shortly after the invasion of Ukraine, which itself had unsuccessfully sought to join NATO - an alliance that under Article 5, considers an attack on one member an attack on all.\nFinland successfully joined in April 2023, but Sweden's membership was stalled by Turkey.\n“Good things come to those who wait,” Blinken said as he received the documents from Sweden.“Some doubted we'd get here; we never did.”\n'Historic day'\nThe Swedish prime minister is set later Thursday to attend the annual State of the Union address by President Joe Biden, who has been struggling to persuade the rival Republican Party to approve new aid to Ukraine.\nRussia has vowed“countermeasures” over Sweden's entry into NATO, especially if the alliance's troops and assets deploy in the country.\nSweden's blue and golden-yellow flag is expected to be hoisted on Monday at the Brussels headquarters of the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance.\n“This is a historic day. Sweden will now take its rightful place at NATO's table, with an equal say in shaping NATO policies and decisions,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement.\n“After over 200 years of non-alignment Sweden now enjoys the protection granted under Article 5, the ultimate guarantee of allies' freedom and security,” he said.\nBefore agreeing to ratify membership, Turkey used its leverage to press Sweden, known for its liberal asylum policies, to crack down on Kurdish militants who have campaigned against Ankara.\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan later demanded action after protesters, enjoying Swedish laws on free speech, desecrated Islam's holy book the Koran.\nIn a clear if unstated sweetener, the United States dangled the prospect of F-16 warplanes to Turkey, which has faced the wrath of US sanctions over a major military purchase from Russia.\nThe Biden administration in January approved $23 billion in F-16 warplanes to Turkey swiftly after it ratified Sweden's membership.\nThe United States simultaneously pushed ahead with $8.6 billion in more advanced F-35 jets for Greece, a fellow NATO member that has a historic rivalry and frequent tensions with Turkey.\nEven with Turkey's blessing, Sweden faced another obstacle as it needed approval of a last country - Hungary, whose nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orban, has often thumbed his nose at Western allies.\nThe Hungarian parliament ratified Sweden's membership on February 26. But in one last hiccup, Hungary could not formally sign the accession document due to a brief absence in the mostly ceremonial post of president, after an Orban ally resigned in a scandal over pardoning a convicted child abuser's accomplice.\nMENAFN09032024000028011005ID1107956651\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the information “as is” without warranty of any kind.

    "text": "Ja’Marr Chase Shows No Mercy While Dissing Kansas City Chiefs With Harsh Comments About Unimpressive Secondary\nJa’Marr Chase made it abundantly clear that there is no love lost between the Kansas City Chiefs and Cincinnati Bengals. The two AFC powerhouses (in recent years) are set to play again this weekend.\nChase couldn’t be less concerned with the players on the other side of the ball.\nWhen asked what stands out about the\n Kansas City secondary, the 23-year-old NFL wide receiver was very honest. Perhaps too honest.\n“If I’m being honest, nothing,” Chase said.\nOf course, his comments are going to ruffle some feathers among the Chiefs defensive backs. They aren’t going to appreciate what Chase had to say and will have extra motivation to shut him down.\nHe doesn’t care. Not one bit.\n“They could take it how they (want to take it), I don’t care,” Chase said.\nKansas City has quite a few players in its secondary that are of note. Safety Bryan Cook is among the more talented. Chase was not particularly kind to him either.\n“I don’t even know who that is,” he said. “Is that No. 6? I don’t know, man. Just a guy to me. He ain’t Jessie Bates to me. You want me to go (into) comparisons? It’s not the same. Just saying.”\nSAVAGE!\nAlthough the\nBengals pass-catcher was mostly abrasive, he did give some praise to L’Jarius Sneed and called him “the best player on their team.” However, it was a bit of a backhanded compliment.\nChase doubled down to say that Sneed is only the best player on the Chiefs because the rest of the players are not up to his level. He didn’t stop there!\n“That’s why they double everybody, because they can’t do it one-on-one,” Chase added.\nAnd then he fired the kill shot.\n“(The Chiefs) know I’m good,” he said. “They know how to play us. That’s what it is, but it’s not like they got a superstar on their defense.”\nWill Chase regret his harsh words? We will find out on Sunday.",

    "title": "Liga MX 2023: Miguel Herrera critica que Liga MX y su Clausura 2024 apueste por solo cuatro técnicos mexicanos | MARCA México",
    "text": "N i Cruz Azul, ni Pumas, ni Chivas. Tampoco el América Campeón. Los 'cuatro' grandes de la Liga MX tienen algo en común: Todos ellos han apostado por técnicos no nacidos en México para su banquillo. Es el reflejo fulminante para entender, o excusar, a la Liga MX. Una competencia en la que solo hay un 23.5 por ciento de técnicos mexicanos sentados en los asientos de máxima división.\nLiga MX con solo cuatro técnicos mexicanos en los banquillos Si no voltea a Europa, solo destaca el caso de Vasco Aguirre en Mallorca. Por lo que el problema de exportación de futbolistas \"aztecas\" también se traslada a los banquillos, en donde la vitrina para poder dar el salto al Viejo Continente debiera ser Liga MX. Pero en casa propia, 75 por ciento de los equipos tienen a técnicos no nacidos en el país.\nLos datos son funestos para los técnicos mexicanos: En 20 torneos cortos, solo dos DT's nacionales han alzado el título del futbol mexicano : Miguel Herrera (en dos ocasiones con América, 2013 y 2018) e Ignacio Ambriz (León, 2020). El actual monarca es un brasileño: André Jardine con las Águilas, que recientemente conquistaron el Apertura 2023 tras vencer a Tigres en la Final.\nAndre Jardiné tras ser campeón con América: \"Estamos apenas empezando algo muy grande\" 'X' Los equipos que sí apuestan por mexicanos en la dirección técnica de Liga MX Los equipos \"extraños\" que han decidido tener en sus equipos a estrategas mexicanos son solo cuatro; es decir, solo el 23.5 por ciento del total de clubes:\nXolos tiene a Miguel Herrera , quien tras un nuevo fracaso en el anterior semestre; tiene la tarea de comandar a Tijuana en el Clausura 2024; Eduardo Fentanes llegó a Necaxa en pleno semestre anterior; por lo que finalmente ha hecho pretemporada y veremos los avances de su proyecto; Diego Mejía tiene dura tarea con Juárez FC , un club que constantemente apuesta por jugadores veteranos y que no terminar por dar un salto de calidad; Ricardo Carbajal, con Puebla, tiene exigencias, pero alejadas a poder pelear el título.\nPiojo Herrera critica poca paciencia en Liga MX para mexicanos Con pasos por Tigres, Xolos, Rayados y América, Miguel Herrera conversó al respecto de este tema con El Universal. En dicho diario, el ex estratega de la Selección Mexicana criticó que en la liga mexicana no se tenga \"piso parejo\" entre técnicos mexicanos y no nacidos en México.\n\"El técnico mexicano pierde tres partidos y lo echan, el extranjero con tres o cuatro 'vamos viendo, le estamos dando oportunidad, se está adaptando, hay que esperarlo', y al mexicano no, debe estar ahí y dar resultados a los dos segundos. Hay mucha carencia de paciencia \".\nPreparación, un factor que necesita el técnico mexicano Dejarle todo a la Liga MX sería incorrecto, a considerar de Piojo Herrera, y es que el ex jugador de Atlante en los años 90, indicó que es una realidad que los proyectos se pueden justificar con buenos trabajos previamente realizados por los técnicos mexicanos, y en ello falta preparación.\n\"También pasa por nosotros. Debemos estar mejor preparados, ser más competitivos y mostrar más jerarquía, para poder mantenernos constantes en las temporadas. No basta con ir a Europa y prepararse, hay que actualizarnos y abrirnos\" , sentencia.\nCruz Azul Club América CD Guadalajara Liga MX ¿Cuáles han sido las últimas finales de Liga MX?
