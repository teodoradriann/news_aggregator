    "text": "USA TODAY 'I wished it had been me': Husband weeps after wife falls 70 feet off New York cliff Mike Randall and Saman Shafiq, USA TODAY NETWORK December 29, 2023 at 12:16 AM · 4 min read 114 Link Copied Read full article People enjoy the views at Sam's Point Preserve, located on the highest section of the Shawangunk Mountains, in Minnewaska State Park on Sept. 26, 2021.\nPolice in New York are investigating the death of a 39-year-old Singapore woman who reportedly fell 70 feet after losing her footing while taking photos at the edge of a cliff. Meanwhile her husband says he wishes he had been the one to fall instead of her.\nNur Aisyah Binte MD Akbar and her husband were on vacation from Singapore and hiking along Beacon Hill Trail in Minnewaska State Park (about 100 miles north of New York City) on Dec. 22 and had stopped to take photos at the edge of a cliff, New York State Police said .\nPolice said Akbar lost her footing and fell approximately 70 feet off the cliff. Her husband, 41-year-old Abdul Rauf Bin Mohd Said, called 911. State police troopers responded, and Akbar was hoisted out by a helicopter.\nShe was taken to a local hospital, where she succumbed to her injuries, police said, adding that the incident remains under investigation.\nOff limits: Pierce Brosnan cited for walking in dangerous thermal areas at Yellowstone National Park\nDonnie Erwin: YouTuber helps find man missing since 2013, locates human remains in Missouri pond: Police\nHusband details accident Said detailed the accident on social media and thanked three sisters who were hiking in the area for helping his wife during some of her last moments.\nThe accident occurred as the couple \"found a nice part of the park to sit down, take pictures, and discuss our next goals,\" said Said, adding that the temperature was almost 32 degrees and there was ice present over the ground and rocks, making them very slippery.\nAs Said was recording a video of his wife talking about the park's beauty, she slipped and fell down the cliff.\n\"Right after Ais fell off the cliff, I rushed forward, slipped, but didn't fall off the cliff. (Believe me, I wished it had been me),\" wrote Said on Facebook. \"I screamed for help at the top of my lungs, and three sisters, who heard my cries, rushed over to my spot with their father and aunt.\"\nSaid said that the sisters hiked down to where Akbar had fallen and told him that she was still breathing so they gave her their coats to keep her warm until rescuers and medics arrived.\n\"The sisters said Ais told them her name, that she had two dogs, and that she really wanted to drink sweet tea,\" he wrote. \"One of the rangers that was with her told me the same thing. And she was repeatedly saying thank you to them ... Even during the most eventful moments, she was still thinking of making sure the people around her are appreciated.\"\nSaid shared a shaky video that partially shows his wife being helped by the sisters.\n\"Thank you! Is she still alive!?\" he shouts, followed by crying. A woman responds, \"Yeah, she is.\"\nIn another video shared by Said, he talks to the three sisters who shared more about how his wife was doing when they got to her.\n\"She wasn't in any pain for the first while,\" one of the sisters says. \"She couldn't feel much. But then right at the end she started to feel a little pain in her hips. She would say that her hands were cold but the rest of her was warm. So we were holding her hand and putting our hands on her hands.\"\nSaid weeps: \"I should have been down there.\"\nWife wasn't breathing at the time of evacuation When his wife was being evacuated about three hours after the fall, Said said that paramedics told him she wasn't breathing anymore.\n\"I broke down,\" he wrote. \"We rushed to the nearest hospital, where it was confirmed that she didn't survive and had passed away.\"\nSaid said that the rescue operation took about three hours because authorities needed to cut down trees to be able to evacuate using a helicopter. Furthermore, the rocks were slippery and the terrain difficult. Said said that he himself attempted to go down to where Akbar had fallen but kept slipping, even injuring his right wrist in the process.\nAkbar's body was repatriated to Singapore after the necessary legalities were completed and arrived there on Wednesday morning, Said said . The funeral and final rites will take place at the couple's home in Singapore.\n\"I wished I was there, physically by your side at your final moments, but it was not meant to be,\" Said wrote at the bottom of the Facebook post in a message to his wife. \"I am sorry that I was not there. I hope you forgive me and wait for me. Everyone misses you and loves you.\"\nMike Randall covers breaking news for the Times Herald-Record and the Poughkeepsie Journal.

    "title": "Bethlehem ‘without Christmas trees, without lights’ due to Israel-Hamas war | Express & Star",
    "text": "Bethlehem ‘without Christmas trees, without lights’ due to Israel-Hamas war Traditional celebrations have been halted at the birthplace of Christ. Bethlehem, the normally bustling biblical birthplace of Jesus, resembles a ghost town this Christmas Eve, with celebrations called off due to the Israel-Hamas war. The festive lights and Christmas tree that normally decorate Manger Square are missing, as are the foreign tourists who gather each year to mark the holiday. Dozens of Palestinian security forces patrol the empty square. Gift shops have been slow to open on Christmas Eve, although a few did open their doors once the rain stopped pouring down. There are few visitors, however. Brother John Vinh, a Franciscan monk from Vietnam who has lived in Jerusalem for six years, said: “This year, without the Christmas tree and without lights, there’s just darkness.” He said he always comes to Bethlehem to mark Christmas, but this year was especially sobering, as he gazed at a nativity scene in Manger Square with a baby Jesus wrapped in a white shroud, symbolising the hundreds of children killed in the fighting in Gaza. Barbed wire surrounds the scene, with grey rubble added to the spectacle reflecting none of the lights and bursts of colour that normally fill the square during the Christmas season. Ala’a Salameh, one of the owners of Afteem Restaurant, a family-owned falafel restaurant just steps from the square, said: “We can’t justify putting out a tree and celebrating as normal, when some people (in Gaza) don’t even have houses to go to.” Mr Salameh said Christmas Eve is usually the busiest day of the year. “Normally, you can’t find a single chair to sit, we’re full from morning till midnight,” he said. This year, just one table was taken – by journalists sheltering from the rain. He said his restaurant was operating at about 15% of normal business and was not able to cover operating costs. Mr Salameh estimated that even after the war ends, it will take another year for tourism to return to Bethlehem as normal. The cancellation of Christmas festivities is a severe blow to the town’s economy. Tourism accounts for an estimated 70% of Bethlehem’s income – almost all of that during the Christmas season. With many major airlines cancelling flights to Israel, few foreigners are visiting. Local officials say around 70 hotels in Bethlehem have been forced to close, leaving thousands of people unemployed. More than 20,000 Palestinians have been killed and more than 50,000 wounded during Israel’s air and ground offensive against Gaza’s Hamas rulers, according to health officials there, while some 85% of the territory’s 2.3 million residents have been displaced. The war was triggered by Hamas’ deadly assault October 7 on southern Israel in which militants killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took more than 240 hostages. The fighting in Gaza has also affected life in the West Bank. Since October 7, access to Bethlehem and other Palestinian towns in the Israeli-occupied territory has been difficult, with long lines of motorists waiting to pass military checkpoints. The restrictions have also prevented tens of thousands of Palestinians from exiting the territory to work in Israel.",
