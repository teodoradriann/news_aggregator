    "text": "Pierce Brosnan tendrá que comparecer ante el Centro de Justicia de Yellowstone (Montana, EE UU), tras presuntamente haber entrado en zonas termales protegidas de ese parque nacional estadounidense. Según un expediente penal presentado el martes en el Tribunal de Distrito de EE UU en Wyoming, obtenido por los medios estadounidenses CNN y People , el actor de James Bond ha sido acusado presuntamente por \"desplazamiento a pie en todas las zonas termales y en el Cañón de Yellowstone limitado a senderos... e infracción de los cierres y límites de uso\". Los cargos que enfrenta Brosnan, de 70 años, son del 1 de noviembre y están tipificados como delito menor. El actor ha sido citado en el Centro de Justicia de Yellowstone ubicado en Montana el 23 de enero. Yellowstone es considerado el primer parque nacional del mundo y es famoso por sus singulares características hidrotermales y geológicas. En su página oficial, el parque aconseja a los visitantes seguir una serie de normas en torno a las zonas termales como no transitarlas después del anochecer , además de prohibir nadar, remojarse o bañarse en aguas que sean totalmente de origen termal. En octubre el actor se encontraba filmado en el Yellowstone Film Ranch la película Unholy Trinity , de Richard Gray, en la que comparte créditos con Samuel L. Jackson, Brandon Lessard y Ethan Peck.",

    "text": "US fintech Block reportedly laying off 931 staffUS fintech Block reportedly laying off 931 staff\nCEO Jack Dorsey reportedly informed Block employees about the cuts via an email on Tuesday, which has since been published by TechCrunch.\nCameron Emanuel-Burns\nMarch 27, 2025\nUS-based fintech group Block is reportedly laying off 931 staff, approximately 8% of its workforce, according to a leaked email to employees from CEO Jack Dorsey published by TechCrunch.\nIn the email, which TechCrunch reports was sent to staff on Tuesday, Dorsey says the company will be \"making some org changes, including eliminating roles and beginning the consultation process in countries where required\".\nDorsey outlines that 391 employees will be leaving to reduce teams that \"are off strategy\", 460 workers will be let go due to performance, and 80 managers will also depart to flatten the company's hierarchy. Moreover, the CEO notes that 193 managers will transition to \"individual contributor roles\".\nIn addition, Dorsey, who co-founded Block in 2009, also revealed the closure of 748 open job positions, with exceptions only for critical operational, leadership, and offer-stage roles.\nDorsey clarifies that the layoffs are not being carried out to \"hit a specific financial target\", alter the company's headcount limit, or to replace individuals with AI. Instead, he explains, \"they are specific to our needs around strategy, raising the bar and acting faster on performance, and flattening our org so we can move faster and with less abstraction\".\nBlock, which operates well-known brands such as CashApp, Afterpay, Square, and the music streaming service Tidal, also underwent a separate reorganisation last year, cutting around 1,000 jobs.",

    "text": "Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) and India’s Border Security Force (BSF) have agreed to prevent shooting deaths on the Bangladesh-India border at the 54th DG Level Border Conference.\nThe five-day conference, held at Dhaka’s Peelkhana, ended on Saturday.\nThe directors general of both border forces and their delegations appeared before the media at 10 am on Saturday.\n“Both sides have agreed that, from now on, there will be no more killings on the border – whether it is of a uniformed border guard, any innocent, or a common person. Neither Bangladesh nor India want any more loss of life. We will try our best to ensure it,” said BGB DG Maj Gen Mohammad Ashrafuzzaman Siddiqui.\nBSF Director General Nitin Agrawal spoke of changing their weapons policy to reduce border killings to ‘zero’.\n“We have come to a policy that refrains from the use of deadly weapons. To get the effective benefits of this policy, both sides have agreed to increase joint border patrols and exchange information on an immediate basis.”\nQuestions regarding the killing of BGB guard Roisuddin in January were raised at the press conference.\n“We have officially informed the BGB about what happened that day and how we handled it,” Agrawal said. “You can get the details from the BGB. I will not repeat it.”\nAsked about the situation, Siddiqui said, “There has been an official exchange of letters on the matter. It was not a targeted killing. The incident occurred amid darkness, fog, and confusion. There was a misunderstanding on both sides.”\nBSF personnel are also ‘under attack’ at the border, Agrawal said.\n“The BGB has faced attacks. Both sides have faced attacks. Sixty BSF personnel have been injured in various incidents.”\n“BSF personnel were injured by machetes and sharp weapons by smugglers and criminals. That’s when they opened fire in self-defence. Because of this, the bodies of the dead gave bullet wounds on sensitive areas like their chest, stomach, and head. It proves the BSF fired after they were attacked.”\nThe existing friendly relations and mutual cooperation between the border security forces of both countries will increase further in the future, a written statement issued at the press conference said.\nBoth sides agreed to control drug trafficking on the border and increase the number of border huts.",

    "text": "Angus & The Mearns Angus Council thank public for roads staff praise after barrage of online hate at height of Storm Gerrit Exhausted Angus road teams recovering from Storm Babet came in from their holidays to deal with the severe weather which caused chaos this week.\nBy Graham Brown December 29 2023, 11.51am Share Angus Council thank public for roads staff praise after barrage of online hate at height of Storm Gerrit Share via Facebook Twitter Linkedin Whatsapp Messenger Email Post link https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/news/angus-mearns/4852962/angus-council-road-teams-storm-gerrit-praise/ Copy Link 5 comment Flooding near Brechin during Storm Gerrit. Image: Margaret Leitch\nAngus Council roads staff have been hailed as heroes for their efforts at the height of Storm Gerrit.\nAnd the authority says the public’s appreciation is a boost for exhausted workers who suffered a deluge of online hate as rains lashed the county on Wednesday.\nThe severe weather closed roads across the area.\nWorst affected was the A90 dual carriageway which was shut south of Forfar for around eight hours.\nThe scene on the A90 near Forfar. Image: Fubar News Flooding also caused the closure of the A92 between Monifieth and Carnoustie.\nThe situation and its aftermath prompted a flood of online criticism.\nBut folk have now risen to the defence of the teams on the frontline during the worst of the brutal weather.\n‘Not all heroes wear capes’ Posting on the Angus Roads Information Facebook page, Joyce Prophet said: “A big thank you to all Angus road staff for their sterling work.\n“Not all heroes wear capes.”\nAngus Roads Information has more than 31,000 members.\nThe plaudits prompted a council response which revealed the level of hate their teams had come in for.\nTheir social media team responded: “Thank you. You can’t imagine how much hate we got yesterday as if the storm was our fault, so this means a lot.\n“Staff came in from holidays to help and they were desperately due a break after Storm Babet and the repairs afterwards.\n“This will give them a wee boost.”\nOthers were quick to add praise.\nOne said: “Some of the comments yesterday made my blood boil!\n“If delays to getting a bin emptied is all they have to complain about then they’re very lucky.\nFlooding at Gateside on the A90 south of Forfar. Image: Lindsey Hamilton/DC Thomson “Folk need to realise there are human beings working on this page, doing their very best in difficult circumstances and staff are under huge pressure even without emergency events like a storm.\n“The majority do appreciate everything you do. Here’s hoping 2024 will be less eventful!”\nAnd another member added: “Some very petty minded and selfish people out there.\n“Let’s hope they got the Christmas they deserved – and the staff working so hard in such terrible conditions got and get what they deserve, in addition to our thanks.”\nOthers said comments directed at the council were “appalling”.\nCalls for action at flood blackspots But the storm situation reignited the debate over local flood hotspots such as the A92.\nThere have been complaints about flooding on the Dundee to Arbroath dual carriageway for years.\nOne commenter said: “I appreciate the hate you got in many cases would be unjustified. But….the A92.\n“It’s been shut between Monifieth and Carnoustie due to flooding on 5 or 6 occasions this year alone.\n“Something is wrong here and neither you, Bear Scotland or Amey have made any effort to fix it.”\nAnother added: “Just like the big dip between Montrose and Inverkeilor on the A92 as well.\n“Obviously a problem in these places that needs addressing.\n“It’s all well and good saying avoid travel if you can but what about all the hospital staff, care workers, etc. that have no option to stay at home.”",

    "text": "El gobierno cubano confirmó el incremento de casos de hepatitis A en el país.\nEl director nacional de Epidemiología del Ministerio de Salud Pública (MINSAP), Francisco Durán, informó en la televisión estatal de la aparición de cuadros de esta dolencia.\nLo más leído hoy:\nDurán explicó que esta es una enfermedad de transmisión digestiva, que tiene que ver con el consumo de agua contaminada con heces fecales de personas que ya la tienen.\n\"Existe un incremento, como existe un incremento de la enfermedad diarreica también\", subrayó.\nSegún el experto, los síntomas son el malestar general, la ictericia (color amarillo) en la piel y las mucosas de los ojos, y fiebre en algunos casos.\n\"Es una enfermedad viral, porque es el virus de la hepatitis A\", recalcó.\nPara prevenirla, hay que consumir alimentos no contaminados, por ello es necesario lavar bien las verduras y tomar siempre agua hervida o clorada.\n\"Se trabaja para garantizar la disponibilidad de hipoclorito de sodio al 1 % en las farmacias con un precio que no es muy caro\", precisó.\nEn mayo, hubo un incremento de casos de hepatitis A en el reparto Reina de la ciudad de Cienfuegos, con más de 5,000 pacientes detectados, que obligó a las autoridades a adoptar medidas de vigilancia epidemiológica.\nLiván Rojas Lantigua, de la Dirección de Salud en la provincia, informó que la mayoría de los casos se concentraban en cuatro manzanas del reparto. Allí se realizaban acciones \"para incrementar la percepción de riego de contraer el virus\", como realizar el control de focos en las viviendas para mantener la vigilancia sanitaria.\nLa semana pasada, Durán alertaba sobre la necesidad de extremar precauciones con los alimentos y el agua, especialmente durante las festividades de fin de año, para evitar un aumento en los casos de diarrea.\nEl especialista informó que Cuba cierra 2024 con transmisión activa de dengue en 13 provincias, con un número considerable de pacientes ingresados, de los cuales son casos graves. Por su parte, el Oropouche afecta 15 provincias, con menor gravedad debido a una sintomatología más discreta, con la mayoría de los casos tratados en domicilio.\nTodo ello refleja un panorama epidemiológico crítico, agravado por problemas de saneamiento y deficiencias estructurales.\n\"El cuadro clínico del dengue y el Oropouche es muy similar, lo que puede generar confianza indebida en las personas, pensando que es Oropouche, cuando en realidad podría ser dengue, que puede agravarse\", alertó.\nEl epidemiólogo señaló que aunque no se han registrado casos de zika, chikungunya o fiebre amarilla en Cuba, el Aedes aegypti sigue siendo el vector responsable de estas arbovirosis, por eso es vital fortalecer las medidas de saneamiento y control de focos.\n\"Sabemos los problemas que existen con la recogida de basura, pero cada cual debe esforzarse en su entorno para minimizar riesgos\", añadió Durán.\nPreguntas frecuentes sobre el incremento de hepatitis A en Cuba\n¿Qué ha causado el aumento de casos de hepatitis A en Cuba?\nEl aumento de casos de hepatitis A en Cuba está relacionado con el consumo de agua contaminada con heces fecales de personas infectadas. Esto resalta la grave situación sanitaria y la falta de acceso a agua potable segura, que son problemas estructurales en el país y están siendo exacerbados por la ineficacia del gobierno cubano para garantizar condiciones de higiene adecuadas.\n¿Cuáles son los síntomas de la hepatitis A?\nLos síntomas de la hepatitis A incluyen malestar general, ictericia (color amarillo en la piel, mucosas y ojos) y fiebre. Estos síntomas indican una infección viral que afecta principalmente al hígado y puede tener un impacto serio en la salud si no se toman medidas preventivas adecuadas.\n¿Qué medidas se pueden tomar para prevenir la hepatitis A en Cuba?\nPara prevenir la hepatitis A es fundamental consumir alimentos no contaminados, lo que implica lavar bien las verduras y tomar siempre agua hervida o clorada. Sin embargo, en Cuba, la falta de recursos y condiciones adecuadas en el suministro de agua potable complican la implementación de estas medidas preventivas.\n¿Qué está haciendo el gobierno cubano para controlar la hepatitis A?\nEl gobierno cubano ha implementado medidas de vigilancia epidemiológica en respuesta al aumento de casos de hepatitis A. Sin embargo, la falta de recursos, la escasez de productos de higiene y la ineficiencia en la gestión sanitaria limitan la efectividad de estas acciones, dejando a la población expuesta a riesgos mayores.\nCOMENTAR\nArchivado en:",

    "text": "SANTA CRUZ COUNTY, Calif. (KSBW) - A missing hiker was finally rescued after he was lost for 10 days in the Santa Cruz Mountains of California.\nThe 34-year-old man was only going for a three-hour hike when he disappeared.\n“I didn’t bring anything because I thought I was doing a three-hour hike to go to work,” Lukas McClish, the rescued hiker, said.\nHe was lost in the woods for nine nights and 10 days, shirtless with only a flashlight and folding scissors.\nIt would be more than a week before the raggedy-looking hiker would be found.\n“So, I kind of just hiked. Each day, I go up a canyon, down a canyon to the next waterfall, sit down by the waterfall, drink water out of my boot,” Lukas McClish recalled.\nIt was a Tuesday when Lukas McClish went for a hike in Boulder Creek and ended up getting lost.\n“I felt comfortable the whole time I was out there. I wasn’t worried about it,” Lukas McClish said. “I had a mountain lion that was following me, but it was cool. It kept its distances. I think it was just somebody watching over me.”\nThe problem was that Lukas McClish didn’t tell anyone where he was going.\nBy the time Father’s Day rolled around on Sunday, his family started worrying and filed a missing person’s report.\nThe search was on then.\n“Some nights, although, I just had to trust God that he was going to be OK, and that was hard to do some nights when we would go to bed at night because I would worry about where he was, where he was sleeping and how cold he was and where he was if he was alive,” Diane McClish, the hiker’s mother, said.\nLukas McClish drank from water from creeks, ate wild berries and slept on a wet bed of leaves all while yelling for help and thinking of his next meal.\n“‘Just help. Help, I’m over here.’ Or, ‘Is anybody out there?’” Lukas McClish remembered saying while he was lost. “I want a burrito or a taco bowl. That’s what I thought about every day when I, after the first five days, when I started to kind of realize that I might be in over my head.”\nBut on Thursday afternoon, someone finally heard his cries for help.\nThe Boulder Creek Fire Department deployed a drone and spotted his location.\nA K-9 tracked him down and Lukas McClish was escorted out of a remote canyon, finally reunited with family.\n“Met a lot of people because I had more people come to me and tell me how much they love my son and how they just hoped that we would find him,” Diane McClish said. “I didn’t realize that so many people in this town love Luke.”\nFortunately, Lukas McClish had no major injuries.\nCopyright 2024 KSBW via CNN Newsource.
