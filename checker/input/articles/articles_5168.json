    "title": "USCG Heavy Icebreaker Polar Star Returns Home After 128-day Deployment",
    "text": "The only heavy icebreaker in the U.S. Coast Guard fleet USCG Polar Star arrived back in San Francisco completing her annual deployment to Antarctica and now she is preparing for the final phase of her ongoing life extension. Commissioned in 1976, the USCG needs to keep her operation until at least 2030 when the much-delayed next-generation heavy icebreaker is anticipated to be delivered.\nPolar Star departed Seattle bound for Antarctica on November 22, 2024. She traveled over 25,000 miles through the North Pacific, South Pacific, and Southern Oceans returning to San Francisco on March 30. It was a 128-day deployment to Antarctica in support of Operation Deep Freeze (ODF) 2025, the annual joint military service mission to resupply and maintain the United States Antarctic Stations.\nThe vessel provides heavy icebreaking capabilities to facilitate sealift, seaport access, bulk fuel supply, and cargo handling for two of three permanent U.S. research stations in Antarctica, with NSF McMurdo Station being the largest. The cutter’s icebreaking capabilities enable the safe delivery of critical supplies to sustain year-round operations and support international partnerships in the harsh Antarctic environment.\nIn Antarctica, this year the cutter encountered 14 miles of fast ice up to six feet thick. At a length of 399 feet, Polar Star is 13,500 tons and has six diesel and three gas turbine engines producing up to 75,000 hp. This gives her the capability of breaking through ice up to 21 feet (6.4 meters) thick and can steam continuously through 6 feet (1.8 meters) of ice at 3 knots.\nThe only USCG heavy icebreaker, 49-year-old Polar Star will start the final phase of her life extension program (USCG)\nDuring this year’s deployment, Polar Star created a navigable route and cleared Winter Quarters Bay for two cargo vessels and HMNZS Aotearoa to reach NSF McMurdo Station. While operating in McMurdo Sound, Polar Star , and Aotearoa conducted an at-sea crew exchange to build a shared understanding of each vessel’s unique capabilities in the polar regions.\nAt the conclusion of vessel operations at McMurdo Station, the cutter departed the Antarctic region on March 3 after 60 days. Polar Star made two logistical stops in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and Sydney en route to Antarctica. On its journey back to the United States, Polar Star moored in French Polynesia for a community relations stopover.\n“But our work isn’t done,\" said Capt. Jeff Rasnake, Polar Star ’s commanding officer. “As we wrap up ODF 25, we must quickly transition to the first phase of ODF 26 – heavy depot maintenance. There’s no time to waste as we work to ensure Polar Star is ready to roll into her 50th year of service.”\nPolar Star will enter the final phase of its five-year Service Life Extension Project which is being conducted at Mare Island Dry Dock in Vallejo, California. It calls for recapitalizing targeted systems, including the cutter’s propulsion, communication, machinery control, and auxiliary systems, and conducting significant maintenance to extend the cutter’s service life. Each phase of the life extension has been coordinated so that operational commitments, like Operation Deep Freeze missions in Antarctica, would still be met.\nAccording to the Coast Guard, “Completing SLEP will significantly mitigate the risk of lost operational days due to unplanned maintenance or system failures by replacing obsolete, unsupportable, or maintenance-intensive equipment.”\nNext year’s Operation Deep Freeze will be Polar Star ’s 29th and will coincide with 50th anniversary of her commissioning.",

    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\"\nTwo of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France.\nHis Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back.\nAva Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings.\nOn Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war.\n‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales.\n“It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.”\nCoogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums.\n“The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.”\nLt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled.\n“I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said.\nShe noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out.\nOnce they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away.\nAlthough there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called.\n“I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.”\nA car wreck took her 3 kids. Now through surrogacy, she is a mom again to a baby boy. A Georgia family was about to lose insurance for teen's cancer battle. Then they got help. Pedaling kindness: Massachusetts Peloton group leaves servers $7,200 tip 'Feed somebody you don’t know': Philadelphia man inspires, heals through food Why strangers raised $450,000 to help a dependable Burger King worker buy his first home Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York.\nLt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, online records show.\nFay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life.\n“He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said.\nOnce Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost.\n“He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.”\nIt ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said.\n“That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",

    "text": "El universo televisivo está a punto de expandirse nuevamente con la mente detrás de dos de las series más aclamadas de las últimas décadas. Vince Gilligan, creador de Breaking Bad y Better Call Saul, prepara su regreso con una nueva producción original que se estrenará en Apple TV+. El anuncio ha despertado gran expectación entre los fanáticos del drama televisivo, especialmente luego de que la plataforma de streaming compartiera un enigmático teaser que sugiere un tono radicalmente distinto al de sus anteriores obras.\nCon el mensaje “Happiness is Contagious” (La felicidad es contagiosa) y una imagen de una placa de Petri con una cara sonriente amarilla, Apple TV+ encendió las redes sociales al iniciar la cuenta regresiva para revelar detalles oficiales del proyecto. El evento está programado para el próximo viernes 25 de julio, a las 3 PM (hora del Este de EE.UU.), momento en el que se espera la publicación del tráiler, el título de la serie y datos clave sobre la trama.\nUna de las noticias que más entusiasmo ha generado es el regreso de Rhea Seehorn, actriz que dio vida a Kim Wexler en Better Call Saul, como protagonista de esta nueva producción. Su colaboración con Gilligan fue ampliamente elogiada por la crítica, y este reencuentro creativo promete ser uno de los ejes narrativos más sólidos de la serie.\n¿De qué tratará la serie?\nAunque el proyecto aún no tiene título oficial, sí se ha revelado que se trata de un drama con tintes de ciencia ficción y un enfoque psicológico. Lejos del universo criminal de Albuquerque, este nuevo relato estará ambientado en una versión alternativa del mundo actual, pero con un giro inesperado desde el primer episodio. Según Gilligan, a diferencia de sus personajes anteriores —notoriamente los antihéroes como Walter White—, el protagonista de esta historia será un héroe clásico, lo que supone un cambio significativo en su estilo narrativo.\nApple TV+ ha apostado fuerte por este proyecto, asegurando de antemano dos temporadas, incluso antes de su estreno. La decisión subraya la confianza que la plataforma deposita en el talento de Gilligan, y la expectativa de que esta serie se convierta en uno de sus productos insignia para la temporada de otoño de 2025.\nEl cambio de tono también ha sido tema de conversación entre analistas y medios especializados. Gilligan ha descrito el proyecto como un “drama de género con los pies en la tierra”, que busca explorar temas filosóficos, existenciales y humanos, alejándose del thriller criminal, pero manteniendo la profundidad emocional y narrativa que caracteriza su obra.\n¿Qué podríamos esperar de este próximo lanzamiento?\nEl lanzamiento de esta nueva serie marca el primer trabajo importante de Vince Gilligan desde el final de Better Call Saul en 2022, y representa también una nueva etapa creativa para Rhea Seehorn. Con una producción respaldada por Apple, un elenco prometedor y una narrativa aún envuelta en misterio, el regreso del showrunner promete ser uno de los eventos televisivos más esperados del próximo año.\nPor ahora, la atención está centrada en el anuncio del viernes, cuando el equipo creativo finalmente rompa el silencio y dé a conocer el nombre, la sinopsis oficial y posiblemente la fecha exacta de estreno de este nuevo proyecto que, sin duda, buscará marcar un antes y un después en la televisión contemporánea.",

    "text": "A Fayetteville woman who police say waited years before recently reporting two of her adopted children missing is accused in a civil court petition of financially exploiting her ailing mother. The request for an emergency order of protection was filed by the Cumberland County Department of Social Services on behalf of 95-year-old Leonie Maxwell. In its request, DSS states that Maxwell is unable to advocate for herself because she is on a ventilator in the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit at Cape Fear Valley Medical Center after sustaining an anoxic brain injury in November. The April 10 filing alleges that her daughter and caretaker, Avantae Deven, 61, had not responded since March 27 to calls from hospital staff concerning \"necessary medical decisions\" for Maxwell and that on March 30 when a welfare check was conducted at Deven's home, no one answered the door. Everything we know so far: Timeline of events in the Fayetteville case of two missing adopted siblings March 27 was the same day that the Fayetteville Police Department served three search warrants — including on Deven’s current and previous Fayetteville homes — in the hunt for her missing 17-year-old adopted son Blake Deven. Police records show that Avantae Deven reported Blake as a runaway on Jan. 19. The record indicates he was last seen at the Ramsey Street Walmart. During the investigation into the teen’s disappearance, law enforcement learned another of Deven’s adopted children, London Deven, 27, hadn’t been seen since 2019, officials said. On April 12, authorities announced that human skeletal remains had been recovered during the search for the two. The identity of the remains is pending the outcome of an examination by the N.C. Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, police said. ‘Their mysterious disappearance’ While the records focus mainly on Maxwell's rapidly declining health and her finances, the missing children are listed as one of the reasons an emergency order is required. \"FBI agents have been to (Maxwell's) hospital room to question her with regard to her daughter/current caregiver's children and their mysterious disappearance,” the record states. Judge Toni King found on April 11 that the emergency order was warranted because there was \"a substantial likelihood that respondent may suffer death or irreparable harm if emergency protective services are not provided.\" DSS said in its filing that Maxwell is unable to communicate because of her condition, cannot consent to the protective services and that \"no other person is able or willing to arrange for protective services.\" In an April 15 order continuing the first court date set for the following day, District Judge Cull Jordan III stated that Avantae Deven could still visit her mother in the hospital but was not in control of Maxwell's care. \"Avantae Deven shall give no directives or instructions to medical personnel treating respondent and shall ... treat all medical personnel with dignity and respect at all times,\" the continuance order states. \"In the event Ms. Deven causes any disruptions at Cape Fear Valley Medical Center, hospital staff may terminate Ms. Deven's visit with respondent and remove her from the premises.\"' Assets frozen In addition to the request by DSS to control Maxwell's medical care, District Court Judge Toni King ordered that Maxwell's assets — noted to be more than $15,000 — be frozen and directed Wells Fargo to turn over financial records for February through April. \"The order was sought because of the information and belief that you were being financially exploited by your caretaker,\" according to a notice intended to inform Maxwell of the court's order. A hearing that had been set in the matter for Wednesday was continued to next month. Who is Avantae Deven? Public records on Avantae Deven are scarce and the Fayetteville Police Department has declined to provide additional information on the disappearance of her adopted children. What can be discerned from court dockets is that Deven adopted London in 2011 in Buncombe County and she adopted Blake from neighboring Madison County in 2013. Adoption records are sealed once finalized in North Carolina. Records from the N.C. Division of Non-Public Education, which maintains home school records, indicate that a home school named Deven Academy opened in 2007 in Buncombe County. Since then the Deven Academy has had several address changes and phone numbers in both Buncombe and Madison counties before its current registration at the Deven family home on Berriedale Drive. Fayetteville Police Chief Kemberle Braden said at a news conference earlier this month that the family moved to the area in 2015. Blake or London Deven do not appear to have ever attended public schools in Cumberland County, according to a spokesman for the district. In addition to the adoption record, Buncombe County records also show that Avantae Deven was granted a divorce in 2006 after living separately from her husband for five years. It states the couple was married in Las Vegas, Nevada, in 1996 and they shared no property or had children in common. The record shows that Deven was unsuccessful in locating her estranged husband to serve him with the papers, even going so far as to run notices in a Montana newspaper. The North Carolina court granted the divorce because the couple had been separated for at least 12 months, the record states. Cumberland County property records show that Nelson & Johnson LLC owned and then sold the Eichelberger Drive home the family previously lived in June 2019. That same month, Nelson & Johnson LLC purchased the Berriedale Drive home Avantae Deven currently lives in. The business, Nelson & Johnson LLC, does not appear to be registered in North Carolina, but New Mexico records list Avantae Deven as a member of Nelson & Johnson LLC, established in New Mexico in 2016. The business purpose is listed as: \"Gatherings for various artist showings and book sharing/readings. No selling entailed.\" The contact information for Deven shows a Sedona, Arizona, address and notes that correspondence should be \"C/O David Novick.\" Novick did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "text": "Allies and partners from more than a dozen participating nations marked the successful conclusion of exercise Cutlass Express 2024, East Africa’s premier maritime exercise, March 8, 2024. The exercise kicked off following opening ceremonies in Djibouti and the Seychelles, Feb. 25 and 26, respectively. It involved hundreds of Sailors, Coast Guardsmen, civilian and contractor personnel across Africa’s East Coast, from Djibouti to Tanzania to Mozambique, and into the Western Indian Ocean, with Comoros, Madagascar, Mauritius and the Seychelles all hosting individual scenarios, alongside multiple East African coastal nations. Partner nations from outside East Africa, including Georgia, India, Senegal, Tunisia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, also took part. In addition to Djibouti and the Seychelles, Kenya also served as a host nation and primary exercise hub, with numerous events and exercise serials occurring alongside the Kenyan Coast Guard Service in Mombasa. “Cutlass Express continues to provide a platform for Kenya Coast Guard Service personnel to exploit learning opportunities fostering continuous improvement in maritime law enforcement,” said Director General of the Kenya Coast Guard Service, Mr. Bruno I. Shioso, EBS, OGW. “CE 24 played a key role in enhancing our overall operational posture and readiness aimed at enhancing maritime security in the WIO region whilst strengthening partnerships and collaborations among participating nations. Leveraging on these partnerships for a broader Maritime Collective Approach underpins development within the region.” The exercise started off with a focus on training and academics, where partners shared processes, experiences, and procedures on a wide range of topics, including SeaVision and maritime domain awareness, maritime collaboration across the region, and fundamentals of maritime interdiction, from information collection to target prosecution. The international team of participants also trained on Women, Peace and Security (WPS), Visit, Board, Search and Seizure (VBSS) evolutions, and diving fundamentals, among others. The academic setting set the stage for this week’s final training exercise, or FTX, where those involved put their skills and knowledge to the test. The FTX portion of the exercise provided the perfect venue for partners to relay their training into realistic exercise scenarios, identifying suspect vessels and personnel, sharing information about targets, capabilities, and available assets, and dispatching multinational teams to address shared threats. Whether vessels suspected of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUUF), personnel believed to be smuggling illicit material or involved in human trafficking, or other threats to regional maritime security, each exercise scenario inject presented a unique challenge and opportunity to combine efforts and neutralize threats. These scenarios occurred against a backdrop of leveraging new and existing technologies, too. Working with the SeaVision program to collect and share data and incorporating collaboration across maritime operations centers (MOC), the Regional Maritime Information Fusion Center (RMIFC) in Madagascar and the Regional Coordination Operations Centre (RCOC) in the Seychelles underscored the value Cutlass Express provides to the region. Participants bolstered their regional collaboration, enhanced their understanding and application of legal principles and the Djibouti Code of Conduct, and strengthened skills in the maritime domain. Cutlass Express 2024, conducted by U.S. Naval Forces Africa and sponsored by U.S. Africa Command, increases the readiness of U.S. forces; enhances maritime domain awareness and collaboration among participating nations; and strengthens the capability of partner nations to combat piracy and counter illicit trafficking and illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing. For over 80 years, U.S. Naval Forces Europe-Africa (NAVEUR-NAVAF) has forged strategic relationships with allies and partners, leveraging a foundation of shared values to preserve security and stability. Headquartered in Naples, Italy, NAVEUR-NAVAF operates U.S. naval forces in the USEUCOM and USAFRICOM areas of responsibility. U.S. Sixth Fleet is permanently assigned to NAVEUR-NAVAF, and employs maritime forces through the full spectrum of joint and naval operations.
