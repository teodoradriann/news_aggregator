    "text": "在莱茵-鲁尔大运会女篮半决赛中，中国队通过加时赛以71:67击败波兰队，成功晋级决赛。前一天的八强战中，中国女篮逆转淘汰日本队，波兰队则战胜捷克队晋级。\n当天比赛开始后，中国队表现出色，在首节过半时取得15:7的优势。然而暂停后，波兰队加强了防守，使得中国队难以在内线得分，外线命中率也不高，对手趁机反超比分，并以33:26领先结束上半场。第二节中国队仅得9分。\n下半场中国队进攻有所改善，第三节开局连进两个三分球缩小分差。比赛进入白热化阶段，双方交替领先。第四节末段，两队最后一攻均未命中，比赛以62平进入加时赛。加时赛中，田媛媛贡献了关键的7分，中国队抓住几个关键篮板，最终锁定胜局。\n比赛中，中国队共命中10记三分球，陈玉婕得到全场最高的24分，刘禹彤与唐子婷各自贡献14分。\n赛后教练赵雪同表示，由于前一场比赛强度较大，几名球员出现身体不适，体能方面存在问题。面对身体素质出色的波兰队，中国队第二节进攻受阻，但教练组要求队员们调整心态，按正常节奏打。\n中国队将在25日的决赛中迎战美国队，后者当日以73:71险胜匈牙利队晋级。赵雪同表示，尽管明天没有比赛，但会根据对手表现安排一次有针对性的训练。",

    "title": "Once Jailed for 4 Years, 80-Year-Old Liaoning Woman Faces Indictment for Her Faith in Falun Gong | Falun Dafa - Minghui.org",
    "text": "(Minghui.org) A Jinzhou City, Liaoning Province, resident who had been out on bail was issued a formal arrest warrant on February 5, 2024, and taken back into custody on the same day for her faith in Falun Gong, a mind-body practice that has been persecuted by the Chinese Communist Party since July 1999. Ms. Wang Guixia, 80, is now facing indictment while being held at the Jinzhou City Women’s Detention Center. Ms. Wang was initially arrested on the afternoon of September 25, 2022, after being reported for talking to people about Falun Gong at the local Beihu Park. The Shiqiaozi Police Station officers also raided her home and confiscated her Falun Gong books. They later released her on bail. One day in early July 2023, two people from the Linghai City [Procuratorate] showed up at Ms. Wang’s home and said they had received her case. She was not in, and they had her family sign her case file on her behalf. [Linghai is under the administration of Jinzhou City. The Linghai City Procuratorate and Linghai City Court have been designated to handle Falun Gong cases in the greater Jinzhou area.] A prosecutor called Ms. Wang’s family on July 11, 2023, and asked them to tell her to report to the procuratorate to be deposed. Her family said she would not go because she did not break any law in practicing her faith. The procuratorate issued a formal arrest warrant against Ms. Wang on February 5, 2024, and she was taken back into custody on the same day. This is not the first time that Ms. Wang has been targeted for practicing Falun Gong, which she credits for restoring her health and enabling her to live a fulfilling life. Ms. Wang was previously arrested in August 2002 and sentenced to four years. She suffered various forms of abuse at the Liaoning Province Women’s Prison. She was once forced to stand barefoot on a cold cement floor for four straight hours. Another time she was barred from taking showers for two months in a row. She was also tied to a bed in a spread-eagle position with her mouth taped for ten days. The guards often whipped Ms. Wang with slippers, kicked her on her private part and breasts with leather shoes, pricked her in the chest with safety pins, and hit her on the hands with brooms. On a few occasions, they dunked her head in a basin filled with water, wrapped tape around her neck, sat on her to punch her temples, yanked off her hair, and even stripped her to her underwear. When she went on a hunger strike in protest, they force-fed her and kept her restrained in a bed without allowing her to use the restroom. Li Meishan from the Jinzhou City Police Department and deputy chief Du from the Shiyou Police Station led three agents to raid Ms. Wang’s home on July 19, 2012. She was not in but was forced to live away to avoid being arrested. Ms. Wang was distributing Falun Gong informational materials on October 18, 2013, when she was arrested and forced to pay more than 10,000 yuan fine. She was released 16 days later.

    "text": "MINNEAPOLIS — A celebrity author is brightening the holiday season for several Minnesota booksellers. James Patterson has given $500 prizes to 18 independent bookstores and employees across the state. Eight of the winners are in the Twin Cities, including Moon Palace Books in Minneapolis. \"Every year [Patterson] gives out money to booksellers around the country,\" said Angela Schwesnedl, the owner of Moon Palace Books. \"It's very exciting. I wish I knew who put my name in.\" Kenya Goldstein, an employee at Cherry Street Books in Alexandria, became the store's fourth bookseller to get the recognition. \"They're not just there to sell,\" said Emily Regnier, the owner of Cherry Street Books. \"They want to give you a book they know you're going to enjoy, and they like to learn what you're into, so when you come in time and time again, you sometimes will form a bond with a different bookseller.\" Schwesnedl and Regnier are quick to point out how well the industry is doing right now. They say there are more stores being opened and more books being published. \"There's a whole generation of kids who are growing up in this neighborhood with a neighborhood bookstore that they can go to,\" said Schwesnedl. \"Coming to the bookstore once a week on a Saturday or after school is a totally normal, totally fun thing to do.\" 17 bookstores in Wisconsin also received the bonus money. Patterson's Holiday Bookstore Bonus program gave away $300,000 to independent bookstores nationwide. To see all the booksellers who received the prize, click here .",
