    "text": "Winner (3-0) against Dinan-Lehon (N2) this Sunday during its 32nd final of the Coupe de\nFrance, Stade de Reims escaped thanks in particular to a double from Mamadou Diakhon (18 years old). After the game, Will Still threw a dig at his young player, not necessarily aware of his abilities.\nMamadou Diakhon took advantage of the Coupe de\nFrance to score his first professional goals. Opposed to Dinan-Lehon (N2) during a 32nd final, Stade de Reims avoided the trap (3-0) thanks in particular to a double from its 18-year-old winger. After the game, Will Still praised Diakhon’s double, while throwing a little dig at him.\nWith the African Cup of Nations and the Asian Cup in January, the Reims club must find solutions. “It’s important because we don’t have much choice. They’re going to have to play, they’re going to have playing time,” Still commented when speaking of his young talents. “Diakhon, from time to time, you have to slap him behind the ear so that he wakes up and realizes the talent he has.”\n“You have to know how to translate it into Ligue 1”\nAt the start of the season, Mamadou Diakhon participated in four Ligue 1 matches, for a cumulative playing time of 52 minutes. “Today he was able to be decisive, score two interesting goals, congratulations to him. Now it’s good to do it in the Cup, we also have to know how to translate it into Ligue 1, that’s why he’s in the club,” Still said.\n“We will support him, push him to be able to do that in Ligue 1 matches,” Still continued about Diakhon. “It’s good to help young people. But we don’t have 1000 solutions either, that’s what they’re there for, we’re going to use them.”\nNext Saturday, Reims will go to Monaco for the 18th day of Ligue 1. Halfway through, the Champenois occupy eighth position in the standings. Among those absent, the Japanese Junya Ito and Keito Nakamura will notably be missing in the offensive sector. Enough to undoubtedly give Diakhon the opportunity to express himself after his double.\n2024-01-07 21:19:01\n#Reims #Stills #motivational #boost #Diakhon #author #double #Coupe #\nFrance",

    "text": "Last Updated on\nThe M3 chips are another notch in Apple’s belt, providing incredible performance for their latest line of MacBooks. However, it looks like competition is about to become fierce, as the Snapdragon X Elite chips that are on their way seemingly perform better than the flagship M3.\nTechRadar was able to test out the X Elite chips from Qualcomm, and by the looks of it, Apple is about to have some major competition on its hands. The chip performed incredibly when running 2023’s Game of the Year, Baldur’s Gate 3. It played at a stable 30 FPS with a 1200p resolution on a custom medium-low graphics setting. Alone, these stats aren’t that impressive. But, the game was being emulated on the chip. For being an emulation on a lightweight notebook, and with the scalability of the Snapdragon X Elite chips on these lightweight platforms, this is a remarkable performance.\nApple is about to have some major competition for its M3 chips with the Snapdragon X Elite\nA major problem in the past for these SoC chips is that they run on ARM-based technology. A majority of Windows apps run on x86 instead, meaning many applications can’t run natively on the\nSnapdragon X Elite chips. This has proved majorly limiting so far, but the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite is looking to change this.\nAs touted by Qualcomm, a wide range of apps and programs will soon be Windows on ARM compatible. This, along with the further development of the technology, could be game-changing when it comes to the Snapdragon X Elite chips beating out the M3 from Apple.\nThe Snapdragon X Elite chips from Qualcomm are set to make their debut sometime in mid-2024. With this time fast approaching, we’re incredibly excited to see just what the SoC chip is capable of. Apple may finally get beaten at the game if these X Elite chips deliver.",

    "text": "Karolina Muchova has been dealt a fresh setback in her preparations to rejoin the WTA Tour in 2024. The crafty Czech woman becomes the first high-profile absentee of next month’s [Australian Open](https://lastwordonsports.com/tennis/australian-open). In a gut-wrenching post she shared on Instagram, Muchova revealed that she is still experiencing pain in her right wrist, the same one she injured in her run to the [US Open](https://lastwordonsports.com/tennis/us-open) semifinal last September. The 27-year-old hasn’t been able to play since losing to eventual tournament champion Coco Gauff. [Muchova wrote](https://www.instagram.com/p/C1aA7ixtYHr/), “Hi, fans and friends. This isn’t my favorite thing to share, especially at the start of a new season, but unfortunately, the pain in a wrist came back in the middle of my tennis preparation.” Karolina Muchova’s wrist injury is not healed yet as she withdraws from the Australian Open 2024 [pic.twitter.com/3aEB1qQ0mR] — Melanie Lautrup (@melanie_lautrup) [December 28, 2023] She added that she would “postpone” her comeback without giving any details or timelines. Her primary objective remains to play pain-free, and she will now focus on getting the required treatment for the debilitating injury. It is far from an ideal situation for Muchova, who has suffered a spate of injuries in the past, that she hardly tapped her real potential. But everything clicked into place in 2023, including her health. Muchova reached a maiden Grand Slam final at the French Open in June, where she came within a few games from shocking Iga Swiatek. That run served as a catalyst in her Top 10 breakthrough – a place where tennis onlookers believe is where she belonged. However, the injury curse struck again. At the height of her peak, Muchova was forced to miss the WTA Finals in Cancun, where she qualified for the first time. She was also unavailable for selection in the Czechia team that lost in the Billie Jean King Cup semifinals in November because of injury. She was scheduled to play in the star-studded WTA 500 tournament in Brisbane in the opening week of the new season but pulled out ahead of schedule. That probably was the first indication she was going to miss the 2024 Australian Open. Main Photo Credit: Susan Mullane-USA TODAY Sports",

    "title": "L'Oreal heir becomes first woman with $100 billion fortune",
    "text": "Francoise Bettencourt Meyers became the first woman to amass a $100 billion fortune this week, marking another milestone for the heiress and for France's expanding fashion and cosmetics industries. Her wealth jumped to $100.2 billion on Thursday, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The milestone came as shares of L'Oréal SA, the beauty products empire founded by her grandfather, rose to a record high, with the stock set for its best year since 1998.\nDespite the gain, Bettencourt Meyers' fortune is still significantly less than that of French compatriot Bernard Arnault, founder of luxury goods purveyor LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE, who was second in the global ranking with $179.4 billion as of Wednesday's close. France's growing domination of luxury retail has spawned several other ultra-rich families, including the clan behind Hermes International SCA, who have amassed Europe's largest family fortune, and the Wertheimer brothers who own Chanel.\nThe reclusive Bettencourt Meyers, 70, is vice-chair of the board of L'Oréal, a globe-spanning €241 billion ($268 billion) company in which she and her family are the single biggest shareholders with a stake of nearly 35%. Her sons, Jean-Victor Meyers and Nicolas Meyers, are also directors. Run by executives from outside the family for decades, the firm was founded in 1909 by Bettencourt Meyers' chemist grandfather, Eugene Schueller, to produce and sell a hair dye he had developed.\nBettencourt Meyers keeps her life private, shunning the glitzy social life sought by many the world's wealthy. She has written two books — a five-volume study of the Bible and a genealogy of the Greek gods — and is known for playing piano for hours every day.\nStock rebound As an only child, Bettencourt Meyers came into her wealth following the 2017 death of her mother, Liliane Bettencourt, with whom she had an at times contentious relationship. A legal battle in the aughts grew from a family feud to a political scandal that centered on whether the elderly mother was fit to manage the family's wealth. Last month, Netflix Inc. came out with a three-part documentary, L'Affaire Bettencourt, relating the saga that featured a former French president and secret recordings made by a butler.\nL'Oréal grew rapidly in the decade leading up to the pandemic but took a hit during the health crisis when people under lockdown used less makeup. That was followed by a rapid rebound as consumers splurged on luxury items, sending the shares up 35% this year.\nThe company's stock could rise another 12% over the next year as its product and geographic diversity shows resilience, according to Consumer Edge Research analyst Brett Cooper.\nBettencourt Meyers also chairs her family's holding company, Téthys, which has the L'Oréal stake. Her husband, Jean-Pierre Meyers, is chief executive. In 2016, the two set up subsidiary Téthys Invest SAS, which bets on areas that don't compete with the company.\nWith the stated intention of making \"direct long-term investments in entrepreneurial projects,\" the CEO of Téthys Invest is Alexandre Benais, a former Lazard Ltd. investment banker.\nTéthys Invest recently acquired a stake in French insurance broker April Group. Last year, it bought into decade-old fashion brand Sezane, and has also invested in French private hospital operator Elsan. The firm is partly funded by L'Oréal dividends.\nWith assistance from Angelina Rascouet and Jack Witzig",

    "text": "Había muchas ganas de ver a Carolina Marín tras el sabor amargo que dejaron los Juegos Olímpicos de París y, por fin, Huelva ha podido encontrarse con su campeona y rendirle el homenaje que se merece. Ha sido este jueves en el Ayuntamiento de la capital onubense, hasta donde la volantista onubense se ha desplazado, primero para ser recibida por la alcaldesa, Pilar Miranda, y tener un encuentro con los medios de comunicación en el Salón de Plenos, y más tarde para saludar y dedicar unas palabras a sus paisanos desde uno de los balcones de la Casa Consistorial. Antes cientos de personas que se congregaron en la plaza de La Constitución y que recibieron a la volantista al son de las palmas onubenses y al grito de campeona, Marín recordaba con emoción sus comienzos: “En 2007 salí de Huelva rumbo a Madrid, en el coche de mis padres, con la intención de aprovechar una oportunidad que se me presentaba: podía entrenar con los mejores de España y un entrenador apostaba por mí para hacerme crecer. No sabía entonces que ya no volvería a vivir aquí, de momento. Atrás quedaban la avenida de Santa Marta, el pabellón Diego Lobato, mi casa y mi familia”. “Tenía muchos sueños por cumplir y he conseguido cumplir prácticamente todos. Lo que no sabía entonces aquella niña que salió de aquí es que un trocito de esta ciudad y de todos vosotros me acompañaría en Madrid y en cualquier lugar del mundo en el que estuviese”, añadía con emoción. Y por último, un deseo: “No sé que me deparará el futuro, quiero cuidarme, recuperarme bien y rodearme de los míos. Ojalá ese proceso me lleve a poder colgar la raqueta en una pista y que, si se dan las circunstancias, eso pueda suceder aquí, en nuestro Palacio de Deportes”. Y precisamente, la alcaldesa también aprovechaba la ocasión para recordar que el Ayuntamiento está gestionando la candidatura de Huelva como sede para albergar el Campeonato Europeo de Bádminton de 2026, un proyecto que, según la propia Miranda, sería “un homenaje al legado de Carolina Marín”.
