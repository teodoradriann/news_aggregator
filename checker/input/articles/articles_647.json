It is what most people have begun to use.</p>.<p>As it happens with every new popular trend, scamsters have found a way to utilise this trend to defraud people.

The app gains access to sensitive data, monitor activities, and can even hijack the phone’s functions.</p><p>Once they have access to your phone, fraudsters can also send messages to the victim’s contacts, requesting money or sensitive information, all while pretending to be the phone’s owner.</p>.Explained | What is a 'digital arrest' scam?.<p>DIG Mohit Chawla, Himachal Pradesh State CID and Cyber Crime Department, told <em>News18</em>, “If you receive an unsolicited wedding invitation or any file from an unknown number, do not click on it. Ensure you verify the sender and the file before downloading anything onto your phone.\\\"</p><p>He went on to add that one must still verify files sent by trusted contacts before downloading them.</p>.<p>The citizens must immediately report any cybercrime on helpline number 1930 or www.cybercrime.gov.in and follow 'CyberDost' channels or account on social media.</p>",

    "text": "President Nicolas Maduro has ordered Venezuela’s armed forces to conduct defensive exercises in the Eastern Caribbean after the UK sent a warship towards Guyana’s territorial waters as the South American neighbours dispute a large border region.\nIn a nationally televised address on Thursday, Mr Maduro said 6,000 Venezuelan troops, including air and naval forces, will conduct joint operations off the nation’s eastern coast — near the border with Guyana.\nMr Maduro described the impending arrival of British ship HMS Trent to Guyana’s shores as a “threat” to his country.\nHe argued the ship’s deployment violates a recent agreement between the South American nations.\n“We believe in diplomacy, in dialogue and in peace, but no one is going to threaten Venezuela,” Mr Maduro said in a room where he was accompanied by a dozen military commanders.\n“This is an unacceptable threat to any sovereign country in Latin America.”\nVenezuela and Guyana are involved in a border dispute over the Essequibo, a sparsely populated region the size of Florida with vast oil deposits off its shores.\nThe region has been under Guyana’s control for decades.\nBut in December, Venezuela relaunched its historical claim to the Essequibo through a referendum in which it asked voters in the country whether the Essequibo should be turned into a Venezuelan state.\nAs tensions over the region escalated, the leaders of both countries met in the Caribbean island of St Vincent and signed an agreement which said they would solve their dispute through nonviolent means.\nDuring the talks, however, Guyana’s President Irfan Ali said his nation reserved its right to work with its partners to ensure the defence of his country.\nOn Thursday, Guyanese officials described the visit of HMS Trent as a planned activity aimed at improving the nation’s defence capabilities and said the ship’s visit will continue as scheduled.\n“Nothing that we do or have done is threatening Venezuela,” Guyana’s vice-president Bharrat Jagdeo told reporters in Georgetown, the nation’s capital.\nHMS Trent is a patrol and rescue ship that was recently used to intercept drug traffickers off the West Coast of Africa.\nIt can accommodate up to 30 sailors and a contingent of 18 marines and is equipped with 30mm cannons and a landing pad for helicopters and drones.\nThe ship had been sent to Barbados in early December to intercept drug traffickers, but its mission was changed on December 24, when it was sent to Guyana.\nAuthorities did not specify when it was expected to arrive off Guyana’s shores.\nThe UK’s Ministry of Defence said the ship would be conducting joint operations with Guyana’s defence forces.\nThe nation of 800,000 people has a small military that is made up of 3,000 soldiers, 200 sailors and four small patrol boats known as Barracudas.",

    "text": "Significant severe weather continues across the South Tornadoes, damaging wind, large severe hail damage towns MELISSA ADAN (ABC) - More than 30 million Americans were threatened by severe weather across the southeast Thursday. Following several days of destructive storms across the central Plains and Midwest, deadly storms swept across the South. Nearly 100 tornadoes across 18 states have been reported or confirmed since Monday. The National Weather Service has confirmed this deadly tornado in Tennessee. It has been rated an EF-3 with winds up to 140mph. This storm devastated parts of the community. In Maury County, at least one person was killed and several others seriously hurt. Governor Bill Lee said “heartache from one side of the state to the other. We’re right here in Murray County, the hardest hit spot, as far as the tornado damage goes. Significant flooding all across the state”. West of Charlotte, North Carolina, one person was killed and another was hurt when a tree and live power lines fell on their SUV. Greg Beck witnessed the event and said “I heard somebody in there screaming and they were wanting help, and, I just, I just couldn’t get over to them. I wanted to, but I just couldn’t”. In Georgia, clean-up is underway after damaging winds and flooding devastated local communities before storms began to push toward Florida and the Gulf coast. While more severe weather is expected early Friday, storms are slowly winding down and exiting into the Gulf of Mexico. States hit hard by severe weather over the last few weeks are likely to be facing several months, potentially years, of rebuild in the aftermath. Copyright 2024 WHSV. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "KAMLOOPS, B.C. — Vancouver's Catholic Archbishop says a 'Sacred Covenant' agreement has been reached with the First Nation in Kamloops, B.C., that announced the discovery the remains of more than 200 children at the site of a former residential school. Archbishop J. Michael Miller of the Catholic archdiocese of Vancouver says the agreement with the Tk'emlúps te Secwépemc will open a \"new chapter\" in the relationship between the church and First Nations in B.C. Miller says the church recognizes its complicity in the Canadian government's colonialist policies toward First Nations and the \"resulting tragedies\" from the residential school system. Chief Rosanne Casimir of Tk'emlúps te Secwépemc says the covenant will see the church share records and information as the nation continues to investigate the site of a former Kamloops Indian Residential School where hundreds of children went missing. The nation announced in May 2021 that a search around the former school site using ground-penetrating radar found the unmarked burial sites of the remains of more than 200 children who were students at the school. The Nation and the archdiocese say the agreement includes commitments from the church on how to properly memorialize residential school survivors, information sharing about missing children and to offer \"healing services\" to family members of those who attended the school. This report by The Canadian Press was first published March 28, 2024. The Canadian Press",

    "text": "Pilotos de Aeroméxico podrían ir a huelga si no llegan a un acuerdo con la aerolínea (Foto: EFE/STR) Pilotos de Aeroméxico podrían ir a huelga en caso de no llegar a un acuerdo con la compañía en relación al contrato colectivo. Así lo confirmó la Asociación Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores de México (ASPA) .\nEl sindicato puntualizó que el emplazamiento a huelga está previsto para el primer minuto del 1 octubre , tal como lo establece el contrato colectivo.\nActualmente, ASPA está negociando con la línea aérea, en espera de llegar a un acuerdo mutuamente beneficioso.\n“En este momento nos encontramos en la etapa de negociación con la representación de la empresa con el objetivo de alcanzar beneficios mutuos”, señaló la asociación sindical en un comunicado emitido este 12 de septiembre.\nPosicionamiento de ASPA en el que se menciona la posible huelga (Foto: X/@aspaprensa) ASPA detalló que el proceso de revisión del contrato colectivo con la aerolínea ante el Tribunal Federal de Conciliación y Registro Laboral comenzó en julio, con el fin de cumplir con los procesos y tiempos marcados por la ley. Sin embargo, aún no llegan a un acuerdo con Aeroméxico, por lo que aseguró están abiertos a dialogar para lograrlo.\n“Los pilotos de ASPA de México reiteramos nuestra disposición al diálogo para llegar a acuerdos justos y concretar la revisión en tiempo y forma. En las siguientes semanas estaremos informando al respecto”, finalizó el sindicato.\n¿Por qué pilotos de Aeroméxico podrían ir a huelga? De acuerdo con medios especializados, el desacuerdo entre pilotos representados por ASPA y Aeroméxico está relacionado con el vencimiento del convenio COVID-2020 que está por vencer. Los trabajadores exigen la restitución de 400 millones de dólares y la recuperación de algunas prestaciones.\nPilotos de Aeroméxico exigen recuperar prestaciones que perdieron durante la pandemia (EFE/Nelly Salas) El Convenio COVID-2020 de Aeroméxico fue un acuerdo entre la aerolínea y sus sindicatos, incluyendo a ASPA y a la Asociación Sindical de Sobrecargos de Aviación de México (ASSA). Este convenio se firmó en medio de la pandemia del COVID-19, con el objetivo de enfrentar la crisis financiera derivada de la abrupta disminución en la demanda de vuelos.\nEl acuerdo incluyó medidas como la reducción temporal de salarios y prestaciones , así como cambios en las condiciones laborales de los trabajadores. Estas fueron diseñadas para ayudar a Aeroméxico a mantener su viabilidad financiera durante la pandemia y preservar la mayor cantidad de empleos posibles mientras se estabilizaba la situación del sector aéreo.",

    "text": "Some 33,000 union members walk off the job at factories in Seattle and Portland after rejecting pay offer. Boeing workers on the West Coast of the United States have voted overwhelmingly to strike in the latest blow to the beleaguered aircraft giant. Some 33,000 machinists at the company’s factories in Seattle and Portland, Oregon on Thursday voted to walk off the job from midnight after rejecting management’s latest offer for better pay and conditions. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) said that 94.6 percent of its members voted to reject the contract and 96 percent backed a strike. Boeing’s offer would have raised pay by 25 percent over four years, reduced workers’ share of healthcare bills, increased the company’s 401(k) contributions, and provided a $3,000 ratification bonus. The aircraft maker’s proposed deal also included a commitment to build its next jet at its facilities in greater Seattle after the company angered workers by moving production of the 787 Dreamliner to a non-unionised plant in South Carolina. Workers had sought a 40 percent wage rise, the restoration of a defined-benefit pension plan axed in 2014, and a stronger guarantee that future production would not be moved out of the Seattle region. Jon Holden, IAM’s lead negotiator in the contract talks, said workers had spoken “loud and clear”. “This is about respect, this is about addressing the past, and this is about fighting for our future,” Holden said. “We strike at midnight.” The strike, the first by Boeing workers since 2008, halts production of the best-selling 737 MAX and other aircraft as the company grapples with output delays, heavy financial losses and intense scrutiny of its safety record. The disruption comes just weeks after new Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg took the helm with a pledge to “reset” the company’s relations with the union. Ortberg had on Wednesday urged workers not to strike, warning it would “put our shared recovery in jeopardy, further eroding trust with our customers and hurting our ability to determine our future together”. Boeing said on Thursday that it is committed to “resetting our relationship” with its workers and the union. “And we are ready to get back to the table to reach a new agreement,” a spokesperson said. Adam Smith, a Democratic Party member of the House of Representatives representing Washington State, urged Boeing to do more for its employees, while calling on the sides to return to the negotiating table. “Across corporate America, so much of the wealth has wound up in the hands of so few people,” Smith said in a statement. “Large corporations have increasingly prioritised their own profits and shareholders at the expense of workers. It is crucial that Boeing behaves as a responsible steward for its employees, so that every employee at their company is respected with fair wages and working conditions.” Boeing, which employs some 150,000 people across the US, has been struggling to regain its footing since fatal crashes of the 737 Max in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people. In January, a mid-air blowout of a door plug on a 737 Max jet reignited questions about the company’s safety culture, prompting aviation authorities to put a cap on production of the aircraft. Boeing reported a $1.4bn loss in the April-June quarter, following a $355m net loss for the first three months of the year. The company last reported a profit – of $160m – in the second quarter of 2022.",

    "text": "Nelle ultime ore un dettaglio notato dai fan ha creato dei malumori verso Prince Harry e Meghan Markle. Infatti, sembra proprio che lui e la sua consorte siano stati etichettati come \\\"insensibili\\\" dopo aver posato con il primo ministro giamaicano. Questo nonostante il suo precedente brutale avvertimento di quattro parole al principe William. Il principe Harry e Meghan Markle, a questo proposito, sono apparsi a sorpresa ieri sera alla proiezione giamaicana di Bob Marley: One Love. Il Duca e la Duchessa di Sussex hanno posato accanto al Primo Ministro giamaicano Andrew Holness , che in precedenza ha condiviso i suoi piani per rendere la Giamaica una repubblica. Ciò ha portato gli utenti dei social media a definire la coppia reale \\\"insensibile\\\". Ricorderanno in molti la \\\"brutale\\\" conversazione di Holness con il principe William nel 2022, che già all'epoca scosse gli animi. Durante il tour dei Caraibi di William e di Kate Middleton nel 2022, il signor Holness aveva reso noti alla coppia i suoi piani. Affrontano, non a caso e in in modo scioccante la coppia, un argomento a loro molto caro. Ovvero sia: \\\"Noi in Giamaica stiamo andando avanti e intendiamo vivere come un paese indipendente, sviluppato e prospero\\\".
