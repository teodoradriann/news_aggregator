The property, formerly owned by a beloved local hair salon owner named Peg, caught their attention with its character and prime location.\nThe couple saw the purchase as both an investment and a way to contribute to the neighborhood they love and where they operate a gift shop, Hampton & Co . After taking ownership, they embarked on an extensive renovation, upgrading electrical and plumbing, and preserving original features while adding modern, luxurious touches.\nShortly after acquiring the property, they partnered with a local resident, Jim Arnoldt, who had a vision of opening an Irish pub. Arnoldt launched The Snug , an intimate pub located in front of The Prescott, with the rental home situated just behind it. The Prescott, reimagined in 2024, offers two elegantly designed bedrooms, a spa-like bathroom, and a modern kitchen. The home is fully furnished with custom drapery, designer furniture, and artwork from local artists.\n“We have chosen every design feature ourselves including the cabinets, carpet, wallpaper, beds, lighting fixtures, artwork and draperies,” Adam said.\nGuests can enjoy outdoor living spaces including a front porch and a private fenced backyard, complete with a multi-level deck and seating for up to 11 people. The Prescott provides private parking for two vehicles, with additional street parking available. Visitors are encouraged to explore the historic Irvington neighborhood, known for hosting the country’s longest consecutively run Halloween festival.\n“My mom took me to see “Scream,” the movie where we were certain that the blonde, Drew Barrymore would be the star, but it ended up being Sydney, the brunette who took charge and overcame and triumphed,” Adam said. “My mom and I left the movie so excited. It’s the only movie I will continue to watch over and over. If I have a battle to endure, I think of Sydney Prescott.”\nThe Snug operates six days a week, offering a cozy place for guests to grab a pint, with operating hours from Monday through Saturday. Guests have full access to The Prescott, with the exception of the basement.\n(Provided Photo/DK Eckhardt Photography) RELATED:\nAirbnb Icons category brings pop culture fans’ dreams to life Horror-themed Airbnb and café in Fountain Square to leave guests staying scared 21 Indiana Airbnbs to rent for a unique vacation Trending stories Indiana sues used-auto dealer for odometer fraud 34-year-old dies in crash of dump truck, pickup",

    "text": "Agencies\nArtificial intelligence is poised to upend much of society, removing human limitations inherent in many systems. One such limitation is information and logistical bottlenecks in decision-making.\nTraditionally, people have been forced to reduce complex choices to a small handful of options that don’t do justice to their true desires. Artificial intelligence has the potential to remove that limitation. And it has the potential to drastically change how democracy functions.\nAI researcher Tantum Collins and I, a public-interest technology scholar, call this AI overcoming “lossy bottlenecks.” Lossy is a term from information theory that refers to imperfect communications channels – that is, channels that lose information.\nMultiple-choice practicality\nImagine your next sit-down dinner and being able to have a long conversation with a chef about your meal. You could end up with a bespoke dinner based on your desires, the chef’s abilities and the available ingredients. This is possible if you are cooking at home or hosted by accommodating friends.\nBut it is infeasible at your average restaurant: The limitations of the kitchen, the way supplies have to be ordered and the realities of restaurant cooking make this kind of rich interaction between diner and chef impossible. You get a menu of a few dozen standardized options, with the possibility of some modifications around the edges.\nThat’s a lossy bottleneck. Your wants and desires are rich and multifaceted. The array of culinary outcomes are equally rich and multifaceted. But there’s no scalable way to connect the two.\nPeople are forced to use multiple-choice systems like menus to simplify decision-making, and they lose so much information in the process.\nPeople are so used to these bottlenecks that we don’t even notice them. And when we do, we tend to assume they are the inevitable cost of scale and efficiency.\nAnd they are. Or, at least, they were.\nThe possibilities\nArtificial intelligence has the potential to overcome this limitation. By storing rich representations of people’s preferences and histories on the demand side, along with equally rich representations of capabilities, costs and creative possibilities on the supply side, AI systems enable complex customization at scale and low cost.\nImagine walking into a restaurant and knowing that the kitchen has already started work on a meal optimized for your tastes, or being presented with a personalized list of choices.There have been some early attempts at this. People have used ChatGPT to design meals based on dietary restrictions and what they have in the fridge.\nIt’s still early days for these technologies, but once they get working, the possibilities are nearly endless. Lossy bottlenecks are everywhere.\nTake labor markets. Employers look to grades, diplomas and certifications to gauge candidates’ suitability for roles. These are a very coarse representation of a job candidate’s abilities.\nAn AI system with access to, for example, a student’s coursework, exams and teacher feedback as well as detailed information about possible jobs could provide much richer assessments of which employment matches do and don’t make sense.\nOr apparel. People with money for tailors and time for fittings can get clothes made from scratch, but most of us are limited to mass-produced options.\nAI could hugely reduce the costs of customization by learning your style, taking measurements based on photos, generating designs that match your taste and using available materials.\nIt would then convert your selections into a series of production instructions and place an order to an AI-enabled robotic production line.\nOr software. Today’s computer programs typically use one-size-fits-all interfaces, with only minor room for modification, but individuals have widely varying needs and working styles. AI systems that observe each user’s interaction styles and know what that person wants out of a given piece of software could take this personalization far deeper, completely redesigning interfaces to suit individual needs.\nRemoving democracy’s bottleneck\nThese examples are all transformative, but the lossy bottleneck that has the largest effect on society is in politics. It’s the same problem as the restaurant.\nAs a complicated citizen, your policy positions are probably nuanced, trading off between different options and their effects. You care about some issues more than others and some implementations more than others.\nIf you had the knowledge and time, you could engage in the deliberative process and help create better laws than exist today. But you don’t. And, anyway, society can’t hold policy debates involving hundreds of millions of people.\nSo you go to the ballot box and choose between two – or if you are lucky, four or five – individual representatives or political parties.\nImagine a system where AI removes this lossy bottleneck. Instead of trying to cram your preferences to fit into the available options, imagine conveying your political preferences in detail to an AI system that would directly advocate for specific policies on your behalf. This could revolutionize democracy.\nOne way is by enhancing voter representation. By capturing the nuances of each individual’s political preferences in a way that traditional voting systems can’t, this system could lead to policies that better reflect the desires of the electorate.\nFor example, you could have an AI device in your pocket – your future phone, for instance – that knows your views and wishes and continually votes in your name on an otherwise overwhelming number of issues large and small.\nCombined with AI systems that personalize political education, it could encourage more people to participate in the democratic process and increase political engagement.\nAnd it could eliminate the problems stemming from elected representatives who reflect only the views of the majority that elected them – and sometimes not even them.\nOn the other hand, the privacy concerns resulting from allowing an AI such intimate access to personal data are considerable.\nAnd it’s important to avoid the pitfall of just allowing the AIs to figure out what to do: Human deliberation is crucial to a functioning democracy.\nAlso, there is no clear transition path from the representative democracies of today to these AI-enhanced direct democracies of tomorrow. And, of course, this is still science fiction.\nFirst steps\nThese technologies are likely to be used first in other, less politically charged, domains. Recommendation systems for digital media have steadily reduced their reliance on traditional intermediaries. Radio stations are like menu items: Regardless of how nuanced your taste in music is, you have to pick from a handful of options.\n Copy 28/12/2023 10",

    "title": "Activists, Authors, and Librarians Are Beating Back LGBTQ+ Book Bans",
    "text": "Making sure LGBTQ+ stories are still heard.\nBy Sara Youngblood Gregory\nJournalist and Writer\nIntroduction It’s not hard to read between the lines of the recent surge in book bans. These efforts are a manifestation of a confluence of political ideology, latent cultural anxieties over difference, and targeted attempts to stanch the flow of alternative knowledge.\nSince 2021, PEN America has recorded nearly 6,000 cases of book bannings—a staggering number on the rise. In just the first half of the 2022–’23 school year, PEN America saw a 28% increase in bans compared to the previous six months. A striking 36% percent of bans targeted books written for and by the LGBTQ community.\n“The real power of a book is that they open up a different world to readers. And what people want to ban is our worlds and our lives,” says Julie R. Enzser, Ph.D., editor and publisher of the lesbian literary and art journal Sinister Wisdom . “Book bans are a concrete strategy [used] by folks who are interested in denying the existence of LGBTQ people and people of color who have ideas that challenge white hegemony.”\nBook bans—which describe any action taken to limit access to a book—can happen through a variety of channels. On a local level, parents or an individual may decide to challenge a book in their local libraries or schools, triggering a review of the titles, and often their removal from shelves. Regardless of the motivation behind these complaints, the impact is undeniable: In Florida, 100 books were pulled from county shelves in a single year following the complaints of a single man. There are also organized, large-scale efforts from far-right parent groups like Moms for Liberty, which lobbies school districts and officials to oppose curriculum and books that are LGBTQ inclusive or related to critical race theory.\nThe targeting of books by and about LGBTQ people and people of color isn’t new—author George M. Johnson, who wrote about growing up as a Black queer man in the oft-banned 2020 memoir All Boys Aren’t Blue , has spoken openly about the connections between censorship and extremism . But what is new is the pure scale of these book bans—and their symbiotic relationship with conservative and anti-LGBTQ legislation.\n“The bans and challenges are resulting in proposed legislation or [passed] legislation,” says Leigh Hurwitz, the collections manager at Brooklyn Public Library. “They are targeting lists of hundreds of books in some cases. [It’s] not just a single person coming to a PTA meeting talking about a single book.”\nIn 2021, the Oklahoma state senate, for example, introduced a bill that would ban all books that dealt with sex, sexuality, and gender identity from public school libraries. More recently in Utah, a proposed bill could criminalize access to “objectively sensitive” materials and books—allowing public school employees to be charged with a misdemeanor if banned books are found in their classrooms. Meanwhile in Florida, some school districts are pulling hundreds of books from the shelves due to recent, and incredibly vague, state laws. At the same time, states all over the country are introducing legislation that targets queer, and especially trans, access to education, health care, and other basic human rights.\nLGBTQ youth are particularly vulnerable to book bans, as they may not have the means to buy, find, or keep a book outside their school or public library. And while some book bans are being taken to court by publishers, authors, and advocacy groups, most young people can’t afford to wait for slow-moving legal action. Given the stakes, the role of librarians, publishers, and grassroots organizers are critical in the fight to maintain access to these cherished queer and trans stories.\nLibraries as a Lifeline The first line of defense is libraries. For Hurwitz, there are two main strategies for protecting book access—administrative and communal. Libraries have policies to handle bans, but often these procedures aren’t being used. “In many cases, books are just taken off the shelf once someone complains, and that’s not what should be happening,” says Hurwitz. Clear, protective policies are needed so that librarians can field complaints and point to a systemic response. And there are organizations there to help—the American Librarian Association offers confidential support and free consulting services for libraries and individuals navigating a ban.\nAt the same time, libraries are also urgent sites for youth organizing, which is why Hurwitz helped develop Books Unbanned through the Brooklyn Public Library. Launched in 2022, Books Unbanned provides youth all over the country with free, no-questions-asked access to the library’s entire digital collection, as well as access to book clubs, a podcast, and intellectual freedom forums. Recently, the program also launched the Freedom to Read Teen Ambassadors training, where youth can learn hands-on advocacy skills and fight censorship through civic engagement.\n“Teens are so aware that books are extremely powerful for learning more about themselves and the world. They’re a force for change,” says Hurwitz. By leveraging youth engagement, libraries and programs like Books Unbanned empower the people most impacted by bans to speak out and advocate for their right to read.\nBeyond the Shelves Still, access to queer and trans stories can’t rely solely on institutions—independent publishers, informal advocacy networks, and tight-knit social groups all create vital points of access.\nSinister Wisdom , for example, not only publishes new lesbian writing, but also recontextualizes and redistributes rare, formerly out-of-print works through its Sapphic Classic series , which has published works by banned author Audre Lorde, as well as authors like Pat Parker, Judy Grahn, and Beth Brant. In this way, access to LGBTQ texts isn’t just about fighting a wave of book bans. It’s about challenging a publishing landscape that allows vital LGBTQ books to fall out of distribution in the first place. Likewise, Sinister Wisdom offers an archive of issues dating back to 1976 and free books for incarcerated women.\n“What we’re really trying to do is bring people together to organize around books, to talk about books, but also to really know one another and to really expand our sense of what it means to be a lesbian in the world today,” says Enzser. “We always need to bring back stories from our history to talk about our future.”\nOthers look towards the internet. Trans Reads , an independently run online database, was launched in 2019 by Ash*, a trans woman and researcher, after she realized there was no centralized location for free, trans-related texts.\n“We believe education should be free and knowledge shouldn’t be behind a paywall,” says Ash. There are dozens of volunteers who manage the growing collection of more than 2,000 texts, and the estimated 120,000 yearly visitors to the site. And the independence of sites like Trans Reads makes them less susceptible to pressure by school administrators, lawmakers, or parents to remove books. Simply put, anyone can access banned books on Trans Reads any time, for free.\nThe project is dedicated to Leslie Feinberg—a butch lesbian, author, and transgender activist who released the 20th-anniversary edition of hir canonical, banned novel Stone Butch Blues for free in 2014 shortly before hir death. “The novel was a way for trans, gender nonconforming, and queer people to realize ourselves. It told us we aren’t alone,” says Ash.\nLike Ash, Kayleigh Lassonde was changed by this single banned queer book. In 2023, a friend gifted Lassonde a copy of Stone Butch Blues— a text Lassonde was always drawn to, but felt hesitant to read alone. “The idea of experiencing and reading the book alongside fellow butches made the content feel significantly more approachable,” says Lassonde. Inspired by Feinberg, Lassonde launched Butch Nook in February 2024, a New York City–based book club for butch, stud, and masc-identifying folks. The first book discussion welcomed 23 people and since launch, 70 people have filled out the interest form.\n“Right now in the United States we are in a moment of extreme censorship and historical erasure. There are people working at this very moment to remove as much evidence of queer and trans existence from the law as they can,” says Lassonde. “At the Butch Nook we are providing space and resources for butches to not only read and discuss censored literature, but to understand what meaningful solidarity looks like. The group may bring people together through our shared identity, but our purpose goes beyond the issues of the butch community. We believe that none of us are free until all of us are free.”\nTaken together, these strategies—protective, institutional policies in libraries; intentional youth development; and independent trans- and queer-led literary projects—work to create a world in which queer and trans stories aren’t just accessible, but abundant.\n10 Banned LGBTQ Books for Your Reading List The author and the sources they spoke to for this article have curated a reading list of their recommendations for oft-banned books by, for, and about LBGTQ people. Bring a bit more color to your spring reading list by adding these titles:\nGender Queer by Maia Kobabe\nGender Queer: A Memoir , by Maia Kobabe Maia Kobabe’s Gender Queer is one of my personal favorite banned books. Kobabe has been at the forefront of censorship and we always need more youth-oriented comics and literature like eir graphic novel! – Ash, Trans Reads\nWhen Aidan became a Brother , by Kyle Lukoff Calvin , by JR and Vanessa Ford Although literature by, for, and about trans youth has historically been overwhelmingly white, new books like When Aidan Became a Brother by Kyle Lukoff and Calvin by JR and Vanessa Ford speak to the stories of trans kids of color. Unfortunately, these books are almost immediately targeted with bans upon publication. – Ash, Trans Reads\nThe Magic Fish , by Trung Le Nguyen This award-winning YA graphic novel roots itself in the past, the present, and the timeless realm of fairy tales. Every night since he was a kid, Tiến and his mother, Hiền, have read each other fairy tales from the local library, a tradition that continues through to Tiến’s adolescence. Told from both of their perspectives, we see them learn about each other through stories: Tiến’s grappling with how to come out as gay and Hiền’s omnipresent memories of the family she left behind in Vietnam. Check it out now at Brooklyn Public Library! – Leigh Hurwitz, Books Unbanned\nFun Home: A Family Tragicomic , by Alison Bechdel Bechdel’s rich graphic novel about growing up in a funeral home, coming out, and thinking about her father’s homosexuality is a romp through queer literary culture and contemporary lesbian communities. It is wonderful in every way. – Julie R. Enszer, Sinister Wisdom\nThe Color Purple , by Alice Walker The Color Purple is a novel written in letters about two sisters, Celie and Nettie, in rural Georgia. It is gorgeous and difficult and challenging and provocative—and it won multiple awards when it was published and continues to delight audiences today, not only as a novel but also as a film and stage play. Our lives would be diminished immeasurably if we could not read and grapple with The Color Purple . – Julie R. Enszer, Sinister Wisdom\nStone Butch Blues , by Leslie Feinberg Originally published in 1993, Stone Butch Blues tells the life of Jess, a stone butch living a working-class life in 1950s New York. Banned shortly after its publication, Stone Butch Blues is a call to action, exploring identity, violence, transgender and lesbian community, and the power of organizing. – Sara Youngblood Gregory\nLawn Boy , by Jonathan Evison Lawn Boy tells the story of Mike Muñoz, a Chicano man living in Washington state, who, after getting fired from a dead-end landscaping job, is trying to figure out exactly what the American dream means for him. With humor and wit, Lawn Boy explores capitalism, class, discrimination, and sexuality. It’s the perfect coming-of-age novel for readers of any age. – Sara Youngblood Gregory\nLast Night at the Telegraph Club , by Malinda Lo This book is at the top of my list for its emphasis on historical and cultural detail—you’ll feel immersed in 1950s San Francisco, Chinatown, and the lesbian bars of the era as Lily Hu, the main character, explores her sexuality. Last Night at the Telegraph Club was also the first YA book with a queer woman as the main character to win the National Book Award.",
