    "text": "El obispo de Segorbe-Castellón alerta que \"está en crisis entender la vida como vocación\"\nEl obispo, monseñor Casimiro López Llorente, analiza en su carta dominical la falta de vocaciones\nCastellón - Publicado el\n3 min lectura\nEl Congreso Nacional de Vocaciones centra la carta dominical que el obispo de la diócesis de Segorbe-Castellón dirige a todos los fieles:\n\"Hace unos días hemos celebrado en Madrid el Congreso nacional de Vocaciones. Juntos nos pusimos a la escucha del Señor, para profundizar en la pregunta que el Papa Francisco nos hace en su Exhortación Christus Vivit (n. 286): “¿Para quién soy yo?”. Nos preocupa la falta de vocaciones al sacerdocio y a la vida consagrada. Pero sobre todo nos preocupa que la existencia no se entienda y viva como vocación. Esto ocurre en todos los ámbitos sociales. Está en crisis entender la vida como vocación, y con ello la comprensión de lo que somos. La cultura actual propone un modelo de ‘hombre sin vocación’, totalmente autónomo, señor de su vida y existencia, sin apertura ni referencia alguna a Dios, donde cada cual opta o elige un camino según sus propios deseos. Esto ocurre también en la Iglesia al plantear el futuro de niños y jóvenes.\nEl Congreso ha mostrado que una comprensión creyente de la persona nos descubre que todos recibimos de Dios una vocación y una misión. “Dios creó al hombre a su imagen y semejanza” (Gn 1,27). Dios, que es amor (1Jn 4,16), nos crea por amor a su imagen y semejanza. Nuestra identidad más profunda es que Dios llama a cada uno a la vida por amor para una existencia plena y dichosa en el amor. Este es nuestro origen y nuestro destino en el plan de Dios: somos llamados a la existencia por amor, para amar y ser amados, y llegar así a la plenitud del amor de Dios en vida la eterna. Cristo nos muestra que el verdadero amor consiste en la donación y entrega total por el bien de los demás.\nLa vocación es un don que se recibe y se entrega. Toda vocación nace en Dios y es una llamada para donarse a los demás. La vocación no es una elección personal basada en intereses propios, sino un don gratuito que ha de acogerse con agradecimiento y vivirse como respuesta agradecida al amor de Dios y no como conquista personal. Dios llama por amor y su llamada envía a extender el amor. La vocación se descubre en la amistad con Jesús. ”Ya no os llamo siervos, sino amigos” (Jn 15,15). Esta amistad nos define como cristianos, transforma nuestra vida y nos impulsa a vivir en comunión de amor con Dios para los demás. Esta amistad se cultiva especialmente en la oración. Una pastoral vocacional debe centrarse en fomentar la amistad con Cristo y ayudar a cada persona a descubrir su lugar en la comunidad cristiana.\nEn la Iglesia hay y conviven diversas vocaciones: la sacerdotal, la consagrada, la laical y la matrimonial, cada una con su riqueza y especificidad, al servicio de las demás. Cada vocación contribuye a la misión común de extender el Reino de Dios. Todos hemos sido llamados por el Espíritu a la plenitud de la vida cristiana: la santidad, cada uno según su propia vocación y misión\".",

SO HERE’S THE LATEST WINTER STORM WATCH, IN EFFECT FROM NOON SATURDAY UNTIL MIDNIGHT SUNDAY. JUST SOUTH OF THE OMAHA METRO. INCLUDES CASS COUNTY, LANCASTER COUNTY, ALL THE WAY DOWN INTO KANSAS AND MISSOURI. SO THE BIGGEST IMPACTS LIKELY JUST SOUTH OF THE METRO AREA. THAT’S ALSO WHERE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT SNOWFALL LIKELY WILL BE. HERE’S THE LATEST SNOW FORECAST 6 TO 12IN POSSIBLE REALLY FROM NEBRASKA CITY SOUTH AND MORE LIKELY CLOSER TO THAT 12 INCH RANGE. MARYVILLE, FALLS CITY AUBURN PAWNEE CITY OUT TOWARD BEATRICE AND THEN DOWN INTO KANSAS AND NORTHWEST MISSOURI TOWARDS SAINT JOE AND THE KANSAS CITY AREA. SO REALLY, THIS STRETCH OF I-29, ONCE YOU GET INTO FAR SOUTHWEST IOWA, INTO MISSOURI, VERY TREACHEROUS TRAVEL, IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE. BY THE TIME WE GET TO SUNDAY MORNING, LIKELY GOING TO BE A TIGHT GRADIENT TO THE NORTH. SO A DROP OFF QUICKLY AND SNOW TOTALS. WE COULD HAVE 4 TO 6IN PLATTSMOUTH IN MOST OF THE METRO AREA, 2 TO 4IN WHAT I’M THINKING RIGHT NOW WITH MOST OF THAT FALLING SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY MORNING. SO HERE’S THE SETUP STORM PREDICTOR. THIS IS SATURDAY, 5:00 LOW DEVELOPING. SEEING THOSE SNOW BANDS DEVELOP OVERNIGHT WITH THE BIGGER SNOW BANDS SOUTH OF THE METRO. SO WE’RE SEEING MORE OF THAT SIGNIFICANT SNOW LATER SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THE MORNING ON SUNDAY. AND WHAT WE’LL BE WATCHING ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THIS IS THE IMPACT OF DRY AIR, BECAUSE THIS COMES INTO THE METRO AREA THAT COULD CUT OFF OUR SNOW FAIRLY QUICKLY SUNDAY MORNING, BUT MORE LIKELY CONTINUING THROUGH THE AFTERNOON. AND THAT WINTER STORM WATCH ZONE BEFORE IT MOVES OUT. SO AGAIN, INCREASING IMPACTS LIKELY SATURDAY NIGHT AND THROUGH THE DAY ON SUNDAY. WITH THOSE BIGGEST IMPACTS OFF TO THE SOUTH, THE MAIN SYSTEM THAT’S GOING TO BRING THAT WINTER STORM JUST OFF THE WEST COAST, MOVING ON SHORE TODAY. AND WHAT WE’LL BE WATCHING IS IF THE STORM TRACK MOVES AT ALL OR IF IT STAYS CONSISTENT, BECAUSE IF IT MOVES NORTH OR SOUTH HERE OVER THE NEXT 48 HOURS, THAT COULD SHIFT THAT FOCUS OF HEAVIER SNOWFALL. SO THAT’S WHAT WE’LL BE WATCHING CLOSELY HERE IN THE COMING DAYS. THIS MORNING WE’VE GOT CLOUD COVER AROUND REALLY ON THE NEBRASKA SIDE OF THE RIVER. MORE CLEARING OFF TO THE EAST. AND THAT’S WHERE WE’RE SEEING MUCH COLDER TEMPERATURES. NINE IN DENISON, FIVE IN CARROLL COMPARED TO THE 20S FOR MOST OF EASTERN NEBRASKA, 21 RIGHT NOW IN OMAHA, A LITTLE BIT OF A BREEZE FEELS LIKE 11 AT EPPLEY SEVEN TEKAMAH LOOK AT THIS. FIVE BELOW ZERO HARLAN EIGHT BELOW ZERO IN CARROLL. SO QUITE COLD EARLY ON, MAYBE A PEAK OF SUNSHINE EARLY TODAY, BUT THE CLOUDS THINNING OUT FOR THE MOST PART. WE’LL SEE. HIGHS LOW TO MID 20S AND CAN’T RULE OUT A FEW FLURRIES AS WE GO THROUGH THE AFTERNOON. MOST HIGHS AROUND THE MID 20S IN OMAHA. COLDER UP TO THE NORTH AND COULD BE AROUND 30 TOWARD LINCOLN, NEBRASKA CITY IN FALL CITY. THAT’S THE CLOUD COVER RIGHT NO. LOOKING OUT FROM 72ND AND CROWN POINT STEPPING OUTSIDE RIGHT NOW 21 WITH THE NORTH BREEZE NEAR TEN MILES PER HOUR FEELS LIKE 11 DEGREES. SO HERE’S A CLOSER LOOK AT STORM PREDICTOR THROUGH TODAY. MAINLY CLOUDY AGAIN. CAN’T RULE OUT A STRAY FLURRY, MAYBE BRIEF LIGHT SNOW OUT CLOSER TO CENTRAL NEBRASKA. COLUMBUS AND YORK KEEPING THE CLOUDS AROUND OVERNIGHT SATURDAY STARTING DRY MORE LIKELY SEE A LITTLE LIGHT SNOW OFF TO THE WEST IN THE AFTERNOON, AND MAYBE A FEW FLURRIES, POSSIBLY SOME SPOTTY FREEZING DRIZZLE TO BEGIN BEFORE THE SNOW BANDS REALLY START TO DEVELOP. AS WE HEAD INTO SATURDAY NIGHT AND THEN CONTINUING INTO SUNDAY. SO SUNDAY WE’VE GOT THE SEVERE WINTER WEATHER ICON IN WITH THE BIGGEST IMPACTS THERE AND ESPECIALLY SOUTH OF THE METRO.

    "text": "Food News and Trends Celebrity & Entertainment Travis Kelce’s Favorite Childhood Food Is One of Our Most Popular Recipes It has the Travis (and Mama) Kelce stamp of approval!\nBy Bailey Fink Bailey Fink Bailey Fink is a devout home cook and assistant editor at Allrecipes. She has written over 200 stories covering everything from cooking methods and storage techniques to grocery shopping on a budget, how-to guides, product reviews, and important food-related news. Allrecipes' editorial guidelines Published on January 7, 2024 Trending Videos Photo: Getty Images/Allrecipes\nIt’s evident that Travis Kelce is a family man. Whether from his hilarious conversations with his brother, Jason, on their podcast “New Heights;” his adorable interactions with his niece, Wyatt; or the way he says sister-in-law Kylie is “the best a sister a guy could ever ask for,” we know Kelce loves his family.\nAnd, despite the running joke that Jason is her favorite son , Travis’ relationship with their mom, Donna, is one fans love to see.\nMama Kelce came into the spotlight in a big way during the 2023 Super Bowl, where Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis and Philadelphia Eagles center Jason became the first brothers to face off in the NFL championship. Since then, fans haven’t been able to get enough of Mama Kelce and her split Chiefs and Eagles merch—and, of course, her famous chocolate chip cookies .\nWhile Mama Kelce is her sons’ biggest fan, the boys are equally hers—with both Travis and Jason getting emotional talking about her on an episode of “New Heights” after the Super Bowl.\n“The moment I saw mom is when I got emotional,” Jason said, starting to tear up. “She was on top of the world for a week.”\n“She was the heavyweight champ, man,” Travis responded through tears. “She was on top of it, and she shined the whole time.”\nTravis Kelce's Favorite Childhood Recipe On their sports podcast, the Kelce brothers often reminisce on childhood memories. During a recent special holiday episode , they even brought their family on the podcast to discuss some of those memories.\nYou might recall during a 2022 Thanksgiving episode, Travis and Jason discussed what was and, more importantly, was not on their holiday table growing up. Shockingly, the Kelce family never had turkey because “we didn’t think turkey was very good,” Jason revealed. “Turns out, if you cook turkey really well, it tastes fantastic. We had that dry turkey.”\nBut, what the Kelce family seemingly lacks in cooking skills, Mama Kelce more than makes up for in her baking prowess. Yes, we know about the chocolate chip cookies, and even the cinnamon and marshmallow rolls , but a new favorite Mama Kelce recipe has officially entered the arena.\nDuring the 2023 holiday episode, the Kelce brothers asked their mom about her favorite Kelce family holiday traditions. She recalled the memory of her sons decorating the Christmas tree with her special ornaments—which she has since passed down to them. Travis and Jason agreed, but Travis added a favorite tradition of his own.\n“The one other one I definitely remember being a tradition was two batches of blueberry muffins,” he said. “That’s how I knew when to wake up. You [would] smell those things upstairs and just be like, ‘Oh, it is about to go down.’”\n“[Those] blueberry muffins were good,” Mama Kelce agreed. “They’ve got streusel on top.”\nUnlike her cookies and the Pillsbury rolls, Mama Kelce didn’t share her blueberry muffin recipe that Travis loves so much. However, streusel-topped blueberry muffins are sort of our specialty, thanks to this top-rated To Die For Blueberry Muffins recipe . While we can’t guarantee that it’s the one Mama Kelce used on Christmas morning, it is the one that more than 11,000 Allrecipes users have rated five stars—and the one that won our blueberry muffin taste test .\n“This was everything I could possibly want out of a blueberry muffin: plush, soft, and tender with a contrasting crunchy streusel topping,” writer Jesse Szewczyk said of the winning recipe.\nView the Recipe Kelce Family Holiday Traditions If you’re curious about the other foods on the Kelce’s holiday table, we’ve got the scoop on that, too. In addition to the muffins, rolls, and Honey Baked Ham , they served pork chops and chicken cutlets , according to Mama Kelce. For dessert? Peanut brittle .\nAnd, not just any peanut brittle, but the peanut brittle from See’s Candies , because that’s where their father, Ed, worked during the holiday season. The peanut brittle and See’s famous Toffee-ettes are both Kelce family favorites.\nBetween blueberry muffins, sweet rolls, and packages of See’s Candies, it sounds like the Kelce household was the place to be on Christmas Day.\nWas this page helpful?
