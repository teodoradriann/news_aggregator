    "title": "Some Muslim American advocates express hesitancy to work with the White House on strategy to counter Islamophobia - CBS News",
    "text": "Biden losing support amid Israel-Hamas war Biden losing support in Michigan, a state he won in 2020, over Israel-Hamas war response 03:46 The White House's push to create a strategy to counter Islamophobia is facing reluctance amid a spike in hate-fueled incidents against Arab and Muslim Americans since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel .\nCBS News spoke with several Muslim and Arab American advocates who voiced frustration with the Biden administration's response to the situation in Gaza , citing the increasing number of civilians that have been killed and President Biden stopping short of calling for a cease-fire.\nMuslim American advocate Salam Al-Marayati has worked with the Biden White House in the past. But despite the Biden administration's efforts to craft a strategy to counter Islamophobia in the U.S., he's skeptical about working with them in the future.\n\"At this moment in time, it is very hard to even imagine how a national strategy to counter Islamophobia will work, Al-Marayati, the president of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, which is also a member of the American Muslim Community Coalition, told CBS News. \"American Muslims here in the United States feel unsafe and unsupported as they witness the horrific attacks on Palestinians in Gaza. Muslim families, students, and employees are afraid to speak out for fear of retribution as many who have spoken out have faced retaliatory action including loss of employment, suspension, censorship, trolling, bullying, and targeted violence.\"\nPresident Joe Biden walks to the South Lawn before boarding Marine One and departing the White House on December 05, 2023 in Washington, DC. Anna Moneymaker / Getty Images The White House announced on Nov. 1 plans to develop a national strategy to counter Islamophobia, led by the Domestic Policy and National Security Councils. The proposal follows an announcement in May marking the federal government's first-ever National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism. Conversations and meetings on the development of the Islamophobia strategy date back a year, according to a senior administration official who said engagement with stakeholders in the community is ongoing with additional meetings scheduled for early next year. The effort is part of a White House interagency policy committee created in Dec. 2022 that focuses on countering antisemitism, Islamophobia and related types of discrimination.\n\"[The development of the strategy] should be really welcome news. I think the challenge is given what's going on and especially with the death toll and destruction rising and rising, people are understandably very hurt, angry, shocked [and] frustrated at America's involvement in this,\" said another source close to the discussions surrounding the development of the strategy. \"And so the timing of these two different things overlapping even though they are totally separate is really challenging. And unfortunately I don't know what will happen with the islamophobia strategy as a result.\"\nWhile some have expressed doubts, others say it is important to continue work on ways to counter hate and solve systemic discrimination problems that have targeted the Arab and Muslim communities for decades.\n\"We recognize, as do most other communities, that engaging on one issue doesn't mean that you are endorsing or accepting the White House's policies on that issue or any other issue,\" said Arsalan Suleman, who is board chair and co-founder of America Indivisible, a nonprofit dedicated to combating Islamophobia. \"So while I and many other community members have very strong criticisms of the current policy on Gaza, we certainly want to engage with the White House on the Islamophobia strategy, given its importance,\" Suleman added.\nAdvocates say a plan to counter Islamophobia in the U.S. is necessary after a spike in anti-Muslim sentiment following Hamas' Oct. 7 attack in Israel. But some question how effective the strategy could be and hesitate to take part in its development. A White House official told CBS News that administration officials are \"listening\" to the community and that the Biden administration remains committed to the development of a strategy.\n\"We've had engagements where community members have engaged on the strategy and have also been able to make their points clear about their positions on what's happening overseas in the course of those engagements while they've been focused primarily on the strategy,\" a senior administration official said. CBS News spoke to the staffer on background to talk candidly about the ongoing development of the strategy. \"We want to make sure that we are listening [and] so as a part of their communication with us, when they raise those issues, of course, we're listening to them. And many have made the point that what's happening overseas has an impact on what's happening in the United States in terms of Islamophobia,\" the official said.\nThe official insisted that support within the Arab and Muslim American community is strong, citing a letter from the American Muslim Community Coalition applauding the early November announcement.\n\"We commit to participating actively in the process of supporting the development of the strategy, and look forward to a comprehensive approach that addresses the various drivers of Islamophobia, including deep-rooted institutional manifestations that have plagued our communities for decades,\" the letter reads.\nThe White House hopes to complete its work on the strategy in late winter or spring.\nThe senior administration official also responded to criticism about the timing of the announcement explaining that the White House had planned to announce the development of the strategy well before the Hamas attack in October. Months of conversations and meetings with dozens of Muslim and Arab American groups pre-dated the attack, the official said. An increase in hate-fueled anti-Muslim incidents in the United States — including the deadly stabbing of a 6-year-old Palestinian American boy in the Chicago area — created a need to move forward with announcing the strategy, the official added.",

    "text": "Compositor Magno Santana revela como surgiu o sucesso ‘Lepo Lepo’: “Foi ideia minha”\nPor Redação\nO compositor Magno Santana contou, durante sua participação no podcast Sem Cortes, parceiro do Bahia Notícias, na última quarta-feira (22), como surgiu a música ‘Lepo Lepo’, de Psirico, o maior sucesso do Carnaval de 2014.\nAo lado do compositor Fábio Alcântara, Magno contou que a ideia do refrão da música surgiu enquanto assistia ao programa humorístico Escolinha do Professor Raimundo. “Ele tinha um bordão muito forte que era ‘Vapt Vupt’, você lembra disso? Aí veio na minha cabeça, ‘Lepo Lepo’, e aí eu: ‘Rapaz, vou fazer uma música assim”, explicou.\nO refrão da música ficou guardado durante cerca de um mês até encontrar com Felipe Escandurras, o co-compositor do sucesso, e completarem juntos a composição. “Tinha uma música que Márcio tinha gravado nossa que o nome era ‘Massagem’, aí a gente foi num churrasquinho na casa de Márcio e cantamos essa música [Lepo Lepo] e Márcio acreditou na música e falou: ‘Vou gravar essa aí’”, contou.\nA confirmação da origem da música vem após Márcio Victor afirmar no podcast PodPah que ideia de música teria vindo de sua parte. Segundo Márcio, a música teria surgido de um pedido específico dele que queria ir na contramão das músicas de ostentação famosas na época. “Aí mandei a ideia pros compositores, falei assim: ‘Ó véi, eu quero falar de uma música assim, assim e assado. Os caras levaram lá no estúdio, Felipe Escandurras e Magno”, afirmou.\nO Podcast Sem Cortes é apresentado por Jefrey Ataíde, todas as terças-feiras, a partir de 12h, no canal do Bahia Notícias, no Youtube.",

    "title": "2 Newton commissioners indicted on federal money laundering charges",
    "text": "The chairman of the Newton County Board of Commissioners and a local real estate agent recently elected to the board have been indicted by a federal grand jury on money laundering charges related to an allegedly corrupt real estate deal.\nMarcello Banes, 48, and Stephanie Lindsey, 52, were each charged with conspiring to launder money obtained by wire fraud and honest services wire fraud, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia Ryan K. Buchanan announced Thursday.\nBanes, an ordained minister, was elected to the Newton Board of Commissioners in 2016 and is the board’s first Black chairman, according to the county’s website. Lindsey is a lawyer and real estate broker who was elected as commissioner of Newton’s District 3 on June 18, ousting incumbent Alana Sanders.\nThe U.S. Department of Justice has accused Banes of using his position to influence the sale of a parcel of commercial property and taking a kickback from Lindsey. Lindsey received a $150,000 payment after the property sale but sent $100,000 of it to Banes, Buchanan said.\n“Public officials who undermine the public’s faith in our institutions by abusing their power for personal gain must be held accountable,” Buchanan said in a statement Thursday.\nIn a statement to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Banes denied the DOJ’s allegations.\n“I am deeply disappointed in the legal action taken today and look forward to clearing my name and demonstrating my good character,” he said. “With integrity and faith, I will deal with this legal matter and continue to work, honestly, for the citizens of Newton County. I am not going anywhere and deeply appreciate the support I am already receiving from family, friends and the citizens of our county.”\nLindsey also responded to the indictment, saying she looks “forward to the truth coming out in court. That truth is, as an attorney and a public servant of this county, I would not knowingly break any law.”\nThe key to the fraud was Banes’ position on the board for the Joint Development Authority (JDA) of Jasper, Newton, Morgan and Walton counties, according to the DOJ.\nThe JDA was established to create an industrial area between the four counties in order to attract more investment to the region; it is the entity that negotiated the land agreement for Rivian’s $5 billion electric vehicle factory last year. Rivian has since paused development of the factory, and the electric vehicle manufacturer is not involved in the DOJ’s case against Banes and Lindsey.\nThe JDA’s board of directors consists of two representatives from each county involved, and Banes was one of the representatives for Newton.\nIn 2018, a company listed in the indictment only as “Company A” showed interest in buying 40 acres of land belonging to the JDA, Buchanan said. Banes responded to Company A and set up a brokerage agreement between the company and Lindsey. Company A agreed to pay Lindsey $150,000 upon the completion of the sale, which required the JDA’s approval.\nAccording to Buchanan, the company’s representatives did not know that Banes was going to receive a kickback from Lindsey and would not have agreed to the deal if they’d found out.\nIn January 2019, Banes voted along with other JDA members to sell the parcel to Company A, the DOJ said. Banes never told anyone at the JDA that Company A had agreed to pay Lindsey upon the completion of the deal, per the indictment.\nWhen the sale was finalized, neither Lindsey nor her company were mentioned in the closing documents, and Lindsey was not present at closing, Buchanan said.\nAccording to the DOJ, Lindsey contacted Company A the day after the deal closed to collect the $150,000 payment. She then passed $100,000 of the payment to Banes through a newly created business entity, and Banes used most of the money on a new house he was building, Buchanan said.\nDuring the FBI’s investigation of the deal in 2023, Banes allegedly lied to the agents interviewing him, Buchanan said. The indictment announced Thursday charges Banes with making false statements to the FBI, in addition to his other charges.\nLindsey was also charged with federal income tax fraud, Buchanan said.\nIn a statement, the JDA distanced itself from the indictment, claiming it was “not a party to the transaction” described in the indictment and was not aware of any illegal activity on the part of Banes or Lindsey.\nThe JDA’s statement said it did approve a resolution in January 2019 to transfer a 40-acre property to Stanton Springs, LLC, but that the illegal activity alleged in the indictment took place two months later, when Stanton Springs LLC sold the property to Company A.\n— Staff writer Rosie Manins contributed to this article.\nAbout the Author\nHenri Hollis Henri Hollis is a reporter for the breaking news team.

Smith, the Independent Board Chair, emphasized the significance of these changes, noting that the utility industry is undergoing a transformational era. He stated that both new directors are ideally suited to navigate the evolving landscape of challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.\nLooking Ahead: The Vision for a Resilient Grid\nManuel Miranda expressed his enthusiasm about joining the Board, highlighting the critical resiliency work of CenterPoint Energy. He aims to contribute his insights on building a robust and dependable grid, especially in areas prone to severe weather conditions. His visionary goals encompass enhancing restoration efforts post-events that challenge the grid's integrity.\nLaurie Fitch shared similar sentiments, indicating the potential for strategic growth within the company. With her vast experience in the investment landscape, she is eager to collaborate with fellow directors to capitalize on the economic and growth opportunities that the utility sector presents.\nInsights into Their Backgrounds\nAbout Manuel Miranda\nAs a veteran in the utility industry, Miranda played a pivotal role at Florida Power & Light by leading major initiatives that focused on hurricane resilience strategies.

    "text": "'Não posso garantir que Nadal vai jogar' em Paris, adverte seu treinador 25/07/2024 19h02\nO espanhol Rafael Nadal sofreu na quarta-feira um problema físico que coloca em dúvida a sua esperada participação nos Jogos Olímpicos de Paris, disse nesta quinta-feira (25) o seu treinador, Carlos Moyá.\n\"Ele teve um desconforto ontem de manhã, à tarde estava mais limitado e antes que piorasse foi decidido que parasse\", explicou Moyà em entrevista à Radio Nacional da Espanha.\nO descanso desta quinta-feira \"foi a coisa mais responsável a se fazer, tendo um evento desta magnitude em dois dias\". \"Não forçar neste momento e dar tempo a ele para ver se ele se recupera bem. Veremos em que condições ele estará amanhã e sábado\", acrescentou.\nEstes Jogos são um dos eventos mais importantes de Nadal na reta final da sua lendária carreira, cujas últimas temporadas foram marcadas por uma sucessão de lesões.\nO detentor de 22 títulos de Grand Slam tem estreia marcada para domingo no torneio de simples contra o húngaro Marton Fucsovics e um dia antes nas duplas ao lado de seu 'herdeiro' Carlos Alcaraz.\nMoyá afirmou que o duelo de duplas de sábado pode ser um \"bom teste\" para avaliar o status de Nadal, mas ressaltou que neste momento não pode confirmar se está apto para competir nos Jogos.\n\"Não posso garantir nada, nem que ele não jogará nem que jogará\", disse ele. \"No momento o que está contemplado é que ele descanse, que faça tratamento (...) Qualquer desconforto que o Rafa possa ter neste momento deve ser tirado com pinça e ter cuidado\".\n\"Ele está obviamente muito animado para disputar estes Jogos Olímpicos. É um compromisso marcado em seu calendário há anos\", lembrou.\n\"Ele é um competidor nato e quer jogar simples e duplas. Está muito entusiasmado com as duplas com Alcaraz, é a primeira vez que jogam juntos e é algo histórico para o tênis espanhol\", concluiu.\ngbv/mcd/aam/am\n© Agence France-Presse\nAs mais lidas agora Não é só o RG: veja o que mudou na CNH e entenda nova tabela de categorias PIS ANO-BASE 2023 FOI CONFIRMADO e teve CALENDÁRIO DIVULGADO?

Expect an increase in clouds throughout the day with some sunshine. It will be a very chilly afternoon as high temperatures struggle to reach the low 30s.\nThings take a turn Sunday morning as a mix of wintry precipitation moves in. This winter storm will likely start as snow. However, as a pocket of warmer air above our heads moves into the region, snow will change over to a wintry mix.\nWhat remains unclear of this writing is exactly what type of precipitation will take over — sleet, freezing rain, etc. — and how much will accumulate.\nSignificant travel issues are likely Sunday afternoon into Sunday night and much of Monday. Power outages are possible depending on how much icing occurs.\nStay with the WAVE Storm Tracking Team throughout the weekend on television, online, and on the WAVE Weather App as we get closer to this winter storm.\nBehind the weekend storm, a long stretch of cold weather takes control. Temperatures may struggle to get above the freezing mark for at least a week. Overnight lows in the single digits are expected by the middle of next week as well. Stay warm and stay safe!\nWEEKEND FORECAST\nSATURDAY\nPartly Cloudy | Cold\nHIGH: 33°\nSUNDAY\nALERT DAY | Wintry Mix (80%)\nHIGH: 32°",
