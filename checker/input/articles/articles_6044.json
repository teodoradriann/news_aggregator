    "title": "Emergencia en Boeing: Se complicó la negociación y trabajadores van a huelga",
    "text": "Finalmente,\n los trabajadores de Boeing dispusieron ir a huelga luego de la oferta extendida por la compañía para un nuevo contrato de cara al 2027. Las condiciones ofrecidas por la empresa terminaron por no satisfacer al sindicato International Association of Machinist (IAM, por sus siglas en inglés).\nSIN ACUERDO\nEmergencia en Boeing: Se complicó la negociación y trabajadores van a huelga\nLas últimas horas de la negociación laboral de la compañía dio un giro y los trabajadores rechazaron el aumento del 25%. Otro golpe directo.\nFinalmente,\nEntre esas condiciones, Boeing había ofrecido hasta un 25% de aumento salarial rumbo al año señalado. Según los colaboradores, esa propuesta quedó muy lejos del 40% solicitado, a pesar de que el aumento iba a ser acompañado de otros beneficios de retiro y salud.\nMás del 90% de la fuerza laboral de Boeing rechazó la propuesta mediante votación, tras considerar que sus demandas no han sido atendidas y que lo puesto sobre la mesa no compensa tantos años de atraso salarial. Así, unos 33.000 trabajadores quedaron listos para desplegar un paro de sus tareas en las próximas horas en las instalaciones ubicadas en Seattle,\na espera de una mejor oferta.\nLa medida sería la primera huelga en 16 años que sufre la empresa constructora de aeronaves civiles y militares. Con la huelga, Boeing registraría aún más problemas en la cadena de entrega hacia compradores, con los cuales ya sostiene un ritmo atrasado.\nBoeing y más problemas\nLa huelga será otro de los hitos negativos que Boeing registrará en un año que no ha sido para nada fácil. Durante él, la empresa se tuvo que someter al escrutinio público por diversas cuestiones.\nEntre ellas, una seria investigación del Gobierno de Estados Unidos, desde donde se puso a la empresa bajo la lupa por defraudaciones en sus procesos de calidad. Organismos como la Administración Federal de Aviación o el FBI han puesto a Boeing en la mira por\nun cambio rotundo de la cultura empresarial.\nDicho proceso se inició luego de que un avión 737 MAX perdiera una puerta en un vuelo operado por Alaskan Airlines en tierras estadounidenses. Antecedente que se sumó a los accidentes de 2018 y 2019 de Ethiopian Airlines y Lion Air respectivamente.\nTodos esos eventos, combinados con la pandemia posterior, produjo que Boeing sufra un serio retraso en las entregas de sus aviones, lo que empujó a sus directivos a exigir una aceleración de los procesos, lo que llevó a una caída en\n la calidad de la construcción de sus aviones.",

Centurion: India was shot out within three days at the SuperSport Park in Centurion in what could be called as their worst performance in red-ball cricket in recent times. The Rohit Sharma-led side lost by an innings and 32 runs. While this loss will hurt them for some time now, where did India actually get it wrong? Was Rohit not able to make the right decisions? Was he not able to inspire the side? Rohit Failed With The Bat: Being one of the best batters of the side, Rohit was expected to set the template for others to follow, but that did not happen as he scored five in the first essay and did not get off-the-mark in the second. When the captain and one of your premier batters fails with the bat, it does not do any good to the confidence inside the dressing-room. Thakur Overused: For sure, India lacked a proper third pacer in the absence of Mohammed Shami. The usage of Ashwin and Thakur was a bit perplexing. With the ball becoming old, Rohit only utilised Ashwin for 12 overs. By then, Shardul had already bowled 14 overs and Prasidh Krishna bowled 18 overs. They went for 171 runs combined For breaking news and live news updates, like us on Cricket News on India.com .",

    "title": "Phase 2 of 'Clear Lanes' program will go into effect Jan. 29",
    "text": "WASHINGTON — Are you driving in D.C.'s bus lanes or blocking bus stops with your vehicle? The District plans to start fining you $100 starting Monday.\nAfter two false starts in 2023, and pushbacks of when the fines would kick in, it seems like the kinks have been ironed out and the District Department of Transportation has announced a new date for Phase Two of the\nClear Lanes Initiative. The program was implemented by D.C. and Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) to help keep the \"bus-only\" lanes clear of commercial vehicles.\nThe enforcement date was originally supposed to go into effect back in September 2023, which then became November and now DDOT says phase two of the program will begin on Jan. 29. Drivers illegally driving, parking, standing, or stopping in a bus lane may receive a $100 fine.\n“We are excited about the start of the second phase of this program,” said Interim DDOT Director Sharon Kershbaum. “Our goal with the Clear Lanes program is to demonstrate our commitment to strengthening our transportation network and helping residents who use public transportation get across the city faster and more efficiently.”\nClear Lanes, in partnership with Metro, aims to improve bus travel times and enhance bus stop safety and accessibility by using cameras mounted on Metrobuses to identify vehicles illegally operating, parking, standing, or stopping in dedicated bus lanes and bus zones. WMATA added cameras to each Metrobus that runs along the 31 routes with bus-only lanes, totaling 140 cameras.\nThe cameras will take pictures of cars parked, stopped or driving in the bus-only lane and record videos of the license plates. Drivers who violate the new traffic law will be fined $100 for being parked or stopped in a bus zone or for driving in a bus lane. The money collected from the fines will go towards the\nD.C. general fund.\nRELATED:\n[WMATA to crack down on cars in bus lanes with cameras on Metrobuses as part of larger overhaul](/article/traffic/cameras-on-metrobuses-to-crack-down-on-cars-in-bus-lanes/65-27f80deb-96b9-4e8d-aefa-59c6d1e5e4cb)\nIt is important to note that not all vehicles are restricted from using the bus lanes. Some authorized vehicles include:\nPublic transit buses, tour buses, school buses, and streetcars;\nBikes, e-bikes, and scooters;\nMaintenance vehicles (DC or Metro vehicles that are actively making repairs);\nEmergency vehicles (while responding to an emergency); and\nAccessible transportation service vehicles (wheelchair-accessible vehicles registered with the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Commission that are actively transporting someone with a disability).",

    "text": "A northern Ontario suspect who was the subject of an intense manhunt has been charged with one count each of murder and attempted murder. Lucas MacDonald, 43, was arrested Wednesday following a shootout with Ontario Provincial Police. One officer was shot and wounded during the operation. The OPP said early Thursday evening that the unnamed officer is expected “to make a full recovery.” Five police fired at MacDonald during Wednesday’s arrest in the area of Night Hawk Lake, east of Timmins. MacDonald was left with minor injuries. He had been wanted for questioning since late May in the homicide of 30-year-old Marcel Thoma from Petawawa. Thoma was shot to death and his remains were found in a wooded area in Egan Township, near Shillington, on May 23. Police have been searching for MacDonald since then, warning the public not to approach him should they see him and call police instead. A major operation Wednesday closed nearby Kettles Provincial Park. Police also put up wanted posters along Highway 101 between Shillington and Municipal Road. MacDonald was charged with first-degree murder in Thoma’s death and attempted murder using a firearm in the shooting of the OPP officer. The OPP said he remains in custody and is scheduled to appear before the Ontario Court of Justice in Timmins on Friday. Earlier Thursday, the Special Investigations Unit said it invoked its mandate in the case because police fired their guns at MacDonald while trying to arrest him on Moose Island on Night Hawk Lake. Exchange of gunfire In a news release, the SIU said MacDonald was located \"and at some point, there was an exchange of gunfire.\" \"Five officers discharged their firearms, but the man did not suffer any serious injury,\" the SIU said. \"One officer was struck. The man was arrested.\" Four investigators and two forensic investigators have been assigned to the case, the SIU said. \"At this time, five subject officials, three witness officials and one civilian employee have been designated.\" The SIU is urging anyone who may have information about the investigation, including video or photos, to contact the lead investigator at 1-800-787-8529 or online .

    "text": "El presidente de Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, ordenó este jueves una \"acción defensiva\" en el océano Atlántico en respuesta a la llegada de un buque de guerra británico a las costas de Guyana, lo que ha disparado nuevamente la tensión entre los países suramericanos por su disputa territorial. \"He ordenado la activación de una acción conjunta de toda la Fuerza Armada Nacional Bolivariana (FANB) sobre el Caribe oriental de Venezuela, sobre la fachada atlántica, una acción conjunta de carácter defensivo como respuesta a la provocación y a la amenaza del Reino Unido contra la paz y la soberanía de nuestro país\", dijo el mandatario. El anuncio lo hizo frente a la cúpula militar, durante una reunión que fue transmitida de manera obligatoria en la radio y televisión, en la que se comunicó con un grupo de efectivos castrenses que concretaron \"la primera fase\" de esta operación, lo que consistió en un despliegue sobre tierra y aguas del estado Sucre (noreste). Maduro no dio detalles sobre el alcance y duración de esta operación pero insistió en que la llegada del HMS Trent británico es una \"amenaza inaceptable\" que supone una \"ruptura\" de los acuerdos que suscribió con su homólogo guyanés, Irfaan Ali, el pasado 14 de diciembre, cuando se comprometieron a no amenazarse mutuamente y evitar incidentes relacionadas con la disputa. \"Venezuela no se puede quedar de brazos cruzados frente a una amenaza, estamos respondiendo en la medida proporcional\", aseguró tras reiterar que apuesta por la diplomacia y la paz. El líder chavista criticó que Guyana haya desoído las peticiones de Caracas de no aceptar la llegada del barco británico a sus costas. Minutos antes, el Gobierno venezolano había condenado este hecho en un comunicado, en el que pidió a Georgetown \"tomar acciones inmediatas para el retiro del buque y abstenerse de seguir involucrando potencias militares en la controversia\". La disputa escaló después de que Venezuela aprobara el 3 de diciembre, en un referendo unilateral, anexionarse la zona bajo pleito, un área de casi 160.000 kilómetros cuadrados que está bajo control de Guyana y que actualmente discute la Corte Internacional de Justicia.

    "text": "* Soybean futures fall on pressure from weather, profit taking\n* Strong U.S. dollar pushes grain futures down\n* Wheat saw a boost on technical trading\nCHICAGO, March 22 (Reuters) - Chicago Board of Trade soybean futures fell more than 1% on Friday, dipping back below $12 a bushel on profit taking a day after the benchmark contract neared a two-month high, with farmer soy sales and a surge in the dollar adding to bearish sentiment, analysts said.\nWheat futures were higher while corn was little changed in choppy trade.\nAs of 12:45 p.m. CDT (1745 GMT), CBOT May soybeans were down 19-1/2 cents, or 1.6%, at $11.92-1/2 per bushel. May corn was down 3/4 cent at $4.40 a bushel while May wheat was up 8-1/2 cents at $5.55-1/4 a bushel.\nSoybeans retreated after a two-session climb. Rallies this week spurred soy sales by farmers in the United States and South America, analysts said.\n\"The grain and oilseed sector is mostly lower on a stronger dollar and increased farmer selling, especially in Brazil,\" StoneX chief commodities economist Arlan Suderman wrote in a client note.\nOthers attributed market pressure to forecasts for beneficial rains in portions of the Midwest crop belt ahead of spring planting. Rains and snow were forecast over the weekend in Iowa, a top producer of corn and soybeans, where nearly 20% of the state is in extreme drought, according to the latest weekly U.S. Drought Monitor report.\n\"The drought in Iowa has been building up all winter, and we're finally getting the bullseye in terms of the rain,\" Randy Place, analyst with Hightower Report, said.\nCBOT wheat firmed, following as European wheat futures rose on renewed concerns about disruption to Black Sea supplies given rising tensions between Russia and Ukraine, traders said.\nSome noted support from the European Commission proposing tariffs on grain imports from Russia and Belarus in an attempt to prevent Moscow and its ally from distorting EU markets.\nHowever, traders stressed that Russian and Belarusian shipments to the bloc are low relative to those from Ukraine, and that the imposition of tariffs was largely symbolic.\nMeanwhile, the U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed private sales of 263,000 metric tons of U.S. corn to Mexico.\nTraders continue to adjust their positions ahead of the USDA's March 28 U.S. planting intentions and quarterly stocks reports, which have a history of jolting markets.

    "text": "LYNNWOOD, Wash. — A small bakery in Lynnwood only sells homemade pies – quite literally.\nRumbly in my Tumbly Pie Co. is a one-woman business run out of a renovated third-car garage at Shannon McDowell’s home.\n\"I'm a pie person, through and through,” McDowell said. “That's what I want for my birthday every year. My dad made the best homemade apple pie in the entire world.\"\nShe now shares that recipe - and many more of her own – from her micro-bakery named in honor of Winnie the Pooh.\nLaunched in 2021, Rumbly in my Tumbly asks customers to pre-order their pies of choice and pick them up from a service window (or from small refrigerators outside the window, if McDowell isn’t home.)\nShe's the owner, lone baker and solo scheduler.\n\"I like working alone. It's peaceful and quiet until my kids get home,” McDowell said.\nThough it’s a tiny operation, McDowell makes hundreds of pies a year for both new and regular customers who often give her 5-star reviews online.\n\"The crust is absolutely the key. You have to hand-roll it out, you have to use tons of butter, you have to keep everything cold,” McDowell said.\nAmong her top sellers in the fall? A cinnamon roll apple pie, made with fresh, hand-peeled apples and topped with tiny cinnamon roll pie crusts.\nSeasonal fruit pies are also popular.\n\"My key lime pie (has) fresh-squeezed juice, fresh squeezed zest, and really good graham cracker crust,” McDowell said. \"I probably sell more peach pies between May and September than any other flavor the rest of the year.\"\nAt Halloween time, customers crave the one pie McDowell doesn't love - at least, not visually. It has a scary face baked on top.\n\"I sell like 100 of them every October. It's insane how many people want those, they're so gross,” McDowell said, laughing. “I don't understand it, I couldn't eat it.\"\nWhatever customers choose, McDowell strives to bake pies with the kind of care that sparks nostalgia.\n\"My favorite compliment that I get is when people say it tastes like the pie their grandma used to make,” she said.\nRumbly in my Tumbly pies can be pre-ordered online. McDowell also connects with customers on\nRumbly in my Tumbly Pie Co. is located at 3502 172nd St SW in Lynnwood.\n[KING 5's Evening](/evening) celebrates the Northwest. Contact us:",

    "text": "Crews rescue four college students in dangerous conditions from Red River Gorge Marina Johnson Louisville Courier Journal Four college students who were camping in Red River Gorge were rescued by helicopter on Monday after an arctic cold front that struck the region left them stranded in the area.\nAccording to a Facebook post from Powell County Search & Rescue , the call was received at 9:28 a.m. after students from Asbury College camped on top of Courthouse Rock in Red River Gorge overnight, underestimating weather conditions.\nKristin Gousse, Powell County Search & Rescue spokesperson, said the use of a helicopter for rescue missions is typically rare, but given snowy and icy conditions was deemed necessary. Search and rescue teams initially hiked to the location with Kentucky State Police on standby.\n“[Search & Rescue] hiked in and once they got there, they realized it definitely was too dangerous so again they reached out through our County Emergency Management Director,” Gousse said. “They approved KSP to do the mission, [KSP] accepted it and they were able to fly out.”\nAccording to the Facebook post, the rescue took place around 2:05 p.m. The students were flown to Middlefork Fire Department where they were evaluated by medical personnel.\nGousse confirmed the students had no reported injuries.\nA Powell County Search & Rescue volunteer, who often works with the Kentucky State Police Hoist Program, helped to secure the helicopter usage and a safe landing location, Gousse said.\n\"Having trained with the KSP Hoist Program, he was able to coordinate their involvement,\" she said. \"So we put them on notice saying ‘Hey, we’ve been to Courthouse Rock before, we know how treacherous that climb is to get to the top in good conditions, so considering it was icy and snowy there was a chance it would be too dangerous to try and get our team members up there to set up a system to get them down.'\"\nThe rescue, originally supposed to be a hoist mission, became a helicopter rescue after providing photos to the pilot, who felt confident in landing on the terrain, making it safer for involved parties, said Gousse. She continued, saying it was the first-ever helicopter to land on top of Courthouse Rock.\nAccording to a post from Kentucky State Police on X, formerly Twitter, the mission was successful with the help of organizations including the KSP Aircraft Branch, REDSTAR Wilderness EMS, Powell County Search & Rescue, and Wolfe County Search & Rescue.\nGousse said Powell County’s Search & Rescue is primarily volunteer and donation-based, but helicopter rescues involving other organizations vary.\n“We don’t accrue many costs at all ... everybody who responds is voluntary,\" she said. \"Typically, the costs of fuel for our rescue truck, for gear and equipment, we just get from donations, or we do apply for grants so we get some money there. Other than that, there’s no cost to taxpayers or anybody who’s rescued.”\nProtocols with Kentucky State Police differ, she said.\n“Because it’s going up to a state emergency operation center, they approved to fund it and so KSP could send them a bill but typically they don’t,\" she said.\nThis story may update.",
