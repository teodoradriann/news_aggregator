    "text": "Accountant-General of the Federation, Shamseldeen Ogunjimi\nThe Federal Government has begun disbursing the second tranche of the N35,000 wage award arrears to civil servants, reaffirming its commitment to meeting obligations to federal workers.\nIn a statement on Friday in Abuja, the Office of the Accountant General of the Federation (OAGF) confirmed the disbursement, stating that the payment was part of the outstanding wage award introduced to cushion the impact of economic reforms on public sector employees.\nMr. Bawa Mokwa, Director of Press and Public Relations at the OAGF, said the government had earlier settled one month’s arrears out of the total five months owed to federal workers under the wage award arrangement. The payment of the second tranche reduces the outstanding balance to three months.\nThe N35,000 monthly wage award was introduced as a temporary palliative measure following the removal of fuel subsidies and other reforms that significantly affected the cost of living. It was agreed upon during negotiations between the Federal Government and organised labour to ease the financial burden on workers pending a new minimum wage structure.\nResponding to speculation that the Federal Government had abandoned the wage award, the Accountant General’s office dismissed such claims, maintaining that the administration has not defaulted on its promise. The office clarified that payments are being made in phases and will continue until the full arrears are cleared.\n“The Federal Government has not reneged on its obligation. The wage award arrears will continue to be paid in instalments of N35,000 per month until the outstanding balance is completely settled,” the statement said.\nThe assurance comes at a time when labour unions and public sector workers have been mounting pressure on the government for improved wage conditions amid rising inflation and economic challenges.\nThe gradual settlement of the wage award arrears may help ease tensions between labour and government, although broader discussions on salary adjustments and public sector welfare are still ongoing.",

P2P lending platforms connect borrowers directly with lenders through an online marketplace without involving traditional financial intermediaries like banks. This allows for faster loan processing times and competitive interest rates for borrowers while providing investors with attractive returns on their investments. How to Get Started on a Career in FinTech? Getting started on a career in FinTech may seem like a daunting task, especially as the field continues to rapidly evolve and expand. However, with the right skills and knowledge, you can position yourself for success in this lucrative industry. In this section, we will discuss the steps you can take to kickstart your career in FinTech. 1.

With the merging of finance and technology, the possibilities are endless for innovations and advancements in this field. This makes it an attractive industry for those looking to kickstart their career in finance or tech or even make a switch from their current field. However, with the constantly evolving nature of the FinTech industry, success can be challenging.

Challenges and Potential Risks of Working in FinTech FinTech offers an exciting and dynamic career path for individuals interested in the intersection of finance and technology. The industry is growing at a rapid pace, with new concepts and innovations constantly emerging. However, like any other industry, working in FinTech also comes with its own set of challenges and potential risks. In this section, we will discuss some of the key challenges that professionals in FinTech may face, and how they can navigate through them to build a successful career. 1. Regulatory compliance: One of the main challenges faced by FinTech companies is ensuring regulatory compliance. With technological advancements leading to new ways of managing money and financial transactions, it becomes crucial for these companies to adhere to strict regulations set by governing bodies. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in hefty fines or even shut down the operations entirely. For instance, cryptocurrency exchanges are facing increasing scrutiny from regulatory authorities due to concerns over money laundering and terrorist financing. Similarly, peer-to-peer lending platforms need to ensure compliance with consumer protection laws while using innovative technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) for credit assessments. Therefore, working in FinTech requires individuals who not only possess technical skills but also have a sound understanding of regulatory policies. Companies should regularly review their operations and policies to ensure compliance and avoid any legal consequences. 2.Risk management: The use of advanced technologies in FinTech brings about new risks that need careful consideration. Cybersecurity threats are prevalent as hackers continuously try to breach systems containing sensitive financial information. Additionally, data privacy regulations and laws are becoming stricter, making it crucial for FinTech companies to ensure the security of customer data. Furthermore, as FinTech companies deal with financial transactions, any technical glitches or system failures can result in significant monetary losses. Therefore, risk management is a critical aspect that professionals in this industry need to focus on. They must have the necessary skills to identify and mitigate potential risks effectively. 3. Talent shortage: The rapid growth of the FinTech industry has created a high demand for skilled professionals in areas such as coding, data analytics, and financial expertise. However, there is a shortage of talent in these specific areas, making it challenging for companies to find the right fit for their roles. This talent shortage can be attributed to various factors such as lack of university programs specifically tailored to FinTech, the industry’s novelty, and high demand from other industries like banking and technology. To address this challenge, companies should invest in training programs and partnerships with educational institutions to bridge the skills gap. As an individual looking to build a career in FinTech, staying updated with the latest technologies and honing your skills will make you stand out among the competition. Conclusion As technology continues to advance and shape the financial industry, there are countless opportunities for those interested in pursuing a career in fintech. From data analytics to blockchain development, the future is bright for individuals looking to combine finance with technology. By staying up-to-date on industry trends and honing relevant skills, you can position yourself for success in this ever-evolving field. So why not explore what the world of fintech has to offer? Your dream job may be just around the corner!",

    "text": "Several businesses in the CBD wore a sombre look on Thursday, a day after activists of the Karnataka Rakshana Vedike (KRV) held a protest-cum-awareness rally through the city that quickly turned violent. However, many carried out business as usual, reporting no negative effect on sales and services.\nOn Wednesday, popular retail stores and eateries clustered around Cunningham Road, New Airport Road, Lavelle Road and Vittal Mallya Road were in for a rude shock as they helplessly watched members of the KRV hit at, trash and tear their advertisement boards or break pieces off their embossed signboards.\nThursday brought forth an unusual sight: Many businesses had their names covered with cloth. Two popular clothing stores on Brigade Road had also displayed the Karnataka flag on their signboards. A broken embossed signboard at Vittal Mallya Road was covered with green cloth. UB City mall authorities fixed large mesh coverings outside the building and covered with paper and cloth the names of the Prestige Group on the building.\nHowever, it was business as usual in many affected stores, some seeing a greater crowd than usual, too.\n“We have been getting a lot of calls and are seeing a lot of people walk-ins today, so our business has not been hit. But our management is yet to decide the damages and the repair costs,” said the manager of a clothing store.\nSimilarly, two places that see regular customers lining at the doors every day – a microbrewery and a coffee shop – did not see a dip in customers due to Wednesday’s events.\n“Business has continued on as always. In my opinion, it has been a little better than a typical Thursday,” said an employee at the coffee shop.\nSuhail Yousuf, Secretary of Brigade Shops and Establishments Association, said that over 90 per cent of the stores in and around Brigade Road had Kannada prominently displayed on their signboards while the remaining businesses have been asked to implement the rule before February 28.\n“These types of unnecessary threats by such groups are unacceptable. Why must they spread fear? Why aren’t they spreading love for the language instead?” he asked.\nBhoopalam Srinath, immediate past president of the Bangalore Traders’ Association, explained that although there wasn’t an atmosphere of fear among the business owners, they were exercising caution as some stores that did display Kannada signboards also bore damages.\n“Vandalism is not okay. Let them (the activists) give the stores time to implement the rule because their sentiment for Kannada is understandable but vandalising property is not the solution.”\nADVERTISEMENT (Published 28 December 2023, 22:03 IST)",
