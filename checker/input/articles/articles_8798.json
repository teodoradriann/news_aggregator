    "text": "By Irene Rotondo | IRotondo@masslive.com The owner of a Boston bar where a 23-year-old Marine veteran was killed by a bouncer in 2022 has closed the establishment and is looking to sell its license, the owner’s lawyer announced this week. The proceeds will go to the Marine’s family, he said.\nThe Sons of Boston bar shut down after the fatal stabbing and reopened at 19 Union St. on May 11, 2023, with a new name, Loyal Nine. The previous establishment had been in operation since 2018 , according to a post on its Instagram account.\nBut on Tuesday, attorney Carolyn Conway went before the Boston Licensing Board and said her client has closed the bar and wants to sell their license. Additionally, Conway said the proceeds of that sale will go to the family of 23-year-old Daniel Martinez.\nThough it is unclear which specific license Conway was referencing, the transaction of liquor licenses is common given the state’s cap on the number issued. Liquor licenses can sell for as much as $600,000 in Boston.\nRead more: Family recounts devastation in wake of marine’s murder outside Boston bar Martinez, who was from Chicago, was a recently discharged U.S. Marine Corps veteran and was visiting Boston with friends for St. Patrick’s Day weekend two years ago. He was denied entry to Sons of Boston, and investigators said the bouncer followed Martinez and his friend down the block and then stabbed Martinez in the chest.\nThe bouncer, Alvaro Larrama, 40, of East Boston, pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to up to 20 years in prison in April.\nThe Loyal Nine license transaction was not the initial issue before the Licensing Board, which had corresponded with Conway about a separate assault and battery violation at the bar in June. She responded that the bar was now closed. Further information on that incident was not immediately available.\nThe Licensing Board will address the sale of the license at a later date. The owners of Loyal Nine and Conway were not immediately available for comment.\nMore Boston stories Red Sox option Vaughn Grissom, top offseason trade acquisition, to Triple A Boston police ID Jamaica Plain man killed in stabbing on Sunday Red Sox C prospect acquired from Yankees batting .389 at Worcester Petition to put Robin Williams statue at ‘Good Will Hunting’ bench in Public Garden gains steam Former Boston city councilor pleads guilty in 2023 car crash, must apologize to homeowner If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

    "title": "World Animal Day: OCTOBER 04, 2024 | A Home for Every Heart",
    "text": "As we observe World Animal Day 2024, we embrace the theme, \"The World is Their Home Too\" This day serves as a powerful reminder that animals share our planet and deserve our care and protection. Let’s come together to ensure that every creature feels safe and loved in the world we all inhabit, says SAKSHI PRIYA On World Animal Day, we are reminded of a simple yet profound truth: animals share our world and in many ways, they reflect the best parts of ourselves. As we go about our lives, it’s easy to forget the loyalty, grace and beauty that animals bring to this planet. Whether it’s the silent strength of a tiger in the wild or the trusting eyes of a stray dog, animals have a way of touching our hearts. As the author Anthony Douglas Williams once said, “We have more to learn from animals than animals have to learn from us.” Their unconditional love, resilience and ability to live harmoniously with nature offer us lessons in compassion, humility and care. October 4th, World Animal Day, is a time to highlight the pressing issues that animals face across the globe. The theme for this year, “The World is Their Home Too,” is a powerful call for all of us to recognise the rights of animals, whether they are roaming freely in the wilderness or wandering the streets as strays. This day is a chance to reflect on how we treat the creatures that share our planet and to realise that they, too, deserve safety, respect and love. From the majestic Royal Bengal Tiger to the critically endangered Indian Rhinoceros, the wildlife in India is under constant threat. Habitat destruction, poaching and human-wildlife conflict have left these species teetering on the edge of survival. The tiger, once a symbol of untamed power, now roams in small, fragmented patches of forest. The Indian Rhinoceros, whose numbers were once decimated by hunting, faces the constant pressure of habitat loss and illegal poaching for its horn. Similarly, the Asiatic Lion, which now has a population of approximately 600 individuals confined to the Gir Forest, faces an uncertain future in its last remaining natural habitat. This small population survives in a limited area, making them vulnerable to catastrophic events like disease outbreaks or forest fires, which could wipe them out forever. These creatures, emblematic of India’s natural heritage, are not merely animals, they are vital parts of ecosystems that sustain life, including our own. Yet, it’s not only the rare and exotic species that require our attention. Animals that live closer to us, whether they are stray dogs, cattle, or even birds, also face significant challenges. Stray dogs, in particular, bear the brunt of urban neglect. But beyond the dogs, there are countless other animals like cows left to fend for themselves on the streets, often injured or malnourished. Birds, too, struggle as cities expand, with sparrows and other species losing their nesting grounds due to rapid urbanisation. Even marine life along India’s coasts is impacted by pollution and overfishing, with turtles, dolphins, and many fish species facing increasingly hostile environments. One of the most critical actions we can take for all animals is to reconsider how we interact with them. Whether it’s making sustainable choices that protect natural habitats or supporting animal shelters and rehabilitation centres, we each have a role to play. Conservation efforts like Project Tiger, Project Elephant and initiatives to protect the Great Indian Bustard are crucial but they need greater public backing. Beyond government initiatives, we as individuals can contribute by supporting wildlife sanctuaries, participating in reforestation efforts and making more conscious decisions that minimise harm to animal habitats. For animals closer to home, adopting stray dogs, cats or even cows from shelters is one of the most compassionate things we can do. These animals, often ignored, deserve a second chance at life. Rather than purchasing pets, adopting from shelters not only saves lives but helps reduce the suffering caused by overpopulation. We must also push for stronger laws against animal cruelty and promote humane population control measures for stray animals, such as spay and neuter programmes. On this day, let’s broaden our perspective. Let’s not just think about the wild animals in distant forests or the pets in our homes. Let’s consider all the creatures that make up our world: the birds, the cattle, the marine life and the strays and how each one plays a vital role in the delicate balance of life on Earth. Every action we take, no matter how small, contributes to creating a better world for them. As we observe World Animal Day, let's remember that the answer for stray animals begins with a simple yet profound action: adopt, don’t shop. Every stray dog on the street is a potential companion, waiting for a family. By adopting a stray, you give an animal a second chance at life and the warmth of a loving home. This small act not only transforms their lives but also enriches yours with unique love and companionship. Every life saved reflects our compassion for these deserving souls. The world is their home too and together, we can ensure that every animal feels safe, loved, and valued. Books to celebrate World Animal Day The Gopi Diaries is a charming series for children by Sudha Murty, published by Harper Children's. The series follows Gopi, a lovable pup. In Coming Home, Gopi is adopted by a loving family and quickly learns about his new world. In Finding Love, he grows stronger and cheekier, facing new challenges and meeting exciting dog companions. Finally, in Growing Up, Gopi matures and welcomes a new friend, Nova, into his life. Warrior Queens of Ranthambore by Manish Kalani, is a unique coffee table book that captures the journey of five generations of tigresses in Ranthambore National Park. Featuring over 500 photographs taken over eight years, wildlife photographer Manish Kalani tells the story of the legendary tigress Machhli and her descendants, highlighting their beauty, strength and emotional bonds. The book emphasises the importance of tiger conservation and serves as a significant addition to wildlife literature in India. Mountain Mammals of the World by M.K. Ranjitsinh, published by Penguin Ebury Press, is a definitive guide that explores the larger mammals inhabiting mountainous regions globally. The book features detailed profiles of approximately 62 species and 78 subspecies, highlighting their behaviour, ecology and conservation status. This work serves as an essential resource for understanding these majestic animals within their breathtaking mountain habitats. Wildlife Chronicles by Adit Jain (Publisher: Rupa) is a travelogue and guide to India's national parks and wildlife sanctuaries. The book showcases the country's diverse landscapes and wildlife, featuring travel tips, must-see places, and captivating photographs. Jain's personal anecdotes aim to inspire interest in conservation while providing practical advice for travellers. Wildlife India @ 50: Saving the Wild, Securing the Future by Manoj Misra (Publisher: Rupa) commemorates 50 years of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. The book chronicles India's wildlife conservation journey, reflecting on successes and missed opportunities through contributions from various experts. With a focus on the impact of colonial hunting practices and the need for wildlife legislation, it highlights the progress made and the challenges ahead in protecting India's biodiversity.",
