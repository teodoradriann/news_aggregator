    "text": "More bad news for Todd Chrisley, folks.\nThe imprisoned former reality star, who is stuck behind federal bars in the wake of his conviction two years ago for various types of financial fraud, has been dismissed from his administrative duties at the prison chapel, his attorney, Jay Surgent, told TMZ.\nWe’ll give you a moment to break out your tiny violin for Chrisley…\nTodd Chrisley does not appear to be an ethical individual. That’s just our opinion, of course. (Image Credit: USA) The 55-year old had been working as an assistant to the chapel in Pensacola for “Christians, Jewish people and Muslims,” according to Surgent.\n“Someone saw him speaking to someone in the drug rehabilitation program,” the lawyer went on. “For no reason after all this time, he’s dismissed saying he can’t do it anymore.\nChrisley — described as “a religious person” by this attorney — previously said he believes God actually sent him to jail .\n“They had no hearing, there was no announcement, no hearing, he wasn’t aware of the fact that … he did anything wrong,” Surgent said to Us Weekly.\nTodd Chrisley reacts in shock here during a scene on his terrible reality show. (Image Credit: USA) Todd was working alongside a chaplain at FPC Pensacola in Florida to help organize religious services for various faiths until officials removed him from the role.\nNo one from that specific facility has yet spoken out on the development, but a rep for the Federal Bureau of Prisons told TMZ:\n“For privacy reasons, we do not comment on the conditions of confinement for any incarcerated individual, including their work detail assignments.”\nTodd and wife Julie Chrisley were found guilty in June 2022 on 12 counts including wire fraud, conspiracy to commit bank fraud and conspiracy to defraud the United States.\nThe former was sentenced to 12 years behind bars, with his current release date set for June 26, 2032; while Julie was sentenced to 7 years .\nTodd Chrisley seems like a pretty terrible person. That’s all we have to say in this caption. (Image Credit: USA) Surgent, meanwhile, called the decision to fire Chrisley from his job as “horrible” and “absolutely ridiculous.”\nSimilarly, Savannah Chrisley reacted to her mother’s sentence being upheld on September 25 by saying it was “100 percent injustice” and adding:\n“We’ve seen the injustices happen time and time again, and the prosecutors here, they’re absolutely ridiculous and clearly they’re uneducated.\n“What has happened is an injustice, and I will continue to fight for my parents, and I will be as loud as I can possibly be.”",

    "title": "Jamie Lee Curtis More Matinee Concerts, Calls On Bruce Springsteen To Lead The Charge",
    "text": "[Jamie Lee Curtis](https://doyouremember.com/196068/jamie-lee-curtis-john-carpenters-advice-halloween-role) has a cultural trend she wants thrust into the spotlight. On Saturday, Curtis attended the Independent Spirit [Awards](https://doyouremember.com/183955/elizabeth-taylor-cleopatra-turns-60-film-nearly-destroyed-studio). There, Curtis used the platform to issue a message through The Hollywood Reporter, calling for artists to do matinee concerts, the better to perform during the day and wrap up before bedtime. Matinees are popular in the world of theater – and in the case of stage productions, are usually performed on Wednesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays. Musical artists don’t usually perform at those hours, more often favoring starting at 8 pm at the earliest. But introducing matinee concerts is an idea Curtis is very passionate about and has discussed it on multiple occasions. Here’s her vision. Jamie Lee Curtis wants matinee concerts to become mainstream While speaking to THR, Curtis [urged](https://consequence.net/2023/03/jamie-lee-curtis-matinee-concerts/), “I am gonna just say this now as a taunt and as a suggestion: U2, do a matinee.” She went on, “Coldplay: do a matinee. What about a 12-noon concert, Coldplay? What about it?” She then called on Bruce Springsteen to do the same. RELATED: [Jamie Lee Curtis Praises Pamela Anderson Going Makeup-Free As “Act Of Courage”](https://doyouremember.com/195119/jamie-lee-curtis-praise-pamela-anderson-makeup-free?utm_source=website&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=related) “Bruce Springsteen: do a fu—ing matinee!” she rallied. Curtis continued on to explain the reasoning behind this strategy, “You’re old! Why wouldn’t you [let me come see you, Bruce Springsteen](https://doyouremember.com/178723/bruce-springsteen-clears-the-air-sleeps-with-guitar), in your glory days — pun intended — and do it at noon or 1 o’clock? 2 o’clock! 2 o’clock matinee! Theatre in New York, 2 o’clock! I will come and hear your five-hour concert, Bruce, at 2 o’clock, and I’m gonna be home and in bed by 7:30 [p.m.].” Curtis’s call to action has gained national attention It didn’t take long for Curtis’s statements to go viral and they became a topic of conversation when Curtis appeared on Today on Tuesday, March 7. “Why are there no matinees?” she mused with co-hosts Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie. “For instance, I love Coldplay. I would love to go see Coldplay. The problem is I’m not gonna go see Coldplay if they start their show at 9 o’clock and there’s an opening act. I want to hear Coldplay at 1:00 p.m. I think if we filled a stadium of people who want to see a matinee of Coldplay, I think we would start a trend.” Curtis admitted she prefers getting up early in the morning, so [anything that cuts too deep into her sleep](https://doyouremember.com/197747/jamie-lee-curtis-gym-body-post-thanksgiving-workout-photo) is something she tries to excise from her life as often as possible. In fact, she added, if a dinner starts after 5 pm, there’s a good chance she’ll turn down the invite, a policy Guthrie called “hardcore.” Would you attend a matinee concert as envisioned by Curtis?",

    "text": "В Китае арестовали жителя города Нанкин, который под видом женщины переспал с сотнями мужчин, тайно снимая свои похождения на видео. Об этом сообщает издание South China Morning Post.\nВ приложениях для знакомств 38-летний задержанный по фамилии Цзяо выдавал себя за замужнюю женщину. Как пишет гонконгское издание The Standard, это могло привлекать к нему любителей внебрачных отношений, которые не догадывались, что имеют дело с переодетым мужчиной. Сам Цзяо утверждал, что у него был 1691 сексуальный партнер. Известно, что среди них встречались студенты колледжей, молодые специалисты, работники спортзалов и иностранцы.\nПри общении Цзяо искусно использовал макияж, парики и программы для изменения голоса. От своих ухажеров он ожидал лишь небольшие подарки — например, молоко или фрукты. При этом все происходящее снимала скрытая камера, установленная в его квартире. Отснятые кадры продавались в закрытой онлайн-группе, вступление в которую стоило 150 юаней (около полутора тысяч рублей).\nПосле утечки роликов в интернете начали распространяться фотографии лиц мужчин, которые встречались с Цзяо. Некоторые из пострадавших узнали на них себя и обратились в полицию. Других опознали друзья и родственники. Одна женщина, например, узнала в одном из посетителей Цзяо своего жениха. Другая заметила на снимках сына, который работает учителем английского языка в детском саду.\nЗа распространение непристойных материалов Цзяо грозит лишение свободы на срок до двух лет.\nРанее сообщалось, что в Венесуэле отбывающий тюремное заключение преступник переоделся женщиной и сбежал из тюрьмы. Женскую одежду и каштановый парик ему во время свидания передала девушка.",

    "title": "Heroes: How these Swiss seniors won first ever climate case in international court",
    "text": "Switzerland may be famous for its neutrality, but it’s no longer climate-neutral. In April, the European Court of Human Rights ruled\nin favour of a group of 2,400 older Swiss women who argued that the government was putting them at greater risk of dying during heat waves by not doing enough to combat climate change. Nine years after they began their battle, the women made legal history, winning the first ever climate case in an international court.\nThe applicants – KlimaSeniorinnen, or Senior Women for Climate Protection, average age 73 – claimed that their government “failed to fulfil its positive obligations to protect life effectively” through appropriate legislation and targets to combat climate change. The court agreed, accepting the women’s contention that older women suffer disproportionately from intensifying heat waves.\nHeat-related deaths have spiked by roughly 30% in Europe over the last two decades. A 2023 study published in Nature Medicine estimated 56% more heat-related deaths in European women than men. The judging panel declared 16 to 1 that Article 2 of Europe’s human rights convention guarantees citizens “effective protection by state authorities from the serious adverse effects of climate change on their lives, health, well-being and quality of life.”\nWhat we do now, we are not doing for ourselves, but for the sake of our children and our children’s children.\n- Elisabeth Stern, KlimaSeniorinnen member\nThe Swiss women’s group, formed in 2016 with the support of Greenpeace, faced an uphill battle. After their case was dismissed by the Swiss Supreme Court in 2020, they turned to the European Court of Human Rights. “We know statistically that in 10 years we will be gone,” KlimaSeniorinnen member Elisabeth Stern told BBC. “What we do now, we are not doing for ourselves, but for the sake of our children and our children’s children.”\nScientists say Switzerland is heating up at twice the global rate.\nHeat domes last fall set new temperature records. Of course, it’s not just Switzerland. The 2023 Lancet Countdown report on health and climate change estimated that global heat deaths could quadruple by mid-century if the world warms by 2°C.\nGiven the court’s ruling, Switzerland will need to review and upgrade its climate policies. While the decision is not technically binding beyond Switzerland, it sets legal precedent for future climate legislation in all 46 countries that have signed the European Convention on Human Rights.\nAndrew Gage, an environmental lawyer with Vancouver-based West Coast Environmental Law, believes the KlimaSeniorinnen decision will influence the outcome of cases beyond Europe – including in Canada, where the Charter of Rights and Freedoms protects individuals’ rights to life and security. “While not binding,” he says, the decision sets “a very strong precedent.”",

    "title": "Venezuela to hold military exercises as British warship heads to Guyana | East London and West Essex Guardian Series",
    "text": "President Nicolas Maduro has ordered Venezuela’s armed forces to conduct defensive exercises in the Eastern Caribbean after the UK sent a warship towards Guyana’s territorial waters as the South American neighbours dispute a large border region. In a nationally televised address on Thursday, Mr Maduro said 6,000 Venezuelan troops, including air and naval forces, will conduct joint operations off the nation’s eastern coast — near the border with Guyana. Mr Maduro described the impending arrival of British ship HMS Trent to Guyana’s shores as a “threat” to his country. He argued the ship’s deployment violates a recent agreement between the South American nations. “We believe in diplomacy, in dialogue and in peace, but no one is going to threaten Venezuela,” Mr Maduro said in a room where he was accompanied by a dozen military commanders. “This is an unacceptable threat to any sovereign country in Latin America.” Venezuela and Guyana are involved in a border dispute over the Essequibo, a sparsely populated region the size of Florida with vast oil deposits off its shores. The region has been under Guyana’s control for decades. But in December, Venezuela relaunched its historical claim to the Essequibo through a referendum in which it asked voters in the country whether the Essequibo should be turned into a Venezuelan state. As tensions over the region escalated, the leaders of both countries met in the Caribbean island of St Vincent and signed an agreement which said they would solve their dispute through nonviolent means. During the talks, however, Guyana’s President Irfan Ali said his nation reserved its right to work with its partners to ensure the defence of his country. On Thursday, Guyanese officials described the visit of HMS Trent as a planned activity aimed at improving the nation’s defence capabilities and said the ship’s visit will continue as scheduled. “Nothing that we do or have done is threatening Venezuela,” Guyana’s vice-president Bharrat Jagdeo told reporters in Georgetown, the nation’s capital. HMS Trent is a patrol and rescue ship that was recently used to intercept drug traffickers off the West Coast of Africa. It can accommodate up to 30 sailors and a contingent of 18 marines and is equipped with 30mm cannons and a landing pad for helicopters and drones. The ship had been sent to Barbados in early December to intercept drug traffickers, but its mission was changed on December 24, when it was sent to Guyana. Authorities did not specify when it was expected to arrive off Guyana’s shores. The UK’s Ministry of Defence said the ship would be conducting joint operations with Guyana’s defence forces. The nation of 800,000 people has a small military that is made up of 3,000 soldiers, 200 sailors and four small patrol boats known as Barracudas.

    "text": "The writer visits the site of the Simchat Torah Supernova Music Festival massacre near Kibbutz Re’im, last month.\nThe Jewish people continue to reel from the ramifications of the Hamas massacre over 100 days after this tragedy befell the State of Israel and world Jewry. So many of our brothers and sisters continue to be held hostage in Gaza. Tens of thousands are displaced from their homes in the North and Southwest of Israel.\nAnd a whole nation – both the State of Israel and the people of Israel – remains in a state of war, locked in a just battle to destroy the Hamas terrorist army.\nOctober 7 is a day that will truly live in infamy. As devastating as it was, the Jewish people are emerging stronger from this nightmare. Despite the rise of antisemitism – expressed in the denial of videotaped atrocities committed against Israeli civilians and the outrageous smearing of the Jewish state as “genocidal” – we are rallying.\nThere is a concept in politics of the levee en masse, a term drawn from the French Revolution, in which a whole society rises for its collective defense and identity. We have seen this mass mobilization, beginning after October 7 and continuing into the new year, despite the loud fringe elements who try to make it seem otherwise.\nRallying in support of Israel I see this in my own life – friends who have returned to attending synagogue services, wearing a Start of David necklace, or donning a yarmulke to express their solidarity with the Jewish people in the aftermath of October 7.\nThe largest gathering of Jews in the history of America occurred on November 14, when nearly 300,000 American Jews and allies gathered on the National Mall in Washington, DC to support our friends and family in Israel. Unity and solidarity continue to be the order of the day.\nHUNDREDS OF thousands rally in solidarity with Israel, in Washington, Nov. 14 (credit: PERRY BINDELGLASS/THE JERUSALEM POST)\nHUNDREDS OF thousands rally in solidarity with Israel, in Washington, Nov. 14 (credit: PERRY BINDELGLASS/THE JERUSALEM POST)\nThe extremists using Judaism as their shield blocking access to Grand Central Terminal in New York or chaining themselves to the White House do not represent American Jews nor the American people writ large.\nAn overwhelming majority of Americans say Hamas bears the responsibility for this war, including the majority of Republicans and Democrats, and the vast majority of American Jews support Israel in its war aims of bringing the hostages home and removing Hamas from power.\nThe terror that Hamas practices represents an existential danger not only for Israel, but for the United States, the West, and the entire world.\nOut of our unity and solidarity, we must fight libelous anti-Israel, anti-Zionist, and antisemitic narratives that are being propagated across the Internet.\nParticularly on social media platforms such as TikTok, misinformation and disinformation are flourishing. Congress and its partners are investigating how social media algorithms are elevating anti-Israel and antisemitic speech and how remedial action might be taken.\nI have spent much time in Israel since the October 7 atrocities. I see the focus and intensity of the Israeli people in this awful time and their commitment to destroy Hamas, liberate the hostages, and secure a safe future.\nJews in Israel and across the world, are taking constructive action driven by our despair and rage. For now, the center holds.\nThe writer is the CEO of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations (COP), the recognized central coordinating body representing 50 diverse national Jewish organizations on issues of national and international concern.

    "text": "British American Tobacco has been hit with a £100million fine after breaking competition rules in Nigeria.\nThe Federal Competition & Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) has brought the penalty after a three-year probe revealed the group abused its ‘dominance, seeking to frustrate competitors’.\nThe maker of Lucky Strike and Dunhill has agreed to pay the fine and will allow the commission to monitor its activities for two years to ‘ensure appropriate behavioural and business practices’.\nNigeria is a crucial market for cigarette companies, with one out of ten Nigerians smoking, according to research published by BMC Public Health.\nThe fine is also the highest ever levied by the Nigerian competition commission and adds to the misery for BAT, which is the world’s second-biggest tobacco group.\nSmokescreen: The Federal Competition & Consumer Protection Commission found BAT had abused its ‘dominance, seeking to frustrate competitors’\nIn April BAT agreed to pay £511million to US authorities after a subsidiary pleaded guilty to charges that it conspired to violate US sanctions by selling tobacco products to North Korea and commit bank fraud.\nThe US authorities said the settlement related to BAT activity in North Korea between 2007 and 2017. BAT said ‘we deeply regret the misconduct’.\nAnd the fine was shortly followed by the departure of chief executive Jack Bowles, who stepped down with immediate effect after 20 years at the business.\nThe FTSE 100 group, which is valued at around £51billion, provided few details on the abrupt exit of Bowles, who was replaced by finance director Tadeu Marroco.\nAnd in a further blow, BAT revealed it had taken a £25billion hit earlier this month after writing down the value of some of its US brands as tobacco sales tumble.\nThe company said Camel, Natural American Spirit, Newport and Pall Mall – which were acquired in a £40billion takeover of cigarette giant Reynolds American in 2017 – are now worth far less than anticipated.\nThe write-off sent shares down over 8 per cent, wiping £4.7billion off its value in one day.\nBig smoking firms have been on a mission to move away from tobacco as the number of regular smokers continues to slump.\nBut the shift towards vapes and nicotine alternatives is often a costly operation.\nCity analysts have previously slammed BAT’s performance as sluggish compared with its larger US competitor Philip Morris International (PMI), the maker of Marlboro. BAT shares remained flat yesterday but have fallen over a third this year.",
