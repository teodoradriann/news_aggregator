    "text": "As the NBA’s leading scorer in pursuit of a third consecutive scoring title, Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid is such a force that his absence causes reverberations throughout the team’s rotation.\nAfter going 0-4 this season when Embiid was not available, the 76ers managed to pull off a 112-92 road victory over the Orlando Magic on Wednesday as Embiid sat out a second consecutive game with an ankle injury.\nEmbiid will miss the third game of a four-game road trip when the 76ers face the Houston Rockets on Friday. He was still receiving treatment at the team’s facility near Philadelphia as of Wednesday.\nThe victory in Orlando not only served as a needed result, it also provided an optimal view of how Philadelphia can thrive without Embiid dominating as usual.\n“I just think that we’ve certainly got to find another style to play because it’s so different when he’s there,” 76ers coach Nick Nurse said. “Just playing better, or just playing well enough to give ourselves a chance to win is the main thing without Joel.”\nThe Sixers found success by utilizing a balanced attack paced by Tyrese Maxey’s 23 points, while Tobias Harris and De’Anthony Melton scored 22 apiece.\nPhiladelphia had been searching for that perfect blend of scoring distribution in its previous four games without Embiid.\n“It’s kind of the first time for that,” Nurse said. “Start with Tobias. He had a really good tempo. He really went when it was there, he held up and kind of played with a good rhythm when it wasn’t and got to spots where he wanted to get.\n“Melt, obviously, we’ll take that 4-for-7 every night from (3-point range). I think he’s a really good shooter and he needs to make some 3s for us because I think he’s had good looks this year.\n“(Maxey) read the game well. He blasted in there when he saw an opening. Played through some bumps (and) got some space for some 3s when those were open. We got him off the ball a little more, so he was a recipient of some weakside stuff too.”\nThe Rockets struggled with injury issues as well on Wednesday, as forward Dillon Brooks’ absence was felt in a 129-113 loss to the Phoenix Suns.\nBrooks (oblique strain) would have drawn the primary defensive assignment against Suns forward Kevin Durant. The Rockets were forced to pivot, and they ran multiple defenders at Durant in an attempt to make him a facilitator instead of a primary offensive linchpin.\nThat strategy backfired, as Durant tied a career high with 16 assists while also posting a game-high-tying 27 points.\nThe Rockets had their injury woes compounded when starting forward Jabari Smith Jr. departed in the third quarter with a left ankle sprain. He and Brooks will both sit out against Philadelphia.\n“We’ve obviously got to have performances from the guys that are available, bigger performances,” Rockets coach Ime Udoka said. “We’ve dealt with it a little bit this year with guys in and out, albeit a little different when you have starters missing. Other guys will get the opportunities. That’s where the depth comes in.”\n–Field Level Media",

    "text": "The Nintendo Switch 2 could sell over 4 million units in its first year in the US – but Sony's PS5 is still expected to perform better. Rumours point to an April launch (Nintendo)\nAlthough the Nintendo Switch 2 is expected to sell millions in the US alone, it's suggested it's first year won't be as strong as the original's.\nGiven how rabid anticipation is for the Nintendo Switch 2, it's unlikely the console will have any trouble selling at launch. In fact, Nintendo's apparently bolstering stock to prevent it from selling out, as well as mitigate the inevitable scalping issues.\nThat said, Nintendo would naturally want to see the Switch 2 outperform its older sibling. Obviously, it won't match the original console's lifetime sales overnight, but one analyst predicts it won't beat it at launch either.\nWhile there remains no word of an official reveal or release date from Nintendo, Matt Piscatella, executive director and industry analyst at Circana, has taken a crack at estimating the Switch 2's sales performance, at least in the US.\nIn a post on Bluesky, Piscatella predicts the Switch 2 will sell 4.3 million units in the US by the end of 2025. This is assuming the Switch 2 is released during the first half of this year.\nFor what it's worth, recent speculation and rumours point to Nintendo unveiling the console before…\nMichael Beckwith",

    "text": "Lakers Grab Potential Steal Big Man In Latest Mock Draft The 2024 NBA Draft is on Wednesday and Thursday. It's now a two-day event, with the Los Angeles Lakers having one pick each day, the No. 17 pick and the No. 55 pick. There's a ton of speculation about what the Lakers will do with their picks, especially their No. 17 pick. There's a big chance the Lakers trade their No. 17 pick in a package to get them an All-Star-level player, and we'll see if the team pulls the trigger. However, at the moment, L.A. has all its picks, and CBS Sports' latest mock draft by Kyle Boone has the purple and gold selecting the two-time National College Player of the Year, Zach Edey. \"With JJ Redick in place as the coach and the Lakers seemingly locked in on bringing in Bronny later in the draft, L.A. signals its intentions to remain competitive around LeBron with a win-now piece in Zach Edey, who can be a depth piece at center right away. Edey is coming off back-to-back player of the year seasons at Purdue,\" Boone said. Edey was college basketball's best player in the last two seasons, especially last season. He averaged 25.2 points per game, 12.2 rebounds, 2.0 assists, and 2.2 blocks. According to CBS Sports, he is the 23rd-ranked prospect and fifth in his position. The Lakers lack another big behind Anthony Davis, and an Edey selection would get them the biggest of men in the draft. The former Purdue Boilermaker is a mountain of a man standing at 7-foot-4 and weighing 299 pounds. The Canadian native is a promising prospect with some flaws, but his strengths could be a huge help for the Lakers. With his massive potential, L.A. could grab themselves a steal if he falls at No. 17. More Lakers: Trade Pitched to Ship LeBron James to Longtime Rivals",

Gen. Ronald Coleman, was the keynote speaker for the evening and stated, \"Every person here is an invaluable asset and is deeply appreciated,\" acknowledging the indispensable role each staff member plays in the recovery process. \"Your presence and engagement are critical to the recovery of our service members.\"\nLt. Gen. Coleman served as the deputy commandant for manpower and reserve affairs during the Wounded Warrior Regiment’s creation and personally oversaw the initiatives that make the regiment what it is today.\nFrom active-duty service members to dedicated civilian employees, every individual was hailed for their role in defining the Marine Corps' Recovery Care Program. Their collective efforts not only facilitate the swift return of wounded, ill, and injured Marines to duty but also support their transition to civilian employment.\nMoreover, the event spotlighted the invaluable partnerships forged with external organizations. Recognizing the vital role of these allies in providing support beyond military life, speakers expressed heartfelt gratitude for their enduring commitment to the Regiment's mission and its service members.\nWith each award presented and each word spoken, the evening served as a reminder of the Marine Corps' enduring promise: to stand by its own, to honor their sacrifice, and to ensure their well-being long after the battle is done. The awards stand as a testament to 17 years of unwavering commitment from the Wounded Warrior Regiment.\n|Date Taken:||05.03.2024|\n|Date Posted:||05.03.2024 15:48|\n|Story ID:||470285|\n|Location:||QUANTICO, VA, US|\n|Web Views:||3|\n|Downloads:||0|\nThis work, Marine Corps Association Awards Hosts 12th Annual Wounded Warrior Regiment Awards Ceremony, by\n[1LT Ryan Tobin](/portfolio/1811117/ryan-tobin), identified by DVIDS, must comply with the restrictions shown on https://www.dvidshub.net/about/copyright.\nNo keywords found.",

    "text": "site.btaCaptive-bred Egyptian Vulture Couple Produces First Offspring in the Wild At the end of June, the team of the Bulgarian Society for the Protection of Birds (BSPB) recorded the first successful breeding in the wild of an Egyptian vulture, which was hatched in captivity in the aviaries of the Green Balkans Wildlife Rescue Centre and released within the framework of the restoration programme of the species in Bulgaria. This is only the second such case in Europe and is a historic success for the recovery of the most endangered species on the Balkan Peninsula, BSPB said. The pair consists of Izzy, a female released in 2020, and Lucky, a wild male tagged with a GPS transmitter as a juvenile. They formed a pair two years ago, but only now managed to hatch not one, but two chicks. Izzy was hatched and raised in the Green Balkans Wildlife Rescue Centre in 2019 and a year later was released into the wild of the Eastern Rhodopes by the BSPB team. For the past five years she has travelled thousands of kilometres between her wintering grounds in Africa and her new home in the Eastern Rhodopes. Last autumn Izzy and Lucky migrated side by side as far as southern Turkiye, then parted ways, only to reunite this year in their breeding territory. By all accounts, they are both devoted parents and are carefully raising the fledglings in the nest. The Egyptian vulture population enhancement programme in Bulgaria started in 2018 and so far five of the released Egyptian vultures have reached sexual maturity and participated in pair formation in the wild, but this is the first successful breeding. The Egyptian Vulture Restoration Programme is implemented by BSPB, Green Balkans, the Prague Zoo, and the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA). The Egyptian Vulture Population Enhancement Programme was launched within the framework of the Egyptian Vulture New LIFE Project funded by the EU LIFE Programme and continues to be implemented through the Southeastern Bulgaria Green Belt Project, funded by the Endangered Landscapes Programme, which is managed by the Cambridge Conservation Initiative, a collaboration between the University of Cambridge and leading international organizations focused on biodiversity conservation. /RY/ news.modal.header news.modal.text",
