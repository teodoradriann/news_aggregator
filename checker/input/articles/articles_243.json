    "title": "50 Juvenile Texas Horned Lizards Released By San Antonio Zoo and Zoo Miami",
    "text": "The San Antonio Zoo and Zoo Miami announced yesterday the release of 50 Texas horned lizards ( Phrynosoma cornutum ) at a ranch in Blanco County, TX. The lizards came from seven clutches that were raised at the San Antonio Zoo’s Center for Conservation & Research (CCR). They were approximate 2.5 to 3.5 months old at the time of the release and weighed between 3.4 and 12 grams, according to a press release posted on the San Antonio Zoo’s Facebook page.\n“Participating in this release was a unique opportunity,” Dr. Andy Gluesenkamp, Director of the CCR said in the post on social media. “The presence of influential figures like Josh Abbott and international guests highlights the widespread support and enthusiasm for our efforts. By rigorously evaluating candidate release sites and partnering with landowners, we’re laying the groundwork for the successful reintroduction of this treasured species.”\nSince the Texas Horned Lizard Reintroduction Project launched in 2017, 258 captive born and bred lizards have been released into the wild. The project also relies on the The Texas Horned Lizard Detection Canine Network with assistance from Chiron K9 to track the movements of these lizards. The dogs are trained to smell the lizard’s scat, or poop, as they move about their new environments.",

    "text": "- A new photo shows the Ukrainian crew of the Bradley that fought and defeated a Russian T-90M tank.\n- A video of the battle went viral this week, showing the Bradley fighting vehicle pummeling the tank.\n- Putin has previously touted the T-90M as \"the world's best tank.\"\nA newly released photo shows the Ukrainian crew and the US-made Bradley infantry fighting vehicle that fought and won against one of Russia's top tanks.\nThe photo comes on the heels of a viral video earlier this week depicting an intense\nbattle between a Bradley and a Russian T-90M, a heavily armored tank Russian President Vladimir Putin once bragged was \"the world's best.\"\nThe Defense Ministry of Ukraine shared on Friday the photo, which came courtesy of the 47th Mechanized Brigade, of the Ukrainian M2A2 Bradley IFV crew responsible for defeating the Russian T-90M on the battlefield. This is them.\nTheir fight against the tank was caught on video, which was shared by Ukraine earlier this week. In the video, the T-90M is seen taking heavy, repeated fire from the Bradley's 25mm chain gun.\nThe battle between the lightly armored combat vehicle and the heavily armored Russian tank armed with a powerful 125mm cannon highlights\nhow valuable the Bradley can be on the battlefield. The vehicle first fielded in the 1980s can take on even modern tanks.\n\"Everyone has seen the video of how a Bradley fighting vehicle destroys a Russian T-90M \"breakthrough\" tank. However, no one has yet seen what these warriors look like with smelly nerves and thirst for victory,\" Ukraine's 47th Mechanized Brigade wrote in a Telegram post with the photo of the Bradley crew.\nThe post identified the men as Serhii, on the left, and Oleksandr, on the right. Before the war, one was a teacher, and the other was a motorcycle engineer, per a translation of the post.\n\"And now it is a powerful team, the strength of which lies in synergy,\" the post read.\nThe video of the fight between the Bradley and T-90M is the latest documenting the devastating\nfighting happening in Avdiivka, a city on the eastern front near occupied Donetsk. Since last October, Russia has been waging a vicious, costly offensive here, hoping to overwhelm Ukrainian defenses. So far, it has been unable to do so. Business Insider",

    "text": "Projections show that 98.6% of Canadians will have access to high-speed Internet by 2026\nOTTAWA, ON , Dec. 28, 2023 /CNW/ - No matter where you live, access to reliable, affordable high-speed Internet is essential. That's why the Government of Canada is working with provinces and territories, municipalities, Indigenous communities, and large and small Internet service providers to ensure that all Canadians are connected.\nToday, the Honourable Gudie Hutchings, Minister of Rural Economic Development and Minister responsible for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, updated Canadians on the Government of Canada's progress toward connecting all Canadians, no matter where they live, to high-speed Internet.\nA year of progress Thanks to the $3.225 billion Universal Broadband Fund (UBF), as well as other federal and provincial investments, the federal government is on track to exceed its goal of providing access to high-speed Internet to 98% of Canadian households by 2026 and 100% by 2030. Today, 93.5% of Canadian households have access to high-speed Internet compared to just 79% in 2014. Current projections show that 98.6% of households will have access by 2026.\nSince the launch of the UBF in November 2020 , 295 projects have been announced across Canada . This includes 45 projects in 2023 alone, which will serve more than 200,000 households. In 2023, 40,000 households also gained new access to high-speed Internet through completed UBF projects. The Government of Canada looks forward to announcing more UBF projects through 2024. Projects are posted online as they are announced.\nIn June 2023 , Minister Hutchings launched the government's redesigned website — canada.ca/rural . The interactive website is a source for rural Canadians to find relevant resources and information on Government of Canada programs, including the UBF.\nPartnering for success To help meet connectivity targets faster, the Government of Canada has also entered into co-funding partnerships with Quebec , Ontario , Newfoundland and Labrador , Alberta , British Columbia , and Prince Edward Island . With more than $2 billion in provincial co-funding secured, these partnerships allow for more households to be connected through UBF funding.\nMany provinces have made significant progress toward achieving universal connectivity already. With a total of $920 million in federal-provincial co-funding under Canada–Quebec Operation High Speed, Quebec has achieved our common goal of offering high-speed Internet access to all residents in the province. Many other provinces, including Prince Edward Island , New Brunswick , Ontario , British Columbia and Nova Scotia , are also very close to achieving universal connectivity.\nThe Government of Canada is working closely with all provinces and territories to help connect remaining underserved households. For the latest information on Canada's progress toward achieving universal high-speed Internet access, visit the interactive High-Speed Internet Access Dashboard . The dashboard allows Canadians to track national progress and government funding by province and territory.\nReal results, real progress These investments are making a real difference in peoples' lives, including by enabling them to access health care or expand their businesses.\nIn Iskatewizaagegan No. 39 Independent First Nation , also known as Shoal Lake No. 39 First Nation, community members are benefiting from improved access to reliable high-speed Internet. Residents can now access telehealth services, enabling people to meet with doctors virtually when in-person appointments are not possible. This has been an important benefit to Shoal Lake No. 39 First Nation and has improved residents' quality of life.\nElsewhere, in Port-Menier, Quebec , recent access to high-speed Internet has enhanced the village's tourism industry. Businesses in the community, located on Anticosti Island in the heart of the St. Lawrence, have improved their online visibility and increased their opportunities to market to tourists. Visitors can now enjoy the region's vast wilderness while staying connected to the rest of the world.\nThe work continues Since 2015, the federal government has allocated more than $7.6 billion for improving connectivity across Canada . These investments will level the playing field and ensure rural communities have equal ability to benefit from Internet access. The Government of Canada will continue working with provinces and territories, municipalities, Indigenous communities, and Internet service providers so that all Canadians, no matter where they live, have access to high-speed Internet as fast as possible.\nQuote \"High-speed Internet is no longer a luxury—it's a necessity. Thanks to our government, 93.5% of Canadian households now have access to high-speed Internet, compared to just 79% in 2014. We are on track to surpass our target of providing 98% of Canadians with high-speed Internet access by 2026 and all Canadians by 2030. I will continue to make sure rural Canadians have the access they need to affordable high-speed Internet connectivity.\" – The Honourable Gudie Hutchings, Minister of Rural Economic Development and Minister responsible for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency\nQuick facts Canada's Connectivity Strategy aims to provide all Canadians with access to Internet speeds of at least 50 megabits per second (Mbps) download / 10 Mbps upload. Since 2015, the Government of Canada has allocated $7.6 billion for building or improving broadband Internet infrastructure from coast to coast to coast. The Universal Broadband Fund (UBF) is a $3.225 billion investment by the Government of Canada designed to help provide high-speed Internet access to 98% of Canadians by 2026 and achieve the national target of 100% access by 2030. Of that amount, up to $50 million is allocated for mobile Internet projects that primarily benefit Indigenous people. Today, 93.5% of Canadian households have access to high-speed Internet compared to just 79% in 2014. The High-Speed Internet Access Dashboard is updated on a quarterly basis and allows Canadians to view national progress and government funding by province and territory. The National Broadband Internet Service Availability Map is an interactive tool that allows Canadians to find Internet service providers as well as connectivity projects under way in their area.
