    "text": "Fiscal de Nueva York demanda a distribuidores de vapeadores por dirigirse a menores\nLa fiscal de Nueva York, Letitia James, demandó a trece distribuidores de vapeadores por vender productos ilegales dirigidos a menores, exigiendo sanciones millonarias y la prohibición definitiva de su comercialización en el estado.\nEmpresas acusadas de comercializar productos ilegales y adictivos\nNueva York, Estados Unidos. — La fiscal general de Nueva York, Letitia James, presentó este jueves una demanda contra trece de los mayores distribuidores de vapeadores en Estados Unidos, acusándolos de vender cigarrillos electrónicos con sabores prohibidos y de dirigir su comercialización a menores de edad. Según la fiscal, estas empresas han favorecido el crecimiento de una “epidemia del vapeo” al atraer a jóvenes con productos altamente adictivos y estrategias de marketing engañosas.\nEmpresas involucradas y violaciones legales\nEntre las compañías demandadas se encuentran Puff Bar, Demand Vape, Evo Brands y Safa Goods, señaladas por vender cigarrillos electrónicos con sabores como caramelo y frutas, los cuales se han vuelto populares entre los adolescentes. James afirmó que ninguna de estas empresas cuenta con la autorización de la Administración de Alimentos y Medicamentos de Estados Unidos (FDA) para comercializar estos productos, lo que hace ilegal su venta bajo la legislación federal.\nTe puede interesar: Advierten que vapeadores son tan dañinos para dientes como el tabaco\nEn Nueva York, la venta de vapeadores aromatizados ha estado prohibida desde 2020. No obstante, la fiscal sostuvo que las compañías han continuado distribuyéndolos, desafiando las regulaciones estatales y federales.\nExigencias de la fiscalía\nLa demanda busca no solo un juicio contra las empresas involucradas, sino también que paguen cientos de millones de dólares en daños y perjuicios, además de sanciones económicas por violaciones a la ley. Asimismo, la fiscalía solicita la prohibición definitiva de la venta de estos productos en Nueva York.\nTambién te puede interesar: “Decomisan” 106 vapeadores en escuelas de nivel básico de Cajeme\nJames criticó duramente a la industria del vapeo, asegurando que está promoviendo la nicotina como algo atractivo y generando una crisis de salud pública. Además, denunció el uso de empaques brillantes, coloridos y campañas con influencers en redes sociales para captar la atención de menores.\nDurante demasiado tiempo, estas empresas han hecho caso omiso de nuestras leyes con el fin de sacar provecho de nuestros jóvenes\n— declaró la fiscal en un comunicado.\nSigue nuestro canal de WhatsApp\nRecibe las noticias más importantes del día.

    "text": "On Thursday, father and son duo Scott and Trace Kimple picked up used furniture around Lee in the Central Berkshire Habitat for Humanity ReStore truck.\nWhat You Need To Know Central Berkshire Habitat for Humanity has a ReStore, selling used furniture\nAll the proceeds from store sales go towards housing projects\nThey will usually ask a community if they have any resaleable goods to donate them for sale, then they go out and pick them up, free of charge\nThe ReStore picks up items Wednesday through Saturday The organization’s store sells used furniture, and all the proceeds go towards housing projects.\n“Once they’re sold, [it] goes into us being able to produce affordable housing,\" said Central Berkshire Habitat for Humanity CEO, Carolyn Valli. \"The other great thing about the ReStore is we literally keep tons of things out of the landfill.”\nOne of the organization’s mottos is \"recycle, reuse, reduce, rebuild.\" They will usually ask a community if they have any resaleable goods to donate them for sale, then they go out and pick them up, free of charge.\n“The money that we raise goes towards building homes for people with lower incomes, so it feels good to do something good for the community.\" said assistant manager, Trace Kimple.\nOnce the furniture is back at the store, they clean it up and fix any minor details before bringing it out onto the floor.\nWhen an item is sold the money goes to houses being built in the area by Habitat. They aim to build these houses for working families needing a hand up.\n“Our goal every year is to raise enough money to put in three foundations for homes,\" Valli said. \"So right now, we have five homes under construction between Pittsfield and Dalton. We have another five hopefully going up next year in Pittsfield, and we are working on a 20-unit development in Housatonic. So, obviously we need a lot of funds for a lot of foundations in order to make these projects work.\"\nThe Central Berkshire Habitat for Humanity ReStore picks up items Wednesday through Saturday, along with accepting donation drop-offs. Anyone interested in donating an item is asked to call ahead of time.",

    "title": "Children were shot and burned alive on October 7 forensic evidence shows",
    "text": "Warning: The article contains graphic descriptions. Viewer discretion is advised. Israel Police data released on Thursday revealed 27 children between the ages of 0-17 were [shot and burned alive on October 7](https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/by65800qmt). Commander Dudi Katz, the[Israel Police special investigations unit’s Lahav 433](https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hk4lv94ch#autoplay)’s cyber unit chief, was tasked with analyzing digital forensic evidence.One of the recordings received by the cyber team investigating one of the kibbutzim near the Gaza border featured a child's voice. The girl was on a call with the police emergency center while being held by a terrorist. She begged the terrorist to let her go, saying she was just a child and had school the next day. Despite the police dispatcher's pleas, the terrorist shot her to death. Her burnt remains were later located. This is just one of the many heartbreaking stories that police investigators have uncovered. The data, testimonies and hundreds of thousands of videos have been analyzed by Lahav 433, the national unit investigating the events of October 7. \"We collected 11,666 videos that provide a comprehensive evidentiary basis gathered from various sources from just one kibbutz, which will enable us to file some of the most severe indictments against the perpetrators of these brutal terror acts,\" said Superintendent Reut Anoim, head of Lahav 433’ cyber investigation division. The data and testimonies were also collected from [ZAKA Search and Rescue volunteers](https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjuj6mf9r)who operated in the kibbutz. Six days after the deadly assault began, ZAKA personnel returned to ensure no evidence was overlooked, guided by the smell of decay, flies and other signs.In one room, they found the small body of a child and the body of a woman in the stairwell. Both bodies were so badly burned they were nearly unrecognizable. The only thing left of the mother was her bra, and of the child, only ashes remained. \"Each cyber unit and the International Crime Investigations Unit was assigned to gather and analyze evidence based on specific areas. We relied on a web of testimonies collected from CCTV cameras in the affected towns, private homes near the Gaza border, testimonies from hostages, ZAKA volunteers, Hamas terrorists' body cameras and social media posts,” Anoim said. Any evidence that could not be verified was dismissed. \"All the materials we used helped complete an evidentiary framework as we worked hard to maintain the highest standards of verification and cross-referencing, compared to the fake materials circulating on social media,” she added, Katz explained the challenge was interpreting the significance of the evidence they located. \"As a law enforcement officer, I only work with definitive evidence. When I see a child shot with a severed finger, I can describe and document the scene but cannot definitively state the cause, as the finger may not have been intentionally severed but instead was injured by a fragment from the explosion in the safe room.\" However, Katz was unequivocal about one fact: the torture of children by Hamas' Nukhba terrorists. \"That children were burned, shot and murdered alongside their parents is a proven fact. Children witnessed their parents being murdered and we found a scene with a pile of bodies from the same family more than once.\" Among the other harrowing scenes was a photograph of a baby who was murdered alongside her father who tried to protect his family. She was the youngest victim of October 7. Another case that Katz said he would never forget was the tragic story of the Taasa family from Netiv HaAsara. The father, Gil, threw himself on a grenade that terrorists had tossed into their home to save his children from witnessing the horror. In another video, \"We identified a child around six or seven years old whose body was burnt, but his face remained intact. His glazed expression indicated that he had been burned alive,” Katz recounted. Over 90 members of Kibbutz Be'eri were murdered on October 7. The kibbutz secretary, Gal Cohen, said that the highest number of children murdered was in his community. \"What the children here went through is incomprehensible and we’re still burying our dead. This is an open wound, and we haven't digested it yet.” “We’re scarred, but we’re rebuilding and trying to recover. Parents and grandparents who lost their children and grandchildren have said they will never set foot in the kibbutz again because they see the victims everywhere they look,” he added.",
