    "title": "Happiness due to safety, security | Jordan Times",
    "text": "Safety and security are crucial factors that can significantly contribute to higher level of happiness within a country. In countries with lower crime rates and effective law enforcement, such as that in Jordan, citizens experience less fear of crime and violence. This reduction in fear and anxiety contributes to a greater sense of well-being and happiness and elevates a country on the World Happiness Index. Feeling safe while going about daily activities, such as walking alone at night or using public transportation, enhances individuals’ overall quality of life and hence happiness. Of course, other factors are involved in the ranking of happiness, for example Finland, being number one on the World Happiness Index 2023, is known for its strong social welfare system, high levels of trust in institutions, low crime rates and overall safety. Countries with trustworthy institutions, including police, judiciary and government agencies, foster a sense of confidence among citizens. When people believe that these institutions uphold their safety and rights, they experience higher levels of happiness. Denmark, number two on the World Happiness Index 2023, is another country that frequently ranks near the top of global happiness rankings. Like Finland, Denmark boasts a strong social welfare system, low levels of corruption, and high levels of trust in government and institutions. The country’s focus on work-life balance, quality healthcare and education also contributes to a sense of security and contentment among its citizens. Citizens of countries with safer environments can engage in activities they enjoy, such as outdoor recreation and leisure, without fearing for their safety. Iceland, number three on the World Happiness Index 2023, is renowned for its strong social cohesion, low crime rates, high levels of social support, effective governance, and a strong sense of community. Iceland’s emphasis on environmental sustainability and gender equality further enhances its residents’ overall well-being and happiness. A safe and secure environment attracts foreign investment and promotes economic growth. Higher economic opportunities and stability often lead to improved living conditions and, consequently, higher levels of happiness. Switzerland, ranked number four on the World Happiness Index 2023, its reputation as a safe haven for wealth preservation and financial stability has also led to significant inflows of foreign capital, particularly in the banking and finance sectors. The country’s strong rule of law, respect for property rights, and political neutrality further enhance its appeal as a destination for international investment. Switzerland is known for its high standard of living, low crime rates and efficient public services. A safe environment is especially important for the well-being and development of children. Children raised in safe and secure surroundings are more likely to grow up with a positive outlook and emotional well-being. Sweden, number seven on the index, prioritises child health and well-being through comprehensive healthcare services and preventive care programmes. Children have access to regular check-ups, vaccinations, and screenings, helping to promote their physical and mental health from an early age. Safety and security also promote social cohesion by creating an environment where people can interact, trust one another, and engage in communal activities. Strong social bonds contribute to happiness by providing a support system and a sense of belonging. Norway, number eight on the World Happiness Index 2023, frequently tops global happiness rankings, thanks in part to its robust social welfare system, high levels of income equality and strong sense of social trust. Norway’s focus on providing universal healthcare, quality education and ample social support contributes to a sense of security and stability among its population. Safety is closely tied to physical and mental health. Residents of safe countries are less likely to experience stress-related health issues. When people feel secure about their future and that of their families, they can focus on long-term planning and personal growth. This sense of stability contributes to happiness by reducing uncertainty. The sense of safety and security in Canada (number 15 on the index) contributes to lower levels of stress among its residents. Canadians generally feel safe in their communities and have confidence in their healthcare system, which provides comprehensive coverage for essential medical services through a publicly funded healthcare system known as Medicare. Countries known for safety and security attract tourism and cultural exchanges. These interactions can lead to greater exposure to different cultures and ideas, contributing to residents’ happiness through enriched experiences. For example, tourists are drawn to Germany for its rich history, diverse culture and stunning landscapes. From vibrant cities like Berlin and Munich to picturesque villages along the Rhine River, Germany offers a wide range of attractions and experiences for visitors to enjoy. Germany’s emphasis on cultural exchanges was evident in its willingness to accept Syrian refugees, and in its active NGO`s spread around the world, particularly in developing countries, such as FES, FNF and HBS.

    "title": "Leanna Madden from JohnSlots Shares Insights on the Importance of Online Slots Review",
    "text": "Leanna Madden from JohnSlots Shares Insights on the Importance of Online Slots Review\nHow many times have you taken a look at a product online and thought, yeah, I’ll get that, only to find a number of bad reviews advising you to steer away?\nWith the sheer number of products and services available on the internet, it’s impossible to know if something is good or bad from the description alone.\nOnline reviews are not only handy, they’re necessary to make wise purchasing decisions.\nOnline Slot Reviews\nThis is especially true when it comes to the iGaming scene. With the industry projected to hit nearly $160 billion by 2030, the competition between online casinos is fierce, and one of the biggest factors in their success is the quantity of games that they offer.\nIn 2024, the average online casino has hundreds of slot games for customers to choose from, and if there were no online slot reviews, it would only get harder for a customer to pick the best ones for them.\nWith this in mind, we recently had a talk with\nan online slot authority Leanna Madden from Johnslots. Being deeply involved in the intricacies of the industry, Leanna walked us through the importance of online reviews for customers, and why they’re so crucial for the casinos themselves.\nThe Importance of Trust\nFirst off, Leanna talked to us about finding trusted online slot reviews and why it is important to do so.\n‘At Johnslots, it’s my job to analyse a vast number of slots everyday, offering valuable insights for players based on RTP, volatility, themes, and gameplay. I can do this because I have a pulse on the industry. I know what it takes to make a good slot and, being so involved in the iGaming community, I understand what a wide range of players want to experience.\n‘But this isn’t the case for every slot reviewer. When reading a review, it’s important to know that it’s from a trusted source. It’s so hard to know when you’re behind a screen, but there are several ill-informed or fake reviews out there that are not posted for your benefit.\n‘Also, like I said before, I know what a good slot looks like, and my insights always cover everything you need to know. You need to make sure the reviews that you read are comprehensive, and cover a range of slot features, both positive and negative. Detail. That’s the key.’\nThe Meaning Behind RTP\nWe then asked Leanna about RTP, which seems to be one of the biggest factors in a user’s decision to play.\n‘It is, yes. That’s the first thing that the user will take into account when they come across a review, and the details will be filled in later. You always want to go for the best RTP slots – the ones that offer the best chances of winning and maximising payouts.\n‘But you also need to match this with your own risk preferences. The best reviews will talk about slot machine volatility, and will compare a slot in accordance to the slot machine volatility chart. Of course, we all want a high RTP. But how much are you willing to risk for larger payouts? A review will give you all the necessary information so that you can make informed decisions.’\nThemes and Gameplay\nOn a basic level, we also understand that online slot reviews are there to inform players about the gameplay and themes of the slot itself, and this is something we brought to Leanna at the end of our conversation.\n‘Yes,’ Leanna agreed with us. ‘If you’re browsing an online casino, you’re going to come across hundreds of slots, each one of which is advertised with a single, eye-catching image. They all look great, right? But it’s hard to really capture what you’re in for from a single image.\n‘An online slot review can give you a good indication without the player having to make a deposit in the first place. Let’s say you like history-themed games with a great soundtrack and fast, snappy gameplay. You’re not going to know that from a single image, so you need to read a good, comprehensive review to understand what you’re getting.\n‘You might also need the review to get to grips with the game itself! Not every slot is the same, so it can be helpful to read a review for guidance and to learn any winning strategies. But again, you have to trust the review first. If you do that, then you’ll find the game for you in no time at all, I’m sure of it!’\nGambling can be addictive, please play responsibly. Click\nHERE for more info.",

    "title": "Chinese initiatives foster world peace and development- CHINESE SOCIAL SCIENCES NET",
    "text": "Chinese initiatives foster world peace and development Passengers take a selfie in the coach of the Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Railway, which was jointly constructed by China and Indonesia under the Belt and Road Initiative, on Oct. 17. Photo: XINHUA In recent years, China has put forward several significant initiatives, such as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the Global Development Initiative (GDI), the Global Security Initiative (GSI), and the Global Civilization Initiative (GCI). These initiatives have garnered considerable attention from international media and academia. In a recent interview with CSST, Branislav Djordjevic, director of the Institute of International Politics and Economics in Serbia, expounded on the significance of these China-proposed initiatives to global peace and development. Principle of mutual benefit Throughout history, changes in the global order have always been accompanied by dramatic geopolitical shifts. Djordjevic noted that the world is undergoing transition from a unipolar order led by the United States to a multipolar order. “The key question we all face is not only how to secure better starting positions for our respective countries during this transition but also how to mitigate the consequences of the ensuing crises and wars for all of humanity,” he said. Actors who pursue mutually beneficial solutions will possess the potential to mobilize support from those who have long been dissatisfied with the inequalities, disorder, and injustices of the current world order. Djordjevic continued to say that the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed how small viruses can expose many vulnerabilities in the resilience of countries worldwide. The conflict in Ukraine has demonstrated how regional conflicts can escalate and turn into crises with global consequences for human security. A similar scenario unfolded in the recent war that started as a conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement “Hamas.” “Western attempts at de-coupling or de-risking cooperation with China have illustrated the vulnerability of global value chains and globalization in general,” he said. In this context, Djordjevic called for harmony instead of uniformity, dialogue instead of imposition, and an order based on international law and the UN Charter instead of “rules” defined by individual powers—these are the directions in which the world can mitigate crises and reduce tensions. Djordjevic emphasized that different countries have different views on the current transformation of the global order. “For some, this is a daunting prospect of losing dominant positions. For others, it is an opportunity to build a fairer and more equal order.” He suggested convincing each other of positive strategic intentions, which must be based on actions, in order to share the fruits of peace and development. Fruitful Chinese initiatives In Djordjevic’s view, the BRI has demonstrated exceptional success in its first decade of existence precisely for these reasons: it has shown results that have led to progress and development while respecting all participants without imposing or interfering in their internal affairs. The connectivity enabled by the BRI will continue to yield results, as it is focused on creating long-term infrastructural prerequisites for investment and trade development. In Africa alone, under the BRI, China has reportedly built around 100,000 kilometres of roads, 10,000 kilometres of railways, nearly 1,000 bridges, and nearly 100 ports. “The dearth of infrastructure represents the most significant impediment to African economic development. That is why China’s influence is profound in Africa, a continent where the average age of the population is 18.8 years and where 42% of the world’s youth will live in 2030,” Djordjevic commented. “This remarkable success has led to the proposal of new Chinese initiatives, including the GDI, GSI, and GCI, all of which have received a positive reception from the majority of countries around the world,” Djordjevic said. According to Djordjevic, the GDI can rekindle hopes of fulfilling the UN 2030 Agenda and thus have a positive impact on addressing the root causes of migration that create tensions within Europe. Within the framework of this initiative, China has already scored achievements by promoting specific technical cooperation in agriculture, the application of clean, green energy in industry, the promotion of alternative materials like bamboo, and digitalization in education. The GSI has drawn significant attention worldwide, mainly due to its timeliness and practical application, Djordjevic continued. It is based on principles acceptable to the vast majority of UN member states. Moreover, it is flexible enough to enable the resolution of various security challenges, even the most challenging diplomatic disputes marked by longstanding tensions. “China has demonstrated tremendous success in this field by directly mediating a deal between Iran and Saudi Arabia. In this way, China has not only effectively promoted the GSI as a concept but also its elements regarding how regional security can be achieved through compromise rather than forming alliances. In this case, the regional example can also serve as a model elsewhere in the world, not only in Eastern Europe but also in the Indo-Pacific region,” Djordjevic said. Djordjevic pointed out the GCI can demonstrate that differences among countries should be celebrated, particularly when it comes to protecting traditional cultures and values, which are the wealth of our world. Unfortunately, the recent tragic events in the Middle East are yet another proof that instead of extremism, violence, and intolerance, the world needs harmony, cultural exchange, and mutual learning between civilizations. “Respecting heritage and diversity is the only sustainable way to create interconnectedness, peace, and development in the world,” Djordjevic concluded.

    "text": "Donald Wildmon, founder of American Family Association, dies at 85 TUPELO, Miss. (WTOK) - The American Family Association reported the death of its founder, the Rev. Dr. Donald Wildmon Thursday in Tupelo. He was 85. Wildmon founded the Christian leadership organization in 1977 after becoming alarmed about content on television. At the time, he spoke out encouraging his church in Southaven to turn off TV for a week, which garnered local and national attention. Wildmon left the pastoral ministry when he founded the National Federation for Decency, which later became American Family Association. AFA has “remained on the front lines of America’s culture war”, according to its website. It’s now led by Tim Wildmon, the founder’s son. “My father was a man with great conviction and vision,” said AFA President Tim Wildmon. “He knew how important it was for Christians to remain firmly entrenched in their faith in the face of an openly immoral society, and he lived his life for the Gospel every single day. His heart for Christ and his passion for the American family will be sorely missed, but we on Earth can take comfort in knowing that he is at peace with his Heavenly Father, hearing the words, ‘Well done, my good and faithful servant.’” Wildmon began the American Family Radio network in 1991, which grew to 180 radio stations. The [AFA website](https://www.afa.net/) posted a memorial message Thursday. Copyright 2023 WTOK. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "A new NordPass survey has shed light on a concerning trend: India is using some of the weakest and most easily cracked passwords globally. In the sixth edition of its annual Top 200 Most Common Passwords report, which spans 44 countries, NordPass found that the infamous “123456” tops the charts as the most used password worldwide and in India. Out of over 3 million users globally who favoured this password, nearly 77,000 were from India. Another favourite, “123456789,” holds the second spot globally and ranks fourth in India. The study, done in collaboration with NordStellar, reveals that nearly half of the world’s most common passwords consist of easy keyboard patterns like “qwerty,” “123456789,” and “1q2w3e4er5t.” This trend is equally prevalent in India, where convenience often outweighs security. Commonly used weak passwords Managing passwords isn’t easy, with an average internet user juggling 168 personal and 87 work-related passwords, so people often default to simple, memorable options. Unfortunately, these choices make them vulnerable to hackers, as experts warn that many of these passwords can be cracked in under a second. One of the top offenders, “qwerty123,” is still widespread and features prominently in countries like the Netherlands, Finland, Canada, and Lithuania, as well as in India’s top 10 list. The word “password” itself is another common pick, now ranking as the second most used password in India and a favourite in places like Australia and the UK. In India, there is a hint of cultural flair in passwords, with variations like “Indya123” replacing “India123.” Other frequently used passwords include “admin” and “abcd1234,” echoing past trends of choosing simple, easily guessed patterns. The survey highlights a worrying statistic: 78 per cent of the world’s most common passwords can be cracked in under a second, up from 70 per cent last year. This increase indicates that password safety is getting worse, not better, despite growing awareness. Corporates rely on generic passwords The situation isn’t any better in the corporate world. According to NordPass, nearly 40 per cent of common passwords are used interchangeably between personal and business accounts. Business users often default to generic passwords like “newmember,” “newpass,” “welcome,” and “newuser.” Worse still, many employees stick with initial default passwords like “admin” or “temppass,” creating a major security risk. Reusing passwords across personal and work accounts further exposes organisations to cyber threats. The findings underscore the urgent need for stronger, more unique passwords and better security practices, both for individuals and businesses, to mitigate the rising risk of data breaches.",
