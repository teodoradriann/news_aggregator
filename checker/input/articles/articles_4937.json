    "title": "Friday forecast: Snow, ice, rain, wind wreak havoc",
    "text": "Winter's brutal grip is continuing Friday for millions across the eastern U.S. as temperatures remain well below average. Along with the cold, lake-effect snow is flying near the Great Lakes and an ice storm threatens portions of the central U.S. Meanwhile in the West, an atmospheric river event will bring very heavy rain, mountain snow, and gusty winds to portions of southern Oregon and northern/central California Friday into Saturday, the National Weather Service said. Arctic plunge in the East High temperatures will remain cold and below average Friday for much of the north-central and eastern U.S.after a cold front passes through, the weather service predicted. Forecast highs will range from the teens and 20s for the northern Plains, Great Lakes, and interior Northeast to the 50sacross the Southeast. Some good news: The Arctic plunge of air will quickly pivot eastward and then off the Atlantic coast this weekend, AccuWeather said. \"As the core of the coldest air shifts eastward, temperatures will begin to rebound in the Midwest as early as Friday, then (in) the East on Saturday,\" AccuWeather meteorologist Alex Sosnowski said in an online forecast. Lake-effect in the Great Lakes Most lake-effect snow in the Northeast is expected to taper off Friday morning except for areas downwind of Lake Ontario, where an additional 6-12 inches can be expected through the day Friday, according to the National Weather Service . \"Travel will be very difficult with deep snow cover on roads and very poor visibility,\" the weather service warned. Iowa ice storm Snow, sleet, and freezing rain will impact portions of the Central Plains through the Upper Midwest beginning tonight, the weather service said. Freezing rain is expected to be the most significant hazard, with as much as 0.25 inch of ice accumulating. East-central Iowa, including the city of Cedar Rapids, is in the region where the most ice is expected. \"Some power outages and tree damage are likely due to the ice and wind,\" the weather service in Des Moines said. \"Travel could be nearly impossible as roads, and especially bridges and overpasses, will become slick and hazardous tonight into Saturday morning. \"Travel is strongly discouraged. If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food and water in your vehicle in case of an emergency. If you are going outside, watch your first few steps taken on stairs, sidewalks, and driveways. These surfaces could be icy and slippery, increasing your risk of a fall and injury,\" the weather service said. Western storms A pair of storms forecast to roll ashore at the end of the week has the potential to trigger significant power outages and travel problems from California to Washington, AccuWeather meteorologists say. Rain, snow, and wind will all be in the forecast over the next couple of days. Rainfall totals of 3-5 inches, with isolated higher amounts upwards of 7 inches, may lead to some instances of flooding during the height of the event Friday evening/overnight into Saturday morning, the weather service said. In addition, \"winds can become strong enough in portions of northern and central California and western Washington and southern British Columbia to trigger local to regional power outages,\" AccuWeather senior meteorologist Adam Douty said in an online forecast. Very heavy mountain snow is also expected at higher elevations (generally over 5000-6000 feet) of the Coastal Ranges and for the Sierra Nevada, the weather service said. Winter storm warnings have been issued for forecast snowfall totals of 1-2 feet, locally higher. Little to no rain is likely in Southern California from the storm farther north in the state this weekend, AccuWeather added.",

    "title": "马上评丨奇葩职场管理，呼唤劳动监察执法更到位|劳动法_新浪财经_新浪网",
    "text": "近日，以生产牙线闻名的小鹿妈妈公司，被曝存在“无固定午休时间”“禁止工位放置私人物品”“强制员工工位就餐”等严苛规定，引发公众热议。合肥市庐阳区劳动保障监察大队告诉媒体，对该公司展开调查，已经立案。\n从网友曝出的细节看，“小鹿妈妈”对员工的管理可谓事无巨细，苛刻到了极致，不仅桌面摆放什么要管，连员工的行动自由也要强制干预——全天禁止外出，禁止使用手机，也难怪员工会吐槽。\n“小鹿妈妈”的种种做法，绝非简单的管理不够人性化的问题，在倡导“反内卷”的当下，限制员工的休息权甚至行动自由，已经涉嫌违反劳动法规。\n根据《劳动法》规定，标准工作时间应为八小时，若工作时间超出八小时，公司应向员工支付加班费，并且中午应有一小时的午休时间用于吃饭休息等活动。禁止员工午休，也不让员工外出，无疑有违劳动法的规定。\n另据媒体报道，“小鹿妈妈”不给试用期的员工缴纳社保，这也违背了《劳动合同法》和《社会保险法》等相关规定。\n此事曝光后，很多网友大为震惊，在今天竟然还有如此“严酷”的职场氛围，实在匪夷所思。涉事公司管理手段的苛刻、奇葩，这种明目张胆侵犯劳动者权益的行为，为何能够堂而皇之地存在？\n在网上，不少“小鹿妈妈”的前员工站出来现身说法，吐槽涉事公司的管理。这表明，这家公司对员工的苛刻管理，并非一朝一夕之事，而是由来已久。其背后反映出企业和员工之间地位的不对等，也折射出当下劳动者权利保护还存在薄弱地带。\n现实中，类似极端、苛刻的企业管理规定，可谓不胜枚举。比如前不久就有媒体曝光，广东佛山一家企业发布《如厕管理规范》，规定上厕所不能超过2分钟，特殊情况还得找人力报备。\n相较于用人单位，劳动者往往处于弱势地位，面对企业的侵权行为，他们可能因害怕失去工作、维权成本过高等原因，而选择忍气吞声。这种隐忍，在无形中助长了用人单位侵犯员工权益和尊严的底气。\n面对类似的职场乱象，劳动者要勇敢地站出来依法维权。但更重要的是，劳动执法部门要切实履行监管职责，加强执法力度，及时制止企业的违法违规行为，为劳动者的合法权利撑腰。目前，当地有关部门已经介入调查，如果问题属实，必须严肃查处，及时纠偏。\n“小鹿妈妈”并非什么无名小公司，很多地方都能看到它的广告。因为苛刻的管理规定，卷入舆论风波中，让公司形象遭受重创，无疑也是一个深刻的教训。\n说到底，人是发展的根本目的，企业的发展壮大不能以牺牲员工利益为代价。尊重劳动者的合法权益，遵守劳动法的相关规定，构建和谐健康的职场环境，才能赢得员工的认同，企业自身也才能长远发展。",

    "text": "The cryptocurrency exchange BISSNEX has recently completed key market expansion actions and gained increased recognition from the U.S. federal government and financial systems. BISSNEX's acquisition of the U.S. MSB license signals the continuous strengthening of the platform's capabilities and the adjustment of its global market strategy.\nFollowing the challenging progress of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF proposals, the U.S. has shown rising friendliness towards the crypto industry, supporting cryptocurrency taxation as property. Although their overall attitude towards cryptocurrencies remains cautious, as the industry continues to evolve, governments worldwide are gradually implementing trading and regulatory standards for the crypto industry. The widespread circulation of mainstream cryptocurrencies has made BISSNEX particularly attentive to expanding into the U.S. market.\nThe International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) previously released the \"Consultation Report on Policy Recommendations for Crypto-Asset and Digital Asset Markets,\" indicating further progress in global crypto industry regulation standards. Soon after, BISSNEX obtained the Money Services Business (MSB) license from the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a milestone demonstrating BISSNEX's compliance with the highest industry standards in Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) practices. The platform will expand its services with higher compliance standards and strict regulatory requirements.\nSince its establishment, BISSNEX has been committed to creating a safe and legal trading environment to ensure the best protection for users' interests and assets. The acquisition of the U.S. MSB license is a significant achievement in BISSNEX's compliance efforts, representing its leading position in trading compliance. The granting of this license requires exchanges to undergo rigorous due diligence to ensure compliance with the highest financial regulatory standards.\nIn the U.S. states of New York and California, cryptocurrencies are considered legal digital assets. Based on its global market strategy, BISSNEX has strategically established its headquarters in New York, a decision made after careful consideration of the global regulatory environment of cryptocurrencies. The U.S., particularly New York, is known for its stringent regulatory framework, providing a solid foundation for financial business expansion. BISSNEX recognizes the importance of working closely with regulatory authorities to create a safe and sustainable cryptocurrency trading environment.\nBISSNEX is positioned at the forefront of compliance in the crypto industry. As a global financial centre, New York offers abundant financial resources and professional talent, providing BISSNEX with ample development opportunities. BISSNEX has also announced plans to expand its compliance team, recruiting various talents specializing in cryptocurrency regulations. This team will work tirelessly to ensure BISSNEX's operations comply with all relevant local and international regulations, providing users with peace of mind during trading. In addition to advancing compliance work, BISSNEX actively collaborates with regulatory bodies and industry associations to stay abreast of the latest developments in the cryptocurrency field.\nAs the crypto industry continues to evolve, BISSNEX remains firmly committed to operating with the highest compliance and security standards. The acquisition of the MSB license is a clear practice of this commitment, demonstrating BISSNEX's determination to provide a safe and compliant trading environment for its users.\nDisclaimer: This press release may contain forward-looking statements.
