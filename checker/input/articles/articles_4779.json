    "text": "The New York Times has filed a lawsuit against tech giant Microsoft and AI developer OpenAI in a legal maneuver that could reshape the intersection of artificial intelligence and journalism. T\nThe lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, contends that Microsoft, a key investor, and provider of cloud computing technology to OpenAI and OpenAI itself, owes “billions of dollars in statutory and actual damages” for the “unlawful copying and use” of The Times’s content. The newspaper asserts that the AI models developed by the defendants, notably GPT-4, directly compete with its content and limit commercial opportunities.\nThe New York Times acknowledges the potential benefits of AI, stating, “recognizes the power and potential of GenAI for the public and journalism.” However, it emphasizes the neneedor journalistic material to be used only for commercial gain permission from the source. The lawsuit alleges that Microsoft and OpenAI failed to seek such consent.\nOpenAI, responding to the legal action, expresses surprise and disappointment, noting ongoing productive conversations with The New York Times. The AI developer emphasizes its commitment to respecting the rights of content creators and suggests a hope for a mutually beneficial resolution.\nThe legal proceedings involve Susman Godfrey, the litigation firm known for representing Dominion Voting Systems in a high-profile defamation suit against Fox News. The lawsuit against Microsoft and OpenAI echoes a separate case where author Julian Sancton and other writers accused companies of using copyrighted materials without permission to train AI models, including ChatGPT.\nConcerns among media publishers about AI models utilizing their content without proper authorization have grown, with generative AI tools such as ChatGPT producing outputs that sometimes closely resemble the source material. Publishers fear potential impacts on traffic and revenues as AI-generated content competes with original journalism.\nThe lawsuit highlights instances where GPT-4 allegedly produced altered versions of New York Times articles. The Times argues that AIroducing and modifying its content limits the AI model’s commercial opportunities and infringes on copyrightable expression. Examples cited include removing product links from The Times’s Wirecutter app, impacting potential referral revenue.\nAs the legal battle unfolds, it brings to the forefront the intricate challenges and ethical considerations surrounding the use of AI in journalism, questioning the boundaries of fair use and the need for collaborative frameworks between technology developers and content creators.",

    "text": "New law in Ohio cracks down on social media use among kids: What to know [Kayla Bennett](https://www.dispatch.com/staff/8401066001/kayla-bennett/) Starting in January a new state law will make it harder for children under 16 to access social media in Ohio. On Jan. 15, [Ohio’s Social Media Parental Notification Act](https://governor.ohio.gov/administration/lt-governor/071123) will go into effect, and big name companies will have until then to comply. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed the state’s annual budget in July, which included the Social Media Parental Notification Act. Here's everything to know about Ohio's new law and how it works. What is Ohio's new social media law? The law requires companies to obtain parental consent to contractual terms of service from a parent or legal guardian before individuals younger than 16 can use the companies' platforms. This includes social media and online gaming or activity companies, such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok and Snapchat. It does not pertain to e-commerce platforms. If a parent or legal guardian fails or refuses to consent to the terms of service, the company must deny the child access or use of the platform. How do companies obtain consent? Companies will have to follow certain steps in order to consent from a parent or legal guardian. The steps include creating a method to determine whether the user is a child under the age of 16 and obtaining verifiable parental or legal guardian consent If the user indicates that they are under the age of 16, the following methods can be used for verification: - Sign a digital form consenting to the terms of service - Use a credit card, debit card, or other online payment system - Call a toll-free telephone number - Connect to trained personnel via video-conference - Check a form of government-issued identification Companies then must send the written confirmation of the consent to the parent or legal guardian. Why is this happening? Lt. Gov. Jon Husted pushed for the new law. He believes social media is designed to be addictive and is harming the mental health of children. He said it’s time that parents have more say in the digital lives of their children. \"We hope that more parents will either prohibit or limit the amount of interaction their children are having, amount of time their children are spending on their devices, on these apps, and put filters on it to make sure that it is limiting the age-level content if they really want their children to be seeing,\" Husted said. Some companies, like Meta, already have support features Companies like Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and other platforms, already have features in place to support teenagers and their families when using their platforms. For example, Meta has age verification technology that helps users experience appropriate content and accounts for their age. Accounts are also automatically set to private for individuals under the age of 16. Rachel Holland, a Meta spokesperson, said the company wants young people to have a safe and positive experience across the internet and that’s why they’ve built safety and privacy features into teen experiences. “We’ve developed more than 30 tools to support families, including parental supervision tools that allow teens and parents to navigate social media safely together and tools to help ensure teens have age-appropriate experiences online,” Holland said in a statement. Meta's Director of Global Head of Safety Antigone Davis recently [wrote a blog post](https://medium.com/@AntigoneDavis/parenting-in-a-digital-world-is-hard-congress-can-make-it-easier-6039e7a350b1) calling for a solution to parental consent. \"Parents should approve their teen’s app downloads, and we support federal legislation that requires app stores to get parents’ approval whenever their teens under 16 download apps,\" Davis wrote. She believes the industry should come together with lawmakers to create simple, efficient ways for parents to oversee their teens' online experiences. Instagram is now [supporting federal legislation](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/wBqFCW6KY7iDgE7z9TK9UfX?domain=about.instagram.com). “We’ll continue evaluating proposed legislation and working with policymakers on developing simple, easy solutions for parents on these important industry wide issues,” Holland said. Will Ohio's new law stick? Other states have passed laws pertaining to children’s privacy on social media platforms. However, judges have blocked those laws in some states, like in Arkansas following a lawsuit from NetChoice, a coalition of trade associations, e-commerce businesses and online consumers. NetChoice submitted [opponent testimony](https://netchoice.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/NetChoice-Opposition-to-Sub.-H.-B.-No.-33-Ohio-Unlawful-takings.pdf) for Ohio’s new legislation. Other states, like [Utah](https://socialmedia.utah.gov/#:~:text=Starting%20on%20March%201%2C%202024,access%20to%20their%20child%27s%20account), will be joining Ohio in having legislation take effect next year. In other states, Husted said, social media and online gaming or activity companies have been cowardly in the actions they’ve taken against the legislation. He said rather than stepping out in public, companies just file lawsuits to try and prevent the laws from going into effect. “I fully expect that that's being contemplated in Ohio, and I will give them fair warning that if they don't comply with this, what we simply have asked them to do, that we will be more aggressive in what we do in response,” Husted said. Companies, if they do not comply, will face civil penalties and fines, which are listed out in the [law’s revised code](https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-revised-code/section-1349.09).

However, it failed to acknowledge the simple fact that products of mining are not only essential for our modern lifestyle, but also help to insure America’s continued prosperity. We use products from mining in our homes, businesses and routine daily activities. This is unlikely to change in the foreseeable future. Those who demonize mining refuse to recognize industry’s efforts to resolve environmental issues resulting from historical mining activities as well as its development of new technologies and mining practices that minimize negative impacts from current and future operations. Improvements can be made to further reduce many of its undesirable impacts. Today’s mining professionals are working hard to make this a reality. We welcome constructive advice from all stakeholders on how to responsibly meet our nation’s demand for mined products.

    "text": "El presidente palestino, Mahmud Abás, pidió hoy el fin del \"rio de sangre\" y de los \"inmensos sacrificios\" del pueblo palestino en un mensaje de felicitación de Navidad, celebración que cobra especial relevancia en Belén, donde la tradición cristiana ubica el nacimiento de Jesús. \"El río de sangre, los inmensos sacrificios, las penurias y la heroica resiliencia de nuestro pueblo en su tierra son el camino hacia la libertad y la dignidad\", afirmó el presidente de la Autoridad Palestina, que gobierna zonas reducidas de Cisjordania ocupada. Cada 24 de diciembre, Belén -centro de la comunidad cristiana palestina- celebra un tradicional desfile con bandas de música, previo a la llegada del Patriarca Latino de Jerusalén a pie para oficiar una misa en la Iglesia de Santa Catalina, la parte católica basílica de la Natividad. Pero este año, el patriarca Pierbattista Pizzaballa -el enviado religioso del Vaticano a Tierra Santa- llegará a Belén en una procesión solemne, sin música ni actos festivos, de luto por el alto número de muertos palestinos en la guerra en la Franja de Gaza, que superan los 20.200 mientras prosigue la ofensiva israelí. Cisjordania ocupada también ha vivido su año más mortífero desde 2002, el pico de violencia de la Segunda Intifada, con unos 510 muertos, más de la mitad desde el 7 de octubre, cuando comenzó la guerra en el enclave. Abás expresó hoy, día de Nohebuena, su esperanza de que esta Navidad marque el cese de la guerra israelí contra el pueblo palestino en Gaza y el resto de territorios palestinos ocupados, deseando \"prosperidad y estabilidad para el pueblo palestino y todas las naciones\". \"El sol de la libertad y [nuestro] Estado independiente con Jerusalén como capital está inevitablemente surgiendo, casi a nuestro alcance\", afirmó el presidente en su discurso de Navidad. \"El pueblo palestino está decidido a continuar su lucha para lograr sus derechos legítimos, el principal de los cuales es el derecho a un Estado independiente y plenamente soberano, donde puedan vivir con dignidad en su patria\", agregó. El presidente palestino también rindió homenaje a los miles de \"mártires de Palestina\", deseó una pronta recuperación para los heridos, libertad para los prisioneros y oró por la preservación del pueblo palestino en Gaza, Cisjordania, Jerusalén y la diáspora.

    "text": "OpenAI hits $12 bln in annualized revenue, sees higher costs\nOpenAI’s annual revenue just about doubled in the first seven months of 2025, reaching $12 billion in annualized revenue, although costs were also seen rising, The Information reported on Wednesday, News.az reports citing BBC.\nThe figure implied OpenAI was generating $1 billion a month, as weekly active users for its ChatGPT suite surged to about 700 million, the report said, citing a source.\nBut the artificial intelligence startup also hiked its cash burn projection to $8 billion in 2025, up $1 billion from earlier projections.\nThe Microsoft-backed startup is lining up investors for the second $30 billion of a recent funding round, The Information reported, with Sequoia Capital and Tiger Global Management investing hundreds of millions in the round.\nOpenAI is gearing up to release its GPT-5 AI model in the first week of August, which is expected to be the most advanced model by the company.\nThe start-up largely kicked off the ongoing AI race with the release of its ChatGPT platform in late-2022, which was one of the fastest growing apps of all time.",

    "text": "Meghan Markles „magische Blumenstreusel“ bieten Steilvorlage für lustige Parodien\nMit ihren fragwürdigen Lifestyle-Tipps sorgte Meghan Markle zuletzt für hämische Kommentare. Während eines Auftritts verteidigte die Herzogin jetzt unter anderem ihre vielfach kritisierte Blumendeko.\nNew York – Ihre Netflix-Show „With Love, Meghan“ sollte Meghan Markle (43) eigentlich als Expertin in Lifestyle-Fragen etablieren. Der Versuch ging jedoch ziemlich nach hinten los, denn die Ehefrau von Prinz Harry (40) machte sich mit ihren seltsam anmutenden Küchentipps in den sozialen Netzwerken zum Gespött der Zuschauer. Insbesondere die essbaren getrockneten Blüten, die laut Meghan selbst den einfachsten Gerichten einen Gourmet-Anstrich verleihen, führten im Netz zu zahlreichen Parodien.\nMeghans „magische Blumenstreusel“ sorgen für Lacher auf Social Media\nEines steht fest: „With Love, Meghan“ hat die Herzogin von Sussex zweifelsohne wieder einmal ins Gespräch gebracht. Seit der Veröffentlichung der Netflix-Produktion häufen sich die Satire-Posts auf Instagram, TikTok und Co., wobei vor allem die „magischen Blumenstreusel“ der zweifachen Mutter für Kopfschütteln sorgen. Bei der fraglichen Essensdeko handelt es sich um getrocknete Blüten, die Meghan liebend gerne über Rührei, Salate und Joghurtspeisen streut.\nDass sie selbst ganz und gar überzeugt von der beeindruckenden Wirkung ihrer essbaren Blumen ist, veranlasste seitdem zahlreiche Social-Media-Nutzer zu Parodien von „With Love, Meghan“. Kurzerhand werden Blütenblätter jetzt über alles gestreut – auch auf das Butterbrot. Während eines öffentlichen Auftritts in New York verteidigte Meghan ihre „magischen Blumenstreusel“ jetzt jedoch vehement.\nLaut Meghan sind die getrockneten Blüten mehr als nur Deko auf dem Teller\nBeim „Time100“-Gipfel bezeichnete Meghan Markle ihre vielfach kritisierten Blütenstreusel als eine Art „Analogie“, denn laut der Herzogin stehen die essbaren Blumen für mehr als nur Deko. „Lasst uns über die Blumenstreusel reden“, erklärte Meghan „The Daily Beast“-Berichten zufolge im Gespräch mit „Time“-CEO Jessica Sibley, „denn ich glaube es geht um die kleinen Momente der Freude, die so mühelos sind und einfach das kleine bisschen Magie erschaffen, nach dem wir uns alle in unserem Alltag sehnen.“\nOffenbar scheint Meghan also eine regelrechte Philosophie in ihren Blumenstreuseln zu sehen. Dass zahlreiche Social-Media-User anderer Meinung sind, interessiert die Ex-Schauspielerin dagegen nur wenig. Angesprochen auf die Parodien im Netz, entgegnete sie amüsiert mit einem Zitat der Komikerin Tina Fey (54): „Wenn du jemals anfängst zufrieden mit dir zu sein, gibt es dieses Ding namens Internet, da kannst du viele Menschen finden, die dich nicht mögen.“ In Zukunft könnten Meghan Markle und Prinz Harry übrigens ihre Titel verlieren.

    "text": "Missing hiker found alive after being lost for 10 days in mountains SANTA CRUZ COUNTY, Calif. (KSBW) - A missing hiker was finally rescued after he was lost for 10 days in the Santa Cruz Mountains of California. The 34-year-old man was only going for a three-hour hike when he disappeared. “I didn’t bring anything because I thought I was doing a three-hour hike to go to work,” Lukas McClish, the rescued hiker, said. He was lost in the woods for nine nights and 10 days, shirtless with only a flashlight and folding scissors. It would be more than a week before the raggedy-looking hiker would be found. “So, I kind of just hiked. Each day, I go up a canyon, down a canyon to the next waterfall, sit down by the waterfall, drink water out of my boot,” Lukas McClish recalled. It was a Tuesday when Lukas McClish went for a hike in Boulder Creek and ended up getting lost. “I felt comfortable the whole time I was out there. I wasn’t worried about it,” Lukas McClish said. “I had a mountain lion that was following me, but it was cool. It kept its distances. I think it was just somebody watching over me.” The problem was that Lukas McClish didn’t tell anyone where he was going. By the time Father’s Day rolled around on Sunday, his family started worrying and filed a missing person’s report. The search was on then. “Some nights, although, I just had to trust God that he was going to be OK, and that was hard to do some nights when we would go to bed at night because I would worry about where he was, where he was sleeping and how cold he was and where he was if he was alive,” Diane McClish, the hiker’s mother, said. Lukas McClish drank from water from creeks, ate wild berries and slept on a wet bed of leaves all while yelling for help and thinking of his next meal. “‘Just help. Help, I’m over here.’ Or, ‘Is anybody out there?’” Lukas McClish remembered saying while he was lost. “I want a burrito or a taco bowl. That’s what I thought about every day when I, after the first five days, when I started to kind of realize that I might be in over my head.” But on Thursday afternoon, someone finally heard his cries for help. The Boulder Creek Fire Department deployed a drone and spotted his location. A K-9 tracked him down and Lukas McClish was escorted out of a remote canyon, finally reunited with family. “Met a lot of people because I had more people come to me and tell me how much they love my son and how they just hoped that we would find him,” Diane McClish said. “I didn’t realize that so many people in this town love Luke.” Fortunately, Lukas McClish had no major injuries.

    "text": "Kalna: As the bell rings, students milling around in the grounds quickly move to their classrooms. The classes begin, and the lectures of the teachers can be heard standing in the corridors. Everything seems normal in the Kishoriganj Manmohanpur Free Primary School in the Nasratpur area of Kalna sub-division in Purba Bardhaman district of West Bengal until one pips into the kitchen.\nFor the past several years, the midday meal has been cooked in two times in a separate set of utensils. The division gets stark from the gas cylinder itself, with one pipe being divided into two parts for different ovens. The school in Purbasthali I block of the district has 72 students, of whom 43 are Hindus and 29 are Muslims. The school management, those involved in cooking midday meals, as well as the headmaster, say the segregation of utensils and the process of separate cooking have been going on for a long time.\nRanu Bibi has been cooking midday meals in the primary school for many years. \"We have always been cooking in two sets. The children of both religions are also served separately. We know it is a bad practice, but we hardly have a choice other than following the school administration's guidelines,\" she said.\nSonali Majumdar, another cook assigned to prepare food for the other community, said, \"Only the gas connection is from one cylinder; the rest are separate. It is unfortunate, but we just follow what we are told to do.\"\nPrincipal Tapas Ghosh stresses that there is no conflict in the school over religion. \"There is no problem in the school, and no religious conflict has ever arisen over the arrangement. Students attend classes and study together. But the food is cooked separately. I have been seeing this since my first day here. Several attempts to end the practice have proved futile. The expenses are also high due to this practice, and I have informed the school education department as well as the district administration,\" Ghosh said.\nThe district administration has swung into action after the matter went public. \"An enquiry has been ordered and steps will be taken after we get the report,\" Ayesha Rani, district magistrate of Purba Bardhaman, said.\nNasratpur Residents are Still Divided\nResident Amit Hazari said, \"The practice of cooking separately for both faiths has been followed by the primary school for a long time. The decision was taken after receiving consent from both sides.\" Parimal Mandal, whose son studies in the school, also favours the practice.\nHowever, Ganesh Gonsai and Hussein Ali say the practice of cooking and serving midday meals separately should end. \"If they can study and play together, where is the problem in eating together?\" Local Trinamool leader Ahmed Ali Sheikh said, \"Students study together, but the meal is cooked separately. The headmaster has informed us about the situation. This should end, as it is shameful,\" he said.\nPaushali Chakraborty, district project officer and midday meal in charge of Purba Bardhaman, said, \"The committee has been constituted and the matter is being looked into.\" Officials at the school education department have informed that the committee headed by the Joint BDO will be probing the matter and submitting a report soon.\nState Minister and Kolkata Mayor Firhad Hakim has expressed strong displeasure over the incident. \"Whoever did this did it wrong. This is not the culture of Bengal. We have always seen students of each faith sharing a single tiffin. The education department should take action against those trying to keep the practice alive. This is a shameful incident for me. My close friends in school were of different faiths, and we grew up sharing each other's food. The evil practice of the Bardhaman primary school has to stop,\" he said.",
