    "title": "Renuncia del papa Francisco, ¿Qué pasa si se hace efectiva?",
    "text": "CIUDAD DEL VATICANO.— El 17 de diciembre de 2022, el periódico español ABC publicó una entrevista realizada al papa Francisco en la que, entre otras cosas, mencionó que había firmado su renuncia.\nEn el artículo de los periodistas Julián Quirós y Javier Martínez-Brocal se menciona también la atención del pontífice a los que están lejos, de las críticas por el acento en los desfavorecidos, la inconformidad de los sectores más tradicionales, entre otros temas.\nEn aquella entrevista, al sucesor de Pedro le plantearon la pregunta: “Qué ocurre si un pontífice queda repentinamente impedido por problemas de salud o accidente? ¿No sería conveniente una norma para estos casos?\nEl papa Francisco respondió, “Yo ya he firmado mi renuncia. Era Tarcisio Bertone el secretario de Estado. Yo la firmé y le dije: ‘En caso de impedimento por cuestiones médicas o qué sé yo, acá está mi renuncia. Ya la tienen’. No sé a quién se la habrá dado el cardenal Bertone, pero se la di cuando era secretario de Estado”.\nEl papa Francisco ingresa al hospital\nEl pasado viernes 14 de febrero, el papa Francisco ingresó al hospital policlínico Agostino Gemelli de Roma, donde se le ha diagnosticado neumonía bilateral y bronquitis asmática.\nEn esta condición, el tema de la renuncia papal ha llamado la atención de diversos sectores como el de los medios de comunicación.\nEste jueves, durante una rueda de prensa, los periodistas preguntaron si el santo padre podría decidir renunciar si no se recupera por completo.\nEste día, el cardenal Gianfranco Ravasi, comentó sobre la posibilidad de renuncia del pontífice cuando se le preguntó si el papa Francisco podría decidir seguir los pasos de Benedicto XVI y renunciar si se enferma demasiado.\nBenedicto XVI fue el primer papa en 600 años en retirarse cuando concluyó en 2013 que no tenía la fuerza física para continuar con las exigencias del papado viajero.\n“No hay duda de que si él (papa Francisco) estuviera en una situación donde su capacidad de tener contacto directo (con las personas) como le gusta estuviera comprometida, entonces creo que podría decidir renunciar”, dijo Ravasi.\nComo dijo en la entrevista de 2022, el papa Francisco ha confirmado que poco después de ser elegido pontífice escribió una carta de renuncia en caso de que problemas médicos le impidieran llevar a cabo sus deberes.\nRenuncia al papado\nSe denomina renuncia al papado al abandono de su cargo por parte del Papa, la máxima autoridad de la Iglesia católica. Es un evento que ha sucedido muy pocas veces en la historia de la Iglesia católica, siendo el caso más reciente el del papa Benedicto XVI. Se concibe como una posibilidad a partir del canon 332, párrafo 2 del Código de Derecho Canónico.\nCanon 332 del Código de Derecho Canónico\nPárrafo 1\nEl Romano Pontífice obtiene la potestad plena y suprema en la Iglesia mediante la elección legítima por él aceptada juntamente con la consagración episcopal. Por lo tanto, el elegido para el pontificado supremo que ya ostenta el carácter episcopal, obtiene esa potestad desde el momento mismo de su aceptación. Pero si el elegido carece del carácter episcopal, ha de ser ordenado Obispo inmediatamente.\nPárrafo 2\nSi el Romano Pontífice renunciase a su oficio, se requiere para la validez que la renuncia sea libre y se manifieste formalmente, pero no que sea aceptada por nadie.\nProcedimiento\nEl derecho canónico no prevé ningún individuo en particular, entidad, o personas a las que el Papa debe manifestar su renuncia. Sin embargo, algunos especialistas sostienen que el colegio de cardenales, o al menos su decano, debe ser informado, ya que los cardenales deben estar absolutamente seguros de que el Papa ha renunciado a la dignidad válidamente antes de que se proceda a elegir a un sucesor mediante un cónclave. Tampoco es necesario que nadie acepte formalmente la renuncia.\nTambién le podría interesar: “El papa Francisco ya firmó su renuncia; esta es la razón“",

    "title": "Impossible without well-nourished children",
    "text": "A teacher in Tumakuru wrote a poem in anguish after seeing the plight of young children languishing before her very door as a result of the SMART City project not providing creches for them. Titled I don’t need this Smart City, her poem says, “The city built on the lives of such innocents will never give me peace.”\nEqually distressing instances arise from the lack of creches at construction sites, of little children being run over by reversing cement lorries, and of toddlers falling into open sumps and drowning while their mothers are busy carrying bricks up to the top floors. Also, one shudders with horror at the incidents of a stray dog mauling a toddler to death at a construction site and of a road roller running over and flattening toddlers who were left unattended by the roadside by a mother working on a road project for BBMP!\nThese horrifying and avoidable tragedies stem from the callous and patriarchal disregard of many employers and even government agencies to provide creche services to young children of poor mothers forced to earn their livelihood. A contractor’s response when questioned on why he had not admitted his workers’ children in a creche was: “If such demands are made on us, we will not employ women at all!” The overall mindset appears to be that it is solely a woman’s responsibility to care for her babies and no business of men or the government. Is it any wonder that these children, if they survive, suffer from irreversible malnourishment during their crucial first 1000 days, contributing to India’s alarming levels of malnutrition, among the highest in the world?\nNotably, none other than the former head of the Reserve Bank of India, Raghuram Rajan, highlighted this while interacting with media in connection with his latest book, Reimagining India’s Economic Future: “You must be joking about becoming a developed, rich country by 2047 with 35 per cent malnutrition today. Your malnourished children today are going to be workers in 2047. Will they be capable of doing work in the presence of robots and AI? Have you thought about what that entails? Our children’s high malnutrition levels should be the country’s shame that we want to eradicate.”\nWhile laws mandate employers to provide a creche only when a certain number of women workers are employed, the Law Commission, in its Report No. 259 on Early Childhood Care and Education, recommends that a new Article 24A be inserted into Part III of the Constitution to ensure that the unconditional right of every child under six to crèche and daycare becomes an enforceable right, making it this State’s responsibility, not employers, especially in the unorganised sector.\nHowever, rather than focusing on the setting up of creches by the state, PM Modi, in an episode of ‘Mann Ki Baat’, spoke of how citizens should participate in rooting out malnutrition, how the ‘Mera Bachha Campaign’ in Madhya Pradesh was using bhajan-kirtans to curb malnutrition, and about a snake and ladder game prepared in a district of Jharkhand, in which children learn about good and bad eating habits.\nIn pursuance of the above measures as solutions to malnutrition, no funds were released by the Union government in FY 2021–22 for the functioning of creches under the National Creche Scheme (earlier named Rajiv Gandhi National Creche Scheme) as per a report in Business Line (May 25, 2022). The report adds that the budget allocation for the scheme has come down by 59% in the last three years. Moreover, out of 18,040 creches that were functional in FY18 under this scheme, 11,582 were shut down by FY20, shrinking the number to 6,458.\nIn Karnataka, it is disappointing that the Building & Other Construction Workers’ Welfare (BOCWW) Board, mandated through a Government Order to run creches for construction workers’ children in every ward or a group of wards, with its own accumulated funds of Rs 6,000 crore, has shut down the 137 creches that it had established in several districts, claiming irregularities in their functioning.\nAmid this dismal scenario, it is encouraging that Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah has announced in the 2023–24 budget the setting up of ‘Koosina Mane’ (Child’s Home) in 4,000 grampanchayats for mothers working under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) as well as for other mothers living in the vicinity. This measure was\nlong overdue, as it had been a requirement under the MGNREGA Act since 2005 itself.\nWhile this initiative needs to be lauded, the question arises whether setting up one creche per GP would serve the needs of all working women. And would setting up such parallel structures be feasible when the existing Anganwadis themselves are lacking funds and infrastructure? And why not creches in urban areas, where a tremendous amount of construction activity is happening and women are employed? When there are 69,000+ Anganwadis in the state already, at an accessible distance for most women in rural and urban areas, would it make better sense to upgrade these as daycare centres in a phased manner? But it may be too huge a task to serve all zero- to 6-year-olds in the existing Anganwadis, given their deficiencies.\nThe recommendation of the Law Commission provides a solution for this. It has been suggested that Article 21A of the Constitution should be amended to extend the Fundamental Right to Education to children in the 3–6 age group as well. To achieve this, it has been recommended that “pre-school centres should be established in all government and aided schools in a phased manner,” which shall have linkages with the Anganwadis for providing ICDS services to all the children. So, while the under-3-year-olds are served by the existing but upgraded Anganwadis, the 3-6-year-olds could be accommodated in the government schools.\nSuch an approach to providing comprehensive care, nutrition, and development for all children under 6 years old may help the country rid itself of the shame of malnutrition and bring peace to the likes of the anguished teacher in Tumakuru who care about children.\n(The writer is the executive trustee of CIVIC-Bangalore)\n 28 December 2023, 20:26 IST)",

    "text": "Residents of Karachi experienced some relief from the sweltering heat on Thursday as brief showers, accompanied by strong winds and a hailstorm, swept through various parts of the city, creating a more pleasant atmosphere. Earlier in the day, the city was grappling with intense heat when dark clouds began to gather, leading to rainfall and hail in several areas. Regions affected by the windy and rainy weather included Malir, North Karachi, Bufferzone, Gulshan-e-Hadid, Gulistan-e-Jauhar, and Shah Faisal. Steel Town, Gulshan-e-Maymar, and Port Qasim also experienced rain and gusty winds, with speeds reaching 40 to 50 kilometers per hour near the airport. Hail was reported in areas such as Johar Block 1 and Safoora. Following the rains, electricity supply was disrupted in several neighborhoods, including Abul Hassan Isfahani Road, Scheme 33, North Karachi, Malir, Model Colony, Gulshan-e-Hadid, and Ahsanabad, as over 150 feeders were affected. The highest rainfall was recorded at University Road, measuring 30.5 mm, while Jinnah Terminal reported 1 mm and Old Airport recorded 6.2 mm. The K-Electric announced that temporary power shutdowns would occur in some areas as a precaution. Chief Meteorologist Sardar Sarfaraz noted that cloud formation was due to the heat and could impact other parts of Karachi for approximately half an hour, particularly in the north and northeast. The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) previously stated that Karachi's weather was expected to remain hot over the next four to five days, with temperatures projected to reach between 38°C and 40°C.

L’esame è stato disposto dal pm Raffaelle Belvederi della Procura di Ravenna che ha indagato a piede libero per omicidio volontario il marito della donna, il 54enne Miguel Soto di origine cubana. La morte di Paola Bolognesi e le indagini Il fascicolo non è ancora stato archiviato e occorreranno sessanta giorni perché il medico legale depositi i risultati dell’esame. «Siamo certi che l’indagine a carico del mio assistito – aveva commentato a caldo Franco Randi legale di Miguel Soto – sia un atto dovuto. Ha trovato lui il cadavere, la moglie aveva in mano un macchinario per la misurazione della pressione». Circostanza riscontrata dai carabinieri che indagano sul caso che avevano ispezionato la camera matrimoniale in cui la signora giaceva a letto senza vita. Sul corpo erano presenti lividi ed ecchimosi e tracce di sangue in bocca che avevano spinto gli inquirenti ad aprire un fascicolo e fare chiarezza. Per i testimoni la coppia attraversava una crisi coniugale Al momento del decesso, altra circostanza che aveva suscitato perplessità, Paola Bolognesi era vestita con gli stessi abiti con cui era rientrata a casa. Anche altre circostanze hanno imposto accertamenti. Stando al racconto di alcuni testimoni la coppia non stava attraversando un periodo sereno. Paola Bolognesi e il marito, che si erano conosciuti quindici anni fa, negli ultimi tempi litigavano di continuo e condividevano spazi diversi della casa. Tanto che il Miguel Soto aveva raccontato di aver rinvenuto il cadavere allarmato dal suono della sveglia che non smetteva di suonare nella stanza in cui dormiva la moglie. Il fascicolo rimane aperto anche se prevale l'ipotesi del malore Pare inoltre che la donna volesse convincere il marito ad andarsene di casa, da quell’abitazione del centro di Bagnacavallo in cui viveva anche il padre della sessantunenne, gravemente affetto da Alzheimer. Al momento, come detto, il fascicolo aperto in Procura rimane aperto anche se l’ipotesi del malore, comunque mai scartata alla luce di alcune patologie cardiache conclamate di cui la donna soffriva, ha preso il sopravvento sulle altre. Il funerale di Paola Bolognesi era stato programmato per il 27 dicembre, poi la decisione della Procura aveva imposto ai familiari di annullare la cerimonia che sarà celebrata nei prossimi giorni.

    "text": "Google abandonnerait la Pixel Tablet 3 : la fin des tablettes par le géant de Mountain View ?\n22 novembre 2024à 9h00.\nLa Pixel Tablet 3 pourrait potentiellement disparaître, scellant l’abandon des tablettes par Google.\nTl;dr\n- Google pourrait annuler la production de la Pixel Tablet 3.\n- Le personnel du projet serait redirigé vers d’autres initiatives.\n- La Pixel Tablet 2 pourrait être la dernière de la marque.\nUn avenir incertain pour la Pixel Tablet 3 de Google\nUn récent rapport indique que\nle géant de la technologie, Google, pourrait mettre un terme à la production de sa Pixel Tablet 3, ainsi qu’à toute future tablette.\nUne histoire mouvementée pour la gamme Pixel Tablet\nLa gamme de tablettes Pixel de Google a connu une histoire tumultueuse. On se souvient que Google avait annoncé l’arrêt de la production de tablettes en 2019. Cependant, l’entreprise a créé la surprise en teasant la Pixel Tablet en 2022, qui a ensuite été lancée en 2023. Malheureusement, l’histoire semble se répéter. Selon un nouveau rapport, Google serait sur le point de quitter le marché des tablettes.\nDes sources industrielles confirment l’arrêt du projet\nCette information provient d’une exclusivité récente d’Android Headlines concernant l’avenir de la tablette de Google. Le rapport cite plusieurs sources industrielles proches du projet qui confirment que Google n’a pas l’intention de poursuivre avec la Pixel Tablet 3. « Google a pris cette décision la semaine dernière », précise le rapport, ajoutant que le personnel précédemment affecté à la Pixel Tablet 3 serait redirigé vers d’autres initiatives de l’entreprise.\nUn changement majeur dans la stratégie de Google\nCe changement représenterait un tournant majeur dans la feuille de route matérielle de Google. Il est rapporté qu’Android continuera de travailler sur le logiciel de tablette. Cette décision semble logique, compte tenu de l’engouement actuel pour le marché des appareils pliables. Le\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro Fold, l’un des meilleurs téléphones pliables récemment sortis, est un domaine sur lequel Google pourrait vouloir se concentrer, surtout qu’Apple n’a pas encore rejoint ce marché.\nCette nouvelle signifie également que\nla Google Pixel Tablet 2 pourrait être la dernière de la marque. Bien que les rumeurs concernant la prochaine tablette aient été assez minimes, il semblerait qu’elle ressemble visuellement à la tablette précédente, avec l’ajout possible d’une couverture de clavier. Bien qu’elle ne soit pas aussi impressionnante que les modifications proposées pour la Pixel Tablet 3, qui visait à remplacer un ordinateur portable, nous nous attendons à ce qu’elle soit aussi efficace que la Pixel Tablet originale.\nL’annulation d’un projet matériel par Google est surprenante, mais la circulation de l’information semble indiquer que cette décision est définitive. Cependant, nous devrons attendre le prochain\nGoogle I/O pour voir ce que cela signifie pour l’entreprise. En attendant, découvrez notre liste des meilleures tablettes à acheter lors du prochain Black Friday.",

    "title": "DeSantis, wife Casey go all out against Florida marijuana amendment 3",
    "text": "Gov. Ron DeSantis continued his blitz against Amendment 3 on Thursday as he and First Lady Casey DeSantis held events decrying the ballot measure that would legalize marijuana for recreational use in Florida. “It wasn’t immaculately conceived. It was put on the ballot because one big weed company has now spent $100 million trying to pass it,” DeSantis said during an event in Cape Coral. “This amendment is written to benefit this one big weed company. It’s not meant to benefit you.” DeSantis was referring to Trulieve, which bankrolled the effort to gather petitions to place Amendment 3 on the ballot and also has donated heavily to promote the measure. As of Oct. 11, campaign finance records show Trulieve has spent nearly $92.5 million trying to get Amendment 3 passed. To pass, the measure needs at least 60% support from voters. If approved, it would take effect May 5, 2025. Florida law already allows for the use of medical marijuana for adults for medical purposes. Amendment 3 would legalize it for recreational use for those 21 and older. A person could possess up to three ounces under the amendment. DeSantis and other opponents of the measure have repeatedly slammed Trulieve – though DeSantis never mentions the company by name – for attempting to “corner the market” with the amendment because it doesn’t allow individuals to grow marijuana themselves. DeSantis also contends the Legislature wouldn’t be able to set guidelines for Amendment 3 after it passes, since it would be ensconced in the state constitution. He’s raised the specter of police being unable to prevent people from smoking marijuana in parks, bars and other public places. But lawmakers have consistently passed measures to tweak amendments passed by voters, and Amendment 3 doesn’t bar the Legislature from passing rules or laws “consistent with the amendment.” “That’s misinformation. Because the governor knows that after this amendment passes it has to come to the Legislature for rulemaking,” said Sen. Shevrin Jones, D-Miami Gardens, who supports Amendment 3. “Listen, if they don’t want smoking in public, fine,” he added. “Tell the Legislature to make sure we say no smoking in public places. But don’t lie to Floridians and say this is one thing when you yourself know that that’s not the case.” Opponents have also pointed to the increased health risks to the public if marijuana were legalized for recreational use. Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo, who leads the Department of Health, said the amendment would exacerbate a variety of health issues, including addiction and schizophrenia. He also claimed the media wasn’t reporting on the negative health aspects of marijuana; the better to control the populace. (The state health department also oversees the state’s medical marijuana program.) “Multiple studies show that marijuana increases the incidences of schizophrenia in young people. Multiple studies different countries they show it,” Ladapo said at the Cape Coral event. “People don’t know this but it’s true. And people don’t know it because unfortunately we have a media that wants you drugged out. And they want you drugged out because hey, guess what? You’re easier to control. You’re way more controllable when you’re drugged out.” DeSantis also received help from wife Casey, who held her own event in Jacksonville, where she was joined by several sheriffs. The rhetoric against Amendment 3 has grown sharper as Election Day nears, with less than two weeks left. “Why do they package it like Gummy Bears and lollipops and Rice Krispie Treats and brownies?” Casey DeSantis said. “It will happen where this gets to our kids, they can consume it and it can be potentially life ending.” Gray Rohrer is a reporter with the USA TODAY Network-Florida Capital Bureau.
