    "text": "Partager: Deux personnes ont été blessées dans une attaque à l'arme blanche près d'une colonie israélienne à la périphérie de Jérusalem, selon des informations israéliennes. Les forces de sécurité israéliennes ont tiré vers le suspect qui a été \"neutralisé\", selon la communication de la police jeudi soir. Il n'était pas encore établi si l'assaillant a été tué. Une des personnes poignardée a été grièvement blessée, selon la police citant des services de secours. La seconde victime présente des blessures plus légères. Les services d'ambulance font référence aux victimes comme un homme de 25 ans et une femme de 20 ans, qui étaient tous deux membres des forces de sécurité, selon les médias israéliens. Il n'y avait pas encore d'information sur l'identité de l'assaillant. L'incident est survenu près d'un poste de contrôle à proximité de la colonie Har Homa au sud-est de Jérusalem. Elle est située en dehors de la ligne verte qui sépare le territoire israélien et les territoires conquis par Israël lors de la guerre des Six Jours. En 1967, Israël a conquis la Cisjordanie et Jérusalem Est. En tenant compte de Jérusalem Est, il y a environ 700.000 colons israéliens qui vivent parmi trois millions de Palestiniens. Les Palestiniens demandent que ces territoires fassent partie de leur Etat et que Jérusalem Est soit la capitale.",

    "text": "The [Indian right-wing Hindu nationalist paramilitary organization] Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) magazine Organiser carried an\narticle (dated 5 June 2023) by a former vice chancellor of Gautam Buddha University arguing in favour of the ‘logic of deleting Darwinism’ and ‘Intelligent Design’.\nIt was shocking because the third all-India head (sarsanghchalak) of the RSS, Madhukar Dattatraya Deoras, in one of his famous talks spoke about how the West, despite its religion-motivated psychological inhibitions, had embraced Darwinian science, citing the famous Scopes Monkey Trial.\nThe essay published by the authoritative RSS mouthpiece is a worrying indication of the creeping in of a fundamentalist creationist tendency that is more an imitation of Western creationism, and a vision alien to any Indian darshana, but, more importantly, a falsehood.\n…\nThe Indian knowledge system does not reject evolution, but if it does, then it is not a knowledge system but rather a system of sophisticated ignorance.\nHindu seers like Swami Vivekananda and Sri Aurobindo have argued for the acceptance of evolution.",

She shared her excitement: \"Having Ongwa here isn't just personal – it shows what the WUSC Student Refugee Program can really do. We couldn't have done this without support from Guard.me and the WUSC community. Now that Ongwa's here, our shared dream of getting an education feels even more real.\"\n\"The Wakilongo sisters' story really brings our motto, 'Great Things Happen Here,' to life,\" said Dr. Christopher Duncanson-Hales , Coordinator of International Partnerships at Canadore College. \"Their reunion shows how our work with WUSC creates positive changes that go way beyond our campuses.\"\n\"Ongwa's and Sabrina's story gives us hope,\" said WUSC committee co-chair Chinmay Patel . \"It shows how education and community support can help people overcome huge challenges. Seeing them together at Canadore reminds us that we can make a real difference in the world when we work together.\" The local WUSC committee's work is backed by financial support from Guard.me International Health Insurance.\n\"Our international students add incredible diversity to our campuses, enriching the learning experience for all,\" said George Burton , President and CEO. \"It's especially heartwarming to see two sisters choosing to study together at Canadore.\"\nAs Ongwa settles into her new academic home, the Canadore College community is ready to welcome her, continuing its tradition of creating a safe and friendly environment for students from all backgrounds.\nAbout Canadore College : Canadore College trains people through applied learning, leadership, and innovation.

    "text": "The Riff Raff Baby toy \"Riff the Fox Teether\" was recalled just before the Christmas holiday, raising concern that some may have been given as gifts unknowingly. The plastic toy for infants has two small parts that can detatch, creating a serious choking hazard. The New Zeland government's regulatory agency announced the recall last week, and is still trying to get the word out.\nThe Riff the Fox Teether is a plastic fox with a stick figure-like body and a large head. According to New Zealand's Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment , the fox's ears can become detached, posing a risk for choking. The agency asks that consumers stop using the toy immediately and not give it to any children. They can send an email to productsafetyinfo@riffraffbaby.com to get a refund.\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by 🤍Sage & Cleo 🤍 (@twolittleloves._)\nRiff Raff Baby has numerous products for infants and new parents, including toys, books and specialty items like hooded towels. In particular, the company sells \"sleep toys\" which are part stuffed animal, part blanket made for infants to hold in the cradle. The company has several characters to choose from including the fox, raccoon, koala, bear, bunny and fawn.\n\"Riff Raff's mission is to deliver magic moments and lasting memories to families all over the world through exceptional customer experience and industry-leading product solutions,\" reads the company's description . It also proclaims a \"parents supporting parents\" approach, with an emphasis on creativity and flexibility. Many product reviews on the site indicate that Riff Raff products were given as gifts this holiday season, so hopefully news of the recall spreads to all those customers.\nWhile this recall was initiated in New Zealand, Riff Raff toys are also sold in the U.S. Here, product recalls are generally handled by the U.S. Product Safety Commission ( CPSC ). The CPSC website includes options to subscribe for alerts and updates about recalls via email or other means. There, you can also search for specific products or look at categories of products to recent recalls that may affect you.\n0 comments Related:\nUrgent Recall Issued for Children's Playset Amid Christmas Season Check Your Stockings: Candy Bar Recall Issued Honda Recalls More Than 2.5 Million Cars",
