    "title": "‘We’ve been taken into pole dancing and endless spinning,’ Martha Karua says on bilateral talks report",
    "text": "NARC Kenya Party Leader Martha Karua has faulted the National Dialogue Committee report saying the talks were fruitless and a waste of time for Kenyans.\nSpeaking on Citizen TV’s Tonight Show on Thursday, Karua slammed the Kenya Kwanza government claiming they were from the beginning focused on frustrating the talks and had no intention of addressing the issues raised by the Opposition.\nKarua cited the eight months since the engagement started asserting that the President William Ruto-led regime was only aimed at taking Raila Odinga’s side for a ride and not willing to agree to their demands.\nAccording to Karua, the key issues raised by the Opposition including the cost of living, electoral justice and respect for multiparty democracy had not been achieved and thus the talks cannot be termed a success.\n“The outcome of the engagement with the rogue KK regime, is they have not bored fruits. I think we have been taken into pole dancing which is endless spinning and nothing comes out of it,” Karua said.\n“The duration of the talks is eight months; April to November. What have we gotten out of it, in my view, absolutely nothing because the three issues that we wanted to be addressed were cost of living, electoral justice (forensic audit) and respect of multiparty democracy.”\nKarua went on to blame the Kenya Kwanza outfit for the alleged failure of the talks arguing that despite a continued push for the reduction of the cost of living, the government was instead increasing the prices of basic commodities ignoring the plight of Kenyans.\n“From where I sit, the failure of the talks, and the failure of what people wanted, the blame squarely rests on Kenya Kwanza for they took us for a ride. For any talks to succeed, the party in power is the one that must show utmost goodwill because they are the ones being pushed to show concession of what people want,” she stated.\n“Since then, the cost of living has gone up maybe twice, maybe thrice…while the talks were ongoing, the Finance Bill also came.”\nShe termed the current regime as ‘rogue’ reiterating that President Ruto’s administration was running critical functions of the state in total contempt of the law and disregarding public opinion such as the controversial Finance Act.\n“When you contempt against the constitution, the people who brought you to power and the will of the majority, you become a rogue regime,” she said on why she referred to the government as a rogue.\nTags: Martha Karua Citizen TV Citizen Digital Azimio NADCO Want to send us a story?

    "title": "Biden-Harris Administration Announces Nearly $220 Million for Transformational Habitat Restoration and Coastal Resilience Projects | NOAA Fisheries",
    "text": "Today, the Department of Commerce’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is recommending nearly $220 million in funding, and an additional $66 million in future year funding, to support 32 [transformational habitat restoration and coastal resilience projects](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/grant/transformational-habitat-restoration-and-coastal-resilience-grants) as part of President Biden’s Investing in America agenda. These funds from the [Bipartisan Infrastructure Law](https://www.noaa.gov/infrastructure-law) and [Inflation Reduction Act](https://www.noaa.gov/inflation-reduction-act) will build on decades of habitat work in priority watersheds and support innovative projects that implement cutting-edge restoration techniques and groundbreaking efforts that restore habitat in urban ecosystems to benefit underserved communities. “The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to an ambitious climate agenda that strengthens our coastal communities, combats the climate and nature crises, and makes our nation and economy more resilient. This historic investment, made possible thanks to President Biden’s commitment to investing in America, will help sustain our nation’s fisheries across our coastal communities by strengthening climate resilience and protecting ecosystems from the impacts of climate change,” said U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo. NOAA prioritized projects that demonstrated a broad base of partner and community support, inclusive practices and meaningful strategies to engage Tribal Nations and community groups, including underserved communities. “These transformational projects will restore healthy coastal ecosystems across the country,” said Janet Coit, assistant administrator for NOAA Fisheries. “We’re proud to support projects that span a broad range of habitats and restoration techniques, from reconnecting rivers to their historic floodplains, to outplanting corals to rebuild reefs to restoring salt marshes that will protect coasts from erosion and sea level rise.” [Funding — including future year funding — is going to partners in the following states and territories](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/feature-story/noaa-recommends-nearly-220-million-funding-transformational-habitat-restoration-and): Alaska ($1.5 million), California ($46 million), Connecticut ($4 million), Florida ($29.1), Georgia ($2.8 million), Hawaii ($14.8 million), Louisiana ($10 million), Maine ($9 million), Maryland ($10 million), Massachachusetts ($15 million), Michigan ($15 million), North Carolina ($23.9 million), Oregon ($16.6 million), Pennsylvania ($9.5 million), Puerto Rico ($5 million), Texas ($8.2 million), U.S. Virgin Islands ($2.5 million), Virginia ($17.5 million), Washington ($28.5 million), Wisconsin ($3.2 million), and a multi-state project across Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas ($12 million). The Yurok Tribe, and the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians are also receiving funds. These projects were selected through the Transformational Habitat Restoration and Coastal Resilience funding opportunity, and build on the [$285 million awarded from BIL/IRA funds for 38 projects](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/feature-story/more-265-million-funding-recommended-transformational-habitat-restoration-and-coastal) during the first round of this funding opportunity in 2023. This funding supports President Biden’s America the Beautiful Initiative, a locally led and voluntary, nation-wide effort to conserve, connect and restore 30 percent of lands, waters and wildlife by 2030. This is a program covered by the Justice40 Initiative, which set the goal that 40 percent of the overall benefits of certain federal investments flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution. NOAA’s Office of Habitat Conservation has a long history conducting habitat restoration by executing large-scale competitive funding opportunities and providing expert technical assistance through the [Community-based Restoration Program](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/habitat-conservation/community-based-habitat-restoration). The program provides technical and financial assistance to partners across the country to develop high-quality habitat restoration projects that support our nation’s fisheries. Since its start in 1996, the program has helped implement more than 2,200 coastal habitat restoration projects — restoring more than 94,000 acres of habitat for fish and opening more than 4,400 stream miles for fish passage. Please visit the NOAA Fisheries website to learn more about [habitat restoration projects](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/habitat-conservation/habitat-restoration-under-bipartisan-infrastructure-law-and-inflation-reduction-act) funded under the [Bipartisan infrastructure Law](https://www.noaa.gov/infrastructure-law) and [Inflation Reduction Act](https://www.noaa.gov/inflation-reduction-act).

Objectif : sensibiliser au dérèglement du climat au contact de paysans et autres acteurs de l’écologie.\nVilleurbanne (Rhône), reportage\nLeyna n’avait jamais fait de voyage à vélo. Pour tout dire, la jeune femme n’était pas non plus une cycliste aguerrie. Quand son ami Emré lui a proposé un Paris-Marseille à bicyclette en dormant sous tente tout en rencontrant des paysans au fil du périple, elle a tout de même dit oui. « Ça semblait drôle et intéressant », sourit l’étudiante en langues appliquées anglais-russe à Strasbourg. Elle a pris la route le 12 juillet, aux côtés d’une dizaine d’autres jeunes de Saint-Ouen-sur-Seine, Marseille et Les Mureaux pour rouler 800 kilomètres à travers la France. Un voyage piloté par\nl’association Banlieues climat, qui sensibilise les jeunes des quartiers populaires au [changement climatique](Qu-est-ce-que-le-rechauffement-climatique) et aux alternatives pour y faire face.\nTrois jours après son départ de Saint-Ouen-sur-Seine, en Seine-Saint-Denis, l’équipée a marqué l’arrêt dans le quartier des Brosses, à Villeurbanne en périphérie lyonnaise. Les visages sont fatigués, mais le moral est joyeux. Les cyclistes ont passé la matinée à discuter circuits courts et alimentation chez un maraîcher bio en Saône-et-Loire, puis pédalé sous la pluie et le vent toute l’après-midi. Ce soir, c’est ciné-débat sur l’agriculture avec les jeunes du quartier, après le visionnage du documentaire Douce France, qui retrace l’enquête d’une poignée de lycéens sur le projet du\nmégacomplexe Europacity.\nAymen, à l’énergie débordante, lance à la cantonade : « Les jeunes des Brosses, est-ce que le climat vous intéresse ? » Un tiède « non » lui répond. « Et une formation de huit heures sur le climat, ça vous intéresse ? » Nouvelle négation molle. Et pourtant.\nÀ la fin du film, les questions fusent vers Anthony, maraîcher lyonnais venu expliquer les ressorts de son métier. « J’ai toujours rêvé d’avoir une ferme, mais je croyais qu’il fallait forcément avoir des parents paysans pour entrer dans le métier », s’étonne Hodane, 21 ans, en licence management durable à la Doua. « De moins en moins d’agriculteurs sont fils de paysans, lui répond Anthony. Ce sont de nouveaux paysans sans lien avec le métier qui tirent l’agriculture vers le haut. On a besoin de personnes avec un regard extérieur pour nous faire réfléchir sur notre système. » La jeune femme repartira avec le numéro de l’agriculteur.\nRelier écologie et quartiers populaires\nFondée\nà l’automne 2022, Banlieues climat fait le constat que, pour faire face à l’urgence climatique, il faut s’informer et surtout se sentir légitime à s’exprimer. Pour y parvenir, l’association initie gratuitement les jeunes des quartiers populaires aux questions d’écologie.\nÉlaborée avec les experts du Giec [\n[1](#nb1)], leur formation a été labellisée par le ministère de la Recherche et de l’Enseignement supérieur. Elle est dispensée à des groupes de 16 à 25 ans, dure sept heures et donne accès à un diplôme symbolique. Chaque session coûte 3 500 euros, réglés par les collectivités. En un an, l’association est intervenue auprès de 250 jeunes, dont certains sont devenus à leur tour des formateurs.\nMajoritairement blanches et pour certaines bourgeoises, les associations écolos « classiques » peinent à toucher les classes populaires, pourtant vivement touchées par les vagues de chaleur, la pollution de l’air et les inégalités alimentaires.\nSi la recette de Banlieues climat fonctionne, c’est parce qu’elle a trouvé la solution à cet écueil en misant sur un dialogue d’égal à égal. « Les jeunes qui participent à nos formations n’ont quasiment jamais entendu parler du climat. Ils viennent “parce qu’ils n’ont rien à perdre” et se retrouvent face des jeunes qui leur ressemblent, enthousiastes sur les questions écologiques, et auxquels ils peuvent s’identifier », présente Axel, formateur de l’association, qui en a lui-même profité.\n« Ce voyage n’est pas un exploit sportif, mais une aventure humaine »\nPour continuer à tracer sa route, Banlieues climat a organisé cet été un voyage à vélo qui réunit salariés, formateurs, élèves, et mêmes des jeunes sans lien avec l’association. Les jeunes roulent entre 40 et 70 km chaque jour, bien qu’une partie du périple s’effectue en minibus pour éviter les zones dangereuses. « Ce voyage n’est pas un exploit sportif, mais une aventure humaine à vélo », souligne Jean-Luc Letouzé, vélotouriste accompli qui a planifié l’itinéraire. Chaque étape explore un lieu emblématique de la transition écologique et sociale.\nAu programme : un atelier pour comprendre\nl’intérêt des haies pour la biodiversité, une étape à l’écolieu La Casba pour échanger sur l’autogestion, un petit-déjeuner « pâte à tartiner » pour aborder les thématiques de la déforestation et les conséquences environnementales et sanitaires de l’industrie agroalimentaire.\nDès la première journée, les cyclistes ont fait une pause à l’école d’horticulture du Breuil, dans le bois de Vincennes, où ils ont confectionné des bombes à graines. Depuis, ils disséminent ce mélange de terre fertile, de compost et de semences le long de leur parcours.\nCe périple vise surtout à tisser des liens entre Banlieues climat et les associations, habitants et militants croisés en chemin. À l’instar des bombes à graines, « l’objectif est de s’implanter partout pour essayer de toucher un maximum de personnes, explique Axel. Le maillage est très important, c’est en étant le plus nombreux possible qu’on pourra avoir du poids auprès des institutions pour faire changer les choses demain ».\nDe passage dans le quartier de la Madeleine à Joigny, dans l’Yonne, la troupe a fait une battle de rap écologique avec des jeunes rencontrés par hasard. « C’était complètement improvisé, on les a vu nous regarder de loin, on les a invités à nous rejoindre », décrit Leyna. « C’était absolument génial ! s’émerveille Axel. Des jeunes m’ont fait jurer de revenir pour leur parler du climat. C’est là qu’on voit que personne n’est insensible aux problématiques écologiques. Ces jeunes ne sont pas écoutés mais une fois qu’on arrive à les faire rentrer dans cette dynamique, ils sont tous capables de s’impliquer et de faire changer les choses. »\nDirectrice de la Maison de quartier des Brosses, Farida Kendris abonde : « Nos jeunes font des chantiers pour financer leurs projets personnels. Vous devriez les voir réhabilitant un jardin d’immeubles à l’abandon en potager collectif. Ils se prennent au jeu et acquièrent énormément de connaissances ! »\nDe passage à Villeurbanne pour visiter la Maison de quartier, la cofondatrice de Banlieues climat Sanaa Saitouli s’apprête d’ailleurs à signer un plan d’action avec la Métropole de Lyon pour y développer des formations. Elle dispose du soutien de Marie-Charlotte Garin, députée écologiste de la 3e circonscription du Rhône, qui a accueilli Banlieues climat à l’Assemblée. « On ne peut pas faire mieux qu’eux pour expliquer l’urgence climatique dans les quartiers populaires. Je m’engage à vous soutenir et espère vous accueillir à Lyon après Villeurbanne », a annoncé l’élue avant le ciné-débat.\nPas le temps de reposer les mollets fatigués. La troupe est repartie dès le lendemain matin, direction Marseille, où une nouvelle formation est en cours d’élaboration par Féris Barkat, l’un des cofondateurs de l’association, et ses collègues dans les quartiers nord de la ville.",
