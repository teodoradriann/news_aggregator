    "title": "Friends and family mourn the loss of Canadians killed by Hamas in Israel",
    "text": "Friends, family and government officials have confirmed that at least seven Canadians were killed when Hamas militants conducted a series of attacks in Israel on Oct. 7.\nGlobal Affairs Canada has said an eighthperson who was not a citizen but had deep ties to Canada also died in the ensuing conflict. Another Canadian, who has not been identified, died in Lebanon during the hostilities.\nThe Hamas attacks killed an estimated 1,200 people and militants took another 240 hostage, 105 of whom were released during a temporary pause in the violence at the end of last month.\nAs Israel continues its retaliation on Hamas in the Gaza Strip, authorities there say more than 20,000 Palestinians have now been killed.\nHere's what we know about the Hamas victimswith ties to Canada:\nJudih Weinstein Haggai\nJudih Weinstein Haggai, 70, was out on an early-morning walk when Hamas started its attack, her family says.\nShe told members of her Nir Oz kibbutz that a militant on a motorcycle shot her husband and she was less severely wounded. The community was unable to dispatch an ambulance before militants arrived there.\nLast week, the kibbutz confirmed Gadi Haggai, Judih's husband, died on Oct. 7, and on Thursday they confirmed Weinstein Haggai also died that day, and her body is being held in Gaza.\nWeinstein Haggai was born in New York state but arrived in Toronto at the age of three, and moved to Israel 20 years later to live with her husband. She held Canadian, Israeli and American citizenships.\nWeinstein Haggai was an artist and a volunteer who the kibbutz said \"pursued many initiatives to advance peace in the region.\"\nHer brother Larry Weinstein said the family is distressed by Israel's offensive in Gaza and the rise of hateful speech in Canada toward both Jews and Muslims.\n\"We're inspired by my sister, who believed in peace and believed in harmony,\" he said. \"There can't be any kind of resolution when people are at each other's throats.\"\nVivian Silver\nVivian Silver, 74, was in her home on Kibbutz Be'eri near the Gaza border and talking on the phone with her son Yonatan Zeigen when they learned of the incursion by Hamas into Israel.\n\"We couldn’t grasp the incapability of the Israeli army to defend the civilians … we started to say goodbye because we realized this is probably our last words to each other,\" Zeigen later told a news conference organized by the Jerusalem Press Club.\nHe said they shifted their conversations to text messages so his mother could stay silent, and someone broke into her home. They said they loved one another before the messages stopped coming.\nZeigen said he had received information that she was taken hostage, and her phone had been geolocated in Gaza.\nOn Monday, his brother Chen Zeigen confirmed their mother's death. He said Israeli authorities told him the remains found earlier in the kibbutz had been identified as Silver.\nHe said his mother was born in Winnipeg and moved to Israel in 1974.\nShe dedicated her life to peacebuilding and fostering understanding between Israelis and Palestinians, he added.\nShe also volunteered to help children in Gaza access medical care in Israel.\nTiferet Lapidot\nTiferet Lapidot, 22, was a few days shy of her 23rd birthday and attending a music festival when the Hamas attack began.\nHer cousin Oran Zlotnik remembered Lapidot as a charismatic and compassionate person who had travelled the world, taught in Africa and spent time in Australia before she returned to Israel in the fall.\nHer uncle Harel Lapidot said she called her mother the morning of the attack to say she was hiding in a bush and to ask whether she should flee. Her cellphone was later tracked to the Gaza Strip, leading family to believe she was being held hostage. They then mounted a campaign to secure her freedom.\nZlotnik said that when the cellphone of one of Lapidot's friends, confirmed deceased, was also traced to Gaza, the family realized it was possible she wasn't a hostage.\nHarel Lapidot said his niece's body was later identified and the family held a funeral.\n\"We know for a fact they were hunted,\" he said. \"They ran away and they were hunted and killed.\"\nTiferet Lapidot was an Israeli citizen but her family was from Canada, including her father, Ohad, who was born in Saskatchewan.\nHarel Lapidot thanked the Jewish community in Canada and MPs who had reached out to help and offer support. The family had a meeting with Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly while she was in Israel.\nNetta Epstein\nIsraeli-Canadian Netta Epstein, 21, died when his home, Kibbutz Kfar Aza, came under attack.\nHis mother, Ayelet Shachar-Epstein, said he loved life. She learned the circumstances of his death from text messages he sent her in the moments before he was killed, and from his fiancée, Irene Shavit, who survived.\nNetta Epstein was inside a safe room with Shavit, and he jumped on a grenade thrown in by the attackers.\nShachar-Epstein, who also lost her mother-in-law and two brothers-in-law in the attacks, described it as a terrorist invasion.\nShe said her son, who had worked with special needs youth, had returned home two months earlier after completing military service.\nHe was born in Montreal and was a Canadian citizen. Shachar-Epstein said many members of the family still live in that city.\nShir Georgy\nIsraeli Canadian Shir Georgy, 22, was killed by Hamas militants who ambushed the music festival near Kibbutz Re'im.\nGeorgy's aunt Michal Bouganim confirmed the death.\n\"We are currently a mess, heartbroken,\" Bouganim said in a Facebook message.\nBouganim shared a 22-second clip on her social media in which a terrified Georgy was seen sitting on a floor, with her back against a wall and surrounded by other festival attendees — some of them injured.\nGeorgy's funeral was held in Israel.\nAdi Vital-Kaploun\nAdi Vital-Kaploun, 33, was killed by Hamas militants in her kibbutz near the Israeli border with the Gaza Strip, said the Jewish Federation of Ottawa.\nThe group's CEO made a statement on behalf of Vital-Kaploun's family, saying the dual citizen has a large extended family in the Ottawa area.\nThe family said she died a hero, after convincing her killers to spare her two young children and warning her father and husband to stay hidden during the attack.\n\"Adi was a beautiful woman that brought love and lightness to the people around her, but also she was very focused and determined to make a beautiful life for her family,\" her cousin-in-law Aaron Smith said in an interview.\nThe family said she was an amazing mother and wife, always bringing love and laughter to their household.\nShe was also a talented dancer, saxophonist and basketball player.\nAfter completing her master's degree in engineering, Vital-Kaploun excelled in her cybersecurity career, they said.\n\"We are mourning trying to process this unconscionable act of terrorism in her kibbutz and across the country,\" said the family, adding that they wish her memory to be \"a blessing.\"\nBen Mizrachi\nCanadian Ben Mizrachi was one of at least 260 people gunned down by Hamas militants at the music festival in southern Israel.\nMizrachi, 22, from Vancouver, was described as \"larger than life with a big personality\" in a statement by his former high school in B.C.\nEzra Shanken, CEO of the Jewish Federation of Greater Vancouver, said Mizrachi was about to start university in Israel after serving with the country's national defence force.\nHilit Nurick, a home economics teacher at King David High School in Vancouver, remembered Mizrachi as a \"kind, wonderful, and community-minded\" young man who had a positive influence on everyone around him.\nNurick said she and Mizrachi once put a large event together for more than 100 people at school.\n\"He was in charge of making Moroccan-style spicy fish stew. He brought his mother's recipe and shared it with everyone and taught us how to make it,\" said Nurick. \"He was incredible, just an incredible human being.\"\nAlexandre Look\nAlexandre Look, who had recently celebrated his 33rd birthday, was among those killed while attending the musical festival.\nLook, who lived in Montreal with his family before moving to Mexico, died a hero, his dad said in a Facebook post.\n\"Like a true warrior he left as a hero wanting to protect the people he was with,\" Alain Haim Look said.\nFriend Lior Horovitz described him as a \"once-in-a-lifetime person\" who became like family during their five-year friendship.\nIn a phone interview from a town outside Tel Aviv, she said she and her boyfriend met Alexandre Look in Mexico. They became fast friends and would organize their vacations to meet up, either in Mexico or Israel.\nHe was a proud Jewish Canadian and a generous person who would do anything for his friends, she said.\n\"He's a person who loves people,\" she said. \"He's the guy that's always going to help others, especially if they are Jewish.\"\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 28, 2023.\nThe Canadian Press",

    "text": "Next 12 Hours The threat of severe weather continues. Auburn and Opelika are now under a severe thunderstorm watch until 11 p.m. Thursday, along with much of the rest of central Alabama. Scattered showers and thunderstorms are expected again this evening. Heavy rain and lightning will occur in spots. A few storms are expected to produce damaging hail, possibly up to golf ball size, and damaging wind gusts up to 70 mph. Though unlikely, an EF0 or EF1 tornado can't be ruled out. Try to avoid unnecessary travel until 11 p.m. Make sure weather radios are turned on and cell phones are fully charged so you can be alerted if a severe thunderstorm warning is issued for your location. If one is issued, a severe thunderstorm is actively occurring and will soon move over you. Seek shelter indoors immediately. Another round of showers and thunderstorms is also expected very late tonight into early Friday morning. Isolated damaging wind, hail, and flooding will again be possible and another severe thunderstorm watch may be needed.

Save articles for later Add articles to your saved list and come back to them any time.\nGot it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Advertisement There’s no denying that Christmas is the most wonderful time of year, but once the lights are taken down, the tinsel is packed away and the presents are unwrapped and forgotten, the magic begins to wane. With the right presents, though, you can extend that magic well past December.\nThoughtful gifting is “nicer” than an expensive present.\nFrom experiences that provide lifelong memories to charitable donations that uplift and empower others, these carefully curated gift ideas will cultivate a sense of joy that spreads far beyond your own four walls.\nHit subscribe Whether it’s a streaming service, curated kit or delivery box, a subscription is the gift that keeps on giving.\nEase your loved one’s mental load with a meal or snack-box delivery, encourage them to make time for their hobbies with a craft or gardening kit, treat their ears to a music or audiobook subscription or spoil them with a monthly wine or beer membership.\nAs well as offering ongoing enjoyment, subscription services also provide a deeper sense of personalisation — something we can all appreciate.\nAdventure awaits Surprise your loved one with an experiential gift this Christmas and not only will you help keep their home clutter-free, you’ll help create cherished memories, too.\nFrom hot-air balloon rides, horse-riding expeditions and wilderness escapes to concerts, fine dining and spa visits, there are plenty of experiences to choose from.\nAdvertisement It doesn’t need to be extravagant to make an impact, either. Keep it simple with a cooking class, paint and sip or movie night — anything that encourages them to break from routine and soak up the happy vibes.\nThe magic of giving\nA charitable gift is priceless. Credit: iStock\nNothing encapsulates the spirit of Christmas more than giving to those in need. As well as bringing joy to your own life, and your recipient’s, you’re also giving the gift of a better future.\nThis year, the Petstock Foundation is making it easier than ever to do your part for people and pets in need with The Christmas Project .\n“We know Christmas can be a difficult time for the most vulnerable people in our community, with many people experiencing even more financial strain, loneliness and increased anxiety during this time,” says Petstock Foundation head Jessica Curtis.\n“At the Petstock Foundation, we understand the magic that pets and animals can bring to our lives, and our aim is to strengthen the rewarding bond between pets and people.”\nTo give the gift of a better future this Christmas, you can purchase a Petstock Foundation Christmas gift or Petstock Foundation product either in store or online until December 31.\n“One hundred per cent of the proceeds from The Christmas Project will be donated to eight organisations nationwide,” Curtis explains. These charities include Guide Dogs Australia and Assistance Dogs Australia, as well as Lucy’s Project in NSW.\n“Donations will enable charities to provide the gifts of sight, confidence, independence and empowerment for people who need them most,” Curtis adds. “Big or small, every gift is a chance to make a difference.”\nJewellery is forever Want to make a lasting impression? Explore the world of permanent jewellery. Unlike a diamond necklace or watch that’s only worn on special occasions, permanent jewellery is meant for everyday wear. Welded together while you’re wearing it, permanent jewellery (which often comes in the form of a simple chained bracelet, anklet or necklace) is the ultimate symbol of connection.\nIf your recipient prefers their jewellery with a clasp, opt for personalised pieces such as astrological pendants, birthstone jewels or timeless initials to keep it meaningful.\nThe gift of wellness Help your pal or partner nail their fitness goals with a gym membership or kick-start their journey with a one-month pass to a Pilates or yoga studio.\nIf they’re already locked in, get them excited to work out with some new accessories. Think weights and resistance bands, boxing gear, yoga blocks or a foam roller. Nothing says you care like investing in their health.\nThanks for the memories Collate your favourite moments into a photobook for your parents, siblings, friends or partner. A physical book will allow them to revisit your special memories time and time again, while a digital album will leave room for the highlights still to come.\nAs we navigate the hustle and bustle of the holiday season, let’s remember that the most enduring gifts aren’t always wrapped in paper. These gifts, whether grand or small, offer a lasting legacy of joy, connection and wellness that will continue to enrich lives long after the holiday season has passed.\nTo give the gift of a better future and purchase a Petstock Foundation gift or to learn more about The Christmas Project, click here .",

    "text": "Secciones\nServicios\nDestacamos\nSalvador 'Salvi' JIménez (14-0-1, 6KO) presentó este jueves junto a Ryan Garner (16-0, 8KO) la 'Colisión en la Costa', en el estadio de fútbol del AFC Bournemouth de la Premier League. El combate, que se celebrá el próximo sábado 1 de marzo servirá pa dilucidar quién se enfundará el cinturón europeo del peso superpluma. Este está vacante tras la renuncia del francés El Hadri, con el que tenía que haber luchado ya el púgil vallisoletano, pero que está inmerso en conseguir el título africano.\nSalvi, invicto, viajó a Inglaterra para presentar el combate con el boxeador local de 27 años, y considerado uno de los peleadores con más proyección del Reino Unido, que además competirá en casa y ante su público en el Centro Internacional de Bournemouth.\nGarner, oriundo de Southampton, peleará cerca de casa por primera vez desde 2017, pero sus hazañas le han permitido construir una enorme base de apoyo con el respaldo de su club de fútbol local de la Premier League, cuyo estadio St Mary's está a dos minutos a pie de su gimnasio. «Estoy encantado de ofrecer una pelea para Ryan en un lugar mucho más conveniente para su creciente ejército de fanáticos», aseguró el promotor del combate, Frank Warren, en la rueda de prensa.\n«Si hubiera un estadio en Southampton, habríamos estado allí hace mucho tiempo, por lo que nuestro objetivo es que Ryan continúe construyendo su carrera en Bournemouth. «La gente sabrá que siempre he sido un gran defensor de Ryan desde que se convirtió en profesional con nosotros a la edad de 18 años. Ha llevado un poco de tiempo llegar a este punto y ahora creo que está a punto de darse cuenta de su enorme potencial», valoró en relación a la que los ingleses consideran «prueba de fuego» ante Salvi. «Será una prueba muy dura contra Salvador Jiménez, un peleador invicto que se ha ganado su desafío al título», añadió el propio Garner ante las preguntas de la prensa local.\nRyan Garner (16-0, 8) se convirtió en campeón internacional de la WBC en agosto de 2023 cuando derrotó a Juan Jesús Antúnez en tres asaltos. Defendió con éxito contra el ex campeón británico Liam Dillon en mayo, ganando por decisión unánime, antes de enfrentarse a su prueba más dura hasta la fecha contra Archie Sharp en julio, repitiendo victoria.\nPublicidad\nPublicidad\nTe puede interesar\nPublicidad\nPublicidad\nEsta funcionalidad es exclusiva para suscriptores.\nReporta un error en esta noticia",

That may include generators, food, gasoline, hotel rooms, ice, lumber and water. \"Violators of the price gouging statute are subject to civil penalties of $1,000 per violation and up to a total of $25,000 for multiple violations committed in a single 24-hour period,\" the release said. “Invest 97L is expected to bring heavy rain and powerful winds to much of the state,\" Moody said in a statement. \"To help Floridians prepare for this event, we are activating the price gouging hotline to accept reports of extreme price increases on essential commodities. As the system approaches, I’m urging Floridians to finalize their storm preparations, monitor weather reports and follow the guidance of local authorities.” For more information ∎ Anyone who suspects price gouging can report it to the Florida Attorney General’s Office by visiting [MyFloridaLegal.com](http://www.myfloridalegal.com) or calling 1(866) 9NO-SCAM. ∎ For more information on price gouging, read a PDF copy of \"Attorney General Moody’s Scams at a Glance: Price Gouging\" handout, online [here](https://www.myfloridalegal.com/sites/default/files/Price%2BGouging_Scams%2Bat%2Ba%2BGlance_v1a%5B1%5D.pdf), and in Spanish, [here](https://www.myfloridalegal.com/sites/default/files/Price%2BGouging_Scams%2Bat%2Ba%2BGlance_v1a_sp%5B1%5D.pdf). ∎ Moody recently released a [2024 Hurricane Preparedness Guide](https://www.myfloridalegal.com/sites/default/files/2024hurricanepreparednessguide.pdf).
