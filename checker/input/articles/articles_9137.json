    "title": "Hospitality sector records another slight fall in staff numbers",
    "text": "The drop follows a 1% decline in staff numbers recorded in June as the sector continues to navigate cost pressures which has led to many pulling down shutters for the final time. “Closures have been occurring throughout the summer because footfall is stagnant at best and down in some parts of the country, while costs have risen exponentially,” said Restaurants Association of Ireland chief executive Adrian Cummins. The CSO figures were published after State-body for tourism Fáilte Ireland released a report which found the vast majority of restaurant operators saw fewer customers this summer compared to last year while most respondents also said their profitability has decreases year-on-year. Representative groups, including the RAI, have ramped up lobbying pressure to secure a reduction in the hospitality Vat rate in the upcoming budget, particularly for food-focused businesses. The Government has long argued that the cost of reducing Vat from 13.5% to 9% would be costly for the taxpayer in the long-run. The cost of implementing a 9% rate during the pandemic, down from 13.5%, reached more than €1bn alone. However, economist Jim Power estimated in a report released earlier this year that the average restaurant closure results in a loss of €1.36m to the State and a direct loss of around 22 jobs.",

El hecho ocurrió el jueves en la intersección de las calles Rivadavia y Córdoba. El padre del menor comenzó a desesperarse al caer en la cuenta de que se había olvidado las llaves del vehículo en el interior del rodado y las ventanillas estaban cerradas.\nEn ese momento, desde el Centro de Operaciones Policiales recibieron el alerta sobre el incidente, por lo que agentes policiales se movilizaron en bicicleta hasta el lugar y determinaron que el bebé se encontraba en la butaca infantil en la parte posterior del Renault Clio.\nEl segundo jede del Departamento de Coordinación General, comisario Néstor Catalán, señaló que \"los padres estaban visiblemente angustiados\", por lo que les ofrecieron romper uno de los cristales del rodado para salvar al niño, una idea que fue autorizada por los progenitores y los oficiales realizaron el procedimiento.\n\"El bebé estaba en buen estado gracias a que el tiempo que pasó encerrado fue corto y las condiciones climáticas no eran extremas.\nSin embargo, no dudamos en actuar con celeridad para garantizar su seguridad\", agregó Catalán en declaraciones al diario La Mañana de Neuquén.\nTras ser rescatado, una ambulancia del Sistema Integrado de Emergencias de Neuquén (SIEN) concurrió allí y una médica analizó al bebé y corroboró que se encontraba bien.",

    "title": "Ottawa weather: Skiers embracing the last warm days before cold spell | CTV News",
    "text": "[Skip to main content](#main) Despite the sunny and mild weather, impending cold on the horizon is prompting many skiers to make the most out of the remaining warm days of winter. Environment Canada says colder temperatures will come to the capital as soon as Thursday, with a high of minus 9 C predicted and a 60 per cent chance of snow. It was a busy day at Mount Pakenham Ski Resort, about 60 kilometres west of Ottawa, where skiers like Jennifer Elgar were taking in the sunshine on the slopes. \"We find Pakenham does a great job with the snow conditions and you wouldn't even know that there's been mild temperatures this week,\" said Elgar. \"We're really looking forward to more snow to come because they’ll be opening up more routes.\" Despite the unusually warm weather, part of Mount Pakenham has been open since early December. Even six-year-old Clare Elgar is eager for winter's arrival. \"I get to go down lots of hills,\" said Clare. Mount Pakenham has been working tirelessly to produce artificial snow daily and combating the warm temperatures, which are expected to drop in the coming weeks. \"We’re at 100 per cent manmade snow at this point. Mother Nature hasn't cooperated too much, but the conditions that we have to offer are really good,” said Andrew Burns, Mount Pakenham's director of operations. \"We've been making snow and when they get here, they're going to be pleasantly surprised.\" Environment Canada says the coldest months of the year are fast approaching, hopefully giving the Rideau Canal Skateway a chance to avoid a repeat of last season, when it was unable to open. \"The coldest months are January and February. I'm confident that you'll see some skating on the Rideau,” says David Phillips, Environment Canada's senior climatologist. “It may be a very short season, but I believe that there will be enough cold. I just can't believe that you'd be shut out two years in a row.\" Season pass holders at Pakenham say they are ready for whatever weather is ahead. Veteran skier Brad O’Neil visits the resort more than 70 times a season and says he’ll be out here even when it’s minus 30 C. \"Yeah, absolutely. Just put layers on,\" says O’Neil. Even 75-year-old Allan Meadows remains undeterred by the cold. He says any skiing is good skiing. \"For us old diehards, we're out on the hill in any condition and we don't really care as long as we're turning our skis,\" said Meadows.

    "text": "Este sábado, después de \" [Socios de la parrilla](https://www.t13.cl/buscador/Socios%20de%20la%20parrilla)\", [Canal 13](https://www.13.cl/) transmitirá a modo de homenaje, un episodio inédito y póstumo del programa “De tú a tú”, debido al reciente fallecimiento de la destacada y querida actriz nacional Carmen Barros. Se trata de un capítulo grabado hace poco tiempo y que estaba considerado para ser parte de la próxima temporada del espacio de conversación conducido por [Martín Cárcamo](https://www.t13.cl/buscador/mart%C3%ADn%20carcamo). Martín conversó con Carmen, que fue parte de la historia y de las artes en Chile, con más de 70 años de trayectoria profesional, con una vida fascinante y que destacó, entre muchos otros proyectos, como la primera “Carmela” de la icónica obra musical “La pérgola de las flores”.

Es que mi padre murió a los 101, entonces a lo mejor heredo eso y le digo 'mira tata Dios, no me llames todavía'”. Carmen Barros comentó que su padre conoció a Adolf Hitler La emblemática actriz, a sus 98 años, rememoró la historia de su familia, sus padres, sus tres hijos, sus rutinas y sus costumbres diarias: “No me interesa mucho la comida, me encanta el pan con mantequilla… de vez en cuando una copita de vino con el almuerzo” y agregó, “estoy un poco floja porque me da lata caminar. Soy feliz, sentada y moviéndome dentro de mi casa”. La apreciada artista tocó el piano y cantó la famosa canción de la “Carmela”. Además, desclasificó que su padre conoció a Adolf Hitler en razón de su cargo diplomático. Fue en ese período donde Carmen habló con sus padres y les dijo “que era una estupidez estudiar cuando yo voy a ser cantante”. También contó que a los 15 años le confesó lo siguiente: “Lo lamento mucho, pero no quiero ir más al colegio, así que yo quiero clases en la casa de las cosas que necesito… y ellos me encontraron razón en mi pedido”. Carmen Barros reveló en \"De tú a tú\" que su padre falleció a los 101 años y que uno de los momentos más duros de su vida fue la muerte de su madre a los 60 años: “A mi madre la tengo aquí, conmigo todo el tiempo, pienso en mi madre todo el tiempo, creo que ella está conmigo. Soy muy creyente... soy pecadora, pero creyente”. En relación a la muerte, sentenció “odio la muerte, me parece que es la cosa más estúpida que existe. Siendo creyente, pienso qué lata más grande morirse, cuando no tenemos por qué morirnos si podemos seguir viviendo. ¿Por qué el tata Dios no viene para acá y juega con nosotros?”, y añadió “como soy muy creyente, tengo la seguridad que me voy a encontrar con todos”. También conversó con Martín sobre sus amores, su marido Jaime Amunátegui, con quien tuvo tres hijos y una inestable relación, pero terminaron siendo muy amigos. Luego, se volvió a enamorar y pensó en casarse, pero el hombre falleció en un accidente de automóvil. “Fue muy doloroso, fue terrible porque al día siguiente íbamos a salir con los niños. Murió de forma instantánea y salió desde mi casa... pero acepto todo lo que me pasó y tengo una gran tranquilidad porque sé que a todos me los voy a encontrar. Y sí, amaba mucho a esa persona”, manifestó Carmen Barros. Cambiando de tema, desclasificó que no le gustaban los hogares ni asilos para personas mayores, “yo tengo casa, yo quiero morir en mi departamento. Eso es lo que yo pediría. Ahora, si no va a ser así, no lo sé, pero prefiero no pensarlo, porque me carga la muerte”. En relación a su carrera artística, su personaje ícono fue “Carmela” de “La pérgola de las flores” en el año 1960, que cambió su vida para siempre. A ella, al principio, no le gustó porque encontraba que no sabía nada de folclore. Además, desclasificó que Isidora Aguirre, la autora de la obra, “estaba empecinada que yo no fuera la ‘Carmela’, porque encontraba que yo era demasiado refinada y tenía un poco de razón, porque yo me sentía falsa haciéndola”. Junto a su larga carrera en el teatro, recordaron en \"De tú a tú\" su participación en inolvidables teleseries de Canal 13, como “Los títeres, “La intrusa” y “Acércate más”, además de su participación en diversos programas, como “Martes 13” y “Noche de gigantes”. Asimismo, rememoraron su rol protagónico en la versión chilena de la serie “Los años dorados”, en el ex UCV-TV.",
