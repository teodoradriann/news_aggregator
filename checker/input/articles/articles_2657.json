    "text": "- Oops!Something went wrong.Please try again later. - Oops!Something went wrong.Please try again later. By Nandita Bose and Steve Holland WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The White House Correspondents' Association said on Thursday CNN has rejected multiple requests to include White House pool reporters inside the studio during the first presidential debate between incumbent Joe Biden and Republican rival Donald Trump. The press pool, made up of representatives of major news organizations including Reuters, accompanies the president on foreign and domestic trips and normally has access to any event where he speaks or appears in public, with the goal of keeping the U.S. public informed. It is extremely rare for them to be barred from an event in the United States. \"WHCA is deeply concerned that CNN has rejected our repeated requests to include the White House travel pool inside the studio,\" Kelly O'Donnell, president of the White House Correspondents' Association, said in a statement. \"The pool is there for the 'what ifs?' in a world where the unexpected does happen,\" she said, and to provide \"context and insight by direct observation and not through the lens of the television production.\" These reporters are there to see what is said and done when the microphones and cameras are off, and provide independent observation, she wrote, with duties \"separate from the production of the debate as a news event.\" O'Donnell said both the Biden and Trump campaigns agreed to the WHCA's request. CNN has only agreed to allow one White House print pool reporter to enter the studio during a commercial break to \"briefly observe the setting.\" The network will also allow still photographers from other outlets to cover the candidates inside the studio and will provide a television feed of the debate to other networks. CNN has put in place many other rules for the first showdown including two commercial breaks, no props and muted microphones except when the candidates are recognized to speak. The network said in a statement it is a member of the WHCA and respects the role the group plays to further press freedom and access. But the debate was being held without an audience in a CNN studio and is closed to the press, CNN said. \"Precedent matters for future debates,\" O'Donnell said, alluding to Biden and Trump's face off again in September. The National Association of Black Journalists has also asked CNN to accredit reporters from local Black-owned news organizations, after none of Atlanta's Black news groups got credentials to be on-site for the debate.

    "title": "The Future Of Disaster Forecasting: How GenAI Can Revolutionize Our Response",
    "text": "Op-Ed By Dr. Sean Subas . Photo: Hurricane Milton Intensified To Cat 5 Threatening Florida’s West Coast As hurricanes Helene and Milton pound the southern U.S., the devastating physical impact is undeniable—destroyed homes, widespread power outages, and entire communities displaced. Yet, amidst this destruction, there’s an opportunity for transformation. These relentless storms shine a bright spotlight on the urgent need to overhaul our disaster forecasting tools, and at the center of this revolution is Generative AI (GenAI).\nThe current hurricane season underscores the limits of traditional forecasting tools, which, despite their advancements, still face challenges in accuracy and speed. This is where GenAI can lead the charge, offering unparalleled advancements in prediction and response. Imagine a network of GenAI-controlled drones, patrolling storm-ravaged skies in real-time, providing live data to forecast models and ensuring no critical detail is missed. These AI-driven systems can quickly assess rapidly changing weather patterns and anticipate storm shifts in ways humans simply can’t match.\nREAD: Hurricane Helene Insured Losses Climb To $1.3 Billion In Florida\nOne such application already in the works is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) use of GenAI in hurricane hunting. Their planes, designed to fly into the heart of the storm, collect invaluable data. However, traditional methods have their limits. On one mission, NOAA’s planes were violently tossed around inside Helene’s turbulent core. With GenAI, we could deploy autonomous drones, sparing pilots from these dangerous conditions while feeding real-time storm data to improve forecasting accuracy.\nGenAI doesn’t stop there. It can enhance the predictive power of our models, using vast datasets to analyze storm patterns and offer better forecasts. By processing millions of data points from previous storms, GenAI systems could predict not only a storm’s path but also its likely impact on specific regions—how much flooding to expect, what areas are most at risk of landslides, and how the winds will affect power grids.\nThis level of precision and rapidity could save countless lives. Early warnings powered by GenAI could prompt faster evacuations, better preparedness, and more effective resource allocation for affected regions. The economic savings from such accuracy could also be enormous, as governments and organizations could avoid the unnecessary expenditures that often come with over-preparing or misallocating resources.\nREAD: Florida AG Commissioner Urges USDA To Issue Disaster Declaration For Hurricane Milton Agricultural Damage\nThe power of GenAI is not just about prediction; it’s about real-time responsiveness. Drones equipped with GenAI could autonomously decide where to deliver relief supplies based on evolving storm conditions and needs. They could also guide rescue operations, detecting areas hardest hit or most in need of assistance. Such innovation could transform how we respond to natural disasters, helping us act faster and smarter.\nBut to fully harness the potential of GenAI, we need investment and collaboration across sectors. Governments, tech companies, and research institutions must work together to implement these systems and ensure they are designed for public safety, not just profit. This is an opportunity to make our world safer, more resilient, and better prepared for the storms ahead.\nThe 2024 hurricane season is a clear call to action. GenAI offers a path forward, a way to revolutionize disaster forecasting and response. It’s time we embrace this technology—not just to predict the next storm, but to protect lives in the face of nature’s fiercest challenges.\nDr. Sean Subas is an expert in AI and public policy, focusing on the intersection of technology and electoral integrity.\nPlease make a small donation to the Tampa Free Press to help sustain independent journalism .

    "text": "Judge Cannon Sets the Stage for What Could Be a Crushing Blow for Jack Smith on Trump’s Attorney-Client Privilege\nThe Florida judge will hold hearings on whether the 45th president’s attorney’s notes can enter into evidence.\nJudge Aileen Cannon’s decision to revisit another judge’s ruling allowing Special Counsel Jack Smith to collect evidence from one of President Trump’s attorneys could upend the government’s Mar-a-Lago prosecution.\nThe testimony of that lawyer, Evan Corcoran, is crucial to Mr. Smith’s allegations that Trump committed crimes of obstruction at his manse. A district court judge at the District of Columbia, Beryl Howell, ruled that the prosecutor could “pierce” attorney-client privilege, which normally shields communication between a lawyer and his client. At an earlier stage of the case, Mr. Smith convened grand juries at Washington and south Florida.\nMr. Corocran is central to Mr. Smith’s effort to convict Trump for criminal obstruction. Judge Howell allowed the government to interview the attorney before a grand jury, and ordered him to turn over two recordings he made about his interactions with the 45th president. The notes from those recordings disclose efforts by Trump to work to retain possession of the secret documents.\nAttorney-client privilege, while one of the most ancient known to the common law, is not absolute. In Clark v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled that a “client who consults an attorney for advice that will serve him in the commission of a fraud will have no help from the law. He must let the truth be told.” Mr. Corcocran appears in Mr. Smith’s indictment as “Trump Attorney 1.” The special counsel writes that the former president and his valet, Waltine Nauta, moved “boxes that contained documents with classification markings so that Trump Attorney I would not find the documents and produce them.”\nMr. Corcoran’s notes also capture Trump praising an attorney working for Secretary Clinton for deleting her emails. The lawyer has recused himself from the Mar-a-Lago case, though he advises Trump on other matters. The special counsel will have to prove anew that Mr. Corcoran’s “assistance was obtained in furtherance of the criminal or fraudulent activity or was closely related to it.”\nJudge Cannon held sealed proceedings on this issue this week. She writes that Mr. Smith warned her that the reopening of the privilege question could “devolve into a mini-trial.” The jurist, though, is committed to holding a hearing, Judge Howell’s determination notwithstanding.\nThe judge writes that “it is the obligation of this Court to make factual findings afresh on the crime-fraud issue.” She acknowledges that Mr. Smith will likely not be thrilled by the possibility of Mr. Corcoran testifying at this pre-trial session, but affirms that such displeasure “cannot overcome a defendant’s right to make a proper, even if tailored, factual record on an important claim of privilege with constitutional dimensions.”\nJudge Cannon explains in a footnote that Mr. Smith “expressed a general disfavor with subjecting any of his witnesses to cross-examination and possible inconsistent statements.” She allows that Mr. Smith can “request the Court to impose reasonable limitations on the evidence produced to ensure efficiency and control.” She reminds him, though, that Trump bears a “low burden to prove the applicability of the crime-fraud exception.”\nIt was not all good news for Trump. Judge Cannon denied his request for a “Franks hearing,” a forum where a defendant can contest the affidavit that underlies a search warrant. She found that he has not made the requisite preliminary showing to allow such a session. The judge demurred from ruling on some of Trump’s motions to suppress evidence collected at Mar-a-Lago.",

Recently, this timeless debate took an intriguing turn when Boston Celtics star Jaylen Brown, fresh off a 2024 NBA Finals victory and a Finals MVP award, was asked to list his all-time NBA starting five. The list he provided has set the basketball world ablaze with discussions and controversies, primarily because of one glaring omission. Jaylen Brown, who has fought hard over the years to solidify his legacy, has finally achieved one of the highest honors in the sport by winning a championship with the Celtics. His contributions were pivotal, earning him the coveted Finals MVP as the Celtics triumphed over the Dallas Mavericks in a five-game series. With this victory, Brown has cemented his place in Celtics history, but he knows the journey to greatness doesn't end with one championship. As he continues to build his legacy, his recent all-time starting five selection has left fans and pundits puzzled and debating his choices. The shocking omission was no Michael Jordan. When House of Highlights posted Jaylen Brown’s all-time starting five on July 24, 2024, the internet exploded with reactions. Brown's picks included Steph Curry, Kobe Bryant, Kevin Durant, LeBron James, and Bill Russell. Michael Jordan, widely regarded as the greatest basketball player of all time, is absent from this lineup. This omission quickly became the focal point of discussions, overshadowing the praise for the other legends on his list. Fans and analysts were quick to express their surprise and confusion. For many, the exclusion of Jordan, a six-time NBA champion and five-time MVP, was unfathomable. Social media buzzed with varying opinions. One fan commented, \"Jordan been getting disrespected as of late. If you got Kobe, you gotta have MJ too.\" READ MORE: Stephen Curry Hints at Unlikely Warriors Exit if THIS Happens Next Season: ‘I’d Have a Hard Time With That’ This sentiment was echoed by many who believe Jordan’s legacy is untouchable. Conversely, another fan pointed out, \"Those are his picks. Everyone doesn't have to include MJ. Michael Jordan to me is the greatest to play the game. But they asked Jaylen Brown his top five.\" This highlights the subjective nature of such lists and the personal preferences that influence them. Brown’s inclusion of Steph Curry and Kevin Durant, while understandable given their incredible careers, further fueled the debate. Curry’s revolutionary impact on the game with his shooting and Durant’s scoring prowess are undeniable, but for many, they don’t surpass Jordan’s all-around excellence and competitive spirit. The controversy surrounding Brown’s list underscores the complexity of comparing players across different eras and styles of play. Fans' reactions are a divided opinion As the discussions continued, it became clear that Jaylen Brown’s all-time starting five had polarized opinions. Some fans and commentators appreciated the modern flair and strategic reasoning behind his picks, while others couldn’t move past the omission of Michael Jordan. A post from Clutch Points summed up the controversy well: \"Jaylen Brown's all-time starting 5 👀 Steph Curry, Kobe Bryant, Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Bill Russell. Do you agree?\" Supporters of Brown’s selections argue that each player on his list has a unique and transformative impact on the game. Steph Curry’s unparalleled shooting ability, Kobe Bryant’s relentless drive and scoring, Kevin Durant’s versatility and efficiency, LeBron James’s all-around brilliance and longevity, and Bill Russell’s unmatched defensive dominance and championship pedigree all make strong cases for their inclusion. However, the absence of Jordan, who epitomizes excellence and competitiveness, remains a sticking point for many. The debate also touches on a broader issue: the generational differences in how greatness is perceived. Older fans who witnessed Jordan’s dominance firsthand often have a different perspective compared to younger fans who grew up idolizing players like Curry and Durant. This generational divide adds another layer to the ongoing discussions about Brown’s controversial list. In conclusion, Jaylen Brown’s all-time starting five has reignited the perennial debate about the greatest players in NBA history. While his picks reflect his personal preferences and the influence of modern basketball, the exclusion of Michael Jordan has sparked widespread debate and differing opinions. This controversy highlights the subjective nature of such discussions and the diverse perspectives of fans. Don't you agree?
