    "text": "The Dark Side of the Succulent: What are the Disadvantages of Aloe Vera? Aloe vera, that spiky succulent perched on windowsills and touted as a natural remedy for everything from sunburn to digestive woes, certainly has a compelling PR campaign. But before you slather it on every inch of your being or start guzzling aloe juice by the gallon, let’s pull back the curtain and examine the potential downsides of this seemingly miraculous plant. While aloe vera offers a host of benefits, like any other substance, it’s not without its drawbacks. The main disadvantages of aloe vera stem from potential allergic reactions , digestive upset from internal use (particularly aloe latex), drug interactions , and the risk of serious health problems with prolonged or excessive use, including kidney damage and liver issues . It is also important to note that aloe latex might have the potential to cause cancer.\nUnderstanding the Different Forms of Aloe Before we dive deeper, it’s crucial to understand the two main forms of aloe vera used:\nAloe Gel: This is the clear, jelly-like substance found in the inner leaf. It’s primarily used topically for its soothing and moisturizing properties. Aloe Latex: This is the yellow, bitter liquid found just under the plant’s skin. It contains anthraquinones , potent compounds that act as a strong laxative. Most disadvantages are related to aloe latex use. Disadvantages of Topical Aloe Vera While generally safe for topical use, aloe vera isn’t without its potential problems:\nAllergic Reactions: Some individuals are allergic to aloe vera. People who are allergic to garlic, onions, or tulips are more likely to react. Symptoms can include itching, redness, hives, or even contact dermatitis . Always perform a patch test on a small area of skin before applying aloe vera extensively. Skin Sensitivity: While aloe vera is known for soothing skin, it can actually cause dryness or irritation in some people, particularly those with sensitive skin . Ironically, it can even lead to pimples if it dries out the skin too much. Burning Sensation: If you experience a burning sensation after applying aloe vera, especially if it’s a commercial product, it could be due to preservatives or other ingredients in the gel. It might also indicate that aloe vera simply doesn’t agree with your skin. Dehydrating Effect: Aloe vera has a cooling effect, but in some instances, can lead to dehydration of the skin and lead to pimples appearing due to the dehydrating effect. Its better to stop Aloe vera gel and consider alternative moisturizer in its place. Disadvantages of Oral Aloe Vera This is where the potential for significant side effects increases:\nDigestive Distress: The aloe latex , present in whole-leaf extracts and some aloe vera juices, is a powerful laxative. It can cause severe abdominal cramps, diarrhea, and electrolyte imbalances , especially with prolonged use. Drug Interactions: Aloe vera can interfere with the absorption of certain medications. Specifically, it can lower blood potassium levels , which can be dangerous for people taking heart medications or diuretics. It can also interact with diabetes medications, potentially causing dangerously low blood sugar levels . Kidney Damage: Long-term use of aloe latex in high doses (even as little as 1 gram per day) has been linked to acute kidney failure . The anthraquinones in aloe latex can damage kidney cells. Heart Problems: Chronic hypokalemia (low potassium) caused by aloe latex abuse can lead to heart arrhythmias and other serious cardiac issues. Liver Toxicity: While less common, prolonged use of aloe vera supplements has been associated with drug-induced hepatitis and other forms of liver toxicity. Pseudomelanosis Coli: Long-term use of aloe latex can cause pseudomelanosis coli , a darkening of the colon lining. While often asymptomatic, its long-term implications are not fully understood. Potential Carcinogen: Some studies have suggested a potential link between aloe latex and cancer, particularly colon cancer. While more research is needed, it’s a serious concern to consider. Not Recommended for Children: Oral use of aloe latex and whole-leaf extract is generally not recommended for children under 12 due to the risk of digestive upset and other side effects. Impact on Blood Pressure: Aloe Vera Gel Powder May Help Lower Blood Pressure; therefore, it might offer some benefit as a complementary therapy, but research is still very limited. Who Should Avoid Aloe Vera? Certain individuals should exercise extreme caution or completely avoid using aloe vera, especially orally:\nPeople with Allergies: Those allergic to plants in the Liliaceae family (garlic, onions, tulips, etc.) may be allergic to aloe vera. People with Intestinal Problems: If you have intestinal problems, such as Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) , avoid oral aloe vera, as it can exacerbate your symptoms. People with Heart Disease: Oral aloe vera can interfere with heart medications and worsen electrolyte imbalances, which can be dangerous for people with heart conditions. People with Hemorrhoids: The laxative effect of aloe latex can irritate hemorrhoids. People with Kidney Problems: Aloe vera can worsen kidney problems, especially with long-term use of aloe latex. People with Diabetes: Aloe vera can lower blood sugar levels, potentially causing hypoglycemia in people with diabetes who are taking medication to lower their blood sugar. People with Electrolyte Imbalances: Aloe vera can disrupt electrolyte balance, particularly potassium levels. Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women: The safety of oral aloe vera during pregnancy and breastfeeding hasn’t been established, so it’s best to avoid it. Responsible Aloe Vera Use If you choose to use aloe vera, follow these guidelines:\nChoose Reputable Products: Opt for aloe vera products from reputable brands that clearly state the ingredients and processing methods. Read Labels Carefully: Pay attention to the ingredients list and avoid products that contain aloe latex if you’re using it topically or if you’re concerned about its laxative effects. Start Small: When trying a new aloe vera product, start with a small amount to see how your skin or body reacts. Monitor for Side Effects: Be aware of potential side effects and discontinue use if you experience any adverse reactions. Consult Your Doctor: Talk to your doctor before using aloe vera, especially if you have any underlying health conditions or are taking medications. Aloe vera can be a beneficial plant, but it’s crucial to be aware of its potential downsides. By understanding the risks and using aloe vera responsibly, you can minimize the chances of experiencing adverse effects. Remember, natural doesn’t always mean safe, and moderation is key.\nYou can find further information on environmental health and other related topics on enviroliteracy.org , the website of The Environmental Literacy Council .\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Here are some common questions about the disadvantages of aloe vera:\n1.

    "text": "[Europe](../) Floods in Europe: Hungary, Netherlands and Lithuania brace themselves Parts of northern and central Europe continued to grapple with flooding on Thursday after heavy rain. Netherlands and Germany erect flood barriers Flood barriers have been erected this week at numerous locations along the Dutch river Ijssel following an extended period of heavy downpours. According to authorities, water levels in the river that runs northwards through the Netherlands have risen “very fast”, sometimes at a rate of one centimetre per hour. The elevated water levels have been caused by recent heavy downpours, combined with severe weather in neighbouring Germany that has left soil saturated, making it difficult for water to drain away. A barrier near the German city of Magdeburg was opened for the first time in a decade to ease pressure from the Elbe River, while some animals were removed from their enclosures at a safari park in northern Germany. Danube reaches highest level since 2013 floods Water levels in Budapest have hit their highest in the last decade. Late on Wednesday, the peak level of the Danube that runs through the Hungarian capital was at 6.93 metres. Cars left on the closed lower embankments of Buda and Pest had to be removed due to rising water levels, the mayor’s office said. Parts of Budapest were flooded in several places. Heavy heavy and snow, which then thawed under exceptionally mild weather, aggravated the flooding. Lithuania braces itself for heavy rain Anticipating heavy rainfall in the coming days, floodwaters in western Lithuania are expected to rise. Although water levels have begun to recede in certain areas, a forecast of 15-25 mm of rainfall has created concerns. Western Lithuania, home to the delta of the Baltic country’s largest river, the Nemunas, typically experiences flooding in the spring. However, this winter marks the second instance in two months when natural water levels have reached critical levels.

    "text": "FOX News Channel host Sean Hannity and Ainsley Earhart are engaged. (Fox News)\nFOX News Channel hosts Sean Hannity and Ainsley Earhart have officially taken their relationship to the next level.\nHannity proposed to Earhart at their hometown church on Christmas, cementing their long-term bond. The newly engaged couple received blessings and support from their children and said they “couldn't be happier.”\n“We are so happy and so grateful to our families for their love and support during this wonderful time in our lives,” Earhart and Hannity said in a statement.\nEarhardt and Hannity have always been bonded by their deep faith and have put God first in their relationship, so proposing at their home church was the “perfect place” to ask that question, the couple said. After their engagement, they met with the minister.\nFOX News dominates viewership in 2024, joins CNN and MSNBC to lead in unprecedented news year\nAlthough the couple prefers to keep their personal lives out of the spotlight, they make their long-distance relationship work by taking weekend trips between New York, where Earhart is based, and Florida, where Hannity lives. Out of respect for each other's careers, Hannity and Earhart have signed long-term contracts to remain with Fox News Media. Earhart will continue to co-host “FOX & Friends” in New York, while the prime-time star will continue to host the show. “Hannity” is a show of the same name from Florida.\nEarhart and Hannity were both previously married, and she and her ex-spouse “are still good friends” and “we all support each other.”\n“In fact, we informed them in advance that this was happening,” they said.\nEarhart and her ex-husband have a friendly relationship and are “progressing well” in raising their daughter.\nHannity has continued to receive the highest ratings in his time slot for the past 15 years, making him the longest-running cable news host in history. A Fox News original, he joined the network when it launched in 1996 and previously served as co-host of “Hannity & Colmes.” In addition to his prime-time show, Hannity reaches millions of viewers with his hit radio show, which is syndicated to 750 stations across the United States.\nThe FOX News Media Spotlight Awards recognize team members who have gone above and beyond in 2024\nHannity recently added the new FOX Nation show “Shaun” to his portfolio. The show includes long-form interviews and debuted earlier this month featuring a sit-down with the iconic Sylvester Stallone and his wife Jennifer Flavin Stallone. He also recently hosted the 5th Annual FOX Nation “Patriot Awards,” which honors everyday heroes for their service and patriotism.\nEarhart joined the network in 2007 and has been co-host of “FOX & Friends” since 2016. This popular three-hour morning show has held the number one spot for more than 20 consecutive years. Earhart is the author of four New York Times bestselling books, including three No. 1 children's books, and also hosts Ainsley's Bible Study on FOX Nation. Earlier this year, she was awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree from the University of South Carolina for her professional accomplishments as a broadcast news and writer.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nBrian Flood is a media editor/reporter for FOX News Digital.

    "text": "President & CEO Shelton J. Haynes Announces Southpoint Park Shoreline Restoration Project to Receive 2024 ACEC Engineering Excellence Award / EIN News / -- Roosevelt Island, NY, Jan. 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation (RIOC) President and CEO Shelton J. Haynes is pleased to announce the Southpoint Park Shoreline Restoration project has been recognized by the American Council of Engineering Companies (ACEC) of New York as one of their 2024 New York Engineering Excellence Platinum Award winners. The project, which will be honored at the 2024 ACEC Excellence in Engineering Awards on April 13 th , was selected for its outstanding quality of work and the engineering expertise demonstrated in its planning and execution.\n“Southpoint Park is one of the many wonderful open spaces we enjoy here on Roosevelt Island, and the shoreline restoration project the park underwent several years ago was an important step in expanding shoreline access while preserving the beauty of the park for future generations,” said RIOC President and CEO Shelton Haynes. “When we brought Langan on to do the project design, the park was in dire need of work, including to the seawall which was failing. We know how devastating the effects of climate change can be, so the design had to be thoughtful and forward thinking. Their plan not only fixed the wall and remediated the contaminated soil in the area, but it also preserved native wildlife and habitats, and made accessing the shoreline much easier for park visitors. Today, Southpoint Park is a beautiful, serene escape for island residents and an attractive place to visit for people from all over the world. I want to thank ACEC New York for this wonderful honor and congratulate the RIOC team and Langan for their well-deserved recognition on this project. I could not be more proud of what our teams accomplished.”\n“Southpoint Park is such a beautiful part of our island, and the restoration work our team did in conjunction with our outside partners was truly transformative,” said RIOC Acting-COO Mary Cunneen . “Protecting our waterfronts is a huge priority for the corporation, as is protecting our natural island ecosystem. This project managed to successfully do both, while coming in on time and under budget. I want to thank ACEC for this great honor and congratulate all of the RIOC team members who helped bring this amazing project to fruition.”\nThe $11 million-dollar Southpoint Park Restoration project was designed to improve overall conditions in the park for every species that calls Roosevelt Island home. It included two newly expanded and improved waterfront promenades with widened pedestrian footpaths, enhanced scenic views in and around the park, and measures to protect 1,600 linear feet of shoreline.

    "text": "A fourth-grade student compared former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley to former Secretary of State and Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry Thursday.\nHaley was speaking at a town hall when she called on the 9-year-old boy during a question-and-answer session at a New Hampshire town hall. “Chris Christie thinks that you’re a flip-flopper on Donald Trump issue and honestly, I agree with him,” the kid said. (RELATED: Farewell, Catturd? Nikki Haley Proposes Ban On Anonymous Social Media Accounts)\n“You’re basically the new John Kerry, if you remember John Kerry from 2004,” the kid continued. “So my question is, how — how can you be — how can you change your opinion on that in just eight years, and will you pardon Donald Trump?”\nWATCH:\nFormer Republican Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a critic of former President Donald Trump and another presidential candidate.\n“I, for one, am very proud of you for coming, and very proud of you for listening, and very proud of you for asking that question,” Haley said to the kid. “So the first thing I’ll tell you is politics is about distraction, right? And so people like my friend Chris Christie are going to say, ‘she’s a flip-flopper.’”\n“But let’s look at it,” Haley continued. “What is he saying I’m flip-flopping on? He’s basically saying that I’m not hitting Trump hard enough, right? The interesting part of this whole situation is anti-Trumpers think I don’t hate him enough and pro-Trumpers think I don’t love him enough.”\nHaley also said she would pardon Trump if he were to be convicted.\n“I would pardon Trump. And the reason is, first of all, we don’t know what they’re going to find — innocent, guilty, any of that, and we want everybody to be innocent until proven guilty,” she said. “But the second thing is, if he is found guilty, a leader needs to think about what’s in the best interest of the country. What’s in the best interest of the country is not to have an 80-year-old man sitting in jail, that continues to divide our country. What’s in the best interest of the country would be to pardon him so that we can move on as a country and no longer talk about him.”\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

    "title": "il dicembre più caldo degli ultimi 130 anni mette a rischio la stagione sciistica in italia - Cronache",
    "text": "DAGONEWS Si annuncia un inverno di grandi delusioni per i vacanzieri che intendono raggiungere le piste da sci in Italia e Francia. Il dicembre più caldo in Italia negli ultimi 130 anni e le forti piogge sulle Alpi francesi minacciano di cancellare la stagione sciistica. La regione settentrionale del Piemonte, che sta vivendo il suo dicembre più caldo dal 1890, ha visto le località invernali chiudere le piste a causa della mancanza di neve. Bardonecchia, al confine francese, è stata particolarmente colpita dall’alta pressione, con temperature che hanno raggiunto i 16°C in pieno dicembre. Anche le località dell’Appennino fuori Roma, tra cui Terminillo e Ovindoli, hanno dovuto affrontare problemi con un manto nevoso inadeguato, che ha portato alla chiusura delle piste nonostante le numerose prenotazioni natalizie. Nel frattempo in Francia, le famose località di Morzine e Les Gets sono state costrette a ritardare l'apertura della stagione sciistica a causa di acquazzoni di tipo monsonico, con temperature non abbastanza fredde da provocare nevicate adeguate. Anche se negli ultimi giorni sui pendii si è sparsa una leggera neve, si prevede che ulteriori precipitazioni invadano i pendii. Luca Mercalli, presidente della Società Meteorologica Italiana, ha attribuito l'aumento delle temperature al riscaldamento globale e ha messo in guardia da una prospettiva cupa per le regioni alpine, affermando che le temperature osservate a dicembre erano simili a quelle previste per la fine dell'estate. «Il continuo aumento delle temperature dovuto al riscaldamento globale provocherà in futuro un'ulteriore riduzione della stagione invernale, con più pioggia e meno neve anche in alta quota. Nei giorni prima di Natale, per trovare zero gradi centigradi dovevi salire fino a quasi 3.000 metri. Queste sono temperature che normalmente troviamo a fine estate\", ha aggiunto Mercalli.",
