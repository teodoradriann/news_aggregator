    "text": "A premature baby boy, born at just 22 weeks and three days and who spent 137 days in the neonatal intensive care unit, beat the odds and is now eight months old.\nJadeyn Gajeski, baby Henry’s mother, was attending a routine 20-week pregnancy checkup when she found out her pregnancy was not going as well as she thought.\n“They did the ultrasound and they saw that my cervix was shortened to nothing. It was unmeasurable is how they worded it”, Jadeyn said . “They stitch your cervix, just try to hold [the] baby in longer. It did not last”.\nBarely two weeks later, Jadeyn had to be rushed to Sanford Medical Center to give birth. Her son Henry, born at 22 weeks and three days, was immediately taken to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), which was the only facility in the area capable of looking after such a premature baby.\n“You don’t think you’re going to come home with a baby”\nHenry weighed less than a pound when he was born. His mother described the experience as “terrifying”.\nHELP LIFENEWS SAVE BABIES FROM ABORTION! Please help LifeNews.com with a donation !\n“It’s very scary and it just doesn’t seem real that you’re actually going to have a baby so soon. You know, you were just celebrating. You’re halfway through your pregnancy and here you are. So you have no idea how it’s going to go”, she said .\n“You can’t breathe. Your chest is tight. You’re just constantly worried. And then you see him and he’s see-through and he is hooked up to all these things, You don’t think you’re going to come home with a baby. You really don’t”.\nHowever, Henry was in the hands of a specialist NICU team, who supported him for 137 days in hospital. One of the doctors, Dr Mohamed Mohamed, said that the hospital has seen about a dozen very premature babies like Henry in the last five years, and that they have a survival rate of about 60% at this hospital.\n“We have a micropreemie program, which is a specialized program to take care of the little ones”, Dr Mohamed said . “The smaller you are, you’ll have immature organ systems and that includes the brain, the small intestine, the lungs, the heart and the skin, the immune system. Every system might cause or pose a risk of having a life-threatening event. In the case of Henry, he needed to be on the breathing machine right away. And he stayed on the breathing machine for two months”.\nFour months later, he was able to go home\nIn addition to being on the breathing machine, Henry experienced a perforated bowel and an infection of the heart while in hospital.\nHowever, after over four months, he was discharged from the hospital and is now mostly healthy at eight months old.\nDr Mohamed said “We put [in] the effort, and we work hard toward having a good outcome. But when I see Henry now in front of me and he’s interacting and he’s doing very well, this is what gives me joy for my job”.\n“It really makes you feel like you have a miracle in your hands”, Henry’s mother said . “He is the strongest boy I know. I mean, he’s just amazing. I know he is really meant to be here”.\n“It’s the best thing ever. I mean, you just look at him randomly at home and you get tears. You do. Because he’s a miracle”.\nMore premature babies are surviving from 22 weeks gestation\nAt 22 weeks, Henry was born below the current UK abortion limit of 24 weeks. Babies like Henry highlight a clear contradiction at the heart of our abortion law and current medical practice.\nOn the one hand, the law permits ending the lives of babies at 22 and 23 weeks, and, on the other hand, current medical practice strives to save the lives of many babies born prematurely at 22 or 23 weeks gestation.\nThe annual abortion statistics for England and Wales in 2021 (the most recent year for which a full year of data is available) reveal that 755 ‘ground C’ abortions were performed when the baby was at 22 or 23 weeks gestation (ground C is the statutory ground under which the vast majority of abortions are permitted and there is currently a 24-week time limit for abortions performed under this statutory ground).\nSpokesperson for Right To Life UK, Catherine Robinson, said “It is so uplifting to hear of stories like Henry’s and the dedication of the medical team who supported him through so many difficulties in hospital. Very premature babies demonstrate how resilient even the youngest humans in our society are and point to the humanity of the children in the womb”.\nLifeNews Note: Republished with permission from Right to Life UK.",

Storm Gerrit has bought challenging conditions that have now eased, on Thursday the weather will be blustery with showers, with some heavy rain in parts. Friday will continue with rain and wind and some central locations will brighten up, until Saturday morning which will see a possible deep area of low pressure moving in from the west and will affect Ireland and western parts of the UK. It is possible that snow will fall to lower levels for a short period of time across Scotland, with transient snow across the higher grounds in northern England also. Met Office Chief Forecaster, Steven Ramsdale said, “This system is likely to bring a range of weather including hill snow. “Heavy rain will spread across all but the far north on Saturday affecting similar areas previously affected by Storm Gerrit. “However, this rainfall will be a step down from that seen during Storm Gerrit.” Looking further into 2024, Nick Silkstone, Met Office Deputy Chief Forecaster said, “Through to mid-January, there is a signal for a shift in the pattern compared to the winter so far, with more settled and colder-than-average conditions becoming increasingly likely.”",

    "title": "'Bail Out,' Says Investor About Intel Stock",
    "text": "Intel (\n[NASDAQ:INTC](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/intc)) had a downer of a year in 2024. While much of the tech industry reaped the rewards of the [AI](https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence) revolution, Intel lagged significantly behind its data center competitors, particularly the market-dominating Nvidia. As a result, Intel shares lost more than half of their value during the year.\nStay Ahead of the Market:\n- Discover outperforming stocks and invest smarter with\n[Top Smart Score Stocks](https://www.tipranks.com/screener/top-smart-score-stocks)\n- Filter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities using\n[Tipranks' Stock Screener](https://www.tipranks.com/screener/stocks)\nIntel’s Board of Directors was clearly unhappy with the company’s trajectory, expressing their displeasure by removing long-time Intel veteran Pat Gelsinger from his CEO position in December. Gelsinger, who was brought back to lead Intel in February 2021, had evidently failed to win over the board with his ‘5 Nodes in 4 Years’ strategy.\nWhile company ‘shake-ups’ can cause instability, they may also help struggling firms begin to turn things around. Not so in this case, asserts one investor known by the pseudonym Value Edge, who argues that Intel’s board has failed to learn from previous mistakes.\n“The Board’s co-CEO decision mirrors past mistakes, focusing on product groups while neglecting the critical foundry segment, risking Intel’s future competitiveness,” the investor opined.\nValue Edge explains that Gelsinger was in the midst of guiding crucial significant technological developments that could have helped Intel regain its competitive advantage. The investor adds that the company veteran of nearly three decades was exceptionally familiar with Intel, its technology, and the opportunities (and challenges) within the industry.\nThe newly appointed co-CEOs, however, come from finance and marketing backgrounds – lacking the technical expertise Gelsinger brought to the role. As Value Edge points out, this gap in technical knowledge could further hinder Intel’s efforts to reclaim its standing in the rapidly evolving tech landscape.\n“The board wants to focus on the products group, which lost its moat in the first place due to the lagging foundry segment that Gelsinger was trying to fix,” Value Edge argued. The investor contends that an enhanced emphasis on the products group demonstrates a lack of interest in pursuing the investments needed to turn Intel’s Foundry competitive once more.\n“The current Board is made up of many of the same folks that have overseen the entire awful past decade for Intel,” concludes Value Edge, who, unsurprisingly, professes scant faith in the current leadership. The investor is therefore downgrading INTC to a Strong Sell. (To watch The Value Edge’s track record,\n[click here](https://www.tipranks.com/experts/bloggers/the-value-edge))\nOver on Wall Street, however, the jury is still out. With 1 Buy, 21 Hold, and 5 Sell recommendations, INTC holds a consensus Hold (i.e., Neutral) rating. Nevertheless, its 12-month average price target of $24.53 suggests an upside of 23%.

Precisamente el retorno de Keylor se da en un momento clave, porque al tico solamente le resta este semestre de contrato y es libre de decidir su futuro.\nLa prensa habla sobre el regreso de Keylor\nMedios franceses han dado la información del regreso de Keylor Navas a la portería del PSG. También Diario AS de España hizo un análisis y afirmó que este podría ser uno de los últimos encuentros del centroamericano en París.\n“A sus 37 años, Keylor esta posiblemente ante uno de sus últimos partidos con la camiseta del PSG, ya que incluso Arnau Tenas, fichado en verano, le había adelantado en la rotación de la portería, aunque el canterano del Barcelona no ha entrado en la convocatoria para el partido de Copa ante el Revel por unas molestias musculares”, asegura el medio español\n🚨 INFO RMC SPORT🚨— RMC Sport (@RMCsport)\nLe gardien costaricien va débuter dans les buts ce dimanche pour le 32e de finale de Coupe de France face à Revel.\n[https://t.co/lpa2FVIBdN] [pic.twitter.com/DT4wltx5Uu] [January 6, 2024]\n🇨🇷 Keylor Navas sera le gardien titulaire demain contre l'US Revel.— Media Parisien (@MediaParisien)\nIl effectue son retour dans les cages parisiennes après sa dernière apparition le 23 janvier 2023 contre le Pays de Cassel en Coupe de France.\n[@ArthurPerrot] [pic.twitter.com/KE74koBmqu] [January 6, 2024]",

A atriz foi visitar o ator Paulo César Pereio, ex-marido de Cissa Guimarães. Atualmente, a instituição abriga 53 artistas, no entanto, a casa passa por dificuldades e precisa de doações. Stepan Nercessian, presidente do Retiro dos Artistas, criticou a falta de mobilização da própria classe artística: \"Vou atrás de empresário, advogado e político para pedir que não cortem a água. Mas artista tem que ter consciência, devia vir aqui sempre. Quando vêm, ficam encantados. Fui até num psicólogo para entender por que os artistas se mobilizam até para salvar hamster e aqui temos que pedir pelo amor de Deus. O psicólogo respondeu que talvez seja resquício daquele passado, de eles não quererem se ver nessa imagem de 'olha o que vai acontecer com você'\", disse ele, a uma entrevista para o Globo. Além de Paulo Cesar, Marieta também reencontrou o ator Silvio Pozatto, de 67 anos. Ele chegou à instituição há um ano e meio. O ator busca \"uma vida mais segura e tranquila\". Silveio sofre de parkinson há 12 anos, solteiro e sem filhos, suas únicas companhias são os amigos do Retiro e um gato: “Gosto daqui. E quero fazer a cirurgia de implante de eletrônico no cérebro para recuperar a fala e os movimentos e voltar a atuar”, disse.",

Three faculty members from MAPP were honored among the campus community members who create, nurture, expand and amplify social impact through education, programs and research, in and outside the classroom. Brandy Espinola, Julie Gabrielli and Marccus Hendricks were nominated by their colleagues who recognized their meaningful work. The award reflects their impressive commitment to our Do Good Campus core values: Experiential Learning; Social Impact; Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging; Service to Humanity; Collaboration; and Innovation. Learn more about each faculty member’s impact below: [Brandy Espinola](/people/brandy-espinola), Climate Resilience and Sustainability Program Director, Environmental Finance Center Brandy is leading a collaborative effort to implement the county-wide Climate Action Plan that she helped draft last year with multiple government departments, local nonprofits and county residents in Prince George’s County, Maryland. [Julie Gabrielli](/people/julie-gabrielli-ncarb-leed), Associate Clinical Professor, Architecture Program Julie dedicates herself to sustainable architecture, both through her professional architecture career and her teaching practice.
