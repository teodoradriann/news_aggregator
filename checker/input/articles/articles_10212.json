(Atlanta News First) - Police said a suspect has been arrested in the deadly shooting of a man at a DeKalb County apartment complex last month. On July 7, DeKalb County police said they responded to a person shot in the Woodcrest Village apartment complex on the 2300 block of Woodcrest Walk around 6:45 a.m. Police said a 25-year-old man was found dead “from multiple gunshot wounds inside a residence” at the complex. RELATED: [Man fatally shot at DeKalb County apartment complex, police say](https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/2024/07/07/man-fatally-shot-dekalb-county-apartment-complex-police-say/) On Thursday, DeKalb police said they’d arrested the victim’s roommate in the shooting. They said the suspect shot the victim in their apartment after an argument and left the scene. The suspect was arrested Wednesday and booked into the DeKalb County Jail. Police have not identified the victim, the suspect or the charges the suspect is facing. In November, officials said a person was injured in a shooting near the same complex.

    "text": "Heads up sky watchers! Zip up your jackets and get your cameras ready! Tonight may be the best opportunity to see the Aurora Borealis also known as the Northern Lights from right here in Maryland! The Space Weather Prediction Center has G4 (Severe) Geomagnetic Storm Conditions ongoing and expected through tonight. The solar storm is what causes those dazzling colors in the sky that are usually visible closer to the Arctic Circle. The huge solar storm will make the auroras larger, brighter, and visible further south than normal. With clear skies tonight, this will be the best chance to catch them starting right after dark through the early morning hours! The last couple of times we had a solar storm of this magnitude we were unfortunately overcast so they were not visible from the ground. Go find a safe, dark area away from city lights, look to the north, and you may be lucky enough to experience one of the most incredible sights on earth. In addition to the Auroras, solar storms have impacts on earth such as disrupting some satellite communications, and making some power grids more unstable. Thankfully precautions are often taken to protect those high tech systems to minimize impacts from solar storms the same way protections can be set up to protect properties from floods. How exactly do solar storms cause the Aurora (Northern Lights)? Watch the video above for an explanation. Good luck, Aurora Hunters!",

    "title": "South Korea's chipmaking industry sparks back into life, as shipments and production increase - SiliconANGLE",
    "text": "The South Korean government has revealed that its chipmaking industry recorded its biggest-ever gains in both production and shipments this year. The increased momentum is one of the clearest signs yet that the global chipmaking industry is poised to bounce back from doldrums it entered in 2022 as the world reopened following the COVID-19 pandemic.\nData released by South Korea’s national statistical office shows that chip production increased by 42% in November compared to the year prior, representing its largest gain since late 2002. Shipments rose by 80% over the same period, while inventories expanded by 36%.\nThey are promising numbers which point to a rebound in what is South Korea’s most important industry. The decline in semiconductor shipments has weighed heavily on the country’s economy, significantly hampering the profitability of two of its biggest companies – Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. and SK Hynix Inc. According to Bloomberg, the figures indicate that a nascent recovery in the global technology industry is also gaining steam.\nThe growth bodes well, not only for the prospects of South Korea’s major chipmakers, but also its heavy machinery industry, the country’s finance ministry said in a statement.\nThe $160 billion global memory chip market has been hammered by an economic slowdown that began in 2022 and dampened demand for personal computers and smartphones, which are the two most important products that use Samsung’s chips. Because of this, prices for memory chips collapsed over the last year, and the company’s semiconductor business recorded its first-ever loss in the second quarter, followed by another in October when it announced its third quarter results . Had it not been for the strong performance of its smartphone business, Samsung could have posted an overall net loss.\nAlthough Samsung’s latest results disappointed investors, the company said in October that it was already seeing signs of a recovery in the semiconductor market, thanks in part to its focus on more profitable advanced chips for artificial intelligence workloads. Samsung officials also said they’re expecting prices of memory chips to increase in the fourth quarter.\nPhoto: Vecstock/Freepik",

    "title": "INSECURITY IN NIGERIA: A CALL FOR RESPONSIBLE POLICING - THISDAYLIVE",
    "text": "As the global community celebrated the birth of Jesus Christ, a tragic incident unfolded in Plateau State. A Christian community became the target of a terrorist attack, resulting in the loss of over 100 innocent lives. The heart-wrenching scenes of crying babies strapped to the backs of their deceased mothers circulated on social media, amplifying the gravity of the situation. While leaders worldwide, including the President of Nigeria, condemned this heinous act, a disconcerting comment from a notable figure in the Nigerian social media sphere exposed a shocking level of insensitivity and hypocrisy. The individual, a former media assistant to a past president of Nigeria, callously suggested that the mass killing in Jos could be excused due to the vastness of the region and the purported lack of adequate policing. This remark did not only lack empathy but also highlighted hypocrisy, given their history of enjoying government-issued security personnel during unofficial outings. The irony is evident when recalling a personal encounter with this ex-government official, who once arrived at a Lagos restaurant in a government-issued SUV accompanied by two uniformed police officers for a non-official trip. It is hypocritical for someone with a history of parading the streets with uniformed police officers to claim that Nigeria’s police force is undermanned to fulfill its constitutional duty of safeguarding citizens. This contradiction raises concerns of hypocrisy or cognitive dissonance. The prevailing practice of government appointees, celebrities, and their families enjoying armed police escorts exacerbates the issue. The recent Christmas day killing is not an isolated incident but a recurring tragedy in Nigeria’s middle belt region. Despite a substantial presence of security forces, terrorists continue to evade security measures, terrorizing innocent citizens. Nigeria currently falls short of the United Nations’ recommended ratio of one police officer for every 450 citizens, with the actual ratio being one officer for every 600 citizens. It is crucial to note that the issue of inadequate policing is not unique to Nigeria. In Canada, for instance, as of 2022, there was one police officer for every 550 citizens, and the country is significantly larger than Nigeria. However, crimes are promptly addressed, and law enforcement agencies intervene without prolonged delays. During the Christmas day attack in Nigeria, terrorists reportedly operated unchallenged for 10 hours before leaving. While there is a clear need to augment the manpower of the Nigerian Police Force, it is equally imperative to ensure that personnel are strategically deployed to areas requiring heightened security. The misuse of police escorts by the political class and their associates must be curbed to redirect resources where genuinely needed. In conclusion, the Christmas day tragedy underscores the urgent need for responsible and strategic policing in Nigeria. It is a call to action for political leaders and their appointees to refrain from abusing the use of security operatives, ensuring that these resources are utilized judiciously for the benefit of all citizens.

    "title": "India’s electricity generation rises 15% in May amid record demand | Mint",
    "text": "India produced 15.06% more electricity in May than a year ago to meet record electricity demand due to a severe heatwave.Total power generation stood at 167.55 billion units in the month compared to 145.61 billion units a year ago, according to the Central Electricity Authority’s (CEA) monthly report. Thermal power, generated from mostly coal- and gas-based plants, contributed 127.87 billion units, 14.67% higher than last year.Power demand touched a record high of 250GW on 30 May as a prolonged heatwave across North India kept electricity demand elevated in May and most of June. The peak power demand is projected to reach 260GW in 2024-25.Also Read: The unusual electricity trends of 2023, explainedThe peak demand is currently hovering at around 200GW as the onset of the South-West monsoon has brought the temperature down across the country.The peak power demand on Thursday was 207.18 GW, according to data from the Grid Controller of India Ltd.The power ministry has already directed domestic coal-based plants to blend 6% imported coal till September to ensure uninterrupted power supply. However, hydropower generation is expected to rise during the monsoon. In May, electricity generation from large hydro projects rose 9.92% to 11.62 billion units.Also Read: What’s behind India’s surging hunger for electricity?Renewable energy projects, excluding hydro, generated 22.50 billion units, 18.34% more than the year-ago period.The surge in power demand has also led to the government reviewing its long-term demand forecast. On 2 July, Pankaj Agarwal, secretary to the Union ministry of power, said the ministry may raise its projections for peak electricity demand for 2031-32.“We have been receiving feedback that our (projection) of 384GW may be an underestimate. That might be easily crossed,” he said, adding that peak power demand may even hit 400GW by 2031-32. To meet that demand, India’s power generation capacity would have to rise to 900GW from nearly 445GW now, including thermal and renewable energy sources, Agarwal said.Also Read: Electricity use plunges in North, West India due to summer rainsHe added that the updated National Electricity Plan may reflect the national demand estimate.",
