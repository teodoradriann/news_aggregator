    "title": "Mineradores de Bitcoin veem queda de receita com BTC abaixo de US$ 100 mil",
    "text": "O preço do Bitcoin caiu quase 10% desde que atingiu uma alta intradiária de US$ 102.735 na terça-feira (7). Consequentemente, os mineradores foram afetados por essa queda, com a receita diária na rede https://br.beincrypto.com/aprender/o-que-e-bitcoin/ caindo para o menor nível em 30 dias.\nCom o enfraquecimento da pressão de compra, o BTC pode cair abaixo de US$ 90 mil, portanto, ainda mais as perdas dos mineradores, que já enfrentam dificuldades financeiras.\nMenor volume de transações\nAs taxas de transação e recompensas de bloco têm reduzido a receita dos mineradores de BTC constantemente desde 2 de janeiro. De acordo com a Glassnode, a receita atual é de 398,20 BTC, representando uma queda de 24% na última semana.\nQuando a receita dos mineradores de Bitcoin cai, significa que eles estão ganhando menos por validar transações e proteger a rede. Essa queda geralmente ocorre quando o preço do Bitcoin diminui, reduzindo o valor das recompensas pagas aos mineradores.\nNos últimos dois dias, o Bitcoin registrou uma queda significativa. Para contextualizar, durante a sessão de negociação intradiária de terça-feira (7), os investidores negociaram brevemente a principal criptomoeda a US$ 102.735.\nNo entanto, a atividade de venda logo ganhou força, fazendo o preço da moeda cair. No momento da publicação, o BTC é negociado a US$ 93.419.\nÀ medida que mais mineradores de Bitcoin se apressam para vender suas moedas e evitar mais perdas em suas participações de BTC, a quantidade de BTC mantida em carteiras de mineradores tem diminuído constantemente. Até o momento, isso está em 1,79 milhão de BTC, uma queda de 0,005% desde 2 de janeiro.\nPreço do BTC se mantém ou cai abaixo de US$ 90 mil?\nNo gráfico diário BTC/USD, o BTC é negociado ligeiramente acima do suporte em US$ 91.437. Diante desse cenário, caso as vendas continuem, o preço pode romper esse nível e cair abaixo da faixa de US$ 90 mil, com a moeda sendo negociada a US$ 85.224. Nesse caso, a receita dos mineradores de Bitcoin cairia ainda mais, o que levaria mais mineradores a vender suas moedas para cobrir os custos operacionais.\nEntretanto, se o sentimento do mercado melhorar e a demanda aumentar, o preço da moeda pode alcançar US$ 102.538, o que aumentaria a receita dos mineradores de BTC.\ncriptomoedas| Janeiro de 2025\nIsenção de responsabilidade\nTodas as informações contidas em nosso site são publicadas de boa fé e apenas para fins de informação geral.
