    "title": "32 pct of Israeli adults not satisfied with their economic situation in 2023: survey-Xinhua",
    "text": "JERUSALEM, Aug. 15 (Xinhua) -- An annual social survey published by Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics on Thursday showed that 32 percent of Israeli adults, or about 2 million people, were dissatisfied with their economic situation in 2023. The survey examined the welfare of the country's population and the concessions residents make due to financial difficulties. As part of the survey, 6,474 people aged 20 and over were interviewed, representing about 6.2 million people of the age range, out of the total Israeli population of about 9.9 million. The survey also found that 9.5 percent of those aged 20 and over, representing about 587,000 adults, felt they were poor last year, while 26 percent of those polled said they were unable to cover monthly household expenses. Besides, 7.4 percent made concessions on food purchases and 4.9 percent gave up having a hot meal at least once every two days due to economic difficulties, the survey showed. Regarding health matters, 9.7 percent of the participants gave up medical care they needed, 6.2 percent gave up buying prescription drugs, and 25 percent skipped dental care due to financial difficulties, according to the survey. ■",

    "title": "Met Office forecasts snow and heavy rain after deadly Storm Gerrit - Wales Online",
    "text": "The last few days of 2023 will see strong winds, rain and even snow featuring in parts of the UK. An area of low pressure which pushes in from the west on Saturday will be the most dominant feature in the forecast leading up to the new year.\nThe challenging conditions brought by Storm Gerrit have now eased, but Friday will be blustery with showers, some heavy, with some central locations likely to see the brightest conditions. During the early hours of Saturday morning a potentially deep area of low pressure will move in from the west to affect Ireland and western parts of the UK.\nAs the system moves eastwards, the boundary between the area of low pressure and the relatively colder conditions further north and east will lead to a band of transient snow across some of the high ground of northern England and Scotland. It is possible this snow could fall to lower levels for a brief period of time across Scotland.\nThe flooded Somerset levels between Langport and Muchelney after heavy rain from Storm Gerrit. Langport, Somerset. 27 December 2023. Steven Ramsdale is a Met Office Chief Forecaster. He said: “This system is likely to bring a range of weather including hill snow. Heavy rain will spread across all but the far north on Saturday affecting similar areas previously affected by Storm Gerrit. However, this rainfall will be a step down from that seen during Storm Gerrit.”\nNick Silkstone, Met Office Deputy Chief Forecaster, said: “Through to mid-January, there is a signal for a shift in the pattern compared to the winter so far, with more settled and colder-than-average conditions becoming increasingly likely.”\nThousands of homes remain without power as the post-storm cleanup begins in the wake of Storm Gerrit. Around 1,500 homes in Scotland experienced their second night without power in Scotland while a lightning strike hit supplies in Wales on Thursday.\nPower company Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks said it had restored supply to more than 46,000 properties that lost power due to the storm, with people in the north east and Shetland worst affected.\nCUPAR, SCOTLAND - DECEMBER 28: Residents in the Kinloss Park area start to clear up following the affects of Storm Gerrit on December 28, 2023 in Cupar, Scotland. Almost 8,000 homes are still without power following yesterdays storm which brought blizzards and flooding to many parts Scotland. (Photo by Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images) They said the remaining homes should be reconnected on Friday with welfare vans serving hot food and drink to affected customers from 9am. Operations director Andy Smith said: “This has been a difficult couple of days for the communities affected and I’m grateful to them for their patience and support as our teams work extremely hard to restore power.”\nNational Grid UK said 36,000 properties were without power in Ceredigion on Thursday after lightning struck. Three men died after their 4×4 vehicle was submerged in the River Esk, near Glaisdale, on Thursday, North Yorkshire Police said.\nA supercell thunderstorm moved across the northwest of England on Thursday after a similar storm is thought to have resulted in a tornado that damaged homes in Greater Manchester on Wednesday. Around 100 properties were damaged by what police called a “localised tornado” in Stalybridge, Tameside and in the badly-hit village of Carrbrook.\nHayley McCaffer, 40, who lives in Carrbrook, told the PA news agency that some of her neighbours’ houses “are an absolute disaster” with missing roofs and “squished” cars. Damage will be covered by standard property insurance policies, the Association of British Insurers has said.\nResidents in the Kinloss Park area start to clear up following the affects of Storm Gerrit on December 28, 2023 (Photo by Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images) ScotRail said many lines have been reopened but urged passengers to check for the latest information before travelling, a message echoed by LNER, Avanti West Coast and London Northwestern Railway who suspensed or cancelled services due to damage or system faults.\nFriday will see significant disruption for travellers wishing to travel on the London Euston and Watford Junction lines with services expected to be up and running by the end of the day. In Wales, the aftermath of the recent severe weather will see rail services hampered until Monday.\nDamaged houses can be seen in Carbrook Village in the aftermath of a tornado (Photo by Ryan Jenkins/Getty Images) Ferry services also experienced cancellations and delays due to storm activity with operator DFDS confirming sailings between Dover and France were delayed due to strong winds in the English Channel. Air travel in and out of the UK saw cancellations but most services have returned to normal.\nThe Met Office reported the worst of Storm Gerrit had passed with the last few days of 2023 forecast to be unsettled with strong winds, rain and even snow on higher ground.\nMet Office chief forecaster Steven Ramsdale said: “Heavy rain will spread across all but the far north on Saturday, affecting similar areas previously affected by Storm Gerrit. However, this rainfall will be a step down from that seen during Storm Gerrit.”\n ",

    "text": "The cryptocurrency exchange BISSNEX has recently completed key market expansion actions and gained increased recognition from the U.S. federal government and financial systems. BISSNEX's acquisition of the U.S. MSB license signals the continuous strengthening of the platform's capabilities and the adjustment of its global market strategy.\nFollowing the challenging progress of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF proposals, the U.S. has shown rising friendliness towards the crypto industry, supporting cryptocurrency taxation as property. Although their overall attitude towards cryptocurrencies remains cautious, as the industry continues to evolve, governments worldwide are gradually implementing trading and regulatory standards for the crypto industry. The widespread circulation of mainstream cryptocurrencies has made BISSNEX particularly attentive to expanding into the U.S. market.\nThe International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) previously released the \"Consultation Report on Policy Recommendations for Crypto-Asset and Digital Asset Markets,\" indicating further progress in global crypto industry regulation standards. Soon after, BISSNEX obtained the Money Services Business (MSB) license from the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a milestone demonstrating BISSNEX's compliance with the highest industry standards in Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) practices. The platform will expand its services with higher compliance standards and strict regulatory requirements.\nSince its establishment, BISSNEX has been committed to creating a safe and legal trading environment to ensure the best protection for users' interests and assets. The acquisition of the U.S. MSB license is a significant achievement in BISSNEX's compliance efforts, representing its leading position in trading compliance. The granting of this license requires exchanges to undergo rigorous due diligence to ensure compliance with the highest financial regulatory standards.\nIn the U.S. states of New York and California, cryptocurrencies are considered legal digital assets. Based on its global market strategy, BISSNEX has strategically established its headquarters in New York, a decision made after careful consideration of the global regulatory environment of cryptocurrencies. The U.S., particularly New York, is known for its stringent regulatory framework, providing a solid foundation for financial business expansion. BISSNEX recognizes the importance of working closely with regulatory authorities to create a safe and sustainable cryptocurrency trading environment.\nBISSNEX is positioned at the forefront of compliance in the crypto industry. As a global financial centre, New York offers abundant financial resources and professional talent, providing BISSNEX with ample development opportunities. BISSNEX has also announced plans to expand its compliance team, recruiting various talents specializing in cryptocurrency regulations. This team will work tirelessly to ensure BISSNEX's operations comply with all relevant local and international regulations, providing users with peace of mind during trading. In addition to advancing compliance work, BISSNEX actively collaborates with regulatory bodies and industry associations to stay abreast of the latest developments in the cryptocurrency field.\nAs the crypto industry continues to evolve, BISSNEX remains firmly committed to operating with the highest compliance and security standards. The acquisition of the MSB license is a clear practice of this commitment, demonstrating BISSNEX's determination to provide a safe and compliant trading environment for its users.\nDisclaimer: This press release may contain forward-looking statements.

    "text": "NFL Analyst Critiques Giants Owner John Mara’s Coaching Comments\nThe New York Giants are struggling this season, currently sitting at 2-5 and last in the NFC East. Head coach Brian Daboll is under pressure after losing three of the last four games, and fan frustration is mounting over quarterback Daniel Jones’ performance, especially after his benching in Week 7. Owner John Mara's refusal to shake up the coaching staff has drawn criticism from ESPN analyst Joe Fortenbaugh, who labeled Mara's comments about maintaining the status quo as a \"huge mistake.\" There is speculation that coaching changes may be imminent in the offseason if the current struggles persist.\n- The Giants have a record of 2-5, losing three of their last four games.\n- Daniel Jones was benched during the Week 7 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles.\nSome may argue that consistent leadership is necessary to build a stable team culture, and immediate drastic changes could further destabilize the franchise.\nState of Play- The team's current strategy is to ride out the season without major changes.\n- Future coaching decisions may be influenced by prominent figures like Bill Belichick and Mike Vrabel in the off-season.\nAs the season progresses, continued losses could lead to major changes within the coaching staff and management before the offseason, particularly if fan discontent grows.\nBottom LineThe Giants face critical decisions ahead, as failing to adapt and respond to mounting pressures may have lasting repercussions for the team's future direction.\nRead more at The Cold Wire\nThe summary of the linked article was generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence technology from OpenAI",

    "text": "GUWAHATI: Days after an Indian mountaineering team scaled an unnamed and unconquered peak in Arunachal Pradesh's Tawang region and named it after the sixth Dalai Lama, a furious China on Thursday hit out at what it called an illegal operation in \\\"Chinese territory\\\".A team of 15 from the Dirang-based National Institute of Mountaineering and Adventure Sports (NIMAS), which comes under the ministry of defence, scaled the peak last Saturday, and named it 'Tsangyang Gyatso Peak' in honour of Tsangyang Gyatso (17th-18th century CE), the sixth Dalai Lama, who was born in Tawang.While the Army sends several adventure expeditions, many see these as dual-purpose endeavours aimed also at rebuffing the claims of China on Arunachal Pradesh. China insists on calling the Indian state 'Zangnan'.Naming the peak after the sixth Dalai Lama would not have also gone down well with the Chinese who have tried to belittle the significance of the institution which serves as a reminder of Tibet's existence as an independent entity before it was grabbed by Beijing.A defence ministry statement saying the choice of name of the 6th Dalai Lama is a tribute to his timeless wisdom and his profound contributions to the Monpa community and beyond, seemed to rub it in.Asked for his reaction, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told the media in Beijing: \\\"I'm not aware of what you mentioned.\\\"\\\"Let me say more broadly that the area of Zangnan is Chinese territory, and it's illegal, and null and void for India to set up the so-called 'Arunachal Pradesh' in Chinese territory. This has been China's consistent position,\\\" he said.The expedition, led by NIMAS director Col Ranveer Singh Jamwal, took 15 days to conquer the 6,383-metre peak.According to defence PRO Lt Col M Rawat, the peak was one of the most technically challenging and unexplored summits in the region and was overcome after \\\"immense challenges, including sheer ice walls, treacherous crevasses, and a two-km-long glacier\\\".(With agency inputs)",

    "text": "The Scripps News Group and the Scripps Howard Fund have raised more than $75,000 to provide relief for those impacted by the devastating floods in Central Texas. But Scripps said with many families in need of support, its looking for additional donations.\nEvery donation to the Scripps disaster relief campaign supports local, trusted nonprofit organizations in Central Texas working tirelessly to help neighbors in need with response, relief and recovery efforts.\nSince the Scripps campaign launched on July 7, the support has seen more than $50,000 donated by hundreds of people from more than 25 states. The E.W. Scripps Company has also contributed $25,000 to bolster the relief efforts.\nLast Friday’s flooding killed at least 120 people, while more than 150 people remain unaccounted for nearly a week later. Among the lives lost were those of dozens of campers and staff from a Central Texas summer camp. The floods are now the deadliest instance of inland flooding in the U.S. since 1976, when Colorado’s Big Thompson Canyon flooded, killing 144 people, according to a new report.\n“The scale of this disaster is devastating,” said Meredith Delaney , Scripps Howard Fund president and CEO. “The donations from hundreds of Scripps News Group viewers from across the U.S. and our local station markets will make a significant impact toward providing essential care and support. But the need is far from over. This campaign, in partnership with The E.W. Scripps Company, allows us to connect the generosity of Scripps viewers with our neighbors in Texas who need immediate and sustained assistance.”\nThe Scripps News Group, which is comprised of national and local Scripps journalists, will show the impact of the donations in the coming weeks across all of its platforms.\nTo give: Text FLOODING to 50155 OR visit scrippsnews.com/relief.

    "title": "Dodgers star Mookie Betts has his sights set on 'legend' status | FOX Sports",
    "text": "Dodgers star Mookie Betts has his sights set on 'legend' status [Mookie Betts](https://www.foxsports.com/mlb/mookie-betts-player) has accomplished just about everything there is to accomplish so far in his baseball career, but he continues to set lofty goals for himself and is not afraid to talk about them. Things are no different as he prepares to enter the 2024 season. Speaking with [Ken Rosenthal](https://www.foxsports.com/personalities/ken-rosenthal) in an interview for FOX Sports, the [Los Angeles Dodgers](https://www.foxsports.com/mlb/los-angeles-dodgers-team) star said that he wants to be \"a legend in the game,\" and that he is motivated by his family and his \"drive within myself.\" \"I want to be great,\" Betts [told Rosenthal](https://theathletic.com/5307113/2024/02/29/mookie-betts-dodgers-rosenthal/). \"When I'm done, I want you to remember not necessarily just the baseball player, but Mookie. I want to be a legend in the game.\" On the field, Betts certainly seems to be tracking toward legend status. He won the AL MVP with the [Boston Red Sox](https://www.foxsports.com/mlb/boston-red-sox-team) in 2018, helping the ballclub win the World Series that year as part of a dominant 108-win season. He won his second title two years later, helping the Dodgers win the World Series in 2020. Betts hasn't won an MVP since 2018, but he's been a perennial candidate for the honor. Since 2016, he's finished in the top 10 in voting for his respective league's MVP in all but one season, recording second-place finishes three times. One of those second-place finishes came last season when Betts hit a career-high 39 home runs while slashing .307/.408/.579. However, Betts recognized that his path to becoming a legend might transcend his play on the field. He has \"no idea\" how to create that, but Betts wants to capitalize on whatever opportunities he can to build toward it. \"I'm just kind of going about it and bringing smiles to people's faces when I can, trying to sign some autographs when I can, be the best player I can be when I'm playing, be the best teammate I can be,\" Bett said. \"Whatever comes my way, I'm just going to try and be the best at it no matter what. If it's sitting on the bench, I want to be the best cheerleader. Whatever it is. I think if I can do that, I feel like that will create some type of legacy that I can leave. You won't remember all the on-field stuff, but I want people to remember who Mookie was off the field for sure.\" Betts actually attempted something new last season in an attempt to boost his legacy. He participated in the Home Run Derby for the first time in his career, telling FOX Sports' [Rowan Kavner](https://www.foxsports.com/personalities/rowan-kavner) at the time that [he believed it would help his goal of becoming a Hall of Famer](https://www.foxsports.com/stories/mlb/inside-mookie-betts-slugging-spree-and-drive-to-become-a-hall-of-famer). \"I think my goal now is to become a Hall of Famer,\" Betts told Kavner in July 2023. \"And whatever that consists of, that's what I'm trying to do. The rings, being a team guy, asserting myself a little bit, kind of embracing the platform, all those types of things I think will be what help me get to that end goal.\" Betts didn't fare well in the Home Run Derby, hitting just 11 home runs in the first round, which was the fewest hit by anyone in last year's event. Beyond that, he's taken opportunities to grow his brand. He's launched a podcast, where he often speaks with other MLB stars, and a YouTube channel, taking fans behind the scenes of what it's like to be a star baseball player. He also has a movie production agreement with Propagate Content and helped produce a film on Jackie Robinson. Ultimately, Betts' on-field production will likely play the biggest factor in determining whether he's a \"legend in the game\" when he retires. At 31, Betts still has a considerable amount of time to add to his résumé. But the 2024 season might be his best shot at adding another ring. The Dodgers had a record-spending offseason, adding [Shohei Ohtani](https://www.foxsports.com/mlb/shohei-ohtani-player) and [Yoshinobu Yamamoto](https://www.foxsports.com/mlb/yoshinobu-yamamoto-player), among many others. And the extra help comes after a pair of disappointing postseason finishes for the Dodgers, in which they lost in the NLDS both years after 100-win regular seasons. Betts failed to do his part, hitting 2-for-25 over the last two postseasons. Betts realizes that has to change. \"We've been to the playoffs so many times and haven't come through,\" Betts told Rosenthal. \"We've gotten one, but 1-for-9-or-10 is not very good in our sport, really in general.\" Texas Rangers coach Hector Ortiz dies at 54 after long battle with cancer Yankees star Juan Soto says he 'never wanted to leave' Nationals: 'It was a great team' Five observations from New York Yankees spring training MLB wants to make starting pitching more prominent, but it's a tough task 2024 MLB Opening Day: Schedule, dates, teams, how to watch Why Chris Sale might be exactly what Braves need to win another World Series Shohei Ohtani homers in first spring training game with Dodgers 2024 MLB odds: Aaron Judge favored to win HR title; Can Shohei Ohtani make up ground?

    "text": "By John McGary ,\n6 hours ago\nLetcher County Magistrate Debra Collier says a payroll tax would ensure that workers at the proposed prison in Roxana would contribute to the county's bottom line and pay for road funds and economic development. (Chris Collier) The U.S. Bureau of Prisons final environmental impact statement on the proposed prison complex in Letcher County allows for a 30-day public comment period ending August 12th. Letcher County Magistrate Debra Collier said the construction and permanent jobs it would provide are needed, due to the decline of the coal industry and coal severance tax revenue.\n“When you bring more revenue in, you have the ability to maintain roads better. You have the ability to, for economic development.”\nOpponents of the prison say it will harm the environment, including endangered animal species, and that most of the people who’d work at the prison will come from elsewhere. Collier said she backs a proposal that would ensure non-Letcher residents contribute to the county’s bottom line.\n“I am a huge supporter of an occupational tax that we do not have in the county now and if we will pass the occupational tax that some of the fiscal court members are supporting, then our county is going to get a huge jump in revenue.”\nThe prison would be built on reclaimed coal mine land in the community of Roxana. ** WEKU is working hard to be a leading source for public service, and fact-based journalism.
