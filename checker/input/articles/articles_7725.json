    "text": "NEW DELHI: Karnataka's chief minister on Thursday sparked a controversy by saying that there is a difference between 'Hindu' and 'Hindutva'. In a recent address at the 139th Congress Foundation Day in Bengaluru, the CM said that while the state respects and practices Hindu traditions like worshipping Ram and organizing Ram Bhajans, the version of Hindutva espoused by the BJP is inauthentic.The chief minister criticized the BJP, Jan Sangh, RSS, and Sangh Parivar for their lack of participation in the Indian freedom struggle, contrasting this with the Congress party's significant role in it. He urged people to recognize and spread awareness about the BJP's falsehoods.Siddaramaiah highlighted the Congress party's achievements post-independence, citing the construction of dams during Nehru's tenure and attributing the expansion of the internet in India to late PM Rajiv Gandhi. He accused the BJP of being adept in spreading lies.He asserted that social justice in India is a result of the Congress party's efforts. The CM expressed confidence in the party's future successes, mentioning Rahul Gandhi's upcoming padayatra and his potential to lead the country as the next Prime Minister.",

    "title": "Dublin man presumed dead in Ukraine went to war to 'defend his heritage'",
    "text": "Alex Rhyzuk AN IRISHMAN PRESUMED dead in Ukraine had plans to return home and join the Irish Defence Forces. Alex Rhyzuk (20) began volunteering with the Ukrainian army two years ago. He was recently reported missing and is now presumed dead. Just two weeks ago, RTÉ’s Prime Time broadcast a special report from the frontlines in Ukraine. Rhyzuk was one of the interviewees. In previously unseen footage, he explains why he felt compelled to travel to Ukraine and risk his life. He lost several friends and family members in the war, and had followed developments on Telegram from the beginning. Having little siblings, I could not let this go. “At the end of the day, I was born and raised in Ireland. It’s given me many opportunities and many things in my life that I’m grateful for … but at the same time I cannot forget my heritage.” Rhyzuk’s parents are Ukrainian and came to Ireland over two decades ago. He grew up in Rathmines, Dublin, and was educated in CBS Synge Street, which he said he had “very good memories” of. He explained that, when he expressed interest in fighting in the war, his parents hid his passport to try to protect him. When they didn’t give it back, Rhyzuk applied for a new one and at the age of 18 travelled to war-torn Ukraine. He had only planned to stay for a year, but when the time was up, he decided he couldn’t go home yet, as he became “addicted” to the war. “War is brutal,” he said. In war if you value your life too much, you go into a very bad stage. “If someone unfortunately dies, the biggest responsibility we have at that point is to get their bodies back [home] so they can have a proper funeral.” Rhyzuk only has an Irish passport, not a Ukrainian one, which may make his repatriation more difficult. Finn Boylan of FinnHouse Films was the last person to interview Rhyzuk on camera. “He was highly-effective at what he did. Motivated, driven.. He was a man with huge ideals to defend his heritage,” said Boylan. He also said Rhyzuk had told him of his plans to return to Ireland and join the Irish Defence Forces’ Ranger Wing. He says his last message to Rhyzuk was: “Are you alive?” “It’s difficult to have another ghost haunt my hard drive … but nobody else has to speak for him, he can speak for himself,” said Boylan, referring to the footage taken of Rhyzuk just weeks ago.",

    "text": "[HackerRuso](/user/HackerRuso)a [ambito.com](/go/link/3916814) [#1](c1#c-1) Realista diría.\nUcrania no tiene posibilidad alguna de ganar la guerra, es como si España entrara en guerra con USA, más vale una retirada a tiempo a que siga muriendo gente.\nDejemos que los ucranianos decidan libremente su futuro en las próximas elecciones...\nAh! No! Que tienen prohibida a la oposición y encarcelados (los que no han sido asesinados) a los disidentes. Y el país tan endeudado que no pueden hacer otra cosa que no sea lo que le digan sus dueños extranjeros. Eso sin contar con el tema de la corrupción endémica que compra voluntades en muchos casos para poder sobrevivir.\nSi se hubiera dedicado a lo que prometió cuando lo eligieron: acabar con la guerra civil y conseguir la reconciliación nacional. Pero se dejó engañar por los cantos de sirena y ahora va camino de ser otro Sadam Hussein engañado por el Imperio, aunque aún está a tiempo de terminar como otro Guaidó refugiado.\n[#14](c14#c-14) Hay partidos opositores en el parlamento ucraniano.\nAhora moverás la portería a que no son opositores de verdad.\n\"[...] Cuando ves que estás derrotado, que las cosas no van, necesitas tener el coraje de negociar”. Supongo que el Papa estará informado de la situación sobre el terreno como para decir eso.\n[#4](c4#c-4) ¿Tú en serio crees que puede? ¿ Puede el sahara español decidir su futuro ? pues no, y lo sabes. ¿Pueden los gazatíes decidir su futuro? pues tampoco, y lo sabes, y así hasta el infinito. ¿Puede el Nepal decidir su futuro si a China se le pone entre ceja y ceja la idea de asaltarla? pues tampoco, podríamos seguir contínuamente. Sólo te salvas si tienes al \"primo de zumosol\" que te apoya o bien formas parte de algo más grande como la otan, pero en caso contrario lo tienes clarinete, pero vamos, que esto habrá sido así desde que el mundo es mundo, ¿Puede un conejo decidir su futuro si un depredador ya lo ha atrapado? no se.. es lo mismo. Al margen de si está bien o está mal, el mundo no va de eso.\n[#12](c12#c-12) No se que te metes pero si crees lo que dices sabes que esa tumba va a ser a costa de muchas muertes o algo peor en todo Europa.\nQue hubieran invertido en armamento en su momento o integrado en la OTAN. Ahora a ceder en lo que pida Rusia.",
