    "title": "Stars converge in Palm Springs to celebrate year's best films, Emma Stone's career",
    "text": "PALM SPRINGS, Calif. — Emma Stone reflected on her career highlights and Meryl Streep praised Billie Eilish and ''Barbie'' with saving the movie industry Thursday during one of the first stops of Hollywood's awards season.\nStone, Streep, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Cillian Murphy were among the A-listers who descended on the desert for the Palm Springs International Film Festival's annual opening gala. Stars were in an upbeat, and generally grateful, mood at the gala after a tumultuous year for their industry that included two strikes and rapid changes to the theatrical and streaming landscape.\nStone, who snagged a best actress nomination for Sunday's Golden Globes for her performance in ''Poor Things,'' accepted the career achievement award, which was presented by her co-stars Mark Ruffalo and Willem Dafoe.\n''I'm grateful that I get to keep trying new things and for the opportunity to make choices when it comes to work because I know how rare and fleeting it can be to choose what you want to do or who you want to work with as an actor,'' she said.\nColman Domingo, Paul Giamatti and Da'Vine Joy Randolph were among the honorees who fought back tears as they praised film's distinct ability to express what it means to be human.\n''The more I do this, the more I think acting may be a kind of teaching,'' Giamatti said as he accepted his award. ''It's how we learn how to be human. It's how we learn about our common humanity.''\nSandra Oh introduced her ''Sideways'' co-star, but Giamatti got back up on stage later in the evening to present the night's breakthrough award to Randolph, who stars alongside Giamatti in ''The Holdovers'' — his latest performance in an Alexander Payne flick.\nRandolph echoed her co-star's sentiment, saying cinema is a medium uniquely poised to ''illuminate the human condition.''\nDomingo, who was being recognized for his performance in ''Rustin,'' also became emotional as he shared with the room his understanding of his work.\n''Faith is what brought me here,'' he said. ''When we have faith in one another, what an extraordinary world we could build. To channel that humanity and let that speak of the complex experience is what I consider my service as an artist.''\nThis year's awards season comes on the heels of the summer's historic strikes and news that 2023 resulted in the best year-end box office seen since the pandemic.\n''You saved the movies last summer and all of our jobs,'' Streep said to recording artist Billie Eilish and her brother and collaborator, Finneas O'Connell — a reference to their song in the record-breaking box office blockbuster, ''Barbie.''\nThe pair accepted their own award for ''What Was I Made For,'' the final song and unofficial theme in the Greta Gerwig-directed film.\n''You've delivered joy to countless generations and genders of people. And you should surf that wave, kids,'' Streep said, before presenting Carey Mulligan's honor.\nThe night concluded with Martin Scorsese, DiCaprio, Lily Gladstone and a host of other stars from ''Killers of the Flower Moon'' accepting one of the night's top honors.\nWhile Scorsese conceded he has made a lot of movies, the acclaimed directed said this one stood out. ''It was an experience that I'll always treasure. One of the greatest times in my life,'' he said.",

    "text": "EINPresswire.com/ -- Making sure that every employee receives the prevailing wage on a government construction job may sound easy if the company has 2 or 3 employees. Add in 15 employees, 31 compliance issues, a variety of job titles for the same employee and flawless security regarding employee information, well, then a group of payroll people need to handle the job.\nOr… a web-based system that seamlessly, finds any\nDavis Baconcompliance issues and alerts the payroll manager about errors that could lead to jail time or heavy fines. That same system offers a 3-minute payroll. Would a huge savings of time and money compared to a manually prepared payroll be a smart choice for a construction company that does business with the government?\nA worry-free payroll system for\nconstruction companiesdoing business with the federal government is available.\nCompliant Client by eMars was created in 2001 to give construction company owners an easy, flawless, paperless way to be compliant with the Davis Bacon Act of 1931 that enforces a prevailing wage and 31 other compliance issues. This congressional act requires private contractors to be in compliance with each check paid to employees on all federally funded construction projects over $2,000.\nCompliant Client was designed with input from the Department of Labor and government contractors. Government auditors are given a portal to view the progress of every project. A real-time environment was created to block contractors from altering pay rates then submitting payroll.\nConstruction companies need this type of system to stay in compliance with the Davis Bacon Act.\nMany construction companies, however, prepare their payrolls manually. Humans make errors.\nCompliant Client by eMars is used by many construction companies.\nMore than 48,000+ users are handling projects in 45 states, Guam, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico use Compliant Client. This system processes between 2,000 and 3,000 payrolls a day. Some payrolls have thousands of workers. Other payrolls have as few as 15 employees.\nCompliant Client provides immediate, concurrent, real time visibility of all payroll records of the sub, prime, plus - the owner agency. All screens are printable via this paperless system. Every submitted payroll is audited, online and in real time. The results are instantaneous, allowing for immediate corrections.\nA typical payroll is prepared by 1 person in less than 3 minutes.\nCompliant Client requires a PC and about 30 minutes of training. Complete implementation takes less than 1 day. Users report an 80% productivity improvement over manual payrolls.\nCompliant Client also encrypts its at rest data.\n\"Security is tantamount\", says Woody Chamberlain, President of eMars/Compliant Client.\nMr. Chamberlain continued: “Users have a choice of 13 different security roles. Each role enables the user to perform defined processes.”\nEasily stay compliant with the Davis Bacon Act of 1931.\nEncrypted. Strong. Easy to use. Web based. Fairly priced.\nWoody Chamberlain\neMars / Compliant Client\n+1 480-595-0466\nemail us here",

    "title": "FDA Finds Popular Asthma Drug Impacts the Brain",
    "text": "Dan Levine and Sheila Dang Friday, 22 November 2024 07:23 AM EST\nU.S. government researchers have found that a widely prescribed asthma drug originally sold by Merck & Co may be linked to serious mental health problems for some patients, according to a scientific presentation reviewed by Reuters.\nThe researchers found that the drug, sold under the brand name Singulair and generically as montelukast, attaches to multiple brain receptors critical to psychiatric functioning.\nSingulair was a blockbuster product for Merck after its launch in 1998, offering relief in a pill as an alternative to an inhaler. In early advertising, the company said the side effects were so benign that they were \"similar to a sugar pill,\" while the label said any distribution in the brain was \"minimal.\" Generic versions are still prescribed to millions of adults and children every year.\nBut by 2019, thousands of reports of neuropsychiatric episodes, including dozens of suicides, in patients prescribed the drug had piled up on internet forums and in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s tracking system. Such “adverse event” reports do not prove a causal link between a medicine and a side effect, but are used by the FDA to determine whether more study of a drug’s risks are warranted.\nAfter years of analysis, the reports and new scientific research led the FDA in 2020 to add a \"black box\" warning to the montelukast prescribing label, flagging serious mental health risks like suicidal thinking or actions.\nThe agency also convened a group of internal experts around the same time to look into why the drug might trigger neuropsychiatric side effects.\nThe results of the group's work, which are preliminary and have not been previously reported or released publicly, were presented to a limited audience at the American College of Toxicology meeting in Austin, Texas on Wednesday.\nJessica Oliphant, a deputy director at FDA's National Center for Toxicological Research, said at the event that laboratory tests showed \"significant binding\" of montelukast to multiple receptors found in the brain.\nThe FDA also confirmed earlier scientific research showing montelukast penetrates the brains of rats. More study is needed about how the drug accumulates in the nervous system, Oliphant said. \"These data indicate that montelukast is highest in brain regions known to be involved in (psychiatric effects),” she said.\nThe FDA said it does not plan to update the drug label based on data from the presentation.\n'SOMETHING THAT'S CONCERNING'\nThe behavior of montelukast appears similar to other drugs known to have neuropsychiatric effects, such as the antipsychotic risperidone, according to FDA slides reviewed by Reuters. The FDA has cautioned that its studies are ongoing, and results have not been finalized.\nWhen the FDA added the black box, it cited research from Julia Marschallinger and Ludwig Aigner at Austria's Institute of Molecular Regenerative Medicine.\nThe two scientists told Reuters on Thursday the new data showed significant quantities of montelukast present in the brain. The receptors involved play a role in governing mood, impulse control, cognition and sleep, among other functions, they said.\nThe research does not show whether that binding mechanism leads directly to harmful effects in individual patients, or who is particularly at risk, the two scientists said. However, Marschallinger said the new data bolsters reports from people who reported suffering side effects.\n\"It's definitely doing something that's concerning,\" she said.\nA Merck representative did not respond to questions. Organon, a Merck spinoff that now markets Singulair, said in a statement it is confident in the drug's safety profile.\n\"The product label for Singulair contains appropriate information regarding Singulair benefits, risks and reported adverse reactions,\" the company said.\nReuters reported last year that the FDA had received thousands of reports of patients, including many children, experiencing depression, suicidal thoughts and behaviors, or other psychiatric problems after they began using montelukast.\nBy 2019, the FDA tallied 82 suicides linked to Singulair and its generic versions reported to its adverse-event database since 1998. At least 31 of those reports involved someone age 19 or younger.\nRobert England's 22-year old son Nick killed himself in 2017 less than two weeks after starting montelukast. England recalls that his son had trouble sleeping before he died, and said he was completely healthy and had no mental health problems prior to taking the drug.\n\"He was on that medication for just days, literally just days,\" England said. \"It completely changed the trajectory of our lives.\"\nThe Reuters report also detailed lawsuits alleging that Merck knew from its early research that the drug could impact the brain and minimized the potential for psychiatric problems in statements to regulators. Many of those lawsuits are still pending.\n© 2024 Thomson/Reuters.

    "text": "Bromley’s Envirocrime team are leaving no stone unturned in their efforts to bring a halt to rogue traders and others committing offences in the Borough.\nEnvironmental Investigation Manager Dean Laws and his Neighbourhood Investigation Officers are responsible for helping ensure the Borough achieves its corporate objectives in being as clean, green, and safe as possible. This includes keeping roads and footpaths free from hazard or obstruction and helping combat crime that damages our environment, such as fly-tipping and graffiti.\nThe team responds to all reported complaints as well as carrying out routine inspections across the Borough, including known hotspot areas. Included in their responsibilities, the team have power to enforce under numerous current legislations, foremost amongst them being the Environmental Protection Act 1990, which can result in the issuing of warnings, notices, fixed penalty notices, and even court proceedings against alleged offenders.\nOver the past year no fewer than 88 fixed penalty notices have been issued for littering, fly-tipping and duty of care for waste with 83 Community Protection Warnings, as well as other warnings and 22 successful prosecutions. Eight vehicles used in illegal fly-tipping have been being seized to prevent further use in this way.\nCouncillor Angela Page, Executive Councillor for Public Protection and Enforcement says “We are grateful to Dean and his team for his continued work to tackle envirocrime which could blight our Borough otherwise. Our Public Protection and Enforcement team do an exemplary job, but we know we can do so much more with the help of our residents and local businesses. Coming together as a community is important in fulfilling our mission to keep Bromley green and clean. We are really grateful to everyone who helps us with that goal.”\nResidents and visitors to the Borough are encouraged to report fly-tipping if they come across it, by visiting\nwww.bromley.gov.uk/report. The Council’s Enviro-crime reward scheme provides for up to a £500 reward where information comes forward leading to a successful prosecution.\nENDS\nNotes to editors:\n- Since September 2022, Dean and his team have investigated numerous offences in the borough, using all resources at their disposal to prevent, locate, examine, and identify all instances of illegal actions that affect everyone living and working in the borough. Their work so far had resulted in:\n- 88 Fixed Penalty notices\n- 43 Litter served for Low Level Fly-tipping\n- 24 Duty of Care for waste\n- 21 Fly-Tipping\n- 22 Successful Prosecutions\n- 83 Community Protection Warnings\n- 13 Verbal warnings\n- 15 Warning letters\n- 14 Formal Notices\n- 8 Vehicle Seizures\n- 4 Simple Caution\n- 1 Criminal Behaviour Order\n- Areas that the Envirocrime Team can take enforcement action on, amongst others, include:\n- Abandoned vehicles,\n- Dog Fouling and Dog Control orders,\n- Fly-tipping,\n- Highway obstruction,\n- Littering,\n- Overhanging vegetation,\n- Unlicensed skips, hoarding & scaffolding,\n- Untaxed vehicles.\n- A Fixed Penalty Notice offers an offender the opportunity to avoid prosecution by paying a fixed penalty.\n- Visit\nwww.bromley.gov.uk/Prosecutionsfor further information about prosecutions and enforcement work carried out by the Council.\nFor media enquiries, please contact Justin Brown, Public Affairs Officer, on\n020 8461 7872 or email",

    "text": "PlayStation Plus : Les jeux PS4 quitteront l’offre dès l’année prochaine\nClap de fin pour les jeux PS4 dans le PlayStation Plus !\nLe voile vient tout juste de se lever sur le programme qui\nattend les abonnés du PlayStation Plus avec\nune nouvelle fournée de jeux « gratuits » prévue pour le mois de\nfévrier. Et c’est justement par le biais de\nson billet sur le blog officiel que Sony en profite pour faire\nune autre annonce concernant l’avenir de l’abonnement. Un\nchangement à venir qui va sans doute faire grincer quelques dents,\net notamment celles des joueurs ne disposant pas encore de PS5…\nEn effet, à compter du mois de janvier 2026, les jeux PS4 tireront peu à peu leur révérence pour donner la priorité aux titres sur PS5.\nComme une grande majorité de nos joueurs possèdent une PS5 et préfèrent naturellement la version PS5 des jeux du mois et du Catalogue des jeux, nous avons décidé de faire évoluer l’abonnement PlayStation Plus dans ce sens et comptons désormais nous concentrer sur les jeux PS5 dans le cadre des jeux du mois et du Catalogue des jeux dès janvier 2026.\nToutefois, Sony précise tout de même que certains jeux PS4 figureront au programme « de manière occasionnelle » ou s'ils sont « jouables à la fois sur PS4 et PS5 ». La firme japonaise tient également à ajouter que ce changement n’aura « aucune incidence sur les jeux du mois sur PS4 déjà obtenus avec le PlayStation Plus », du moins tant que l’abonnement reste actif bien sûr.\nCap vers la sixième génération ?\nA vrai dire, il flotte un petit air de déjà-vu… Et pour cause, il suffit de faire un petit saut dans le passé, plus précisément en 2019, pour apprendre que les jeux mensuels « offerts » aux abonnés du PlayStation Plus n’incluraient plus de jeux PS3 ou PS Vita. Une décision qui marquait le début de la fin d’une troisième génération sortie en 2006 pour laisser place au futur…\nAujourd’hui, l’histoire ne fait que se répéter, à l’heure où la PS5 entame déjà sa sixième année d’existence, et Sony ayant peut-être déjà les yeux rivés sur la prochaine génération. Seul l’avenir nous le dira… En attendant, le compte à rebours est lancé, laissant ainsi le temps aux joueurs PS4 de franchir le pas s’ils le souhaitent. D’autant plus que certains titres très attendus tels qu’Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Ghost of Yotei, sans oublier GTA 6, délaisseront la PS4 pour débarquer sur PS5, non sans penser au passage qu’une page est probablement bel et bien sur le point de se tourner…\nCommentaires\nAnnuler la réponse.",

    "text": "BRUXELLES - \\\"È importante che la consegna degli aiuti militari sia più rapida. Noi attendiamo sviluppi positivi da parte dei nostri partner. Sappiamo cosa possono offrire i nostri partner. Ma più veloce sarà l'invio di aiuti militari più potremo stabilizzare\\\" l'Ucraina. Lo ha detto il presidente ucraino Volodymyr Zelensky in conferenza stampa con il segretario generale della Nato Jens Stoltenberg.\\\"Stiamo lavorando nella Nato perché gli Alleati inviino più sistema di difesa aerea. Oggi l'Australia ha annunciato che fornirà 4 sistema di difesa aerea per il corto raggio. Noi ci stiamo concentrando sui Patriot e sulle munizioni\\\", ha spiegato da parte sua Stoltenberg che con Zelensky ha parlato anche della proposta di un fondo da 100 miliardi per l'Ucraina di cui nell'Alleanza Atlantica si è cominciato a parlare.\\\"È importante che gli aiuti siano rapidi, ogni giorno è importante\\\", ha aggiunto Stoltenberg ricordando le importanti decisioni prese nei giorni scorsi dagli Usa e dalla Gran Bretagna nel sostegno a Kiev. \\\"Se non consegniamo quanto dobbiamo ci saranno conseguenze per l'Ucraina ma anche per noi. Il rischio più grande è che il presidente Putin prevalga. Sostenere l'Ucraina è un fatto che riguarda la nostra sicurezza\\\", ha sottolineato Stoltenberg.",

    "text": "Durante esse período, as leis estaduais que regem o tema continuarão em vigor. Passado esse prazo, caberá ao Supremo adotar medidas para sanar a omissão. Venceu o voto do relator, o ministro André Mendonça, a favor da ação proposta pela Procuradoria-Geral da República. Ele entendeu que a Constituição exige uma lei específica que trate sobre a proteção ao Pantanal e foi seguido pelos ministros Flávio Dino, Kassio Nunes Marques, Edson Fachin, Dias Toffoli, Luiz Fux, Cármen Lúcia, Gilmar Mendes e Luís Roberto Barroso. Ao votar, Barroso destacou a \"crescente degradação ao pantanal\" e lembrou que, em 2020, incêndios devastaram mais de 4 milhões de hectares do bioma. Os ministros Cristiano Zanin e Alexandre de Moraes divergiram. Para eles, o Código Florestal e as leis estaduais do Mato Grosso e do Mato Grosso do Sul já são suficientes. Para a Confederação da Agricultura e Pecuária (CNA), amicus curie no processo, não há omissão legislativa porque o Brasil já aprovou o Código Florestal. \"Uma eventual decisão do STF no sentido de afastar a incidência do Código Florestal - reconhecendo uma mora legislativa no tema - seria dramática a várias cadeias produtivas da agropecuária, o que, de imediato, levaria à miséria os pequenos produtores rurais que delas participam\", afirmou a CNA em manifestação à Corte.",

    "text": "2200 personas trabajadoras de la empresa ISGF en España, de las que 950 trabajan en la Región de Murcia, están hoy llamadas a la huelga. Según la Federación de Servicios de CCOO Región de Murcia un 80% de los trabajadores y trabajadoras han secundado la convocatoria que exige una mejora de sus precarias condiciones laborales. La segunda jornada de huelga en la empresa de atención telefónica ISGF con sedes en Murcia, Alicante y Madrid se salda con un seguimiento de más del 80%. La empresa, que da servicio a multinacionales tales como Orange, Iberdrola, y bancos como el Santander, cuneta con una plantilla de 2.200 personas en España, de las cuales 950 operan desde sus instalaciones en la Región de Murcia. La secretaria de la Federación de Servicios de CCOO en la Región de Murcia, Teresa Fuentes, no entiende la negativa de la empresa a sentarse a negociar \"se trata de cuestiones muy básicas como es el reconocimiento de la antigüedad laboral o la categoría profesional por eso no comprendemos por qué los representantes de la empresa no se avienen a razones. La cerrazón llega hasta el punto de que nos hemos visto obligadas a pedir mediación en la OMAL hasta para la convocatoria de estas movilizaciones y el propio órgano de mediación señaló la falta de empatía de la empresa hacia su plantilla en el escrito de mediación\". Las trabajadoras y trabajadores han desarrollado un manifiesto que recoge sus exigencias hacia la empresa y que busca poner fin a la vulneración de derechos, la precariedad laboral y el insostenible aumento de presiones psicosociales que afectan de manera directa en la salud del personal. En palabras del Responsable de Contact Center de la Federación de Servicios de CCOO Región de Murcia, Salvador Espín, \"Nadie quiere ir a la huelga, de hecho hay que recordar que las personas trabajadoras perdemos el salario completo del día de huelga pero es que no podemos más. Ya no es la precariedad salarial o la conciliación, a la que tenemos derecho, es una cuestión de humanidad. Entre nuestras reclamaciones se encuentra, por ejemplo, tener la pausa mínima de 23 segundos entre llamada y llamada algo vital porque el 95% de las bajas médicas de la empresa se dan por enfermedad mental y actualmente ya nos encontramos en un 30% de bajas superando, en más del doble la media nacional\". La Federación de Servicios de CCOO en la Región de Murcia advierte que de mantenerse la postura de la empresa continuará con el calendario de movilizaciones el próximo viernes 4 de octubre.",
