    "title": "Steel job cuts: Port Talbot needs years of support - councillor",
    "text": "A \"period of great uncertainty and anxiety” looms over Port Talbot ahead of mass job cuts at its steelworks next month, says a senior community leader.\nWith owner Tata Steel due to close its second blast furnace within weeks, deputy council leader Alun Llewelyn said Neath Port Talbot's focus was \"to try and give as much help\" to those affected.\nThe UK government announced an initial £13.5m would be made available immediately to support businesses and workers, but Mr Llewelyn called for \"decades\" of aid.\nTata, which said it was losing £1m a day at the site, recognised the \"uncertainty that workers are feeling\", but it had set up a \"wide range of employee support mechanisms\".\nPort Talbot steelworks set for massive job losses Tata Steel starts voluntary redundancy process Labour working on better Tata steel deal, says MP Tata Steel closed the first blast furnace in July, and plans to shut the second by the end of September.\nAdam Williams, who has worked at the steelworks for 18 years, opted to start his own window cleaning business in preparation.\n“I decided to take matters into my own hands, rather than living in this vicious circle of being told I could lose my job,\" he said.\n“It really hasn’t hit home yet that it is coming to an end after 18 years, it’s going to be emotional when I finally get my finishing date, but at least I can see the next chapter.”\nAdam Williams is working two jobs as he prepares for the future He described the workers' mood as sombre: “We still haven’t had firm answers yet about what’s happening, but then again it hasn’t been agreed with unions yet, so you do understand it in that way. It’s just frustrating.”\nWhen he found out in January he would be losing his job, he said “it was a worrying time”, and a lot of other jobs did not pay as much.\n“I haven’t got many qualifications so I just wanted to see what I could do for myself.”\nAfter seeing a friend running a successful window cleaning business, Adam who is originally from Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, and now lives in Skewen, close to Port Talbot, saw an opportunity to do the same.\nHe now often finishes a 12-hour steel shift, has a nap, and starts his other job.\n“It is a lot. But the support has been fantastic. I’m booked up right until October, so it’s great.”\nAlun Llewelyn says the council is aware the area might possibly lose skilled workers Councillor Alun Llewelyn said the council had been working with the transition board set up by the UK government to “ensure a way forward to create new employment and an economic future for Port Talbot”.\nHe said an information hub will opening at Aberafan shopping centre to help workers and companies in the supply chain.\nBut he called for continuing support from both the UK and Welsh governments “in order to replace the gap that’s being left by the jobs”.\n“We’re very conscious that we could be losing skilled workers from the area,\" he said.\n“We want to give as many people as possible the opportunity to stay in the area, to obtain new work, to obtain new skills,” he added.\nWelsh Secretary Jo Stevens said: \"There are things happening here and now, and there will be things happening in the longer term.\n\"This is a government that has economic growth and clean energy by 2030 at the heart of its missions, and I believe Port Talbot can play a big role in that.\"\nThe facts and figures behind the UK's steel industry Analysis By Felicity Evans, BBC Wales money editor\nBefore the general election in July, when UK Labour was still in opposition, it was very critical of the then Conservative government’s approach to Tata’s plans for Port Talbot.\nThat Tory previous government had agreed to give the company £500m towards the building of a greener electric arc furnace.\nAnd, along with Tata, it decided to create a £100m transition fund to help workers and the wider community cope with the fallout from the thousands of job losses that would result from the closure of the blast furnaces.\nLabour promised a new approach and on taking power said it was in negotiations with the company and there was “a better deal available”.\nWell, the clock is ticking: only one blast furnace remains operational at Port Talbot and it is still scheduled to close in September.\nSir Keir Starmer's government is starting to spend the transition fund announced by its predecessor, but right now its game plan doesn’t seem much different.\nHow has Port Talbot's steelworks changed over the years? Many players at Aberavon Harlequins, one of several rugby clubs in the town, are worried about the impact of the job cuts on the area.\nAbout 2,000 jobs are expected to go by the end of next month, along with many more contractor and supply chain roles.\nThomas Morley, 30, called it \"gutting for the community”.\nHe said: “I’m the third generation of my family to have worked there, my grandpa was there, my father was there, and I was offered a job there by luck.”\nHe worked at the plant for three years, before leaving to find another job in IT, and said the “lack of communication” from the company caused the most concern for many of his friends still there.\n“What’s happened has been flung on the town and nothing has really been said since.\n“We need to see that they care and there are plans in place, otherwise the investment in the town is going to collapse.”\nMorgan Evans says the uncertainty around roles is affecting his family Morgan Evans, 24, said “half” of his family worked in the steelworks, and “the stress is affecting everyone involved”.\nHe said: “I’ve lived here all my life, and every day I look over to the steelworks, it’s part of the identity of the town.\n“My father, auntie, uncle, multiple cousins, one of my best friends, all work there.\n“It’s such an uncertain time for everyone, the stress is affecting not just the workers but their families too.”\nThe Welsh government said it had \"worked closely with Tata Steel, unions, the supply chain and local partners for well over a decade\", and \"made no secret about our concerns regarding the timeframe around the transition, and are under no illusions about the impact it will have for so many, particularly in and around Port Talbot\".\nIt said that working with the UK government and others it was \"reinforcing that commitment to ensure that the Tata workforce, its supply chain and local communities are supported not only in the short term but long into the future\".\nTata Steel said: “We very much recognise the uncertainty that workers are feeling as we restructure our business in order to stem losses of £1million a day”.\nIt added it had a wide range of employee support programmes available including a mental health hub, and the company is helping employees \"become accredited with formal qualifications”.\nThe spokesperson added work on its voluntary redundancy programme was ongoing.",

    "text": "Walmart recalls magnetic balls after CPSC warns of choking and injury hazards By Ramishah Maruf, CNN New York (CNN) — Regulators have issued a recall for high-powered magnetic balls after the US Consumer Product Safety Commission [ issued several warnings](https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/business/magnetic-ball-recall-warning/index.html) for the toy kits, citing the risk of injury or even death. Walmart recalled the “Relax 5mm Science Kit, Large Hematite Magnets Magnetic Stones Building Blocks,” sold exclusively on the site through Joybuy. Earlier in December, CPSC said these magnets, often marketed for children, are small enough to fit into the CPSC’s [small parts cylinder](https://www.cpsc.gov/Business--Manufacturing/Business-Education/Business-Guidance/Small-Parts-for-Toys-and-Childrens-Products) (which simulates the width of a child’s throat), and are also magnetically stronger than permitted. If swallowed, the high-powered magnets can attract to each other or to other metals inside the digestive system, leading to “perforations, twisting and/or blockage of the intestines, infection, blood poisoning and death.” The agency broadly estimated 2,500 emergency room visits over magnet ingestions from 2017-2021 and seven deaths, two of which were outside of the United States. The recall affects about 4,240 units. [The CPSC said](https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2024/High-Powered-Magnetic-Balls-Recalled-Due-to-Ingestion-Hazard-Sold-Exclusively-on-Walmart-com-through-Joybuy) customers should take away the balls from children immediately and contact Joybuy for a pre-paid label to return the recalled products for a full refund. The toy kit was sold from February 2022 through April 2023 for between $14 and $15 and is made of small magnetic balls in purple, black, green, blue, orange and red.

[In another encounter](https://scoop.upworthy.com/mailman-family-invites-mailman-to-thanksgiving-dinner-after-his-heroic-act-saved-their-loved-ones-life), a mailman saved an elderly man from major injuries and earned him a new buddy. It was just another day for Guy Miller, who was out on a walk with his dog Bentley. While on the walk, he slipped and fell on the road, injuring himself. Miller, a resident of Aurora, Chicago, was thankfully seen by United States Postal Service worker Jaylen Lockhart, who, without any second thoughts, jumped to help him.\nHe rushed Miller to a nearby hospital. The worker later told reporters that he had spotted Miller, who took a tumble in his rearview mirror while driving his truck in the neighborhood. He[ immediately called 911](https://scoop.upworthy.com/a-little-boy-called-911-with-an-urgent-message-the-police-showed-up-to-the-cutest-surprise-ex1) and ensured that Miller's wife, Marcia, was informed about the incident. \"I wasn't sure exactly what I was getting myself into.

Later, to thank him, the Millers invited Lockhart to join their family feast on Thanksgiving. \"I said, 'What are you doing for Thanksgiving? Do you have a family?' We said, 'We're family, definitely,'\" Marcia shared with NBC Chicago, adding that it was great to see his kindness, compassion and care for the world.",

    "text": "Presidente da Guatemala classifica de 'fraude' reeleição de Maduro 22/08/2024 21h41\nO presidente da Guatemala, Bernardo Arévalo, afirmou nesta quinta-feira (22) que o governo de Nicolás Maduro \"não é democrático\" e, portanto, não reconhece sua reeleição validada pela Suprema Corte da Venezuela.\n\"A crise na Venezuela é inegável, e desde a Guatemala já dissemos que suas recentes eleições são apenas uma demonstração disso: o regime de Maduro não é democrático e não reconhecemos sua fraude\", disse o presidente social-democrata na rede social X, referindo-se aos resultados das eleições.\nArévalo acrescentou que \"os povos de todo o nosso continente\" devem \"exigir uma saída pacífica\" para a crise, \"que garanta a vontade do povo e recupere o país para todos os venezuelanos\".\nO Tribunal Supremo de Justiça (TSJ) validou o resultado das eleições de 28 de julho, nas quais o Conselho Nacional Eleitoral (CNE) proclamou Maduro vencedor com 52% dos votos. Não cabe recurso.\nA oposição, que classificou a decisão como \"nula\", afirma ter vencido as eleições e acusa tanto o TSJ quanto o CNE de servir ao chavismo.\nA Guatemala é um dos países que questionaram a transparência das eleições na Venezuela, mas não reconheceu o opositor Edmundo González Urrutia como vencedor, ao contrário de outros países da região, como Argentina, Equador, Peru, Uruguai, Costa Rica e Panamá.\n\"Nossa solidariedade com o povo irmão da Venezuela, que luta por sua liberdade e democracia\", acrescentou Arévalo.\nhma/fj/dga/am\n© Agence France-Presse",

    "title": "Ardhnarishwar – Sadhguru Explains The Importance Of Shiva’s Avatar To Bring A Sense Of Balance In Life | Times Now",
    "text": "Many yogis and gurus have preached the importance of having a sense of balance in life for centuries. Be it any aspect of life, when you find that balance and know how to control it, you will become a complete being. Well, it is not easy to attain this balance and mystical Guru Sadhguru explained through a beautiful story as how Shiva made one of his disciples understand the importance of balancing the masculine and feminine energies in yourself. Story Of Shiva’s Ardhnarishwar Avatar Shiva's journey as a teacher began with his first seven students, known as the Saptarishis. Among his followers was Brighu, a sage deeply devoted to Shiva. Brighu's devotion made him very gentle and feminine, as devotion is often seen as a feminine quality. Every day, the sage would walk around Shiva three times, a ritual he never skipped. Parvati, Shiva's wife, often sat next to him during these rituals. However, Brighu only focused on Shiva, ignoring Parvati. This upset Parvati, so one day she sat closer to Shiva, making it hard for Brighu to walk around only Shiva without acknowledging her. When Brighu arrived, he asked Parvati to move. In his deep devotion, he wanted to walk around only Shiva. Parvati refused. Determined, Brighu turned into a mouse to get around just Shiva, ignoring Parvati. Shiva found this amusing and pulled Parvati onto his lap, making it impossible for Brighu to continue his ritual without including Parvati. Brighu then turned into a bird, still trying to circle only Shiva. Amused, Shiva decided to merge with Parvati, creating Ardhnarishwar – a form that is half Shiva and half Parvati. This symbolised the unity of masculine and feminine energies. Even after the transformation, Brighu continued to show his devotion by turning into a bee and circling only Shiva’s right leg. Shiva and Parvati laughed at his determination but realised he needed guidance. Shiva took a yogic posture, making it impossible for Brighu to circle just one part. He had to honour both the masculine and feminine aspects. Shiva’s actions taught an important lesson: true devotion and spiritual practice must include both masculine and feminine energies. This balance is essential for complete personal growth. Brighu’s story shows the importance of recognising and nurturing both aspects within oneself. The story also highlights the essence of Ardhnarishwar. It teaches that to fully understand yoga, one must balance both masculine and feminine energies. Sadhguru emphasises that yoga is about integrating all parts of oneself. The story of Ardhnarishwar reminds us of the importance of balance in life. By embracing both masculine and feminine energies, we can achieve completeness and harmony, which is the ultimate goal of yoga – the union of all aspects of ourselves and the universe.

    "text": "25 years ago, writer Liz Calvario's family attended the Backstreet Boys Millennium concert. In a full circle moment, they went to the anniversary show and celebrated the loss of her mother. 25 YEARS AGO, my family created a lifelong connection with the Backstreet Boys. It might sound...unique for not just two fangirls, but also their parents, to be devoted to a boyband. But for our foursome, BSB has been the soundtrack to a shared life of love...and unexpected loss.\nThe connection reached a full-circle moment this year when the group announced on TODAY their \"Into the Millennium\" Sphere residency in Las Vegas. It was a celebration of the 25-year anniversary of their hit album — but for my family, it was a reminder of a time that changed everything for us.\nIt all began when I was about eight years old and my sister Leslie and I walked into Lucky's grocery store. She ran straight to the magazine section; four years older than me, she had recently discovered the Backstreet Boys and wanted to show me her favorite member, Nick Carter.\nGrabbing one of the bright teen magazines, my eyes went instead to dark-haired, green-eyed Kevin Richardson. From there, while my mom grocery shopped, our ritual became standing in that aisle, flipping the pages to every Backstreet Boys photo we could find.\nOur infatuation only grew as the years went by. We consumed every bit of information about all five \"boys,\" belted their songs on the radio and religiously watched \"Total Request Live\" with Carson Daly on MTV. (My cheeks turned hot as I watched the rain scene in \"Quit Playing Games With My Heart.\")\nKnowing how much we loved them, my mom often gave in to purchasing the BSB merch we saw at the mall and stores. When we begged to call \"TRL\" countless times, she always indulged us. And when we were in the car yelling every single lyric to every single song? She was right there singing along with us.\nBy 1999, BSB was embarking on their \"Into the Millennium Tour,\" to accompany their sophomore album, \"Millennium.\" Desperate to see them in concert, Leslie and I begged our parents to let us go. By this time, our bedroom was covered in floor-to-ceiling posters; while my dad…\nLiz Calvario",

Es decir, logró 800 puntos de 800 posibles.\nLa joven, oriunda de Palmares, estudiará\n[Ingeniería en Biotecnología](https://www.tec.ac.cr/ingenieria-biotecnologia), porque le gusta la medicina y la tecnología. “Siempre he sabido que quiero ayudar a los demás, esa es mi meta, poder poner mis capacidades al servicio de las personas”.\nGutiérrez asegura que no se esperaba ser el mejor puntaje, pero lo anhelaba y se preparó para poder lograrlo y se siente muy feliz por el resultado.\n“Desde niña admiré a las personas que obtenían una nota de 800 puntos y dije: voy a luchar por esa nota, e incluso, una profesora del colegio me dijo: usted se va pegar un 800 en ese examen”, comentó Gutiérrez.\nLa joven agregó que cuando comenzó a realizar las prácticas notó que no eran muy sencillas, sin embargo, siguió estudiando.\n“El día del examen me sentí tranquila, sentí que me había ido bien, pero jamás pensé obtener la nota perfecta, aunque era mi sueño. Cuando vi los resultados me sorprendí y quería llorar de la felicidad al ver mi nota y me siento muy orgullosa de saber que soy capaz y que se me cumplió lo que anhelé”, destacó Fiorella.\nMejor puntaje\nEntre los 30 mejores promedios del Proceso de Admisión 2024 - 2025, 17 estudiantes provienen de colegios públicos 12 de colegios privados y 1 de semipúblico.\nAdemás del reconocimiento, cada uno de estos jóvenes obtendrá una beca del 100% para realizar sus estudios.\nEl anuncio oficial se llevó a cabo en el auditorio del Centro de las Artes, del Campus Cartago, el jueves 5 de diciembre.\nEste año se inscribieron 21.540 estudiantes para hacer el examen de admisión, pero solo 17.671 realizaron la prueba. Entre esas personas, 8.294 obtuvieron una nota mayor o igual a la nota de corte institucional que es de 520 puntos.\nPara la rectora del Tecnológico de Costa Rica, la Ing. María Estrada Sánchez, los resultados alcanzados por todos estos jóvenes son producto del empeño y tiempo que han invertido durante sus años de estudio, así como la confianza que han tenido en sus capacidades y la determinación que pusieron en alcanzar una meta tan ambiciosa como lo es ingresar a nuestra institución.\n\"Cada uno de ustedes representa la excelencia académica que nos caracteriza como institución, por lo que sus resultados nos llenan de entusiasmo y orgullo. De parte de la institución, sus distintas oficinas y departamentos les damos la bienvenida. Sepan que cuentan con nuestro apoyo y acompañamiento en todos los procesos que lleven a cabo en el TEC, que la comodidad y seguridad sean parte de cada acción que realicen\".Ing. María Estrada Sánchez, rectora del TEC.\nEstrada invitó a cada estudiante a continuar con esa actitud, compromiso y dedicación. Que sean las y los líderes del futuro que requiere el país. También mencionó que desea que sigan siendo un ejemplo a seguir para el resto de estudiantes y el país.\nFamilia TEC\nPara Fiorella es un honor y un orgullo poder ingresar al TEC, porque es una universidad muy prestigiosa y le encanta el enfoque de las ciencias y la tecnología, además de que le da la oportunidad de crecer.\n“Mi papá es graduado del TEC y desde niña lo admiraba porque se graduó de una universidad de alto calibre y el saber que voy por el mismo camino que mi papá me hace muy feliz”, aseveró Gutiérrez.\nSegún la joven, su familia se siente muy orgullosa de que ella obtuviera el mejor puntaje de admisión al TEC para ingresar a la Institución en 2025.\n“Mi hija es la mayor de cuatro hermanos, es muy decidida y desde pequeña ha sido muy aplicada en el estudio. Aprendió a leer a los cuatro años, en la primaria y secundaria siempre fue cuadro de honor; mi hija cada día nos sorprende más”, expresó Adriana Rojas Araya, madre de Fiorella.\nPara Fabián Gutiérrez Montoya, padre de Fiorella, su hija es muy especial, ya que siempre está dispuesta a ayudar al que necesite.\n“Fio es una bendición en nuestra familia, recuerdo que en la escuela siempre le ayudaba a sus compañeritos si no entendían algún tema, siempre fue muy responsable con las entregas de tareas y el estudio siempre ha sido su prioridad. Sus pasatiempos preferidos son leer y practicar gimnasia, realmente estoy muy orgulloso de ella”, recalcó Gutiérrez.\nSegundo y tercer puesto\nEl segundo lugar lo obtuvo Felipe Rojas Barquero, del Colegio Yorkin, quien también recibió un reconocimiento por la nota alcanzada de 795,43 puntos. Su deseo es estudiar\n[Ingeniería Mecatrónica](https://www.tec.ac.cr/planes-estudio/licenciatura-ingenieria-mecatronica).\n“Me encanta Ingeniería Mecatrónica, porque es una carrera que integra distintas áreas de la tecnología y utiliza herramientas e ideas existentes para crear soluciones innovadoras”, acotó Rojas.\nEl joven añadió que a su criterio el TEC es una universidad que ofrece el entorno y la capacitación para desarrollarse satisfactoriamente en el ámbito tecnológico, cumpliendo con los requerimientos de la sociedad moderna.\nEl tercer lugar fue para Alejandro Fallas Retana, del Colegio Miravalle Bilingüe, con una nota de 791,27. Él eligió la carrera de\n[Ingeniería en Mantenimiento Industrial](https://www.tec.ac.cr/mantenimiento-industrial).\n“Seleccioné Ingeniería en Mantenimiento Industrial ya que es una carrera amplia que brinda variedad de opciones a la hora de especializarse o enfocarse en un área específica, aparte de esto, lo que realmente me llevó a tomar la decisión de elegirla es mi interés en la aeronáutica, si bien a nivel nacional no se ofrecen carreras en este ámbito, mantenimiento industrial me permite a la hora de graduarme buscar opciones de posgrado y especialización en dicha área, lo que finalmente me termina funcionando como un puente no solo para seguir mi objetivo de enfocarme en la aeronáutica sino también permitiéndome explorar otros enfoques en el proceso”, destacó Fallas.\nPara Fallas, el TEC es mucho más que una simple universidad: “el TEC siempre lo he apreciado como una institución que prepara verdaderamente para el futuro, enseñando carreras y preparando profesionales para los verdaderos desafíos de la actualidad y el futuro de nuestro país. Si tuviera que definir en tres palabras lo que representa para mí el TEC, serían innovación, transformación y desarrollo”.\nEstudiante de Liceo Rural\nCabe destacar que este año, también se le reconoció entre los 30 mejores puntajes a Johana Jiménez Mata, quien es estudiante del Liceo Rural IDA San Luis en Dos Ríos de Upala.\nJiménez, quien es oriunda de Liberia, Guanacaste, está en el puesto número 13 y desea estudiar\n[Ingeniería en Computación](https://www.tec.ac.cr/ingenieria-computacion), porque le gusta las matemáticas y considera que esa carrera se acerca a sus aspiraciones a futuro, ya que su sueño es viajar y poder laborar de manera remota.\n“Para mí ser estudiante de un colegio rural es muy valioso, porque al ser un colegio pequeño la atención es más personalizada, conté con capacitaciones de mis profesores de español y de matemáticas, lo que me ayudó a ganar el curso lectivo y el examen de admisión al TEC”, recalcó Jiménez.\nLa actividad de los mejores 30 puntajes fue organizada por la\n[Vicerrectoría de Vida Estudiantil y Servicios Académicos](https://www.tec.ac.cr/unidades/vicerrectoria-vida-estudiantil-servicios-academicos#:~:text=La%20Vicerrector%C3%ADa%20de%20Vida%20Estudiantil%20y%20Servicios%20Acad%C3%A9micos%20promueve%20la,vinculaci%C3%B3n%20social%20y%20una%20perspectiva), a través del [Departamento de Orientación y Psicología. ](/hoyeneltec/2022/11/25/joven-amante-programacion-obtiene-maximo-puntaje-admision-tec-2023)\nImágenes del Acto de Reconocimiento de Mejores Puntajes de Admisión\nFotografías: Melissa Fernández.",

    "title": "Biden approves disaster declaration, freeing up resources in battle against deadly New Mexico fires",
    "text": "President Joe Biden on Thursday issued a disaster declaration for parts of southern New Mexico, freeing up funding and more resources as crews worked, under the threat of flooding and lightning, to battle a pair of deadly wildfires that have destroyed hundreds of homes and forced thousands of people to flee.\nThe declaration will help with recovery efforts including temporary housing, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property and other emergency work in Lincoln County and on lands belonging to the Mescalero Apache Tribe.\nResidents of Ruidoso, a mountain village, fled the larger fire with little notice as it swept into neighborhoods on Monday. More areas were evacuated on Tuesday as the fire ballooned, consuming homes nestled among the the ponderosa pines that dominate the hillsides.\nThe flames advanced Thursday along the mountain headwaters of Eagle Creek and the Rio Ruidoso with 0% containment. Crews used heavy equipment to build fire lines while water and retardant dropped from the air.\n“The big concern right now is flooding,” Ruidoso Mayor Lynn Crawford told the KWMW “W105” radio on Thursday.\n“We got less than two-tenths of an inch of rain yesterday but because of all the burn scar, there’s nothing holding it up. We had flooding already over the bridges.”\nAn estimated 1,400 structures have been destroyed or damaged, and Crawford estimated about half were homes.\nWhole portions of some communities were lost, he said. “These are things that are burnt to the foundations and all the trees around it,” he said. “It’s devastating.”\nThe rain helped to keep the fire from spreading and high humidity levels and cooler temperatures were expected to help keep the flames in check again Thursday, said Brandon Glenn, with the incident management team that is assigned to the fires.\nHundreds of firefighters have been trying to prevent spot fires, while others are assessing roads and trying to get around to structures and contain pockets of unburned fuel that might flare up.\n“It’s a lot of work just getting folks in,” Glenn said during a briefing. Authorities say a badly burned 60-year-old man who died was found near the popular Swiss Chalet Inn in Ruidoso.\nHis family said he had arranged for a ride from friends but they were unable to get to him Monday since the roads were blocked. It appeared he was overcome after he tried to set out on foot.\nOn Wednesday, officers discovered the skeletal remains of an unidentified second person in the driver seat of a burned vehicle.\nA couple of residents spent Thursday driving around Ruidoso and neighboring Alto, providing reports via social media of what they were seeing.\nThere were neighborhoods where the ground was turned to ash, the trees were blackened and homes were reduced to their foundations, with only fireplaces remaining.\n“I am speechless. I'm so sorry everyone,” said Logan Fle, as he drove down one road. Other homes were still standing, police officers were patrolling and utility crews were working in some areas.\nMuch of the Southwest has been exceedingly dry and hot in recent months. Those conditions, along with strong wind, whipped the flames out of control, rapidly advancing the South Fork Fire into Ruidoso in a matter of hours.\nEvacuations extended to hundreds of homes, businesses, a regional medical center and the Ruidoso Downs horse track.\nNationwide, wildfires have scorched more than 3,344 square miles (8,660 square kilometers) this year — a figure higher than the 10-year average, according to the National Interagency Fire Center.\nNearly 20 wildfires burning in California, Arizona, Colorado and Washington state and elsewhere are considered large and uncontained.\nThe two southern New Mexico wildfires have consumed more than 36 square miles (94 square kilometers). The cause of the fires is under investigation. “This is the one that we always feared the most, and it's hit,” Crawford said.",
