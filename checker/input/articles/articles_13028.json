    "title": "Rep. Pat Ryan calls Trump 'FUBAR' on DNC's final night: Watch",
    "text": "Rep. Pat Ryan of New York joined the lineup of speakers at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday, marking the final evening of a whirlwind four-day event that saw Vice President Kamala Harris accepting her party&#039;s nomination for president. Ryan, a 42-year-old Iraq War veteran, represents New York&#039;s 18th Congressional District. During his speech at the DNC, he touched on his military service and told the crowd that Harris is the right choice for president because she will support military veterans and troops. Rep. Pat Ryan (N.Y.) speaks during the final day of the Democratic National Convention at the United Center. &quot;I&#039;ll tell you what I think of [former President Donald Trump], they told me I can&#039;t say that word on TV, I&#039;m going to use an Army term: FUBAR,&quot; Ryan said. Start the day smarter. Get all the news you need in your inbox each morning. What to know about Rep. Pat Ryan Who is he: Despite being seen as the underdog, Rep. Pat Ryan won a congressional seat in the 19th district through a special election in November 2022. After a redistricting process, he won a second race for the 18th district just three months later. What role he plays: Much of Ryan&#039;s time in office has focused on veterans&#039; issues. Recently, he dispatched caseworkers throughout his community to ensure veterans and their families secured federal benefits. Ryan also graduated from the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York, which resides in his district. Key quote: &quot;At West Point, you learn the honor code: A cadet will not lie, cheat, steal, or tolerate those who do. Well there&#039;s a candidate who has violated every word in that code, a serial liar, cheater, thief, who looked soldiers in the eye then turned around and called fallen heroes &#039;suckers and losers,&#039; who insulted Medal of Honor recipients just last week,&quot; he said, referring to Trump, the Republican nominee for president. Watch Rep. Pat Ryan&#039;s full speech here: When and where is the DNC The Democratic National Convention will take place from August 19-22 in Chicago, Illinois.

    "title": "Man goes viral for taste-testing last meals of notorious death row inmates",
    "text": "Fox News Man goes viral for taste-testing last meals of notorious death row inmates Nicole Pelletiere December 29, 2023 at 3:50 PM · 5 min read Link Copied Read full article Man goes viral for taste-testing last meals of notorious death row inmates\nA recent college graduate from Virginia is attracting attention from true crime lovers on social media, as he cooks and tastes the final meals that were requested by well-known death row inmates.\nSince Sept. 1, Josh Slavin, 23, has shared 26 different Instagram Reels featuring his ratings of death row meal requests.\nThe first one he posted was that of Ricky Ray Rector — a convicted murderer who, according to several news reports, requested steak, fried chicken, a cherry Kool-Aid and pecan pie for his final meal.\nRector died by lethal injection in Arkansas in 1992.\n'STEAK AND JELLY, PLEASE,' AMERICANS TELL UBER EATS — AND OTHER ODD AND POPULAR CUSTOMER REQUESTS OF 2023\n\"There wasn’t any rhyme or reason why I chose [Rector] to start,\" Slavin told Fox News Digital.\nREAD ON THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"It looked simple to throw together.\"\nSeen here is a recreation of the extravagant final meal request made by Lawrence Russell Brewer, a convicted killer who didn't eat one bite of the food, according to several sources.\n\"I enjoy making [the content], people enjoy consuming it, and I decided to keep doing new renditions and covering new criminals.\"\nSlavin works in finance and creates lifestyle content on social media. He recently graduated from Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, where he studied finance and accounting, he said.\nHe believes it is true crime aficionados who take an interest in his death row meals series.\nINSIDE THE LIZZIE BORDEN HOUSE, GUESTS CAN STAY OVERNIGHT WHERE PEOPLE WERE BRUTALLY AX MURDERED\n\"I, and I think others, have an innate infatuation and a morbid curiosity about these types of things,\" Slavin said.\n\"Death is something everyone obviously faces,\" he added. Yet \"to have the rare opportunity to select exactly what you want [to eat] right before you die is a very rare human circumstance and that's fascinating.\"\nSlavin has recreated and taste-tested meals that had been requested (or not requested) by several notorious inmates — from serial killer Ted Bundy, who declined the privilege to select a meal.\nAfter he declined to choose, Bundy was reportedly given steak, hash browns, eggs, toast, juice and milk.\n'GARBAGE PLATES': THE STORY BEHIND A FAVORITE LATE-NIGHT DISH OF COLLEGE STUDENTS, PLUS HOW TO MAKE A VERSION\nSlavin also tried the meal requested by terrorist Timothy McVeigh, who was sentenced to death by lethal injection for killing 168 people and injuring 680 in the Oklahoma City bombing of 1995.\nMcVeigh apparently requested two pints of mint chocolate chip ice cream .\n\"In my opinion, ice cream alone is a poor final meal choice and choosing mint chocolate chip as the flavor only makes the decision worse,\" Slavin said in his Instagram Reel as he judged McVeigh's last meal choice.\n\"I'm placing this meal in 'D tier.'\"\nFor each meal, Slavin first does research on the person, the crime and the food.\nHe then cooks the food, tastes it and ranks the dishes in tiers — with S being \"the best\" and D being \"abysmal.\"\nWHY DOES FRUITCAKE LAST SO LONG? INGREDIENTS AND PREPARATION OF THE DESSERT PLAY INTO ITS LONGEVITY\n\"The No. 1 meal that I made was that of Alton Coleman,\" Slavin said of the last meal choice of Coleman.\nThe serial killer chose to eat \"filet mignon with mushroom gravy, biscuits and gravy, fried chicken, French fries, broccoli with cheese, collard greens, onion rings, corn bread, a salad, sweet potato pie, butter pecan ice cream and cherry cola\" before he was executed by lethal injection in 2002, according to the Office of the Clark County Prosecuting Attorney in Indiana.\nSlavin went on, \"He had a large meal, but I thought that the meal was well coordinated. It synergized … It was a full southern meal.\"\nIn America, most states will offer a last meal to a violent criminal preceding that person's execution.\nIt's not fully clear how long the ritual has existed, though in many cases inmates will have their pick of the meal as long as it meets state guidelines.\nIn 2011, Texas eliminated meal requests after killer Lawrence Russell Brewer requested a lengthy, expensive meal. He didn't eat it and told prison guards that he wasn't hungry, Reuters reported.\nHAMBURGER VS. HOT DOG: WHICH IS HEALTHIER? EXPERTS CHIME IN\nIn 1990, murderer James Edward Smith requested a lump of dirt for his last meal.\nHis request was denied, and he was given yogurt instead, according to multiple sources.\nJosh Slavin, 23, cooks, tastes and ranks the food from the last meal requests of infamous American killers. He posts his ratings on his Instagram account under the handle @jjslavin. His project has received mixed reviews.\nAs for Slavin and how he chooses the meals to feature, he said he takes a few things into consideration.\n\"I look at the dishes they select, the story behind the crime, the story behind the selection of the meal, how they engaged in the meal,\" he said. \"Their stories encompass the background of how their case took place, what they may have eaten growing up.\"\nSome of Slavin's 575,000 Instagram followers have offered hot takes on his last meal series.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\nMany people submit requests to him, asking if he can try the meals that had been eaten by specific criminals — while others appear to oppose his project and offer comments about the American justice system.\n\"Some people express their disgust about the conduct of the inmate or the actions of the convict because to be sentenced to death, you have [had] to commit some really reprehensible acts,\" Slavin said.\n\"There are also people that see the content and say it's something they don't want to see because it may glorify murderers. The subject matter is incredibly intense, and I think that could really charge people's emotions.\"\nSlavin said that as he shares his content, he tries to keep his opinions out of it unless he's ranking the food.\n\"Not every story from our history is going to be sunshine and rainbows, but I don't think that's a reason to not share them,\" Slavin said.\n\"Death is something that comes to everyone, but there are so few situations where you know exactly when you are going to die, and choose exactly what you're going to eat before you die. So rarely do these hypotheticals translate into reality. This one just happens to be a reality of our history, and a reality of our present.\"\nHe added, \"When you un-package it for what it is, it's really thought-provoking in my opinion. If my content is not for you, I am sorry, and feel free to keep scrolling.\"\nFor more Lifestyle articles, visit www.foxnews.com/lifestyle .\nOriginal article source: Man goes viral for taste-testing last meals of notorious death row inmates\nView comments",

And they also had an AirTag.\"\nOnce her family's luggage was recovered, to their dismay, almost everything was gone.\n\"Police believe they may have sold the clothes for money, who knows,\" Catherine explained. \"These are my parents, coming to the mountains for a North Carolina view, so for this to happen made me sad, which was all the more reason to go after them…I wouldn’t have found them without this AirTag.\"\nCharlotte, N.C., city skyline.\nAccording to police records, the suspect was arrested and charged with multiple theft crimes, including a drug charge, and is being held on a $10,000 bond.\nThe Gastonia Police Department did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment.\nOriginal article source: Florida family uses Apple AirTag to locate stolen luggage from a North Carolina airport to suspect's home\nView comments",
