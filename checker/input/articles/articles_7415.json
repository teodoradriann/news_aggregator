    "text": "'Tradición Kadampa', la peligrosa secta budista que se ha hecho con el convento de las clarisas de Granada\nDesde el budismo 'oficial' se acusa a su fundador de «dirigir un verdadero movimiento internacional» salpicado por «escándalos, delitos e incluso crímenes»\nDe cara al exterior es un grupo budista más, con su halo de buenismo, armonía, equilibrio, paz e interioridad. Pero, tras esta máscara amable y benévola, Nueva Tradición Kadampa (NTK) se trata de una secta que profesa un culto casi idolátrico a su líder, Gueshe Kelsang Gyatso, uno de los primeros lamas tibetanos en aterrizar en la ideológicamente convulsa Europa de los años 70 y que falleció en 2022. Esta semana se ha conocido que el área de Urbanismo del ayuntamiento de Granada otorgó en enero la autorización de rehabilitación del antiguo convento de clarisas de Las Vistillas a Nueva Tradición Kadampa, que adquirió la propiedad por 2,5 millones de euros a un fondo de inversiones. Sus intenciones son ponerse manos a la obra para convertir el antiguo cenobio en un gran centro de meditación budista que abriría en 2026.\nNo se trata de la primera aparición de la secta en la ciudad andaluza. Abrieron su primer centro en el año 2000 por expreso deseo de Gueshe Kelsang, que pasó sus últimos años de vida en Granada, lugar del que se enamoró y donde se estableció. En España cuentan con una veintena de centros, y son más de un millar desperdigados por todo el planeta.\nCulto al líder\n«El venerable Gueshe Kelsang Gyatso Rimpoché apareció en este mundo porque la gente necesita el Budadharma para disfrutar de una vida feliz y llena de sentido», explica la página oficial de NTK, que insiste en su proselitismo para «cumplir el deseo del corazón de nuestro gurú», al que adorna con extraordinarias virtudes como una «inconmensurable bondad, profunda sabiduría y habilidad práctica».\nLa versión de sus oponentes es, más bien, la contraria. Porque NTK tiene muchos oponentes. Los primeros en calificar Nueva Tradición Kadampa de secta son los propios budistas, que llegan a advertir «de un riesgo social a escala internacional». «Instituciones budistas al más alto nivel, empezando por Su Santidad el Dalai Lama, han visto necesario poner las cartas sobre la mesa», señalan desde el budismo oficial.\nBroncas con el Dalai Lama\nY es que las trifulcas entre el Dalai Lama y Gueshe Kelsang Gyatso vienen de atrás. Desde finales del pasado siglo se hicieron conocidas las manifestaciones públicas de los seguidores del santón tibetano contra el líder espiritual de los budistas y premio Nobel de la Paz. Concentraciones escandalosas con grandes pancartas, insultos, descalificaciones, gritos y abucheos acompañaban al Dalai Lama cuando visitaba algún lugar.\nPero el budismo oficial llega más allá, alertando de «comportamientos muy inapropiados para un lama», refiriéndose a Gueshe Kelsang Gyatso, al que acusan de «dirigir un verdadero movimiento internacional de difamación envuelto en todo tipo de acusaciones, escándalos, delitos e incluso crímenes».\nEl teólogo y experto en sectas Luis Santamaría del Río observa en uno de sus libros, La Nueva Era en el siglo XXI, que en Occidente «se ha establecido un ambiente cultural cada vez más impregnado de orientalismo», en el que «conceptos como el karma, la reencarnación, los chakras...» se han convertido en habituales. El especialista evidencia la contradicción que se da en las sociedades occidentales «que conservan aún muchas tradiciones y elementos cristianos pero, a la vez, hablan con toda naturalidad de la ley del karma o creen en la reencarnación».\nEntrevista al experto en sectas y nueva religiosidad\nLuis Santamaría: «Es una barbaridad ofrecer 'mindfulness' en un colegio católico»\n«Lo oriental ha llegado para quedarse entre nosotros», lamenta Santamaría del Río. Así será, por lo menos, en el antiguo convento de las clarisas de Granada.",

    "text": "OTTAWA — Health Canada is reminding Canadians about a recall of home bed assist handles after learning of an additional death. Four models of bed handles distributed by Drive Medical were first recalled two years ago after two reported deaths — one in Canada and one in the U.S. Health Canada says as of Dec. 19, the company has received a report of a second death in this country. The metal handles are affixed alongside the mattress to help people get in and out of their regular bed at home. The products are not designed for hospital beds. Health Canada says more than 68,000 of the affected handles were sold between 2016 and 2021 in Canada. It says consumers should stop using them and contact Drive Medical Canada to get a refund. The recalled home bed assist model numbers are 15064, 15062, RTL15073 and RTL15063-ADJ. No information has been provided about what caused any of the deaths, but the recall notice says that retention straps were not properly secured in the initial cases in Canada and the U.S. Drive Medical has also learned of an additional three deaths in the U.S. that happened before Dec. 6, 2021, when the recall was first issued. More than 496,000 of the bed assist products were distributed in the U.S. between 2007 and 2021. The products were sold on Amazon. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 28, 2023.

    "text": "A winter lover's lament: No snow or cold, now what do I do? [Keith Uhlig](/staff/4383061002/keith-uhlig/) It happened in a split second. One moment I was happily pedaling my bicycle on my favorite pathway along the Wisconsin River; the next I was lying on the ground, my legs tangled in the frame of my vintage Specialized Sirrus road bike. What happened? A quick appraisal determined that as I was turning through a bend on [Wausau's River Edge Parkway](https://www.wausauwi.gov/your-government/engineering/bicycling-and-walking), I hit a stretch of thin, invisible ice. The front wheel went to my right, my body went to the left and there I was, sprawling on the pavement. Every Wisconsin cyclist who rides through the winter months can expect these kinds of mishaps. Winter biking, while not quite edging into what I consider unreasonably dangerous territory, isn't safe, either. So I take on some blame for insisting on riding on Dec. 28. But in this case, the bulk of the fault rests on our unseasonably mild winter conditions. Why? Because with temperatures hovering around the freezing mark, most of the roads were wet but had plenty of traction. But this area of the River Edge Parkway, which runs adjacent to Wausau's [world-class whitewater course](/story/news/local/2022/08/23/whitewater-park-wausau-upgrades-more-freestyle-kayaking/10312510002/), features smooth and slick decorative concrete that was also, somehow, colder than the blacktop of most of the pathway. The whitewater course, which should be 80% iced over by now, is completely open and free. So there's bound to be more moisture covering the nearby surfaces. The result? Crash. It is unseemly to complain about moderate, comfortable weather conditions in the midst of a Wisconsin winter. But [these are unprecedented times](/story/news/local/2023/12/26/green-bay-christmas-hits-highest-temperatures-in-recorded-history/72031864007/). Ordinarily, I would be embracing this season with gusto, embracing [snow-covered trails through our forests on Nordic skis](/story/life/be-wisconsin/2022/03/10/american-birkebeiner-ernie-st-germaine-wisconsin-has-skied-every-race-since-1973/9341877002/). If there was no snow, I would be [wild skating on the area's river backwaters, lakes and ponds](/story/news/2020/12/15/nordic-skating-adventures-wild-ice-wisconsin/3858336001/). Beating the winter blues I dreaded winter for most of my life. I would plunge into a pit of gloom each February. My self-prescribed antidote is to [go outside for some form of exercise every day](/story/news/2019/03/18/wisconsin-outdoor-exercise-why-exercised-outside-every-day-year/2886141002/) and embrace the opportunities only winter has to offer, and I start looking forward to cross-country skiing and ice skating sometime in September, giving myself weeks to get psyched up for cold and snow. Which leads me all to the question: What do I do now? I'm feeling a bit unmoored by the cognitive dissonance of it all. The old winter-hating Keith would be rejoicing. Now I'm just floundering. And worrying, to be honest. While meteorologists say this bout of warm weather is related to El Niño, a short-term blip in weather patterns, one can't help but think of the long-term impact of the warming global climate. Whenever I start thinking about that particular problem, I immediately stop myself. It's just too big to grapple with on my own, other than trying limit the amount of pollution I create. Meanwhile, my aim is to make the most of each day, no matter the weather. For help on that front, I called [Minocqua Winter Park](https://www.minocquawinterpark.org/), a Northwoods cross-country skiing destination, to find out what winter lovers are doing up there. The park has no snow, I was told, but people were welcome to come for hiking, running and disc golf. Dan Clausen, the owner of the park's ski shop, said temperatures have been cold enough near Minocqua to allow him and other wild ice skaters to glide across area lakes. He didn't want to say which lakes, because conditions can change quickly. But, he said, forecasts call for a dose of colder weather through the New Year's holiday. \"I'm predicting world-class ice skating,\" Clausen said. Ooo. I feel better already, and I predict I'll be driving north sometime this holiday weekend, looking for ice-covered lakes. Take a cold-water plunge? I also spoke with Ben Ruyle of Baraboo. Ruyle is an ultramarathoner and [cold-water plunger](https://breakthrough-pt.com/blog/top-6-benefits-of-cold-plunges/) who hates hot weather and loves the cold. He's bummed there hasn't been any lasting snow so far this season, but he's also recovering from ankle surgery, so he hasn't been able to get out much anyway. But he said he will soon be jumping into the Baraboo River or nearby Devil's Lake. He's found that submerging his body to his neck for about five minutes leaves him feeling great, once he passes the initial shock of a cold-water dunk. \"I like to do things that are mentally tough,\" Ruyle said. \"I want to be comfortable doing things that are uncomfortable.\" Counterintuitively, the milder weather might extend his cold-water dunks. There's no ice to get through. Even so, he's hoping for snow and cold. \"I love winter,\" he said. \"And snow is beautiful.\" Although I've read about cold-water plunges and have jumped into cold water from time to time, I haven't felt the pull to do it on a regular basis. Talking with Ruyle has me thinking. Maybe? Probably not. My comfort level with discomfort is not as strong as Ruyle's. I won't rule it out, though. More trail running could be an antidote Maybe I will need to incorporate more trail running into my outdoor routine. Although I regularly jog around my neighborhood, I might be better served to get out on the bare cross-country ski trails at the nearby [Nine Mile County Recreation Area](https://www.marathoncounty.gov/Home/Components/FacilityDirectory/FacilityDirectory/134/164), like some other Wausau-area Nordic fanatics do. Rachel and Greg Kresse are top-notch Wausau-area Nordic skiing coaches and athletes. When I talked to Rachel about how they are coping with the warm weather, she sounded crestfallen. Last year by this time, she said, she and Greg had skied a dozen times. The Wausau area didn't have enough snow for skiing at that point, but they regularly traveled north, often to Michigan's Upper Peninsula, to get their ski legs. This year not even the U.P. has had consistent snow. So the Kresses are lifting weights and walking with ski poles. Greg is doing \"hill bounds\" with his poles on Nine Mile's ski trails. \"What else can you do?\" Rachel said. Wait. We can wait for snow. It's bound to come, right? It has to come. Meanwhile, I plan to add in some trail running to my regular jogs, and keep riding bikes. And doing my best to keep the wheels down and my body upright.

During a meeting with UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini, Safadi underlined the agency's \"indispensable\" role for Palestine refugees, serving as a lifeline for more than 2 million Palestinians facing an unprecedented humanitarian crisis in Gaza, the Jordan News Agency, Petra, reported.\n\"No other body is capable of fulfilling the vital role of the UNRWA in Gaza\", Safadi said, warning that cutting financial support would worsen the \"plight\" of Gaza's people, who are on the brink of famine due to numerous Israeli obstacles impeding their access to crucial humanitarian supplies.\nThe meeting also went over the challenges facing the agency and the charges brought against 12 of its staff in the Gaza Strip, with Lazzarini noting that the agency had launched an immediate investigation into the allegations and had terminated the contracts of the accused staff, according to Petra.\nSafadi and Lazzarini urged the countries that had suspended aid to the UNRWA to reconsider their decision.\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has called UNRWA the \"backbone\" of Gaza after several countries, including the United States, Britain, Germany and Japan, have suspended funding to the agency.\nThe agency's donors have suspended funding to UNRWA over Israeli accusations that several staff members were involved in the October 7 sudden attack.\nThe UN's coordinator for Gaza aid, Sigrid Kaag, has recently that no other agency can \"replace or substitute\" UNRWA, which has thousands of employees.",
