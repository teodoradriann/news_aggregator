    "text": "(ZENIT News / Rome, 22.05.2024).- “No,” is Pope Francis’ clear, concrete and direct response to Norah O’Donnell, CBS’ journalist of the “60 Minutes” TV program, who asked him: “Many boys and girls will come here at the end of next month for World Children’s Day. And I’m curious: will a girl who grows up today as a Catholic, have the opportunity at some point to be a Deaconess and participate as a member of the clergy in the Church?” O’Donnell asked the question again, pressuring the Holy Father to find out if he is open to the female diaconate, to which he answered: “If it’s Deaconesses with Holy Orders, no.” The Pope continued: “But women have always had, I’d say, the function of Deaconesses without being Deacons, no? Women are at the service in a great way as women, not as Ministers within Holy Orders.” And he added: “They are more courageous than men. They know better how to protect life. Women are teachers, custodians of life. Women are great, they are very great. And to make room for women in the Church doesn’t mean to give them a ministry, no. The Church is Mother, and women in the Church are the ones who help to foster that maternity. Let’s not forget that it was women who never abandoned Jesus. All the men fled.” On April 8, 2020, Pope Francis established a “Commission for the Study of the Feminine Diaconate.” Four years later, during an interview with Europa Press, theologian Linda Pocher said that the Pope was in favour of the feminine diaconate. She made the statement in the context of her participation in a closed-door meeting with the Pope, his Council of Cardinals, two Catholic women theologians (Pocher being one of them), and an Anglican woman “Bishop”. The Pontiff’s answer to CBS contradicts all those that said that Pope Francis was in favour of the feminine diaconate. This response certainly has an outstanding point: the Pope says that “If it’s Deaconesses with Holy Orders, no.” Which opens the possibility of an eventual form of feminine diaconate , but without Holy Orders. It might be that the Commission instituted by the Pope is moving its reflection in this direction, and also that of those women who advised him in the meetings with his advisory Cardinals.

    "text": "Thousands of Boeing employees walked off the job on Friday (September 13) after rejecting the company's latest contract offer. This move could create a significant disruption as Boeing works to ramp up production following a safety crisis. This strike, Boeing’s first in 16 years, is expected to bring a halt to operations in the Seattle area, where most of the company’s commercial planes are manufactured. This could further strain Boeing's already fragile supply chain. Around 30,000 members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), who build Boeing’s 737 MAX and other planes in Seattle and Portland, took part in a vote on their first full contract in 16 years. The workers turned down the offer, with a strong majority in favour of striking. The union said that 96 per cent of its members voted in favour of the strike, easily surpassing the two-thirds threshold needed to approve a walkout. In addition, 95 per cent of those who voted rejected the company’s offer. IAM represents roughly one-fifth of Boeing's global workforce, which consists of over 170,000 employees",

    "title": "EIA: Red Sea attacks increase shipping times and freight rates | Hellenic Shipping News Worldwide",
    "text": "After Yemen-based Houthi militia attacks on commercial ships transiting the Red Sea started in November 2023, some vessels began opting to avoid the Bab el-Mandeb chokepoint—a narrow strait that borders the Yemeni coast and is the southern entrance to the Red Sea. Instead, they’re choosing to take longer, more costly routes around the tip of Africa.\nShips transiting between Europe and Asia via the Suez Canal must pass through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, which connects the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden. The Bab el-Mandeb Strait is an important oil and natural gas chokepoint, accounting for 12% of seaborne oil trade and 8% of liquefied natural gas (LNG) trade in the first half of 2023. Major oil and natural gas companies that are avoiding the Red Sea include Equinor, which operates mostly natural gas carriers, and bp, which operates both oil and natural gas carriers. As of January 23, 2024, other major energy companies pausing Red Sea transits include Euronav, QatarEnergy, Torm, Shell, and Reliance.\nVessels that do not pass through the Suez Canal via the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and Red Sea can go around southern Africa via the Cape of Good Hope, but that route can add significant time to the voyage, depending on the ship’s origin and its destination. A typical voyage from the Persian Gulf to the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp petroleum trading hub (ARA) via the Suez Canal takes 19 days. If the ship takes the Cape of Good Hope route, it takes nearly 35 days to reach the ARA. For products leaving the U.S. Gulf Coast and heading toward Asia, vessels typically pass through the Panama Canal, which is nearly a month-long trip. Due to the ongoing drought and restrictions at the Panama Canal, more Very Large Gas Carriers (VLGCs), which primarily carry propane and butane, started going through the Suez Canal. Now some of these VLGCs are going around the Cape of Good Hope. A journey from the U.S. Gulf Coast to Chiba in Japan through the Suez Canal adds about 17 days and one through the Cape of Good Hope adds about 21 days, compared with going through the Panama Canal.\nLonger routes put upward pressure on freight rates because of fuel costs and fewer available ships. A VLGC, for example, consumes about $30,000 to $35,000 worth of fuel per day if using high-sulfur bunker fuel at average 2023 prices. In addition to adding to fuel costs, a longer voyage requires more ships to maintain the same delivery schedule, and fewer available ships contribute to higher tanker rates and costs.\nAfter the attacks began in November, flows of oil, refined products, and natural gas passing through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait slowed. About 18% less crude oil flowed through the Bab el-Mandeb in December than on average from January to November 2023. Most crude oil trade that goes through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait leaves Russia and Iraq en route to Asia and the Mediterranean, respectively. Clean petroleum product flows through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait were 30% lower in December than the rest of 2023. The majority of petroleum product trade leaves Saudi Arabia and India bound for Europe and leaves Russia bound for Asia.\nIn December, 24% less LNG and 1% more liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) were traded globally compared with the rest of 2023. Vessel restrictions at the Panama Canal due to a drought are causing more VLGCs leaving from the United States to head east toward either the Suez Canal or the Cape of Good Hope. LPG flows through the Bab el-Mandeb increased by 59% in 2023 compared with 2022 because water conservation efforts at the Panama Canal began in January 2023, causing delays and higher costs for VLGCs. The Combined Maritime Forces, a partnership representing 39 nations, warned ships to avoid the Bab el-Mandeb Strait on January 12, which will likely reduce passages through January 2024.\nClean petroleum product tanker rates for routes that cross the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and Suez Canal increased in December 2023 because of the ongoing conflict in the Red Sea. Because routes going through the Red Sea have elevated risk insurance premiums, these costs are passed on to tanker rates. For the four tanker rates that pass through the Red Sea, the average increase was 20% in December compared with November, according to Argus Freight. Long-range 1 tankers traveling from the western coast of India to the UK Continent increased the most (23%), and tankers traveling from the Mideast Gulf to the UK Continent increased the least (16%). Rates for dirty tankers, which mostly transport crude oil, have been relatively unchanged from the elevated prices in November. Brent crude oil spot prices for the week ending November 17, 2023, the week before attacks on ships in the Red Sea began, were $82 per barrel (b). Since then, prices have traded in range, and they closed at $79/b as of January 18, 2024.\nSource: EIA\n2024-02-02 hellenicshippingnews...",
