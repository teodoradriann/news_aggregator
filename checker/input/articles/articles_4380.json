    "text": "這種痛不是忍耐就好！ 醫揭「慢性疼痛警訊」：3個月以上快就醫\n【健康醫療網／編輯部整理】困擾著許多人的「慢性疼痛」是什麼呢？林口長庚神經內科部副部主任郭弘周表示，慢性疼痛指的是持續超過 3 個月以上，即使原本受傷或發炎早已痊癒，仍持續存在的疼痛，且無法透過短期治療緩解。\n大腦「錯誤的訊號」 慢性疼痛恐影響情緒及壓力\n郭弘周醫師提到，慢性疼痛影響全球 20% 的人口，雖不會致命，但是這類疼痛會嚴重影響日常生活、睡眠品質，甚至導致情緒低落。常說疼痛是除了呼吸、心跳、血壓及體溫外的第五生命徵象，但因無法被客觀的儀器量測到，往往只有病人本身才知道那刻骨銘心的痛，也常常被忽視，造成這些病人奔波在各科的門診中。\n常見的慢性疼痛，包含慢性神經痛（如帶狀皰疹後神經痛、糖尿病神經病變、三叉神經痛等）、慢性頭痛、中風後疼痛、慢性肩頸痛或下背痛及纖維肌痛症等。急性疼痛常常是由局部組織損傷引起，而慢性疼痛往往來自大腦，與中樞過度敏感有關，即使局部損傷已消失且無實質傷害，卻因「錯誤的訊號」使大腦誤以為身體正在疼痛，所以只處理局部是不夠的。另外，慢性疼痛不只是痛，也常有許多共病，造成情緒失衡、壓力調適失當、專注力改變等，進而造成失能，所以只靠止痛藥是無法痊癒的。\n神經性疼痛出現電擊感 慢性頭痛及中風後疼痛屬不同症狀\n郭弘周醫師解釋，慢性疼痛的成因具多樣性，其中神經性疼痛是由於神經受損或功能異常所引起，常見的症狀包括麻木、灼熱感、針刺感或電擊般的疼痛，即使在沒有外部刺激時也會出現。慢性頭痛中常見的偏頭痛，不只是頭痛，而是一種神經疾病，是一種反覆發作的神經血管性頭痛，通常伴隨噁心、畏光、畏聲，甚至視覺先兆。\n另外，因中樞神經系統損傷所引起的疼痛，患側呈現持續性疼痛、異常感覺或對刺激過度敏感，如中風後疼痛就是常見的類型。在處理慢性疼痛方面，不單單只是止痛，還要正確診斷造成疼痛的周邊及中樞原因，更要讓造成疼痛的混亂機制回到平衡狀態，如此才有機會脫離惱人的慢性疼痛。\n多層次治療策略 助患者擺脫惱人疼痛\n郭弘周醫師表示，治療慢性疼痛的口服藥物，除了傳統止痛類藥物外，抗癲癇類藥物和抗憂鬱類藥物，有著調節神經訊號達到緩解疼痛的效果，在慢性偏頭痛治療也有針對造成疼痛機轉的急性止痛和預防性用藥。隨著醫療技術進步，除了口服藥物治療外，也有許多非藥物治療可協助病人，如神經調控技術中的重複經顱磁刺激或是介入性治療的神經阻斷術等，都可為患者帶來更多脫離疼痛的機會。\n原文出處：長庚醫訊第四十六卷第六期\n【延伸閱讀】\n慢性疼痛別害怕運動！ 物理治療師教你「正確動法」重拾生活掌控權\n資料來源：健康醫療網\nhttps://www.healthnews.com.tw/readnews.php?id=65421\n更多健康資訊：健康醫療網",

    "text": "PESCA EN ASTURIAS\nNi la dureza de la profesión ni la falta de trabajo: esta es la causa que frena la incorporación al sector pesquero\nLa edad media está entre los 35 y los 40 años, pero hace falta enganchar a más gente joven: \"Si volviese a nacer, volvería a ser pescador. Pero se hace más duro esa fatiga de tanta norma\"\nOviedo - Publicado el\n3 min lectura\nLa pesca es uno de los sectores más arraigados en Asturias. El paso de los años ha ido cambiando las condiciones, pero siempre ha sido una actividad tradicional que ha forjado muchos de los pueblos costeros que hay repartidos por todo el Principado. En la actualidad sigue siendo un motor económico en Asturias, aunque la sensación es que cada vez es más difícil que el sector siga siendo pujante. El problema no está directamente en la falta de relevo. La edad media está entre los 35 y los 40 años. El problema está en la falta de atractivo para la gente joven. Y eso que hay trabajo y que ya no es un sector tan duro como lo era antaño. El principal inconveniente es la burocracia y las constantes trabas que llegan en forma de normativas europeas.\nEsta semana, un centenar de escolares de Luanco han pasado por la Cofradía para conocer desde dentro un trabajo que es vital en una villa como la capital de Gozón. Una iniciativa que parte de 'Pesca España', una agrupación de productores de todo el territorio nacional para fomentar el sector. Con el objetivo de enganchar a los chavales y de que vean oportunidades en esta actividad. Porque las hay, hay trabajo. El problema no está tanto en la dureza de las condiciones, que está claro que no son fáciles. Está más en los múltiples requisitos y en las múltiples trabas que arrojan incertidumbre hacia el futuro. La lucha de los pescadores ha pasado de ser contra el agua y contra las mareas a ser contra la burocracia y contra las instituciones.\n\"Las dudas llegan por el mañana\"\nY eso merma, como explica Abraham Mazuelas, patrón mayor de la Cofradía de Luanco: “Las dudas llegan por el día de mañana, por cómo va a estar esto. Cómo lo van a gestionar. No por la pesca. Que si molinos, restricciones, zonas de veda... Los primeros que tenemos que cuidar el pescado somos nosotros. Tiene que haber restricciones. Lo vemos, que cuidándolo pescado va a haber. Pero no puede venir todo desde Europa de los que están allí sentados. Llegas a cansarte de un oficio que es vocacional desde crío”.\nMazuelas no oculta que es un trabajo complicado, pero insiste en que eso no es lo que pone más trabas. Y que al menos en su caso compensa: “Claro que es duro. Y hay días que está malo y no puedes salir y ese día no tienes jornal. Salir todavía de noche, ver el amanecer en la mar, dedicarte a lo que te gusta... Si volviese a nacer, volvería a ser pescador. Pero se hace más duro esa fatiga de tanta norma”.\nedad media en el sector\nLos datos a nivel nacional demuestran que el 27% de los trabajadores del sector tiene más de 40 años. Y es que según Antonio Blanco, de 'Pesca España', hace falta más apoyo para fomentar la entrada al sector: “En zonas costeras se está dando la espalda a este sector que ha sido y es motor económico en estas zonas. Y vertebrador de territorio. De ahí que sea tan importante promocionar este trabajo y este sector”.",
