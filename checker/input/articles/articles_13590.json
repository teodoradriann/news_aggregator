    "text": "The Biden campaign claimed that former President Donald Trump has &quot;confirmed&quot; plans to jail political opponents if elected. NY Post composite / istock/ Gett Diary of disturbing disinformation and dangerous delusions This tweet: Biden-Harris campaign statement on convicted felon Donald Trump confirming his Project 2025 plan to jail his opponents pic.twitter.com/j9ELJI1J6D — Biden-Harris HQ (@BidenHQ) June 5, 2024 We say: Sorry, Biden-Harris. Trump explicitly said claims he’d seek revenge on political foes are “wrong” and that the lawfare game “has to stop,” or “we’re not going to have a country.” Still, you have to marvel at Team Biden’s cojones in (falsely) warning that Trump will do precisely what Democrats have been doing to him. Exhibit A? The bogus felony conviction against him that was 1,000% politically motivated. Spot the difference #1: “I’ve done all I can do [to fix the border].” — President Biden, Jan. 30 vs. “I’m . . . using the executive authorities available to me as president . . . to address the border.” — Biden, Tuesday We say: What a difference a nearing election and sinking poll numbers make. For years, Biden claimed he had no power to fix the border (though he somehow had the power to break it the second he took office, by ditching key measures Trump put in place). Now that a whopping 70% of voters flunk him on the border issue, per a Fox News poll, he’s suddenly discovering “executive authorities” that were actually available to him all along. Still, don’t be fooled: Even his belated actions now are a sham that won’t end the crisis. Spot the difference #2: — NPR Public Editor (@NPRpubliceditor) October 22, 2020 vs. “Hunter Biden’s Laptop Makes a Brief Appearance at His Trial” — The New York Times, Wednesday We say: Almost without exception, mainstream news outlets — on the eve of the 2020 election — dismissed The Post’s famous scoop on Hunter Biden’s incriminating laptop as “Russian disinformation.” Yet now that Joe Biden’s own Justice Department has introduced the laptop as evidence in Hunter’s gun trial, outlets are readily discussing the story as if they’d never denied it at all. This charge: “They were . . . being racist as hell to Alvin Bragg.” — Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-NY), Saturday We say:What was “racist” about the criticism of Bragg? Even many on the left (CNN commentators, ex-Gov. David Paterson, etc.) have questioned the weakness of Bragg’s case and said they’d have acquitted Trump due to a lack of evidence. Radicals like Bowman really need to find some other card to play besides race. It’s gotten beyond boring. Compiled by The Post Editorial Board",

    "title": "First Nations leaders and Canada agree on a proposed reform of child and family services",
    "text": "MONTRÉAL , July 11, 2024 /CNW/ - Today, the Assembly of First Nations, Chiefs of Ontario , Nishnawbe Aski Nation and Canada reached a $47.8 billion Agreement on the Long-Term Reform of the First Nations Child and Family Services Program. The Agreement is subject to engagement with First Nations and final approvals by the parties to the Agreement.\nThis First Nations-led and designed agreement is the product of the cumulative efforts of the First Nations Parties and their unwavering dedication and leadership over the past three years to ensure the rights of their children and communities are respected and upheld.\nBuilding on the Agreement-in-Principle signed between Canada and the Parties that previously dedicated $20 billion over five years in 2021, this Agreement will include $47.8 billion over 10 years, providing stable and predictable funding over a longer period that fully supports a reformed program and accounts for the increased costs of services in remote communities.\nKey reforms to the current Program's funding methodology will put First Nations in the driver's seat in delivering child and family services to their communities, with increased funding for prevention, First Nations representative services, post-majority support services that will support youth and young adults past the age of majority, and capital. Program funding will adjust to the needs of First Nations children and families today, and into the future, through adjustments for population, inflation and remoteness.\nOver the next three months, First Nations-led engagements will take place across the country to help communities better understand how the Agreement will improve child and family services in their community. We will be working closely with the First Nations Parties during this process, and towards an approved final agreement later this year.\nOnce the Agreement is approved by the Parties, Canada and the First Nations Parties would file a motion with the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal to seek the end of its oversight over the First Nations Child and Family Services Program, with the goal of implementing a fully reformed Program by April 1, 2025 .\nQuotes\n\"Looking back over the past seven months as National Chief, there has not been a day that I have stopped working for our children. For too many years, we have been fighting to fix a broken child welfare system in the courts. And because of our unity in this fight for justice, we reached a historic turning point today with the largest compensation settlement in the history of this country.\"\nNational Chief, Cindy Woodhouse Nepinak Assembly of First Nations\n\"Today, we stand at the brink of a transformative moment for our children and families. The Agreement on the Long-Term Reform of the First Nations Child and Family Services Program represents a profound commitment to our future, rooted in our sovereignty. By supporting the engagement process led by and for First Nations Leadership, and communicating the benefits of the Agreement, we ensure that the voices of our people guide the path forward, fostering a system that respects our traditions and values.\"\nAbram Benedict , Ontario Regional Chief Chiefs of Ontario\n\"Since 2016, we have worked to address the unique discrimination faced by remote communities in Nishnawbe Aski territory. Our Chiefs, as the rightsholders, instructed us to approach these negotiations in a good way to reach the best possible agreement. I believe this has been achieved. This draft agreement includes historic reforms on how funding will be adjusted to account for the high costs of delivering services in remote communities. What we have achieved is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I congratulate everyone involved in this lengthy process. Miigwetch to you all.\"\nGrand Chief Alvin Fiddler Nishnawbe Aski Nation\n\"This is a pivotal moment for reconciliation in Canada . This reform would put First Nations in the driver's seat delivering child and family services to their communities, because they know better than anyone what they need. It would mean First Nations children can grow up in their families, with the services they need, and surrounded by love and their culture. It would bring us closer to a Canada where every child has a fair chance to succeed.\"\nThe Honourable Patty Hajdu Minister of Indigenous Services\nAssociated links\nFinal settlement agreement on Compensation and Agreement-in-Principle for long-term reform of First Nations Child and Family Services and Jordan's Principle Stay connected!\nJoin the conversation about Indigenous Peoples in Canada :\nTwitter: @GCIndigenous and @organisation Facebook: @GCIndigenous and @organisation Instagram: @gcindigenous and @organisation\nYou can subscribe to receive our news releases and speeches via RSS feeds.

    "text": "Jon Anik says toxic fight fans could lead to career change: “I don’t know how much time I have left in this MMA space” UFC commentator Jon Anik is growing tired of toxic fight fans and says a career change could be on the horizon. It was just this past Saturday, at UFC 297, that saw Dricus Du Plessis (21-2 MMA) defeat Sean Strickland (28-6 MMA) to become the new UFC middleweight champion. The split decision victory caused quite a bit of controversy with fans, [fighters](https://www.bjpenn.com/mma-news/sean-strickland/pros-react-after-dricus-du-plessis-dethrones-sean-strickland-at-ufc-297/) and commentators, some believing Strickland should have been given the nod, while others felt Du Plessis was indeed worthy of the win. Jon Anik was one of the commentators who did indeed score the fight for Du Plessis. Apparently, Anik has been attacked by a multitude of fans who believed ‘Tarzan’s performance was worthy of the win and him keeping the belt last weekend. Anik, speaking on his latest podcast with Kenny Florian, shared his frustration with the malice and disrespect shown to him by fight fans on social media: “I am growing tired of this MMA space a little bit, and just the morass of negativity when there is a close fight. Because even if you and I both thought Dricus Du Plessis won the fight, we try to present that information respectfully. And when I go onto X or I go to our YouTube comments, it seems like a lot of these fans are just in attack mode. And I don’t know if these fans are casual fans or not.” Continuing, Jon Anik said (h/t [MMAMania](http://www.mmamania.com)): “I appreciate the passion, but I’m getting to a point at 45 years of age where I don’t know how much time I have left in this MMA space. If I go do pro football, I’m not necessarily gonna be dealing with this lowest common denominator all the time. I don’t know, man. I just feel like there’s a lot of malice and disrespect from the fan base.” Concluding, Anik says he’s ‘had it’ with all the negativity: “We can disagree. Don’t take it from me. Demetrious Johnson and Kenny Florian thought ‘DDP’ won the fight. I’ve just been very off-put with the negativity that has permeated my feed since Saturday night, and I’m just not sure how much longer I have left in this space — honestly. Those of you suggesting that there’s any bias or you don’t like me, well, you’ll probably get your f**king wish come 2026, because honestly, at this point, I’ve had it.” What do you think of Jon Anik’s commentary that he’s had it with toxic MMA fans? Would you be sorry to see the UFC commentator depart? Share your thoughts in the comment section PENN Nation!

    "title": "Lara González, autocrítica: \"No es real, estas no son las 'Guerreras'\" - Infobae",
    "text": "La jugadora de balonmano española Lara González ha negado que sea \"real\" la versión mostrada este jueves por la selección nacional ante Brasil, con derrota abultada por 18-29 en la primera jornada de los Juegos Olímpicos de París, y por ello ha afirmado que \"estas no son las 'Guerreras'\" que tantos éxitos han conseguido en el pasado. \"Creo que no es real, creo que estas no son las 'Guerreras', no somos nosotras. Hoy no hemos mostrado esa garra, ese gen que llevamos dentro, y estoy segura que de aquí a 48 horas o 72 que volvemos a jugar, le vamos a dar la vuelta y por lo menos mostraremos otra cara\", declaró la capitana de la selección española al canal Eurosport. \"Creo que tenemos que hacer un reseteo, calmarnos, volver a la situación un poco inicial, respetar la camiseta que llevamos puesta, respetar todo el trabajo que llevamos haciendo durante mucho tiempo y por todas nuestras compañeras. Y realmente creo que lo podemos hacer muchísimo mejor, reducir cada uno de los errores no forzados que hemos cometido\", indicó desde las instalaciones del Arena Paris Sud. Pese al mal arranque de torneo, González se mostró optimista. \"Lo bueno de esta competición es que en dos días volvemos a competir, que esto es muy largo, aún quedan cuatro partidos, que es importante tener la cabeza fría, que esto no es quien gana el primer partido\", aseveró. \"Queda muchísimo, ahora está en nosotras en hacer una buena digestión de este partido, analizar bien internamente cada una cómo podemos hacerlo mejor\", advirtió la lateral izquierdo del Rapid de Bucarest. Y en esa línea de autocrítica coincidió también Kaba Gassama, en su caso ante los medios oficiales de la Real Federación Española de Balonmano (RFEBM). La pivote dijo que el inicio no había sido el esperado y que eso las había \"lastrado durante todo el partido\". Además, lamentó no haber estado \"muy efectivas de cara a la portería\" y tampoco haber sido en defensa todo lo \"compactas\" que suelen ser. Pese a ello, Gassama realzó la actitud de las 'Guerreras', habiendo \"intentado remontar esos goles\" de Brasil que pusieron todo \"bastante difícil\" hasta el pitido final.",

    "text": "在美国的顽固和全力支持下，以色列右翼政府正坚持对加沙地带的巴勒斯坦人发动灭绝战争，在这样的背景下，以色列受到的国际孤立正日益加剧。该国许多西方传统盟友正试图加强对其右翼领导人的束缚，以迫使内塔尼亚胡政府重新审视其针对加沙地带巴勒斯坦人的政策。\n英国现已加入加拿大、澳大利亚、挪威和新西兰的行列，对以色列国家安全部长伊塔玛·本-格维尔和财政部长贝扎莱尔·斯莫特里奇实施旅行禁令和资产冻结，理由是他们煽动针对巴勒斯坦人的种族主义言论，并鼓励在约旦河西岸扩建定居点。\n阅读更多 list of 4 items list 1 of 4 以色列对加沙战争的今日发展：以军袭击加沙寻求援助者并造成13人死亡、200人受伤 list 2 of 4 以色列总理本雅明·内塔尼亚胡的时间不多了？ list 3 of 4 “全球向加沙进军”意义何在？ list 4 of 4 以色列对加沙战争的今日发展：以色列24小时内在加沙地带造成120名巴勒斯坦人死亡 end of list 此举表明西方盟友选择不采取单边行动，而是与那些在解决加沙战争的道路上怀有共同愿景、并且坚信必须对以色列右翼政府施加更大压力以迫使其停止针对巴勒斯坦人的罪行的国家谨慎协调立场。\n英国也渴望采取这样的方针——英国政府正在对以色列采取升级措施，而这是过去几周内它与其他部分西方国家协调行动的内容之一，以避免引发与以色列和美国这两位盟友的任何直接冲突。\n协调行动 上述五国发表的联合声明强调，实施制裁的决定是为了维护两国方案而付出的不懈努力，而极端的以色列政府正在竭力破坏该方案。在签署这项联合声明的各方看来，这两位以色列部长正是该地区极端主义政客的典型代表——他们威胁要摧毁实现两国方案的任何可能性。\n英国政府已经决定暂停与以色列之间的自由贸易谈判，并在几天前针对约旦河西岸以色列定居点的部分领导人实施了制裁，此外，法国和挪威也采取了这样的措施。\n去年9月，英国政府宣布禁止直接向以色列出口所有武器，但却维持了F-35战斗机零部件的运输，而F-35战斗机一直被视为以色列空军的“命脉”。\n英国《金融时报》援引熟悉制裁背景的消息人士的话报道称，此举代表着英国工党政府对内塔尼亚胡政府态度的转变，背景是内塔尼亚胡政府加大了对加沙地带的军事打击力度，并且坚持阻止人道主义援助物资进入该地带。\n英国《卫报》报道称，英国前外交大臣戴维·卡梅伦曾在去年夏天犹豫是否采取类似举措，并最终拒绝对这两名以色列极端主义官员实施制裁，因为保守党内部有人警告称，此举将会给该党造成右翼选民的选举损失。\n本-格维尔（左）强调，以色列人有能力挑战他和斯莫特里奇（右）受到的制裁 (法国媒体) 议会施压 英国各政党的议员继续向工党政府施压，要求其承认巴勒斯坦为一个独立国家。与此同时，英国首相基尔·斯塔默警告称，任何不明智的举措都可能加剧英国与美国政府在加沙战争问题上的紧张局势，或是激起支持以色列的右翼人士的疑虑。\n上周，英国议会的议员们在质询环节围攻负责中东事务的国务大臣哈米什·法尔科纳，要求其披露政府在这方面的计划，而政府却坚称它正在与盟友进行磋商。\n在过去几个月内，英国议会就政府对以色列政策的立场展开了激烈辩论。英国外交大臣戴维·拉米多次谴责右翼领导人针对巴勒斯坦人的煽动性言论，但并未就是否对他们实施制裁而作出明确决定。与此同时，民粹主义右翼势力则指责工党站在巴勒斯坦一边以反对其盟友以色列。\n英国的阿拉伯律师协会主席萨巴哈·穆赫塔尔告诉半岛电视台记者，对这些以色列极端主义领导人实施制裁“并非政治上的大胆行为，而是履行国际人道主义法的问题——国际人道主义法规定要对威胁和平和煽动危害人类罪行的个人实施制裁。”\n穆赫塔尔补充称，英国与其他的西方盟友共同实施这些制裁，以向国际舞台上其他弱势国家发出令人鼓舞的信号，促使它们采取类似措施，收紧制裁和孤立以色列极右翼领导人，并扩大针对他们的法律和司法诉讼范围。\n美国和以色列的愤怒 数周以来，英国官员以及其他欧洲领导人一直在向以色列总理内塔尼亚胡发出各种信息。内塔尼亚胡因在加沙犯下的战争罪而受到国际刑事法院的通缉，但他威胁将对这一决定实施报复。\n目前，英国工党政府以及其他欧洲国家政府在多个问题上应对与美国政府之间的关系时，正处于一个十字路口，而撤销对内塔尼亚胡极端主义政府的支持，正是它们与美国之间新的分歧来源之一。\n与此同时，美国正试图调解以色列与其西方盟友之间的关系——后者对以色列的政治行径感到愤怒。美国国务卿马尔科·鲁比奥向其盟友发表讲话，敦促他们不要“忽视必须面对的真正敌人”。他谴责了英国的这项决定，并强调美国始终与以色列站在一起。\n英国《卫报》报道称，本·格维尔无视西方最近的决定，并以民粹主义的方式将英国首相基尔·斯塔默比作“法老”，还声称以色列人有能力挑战他所受到的制裁。\n斯莫特里奇指责英国政府试图再次阻止犹太人在该地区定居，所指的是犹太复国主义组织在20世纪30年代与占领巴勒斯坦的英国部队之间发生的冲突。\n国际努力 法国与其他阿拉伯和欧洲国家一道，继续为即将于纽约召开的支持两国方案的国际会议动员力量，法国总统马克龙并未排除在会议期间承认巴勒斯坦国的可能性，以试图保留推进巴以冲突的政治解决进程的可能性。\n美国政府却警告欧洲人不要采取类似举措，与此同时，内塔尼亚胡政府似乎已经决定继续对加沙地带的巴勒斯坦人采取军事行动。\n然而，在欧盟争取对以色列右翼领导人实施类似制裁的支持似乎并非易事，因为这需要所有欧盟成员国达成共识。而欧盟似乎满足于暂停与以色列之间的伙伴关系并对其实施经济制裁。\n尽管自2023年10月7日事件发生以来，德国一直绝对支持以色列针对加沙地带的政策，但以新任德国总理默茨为首的德国政界人士的言论已经表明，这种支持态度发生了明显的转变。\n继英国决定不豁免针对以色列右翼联盟的两位部长的制裁之后，人们越来越担心英国政府会满足于这一举措，而不愿尽快承认巴勒斯坦为一个独立国家，或是全面停止对以色列的武器出口——这可能会被美国解读为针对其盟友的挑战。\n伦敦大学国际关系学教授尼哈德·汗法尔告诉半岛电视台记者，西方各国政府针对以色列采取的这些措施已经太晚，并且仅仅是为了缓解街头的民众压力——人们对加沙地带每天出现的恐怖画面感到愤怒，而以色列政策在西方公众和政界精英当中的支持率也出现了空前的下降。\n同时还是英国巴勒斯坦侨民协会负责人的汗法尔补充称，以色列极右翼领导人不仅发表煽动性言论来反对巴勒斯坦人，鼓励扩大定居点，而且还对巴勒斯坦被拘留者实施了被独立人权组织记录在案的侵犯行为，但西方国家却没有对他们采取任何惩罚性的措施。\n汗法尔指出，西方各国政府必须采取其他更具体、更严厉的措施，以向以色列施压，要求其结束战争和定居点扩张，而不是继续采取软弱的外交努力来应对以色列的暴行。\n来源: 半岛电视台",

    "title": "Supreme Court affirms decision in a case involving GPD officers' warrantless search | News | guampdn.com",
    "text": "The Supreme Court of Guam on Thursday affirmed the Superior Court’s decision granting a man’s motion to suppress evidence in a case involving a warrantless search conducted by Guam Police Department officers. A warrantless search is presumptively unreasonable, the upper court said. “In reviewing the trial court’s decision to grant (Zerxes Jabidando) Viva’s motion to suppress and the inconsistencies and contradictions in the officers’ accounts, the trial court’s decision to suppress the evidence was not clearly erroneous. Accordingly, we affirm the Superior Court’s order granting Viva’s motion to suppress,” the justices wrote. The Dec. 28 opinion was authored by Justice Katherine A. Maraman and joined by Chief Justice Robert J. Torres and Justice F. Philip Carbullido. Because the Superior Court had concerns about the credibility of the people’s witnesses, it was not clearly erroneous for the Superior Court to determine that it was unclear whether Viva consented to the search and that the evidence obtained during the search should be suppressed, according to the Supreme Court. GPD Sgt. Ephraim Amaguin conducted a traffic stop after witnessing Viva drive through a stop sign, based on the transcript of the motion to suppress hearing in July 2022. After pulling over, Viva exited the car on his own, and Viva and Amaguin stood in front of the vehicle. According to court documents, the GPD sergeant performed none of the ordinary inquiries of a traffic stop. He did not ask for Viva’s license or registration, run the plates of the car, check for outstanding warrants, or issue a ticket or citation for failing to stop at the stop sign. Instead, according to Amaguin, he asked Viva: (1) if he was still on probation, to which Viva answered yes, (2) if he had any drugs on him, to which Viva answered no, and (3) for permission to search Viva’s vehicle, to which Viva gave consent, based on Amaguin’s testimony. However, he later testified that he could not recall when in the string of events this conversation had occurred, court documents stated. According to Amaguin, after obtaining consent, he requested backup to conduct the search and GPD Officer Christopher Champion and trainee Officer Clomera Conner responded to the request. According to court documents, Champion testified he did not ask Viva for consent to search the vehicle. He testified he discovered a large kitchen knife and saw a suspicious message banner on Viva’s phone that Champion believed to be related to a drug deal but he took no photographs of the message nor did he extract any data from Viva’s phone. The officers found a baggie containing a substance that tested positive for methamphetamine using a field test. They also found Viva’s wallet containing $2,000 but it’s unclear from their testimony whether they found the wallet during the search of Viva’s car or if they discovered it on his person. Champion arrested Viva. The other officer, Conner, testified that none of the officers read Viva his Miranda rights. In contrast, Champion testified that he read Viva his Miranda rights at the precinct. In its decision and order, the Superior Court questioned the truthfulness of the GPD officers’ testimony and ultimately did not find it persuasive. Instead, the trial court found the officers presented inconsistent testimony and that it was unclear whether Viva consented to the search. Ultimately, unable to find that the officers obtained consent, the trial court granted Viva’s motion to suppress. The Office of the Attorney General appealed the suppression, arguing the trial court did not properly address Viva’s consent. In affirming the trial court decision, the Supreme Court said “the decision to grant Viva’s motion to suppress was based on the trial court’s justified concerns about the credibility of the officers’ testimony, not on a failure to properly address the issue of consent.”",
