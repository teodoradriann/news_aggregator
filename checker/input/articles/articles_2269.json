    "text": "Warangal: Historian Prof Mridula Mukherjee criticised both the Uttar Pradesh and Central governments for treating the inaugural ceremony of the Ram temple in Ayodhya as a ‘state-sponsored event.’ She emphasised that while it’s acceptable for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to attend the programme as an individual, doing so in his capacity as the Prime Minister could be inappropriate due to the constitutional position he holds.\nDuring an interaction with the media at the Indian History Congress at Kakatiya University (KU) campus here on Friday, she clarified that she and her colleagues didn’t align themselves with any political party. However, she strongly criticised the incumbent Central government for neglecting what she termed as the ‘authentic history.’\nAlso Read Yogi govt bans liquor around Ram temple in Ayodhya PM Modi to carry Ram idol to new temple: Sources Mukherjee stressed that it is the responsibility of governments to create employment opportunities for students studying and researching history, asserting that being tourist guides at monuments shouldn’t fall under the purview of history students.\nOn a parallel note, IHC General President Prof Aditya Mukherjee criticised the Centre for attempting to conceal history and propagate certain myths for their political gains. He highlighted the importance of people being well-informed about history to avoid falling prey to false propaganda.\nAdditionally, the second day of the IHC session saw three simultaneous sessions. Prof Syed Ali Nadeem Rezavi, the Secretary of IHC, said that the sessions included 22 research papers on ‘Dalit history,’ over 10 papers on ‘Reconstructing Indian Economic History’ by the Aligarh Historians Society, and 12 papers presented at the IHC Panel on ‘Deccan: Past and Present.’",

    "text": "By Jason REDMOND with John BIERS in New York Jason Redmond ,\n7 hours ago Boeing workers who overwhelmingly voted to authorize a potential strike in July will vote again on Thursday on whether to follow through Jason Redmond Thousands of Boeing factory workers in the United States walked off the job Friday after voting overwhelmingly to reject a contract with the embattled aviation giant, its first strike in 16 years.\nUnion leaders called for the strike to start just after midnight on Friday (0700 GMT), hours after hourly workers in the Seattle region in the Pacific Northwest spurned the tentative contract with a vote of 94.6 percent and to strike with 96 percent.\nA strike will shutter two major plane assembly plants for the 737 MAX and 777 in the Puget Sound region and sidelines some 33,000 workers, further delaying the financially stressed company's turnaround efforts.\n\"Our members spoke loud and clear tonight,\" said Jon Holden, president of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751, after the vote.\n\"We strike at midnight.\"\nPicketers were out in front of the Renton plant -- where Boeing's flagship 737 Max aircraft is produced -- in the early hours of Friday, holding signs reading \"On strike against Boeing\", according to Bloomberg.\nThursday's vote was a decisive rejection of a deal that line workers said was far less generous than depicted by Boeing executives, marking the latest show of defiance by unions following earlier strikes in the auto, entertainment and other industries.\nBoeing said it was \"ready to get back to the table to reach a new agreement.\"\nLed by new CEO Kelly Ortberg, Boeing had hoped a 25 percent wage hike over four years and a commitment to invest in the Puget Sound region would be enough.\nOrtberg argued in a message to staff that the general wage hike marked the largest in history, and that a strike \"would put our shared recovery in jeopardy\".\nBut rank-and-file workers reacted with fury to the agreement, which was initially backed by IAM leadership.\n- 'Hollow' commitments -\nWorkers had sought a 40 percent wage hike and critics have said the 25 percent figure is inflated because the new deal also eliminates an annual company bonus.\nOther points of contention include the deal's failure to restore a pension, as well as Boeing's pledge to build its next plane in the Seattle region, which critics said offers no promises beyond the four-year contract.\n\"They're talking about a 25 percent increase and it's not,\" said Paul Janousek, an electrician in Everett who voted to strike.\nJanousek, 55, who has worked at Boeing for 13 years, figures his raise is only about nine percent after Boeing dropped the annual bonus.\nSome workers also expressed anger about Dennis Muilenburg and Dave Calhoun, two former CEOs who received multi-million dollar compensation even as the company faced turmoil upon their departure.\n\"Striking isn't ideal, but it's for the best for your long-term well-being,\" said Joe Philbin, a structural mechanic who has been at Boeing for six months.\nPhilbin said he will work side jobs if a strike drags out, but that he and his wife have been holding off on having kids until the situation stabilizes.\n\"(Boeing) is a huge company, they can survive paying the people who do the work a little more,\" he said.\n- Big impact from strike? -\nThe IAM's most recent stoppage, in 2008, lasted 57 days.\nAccording to analysts at TD Cowen, a 50-day strike would deprive Boeing of $3-3.5 billion in cash flow and would have a $5.5 billion impact on revenue.\nThe company's stock was down four percent in pre-market trading on Friday.\nRichard Aboulafia, managing director of the AeroDynamic Advisory consultancy, said a lengthy strike would damage Boeing's turnaround prospects, but noted that a 2023 strike at Boeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems lasted less than two weeks.\nBoeing has been under renewed scrutiny since a January incident in which a fuselage panel blew out of an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 MAX plane mid-flight, necessitating an emergency landing.\nHolden said he looked forward to getting back to the bargaining table.\nThursday's vote \"sends a strong message that our members deserve better,\" he said.\njmb/sw/st",

    "title": "Chlamydia vaccine shows promise in early trial",
    "text": "An early-stage clinical trial yielded promising results for a chlamydia vaccine, researchers reported Thursday in The Lancet Infectious Diseases. There is currently no vaccine to protect against the sexually transmitted infection, which is the most common bacterial STI in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2022, there were more than 1.6 million cases. Chlamydia remains one of the most common causes of infertility in women, said Dr. Jay Varma, professor of population health sciences at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City. Untreated, the infection — which usually doesn’t cause symptoms in women — can cause pelvic inflammatory disease, which can lead to scar tissue that makes it harder to get pregnant. “This is desperately needed,” said David Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors. “We have the highest STI rates in America since the 1950s and possibly beyond.” The bacteria can also cause an eye infection that’s responsible for vision loss in 1.9 million people worldwide. The phase 1 clinical trial, led by researchers in the United Kingdom and Denmark, found that the experimental vaccine was safe and induced an immune response. The study took place from 2020 through 2022 and participants were equally split between healthy men and women with an average age of 26. None had chlamydia. The researchers tested several different dosages for the vaccine, and participants got either the vaccine or a placebo on three separate days over a period of almost four months. Since the research on the vaccine is in the early stages, many questions remain. “Does it confer the ability to hold off infection with chlamydia?” said Dr. Hilary Reno, a professor of medicine at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and medical director of the St. Louis County Sexual Health Clinic. “If you do have an infection, does it mean you’re more likely to have an asymptomatic infection?” “We don’t know that and that’s what the next phase of studies would be,” she said. The researchers are now planning to launch a larger, phase 2 trial that would look at the vaccine’s effectiveness. The hope is that one day the vaccine would be able to prevent both infection in the reproductive system, as well as in the eyes, said Jes Dietrich, a senior scientist at Statens Serum Institut in Denmark and a lead author of the study. In addition to a shot in the arm, people in the study also got a vaccine in the form of an eye drop. “I was very pleasantly surprised because it’s really difficult to induce immunity in the eye,” Dietrich said. Varma, who was not involved with the clinical trial, said that “it’s exciting to see research on potentially effective vaccines for sexually transmitted infections.” There are already a handful of vaccines available to prevent certain sexually transmitted infections: the HPV vaccine, the hepatitis B vaccine and the mpox vaccine.",

    "text": "Hundeerziehung: Diese zwei größten Fehler unbedingt vermeiden\nZwei Fehler bei Hundebesitzern: Trainer Holger Schüler verrät, welche Bedürfnisse Vierbeiner wirklich haben – und worauf sie verzichten können.\nHundeprofi Holger Schüler, beobachtet häufig, dass unklare Regeln und widersprüchliche Signale zu Verunsicherung führen. Hunde benötigen vor allem eines: Beständigkeit. Im Interview mit Landtiere.de erklärt der Hundeerziehungsberater, warum Unzuverlässigkeit und Vermenschlichung zwei der größten Erziehungsfehler sind und wie man sie leicht vermeiden kann.\n1. Unzuverlässigkeit – wenn Regeln nicht gelten\nEin häufiger Fehler ist die Unzuverlässigkeit, wenn Regeln nicht konsequent angewendet werden. Viele Hundehalter meinen es gut, handeln jedoch inkonsequent. Einmal wird das Kommando „Nein“ strikt durchgesetzt, ein anderes Mal wird hingenommen, dass der Vierbeiner es ignoriert. Für den Hund bedeutet das Unsicherheit, da er nicht einschätzen kann, wann welche Regeln gelten. Schüler betont die Wichtigkeit von Konsequenz in der Hundeerziehung. „Wenn ich verlässlich sein möchte, dann zählt mein Wort. Wenn ich ‚Nein‘ sage, muss es auch Nein heißen – und wenn ich ‚Ja‘ sage, dann Ja“, betont der Experte.\nInkonsequente Erziehung führt dazu, dass der Hund nicht lernt, sich auf die Aussagen seines Menschen zu verlassen. Dies erschwert den Alltag und kann zu Verhaltensproblemen führen. Hunde benötigen klare Kommunikation und Sicherheit, die aus wiederkehrenden Mustern entsteht.\nHunde benötigen Klarheit und keine Ausnahmen. Holger Schüler veranschaulicht dies mit einem Vergleich: „Wenn meine Tochter nur für die Arbeit lernt, hat sie drei Wochen später alles wieder vergessen. Es muss immer und immer wieder gemacht werden – das ist Verlässlichkeit.“\nDarum sind Rituale so wichtig\nAuch Rituale sind für Hunde von großer Bedeutung. Ein Beispiel ist die Pfotenpflege. Viele Halter reinigen die Pfoten nur bei Regen oder sichtbarem Schmutz. Doch für den Hund ergibt sich daraus kein klares Muster. Wenn das nicht täglich und verlässlich gemacht wird, rennt er mit schmutzigen Pfoten in die Wohnung. „Ich putze meinen Hunden immer die Füße ab, egal ob schönes Wetter oder nicht. Wenn wir von draußen nach drinnen kommen, schaue ich sie mir an – das Ritual ist immer das gleiche“, erklärt Schüler. Diese Wiederholung schafft Sicherheit. Der Hund lernt: „Nach dem Spaziergang wird immer angehalten und die Pfoten werden kontrolliert.“ Dies hat mehrere Vorteile.\n- Die Pfotenpflege wird zur Normalität – und nicht zur unangenehmen Ausnahme.\n- Das Vertrauen in die Führung des Menschen wächst.\n- Unnötiger Stress wird vermieden, weil der Hund weiß, was auf ihn zukommt.\nNoch mehr spannende Tier-Themen finden Sie in unserem kostenlosen Partner-Newsletter von Landtiere.de, den Sie gleich hier abonnieren können.\n2. Vermenschlichung – der Hund ist kein Mensch\nEin weiterer häufiger Fehler ist die Vermenschlichung des Hundes. Viele Halter glauben, dass der Hund „doch wissen müsse“, was richtig oder falsch ist. Dabei wird oft vergessen, dass Hunde anders denken als Menschen. Sie handeln instinktiv, reagieren auf direkte Konsequenzen und benötigen Wiederholungen, um dauerhaft zu lernen. Schüler warnt: „Ich darf dem Hund nicht vorgaukeln, dass er schon wissen muss, was er zu tun oder zu lassen hat.“",

    "text": "Küchenrollen sind zwar praktisch, teilweise aber auch gefährlich. Im Kontakt mit Lebensmitteln sollten Verbraucher deshalb einige Dinge beachten. Dortmund – In deutschen Küchen ist Küchenrolle kaum wegzudenken. Schnell befindet sie sich beim Abtupfen von Obst, beim Auffangen von Fett oder beim Trocknen von Lebensmitteln im Einsatz. Doch was praktisch erscheint, kann beim Kontakt mit Lebensmitteln problematisch sein, wie Untersuchungen zeigen.\nKüchenrolle lieber nicht verwenden Küchenrollen sind praktische Helfer, doch laut Öko-Test eignen sich längst nicht alle Produkte für den Kontakt mit Lebensmitteln. In einem Test hat das Verbraucherschutzmedium in zehn von 18 Küchenrollen Chlorpropanol 3-MCPD nachgewiesen – eine chemische Verbindung, die für den menschlichen Körper gefährlich sein kann.\n3-MCPD entsteht als Nebenprodukt bei der Herstellung von Papier, wenn sogenannte Epichlorhydrinharze eingesetzt werden. Diese Kunstharze sorgen dafür, dass das Papier auch im feuchten Zustand stabil bleibt. Doch nicht alle Hersteller arbeiten dabei gleich sorgfältig, sodass Rückstände im Endprodukt verbleiben können, wie Öko-Test erklärt.\nLebensmittel besser nicht mit Küchenrolle abtupfen: Inhaltsstoff ist „möglicherweise krebserregend“ Das in einigen Küchenrollen nachgewiesene Chlorpropanol 3-MCPD wird laut der Internationalen Agentur für Krebsforschung (IARC) als „möglicherweise krebserregend für den Menschen“ eingestuft. In Tierversuchen hat sich gezeigt, dass 3-MCPD Nieren und Hoden schädigen kann.\nDie Aufnahme der chemischen Verbindung erfolgt über den Kontakt mit Lebensmitteln. Beispielsweise, wenn Verbraucher feuchte Speisen mit Küchenrollen abtupfen – diese landet zudem oft im falschen Müll .\nSchon zwei Blatt Küchenpapier, die 24 Stunden in einem Liter Wasser liegen, können laut Öko-Test bis zu 12 Mikrogramm 3-MCPD abgeben – bei einem 60 Kilogramm schweren Menschen entspricht dies bereits einem Zehntel der tolerierbaren täglichen Aufnahmemenge.\nKüchenrolle besser nicht verwenden: Das sollten Verbraucher beim Kauf beachten Die genaue Gefährdungslage bleibt jedoch unklar, da nicht bekannt ist, wie viel Chlorpropanol bei kurzem Kontakt in Lebensmittel übergeht. Neben 3-MCPD können aber noch weitere halogenorganische Verbindungen in Küchenpapier enthalten sein, die aus der Chlorbleiche oder dem verwendeten Altpapier stammen. Das gesundheitliche Risiko könnte dadurch weiter steigen.\nÖko-Test rät deshalb, beim Kauf im Supermarkt oder Discounter auf Küchenrollen aus Altpapier zu setzen und auf die Zertifizierung „Blauer Engel“ zu achten. Diese Produkte sind meist umweltfreundlicher und enthalten normalerweise weniger problematische Rückstände.",

    "text": "Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) president and the former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati on July 12 welcomed the decision of the Delhi University Vice Chancellor to reject a proposal to include 'Manusmriti' in the syllabus of its Law Faculty . Ms. Mayawati stated that strong opposition was natural and the decision to cancel this proposal was a welcome step.\n\"Strong opposition to the proposal to teach Manusmriti in the Law Department of Delhi University, which goes against the honour and dignity of the Indian Constitution and its egalitarian and welfare objectives, is natural and the decision to cancel this proposal is a welcome step,\" she said in a post on social media platform X.\nShe further stated that the Manusmriti doesn't match the principles on which Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar composed the Indian Constitution and such attempts to include the Manusmriti in the curriculum were not appropriate.\n\"His Holiness Baba Saheb Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar composed the universally accepted Indian Constitution, especially keeping the self-respect of the neglected people and women as well as humanism and secularism at the core, which does not match with Manusmriti at all. Therefore, any such attempt is not appropriate at all,\" Ms. Mayawati further stated.\nOn Thursday, Delhi University Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Yogesh Singh, announced that the proposal to include the Sanskrit text 'Manusmriti' or Laws of Manu, which belongs to the Dharmastra literary tradition of Hinduism, in the LLB curriculum was rejected.\n\"Yesterday, some information came to us that Manusmriti will be part of the Law Faculty course (in DU). I inquired and talked to the Delhi University Vice Chancellor. He assured me that some law faculty members have proposed some changes in the jurisprudence chapter. But when the proposal came to the Delhi University administration, today there is an Academic Council meeting. There is no endorsement of any such proposal by the authentic body of the Academic Council. Yesterday itself, the Vice Chancellor rejected that proposal. We are all committed to our Constitution and to a futuristic approach. The government is committed to upholding the true spirit and letter of the Constitution. There is no question of including any controversial portion of any script,\" said Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan.\nRead Comments Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit READ LATER Remove SEE ALL PRINT",
