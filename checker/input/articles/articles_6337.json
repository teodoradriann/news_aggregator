    "title": "Maine's Democrat Governor Janet Mills is branded a LIAR by the National Weather Service after she claimed they didn't warn her historic storm would bring up to six inches of rain | Daily Mail Online",
    "text": "Maine 's Democrat Governor Janet Mills has been branded a liar by the National Weather Service after claiming its forecasters didn't warn her about a historic storm. The esteemed federal agency lashed Mills after she was slammed for failing to adequately warn locals that up to half a foot of rain would fall on December 18, causing huge floods and leaving 400,000 without power. Mills put her foot in it last Wednesday while touring flood-battered Kennebec County, saying: 'The National Weather Service did not predict five or six inches of rain in any community in Maine.' But a NWS spokesman said the 75 year-old lawmaker was talking nonsense, insisting state and local officials had been briefed about the impending inundation on December 15. And on Sunday the 17th - the day before the storm - the weather service met with state officials to further brief them on expected flooding, winds, and impact to the state's coast line. Governor Janet Mills is catching flack for saying the National Weather Service did not adequately predict the severe dimensions of the winter storm that hit Maine last week Cars are flooded in a parking lot at the Hathaway Creative Center alongside the Kennebec River, Tuesday, Dec. 19, 2023, in Waterville, Maine Mills and her office have not yet responded to the NWS's claims that she is a liar. Images of the storm's aftermath show cars hanging off extremely damaged roads, intense, murky floodwaters that swept other vehicles away, collapsed construction sites, and downed trees and powerlines. The storm, which Mills called 'an extraordinary event,' barreled into the Northeast on Monday, knocking out power to hundreds of thousands of people, forcing flight cancellations, and killing at least four people. Wind gusts reaches nearly 70 miles per hour, which Mills also said the National Weather Service did not predict. 'The National Weather Service did not predict 68-70 mile an hour winds in any area of Maine,' she said. 'It was an extraordinary event.' In fact, the NWS does seem to have predicted possible winds of 65-70 miles per hour at the same time that they predicted four-to-six inches of rain. Earlier this week, Mills announced the launch of an online resource for Maine residents who were hit hard by the flood and other storm damage. The Maine Flood Resources and Assistance Hub was launched on Tuesday. According to the governor's office, it will aggregate 'information, resources, and assistance' for those impacted by the storm.

The severity of the storm's damage prompted Mills to request a Major Disaster Declaration from President Joe Biden, which will allow federal resources to supplement the recovery efforts led by the state. 'In the wake of last week’s storm, my Administration has launched the Maine Flood Resources and Assistance Hub to help Maine people with questions they may have about property damage, road safety, tree removal, and more,' Mills said in the news release about the resource hub. 'We will update this website as more information becomes available as part of our effort to do all we can to support the swiftest possible recovery of Maine communities.' The governor also announced Tuesday that the Federal Emergency Management Agency has approved the Maine Emergency Management Agency's request to begin an preliminary damage assessment, which is the first formal step toward request the aforementioned Major Disaster Declaration.",

Pero que sigan, que sigan.\n[#10](c10#c-10) y eso que allí ponen todos los impedimentos posibles para que la gente no vote (sobre todo los grupos poblacionales que no suelen votar a los republicanos).\n[#1](c1#c-1) Positivo por el elefante uso del imperativo del verbo ir con el enclético \"os\". Aunque la real academia admite desde hace años \"iros\" y todos recordamos con cariño aquel \"si me queréis, irse\" de la gran Lola no es menos cierto que \"Idos a tomar por culo\" destila elegancia, clasicismo, ritmo, gracia y donaire en cada sílaba.\n[#9](c9#c-9) No hay ningún clasismo, todo lo contrario, está reconociendo la dureza de ese trabajo y el mérito que tiene hacerlo.\nEs como si dijera \"preferiría trabajar en la mina\". Se refiere a la dureza del trabajo.\nNo va a decir \"preferiría trabajar como CEO de un eléctrica\", lo cual no suena a trabajo físico duro.\nNingún clasismo, pero lo dice elpanfleto.es, manipulando, y os lo tragáis todo sin masticar. Qué pena. Un poquito de capacidad crítica no os vendría mal, deberíais intentarlo, aunque os cueste, debido a que hay que pensar y eso no es fácil para vosotros. Es más fácil formar parte del rebaño.\nCreo que les ha retratado muy bien. Estoy un poco cansado de eldiario pero este artículo es bastante adecuado.\n[#0](c0#c-0) gracias\n[#2](c2#c-2) Tranquilo, tienen todo el escudo mediático. No lo verás en el telediario de A3, salvo que esa misma frase la hubiera dicho una alcaldesa del PSOE o de SUMAR.\n[#5](c5#c-5) Al hilo de lo que dices, hoy he visto las noticias de la noche de A·, con Vicente Vallés, y, en algún momento creía que le iba a dar un infarto: los independentistas, Bildu, traición del PSOE, traición de Sánchez y así así... Uno, si sigue escuchando cree que va a llegar el final de la democracia y el apocalipsis, como mínimo.\n[#6](c6#c-6) es indecente lo de ese señor... verlo vomitar bilis de esa manera, da muchisima grima, no se como no le aconseja alguien que se modere un poco\nA mí el que me hace gracia es Feijó diciendo que el PSOE ya no es un partido constitucionalista.\nPues no sé, creo que debió quedarse dormido en el artículo 1 porque en el 140 ya te dice de forma general cómo se eligen los concejales y como son éstos los que eligen a un alcalde.\nEn fin, que habrá quien le compre el discurso, pero no hay por donde cogerlo",

    "title": "Former Michigan CIO shares 4 keys to effective technology leadership",
    "text": "Laura McCain Patterson is no stranger to transformational change in higher education. As the associate vice president and chief information officer at the University of Michigan from 2009 to 2016, Patterson led the university’s NextGen Michigan initiative, a massive project to transform Michigan’s operations and IT infrastructure. Since she retired, she’s mentored and coached higher education technology leaders nationwide through MOR Associates programs.\nLaura McCain Patterson On Tuesday, Patterson shared some of the hard-earned wisdom she’s gained from decades of experience leading large institutions through times of change with hundreds of online and in-person attendees at UW–‍Madison’s 2024 Information & Technology Leadership Conference in the Discovery Building.\n“No amount of money can make you successful. It’s leadership,” Patterson said. “You can spend all the money in the world, and without technology leadership, you may not be successful. And I’m not talking about the CIO or senior directors; I’m talking about each of you in this room.”\nPatterson cited UW–‍Madison’s “breathtaking” and “audacious” plans in the Wisconsin RISE Initiative and Administrative Transformation Program as examples of transformational change requiring strong IT leadership in the coming years. “If you are successful, when people look back on the history of the university, this will be a point in time that people will see significant advancements were made here, driven by technology.”\nDrawing from her experience leading initiatives like NextGen Michigan, Patterson outlined 4 “critical capabilities” that technology leaders need to be successful:\nFormer University of Michigan Chief Information Officer Laura McCain Patterson gave the keynote address at the 11th annual Information & Technology Leadership Conference on December 3. (Photo by Justin Masuga / DoIT) Strategic thinking: Stay focused on the big picture “Leaders set the direction. And to set the direction, you need to get above the day-to-day fray,” Patterson said.\nShe encouraged leaders to begin every meeting with a reminder of their broader mission. “It’s important for you to be a strategic leader in your department, understand the big goals, and then bring your department along.”\nKeeping people focused on the big picture will help minimize disagreements about details that can delay projects and encourage finding common solutions, she said.\nCollaboration: ‘It’s all about relationships’ “Research shows that productive collaboration occurs when: 1) there is trust and respect among participants, 2) there is a shared goal, and 3) conflict gets resolved,” Patterson said.\n“You can’t collaborate with people you don’t know. Because you need to trust and respect them,” she explains. “It’s more than coming together to share ideas. It’s coming together to actually achieve results.”\nNoting that UW–‍Madison already has a strong foundation through the community-building efforts of IT Connects , Patterson urges IT professionals to continue making new connections and expanding their professional networks.\nHundreds of UW–‍Madison IT professionals attended the conference in person at the Discovery Building and online. (Photo by Justin Masuga / DoIT) Leading change: ‘Be more than a technology leader’ “Technology is emerging faster than humans can understand and absorb it,” Patterson observes. “And so it’s up to us as the technology leaders to be the leaders of change.”\nGood IT leaders help people understand “the why and the how” when change is coming. “People need to buy in both intellectually and emotionally” — to understand why change is necessary and how it will affect them.\nPatterson emphasizes the importance of understanding how to look at change from different perspectives. That means trying to understand how the change will impact people throughout the organization and evaluating the change through strategic, political, and cultural lenses to anticipate problems that could derail your project.\nTake care of yourself and others: ‘Develop a strategy for remaining resilient’ Many folks in IT pride themselves on having “grit” an ability to push through when things get tough. “But grit without a strategy for resilience can lead to burnout,” Patterson said. “So make an intentional effort to hang on to the things that bring you joy.”\nShe advises IT leaders to make intentional efforts to regularly “take your change temperature” and the temperature of the people you work with. Monitor yourself and others for signs of fatigue and stress and take action early if you start spotting the signs of burnout.\n“No matter how busy you are, no matter the deadlines coming at you, carve out time to continue to do those things that make you tick. That’s how you become resilient. And that’s how you can stay strong for yourself and the others that you are working with.”\nPatterson concluded by sharing her ongoing commitment to higher education: “I believe so strongly, now more than ever, in the value that universities bring. I believe in education. I believe in the importance of it for individuals, the importance for democracy, the importance for society.”",

    "text": "Gov. Kathy Hochul Thursday announced that 1,400 households will benefit from more than $46 million in grant awards to support affordable homeownership. The grants will help low- and moderate-income families make repairs or safety upgrades to their homes, replace manufactured homes, and provide down payment assistance for first-time buyers. The grants – administered by New York State Homes and Community Renewal’s Office of Community Renewal – were awarded to nonprofit organizations and localities to help preserve affordable housing, support veterans and older New Yorkers, increase access to homeownership, and strengthen local economies. Central New York is the recipient of over $4 million in awards and will serve a proposed 109 units. The City of Cortland and the Village of Homer will receive $500,00 and $480,000 respectively to help with projects that improve communities and benefit their residents. Housing grants can be used for housing rehabilitation of owner-occupied or renter-occupied homes, down payment assistance for low- and moderate-income first-time homebuyers, and private water/wastewater system assistance for low- and moderate-income homeowners. Home Headquarters Inc. and Onondaga County Community Development will receive $239,200 and $150,000 respectively to make homes accessible for low- and moderate-income persons with disabilities so that they can continue living safely and comfortably in their residences or return to live in their residences instead of in an institutional setting. Cayuga County Homsite Development Corp. and Stoneleigh Housing, Inc. will receive $500,000 and $200,000 respectively to assist senior citizen homeowners with the cost of addressing emergencies and code violations that pose a threat to their health and safety or affect the livability of the home. Assistance for the cost of these critical repairs enables seniors to continue to live independently in their homes. Covenant Housing Corp. of Central New York, Community Action Program for Madison County, the City of Fulton and Cayuga County Homsite Development Corp. will receive $400,000, $429,670, $585,500 and $700,000 respectively to acquire and/or rehabilitate single-family housing, provide down payment assistance, replace dilapidated mobile and manufactured homes as well as provide tenant-based rental assistance to households with incomes at or below 80 percent of Area Median Income. “As housing costs continue to rise, this significant investment will help carve out a path to affordable homeownership for 1,400 New York families,” Hochul said. “My administration is using every tool at our disposal to address the state’s housing crisis, and we will continue to push forward on programs, strategies, and funding initiatives that put New Yorkers in safe, affordable homes.”",

    "title": "Rivers remain high in parts of northern and central Europe after heavy rain — Naharnet",
    "text": "Parts of northern and central Europe continued to grapple with flooding on Thursday after heavy rain. A barrier near the German city of Magdeburg was opened for the first time in a decade to ease pressure from the Elbe River, and some animals were removed from their enclosures at a safari park in northern Germany.\nThis week's floods have prompted evacuations of dozens or hundreds of people in parts of northern and central Germany, but largely dry weather was forecast on Thursday. Still, water levels on some rivers caused concern, and they have continued to rise in parts of Lower Saxony state in the northwest.\nThe Elbe was nearly 4 meters (13 feet) above its normal level in Dresden, German news agency dpa reported. Downstream, the Pretziener Wehr, a flood barrier built in the 1870s on a branch of the river and renovated in 2010, was opened for the first time since large-scale floods in 2013.\nThe aim was to divert about a third of the river's water into a 21-kilometer (13-mile) channel that bypasses the town of Schoenebeck and Saxony-Anhalt's state capital, Magdeburg.\nIn Lower Saxony, the Serengeti-Park on the swollen Meisse River in the town of Hodenhagen faced flooding that began to affect some animal enclosures. Lemurs, prairie dogs and meerkats were moved to other parts of the grounds. Temporary dikes were put up to protect other enclosures.\nTo the south in Germany's Thuringia region, several hundred inhabitants of the village of Windehausen who evacuated earlier this week were cleared to return home after power was restored.\nIn the neighboring Netherlands, the Rhine peaked far above normal levels early Thursday at Lobith village on the German border but was expected to drop significantly over the next week, authorities said. Other branches of the Rhine around the low-lying country were expected to peak Thursday as the high waters move toward the sea.\nEmergency workers in the Dutch town of Deventer, forecast to be the hardest hit, heaped sandbags along the Ijssel River and closed roads to prepare for flooding. Several flood plains were underwater in the eastern Netherlands as rivers surged in recent days.\nIn Hungary, the Danube spilled over its banks in Budapest and was expected to peak in the capital on Thursday. Heavy rain has compounded the effects of melting snow.\nWhile some smaller rivers in western Hungary have started to recede, water levels on the Danube are predicted to fall slowly, with the peak downstream in southern Hungary coming only on New Year's Eve on Sunday.",

    "text": "Tories ‘writing off’ young people as growing number ‘economically inactive’\nThe number of young people out of work due to long-term sickness has doubled since 2010, figures show.\nThe Tories are “writing off” young people, Labour has said, with the number of young people out of work due to “long-term sickness” doubling since 2010.\nSir Keir Starmer’s party said that in 2010/11, there were 116,000 16 to 24-year-olds out of work or not looking for employment due to long-term sickness.\nThe latest Office for National Statistics (ONS) data for the whole of the UK now puts this number at 235,000 people out of work, the party said.\nShadow work and pensions secretary Liz Kendall said: “By neglecting the foundations needed for a healthy economy, the Tories are writing off hundreds of thousands of young people.”\nThe Labour MP said her party would ensure young people do not fall between the cracks between services and Government departments.\nIt hopes that improving mental health services, as well as reducing NHS waiting lists and strengthening workers’ rights, will help tackle the “root causes” of economic inactivity.\nMs Kendall said: “Labour will tackle the root causes of economic inactivity, including the mental health crisis facing so many of our young people.\n“We will transform mental health services, drive down NHS waiting lists, boost skills, bolster employment rights and provide tailored job support.”\nChancellor Jeremy Hunt and Work and Pensions Secretary Mel Stride have both sought to get people of all ages back into the workplace, in a bid to boost labour supply across the UK.\nThe proportion of people out of work rose since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, but the issue is also seen to be caused by a broader set of factors including rising disability and long-term sickness levels.\nA Government spokesperson said: “We are driving down inactivity and helping young people into work as we build on our track record of youth unemployment falling by 43% since 2010.\n“We are investing £2.3 billion into mental health services and supporting more 16 and 17-year-olds to participate in education and apprenticeships.\n“More widely our Back to Work Plan will help up to 1.1 million people with long-term health conditions, disabilities or long-term unemployed to look for and stay in work.”\nA Conservative spokesman accused Labour of having a “brass neck”, saying the party had “never left office with unemployment lower than what they inherited”.",

    "text": "It feels like we are just getting settled in with Windows 11, which just crested its two-year anniversary in October of last year. However, Windows 12 is expected to land sometime in 2024, shaking up the release cycle for Microsoft and bringing a slew of new features and a reworked design. Though we can't disclose anything official about it yet, one designer made a mockup called Windows XP 2024 Edition, which is everything Windows 12 should be.\nWindows XP came to market in 2001, garnering mass support and appeal. XP was so pervasive, it had more active users than Windows 8.X in 2015. Microsoft finally took the OS out back in 2019, ending a 17-year lifespan leading up to Windows 10 and now Windows 11. However, there is still some nostalgia for the now-relic of Windows past. As such, designer AR 4789 decided to come up with an updated version of Windows XP if it were to come out in 2024, which you can see below.\nIt is safe to say that while the design is not all that dissimilar from Windows 11 , it just brings back the look and feel of Windows XP. Moreover, it simplifies everything, which is a core problem some people face with newer operating systems. That and the fact that the Start Menu is not internet-connected are big wins in our book. Even the settings menu is improved with a look and feel like a crossover between the two operating systems.\nAt the end of the day, it would be sweet to be able to play with this and see how it feels in the real world, but sadly, it is just a UI concept. However, maybe Microsoft will take some design ideas from this and make it a reality with Windows 12, which would be cool. We will have to wait and see, but in the meantime, let us know what you think of this concept in the comments below.\nComments Tags: Microsoft , Windows XP , (nasdaq:msft) , windows 12 ",
