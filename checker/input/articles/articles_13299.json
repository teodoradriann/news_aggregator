    "text": "Liberty Fund announced today that Gordon Wood, the noted historian of the American Revolution, is the winner of the inaugural George F. Will Award for the Advancement of Liberty and the Free Society.\nCARMEL, Ind., April 18, 2024 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Liberty Fund announced today that Gordon Wood, the noted historian of the American Revolution, is the winner of the inaugural George F. Will Award for the Advancement of Liberty and the Free Society. He received his award at a ceremony and dinner in Washington, D.C., on April 17, 2024. It was presented to him by George F. Will and Mitch Daniels, a senior adviser to the Liberty Fund, president emeritus of Purdue University and a former governor of Indiana.\n\"Gordon Wood and George F. Will are two titans of American thought,\" Liberty Fund Board Chairman Nate Feltman said. \"It is a real privilege to honor these great writers in this way. Throughout their extraordinary careers, Professor Wood and Mr. Will have both shown us that ideas have consequences. They have helped us understand our country's roots, and inspired us to think about the meaning of the Founding for today.\"\n\"The Award celebrates original thinkers who, like George F. Will, have made exceptional contributions to the public's understanding of individual liberty, markets, self-government, constitutional government, and the rule of law,\" explained Liberty Fund's President and CEO, Sean Shelby.\nGordon Wood is the Alva O. Way University Professor and Professor of History Emeritus at Brown University. Previously, he has won the Pulitzer Prize, the Bancroft Prize, and the National Humanities Medal for his impressive scholarship and writing. His books include The Creation of the American Republic, The Radicalism of the American Revolution, and Friends Divided: Thomas Jefferson and John Adams.\nProfessor Wood has had a significant influence on the broader world of ideas, where his teaching and writing have encouraged a renewed approach to the study and appreciation of the ideal of liberty and to the originality and radicalism of the founding of the American republic.\n\"More than any other historian of his generation, Professor Wood was the single most important scholar to bring forth and revitalize the rich history of republican ideas and their implications,\" said Liberty Fund senior fellow Hans Eicholz. \"Through his close study of American and British pamphlets, he unearthed a whole trove of historical complexity in both moral and political thought that formed the very underpinnings of American self-government from the late colonial period forward.\"\nLiberty Fund is a private educational foundation established by Indiana philanthropist Pierre Goodrich in 1960. Today, Liberty Fund pursues Goodrich's vision through programs inspired by his educational philosophy, including more than 6,000 Socratic colloquia and the publication of almost 500 classic books.\nMedia Contact\nSarah Skwire, Liberty Fund, 1 800-866-3520,\n[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c4b7b7afb3adb6a184a8ada6a1b6b0bda2b1aaa0eaabb6a3), https://www.libertyfund.org/\nSOURCE Liberty Fund",

    "title": "Important warning over temperature you shouldn’t walk your dog in as heatwave is set to hit the UK",
    "text": "Experts are reminding pet owners to take caution over walking their dogs as the weather heats up this weekend. Brits are set for a scorcher this weekend - with temperatures expected to reach 26°C in parts of the [UK](https://www.ladbible.com/uk-news). But with the [weather](https://www.ladbible.com/weather) finally heating up and summer around the corner, pet owners are being warned to take care when walking their [dogs](https://www.ladbible.com/dogs) in the sunshine. Now, if you're a dog owner, then you'll probably know it's a huge no-no to walk your dog in the heat - especially in the middle of the day when the sun is at its hottest. Advert But how hot is too hot? Well, Vets Now [explain](https://www.vets-now.com/summer/your-dog-walking-temperature-guide/): \"Planning on walking dogs in hot weather? It’s generally safe in temperatures of up to 19°C (68°F) but be careful when the mercury rises above this. \"Even at temperatures as low as 20°C (70°F) dogs are at risk of [heat stroke](https://www.ladbible.com/health).\" Between 20 and 23°C, dogs are at risk of heat stroke if exercised too vigorously, or if they're suffering from an underlying condition such as obesity or breathing difficulties. And when the mercury rises even higher, to between 24 and 27°C, dogs who are flat-faced breeds, obese or very young will find the temperatures extremely uncomfortable, with Vets Now warning that extreme caution should be taken. Advert At 28-31°C, the risk becomes life-threatening, with experts warning larger breeds , puppies and those who are flat-faced or obese are particularly at risk. Anything above 32°C and all dogs - regardless of breed - face a life-threatening risk of heat stroke. Ultimately, a temperature above 19°C carries a risk, so it's best to err on the side of caution. To help minimise the dangers, you should avoid walking your dog between the hours of 10am and 4pm, when the sun is at its hottest. Symptoms of heat stroke can include excessive panting, drooling, shaking, rapid breathing, restlessness, and an inability to stand up, as well as being lethargic, having a lack of appetite and generally not acting like themselves. Advert Pet owners should also watch out for their pooch's paws, too. Different surfaces trap heat more than others, and can therefore damage the soles of their paws under the [blazing hot sun](https://www.ladbible.com/weather). If it would hurt you to walk on tarmac and sand in the sun, then it’s going to hurt them, too. So it’s often better to walk your pets on grass instead of pavement in the summer months.Featured Image Credit: Getty stock image",

    "text": "Photo: X/ @omney Friday, October 11\nNorthern lights illuminate the night skies over Berlin\nLast night, the skies above Berlin lit up. Vast illuminations of pink, purple, green and blue could be seen as the rare celestial phenomenon of the northern lights shone in the midnight sky. The solar spectacle was visible in Berlin and the northern part of Brandenburg until clouds rolled in at some point in the early hours of the morning and ended the spectacle.\nAlso known as aurora borealis, the northern lights occur when solar particles like electrons and protons are thrown up by violent eruptions on the surface of the sun. As they arrive in the earth’s atmosphere they ionise, emitting light of various colours and complexities. Normally these colours are only visible in the far north, but periodically such solar spectacles become visible at other latitudes due to particularly strong solar activity.\nAnd there might be more coming. 2025 is predicted to be a year of strong solar activity, so Berliners may expect to see more of the aurora borealis.",

    "text": "Photo by Iiris L on Unsplash\nPortland International Airport Welcomes Therapy Llamas\nDecember 28, 2023\nDealing with holiday travel chaos just got more bearable thanks to a unique initiative taken at the Portland International Airport in Oregon. The\nairport has welcomed a comforting pair of therapy llamas to help ease the stress of holiday travelers — introducing a refreshing blend of amusement and tranquility amidst the holiday frenzy.\nThese therapeutic llamas, named Beni and Prince, have been invited to the airport on three separate occasions this month. The duo hails from Mountain Peaks Therapy Llamas & Alpacas, a farm known for its therapeutic animals, and their visits have stirred quite a buzz on\nsocial media. Their delightfully unexpected presence at the airport has been celebrated for its novelty and the positive vibes it has generated, further enhancing Portland’s reputation for embracing unconventionality.\nTherapy animals are often used to alleviate stress and anxiety, and their application at airports has grown in popularity in recent years. Weighing in at 400 pounds each, these gentle giants have been meandering through the airport terminals, providing a soothing distraction for passengers amidst the holiday rush.\nAllison Ferre, the media relations manager with the Port of Portland, the organization that runs the airport, mentioned that partnering with various therapy animal programs throughout the year has proven to be a great stress-buster for passengers. Expressing her appreciation, she said, “The llamas deliver instant joy.”\nThe airport’s social media channel has also shared about the llamas’ cheerful presence. Adding to their charm, Beni and Prince were adorned with a festive reindeer theme featuring antler headbands, glittery halters with tinkling bells, and wreaths decorated with poinsettias.\nWe took an unconventional approach to helping travelers manage holiday travel stress and it got a lot of love. It was wonderful to see the smiles these Therapy Llamas brought to PDX visitors and beyond!

    "text": "> LONDON, Dec 29 — Three people died yesterday after their car fell into a river in northern England, local police said, as Storm Gerrit battered much of the UK.\nEmergency services headed to the River Esk near the town of Glaisdale shortly before midday (1200 GMT), after reports that a vehicle had fallen into the river.\n“The vehicle was recovered from the river by the fire service just after 3:00 pm. Sadly, the three men inside have died,” North Yorkshire Police said.\nAnother man who had tried to help them was recovered unharmed, it said, adding that the weather conditions were “making driving hazardous”.\nAdvertisement Several regions of the UK, particularly Scotland and northern England, have been badly hit by Storm Gerrit since Wednesday, which has brought heavy rain and snow.\nWinds of up to 136 kilometres per hour (85 miles per hour) were recorded in Aberdeenshire in Scotland.\nThe UK’s Met Office said a supercell thunderstorm caused damage in Greater Manchester on Wednesday night, with features suggesting “a tornado at the surface was likely”.\nAdvertisement Thousands of homes remained without power in Scotland on Thursday afternoon, while rail and air transport were disrupted with trains and flights cancelled.\nFerry services between Dover and France also suffered delays on Wednesday due to strong winds in the Channel. — AFP",
