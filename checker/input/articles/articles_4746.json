    "title": "Cross-Border Justice: Saudi Arrest in 2022 Murder Case Aids Pakistan with Interpol's Help",
    "text": "International collaboration between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, facilitated by Interpol, has led to the significant arrest of a man accused of murder in 2022, highlighting the reach and efficiency of global law enforcement efforts. DPO DG Khan Ahmad Mohyiuddin announced on Thursday the arrest of\nMuhammad Akhtar, accused of killing Muhammad Javed over suspicions of illicit relations with a woman, showcasing the persistent pursuit of justice across borders.\nCollaborative Efforts Yield Results\nThe case, which originated from a violent crime in 2022 where Muhammad Akhtar allegedly used a Kalashnikov to kill Muhammad Javed, was propelled into the international arena when the accused fled to Saudi Arabia. The relentless pursuit by DG Khan's police, under the guidance of DPO Ahmad Mohyuddin, led to the successful issuance of red warrants through Interpol. This pivotal moment underscores the critical role of international cooperation in tackling cross-border criminal activities.\nLegal Proceedings and International Cooperation\nInspector Legal Asif Iqbal Rana and SHO Kot Mubarak Arshad Ali played instrumental roles in navigating the complex legal channels to have Akhtar declared a proclaimed offender, which was a necessary step before the issuance of red warrants. Their efforts, in accordance with the instructions from DPO Mohyuddin, not only exemplify the commitment of DG Khan's police force to uphold justice but also the effectiveness of international law enforcement partnerships in apprehending fugitives beyond their national borders.\nCommitment to Justice and Security\nDPO Ahmad Mohyuddin's statement post-arrest reflects a broader commitment to justice and the rule of law, emphasizing the dedication to providing justice through due legal processes. The arrest of Muhammad Akhtar serves as a testament to the police's determination to tighten the noose around criminals, irrespective of their location. This case also highlights the critical role of Interpol in facilitating cross-border cooperation among member countries, ensuring that justice prevails across geographical boundaries.\nThis landmark arrest not only brings closure to a tragic case but also sends a strong message about the global commitment to justice. It reaffirms the notion that criminals cannot evade the law by crossing borders, bolstering public confidence in international law enforcement collaborations. As this case progresses, it will undoubtedly serve as a precedent for future cross-border criminal pursuits, emphasizing the world's shrinking space for those who seek to escape the reach of justice.",

    "text": "In today's Miss Manners column, advice columnist Judith Martin responds to a wedding guest with a dairy allergy. You can send your questions to Miss Manners through her email, dearmissmanners@gmail.com.\nBy Judith Martin, Nicholas Ivor Martin and Jacobina Martin DEAR MISS MANNERS: I am allergic to all dairy products, so I must be careful to avoid consuming any foods containing milk, cream, butter or cheese. Because the presence of dairy is not always obvious, I must often inquire about ingredients in a given dish when I am away from my own kitchen. I make these inquiries as gently and respectfully as I can, and I certainly do not expect that my dietary needs will always be accommodated. As awareness of food allergies has grown in recent years, I have found that hosts often inquire about the dietary needs of their guests. For large catered events, it is increasingly common to ask attendees about food allergies. While I’m grateful for such consideration, I recognize and accept that it won’t be extended in every situation. I attended a lovely wedding that included a full dinner served at the table. Well before the start of the dinner service, I identified a leader of the catering team, approached him at a moment where he did not appear to be engaged in other tasks, and asked if he could tell me which items on the dinner menu contained dairy products. I did not ask for a special accommodation; I simply asked for information. He told me he would check and get back to me. In a follow-up conversation, the caterer informed me which dishes contained dairy, but then scolded me, saying, “If you wanted a dairy-free meal, you should have requested that in advance.” For this particular event, the hosts did not ask guests about their dietary needs, as is their prerogative, so I felt it would be impolite and inappropriate to request an accommodation. Should I have asked my hosts for a dairy-free meal even though they did not offer it? Was it impolite for me to request information regarding ingredients from the catering staff?\nGENTLE READER: This caterer was looking for a fight. Miss Manners assures you that you were polite. If you had wanted to impress that upon him, you could have said, “I was not given the option and did not want to assume you could make a special meal for me. The information you gave was all that I needed; thank you.”\n(Please send your questions to Miss Manners at her website, www.missmanners.com ; to her email, dearmissmanners@gmail.com ; or through postal mail to Miss Manners, Andrews McMeel Syndication, 1130 Walnut St., Kansas City, MO 64106.)\nIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

    "text": "> José Manuel Vidal, director de 'Religión digital': \"Casi todos los papas condicionan a su sucesor\" El Papa Francisco, desde el Hospital Gemelli de Roma, pide “que se siga rezando por él\" El papa Francisco sufre un neumonía bilateral: su cuadro clínico sigue siendo \"complejo\" El papa Francisco tiene una neumonía bilateral y continúa ingresado en el Hospital Policlínico Gemelli. Según conocimos este lunes, su estado de salud empeoró y por eso ya se está empezando a poner sobre la mesa el supuesto de la sucesión. José Manuel Vidal, director de ‘Religión digital’ , analiza la situación en ‘La mirada crítica’.\nVidal explica que, siempre que hay “cualquier ruido de enfermedad o incluso antes” se empieza a preparar la sucesión del pontífice . “En Roma se funciona con una especie de partidos eclesiásticos: el progresista, el moderado, el conservador… Están continuamente haciendo lobby, invirtiendo dinero para promover a un candidato o a otro”, cuenta.\nTambién es habitual que los papas condicionan de cierta manera a su sucesor . Vidal lo explica: “Condicionan a su sucesor porque eligen a los cardenales. El papa Francisco ha elegido a más de tres cuartos del actual colegio cardenalicio. El que salga [como Papa] será un hombre de Francisco porque son absoluta mayoría en el cónclave que se pueda reunir”.\nTambién hay influencias externas al propio Vaticano, como ha revelado el director de ‘Religión digital’: “ Elon Musk y Donald Trump están muy interesados en poder influir en el futuro Papa ”.\n¿Está sobre la mesa la posible renuncia del Papa? Una de las posibilidades que se está barajando es que el Papa pudiera renunciar a su cargo, pero Vidal lo descarta: “Yo creo que no, este Papa no. Por eso creo que se está quemando, ha tardado muchísimo en ir al hospital . Él cree que tiene una misión y que tiene que ir hasta el final, acabarse con ella. Por eso ha tardado mucho en ir al hospital y tiene ahora las complicaciones que tiene”.\nTemas",

    "text": "“Mai una specie continentale di uccelli è stata dichiarata estinta nel Paleartico occidentale da quando è iniziato il monitoraggio naturalista. Un primo estremamente preoccupante», ha avvertito martedì la LPO, una delle più importanti associazioni francesi dedite alla protezione della natura, che ha commentato in un comunicato stampa questo studio, pubblicato sulla rivista di ornitologia Ibis (Nuova finestra).\nIl chiurlo dal becco sottile (Numenius tenuirostris) era un uccello dal piumaggio chiaro e dal becco lungo, sottile e ricurvo. Un tempo diffuso nelle zone umide dell’Europa e dell’Asia centrale, questo uccello altamente migratore nidificava in Siberia e Finlandia prima di svernare sulle coste del Mediterraneo.\nSecondo lo studio, l’osservazione indiscutibile più recente risale al 1995 in Marocco, quasi 30 anni fa.\nIn Francia, l’ultimo rapporto è stato redatto dalla LPO il 15 febbraio 1968 nella baia di Aiguillon (Vendée), rileva la lega francese che rileva che, nonostante le ricerche approfondite per individuare possibili sopravvissuti, lo studio scientifico stima al “96% la probabilità che il specie è ormai estinta”.\n“La popolazione è diminuita rapidamente nel XX secolo a causa della perdita di habitat causata dall’agricoltura intensiva e dal drenaggio delle zone umide. Il suo cugino americano, il chiurlo eschimese (Numenius borealis), non si vede dal 1987”, osserva la stessa fonte.\nDelle 9 specie di chiurlo descritte nel mondo, due hanno quindi cessato di esistere in meno di 40 anni, secondo la LPO che ricorda che la Francia aveva sospeso nel 2020 la caccia al chiurlo euroasiatico (Numenius arquata), i cui numeri europei sono diminuiti diminuito di quasi la metà dal 1980.\nPer l’associazione, la conferma della scomparsa del Chiurlo costituisce “la prima estinzione ufficiale di una specie di uccello continentale nella zona paleartica occidentale, che copre l’Europa, il Nord Africa e parte dell’Asia”.\n“Questo dato è particolarmente preoccupante perché se secondo l’IUCN (Unione Internazionale per la Conservazione della Natura) più di 150 specie di uccelli (su circa 11.000) sono scomparse dal pianeta dal 1500, la maggior parte riguardava uccelli endemici indeboliti dall’insularità come la beccaccia di mare delle Canarie (Haematopus meadewaldoi) e il famigerato Dodo delle Mauritius (Raphus cucullatus) o specie decimati dalla caccia, come quella dell’alca impennata (Pinguinus impennis) e del piccione migratore (Ectopistes migratorius)”, conclude la Lega francese per la protezione degli uccelli.",

    "title": "NW China's Shaanxi builds 'green miracle' in Yellow River Basin",
    "text": "Situated in the middle reaches of the Yellow River, northwest China's Shaanxi Province has promoted ecological conservation and high-quality development along the river, building a \"green miracle\" in the Yellow River basin in the province through relentless efforts.\nGreening the Loess Plateau\nA vast woodland combining trees, shrubs, and grass stretches out as far as the eye can see at the Mu Us Desert afforestation base in Shenmu, a county-level city administered by Yulin city, located on the Loess Plateau in Shaanxi.\nIt's hard to imagine that the woodland was once a barren desert area plagued by sandstorms years ago. Elders of the area shake their heads remembering the past, stating that sandstorms would sometimes last for days, leaving a layer of sand in their yards that had to be scooped out with dustpans. Today, the main color palette has transformed from “yellow” to “green”.\n\"Now, we systematically monitor wind speed, moisture, microorganisms, etc. in the woodland,\" said Zhang Yinglong, president of the Shenmu ecological protection and construction association and a veteran in desertification control. He added that combating desertification relies on science and technology.\nOver the past 21 years, Zhang and his team have developed a series of afforestation techniques and models. Their process involves three steps. First, planting psammophytes, which are especially adept at growing in sand, to reduce wind erosion; second, planting shrubs to stop migrating sand; and finally planting trees to gradually form a forest. The team, working on an area of 428,000 mu (28,533 hectares), has seen vegetation coverage increase from 3 percent to 65 percent.\nBuilding barriers to protect soil and water\nYulin city has brought 8.6 million mu of shifting sand under control and expanded its forest area from 600,000 mu in the early days of New China to 23.6 million mu today, creating a \"green miracle.\"\nA similar story has unfolded in Yan'an city, also located on the Loess Plateau in Shaanxi, thanks to over two decades of afforestation efforts. Data shows that the city's vegetation coverage has increased from 46 percent in 2000 to 81.3 percent in 2023.\nOver the past few years, Shaanxi has been able to move the border between green and desert northward 400 kilometers. Since 2020, the province has planted nearly 18.36 million mu of trees and tackled over 3.89 million mu of desertified land in the Yellow River basin.\nThe rugged terrain of the Loess Plateau at the Xindiangou water and soil conservation demonstration park in Suide county, Yulin is now covered in lush greenery.\nXindiangou, which features loess hills and ravines, was once plagued by water and soil erosion, with huge amounts of mud and sand flowing into the Yellow River.\nTo combat soil erosion, a \"three lines of defense\" management model was formulated.\nThe first line of defense involves constructing terraced fields on the ridges and upper regions of loess hills where the slopes are relatively gentle. Fruit trees and a rotation of grass and crops are planted on the terraced fields to modify the terrain and prevent water and soil erosion.\nThe second line focuses on the cultivation of shrubs along with timber and grass on steep ravine slopes to stabilize hillsides and prevent erosion.\nThe third line emphasizes the construction of warp-land dams, or silt dams, at the bottom of ravines for further flood control, sediment trapping and farming.\nUsing an analogy, the “three lines of defense” equates to putting hats on the ridges by building terraces, dressing the slopes in coats of tree and grass, and boots on the valley bottoms with slit-damns, explained Gao Jianjian, head of the Ecological Engineering Department at the Water and Soil Conservation Bureau of the Yellow River in Suide. Gao went on to say that through decades of effort, 80 percent of the area facing water and soil erosion has been treated, with a forest and grass coverage of more than 75 percent.\nXindiangou is a good example of the comprehensive treatment of water and soil erosion taking place in the rest of northern Shaanxi. Data reveals that in 2023, areas in Shaanxi facing water and soil erosion decreased by 1,261 square kilometers compared to the previous year, and its water and soil conservation rate increased to 70.15 percent.\nThe water quality of the Shaanxi section of the Yellow River’s mainstream has reached the Level II standard for two consecutive years, according to an official with the Shaanxi Provincial Development and Reform Commission. An annual average of 4,000 square kilometers of land in the Yellow River basin in the province has been saved from water and soil erosion. The Loess Plateau has become the region with the largest increase in green coverage nationwide.\nThis \"green miracle\" has yielded both ecological and economic benefits. Yan'an city, for example, has 3.32 million mu of apple orchards with an annual apple output of 4.32 million tonnes, accounting for one-third of Shaanxi's apple production and one-ninth of China's total output. Out of the city's population of over 2 million, more than 1 million people are engaged in the apple industry. The sector benefits 800,000 farmers, with apple sales contributing to 61 percent of their operational income.\nDali county in Weinan city, located in the Yellow River basin in Shaanxi, has seen similar success with fruit cultivation. In 2023, the county produced 500,000 tonnes of winter jujubes, and over 300,000 people worked in the winter jujube industry, with farmers earning an average annual income of more than 100,000 yuan.\nIt's not just apples and jujubes. Across the Yellow River Basin in Shaanxi, vegetables, kiwi fruit, and various grains from northern Shaanxi are thriving. From \"ecological beauty\" to \"ecological wealth,\" an increasing number of people are turning green into gold.\n\"As clear waters and green mountains are invaluable assets,\" an official in the Shaanxi Development and Reform Commission affirms, \"we will continue our efforts to comprehensively promote the ecological protection and high-quality development of the Yellow River Basin.\"",

By [Reed Gaudens](https://netflixlife.com/author/rgaudens/) Even though mysteries and crime thrillers are some of the most consistently popular genres of Netflix shows, there's an [audience that's just as big for romance](https://netflixlife.com/2023/12/03/best-romantic-movies-on-netflix-in-2023/). Between Emily's complicated search for love in Emily in Paris and the Bridgerton family's sprawling love stories in Bridgerton, a number of romantic shows have burned up Netflix's top 10. Can you blame them? Thankfully, in 2023, Netflix gave us a solid handful of amazing romantic shows, but there are even more heavy hitters making their way back to our watch lists in 2024. The aforementioned Bridgerton already has a two-part release date for season 3 this summer, while the likes of Virgin River, Young Royals, and My Life with the Walter Boys will back, too. Let's begin the excitement for the romantic shows coming to Netflix throughout 2024 with the title that's perhaps the most highly anticipated overall: Bridgerton season 3! Bridgerton season 3 It's about time, right?! After over two years since season 2 premiered in March 2022, Bridgerton season 3 — at long last! — [arrives in two parts in 2024](https://netflixlife.com/2023/12/12/bridgerton-season-3-release-date-cast-trailer-synopsis/). The first half of the season drops on May 16 and the second half on June 13. Since fans expected the season to be released at the end of 2023 or early 2024, it's still a longer wait than was anticipated. But at least Netflix has finally revealed one of the most sought after release dates of the year. Of course, the third season will continue the various loose ends left behind by season 2, but the story will now focus on Colin and Penelope and adapt the fourth book in Julia Quinn's book series. (Yes, they're [skipping over Benedict's story... for now](https://netflixlife.com/2023/11/26/bridgerton-season-3-skipping-benedict/).) \"Polin\" has been perhaps the most eagerly awaited love stories of the series, and it's about to heat up Netflix's summer in a big way. Beyond season 3, Netflix already has Bridgerton season 4 in the works, but don't expect that season in 2024, too. One Day Hungry for another page-to-screen adaptation that's full of romance and might (okay, definitely will) make you cry? One Day needs to be on your watch list in February 2024. The 14-episode limited series, which is based on the book by David Nicholls and was also an Anne Hathaway movie, is the kind of love story that will hook you and break your heart. The White Lotus breakout Leo Woodall stars alongside Ambika Mod, and together they play Emma and Dexter, a pair that meets and falls in love. We spend one fateful day with them throughout many, many years. One Day releases on Netflix on Feb. 8, just ahead of Valentine's Day, making it the perfect title to watch whether you're in a relationship, single, or it's complicated. As the only new Netflix show featured on this list (so far), we'd be remiss to exclude it because it's sure to be a fan-favorite. And if you love the romance, you can always read the book and watch the movie after binge-watching the full limited series. Also, heed that warning: You will need some tissues handy. Young Royals season 3 One of the most beloved teen shows on Netflix, Young Royals will be back for its [third and final season](https://netflixlife.com/2023/10/17/young-royals-season-3-release-updates/) in March 2024. The Swedish romantic drama series takes place in an elite boarding school as a (fictional) prince falls for another student. Naturally, their relationship isn't easy given the prince's status. But who doesn't love a royal love story? It's super fun to watch the fantasy of a normal person falling in love with prince or princess, whether it's Cinderella or Young Royals. As sad as fans will be that the third season is the last, it's so exciting that the series will be able to go out by telling the story that it wants to tell. Edvin Ryding, Omar Rudberg, Malte Gårdinger, Frida Argento, Nikita Uggla, and more familiar faces will be back in their roles for the final episodes. Currently, Netflix hasn't announced the exact release date for season 3, but March will be the month of Simon and Wilhelm. Prepare your heart for major swooning! Emily in Paris season 4 We definitely had a blue Christmas in 2023 without a new season of Emily in Paris to fawn over. Because of the dual strikes that halted the entirety of the film and television industry for nearly half of the year, a long list of movies and shows were massively delayed, including Netflix's Emmy-nominated romantic comedy darling. That means, by the time we finally watch season 4, it will have been almost or just about two years. We've never had to wait that long for Emily! But [season 4 of Emily in Paris](https://netflixlife.com/2023/09/08/emily-in-paris-season-4-release-updates-cast-filming-news/) will without question be worth the wait. A major bomb was dropped at the end of season 3 that could throw an impenetrable wrench in Emily's romantic plans with Gabriel. Camille's pregnancy casts a shadow over the glimmer of hope that Emily and Gabriel, whose separate relationships both imploded, [could get together at long last](https://netflixlife.com/posts/emily-in-paris-season-4-cant-miss-gabriel-01hhmdyrsezq). We'll be waiting until at least fall 2024 for Emily Cooper to make her comeback, but whenever she does, it'll be oh-so sweet. Virgin River season 6 Does it get much more romantic than Virgin River? The romantic drama series has arguably become not only the top romantic show on the streaming service but one of its top shows period. In September 2023, the fifth season of the fan-adored series debuted with 10 episodes, then in November, two Christmas-themed episodes released to wrap up the season and set up season 6 with a festive twist. It's [one of the best seasons of the series](https://netflixlife.com/2023/11/30/virgin-river-season-5-recap-guide-episodes-explained/), paving the way for an amazing sixth season. The Christmas episodes followed Mel's discovery that her real birth father lives in Virgin River, and she and Jack track him down. Although Everett Reid initially lies to her, he later admits that he's her birth father and he has a mysterious something to tell her. That's just one of the many cliffhangers we're looking forward to getting answers for in season 6, which will likely hit our watch lists sometime in fall 2024. The drama and romance can't come back soon enough! Heartstopper season 3 Hands down the cutest and most heartwarming show on Netflix, the teen romantic comedy-drama series Heartstopper will be back for season 3 in 2024. Thankfully, the [third season has already wrapped filming](https://netflixlife.com/2023/10/02/heartstopper-season-3-release-updates/), as the British series was the rare show not to be incredibly delayed by the strikes. After the second season made its arrival in August 2023, the third should follow suit about a year or less later in summer 2024. Heartstopper season 2 was a game changer for all of our favorite characters and their relationships. Chiefly, Nick grappled with coming out as bisexual to the world and being open with his relationship with Charlie. By the end of the season, both boys were prepared to drop that very first \"I love you,\" but an interruption kept those three words lingering in the air. Until season 3 arrives on Netflix later this year, we have Alice Oseman's books to keep us company. My Life with the Walter Boys season 2 Right in the nick of time, a new teen romance series slipped in under the wire to become a new favorite and staple on Netflix. My Life with the Walter Boys premiered in Decemember 2023 and immediately peaked in the No. 1 spot in the top 10, where it was parked for over a week. Because of its overnight success, Netflix quickly [renewed the series for a second season](https://netflixlife.com/2023/12/07/everything-we-know-my-life-with-the-walter-boys-season-2/) less than two weeks after its premiere. 2023 was definitely Netflix's year of rapid renewals. It's the show everyone is talking about right now, but as of January 2024, there isn't much season 2 news to report. But we're keeping our fingers crossed that filming is able to get underway as soon as possible so season 2 makes its way to our watch lists by the end of the year. (Don't wait until 2025, Netflix!) After all, we need [all of our burning questions answered](https://netflixlife.com/posts/7-burning-questions-we-still-have-for-my-life-with-the-walter-boys-season-2), and we need to see what's next in the Jackie, Alex, and Cole love triangle. Sweet Magnolias season 4 You didn't think we were finished pouring it out with the Sweet Magnolias, did you? Nope! There's plenty more margaritas and chips and salsa in our future with Maddie, Dana Sue, and Helen as they continue their small-town journeys through love, family, and friendship. However, with the way season 3 ended, we're not quite sure what to expect from season 4. Regardless, star [JoAnna Garcia Swisher has already warned fans to \"buckle up.\"](https://netflixlife.com/2023/11/13/sweet-magnolias-season-4-will-another-season/) Netflix officially picked up Sweet Magnolias season 4 in October 2023, which came months after the release of season 3 that July. There had been reasonable questions about the show's future in spite of its success since the season 3 finale seemed to wrap up each storyline. But alas, we haven't made our final trip to Serenity! Garcia Swisher, Brooke Elliott, Heather Headley, and the usual suspects will be back for the fourth season. We're predicting a hopeful release by the end of 2024, but we'll have to wait and see if the romantic drama makes it back this year. XO, Kitty season 2 One of 2023's most pleasant surprises, the To All the Boys I've Loved Before spinoff series XO, Kitty premiered in May 2023 and became a new hit teen series for Netflix. However, in some ways, the series still seems underrated. The show comes from To All the Boys author Jenny Han, who also wrote and created fellow hit teen page-to-screen series The Summer I Turned Pretty. Gen Z has Han to thank for two teen shows that will likely define their generation. Two months after XO, Kitty debuted to positive reviews and decent viewership, Netflix [renewed the teen romance for a second season](https://netflixlife.com/2023/11/09/xo-kitty-season-2-everything-we-know-so-far/). Kitty Song Covey's misadventures in young love and friendship will continue at her South Korean boarding school. It's such a fun, endearing, and wildly entertaining teen series, and we hope it's back much sooner than later in 2024, maybe fall or even into the holidays. As long as it's back this year! The next chapter of Kitty's love life will surely be even more exciting, complicated, and stylish.",
