    "text": "El papa Francisco aboga por la negociación en conflictos internacionales La entrevista completa con el papa Francisco se emitirá el próximo 20 de marzo. SUIZA.- En una entrevista reciente con la Radio Televisión Suiza, el [papa Francisco ](https://www.elimparcial.com/tags/papa-francisco/)se refirió al conflicto en [Ucrania ](https://www.elimparcial.com/tags/ucrania/)y la situación en [Gaza](https://www.elimparcial.com/tags/franja-de-gaza/), instando a la valentía de la negociación como medio para poner fin a la violencia y buscar soluciones pacíficas. El pontífice utilizó la metáfora de la “bandera blanca” para simbolizar la disposición a dialogar y encontrar un alto el fuego, destacando que negociar no debe considerarse como un acto de rendición, sino como una muestra de sabiduría y compasión hacia quienes sufren las consecuencias del conflicto. Francisco expresó su solidaridad con el pueblo ucraniano y renovó su llamado a favor de una solución diplomática y una paz duradera en la región. Además, el papa hizo hincapié en la importancia de la mediación internacional para facilitar las conversaciones y encontrar un camino hacia la reconciliación.

    "text": "Cooling Techniques Show Success in Reducing Temperature of One of the Worlds Hottest Cities A combination of cooling technologies and techniques could reduce the temperature and energy needs of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Complete the form below to unlock access to ALL audio articles. It’s possible to significantly reduce the temperatures of a major city in a hot desert climate while reducing energy costs, a new study by [UNSW Sydney](https://www.unsw.edu.au/) shows. The findings, published today in [Nature Cities](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44284-023-00005-5), detail a multi-faceted strategy to cool Saudi Arabia’s capital city by up to 4.5°C, combining highly reflective ‘super cool’ building materials developed by the High-Performance Architecture Lab with irrigated greenery and energy retrofitting measures. The study, which was conducted in collaboration with the Royal Commission of Riyadh, is the first to investigate the large-scale energy benefits of modern heat mitigation technologies when implemented in a city. “The project demonstrates the tremendous impact advanced heat mitigation technologies and techniques can have to reduce urban overheating, decrease cooling needs, and improve lives,” says UNSW Scientia [Professor Mattheos (Mat) Santamouris](https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/professor-mattheos-santamouris), Anita Lawrence Chair in High-Performance Architecture and senior author of the study.

[Subscribe for FREE](https://go.technologynetworks.com/subscribe-to-breaking-science-news) Prof. Santamouris specialises in developing heat mitigation technologies and strategies to decrease urban temperatures in cities. Extreme urban heat affects more than 450 cities worldwide, increasing energy consumption needs and adversely impacting health, including heat-related illness and death. Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, is one such city. Situated in the centre of a desert, it is one of the hottest cities in the world, with temperatures that can exceed 50°C during summer. Furthermore, climate change and rapid urbanisation are increasing the magnitude of overheating. “Limited greenery and large artificial surfaces made of conventional building materials like asphalt and concrete trap heat, meaning the city continues to heat up,” says Prof. Santamouris. “Additional heat from car pollution and industrial activities also increases the city’s temperature.” Simulating city-scale heat mitigation scenarios For the study, the team led by UNSW researchers ran large-scale cooling climatic and energy simulations of the Al Masiaf precinct of Riyadh, including the energy performance of 3323 urban buildings, under eight different heat mitigation scenarios to evaluate optimal strategies for lowering the temperature of the city and reducing cooling needs. The modelling, which considered different combinations of super cool materials, vegetation types and energy retrofitting levels, found it’s possible to decrease the outdoor temperature in the city by nearly 4.5°C during summer. The strategy would also improve cooling energy conservation for the city by up to 16 per cent. The recommended heat mitigation (or cooling) scenario for Riyadh includes using super cool materials implemented in the roof of the buildings and more than doubling the number of irrigated trees to improve transpiration cooling. On the contrary, a blind implementation of urban cooling techniques not based on detailed and advanced scientific optimisation, like the use of non-irrigated greenery, may result in a substantial increase in the city’s temperature. “By implementing the right combination of advanced heat mitigation technologies and techniques, it is possible to decrease the ambient temperature at the precinct scale,” says Prof. Santamouris. “For a sweltering city the size of Riyadh, significantly reducing cooling needs is also tremendous for sustainability.” Prof. Santamouris says lowering the temperature of the city helps increase thermal comfort for people as well as reduce health issues from severe heat, decrease the concentration of pollutants and improve human productivity. While not a part of this study, previous research found [implementing similar cooling strategies in other cities can help reduce heat-related deaths](https://newsroom.unsw.edu.au/news/art-architecture-design/cooling-darwin-unsw-plan-fight-climate-change). Reducing energy demand at the urban scale The research also simulated the energy impact of retrofitting measures for all 3323 buildings, alongside heat mitigation technologies implemented at the urban scale. Combining the optimal cooling technologies with energy retrofitting options – namely, improving the building envelope through better windows, insulation, solar and cool roofs – could decrease the cooling demand by up to 35 per cent. “This represents a substantial reduction to the energy needs for Riyadh that would help further reduce costs associated with cooling for the city while improving the quality of life for the local population,” says Prof. Santamouris. The researchers now hope to work with the Royal Commission of Riyadh to begin implementing the tailored heat mitigation plan in the city, which would be the largest of its kind in the world. “Once implemented at the city scale, these advanced heat mitigation technologies will deliver important health, sustainability and economic outcomes for the city for years to come,” says Prof. Santamouris.

    "title": "Visualizing stories in games requires depth and variety - Pipe Dream",
    "text": "Sometimes games are about the action: the entertainment that comes from shooting, blasting, racing, flying or generally doing some kind of physical movement. However, on the other end of the spectrum, games’ value can be attributed to their plot and can also introduce players to new worlds and stories.\nA good dynamic for the latter of games can be defined by the balance between interactive mechanics and stories with narrative depth, though I don’t feel satisfied with the range of games the industry currently has to offer. Especially considering that the term “visual novel” is heavily associated with Japanese works, there isn’t much to go around when it comes to art styles, storytelling methods or plots coming from the West. In my experience, Japanese games that fall under this category are characteristically “railroaded” experiences, meaning they still provide limited space for player interaction and include a narrow set of choices in a closed environment.\nBut the genre is not limited to the Japanese industry, nor is the genre itself static — new interpretations of the visual novel should borrow previous mechanics and build gaming experiences that provide much greater levels of creativity in interactive gameplay on top of them.\nGiven current trends, it is much more lucrative to release another game with in-game purchases or rushed mechanics than to take the time to imagine new styles of gameplay. Perhaps I am an outlier for claiming this, but because of this, a game from the West called “Suzerain” should be treated as a rare example of a visual novel that is deeply immersive, and future success for this genre can come by drawing inspiration from it.\nThe premise of Suzerain is simple. As the president of an imaginary republic, you must persevere through the endless complexities and power struggles of a chaotic society while overcoming harsh political and cultural problems. Every decision you make affects the balance of power in your nation, and you must find your moral ground by interacting with the world around you. Many simulators try to emulate the hard decisions made in politics, but Suzerain is the only one that I can think of in which the experience feels decisively human. I feel that I am living an imaginary life while playing the game, and every decision made within its interactive design makes the experience personal.\nOn a different note, games that are, technically speaking, not visual novels can still bring an element of creativity into the industry in the West. The most famous example of good narrative being coupled with interesting gameplay is Disco Elysium. Without stretching the definitions too much, this is one of the works from the past years that has introduced new ideas about what visual novels can achieve.\nThe most excellent part about the storytelling in Disco Elysium is its very human way of approaching the complex setting it is based on. The player begins with no memory, no sense of purpose and no identity, finding the need to invent their own as the dialogue progresses and ascribe meaning to a chaotic world. There is still an eventual end we march toward, and barring the slight variations on the different endings, the way the story concludes is as inevitable as death itself.\nThis aspect of its story somehow makes me feel like Disco Elysium is an allegory for life itself — while death is inevitable, the choices we make can still define the time we have. Disco Elysium has the potential to reach such a level of complexity in its narrative effectively because the depth of storytelling is always the priority — the experience is distinct from other conventional genres because the story of the game is “your” life story and the purpose of the game is to discover how you specifically choose to see the stories of the world around you.\nOne thing that made writing this article both exciting and frustrating was this same situation with visual novels — there aren’t many unique ones out there. That is why it is worth paying attention to these two games that have made a name for themselves, primarily because of how much potential they have from a game design point. Their reviews always have the same type of “What other games are like this?” and “Why aren’t there more games like this?” comments by players. The lack of experimentation by the industry until now is at odds with the untapped potential of games beyond mere entertainment and toward creative art. Conventional action and combat genres have a solidified audience in mainstream gaming due to their longtime popularity and physicality, but studios with creative vision must now cross the boundaries of the unknown and experiment with telling stories and interactive story features.\nGame design that differs both from the railroaded style of narration in Japan and the greedy mass production of content in the West provides a new frontier for expression with a clear demand. I would be very interested in new games that offer an immersive, interactive storytelling experience that comes with unique mechanics. Since visual novels are good at emphasizing the depths of a fictional story, this can be a new direction to look at. There simply needs to be an incentive or a push for more content in creative writing, which could be the beginning of a new style of game development altogether.\nDeniz Gulay is a sophomore double-majoring in history and Russian.\nViews expressed in the opinions pages represent the opinions of the columnists.

    "text": "¿Has oído hablar de la bendición de los niños? Esta hermosa costumbre se realiza cada 28 de diciembre, en el día que la Iglesia celebra la Fiesta de los Santos Inocentes. Según [EWTN](https://www.ewtn.com/es/catolicismo/fiestas-liturgicas/santos-inocentes-22921), “La Fiesta de los Santos Inocentes, conmemora la muerte de los niños varones en Belén que tenían 2 años de edad o menos. El rey Herodes el Grande había ordenado esto para asegurarse de que el niño Mesías buscado por los magos no pudiera desplazarlo en su trono. Es por eso que a San José se le dijo en un sueño que tomara al Niño y a la Santísima Virgen y huyera a Egipto para escapar de la persecución del rey Herodes”. La Fiesta de los Santos Inocentes ofrece algunas oportunidades litúrgicas interesantes. Aparte de aprender la historia de esta fiesta, hay cosas que podemos hacer como católicos para celebrar en nuestros propios hogares, ¡especialmente como padres! El menor de los hijos manda El teólogo residente y profesor en la Universidad Católica de América, Chad Pecknold, reveló una costumbre popular para este día. “Hay una gran costumbre católica de que el hijo menor de la familia 'gobierna' en la Fiesta de los Santos Inocentes\", explicó Pecknold en su [publicación en X](https://twitter.com/ccpecknold/status/1740358435668185366). ¡Esto significa que el hijo menor decide la comida, actividades y más! [Otras fuentes ](https://www.fisheaters.com/customschristmas5.html)sugieren que si tienes más de un niño pequeño en casa, puedes dividir responsabilidades. ¡Qué divertido! Bendice a los niños Otra costumbre para la fiesta de los Santos Inocerntes, es que los padres bendigan a sus hijos. Por supuesto, esto no reemplaza una bendición sacerdotal o sacramental, pero sigue siendo un regalo especial para tus hijos. [El Padre Ronald Vierling explica](https://twitter.com/father_rmv/status/1740283741656818018) que puedes “simplemente hacer una cruz en la frente del niño con el pulgar derecho mojado en agua bendita”, diciendo: “Que Dios te bendiga y que Él sea el Guardián de tu corazón y mente: en el nombre del Padre, el Hijo y el Espíritu Santo. Amén”. También puedes comenzar el día con esta oración: Santos Inocentes, benditos niños, primeros mártires de Jesucristo, el Rey de los mártires, ¡Qué brillante vida ganaron con esa intensa muerte! Hermosos pequeños mártires del Santo Niño, vuestros ojos se cerraron pronto ante las sombrías nieblas de la tierra, para abrirse ante glorias incontables. Amargo y breve fue el pasaje, ¡pero oh, qué pasajeramente dulce fue el fin! ¡Cuán dulce morir por Él que vino a dar su vida por vosotros! Orad por mí, vosotros, inmaculados, ante el Trono, para que yo también, indigno y errante como soy, pueda unirme a aquellos que siguen al Cordero por dondequiera que vaya. Santísimo Niño Jesús, salva a tus hijos. Según [la Conferencia de Obispos Católicos de Estados Unidos (USCCB)](https://www.usccb.org/prayers/daily-blessing-child#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20following%20short,going%20to%20bed%20each%20night), la Iglesia anima a bendecir a los hijos diariamente. “Uno de los siguientes breves rezos de bendición puede ser dicho por los padres en varios momentos, como cuando un niño va a jugar o a la escuela, pero especialmente cuando el niño se va a dormir cada noche. El padre hace la señal de la cruz en la frente o el corazón del niño y dice una de las siguientes bendiciones. Que Dios te bendiga. Que Dios te mantenga seguro. Que Dios esté contigo. Que Dios esté en tu corazón. Que Dios te bendiga y proteja”. ¿Cómo celebrarás este día en tu hogar?",
