    "title": "InDepthNH Wins 2024 Nonprofit News Award, Featuring Ani Freedman Reporting",
    "text": "[InDepthNH.org ](https://indepthnh.org)won a Nonprofit News Award called an INNY Wednesday night at the awards ceremony at the National Center for Civil and Human Rights in Atlanta. The award honors an Institute for Nonprofit News member organization that made a significant contribution to the well-being of its community through a journalism-centered project or service. The award judges singled out Ani Freedman in the Community Champion micro-division for her investigative reporting regarding “forever chemicals” in Merrimack. Freedman has a master’s degree in journalism from Columbia University and lived in Nashua while reporting for InDepthNH.org. “I am beyond grateful to have been honored with this award from the Institute for Nonprofit News. To the people of Merrimack who entrusted me with their stories and came along for the journey of PFAS accountability amid environmental and health injustice, I thank you deeply. I could not have done it without you. And thank you, Nancy West and everyone at InDepthNH for believing in me, supporting me, and simply giving me a chance. “Currently I’m a fellow for Fortune Magazine doing health and wellness reporting,” Freedman said. West congratulated Freedman saying, “InDepthNH.org is thrilled for you, Ani, and grateful for all the work you did on so many different issues, especially forever chemicals, while reporting for us in New Hampshire, and your representation of InDepthNH.org at Institute for Nonprofit News Days in San Diego. “The New Hampshire Press Association was 100 percent correct naming you ‘Rookie of the Year’ when you were getting started here. It is wonderful that talented people like you have chosen journalism at a time when we need more hard-working, honest and ethical reporters in the field. Reporters like you, Ani. We hope you will return to InDepthNH.org someday. In the meantime, we will be following your reporting for Fortune at [https://fortune.com/author/ani-freedman](https://fortune.com/author/ani-freedman),” West said. The judges praised Freedman for investigating the impact of ‘forever chemicals polluting groundwater, soil and surface water in Merrimack and their ties to Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics. “That sort of reporting is not easy, one judge said. The science can be hard to explain. Corporations responsible for the pollution won’t talk or tell the truth. And, it’s essential to tell the personal stories of impact, to humanize the issue,” the judge wrote. “But, Ani Freedman does a good job getting to the bottom of this complex story. It’s a good example of the kind of accountability journalism that gets lost when newspapers shutter and the kind of reporting that nonprofit news organizations can do to enable residents to tell their stories and speak truth to power.” The Nonprofit News Awards (or INNYs) honor excellence in journalism, leadership and community service across the field of nonprofit news. In 2024, the Institute for Nonprofit News received 626 entries — the largest so far, and gave out 29 awards across 11 categories. A total of 75 judges, including nationally recognized journalists from across the INN Network and many other news organizations, formed panels to evaluate the entries.

    "text": "O paracetamol, amplamente utilizado para aliviar dores e reduzir febres, é geralmente considerado seguro.\nA pesquisa analisou dados de pacientes idosos que fizeram uso repetido de paracetamol - iStock/SVPhilon No entanto, um estudo recente da Universidade de Nottingham, na Inglaterra, e publicado na revista Arthritis Care and Research , indica que seu uso prolongado pode apresentar riscos significativos para pessoas com 65 anos ou mais.\nQuais são os riscos do uso prolongado de paracetamol em idosos? A pesquisa analisou dados de 180.483 pacientes idosos que fizeram uso repetido de paracetamol (duas ou mais prescrições em seis meses) e identificou uma associação com o aumento de:\núlceras peptídicas; insuficiência cardíaca; hipertensão; doença renal crônica. Devido à sua reputação de segurança, o paracetamol tem sido amplamente recomendado como tratamento de primeira linha para condições como a osteoartrite, especialmente em idosos que apresentam maior risco de complicações relacionadas a medicamentos.\nWeiya Zhang, líder do estudo, ressalta que, embora sejam necessárias mais pesquisas para confirmar essas descobertas, é crucial reconsiderar o uso do paracetamol.\n📅 Curte eventos e dicas imperdíveis? Então entre no canal da Catraca Livre no WhatsApp e fique atualizado! ✅ “Dado seu efeito mínimo de alívio da dor, o uso de paracetamol como analgésico de primeira linha para condições de longo prazo, como osteoartrite em idosos, precisa ser cuidadosamente considerado”, afirmou.\nRecomendações para o uso de paracetamol em idosos É fundamental que o uso de paracetamol por idosos seja supervisionado por profissionais de saúde. A Anvisa alerta que o uso indiscriminado do medicamento pode levar a eventos adversos graves, incluindo hepatite medicamentosa e morte.\nPortanto, é essencial seguir as doses recomendadas e considerar alternativas quando apropriado.\nExistem outras opções de analgésicos que podem ser consideradas, dependendo da condição específica e do perfil de saúde do paciente. Consulte seu médico.\nA Catraca Livre também divulgou um estudo que sugere que certos medicamentos podem elevar o risco de demência, clique aqui para entender essas descobertas .",

    "text": "A jardinagem vertical é uma técnica inovadora que permite o cultivo de plantas em superfícies verticais, como paredes e estruturas especialmente projetadas. Essa abordagem é ideal para ambientes urbanos onde o espaço horizontal é limitado, transformando paredes em verdadeiros jardins. A jardinagem vertical não apenas maximiza o uso do espaço, mas também contribui para a estética e a sustentabilidade dos ambientes.\nCom o aumento da urbanização, a jardinagem vertical surge como uma solução prática para aqueles que desejam incorporar a natureza em suas vidas diárias. Além de proporcionar um toque de verde, essa técnica ajuda a melhorar a qualidade do ar e a reduzir a temperatura em áreas urbanas, criando microclimas mais agradáveis.\nComo criar um jardim vertical?\nPara iniciar um jardim vertical, é fundamental escolher o tipo de estrutura que melhor se adapta ao seu espaço e às suas necessidades. Existem várias opções, desde treliças e painéis de madeira até sistemas modulares de plástico ou cerâmica. A escolha da estrutura deve considerar o peso das plantas e a facilidade de instalação e manutenção.\nApós escolher a estrutura, é importante instalar um sistema de irrigação eficiente, como o gotejamento, que garante que todas as plantas recebam a quantidade adequada de água. O substrato utilizado deve ser leve e rico em nutrientes para sustentar o crescimento saudável das plantas. O plantio deve respeitar o espaçamento adequado entre as espécies para evitar competição por luz e nutrientes.\nQuais são os benefícios da jardinagem vertical?\nA jardinagem vertical oferece uma série de benefícios que vão além da estética. Um dos principais é a melhoria da qualidade do ar, já que as plantas ajudam a filtrar poluentes e aumentar os níveis de oxigênio. Além disso, os jardins verticais atuam como isolantes térmicos, reduzindo a necessidade de ar-condicionado e aquecimento, o que pode resultar em economia de energia.\nOutro benefício significativo é a contribuição para a biodiversidade. Jardins verticais podem atrair polinizadores, como abelhas e borboletas, e até mesmo pequenos pássaros, promovendo um ecossistema saudável em áreas urbanas. Além disso, eles oferecem uma oportunidade única para o cultivo de alimentos em espaços reduzidos, permitindo que ervas e vegetais frescos estejam sempre à mão.\nQuais são as desvantagens da jardinagem vertical?\nApesar dos muitos benefícios, a jardinagem vertical também apresenta alguns desafios. A manutenção pode ser mais intensiva do que em jardins tradicionais, exigindo atenção regular à irrigação, fertilização e controle de pragas. Além disso, a escolha de plantas pode ser limitada, já que nem todas as espécies se adaptam bem ao cultivo vertical.\nOutro ponto a considerar é o custo inicial. A instalação de um jardim vertical pode ser cara, especialmente se incluir sistemas de irrigação automatizados e estruturas de suporte robustas. No entanto, com planejamento adequado e escolha de materiais de qualidade, muitos desses desafios podem ser superados, permitindo que você desfrute dos muitos benefícios que um jardim vertical pode oferecer.\nComo garantir o sucesso do seu jardim vertical?\nPara garantir o sucesso do seu jardim vertical, é essencial escolher plantas que se adaptem bem às condições do seu espaço, considerando fatores como luz e umidade. A instalação de um sistema de irrigação eficiente é crucial para manter as plantas saudáveis e reduzir o trabalho manual.\nAlém disso, a manutenção regular, incluindo poda e monitoramento de pragas, é fundamental para manter o jardim em boas condições. Com dedicação e cuidado, um jardim vertical pode se tornar um elemento vibrante e funcional em qualquer ambiente, trazendo beleza e benefícios ecológicos para o seu espaço.\nSiga a gente no Google Notícias",

    "text": "- Light\nPublished: | By: Gleb Chupakhin\nSource article\nFederal President of Germany (in German: Bundespräsident) Frank-Walter Steinmeier traveled to Jena on February 22nd as part of \"Workshop of Change\": a series of discussions conducted in cooperation with the BMW Foundation and the Carl Zeiss Foundation. The series highlights successful transformations of economy and society that serve as encouraging examples to the rest of Germany and the world. The Bundespräsident visited the Fraunhofer Insitute for Applied Optics and Precision Engineering (IOF) as well as Carl Zeiss AG and spoke to students and researchers of the Abbe School of Photonics during his time in Jena.\nHe praised the city as a site of successful transformation that is contributing to the creation of new opportunities for society, economy, and industry. The Bundespräsident said that Jena cannot be overlooked in this regard:\nJena is one of those beacons whose shine has managed to reach the whole world.\nBundespräsident Frank-Walter Steinmeier: ©\nWith his visit, he acknowledged Jena's development into an internationally renowned center for optical and optoelectronic research and development. This is partly because Jena has become and remained an open-minded location. Abbe School of Photonics students from many countries conduct research at many companies and research institutions, among them the Fraunhofer Institute. International students, according to the President, are essential to ensuring international connectivity.\nShaping Digital Change and Societal Transformation\nResearchers presented the Federal President with new technological approaches to societal challenges and future transformations in modern life and technology during his visit. Jena's optical key players are involved in numerous space missions, particularly those related to Earth observation and climate research. Additionally, work is underway on a mobile 3D hand scanner that aids in the digitization of complex objects such as aircraft engines. State-of-the-art sensor technology, like the system presented, is expected to support digitization in industrial manufacturing in the future.\nThe visit concluded with a dialogue involving international students of the Abbe School of Photonics and young researchers in the fields of optics and photonics. The conversation underscored the importance of an open-minded culture as the foundation for an excellent and internationally competitive research landscape.",
