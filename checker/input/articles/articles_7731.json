    "text": "Residents with their feet in water and a hospital flooded. This is the toll of the storms that hit the Montmirail area on August 1, report the Marne firefighters.\nWhile 28 residents of the health facility’s nursing home were able to be gathered in an internal multipurpose room, 14 others had to be taken care of in Dormans, Epernay and Aÿ-Champagne. There were no injuries. On the morning of August 2, emergency services are also still carrying out a pumping operation in the Montmirail hospital to avoid technical problems. The crawl spaces are indeed full.\nElsewhere in the Marne commune area, the water rose to more than 1m in some villages. Firefighters carried out around fifty operations, mainly for flooded cellars, but without evacuating any residents. The few power cuts reported around 7pm were fixed around 10pm by Enedis, thanks to the installation of two generators.\nIn the Ardennes, firefighters were called 150 times on August 1st and intervened in about fifteen municipalities following the bad weather. In Jaudun, Mayor François Garcia explained that 70 mm of rain fell in less than an hour. About fifteen homes were affected. Water levels also rose in other municipalities, including Launois-sur-Vence.",

    "text": "While most people spent their summer camping or enjoying time with friends, Jade Dulle was on her bike, cycling from coast to coast. Her journey took her from Prince Rupert, B.C., to St. John’s, Newfoundland.\nThis cross-country trek was more than just an adventure. Dulle was driven by a mission to advocate for change in how Canada addresses its mental health crisis.\n“As someone with lived experience trying to access the mental health system, especially in Saskatchewan, I’ve faced all of the barriers,” said Dulle. “That inspired me to make a difference politically for people with lived experience.”\nDulle documented her journey on TikTok, enduring challenging terrain and harsh weather.\n“I had to climb a lot of mountains, face cold frigid temperatures, but it was all worth the journey because this cause means so much to me,” she said.\nGet the CTV News app for Saskatoon area breaking news alerts and top stories Her advocacy stems from her personal struggles with mental health and frustrations navigating the system. Mental health coverage in Canada varies by province, and many community services are not universally covered.\nTo push for change, Dulle launched a petition on the House of Commons website. The petition calls for a national framework that covers psychotherapy, psychological assessments, and long-term mental health supports, aiming to harmonize and modernize mental health legislation.\n“So my petition...is advocating for a system that covers psychotherapy sessions, psychological assessments, long-term supports, and updated legislation to support people who voluntarily seek services,” she said.\nThe petition has nearly 400 signatures and needs 500 to be discussed in the House of Commons. It’s sponsored by NDP MP Gord Johns, who serves as the party’s mental health and harm reduction critic.",
