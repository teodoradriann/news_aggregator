    "title": "Lacasa breaks ground on supportive housing units in Goshen | News | goshennews.com",
    "text": "GOSHEN — Three new buildings to support marginalized groups are set to be constructed on Lakeview Drive on the city’s north side. Lacasa held a groundbreaking ceremony on Thursday with its partners in the project Oaklawn, Bashor Children’s Home, Indiana Housing & Community Development, City of Goshen, Surf Internet and DJ Construction. “At Lacasa, we have long embraced a holistic approach to how we serve our clients,” Lacasa president and CEO Jeremy Stutsman said. “It’s never just about housing. It’s about empowering families through partnerships, outreach, auto loans, financial literacy, and leadership programs … Together we’re offering more than just a roof, we’re offering a pathway to a brighter future.” The three housing projects are part of a large seven-complex plan to support Lacasa’s mission to create opportunity for personal empowerment, family stability and neighborhood vitality. The first of the three buildings will be permanent supportive housing for the chronically homeless, partnering with Oaklawn. “We know the challenges faced by our chronically homeless neighbors and they are profound,” Stutsman said, “which is why permanent supportive housing is so crucial. It provides shelter and stability and resources individuals need to thrive.” It is Lacasa and Oaklawn’s fifth permanent supportive housing project in the county but will be their first to have some two-bedroom units. “That’s important because it’s going to allow us to reunite families as well,” Stutsman said. Oaklawn will provide counseling and life services for the tenants. The buildings are also being housed on Oaklawn property “It’s a practice that is backed by research that shows it’s effective that embraces a philosophy called ‘Housing First,’” President and CEO of Oaklawn Lori Nafziger said. “This recognizes that safe and stable housing is bedrock. It’s basic need. It has to happen before you can really effectively engage in any kind of treatment. … If you think about it for just a second it should make sense to everybody here because if you don’t know where you’re sleeping tonight, it’s hard to think about, ‘You know, I ought to go talk to my therapist and pour my gut out.’” The second facility will feature transitional housing for children aging out of foster care, partnering with Bashor. “Too often these young people slip through the cracks,” Stutsman said, adding that 40-50% of children who age out of foster care become homeless within 18 months of aging out. “We’re hoping to be part of changing those statistics for the better.” Lacasa is one of only four agencies in Indiana that the Department of Child Services and Indiana Housing & Community Development selected for funding from the HOME Investment Partnerships Program to build this type of housing, Stutsman said. Bashor will be a service partner and have offices at the location. “They’ll have support wrapped around them that will help them accomplish their goals,” said President and CEO of Bashor Sean McCrindle. “We’re going to open doors for kids, kids who definitely need it. … Stable and effective supportive services are key and a catalyst for our kids achieving the goals that we all wish for our kids at home.” Lacasa is also partnering with ReStor church, providing essential items such as sheets, towels, pots and pans, and some groceries. “At the end of the day, all we have is underdog stories,” McCrindle said. “I love underdog stories.” The third building will offer affordable housing for those with 60% Area Median Income or under. AMI for a family of four locally is about $49,000. Surf Internet is installing fiber internet for Lacasa tenants across the board, and they have also committed to installing it at the new location.",

    "text": "Zumpango, Méx .— Al menos dos tercios de la Laguna de Zumpango comienzan a verse con agua, luego de la apertura de compuertas para descargar el líquido pluvial que proviene de diferentes fuentes como los ríos Cuautitlán y Santa María , dijeron pobladores que perdieron la siembra que trabajaron dentro del terreno de este lugar declarado en 2003 como Área Natural Protegida . Luego de casi dos años de ver totalmente secas las mil 800 hectáreas que comprende la laguna, miles de litros de agua comenzaron a ingresar desde el viernes 28 de junio y en seis días ya han cubierto zonas donde vecinos de San Juan Zitlaltepec sembraron maíz, cebollas, frijol, cilantro y nopales.\nAntonio Cruz, quien lleva 40 años trabajando con ganado y sembrando maíz, informó que sólo detectó siembra del lado de San Juan Zitlaltepec , donde a compañeros agricultores se les echaron a perder alrededor de 100 hectáreas de maíz con la descarga de las aguas.\nLee también: Detienen a 5 presuntos integrantes de banda roba motos y a la fabricación de armas en Zumpango\n“Hace unos 30 años pasó lo mismo. La gente se metió a sembrar, se les llamaban comuneros y hubo gente que como ahorita, no se querían salir y se agruparon. Otros sí entendieron que sembraron en zona federal y se salieron. Pero para nosotros ya es la segunda vez que la secan”, explicó el agricultor.\nAdemás, sostuvo que la Conagua les expuso que el agua viene de Cuautitlán, de Ecatepec y toda la zona oriente donde se han registrado fuertes lluvias, llegando a pasar el líquido por el Túnel Emisor Oriente y desviándolo hacia los cuerpos de agua en Hidalgo.\nEvaristo sembró cilantro y aunque lo perdió, indicó que es buena señal la llegada del agua porque hay gente que vivía del pescado tanto de comunidades como Santo Tomás y Analco .\n“Ahorita si dejan que se llene, que lo dejen un mes y toda la mugre baja y solita se absorbe. Entonces avientan la mojarra y mucha gente de eso se podría mantener. Acá es el campo, las vacas y esto beneficiaba a todos, porque entre todos nos comprábamos”, añadió.\nLee también: Descargan aguas negras en Zumpango\nAlgunos pedían que les dejaran sacar su siembra; sin embargo, no les fue permitido y abrieron compuertas para que el agua comenzara a descargarse, incluso con la molestia de un grupo de pobladores que manifestaron, principalmente, que las aguas negras echarían a perder el trabajo al que invirtieron meses.\nRespecto a por qué quisieron sembrar en el terrero de la Laguna de Zumpango , refirieron que en la zona se repartió por pueblos: Coyotepec, Santo Tomás, Analco, Santa Cruz, San Juan y San Pedro, para que los que tuvieran posibilidades económicas de hacerlo, avanzaran. Sin embargo, históricamente saben que cuando el agua cae, nadie debería de oponerse, pues se trata de una Área Natural Protegida .\nMencionaron que el tema del agua sucia podría no generar problemas, ya que, anteriormente, el líquido que llegaba también estaba sucio. “Eso se va a asentar, va a ser lodo y lo va absorber la tierra, toda la mugre va a bajar. Si avientan el pescado, si se cría, no se mueren. Si la van a llenar falta muchísimo, pero ya se ven varios espejos de agua”, apuntó Antonio Cruz.\nLa Laguna de Zumpango es primordial para la restauración de la Cuenca de México , señaló el secretario del Agua del Estado de México , Pedro Moctezuma, durante el foro Gestión de Ciclos y Fuentes Alternativas de Agua, celebrado en mayo pasado en la Universidad Autónoma del Estado de México, donde además expuso que en un año podría darse la recuperación del embalse para beneficio de 4 millones de habitantes, toda vez que aportaría 5 metros cúbicos, es decir, el mismo volumen de caudal que se recibe del Sistema Cutzamala.\nLagunas de Veracruz, en riesgo de desaparecer\nÚnete a nuestro canal ¡EL UNIVERSAL ya está en Whatsapp!, desde tu dispositivo móvil entérate de las noticias más relevantes del día, artículos de opinión, entretenimiento, tendencias y más.\nComentarios",

    "title": "19 Winter RV Projects You’ll Actually Want to Tackle This Season",
    "text": "The cold season has begun, and most RVers have stored their RVs until spring rolls back around. Meanwhile, many full-time RVers (like my family) have gone into winter travel mode, which involves much less active traveling and more sitting still. In both cases, this time of year is a good time to tackle some winter RV projects.\nIf you’re not moving your RV much during the winter, you will have more time to take care of all those little to-dos that are otherwise harder to get done between travel days. Taking care of these things during the cold season will ensure the rig is in tip-top shape once the camping season rolls around again.\n#1 Deep Clean First, I recommend using this season to do an RV deep clean . Yes, you probably clean your RV regularly through the year, but using the winter to really scrub the tub, spray the tanks as clean as they’ve ever been, vacuum and wipe storage bays, and thoroughly mop the floors certainly isn’t going to hurt anything.\nPut on some gloves, play your favorite tunes, and get that RV sparkling clean!\n#2 Organize While you’re deep cleaning, you can also work on organizing things in the RV. You can have the best intentions in the world, but there will still be cabinets and drawers in your RV that lose any sense of order as you travel over the camping season.\nThe winter is the perfect time to break out the storage totes, drawer organizers, and other organization tools and give everything a proper place once again.\n#3 Inventory and Restock Supplies Another thing you can do during your cleaning and organizing spree? Take inventory of what you have in your RV, purge things you no longer use or need, and make a list of items that need replenishing.\nThese might include things like kitchen essentials, cleaning supplies, and first-aid items. You can then pick these things up now—during the off-season—so your RV is stocked up in time for your first camping trip of the new year.\n#5 Do Maintenance I’ve never met a person who enjoys doing RV maintenance tasks. Nevertheless, because your RV is likely sitting still in winter, the cold season might just be the perfect time to do them.\n#6 Reseal Seams Checking and resealing the seams on the roof and sides of your RV is a super important part of RV maintenance in order to prevent leaks and water damage. Make sure to use RV-specific sealant, which is crucial for this key winter RV project.\n#7 Clean the Water System (tanks, lines, and water heater) Clean your water system to keep your family healthy while out RVing. You can clean the water heater with vinegar, the waste tanks with special chemicals and a good back spray tool, and the fresh tank and lines with water mixed with a small amount of bleach.\n#8 Check on Solar Panels Check up on your solar panels . Check wires for fraying and bad connections, clean the panels themselves, and make sure everything is still securely attached to the roof.\n#9 Do Battery Maintenance If you have flooded-cell RV batteries, winter is a good time to check the fluid levels. If they are low, use a sterile turkey baster to top them up with distilled water, being careful not to get any debris in the fluid.\n#10 Repack Wheel Bearings Trailer wheel bearings need to be repacked regularly . You can do this job yourself, but if you aren’t feeling up to it, many tire shops will tackle the chore for you.\n#11 Do Engine Maintenance Check all fluids under the hood, top up anything that needs it, and change the oil so your motorhome is ready to go next season.\n#12 Check Tires Your tires are a super important part of your RV. You should check them regularly, and winter can be one of the times you do so. Look for worn tread, uneven wear, bubbles, punctures, and other such issues.\n#13 Service the Brakes Obviously, your brakes are pretty important, too. Use the winter to do routine maintenance on your brakes to ensure they are in good condition for the spring.\nHaving trouble staying on top of RV maintenance? The RV LIFE Maintenance app is the perfect thing to help you keep track of what tasks need to be done and when. It’ll even send reminders so you don’t forget a thing!\n#14 Make Repairs All those little repairs you’ve been putting off? Now is the time to take care of them.\nReplace those non-functional drawer locks, broken hinges, and missing stove knobs. Fix the bits and pieces that are being held together by duct tape, patch the awning fabric, and find replacements for the torn-up cushions.\nWhatever issues you’ve been meaning to repair but just haven’t gotten to, get to them now.\n#15 Check Equipment Check all of your equipment during the off-season, making sure it is ready for next season. This includes smoke alarms, propane detectors, and CO detectors, as well as your entire hitch setup and propane system.\nAnything that might need attention—especially things that could be dangerous if left unchecked—should be checked out and repaired/replaced before you head out again in the spring.\n#16 Upgrade Systems Once you get through all of the necessary cleaning, organizing, maintenance, and repairs, you might also consider upgrading your rig. This will make camping even more fun next season, and if you’re looking for ways to pass the winter anyway, one of the projects below might be the perfect thing.\nLED Lights Switching to LED light bulbs is super easy and should definitely be added to your list of winter RV projects. Doing so saves energy and creates a better ambiance. They’re cooler, more efficient, and perfect for off-grid adventures.\nExtra USB Ports Add USB ports near beds or seating for easy device charging. This is a simple, modern upgrade and one of the easiest winter RV projects. Best of all, it will keep everyone powered up on the road.\nWater Filtering System Ensure clean, safe drinking water with a filter system. This upgrade is great for reducing contaminants and improving taste wherever you fill up. The Frizzlife Under Sink System is popular with RVers.\nSolar Power System Solar power systems let you charge your batteries off-grid, reducing generator use and increasing travel freedom. Installing an entire solar power system can be a bit daunting, but instructional videos are helpful.\n#17 Spruce Up the Interior You might also consider upgrading the look of your RV, especially if your RV is on the older side. There are many ways to go about this, so you can pick and choose the projects that are right for you.\nAdd a Backsplash You can easily add backsplashes to both your kitchen and bathroom using peel-and-stick tile. This is the perfect winter RV project.\nChange Window Treatments If your RV window treatments look outdated, worn out, or unsightly, you can replace them with regular blinds or curtains. You may have to hem curtains to fit. If you don’t sew, hem tape can do the job.\nRe-cover Furniture RV furniture can be recovered for a totally new look. You can use stretchy covers on cushions for a nice, tight fit. For frames, consider using a staple gun to staple new fabric in place on the underside of the furniture.\nChange Furniture You could also change out the furniture entirely. For the most part, using regular household pieces in an RV is perfectly fine as long as you can get them through the door (and you have a plan for securing them during transit). IKEA is good for this because many pieces are not assembled when you buy them.\nThe one exception to this rule involves any piece of furniture you plan to buckle into while a motorhome is in transit. In these cases, it is best to use RV-specific furniture.\n#18 Update Flooring Updating your RV flooring can give the space a whole new look. This will require pulling up old flooring, but that tends to be pretty easy to do in an RV. Many people like luxury vinyl planks for their RV floors.\n#19 Paint Walls or Cabinets Lastly, I must mention the option to paint your walls and/or cabinets. This will brighten the space, cover imperfections, and allow you to express yourself in your RV. There are many approaches to this, but we opted to tape everything off, sand down the surfaces we wanted to paint, and then apply a paint-and-primer combination. We used two coats, but there are one coat options.\nWrapping Up Winter RV Projects These winter RV projects will ensure your rig is ready and in top condition when it’s time to hit the road again, and they help pass the slow winter season while you wait to get back out on the road with your RV again. I know which projects I’m going to tackle. Which ones will you jump on first?",
