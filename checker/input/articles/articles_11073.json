    "title": "Honed in Slovenia, Som seeks breakthrough at Blasters",
    "text": "Koch: Bengaluru FC and Kerala Blasters share a fierce rivalry, but the very first action of the Durand Cup quarterfinal between the two sides resulted in a heart-stopping moment.\nBarely eight seconds into the contest, BFC striker Jorge Pereyra Diaz and Blasters’ goalkeeper Som Kumar clattered into each other head-first, resulting in a head injury for Som, who had to be stretchered off after suffering a deep cut.\nDespite having the option of extending his tenure with Slovenian club NK Olimpija Ljubljana, the 19-year-old signed for Kerala Blasters on a four-year deal this summer.\nHe enjoyed a solid pre-season in Thailand, but this injury was a setback. Until then, Som had been making a strong case as the Blasters' first-choice keeper, having started every Durand Cup game without conceding a single goal.\nBorn to former badminton players Vivek Kumar and Shama Kittur, Som views the incident as part and parcel of a learning experience and hopes to make a swift recovery in time for the Indian Super League.\n“It was the first seven-eight seconds of the game, I tried to get to the ball first, which I did, but then (Jorge Pereyra) Diaz and I collided. It was quite a deep cut, I didn’t realise it. I wanted to get up and continue playing. But the physio said it was too deep. I had to get seven stitches. Things like these happen in sports, it is a learning experience and I am looking forward to making a comeback,” Som told DH .\n“I haven’t started training again, my stitches aren’t out yet. Hopefully, I will be back in training soon and get opportunities in the Indian Super League,” Som added.\nSom reflected positively on his Durand Cup outings and spoke about the goalkeeping dynamic with fellow ‘keepers Sachin Suresh and Nora Fernandes at Kerala Blasters.\n“Playing in the Durand Cup was a great experience for me. Those games gave me confidence. Sachin (Suresh) is coming back from injury, we have a good relationship. He and Nora (Fernandes) are like big brothers to me and we push each other in training and try to get better every day.”\nThere is a marked rise in demand for goalkeepers who possess good passing abilities and sound judgement for building up attacks from deep. Som, who has refined these particular skills and broadened his understanding of the game in Europe, embodies the concept of a ‘modern-day’ goalkeeper.\nAlready a towering presence at six-foot-three, Som will undoubtedly grow to new heights. Four years ago, a bold decision laid the foundations for a promising career.\nAged just 14, Som left Bengaluru to broaden his horizons in Slovenia, where he played for NK Bravo, NK Krka and NK Olimpija Ljubljana.\nSom was called up to the senior squad after emerging as the first choice for the Olimpija Ljubljana U-19s. Andrej Kizo Kracman, the club's goalkeeping coach, previously worked with Slovenian internationals Jan Oblak and Samir Handanovic.\n“It was a big challenge, I don't think any other Indian footballer has left home at such a young age, but it was something I was willing to sacrifice to get better at the game,” Som said.\n“I learnt that I had to earn every minute. If the others trained four to five times a week, I would do maybe 10 sessions. You don't know when what will happen, there are a lot of external factors that could affect you not playing. So, each game counts.\n“I understood how to build up when teams press me. So it is an asset that can help whichever team I play for,” Som detailed.\nSom has already made a mark for the India U-20s and won the 'Best Goalkeeper' award in the Blue Cubs' 2022 SAFF U-20 Championship victory.\nWhen asked about his aspirations, Som's primary target was to prove himself in Indian football and stake a claim for a senior call-up.\n“I think firstly I need to prove myself. I am quite confident in my capabilities, and I think I can, in the next couple of years, help the Indian national team achieve some goals. I need to focus on my game and performance and hopefully, everything else will fall in place,\" Som said.\nSom pointed out the importance of working on the mental side of the sport and admitted that he has been working with a psychologist to improve his all-around abilities.\n“I have been working with a psychologist since the age of nine, so it has been almost 10 years. I think just like physical training, there are a lot of mental aspects that a player needs to work on. So I think if players do not give enough importance to that, someday it will catch up to them.\"\nADVERTISEMENT Published 05 September 2024, 20:17 IST",

    "text": "True Anomaly’s Jackal autonomous orbiting vehicle in production. Photo: True Anomaly\nTrue Anomaly on Thursday said it has selected Firefly Aerospace to launch its Jackal spacecraft for the U.S. Space Force ’s VICTUS HAZE Tactically Responsive Space (TacRS) mission expected to occur no later than fall 2025.\nFirefly will also launch two additional missions for True Anomaly between 2025 and 2027.\nThe Space Force in April awarded separate contracts to Rocket Lab and True Anomaly for VICTUS HAZE to demonstrate rendezvous and proximity operations with commercially-built assets to counter irresponsible behavior on orbit. True Anomaly will use an upgraded version of its Jackal autonomous orbital vehicle that can perform multi-orbit missions with a high acceleration and high delta-V propulsion system that is being developed with its propulsion supplier, Agile Space Industries.\nRocket Lab said previously it will launch its spacecraft aboard its own Electron rocket.\nThe VICTUS HAZE mission follows the VICTUS NOX TacRS mission , which involved the rapid launch of a satellite provided by a Boeing business unit aboard Firefly’s Alpha launch vehicle on Sept. 15, 2023 for a space domain awareness mission.\nTrue Anomaly described four phases it is executing for VICTUS HAZE: build, hot standby, launch, and on-orbit operations. The Colorado-based satellite manufacturer and software developer will complete development and testing of Jackal at its GravityWorks facility in Denver, transport it to Firefly’s SLC-2 payload processing facility at Vandenberg Space Force Base, Calif., for fueling, integration, and encapsulation in Alpha’s fairing, and then both companies will enter the hot-standby phase.\nOnce the Space Force provides the launch notice, Firefly has 24 hours to bring the payload fairing to the launch pad, mate it to Alpha, fuel the rocket, and launch within the first window. Once deployed, True Anomaly will begin on-orbit operations with Jackal that will include operating near Rocket Lab’s spacecraft.\nTrue Anomaly said the two additional launches with Firefly gives it access to responsive capacity.\nThis story was first published by Defense Daily",

    "text": "[A new study ](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2813379)published in JAMA suggests that US hospitals owned by private equity firms suffer more hospital-based adverse events, including falls, central line blood infections, and surgical site infections. More than 200 US hospitals are run by such firms, which critics worry place profits and quick sales to liquidate debt above patient care. The study compared outcomes among 662,095 hospitalizations at 51 private equity–acquired hospitals and 4,160,720 hospitalizations at 259 matched control hospitals using 100% Medicare Part A claims data. Events were assessed 3 years before to 3 years after private equity acquisition. They found that Medicare beneficiaries admitted to private equity hospitals experienced a 25.4% increase in hospital-acquired conditions. This increase in hospital-acquired conditions was driven by a 27.3% increase in falls and a 37.7% increase in central line–associated bloodstream infections. Surgical site infections doubled from 10.8 to 21.6 per 10 000 hospitalizations at private equity hospitals despite an 8.1% reduction in surgical volume. \"Surgical site infections doubled from 10.8 to 21.6 per 10 000 hospitalizations at private equity hospitals despite an 8.1% reduction in surgical volume,\" the authors said. \"Meanwhile, such infections decreased at control hospitals, though statistical precision of the between-group comparison was limited by the smaller sample size of surgical hospitalizations.” The authors said their findings validate concerns over private equity firms providing substandard patient care.",

    "title": "Judge grants GRU Authority's request for temporary injunction against upcoming referendum",
    "text": "With less than two weeks before Election Day, a district court judge on Wednesday granted the Gainesville Regional Utilities Authority a temporary injunction against the upcoming GRU governance referendum that will appear on the Nov. 5 ballot. As part of Judge George Wright's ruling, if the referendum, which asks voters to decide whether to delete the article of the city’s charter that created the authority, passes, the city of Gainesville would be unable to enforce the results until after a formal hearing on the matter is held in December. The board, created and passed by a Republican Florida Legislature, completely stripped the all-Democrat Gainesville City Commission of its power over the utility and handed it to authority members appointed by Gov. Ron DeSantis. Attorney Scott Walker, managing partner for Folds Walker LLC, the law firm that represents the authority, told The Sun Thursday afternoon that the judge’s “ruling is supportive of a local legislative elected body which implemented GRUA,” and that the board remains focused on debt reduction while keeping residential and commercial rates stable. \"One of the basic tenets of Florida constitutional law is that state rules and laws take precedent over local rules and laws, and that’s what the court did yesterday (Wednesday),” Walker said. \"... The concern for GRUA is the nearly 40 percent of ratepayers that live outside the city. They’re a voice for that 40 percent, which could be considered disenfranchised by what the city is doing.” The GRU Authority filed for the emergency injunction in September in an effort to the keep the referendum off the ballot, which it believes \"violates the Special Act of the Legislature that created the authority.\" Related coverage: Ethics complaint alleges GRU's Bielarski using ratepayer money to push back on referendum The filing by Folds Walker LLC and Theriaque & Spain also argues that the ballot language is \"misleading\" because it doesn't specify who would take over control of GRU decisions in the event the authority is dissolved or to whom the utility's general manager would report. According to the Alachua Chronicle , Judge Wright granted the injunction based on it passing a four-prong test, including that the injunction was the only remedy currently available, that the referendum would cause irreparable harm, that the GRU Authority's case has a high likelihood of success and that the injunction serves the public interest. The Chronicle reported that Wright said \"the status quo will be maintained\" regardless of the outcome of the referendum until a formal heading can be held. According to a press release from GRU, the hearing is is scheduled for Dec. 19-20. Gainesville city commissioners and Mayor Harvey Ward unanimously https://www.gainesville.com/story/news/local/2024/06/18/gainesville-commissioners-vote-on-gru-authority-ballot-measure/74141023007/ the measure to be placed on the ballot in June. \"I’ve said since March of 2023 that the people of Gainesville, who are the owners of these utilities, should have a voice in who governs their utilities. I continue to believe that, and I encourage the people to let their voices be heard at the polls,\" Ward said in a statement to The Sun on Thursday afternoon. Commissioner Bryan Eastman in an email to The Sun in September called the GRU Authority's filing of the emergency injunction \"absurd.\" \"... If we want a utility that is affordable, sustainable, and community-focused we need one that is accountable to the actual ratepayers, not political appointees of the governor,\" he wrote. \"That's just common sense. ... \"",

My dog doesn’t bite, but I think she might if pushed too far. My son’s specialty is hitting my dog with various objects. We have talked to him over and over and the behavior has not improved. What’s left?\nAnswer: Talking to toddlers about behavior is like barking at dogs about geometry: not a good use of time, and it doesn’t make sense.\nExplore 7 ways parents add to their child’s anxiety Toddlers don’t listen to words. They do notice action. Repeatedly using words with toddlers in the form of lectures or warnings is a particularly terrible idea. Instead, calmly empathize by echoing a Calm Signal (this sound or word or phrase is meant to supplant swearing) and take action.\nHere’s how I would do it:\nKid hits dog with a toy.\nKid Whisperer: Yeesh. (Kid Whisperer firmly but gently pulls the toy out of Kid’s hand. It’s a good idea to gently stabilize the lower arm below the elbow with one hand before pulling the toy with the other in order to not yank on the shoulder.) Yeesh. (Kid Whisperer takes the toy.) Yeesh. (Kid Whisperer puts the toy on a high shelf).\nKid totally freaks out, throwing himself on the floor.\nKid Whisperer: Yeesh. (Kid Whisperer walks away, sits in his favorite chair, and reads a newspaper.)\nKid does a surprisingly athletic burpee, runs at Kid Whisperer and tears away the newspaper.\nKid Whisperer: Yeesh. (Kid Whisperer picks up Kid. ) Yeesh. (Kid Whisperer carries kid to kid’s room.) Yeesh. (Kid Whisperer gently puts kid down in the middle of the room.) Yeesh.\nKid Whisperer: Please come back as soon as you can be nice to me and to Mr. Snugglepuss. I love you.\nKid Whisperer walks away, and if kid comes back un-nice, Kid Whisperer presses the “Yeesh” repeat key. If he comes back nice, he regains full citizenship in the home and is entitled to all of the benefits of such citizenship.",

Dog adoptions are also still open during the temporary closure, according to the release.\nAdoptions are set to reopen on Friday, Dec. 27.\nActive duty marine arrested in connection with body found in Mobile: Escambia County Sheriff’s Office Those looking to adopt a cat when the adoptions reopen can visit the Santa Rosa County Animal Shelter’s website to see all adoptable cats .\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

    "title": "Omnicom Media Group Clients Outperform in ANA’s Transparency Study - OMG Transformation",
    "text": "Best practices and partnerships made OMG clients stand-outs in 21-marketer study of programmatic media supply chain New York, NY (January 3, 2024) – Following the release of the [ANA Programmatic Media Supply Chain Transparency Study](https://www.ana.net/miccontent/show/id/rr-2023-12-ana-programmatic-media-supply-chain-transparency-study) Complete Report earlier this month, Omnicom Media Group (OMG), the media services division of Omnicom Group Inc. (NYSE: OMC) today revealed outcomes for participating OMG clients that effectively demonstrate the impact that adoption of shared standards and best practices – such as those recommended by the ANA and already established within OMG – can have on programmatic supply chain transparency and ROI. The ANA study – which analyzed campaign data from 21 marketers and encompassed $123 million in ad spend between September 2022 and January 2023 – revealed that only 36 cents of every dollar that enters a demand-side platform reaches a consumer, while 29 cents goes toward fees to ad-tech intermediaries, and 35 cents toward low-quality media, including invalid traffic and made-for-advertising (MFA), non-viewable and non-measurable inventory. However, OMG clients who participated in the study saw results that starkly contrasted to the aggregate group outcome, including earning the highest possible marks – above the 90th percentile – for premium inventory; <0.1% Made For Advertising (MFA) delivery compared to a market average of 15% of total spend allocation; 0.0% cheap reach as defined as “chronically unviewable placements”; and Best-in-class DSP platform rates in the highest quintile grouping. “The difference between the aggregate outcomes and OMG clients’ results stems from our relentless commitment to setting standards and best practices that enable transparency, control, safety, and effectiveness,” says OMG Managing Director for Digital Activation Ryan Eusanio, who led the development of [OMG’s Supply- Side Platform (SSP) Standardization Initiative](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/as-mfa-issues-puts-programmatic-curation-center-stage-omnicom-media-groups-ssp-standardization-initiative-assures-premium-inventory-that-delivers-on-value-and-values-mandates-301959801.html) that informs all OMG programmatic partnerships and spend. OMG’s programmatic standards ensure alignment between buyers and sellers in delivering on four key advertiser rights: deciding where their ads are going to appear, determining who sees their ads; knowing how and where their ads were delivered and to whom; and having confidence that they are only paying for impressions served to human beings. The impact of combining standards-driven negotiation and the best practices for activation and optimization enabled by Omnicom’s Omni open operating system can be seen in the OMG client spend analyzed over the course of the ANA study, which was supported by the following: - Expert-reviewed inclusion lists by format → Prioritizes quality inventory over MFA sites and “Cheap Reach” - Best-in-class OMG-negotiated Ad tech relationships → Reduced tech costs - Partner-direct Deal Library → Improved curation on quality inventory at efficient prices - Industry-leading Supply Path Optimization efforts → Remove resellers and low-performing supply paths Offering real -world evidence of the positive impact of standards -based decisioning, the performance of OMG clients in the ANA transparency study validates the ANA recommendations for optimizing investment in programmatic media, which offer a similar roadmap as OMG’s established best practices, aimed at reaching the same goal: creating more transparent supply paths through enabling collaboration between the buy and sell side. “The marketers winning in programmatic advertising are those which take an active interest in media, They ask questions, get answers, take action, and improve performance. And they work with agenda partners who understand that and are proactive on their behalf.” Bill Duggan, Group EVP at ANA. “As a State Farm partner, Omnicom Media Group has been a game-changer for our programmatic media strategy. The outstanding outcomes outlined in the study affirm the agency’s commitment to transparency, standards, and innovation that deliver measurable results. Understanding where our ads are delivered and how they’re purchased are a key part of proving the effectiveness of our advertising,” said Alyson Griffin, Head of Marketing at State Farm.",
