[Sign in.](/member-login?redirect=opinions/more-government-hostility-to-religion-1716500827) Recently, Arizona governor Katie Hobbs vetoed a bill which would require public schools to post the Ten Commandments. Other states are considering similar laws, but with the stroke of a pen, Hobbs killed the legislation and never gave the bill a chance. A similar fate may be true in Itasca County, Minn. There, a new county jail included a display of the Ten Commandments in the gymnasium. But even before the building opened, there were complaints about the display. The county is weighing whether or not to paint over the words, which the sheriff said were “meant to be an encouragement” to inmates. These are just two examples of government officials who, whether out of agreement, ignorance, or fear, followed the suggestion of activist organizations who for years campaigned to remove any vestiges of religious texts inscribed in the fabric of public settings. In their possession as they wreaked havoc across America’s landscape was a three-pronged test from a Supreme Court decision dating back to 1971 known widely as “the Lemon test.” The Lemon test was used to justify their actions, which often involved removing a display of the Ten Commandments, asked three questions: Does this serve a secular purpose? Does this advance or inhibit religion? Does this foster an excessive government entanglement with religion? One by one, any item with religious associations came down regardless of how long it adorned the wall of a public building. But that was then. This is now. In 2022, in a 6-3 decision in Kennedy v Bremerton, the U.S. Supreme Court determined that Lemon was contradictory to what the Founders intended, saying, “This Court long ago abandoned Lemon and its endorsement test offshoot. … In place of Lemon and the endorsement test, this Court has instructed that the Establishment Clause must be interpreted by reference to historical practices and understandings.” This decision came on the heels of another pronouncement by the Court in 2019 where, in The American Legion v. American Humanist Association, the Justices determined that a cross shaped 100-year-old WWI memorial on public land was perfectly constitutional. There, Justice Alito warned, “A government that roams the land, tearing down monuments with religious symbolism and scrubbing away any reference to the divine, will strike many as aggressively hostile to religion.” If the Lemon test was the justification for erasing or preventing the display of the Ten Commandments, it’s time for government officials to recognize that it has been laid to rest on the ash heap of bad Supreme Court decisions. If their decisions to erase religious displays is about “preventing an excessive government entanglement with religion,” they are wrong. If they are concerned about the appearance of religious imagery on the walls of public buildings, maybe they should take a field trip to the nation’s capital and go on a walking tour of the magnificent buildings that proudly display depictions of the Ten Commandments. Just consider the Supreme Court building where Kennedy and American Legion cases were heard and the decisions rendered. On the lower portions of the huge wooden doors leading into the Supreme Court chambers, there is a symbolic representation of the two tablets of the Ten Commandments. Inside the courtroom, above the bench where the Supreme Court Justices hear arguments, is a marble frieze with figures representing the majesty of law and the power of government. Between them is a relief of the Roman numerals I through X. Another display of the Ten Commandments. Removing all the references of the Biblical Decalogue built into the architecture of government buildings throughout Washington, D.C., would require jackhammers, chisels, and high-powered sand blasters to erase the history and tradition in the foundation of the United States. Why is such prominence given to the Ten Commandments displayed in multiple government buildings? Are they truly part of the history and tradition of this country? Maybe John Quincy Adams provided the best answer to that question: “The law given from Sinai was a civil and municipal as well as a moral and religious code; it contained many statutes ... of universal application—laws essential to the existence of men in society, and most of which have been enacted by every nation which ever professed any code of laws.” If you enjoyed this article and would like to support WORLD's brand of Biblically sound journalism, [click here](https://give.wng.org/).

    "text": "LISTEN TO TLR’S LATEST PODCAST:\nBy Ted Goodman\nUnion-backed groups, including the Fight for $15 movement, are deploying dishonest tactics, flawed surveys and paid protesters in an attempt to smear President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for labor secretary, according to a recent report.\nLabor groups and activists are engaged in a full-court press against the nomination of Andy Puzder to lead the Department of Labor. Puzder, the CEO of CKE Restaurants, which owns the Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr. brands, is a vocal critic of President Barack Obama’s labor policies and the Fight for $15. (RELATED: Trump To Nominate ‘Fight For $15′ Critic For Labor Sec.)\nThe dishonest tactics employed by those opposed to Trump’s nominee include a flawed survey released by a union-backed group on Jan. 10, according a Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) report released Tuesday.\n“Ultimately, the questionable tactics pursued by the Restaurant Opportunities Center and Fight for $15 to smear Puzder show more about them than him,” Trey Kovacs, labor policy expert at CEI, asserted. “Labor unions and the like should get used to proving their merit to workers rather than relying on intimidation and coercive tactics,” he continued.\nThe union-backed Restaurant Opportunities Center (ROC) released a survey of Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr. employees, claiming that two-thirds of women in the survey said that they had been sexually harassed on the job.\nAccording to FiveThirtyEight, the group used a deeply inaccurate method to survey employees. The group sought out CKE Restaurant workers on social media to participate in their survey, according to FiveThirtyEight. The group communicated with 900 employees, and said it successfully interviewed 564 about the working conditions inside Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr. restaurants.\nThe problem with the approach, according to the chief methodologist at the Urban Institute, Robert Santos, is that there was no way to effectively determine if the respondents were even human beings. Additionally, according to Santos, it was a self-selected group, where it was likely that workers who have experienced problems were much more likely to respond to the survey.\nAdditional tactics include reports that individuals have been paid to protest Puzder, with evidence that many of those at recent protests are unaware of who Andy Puzder even is. (RELATED: Fight For $15 Activists Paid Actors To Protest Trump’s Labor Pick)\nIn a video produced by the conservative research group, America Rising Squared, likely paid protesters do not know who Andy Puzder is, and are unable to explain why they are protesting.\nWATCH:\nThe Fight for $15, backed by the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), is wary of Puzder for labor. The fast food magnate has said that a $15 minimum wage would only result in the replacement of low wage workers by automation.\nA recent report from CNN suggested that Puzder may remove himself from consideration for the nomination, amid reports that he is growing wary of the intense scrutiny and questionable tactics being employed by his opponents. (RELATED: Trump’s Labor Pick May Drop Out)\nPuzder’s confirmation hearing were pushed back until after the inauguration, and will likely take place in early February. Puzder has yet to complete his paperwork, but said on Twitter after reports surfaced that he may drop out, that he “looked forward to his hearing.”\nFollow Ted on Twitter\nSend Tips to .\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
