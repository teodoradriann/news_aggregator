    "title": "Daddy Yankee regresa y estrenará canción este Viernes Santo en homenaje a Jesucristo - BluRadio",
    "text": "El cantante puertorriqueño [Daddy Yankee](https://www.bluradio.com/entretenimiento/proyecto-uno-anhela-un-remix-de-el-tiburon-con-daddy-yankee-cb20) anunció el jueves, 28 de marzo, que lanzará la noche de este Viernes Santo la canción 'Donante de Sangre' para rendir homenaje a Jesucristo, tras su anuncio en diciembre de que dedicaría su vida a Cristo. \"Yo fui sano por su sangre, libre camino por su sangre, soy diferente a lo que era antes\", menciona el apodado como 'Jefe del Reguetón' o 'The Big Boss', en una estrofa de la canción que se publicará a las 00.00 horas de Puerto Rico (04.00 GMT). Yankee en este tema destaca la importancia de valores como la fe, la humildad y la gratitud, por encima del ego, la fama y el dinero. Raymond Ayala, nombre de pila del artista anunció en diciembre en Puerto Rico, al completar su quinto concierto ‘La Meta’, con el que finalizó su carrera artística, que se acababa una historia e iba \"a comenzar una nueva historia, un nuevo comienzo\", el de vivir su vida para Cristo. Publicidad De esta manera, Daddy Yankee se une a Héctor ‘El Father’, Farruko, Voltio, Gocho, Jomar ‘El Caballo Negro’, Larry Over y El Sica entre los varios artistas urbanos que han decidido dejar la música y seguir el Evangelio. Yankee arrancó su carrera musical a principios de la década de 1990 en el disco ‘Playero 34’, del productor musical DJ Playero, y donde por primera vez el intérprete mencionó la palabra reguetón o reggaeton. Publicidad Debido al talento que DJ Playero vio en el joven promesa, decidió ubicarlo en sus siguientes producciones, que le catapultaron en Puerto Rico, aunque su estrellato a nivel internacional lo logró en 2004 con el tema ‘Gasolina’. Su último álbum, 'Legendaddy', que superó los 600 millones de reproducciones en menos de un mes, contó con colaboraciones de artistas como Bad Bunny, Rauw Alejandro, Pitbull, Natti Natasha y Becky G.",

    "text": "Man hospitalised by peanut allergy now eats nuts daily following ‘life-changing’ trial\nA new trial gives \"hope\" to thousands of people who suffer from nut allergies\nA 44-year-old man with a life-threatening peanut allergy can now eat a handful of peanuts every morning as part of his daily routine, thanks to a \"life-changing\" medical study.\nRichard Lassiter, who has experienced multiple hospitalisations due to accidental peanut exposure, now consumes four peanuts each morning, describing it as \"taking his medicine\".\nLassiter's severe allergy previously dictated his life, requiring constant vigilance to avoid even trace amounts of peanuts.\nThis new development offers a glimpse into a future where adults with peanut allergies might be able to live without the constant fear of accidental exposure.\nExperts highlight that previous desensitisation studies primarily focused on children, leaving adults with limited treatment options.\nThis new research, however, suggests that similar treatments could be effective for adults, potentially revolutionising allergy care. While further research is needed, the study's success provides hope for thousands of adults living with the daily challenges of severe peanut allergies.\nHealth officials said the trial gives \"hope\" to thousands of people. The peanut desensitisation, also known as oral immunotherapy, works by introducing micro amounts of peanuts and gradually increasing the dosage to build up immunity.\nMr Lassiter, an executive coach from Beckenham in Greater London, was diagnosed with a peanut allergy as a child.\nHe told the PA news agency that he “managed” his condition but always felt nervous eating out.\n“I had a really severe episode on our once-in-a-lifetime holiday to Chile with my wife in 2018 that changed everything,” he said.\nHe said that the episode occurred when they were on holiday “1,000 miles from anywhere” when he was given food with peanuts in.\nMr Lassiter took his auto-injector pen, and his inhaler to ease his breathing, and was taken to hospital by ambulance.\nHe had to stay in a high dependency unit overnight where he needed adrenaline and oxygen.\n“It was a real shock, because obviously we’re a long way away from home,” he told PA.\n“I recall saying to my wife: ‘I can’t keep dealing with this, it’s just so terrifying’.”\nOn another occasion, during a meal out in Soho in London, Mr Lassiter said that he accidentally ate peanuts after they were hidden under some ice cream.\n“Within a few seconds, I knew I was in trouble.\n“By the time I was in St Thomas’s it was pretty bad – I remember I’d swollen up to a huge size relative to my normal size and asking the nurse if I was going to make it.”\nSpeaking about the new study, he said: “I got to the point where I was having a total of four peanuts a day, which I still take to this day.\n“This morning I had my four peanuts after I ate my breakfast, as if it was some sort of a teaspoon of medicine.”\nHe added: “It’s been life-changing for me – it’s increased my confidence immeasurably.\n“It’s had a huge effect on my life. I feel much calmer, much happier and really excited about the ability to do all of these things in the future.”\nResearchers from King’s College London and Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust stressed that this type of treatment should only be initiated under very close supervision.\nTheir new study, published in the journal Allergy, saw 18 adults with a typical peanut allergy gradually desensitised to peanuts.\nAfter their allergy was confirmed by teams in hospital, patients were given small amounts of peanut flour to eat at home, starting with the equivalent of 0.5% to 1% of a whole peanut.\nTheir dosage increased gradually and once they could tolerate 50-100mg of peanut protein they were switched to eating whole peanuts, peanut butter or peanut products.\nBy the end of the study, which was funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research, two thirds (67%) were able to eat the equivalent of five peanuts without reacting.\nChief investigator Stephen Till, professor of allergy at King’s College London and consultant allergist at Guy’s and St Thomas’, told the PA news agency: “The problem is that once I see (adult) patients in my clinic, there’s been nothing that we’ve been able to do to them – we can’t offer them desensitisation because the data is all from young children – in medicine you can’t give treatment to children or to adults based on a clinical trial that’s been performed in the other group.\n“So we have got this sort of, and continue to have this sort of big unmet need of adults with peanut allergy.”\nHe added: “We were really pleased because we got the evidence that we hoped we would get – we saw results that were broadly in line with with what been obtained from studies in young children.\n“Our phase two study suggests that this treatment is is potentially effective in adults.”\nBut he said larger studies were needed to confirm findings and stressed that food immunotherapy “definitely must be done under very close clinical supervision”.\nCommenting on the study, public health minister Ashley Dalton said: “This ground-breaking research offers hope to thousands living with peanut allergies.\n“For too long, people have navigated daily life in fear of accidental exposure that could be life-threatening.”\nProfessor Lucy Chappell, chief scientific adviser at the Department of Health and Social Care and chief executive of the NIHR said: “These results mark an important milestone in allergy treatment and offers new hope to adults living with peanut allergies.\n“For adults who have long lived with the daily burden and fear of accidental exposure they may have a pathway toward greater safety and an improved quality of life.”\nCommenting on the study, Adam Fox, chair of the National Allergy Study Group, and professor of paediatric allergy at King’s College London, said: “Conventional wisdom has been that oral immunotherapy for food is really just for children and there is clear evidence that the younger it is started, the safer and better the outcome.\n“However, that doesn’t mean that the benefits would not still be worthwhile for adults, and this study shows that for many, oral immunotherapy for peanut at least, can still make a real difference.\n“This is only a small study and we hope to see larger studies to follow, but it’s an important proof of principle that this may well be a treatment for adults too.\n“However, this treatment requires careful medical supervision and should never be attempted without this.”\nJoin our commenting forum\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\nComments",

    "text": "PHNOM PENH - In a small warehouse in Cambodia’s capital, a group of workers sits and spins waste plastic bottles into strips, turning them into bristles for brooms, of which they churn out 500 each day.\nFor the past 11 months, they have transformed around 40 tonnes of discarded plastic bottles, or about 5,000 bottles a day, by “upcycling” them into brooms they say are more robust than regular brushes.\nThose sell for 10,000 riel (S$3.30) and 15,000 riel each.\nPlastic strips from the empty bottles are collected into a bundle on a machine, before being softened in hot water and sliced evenly to be sewn with metal wires into the ends of a bamboo stick.\nCambodian entrepreneur Has Kea, 41, wants to reduce plastic pollution in his community, in a city that produces up to 38,000 tonnes of all types of waste each day, according to its environmental department.\nAbout one-fifth of that is single-use plastic that ends up in landfills and waterways.\n“This broom is quite solid, not easy to break,” said Mr Suon Kosal, a 26-year-old Buddhist monk whose temple bought 80 of the brooms in January.\nMr Kea buys empty plastic bottles from trash collectors and garbage depots. With the seemingly endless supply, he is confident about the longevity of his business.\nHe is also open to competitors stepping in to the market.\n“This also helps reduce pollution to the environment and encourages people to collect plastic bottles to sell to us at a higher price, which in turn could earn them a better living,” he said.

    "text": "Flooding, thunderstorm risk, Auckland, Northland, Coromandel under heavy rain watch Flooding, thunderstorm risk, Auckland, Northland, Coromandel under heavy rain watch Almost a full day of rain is likely for parts of New Zealand today and tonight, with the upper North Island and the west of the South Island in for heavy rain through to tomorrow. Hikers, campers and New Year’s Eve revellers are being warned to take care as thunderstorms, slips and flooding - including flooded rivers - are possible in the worst-hit areas. A warm, moist northwesterly flow is bringing rain or showers to all parts of the country, with thunderstorms possible in northern and western parts of both islands and the Deep South. Flood risk north of Auckland This afternoon MetService added heavy rain watches for Northland, Coromandel and Auckland, where rain has already been bucketing down since lunchtime. Those regions are now set for periods of heavy rain with possible thunderstorms. Rain levels could approach or even exceed warning criteria in localised areas, the forecaster warned. Downpours of 25-40mm per hour were possible. Thunderstorms and “very heavy, slow moving rain” meant there was a risk of pockets of flooding around the Northland-Auckland boundary this afternoon, according to forecaster Weatherwatch.co.nz. MetService last night put weather watches and warnings in place from Waikato and Bay of Plenty down to Fiordland, with 100-160mm of rain possible in some warning areas. The west of the South Island is bearing the brunt of the bad weather, along with Taranaki, which has been hit by torrential rain since this morning. A heavy rain warning is in place for Taranaki Maunga through till 3am with a peak of 15-25 mm/h expected until mid-afternoon today. The Westland ranges are under a 21-hour heavy rain warning until 6am Saturday, with 100-140 mm of rain expected over that time and peak rates of 20-30mm/h. Nelson has a heavy rain warning until 7pm tonight with up to 90mm of rain in total. Heavy rain watches lasting 22 hours are in place for Buller, Waikato, Waitomo, Taumarunui, Taupō, Tongariro National Park and the Kaimanawa Mountains, while Fiordland’s watch lasts for 20 hours. In the Bay of Plenty including Rotorua a heavy rain watch is in place till 10am Saturday. Rainfall amounts could reach warning criteria in all those areas, with thunderstorms also possible in many areas. Heavy rain means streams and rivers can rise rapidly and driving conditions may be hazardous, with possible surface flooding and slips. Thunderstorms are also possible in many areas, bringing intense localised downpours, according to MetService. The national forecaster’s meteorologist John Law said those thinking of going camping should keep an eye on the forecasts to avoid being stranded by sudden floods or slips. With heavy rain also expected across the Tararua Ranges and the Tongariro Crossing, keen hikers should also take care, Law said. New Year’s Day to bring drier weather for 2024 The fast-moving weather system should improve by mid-Saturday but another front will bring more rain on Sunday, MetService says. But there’s good news as 2024 dawns - both MetService and private forecaster WeatherWatch expect the weather to clear for New Year’s Day. WeatherWatch head forecaster Philip Duncan said a big block of high pressure coming in from the Tasman Sea and Southern Ocean will bring clearing, cooler weather on January 1, with the recent high humidity taking a break.

    "text": "‘rebuild babri masjid’: slogans emerge on jnu walls ahead of ram temple inauguration\nNew Delhi: Ahead of the scheduled inauguration of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya next month, slogans demanding the rebuilding of the Babri Masjid have surfaced on the walls of the Language Study Centre at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). Students on Wednesday night saw these slogans on the campus, and photos of the graffiti were widely shared on social media on Thursday. The slogans were found above the name of the National Students’ Union of India (NSUI), the Congress’s student wing.\nHowever, the NSUI distanced itself from the controversy. Sudhanshu Shekhar, the president of NSUI’s JNU unit, pointed out that the organization’s name was already present in black marker, and the slogans were added later in red marker. Shekhar alleged that this was an attempt to tarnish NSUI’s image and called for stringent action from the JNU administration.\nJNU’s chief security officer, Naveen Yadav, claimed to be unaware of the incident. He mentioned that slogans targeting a specific caste had been written a few months ago, but no investigation had taken place. There was no immediate response from the JNU vice-chancellor and the registrar.\nPrevious incidents at JNU include anti-Brahmin slogans like ‘There will be blood’ painted on the walls of the School of Languages and School of International Studies last December, and messages related to Kashmir found two months ago. Satish Garkoti, rector of JNU, had mentioned a committee’s formation to look into repeated incidents of “anti-national” slogans on the campus and the installation of CCTVs in strategic locations.\nThe revised Chief Proctor Office manual has a provision for a fine of Rs 10,000 for writing controversial slogans. However, the Language Study Centre does not have CCTV coverage to check the defacement of walls.",
