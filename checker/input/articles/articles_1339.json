    "text": "COMMERCE TOWNSHIP, Mich. – The water temperature right now is in the 40s, but that’s not stopping one woman from jumping into the water every day in December. Each plunge raises money for charity. It’s all being done to spread mental health awareness, but how Kristina Camaj is doing it is pretty unique. “I wanted to do 31 Polar Plunges in 31 days in honor of the people that aren’t able to see 31 years old and in honor of the people who need our help,” Camaj said. For every day in December, Camaj is jumping into a body of water in the state of Michigan. It’s an effort to bring more attention to mental health and [the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention](https://afsp.org/). It’s a personal mission for Camaj, who lost her boyfriend to suicide. “If anyone has ever been through grief, they know that it’s ocean waves, right? It comes so strongly in your heart to where you are debilitated,” Camaj said. “It was hard. I was 22 years old when he passed away and we were together for over six years. So you know he was a huge part of my life. And he was my best friend.” Now she feels this is all she can do in hopes of saving the lives of others. Her mission, [Project Ice Woman](https://www.youtube.com/@ProjectIceWoman) has been so great, that many people have followed suit on several occasions, jumping into the water themselves. “We got 30 people to jump in the water altogether. Some were family members, some were strangers, some were neighbors,” Camaj said. “It was a dream come true. It was epic, honestly.” If anything, her wish would be just to change the life of one person. “If we’re able to help each other and lend a helping hand? Do it,” Camaj said. “A positive impact can go such a far way and that’s what I hope to be spreading, to not just Detroit, but the entire world.” She will be ending the month with her last jump on Sunday, Dec. 31, but she’s not stopping. “I’m going to keep going,” Camaj said. We want to honor those making a difference. [Click here to nominate someone who’s Going 4 It in your community](https://www.clickondetroit.com/go4it/#//).

    "title": "‘Calm, cool, collected,’ Davis Mills delivers sharp performance, Texans fall to Bears in weather-shortened game",
    "text": "CANTON, Ohio – Before a heavy rainstorm and lightning strikes in the area ultimately ended the football game, Davis Mills was rifling passes and improvising to lead the Texans’ offense.\nMills delivered an impressive performance in the Texans’ weather-abbreviated Hall of Fame game against the Chicago Bears at Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium.\nRecommended Videos\nThe Texans’ backup quarterback completed 10 of 13 passes for 102 yards, one touchdown pass to tight end Teagan Quitoriano and no interceptions for a crisp 124.5 passer rating. The game was halted in the third quarter by the NFL with the Texans trailing Chicago, 21-17.\n“Davis did a really nice job, really commanding the offense, really being efficient in the passing game,” Texans coach DeMeco Ryans said. “I like what Davis did tonight and it’s something that he can continue to build on.”\n#Texans coach DeMeco Ryans on weather-shortened preseason game @ProFootballHOF and performances by Davis Mills, Cam Akers and Xavier Hutchinson @KPRC2 pic.twitter.com/OEnQ6RWMvF\n— Aaron Wilson (@AaronWilson_NFL) August 2, 2024 The way that Mills engineered a game-opening, 13-play, 74-yard drive for a touchdown capped by his nine-yard score to Quitoriano, who injured his knee in the first half and didn’t return, was impressive.\nHe connected with four different receivers, including 12-yard and 11-yard passes to Quitoriano and rookie tight end Cade Stover.\n“Davis was great,” said wide receiver Xavier Hutchinson, who led the Texans with five catches for 56 yards on six targets. “Cool, calm and collected guy, that’s how he was in the huddle. You could see it in the play.”\nMills went off-schedule to elude pressure and find wide receiver Ben Skowronek on a 27-yard jump ball that represented the Texans’ longest play of the night.\n“It’s a great opportunity to go out there and play live football,” said Mills, a former third-round draft pick from Stanford who backs up Pro Bowl quarterback C.J. Stroud. We’ve been grinding so far during camp and it’s a battle each and every day going against our own guys.\n“So, it’s fun to actually go out there and play a different opponent, different scheme and really see how the hard work we are putting in pays off. Obviously, we still have a long way to go but I thought the guys that stepped up today played well and executed their job.”\nThe Texans ran a limited version of their offense, because they’re playing the Bears in the second week of the regular season in a Sunday night game at NRG Stadium.\n“Not much, especially because we play these guys again,” Mills said. “We didn’t want to show too much. Obviously, we’re kind of running the foundation of our offense. The scheme that we install on those first couple of installs, so I think we executed that at a high level, for the most part. I think there’s still some stuff we have in the bag when we see these guys again pretty soon.”\n#Texans wide receiver Xavier Hutchinson on his five catch game and progress he's made overall @KPRC2 pic.twitter.com/4lwi3krKg4\n— Aaron Wilson (@AaronWilson_NFL) August 2, 2024 Skowronek, acquired in a trade from the Los Angeles Rams this offseason in exchange for a seventh-round draft pick, saw a lot of positive things from Mills.\n“I thought he was real efficient,” Skowronek said. “Real efficient, got out there, progressed through reads well and delivered the ball.”\nMills showed a presence before, during and after the play.\n“He did good,” Texans guard Kenyon Green said. “He commanded the huddle. He made sure the ball was distributed. He was a leader out there. It was good.”\nThe Texans ultimately didn’t get to finish the game, but they accomplished most of the things on their agenda.\n‘It was a good opportunity,” Ryans said. “All of our guys probably didn’t get as much as we would have liked because of the weather, but things happen, things out of our control. Our guys have been through that tough weather in Houston things we can’t control, but no one complained about it. We just keep moving forward.”\n#Texans wide receiver Ben Skowronek @BennySkow makes successful debut with new team after offseason trade from #Rams @ProFootballHOF @KPRC2 pic.twitter.com/4gtnCH5pez\n— Aaron Wilson (@AaronWilson_NFL) August 2, 2024 Aaron Wilson is a Texans and NFL reporter for KPRC 2 and click2houston.com\nCopyright 2024 by KPRC Click2Houston - All rights reserved.",

    "text": "Pro-Putin regional politician found dead outside his house By Mariya Knight and David Shortell, CNN (CNN) — A politician from the party of Russian President Vladimir Putin has been found dead in a courtyard outside his home, local media reported Thursday, adding to the growing list of Russian elites who have died under unclear circumstances in recent months. Vladimir Egorov, a Tobolsk City Duma Deputy from the ruling United Russia party, was reportedly 46 at the time of his death, which was reported by Russian newspaper Kommersant, citing the press service of the Investigative Committee for the Tyumen Region in Russia. There were no “external signs of criminal death” on Egorov’s body, investigators told Kommersant. The committee “could not confirm the information about the circumstances of the deputy’s death” to Kommersant, it said, as they are “still conducting an autopsy.” Russian state media TASS meanwhile reported on Thursday that Egorov “was found dead in Tobolsk,” also citing the regional committee. And unofficial Telegram channel Baza – which has links to Russian security services – said Egorov’s body “was discovered in the courtyard of his house on Kedrovaya Street” on Wednesday. Kommersant and TASS reported that investigators are still establishing the causes of Egorov’s death, while the Tobolsk City Duma published an obituary on its social media page Thursday saying that Egorov died “as a result of an accident.” The Duma praised Egorov – its deputy chairman before his death – for providing “comprehensive support to the participants of the Special Military Operation and the families of military personnel” fighting in Ukraine and for taking “an active part in the social and political life of the city.” He joins a list of prominent Russians who have died by suicide or in unexplained accidents in recent months and years, including several businessmen with ties to Russia’s two largest energy companies. Among that group was Ravil Maganov, the chairman of Lukoil, Russia’s second biggest oil and gas company, which had previously taken the unusual public stance of speaking out against Russia’s war in Ukraine. [Maganov died after falling out of the window](https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/01/business/lukoil-chairman-dies/index.html) of a hospital in Moscow, according to Russian state news agency TASS. Russian sausage magnate-turned-lawmaker [Pavel Antov](https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/27/business/russian-deaths-india-pavel-antov-intl/index.html), another member of the United Russia party who topped Forbes ranking of the 100 richest civil servants in Russia in 2018, died in India last December after falling from the third floor of his hotel, according to the Indian police.
