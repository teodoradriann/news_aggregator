Así, los GAL ASIR y Muntanya de Alicante, Rurable y Turia Calderona de Valencia y Castellón Sur han impulsado 'Saborigen' un proyecto de cooperación para promocionar al producto y los productores de las zonas de actuación de los GAL. Con 'Saborigen' se propiciará una inversión en la zona de 183.666,17 euros procedentes del Programa de Desarrollo Rural de la Comunitat Valenciana. Bajo el lema \"Elige rural, artesano y de calidad. Alimenta la felicidad de km0\" se quiere dar voz a los productores del territorio y crear una red de trabajo que una a productores y clientes gracias a la creación de un directorio de empresas del sector, la difusión de contenidos directos y variados a través de las redes sociales y la participación en ferias y eventos de promoción. 'Saborigen' nace como un proyecto esencial y vital para el desarrollo y futuro de las localidades rurales de la Comunidad participantes. \"Esta iniciativa de cooperación responde a la necesidad de visibilizar las profesiones vinculadas al sector de la alimentación, haciendo hincapié en los pequeños productores pertenecientes a los diferentes Grupos de Acción Local cooperantes en el proyecto\" han afirmado desde la gestión de 'Saborigen', al tiempo que han afirmado que el sector agroalimentario \"juega un papel de vital importancia en el desarrollo de los territorios rurales, ya que contribuye a la creación de empleo, así como al mantenimiento de las tradiciones y el uso sostenible de los recursos rurales\". Con 'Saborigen' se busca potenciar el trabajo en equipo y la colaboración entre los productores locales. Por ello, se anima a todas las personas y empresas del territorio dedicadas al sector agroalimentario a contactar con la organización para adherirse al proyecto de forma totalmente gratuita. Gracias al directorio se abrirá la oportunidad de colaborar entre agentes agroalimentarios y otros agentes implicados en el sector, fomentando la sensibilización y concienciación de la población sobre la importancia del consumo de productos kilómetro 0, cercanos y de calidad.",

    "text": "A Singapore Airlines Airbus A380-800 bound for Singapore Changi Airport (SIN) was forced to return to Sydney Kingsford Smith International Airport (SYD) shortly after takeoff due to a technical issue.\nFlight SQ 232 took off from SYD at 11:04 local time on April 7, 2024, but stopped its climb shortly after departure.\nThe 13-year old A380 (registered 9V-SKM), entered a hold at 10,000 feet to lose fuel weight before landing safely back at SYD.\nThe aircraft touched down at SYD airport at approximately 12:42 local time.\nAn airline representative told Channel News Asia that the technical issue was related to the aircraft’s flaps.\nAirplane flaps are used to generate more lift at slower airspeed, which enables the aircraft to fly at a greatly reduced speed with a lower risk of stalling. The flaps are most useful during takeoff and landing.\nThe technical issue was resolved on the ground at Sydney Airport and the flight was able to depart once more for Singapore at 16:19 local time. The flight arrived at SIN airport at 22:24 local time, almost five hours delayed from its original ETA.\nIn its statement to Channel News Asia, Singapore Airlines said it apologized to all affected customers for any inconvenience caused, adding that the safety of its customers and crew is its “top priority.”",

    "title": "Florida Sen. Rick Scott says his Naples home was ‘swatted’ while at dinner - The Washington Post",
    "text": "The home of Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) was swatted Wednesday night in an incident he described as a “sick attempt to terrorize my family.” Scott tweeted that the “cowards” who had swatted his home had “wasted the time [and] resources of our law enforcement.” Swatting occurs when people make false reports of ongoing or recent crimes, leading law enforcement personnel to rush to the scenes. Naples police are investigating the incident and have not yet identified a suspect or a motive, McGinn said. A spokesman for Scott said there were no additional details immediately available. The attempt was one in a string of swatting episodes against politicians in recent days, including in Ohio , Georgia and New York . Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) said she had been swatted on Christmas Day , while her family was home celebrating the holiday. On Wednesday night, the Naples Police Department received a non-emergency call from a person claiming he had “shot his wife with an AR-15 three times while she was sleeping,” according to the incident report. The caller also told the dispatcher he was holding a hostage and demanded $10,000, saying he would “blow up the house” with a pipe bomb if he was not given the money, the report states. Police said the caller, who said his name was Jamal, did not provide additional identifying information. The caller’s voice also “sounded as if it was computer generated/artificial,” according to the department’s release. Officers who searched Scott’s home on Wednesday found no signs of forced entry or the pipe bomb and other items described by the caller, police said. Several recent swatting attempts have targeted Republican figures such as Scott. Rep. Brandon Williams (R-N.Y.), tweeted on Tuesday that he had also been swatted on Christmas in an incident that put his “family’s lives at risk.” Greene tweeted that the Christmas swatting call was “like the 8th” she had experienced, later adding that similar incidents occurred at the homes of her two daughters. “Whoever is doing this, you are going to get caught and it won’t be funny to you anymore,” Greene wrote, describing the hoaxes as “police harassment.” At least four Georgia state senators and Republican Lt. Gov. Burt Jones have also been swatted over the last week, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported . Earlier this week, Republican Rep. Kevin Miller of Ohio said he had been swatted when police received a report of a shooting at his home. Miller called the incident “a huge waste of resources” in a statement on The Naples Police Department said while swatting isn’t a new threat, it has evolved, with offenders using new technology when calling in false reports. “The response often prompts confusion on the part of the homeowners and pulls limited resources away from other possible valid emergencies,” the department said in its statement.",

Follow @ulalaunch for the latest on launch, and learn more about what to expect from the mission here: https://t.co/FngVeU8Bm6 pic.twitter.com/JKi3jkcAwu\n— Amazon News (@amazonnews) April 2, 2025 Amazon añadió que la iniciativa Kuiper incluirá en total más de 3.200 satélites avanzados en la órbita terrestre baja (a una altitud de 2.000 kilómetros o menos sobre la superficie de la Tierra).\nEl lanzamiento de los satélites de Amazon Una vez que todos los satélites se hayan separado del cohete, el equipo de Kuiper se hará cargo de su gestión desde su centro de operaciones en Redmon, Washington (EE.UU.), aclara la compañía.\n«Hemos realizado numerosas pruebas en tierra para preparar esta primera misión, pero hay cosas que solo se aprenden en el vuelo (…). Independientemente de cómo se desarrolle, este es solo el comienzo de nuestro viaje», apuntó -en el comunicado- Rajeev Badyal, vicepresidente del proyecto Kuiper.\nUnited Launch Alliance is readying the formidable #AtlasV 551 rocket to deliver the first production satellites into space for #Amazon 's #ProjectKuiper .\nLearn more about #Kuiper1 preparations in our preview blog: https://t.co/PGsfKDZlSZ pic.twitter.com/CxXh8obhIN\n— ULA (@ulalaunch) April 2, 2025 Según la empresa, los satélites de esta misión son «una mejora significativa» de dos satélites prototipo que probó durante su misión Protoflight en octubre de 2023, de manera que se ha mejorado el rendimiento de todos los sistemas a bordo, incluidos los procesadores y los paneles solares.\nLa compañía indicó que la página web de la misión ofrecerá información actualizada sobre el lanzamiento, además de una retransmisión en directo que comenzará aproximadamente 20 minutos antes del despegue.\nCon Kuiper, Amazon competirá con otras empresas como Starlink -propiedad de Elon Musk-, que cuenta con más de 7.000 satélites de banda ancha, así como OneWeb o la china SpaceSail.",

    "text": "VENTURA, Calif. -- Massive surf is bringing danger and destruction to California's coast.\nLarge waves pounded Southern California's shores on Thursday, leading to flooding on coastal communities and multiple rescues by lifeguards.\nRELATED:\n Visitors from all over the world flock to Mavericks Beach as surfers brave massive waves\nStreets along Ventura's beach communities were coping with several feet of water, leaving multiple vehicles stranded. Lifeguards had to perform multiple rescues, in most cases of people who had gathered to watch the big waves from the sand but were caught up unexpectedly in them, sweeping them off their feet.\nOne video showed bystanders pulling a lifeguard out of the water with his arms after he apparently became exhausted trying to fight the powerful tow.\nAnother video showed a massive rogue wave breaching a low wall in Ventura, sending onlookers fleeing and sweeping up several of them in water. Officials say eight people were treated at local hospitals for injuries.\nRogue wave sends people fleeing along Ventura shoreline\nIn another video, a man went paddleboarding with his daughter along a flooded street.\nPeople who live in affected communities can't recall seeing waves this size, at least in the recent past.\n\"The waves were big,\" said Ventura resident Brian Scott. \"I mean, I'm a water guy. I sail, scuba dive. These were 15+ foot waves this morning at high tide. Never seen that. We've been here for 10 years.\"\nWhy is Southern California seeing massive waves? Dallas Raines explains\nA high surf advisory went into effect at 4 a.m. Thursday and will last through 10 p.m. Saturday.\nThe National Weather Service says some local areas could see waves up to 15 feet high. The Ventura County coast, and Hermosa, Manhattan and Palos Verdes beaches are expected to see the most significant impacts.\nThe state's central coast is also expected to be hit hard.\nSeveral cars were seen stuck on a flooded street near the beach. Lifeguards were warning people who had gathered to watch the big waves that they needed to move farther back from the water.\nIn Oxnard, streets near the beach were similarly flooded and several cars were trapped as well. All Oxnard public beaches are closed Friday through Sunday due to the high surf advisory.\nOfficials say flooding is possible in some low-lying areas.\nIn Newport Beach, residents were warned about the conditions and sand berms were replenished.\nCity officials said crews would be monitoring water levels and will pump water out if needed.\nMeanwhile, Los Angeles County beachgoers are urged to speak with lifeguards before going into the water.\nDespite the advisory, many surfers turned out at Seal Beach ready to catch some waves early Thursday morning.\n\"Seal Beach is kind of like a stadium. Everyone like's to come here. It's a easy, makeable wave... and everyone loves to be pumped to be here,\" said Jeff Brockman.",

    "text": "Baroni: \"La Lazio gioca e si diverte. Zaccagni capitano ma non è l'unico\" Il tecnico dei capitolini è intervenuto ai microfoni di Sky Sport per commentare la vittoria in Europa League contro la Real Sociedad 23.01 .2025 23:31 3 min\nMarco Baroni è intervenuto ai microfoni di Sky Sport per commentare la bella vittoria in Europa League della Lazio contro la Real Sociedad per 3-1 decisa dalle reti di Gila , Zaccagni e Castellanos . Il tecnico dei biancocelesti ha dichiarato: \" Vorrei che non passasse per normale il percorso che stanno facendo questi ragazzi. Sono orgoglioso di loro. La squadra mi stimola continuamente. Sono contento di allenare questa squadra. C’è ancora tanta strada e tanto lavoro ma so di contare su un gruppo che ha fame e che vuole migliorarsi “. Baroni h a poi aggiunto: “ l calcio si gioca con un pallone. Ottenere qualcosa di importante o non ottenerlo passa di lì. Non bisogna mai dare per scontato niente. Il primo deve essere il giocatore a pretendere di più da sé stesso ma non si deve mai mollare perché nel momento in cui penso di avere qualcosa davvero lo puoi perdere “.\nLe parole di Baroni A seguire, Baroni ha poi parlato dell’infortunio di Nuno Tavares : \" Il giocatore sembra si sia fermato nel momento giusto. Però è chiaro che per noi è molto importante, è una risorsa. Ora dobbiamo fare delle verifiche e vediamo un attimino “. Su tutta la rosa: “ Devo dire che dal primo giorno che ho parlato con la squadra, ho detto che non ho mai allenato un club così forte. Prima di tutto bisogna dare convinzione. Questo gruppo mi ha sorpreso per questa forza che ha trovato nel lavoro. Spesso la squadra gioca divertendosi e questa è la cosa più bella. Quando parlo di giocatori emotivi, voglio toccare questo tema. Un giocatore emotivo lo vedi per come si dedica all’interno della squadra. Questo è l’aspetto più importante “. E' arrivato poi un commento sul pressing alto della Lazio : “ Volevamo portare pressione a uomo e quando l’abbiamo fatto abbiamo recuperato palla alta. Specialmente avendo così tanti giocatori offensivi di qualità possiamo farlo. È stato anche fondamentale il ruolo degli attaccanti oggi\" . Baroni ha poi concluso: “ Nei momento difficili si vedono le squadre, questa è una crescita del gruppo. La squadra ha metabolizzato. Io dico sempre che si può perdere nel punteggio ma mai nella prestazione. La squadra ha sempre avuto delle reazioni importanti perché nell’aspetto della prestazione non bisogna uscire sconfitti “.\n© RIPRODUZIONE RISERVATA",
