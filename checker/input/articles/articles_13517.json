    "text": "REUTERS\nMembers of an 8,000-person strong migrant caravan were seen clinging to the sides of a train barreling toward the US southern border as they made their way toward El Paso, Texas.\nFootage posted online Thursday showed several dozen migrants clinging to the side of the so-called “The Beast” train as it passed through Chihuahua, Mexico.\nIt is believed the group is traveling to Juarez, Mexico, which is directly across the border from El Paso, where their asylum claims would be processed by Customs and Border Patrol agents and they would be allowed into the US.\nThe group is apparently hoping to arrive in Texas before a new state law goes into effect that would allow state police to arrest, jail, prosecute, and possibly even deport anyone who crosses the border illegally.\nThe law is set to go into effect in March but is already facing legal challenges from the Biden administration.\nA post shared by FitFam El Paso (@therealfitfamelpaso)\nA Justice Department official sent a letter to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Thursday saying that that the law was unconstitutional and “contrary to the US commitment of ensuring the processing of noncitizens consistent with the Immigration and Nationality Act.”\nIf the state starts to enforce the law, the Justice Department said it will file a lawsuit.\nBut the caravan making its way to the US threatens to further strain the already overburdened Border Patrol, which is seeing a record number of border crossings.\n9\nA massive migrant caravan comprising at least 8,000 people is making its way to the US.

La controversia por resolución ambiental del Gobierno que afectaría a Bogotá\nDiversos sectores han reaccionado frente a la resolución del Ministerio de Ambiente que contiene la planificación ambiental de la sabana de Bogotá.\nNoticias RCN\n06:23 p. m.\nUnirse al canal de Whatsapp de Noticias RCN\nHay controversia entre el Distrito y el Gobierno Nacional por una resolución que dejó la exministra de Ambiente, Susana Muhamad, que contiene la planificación ambiental para la sabana de Bogotá.\nPor un lado, el alcalde de Bogotá, Carlos Fernando Galán, aseguró que el proyecto de resolución para ordenamiento ambiental de la Sabana de Bogotá, viola la ley y es un nuevo ataque del Gobierno Nacional a la autonomía territorial.\nEl mandatario dijo que está de acuerdo en trabajar decisiones que permitan reducir el riesgo de afectación al medio ambiente, y solicitó que se retire el proyecto de resolución para construirlo mancomunadamente.\n¿Qué dice la exministra de Ambiente?\nPor su parte, la exministra de Ambiente, Susana Muhamad, salió en defensa de la iniciativa, asegurando que los proyectos en marcha no se verán afectados.\nEn entrevista con Noticias RCN, la exjefe de cartera, aclaró que no se va a frenar ningún proyecto y que se está exagerando lo que dice la resolución.\n¿Con quién está de acuerdo sobre la resolución del Gobierno frente a la planificación ambiental de Bogotá?\nClaudia López\nEs en la Región Metropolitana donde, por constitución y ley, debemos concertar los lineamientos territoriales y ambientales, no con imposiciones de resoluciones por sorpresa abusivas e inconstitucionales de su ministra de ambiente. Reflexión Presidente. Deje de obstruir a Bogotá y al país; deje de obstruir a los alcaldes. Asuma su papel como presidente de un estado social derecho y deje creerse el emperador de una monarquía presidencial.\nJuan Daniel Oviedo\nPor qué no el Gobierno Nacional, expone a consulta de todos los habitantes de La Sabana de Bogotá, ese tipo de decisiones, donde es claro que aquí en Colombia y en La Sabana de Bogotá, queremos desarrollo, sin tensiones y con acciones contundentes desde lo público para garantizar que la iniciativa privada y bienestar general se defiendan adecuadamente en nuestro país y en ese caso en La Sabana de Bogotá.\nMaría José Pizarro\nNosotros necesitamos reconstruir los corredores ambientales de la ciudad; acercar la Amazonía hacia precisamente los cerros; que no tengamos las inundaciones que vivimos porque llovía en La Sabana de occidente y no llovía en Chingaza. Que la compra y venta de agua en bloque no se dé de la manera tan desproporcionada que se está dando y se da porque hemos tenido un modelo expansivo en la ciudad por encima de los cuerpos de agua.\nMiguel Uribe\nLo que pretenden es que sin sustento técnico, extralimitándose en funciones, se creen humedales que no existen y se establezcan bosques que tampoco hay; en ese orden de ideas, vamos desde el centro de Democrático: primero: a pedir una intervención inmediata de la Procuraduría. Segundo: hacer los comentarios respectivos a la resolución, al proyecto y finalmente tendremos lista la acción de nulidad para demandar esta resolución -de ser aprobada por el ministerio- en con el Consejo nacional perdón con el Consejo de Estado.\nUnirse al canal de Whatsapp de Noticias RCN\nSíguenos en Google News",
