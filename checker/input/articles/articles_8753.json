    "text": "Mikel Arteta bemoans Arsenal’s display in both boxes after home loss to West Ham\nThe Gunners missed the chance to return to the top of the Premier League on Thursday night.\nMikel Arteta admitted his side came up short in both boxes as Arsenal slumped to defeat to West Ham to miss out on regaining top spot in the Premier League.\nThe Gunners remain behind Liverpool as they lost 2-0 at the Emirates Stadium on what Arteta conceded was one of the most frustrating nights of his four-year tenure as Arsenal boss.\nTomas Soucek’s opener – awarded after the VAR could not determine whether the whole ball had gone out of play in the build up – and a second-half header from former Arsenal defender Konstantinos Mavropanos earned the visitors a deserved win.\nThings could have been even better had Said Benrahma not had a stoppage-time penalty saved by David Raya on a night where Arteta applauded the performances of the opposition.\n“I congratulate West Ham and praise my players. That’s what I can tell you,” he said.\n“This is football. When you look at how much we generated in the game, to see the result is very disappointing. But they were better than us in both boxes. They had two shots, with the penalty three. We had 30.\nAsked if it was among the most frustrating nights of his managerial career, Arteta replied: “It is. But it’s football. Normally when the team generates so much it’s going to win games.\n“That’s the way we’ve done it. Against Brighton, we generated so much and against Liverpool as well, but we score goals in different ways.\n“We have to make another step in that area to win games more comfortably, that’s for sure, because today the team deserves to win the game. There’s no question about that.”\nArteta successfully fought a Football Association charge after he criticised the officiating and VAR in defeat at Newcastle last month and was less vocal this time.\nHe did, however, suggest technology needs to be further advanced to make close calls, adding: “They’re saying it’s not conclusive. It’s a shame that with the technology that we have, that it’s not that clear so that we can say whether it’s out or in. It’s done. It’s gone. There’s nothing we can do about it now.\nFor West Ham and manager David Moyes, this was a rare taste of victory at the Emirates Stadium – Moyes had failed to secure victory in his previous 72 Premier League away games at Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool or Manchester United.\nWest Ham were 17th at the turn of the year but went on to win the Europa Conference League and now sit just four points off the top four after this hard-fought and deserved win.\n“We’re getting ready to talk,” he told Amazon Prime.\n“I don’t think any of us are jumping to get it done too quickly, I think we are just happy to make sure we get it done. We will do, I don’t see any problems with that at all.\n“We are not one of the top teams. We are trying to get up and grow the team. For West Ham to be in Europe is a great period.”",

O estudo também destaca a importância das emissões ligadas a investimentos financeiros e afirma que focar-se nos fluxos financeiros e nas carteiras de indivíduos com rendimentos elevados pode gerar benefícios climáticos substanciais.\nOs autores acreditam que estas descobertas podem ajudar a lançar instrumentos de políticas progressistas dirigidas às elites sociais e realçam que fazer os poluidores ricos pagarem também pode fornecer o apoio muito necessário para a adaptação e perdas e danos em países vulneráveis.\nReequilibrar a responsabilidade pela ação climática de acordo com o contributo real para as emissões \"é essencial\", não só para conter o aquecimento global, \"mas também para alcançar um mundo mais justo e resiliente\" , concluem os autores.\nCom Lusa\nDestaques SIC Notícias Ver mais notícias Destaques",

    "text": "Red Sox reliever Liam Hendriks is ready to open his checkbook if the 2025 Red Sox end up winning a World Series this October.\nThe 36-year-old righty was candid when asked during NESN’s “Unobstructed Views” broadcast of the Bruins/Sabres game about what he plans to do if Boston wins another Fall Classic.\n“I’ve already got permission from my wife. If we [win] it, I’m doing the Jake Peavy thing. I’m buying the damn duck boat,” Hendriks told former Bruins Patrice Bergeron, Tuukka Rask, and Andrew Raycroft during Monday’s broadcast. “I don’t think it will fit in my parking spot in Beacon Hill, though.”\nLiam Hendriks has already planned for the Sox winning it all ⬇️\n\"If we do it, I'm doing the Jake Peavy thing, I'm buying the damn duck boat.\" 🤣 #NESNViews | 🤝 @CoorsBanquet pic.twitter.com/WkzLf3RX98\n— NESN (@NESN) March 18, 2025 Peavy — who won a World Series title as a veteran starter on Boston’s 2013 roster — infamously shelled out $75,000 to purchase his own amphibious vehicle as a keepsake from Boston’s improbable championship run.\nWhile Peavy acknowledged on MLB Network in January 2022 that the duck boat is now a “centerpiece” to a wiffle ball field in his hometown of Mobile, Alabama, the former Cy Young Award winner admitted that the initial reason why he purchased the vehicle was to accommodate his entire family ahead of Boston’s World Series parade.\nRemember when @JakePeavy_22 bought the duck boat his family rode on during the @RedSox 2013 World Series parade?\nHe still has it and there's an epic backstory 🦆 pic.twitter.com/K6eRjNQ3At\n— MLB Network (@MLBNetwork) January 21, 2022 “I had a bunch of kids already at the time, I had my wife’s brothers, and I got there that morning and … me and Jon Lester were there together and we had six tickets apiece,” Peavy said. “I said, ‘Look, I can’t wave to my grandparents on the side of this four-hour ride. They’ve got to get on the boat.'”\nHendriks, who is looking to earn a high-leverage spot in Boston’s bullpen while recovering from Tommy John surgery, could be a key reason why the Red Sox put themselves in the running for a deep playoff push this fall.\nWhile Hendriks has had an up-and-down spring training so far, the three-time All-Star does have 116 career saves on his resume and could complement a Red Sox bullpen that also features Justin Slaten and Aroldis Chapman.\n“We’ve got some arms who could be pretty special,” Hendriks told Peter Abraham of The Boston Globe of Boston’s bullpen in February. “It’s a good group and I’m excited to be out there with guys like Aroldis and Justin. I think we’ll be surprisingly good. We have good balance.”\nSign up for the Today newsletter Get everything you need to know to start your day, delivered right to your inbox every morning.\nSubmit your email Enter your email address\nSign up",

    "title": "Israel is retiring its Patriot missile batteries. They could help a struggling Ukraine.",
    "text": "US soldiers participate in Patriot missile training at Mount Eitam, Israel in 2018. Sgt. 1st Class Jason Epperson/US Army\nIsrael has never been impressed with the US-made Patriot air defense system. In 1991, it failed to intercept nearly all of the Iraqi Scud missiles fired at Israeli cities. Israel may not need the Patriots, but Ukraine is pleading for more. Israel has never been satisfied with its version of the Patriot air defense system that Ukraine views as essential to its survival.\nThis creates a bizarre split screen where Ukraine was all but pleading for more Patriot missiles to defend its cities and forces on Monday even as Israel began to shut down its older Patriot batteries, a move that came less than a month after it battled an unprecedented missile barrage from Iran.\nIsrael and Ukraine’s experience with the Patriots could not have been more different. Israel first used Patriots in combat in 1991 against approximately 40 Scud ballistic missiles that Iraq fired at its cities. While the bombardments did not kill large numbers of people, Israel was disappointed with the Patriot’s pitiful performance, with officials estimating it shot down only one or possibly even zero Scuds.\nIsrael wouldn’t use the Patriot in combat again until the 2010s when it shot down drones and a Su-24 bomber coming from Syria. By then, the Patriot had become a very different system. Its early failures, including against Iraqi Scuds, led to an extensive system upgrade and missiles with an active radar seeker that directly strike the target to destroy it with kinetic energy. These newer “hit-to-kill” missiles, the PAC-3, are estimated to cost around $4 million each. Their less sophisticated PAC-2 predecessor, on the other hand, are proximity-fusing missiles that explode near incoming missiles to eliminate them.\nSince receiving its Patriots, with both PAC-2 and PAC-3 interceptor missiles, in early 2023, Ukraine has successfully used them to shoot down Russia’s Kinzhal missile, which Russia touted as an unstoppable hypersonic weapon, and, early this year, moved at least one launcher near the front lines and shot down a dozen of Russia’s best fighter jets.\nThe Patriot is only part of Israel’s missile shield that’s been heavily tested by Iran and its proxies in the wake of Hamas’ Oct. 7 terror attacks. Israel has other options that are cheaper or built inside its country.\n“Israel has long been looking for a more advanced and more indigenous system to supplement or replace the Patriot, not only given its service history but also the supply chain that it requires,” Ryan Bohl, a senior Middle East and North Africa analyst at the risk intelligence company RANE, told Business Insider.\n“That this comes not long after Iran’s barrage of missiles against Israel isn’t a huge surprise with that ongoing trend,” Bohl said. “I think Israel views the Patriot as out of date and too expensive to keep up with given the breakthroughs that were demonstrated during that barrage by newer systems.”\nA Patriot air defense system test-fired during a training in Chania, Greece, on November 8, 2017. Anthony Sweeney/US Army\nFederico Borsari, a defense expert at the Center for European Policy Analysis, also believes Israel’s development of more advanced anti-missile systems weighed heavily on its decision to retire the Patriot.\n“Israel’s decision to retire its Patriot PAC-2 fire units is in line with the process of modernization and progressive enhancement of its air defense architecture with more advanced capabilities, in particular Iron Dome and David’s Sling,” Borsari told BI.\n“The latter’s Stunner missile, in particular, has a longer engagement range against aerodynamic threats (up to 300 km according to publicly available specifications) compared to the 160 km of the PAC-2’s GEM-T missiles,” Borsari said. “The two systems have a similar engagement range for ballistic threats, although David’s Slings maximum range capability is likely higher than the Patriot’s PAC-3 missiles.”\nThe CEPA analyst noted that David’s Sling truck-mounted ELM-2084 radar adds “maneuverability and rapid redeployment” advantages.\n“David’s Sling interceptors are also designed to counter saturation, multi-threat attacks like the recent one launched by Iran, thanks to their integration with the shorter-range Iron Dome,” Borsari said.\nBohl pointed out the David’s Sling is effective for intercepting “low-flying attacks and/or tracking enemy projectiles.”\nHe also noted that the Stunner missile is significantly cheaper and, therefore, more cost-effective than its Patriot counterpart.\nIsrael previously refused a US request for its vintage Hawk missiles, long in storage and out of service, for Ukraine.\nAnalysts believe that might not necessarily be the case with the Patriots.\n“I think it remains entirely possible that Israel countenances a potential transfer of these Patriots back to the United States and hence on to Ukraine from there,” Bohl said. “Certainly, from the Israeli perspective, they would consider this fair play, as Russia’s war in Ukraine has helped to dry up the much-needed 155 mm ammunition that Israel itself has required.”\nIf the Patriots don’t ultimately end up in Ukraine, it’s not inconceivable they could be transferred to a regional country. Jordan requested the US deploy a Patriot missile on its soil in October and helped intercept the Iranian barrage on April 13.\n“Transferring these Patriots to other third-party countries like Jordan or even Gulf Arab allies like the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, or even Saudi Arabia, I think is also in the cards as the United States looks to bolster air defenses region-wide,” Bohl said.\nBorsari argues it is crucial for the US and the European countries to acquire the Israeli PAC-2 batteries for Ukraine.\n“While not sufficient to cover the entire front, they would significantly enhance Ukraine’s air defense as Russia increases its terrorist attacks against Ukrainian cities,” Borsari said. “While Israel has so far resisted calls to provide Ukraine with military support, pressure from the US and others could allow for this transfer.”\n“Handing over to Jordan is also possible, although, given the circumstances, Western countries would and should prioritize Ukraine.”\nIf you enjoyed this story, be sure to follow Business Insider on Microsoft Start.",
