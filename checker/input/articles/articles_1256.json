    "text": "- Your paycheck could be slightly bigger in 2024 due to federal income tax bracket adjustments, experts say.\n- However, you should still review your federal and state withholdings throughout the year to avoid a surprise tax bill.\nAs the new year kicks off, some workers could see a slightly bigger paycheck due to\ntax bracket changes from the IRS.\nThe IRS in November unveiled the\nfederal income tax brackets for 2024, with earnings thresholds for each tier adjusting by about 5.4% higher for inflation.\nWhile it's lower than the\ntax bracket changes for 2023, \"it's still a pretty handsome increase,\" said certified financial planner Roger Stinnett, managing director of wealth planning for First Foundation Advisors in Irvine, California.\nMore from Personal Finance:\nHigh earners have a little-known option to turbocharge 401(k) savings State-run 'auto-IRA' programs aim to close retirement savings gap New change to 529 college savings plans has 'so many caveats,' advisor says\nIf your wages are\nsimilar to last year, the 2024 tax bracket adjustment could result in a small paycheck increase, depending on your withholding, experts say.\nOf course, prolonged higher costs can chip away at tax savings.\nMoney Report\nAnnual inflation\ndeclined slightly in November, but many Americans are still feeling the pinch of elevated prices for housing, motor vehicle insurance and other day-to-day expenses.\nKeep a 'running total' of your income\n\"You always want to keep a running total in your mind of how your income is changing, because it's complex,\" said Stinnett, who is also a certified public accountant.\nThe federal income tax brackets show how much you owe on each portion of your \"taxable income,\" which is calculated by subtracting the greater of the standard or itemized deductions from your adjusted gross income.\nFor 2024, the standard deduction also increased for inflation, rising to $14,600 for single filers, up from $13,850 in 2023. Married couples filing jointly may claim $29,200, up from $27,700. That change could reduce taxable income for some filers.\nCheck your paycheck withholding\nYour federal and state paycheck withholdings affect how much taxes you pay throughout the year. You can expect a refund when you've overpaid or a tax bill when you haven't paid enough.\nEven if your paycheck increased in 2024, \"new tax changes could still place you in a lower or higher bracket,\" warned CFP Ashton Lawrence, director at Mariner Wealth Advisors in Greenville, South Carolina.\nIt's important to keep track of tax law and life changes that may affect your situation and adjust your paycheck withholding via\nForm W-4 with your employer as needed, he said.\nLife changes that can affect your taxes may include marriage, divorce, the birth or adoption of a child, retirement, buying a home, filing for bankruptcy and more,\naccording to the IRS.\nOne \"quick check\" could be last year's tax return, Stinnett said. If you had a large refund or owed a sizable balance, that may signal it's time to review your withholding.\nDon't miss these stories from CNBC PRO:\nThese stocks will be the biggest S&P 500 winners of 2024, according to analysts Here's where to invest $50,000 in the new year, according to the pros Could a bitcoin ETF approval be a sell-the-news event?

    "text": "Fox Sports college football analyst Joel Klatt is on the [Texas Longhorns](https://www.burntorangenation.com) train. During a talking-head conversation earlier this week, Klatt gushed over Texas’ offense. In particular, Texas’ speed a wide receiver. Altogether, Klatt implies Texas is the real deal this season. “Texas looks like Alabama has looked and Georgia has looked,” Klatt explained, per [On3](https://www.on3.com/news/joel-klatt-believes-texas-longhorns-speed-will-cause-michigan-wolverines-problems/). “That’s what Sark is building. He left Alabama and he left the Nick Saban tree. That’s what he’s building from a roster. What I like about Sark has done is that he didn’t go try to copy Nick Saban from a personality standpoint or philosophy but he did look at that roster at Alabama and say, ‘Oh, yeah, that’s how you win. That’s how you win’. This looks like an early-2000s USC team. It looks like the Alabama teams and the Georgia teams.” WHAT THEY’RE SAYING ABOUT THE LONGHORNS [Austin American-Statesman](https://subscribe.statesman.com/restricted?return=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.statesman.com%2Fstory%2Fsports%2Fcolumns%2F2024%2F09%2F05%2Fgolden-longhorn-dusty-mangums-rose-bowl-kick-lives-on-20-years-later%2F75043194007%2F&gps-source=CPROADBLOCKDH&gca-cat=p&gca-uir=true&gca-epti=z119977p119977c119977u115150e002908v004150&sltsgmt=1001_B_20&gnt-eid=control): Golden: Longhorn ex Mangum revisits [Rose Bowl](http://www.sbnation.com/rose-bowl) kick that beat Michigan [Dallas Morning News](https://www.dallasnews.com/sports/texas-longhorns/2024/09/05/college-football-week-2-predictions-picks-for-20-games-including-texas-michigan-byu-smu/): College football Week 2 predictions: Picks for 20 games, including Texas-Michigan, [BYU](https://www.vanquishthefoe.com)-SMU [Dallas Morning News](https://www.dallasnews.com/sports/texas-longhorns/2024/09/04/qa-with-fs1s-emmanuel-acho-texas-michigan-12-team-cfp-and-why-sports-need-less-debate/): Q&A with FS1′s Emmanuel Acho: Texas-Michigan, 12-team CFP and why sports need less debate [247Sports](https://247sports.com/college/texas/longformarticle/the-insider-texas-longhorns-football-nuggets-galore-ahead-of-michigan-game-235684093/): The Insider: Nuggets galore ahead of Texas hitting the road to take on Michigan [247Sports](https://247sports.com/college/texas/longformarticle/horns247-staff-predictions-no-3-texas-longhorns-no-10-michigan-wolverines-235688110/): Horns247 Staff Predictions: No. 3 Texas vs. No. 10 Michigan [247Sports](https://247sports.com/college/texas/article/former-texas-great-jermichael-finley-says-rose-bowl-between-texas-michigan-influenced-college-decision--235687894/): Former Texas great Jermichael Finley says Rose Bowl between Texas, Michigan influenced college decision [247Sports](https://247sports.com/college/texas/article/expanded-texas-wr-rotation-a-really-comforting-thing-for-steve-sarkisian-longhorns-after-productive-opener-235676187/): Expanded Texas WR rotation ‘a really comforting thing’ for Steve Sarkisian, Longhorns after productive opener [247Sports](https://247sports.com/college/texas/article/grading-the-longhorns-can-the-texas-defenses-shutout-performance-carry-over-to-the-michigan-game-235675136/): Grading the Longhorns: Can the Texas defense’s shutout performance carry over to the Michigan game?

    "text": "The flight to Manchester was diverted to Zagreb Airport where a paramedic was on hand\nDon't Miss\nMost Read\nTrending on GB News\nEasyJet passengers were left stranded for hours at Zagreb Airport after their flight from Egypt to Manchester was forced to make an emergency landing when a cabin crew member fell ill.\nLouise Mapsie was returning from a five-day stay at an Egyptian resort when the pilot called for urgent medical assistance during the flight.\nThe incident, which occurred in the early hours of Friday morning, saw the flight diverted to Croatia where paramedics were waiting to transport the unwell staff member to hospital.\nPassengers were initially told they would receive temporary accommodation while a replacement flight was arranged, but were later left to wait in the closed airport.\nThe flight was stranded at Zagreb Airport\nWikiCommons/Getty\n\"As soon as we got off the plane that was it,\" Mapsie told the Manchester Evening News. \"The crew stayed on the plane, we got into the airport to realise that it was closed.\"\nShe explained that only two security guards were present, apparently called in specifically for the emergency landing situation.\nThe passengers were left to rely on updates through the easyJet app, which proved problematic for elderly travellers who didn't have access to it.\n\"An hour later we got a text from easyJet saying they aren't going to give us accommodation and they would let us know when the next available flight is,\" Mapsie said.\nLATEST DEVELOPMENTS\nA cabin crew member fell ill on board the easyJet flight\nPAAccording to the 22-year-old passenger, while the cabin crew were taken to a five-star hotel in the city, travellers were left at the airport for over 10 hours in freezing conditions.\nShe said: \"The crew got in their taxi and left, and we just had to sit there. There was nothing open, nowhere to get a drink, babies had gone for almost 20 hours with no milk.\n\"We were terrified. Landing in a country that most of us had never heard of was scary enough.\"\nShe described how passengers were forced to sleep on the floor and benches, with no facilities available.\n\"Every five minutes felt like an hour when you were sitting there shivering. At one point we didn't know if anybody was coming to get us.\"\nThe flight, which originally departed from Hurghada Airport eventually transported passengers back to Manchester around 2pm on Friday.\nMapsie claimed there was no aftercare on the return flight, with passengers being asked to purchase drinks and snacks.\nA spokesperson for easyJet said: \"The safety and wellbeing of our customers and crew is easyJet's highest priority.\n\"Our crew were provided with hotel accommodation to comply with regulations and we secured hotel rooms for customers where available.\n\"Unfortunately, due to limited hotel availability, some customers remained in the airport overnight and so we endeavoured to make them as comfortable as possible by providing refreshments.\"\nThe airline apologised for the difficulties caused, while noting the circumstances were outside their control.",

Children with a baseline SER of less than –3 D benefited more. Naked-eye 3-dimensional vision training was safe and controlled progression of axial length and spherical equivalent refraction in children with myopia, according to a study conducted in China and published in JAMA Pediatrics .\n“To prevent the occurrence and progression of myopia in children, many myopia intervention methods have been developed, including orthokeratology, soft contact lenses and low-concentration atropine eye drops,” Rui Xie, MM, of Sun Yat-sen University in China, and colleagues wrote. “For interventions used in children and adolescents, safety is a key concern for clinicians and parents.”\nResearchers found that naked-eye 3-D vision training was safe and effective for myopia control in children. Image: Adobe Stock In a randomized clinical trial conducted at three hospitals in southern China, researchers assessed the safety and efficacy of naked-eye 3-D vision training (NVT) among 263 children aged 6 to 18 years (47.5% boys; mean age, 10.3 years) with a myopia diagnosis and spherical equivalent refraction (SER) of –0.75 D to –6 D.\nParticipants were divided into an intervention group, who underwent 20 minutes of varied intensity NVT treatment daily, and a control group, who did not receive NVT. There were 12 levels of NVT, and each level included 10 sessions for a total of 120 lessons.\nParticipants were assessed at 1, 3 and 6 months for myopia progression and adverse reactions. The primary outcome was change from baseline in axial length at 6 months, while secondary outcomes were binocular visual function and SER.\nAccording to results, 227 children completed the 6-month follow-up, with 102 in the intervention group and 125 in the control group.\nAt 6 months, axial length changed by 0.18 mm in the intervention group and 0.23 mm in the control group — a significant difference of –0.06 mm ( P < .001). In addition, SER changed by –0.25 D and –0.35 D, respectively, also a significant difference (0.10 D; P = .02).\nSubgroup analysis showed the effect of myopia control was similar between different age groups and sexes; however, children with a baseline SER of less than –3 D benefited more compared with children with a baseline of at least –3 D ( P = .04).\nResearchers reported no adverse reactions during the study. Of the 29 children who discontinued intervention, 22 were unable to follow up because of COVID-19 or other reasons, and seven switched to another treatment.\n“Our findings provide solid evidence for NVT as an effective and safe intervention for preventing myopia progression,” Xie and colleagues wrote.",

    "text": "SC: macaco conhecido como 'Chico' invade mercado, bebe cerveja e provoca 'caos' antes de ser capturado Equipe responsável pela captura afirma que o macaco invadiu o estabelecimento duas vezes antes de ser apreendido Um macaco provocou o 'caos' ao invadir duas vezes, no mesmo fim de semana, um supermercado em São Francisco do Sul (SC). O Grupo de Operações e Resgate (GOR) do município afirmou que o animal chegou a comer pinhão, beber cerveja e pegou uma lâmina de barbear antes de ser capturado pela equipe. - Receba as principais notícias direto no WhatsApp! [Inscreva-se no canal do Terra] O GOR explica que o macaco, batizado de Chico, é um macho da espécie [macaco-prego-preto](https://www.terra.com.br/planeta/). Ele tem registro e pertence a um tutor que mora próximo ao estabelecimento, no bairro [Rocio Grande](https://www.terra.com.br/noticias/brasil/cidades/), mas estava com a vacina antirrábica atrasada. Ao Terra, o grupamento explicou que a primeira 'invasão' aconteceu na tarde de sábado, 20, quando a equipe foi acionada para retirar o macaco. Chico já tinha consumido pinhão, aberto sacos de leite em pó, potes de massa de tomate, além de latas de cerveja. O tutor do macaco também estava no mercado e esclareceu que Chico tem registro no Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e dos Recursos Naturais Renováveis (Ibama) e é microchipado. A Polícia Militar, então registrou um Termo Circunstanciado por omissão de cautela na guarda do animal, apontou o GOR. A equipe não conseguiu capturar Chico, que estava assustado, e o macaco voltou para casa na noite de sábado. No entanto, voltou ao estabelecimento na manhã de domingo, 21, e o GOR foi acionado novamente, desta vez capturando o animal. Chico foi enviado ao Centro de Triagem de Animais Silvestres em Florianópolis. O tutor, segundo o GOR, precisa aguardar por processo e decisão judicial que vai definir a guarda do macaco.",

A man who died after being hit by a tractor trailer in South Portland on Thursday morning was trying to end his life, according to South Portland police. The crash was reported at 8:01 a.m. near the Budget Inn at 634 Main St. A witness told police that a tractor-trailer truck had struck the pedestrian. The 60-year-old man was found to have significant injuries. He was brought to a hospital where he later died, police said. Investigators learned that the man had recently rented a room at the Budget Inn. After conducting interviews, reviewing video footage, reviewing the man’s personal history, and finding a note left in his room, they determined the man had intentionally stepped into the path of the truck. The man’s name is being withheld until his family is notified. Police said they found the tractor-trailer driver, who cooperated with investigators. They determined the driver had done nothing wrong and said no charges will be filed. Main Street [was temporarily closed](https://www.bangordailynews.com/2024/01/25/portland/portland-police-courts/south-portland-main-street-crash/) during the investigation on Thursday.",

    "title": "La faible participation électorale apportera le chaos en Iran prévient Khamenei",
    "text": "À l’occasion du 45e anniversaire de la dictature religieuse iranienne, Ali Khamenei, le guide suprême qui a maintenu le pouvoir tout au long d’un règne de 34 ans marqué par la terreur et l’effusion de sang, a exprimé son inquiétude quant à la montée potentielle de la “dictature”. Le 23 décembre, Khamenei a déclaré : “Certains critiquent la tenue des élections, provoquant de la frustration. Ils ne réalisent pas que sans élections, le pays serait confronté soit à la dictature, soit au chaos, aux troubles et à l’insécurité.” Lors d’une réunion avec un groupe du Khouzestan et de Kerman, selon le site Internet de Khamenei, il a souligné : « Les termes République et islamique reposent tous deux sur les élections. Une république implique un gouvernement par le peuple, où la gouvernance est entre les mains du peuple par le biais d’élections. Décourager la participation aux élections est préjudiciable au pays. La solution aux problèmes du pays réside dans le processus électoral démocratique.» Pourtant, les observateurs de Iran ont remarqué que Khamenei se préparait depuis des mois à une vaste purge du Parlement. Le Majlis, rigoureusement contrôlé il y a quatre ans par le Conseil des gardiens, a récemment entravé l’approbation de projets de loi favorisés par le guide suprême et le gouvernement Raïssi. Début novembre, une entité liée au ministère de l’Intérieur a disqualifié de nombreux candidats parlementaires, dont des dizaines de députés sortants, les empêchant ainsi de participer à la prochaine farce electoral parlementaire. Des avertissements contre un boycott à l’échelle nationale ont été émis par de nombreux responsables des gouvernements, le parlement et même les factions rivales. Ce sentiment est repris par des segments considérables de la société, révélant une désillusion croissante et une baisse de la participation au cours des dernières années. Ali Rabi’i, ancien ministre du Travail, porte-parole du gouvernement de Hassan Rohani et ancien adjoint du ministère du Renseignement, a prévenu : « Contrairement aux périodes passées, à l’approche des élections, le niveau de participation diminue ». Rabi’l a ajouté : « Le rapport de l’enquête ISPA indique que 27,9 % de la population a déclaré qu’elle participerait certainement aux élections. 7,4% sont susceptibles d’y participer. 21,9% n’ont pas encore décidé de leur participation. 36% ont déclaré qu’ils ne participeraient d’aucune manière à ces élections. De plus, 6,8% ont exprimé une faible probabilité de participer à ces élections. En cumulant ceux qui ont définitivement exprimé leur intention de participer avec la moitié de ceux susceptibles de participer, on arrive à un chiffre approximatif de 32%, ce qui est un chiffre plus précis.» D’un autre côté, les médias alignés sur le gouvernement Raïssi déploient des efforts concertés, en utilisant des publicités et en présentant des personnalités auparavant marginalisées, pour attirer les soi-disant électeurs et augmenter la participation. Simultanément, à mesure que la date des élections approche, de nombreuses nouvelles concernant les conflits entre les dirigeants des trois branches ainsi que leurs associés au Parlement actuel gagnent en importance dans les médias contrôlés par l’État. Les prochaines élections législatives, prévues pour le 1er mars 2024, visent à choisir les représentants pour le douzième mandat du parlement du régime, composé de 290 représentants pour un mandat de quatre ans. Cela coïncidera avec les élections simulées pour le sixième mandat de « l’Assemblée des experts en leadership ». En raison de l’âge et de l’état de santé d’Ali Khamenei, de nombreuses spéculations circulent selon lesquelles la prochaine Assemblée d’experts jouera un rôle central dans la détermination du futur Guide suprême et, par conséquent, du sort du régime. Les annonces officielles des institutions de l’État, souvent critiquées pour leur manque de transparence et d’exactitude dans leurs rapports, ont indiqué un taux de participation de « 42,57 % » lors des précédentes élections législatives du 18 juin 2021. Ce taux de participation était l’un des plus faibles enregistrés des quatre dernières décennies. Ces dernières années, Khamenei a poursuivi une stratégie de consolidation du pouvoir en purgeant de nombreux membres des factions rivales, voire d’anciens alliés. Cela a conduit à une base de soutien diminuée et plus précaire pour son leadership. Par conséquent, le Guide suprême et ses alliés craignent que, compte tenu des sentiments révolutionnaires au sein de la société iranienne, ils soient confrontés à des difficultés pour rallier des soutiens et réprimer la dissidence. Divers partis et groupes alignés sur les anciens présidents Mohammad Khatami et Hassan Rohani ont déclaré leur décision de ne pas présenter de candidats. Pourtant, malgré les menaces de la faction au pouvoir de l’exclure, Hassan Rohani a annoncé sa candidature aux élections de l’Assemblée des experts. Soulignant que sa mise à l’écart pourrait entraîner de pires conséquences pour le régime, Rohani a déclaré lors d’un rassemblement de religieux le 23 décembre : « Parfois, ne pas voter aux élections est une forme de vote ». Au cours du soulèvement de 2022, qui s’est étalé sur plusieurs mois et a été témoin de manifestations généralisées dans tout l’Iran appelant au renversement de la dictature des mollahs, Khamenei s’est adressé publiquement à la nation plus de cinq fois en quelques semaines. Il a lancé un appel au soutien des responsables actuels et anciens de son gouvernement. Cependant, cette décision sans précédent a été largement ignorée par les plus hautes autorités. Alors que Khamenei appelle à une forte participation électorale tout en se positionnant pour de nouvelles purges dans son régime dans la poursuite de ce qu’il perçoit comme un règne plus loyal et plus fort, ce n’est qu’une question de temps avant que le prochain soulèvement ne lui prouve le contraire.",
