(Photo: Warren Little/Getty Images)\nAUGUSTA, Ga. – The Mad Scientist is at it again.\nBryson DeChambeau, who opened with a 7-under 65 in the first round of the Masters at Augusta National Golf Club, is playing with a custom set of single-length irons made by little-known clubmaker Avoda that are made by 3-D printing and weren’t approved by the USGA until Monday. With no hesitation, DeChambeau inserted them in the bag at the Masters.\nAvoda is a Hebrew word with multiple meanings, one of which is precision. According to Avoda’s website, the company makes two different types of irons, one-length irons like the clubs DeChambeau played when he was sponsored by Cobra, and combo-length irons.\n“The faces have some bolts to them, they are one-of-a-kind,” said Schy, who described them as onset. “What happens if you hit it on the toe? It hooks a lot, right? What happens if you hit it on the heel? It cuts a lot. When you have bolts, that offsets that.”\n“It’s been an adventure,” Schy added.\nThat adventure began in November when Schy took a couple of forged clubs and inserted bolts from the center to the toe. DeChambeau hit them and liked them immediately. The question became: How to produce them?\nBryson DeChambeau walks onto the No. 2 green during a practice round for the 2024 Masters Tournament at Augusta National Golf Club. (Photo: Adam Cairns-USA TODAY Sports)\nDeChambeau parted ways with Cobra-Puma Golf last year. He has worked with other clubmakers and has found limited options to build him clubs to his specific needs and wants.\n“Those ships have sailed,” he said of the major OEM’s. “I told Bryson eventually you’re going to have to do these things by yourself. You have the money to do it now.”\nThe irons are made by one of Schy’s students, Tom Bailey, owner of Avoda irons, who set out to sell a few hundred sets of irons a year to help pay for his golf habit.\n“He’s crazy like us,” said Schy, who noted that DeChambeau isn’t an investor in the company.\nBut DeChambeau mapped out exactly what he wanted the irons to be. Bailey’s brother created a CAD file, and they found a supplier in China, who took one look at the irons and declared, “It can’t be done,” Schy said. “I said, ‘Welcome to Bryson’s world.’ ”\nThey tried to do a CNC version initially but based on DeChambeau’s demands, it needed to be a two-piece club and the only way to produce it quickly was via 3-D printing. The irons failed to pass muster with the USGA as recently as last week. The grooves were too narrow because of the way a 3-D printer prints in layers. Connor Olson, manager of DeChambeau’s company BAD, buffed and grinded the grooves until they were deemed conforming. The USGA signed off on Monday and DeChambeau decided to put them in play at the biggest tournament of the year.\n“We wouldn’t have it any other way,” Schy said.\nBryson DeChambeau checks a club before a practice round for the 2024 Masters at Augusta National Golf Club. (Photo: Rob Schumacher-USA TODAY Sports)\nAccording to the Avoda website, the one-length irons are being released in May and are available for pre-order, but the company does not say on its website how long the clubs are. For Cobra, one-length irons are 7-iron-length (37.25 inches).\nSchy was in Dallas with DeChambeau two weeks ago and said, “I’ve never seen him hit it so good.”\nDeChambeau was asked about his equipment changes during his post-round press conference and confirmed that he had changed irons, but remained coy about the details.\n“I put new irons in this week. I think that’s a pretty big change. And been using this new driver, 3-wood and 5-wood,” he said. “So pretty much my whole bag is different since Greenbrier of last year, and putter is the only thing that’s remained the same.”\nThis article originally appeared on Golfweek: Bryson DeChambeau leading Masters using 3-D printed irons only approved by USGA on Monday",

    "title": "How UK fought the country's first fascist groups who were pals with Adolf Hitler - Mirror Online",
    "text": "The attacks against Jews in London, Manchester and Leeds were constant, violent and terrifying.\nGangs paraded in London’ s East End, targeting and abusing Jewish residents, particularly older Orthodox Jews. They could not go down some streets without risking of being set upon by fascists. It is 100 years since the founding of the UK’s first fascist organisation, British Fascisti. Like European far-right parties, it hid behind the national flag, exploited economic discontent and enlisted jackbooted thugs.\nThe arrival of fascism demanded a response. This came October 7, 1923, when the British Fascisti first rally was disrupted by Communist Party members. The next year the People’s Defence Force was set up in London to resist moves to create a fascist party in Britain in the style of Italian dictator Benito Mussolini. The battle against the hatred, abuse and violence pushed by the far-right had started. A fight against racism that has not ceased. It has meant taking on Oswald Mosley’s British Union of Fascists, the National Front and the British National Party. The battleground has been the streets of Dagenham, Bradford, Liverpool and Glasgow; council chambers and football terraces.\nAt every turn it has involved good people standing up to bad. No sooner had British Fascisti been seen off than a new threat emerged: Mosley’s Blackshirts. Mosley had met Adolf Hitler and Mussolini and was determined to import their warped nationalist dogma into Britain.\nIn June 1934, 1,000 demonstrators outside London’s Olympia protesting against a BUF mass rally were attacked by the party’s stewards. This was a precursor to the 1936 Battle of Cable Street in London’s East End.\nMosley targeted the area because of its large Jewish population. When the Government refused to ban the march by his Blackshirts the local community took matters into their own hands.\nDockers joined forces with the recently formed Jewish People’s Council against Fascism and Antisemitism and built a barricade in the narrow London street. Lou Kenton, whose Jewish Ukrainian family fled Russian persecution for London, recalled the scenes.\nIn a recording for the British Library, he said: “There was real bitter fighting and the police were entirely on the side of the fascists.\n“Cable Street went from being a gallant band holding the fort to a majority. I’ve never seen such a happy crowd.” Mosley was interned as a Nazi sympathiser at the beginning of the Second World War but was released in 1943 and continued to preach his vile propaganda.\nIn response, a small band of Jewish ex-servicemen started 43 Group – an underground organisation aiming to wipe out Mosleyites.\nAmong its earliest members was a 17-year-old hairdresser called Vidal Sassoon. Years later Sassoon recalled his life as a street fighter. We “did not intend to allow the fascists ever again to rule the streets of London,” he wrote.\n“And so it began. We had turned the other cheek for the last time and, as a 17-year-old recruit, I was proud to be involved.”\nThe far-right soon had a second target: the Windrush generation. In 1958 a group of armed white men sparked riots in Notting Hill by driving around West London and attacking West Indian people.\nViolent clashes between anti-racist protesters and the newly formed National Front continued through the 60s and 70s. By 1979 NF was the fourth largest party in Britain, with 303 candidates in that year’s general election .\nTwo years earlier the Anti-Nazi League was started to counter the growing influence of the far-right. The late 70s also saw the birth of Rock Against Racism which staged two huge “carnivals” in 1978 with tens of thousands of people gathering to hear performances by Aswad, The Clash, Elvis Costello, Tom Robinson and Stiff Little Fingers.\nBy the 80s the NF had been superseded by the BNP and its thuggish offshoot, Combat 18.\nAs the BNP started to get a toehold in local councils, anti-fascist campaigners again had to respond. In 2004 the anti-fascist research organisation Searchlight was reborn as Hope Not Hate, which worked with local communities to counter the BNP’s message of division and hatred.\nHope Not Hate’s Nick Lowles said: “We treated all voters – including BNP voters – with respect, understood that many had real or perceived grievances that needed addressing and localised our campaigning.”\nIts work helped defeat the BNP in Barking and Dagenham amid fears the far-right party was poised to take over the East London council in 2010. In 2008 the Mirror joined forces with Hope Not Hate to organise a nationwide bus tour to show Britain’s prevailing spirit of tolerance. A week after the 2001 Oldham Riots, the group stopped the far-right’s plan to invade Old Trafford cricket pitch and fight Pakistan fans. And Lowles praised campaigners such as “Arthur” who risked his life by going undercover for 11 years.\nArthur identified neo-Nazi nail bomber David Copeland, jailed for life for his 1999 attacks against London’s Black, Bangladeshi and gay communities which claimed three lives. Lowles’ priority now is “to galvanise the younger generation” because the impact of climate change, Britain’s declining role in the world, the attacks on democracy and freedoms are “fertile ground” for the far-right.\nHe said: “We’re seeing governments in Europe taken over by the far-right, the possible return of Donald Trump and in the UK we are seeing on the streets an increasingly strong far-right that pose a threat.\nHe added: “We look to the past for inspiration but we have to mobilise to face the challenges of the future.”",

    "title": "Why Is There No Mid-Gen Xbox Series Upgrade? Because MS Won’t Make “Incremental Hardware” That Only Benefits Them",
    "text": "Microsoft Gaming head Phil Spencer doesn’t mince words about how he feels about mid-generation console upgrades.\nIn the eight generation of consoles, both Microsoft and Sony offered upgrades to their consoles in the middle of the lifetime of their consoles. Microsoft announced the Xbox One X first in E3 2016, followed by Sony’s announcement of the PlayStation 4 Pro that September. The PlayStation 4 Pro would then be released in November, while the Xbox One X came out in November 2017, a full year later.\nAs any gamer who had consoles at the time will tell you, both Xbox and PlayStation owners definitely felt the difference when they got both mid-generation upgrades. While both promised that the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One could output to 4K at launch, few developers were actually making games that lived up to that promise.\nThe Xbox One X and PlayStation 4 Pro made enough upgrades to make that possible, and they also fed an appetite for consumers to upgrade their screens to be 4K capable. It’s also noteworthy that the Xbox One X had a real CPU upgrade, from the bespoke Jaguar APU on the Xbox One clocked at 1.75 GHz, to a new Scorpio Engine SOC clocked at 2.3 GHz.\nBecause of that very real upgrade, multiple press outlets, and the fans themselves, attested that the Xbox One X was definitely the more powerful console of the two. It wasn’t enough for Xbox to make real headway against Sony, but their loyal Xbox fans experienced that benefit anyway.\nThings are much more different now. Both the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series are capable of running games at 4K just fine. On the flip side, while the gaming discourse revolves around now standardizing 60 FPS, Sony has delivered in the PlayStation 5 Pro a console that can improve performance for all games that make use of their hardware, they don’t live up to that demand for 60 FPS across the board.\nIn a new interview with Rolling Stone, Spencer was asked about doing another upgrade in light of the PlayStation 5 pro’s recent release. Here’s what Spencer had to say:\n“We think about hardware that can create unique value for our players or creators on our platform. We don’t need to do incremental hardware for our own benefit.\nDoes a new device really give you a unique experience on screen in some way? [It’s] less like the old days, going from the original Xbox to 360; that was standard definition to high definition. Now, [it’s] harder to show the benefits.”\nSince Microsoft’s decision to upgrade the Xbox One led to choosing a more powerful CPU, if Spencer did greenlight making an upgrade to the Xbox Series line, he would likely have commissioned yet another upgraded CPU, which is more than what Sony is willing to do.\nSo there could be an alternate world out there where we did get an Xbox Series XX, or whatever Microsoft would have decided to call it. But that much more powerful Xbox, that would have also probably outperformed the PlayStation 5 Pro we have now, would have also been priced at $ 700, or even higher.\nAnd as Spencer argues, would their consumers feel any benefit if they did go ahead with that? Microsoft did make upgraded versions of their consoles, like the Xbox Series X Galaxy Black Edition. But the improvements in the hardware in these consoles were more towards making their components smaller. These improvements may make the newer Xboxes cheaper to make and last longer, but they won’t necessarily run that much better.\nThese new Xboxes are not being sold as an upgrade to the Xboxes that their fans have now, that would require them to spend over $ 1000 in this console generation. A setup like that would have benefited Microsoft more than their customers, so it’s important to recognize that Spencer and Xbox chose not to do that.\nAs for Sony users? They should know well by now what they are buying into, if they are double dipping for this generation. Not every Sony fan is afforded that privilege, but the consumer behavior Sony sees from this may lead to choices all their fans won’t be enjoying in the future.",

Es la primera derrota como locales en esta temporada , en la que se estaban haciendo muy fuertes en el Emirates .\nHonores al equipo de David Moyes , que defendió con uñas y dientes en un ejercicio de solidaridad y compromiso con una idea . Soucek y Mavropanos, pusieron los goles en un partido en el que Areola se hizo gigante . Los visitantes se hacen así con la sexta posición (33 puntos) mientras que el Arsenal se queda a dos del líder, el Liverpool ( 42 puntos).\nEl muro de West Ham El arranque del Arsenal fue prometedor . Embotellando al rival y circulando con peligro ante un West Ham muy replegado . Pero el fútbol es maravilloso por su imprevisibilidad . Minuto 13 y gol de Soucek para adelantar a los visitantes. En una jugada revisada por el VAR por si había salido o no el balón por línea de fondo . 0-1 en el Emirates con una eternidad por jugarse.\nEl equipo de Arteta dejó de sentirse tan cómodo como al inicio ante un West Ham muy bien plantado . Alternaba posesiones largas con alguna jugada a balón parado, pero sin éxito alguno. Apareció Areola , con un par de paradas de mérito , para sostener a los de David Moyes , sin Paquetá desde el 31 ' por lesión . Saka mandó el balón al palo en la más clara del Arsenal en la primera mitad. El muro del West Ham era real.\nUn quiero y no puedo El inicio de la segunda fue esperanzador para el Arsenal. Arteta les quería a todos enchufados y sus jugadores no escatimaron en intensidad . Para romper semejante defensa había que meter la sexta marcha. Sin embargo, un ex del Arsenal asestó un duro golpe a los gunners en el minuto 55 '. Testarazo tremendo de Mavropanos tras un córner, directo a la escuadra de Raya para poner el 0-2.\nMavropanos anota el 0-2 Areola se iba haciendo grande a medida que la defensa del West Ham se iba estrechando . Además, los visitantes empezaban a gozar de más tiempo y espacio al contragolpe . Gabriel Jesús perdonó lo imperdonable cuando más falta hacía y los minutos pasaban. El Arsenal rozó los 30 disparos en el Emirates , pero el guardameta del West Ham se vistió de Benji para desesperar a los de Arteta . Raya paró un penalti en el último minuto para evitar la goleada . Una dura derrota que deja sin liderato al Arsenal en este Boxing Day .",
