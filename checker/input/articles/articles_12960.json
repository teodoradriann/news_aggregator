    "title": "Country singer, satirist and novelist Kinky Friedman dies aged 79",
    "text": "Kinky Friedman, the satirical and often provocative musician, author and one-time politician, has died at the age of 79. “Kinky Friedman stepped on a rainbow at his beloved Echo Hill surrounded by family and friends,” read a post on his social media. “Kinkster endured tremendous pain and unthinkable loss in recent years but he never lost his fighting spirit and quick wit. Kinky will live on as his books are read and his songs are sung.” Know the news with the 7NEWS app: [Download today ](https://7news.com.au/app?utm_source=7NEWS&utm_medium=contextual-link-app&utm_campaign=7news-app) Throughout his career, Richard Samet “Kinky” Friedman developed a cult following for his unique, quirky approach to country and Western music. The self-proclaimed “governor of the heart of Texas” released a robust number of albums starting with 1973’s Sold American, often considered his foundational record, and in addition to touring with Bob Dylan on his Rolling Thunder Revue, he became the “first full-blooded Jew” to appear at the Grand Ole Opry. Outside of his music career, Friedman was a prolific writer, penning detective novels and serving as a columnist for Texas Monthly. He dabbled in politics, running for Governor of Texas in 2006 with campaign slogans such as “My Governor is a Jewish Cowboy”. In the end, he received 12.6 per cent of the votes among six candidates. Born in Chicago, Friedman grew up in Texas and attended the University of Texas at Austin to study psychology. An interest in music led him to form King Arthur and the Carrots followed by Kinky Friedman and the Texas Jewboys, which he described as a “country band with a social conscience, a demented love child of Lenny Bruce and Bob Wills”. The group stirred controversy with songs like They Ain’t Makin’ Jews Like Jesus Anymore and Ride ‘Em Jewboy. When his music career waned in the 1980s, Friedman shifted to being a novelist and writer at large, publishing 1994’s Elvis, Jesus and Coca-Cola: A Novel and 2004’s Kinky Friedman’s Guide to Texas Etiquette: Or How to Get to Heaven or Hell Without Going Through Dallas-Fort Worth. With his sister Marcie, he helped run the Echo Hill Gold Star Camp for children. Kent Perkins, a longtime friend of Friedman, remembered him in a post on his social media. “Somewhere in heaven,” he wrote, “I’m sure there’s a quiet corner with a big easy chair, a bright floor lamp, a big stack of biographical books, and a few old dogs wagging their tails to the faint smell of cigar smoke.” Stream free on",

    "title": "Netflix's 'Apple Cider Vinegar' Is a Wakeup Call About Wellness Misinformation",
    "text": "In 2014, Belle Gibson was at the height of her success. She had built a wellness empire around her app and cookbook, The Whole Pantry, claiming to have cured her terminal brain cancer through natural healing and healthy eating. But there was just one problem—it was all a lie. She didn’t have brain cancer, and she certainly didn’t heal the disease with healthy food. A decade later, Gibson remains one of the wellness industry’s most notorious scammers. Her story is covered in Netflix’s new series Apple Cider Vinegar, which hit the streaming platform in early February.\nWhile the series—which is based on the book The Woman Who Fooled the World—takes creative liberties, the core truth remains: Gibson was a fraud who knowingly misled thousands to believe they could cure serious diseases with food. However, the wellness culture of the 2010s that enabled Gibson to fool masses of people has not gone away. If anything, it is stronger and more influential than ever before.\nThe real-life dangers of alternative therapies\nAnother central plot point of Apple Cider Vinegar revolves around fictional wellness influencer Milla Blake, who, unlike Gibson, really does have cancer. Like Gibson, however, she promotes natural therapies instead of modern treatment and turns to a type of therapy called Hersch to heal herself.\nNetflix\nHersch is fictionalized, but it has much in common with the real-life Gerson program, which, to this day, advises a mix of juicing, coffee enemas, and a vegetarian diet to treat diseases like cancer. The Gerson Institute was founded more than 40 years ago by physician Max Gerson. It has two treatment clinics, one in Tijuana, Mexico, and another in Budapest, Hungary.\nCancer Research UK says of Gerson therapy: “There is no scientific evidence to use it as a treatment for cancer.”\nIt adds: “Many websites are advertising or promoting Gerson therapy. However reputable scientific cancer organizations do not support them. Do not believe information or pay for alternative cancer therapy over the internet.”\nApple Cider Vinegar effectively showcases how dangerous wellness misinformation can be—not just through Gibson’s lies, but also through Blake’s unwavering belief in alternative treatment methods, which ultimately prove to be unsuccessful.\nSpoiler alert: such treatments ultimately cost Blake her life. “I thought the show did a phenomenal job at portraying how someone can be both the victim and the perpetrator of dangerous and misleading health advice,” says Mallory DeMille, a social media correspondent for the Conspirituality podcast, in a video on Instagram.\nHarmful wellness advice is more prevalent on social media than ever\nEvery day, TikTok churns out videos from individuals who claim things like okra water can make your hair grow faster and transform your skin health, eating nothing but sardines can boost your metabolism, and consuming raw meat will give you more energy than ever before. Most of these claims have been debunked by experts, and yet, they still gather thousands, if not millions of views, thanks to increasingly sophisticated algorithms. Hover on one carnivore diet-promoting video for too long, and you will be inundated with similar videos from unqualified influencers claiming that vegetables aren’t necessary for health.\nIn 2024, one survey from Zing Coach suggested that more than half of Gen Z TikTok users turn to the app for health and wellness advice. In the same year, a report from Tebra found that 45 percent of medical advice on the app is either false or misleading. Alternative therapies were among the worst categories of content, with 67 percent of posts dubbed as misleading.\n“I really hope that Apple Cider Vinegar reignites a conversation about the dangers of taking medical advice from wellness influencers who are really just trying to sell you something,” says DeMille.\nEven more concerning, the Gerson Institute and the belief that cancer can be cured with enemas and juicing are also still taking up space in the wellness world. “It’s been 10 years since [Gibson’s] story broke, and I can tell you as someone who has dedicated pretty much their entire platform to talking about the wellness industry and the influencers who market it, that these alternative cancer influencers are still around,” says DeMille, who says coffee enemas, for example, are becoming mainstream. “They are still around in a big way.”\nIt’s also important to remember when you’re scrolling through TikTok or Instagram that, right now, just as it did for Gibson in the mid-2010s, wellness sells. Influencing is a business, and like fashion, beauty, or home influencers, wellness influencers rely on sponsorship deals and ads to make money.\nNetflix\nPlant-based diets and cancer: the truth\nBoth the fictional Hersch program and the real-life Gersch Institute promote the belief that cutting out animal products will help cure cancer. It’s worth reiterating that there is no scientific evidence to back this up.\nThere is, however, plenty of research that suggests that eating more plant-based, whole foods and reducing meat consumption may help to reduce the risk of diseases like cancer developing. Processed meat, for example, is classified by the World Health Organization as a Group One carcinogen, which means it is known to cause cancer. Red meat is Group Two, which means it likely causes cancer. Plant-based whole foods, on the other hand, are rich in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds that may help to reduce the risk of the disease.\n“Many aspects of a healthy, balanced vegetarian and vegan diet align with our Cancer Prevention Recommendations,” states the World Cancer Research Fund. “These include eating a variety of plant-based foods like whole grains (like brown rice), pulses, fruit, and vegetables while limiting red meat and avoiding processed meats such as bacon and ham.”\nPexels\nBECOME A VEGNEWS VIP: Get exclusive product deals, freebies, and perks galore!\nTo be clear: eating more plant-based, whole foods is by no means a guarantee that an individual will not get cancer. Research only suggests that doing so may reduce the risk. Other factors, like giving up smoking, reducing alcohol intake, and exercising more regularly, may also help to reduce the risk of cancer, research indicates.\n“Switching to a plant-based diet can be a wise choice for reducing the risk of certain cancers,” Australian dietitian and doctor of food and nutrition Shy Vishnumohan, PhD, previously told VegNews. “However it is important to bear in mind that multiple factors contribute to cancer risk, including genetics, lifestyle habits, and environmental factors.”\nImportantly, Vishnumohan is talking about prevention—not cure. “[Diet] is just one part of a larger picture of wellness. Life is like a stack of cards,” she said. “While there is no magic bullet that will guarantee 100-percent immunity, making healthy food choices that are plant-forward can be powerful and stack the deck in our favor.”\nJUMP TO\n...\nLatest\nNews\n|\nRecipes\n|\nGuides\n|\nHealth\n|\nSubscribe",

    "title": "How Japan spent more than a century earthquake-proofing its architecture",
    "text": "How Japan spent more than a century earthquake-proofing its architecture\nBy Oscar Holland, CNN\n(CNN) — Scenes of buildings reduced to rubble were beamed around the world this week following a\n7.5 magnitude earthquake that struck Ishikawa prefecture on Japan’s western coast on Monday.\nThe full extent of the damage is still unknown. At least 270 homes in the region were destroyed, authorities said, though the final figure is likely to be much higher. This number does not, for instance, include Suzu or Wajima, a city of more than 27,000 people just 20 miles (32 kilometers) from the quake’s epicenter where fire department officials\nsaid about 200 buildings had burned down, according to public broadcaster NHK.\nThese reports speak to the personal tragedies faced by many of the region’s residents. But while no two seismic events are directly comparable, earthquakes of similar force in other parts of the world — like a 7.6 magnitude quake that caused the collapse of\nover 30,000 buildings in Kashmir in 2005, for example — have often wreaked far greater destruction.\nBy contrast, Ishikawa may have escaped lightly, according to Robert Geller, professor emeritus of seismology at the University of Tokyo.\n“Modern buildings appeared to do very well,” he told CNN the day after Japan’s quake, noting that older houses “with heavy clay tile roofs” seemed to have fared the worst.\n“Most single-family houses, even if they were damaged, didn’t completely collapse,” he said.\nAn adage of seismic design states that earthquakes don’t kill people —\nbuildings do. And in one of the world’s most quake-prone countries, architects, engineers and urban planners have long attempted to disaster-proof towns and cities against major tremors through a combination of ancient wisdom, modern innovation and ever-evolving building codes.\nFrom large-scale “\ndampers,” which swing like pendulums inside skyscrapers, to systems of springs or ball bearings allowing buildings to sway independent of their foundations, technology has progressed dramatically since the Great Kanto earthquake flattened large parts of Tokyo and Yokohama just over 100 years ago.\nBut innovations mostly center on a simple, long-understood idea: that flexibility gives structures the greatest chance of survival.\n“You’ll find a lot of buildings, especially hospitals and important critical structures, are on these rubber (bearings) so that the building itself can sway,” said Miho Mazereeuw, an associate professor of architecture and urbanism at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), who explores Japan’s culture of preparedness in her forthcoming book “\nDesign Before Disaster.”\n“Conceptually, it all comes back to the idea that, rather than resisting the movement of the Earth, you let the building move with it.”\nThis principle has been used in Japan for centuries. Many of the country’s traditional wooden pagodas, for instance, have survived earthquakes (and are more likely to have succumbed to fire or war), even when modern structures did not. Take the Toji temple’s 180-foot (55-meter) tall pagoda, constructed in the 17th century near Kyoto — it famously emerged intact from the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake, also known as the Kobe quake, while many nearby buildings collapsed.\nJapan’s traditional architecture has much in common with that of neighboring Korea and China, though it differs in ways that reflect the country’s higher incidence of earthquakes.\nIn particular, pagodas’ remarkable survival rate has long been credited to “shinbashira” — central pillars made from tree trunks and used by Japanese architects for at least 1,400 years.\nWhether anchored to the ground, resting on a beam or suspended from above, these pillars bend and flex while the building’s individual floors move in the opposite direction to their neighbors. The resulting shimmying movement — often compared to that of a slithering snake — helps counter the force of tremors and is aided by interlocking joints and loose brackets, and wide roof eaves.\nLearning from tragedy\nBuildings in today’s Japan may not all resemble pagodas, but skyscrapers certainly do.\nAlthough the country imposed a strict height limit of 31 meters (102 feet) until the 1960s, due to the dangers posed by natural disasters, architects have since been permitted to build upwards. Today, Japan has more than 270 buildings higher than 150 meters (492 feet), the fifth most in the world, according to\ndata from the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat.\nUsing steel skeletons that add flexibility to notoriously rigid concrete, high-rise designers were further emboldened by the development of large-scale counterweights and “base isolation” systems (like the aforementioned rubber bearings) that act as shock absorbers.\nThe property firm behind Japan’s new\ntallest building, which opened at the Azabudai Hills development in Tokyo last July, claims its quake-resistant design features — including large-scale dampers — will “allow businesses to continue operating” in the event of a seismic event as strong as the record 9.1 magnitude Tohoku earthquake that struck in 2011.\nBut for the many places in Japan without skyscrapers, like Wajima, quake resistance has been more about safeguarding everyday buildings — homes, schools, libraries and stores. And in this regard, Japan’s success has been as much a matter of policy as technology.\nFor one, Japan’s architecture schools have ensured — perhaps due to the country’s history of natural disasters — that students are grounded in both design and engineering, said Mazereeuw, who also directs MIT’s Urban Risk Lab, a research organization examining the seismic and climatic risks facing cities.\n“Unlike in most countries, Japanese architecture schools combine architecture with structural engineering — in the US, you take structural engineering classes but they’re really fluffy,” she said, adding that in Japan the two disciplines “are always tied together.”\nJapanese officials have, over the years, also sought to learn from every major quake the country has faced, with researchers conducting detailed surveys and updating building regulations accordingly.\nThis process traces back to at least the 19th century, said Mazereeuw, explaining how the widespread destruction of new European-style brick and stone buildings in the 1891 Mino-Owari earthquake and 1923 Great Kanto quake led to new laws on city planning and urban buildings.\nThe piecemeal evolution of building regulations continued through the 20th century. But a code introduced in 1981 known as “shin-taishin,” or the New Earthquake Resistant Building Standard Amendment — a direct response to the offshore Miyagi earthquake three years earlier — proved a watershed moment.\nSetting higher requirements for new buildings’ load-carrying capacity and requiring greater “story drift” (how much floors can move relative to one another), among much else, the new standards have proved so effective that homes built to pre-1981 standards (known as “kyu-taishin,” or “before earthquake resistance”) can be\nsignificantly harder to sell and more expensive to insure.\nThe first real test of regulations arrived in 1995 when the Great Hanshin earthquake caused widespread destruction in the southern part of Hyogo prefecture. The results were stark:\n97% of the collapsed buildings had been built before 1981, according to the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery.\nInnovation and preparation\nThe 1995 quake sparked a nationwide drive to retrofit older buildings to 1981 standards — a process that city officials have incentivized through subsidies. Innovation has continued in the decades since, with Japanese architects often leading the pack when it comes to seismic design.\nOne of the country’s best-known architects Kengo Kuma, for instance, collaborated with the textile company Komatsu Matere in 2016 to develop a curtain comprising thousands of\nbraided carbon fiber rods that anchor the firm’s headquarters — just 85 miles from the epicenter of Monday’s quake — to the ground like a tent (pictured top). More recently, he co-designed a kindergarten building, in southern Kochi prefecture, which features a quake-resistant checkerboard-style wall system.\nElsewhere, leading Japanese architects like Shigeru Ban and\nToyo Ito have pioneered the use of cross-laminated timber (CLT), a new type of engineered wood that its advocates believe could transform how high-rises are built. (The first full-scale earthquake simulator test of an engineered timber tower took place at the University of California San Diego last spring, though whether plans for a 1,148-foot-tall CLT tower in Tokyo, proposed by Japanese company Sumitomo Forestry, can ever meet Japan’s strict building codes is another matter).\nAdvanced computer modeling also allows designers to simulate earthquake conditions and build accordingly. Still, the limits of most disaster-proofed buildings have, thankfully, never been put to the test.\n“You have a lot of high-rise buildings, and a lot of effort has been put into designing them to be safe, but those designs are mostly based on computer simulations,” said Geller of the University of Tokyo. “We might not know whether those simulations are accurate or not (until) a big earthquake happens. If even one of those high-rise buildings collapses, there could be a lot of damage.”\nAs such, the question that has long troubled Japan’s engineers and seismologists remains: What if a large earthquake directly hit a city like Tokyo, something officials in the Japanese capital have warned there is a\n70% chance of in the next 30 years?\n“Tokyo is probably reasonably safe,” he added. “But there’s no way to know for sure until the next big earthquake actually happens.”\nCNN’s Eric Cheung and Saki Toi contributed to this report.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

    "text": "DETROIT ( WWJ ) — A Michigan woman who usually doesn’t purchase scratch-off lottery tickets is now a millionaire after she decided to while she was on her way to pick up a pizza.\nThe lucky player, a 41-year-old Shelby Township woman who decided to remain anonymous, bought the winning ticket at Party Palace Liquor at 49133 Schoenherr Road. It was a ticket for the $2,000 Large instant game, according to Michigan Lottery officials.\n“My husband is usually the one who buys scratch-off tickets, but I decided to stop and buy one on my way to pick up pizza,” the player said. “While I was waiting for my pizza, I sat in my car and scratched the ticket. It was surreal when I realized I’d won $2 million. I called my husband to tell him the big news because I was so excited. I couldn’t wait until I got home!”\nShe recently claimed her prize, a one-time lump sum of about $1.3 million, and she plans to use the money to take a vacation and pay her bills.\nEach $20 ticket for the $2,000 Large game gives players a chance to win prizes that range from $20 up to $2 million.",

    "text": "Summit Therapeutics (SMMT, Financial) shares soared by 21.54% amid a broader market uptick, buoyed by positive results from the phase III trial of its promising drug, ivonescimab. The drug trial, conducted in collaboration with Akeso, a key Chinese biotech partner, showcased significant improvements in progression-free survival for lung cancer patients.\nThe trial results signal potential advances in the treatment of advanced or metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as ivonescimab was evaluated against tislelizumab, a treatment by BeiGene (BGNE). Building on previous successes where ivonescimab outperformed Keytruda in NSCLC monotherapy, this new data solidifies its potential as a leading treatment option.\nFrom a financial perspective, Summit Therapeutics (SMMT, Financial) is currently valued at $33.24 per share. Despite its market capitalization of $24.52 billion, the company's financial indicators suggest caution. The stock has two severe warning signs, including a low Piotroski F-Score of 3, which indicates potential operational issues, and a Sloan Ratio suggesting poor quality of earnings. However, Summit shows strong financial strength overall.\nAccording to its GF Value assessment, Summit Therapeutics is currently considered \"Significantly Overvalued\" with a GF Value of 0.39. Investors may want to consider this valuation when making decisions, as the market price appears to exceed the intrinsic value calculated by this metric.\nSummit Therapeutics Inc., primarily focusing on the development of novel antibiotics and now expanding into oncology, demonstrates strong recent cash flow growth of 39.9% over five years. However, challenges lie ahead with an earning growth estimate of -23.21% over the coming five years, highlighting potential hurdles in achieving profitability.",

Suscríbete a nuestros canales gratuitos hoy:\nEn un comunicado compartido con ACI Prensa, el Centro Magdala explica que Duc in Altum —frase latina tomada del Evangelio de San Lucas y se traduce normalmente como “Remar mar adentro” o “Navegar mar adentro”— “es el centro espiritual” del lugar.\n“Duc in Altum incluye una capilla con una impresionante estructura en forma de barco, que simboliza la misión evangelizadora de la Iglesia. También alberga varias capillas dedicadas a diferentes episodios de la vida de Jesús y María Magdalena”, señala.\nEl Centro Magdala destaca además que al lugar han llegado en estos 10 años “más de un millón de turistas de todas partes del mundo”.\nEn la homilía de la Misa de aniversario de la iglesia, el fundador y director del Centro Magdala, P. Juan Solana LC, destacó que “la dedicación de un templo de piedra es muy parecida a la dedicación de los templos vivos, es decir, de nosotros”, y señaló que “en mi bautismo, Dios, por un acto infinito de amor y de generosidad, me hizo piedra viva de su templo, me hizo templo del Espíritu Santo”\n“Este lugar ha sido testigo de corazones sanados, vocaciones recibidas a la vida sacerdotal y religiosa, y dignidad restaurada de muchas almas”, resaltó.\nEl P. Solana expresó además su deseo de que Duc in Altum “continúe siendo y sea siempre un lugar del cual manan esos ríos de agua viva, esa acción de la gracia”.",

    "title": "What To Know About the Treatment and Diagnosis of Syphilis",
    "text": "Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by bacteria. There are four stages of syphilis. The infection is curable, especially with early diagnosis and treatment. Untreated syphilis can lead to severe health complications affecting the heart, brain, and other organs.\nIn some cases, damage from advanced untreated syphilis can be permanent. Treatment for syphilis involves taking antibiotics like penicillin. Treatment becomes more challenging as the infection becomes more advanced.\nStages of Syphilis\nSyphilis has four different stages: primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary. Although the stages occur in order, the time a person is in each stage varies. If you are sexually active, being aware of the different stages, especially the early ones, can help you seek treatment earlier for syphilis.\nPrimary Stage\nIf you are exposed to the bacteria that causes syphilis, it can take about 3-4 weeks for the first symptoms to show.\nIn the first stage of syphilis, you will develop a type of sore called a chancre around your vagina, anus, penis, or mouth. They are usually round and painless.\nIt can be challenging to recognize that you have syphilis at this stage because you may only develop a single sore. These sores will heal on their own, making people think the underlying issue has been resolved.\nSecondary Stage\nYou may enter the secondary stage before or after the primary sore has healed. In this stage, you will likely develop skin rashes where the sore was or on other areas, like the palms of your hands and the bottoms of your feet. These rashes are usually red and don't itch—you might not notice that you have them.\nYou may experience additional symptoms in this stage, such as:\n- Fever\n- Sore throat\n- Muscle aches\n- Headache\n- Tiredness\nLike the primary stage, these symptoms usually go away on their own. Without treatment, though, you will still have syphilis, and the infection will continue to progress.\nLatent Stage\nOnce the symptoms of the previous stages resolve, you will enter the latent stage. During this time, you won't experience any symptoms for weeks or years.\nYou still have syphilis, and left untreated, the infection can advance to the tertiary stage. For this reason, it's important to regularly test for sexually transmitted diseases—even if you have no symptoms of syphilis, you will still test positive.\nTertiary Stage\nIf your syphilis remains untreated, you may develop tertiary syphilis up to 30 years after the initial bacterial infection. Tertiary syphilis is a serious health condition that can affect several areas of your body, including your heart.\nTreatment is possible but more challenging during the tertiary stage, as the underlying damage from the infection may be permanent. In severe cases, syphilis can result in death.\nHow Is Syphilis Diagnosed?\nSyphilis is an infection from the bacteria Treponema pallidum and can be diagnosed through several methods. You must complete two types of blood tests or a special microscope test to receive a syphilis diagnosis.\nIf you have symptoms of syphilis in the brain and spinal cord, your healthcare provider may also order a test using your cerebrospinal fluid (fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord).\nNontreponemal Tests\nA nontreponemal test is a blood test that looks for evidence that the syphilis bacteria Treponema pallidum is in your body.\nThe rapid plasma reagin (RPR) and Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) tests are two examples of nontreponemal tests. The VDRL test screens your blood sample for the presence of antibodies to the syphilis bacteria.\nAntibodies are proteins that form as an immune response to harmful compounds, like infectious bacteria. The presence of certain antibodies would signal the presence of an infection.\nTreponemal Tests\nTreponemal tests are more advanced blood tests that also look for the presence of Treponema pallidum in your body. These tests are typically used to confirm a syphilis diagnosis if you test positive on a nontreponemal test.\nThese tests can also help determine if you've previously had a syphilis infection.\nDark-Field Microscopy Test\nDuring this test, a specialist will take a small sample of your blood and place it under a microscope. They will immediately examine the blood through the microscope under special lighting that allows them to detect bacteria that cause syphilis.\nCerebrospinal Fluid Test\nSome people with syphilis develop symptoms related to neurosyphilis—a type of syphilis that affects the brain, spinal cord, and eyes. To determine if you have this type of syphilis, you'll need to have a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) test.\nFor this test, a medical provider will inject a local anesthetic into your lower back. They will then use a needle to withdraw a small amount of cerebrospinal fluid from between two vertebrae (spine bones). The lab will test this fluid for the presence of syphilis-causing bacteria.\nTreatment Options for Syphilis\nSince syphilis is a bacterial infection, antibiotics can treat it. Benzathine penicillin G (BPG) is the most effective antibiotic for syphilis. Options such as doxycycline and ceftriaxone are available for those allergic to penicillin.\nSyphilis is a curable sexually transmitted disease, especially when diagnosed early. However, untreated syphilis can cause permanent organ damage and, in some cases, can lead to death.\nComplications of Untreated Syphilis\nUntreated syphilis can have serious health complications, including neurosyphilis, ocular syphilis, otosyphilis, and congenital syphilis. Untreated tertiary syphilis can also cause organ damage to your heart.\nNeurosyphilis\nWhen the bacterial infection reaches the brain and spinal cord, you may develop neurosyphilis, with symptoms including dementia, confusion, muscle weakness, and severe headaches. Neurosyphilis can occur during any stage of syphilis but becomes more likely as the infection goes untreated.\nOcular Syphilis\nThe bacterial infection causing syphilis can also spread to the eyes, causing inflammation. When this occurs, you may experience eye pain or redness, vision changes, and vision loss—which may be permanent.\nOtosyphilis\nOtosyphilis is a complication of syphilis to the ears. It occurs when the infection spreads to the ear structures and nerves. Symptoms include dizziness, vertigo, hearing loss, and other changes in your hearing.\nCongenital Syphilis\nIf you're pregnant and have syphilis, it is very important to receive treatment right away. Syphilis may be passed from the pregnant parent to the fetus through the placenta during pregnancy. Congenital syphilis can cause stillbirth, premature birth, death of the infant, and long-term health concerns.\nLiving With Syphilis\nSyphilis is easily curable at early stages, and there are strategies you can use to prevent infection. The only 100% effective way to prevent syphilis is abstinence. Other strategies to reduce your chances of infection include:\n- Use condoms consistently and correctly\n- Have open and honest\ncommunication about STIswith your sexual partners - Test regularly for STIs\n- Be in long-term monogamous relationships\nHaving syphilis does not make you immune to future infections; you can have many new syphilis infections over your lifetime. It's important to practice safe sex and get tested regularly for STIs, especially since the early stages of syphilis are often overlooked.\nSome risk factors increase your risk of syphilis infection. You may be more likely to get syphilis if you:\n- Have an HIV diagnosis\n- Are sexually active with multiple partners\n- Are a man who has sex with men\n- Are a part of a racial or ethnic minority group\n- Are a young woman (age 24 and under)\nIf you are at higher risk for syphilis, getting regular testing—even when you aren't showing any symptoms—can help identify and treat syphilis infections as early as possible.\nA Quick Review\nSyphilis is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) that progresses through four stages: primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary.\nIt starts with painless sores, followed by rashes, and then enters a symptom-free latent phase. Some people may develop tertiary syphilis, which can cause organ damage and be life-threatening if untreated.\nDiagnosis requires blood or microscope tests, and treatment is primarily antibiotics like penicillin. If untreated, syphilis can lead to severe complications, including neurosyphilis and congenital syphilis. Condom use, regular testing, and other safe sex practices can help prevent syphilis.",

    "text": "Contribuyen sectores a la recuperación de empleos en Sonora La industria manufacturera fue la que más crecimiento registró en 2023. HERMOSILLO, Sonora.- Sectores económicos del Estado han colaborado en la recuperación de empleos este año lo que ha contribuido a mejorar la economía de Sonora. Este año la industria manufacturera fue la que más crecimiento reportó en materia económica y empleos al recuperar los 20 mil que se perdieron durante la pandemia de Covid y crear 33 mil 500 nuevos en el periodo de enero a noviembre. Jesús Gámez García, presidente de Index (Industria Maquiladora y Manufactura de Exportación) señaló que al cierre de diciembre prevén llegar a 35 mil nuevos empleos, de los cuales poco más 18 mil 500 fueron creados en Hermosillo por la [ apertura del tercer turno en la planta Ford.](https://www.elimparcial.com/sonora/sonora/Resaltan-movimiento-economico-en-Sonorapor-Ford-Motor-Company-20230712-0018.html) Apuntó que en el 2023 crecieron el triple en materia de empleos, al pasar de 11 mil 500 nuevos empleos en 2022 a 35 mil, que es la proyección al cierre de diciembre, es decir, mil 500 más de lo que generaron en noviembre. Vemos un año que nos trajo mucho crecimiento para las empresas instaladas, estamos hablando de crecimiento orgánico y estamos viendo que el próximo año será igual o mejor que el 2023 por la tendencia de la relocalización de empresas vía ‘nearshoring’ va a seguir pero se van sumando factores como el China más uno”, indicó. Las empresas chinas, dijo, buscan relocalizar una planta fuera de su país y Estados Unidos enfrenta dificultades para encontrar mano de obra para trabajar en la industria y lo que ha generado interés en moverse a México para reforzar operaciones o realizar nuevas instalaciones. “El tema de la electromovilidad que está creciendo por los carros eléctricos, en el mercado de Norteamérica hay mucho auge y México es la principal atracción de la industria que está en la cadena de suministro y eso hace que Sonora también aparezca en ese mapa”, externó. La instalación de semiconductores en Phoenix, Arizona, agregó, hace que Sonora sea una región atractiva natural para proveer componentes a esa industria, pues cuenta con las condiciones para hacerlo. REPUNTA LA CONSTRUCCIÓN La industria de la construcción este año no sólo recuperó el 22% que perdió durante la pandemia de Covid, sino que además creció un 6% por las inversiones por las obras públicas y privadas que están en curso en el Estado, señaló Jorge Aguirre Robles. El presidente de la Cámara Mexicana de la Industria de la Construcción (CMIC) subrayó que este año se ha registrado una gran cantidad de inversiones por el crédito de 2 mil 100 millones de pesos que se invertirá en 110 acciones a favor de 116 municipios. Subrayó que las obras públicas responden a necesidades urgentes del Estado como la conducción de agua en la avenida Tecnológico en Nogales para evitar inundaciones, así como rehabilitaciones de carreteras, auditorios, calles en Hermosillo, y otras. Aparte hay mucha obra tradicional municipal, estatal y federal, así como inversiones de gran envergadura como las vías de tren en Nogales, la del puerto de Guaymas, la fotovoltaica de Peñasco, todo esto genera bastante trabajo y lo importante es que es en varias regiones”, subrayó. COMERCIO CON 360 MIL EMPLEOS El sector comercial este año acaparó 360 mil empleos formales en Sonora, lo que significa un 7% de crecimiento económico con relación al 2022 y las expectativas es que este ritmo se mantenga durante el 2024. Juventino Félix Lugo, presidente de la Cámara Nacional de Comercio y Servicios Turísticos (Canaco Servytur) Hermosillo, señaló que los empleos que generaron sus representados tienen sueldos de más de 5 mil pesos mensuales. Fue mejor el 2023 para el sector comercial, fue un año de crecimiento arriba de las expectativas, veníamos de años difíciles, cadenas de suministro poco restringidas, efectos de Covid, la gente con futuros inciertos o baja expectativa de que repitieran en los encierros, en otro brote o nuevas variantes”, apuntó. A mitad de 2023 el País mostró un crecimiento y aunque en Sonora y Hermosillo fue paulatino, la cifra de desempleo y la inflación son a la baja por el incremento en las inversiones directas que llegaron al Estado, lo que da como resultado un mejor año. “Según el Inegi dato el sector comercial abarca 360 mil puestos de trabajo en el Estado con sueldo promedio arriba de 5 mil pesos mensuales, eso nos da un panorama para el próximo año que es lo que estamos viviendo, es una derrama económica de mil 800 millones de pesos mensuales sólo en nóminas, sabemos que vienen inversiones. “El Gobierno del Estado sigue con infraestructura en el puerto de Guaymas, en el cambio de las vías del tren en Imuris-Nogales, el crecimiento de la planta fotovoltaica y lo más importante que está por venir es la planta de gas licuado, eso nos da un panorama muy interesante para el sector terciario para 2024”, destacó. TURISMO SUPERA CIFRAS DEL 2019 El sector turístico registró este año al cierre de noviembre un crecimiento en la ocupación de tres puntos con relación al 2022 y de uno comparado con 2019, que fue el año récord en la historia de Hermosillo, reveló Francisco García Karam. El presidente de la Oficina de Convenciones y Visitantes (OCV) señaló que este año contribuyeron los eventos deportivos que se realizaron en los periodos bajos de la plaza. “La Codeson entre junio y julio nos generó, no solamente a Hermosillo sino también a otros puntos, alrededor de cinco eventos nacionales e internacionales los cuales aumentaron y te digo aumentaron la ocupación en fechas donde por lo regular son muy bajas”, subrayó. En empleo, dijo, no ha realizado un sondeo para ver cuánto aumentó la plantilla en hoteles, pero cada evento que se realiza genera plazas temporales o a terceros. La última vez que vimos eso era el 4% de la población económicamente activa la que trabajaba en un tema de turismo y estoy convencido que ahora vamos a superar el 5%”, puntualizó. En materia de inversión ya están en pláticas con dos cadenas de hoteles para la instalación de dos nuevos que vendrán a sumarse a las 5 mil habitaciones que ya hay en Hermosillo. “En una plaza de casi 5 mil habitaciones habíamos tenido como máximo un 59% de ocupación en el 2019 y ahorita traemos el 60% a expensas de lo que genere diciembre”, indicó García. Añadió que los pasajeros en tránsito que reporta el Aeropuerto Internacional Ignacio Pesqueira que en octubre ya [se había superado los 2 millones.](https://www.elimparcial.com/sonora/hermosillo/Aeropuerto-de-Hermosillo-llega-a-2-millones-de-pasajeros-este-ano-20231130-0018.html) MINERÍA GENERA MÁS RECURSOS La minería de Sonora de enero a octubre de 2023 aportó 112 mil 287 millones de pesos, lo que representa el 31.4% de la producción minero-metalúrgica nacional, lo que lo llevó a ocupar el primer lugar en el País, resaltó David Ramos Félix. El presidente de la Asociación de Ingenieros en Mina, Metalurgistas y Geólogos de México (Aimmgm), apuntó que el 2023 ha sido de grandes retos para el sector minero y confían que el 2024 reforzarán de manera profesional todo el trabajo que para refrendar el liderazgo nacional en producción de minerales. Expuso que este 2023 la minería aportó más del 25% del Producto Interno Bruto en la entidad, generó 146 mil empleos directos e indirectos, han mantenido el liderazgo nacional en la producción de cobre, oro, plata y grafito, y es el único Estado productor de wollastonita en el País, y eso ha llevado a México a ocupar el tercer lugar a nivel mundial. La minería actual es responsable con el medio ambiente, por lo que se suma a los esfuerzos del Gobierno y de la sociedad civil por la conservación y protección de la biodiversidad, por ejemplo, la minería en Sonora mantiene acciones y programas de conservación a favor del lobo gris mexicano, jaguar, guajolote de Gould, venado cola blanca y coatí”, externó. AFECTA LA SEQUÍA EXTREMA El sector primario, principalmente el ganadero este año registrará un decrecimiento económico luego de que los productores optaron por vender el 25% de su hato que se suma al 40% del 2021, admitió Juan Carlos Ochoa Valenzuela. El presidente de la Unión Ganadera Regional en Sonora (UGRS), informó que este año les fue mal en el tema de lluvias y es sabido por todos que Sonora enfrenta una sequía extrema. Nosotros dependemos de la lluvia, entonces, el sector está bastante golpeado en ese sentido. Si el año pasado fue buenísimo en lluvias y éste no llovió tenemos un problema serio porque estamos cayendo en el hato ganadero”, comentó. Aunque no tienen una medición en empleos por la reducción del hato, dijo, seguramente los números son inferiores al 2022 porque al haber menos ganado la actividad en los establos se reduce. El tema de sequía, dijo, es serio no sólo en el campo, sino también para el consumo humano y eso ha derivado la preocupación de los sectores económicos y gobiernos. “… lo único bueno en medio de tanta tragedia es que los mercados de ganado fueron muy buenos este año, cayeron fuerte en los dos últimos dos meses comparado con el año pasado, pero siguen siendo muy buenos”, aseguró. Ochoa Valenzuela agregó que económicamente si hubo una buena respuesta porque se generó más dinero de lo esperado con las ventas, pero no han dejado de decrecer y no hay ningún pronóstico de lluvias fuertes.",
