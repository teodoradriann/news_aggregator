    "text": "Liverpool won 3-1 at home to Leicester to go seven points clear at the top of the Premier League, with Cody Gakpo standing out in particular.\nLiverpool 3-1 Leicester Premier League (17), Anfield\nDecember 26, 2024\nGoals: Gakpo 46′, Jones 49′, Salah 82′; Ayew 6′\nAlisson (out of 10) – 7 Alisson has made a seamless return to the team and he was as safe as ever.\nHe could do nothing about Jordan Ayew’s early strike, with a nick off Virgil van Dijk giving him no hope.\nLiverpool’s No. 1 was otherwise untested, not making a save of note.\nTrent Alexander-Arnold – 6 It was a mixed night for Alexander-Arnold, who produced both class and frustrating moments.\nSome delicious crosses were delivered from the right, but his corners were consistently poor, and one shot fired into the Kop wasn’t received well.\nAdequate overall.\nJoe Gomez – 7 Continuing in the absence of Ibrahima Konate, Gomez wasn’t always convincing against Leicester.\nHe can often shrink after an iffy start, which happened here, with a couple of sloppy passes met with annoyance by the home crowd.\nGomez made some important interceptions, however, and got much better as the game went on, which he deserves great credit for.\nVirgil van Dijk – 7 Van Dijk coasted through proceedings overall, although he may feel he could have done slightly better in cutting out the ball for Ayew’s goal.\nThat’s being harsh, though.\nOtherwise, Van Dijk went about his duties with ease, as Liverpool dominated possession at Anfield, completing 98 percent of his passes.\nAndy Robertson – 7 While Robertson appears to be entering the twilight of his top-level career, he produced an encouraging performance this time around.\nThe Scot was poor for Ayew’s opener, getting his body in a bad position and being outfoxed, but he did play a great long ball to Gakpo before the break.\nHit the post with a header and offered constant endeavour, though not quite the force he was.\nRyan Gravenberch – 6 Gravenberch has started every Premier League game so far this season, but this was one of his less influential performances overall.\nThat’s not to say that the Dutchman did much wrong, keeping the ball ticking over, but he didn’t boss the midfield as much as he has so often.\nAlexis Mac Allister – 7 There were times when Mac Allister looked off the pace early on, but he really grew into the game.\nThe Argentine never stopped pressing, showing such tenacity out of possession, and he was crisp in his use of the ball.\nAssisted Curtis Jones with a precise low cross and got a nice reception after being substituted late on.\nCurtis Jones – 7 Jones came in for Dominik Szoboszlai in the No. 10 role, but struggled to enjoy a convincing outing initially.\nHe dawdled in front of goal with the net gaping, and as can be the case at times, he was guilty of holding onto the ball for too long in general.\nThat said, he put Liverpool 2-1 up with a well-taken finish to ease the nerves, and like so many, was better as the game went on.\nMohamed Salah – 7 On current form, Salah has a strong argument for being the best player in the world.\nHe was busy early on, producing one lovely flick to Jones, but some of his execution was lacking its usual inch-perfect brilliance.\nSalah hit the bar and played some nice slide passes into dangerous areas, before scoring his 100th home goal in the Premier League to complete the scoring.\nShort of his very best, but perhaps we expect too much at times.\nCody Gakpo – 8 (Man of the Match) Gakpo was again deployed in his strongest left-sided role, and during a dour opening 45 minutes he was Liverpool’s most dangerous attacking player.\nThe 25-year-old looked a threat cutting inside and it was his brilliant curled effort that made it 1-1 seconds before the break.\nHe had a goal harshly disallowed after the break and then assisted Salah. The pick of Liverpool’s players by a distance.\nDarwin Nunez – 6 Nunez returned to the team at the expense of Luis Diaz, knowing how vital it was for him to produce a big performance.\nOnce again, though, you were left wanting more from the Uruguayan, who offered little in terms of link-up play and got caught offside too often.\nHe did produce a nice flick in the lead up to Jones’ goal, though, and was denied by the goalkeeper after some sharp movement.\nSubstitutes\nDominik Szoboszlai (on for Jones, 77′) – 6\nBooked, which means he misses the West Ham game through suspension.\nDiogo Jota (on for Nunez, 77′) – 6\nA quiet cameo from the Portuguese.\nKostas Tsimikas (on for Robertson, 86′) – N/A\nWataru Endo (on for Gravenberch, 86′) – N/A\nHarvey Elliott (on for Mac Allister, 92′) – N/A\nSubs not used: Kelleher, Quansah, Chiesa, Diaz\nArne Slot – 9\nThings couldn’t be going better for Slot, with Chelsea’s 2-1 defeat at home to Fulham only adding to the importance of three points for his side.\nThe two changes to his starting lineup made sense, allowing a freshness within the squad, but the first-half display was lacking.\nBut Slot yet again got a much improved performance from his team after the break, as they ended up easing to victory at Anfield.\nSeven points clear with a game in hand – what a job the boss is doing!\nLiverpool 3-1 Leicester\nMATCH REPORT: Reds deliver gift of 7-point gap at the top PLAYER RATINGS: We can all agree on the obvious Man of the Match, right? TALKING POINTS: Gakpo excels in another second-half response SLOT SAYS: Insists “it is far too early to be already celebrating” JONES MILESTONE: Reveals Klopp text after landmark game SALAH MESSAGE: Dodges contract question with fan message SZOBO SUSPENSION: Will miss Liverpool’s next Premier League game",

    "title": "Trump jumps off script right from the start of event at border wall - Roll Call",
    "text": "Donald Trump went to the southern border to paint Vice President Kamala Harris as responsible for a migrant crisis as he and the Democratic presidential nominee’s allies traded barbs ahead of her big national convention moment.\nBut he did not immediately do so. Instead, the GOP presidential nominee went off-script as soon as he stepped to a microphone on a dusty road beside a towering brown strip of border wall, talking about the Democrat he wanted to be running against this fall.\n“Joe Biden, the way that he was taken out was a coup,” Trump said as he began speaking in Sierra Vista, Ariz., on Thursday, hours before Harris was scheduled to formally accept Democrats’ presidential nomination in Chicago. “He got 14 million [primary] votes, and the person running now (Harris) got none.”\nHe then instantly shifted from the 2024 primaries to 2020, when Harris was in the pack of Democrats seeking the nomination, though that context was left unsaid.\n“She was disgraced. She was figured out by the Democratic voters. She never made it to Iowa. … And now she’s running against us. The good news is I think we’re winning in the polls, from what I’ve seen. … It was a coup of an American president. And it was done with anger,” Trump said.\nTrump then managed to focus on illegal immigration for most of the event, with some exceptions, contending Biden “has allowed 20 million people into our country [illegally],” adding: “We have to clean up our border.”\nThe remarks continued Trump’s recent trend of veering off his campaign aides’ plans to focus on key policy issues and Harris.\nOn the border, Trump vowed, if elected, to start a “mass deportation of criminals” program and “seal the border.” He also said his administration would seek strict sentences for “illegal alien criminals,” including a 10-year mandatory minimum sentence for anyone convicted of human smuggling, a “guaranteed life sentence for anyone [found] guilty of child trafficking, and a death penalty for anyone guilty of child or woman sex trafficking.” He also promised his administration would seek the death penalty for drug dealers and drug traffickers, as well as anyone who is found guilty of killing law enforcement personnel.\nAnswering a question from a reporter, Trump vowed to cut off all trade and slap substantial tariffs on Central and South American countries if they refused to take back any of their citizens returned by his possible administration for entering the United States illegally.\nThe former president and his surrogates, including many congressional Republicans, have tried hitting Harris on illegal immigration, calling her Biden’s “border czar” and questioning why she has not done more while in office to curb illegal border crossings.\nHarris was not put in charge of immigration issues, however. Biden did assign her to lead a group of actions intended to “address the root causes of migration from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.”\nTo Trump’s left in Cochise County were pieces of a border wall that was one of the chief campaign promises of his administration — stacked up on the ground rather than installed. Those sections were never completed once Biden took office.\n“There are a lot of rough people on the other side,” Trump said, pointing toward Mexico. He falsely stated his administration had “the best numbers in recorded history” on illegal crossings.\n“For nearly four years as border czar, Comrade Kamala has overseen a nation-wrecking border invasion,” he said. “She’s allowed at least 20 million people, all illegal aliens into our country, including millions and millions of unvetted fighting-aged men from over 158 countries.”\nWhite House and Harris campaign officials for weeks have touted federal law enforcement data showing border crossings have been declining, however.\nTrump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, was in Valdosta, Ga., on Thursday, where he contended Harris only recently “found Jesus” on issues like crime and immigration. He contended Biden administration officials, including Harris, enacted policies that have made law enforcement’s job even tougher.\nHe also contended Harris was “so into soft-on-crime policies” that she selected “the perfect running mate,” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. “Do we want Kamala Harris as the prosecutor in chief of this country? No,” Vance said from a parking lot outside a law enforcement building. “We want Donald J. Trump.”\nSenior Trump campaign aides on a Sunday call with reporters stressed they wanted several events this week to focus mostly on policy issues as Democrats met at Chicago’s United Center. But as he did Thursday in Arizona, Trump veered off those topics all week, with the candidate making false statements and engaging in name-calling.\nNotably, at one point Trump appeared to acknowledge he lost the 2020 election, saying he “came up a little short.”\nOn Wednesday in North Carolina, another battleground, Trump wondered aloud why he is criticized for taking personal jabs at his opponents when former President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle Obama, made personal statements about him at the convention Tuesday evening.\nAn average of several polls of Arizonans tabulated by RealClearPolitics showed Trump and Harris virtually tied in the battleground state.\nA national polling calculation by FiveThirtyEight showed Harris has opened a 47 percent to 43.7 percent lead over Trump, with independent candidate Robert Kennedy Jr. netting 4.8 percent. Kennedy reportedly could drop out as soon as Friday, and some analysts have said that likely would help Trump.\n‘Trump killed that bill’ Even before Trump spoke, the Harris campaign had deployed surrogates to try to flip the border issue back on the former president.\nArizona Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly challenged Trump’s calling the U.S.-Mexico border “wide open,” arguing crossings have drastically decreased while Harris as been vice president\n“The fact is that Vice President Harris is the only candidate who has a record of standing up for Arizona border communities and can be trusted to support our communities and fix the broken system,” Kelly, who was due to speak ahead of Harris at the convention Thursday, said in a statement.\n“We’ve seen crossings at Arizona’s border decrease — including a 32 percent decline in July — thanks to the executive actions of the Biden-Harris administration,” Kelly added. “There is more work to be done, but Kamala Harris is the one for the job. This is [in] stark contrast to Donald Trump and JD Vance, who don’t want real solutions to the issue.”\nSpeakers at this week’s convention have repeatedly noted that Trump spearheaded an effort that sunk a bipartisan border and immigration package the White House negotiated with Senate Republicans and Democrats.\n“Trump killed that bill, and he did it because he knew that if we fixed the border, he’d lose his ability to divide us, his ability to fan the flames of fear,” Sen. Christopher S. Murphy, D-Conn., who was involved in the negotiations, told delegates Wednesday night. “For 20 years, Kamala Harris has been tough as nails when it comes to securing our border.”\nAsked about such comments, Trump called the Senate package “weak” and “terrible,” instead endorsing a more conservative version crafted and passed by House Republicans.\nTo be sure, Harris has a long way to go on the issue.\nA survey conducted Aug. 14-16 by CBS News found that among likely voters who called the southern border a major issue, 76 percent supported Trump while just 24 percent supported the vice president.\n“San Francisco liberal Kamala Harris’ fake promises to secure the border will never become reality,” Will Reinert, the National Republican Congressional Committee’s national press secretary, said in a Thursday statement. “The same Kamala who wanted to abolish ICE and decriminalize illegal border crossings, will cave to House Democrats’ open-border demands.”",

    "title": "Had a bad experience buying weed? How to report a marijuana product to state regulators",
    "text": "Jan. 24—In the last 10 years, electronic cannabis pens have completely taken marijuana smokers by storm. The ease of a quick hit has never been as convenient, low-key or efficient. A variety of cartridges can be found in just about any dispensary, with more new strains constantly being released.\nHowever, this surge of vapor products has left some wondering about the safety aspects. How regulated are cannabis cartridges and disposables? How can I be sure I’m smoking safely?\nThe biggest concern when it comes to product safety, beyond consumption, is pesticides, according to Brian Smith, media director for the Washington State Liquor and Cannabis Board (LCB). Some pesticides can be safely used in cannabis production, but others cannot. The Washington State Department of Agriculture has a list of approved pesticides, and you can sign up for updates.\nBecause there are so many kinds of pesticides, the WSDA specifies which unapproved pesticides are more likely to be used in cannabis production. Products are tested for these pesticides.\nMarket-ready cannabis cartridges\nProducts have to be tested extensively before they enter the marketplace, but some things can still slip through the cracks. Laboratories where cannabis products are produced must undergo an extensive certification process.\nFields of testing include:\n* Heavy metal analysis\n* Microbial analysis\n* Pesticide analysis\n* Potency analysis\n* Residual solvent analysis\n* Water activity analysis\nProducts that fail pesticide testing are destroyed.\nBut what happens if you use a product and still suspect pesticides? Or what if there is another safety issue, like mold? Here’s what you can do.\nReporting unsafe cannabis products\nThe LCB accepts consumer reports of unsafe products and potential violations, both over the phone and online.\nIf reporting online, mark the violation type as “other.” You’ll want to look up the grower and processor of the product, to include that information when reporting.\nIf you make a report over the phone, call the enforcement customer service line at 360-664-9878.\nSmith says LCB responds to all reports and looks into each claim. It has testing agreements with the WSDA and the Washington State Patrol’s toxicology lab, which are used to follow-up on the majority of claims.\nThis story was originally published January 24, 2024, 6:59 AM.\n(c)2024 Tri-City Herald (Kennewick, Wash.)

    "text": "OTTAWA — Health Canada is reminding Canadians about a recall of home bed assist handles after learning of an additional death. Four models of bed handles distributed by Drive Medical were first recalled two years ago after two reported deaths — one in Canada and one in the U.S. Health Canada says as of Dec. 19, the company has received a report of a second death in this country. The metal handles are affixed alongside the mattress to help people get in and out of their regular bed at home. The products are not designed for hospital beds. Health Canada says more than 68,000 of the affected handles were sold between 2016 and 2021 in Canada. It says consumers should stop using them and contact Drive Medical Canada to get a refund. The recalled home bed assist model numbers are 15064, 15062, RTL15073 and RTL15063-ADJ. No information has been provided about what caused any of the deaths, but the recall notice says that retention straps were not properly secured in the initial cases in Canada and the U.S. Drive Medical has also learned of an additional three deaths in the U.S. that happened before Dec. 6, 2021, when the recall was first issued. More than 496,000 of the bed assist products were distributed in the U.S. between 2007 and 2021. The products were sold on Amazon. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 28, 2023.

    "text": "I don’t mean to say I told you so. But for over 3 years I’ve been screaming from the highest mountains that what we are seeing and experiencing is a communist takeover of the USA. Last week it was President Trump being falsely persecuted and convicted. Today it’s Steve Bannon being sent to prison. Who’s next to be persecuted by this administration? I’ve argued and warned since the day of Biden’s election that this would be Obama’s third term. Biden is a brain-dead zombie puppet with diapers, who belongs in a nursing home. All along, Obama has been the real President, giving the orders, and coordinating this communist takeover of the USA. Obama started the election rigging in 2012 by using the IRS to go after GOP donors, conservative PACs and critics of his administration. By 2020 Obama perfected the election rigging by taking advantage of the Covid pandemic. He used changes in election laws, mail-in ballots, ballot harvesting, ballot drop boxes and no Voter ID to steal the election. Once Obama had control of the government, that gave him control of the DOJ and FBI, giving him free rein to persecute Trump and Trump’s allies. The latest victim is Steve Bannon. He won’t be the last. All roads lead to Obama. Let me count the ways Obama’s fingerprints are all over this communist takeover… By stealing the 2020 election, that gave Obama control over the border. He then used Cloward-Piven (the communist plan we both learned at Columbia University) to flood the nation with millions of illegal alien invaders, shower them with trillions of dollars in welfare, and blow up the national debt. This also changed the demographics of America. Waving in millions of new foreigners is “the Great Replacement Theory.” This is how Obama insures no Republican will ever be elected president again. Obama ordered the spying of Trump and framed Trump with false charges of “Russian Collusion.” Now Obama is the one coordinating the indictments and the rigged trials against Trump. Throw in Peter Navarro, Rudy Guliani, Steve Bannon, Alex Jones- one by one Obama and his communist cabal are putting leading conservatives in prison, or taking away their life savings. Look at the base of these protests, Columbia University. Obama was my college classmate at Columbia University, Class of ’83. Obama has dirty ex-FBI and ex-CIA operatives filling all the important roles at social media companies. Even a company like X owned by conservative hero Elon Musk censors and shadow bans every word I say. How can this be? Because Elon owns X, but he doesn’t control it. The same communist traitors are running the show as before Elon took over. Trending: Nasty Leftist Comedian Makes SICK Sexualized Joke About Conservative Activist’s Baby Son – Gets Punched, and Finds Out That ‘The World Is Not Twitter’ Green Energy is a fraud. It leads to exploding electric and gas bills, in order to wipe out the great American middle class. Energy rates are now the highest in history. This pattern started under Obama. It was so bad back then, that I wrote the nationwide #1 bestseller, “The Ultimate Obama Survival Guide.” Today we are experiencing Obama on steroids. It’s all the strategy of Saul Alinsky- who was Obama’s mentor. Obama bases his whole agenda on Saul Alinsky’s “Rules for Radicals.” Alinsky advised to isolate, ostracize, demonize and destroy your political enemy. Any lie, fraud, or slander is acceptable- because Alinsky said, “the ends justify the means.” The Covid vaccine continues to injure and kill thousands of Americans daily- including so many of my friends and associates. Trump supported the vaccine in order to save the US economy, but he never mandated it, and he never will. But of course, this communist takeover coordinated by Obama forcedthis experimental, emergency-use-only vaccine upon every working man and woman in America. Which violated the Nuremberg Code. So, who’s the real Hitler? Trump is beating Biden by a landslide. It’s all but over. Democrats know that. So, first they rigged the NY trial to falsely convict Trump. Now their brainwashed, communist judge with “Trump Derangement Syndrome” can order Trump to prison. Or demand he stay under house arrest at Maralago- thereby preventing Trump’s highly effective campaign rallies. These same communist thugs are actually accelerating the raids on homes of J6 protestors over three years later. Once in prison, they are tortured with cruel and unusual punishment- including solitary confinement. It’s all about intimidation. That’s what communist thugs do. Steve was just ordered to report to prison on July 1st. He will be in a jail cell until November. Perfect timing to silence the leader of MAGA for the entire presidential campaign. This is not normal. These are not your father’s Democrats. These are evil communist traitors. And this is a communist color revolution.",

    "text": "Wales sink Finland to book play-off final clash with PolandFootball Alexis Mac Allister fired Liverpool back to the top of the Premier League as the Argentine's superb strike inspired a tense 3-1 win against lowly Sheffield United on Thursday. Jurgen Klopp's side were growing anxious after Darwin Nunez's early opener was cancelled out by Conor Bradley's own [goal](https://sportsbrief.com/football/25961-ranking-top-10-footballers-goals-history-soccer/) in the second half. But Mac Allister eased the nerves around [Anfield](https://sportsbrief.com/tags/anfield/) with a brilliant finish from the edge of the area and Cody Gakpo sealed the points in the closing moments. On a potentially pivotal evening in the title race, Liverpool moved two points clear of second placed Arsenal with eight games left for each of the three teams involved in a gripping battle for supremacy. Arsenal's 2-0 win against Luton had knocked Liverpool out of pole position on Wednesday, with third-placed Manchester City's 4-1 rout of Aston Villa keeping them in the hunt. Wales sink Finland to book play-off final clash with PolandFootball But Liverpool, unbeaten in their last 28 home league matches, are now a step closer to being crowned English champions for a record-equalling 20th time and first since 2020. PAY ATTENTION: [stay informed and follow us on Google News!](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMI34nwwwk5-wBA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen) Klopp's treble chasers have already won the League Cup and face Atalanta in the Europa League quarter-finals as they eye a memorable farewell for the German in his last season. However, they will have to improve on this erratic display to hold off Arsenal and champions City, who are three points adrift of Liverpool. Liverpool head to Manchester United in the league on Sunday for a crucial clash with their bitter rivals. The Reds had to come from behind to beat Brighton last weekend, but [Klopp](https://sportsbrief.com/tags/jrgen-klopp/) insisted he was feeling \"calm\" as the title race approaches a dramatic climax. Even so, his heart must have been beating a little faster than usual when United almost snatched a shock lead. Netherlands crush Scotland in Euro warm-upFootball Jack Robinson's long throw reached the unmarked James McAtee in the area and on-loan Manchester City youngster's volley forced a reflex save from Caoimhin Kelleher. From the resulting corner, Ben Brereton Diaz almost tapped in at the far post as the Liverpool defence stood statuesque. United keeper Ivo Grbic handed Liverpool the lead in farcical fashion after 17 minutes. Needlessly taking far too long to clear on the edge of his area, Grbic was charged down by Nunez, the ball hitting the Uruguay striker on the backside as it rolled into the empty net. Grbic sheepishly plucked the ball from the back of the net as Nunez celebrated his 19th goal in all competitions this season. Joe Gomez, Mac Allister, Dominik Szoboszlai and Luis Diaz all went close from long-range as Liverpool threatened to deliver the knockout blow. But as torrential rain lashed down on Anfield, the floodgates refused to open as Liverpool's territorial dominance failed to yield a second goal before half-time. Colombia defeat disappointing Spain in friendlyFootball Bottom of the table United have won just three times during a dismal league campaign that looks certain to end with relegation. Yet they rocked Anfield to its foundations in the 58th minute. Gustavo Hamer's superb pass picked out McAtee on the right flank and he cleverly cut back inside before whipping a cross into the area. Hamer had carried on his burst forward and his close-range header beat Kelleher via a decisive deflection off Bradley's foot. Klopp responded by surprisingly hauling off [Salah](https://sportsbrief.com/football/players/62uembuj64oc4i0-mohamed-salah/) as Harvey Elliott came on for the Egypt forward, whose glum face and limp handshake with his manager betrayed his disappointment at the move. With the gesticulating Klopp growing frustrated with Liverpool's impotence, Andrew Robertson volleyed wide at the far post. But Klopp's angst was finally soothed in the 76th minute when Robertson's cross was only cleared to the edge of the area, where Mac Allister lashed a blistering strike into the top corner. Gakpo put the seal on Liverpool's hard-fought victory in the 90th minute as he stooped to head in Robertson's cross.",
