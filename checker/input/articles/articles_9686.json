    "text": "By Olivia Wilson Asher Redd ,\n6 hours ago\nUPDATE (3:31 p.m.): An “unknown substance” passed around campus sent two Accel Academy students to the hospital on Wednesday.\nThe two high school students were taken to the hospital at around 1:30 p.m. Wednesday, leaving the Mobile Police Department with the task of figuring out what the substance is and where it came from.\nThe police department described the scare as a “vaping incident.”\n“We have, we as any other school, we are anti-drugs, anti-vape anti and all that,” Accel Academy Marketing and Communications Director Victoria Lambert said. “We are anti cell phone.”\nThe two students, according to Lambert, suffered non-life-threatening injuries and are in stable condition.\n“Our No. 1 priority is to ensure that all of our students and staff are well taken care of and that they’re safe,” Lambert said. “Our due diligence is to our students and to our staff.”\nAbout 825 students are enrolled between the charter school system’s middle and high schools. All students, according to Lambert, are thoroughly searched each day as they come onto campus with a metal detector at the entrance of the school.\n“We do just make sure that each student comes in and they are de-weaponed and have nothing that could cause harm to another student or themselves,” Lambert said. “We are always looking to make sure we’re taking safety precautions for our students.”\nLambert said the police department is leading this investigation. Meanwhile, school staff will continue to be on the lookout for any suspicious activity among its students.\nNo arrests have been made. This remains an active investigation.\nMOBILE, Ala.

    "text": "Hyderabad: In a surprising move by a Muslim woman from Maharashtra, she has embarked on a 1,425-km walk to Ram temple in Ayodhya. Shabnam, a young hijab-clad Muslim woman from Mumbai, is currently traveling to Ayodhya with her friends Vineet Pandey and Raman Raj Sharma. They have been travelling 25–30 kilometers every day. The journey of the hijab-clad woman caught attention when they reached Sindhava in Madhya Pradesh. Shabnam said, “Being a good human being is more important than being a Hindu in order to worship Ram. When asked about the purpose of the trip, she responds: “Lord Rama belongs to everyone, irrespective of their caste or religion.” She also wants to dispel the “myth that only boys are capable of making such challenging expeditions.” Despite the difficulties she has faced, the police have taken steps to guarantee not only her safety but also her accommodation and meals. As she marches forward, carrying the saffron flag, she says that there is no set date for her to arrive in Ayodhya, dispelling claims that a meeting is scheduled for January 22. She says that this trip is her individual search of spiritual fulfillment and an example of dedication that cuts beyond social norms and religious bounds. Shabnam Shaikh has already become a social media sensation as she displays her ‘faith in Lord Ram’ through her various posts, describing her devotion and experiences through her journey to Ayodhya.",

    "text": "Dublin is a safe city when compared with others in the western world, the Taoiseach has insisted.\nLeo Varadkar said while it is important to acknowledge and listen to the experiences of those who have fallen victim to crime in Dublin, he insisted such incidents are not the norm for Ireland’s capital.\nThere has been an increased focus on safety in Dublin following a series of well publicised random attacks and assaults on people in the city.\nThat scrutiny intensified after the events of November 23, when rioting broke out in the city centre following a knife attack on three young children and their care assistant outside a primary school.\nTaoiseach Leo Varadkar made the comments during his end of year media briefing (Niall Carson/PA) Opposition parties claim a reduction in Garda numbers has contributed to a situation where parts of the city are no longer safe. It is a charge the Government has rejected.\nMr Varadkar was asked about the issue of safety in Dublin at his end of year media briefing with political journalists.\n“There’s no city that’s 100% safe,” he said.\n“If you look at something like the murder rate, for example, in Ireland or Dublin, compare that to other countries or other major cities, you’ll see that Dublin and Ireland are relatively safe relative to other countries and other cities in the western world.\n“But there’s no place that’s 100% safe and I acknowledge that. What I say to people is that we’re taking actions in all of these areas, increasing Garda numbers and Garda resources, making our laws tougher, with tougher sentences in particular, appointing more judges, expanding our prison places.\n“(There is) also a big focus now on community safety partnerships, because it can’t be all just about a law and order response. Other things are important too, including things like street lighting, like cameras, like engaging with different services around addiction and mental health and so on. That’s the approach that we’re taking.”\nA burned out bus is removed from O’Connell Street in Dublin in the aftermath of violent scenes in the city centre on November 23 (Brian Lawless/PA) Asked how he responded to accounts from individuals who have been assaulted in the capital, the Taoiseach added: “Of course I am concerned about individual negative experiences that people have in Dublin or anywhere else. That’s something you’re very aware of and very exposed to as a politician.\n“Somebody would have maybe a very bad experience of our health service. But I’m also aware of the counterfactual or the other sides of the story, if you’d like, the huge number of people who have a very positive experience of our health service, for example and say so when surveyed.\n“The same thing applies to people coming into town, coming into our cities and coming into our country.\n“Most people, thankfully, don’t experience being victims of violent crime in Dublin or anywhere else.\n“While it’s really important that we listen to and acknowledge the stories of people who have a very bad experience, we have a responsibility as politicians and journalists not to make the mistake of thinking that bad experiences are the majority or are the norm.”",

    "text": "El sindicato CGT alerta sobre la crisis que padece el sector “el incremento de la deslocalización a otros países y la precarización laboral, ya que muchas teleoperadoras, la gran mayoría son mujeres, están cobrando el Salario Mínimo Interprofesional (SMI). El convenio firmado el año pasado deja a la categoría más baja y la más común, la de teleoperadora, con un sueldo que acaba de llegar al SMI: 1.184 euros mensuales brutos en 14 pagas”.\nEl sindicato explica que “parte de la atención de Telefónica, tanto en Movistar como en O2, se está trasladando a Colombia, donde las trabajadoras cobran menos y tienen condiciones laborales aún más precarias que las ya de por sí existentes en el sector”.\nEste desmantelamiento se produce por parte de “grandes multinacionales, con beneficios millonarios, que disponen de plataformas de atención al cliente en terceros países a las que derivan las llamadas y gestiones que se venían realizando en ciudades como Zaragoza, simulando así una bajada de la carga de trabajo para poder promover un ERE o un ERTE”, denuncian.\nLa presidenta del comité de empresa de Abai, y miembro de la CGT, también denuncia que su empresa “está deslocalizando a Colombia los servicios que ofrece. Por las ofertas de trabajo que estamos viendo, está ofreciendo empleo, para los mismos servicios que nosotros realizamos, en un nuevo centro de llamadas en la localidad colombiana de Pereira, donde ofrecen 42 horas semanales cobrando dos tercios menos que nosotras, que estamos cobrando el SMI”, explica. Además, señala que “a nuestras trabajadoras les están sometiendo a estrés con la estrategia de que se vayan. En Zaragoza hemos perdido más de 500 puestos de trabajo en los últimos años, en León la empresa quiere aplicar una movilidad geográfica a Barcelona a 40 trabajadoras, en Madrid hay más de 120 personas en ERTE. ERTE que un juzgado ha declarado nulo recientemente, porque como defiende CGT no hay ninguna disminución de la carga de trabajo. La situación y la presión continua es insostenible”, recalca.\nAnte esta situación, CGT reclama “medidas urgentes para evitar las deslocalizaciones y la pérdida continuada de empleos en el sector de los centros de llamadas”.",

    "title": "Marruecos descubre la tecnología para los coches del futuro: no es hidrógeno, y ha paralizado al mundo",
    "text": "Marruecos ha descubierto la tecnología definitiva para los coches del futuro. Aunque el motor de hidrógeno está ganando un gran número de adeptos , esta vez se ha apostado por un combustible diferente. El avance exacerbado del cambio climático y el calentamiento global ha llevado a la humanidad a buscar vías alternativas para abastecerse de energía. Optar por la quema de combustibles fósiles ya no es una opción, puesto que es señalada como la principal razón de emisiones contaminantes.\nEn este contexto, han surgido opciones alternativas a las tradicionales como el uso de electricidad e hidrógeno. Respecto a este último, llama la atención su potencial para generar energía a través de sistemas limpios y ecológicos. Además, es posible implementarlo aprovechando la tecnología existente, un plus para muchos fabricantes.\nDebido al contexto contaminante que asola el mundo, varias naciones han establecido objetivos climáticos rígidos. Para cumplirlos sería necesario un drástico cambio en el uso de combustibles. Marruecos parece haber encontrado justo el que necesitaba.\nMarruecos tiene claro qué deben utilizar los coches del futuro Marruecos es la única salida para Stellantis debido a la falta de apoyo de Europa . El CEO de la compañía, Carlos Tavares , ha reconocido que tendrán que realizar una mayor inversión fuera de Europa para poder competir con los fabricantes chinos, y Marruecos y Turquía son los principales destinos de esta propuesta.\nLos fabricantes de vehículos en Europa buscan soluciones para afrontar la situación actual del sector, en el que resulta cada vez más difícil competir con los bajos precios de las firmas y los vehículos procedentes de Asia . Tavares ha enfatizado en varias oportunidades que producir fuera de Europa es la única salida que tienen sus firmas para hacer un recorte de gastos. Bajo estas circunstancias, Marruecos es uno de los países que proporciona mayores facilidades.\nBajar el precio final de los vehículos eléctricos, y en general de todos, es algo vital para poder responder a la ofensiva que llega de China . Hasta ahora, los fabricantes europeos han pedido ayuda a los legisladores, pero algunos consideran que ya es tarde para cambiar la realidad, puesto que compañías a la altura de BYD o MG ya controlan el mercado.\nEn China ya es innegable, pero no tardará mucho en ser algo palpable también en Europa si no se actúa pronto. Por eso en las últimas semanas Carlos Tavares ha avisado de que habrá modificaciones en sus proveedores y se realizarán más compras en Marruecos y Turquía , lugares donde el coste de fabricación y todo en general resulta más asequible.\nLos coches del futuro llegan de la mano de Marruecos Las instalaciones de Marruecos traerán piezas a las plantas europeas, como la ubicada en Vigo, España . En la actualidad, los fabricantes atraviesan una situación de inviabilidad de producción en territorio europeo, que obliga a prescindir de trabajadores cada cierto tiempo, razón por la que piden ayuda a los gobernantes europeos.\nUno de los inconvenientes con los que se topan las marcas en España es que el Gobierno ha prorrogado el Plan Moves III hasta final de año, pero sin escuchar los reclamos de ayudas directas y la eliminación del IVA para los vehículos eléctricos, algo que no sucederá. Aunque los incentivos podrían entregarse a la hora de la compra en la próxima edición de las ayudas para coches eléctricos en 2025, muchos consideran que para entonces será demasiado tarde.\nEn definitiva, Marruecos juega un papel fundamental en los coches del futuro (para muchos, vehículos eléctricos). Aunque las piezas electrificadas todavía tienen mucho que demostrar (debido a la falta de infraestructura y autonomía), queda claro que el mercado sigue apostando por ellas.",
