    "title": "Canadian judge says killer of Muslim family committed terrorism",
    "text": "A Canadian judge ruled on Thursday that actions of a man who was convicted of murder and attempted murder and deliberately drove his truck into five members of the Afzaal family in London, Ont., on June 6, 2021, amounted to terrorism under the law. Superior Court Justice Renee Pomerance told a packed courtroom, \"I have chosen not to name the offender nor share the hateful things he shared with police or in his manifesto. This is because his actions constitute terrorist activity.\" \"In fact, one could say this was a textbook case of terrorist activity.\" A jury in Windsor, Ont., found Nathaniel Veltman, 23, guilty of four counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder in November. Yumnah Afzaal, 15, her parents — Madiha Salman, 44, an engineer, and Salman Afzaal, 46, a physiotherapist — were killed, as was family matriarch Talat Afzaal, 74, a teacher and artist. The boy who survived was among dozens of people who gave victim impact statements in January during the first part of the sentencing. The murder convictions carry an automatic sentence of life in prison with no chance of parole for 25 years, but it was up to Pomerance to determine whether his actions constituted terrorism, based on the facts considered by the jury that convicted him. The judge also sentenced him to a concurrent life sentence for the attempted murder of the orphaned boy — defence lawyers had asked for 10 years. Relatives of the Afzaal family released a statement after the hearing. \"Today's sentencing has brought relief to people near and far,\" the statement said. \"We would like to thank the justice system, the Crown attorneys, the team of investigators, London police department support services, RCMP and media outlets for their efforts to bring justice to our loved ones. \"We would like to thank our family and friends along with the community of London, Windsor and the public at large for all their support during this difficult time.\" Pakistani rupee remains stable against US dollar and other currencies in the open market on February 22, 2024 (Thursday) In the open market, the US dollar was being quoted at 279.6 for buying and 282.4 for selling.

    "text": "Si è riunita oggi al Comune di Sinnai la Conferenza dei capigruppo per la convocazione del Consiglio comunale per parlare delle pale eoliche sul territorio di Sinnai: ne sono previste 14 con gravi danni per l'agricoltura, l'ambiente e per le aree archeologiche delle zone interessate. All’unanimità, i capigruppo hanno convocato il Consiglio comunale per il 26 agosto alle 16. Un dibattito aperto a tutti per esprimere la posizione di amministratori, associazioni, comitati, attività produttive interessate e cittadini sul tema “transizione energetica a quale costo?”.\n«Il consiglio», ha detto il presidente Massimiliano Mallocci, «sarà aperto all’intervento di coloro che vorranno portare un contributo nel ribadire il no alla speculazione energetica ai danni della Sardegna e del nostro territorio, per ribadire una posizione unitaria e forte a difesa del territorio di Sinnai. In questi giorni è iniziata la raccolta delle firme presso l’ufficio anagrafe del Palazzo Municipale, e da parte di Consiglieri e Assessori che volontariamente hanno scelto di supportare gli uffici nell’autenticazione delle firme. È prevista inoltre, un’apertura straordinaria dell’ufficio anagrafe nella frazione di Solanas, presso il Centro Ambientale, per la raccolta delle firme».\nLe preoccupazioni per i gravi danni paesaggistici ed economici che la realizzazione delle pale eoliche e piste di passaggio «potrebbero creare nel nostro territorio sono diverse», ha aggiunto Mallocci, «sono trasversali a tutti i partiti politici e cittadini, poiché creerebbe dei danni ambientali e forti disagi soprattutto al settore agricolo e turistico. Nel giro di pochi giorni i sinnaesi hanno già mostrato una forte sensibilità poiché sono già state raccolte oltre mille firme».\nSulla riunione di Consiglio i gruppi di minoranza Uniti per Sinnai e di Forza Italia hanno emesso un comunicato. «La conferenza dei capi gruppo», si legge, «ha accolto all'unanimità l'ordine del giorno presentato dai gruppi di Forza Italia e Uniti per Sinnai, che il 5 agosto avevano protocollato la richiesta di convocazione a firma di Walter Zucca e Roberta Simoni (Forza Italia), di Roberto Loi, Aurora Cappai, Paride Casula e Cosimo Lai (Uniti per Sinnai)».\n«Siamo molto preoccupati per questo progetto che pare inarrestabile», dice Walter Zucca, Ingegnere Ambientale di Forza Italia, «faremo la nostra parte sperando che qualcuno ascolti le nostre ragioni, che sono quelle di un intero territorio che è contrario alla deturpazione di un paesaggio che deve rimanere come l'abbiamo sempre conosciuto».\nRoberto Loi di \"Uniti per Sinnai\", dice che «bisogna assolutamente salvaguardare un territorio unico come quello di Sinnai e della Sardegna. Ci aspettiamo tanta gente e ci adopereremo per raccogliere quante più firme possibili per la Legge di iniziativa popolare Pratobello».\nRaffaele Serreli\n© Riproduzione riservata",

    "title": "Wedding.con review: A chilling, revealing documentation on matrimonial fraud | Web Series - Hindustan Times",
    "text": "'It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife,' wrote Jane Austen in the opening lines of Pride and Prejuduce. That was 1813. The tides have shifted now, for worse, in how the proposal of marriage turns out to be a web of lies and cheats. A chilling new show on Prime Video, a BBC Studios India production, Wedding.con- unpacks the way in which 5 women lost their hard-earned money because of the scams that operate on matrimonial sites. But it is more than just the loss of money, it is the loss of a voice: which reflects how a deeply sexist society leaves no chance to pinpoint the blame on women. (Also read: Best K-Dramas of 2023: From My Dearest to Twinkling Watermelon, how many have you watched?)The premiseHere, the women are in possession of a good fortune, and want of a partner. The five-episode series directed by Tanuja Chandra, sets out to tell the shocking real-life stories of five women (including a few who want to remain anonymous), who were cheated and betrayed by the men they met on these matrimonial sites. The first two episodes set out in forming the groundwork in introducing the women, and what lead them towards the search of a potential match on a matrimonial site. One of them is Priyanka- a single mother just out of a toxic marriage. She shows interest in Mark Bruce, stationed outside India as marine engineer. They develop a vulnerable and intimate relationship online. Another woman named Sneha matches with a guy named Rohan, who introduces himself in a strictly professional code. They meet over a casual chat at a café, and he seems direct about how he wants to take their bond forward. Their families meet. Even their marriage is fixed, when the suspicion begins to take shape.How the fraud worksAs the episodes unfold, Wedding.con becomes more interested in how elaborately these scams were planned and executed. As shocking and chilling these stories slowly transition into, the challenges arise in realising how easily these criminals get away with scams. The absence of adequate laws is one aspect the show briefly touches upon, selective in its approach. There are insights provided by Chitra Raghavan, a Central University of New York professor- who says that in these cases the scammer has already laid the trap in understanding what are the vulnerable points of these women. What are their insecurities? What do these women want? Even if doubt arises, these scammers are two steps ahead in dealing with those situations.Final thoughtsEditor Parikshhit Jha expertly pieces these details together into a narrative, directing our gaze from the initial stages of building trust and then breaking it at one go. The bits and pieces of information that these women share about themselves are juxtaposed with the warning signs and reflections. This is the India where marriage becomes such an overwhelming pressure on a woman that it robs her of agency and identity. Wedding.con could have benefitted with a more urgent questioning on this culture that enables these kinds of matrimonial frauds.The culture that is marked with endless shows, advertisements and content about marriage. As the show comes to its denouement, I longed to see a little more about the present lives, present relationships that these women share. Their social realities, while partaking in newer forms of womanhood. Perhaps the ground is uncompromising in that sort of examination of trauma- one that refuses to leave. Still, Wedding.con is an important and immersive documentation, one that gives a rare peek into a society that insists women tame themselves, and punishes them for taking any extra step.Entertainment!

    "title": "Annual review: UR women's hoops, women's lacrosse took strides in 2023",
    "text": "Women’s teams at the University of Richmond made the most notable progress in 2023.\nWomen’s basketball is off to a very promising start this season (10-3) in nonconference competition and opens A-10 play at George Washington Saturday. This is the growth fifth-year coach Aaron Roussell had in mind when the Spiders advanced to the 2023 WNIT (first postseason tournament since 2015), and won more than 20 games (first time since 2011-12).\n“I think there’s been a culture change over the last few years,” said 6-foot-2\nAddie Budnik, a four-year starter who averages 11.5 points and 4.7 rebounds.\nPeople are also reading…\nRoussell recognized WNIT inclusion as a “great reward” for last season’s team and said, “if you want to get maybe a little more dramatic about it, I think the last three years. I think this has been a build. Each year, we’ve gotten better.”\nIn the Spiders’ first 2024 A-10 home game, they host VCU (11-1) Wednesday at 6 p.m.\nWomen’s lacrosse in 2023 won the program’s first NCAA tournament game, beating Marquette 18-8 in the national tournament after capturing the A-10 championship. Richmond women’s lacrosse started in 1983.\n“The team, I think, was prepared coming into (the NCAA tournament) and wanting to make that history and wanting to do that for everybody who has come into this program before and laid the groundwork to get to this point,” said Coach Anne Harrington.\nRichmond was 0-5 in previous NCAA women’s lacrosse tournament opportunities.\nThe Spiders completed the 2023 regular season ranked No. 14 in the Inside Lacrosse/IWLCA Division I poll. They finished 17-4 (8-1 A-10), falling in the NCAAs 16-12 at North Carolina, which was ranked No. 3. Richmond opens at Campbell on Feb. 10.\nRichmond football started four different quarterbacks in four consecutive games because of injuries and ineffectiveness, and bounced back from a 2-3 start (including home losses to Morgan State, which finished 4-6, and Hampton, which finished 5-6) to make the FCS playoffs for the second straight year. UR shared the CAA Football championship with Albany and Villanova.\nKyle Wickersham, Cam Coleman, Jackson Hardy and Ashten Snelsire each got at least one start, and the Spiders defeated North Carolina Central 49-27 in the first round of the playoffs before falling at fifth-seeded Albany 41-13. Richmond won seven consecutive games prior to that season-ending loss.\nAfter the Albany game, senior linebacker Tristan Wheeler said, “everyone keeps coming to me, obviously everyone’s upset, emotional, crying, whatever it is. But that doesn’t take away the fact that we went from things not looking so positive and everyone counting us out to … winning a conference championship, and then winning a first-round playoff game.\n“There’s a lot to be proud of, a lot of things to be grateful for.”\nThe rapid development of men’s lacrosse since its 2014 launching continued with a 2023 championship in a third league. UR previously won Atlantic Sun and Southern Conference titles, and in 2023 captured the inaugural A-10 championship.\nThe Spiders (45-11 in league games) have played in nine straight conference championship games and advanced to the NCAA tournament in five of nine seasons.\n“I think the key is retaining guys who’ve done it from one year to the next,” said Dan Chemotti, coach since the program’s inception.\nThe Spiders continue to seek their first NCAA tournament victory. Richmond’s men and women have simultaneously advanced to the NCAA lacrosse tournaments three times, in 2018, 2019 and 2023.\nUR opens Feb. 3 against Maryland at Robins Stadium, where Virginia, Duke and Georgetown also visit in 2024.\nA 15-18 men's basketball season (7-11 A-10) was memorable for the absence of Coach Chris Mooney near its end. Mooney, 51, missed the final six games because of an aneurysm in his ascending aorta. That was addressed during a procedure that took place on Feb. 28 at the University of Virginia Medical Center. Mooney returned to most of his work responsibilities in late March.\nAssistant Peter Thomas, a former UR guard, was interim coach and led the Spiders to a 2-4 mark.\nIn June, Richmond baseball named Mik Aoki, a Davidson infielder from 1987 to 1990, coach. Aoki spent the last four seasons at Morehead State and previously was coach at Notre Dame, Boston College and Columbia. He succeeded Tracy Woodson, whose contract was not renewed after 10 years and a record of 238-245-2. UR has not been to the NCAAs in baseball since 2003.\nIn December, Richmond field hockey received new leadership, Martu Loncarica, after her three seasons as the coach at La Salle. UR parted ways with Coach Jamie Montgomery, a Collegiate graduate, after six years. The Spiders went 11-10 in 2019 and 4-3 during the spring season of 2021, but otherwise there were losing seasons under Montgomery.",
