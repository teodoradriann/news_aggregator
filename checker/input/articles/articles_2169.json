    "text": "A union that represents a few hundred employees at a GM assembly plant in Oshawa says that it will convene an “emergency meeting” today to prepare its response to a 25 per cent tariff that the U.S. plans to impose on imported vehicles.\nU.S. President Donald Trump announced the new tariff on Wednesday afternoon, though it will not formally take effect until April 3.\nAuto industry officials have warned that the levy will potentially have devastating consequences on the North American auto industry and could even prompt some assembly lines to stop production.\nThe impact could be particularly outside in Oshawa, where more than 3,000 employees work at a General Motors assembly plant.\nUnifor Local 222 represents more than 200 of those workers and is convening an emergency meeting with other union representatives today to discuss its response to the tariffs.\nWorkers are also expected to stage a rally outside the GM assembly plant to draw attention to their concerns.\nUnifor National President Lana Payne is expected to be among those in attendance.\n“We are calling everyone down here, we are having an emergency tariff meeting, we are going to go over our strategy and what we are going to do,” Local 222 President Jeff Gray told CP24 on Thursday morning. “They (GM) are not taking one piece of equipment out of our plants. We are going to react if that is the case.”\nTrump has said that the tariffs are designed to get auto manufacturers to relocate their plants to the U.S.\nHowever, GM and other manufacturers have not signalled any intentions to scale back their Canadian operations at this point.\nSpeaking with CP24, Gray called the tariffs “malicious” and “ignorant” of how the industry actually works, noting that vehicles and parts sometimes cross the border six to nine times before being assembled into a final product.\n“Our members we have gone through a little bit of a cycle in the last month. We have gone from being anxious and nervous to now I believe we are sick of being antagonized by Donald Trump,” he said. “These are our jobs. We fought for these jobs for the last 90 years here in Oshawa. We fought for them through collective bargaining and we paid financial and emotional prices. These jobs aren’t going anywhere.”\nThe Ontario government has previously said that more than 100,000 Ontarians are employed in the auto assembly and parts manufacturing sectors.\nIn a press conference on Wednesday, Premier Doug Ford told reporters that he supports “dollar for dollar” tariffs in response to the 25 per cent auto tariff.\nHe also said that he has encouraged Prime Minister Mark Carney to target American-made cars in any response.\n“We either roll over as a country and he (Trump) runs us over 15 times and gets what he wants, or we feel a little bit of pain and we fight like we’ve never fought before,” Ford said.",

    "text": "KP Sharma\nParo—While Bhutan is celebrated for its commitment to environmental conservation, the country is yet to fully capitalise on its extensive forest cover to engage with global carbon markets.\nEach year, Bhutan’s forests absorb millions tonnes of carbondioxide—a resource that remains largely underutilised due to current carbon accounting frameworks.\nThese frameworks often exclude natural carbon sequestration, which occurs without direct human intervention, from being classified as ‘additional’.\nMoreover, the carbon stored in Bhutan’s forests is not permanently sequestered, as natural decay could release it back into the atmosphere.\nA promising avenue for Bhutan lies in carbon-linked bonds, which could enable the country to monetise its environmental contributions.\nBob Litterman, chairman of climate policy and founding partner at Kepos Capital LP, proposed that Bhutan issue sustainability-linked bonds tied to specific environmental targets.\nHe explained that these bonds could function similarly to real return bonds used in the United States, where bonds are tied to inflation and protect investors from fluctuating rates.\nFor Bhutan, these bonds would be connected to carbon price movements, offering both the government and investors a clearer outlook on future carbon prices. “By creating a carbon price index similar to inflation indexes, Bhutan could attract investment in low-carbon solutions and encourage private sector participation,” he said.\nWhile he acknowledged the political challenges of taxing carbon, he said that doing so could create market expectations and incentives for carbon trading, ultimately enhancing Bhutan’s carbon market credibility.\nThe director of the Department of Environment and Climate Change, Sonam Tashi, said that Bhutan stands to gain from these bonds, but highlighted the challenge of securing sufficient financial resources.\nAlthough Bhutan’s constitution mandates environmental protection, the country has struggled to generate financial returns from this asset. “The government has estimated that USD 14 billion will be required for climate adaptation in the coming decades, including USD 1.4 billion over the next five years.”\nHe said that although Bhutan has already implemented green taxes on fuel and vehicles, there is a need for a robust legislative framework to support bond issuance and regulate carbon emissions from industries.\nThe chief economist at the Environmental Defence Fund, Suzi Kerr, highlighted the importance of shared resources in the carbon market, adding that Bhutan could benefit from speeding up its carbon-linked initiatives.\nHowever, she cautioned about the challenges carbon markets face, including inconsistent policies and fluctuating prices.\nSuzi Kerr called for concrete policies to protect Bhutan’s environment while keeping investors confident.\nThe CEO of Carbonbase, Max Song, acknowledged the technical challenges within the carbon market but urged Bhutan to take the lead in establishing a carbon market mechanism. “Bhutan has a unique opportunity to receive payments for its role in sequestering carbon on behalf of the world,” he said.\nHe suggested implementing incentives to encourage both companies and individuals to participate in conservation and regeneration efforts. “The government should efficiently allocate financial resources to attract more investment and foster sustainable development.”",
