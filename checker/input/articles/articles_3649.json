    "title": "Stalker 2 bugs are killing the A-life system right now, but GSC has a fix coming",
    "text": "If the world of Stalker feels more alive than some of its contemporaries, like Fallout, Starfield, or even GTA, it’s because of the A-life system. A mainstay of GSC’s apocalyptic shooter, in short, A-life governs the off-screen, ambient behaviour of NPCs and The Zone itself. If you were ever plodding through the elder Stalker games, and suddenly came upon two factions of survivors in a big gunfight with one another, it was because of A-life. If you’ve left a settlement, finished a mission, come back, and found your favorite character tragically dead, it was A-life. But so far, Stalker 2 ’s version of the system has been malfunctioning, and it ruins the atmosphere and tension of an otherwise great FPS. Responding to players’ observations, GSC now promises a fix.\nIn our own Stalker 2 review , Paul Kelly puts it best, calling the FPS game “extremely rewarding,” if you can put the technical issues aside. The world of Stalker 2 is still rich and convincing, and the combat is still suitably white knuckle, but problems with the A-life system and how it simulates off-screen behavior have caused some annoying anomalies, if you’ll excuse the pun.\nThe new version of A-life, dubbed A-life 2.0, is supposed to make The Zone feel more alive and organic. The idea is to give the impression that NPCs have their own rich inner lives and routines, but often, at the moment, the effect is the opposite. Enemies spawn suddenly in front of you. When you walk far enough away, NPCs involved in random events will stop what they’re doing and disappear. Rather than making the world of Stalker 2 more convincing, with the current version of A-life, you can see the cogs turning. But GSC is on the case.\nResponding to player feedback, GSC community manager ‘Mol1t’ says the studio “will fix” A-life 2.0. “A-life is supposed to make the Zone feel alive and real,” Mol1t explains “It is clear that at the moment it isn’t working. There are several known issues with the A-life 2.0 system that we are aware of and are working on fixes and improvements. We know that this system is very important to the Zone having an immersive atmosphere, and we will do our best to fix the known issues. We are fixing it and we will fix it.”\nIt’s early days for Stalker 2, and it’s likely that a lot of the game’s most severe technical problems will be remedied through upcoming patches. And even though there are some big glitches and bugs, the apocalypse game is doing tremendously well – of the 18,000 Stalker 2 user reviews posted on Steam, 80% are positive, and it just hit a concurrent player count high of 117,000.\nCheck the full Stalker 2 mission list , so you’re fully prepared before entering The Zone. Likewise, get tooled up with the best Stalker 2 weapons . You’re going to need them.\nYou can also follow us on Google News for daily PC games news, reviews, and guides, or grab our PCGN deals tracker to net yourself some bargains.",

Puede haber cortes de agua y ya sale turbia en varias zonas del Gran Mendoza.\nLa tormenta que afectó a una parte de Mendoza, principalmente a Luján de Cuyo, generó problemas en las plantas potabilizadoras y advirtieron que puede haber cortes de agua. Antes de eso, ya hay reportes de turbiedad en exceso en varias zonas del Gran Mendoza.\nLas lluvias generaron crecidas extraordinarias y arrastraron gran cantidad de sedimentos. Según informaron desde Aguas Mendocinas, en la zona de Agua de las Avispas y Potrerillos hubo un gran impacto, incluido en Río Blanco. Según aseguraron, las tormentas \"afectaron el normal abastecimiento a los Establecimientos Potabilizadores que proveen al Área Metropolitana, y posiblemente se vea resentido el servicio en algunas zonas\".\nEsa información general no incluyó especificaciones. Actualmente hay tareas preventivas en las plantas para evitar que haya ingreso de sedimentos en exceso. \"Se solicita hacer un uso sumamente responsable y solidario del agua potable, para que el servicio se afecte lo menos posible\", pidieron desde la empresa.\nLuján fue el departamento más afectado. En la zona de Lunlunta, Sur de Barrancas, La Isla, norte de calle La Legua, Rodríguez Peña, Los Barriales y Medrano cayó un promedio de 60 mm, con picos de 80 mm. En la zona del embalse Potrerillos, El Salto, Vallecitos, Ruta 7, río Mendoza precipitaron, en promedio, 50 mm de agua, lo que generó escorrentías fuertes en los arroyos. Vistalba, Mayor Drummond, Destilería de YPF, Dique Cipolletti también fueron afectados porque cayeron 45 mm y lo mismo ocurrió en Ugarteche, Agrelo y Perdriel.",

Une série de témoignages de gens qui se confient à Mikolaj Grynberg – cet écrivain et photographe de 57 ans a d’abord été psychologue – et racontent leurs difficultés à être juifs dans la Pologne d’hier et toujours dans la Pologne d’aujourd’hui. Quelqu’un lui dit : « Je pense que mieux vaut ne pas être juif. D’ailleurs, vous voyez bien que personne ne se précipite pour le devenir. Il n’y a pas de files d’attente. »\nVous le voyez d’emblée : le ton est laconique, caustique, sans pathos, sans mélo, sans larmes. Ce qui n’empêche pas l’émotion.

Now up to 11 goals and eight assists on the season, he is in the best form of his club career for the Italian side and forming a formidable attack alongside Rafael Leao . Playing like this, they could have a chance to win the entire Europa League with their dynamic attack coming to life.\nGolazo Starting XI Newsletter Get your Soccer Fix from Around the Globe Your ultimate guide to the Beautiful Game as our experts take you beyond the pitch and around the globe with news that matters.\nI agree to receive the \"Golazo Starting XI Newsletter\" and marketing communications, updates, special offers (including partner offers), and other information from CBS Sports and the Paramount family of companies.

Already tying his career-high in goals this season, the move to Milan from Chelsea during the summer couldn't have worked out much better for Pulisic than it has.\nRight foot. Left foot. Back of the net! ⚽\nChristian Pulisic has his third goal in as many games for Milan 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/s0e0irykkh\n— CBS Sports Golazo ⚽️ (@CBSSportsGolazo) March 14, 2024 He did go through a bit of a cold streak during the start of 2024, but Pulisic has rebounded and scored in three straight games for the first time in his career. Milan will have wanted to do better in league play where they're second (trailing Inter by a whopping 16 points) but progressing in the Europa League will at least give them a major objective to hang their hats on this season.\nPulisic will soon find out his opponent for the final eight of the tournament with the draw being held on Friday . Pulisic is also in form at a good time for the United States as they'll look to retain their Concacaf Nations League title beginning with a match against Jamaica on March 21. Win that and they'll be in the final but to make it through the tournament, Gregg Berhalter and the USMNT will need Pulisic to keep scoring just like he's doing in Italy.\nOur Latest Soccer Stories Man United top Liverpool in FA Cup classic James Benge • 6 min read Chelsea survive FA Cup scare to advance to semis James Benge • 2 min read Suarez delivers in Messi's absence Chuck Booth • 3 min read Haji Wright winner sends Coventry City to FA Cup semis Chuck Booth • 1 min read In year three, MLS Next Pro gets its moment to shine Chuck Booth • 6 min read UCL quarterfinal matchups set; NWSL set for kickoff Jonathan Johnson • 6 min read Watch Now: WATCH: Pulisic scores again for Milan Chuck Booth 1 min read Suarez delivers in Messi's absence Chuck Booth 3 min read Pfeiffer makes NWSL history Sandra Herrera 1 min read SGOTUS Emhoff talks equal pay at Challenge Cup Pardeep Cattry 2 min read Haji Wright sends Coventry City to FA Cup semifinals Chuck Booth 1 min read Corner Picks: How to bet Inter and Napoli's sad-fest Tom Fornelli 4 min read NWSL Power Rankings: Gotham start on top Sandra Herrera 5 min read Europa League draw results: Liverpool-Atalanta James Benge 2 min read Chelsea survive FA Cup scare to advance to semis James Benge 2 min read Insider notes: PL clubs after McKennie Roger Gonzalez 2 min read",

    "title": "The Path To Peace: ULFA's Journey From Insurgency To Accord",
    "text": "Peace treaty is led by the pro-talk faction of ULFA On December 29, 2023, a significant chapter in the turbulent history of Assam and India is poised to be written. The Indian government, the Assam government, and the United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA) are expected to sign a peace treaty, marking a potential end to decades of conflict and insurgency. This momentous occasion follows a series of failed negotiations and a tumultuous history marked by violence, extortion, and political upheaval. The catalyst for ULFA's branding as a banned terrorist organisation was the killing of Surendra Paul, a prominent tea planter and brother of Lord Swraj Paul, and the subsequent extortion and threats to tea estate owners. These events exerted international pressure on the Indian government, leading to decisive action against ULFA. Founded on April 7, 1979, in Sivasagar, Assam, ULFA emerged with the objective of establishing an independent sovereign state for the indigenous Assamese people. The group began its armed operations in the late 1980s, led by figures such as Paresh Baruah, Arabinda Rajkhowa, and Anup Chetia. Initially perceived as a group aiding the needy and the poor, ULFA's tactics soon escalated to armed struggle against the Indian government. The assassination of Surendra Paul in May 1990 was a critical juncture. This high-profile killing, along with the forced evacuation of Lipton personnel and their families after Unilever's refusal to pay \"taxes\" to ULFA, garnered international attention and compelled the Indian government to take stringent measures against the group. The high-profile assassination led to the President's rule being imposed in Assam; the Prafulla Kumar Mahanta-led Asom Gana Parishad government was dismissed by the Centre, the ULFA was banned, and \"Operation Bajrang\" was launched by the army. A defining moment in ULFA's history occurred on July 1, 1991, when ULFA cadres abducted 14 people, including an engineer from the erstwhile USSR. This incident, coupled with the group's interference in the tea and oil industries - vital economic sectors in Assam - marked a significant escalation in their activities. The Indian Army then launched \"Operation Rhino\". The operation was called off after ULFA agreed to talk with the government in 1992. Following these events, ULFA's activities intensified, including kidnappings, attacks on government officials, and targeting of security personnel. The group's operations extended beyond Assam, with cadres reportedly receiving training in countries like China and Pakistan. The organisation's influence was such that it ran a parallel government in Assam, challenging the authority of the state. The peace treaty of December 2023, led by the pro-talk faction of ULFA, includes key players from the Indian government and the ULFA leadership. The treaty aims to address issues such as illegal immigration, land rights for indigenous communities, and a financial package for Assam's development. Notably, the ULFA (Independent) faction led by Paresh Baruah remains opposed to the talks. In later years, ULFA saw significant shifts in its operations and ideology. Following key arrests and surrenders, including the capture of vice-chairman Pradip Gogoi in 1994 and general secretary Anup Chetia in 1998, ULFA's activities were notably impacted. The group faced internal divisions, leading to a major split in 2012 when Paresh Barua formed the ULFA (Independent) faction, insisting on sovereignty discussions. Despite these challenges, the pro-talk faction of ULFA, led by figures like Arabinda Rajkhowa, showed a willingness to engage in peace dialogues with the Indian government. This culminated in the historic peace deal signed on December 29, 2023, marking a potential end to decades of insurgency and conflict in Assam. This agreement, a result of prolonged negotiations and changing dynamics within ULFA, represents a significant step towards restoring peace in the region.
