    "text": "近期 永杉锂业 （ 603399 ）发布2024年年报，证券之星财报模型分析如下：\n　　 经营概况\n　　永杉锂业在2024年的营业总收入为58.95亿元，同比下降21.45%。尽管收入有所下降，但公司实现了扭亏为盈，归母净利润达到2542.16万元，同比上升107.54%。扣非净利润为-7662.72万元，同比上升78.84%。毛利率为3.6%，同比增加了13.61%，净利率为0.54%，同比增加了110.97%。\n　　 现金流状况\n　　公司的现金流状况不容乐观。每股经营性现金流为-0.21元，同比减少了110.58%。经营活动产生的现金流量净额变动幅度为-110.52%，主要原因是报告期内收回的期初应收款较上年同期大幅减少以及报告期末收到的预收款项减少。\n　　 债务状况\n　　截至报告期末，公司的有息负债为8.01亿元，同比增加了17.71%。有息资产负债率已达23.11%，表明公司债务负担有所加重。此外，货币资金为6.15亿元，同比减少了46.65%，主要是由于回购股票及购买子公司少数股东股权、支付材料购买款项及工程建设投入。\n　　 主营业务分析\n　　 锂盐业务\n　　锂盐业务实现营业收入10.15亿元，占总收入的17.21%，毛利率为13.69%。2024年全球锂盐市场供需再平衡，价格波动较大。公司采取“高周转，保交付”策略应对市场风险。\n　　 钼业务\n　　钼业务实现收入48.67亿元，占总收入的82.55%，毛利率为1.42%。钼业务供需结构调整，价格波动剧烈。国内钼矿山面临品位下滑、新矿开发缓慢的问题，钼精矿生产总量增速放缓。\n　　 财务健康度\n　　公司的现金资产较为健康，但应收账款状况值得关注。应收账款为2.77亿元，占利润的比例高达1090.05%，表明公司可能存在较大的应收账款回收风险。\n　　 发展前景\n　　公司未来将继续抓住新能源行业发展机遇，集中优势资源推动锂盐业务高质量发展，稳步推进钼产品业务。在锂盐业务上，公司将积极推进大矿企战略，确保锂矿石来源稳定可靠，并深化与正极材料领域头部企业的合作。在钼业务领域，公司将继续秉持“以效益为中心”的发展思路，重视产品质量提升，探索节能降耗路径，提升生产效益。\n　　 总结\n　　永杉锂业在2024年实现了扭亏为盈，但现金流和债务状况需引起关注。公司应继续优化现金流管理，加强应收账款的回收力度，同时合理控制债务规模，确保公司稳健发展。",

    "text": "Taunton second-year head coach has girls basketball team heading in right direction [Steven Sanchez](https://www.heraldnews.com/staff/3682426001/steven-sanchez/) TAUNTON — As a basketball player for New Bedford High School, [Gretchen Rodrigues](/story/sports/high-school/basketball/2022/12/12/gretchen-rodrigues-new-bedford-taunton-girls-basketball-coach/69713842007/) was best known for her scoring, grit and determination on the court. Now in her second season as head coach for [Taunton High](https://highschool.tauntonschools.org/), the 2003 Whaler graduate has caught the eyes of opposing coaches. \"I've told [Gretchen] before this game that this is the most athletic team I've seen Taunton has ever had in the last three years,\" said Durfee head coach Jeff Caron said after the Hilltoppers lost their first of the season on Thursday, 53-50. \"All five players on the floor are pretty athletic. They're a lot quicker than before and they can run that press effectively this year because of personal.\" Rodrigues, who is the all-time leading scorer at New Bedford with 1,391 points, said it's all about the buy-in. The Tigers improve to 5-0 and has averaged close to 64 points per game through four contest before the matchup with Durfee. It's the best start for Taunton since the 2006-07 team when the Tigers won four straight to open the season. \"We're definitely a year older,\" she said. \"The [girls] are believing and everyone has confidence in one another. They are buying into my system and playing hard. Now moving forward, it is easier for the girls. We believe that we can win.\" Seniors Cali Melo and Jillian Doherty said there has been a big difference since Rodrigues was hired by Taunton athletic director Mark Ottavianelli in October 2022. \"Not losing any players and being able to have one more year [along] with a connection,\" said Melo, who finished with 12 points said. \"I think coach coming in changed the pace on how we play. No hate for the coach we had before. Now we are more fast pace.\" Doherty said the team is definietly buying in. \"The effort is so much higher and we want it so much more this year,\" said Doherty who finished with a team-high 17 points. \"Coach has been saying this for a year now and now we're doing it. We can see that she was right all this time. It's nice to see all the hard work in the offseason has finally paid off. Last season, the Tigers started out 3-0 before losing to the Hilltoppers in the Taunton Holiday Classic. Now 5-0, could you imagine? \"No,\" Rodrigues said. \"We beat a real good team today. Durfee is good. I can imagine this but now these girls believe.\" How it happened Taunton got off to fast start, scoring the first 13 points of the game to jump out to a 19-8 lead. The Tigers cooled off in the second quarter and Durfee closed the margin to just two at 22-20. But Taunton maintain the lead at halftime, 25-20. In the third quarter, Taunton started strong before the Hilltoppers made a late run as the visitors trail 43-35 with a final quarter remaining. The Tigers never trailed in the game. \"It was good that we responded and did not let that deficit get us down,\" Caron said. \"But we were chasing the whole game. Even when we got closer, they pulled away. Taunton did a great job in moving the basketball. They played a cleaner game than we did and they out-toughed us to loose balls. We just got beat.\" Breakout game Sophomore Maddie Hargraves had a game to remember for Durfee. After scoring just four points in the first half, the Hilltopper guard netted 23 points in the second half to keep the Hilltoppers alive. She basically put the team on her shoulder after her' older sister, Julia, fouled out for the first time in her career in the fourth and center Mya Hayes-Paulette went down with an injury in the third quarter. Maddie Hargraves finished with a career-high 27 points. \"We were swimming up stream right off the bat,\" Caron said. \"You can't expect so many things that happen and win the game. Maddie [Hargraves] is really good in a transition type-game like this. She is such a good athlete so that's what she capable of. She is compeitive that is what you seen there.\" Other scorers in the game for Taunton were Taryn Campbell with 11 and Lexi Haywood added nine in the win. Hayes-Paulette contributed 16 points and Maggie O'Connell chipped in with five points for the Hilltoppers.
