    "title": "Twin Winter Storms to Unleash Snow, Wind, Floods Across Northern U.S.",
    "text": "Two formidable winter storms are set to sweep through many parts of the northern United States, starting this Friday and continuing into next week. These storms are anticipated to deliver a significant mix of heavy snow, strong winds, severe thunderstorms, and flash flooding, affecting millions of residents across the region. With winter alerts already in place for 32 million people, the approaching weather conditions highlight a critical period of preparation and caution for those in the storms' paths.\nAdvertisment Storm One: Swift and Snowy The first of the two storms is expected to move quickly, bringing snowfall to eastern Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan by Friday, and reaching the interior Northeast and New England by Saturday. Light to moderate snow, amounting to 2 to 7 inches, will blanket an area stretching from the Upper Midwest to the Great Lakes overnight. Northern New England is bracing for even heavier snowfall, with predictions of 12 to 18 inches by Saturday night. This initial storm underscores the need for readiness among communities, as it sets the stage for a challenging weekend of winter weather.\nStorm Two: Intensifying Impact Advertisment The second storm, starting Sunday, is forecasted to bring more significant snow accumulations and stronger winds to the Upper Midwest than its predecessor, particularly impacting North and South Dakota, Minnesota, and northern Wisconsin. By Monday, the storm is expected to slow and strengthen over the Upper Midwest, continuing to unleash continuous snow and strong wind gusts across the Dakotas and Minnesota until at least midday Tuesday. Snow accumulations could reach 12 to 18 inches in parts of Minnesota, including the Minneapolis metro area and Duluth. This storm could transform parts of the Dakotas and western Minnesota into a 'blizzard alley,' with winds forecasted to reach 35 to 40 mph, potentially creating blizzard conditions, especially on Monday and Tuesday.\nFlood Risks in Southern Regions While the northern U.S. braces for snow and wind, southern Florida and New England are facing flood watches, with 53 million people at risk. In south Florida, up to 7 inches of rain could fall on Friday, accompanied by severe thunderstorms and the possibility of isolated tornadoes, particularly in the Florida Keys. By Saturday, the flood risk shifts to southern New England, where a widespread 2 to 4 inches of rain is anticipated, including along the Interstate 95 corridor. These conditions highlight the extensive impact of the twin storms, affecting a broad swath of the U.S. from heavy snowfall and blizzards in the north to severe flooding and thunderstorms in the south.\nAs these two winter storms approach, communities across the northern U.S. are urged to prepare for a range of severe weather conditions. From significant snow accumulations and potential blizzards to widespread flooding and severe thunderstorms, the impact of these storms will be felt across multiple states. The convergence of these weather events underscores the unpredictable nature of winter weather and the importance of staying informed and prepared.",

    "title": "News industry off to brutal 2024 start as mass layoffs devastate publishers, raising questions about the future of journalism | CNN Business",
    "text": "The news industry is enduring a brutal start to the new year, with outlets large and small across the country hemorrhaging reporting staff as legacy business models that kept much of the industry afloat for decades collapse in plain sight. The rapid contraction, coming even as the presidential election cycle heats up and public attention and revenues historically mount, has been on full display this month, with the first few weeks of 2024 ushering in a spate of painful layoffs at news organizations from coast-to-coast. The Los Angeles Times slashed its newsroom by more than 20% earlier this week; TIME cut dozens of staffers; and Business Insider said it would trim its workforce by 8%. Meanwhile, hundreds of staffers at Condé Nast, Forbes, The New York Daily News, and others staged historic walkouts to protest planned cuts at the outlets. The recent round of layoffs, while pronounced, are part of a much larger and unrelenting storm battering the journalism industry. Over the past 18 months, most news organizations have been forced to make difficult decisions to reduce their workforces. At the national level, CNN, The Washington Post, NPR, Vice Media, Sports Illustrated, Vox Media, NBC News, CNBC, and other organizations have cut swaths of their reporting staff. At the local level, layoffs have been nearly constant, with newspaper giant Gannett cutting hundreds of employees, and small outlets carving out already lean operations. The latest round of layoffs come after 2023 marked the worst year for job cuts in the journalism sector since Covid-19 upended the world in 2020, with roughly 2,700 jobs eliminated. While each outlet is struggling with its own unique challenges, they all are facing brutal industry headwinds ushered in by the internet revolution and other technological advances that have fundamentally changed the way the public consumes news and entertainment. Audiences that once reliably surfed traditional cable channels and consumed news websites or newspapers are instead absorbing content and spending time on platforms such as TikTok and Netflix, leading to massive declines in ratings and traffic. That shift in behavior has led brands to spend their marketing in emerging digital arenas, particularly given their ability to offer advertisers powerful tools to target audiences with precision. Making matters worse, news outlets have seen their online advertising businesses vanish as social media and search giants devour much of the industry’s dollars. Research produced by Columbia University in October estimated that technology titans Google and Meta should pay news outlets $14 billion per year in revenue for their search traffic and content, a figure it [described](https://policydialogue.org/files/publications/papers/USE-THIS-2023.10.28_Paying-for-News_Clean-2.pdf) as “conservative.” But technology companies have resisted paying publishers for their content and launched high-profile fights to block legislation intended to recoup some of the lost revenue. “The ad industry doesn’t need the news industry when there are so many other ways to purchase attention, and so many better ways to target users,” Jay Rosen, an associate professor of journalism at New York University, told CNN. The change in behavior has also meant news consumers are canceling subscriptions to newspapers and cable providers, cutting precious revenues even further. “I am sorry to say that I do not see turning around most legacy outlets,” Jeff Jarvis, the Leonard Tow Professor of Journalism Innovation at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism, told CNN. “Their proprietors, with few exceptions, did not adapt to the internet. They held onto their old business models — advertising, subscription, and the attention economy.” “Many of them are now controlled by hedge funds, which will not invest or innovate,” Jarvis said, adding that cost-cutting is the “predictable response to a worsening downward business spiral,” which “will make the products of these publications only worse, which will accelerate the spiral.” “The death of newspapers — and magazines and linear TV — has been oft-foretold and has not yet occurred,” Jarvis said. “The fall might be coming now.” The hollowing out of large news institutions comes at a perilous time for America. Antidemocratic candidates have intentionally worked to undermine faith in news outlets as they look to seize power in election contests from coast to coast, attacking those tasked with the duty of holding public officials accountable. “To say that trust in the news media has declined is correct, but too vague,” Rosen said. “The reality is that destroying confidence in the practice and products of journalism is a potent and successful political strategy, as with Steve Bannon’s ‘flood the zone.’” That lack of accountability means dishonest figures seeking higher office, and those in positions of power, could avoid crucial scrutiny, leaving the electorate less informed about the vital decisions it will have to make in November at the ballot box. Margaret Sullivan, a columnist at The Guardian who previously wrote about media for The Washington Post and The New York Times, told CNN in December that she is worried about the larger consequences the deeper cuts in the news business will have on the country. Sullivan said that it is not only “heartbreaking to see the loss of these jobs,” but warned the action will do “damage to society.” “The loss of journalists contributes to the exponential growth of news deserts in large swaths of the nation — and that’s disastrous when misinformation is rampant,” Sullivan said. “Democracy needs an informed electorate in order to function and that is tragically dwindling in many regions.” For a time, there had been hope that billionaire ownership of news publications could offer stability to the industry as it wears off legacy business models. Recent months, however, have cast doubt on that optimism, with Jeff Bezos’ Washington Post and Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong’s Los Angeles Times making significant cuts to their newsrooms. But despite the widespread gloom, there are some encouraging signs popping up across the industry. Dan Kennedy, a journalism professor at Northeastern University, noted some local news outlets have found financial sustainability. “Billionaire newspaper ownership is coming under fire lately because of Soon-Shiong’s fecklessness and because Jeff Bezos has hit a few bumps with the Post, although I think that will prove to be temporary,” Kennedy told CNN, pointing to recent successes at The Minneapolis Star Tribune and The Boston Globe newspapers. “There are reasons to be optimistic given the hundreds of independent local news organizations that have sprouted up in recent years,” he said. “The challenge is that coverage at the hyperlocal level is hit or miss, as some communities are well-served and others — especially in rural areas and in urban communities of color — tend to be overlooked.” But Rosen cautioned against the reliance on deep-pocketed philanthropists to sustain journalistic enterprises in the long-term. “Journalists have to take it upon themselves to treat sustainability as their problem, but this is not what they signed up for,” he said. “They signed up to do stories.”",

JULIET, Tenn. (WKRN) — Tense moments inside a classroom at Green Hill High School in Mt. Juliet. A student started choking on a bottlecap, and the school nurse rushed to the classroom to do the Heimlich maneuver.\nMoments before that, school resource officer Corporal Chase Dillard sensed something was wrong, even though he hadn’t been called.\nCPR training essential to saving lives in a crisis\n“I noticed the nurse going up the staircase, and it looked like kind of an emergency situation,” Corporal Dillard said.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement He followed to see if she needed help, and she did when her attempts to dislodge the object weren’t working.\n“It’s just second nature. I just jumped in and was able to dislodge it,” Corporal Dillard said. “Once we got it up, and they knew that the kid was gonna be okay, it was like a sigh of relief.”\nThe entire incident, which happened in May of 2022, was caught on a camera inside the classroom. Corporal Dillard said the father of the student reached out to him to thank him for saving his son’s life, but he said it’s all part of the job.\nWhen Seconds Count: How to help someone who is choking\n“Got to be aware and be on your p’s and q’s at all times, because you never know what’s going to happen,” Corporal Dillard said. “It’s kind of the nature of law enforcement. You don’t know from day to day what’s going to happen, so what your day might entail. When you get in situations like that, you just kind of revert back to your training, and you go for it.”\nAdvertisement Advertisement Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

    "title": "El Gobierno de EEUU amenaza con presentar demanda contra ley antiinmigrante SB4 de Texas",
    "text": "Los Ángeles, 28 dic (EFE).- El Departamento de Justicia (DOJ) del Gobierno estadounidense advirtió este jueves al gobernador de Texas, el republicano Greg Abbott, que presentará una demanda si el estado avanza hacia la aplicación de la ley SB4, que otorga a autoridades estatales el poder de expulsar a migrantes del país, reportó el periódico Houston Chronicle.\nEn una carta al gobernador obtenida por el diario, el vicefiscal general Brian Boynton indicó que la ley, que Abbott firmó el 18 de diciembre, “es inconstitucional y obstaculizará las operaciones del Gobierno federal para aplicar la ley de inmigración”.\nLa misiva indica que si Abbott no confirma para el 3 de enero que el estado se abstendrá de aplicar la SB4, “Estados Unidos recurrirá a todos los remedios legales apropiados para asegurar que Texas no interfiera con las funciones del Gobierno federal”.\nLa ley, aprobada por la Legislatura texana en noviembre y cuya entrada en vigor se prevé para marzo, convierte en delito menor el que un extranjero \"ingrese o intente ingresar al estado desde una nación extranjera\" de forma irregular. La falta se convierte en un crimen grave, punible hasta con 20 años de prisión, si el infractor es reincidente.\nLa SB4 permite a la justicia estatal ordenar la expulsión de personas sin mediar proceso judicial. Asimismo, los oficiales de policía podrán arrestar a cualquier individuo del que sospechen que ingresó ilegalmente al país, y tendrán la facultad discrecional de expulsarlo a México en vez de arrestarlo.\nConsiderada una de las leyes antiinmigrantes más estrictas en la historia estadounidense, la SB4 se suma a otras medidas que Abbott ha instrumentado como parte de su Operación Estrella Solitaria contra la inmigración irregular, a la que han sido asignados más de 11.000 millones de dólares desde 2021 y que ha incluido la colocación de un cerco de alambre de púas y una barrera de boyas en el fronterizo Río Grande (Río Bravo en México).\nUn día después de la firma de la SB4, el presidente de México, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, calificó a Abbott de \"señor de malas entrañas\" por sus políticas migratorias y anunció que impugnará la ley.\n\"Se está haciendo ya un trámite en (la Secretaría de) Relaciones Exteriores para impugnar esta ley y, además, nosotros vamos a estar siempre en contra de estas medidas. (Quiero) decirles a nuestros paisanos y a los migrantes que vamos a estarlos defendiendo”, dijo en conferencia de prensa.\nAsimismo, la Unión Estadounidense de Libertades Civiles (ACLU) de Texas y el Proyecto de Derechos Civiles de Texas (TCRP) presentaron el 19 de diciembre ante la Corte Federal del Distrito Oeste de Texas una demanda contra la SB4, argumentando que es inconstitucional porque viola la Cláusula de Supremacía de la Constitución de Estados Unidos.
