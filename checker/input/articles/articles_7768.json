    "text": "Su-30MKI Fighter Fleet's Life To Be Extended By 20 Years; Jets To Get Advanced Weapons Indian Air Force is also working to equip the combat aircraft with modern technologies including indigenous advanced radars, avionics and weapon systems. Trending Photos Amit the dual threat from China and Pakistan and now with the drones targetting ships in the Arabian Sea, the Indian Air Force is working to enhance its capabilities. The IAF is now working to extend the service life of its Russian-origin combat aircraft Sukhoi-30 MKI by over 20 years. India inducted the Sukhoi-30 MKI about two decades ago. The Indian Air Force has around 272 jets operating in its fleet and Su-30 MKI are going to be the mainstay of the force for at least the next 15-20 years. Indian Air Force is also working to equip the combat aircraft with modern technologies including indigenous advanced radars, avionics and weapon systems. It is working to upgrade its fleet of Sukohi-30 MKI fighters with indigenous weapon systems and radar named Virupaaksha. \"Virupaaksha radar is being developed indigenously, keeping in view the requirements of IAF in different sectors and would be the most advanced one among all the Sukohi-30 variants being flown around the globe,\" reported ANI citing defence sources. The Indian Air Force has been working on a mission mode to indigenize the equipment in its inventory and looking to buy equipment from Indian firms worth over Rs three lakh crore in the near future. The Su-30MKI is a multi-role air dominance fighter that can carry a versatile array of weapons including the Astra Mk-1 long-range air-to-air missile, Brahmos Air Launched missile, and an array of bombs, among others. The Air Force has already flight-tested the Air-to-Air missile, ASTRA, from Sukhoi-20 MKI. The IAF also successfully test-fired Rudram Anti-Radiation Missile from Sukhoi-30 fighter aircraft. The IAF has already got 36 Rafale fighter jets in its fleet but that remains a meager number given the threats that India faces. Indian Air Force is also in the process to acquire 97 Tejas light combat jets to boost its defence capabilities amid the looming retirement of MiG-21, MiG-23 fleet. Live Tv",

    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO -- For 30 years, the Boulevard restaurant has served quintessentially Californian cuisine in San Francisco. Owner and Chef Nancy Oakes opened Boulevard in 1993 in the historic Audiffred building on the Embarcadero waterfront. \"I am shocked that it's 30 years. I really am,\" expressed Oakes. \"It sounds crazy, but I've really loved being here.\" \"There's sort of an opulence,\" the Boulevard's Executive Chef Dana Younkin adds. \"And then a lot of care, and curation of ingredients. But also, just like hospitality, just a really warm and fun environment to be in.\" Nancy is knows as a pioneering American chef and mentor. She's kept the Boulevard menu fresh and creative. \"I don't know if people really think the food has changed very much, but it has changed radically,\" explained Oakes. \"I would get very bored if I didn't also try to learn new things and experiment with them and bring them in.\" The menu is bursting with carefully curated flavors and of course, San Francisco seafood. \"It's a very collaborative kitchen,\" said Younkin. \"Everybody has to care along the way to make something awesome, because, you know, chef can come up with the idea, but like day in, day out the team is holding that, bringing it through to the guest.\" Oakes adds, \"When they come in. And they tell you...we got engaged here. And we met, we've been married 20 years, and we celebrate every anniversary here. And I mean, that's becoming a part of somebody's life. And you have to look at it as an honor.\" For more information, visit here .",

    "title": "Here's What The Worst Critic Reviews Said About Marvel's The Avengers",
    "text": "Here's What The Worst Critic Reviews Said About Marvel's The Avengers\nAt this late date, in the year 2024, one might be curious to know what the general public thinks of Joss Whedon's 2012 blockbuster\n\"Marvel's The Avengers.\" When it was released, it was an event unlike anything that came before. Thanks to a novel release schedule by Marvel Studios, several solo superhero flicks preceded \"The Avengers,\" setting up each of the individual characters as autonomous entities before their inevitable team-up. When the team-up finally struck, audiences went mad, granting \"The Avengers\" a $207 million opening weekend, and a cumulative worldwide gross of $1.5 billion. The success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe altered film journalism for a decade, keeping enthusiasm for the series at a constant high boil. Many assumed that the superhero genre was peerless, untouchable, and eternal.\nIn 2024, the MCU has faltered, interest has fallen, and superheroes are limping out the door. What's more, Joss Whedon\nhas been repeatedly ousted as abusive and inappropriate, effectively shedding the passionate cult that once surrounded him. Given that we are no longer locked into a cycle of bottomless anticipation, will audiences still react as enthusiastically to \"The Avengers,\" or will they simply remark on it as a relic of the 2010s?\nWhen \"The Avengers\" first came out, not all reviews were kind. Most of them were — the film has 91% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes — but 33 RT-approved critics gave the film an effective \"thumbs down,\" standing contrary to popular opinion. Indeed, critics writing for such outlets as the New York Times, and the Wall Street Journal were dispassionate or sour toward Whedon's ultra-team-up film.\nHere's was some of the more critical reviews, vintage 2012, had to say about \"The Avengers.\"\nI gave The Avengers a 6/10\nIn the interest of full disclosure,\nI include myself. My own review is listed as one of the negative reviews listed on Rotten Tomatoes. In 2012, I was writing for a now-defunct website called CraveOnline, and my review accrued a great deal of hatred from the world's many \"Avengers\" fans merely because I gave it a 6 out of 10.\nI felt — and still feel — that \"The Avengers\" is essentially the Platonic ideal of a Saturday morning cartoon ... carrying with it all of the positives and negatives in that statement. It terms of little-kid-style thrills, \"The Avengers\" is first-rate. It's slickly made and features a wide panoply of superhero action. Each character gets to interact, fight, and display their superpowers in equal measure, and the glory shots of all the costumed vigilantes gearing up for an alien invasion is everything an 8-year-old might want.\nBut after using several years and multiple films to set up a team-up movie, it was massively disappointing that the superheroes didn't do anything more than, well, mere superhero stuff. One would assume that a project of this size, requiring the money and logistics that it did, would have something novel to say about superherodom. That it would deconstruct heroism, kill a character, comment on the morals of vigilantism, or do something — anything! — that couldn't be found on a comic book page. It merely repeated another medium. It felt like a cover song.\nUltimately, \"The Avengers\" was a movie about very little, leaving its ambitions feel slight and paltry. It was about ... teamwork, I guess. The kind of thing we learned in the first grade. It's thrilling on a visceral level, but it would have been nice if the filmmakers had something to say.\nA.O. Scott\nThe most notorious review of \"The Avengers\" probably came from\nA.O. Scott of the New York Times. Scott gave the film 2 stars out of 5, feeling the entire project to be artificial and cynical. He wrote:\n\"While 'The Avengers' is hardly worth raging about, its failures are significant and dispiriting. The light, amusing bits cannot overcome the grinding, hectic emptiness, the bloated cynicism that is less a shortcoming of this particular film than a feature of the genre.\"\nScott continued, pointing out that the superhero genre, even as early as 2012, had recognizable limits in terms of storytelling, writing:\n\"It is not as if the number of movies featuring troubled guys wearing costumes and fighting evil has diminished since then. Quite the contrary. But, the genre, though it is still in a period of commercial ascendancy, has also entered a phase of imaginative decadence.\"\nScott seems to have been an early adopter of popular criticisms of the MCU in general. When each film is part of a larger, interlocking super narrative, each individual chapter can feel like an incomplete, empty gear ... or worse, a mere commercial for an upcoming movie. This review was openly reviled on social media, and \"Avengers\" star Samuel L. Jackson\neven sicced \"Avengers\" fans on Scott, Tweeting \"#Avengers fans, NY Times critic A.O. Scott needs a new job! Let's help him find one! One he can ACTUALLY do!\"\nIn response, Scott wrote an entire book defending the art of film criticism, a vital tome in the face of a series of ostensibly \"critic-proof\" films like the ones in the MCU. Scott's\n\"Better Living Through Criticism,\" might be the most insightful thing to come out of the toxic fandom that arose in the primordial soup of Marvel fandom.\nJoe Morgenstern\nJoe Morgenstern of the Wall Street Journal wasn't able to see beyond the clanging action of \"The Avengers.\" It's a persistent truth about cinema that action tends to be the least interesting part of a movie, as action sequences are little more than little intermissions in between character moments and story developments. As such, when \"The Avengers\" climaxed with a city-wide invasion of faceless space aliens, and the Avengers began rocketing about stabbing and shooting them, Morgenstern could only sit in patient silence waiting for it to end. Morgenstern also didn't like the slow opening scenes, writing:\n\"A slow start, a single star performance surrounded by indifferent acting and an onslaught of computer effects that range from seen-it-all-in-'Transformers' to a whole sky full of spectacular stuff in the midtown Manhattan climax.\"\nFamiliarity breeds contempt, as the old aphorism goes.\nMorgenstern has famously adopted the (rather correct) criticism philosophy that an enjoyable film isn't necessarily the same as a good one. Something that is entertaining and gratifying to one's primal brain isn't the same thing as a well-structured and ambitious work of art. At best \"The Avengers\" is the former. It lights the hearts of young kids who want to see Man in Blue Suit punch Green Man and Rocket Robot Guy, but has no ambitions beyond that.\nHe, at the very least, praised\nRobert Downey, Jr. for giving a wonderful performance.\nKarina Longworth\nKarina Longworth, writing for the Village Voice, wasn't about to take any B.S. from the Avengers. She saw Whedon's film as little more than boyish, immature masculine posturing, a monument to the fragility of the male ego. She noted that the four main Avengers \"form a varied gallery of masculine neuroses.\" The women, meanwhile, are given even less. Longworth also had little patience for the shallow characterization, writing:\n\"They're ... largely up their own asses, each of them lone warriors wary of giving up control. [...] Whedon uses the calm in between Loki-initiated storms to demonstrate ad nauseam that the Avengers just can't get along. As daring as it might seem for the biggest superhero movie ever to turn the action knob way down for an hour so that its actors can do some acting, the actual material they're given is as programmatic as a bad culture-clash rom-com, transparently meant to tear our heroes apart just so they can come back together.\"\nBecause the story is not ambitious, it falls back into predictability. \"Really, who cares about another battle?\" Longworth wrote, \"We all know how this is going to end.\" Many fans responded positively to the film's brisk brightness and stakes-free tone; fighting evil is easy and non-lethal for the Avengers. Longworth rightly pointed out that there was little thrill when the entire multi-million-dollar film felt so insubstantial.\nStephanie Zacharek\nWriting for Movieline, Stephanie Zacharek was blunt, calling Whedon's film \"a G-8 summit of action figures.\" She continued, \"It's less a movie than a novelization of itself, an oversized, self-aware picture designed mostly for effect: That of reliving the experience of a movie you've seen before and just can't get enough of.\" Zacharek noted that\nJoss Whedon had a creative advantage in making \"The Avengers\" in that he didn't have to establish anything, as the characters were all introduced in other films, and he didn't need to build up any goodwill, as fans walked into the movie already loving the characters. As such, all Whedon had to do was conceive of a few action set pieces lightly connected by comedic dialogue. Boom. Super blockbuster.\nZacharek wrote:\n\"[T]he movie's scale and size does little to serve those characters, and there's something self-congratulatory about Whedon's whole approach, as if he were making a movie only for people who are already in on the in-joke. Comic-book aficionados who have always loved the Avengers may very well love 'The Avengers'; those who wouldn't know a Tesseract from a Rubik's Cube may feel differently. That's the thing about other people's nostalgia: It's always a b*tch.\"\nAs with the above reviews, Zacharek seems to be zeroing in on what many would begin saying about MCU movies in another decade or so. Once their reliance on audience goodwill began to wear thin, audiences could finally see MCU movies as thudding and thin, unable to stand on their own.\nAmy Nicholson\nAmy Nicholson, writing for Box Office Magazine, had the distinction of publishing the first \"rotten\" rating on \"The Avengers\" Rotten Tomatoes page. Nicholson noted that the characters in\n\"The Avengers\" were too thin, which is fair. Audiences have to take for granted the fact that these superheroes are on the side of righteousness and that they want to serve as a freelance military force; there are no conversations about the nature of being a hero, nor are there solutions discussed that don't involve a head-on, violent assault.\nThe trippingly tone, for Nicholson, was an issue. She wrote:\n\"'The Avengers' almost works. It's funny and it's physical, but even at two and a half hours, it plays like it's on fast-forward. Forget character development — there's not even character explanation. The lesser Avengers are most slighted. After two movies with Black Widow and Hawkeye, I know less about them than I do the fighting Panda in 'Tekken.' If such a thing can be said about a $220m dollar blockbuster, 'The Avengers' needs more ambition.\"\nShe continued: \"Sure, it's fine for most films to host their battle royale in downtown Manhattan, but the superfriends deserve more. Prehistoric metal monsters smashing up skyscrapers? We've seen that before.\"\nAll told, the critics — including myself — seem to be unified. The movie is action-packed but unsophisticated and unengaging. There are too many assumptions about what the audience already loves, and how their tolerance for \"The Avengers\" is going to be directly proportional to that.\nWhat do you think? Do these reviews line up with the 2024-era gauge?",

Ciencia » Salud Psicología Tecnología Turismo El Gobierno confía en que las negociaciones de Iberia y sindicatos por la huelga lleguen a \"buen resultado\" Agencias @DiarioSigloXXI viernes, 29 de diciembre de 2023, 12:10 h (CET) MADRID, 29 (EUROPA PRESS) El ministro de Industria y Turismo, Jordi Hereu, se ha mostrado \"confiado\" en que las negociaciones de Iberia con los sindicatos para frenar la huelga prevista entre el 5 y el 8 de enero en los servicios de asistencia en tierra lleguen a un \"buen resultado\". \"Confiamos en el acierto de las negociaciones que Iberia está teniendo con las fuerzas sindicales y, por tanto, espero que llegaremos a un buen resultado\", ha añadido a los medios de comunicación tras la celebración de la Conferencia Sectorial de Turismo. Aún así, el titular de Turismo ha destacado que \"hasta ahora\" la campaña de Navidad ha tenido \"un funcionamiento muy correcto\" y espera que \"se pueda terminar la campaña con la plena normalidad, en base al acuerdo que tengan\". En la última reunión entre las dos partes, celebrada este jueves en el Servicio de Mediación y Arbitraje de la Comunidad de Madrid (SIMA), se finalizó sin un acuerdo que pueda suspender la huelga prevista que coincide con el Día de Reyes y el fin de las vacaciones de Navidad. Casi un centenar de compañías aéreas podrían verse afectadas por la huelga que se avecina en los aeropuertos españoles esta Navidad. Los sindicatos, que ya habían amenazado anteriormente con ocho días de paros coincidiendo con el fin de año, han convocados finalmente paros en la operación de vuelta de Navidad en protesta por la negativa de Iberia a realizar el autohandling a las aerolíneas de su grupo International Airlines Group (IAG) en los ocho aeropuertos en los que ha perdido la concesión de Aena. Todo apunta a que si no hay cambios de última hora en esos días hasta 29 aeropuertos se podrían ver afectados por la huelga de handling convocada por los trabajadores de Iberia, entre ellos los grandes hub de Madrid y Barcelona, además de los aeródromos Palma de Mallorca, Málaga, Alicante, Gran Canaria, Tenerife Norte, Tenerife Sur, Valencia, Sevilla, Ibiza y Bilbao, con gran afluencia de viajeros estos días. La movilización no solo afectará a Iberia, sino que complicará las operaciones de más de 90 compañías aéreas a las que presta servicio de handling en la red de Aena. POSTURA DE IBERIA Tras finalizar sin acuerdo la reunión que se ha prolongado durante cuatro horas Iberia ha asegurado que lamenta \"profundamente\" la negativa de los sindicatos a desconvocar la huelga prevista para la próxima semana y reitera su disposición al diálogo, según han señalado a Europa Press en fuentes de la aerolínea. \"Para poder avanzar en cualquier tipo de negociación Iberia mantiene su condición imprescindible de que se desconvoquen los paros, que van a causar un daño innecesario e injustificado a los miles de viajeros que vuelven en esas fechas de sus vacaciones de Reyes\", asegura la aerolínea. Iberia reitera que el V Convenio del Sector garantiza \"absolutamente\" todos los puestos de trabajo así como todas las condiciones salariales y extrasalariales de por vida en un proceso subrogación.

    "text": "USA und China: Ansehen beschädigt - und der Tourismus leidet\nUS-Präsident Trump wird seinem Land Experten zufolge einen Rückgang der Touristenzahlen einbringen. Bisher allerdings muss Großmacht-Rivale China im Reiseverkehr größere Einbußen hinnehmen.\nMünchen/Peking - Im globalen Reiseverkehr haben Krisen und Konflikte der vergangenen Jahre China bislang mehr geschadet als den USA. Die beiden großen deutschen Flughäfen Frankfurt und München melden auch nach dem Amtsantritt von US-Präsident Donald Trump in diesem Jahr bisher einen Anstieg der Passagierzahlen auf den US-Routen, im China-Verkehr hingegen einen Rückgang. Und im direkten Vergleich der jeweiligen weltweiten Besucherzahlen haben die Vereinigten Staaten China seit 2019 überholt.\nFachwelt erwartet Trump-Krise im US-Tourismus\nDer Münchner Flughafen zählte von Januar bis Mai knapp 1,2 Millionen Passagiere im Flugverkehr mit den USA – fast 37.000 mehr als ein Jahr zuvor. Auch in Frankfurt legten die Fluggastzahlen in den ersten vier Monaten – noch ohne Mai – um 7.600 auf 944.300 zu. Das deutet bisher nicht auf einen riesigen Trump-Effekt. Allerdings ist diesen Daten nicht zu entnehmen, ob die Flieger mehrheitlich mit US-Bürgern oder Europäern besetzt waren. Die Zahlen beinhalten sowohl abfliegende als auch ankommende Passagiere.\nDass Trumps zweite Amtszeit dem US-Tourismus schaden wird, ist Konsens in der Fachwelt: Nach Schätzung des in London ansässigen Welttourismusverband WTTC und des Beratungsinstituts Oxford Economics kommen auf die USA in diesem Jahr Einnahmeverluste von über zwölf Milliarden Dollar zu, weil Ausländer fernbleiben. Der „Spiegel“ widmete der Trump-bedingten Reisekrise die Titelgeschichte seiner jüngsten Ausgabe.\nChina-Tourismus: Pandemie wirkt nach, Ukraine-Krieg schadet\nAuf den China-Flugrouten von und nach München und Frankfurt sind die Passagierzahlen in diesem Jahr bereits geschrumpft: um 1.300 auf knapp 203.000 Passagiere während der ersten fünf Monate in München. In den ersten vier Monaten in Frankfurt waren es 180.300 Fluggäste, die nach China flogen oder von dort ankamen, 27.000 weniger als ein Jahr zuvor. Ein quasi identisches Bild zeigt sich auch beim längerfristigen Vergleich der Jahre 2019 und 2024: Gesunkene Passagierzahlen nach und aus China, im Saldo höhere im US-Flugverkehr.\nWoran liegt das? „Die Erreichbarkeit Chinas hat sich erheblich verändert“, sagt Dennis Utzerath, Tourismusfachmann bei der internationalen Unternehmensberatung BCG in Köln. In der Corona-Pandemie wurde das Flugangebot sehr stark zusammengestrichen.\nUnd wegen des Ukraine-Kriegs umfliegen europäische Fluggesellschaften seit 2022 den russischen Luftraum auf teuren Umwegen, chinesische nicht. „Für europäische Fluggesellschaften ist es dadurch erheblich schwieriger geworden, gegen chinesische Airlines wettbewerbsfähig zu sein“, sagt Utzerath. Mehrere europäische Fluggesellschaften – darunter die Lufthansa und British Airways – setzten Verbindungen nach China aus.\nReiseveranstalter sehen wieder steigendes Interesse an China\n„Die immer noch schwachen Fluggastzahlen aus Deutschland Richtung China lassen erstaunlicherweise keinen Rückschluss auf die tatsächliche touristische Nachfrage für China zu“, sagt Holger Baldus, Sicherheitsmanager beim Münchner Reiseanbieter Studiosus. Hintergrund der Fluggastzahlen seien die Streckeneinstellungen europäischer Carrier Richtung China. Der Reiseanbieter sieht sogar ein erstaunliches Wiedererstarken des China-Tourismus aus Deutschland, Österreich und der Schweiz, nach Worten des Managers „derzeit von der knappen Verfügbarkeit an Flugsitzen noch gezügelt“.\nAuch der größte deutsche Reiseveranstalter Tui berichtet, dass das Interesse an China wachse – „aber natürlich von einer recht übersichtlichen Ausgangsbasis“, wie ein Sprecher des Unternehmens sagt.\nChinas Ansehen in der westlichen Welt leidet schon länger\nOffenkundig ist jedoch, dass China seit der Corona-Pandemie international an Attraktivität verloren hat. Reisten 2019 nach offiziellen Zahlen noch knapp 96,6 Millionen Ausländer in die Volksrepublik, waren es 2024 nur noch rund 64,9 Millionen – ein Rückgang von etwa ein Drittel. Der Reiseverkehr in die USA hat sich nach dem Ende der Pandemie deutlich schneller erholt: 2019 zählten die Vereinigten Staaten 79,3 Millionen Besucher, weniger als die Volksrepublik. Im vergangenen Jahr waren es 72,3 Millionen – mehr als in China.\nChinas Ansehen in der westlichen Welt leidet schon erheblich länger als das der USA. Welchen Effekt die Berichterstattung – etwa über staatliche Überwachung und Schnüffelei, brachiale Corona-Lockdowns, Umweltverschmutzung oder Kriegsdrohungen gegen Taiwan – hatte und hat, lässt sich nicht bemessen.\nTourismus lebt von „positiven Bildern im Kopf“\n„Das Thema Image spielt beim Thema China sicher eine Rolle“, sagt Unternehmensberater Utzerath. Schlechte Publicity hinterlasse immer Spuren. „Und das liegt weniger daran, dass ein Land „unten durch“ wäre, sondern dass der Fluss an schönen Erfahrungen, positiven Reiseberichten und Eindrücken abreißt.“ Damit verlagere sich das Interesse. „Ich würde dem keine übermäßige Dramatik beimessen, aber das zeigt, was für ein volatiles Geschäft Tourismus ist. Die Branche lebt von Schlagzeilen und positiven Bildern im Kopf.“\nDieselbe Volatilität gilt auch für die USA: „Es ist im Moment nicht so, dass viele Schlagzeilen dafür sprechen, ausgerechnet jetzt in die USA zu reisen, wenn man letztes Jahr nicht dort war“, sagt Utzerath. Auf der anderen Seite ist der Dollar-Wechselkurs derzeit für Europäer durchaus günstig.\nChina braucht Touristen als Stütze einer schwachen Konjunktur\nAnders als die US-Regierung will Peking ausdrücklich mehr Reisende ins Land locken. Mittlerweile hat die chinesische Regierung ihre komplizierte und teure Visapolitik gelockert. Deutsche brauchen für Geschäfts- oder Tourismusreisen kein Visum mehr. Wer einreist, darf mittlerweile 30 Tage bleiben. Diese Regelung gilt auch für zahlreiche andere europäische Länder.\nAuch die Zugänge zum digitalen Bezahlsystem Chinas sind durch übersetzte Apps und Akzeptanz ausländischer Kreditkarten einfacher geworden. Im ersten Quartal dieses Jahres bezifferten die Behörden die Einreisen von Ausländern auf etwa 17,4 Millionen – im Jahresvergleich ein Zuwachs um etwas mehr als ein Drittel.\nPeking hofft, dass der Tourismus auch der heimischen Wirtschaft unter die Arme greift. Die schwache Nachfrage und eingetrübte Konsumlaune, die der Wirtschaftsleistung zusetzen, will China auch mit mehr Inlandstourismus wieder ankurbeln. Neue Angebote – etwa speziell für Senioren ausgelegte Zugreisen mit Krankenversorgung und Pflege an Bord – sollen auch die ältere Bevölkerung zu größerem Konsum bewegen. dpa",
