    "text": "Israeli 'aggression' targets Syrian air defence base: Report The attack near the airport came \"one whole day after the airport resumed flights,\" said the British-based monitor with a network inside Syria. Israel carried out an aerial strike targeting a main Syrian air defence base in southern Syria on Thursday in the latest bombing campaign since the outbreak of war in Gaza on Oct. 7, Syrian army and intelligence sources said. Citing a Syrian military source, state media had earlier said missile strikes coming from the direction of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights had targeted several sites it did not identify. [Click here](https://www.hindustantimes.com/2024-planner-guide-and-2023-top-events-recap) \"Our air defences confronted the (Israeli) aggressors' missiles and downed some of them with only material losses,\" a Syrian military source said. Reuters could not independently verify the report. There was no immediate comment from Israel's military. Since the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas on Israeli civilians and soldiers, Israel has escalated its strikes on Iranian-backed militia targets in Syria and also struck Syrian army air defences and some Syrian forces. The strikes are believed to have targeted a Syrian army air defence base and a radar station in the Tel al-Sahn area in the Sweida province in southwestern Syria, according to a Syrian military intelligence source and another regional security official familiar with the matter. Last month, another anti-aircraft defence system in Tel Qulaib and Tel Maseeh in southern Syria were hit in what the senior intelligence sources said was an intensified campaign by Israel to disrupt Syrian air defence systems that Iran was involved in expanding. \"Tehran is stepping up its efforts to provide Syria with air defence systems that can potentially erode of the effectiveness of Israeli strikes,\" said another regional military source who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. \"This is related to the Gaza war calculations in the event of the conflict spreading,\" he added. Israel has for years carried out attacks on what it has described as Iran-linked targets in Syria, where Tehran's influence has grown since it began supporting President Bashar al-Assad in a civil war that started in 2011. The strikes are part of an escalation of what has been a low-intensity conflict with a goal of slowing Iran's growing entrenchment in Syria, Israeli military experts say. Fighters allied with Iran, including Hezbollah, now hold sway in vast areas in eastern, southern and northwestern Syria and in several suburbs around the capital.

    "text": "SPONSORED CONTENT -- (StatePoint) Each year, as many as 80,000 children younger than 5 are hospitalized due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in the United States. RSV is the leading cause of hospitalization in all infants. New medical advancements however are safeguarding infants and some toddlers at increased risk, and providing hope.\nAs RSV season ramps up, the American Lung Association is partnering with Sanofi to help educate parents and expectant parents about the symptoms of RSV and the steps they can take to help prevent severe illness. Here is what they want you to know:\nRisk factors: Virtually every child will contract RSV at some point, however those at highest risk for severe illness and complications are:\n• Premature newborns\n• Babies up to 12 months old, especially if they are 6 months old or younger\n• Children younger than 2 who have a chronic lung disease or heart disease that was present at birth\n• Children who have weakened immune systems\n• Children who have neuromuscular disorders\nNew protection: In 2023, two preventive immunization options were recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to help protect infants from serious RSV illness: a preventive RSV antibody for infants and some young children at increased risk, and an RSV vaccine received during weeks 32-36 of pregnancy.\nThe RSV antibody is recommended from October through March and provides protection for at least five months after immunization. The RSV vaccine is recommended from September through January and provides protection for around six months after birth. Both immunization options are effective in reducing the risk of a baby being hospitalized from RSV, however most infants do not need both. Speak to your physician about the best course of action for your family.\nSymptoms: Most people, including infants, develop only mild RSV symptoms similar to that of a common cold, such as congestion, runny nose and a cough. You should call your healthcare provider if your child is having difficulty breathing, not drinking enough or their symptoms are getting worse.\nAge-old wisdom: To prevent RSV infection, families are also encouraged to follow everyday healthy habits like:\n• Avoiding close contact with sick people\n• Covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue\n• Washing hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds\n• Cleaning frequently-touched surfaces\n• Staying home when sick and avoiding close contact with others\n• Avoiding sharing cups, bottles or toys\nTo learn more about RSV and illness prevention, visit lung.org/rsv .\n“Thanks to new preventive options, you now have multiple opportunities to offer your child safe, effective protection from a dangerous RSV infection,” says Juanita Mora, M.D., national volunteer medical spokesperson for the American Lung Association.\nPhoto Credit: (c) monkeybusinessimages / iStock via Getty Images Plus",

    "text": "[Última hora en elEconomista.es15](/slices/web-slice.php?modulo=392) Los trabajadores de Boeing han decidido, después de semanas de negociaciones, ir a una huelga tras rechazar el acuerdo entre los sindicatos y el fabricante estadounidense de aviones, que contemplaba un incremento general de los salarios del 25% en cuatros años y que consideran insuficiente. Sería la primera huelga de la empresa en 16 años, recuerda Efe. La anterior fue en 2008 y tuvo un seguimiento de más de 50 días que paralizó la producción y le costó a Boeing unos 100 millones de dólares por día, según señalan medios estadounidenses como WSJ y FT.En concreto, cerca del 95% de los miembros del sindicato International Association of Machinist (IAM, por sus siglas en inglés) ha votado en contra del acuerdo que incluía el citado incremento salarial hasta 2027. En este sentido, señalan que los aumentos salariales propuestos son escasos tras una década de estancamiento salarial y a tenor del aumento del coste de la vida.Esta huelga detendrá la producción de aviones de Boeing, en un momento en el que la compañía arrastra problemas tras el incidente del avión Boeing 737 MAX 9 de Alaska Airlines en pleno vuelo, y acentuará la falta de aviones en el sector aéreo. En el marco de las negociaciones, el reciente director ejecutivo de Boeing, Kelly Ortberg, había pedido a los trabajadores que no hiciera huelga y realizó algunas visitas a las fábricas.Los miembros del Distrito 751 de la IAM representa a unos 33.000 trabajadores de Boeing.",

    "title": "9 Dumbbell Arm Exercises to Strengthen Your Upper Body",
    "text": "9 Dumbbell Arm Exercises to Strengthen Your Upper Body\nIf you're looking to get stronger in your upper body, dumbbell arm workouts are the way to go. You don't need access to tons of equipment and gym machines; with\na pair of dumbbells, a solid selection of dumbbell arm exercises, and a consistent routine (trainers recommend at least two strength training sessions per week), you'll be able to build muscle in your shoulders, triceps, and biceps. So what are some effective weighted arm exercises you should consider adding to your next workout? We asked the experts — aka certified personal trainers — and they answered, sharing nine of the best dumbbell exercises to strengthen your arms.\nPlease note: we don't recommend doing all these moves in one workout (your arms will not thank you for that). Instead, sprinkle a few throughout your weekly strength-training routine to really work your upper body. If you want to do a dedicated arm workout, start with an\nupper-body warmup and then pick four or five of these moves to do.\nIn terms of equipment, you'll just need two dumbbells. Feel free to pick up whatever weight feels appropriately challenging for you. If you're a beginner, you may want to start with three- or five-pounders and work your way up. (Here's a guide for\nchoosing the right weight.) Got your equipment? Keep reading for the best dumbbell arm exercises that'll be sure to get your muscles shaking.\nDumbbell Arm Exercises: Lateral Arm Raise\nThis dumbbell arm exercise doesn't work a ton of muscles but targets one that's often ignored. Lateral arm raises work your lateral deltoid (the muscle on the side of your shoulder), says\nSherika Holmes, NASM-certified personal trainer and owner of Sherika Fitness.\n- Stand with your feet hip-width apart. Hold a dumbbell in each hand so your palms face backwards.\n- With control, keep your arms straight (but not locked at the elbow) and raise both hands up and out in front of you. Keep your palms facing down stop when your arms are parallel to the floor. Then, bring your arms out to the sides, still raised. Keep your core engaged and back flat.\n- Slowly lower the weights to return to the starting position.\n- That's one rep. Try 2-3 sets of 10-12 reps.\nDumbbell Arm Exercises: Plank Dumbbell Row\nThis exercise targets the triceps, but it can also help you build mid- and upper-back strength and stability, says\nKhaleah London, certified Pilates instructor and lead instructor for Equinox. \"While the exercise targets the triceps, you get the added benefit of working and strengthening almost every other major muscle group in your body,\" she tells POPSUGAR.\n- Start on your hands and knees, shoulders directly over wrists and hips over knees, holding a dumbbell against the ground in each hand. Brace your core and extend your legs behind you, tucking your toes under to lift your knees off the ground and spreading your feet wider than shoulder-width apart. This is your starting position.\n- Engage your core and squeeze your glutes as you lift the right dumbbell off the ground, pulling it toward your right hip. Make sure your right elbow is pointing up and your hips stay square to the floor.\n- Lower the weight to the ground with control, bracing your core and glutes. Try not to rock your shoulders or hips from side to side. Repeat on the other side.\n- That's one rep. Try 2-3 sets of 6-8 reps.\nDumbbell Arm Exercises: Dumbbell Bench Press\n\"Not only is this exercise good for building up your chest, but it also recruits the muscles of your arms and shoulders,\" says Caley Crawford, NASM-certified personal trainer and director of education for\nRow House. She described the bench press as a dynamic move that works your muscles together, helping you build strength and coordination throughout your upper body.\n- Sit on a flat workout bench with one leg on either side. With one dumbbell in each hand resting on your thighs, lie back onto the bench. (If you don't have a bench, use a stability ball, as show, or lie flat on the ground with your legs bent and feet flat on the floor.)\n- Hold the dumbbells above your chest, shoulder-width apart, creating a 90-degree angle between your upper arm and forearm. Your palms should be facing forward. Press your back against the bench and engage your core.\n- Exhale as you push the dumbbells up, fully extending your arms so the weights come to a stop above your shoulders. Hold for one second.\n- Inhale and lower the dumbbells to the sides of your chest with control.\n- That's one rep. Try 2-3 sets of 10-12 reps.\nDumbbell Arm Exercises: Overhead Triceps Extension\n\"This is an excellent dumbbell exercise to isolate the triceps,\" the muscles on the back of your upper arm, says Crawford. Overhead triceps extensions (seated or standing), she said, \"allow for a solid range of motion which really challenges the totality of your triceps.\"\n- Sit or stand with your feet hip-width apart, holding the center of one dumbbell in both hands behind your head, with your elbows bent and pointing toward the ceiling.\n- Engage your core so your back doesn't arch, and lift the dumbbell straight up toward the ceiling, bringing over your head.\n- Hold for one second, then slowly bend your arms to lower the weight behind your head.\n- That's one rep. Try 2-3 sets of 8-10 reps.\nDumbbell Arm Exercises: Curl With Lunge\nThe curl with a lunge is a favorite among the pros — and for good reason. It works your biceps, core, and glutes, among other things. Plus, it's a combo of two classic and effective exercises you probably already know.\n- Stand with your feet and knees slightly apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand. Let the dumbbells rest by your sides.\n- Keep\nyour core engagedas you bend your elbows, bringing the weights to your shoulders.\n- Lower your arms down toward the floor, taking a large step with your left foot to the left and into a lunge.\n- Repeat on the right side for 1 rep.\n- Continue lunging for 30 seconds, alternating on your left and right sides.\nDumbbell Arm Exercises: Triceps Kickback\n\"This is one of my favorite movements for isolating the triceps,\" says ACE-certified personal trainer Tami Smith, who owns\nFit Healthy Momma. \"I recommend these often because the triceps play an integral role in so many of our movements, both in daily life and our workouts.\"\n- Start standing with your feet hip-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand. Hinge at the hips about 45 degrees, keeping your knees slightly bent and core engaged. Bent your elbows so they form a 90-degree angle, with your palms facing each other. This is the starting position.\n- Straighten your arms behind you with your palms facing in. Initiate the movement from your elbows, keeping your upper arms as still as possible and tight to your sides. Stop when your arms are parallel to the floor.\n- Squeeze your triceps, then bend your elbows to return to the starting position.\n- That's one rep. Try 2-3 sets of 10-12 reps.\nDumbbell Arm Exercises: Single-Arm Overhead Shoulder Press\nThe overhead shoulder press \"works all three parts of the shoulder: the anterior, medial, and posterior deltoid,\" says ACE-certified trainer Lacey Stone. Similar to the traditional overhead shoulder press, this one-arm variation lets you focus on one side at a time. Holmes loves it \"because it's multifunctional,\" she says. \"Not only does it increase strength in your shoulders, but it also increases core strength,\" especially your anterior core and your obliques along your sides.\n- Start standing with your feet hip-width apart and a dumbbell in each hand, racked above your shoulders, palms facing in. This is your starting position.\n- Straighten your right arm to press the weight directly up, keeping your left hand in place. Keep a slight bend in your elbows at the top, ensuring that the weight is directly over your shoulder, and keep your core engaged.\n- Bend your right elbow to lower the dumbbell and return to the starting position. Repeat on the other side.\n- That's one rep. Try 2-3 sets of 8-10 reps.\nDumbbell Arm Exercises: Lawn Mower\nAs a\ncompound exercise, the lawn mower requires multi-joint movement that looks simple, but targets a whole host of muscles, including your back, arms, shoulders, and core.\n- With a dumbbell in your left hand and your right arm bent with the right hand in a fist (about shoulder height), squat, bringing the weight toward the floor.\n- Pull your abs to your spine as you straighten your legs, and pull your left elbow up, bringing the weight to your chest while your right arm extends straight.\n- Then contract your right arm, bend your knees and squat returning the weight back toward the floor returning to the starting position. That's 1 rep.\n- Complete three sets of 10 reps on each side.\nDumbbell Arm Exercises: Single-Arm Row\nThis move, recommended by Roger Montenegro, NSCA-CSCS\n, is a great one for your upper body and the muscles that help stabilize your back.\n- Stand with your feet staggered, right foot in front, bent into a lunge. Hold a dumbbell in your left hand, and rest your right hand or elbow on your right thigh. Extend your left arm so the dumbbell hangs directly below your left shoulder. This is your starting position.\n- Keeping your core engaged and shoulders relaxed, row the dumbbell up to your left rib, keeping your arm in close to your torso.\n- Hold for a second, then lower the dumbbell back down to the starting position. Try not to rotate your shoulders during any part of the movement.\n- That's one rep. Try 2-3 sets of 8-10 reps, then switch sides and repeat.\nMaggie Ryan was an assistant editor at POPSUGAR.

    "text": "Teddybär: Tröster, Demonstrant und einfach kuschelig\nSie werden nach Attentaten oder Unfällen an Gedenkorten abgelegt, trösten Kinder in der Klinik und werden manchmal bis ins hohe Alter aufbewahrt: Teddybären stehen für Nähe, Sicherheit und Trost.\nMister Bean spielt mit seinen dunkelbraunen Strickbären, Kinder lieben die berühmten Bären Paddington und Winnie Puuh: „Teddybären haben einen ungeheuren Siegeszug als Sympathieträger hinter sich“, sagt die Leiterin des Nürnberger Spielzeugmuseums, Karin Falkenberg. Bären sind aus ihrer Sicht das „Standardkuscheltier“ für alle, die nach Nähe und Sicherheit suchen. Dazu komme, dass das Tier international und weltanschaulich neutral sei.\nDem pensionierten Erlanger Pfarrer Hans-Jürgen Luibl ist aufgefallen, dass Teddys aus den Kinderzimmern immer häufiger in die Welt gehen: Er sieht Teddybären an Gedenkorten nach Anschlägen zwischen Blumen und Kerzen, auf Demonstrationen gegen Krieg und an Gräbern. Luibl zeigt auf ein Bild, das er aus einer Zeitung ausgeschnitten hat: In der georgischen Hauptstadt Tiflis sitzt eine Demonstrantin bei einem Protest gegen Rechtsruck und Wahlbetrug mit einer Georgien-Flagge auf der Straße und hat einen überdimensionalen Teddy auf dem Schoß, „der ihr vielleicht Kraft gibt“, vermutet der Theologe.\nIn Gedenken an Verstorbene\n„Kuscheltiere sind emotional wichtige Gegenstände“, bestätigt Trauerexpertin und Bestatterin Emily Maichle aus Geislingen an der Steige. Wer einen Teddybären an einem Gedenkort für Verstorbene ablege, „will zeigen, wie sehr man sich mit einer Familie, die etwas verloren hat, verbunden fühlt“. Sie wünscht sich, dass es auf Friedhöfen Grabarten gibt, an denen Angehörige ein Kuscheltier und andere Andenken ablegen dürfen. Selbst hat sie schon erlebt, dass Kinder ihr Kuscheltier beim verstorbenen Opa in den Sarg gelegt haben.\nContent-Partnerschaft\nDieser Artikel entstand in einer Content-Partnerschaft mit dem Evangelischen Pressedienst (epd).\nKathrin Kaffenberger ist Pfarrerin in der Kinderklinik der Uniklinik Erlangen und weiß um die besondere Bedeutung eines Teddybären in Krisensituationen: Oft nimmt sie in der Klinik nach einem Unglück Kinder in Empfang, die mit dem Rettungswagen gebracht werden. Wenn die nicht schon einen Bären vom Sanitäter-Team erhalten haben, drückt sie den Kleinen einen Teddy oder ein anderes Kuscheltier in den Arm. „So ein Teddy ist dann ganz wichtig, weil sie sich daran festhalten können“, sagt sie.\nMitgebrachte Kuscheltiere, die bei einem Unfall schmutzig und beim Löschen durch die Feuerwehr nass geworden waren, wäscht die Pfarrerin gleich auf der Kinderstation und föhnt sie vor den Augen des kleinen Besitzers trocken. „Damit nach der Katastrophe dann irgendwas noch heil ist.“\nErfindung von Richard Steiff\nDie Geschichte des Bären in den Kinderzimmern beginnt 1902 mit Richard Steiff, einem Neffen der deutschen Spielzeugfabrikantin Margarete Steiff. Er erfindet den ersten Plüschbären mit beweglichen Armen und Beinen und will ihn in den USA verkaufen. Dort kommt der aber zunächst gar nicht gut an. Bis er als Verlegenheitsmitbringsel durch mehrere Hände geht und schließlich im Haushalt des Präsidenten Theodore Roosevelt landet, wie es eine moderne Legende erzählt. Die Tochter sei begeistert gewesen und nannte das Spielzeug nach ihrem Vater „Teddy“. Was folgt: Der Bär von Steiff wird doch ein Verkaufsschlager. Und der 9. September ist in den USA sogar der Teddy Bear Day.\nPfarrer Luibl, neugierig auf den Bären geworden, schätzt, dass in Deutschland wohl jährlich zehn Millionen Teddybären verkauft werden. Zu einem Gottesdienst zum Thema Teddybär sind jüngst in die Erlanger Markuskirche fast 100 Besucher und ebenso viele Teddys gekommen. „Es waren 90-Jährige mit ihren abgeschabten Bären oder Plüschhasen dabei“, erzählt Luibl. Er habe selten einen so gefühlsbetonten Gottesdienst gefeiert. Für den Theologen der Beweis: Teddybären sind kein Kinderkram. (von Jutta Olschewskia)",

    "text": "The National Institutes of Health (NIH) have initiated the Collection of medical records To support studies headed by US Secretary of Health, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., aimed at investigating autism. As confirmed on Monday, NIH director Jay Bhattacharya, the initiative seeks an exhaustive analysis of the disease nationwide, collects CBS News.\nThe platform, qualified by Bhattacharya as a “transformative initiative”, will integrate data from federal and private sources. Among them are records of the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Indigenous Health Service, Laboratory test results, genomic information, pharmaceutical prescriptions insurance claims and even data collected by devices such as smart watches and physical activity trackers.\n“ Existing data resources are usually fragmented and are difficult to obtain. NIH himself usually pays several times for the same data resource. Even the data resources that belong to the federal government are difficult to obtain, “Bhattacharya explained in a meeting with agency advisers. He also confirmed that they are in conversations with the Medicare and Medicaid service centers to expand access to their databases.\nThe project will also include the launch of a New National Diseases Registry to track autism cases in the US. This decision has caused criticism by associations, which reject that Kennedy describes autism as a “preventable disease” for considering it stigmatizing and unfounded.\nThe plan includes the selection of between 10 and 20 groups of external researchers who They will receive financing and access to these records to carry out studies on autism. Although Bhattacharya did not detail how the selection will be made, he said that the NIH standard procedures will follow and that “proposals of the highest quality” will be supported.\n“I recognize, of course, that autism has a range of demonstrations that cover from children with a high level of functionality to children with very serious disabilities. And, of course, The investigation will be very much “He said. Although researchers can study the data, they will not be able to download them, said Bhattacharya, who promised” avant -garde protections “to guarantee the confidentiality of patients.\nKennedy himself said Monday that autism is “An epidemic that eclipses that of Covid-19” in a new veiled attack on vaccines. “It is an epidemic. Eclipsa Covid’s epidemic and its consequences because Covid killed older people. Autism affects children and affects them at the beginning of their lives, when they begin to be productive, and it is something that weakens them a lot to them, their families, their communities,” he argued during an interview on the WABC 770 AM radio collected by the portal The Hill.\n#collect #medical #records #citizens #autism #studies #promoted #Kennedy",

    "title": "Empowering Families in Mental Health: Roger Farahmand’s Insights into Supporting Loved Ones",
    "text": "The role of family support in mental health treatment and healing is often foundational to providing strength and resilience to patients addressing complex mental health needs. Mental health issues, often shrouded in stigma and even misinformation, require a nuanced approach, and in this space, the support of a family can be transformative. Mental healthcare expert and entrepreneur,\nRoger Farahmand lends his perspective to the balance between empathy, understanding, and practical strategies that families can employ to foster an environment conducive to healing and growth. Through his unique lens, he explores effective communication, navigating the healthcare system, and maintaining the well-being of both the individual and the family unit.\nUnderstanding Mental Health Challenges\nMental health issues touch the lives of countless individuals and families across the globe. From anxiety and depression to personality disorders and schizophrenia, these conditions manifest in various forms, each carrying unique challenges. The impact of\nmental health concerns extends far beyond the individual and reverberates through families, affecting relationships, communication, and the overall dynamics of the household.\n“Mental health conditions are not just a series of symptoms to be treated, but rather a holistic experience that affects a person’s emotions, thoughts, behaviors, and physical health,” notes\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34860650-roger-farahmand. “This comprehensive impact necessitates a deep understanding and a compassionate approach from both healthcare professionals and family members.”\nOne of the most critical aspects of dealing with mental health issues is education and awareness. Families often find themselves unprepared and overwhelmed when a loved one is struggling with mental health problems. Lack of understanding can lead to misconceptions, fear, and sometimes even unintentional stigma within the family unit. This is where education becomes vital. Understanding what mental health issues are, how they manifest, and their common triggers and treatments can significantly alter the way families approach these challenges.\nEducation about mental health does not only involve learning about specific conditions but also involves understanding the signs and symptoms that may indicate a loved one is struggling. Early recognition of these signs can lead to quicker intervention and better outcomes. Signs can be as overt as a marked change in behavior or mood, or as subtle as withdrawal from social activities or changes in sleep patterns. Families should develop a keen awareness of these signs, encouraging open and non-judgmental dialogue within the family about mental health.\nAwareness also plays a crucial role in\ndestigmatizing mental health issues. When families educate themselves and talk openly about mental health, they contribute to breaking down the barriers of stigma. This not only helps the individual suffering from mental health issues but also fosters a supportive and understanding environment where seeking help is encouraged and normalized.\nAnother critical aspect of familial support for those managing mental illness is empathy. Understanding that mental health issues are not a choice and recognizing the internal struggle of the affected individual can foster empathy. This empathy is the foundation upon which supportive and compassionate family dynamics are built. It enables family members to provide the right kind of support – one that is respectful of the individual’s experiences and autonomy.\nUnderstanding mental health challenges requires education, awareness, empathy, and a willingness to engage in open dialogue. By embracing these principles, families can become a powerful force in the journey toward mental wellness, offering unwavering support and understanding that can make a significant difference in the lives of their loved ones.\nThe Role of Families in Mental Health Support\nThe role of families in supporting loved ones with mental health challenges is critical and complex. Families are often the first to notice changes in behavior, mood, or overall well-being, positioning them uniquely to offer early support and intervention. The journey is not without its complexities. Understanding the nuances of effective communication, empathy, and strategies to stay informed and involved is essential in fostering a supportive environment conducive to healing and growth.\nEffective communication is foundational to supporting a family member with mental health challenges. It involves more than just talking; it’s about creating an environment where the individual feels safe to express their feelings and thoughts without fear of judgment or misunderstanding. This means actively listening, showing genuine interest, and avoiding dismissive or judgmental language.\n“It’s important for families to educate themselves on the best ways to communicate. This includes understanding that sometimes, it’s not about offering solutions, but rather about being present and offering a listening ear,” says\nhttps://www.corporationwiki.com/Texas/Dallas/roger-farahmand/34892560.aspx.\nEqually important is recognizing when to give the individual space and when to gently encourage them to share their experiences. Creating an empathetic environment involves being patient, open-minded, and willing to learn from the experiences of the individual. It requires family members to sometimes set aside their own beliefs or preconceptions about mental health to fully understand the unique challenges their loved one is facing.\nStaying Informed and Involved\nBeing informed is vital in effectively supporting a family member with mental health challenges. This means keeping abreast of the latest information on mental health conditions, treatments, and support strategies. There are numerous resources available – from books and online materials to workshops and support groups – that can provide valuable insights and tools for families.\nStaying involved in a loved one’s mental health journey is equally important. This can include accompanying them to therapy sessions, if appropriate, or being involved in their treatment plan discussions. It’s about showing that you are there for them not just in times of crisis but consistently throughout their journey.\nFamilies should also be aware of the importance of setting boundaries. This involves recognizing the limits of their support and understanding when professional help is needed. It’s crucial for family members to take care of their own mental health as well, as supporting someone with mental health issues can be emotionally taxing.\nNavigating Mental Health Systems and Resources\nNavigating the complexities of mental health systems and resources is a critical aspect of supporting a loved one with mental health challenges. For many families, this journey can be daunting, filled with unfamiliar terminology, multiple healthcare providers, and a variety of treatment options. With the right knowledge and strategies, families can effectively guide their loved ones through the maze of mental health care, ensuring they receive the support and treatment they need.\n“The first step in navigating mental health systems is understanding how they work,” says Farahmand.\nThis involves knowing the different types of mental health professionals (such as psychiatrists, psychologists, therapists, and counselors), their roles, and the types of treatments they offer. It’s important to research and understand the differences between various therapy approaches, medications, and other treatment options. Additionally, families should familiarize themselves with the healthcare insurance landscape. This includes understanding what mental health services are covered, how to obtain referrals if needed, and how to handle insurance claims and disputes. Knowledge about these aspects empowers families to make informed decisions about their loved one’s mental health care.\nFinding and Utilizing Resources Effectively\nThere are numerous resources available for families dealing with mental health issues, ranging from support groups and educational materials to financial assistance programs. Identifying the most relevant and helpful resources is key. Families can start by consulting with mental health professionals, who can provide recommendations and referrals.\nOnline resources, including websites of reputable mental health organizations, can offer a wealth of information and support. Local community centers, libraries, and schools often have information on mental health resources and support groups. Additionally, there are apps and online platforms designed to assist individuals with mental health conditions, offering tools like mood tracking, mindfulness exercises, and even connecting with therapists online.\nAdvocating for Your Loved One\nAdvocacy is a vital role for families in the mental health care system. This involves being the voice for your loved one, especially in situations where they may not be able to advocate for themselves. It’s important to be prepared for appointments, have a list of questions, concerns, and observations about the loved one’s condition. Effective advocacy also means collaborating with healthcare professionals, not confronting them. This collaboration can involve discussing treatment options, providing input based on your loved one’s history and preferences, and asking for clarification when something is not understood.\nIn advocating for a loved one, it’s also crucial to respect their autonomy and involve them in decision-making processes as much as possible. This fosters a sense of control and empowerment for the individual, which is important for their mental health journey.\n- Keep Organized Records: Maintain a file of your loved one’s medical records, treatment plans, medications, and healthcare provider contacts. This will be invaluable in managing their care and in discussions with healthcare providers.\n- Educate Yourself: The more you know about mental health conditions and treatments, the better equipped you’ll be to help your loved one and communicate with healthcare providers.\n- Build a Support Network: Don’t do it alone. Connect with other families who have similar experiences, join support groups, or seek your own counseling to navigate this journey.\n- Know Your Rights: Understand the legal rights of individuals with mental health conditions, especially regarding privacy, consent to treatment, and access to medical records.\n- Stay Persistent: The mental health system can be challenging to navigate. Stay persistent, follow up on appointments and referrals, and don’t hesitate to ask for second opinions if needed.\nNavigating mental health systems and resources requires patience, persistence, and a willingness to learn. By understanding the system, effectively utilizing resources, and advocating for their loved ones, families can play a crucial role in securing the best possible care and support for their family members.\nUtilizing the resources available in your loved one’s care supports the well-being of the family unit as a whole. By staying informed and engaged, families can contribute to a broader societal understanding of mental health, helping to break down stigmas and foster a more compassionate and empathetic community. Together, through education, understanding, and action, we can create a more supportive environment for those navigating mental health challenges.",
