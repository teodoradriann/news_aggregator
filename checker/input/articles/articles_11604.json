    "text": "Beside the stairs connecting the dugout and clubhouse in T-Mobile Park, there’s an increasingly cruel reminder of the Mariners’ recent success. More specifically, there’s an instantly iconic photo of catcher Cal Raleigh — arm extended, bat aloft, eyes fixed on a baseball disappearing into a crowd of 44,754 fans who endured a 21-year drought to see that day.\nSince that photo was taken on Sept. 30, 2022 — since Raleigh’s solo homer sealed a 2-1 win over Oakland, cementing Seattle’s first playoff appearance since 2001 — 662 days have passed.\nIt feels like a whole lot more.\nBecause, in the 662 days since, the Mariners have failed to maintain that momentum — falling two games shy of a division title in 2023, before attempting to retool by adding veteran position players to a scintillating starting staff.\nRecently, the results have been hard to watch (\nand increasingly easy to boo), as a dramatically one-dimensional roster lost a 10-game lead in the AL West. That includes eight losses in their last nine games and a 2-1 defeat to the otherwise anemic Angels Wednesday to secure their first sweep of the season.\nOh, and above that photo sitting beside the stairs? Three increasingly ironic words beckon in neon blue:\nGOOD VIBES ONLY\nOn Wednesday, the vibes inside T-Mobile Park were understandably ominous. After updating the media on injuries to centerfielder Julio Rodriguez, shortstop J.P. Crawford and top prospect Felnin Celesten prior to the game, general manager Justin Hollander concluded: “I’ve had better weeks.”\nThen the Mariners made a bad week worse — as reliever\nGregory Santos sustained a knee injury while allowing the tying run in a frustratingly familiar loss. After left fielder Luke Raley flew out to end the game, a crowd of 39,953 rained boos like hot dogs falling from heaven.\nThe vibes?\nThey could be better.\n“You’ve got to realize that at the end of the day, this is a game. We have to enjoy what we’re doing,” said Raleigh, who went 1 for 4 in defeat. “If you’re not enjoying playing baseball, you need to probably get out. I understand, though. Guys are frustrated because they don’t have the numbers; we’re not performing as well and it’s hard to have fun.\n“It’s kind of like the chicken or the egg. Which comes first: do you have fun before you start winning, or do you have to win to start having fun? That’s kind of where I see the group at right now.”\nHere’s where the group is at, in more technical terms. At 53-51, the Mariners somehow trail the Astros by just a single game in an abysmal AL West. After dropping nine of their last 10 series, they travel for a three-game set this weekend against the historically horrible White Sox (27-77), before more significant tests against Boston (54-47) and Philadelphia (64-38). They have the seventh-easiest schedule (based on opponent winning percentage) the rest of the way, while Houston sits at 18th.\nThanks to an exemplary starting staff and a dreadful division, the flawed and flailing Mariners remain in the hunt.\nThey’re buyers, believe it or not.\nFor those in the “not” camp: your pessimism is well placed. This is a front office, after all, that added Jorge Polanco, Mitch Haniger, Mitch Garver and Luis Urias in the offseason to solidify a sputtering offense.\nAnd, well …\nPolanco: .200/.285/.298, -0.3 WAR\nHaniger: .207/.287/.342, -0.6 WAR\nGarver: .168/.285/.343, -0.1 WAR\nUrias: .152/.264/.316, -0.1 WAR\nHollander and president of baseball operations Jerry Dipoto essentially struck out, much like the Mariners.\nBut for those in the “believe” camp? Meet Scott Servais. Minutes after Wednesday’s 2-1 loss, the Mariners’ manager — who, two games earlier, called the team’s effort “inexcusable” — was a fountain of defiant faith.\n“I do believe we will get this going. It’s just a struggle right now.”\nAnd …\n“We will [get the ship righted]. I truly believe that.”\nAnd …\n“It will turn. It can be a cruel game, and it’s a beautiful game. You’ve got to kind of grind your way through it, and we will.”\nPerhaps Servais was trying to convince himself, as much as anyone. Or maybe it was a plea for Dipoto and Hollander to translate similar belief into bats and bullpen help.\n“We’ll see what happens,” Servais said of the trade deadline, which finally arrives Tuesday. “That’s not really my department. My department is trying to get the most out of the group we have here, and I have to do better, quite frankly.”\nSo, yes: the Mariners still have ample time to make a playoff push. And yes, they’re a sweep of the immensely sweep-able White Sox away from conceivably reclaiming a division lead. And yes, much of the core that watched Raleigh dramatically end the drought remains on the roster 662 days later.\nBut the vibes inside T-Mobile Park may also be beyond salvaging, as a starting staff’s collective prime yields repeated 2-1 defeats. As the realization dawns that a bat or two at the deadline might not cure a two-month (or year, or decade) malady. As Raleigh’s photo — the supposed opening of a winning window — feels increasingly far away.\nAs setbacks mount, and injuries multiply, it’s increasingly difficult to believe.",

Por ejemplo, en el sitio Birmingham Mail, referente de la ciudad en la que juega el Aston Villa, pidieron una estatua para el argentino, que ya tiene una en Mar del Plata, lugar de nacimiento. \"Le encantaba la tanda de penales e hizo lo que mejor sabe hacer para poner a Villa entre los cuatro semifinalistas\".\nThe Times, de Londres, opinó que fue el héroe del Aston Villa. Y lo valoró así: \"Martínez no es un villano que se acobarde y ya había molestado a la afición local al tomarse su tiempo con sus saques de meta, por lo que lo amonestaron en la primera parte. Cuando hizo callar a los fanáticos del Lille detrás arco después de salvar el primer penal de Nabil Bentaleb, estos se acercaron al frente de la grada para acercarse, arrojándole objetos\".\nEn tanto, Le Parisien, de París escribió: \"Cruel desilusión para el Lille, eliminado en los penales. El Lille creyó durante mucho tiempo que se había clasificado, pero perdió al final de una tanda en la que el portero argentino Dibu Martínez volvió a ser noticia\".\nLe Figaro: \"Provocativo para muchos, el portero argentino empujó al Lille hacia la salida\".\nHubo medios, como L'Equipe, y La Voix do Nord, de Lille, que evitaron hacer referencia a Dibu tanto en título como en bajada...",

    "title": "Miami's Mario Cristobal gets roasted after timeout fiasco in Pinstripe Bowl loss to Rutgers",
    "text": "Miami football is ready to move on from an overall unsuccessful season that is defined by mind-boggling mistakes and unmet expectations. But no one seems to be in a bigger hurry to get to 2024 than Mario Cristobal, following his questionable decision-making in the Pinstripe Bowl versus Rutgers. The Hurricanes head coach hung onto his two remaining timeouts instead of attempting to get the ball back from the Scarlet Knights in the closing seconds. Miami would have still needed a miracle, but that is something any team should willingly accept when faced with terrible odds. Moreover, the Canes might not have even been in this unfavorable position had Cristobal exercised better time management throughout the game- which was one they ultimately lost, 31-24. These miscues come after the former Miami offensive tackle (1989-92) [opted not to execute](https://clutchpoints.com/miami-football-news-mario-cristobal-explains-botched-decision-blew-hurricanes-win-vs-georgia-tech) a quarterback kneel in what should have been a surefire victory over Georgia Tech back in October. The Hurricanes fumbled and the Yellow Jackets made them pay with an unlikely touchdown drive. Frustration has festered since then, but the ending of Thursday's bowl game somehow leaves everyone [even more bewildered](https://twitter.com/IraHeatBeat/status/1740505398275350651?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1740505398275350651%7Ctwgr%5E329e9d359d8836bb6bdbb85ae21ff1abb683bf31%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp.clutchpoints.com%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D2611634action%3Dedit). Mario Cristobal will have two timeouts to use in the offseason after Miami loses a one-score game in which the Hurricanes had the ball last. — Barrett Sallee 🇺🇸 (@BarrettSallee) [December 28, 2023] I do not understand how Mario Cristobal can be in charge of this program in the morning. — Ian Hest (@IanHest) [December 28, 2023] Wondering what Mario Cristobal is going to do with those two spare timeouts next season? Are there any offseason game- management online classes available? — Ira Winderman (@IraHeatBeat) [December 28, 2023] I wonder what Mario Cristobal is going to do with those timeouts in the offseason. Maybe take them to Six Flags, get a nice selfie with them on a roller coaster. — Zach Barnett (@zach_barnett) [December 28, 2023] Mario Cristobal returned to Miami to set records and he certainly has after guiding the Hurricanes to their first loss against Rutgers in program history. The Scarlet Knights were previously 0-11 against the U. [#Noles] [pic.twitter.com/J61UQA340J] — Dustin Lewis (@DustinLewisNG) [December 28, 2023] “Wondering what Mario Cristobal is going to do with those two spare timeouts next season?,” the Sun Sentinel's Ira Winderman posted on X. “Are there any offseason game-management online classes available?” A major adjustment is needed by this coaching staff if the team is going play closer to its talent level next season. Despite signing a 10-year contract in 2021, Cristobal's job security is not set in stone. Just look at Jimbo Fisher. The program will have to thoroughly evaluate their current situation and determine if immediate improvement can be attained under this regime. As it stands, Miami football is already facing uncertain times at quarterback with the [transfer of Tyler Van Dyke](https://clutchpoints.com/tyler-van-dyke-predictions-transferring-wisconsin-football). Clarity is a must on the sidelines. It will be a long, long trip back from Yankee Stadium for this embattled squad.",

    "title": "Trump Stays on Primary Ballot, Says Colorado Secretary of State – PJ Media",
    "text": "Earlier this month, the Colorado State Supreme Court voted 4-3 that Trump is ineligible to run for the presidency, thereby unable to appear on the state’s ballot. According to the four justices who voted in the majority, the 14th Amendment renders Trump ineligible to be president.\nAdvertisement The Colorado Republican Party’s appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court is still pending, but the Colorado Secretary of State’s office has already weighed in on the matter and says that Trump will remain on the ballot. For now.\n\"Donald Trump will be included as a candidate on Colorado’s 2024 Presidential Primary Ballot when certification occurs on January 5, 2024, unless the U.S. Supreme Court declines to take the case or otherwise affirms the Colorado Supreme Court ruling,” the Colorado Secretary of State's office said in a statement .\nThis is hardly Secretary of State Jena Griswold defying the will of the state Supreme Court.\n\"Donald Trump engaged in insurrection and was disqualified under the Constitution from the Colorado ballot. The Colorado Supreme Court got it right,” Griswold claimed without evidence. \"This decision is now being appealed. I urge the U.S. Supreme Court to act quickly, given the upcoming presidential primary election.”\nThe Colorado Supreme Court ruling essentially declared that even though Trump has never tried for or been convicted of sedition or participating in an insurrection, he is nevertheless guilty.\nAdvertisement There’s a good reason why Trump has never been charged. Simply put, the allegations fall apart when you consider the evidence. Trump was still addressing the crowd when the Capitol violence erupted , and there is substantial proof that different groups had planned to storm the Capitol well in advance .\nEven Trump’s words on that day disprove the insurrection claims. He explicitly urged his supporters to partake in peaceful protest, stating during his speech, “I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.\"\nRelated: Here’s What You Should Know About the Four Justices Who Deemed Trump Ineligible to Run for President\nThe fact that the Colorado Supreme Court and even the Colorado Secretary of State insist that Trump should be treated as guilty of a crime for which he is not been tried or convicted makes it likely that the Supreme Court will take up this case, especially since various other states have rejected similar efforts to remove him from the ballot. Experts on both sides of the aisle believe it will be overturned.\nAdvertisement Some Republicans have responded to the Colorado Supreme Court ruling by suggesting that Biden should be removed from the ballot in other states for insurrection as well as he has allowed illegal immigrants to come across the border into our country in record numbers.\n“Seeing what happened in Colorado makes me think — except we believe in democracy in Texas — maybe we should take Joe Biden off the ballot in Texas for allowing 8 million people to cross the border since he’s been president, disrupting our state far more than anything anyone else has done in recent history,” Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick told Fox News’ Laura Ingraham before Christmas.",

    "text": "Leah Remini and Angelo Pagán Divorcing After 21 Years of Marriage: 'We Both Changed'\nLeah Remini and Angelo Pagán are calling it quits.\nThe King of Queens alum, 54, sadly took to\n\"Well, here we are. After 28 years together and 21 years of marriage, we have decided to file for divorce,\" the announcement began. \"This decision came after a lot of\nthought and care, and as hard as divorce is, we are approaching this with a positive outlook because we know it’s what’s best for us.\"\n\"We are proud of how we have\nworked through this together. Yes, we’re sad, and we’ve got some figuring out to do as we continue to move forward into our new normal — together still in many ways, and apart in some new ones,\" she added.\nDespite\nthe heartbreak, the former couple made it clear they will still very much be present in each other's lives. \"But here’s the thing: we’ve been best friends for so many years. We are still celebrating holidays together, watching our favorite tv shows together, and gathering as a family,\" the Second Act alum made clear.\nRemini addressed the elephant in the room of what exactly happened between the former lovebirds, who met in 1996. \"So, the big question — why? To put it simply, we both changed, as people do, and we got used to playing roles that didn’t fit us anymore,\" she wrote.\nJennifer Lopez and Leah Remini Rekindle Their Friendship After 2022 Falling Out Over Ben Affleck Marriage Leah Remini Receives Associate's Degree From NYU at 53, Admits Scientology 'Brainwashed' Her Into Believing She Wasn't 'Smart Enough' Leah Remini Details Intense Battle With Depression and Anxiety After 'Escaping' Scientology: 'It's a Constant Struggle'\n\"After a lot of effort and consideration, we’ve decided to take this step, which reflects who we are today. Our bond is still strong — it’s just evolved into something different. We think a marriage that lasted this long and created so many beautiful memories, especially raising our incredible daughter, is something to celebrate,\" the sitcom star, who wed Pagán in 2003, explained.\n\"From our perspective, this marriage was a\nhuge success. And now, we’re looking forward to creating even more cherished moments — just in a different way. We want to be as transparent as we can be here because, for years, we shared our marriage so publicly, whether it was on our specials on VH1 or our reality show, which ran for two seasons on TLC,\" Remini noted.\nNever miss a story — sign up for the\n OK! newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what OK! has to offer. It’s gossip too good to wait for!\nThe Scientology and the Aftermath star wrapped up the shocking news on a positive note. \"We are sharing this unknown territory with you all as we take our first steps into this next stage of our lives publicly. We would love for everyone to have more access to different kinds of relationship stories and not feel so isolated in navigating the changes that millions of couples make every year. We hope our journey can inspire others to see that relationships — whether they change or end —aren’t failures. We’ll keep sharing snippets of our lives as we navigate this new chapter. Love, Leah & Angelo,\" she concluded the post.",
