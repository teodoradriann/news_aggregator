    "text": "The United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA)'s pro-talks faction on Friday signed a tripartite Memorandum of Settlement pact with the Centre and the Assam government on Friday in the presence of Union Home Minister Amit Shah.A 29-member delegation of the ULFA's pro-talks delegation, including 16 ULFA members and 13 from civil society, signed the agreement.This a significant pact as the banned ULFA-Independent has been the only major insurgent outfit in the state after the ULFA pro-talks faction signed the agreement with the Centre and Assam government.On the historic development, Union Home Minister Amit Shah asserted, this is a new start of a period of peace for the whole Northeast especially Assam. I want to assure ULFA representatives that the faith you have kept in Govt of India, from the side of Ministry of Home Affairs(MHA), a programme will be made in a time-bound manner to fulfill everything, without you asking for it. Under MHA, a committee will be formed, which will work with the Assam govt to fullfill this agreement, he added. The separatist ULFA was formed in April 1979 in the aftermath of an agitation against undocumented immigrants from Bangladesh (erstwhile East Pakistan). It split into two groups in February 2011 with the Arabinda Rajkhowa-led faction giving up violence and agreeing to unconditional talks with the government. Paresh Baruah, who leads the other rebranded ULFA-Independent faction, is against the talks.The pro-talks faction has sought constitutional and political reforms for the protection of the identity and resources of Assam's indigenous people including their right to land. The Union government in April sent it a draft agreement. An earlier round of talks between the two sides was held in Delhi in August.A series of talks with officials concerned in the Central government has taken place since the delegation arrived in Delhi on December 26 before the signing of the pact.The Union government has signed peace deals with rebel Bodo, Dimasa, Karbi, and Adivasi outfits in Assam over the last three years.

    "text": "Entertainment TV Ray Romano Says Starring on Everbody Loves Raymond with Peter Boyle Was 'Surreal': 'He Made Me Feel Welcome' (Exclusive) Romano reflects on the late actor who died in 2006 from multiple myeloma and heart disease By JP Mangalindan JP Mangalindan JP Mangalindan is a Senior Writer for TV at PEOPLE. He joined PEOPLE in May 2023. JP's work has previously appeared in Insider, Fortune, Teen People, and Entertainment Weekly. People Editorial Guidelines Published on April 18, 2024 05:01PM EDT Close Peter Boyle and Ray Romano at the 57th annual Primetime Emmy Awards in West Hollywood, California in 2005. Photo: Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic When Ray Romano reflects on his time working with Peter Boyle on Everybody Loves Raymond, it’s with an incredible sense of fondness and reverence. During a recent interview with PEOPLE, Romano, 66, discussed his early days with his former costar, who died on December 12, 2006 at 71 from multiple myeloma and heart disease. Romano hosted The International Myeloma Foundation Gala on Thursday, April 18, which benefits the Peter Boyle Research Fund and advances in myeloma research. At the time Everybody Loves Raymond premiered in September 1996, Boyle was already an accomplished actor with a long list of credits to his name, including his breakout role in 1970’s Joe, the 1974 comedy Young Frankenstein directed by Mel Brooks and the 1989 comedy thriller The Dream Team. “When I met him, he, of course, was a well-known movie actor, star, and I was nobody. I was a stand-up who got his own sitcom and was trying acting,” Romano recalls of Boyle, adding, “I was very intimidated and he took me in. He made me feel welcome. He made me feel part of the club.” 'Everybody Loves Raymond' Cast: Where Are They Now? 'Everybody Loves Raymond' stars Doris Roberts, Peter Boyle, Sawyer Sweeten, Ray Romano, Sullivan Sweeten, Brad Garrett, Patricia Heaton and Madylin Sweeten. On the first day of rehearsals for the CBS sitcom, Boyle noticed how “nervous” Romano was and stopped the comic to offer some advice. “[Peter] said this one quote, and there was no segues or anything. He just stopped me as I was walking, and he said, ‘It's just like water. Just let it flow,’” Romano shares. “In the first season, I rented an apartment, because my family stayed in New York and his family stayed in New York, and we coincidentally were in the same apartment complex,” he continued, adding that the two would hang out, rehearse and grab dinner. Patricia Heaton Remembers Mentor and 'Everybody Loves Raymond' Co-Star Doris Roberts Everybody Loves Raymond ran from 1996 to 2005 for nine seasons, with a cast that included Romano, Boyle, Patricia Heaton, Brad Garrett and Doris Roberts. The show would go on to win 15 Emmys, including outstanding comedy series, outstanding lead actress in a comedy series for Heaton, outstanding supporting actor in a comedy series for Garrett and outstanding supporting actress in a comedy series for Roberts. Boyle, meanwhile, received seven Emmy nominations for his grouchy portrayal of Frank Barone. When the actor auditioned for Everybody Loves Raymond in 1996, Boyle's consternation over arriving late actually worked in his favor and helped him land the role. 'Everybody Loves Raymond' stars Brad Garrett, Ray Romano, Doris Roberts, Patricia Heaton and Peter Boyle. CBS “I was ready to pop,” Boyle later told PEOPLE in 1999. “I didn’t plan it that way, but I was just like Frank when I walked in.” But Boyle couldn’t have been more different from his character in real life, his wife Loraine told PEOPLE that same year, describing the actor as \"very intellectual.\" “He can talk about anything from philosophy to politics to history,\" she said. \"With Frank, his character, you get the feeling that he’s mainly interested in the next slice of pizza.” Romano, for his part, now tells PEOPLE that his time on and off-camera with the actor as something of a dream. “It was as surreal as it could be,” he shares. “I'm doing stand-up one day, and the next day, I'm on my own show and Peter Boyle is my buddy.” Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.

    "title": "Nearly 10 million workers in 22 states will see boosts to minimum wage in 2024",
    "text": "Jan. 2 (UPI) -- Minimum wage will increase in 22 states in 2024, while more than a dozen states have stayed put at the federal mark since 2009. About 10 million workers will be affected by the boosted minimum wages that went into effect with the start of the new year Monday, according to a report by the Economic Policy Institute . Hispanic workers represent about 19.6% of the workforce in states increasing the minimum wage. Yet they make up 37.9% of the workers that will experience wage increases. Black workers are 9% of those workforces and represent more than 11% of those affected. States that are raising the minimum wage are doing so through either legislation or ballot measures. Thirteen states have policies in place to adjust minimum wage based on inflation. This includes raising wages for hourly workers and workers whose wages include tips. States increasing minimum wage Missouri is increasing its minimum by $0.30 from $12 to $12.30. Tipped workers' minimum will increase from $6 to $6.15. It will be the 11th time that Missouri's minimum wage has gone up since 2013. Of the 22 states enacting an increase, Hawaii's is the biggest in both percentage and dollars. Starting on Monday, the state's minimum wage will increase from $12 to $14. It will increase from $11 to $12.75 for tipped workers. The increase was approved with the passage of Act 114 in Hawaii's 2022 legislative session. Wages began incrementally increasing since it was enacted on Oct. 1, 2022. Hawaii is one of several states that have enacted a policy through legislation to increase the minimum wage incrementally in coming years to meet or surpass $15 per hour. Hawaii's increase will be one of the most impactful as well. According to the report from the Economic Policy Institute, 21.8% of the state's workforce will be affected, along with 28.4% of its children. California, New York and New Jersey's increases will also impact 19% of their workforces or more. Illinois' legislature passed the phased minimum wage increase in 2019 and the Jan. 1 increase will be the sixth increase with one more coming in 2025. Minimum wage will increase by $1 from $13 to $14, and from $7.80 to $8.40 for tipped workers. Jason Keller, director of the Illinois Department of Labor, told UPI that increasing the wages of workers is a direct way to boost state and local economies. Often a minimum wage increase encourages employers to raise the wages of other workers to keep ahead of the minimum as well. \"That's simple math,\" Keller said. \"It does infuse the economy with more funds, and businesses will hopefully see better business.\" Some local governments are taking extra steps to keep wages above the state minimum. Thirty-eight cities and counties are doing so, including Flagstaff, Ariz.; Cupertino, San Diego, Santa Clara and Oakland, Calif.' Denver, Colo., Seattle, Wash. and Minnesota's Twin Cities. Standard of living The state-level increases come as the federal government has held minimum wage firm at $7.25, despite increased costs of living and rapidly growing housing costs. Congress has engaged in some debate over the years about increasing minimum wage to $15 per hour to no avail. Most recently, some lawmakers have pushed for minimum wage to be increased to $17 by 2028. \"The $7.25 an hour federal minimum wage is a starvation wage. It must be raised to a living wage -- at least $17 an hour,\" Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said in a statement on the Raise the Wage Act of 2023. \"At a time of massive income and wealth inequality and record-breaking corporate profits, we can no longer tolerate millions of workers being unable to feed their families because they are working for totally inadequate wages.\" Richard Von Glahn, political director with the nonpartisan workers advocacy group Missouri Jobs With Justice, told UPI that the change makes a significant difference in the standard of living for the lowest paid workers. \"We've all seen how prices have gone up over the last 18 months to two years,\" he said. \"Those workers see a real decrease in their standard of living if the minimum wage is not raised. We can see, not just improvement in those individual workers' lives by not having to choose between paying the utility bill and rent at the end of the month. We also see improvement for the entire Missouri economy.\" According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, $7.25 in 2023 has the buying power of $5.12 in 2009. In short, while the minimum wage has remained stagnant it is worth less than ever before. Ballot measures sparked the increases in Nebraska and Missouri. Florida raised its minimum wage in September with the support of voters as well. Nebraska's increase will be the second largest in 2024 bringing wages up $1.50 from $10.50 to $12 per hour. There is no increase for tipped workers whose minimum wage remains at $2.13 per hour. 'Now we're a laggard' The average minimum wage among the 22 states with increases coming is $13.36. A person making this wage working full time would make $27,805.81 annually. They would have to work 40 hours every week to earn this, meaning they would not be taking time off from their full-time schedule. \"Those wages are still not enough to get by,\" Mike Owen, deputy director of nonpartisan workers advocacy group Common Good Iowa, told UPI. \"You're still going to need extra supports. But it sure is a lot more helpful than $7.25 which also puts more pressure on those public services.\" Iowa is one of more than a dozen states to keep its minimum wage at $7.25. Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina and Tennessee have not adopted a minimum wage, instead defaulting to the federal level. Georgia and Wyoming have a minimum wage below $7.25, so the federal minimum takes precedence. At one time Iowa was ahead of the curve, Owen said. The state increased its minimum wage up to $7.25 in two phases about a year before Congress increased it at the federal level. \"Now we're a laggard,\" Owen said. \"It's obscenely low where we are right now. It's one of the many ways we're going out of our way to not do things that make this an attractive state to live and work.\" Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and other lawmakers in the state have commented on Iowa's struggle to retain workers in recent years. Meanwhile, neighboring states are finding their higher wages starting with the minimum wage to be powerful tools to recruit and retain workers. \"If workers want to live in states like Missouri or Nebraska or Illinois because they can have a more economically sustaining life, where do you think businesses are going to want to go?\" Von Glahn said. \"It's not hard to get people to come work if you're going to pay a decent wage and have different benefits.\" Minimum wage increases are generally popular among voters. According to the Pew Research Center, about 62% of Americans support a $15 federal minimum wage . Four counties in Iowa had either enacted an increased minimum wage or approved raising it in 2017. The state legislature overruled their local decisions, passing House File 295 prohibiting counties and cities superseding the state's minimum wage. Democrats in both chambers opposed the act, along with Republican Rep. Bobby Kaufmann. Democrats proposed raising the statewide minimum wage to $10.75 to keep all cities and counties in step with the state. Owen said there are \"vocal legislators\" who still support a wage increase and if one were given an \"honest debate\" it would pass. He is not sure what the dollar amount that could pass would be. \"This is not something where a legislator from either party is going to lose votes,\" he said. \"Everybody wins with this issue. That includes the business lobby who opposes it. When more people have money in their pockets that helps those businesses. It's a win-win issue. In Iowa, we choose not to play the game.\" Sen. Herman Quirmbach, D-Ames, has served in the state senate since 2003. He told UPI that he worked his first job for a minimum wage of $1.60 in 1968. That wage would have the buying power of $14.08 as of November. He said he was one of the \"highest-paid federal minimum wage workers in U.S. history,\" because the buying power for minimum wage was never higher. Quirmbach added that he would support raising the minimum wage to $14.08. \"One general ethical standard is we should do better by our kids than we had it,\" Quirmbach told UPI. \"My parents' generation, which Tom Brokaw correctly labeled the greatest generation, were willing to pay taxes to make college affordable at the level that I just indicated. \"I'm 73. My generation is the one out of the group that seems unwilling to make the same educational opportunities affordable.\" he continued. \"Even adjusted for inflation we're not close. We're making life harder on the younger generation.\"",
