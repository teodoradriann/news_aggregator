As a result, water pumping was stopped.\nKarnataka Power Transmission Corporation Limited (KPTCL) and BWSSB staff succeeded in eliminating the technical problem by carrying out emergency repair work, he added.\n“Pumping was stopped for about 10 hours due to power failure. Now the water pumping process has started. Due to the 10-hour shutdown, there is a possibility of disruption in water supply in some areas of the city. The board is yet to get a report on areas impacted during these 10 hours,” said an official, adding that as it happened at night, there was not much impact.\nOn Wednesday, Bengaluru recorded heavy rain, measuring 20.7mm, accompanied by thunder and lightning.
