    "title": "Farmers should do natural farming on part of land govt to give subsidies for initial losses Chouhan - The Week",
    "text": "Lucknow, Jul 19 (PTI) Union agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Friday asked farmers to carry out natural farming in at least one part of their farms and the government will give subsidies for their crop losses for initial two years.\n In the initial two years, when farmers practice natural farming, the yield will be less and in such a situation the government will give subsidies, Chouhan said at a programme on natural farming here.\n UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Gujarat Governor Acharya Devvrat were also present at the programme -- 'Praakritik kheti ki vigyaan par kshetreey paraamarsh karyakram'.\n \"While fulfilling the prime minister's dream of saving mother earth from chemicals, we will try our best to ensure that in the coming times, farmers do chemical-free farming, so that the coming generations remain healthy,\" Chouhan said.\n He said that farmers will get 1.5 times more price by selling grains, fruits and vegetables grown through natural farming.\n The Union minister also said that laboratories will be set up in the agricultural universities of the country to facilitate research on natural farming, which will help in filling the food reserves of the country.\n At least one crore farmers will be made aware about natural farming so that they can go to every corner of the country and promote it, he said, adding that the central government will carry out a nation-wide awareness campaign in consultation with all the stakeholders.\n In his address, Gujarat Governor Devvrat said natural farming requires less water and is very beneficial for farmers.",

    "text": "BILLINGS — The [national healthcare shortage](https://www.ktvq.com/news/local-news/montana-employers-trying-to-engage-high-schoolers-into-healthcare-to-fill-shortage) continues with population growth and aging identified as primary drivers for the increasing need, according to the [Association of American Medical Colleges](https://www.aamc.org/news/press-releases/new-aamc-report-shows-continuing-projected-physician-shortage). In Billings, [Rocky Vista University](https://www.ktvq.com/news/local-news/rocky-vista-university-welcomes-first-students-to-billings) is getting ready to celebrate its first graduating class. On Wednesday and Thursday, the school [welcomed back the annual Montana HOSA conference](https://www.ktvq.com/news/local-news/montana-employers-trying-to-engage-high-schoolers-into-healthcare-to-fill-shortage), bringing in high school students from across the state to apply learned skills in real-world scenarios. The healthcare industry is the fastest-growing in Montana and is expected to add more than 1,300 jobs each year, [according to Montana HOSA](https://montanahosa.org/). \"As far as I can remember, if somebody asked me what I wanted to do, I wanted to be a doctor,” said Boston Macdonald, a sophomore at Billings West High School attending the Montana HOSA conference, on Thursday. \"As I got older, I just found myself being infatuated with the idea of maybe going into surgery or doing research in neurology. I think it’s a very interesting thing.\" Montana is home to hundreds of high schoolers interested in entering the healthcare field: \"In the future, I’d like to go into neuroscience or maybe neurosurgery,” Macdonald said. \"I'm actually attending Columbia this fall. I’ll be pursuing a degree in public policy and trying to tie public health into that,” said Jack Milroy, a senior at Billings Central Catholic High School attending the conference, on Thursday. But nationwide, [a predicted shortage of up to 86,000 physicians](https://www.aamc.org/news/press-releases/new-aamc-report-shows-continuing-projected-physician-shortage) could happen over the next 12 years, which makes these students a rare breed. \"Looking at NASA and things that they’re doing with astronauts, there’s different neurosciences that go into, like, building helmets for space exploration,\" Macdonald said. \"Like Mars, if we ever do send people to Mars, there would have to be neurostimulants in helmets. So that’s always infatuating.\" Macdonald has long been on the receiving end of healthcare and knows in a rural state like Montana, access can be a challenge. \"Just from my own medical experience, since it’s more of a rural area, there’s not many advanced medical capacities here,\" Macdonald said. \"So it’s very common for people to have to go to Minneapolis, or even places like Denver, Colorado, like I have.\" She recently beat lung cancer. \"I’ve been in remission for a little over a year,” said Macdonald. Now she’s focusing on the future and how she can make a difference. \"It interests me to help people,” said Macdonald. Which is exactly what Montana HOSA State Director Katie Meier loves to see. \"These events are just so exciting to see the kids excelling and really working hard,” Meier said on Thursday. \"We’re growing exponentially and we’re doing that with a lot of support.\" [Montana HOSA](https://montanahosa.org/) held its annual state leadership conference at Rocky Vista in 2023 and returned this year. \"Most of the students here have expressed interest in healthcare and spend this whole school year kind of in their local communities working on those skills,” Meier said. \"(We're) trying to help kids gain the technical and soft skills to kind of fill some of our healthcare shortages.\" It’s a way to bring the students into the community and hopefully convince them to stay. \"When you think about a lot of our rural areas, you know our kids don’t have access even probably to a hospital within 100 miles of them. And so it’s that exposure piece of just kind of getting to see all of that and then hopefully having them return into these communities where we have a hard time hiring healthcare providers,” Meier said. “I think we want (students) to go wherever they’re happy but we hope that they would be happy here.\" Luckily, students like Milroy and Macdonald are working to change that. “Fifty-two of our 56 counties are in a deficit for healthcare workers,\" Milroy said. \"I definitely want to go out of state for my education and then try to come back and try to alleviate that deficit.\" \"I'd love to come back to Billings,\" Macdonald said. \"It would be nice to just come here and help expand the medical field for other people.\" To learn more about Montana HOSA, [click here.](https://montanahosa.org/) To learn more about Ricky Vista University, [click here.](https://www.rvu.edu/mcom/)",

On Oct. 7, the militant group Hamas launched an attack that killed around 1,200 Israelis. Since then, more than 30,000 have been killed in the fighting, most of them civilians in Gaza. The group Jewish Louisvillians for Peace held a panel to talk about the Jewish perspective and call for the violence to stop. “We want to provide a space where Jews and people who are committed to remaining in relationship with Jews despite the intensity and the horror of these times are able to discuss things with each other and be in the community and share thoughts and feelings and hope for the future,” Siera Hanks of Jewish Louisvillians for Peace said. More than 100 people signed up for the panel. Some of the notable speakers were former Congressman John Yarmuth and two UofL professors, one of which is a former Israel Defense Forces officer.

    "title": "CNN Reveals ‘Burned’ Pro-Trump Lawyer Dishing Dirt on ‘Haphazard’ Fake Electors’ Plot Involving GOP Senator",
    "text": "CNN’s Marshall Cohen on Thursday detailed exclusive reporting on pro-Trump election lawyer Kenneth Chesebro revealing new details to Michigan prosecutors about the 2020 Trump campaign’s efforts to use fake electors to overturn the 2020 presidential election. Chesebro was indicted alongside Trump in the Georgia election case, but has since pleaded guilty to one felony count and accepted a plea bargain requiring him to testify against Trump and the other remaining defendants. Bianna Golodryga introduced the new reporting, saying, “We start with breaking news in our law and justice lead. CNN has obtained exclusive recordings that reveal a chaotic last-ditch effort by former President Trump’s campaign to get fake elector ballots to D.C. They were trying to get the fake ballots to former Vice President Mike Pence in a final push to overturn the 2020 election.” “The plan involved a haphazard chain of messengers, staffers for two sitting Republican members of Congress, and talk of even chartering a private jet. All of this to ensure the fake ballots from Michigan and Wisconsin got to the Capitol in time for the Electoral College certification on January 6th, 2021. Emails and recordings show new context in the dizzying scope of the unsuccessful fake electors’ plot,” Golodryga said as she introduced Cohen. “Hey, Bianna. We’ve known bits and pieces of this story, but now we’re getting the full picture. And it comes from Ken Chesebro, who in many ways was the architect of the fake electors’ plot. CNN has obtained recordings of his recent interview with Michigan investigators and hundreds of emails that he also turned over. They are revealing the last-minute scramble on the eve of January 6th to get those fake certificates to Washington, DC,” Cohen began before playing a clip of Chesebro: The general counsel, the Trump campaign is freaked out that Roman reported that the Michigan votes are still in the sorting facility in Michigan, which doesn’t look like they’re going to get to Pence in time. So the the general counsel, the campaign was alarmed and was chartering, they didn’t have to charter a jet, but they did commercial. This is like, yes. So this is a high-level decision to get the Michigan and Wisconsin votes, too. And they had to enlist, you know, a U.S. senator, too, to try to expedite it, to get it get it to Pence in time. “Remember, they needed to get those ballots to the House floor because they wanted Mike Pence to throw out Biden’s real electors and replace them with Trump’s fake electors. So in the end, the campaign didn’t need to charter a jet. Staffers booked last-minute tickets on commercial flights, but they ferried those ballots to Washington, D.C. on January 5th. And once they got to D.C., there was a series of handoffs and couriers that even included some help from Senator Ron Johnson’s office. Those ballots eventually reached the U.S. Capitol in time, but Pence’s team said they didn’t want him. He refused to go along with the plan,” Cohen added. “Fascinating new detail. Marshall, how does this all factor into Jack Smith’s criminal case against Trump ?” Golodryga asked. Cohen noted the details were briefly referenced in Smith’s indictment and help to show the scope of the pro-Trump effort to keep him in power. Golodryga then asked why Chesebro is suddenly dished all the dirt. “He’s upset. You know, he thinks he got burned. And it is true that some Trump campaign lawyers told the January 6th Committee that they basically washed their hands of the fake electors’ plot. But the emails that we’ve obtained show that at least some of them were involved in the 11th-hour discussions about how to get the ballots to Pence. Here’s Chesebro again, telling Michigan prosecutors basically that in his view, he was thrown under the bus.,” Cohen replied, before playing another clip: To have the three top campaign lawyers in interviews with Congress claim they pulled out of this on December 11th. And I ran off and did it with Giuliani, when in fact, they were day by day coordinating the efforts of more than a dozen people with the GOP and with the Trump campaign, for them to basically say they had nothing to do with it. And it’s because of me and Giuliani is that’s what really rankles. So I could have avoided all that. So it’s been a it’s been a real lesson in not working with people that you don’t know and you’re not sure you can trust because it really went south on me. “Bianna, he says he learned the hard way and that’s probably why he’s now cooperating with criminal prosecutors in Michigan, Wisconsin and other key states where they tried to pull this off,” Cohen concluded .

    "text": "The future of our environment and our climate depends on the actions we take today, with the full participation of our children, the Principal Secretary Ministry of Environment Dr. Festus Ng’eno has said.\nThe PS was speaking Thursday morning during a media breakfast that hosted journalists and stakeholders to discuss children’s participation in climate action and share the roadmap for the First Lady Mazingira Awards 1st Award Ceremony.\nThe FLAMA ceremony will take place during Mazingira Day on October 10th at the Kenyatta International Conference Centre starting at 11:00 AM, where the First Lady of Mama Rachel Ruto will award the winners.\nThe First Lady Mazingira Awards is an initiative mooted during the Africa Climate Summit 2023 that allows learners to contribute to Kenya’s climate action through creative expression, essays in English and Kiswahili, drawing and painting, and spoken word.\nPS Ng’eno, announcing the inaugural award ceremony, urged young learners to seize the opportunity to become the planet’s defenders and engage communities in meaningful discussions on conservation and climate resilience.\nAccording to PS Ng’eno, FLAMA provides an exceptional platform where young learners who represent the future of Kenya can express their creativity, solutions, and understanding of the pressing environmental and climate challenges we face.\nSimilarly, he noted that through art, creative writing, and spoken word, learners have the opportunity to become vocal advocates for the planet, engaging their communities in meaningful discussions about conservation and climate resilience.\n“Through FLAMA, we are witnessing the seeds of change being planted, and with these efforts, we will secure a sustainable future for our nation.” He said.\nOn her part, the Chief Executive Officer MaMa Doing Good Elizabeth Koskei remarked that climate change is not an abstract issue but an everyday reality, especially for children.\nChief Executive Officer MaMa Doing Good, Elizabeth Koskei “With 18 million learners in our country, children are at the heart of our society, and they must be central to our planning and national agenda.” Koskei remarked.\nAdding that: “The First Lady’s Mazingira Awards falls under children’s participation, ensuring that learners across Kenya regardless of their abilities, location, or background are actively engaged in climate action.”\nShe said that inclusivity is at the heart of the initiative, engaging learners of all abilities, including those from special needs and marginalized schools, ensuring they have a stake in the national climate agenda.\nChildren are the most vulnerable victims of climate change, especially in Kenya’s vast arid and semi-arid regions. And yet, despite their vulnerability, children understand these challenges in ways we sometimes overlook.\nThe participants called on all to listen to children’s voices, as they understand the challenges they face noting that raising awareness of the critical issues of climate change and environmental protection, especially among children, is essential and calls for all to work together.",

    "text": "New research has identified when humans likely began speaking much earlier than previously thought.\nA study by British archaeologist Steven Mithen indicates that early humans may have started using basic language around 1.6 million years ago, probably in eastern or southern Africa. Mithen, professor at the University of Reading, underlines the importance of this discovery. He explains that our ability to speak was an important step in our evolution. Understanding when language began is key to understanding our past. Until now, many human evolution experts believed that humans began speaking around 200,000 years ago. However, Mithen’s latest research, published this month, calls this into question. According to his study, basic human language may be at least eight times older than previously thought. Mithen came to this conclusion after carefully examining archaeological finds, ancient bones, genetic data, brain studies and language research. When we look at all the evidence, it points to the birth of language and other changes in human evolution between two and a half million years ago. Starting around 2 million BC, the human brain began to rapidly enlarge, especially after 1.5 million BC. Along with this growth came changes in the way the brain was organized internally. A fundamental change was the emergence of a specific area in the frontal lobe, called Broca’s area. This part of the brain is closely linked to both the production and comprehension of language.\nScientists believe that Broca’s area evolved from earlier brain structures used by early humans to communicate through hand and arm gestures. This suggests a shift from physical gestures to spoken language as the primary mode of communication. Recent scientific studies suggest that the development of Broca’s area is linked to the strengthening of working memory, essential for the construction of sentences. However, many other evolutionary changes played a vital role in the emergence of basic language. About 1.8 million years ago, a more sophisticated form of upright walking, known as bipedalism, emerged. This change, along with alterations in the shape of the human skull, likely initiated adjustments in the shape and position of the vocal tract. The adjustments were important to enable speech, as reported by The Independent. Further evidence supporting the idea that humans began speaking around 1.6 million BC comes from archaeological finds. Unlike many animals, humans were not particularly strong. To survive despite this physical limitation, they had to find other means to do so.",

Ahora los investigadores finalmente han resuelto el misterio de años de las focas decapitadas: los coyotes costeros. En una cámara de vida silvestre instalada el año pasado cerca de la colonia de focas en el Parque Estatal MacKerricher, el ecólogo Frankie Gerraty observó a un coyote decapitando a su presa.\nEtiquetas\ndepredador\nfoca común\ndecapitación\ncerebro\ncoyote\nmenéalo\n1\nDE3C548D-E347-406A-A60F-E6BBD322CAB7\n7\n0\nCopiar enlace\nCompartir en X\nCompartir en facebook\nCompartir en telegram\nEmbed\nVoto negativo\nMás información\n<!– /10377667/MNA21-STORY-ROBA1 –>\nComunidad destacada de hoy\nTemazos\nTemazos\n<!– /10377667/MNA21-STORY-MEGA1 –>\n<!– /10377667/MNA21-STORY-ROBA1 –>\nLoguéate si deseas escribir\ncomentarios.
