    "title": "Minnesota Teamsters Ratify Powerful New Contract at Sysco - International Brotherhood of Teamsters",
    "text": "(MINNEAPOLIS) – Following a credible strike threat, more than 230 drivers and warehouse workers at Sysco have ratified a strong new four-year collective bargaining agreement. The contract, secured by Teamsters Local 120, includes a 30 percent wage increase, expanded vacation time, increased pension contributions, and Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a paid holiday. The agreement also includes strong strike protections and new language to guard against job loss from automation.\n“We made it clear to Sysco we were ready to walk if they didn’t come to the table with a fair contract,” said Andy Ketcher, a Sysco driver and Local 120 steward. “Because we stood together, we won a deal that rewards our hard work and gives us the respect we deserve.”\nSysco is one of the largest and most profitable food service companies in the United States. In 2024, it reported $1.95 billion in net profits — up more than 10 percent from the year prior. Just days before the deal, Local 120 members voted unanimously to authorize a strike , pressuring Sysco to return with a contract that reflects its record profits.\n“This is a huge win for our members and their families,” said Brandon Brink, a Local 120 business agent. “Our members stood tall and didn’t back down in the face of corporate greed. That solidarity delivered real results.”\nTeamsters Local 120 proudly represents over 15,000 workers in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, North Dakota, and South Dakota.

    "title": "‘Disaster Waiting to Happen’: FDA Approves Phase 1 Trial of Gates-funded Self-amplifying Bird Flu Vaccine",
    "text": "Clinical trials — funded by the U.S. government and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation — are set to begin for a self-amplifying mRNA vaccine targeting the H5N1 bird flu virus.\nArcturus Therapeutics announced earlier this week that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a “Study Can Proceed” notification for its investigational ARCT-2304 vaccine candidate.\nEpidemiologist Nicolas Hulscher told The Defender the FDA’s notification “means Arcturus Therapeutics can begin its “experiment of injecting humans with H5N1 bird flu replicon mRNA.”\nSelf-amplifying mRNA injections contain an enzyme that instructs the body on how to make more mRNA. Arcturus says the vaccine is “formulated within a lipid nanoparticle” and “is designed to make many copies of mRNA within the host cell.” This enables “lower doses than conventional mRNA vaccines.”\nHulscher said the replication machinery of self-amplifying vaccines behaves “like a synthetic virus” and “allows for an unknown period of toxic antigen production.”\nWriting on Substack, immunologist and biochemist Jessica Rose, Ph.D., said the new vaccine has “major red flags.” She told The Defender, “Self-amplifying mRNA products should not be used. This is an absolute disaster waiting to happen.”\nAccording to Karl Jablonowski, Ph.D., senior research scientist at Children’s Health Defense, “Arcturus’ self-replication platform has all the hazards of the other synthetic modified mRNA wrapped in a lipid nanoparticle, just much worse. With self-replication it can become immortal, forever antagonizing your — or your fetus’ — immune system with antigens.”\nChristof Plothe, D.O., a member of the World Council for Health steering committee, questioned the introduction of self-amplifying mRNA vaccines amid ongoing safety concerns about conventional mRNA shots. He told The Defender:\n“The self-replicating technology takes the mRNA vaccines to a new level. The vaccine contains the gene for the spike protein and the gene for a protein called replicase, which allows the RNA to replicate.\n“After the rollout of the first global genetic experiment with mRNA technology … it seems unbelievable that an even more aggressive attack on our body and genetics should be tried out.”\nOn Substack, Rose wrote that self-amplifying vaccines are genetically modified, as “the coding template is a modified Alphavirus [a type of RNA virus] genome with the virus sub-genomic bits spiked out and the spike gene ‘spiked in.’”\n“Use of GMOs [genetically modified organisms] require specific licensing application and procedures,” Rose wrote, questioning whether this is the case for self-amplifying vaccines.\nSmall dose of replicon mRNA likely ‘more hazardous’ than larger dose of conventional mRNA shot\nArcturus’ Phase 1 clinical trial will enroll approximately 200 healthy adults in the U.S.\nRose questioned the clinical trial’s enrollment criteria. She said the criteria include a warning to “childbearers” to wear condoms when engaging in intercourse during the trial period. People who experienced “significant adverse reactions” to the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are excluded from enrollment.\nDespite Japan’s recent inclusion of a self-amplifying COVID-19 vaccine among the routine vaccines it offers to older adults during this year’s cold and flu season, Hulscher said trials for that vaccine revealed significant safety signals.\nIn clinical trials for the self-amplifying COVID-19 vaccine offered in Japan, “five deaths occurred among the injected in study phase 3b. Injected participants experienced a 90% adverse event rate (74.5% systemic, 15.2% required medical attention) after the first dose in study phases 1, 2, and 3a combined,” Hulscher said.\nHulscher said Arcturus’ claims that vaccines using self-amplifying mRNA technology create the impression that those vaccines will be safer. He argued that this would not be the case.\n“Because they self-replicate for an unknown period of time, a small dose of a replicon mRNA is expected to be more hazardous than a larger dose of conventional mRNA,” Hulscher said.\nAccording to Jablonowski:\n“The difference between medicine and poison is dose — and you cannot dose the mRNA vaccines. Arcturus promotes ‘smaller doses’ as a feature, but the reality is that we have never been able to measure the antigen exposure from an mRNA vaccine.\n“Even if we had a theory of how many protein antigens were produced per mRNA strand, we would never know how many times the mRNA self-replicated.”\nJablonowski said other risks of self-amplifying vaccines include shedding and possible hybridization with other viruses.\n“It’s possible for exosomes to escape the human ‘host’ and transmit — or ‘infect’ — other humans or even animals,” Jablonowski said. “A scary scenario involves hybridization where the self-replicating mRNA could be incorporated into an existing infectious virus. … If the self-replicating mRNA teams up with a successful existing virus, it will alter Earth’s virome.”\nHulscher called for the withdrawal of all self-amplifying mRNA shots. He said:\n“These experimental injections must not receive further regulatory approval for humans or animals if we are to prevent another public health disaster. All self-amplifying mRNA injections currently available for humans and animals should be immediately withdrawn until comprehensive, long-term safety studies are conducted.”\nHowever, Hulscher said, Big Pharma is pushing for their continued development. “With at least 33 self-amplifying mRNA injection candidates in development, they have invested far too much time and money to back off,” Hulscher said.\nDo you have a news tip? We want to hear from you!\nGates, Biden administration funding research into self-amplifying vaccines\nThe FDA’s “Study Can Proceed” notification comes amid recent warnings that bird flu might cause the next pandemic.\nArcturus noted that the clinical study is funded by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) — a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) responsible for developing medical countermeasures.\n“Arcturus is actively engaged with the U.S. government to prepare for the next pandemic,” Joseph Payne, president and CEO of Arcturus Therapeutics, said in the company’s statement. “Self-amplifying mRNA technology is a key step in this important process.”\nNot mentioned in Arcturus’ press release is a 13-month, $928,563 grant the company received last month from the Gates Foundation for “vaccine development.”\nThe Gates Foundation has supported mRNA bird flu vaccine research, including funding several studies and journal papers in the field in recent years.\nIn May, the foundation granted Imperial College London $227,360 “to investigate the translational relevance of self-amplifying RNA platform for rotavirus vaccine candidates.”\nThe Biden administration has funded several initiatives to develop mRNA bird flu vaccines, including self-amplifying vaccines.\nThis article was funded by critical thinkers like you.\nThe Defender is 100% reader-supported. No corporate sponsors. No paywalls. Our writers and editors rely on you to fund stories like this that mainstream media won’t write.\nIn July, BARDA awarded Moderna $176 million for late-stage development and testing of an mRNA bird flu vaccine. Last year, three companies received funding under Project NextGen, an HHS initiative, for the “rapid development of the next generation of vaccines and treatments.”\nOne of these companies, Gritstone Bio, received $433 million “to conduct a mid-stage study of its self-amplifying mRNA COVID-19 vaccine candidate.”\nExperts who spoke with The Defender expressed concern about the involvement of government agencies like BARDA and private organizations like the Gates Foundation in developing these vaccines.\n“Are we seeing the next lab creation to create global fear and suppression?” asked Plothe.\nRose addressed Arcturus’ statement that it is developing “a mRNA-based platform for pandemic influenza vaccine development” — that “may make vaccines available much sooner than egg- and cell-based technologies.”\n“Why is the word ‘Pandemic’ in the title?” Rose asked on Substack. “It is more likely than not that this is the priming of/grooming of the public for the next ‘planned pandemic.’”\nIn 2022, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations — funded by the Gates Foundation — launched its “100 Day Mission,” to build the infrastructure for the development of a new vaccine within 100 days of the onset of a future pandemic.",

    "text": "The elegance of the Italians is well known, and now the astronauts They will be able to show off that distinction and style also in the Moon . Although they have already been presented, the new jumpsuits designed by the Italian firm Prada for astronauts, they will not participate in a space mission until 2026. The fashion house teamed up with the space company Axiom Space to create the suits that, logically, offer, in addition to a much more attractive aesthetic, the security needed to return to space. step on the moon\nAs revealed by the Axiom Space company during the International Astronautical Congress held in Milan, the astronauts Those who travel to the Moon in 2026 will do so with “more comfortable and aesthetic suits.” The jumpsuits that they will wear have been made by the Italian fashion house Prada in collaboration with this space company. “Prada’s expertise has enabled the use of advanced technologies and innovative stitching methods to bridge the gap between high engineering and an aesthetically appealing white exterior, offering astronauts a greater comfort and at the same time improving the performance of the materials «, according to a statement from Axiom Space.\nSpace company Axiom Space partnered with the Italian luxury brand to provide the surface suits and spacewalk systems for astronauts participating in the mission to the Atemisa III moon, scheduled for 2026. As explained in the statement issued, along with the first images of the suits, the outer layer of the space suit, designed to reflect heat, is largely white part, as it was in the suits worn by the Apollo astronauts who walked on the Moon more than 50 years ago.\nThe jumpsuit designed by Prada that will travel to the Moon in 2026.\nReuters\nThe new ones will have some modifications: such as touches of gray and some red stripes similar to those seen on Italy’s Luna Rossa America’s Cup boat, which was also designed by Prada. Matt Ondler, president of Axiom Space, commented during the presentation that the manufacture of the suit had required “extreme engineering” and “fantastic manufacturing capacity” . “They will go to places that are incredibly dangerous, extreme environments,” he said. He added that “one of the missions that NASA wants to do is to try to find water craters at the South Pole, one of the coldest places in the universe. And that’s why this suit has to be designed very intelligently.”\nThe suit aims to provide maximum comfort to astronauts, while protecting them against radiation, external pressure and providing them with the energy and oxygen they need to perform up to eight hours of moonwalks. Since he is expected to participate in the mission the first woman to step on the moon, the suits are unisex and can be adapted to different sizes.\n“We have combined engineering, science and art to produce the ultimate garments for future moonwalkers, ensuring astronauts can perform their tasks and missions safely and comfortably,” said Russell Ralston, director of the Axiom spacesuit program.\nAs explained in the statement, the design of the boots was a particular challenge, in terms of insulation and making them durable enough for the terrain. But the materials used are « confidential “said Lorenzo Bertelli, Prada’s marketing director and son of the fashion house’s founder, Miuccia Prada.\n#Haute #couture #reaches #Moon #Italian #brand #Prada",
