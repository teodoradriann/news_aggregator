    "text": "Would you like to subscribe to our newsletter? A BC teacher admitted to the provincial regulator he called a student's hijab a Halloween costume while substituting for another teacher's class. The Surrey school district suggested he take sensitivity training, but now the BC Commissioner for Teacher Regulation ordered him to take a course before the end of August, according to a recent decision. The decision comes more than a year after Donald Joseph Camozzi filled in for a grade 10 class in Surrey the day after Halloween in 2022. In front of the class, he asked one of the students if she went trick-or-treating, to which she said no and that her family doesn't celebrate Halloween. READ MORE: Kamloops mayor says BC Ambulance expanding in city \"That's a nice Halloween costume, mine is better than yours,\" he responded, according to the decision. He was comparing his shirt and tie to the student's hijab. She responded to say her hijab was not a costume, telling him to stop and that his remark was not funny. One classmate said they thought it was funny, which Camozzi echoed to the hijab-wearing student. Other students spread word of the incident around the school, according to the decision. READ MORE: BC teacher throws object at student, tries to convince student not to tell The Surrey school district issued Camozzi a letter of discipline on Dec. 14, 2022, recommending he take cultural sensitivity training. He never did take the course. In March 2023, the provincial regulator launched an investigation, finally coming to an agreement with Camozzi earlier this month. The commissioner found Camozzi's comments mocking the hijab \"had a negative impact\" on the student. He's \"engaged in similar conduct\" in the past, according to the decision. By Aug. 31, Camozzi is required to complete a course on creating a positive learning environment. If he doesn't, the commissioner may suspend his teaching certificate, which he has held in BC since 1988.

    "text": "Avec les chaleurs, le centre-ville de Dijon est délaissé - Fanny Gelb Dijon est-elle une ville assez ombragée ? La même question se pose à chaque fois que les températures voient rouge. Dans le centre, les zones d'ombre ou de fraîcheur se font rares, à tel point que les habitants l'évitent. La place de la Libération en est l'exemple le plus parlant. Dès que les températures s'affolent à Dijon, les rues du centre-ville se vident. Le sujet revient souvent sur la table : Dijon est-elle assez végétalisée ? Mis à part les parcs et les quelques avenues arborées, le centre, lui, frôle l'inconfort lors des fortes chaleurs. Comme la place de la Libération, dénuée d'arbres ou de point d'ombre. Il est midi place de la Libération. Nicole rase les murs à la recherche d'un peu d'ombre. Depuis plus de 40 ans que la retraitée habite la ville, elle s'est trouvée des trucs et astuces. \"Je ne sors pas de chez moi ! Là je vais me dépêcher de rentrer.\" Normalement, elle ne sort jamais à cette heure. \"Là, c'est exceptionnel ; j'avais des courses à faire.\" Plus d'arbres mais aussi des porches pour apporter de la fraîcheur, voilà ce que propose la Dijonnaise. \"Il nous faut des bâtiments pour avoir de l'ombre, c'est incroyable !\" Insolation garantie Près d'elle, les enfants d'Anne barbotent dans les fontaines rectangles fixées au sol. Ce sont les seuls points de fraîcheur de la place. \"Le fait d'avoir des petits, on fait d'autant plus attention. Même dans les grandes allées où il n'y a pas d'arbres, on essaie de privilégier les petites ruelles\", affirme la jeune femme d'un air entendu. Elle qui dit être très attentive désormais au fait d'avoir toujours un point d'ombre, elle va vite rentrer car \"on est sur les derniers moments où on peut être dehors, avant de se mettre au frais.\" Tout autour de la place en demi-cercle, il y a une ribambelle de restaurants qui amène malgré tout un peu d'ombre grâce à leurs parasols. Ophélie est en train de déjeuner à l'une des terrasses et si elle assure trouver la place très jolie \"s'il n'y avait pas les restaurants et les parasols, je n'y mettrais pas un pied\", assène-t-elle, alors que son plat - une salade bien fraîche - vient d'arriver. C'est David qui lui amène. \"Les gens savent très bien maintenant que dès qu'ils arrivent sur la place, ils se prennent un effet de 10 degrés dans la tête.\" Cela fait plusieurs années que le serveur travaille ici. \"On doit faire en fonction de comment tourne le soleil : entre midi et 17 heures, c'est le plus compliqué.\" Impensable de rester en plein soleil car sinon c'est l'insolation garantie, et le jeune homme a ses méthodes contre la chaleur. \"On boit beaucoup d'eau, on change de vêtements régulièrement ; on s'adapte.\" L'énergique dijonnais regrette qu'il n'y ait pas plus d'arbres sur la place et juge que ça peut être amélioré : \"ça doit être amélioré.\" Des contraintes de patrimoine Du côté de la Ville, on explique pourquoi il est compliqué de planter des arbres en plein centre-ville, les sols ne sont pas forcément adaptés. Par ailleurs, de nombreux réseaux y circulent également \"électriques, d'eau et de gaz\", rappelle l'adjointe au maire en charge des travaux, Dominique Martin-Gendre. Autre problématique, les sites et les immeubles du centre de Dijon doivent être préservés. \"La place de Libération est intouchable\", assène le maire de Dijon, François Rebsamen. Les bâtiments doivent être visibles, pour la \"perspective\". Mais Dijon reste une ville arborée assure l'élu. \"Tous les arbres dans les maisons et les immeubles doivent être pris en compte dans notre patrimoine vert.\" Et de rappeler qu'il n'y a pas une place où il n'y a pas \"soit des arbres, soit de l'eau, soit les deux. Place de Libération, il y a de l'eau et je peux vous dire que les enfants et leur famille en profitent.\" Le matin surement, car dès 13 heures, le centre de la place est désert.

    "text": "FORT JOHNSON, La. — September is suicide prevention month and wrestling my own demons for nearly two months recently got me thinking about how powerful those dark thoughts can be. How difficult it can be to move past a setback.\nI’ve always been a “glass half full” person. A “bloom where you’re planted,” and “lemons to lemonade” type of gal, but an infection and injury the first week of August really got to me! Did I contemplate killing myself – no, I did not – but I did feel like a burden to my family, a nonproductive member of my team, and I was sad, all the time.\nI’ve been thinking a lot about my mental health and the important role it plays in my own physical health and I wanted to put pen to paper to share my experience in hopes of helping others.\nOn Aug. 2, I got an infection in my right hand. I allowed my hand to swell so badly before seeking medical attention on Aug. 4, that it further exacerbated the situation, which I’m still dealing with today.\nArmed with antibiotics and Motrin I tried to carry on as usual after my first trip to the emergency room. I guess I’m stubborn. I’m right-handed and tried to continue working and doing my normal daily duties with my left hand. The pain was almost unbearable. At one point, and during a fit of frustration and rage, I tore my meniscus and did a number on my ankle trying to get out of my Jeep.\nBetween my hand, knee, ankle and the subsequent swelling of most of my right side, I’ve spent the past two months laid up or at medical appointments. The injuries prevented me from doing many of the things I love. I haven’t been able to walk my dogs, cooking meals is difficult, and my garden shriveled up and died.\nI got really, down.\nI recall talking to my colleague who kindly inquired about how I was doing, and I started crying.\nThe simplest tasks: dressing, washing my hair, doing laundry, even petting my dog became arduous, difficult, and painful. I got tired of being asked how I was feeling because it made me angry; not because of them, but because of my own reaction to the questions. I got tired of hearing myself tell the tale. I felt like I was whining. I felt weak. I felt useless. I couldn’t do my job; I couldn’t take care of my home, my family, or my pets. I couldn’t do the things I wanted to do.\nOne day, while working from home in my pajamas, hair a dirty mess, leg elevated, propped up in my bed, I got an email from Capt. James Walker, hospital chaplain for Bayne-Jones Army Community Hospital.\nChaplain Walker sends a daily email to the entire staff at BJACH. This one, sent on Sept. 4 was entitled Word of the Day: Choosing Thoughts and read as follows:\n\"The greatest weapon against stress is our ability to choose one thought over another,” William James. Being mindful of our thought patterns and consciously choosing positive and empowering thoughts can reduce stress and improve our overall well-being. By taking control of our thought processes, we can decrease anxiety and enhance our mental and emotional health. It's important to recognize the power of our thoughts and intentionally maintain a positive mindset for a healthier well-being,” he wrote. “When I am afraid, I put my trust in you.\" - Psalm 56:3.\nI immediately replied, “easier said than done my friend.”\nBut it struck a chord, and it made me realize mind over matter. It got me thinking of the saying mental health is health and motivated me to change my thoughts.\nI had to remind myself that I was injured and would recover. I have friends battling cancer and kidney failure, and I needed to put things in perspective.\nI had to take a good long look in the mirror and figure out what I could do, instead of what I couldn’t do. And I had to live!\nStruggling with my own feelings got me thinking more and more about suicide prevention and how hopeless one must feel to decide to end their own life. Asking for and excepting help can be very hard.\nFor me, I had to hire someone to clean my house, because I couldn’t. I had to hire someone to clean out my chicken coop. When my new neighbor asked me if there was anything she could do, I had to humbly ask her if she could cut my fingernails.\nThe installation director of psychological health, Lt. Col. Alexander Ragan, and I have worked together for the past three years trying to raise awareness about suicide prevention, engage the community about mental health resources, and the targeted care program.\nToday, he wrote a message for a group that struck a chord. He said, “Suicides deeply impact everyone involved, Families, friends, and fellow Soldiers. It's a heartbreaking and frustrating reminder of the silent battles we all face. The anger and grief we feel can sometimes be overwhelming, but it's also an opportunity to remember that no one is alone. We all matter, and no one should ever feel like a burden.”\nRagan suggested that we can honor those we've lost by checking in with two people around us by ask them how they're really doing and listen.\n“If you're struggling, reach out. Let someone know you need support,” he said “Together, we can make a difference. Connecting with one another strengthens us, reminding us that we’re part of something bigger. ‘Connect to protect’—we are always stronger together. Let’s keep looking out for each other.”\nAnd he’s right.\nI didn’t pull myself out the darkness alone.\nMy mom, my husband, my son, my friends, and coworkers checking on me made all the difference.\nIn the beginning, I didn’t realize it, but looking back on this journey and as I get better physically each day, I know it was my relationships that kept me going and helped me regain my positive mental attitude. Their love and concern for me, helped me get over myself and focus on my recovery.\nAm I fully healed? Am I back to my old self? No, not yet, but I’m taking things day by day. I’m grateful for the people around me. I’ve put things in perspective, and I hope my words can help another person.\nMy pride has been my biggest obstacle, talking to the chaplain was my first step to getting my mind right. His word of the day opened an inner dialogue that got me thinking. Learning to lean on others, accepting their help and focusing on the future all helped me pull myself out of the darkness of my own thoughts.\nFor you, it might be a Military and Family Life Counselor, a confidant or family member. Our team in the BJACH Behavior Health department is always available to help or connect you to the resource best suited for you.\nI can attest to the fact that we have a lot of wonderful and caring people in our community. There are a lot of resources available to us when we need it.\nIf you are struggling, be willing to accept help when offered, and don’t be afraid to ask for help occasionally .\nIf you don’t know where to turn call the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, stop by the BJACH Behavioral Health Department located on the 6th Floor of the hospital, visit the main post chapel, or ask to speak to an MFLC at Army Community Service.\nThe views expressed in this article do not necessarily reflect the views of Bayne-Jones Army Community Hospital, the Defense Health Agency, the United States Army, the Department of Defense, or the U.S. government.\nDate Taken: | 09.19.2024 |\nDate Posted: | 09.19.2024 16:05 |\nStory ID: | 481334 |\nLocation: | FORT JOHNSON, LOUISIANA, US |\nHometown: | WAUWATOSA, WISCONSIN, US |\nWeb Views: | 8 |\nDownloads: | 0 |\nThis work, Writer shares experience, accepts help, overcomes challenges, by [Jean Graves](/portfolio/1539897/jean-graves), identified by DVIDS, must comply with the restrictions shown on https://www.dvidshub.net/about/copyright.",

    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "text": "Большой спортивно-музыкальный праздник «Суперниндзя» и мастер-класс по изготовлению котика-обережки провели активисты Школы третьего возраста Многопрофильного социального центра «Содействие». Мероприятие состоялось в рамках регионального проекта «Играем всей семьей!».\nРебятам, проводящим каникулы на пришкольной площадке, предложили поиграть в различные увлекательные игры. Разбившись группами по пять человек, они проходили разные испытания: играли в крестики-нолики, собирали пирамиду в игре «Дженга», угадывали, что в коробке, и собирали башню из бумажных стаканчиков. Дети проявили ум и сноровку, показали себя настоящей дружной командой, готовой участвовать в испытаниях и тренировать выносливость, ловкость, скорость реакции.\nНе меньший интерес вызвал у юных подопечных мастер-класс по изготовлению поделки - домашнего оберега в виде кота. Ребята с помощью активистов «Содействия» раскрасили котика и придали ему настроение. Завершилась программа ярким флешмобом под песню «Само собой». Все участники получили заряд бодрости и веселья.\nЛетние каникулы – отличное время, чтобы отвлечься от гаджетов, поиграть в активные игры, выйти на свежий воздух. Проекту «Играем всей семьёй!» уже больше 10 лет, и за это время он стал любимым у астраханцев разных поколений. Развлекательные программы для юных жителей региона продолжатся до конца сентября.",

    "text": "Maine Connectivity Authority launches ‘Working Internet ASAP’ program BANGOR, Maine (WABI) - There’s about 1.5% of Maine that still doesn’t have internet access technology. That’s according to the Senior Director of program operations at [Maine Connectivity Authority](https://www.maineconnectivity.org/). That’s why they’re launching the Working Internet ASAP program. It’s one of the last steps to provide reliable internet connection to hard-to-reach locations across Maine. “After we conducted our analysis, the locations are really spread across the state,” said Brian Allenby. “There are some concentrations around Aroostook, Penobscot, and Oxford counties. But really there are some locations in every county across the state and so our goal through this program is to make an internet connection available. The option for folks to subscribe.” They will have an enrollment portal open in November on [MCA’s website](https://www.maineconnectivity.org/). If Mainers are curious if their area will qualify, head to their website, review a map and enter information for details. Copyright 2024 WABI. All rights reserved.",
