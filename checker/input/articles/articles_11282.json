    "title": "New Insights into Roflumilast Foam 0.3% for Scalp and Body Psoriasis: ARRECTOR Trial Patient Reported Outcomes",
    "text": "News Article Author(s): Roflumilast foam 0.3% significantly improved psoriasis severity, symptoms, and quality of life in patients with moderate to severe scalp and body psoriasis. A poster1 presented at the [2024 Elevate-Derm West Conference](https://www.dermatologytimes.com/conference/elevate-derm-conference) highlighted data from the phase 3 ARRECTOR trial,2 providing insights on the effectiveness and tolerability of roflumilast (Zoryve; Arcutis) foam 0.3% in patients with moderate to severe scalp and body psoriasis. The data involved patient reported outcomes, including itch and pain measures. Roflumilast, a selective phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor, has shown promise in addressing inflammation and other psoriasis symptoms without the adverse effects often associated with corticosteroids, according to poster authors Gooderham et al. ARRECTOR, or A Randomized tRial Employing topiCal roflumilasT foam to treat scalp psORiasis, was conducted to further understand the safety and efficacy of this nonsteroidal option in a controlled clinical setting. The trial was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study conducted over 8 weeks. A total of 453 adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, including scalp involvement, participated in the study. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either roflumilast foam 0.3% or a vehicle foam in a 2:1 ratio. Key inclusion criteria included a Scalp Investigator's Global Assessment (S-IGA) score of 3 or 4 (indicating moderate or severe psoriasis), a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score less than 5, and an affected Body Surface Area ranging from 2% to 20%. The study’s primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving a clear or almost clear status (S-IGA score of 0 or 1) by week 8. Secondary endpoints included improvements in pruritus, overall symptom severity, quality of life as measured by the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), and patient-reported outcomes. As a result of the study, roflumilast demonstrated significant improvements in psoriasis severity and symptom management with roflumilast foam 0.3%, particularly in the scalp and body regions. A significantly higher percentage of patients treated with roflumilast achieved success in both scalp and body IGA scores (clear or almost clear) by week 8 compared to those receiving the vehicle. At week 8, 65.1% of patients in the roflumilast treatment group achieved a score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) for scalp involvement, compared to only 31.3% in the vehicle group. This difference was statistically significant. For body involvement, 49.8% of patients in the roflumilast group achieved a Body Investigator's Global Assessment, or B-IGA, score of clear or almost clear, versus 21.1% in the vehicle group, with a similar statistically significant difference. Additionally, patients in the roflumilast group reported significant quality of life improvements, as shown by reductions in DLQI scores. Symptom improvement was also notable, particularly for scalp symptoms such as itch, redness, and scaliness. The reduction in scaliness was -12.18 for roflumilast versus -7.36 for the vehicle; redness reduction was -11.96 for roflumilast versus -6.49 for the vehicle; and itch reduction was -12.36 for roflumilast versus -7.58 for the vehicle. Additionally, 70.3% of patients in the roflumilast group achieved a 75% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index, compared to 32.5% in the vehicle group, a difference that was also statistically significant. In terms of safety, 26.3% of patients in the roflumilast group experienced treatment-emergent adverse events, compared to 20.2% in the vehicle group. Both groups reported low rates of serious adverse events, with 0.7% of patients in the roflumilast group and 0.8% in the vehicle group experiencing serious events. The most common adverse events were application site reactions, diarrhea, and nausea, though application site reactions were infrequent, suggesting good local tolerability. Patient-rated local tolerability assessments at baseline, week 2, and week 8 indicated low levels of irritation and discomfort, with average scores remaining below 0.5 across all assessments. “In patients with scalp and body psoriasis, treatment with once-daily roflumilast foam 0.3% demonstrated greater improvement compared with vehicle across multiple patient-reported efficacy endpoints,” wrote Gooderham et al.

    "text": "网友称智行APP买火车票不能线上改签 要退需加钱用“人工跑腿”\n快科技8月14日消息，据媒体报道，近日，有网友发帖称，智行火车票APP买的火车票不能线上改签，要退要花跑腿费，引起大家热议。\n一般情况下，大家在线上购买的车票都可以在手机上进行退票或者改签。\n据悉，该网友前几日通过智行火车票APP购买了深圳北到香港西九龙站的动车票，但因时间原因想改签，却被客服告知需前往线下人工车站办理。\n今日，智行火车票客服表示，目前香港西九龙的车票大多采用线下现金出票方式。\n前端出票分为线上和线下，若遇到线下现金电子票，前端无法直接改签，需通过“人工跑腿”改签。\n由于“人工跑腿”耗时较长，旅客至少要在发车前两小时办理。\n若未能改签成功，则只能前往车站人工窗口办理。\n正常情况下，跑腿改签需支付15元/人的手续费，具体金额以前端展示为准。\n【本文结束】如需转载请务必注明出处：快科技\n责任编辑：哈尔",

    "text": "Geral\nDefesa Civil de SP testa drone de grande porte no combate à dengue\nA Defesa Civil estadual de São Paulo testou, pela primeira vez, um drone de grande porte para a pulverização de larvicidas no combate ao mosquito Aedes aegypti, vetor da dengue, na cidade de Mairiporã, região metropolitana de São Paulo.\nO modelo Agras MG1P, geralmente usado para pulverização agrícola, foi testado em residências com pontos de proliferação do mosquito, como piscinas sujas, locais de acúmulo de lixo, caixas d'água abertas, e em áreas que não atendem a apelos dos agentes de saúde.\nO drone escolhido tem autonomia de voo de 15 e 20 minutos, por bateria, podendo chegar a 50 metros de altura e voar a até um quilômetro do operador. O limite de operação durante o teste foi menor, em torno de 150 metros, uma vez que a região é urbana e há maior risco de interferência. O equipamento carrega até 10 litros de larvicida.\nEmbora Mairiporã tenha baixa incidência da doença (15,9/100 mil habitantes), o município tem imóveis de veraneio em áreas rurais, com terrenos grandes e dificuldade de acesso pelas equipes de saúde, segundo informou Maxwell de Souza, porta-voz da Defesa Civil do Estado de São Paulo.\nO equipamento foi cedido pelo Núcleo de Tecnologia da Casa Militar após agentes de saúde tentarem contato com moradores sem sucesso. Nos locais onde não foi possível contato foi feita uma primeira verificação com drones de observação. Em seguida, o drone foi acionado para pulverização nos imóveis.\nResultado positivo\nEmbora o resultado tenha sido positivo, as equipes estudam o uso de drones menores, mais acessíveis às prefeituras, para aplicação de larvicidas em pastilhas. De acordo com Souza, o governo estadual procura parceiros em órgãos públicos e privados para os testes, que podem servir de base para editais futuros.\nPorém, segundo o porta-voz, mesmo que a estratégia permita acesso a áreas difíceis, a melhor estratégia contra a dengue continua sendo a prevenção feita pela população.\nAté 75% dos criadouros do mosquito ficam dentro das casas, em áreas acessíveis somente para moradores, como caixas d'água, ralos e calhas mal vedados ou com acúmulo de resíduos, lixo acumulado em pequenos pedaços de plástico, como brinquedos ou vasilhames.\nAlém dos cuidados com a limpeza, é importante que a população informe sobre focos do mosquito, por meio do serviço estadual Dengue 100 ou de telefones municipais, como o 153, 156 ou 199.\nMedidas preventivas como limpeza com cloro e uso de areia em pratos de vasos também podem ter impacto positivo.",
