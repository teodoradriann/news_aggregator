    "text": "Representational Image | Arranged\nKochi: In a major blow to travelers, Air India has announced suspension of its Kochi-London service as part of major changes on its London flight schedule for the Northern Summer 2025 (NS25) season.\nKochi-London service will be suspended after March 30, 2025, removing the direct connectivity between Kerala and the UK. Currently, Air India operates flights on the route three times a week.\nIn September 2024, Cochin International Airport Limited (CIAL) launched the direct flight to London as part of a special Onam initiative. To encourage direct flights to Europe, CIAL waived parking and landing charges.\nAir travel between India and the UK became smoother recently when the UK moved India from its red list to amber. Following this, CIAL, Air India, and the Government of Kerala worked together to establish the direct service from Kochi to Europe. Kochi is currently the only airport in Kerala with direct flights to Europe.\nSubscribe to our Newsletter",

    "text": "Concerns escalate regarding the situation of six captives in Gaza, following the discovery of gunshot injuries by the Israeli Defense Forces. The unfortunate event has sparked concerns that more Israeli captives might not return alive, mentioned one demonstrator. \"We need to bring back those we know were still alive,\" Daniel shared with CNN. He expressed that continuing the conflict while negotiations for a truce and hostage swap falter will only lead to more funerals, both for them and us, he added, aging 48. No formal explanation has been provided on how the six perished. IDF declared on Thursday that initial examinations indicate that all six captives had been fired upon, but the exact cause of their demise has yet to be determined. It also pointed out that the findings are provisional. IDF reported discovering four additional deceased individuals near the bodies of the six captives, believed to be Hamas militants who had been holding the captives. However, no signs of bullets were found on their bodies. IDF didn't assign any culprit. Outside Israel's Ministry of Defense, Daniel highlighted that IDF's announcement suggesting all six captives were shot underscores the threats involved in force-based rescue operations. On Tuesday, Israeli outlet Ynet reported early assessments suggested the captives might have succumbed to carbon dioxide inhalation, following IDF strikes on a nearby Hamas target. During a media session on Tuesday, IDF spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari declined to confirm whether the captives were killed due to Israeli military actions. Instead, he referred to a statement he made in June, stating the hostages perished while IDF forces were operating in Khan Younis. The unfortunate incidents reinstated calls for a ceasefire among protesters in Tel Aviv on Thursday. Omer, 46, attending the protest with his two daughters, believed they \"could have been rescued much sooner.\" He accused the Israeli government of delaying the agreement with Hamas, which, he warned, would lead to a more expensive agreement that could have been secured earlier. A ceasefire would also relieve tens of thousands of Palestinians in the blockaded enclave as Israel presses on with its military campaign. United Nations estimated in July that approximately 1.9 million people in the strip had been displaced, which almost equaled the total population of Gaza. However, doubts surround Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's intention to reach a deal due to fierce opposition from right-wing ministers within his coalition. Netanyahu's political fate hinges on his right-wing coalition partners, with some already threatening to abandon the government if he agrees to the deal, potentially leading to its collapse. \"Maybe Hamas captured them (the hostages), but the one we can blame for their murder is Benjamin Netanyahu,\" Omer claimed, adding that the prime minister is \"solely responsible.\" A group representing the families of Israeli hostages, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, criticized Israeli authorities in a statement on Thursday, asserting that the forensic test results suggesting gunshot wounds were \"further evidence of the cruelty of the terrorists\" who kept them captive. The Forum also reiterated its criticism of Israeli authorities, stating that the recovery of bodies was \"no achievement.\" \"It is a testament to the complete failure to strike a deal in time, as six hostages who were expected to return alive instead returned in coffins,\" the Forum said. Israeli officials identified the recovered bodies as belonging to Yoram Metzger, Alexander Dancyg, Avraham Munder, Chaim Peri, Nadav Popplewell, and Yagev Buchshtab on Tuesday. Except for Munder, all the deceased had been previously declared dead by the Israeli military. Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant stated that IDF and ISA had entered Hamas tunnels in a \"complicated operation\" to retrieve their remains. Munder was taken captive along with his wife, daughter, and grandson, who were later released during a temporary truce between Israel and Hamas in November. Munder's son, Roee, was killed during the attack. Nine-year-old Ohad Munder conveyed his feelings to Israel's public broadcast channel Kan 11, stating that the demise of his grandfather and the other captives \"shouldn't have happened.\" \"There have been numerous opportunities for a deal... but then they say no, only to regret it at the last moment. All the hostages could have returned alive from the start. They could have brought back my grandfather and all the other hostages,\" Ohad said. Currently, there are 109 Israeli captives still in Gaza, including 36 thought to be deceased, according to data from the Israeli Government Press Office. The world has expressed sympathy and concern over the tragic loss of the captives, with many calling for a peaceful resolution in the Middle East. Despite the conflicting reports about the cause of death, the discovery of gunshot wounds on some bodies has raised concerns about the role of Hamas militants and the Israeli military in this unfortunate incident.",

    "text": "Chemical accident results in shelter-in-place orders for three-block T.O. neighborhood By TO Acorn Staff on February 21, 2025\nHAZMAT—First responders, including the Ventura County Fire Department’s hazardous materials units, responded Feb. 12 to a chemical accident in Thousand Oaks. Courtesy Ventura County Fire Department\nResidents in a Thousand Oaks neighborhood were asked to shelter in place last week as authorities responded to a hazardous materials incident the Ventura County Sheriff’s Office is describing as an accident involving readily available chemicals.\nAt around 5:15 p.m. Feb. 12, Ventura County firefighters responded to the area of Calle Avallano and Calle Olivo to help a person injured in a chemical reaction. By the time they arrived, the minor involved had already been taken to Los Robles Regional Medical Center, said Ventura County Fire Department public information officer Andrew Dowd.\nBecause the responding units had not yet determined the nature of the chemicals involved, the department sent a hazardous materials unit to the hospital and issued a shelter-in-place order for a three-block area of the neighborhood, located just north of Avenida de los Arboles and west of the 23 Freeway.\n“We did that as a precaution until we were able to rule out any danger to the community,” Dowd said. “Rescuer safety, public safety and environmental safety are paramount to what we do.”\nOnce the VCFD team was able to establish the home was safe for Ventura County Sheriff officers to enter, the fire department handed the investigation over, Dowd said.\nThe sheriff’s office has since determined the mixing of the involved materials— which VCSO said can be purchased online or in a store—was accidental.\nThe Sheriff’s department is not naming the materials.\n— Becca Whitnall",

Nick Offerman is sharing his gratitude with the world after winning his very first Emmy during Saturday’s Creative Arts Emmys ceremony.

If you enjoy what we do, then it’s always and only because the writing is so good, and I’m so grateful to be able to participate in this tradition of ‘storytelling as medicine,’ with which we demonstrate our devotion to each other, because as Wendell Berry says, it all turns on affection.”\nOfferman also made sure to drop in a reference to his character’s love for strawberries.
