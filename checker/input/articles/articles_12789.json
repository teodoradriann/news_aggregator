    "title": "Fighting Joe Biden Comes Out Swinging at Naysayers",
    "text": "It was far from a perfect performance, but President Joe Biden used his Thursday evening press conference as a preview of the arguments he will deploy in the coming days, weeks, and months, as fellow Democrats’ calls for him to step aside persist —and as his refusal to do so is likely to harden. “I’m determined I’m running,” Biden said during a question-and-answer session with reporters that lasted for nearly an hour. “But I think it’s important that I allay fears, let them see me out there.” If he failed to do so entirely, he also displayed an obvious command of foreign policy. In the plainest terms, he was far more with it than during last month’s debate with Donald Trump, which has led to an explosion of anxiety about his fitness for the presidency—and the presidential campaign. “This is a very strong performance,” Democratic strategist and former Obama administration official Joel M. Rubin wrote in a social media post . He said that Biden had given “a master class in how foreign policy and domestic policy intersect.” Perhaps that was something of an overstatement. At a NATO event earlier in the day, Biden introduced Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, standing beside him, as “President Putin,” the Russian leader who invaded Ukraine in 2022. In response to the first question from a reporter at the ensuing press conference, Biden made reference to “Vice President Trump,” a remark that instantly went viral and has led to a profusion of internet memes. His vice president is Kamala Harris , who many Democrats think should replace Biden at the top of the ticket, but Thursday evening seemed to suggest that Biden was not seriously entertaining that possibility. “I’m in good shape,” he said. As efforts to persuade him to step aside have mounted, Biden has grown increasingly recalcitrant. He used Thursday as a showcase of his foreign policy prowess. If he sometimes stumbled, he also displayed sufficient mastery of detail to remind detractors of his expertise. The president discounted reports that, last week, he said at a summit of Democratic governors that he needed to go to bed by 8 p.m. He meant, he now elaborated, that he simply had to be more thoughtful about a grueling schedule that has included shuttle diplomacy intended to defuse conflicts in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. “I just got to pace myself a bit more,” he said. In recent days, there has been rampant speculation about the several visits of a Parkinson’s disease expert to the White House. Earlier this week, Biden’s press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, has said that he has not been diagnosed with Parkinson’s. On Thursday evening, Biden said he took a neurological exam “as recently as February.” While he seemed to acknowledge that his age had become a political flashpoint, he also touted his first-term record, using it as an argument for another four years in the Oval Office. “I’ve got to finish this job,” he said. “Because there’s so much at stake.” Reactions from Democrats seemed to suggest that while the press conference was not a debacle, it was also not a resounding success. “Biden could have stood on his head and recited the Constitution backwards during the NATO press conference and for some, it still would not have been enough,” said Keisha Lance Bottoms, the former Atlanta mayor and Biden administration official. “Democracy is on the line. Let’s support our nominee and preserve it.” But for others in the same party, Biden must step aside precisely because defeating Trump is of such paramount importance. As the press conference concluded, three U.S. representatives: Rep. Eric Sorensen (D-IL), Rep. Jim Himes (D-CT), and Rep. Scott Peters (D-CA), joined the growing number of Democrats calling for Biden to end his reelection campaign. “Joe Biden ran for President with the purpose of putting country over party,” Sorensen said in a statement. “Today, I am asking him to do that again.”",

    "title": "Monkeys revealed as undisputed kings of yodelling with frequency range 5 times greater than humans - NewsBreak",
    "text": "MONKEYS are the undisputed kings of yodelling, research shows. They were found to have a frequency range five times greater than humans. And their voices can cover more than three octaves — while even the Swiss or Austrian masters of the art struggle to cover just one. It is down to the unique structure of their throats and gives them a rich variety of calls for communicating with other monkeys. Researcher Jacob Dunn said: “These ultra-yodels might be particularly important in primates, which have complex social lives and need to communicate in a variety of different ways.” The findings are from a British and Austrian research team’s study of monkeys in a wildlife sanctuary in Bolivia, South America . It examined their thin vocal membranes, which sit above the vocal cords. They have been lost in humans as we evolved more stable speech. Latin American species of howler monkey, capuchin squirrel monkey and Peruvian spider monkey have the largest membranes of all primates. They switch from using their vocal cords to the membrane to effect rapid switches in frequency — just like an Alpine yodeller or king of the jungle Tarzan. Professor Dunn added: “It’s highly likely this has evolved to enrich the animals’ call repertoire, and is potentially used for attention-grabbing changes, call diversification, or identifying themselves.” Lead author Dr Christian Herbst, of the University of Vienna, said: “This is a fascinating example of how nature provides the means of enriching animal vocalisation, despite their lack of language. “The production of these intricate vocal patterns is mostly enabled by the way the animals’ larynx is anatomically shaped, and does not require complex neural control generated by the brain.” Unlock even more award-winning articles as The Sun launches brand new membership programme – Sun Club.",

    "text": "近年来泰国试管婴儿因成功率可观、费用合理、**宽松等优势而吸引了全球各地的不孕不育家庭前往治疗。那泰国试管婴儿被骗经历有哪些常见骗局？今天就来给大家讲讲。\n泰国试管婴儿被骗经历有哪些常见骗局？\n1、低价试管\n试管婴儿是一种对技术和设备都有较高要求的技术，成本不可能低，因此声称可以低价做试管婴儿的有很大一部分都是骗局，如果不清楚这一点，那么很多人做泰国试管婴儿被骗的几率就会比较大。\n2、夸大成功率\n试管婴儿成功率有很多影响因素，一般年龄大的、身体条件较差的、没有做好心理准备的，其试管婴儿成功率都是比较低的，因此声称成功率较好，基本上都是骗局，通常都是急功近利的试管家庭做泰国试管婴儿被骗的几率比较大。\n3、不需要任何手续\n只要是正规的试管婴儿医院，都需要提供一定的手续用来建立档案，因此不需要任何手续的医院基本上都是医院或机构，存在很大的安全隐患，因此也是骗局之一，通常是不在国内事先做好攻略，而自己在网上看到说不需要任何手续就独自前往的家庭做泰国试管婴儿被骗的几率比较大。\n延伸：泰国试管婴儿有哪些误区？\n1、**手术非常痛苦\n实际上，目前大部分生殖医学中心都会在**手术时进行麻醉，根据不同人对疼痛的敏感程度不同，可以选择局部麻醉或全身麻醉，而且手术过程短，**手术后待患者清醒即可离开医院。\n2、试管婴儿比正常婴儿寿命短\n两者除了授精方式不同，孕育的过程都是一样的，是在母体子宫内生长发育的，所遗传的基因，得到的营养等等，也都是一样的，所以试管婴儿在健康长大的情况下，寿命是与正常婴儿无异的。\n3、促排卵泡越多越好\n促排的原理是让现有的卵泡尽可能的发育成熟，过多的卵泡易引起卵巢过渡刺激，因此数量并非就意味着成功率，较理想的是取出8－10个成熟卵子，培养到6－8个合格胚胎，单次促排可以获得2－3次移植机会。\n4、促排会消耗卵巢储备\n在不用药的情况下，女性每个月的一批卵泡中仅有一颗卵子生长发育并排卵，这一批中其他的卵子随之凋亡，促排是为了这一批的大部分卵子都能够发育，因此不会额外耗损卵子的库存量，也不会使更年期提早。\n5、打促排针会使人变胖\n打促排针会使雌激素水平上升，使水分滞留在体内，导致局部或全身水肿，但因为药物会随着代谢排出体内，因此一段时间后雌激素水平会归于正常，身体也会恢复正常，只需要注意适当运动、科学饮食就没问题了。",

    "text": "US critical minerals grab emerging as a tailwind for resource juniors\nGold’s rise to record levels has ensured that the gold-heavy ASX junior mining sector got off to a ripper start in the new year.\nBut the junior sector has also welcomed a second tail-wind courtesy of the escalation of increasingly fraught geo-politics around critical minerals.\nThe Trump administration has taken things to new heights by nominating Greenland as a place the US should own, and by working towards placing a lien on Ukraine’s mineral wealth in return for its support in the war with Russia.\nWhether either land grab comes to pass is not important as even the Trump administration knows there are less controversial ways for the US to secure its critical/strategic metal needs.\nWhat is more important is that Greenland/Ukraine posturing reflects the heightened fear of the new US administration that China is playing a long-game in the control of critical/strategic minerals to the detriment of US interests.\nAnd haven’t the Chinese been tightening the screws in the space with its use of export controls across a wide range of critical minerals in which it dominates.\nPreviously obscure metals and minerals like antimony, germanium and more recently bismuth of all things have become the subject of tighter Chinese export controls, prompting sharp price rises in response to supply fears.\nThe ever-enterprising Aussie junior mining sector has rallied to the cause. Every time China imposes a new export control, an Aussie junior will be on to a project that might – or might not – help reduced dependency on China.\nIt is a nice second tailwind to gold for the junior sector.\nAnd with Chinese warships lurking off the Australian coast in recent weeks, firing off live weapons for practice, who is to say the Trump administration’s attempted Greenland and Ukraine critical minerals grab is that crazy after all.\nIoneer (ASX:INR)\nThere was nothing gracious in the exit by South Africa’s Sibanye Stillwater from Ioneer’s (ASX:INR) Rhyolite Ridge lithium-boron project in Nevada.\nAll it needed to say was that as it remained under the pump from miserable platinum prices, its continuing involvement was no longer possible. But no, it had to waffle on about how the project did not meet its criteria for investment at modest price assumptions.\nUnder the 2021 deal, the South Africans were to get 50% of the project in return for $US490m in equity. Ioneer now needs to find a replacement partner to bridge a funding gap for the project’s development.\nThe project has $US1 billion in loan support from the US Department of Energy and given the project is capable of expanding US-made lithium fourfold, it has got to be assumed the Trump administration will be supportive.\nIoneer shares have been on the slide in recent months in anticipation the South Africans would go weak at the knees, and the general malaise in lithium markets. It last traded at 14c for a market cap of $360m.\nOrd Minnett has a target price on the stock of 30c a share, saying Rhyolite Ridge has a large resource base and the boron by-product credits should make it the lowest cost lithium miner.\n“Moreover, both the mine and its offtake are all US-domiciled, lying within Trump’s tariff walls, with US offtake and no risk of punitive import duties. These factors may have appeal for prospective joint venture partners considering the project,” the broker said.\nIt added that Rio Tinto was one possibility as a new partner given its build out of a lithium division with the Arcadium acquisition and its status as a boron producer from its historic operations at Boron in California. It shares control of the global borates market with Türkiye.\nOrd Minnet said that If Rio is interested, it would likely want control of Rhyolite Ridge, adding potential M & A upside to Ioneer.\nCopper juniors KGL & HAV:\nWith or without the current tariff-inspired copper arbitrage between the US and European markets, the red metal has been travelling nicely.\nTake the lower LME price of $US4.30/lb. It is up 9.6% since the start of the year. The gain from last (calendar) year’s average is a lesser 3.6%.\nBut the point is made. The red metal is starting to lay the foundation for higher prices still in response to supply concerns, notwithstanding the biggest consumer China dithering on pump priming its economy.\nThe industry itself has read the tea leaves and has been positioning itself for the potential “fly-up” in prices which BHP and others reckon is over the horizon in response to the huge demand coming from the energy revolution at a time of a falling grades at existing mines and a paucity of new mine developments.\nIt is course why BHP absorbed OZ Minerals for $10 billion, why it tried but failed in a bid for Anglo American, and why it took a second prize of spending $US2 billion on an undeveloped copper project in Argentina.\nBut today’s interest is what the copper thematic means for juniors with advanced copper projects with some scale to them.\nToday’s particular interest is in KGL’s (ASX:KGL) Jervois project in the Northern Territory and Havilah’s (ASX:HAV) Kalkaroo copper-gold project in South Australia.\nThe companies have similar market caps of about $65 million, which is clearly on the small side of things when it comes to financing the capital needs of their respective $362m and $800m projects.\nIt is why both are open to looking for partners with deeper pockets. And so they should given the valuation metrics from recent copper and copper-gold asset sales in the Australian market.\nBased on the prices paid by South Africa’s Harmony for the Eva project in Queensland, the Salim group’s (it’s a 35% KGL shareholder) acquisition of the Hillside project in South Australia and by Sumitomo for a stake in Rio Tinto’s Winu copper/gold project in WA, it can be suggested that the market caps of KGL and Havilah should be multiples of where they are currently.\nA recently released feasibility study by Havilah on its Jervois project established a $405m post tax NPV at $US4.58/lb copper, or $688m at $US5.90/lb copper. Take the three project acquisitions mentioned above, and a case could be made for Havilah’s Kalkaroo being worth $400-$800m.\nThe trick now is for KGL and Havilah to work some of that implied value upside into their market caps or face hostile low-ball takeover bids. But the Salim group is a gate keeper at KGL, as is the newly established NPV of the Jervois project.\nHavilah boss Chris Giles has proved in the past that he is no pushover from his supporter base in the company.\nBut both companies do want to deal and given the apparent disconnect between their market caps and the implied value of their projects, it will be no surprise to see the gap close rapidly on any deals being struck.\nfollowing mebelow and you’ll be notified every time I post a wire\n3 topics\n5 stocks mentioned\nOne of Australia’s leading business journalists, Barry FitzGerald, highlights the issues, opportunities and challenges for small and mid-cap resources stocks, and most recently penned his column for The Australian newspaper.\nOne of Australia’s leading business journalists, Barry FitzGerald, highlights the issues, opportunities and challenges for small and mid-cap resources stocks, and most recently penned his column for The Australian newspaper.",

    "text": "Un zoológico en la ciudad de Arnhem (Países Bajos) logró criar con éxito una especie de tiburón cebra, que ha sobrevivido a los primeros dos meses críticos, según informó este jueves el propio centro. El acuario del zoológico neerlandés Royal Burgers señaló que se realizarán varias pruebas de ADN para revelar si una especie de tiburón macho ha estado involucrada en el proceso de reproducción por partenogénesis. Este mecanismo de reproducción, común en esta especie de tiburones, consiste en la formación de un nuevo ser a partir de la división reiterada de células sexuales femeninas no fecundadas, lo que permite así a las hembras reproducirse sin la participación de un macho. Del mismo modo, el acuario especificó también que las hembras de tiburón cebra son capaces de almacenar el esperma del macho hasta un año, por lo que un apareamiento exitoso podría haber dado lugar a óvulos fertilizados. Según afirmaron, las especies que se reproducen a través de la partenogénesis tienen muchas menos probabilidades de sobrevivir. Para lograr criar esta especie de tiburón, el acuario tomó la decisión de separar de forma periódica a los machos de las hembras para alentar el estado de ánimo reproductivo. El acuario albergaba hasta ahora tres especies de tiburones cebras, los cuales forman parte del Programa Europeo de Especies en Peligro (EEP, por sus siglas en inglés) pero que, a pesar de convivir durante varios años, nunca se habían reproducido. A una temperatura del agua de 25 grados, las crías de tiburones rayas nacen alrededor de los 135 o 176 días, y a fin de maximizar las probabilidades de éxito, se separan para evitar que otras especies de tiburones se coman los huevos. El zoológico neerlandés cuenta con varios acuarios públicos en los Países Bajos y en el extranjero, los cuales han centrado sus esfuerzos en la cría de tiburones y rayas que donan de forma posterior a otros centros zoológicos de toda Europa. El centro destaca, entre otros, en la cría de rayas águila moteada, tiburones charretera, tiburones bambú o tiburones de punta negra de arrecife.
