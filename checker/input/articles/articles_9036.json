    "text": "During this kayaking season, Alytus r. kayakers trained by the coach of the art and sports school Rimos Sukacks have more than one championship title and dozens of medals! In addition, after a gap of many years, a national youth canoe polo championship was organized in Daugai.\nSummer – no holidays Alytus District In the School of Arts and Sports, canoeists have the opportunity to choose two disciplines: the Olympic sport of kayak sprint and the team game of canoe polo.\n“My students take part in sprint and canoe polo competitions both in Lithuania and abroad. Some prefer kayak sprints, others prefer canoeing. We have a total of 28 students and we have been working together for the third season. This summer was very active for us, practically without holidays: we trained a lot, participated in many competitions. It is this season that makes me very happy, we have great results”, says R. Sukackas.\nDaugiškii is the champion of the Polish Cup The most successful stage of the competition began in Poland in May. The Kanupolo Cup competition, which consisted of four stages, was held there. Alytus SRC and Alytus r. canoeists from the School of Art and Sports won all four stages, won the Polish Canoe Polo Cup and became the champions of this country, and coach R. Sukacks received the award for the best canoe polo coach.\nHe competed with the best in Europe Kayakers from the Alytus district competed with the best European teams in the German city of Essen for the German Cup. Although they returned home without a medal, it was a valuable experience to compete against the best in Europe.\nJust a hair’s breadth away from a medal Lithuanian kayak and canoe competitions for boys and young people were held in Trakai, where Alytus r. Students from art and sports schools also participated. For many of the younger rowers, this was their first competition. They had to compete with athletes who were 2-3 years older. In this age group, Titas Barysas and Martynas Gecevičius performed well, reaching the final in the K-2 1000m rowing. In the final, he lacked experience and strength against older opponents, but gained a lot of experience. Nojus Sukackas performed better in the junior competition, starting from the K-2-1000m event, taking an excellent 4th place and missing only 2 seconds to win the bronze medal.\n“The representatives of the federation were surprised that Daugai rowers are only in their third season and are already hot on their heels for medals,” coach R. Sukackas was pleased with the results of his students.\nFrom the Alytus International Tournament: Two winners’ cups and one 2nd place cup In Alytus, the international canoe-polo tournament “Baltosios rože” was held, which was successful in the Alytus district. for students of art and sports schools. Athletes from the Alytus district won two winners’ cups and 2nd place in three age groups. In the youngest age group U-12 and in the age group U-17, the teams won one “White Rose” cup each and became the winners of the tournament. In the age group U-14, the team took 2nd place.\nThe mayor’s cup is also at home On July 6, R. Sukack’s students competed for the cup of the mayor of Alytus Rasa Vitkauskienė district, and this prize did not go anywhere: it went to Daugiški.\nFour more medals in the sprint One of the last competitions of this season is the Student Kayak Sprint Championship held in Šiauliai. Eight athletes from the Alytus region took part, four of whom took home the runner-up and winner’s medals.\nThe last competition of this season is still expected in Šiauliai from 13 to 15 September, which gives the coach hope to enrich this year’s medal collection.\nThere is a lot of potential in Alytus district For the first time after a break of many years, in the last days of August, the Lithuanian Youth Canoe Championship was held in Daugai. Athletes from Daugai came in second.\n“Alytus district has great potential, many more similar championships can be organized in the city of Daugai, we just need to work with growing talents – both boys and girls, strengthen the kayak sports base in Daugai and attract at least two more coaches to this industry,” said coach R. Sukacks, who this year is nurturing the project of gathering an even larger team of representatives of this sport.\nSpeaking about talents, coach R. Sukacks was pleased with the leader of the canoe-polo team, Vakaris Sukacks, who was recognized as the best player of the entire season and received an award. According to the coach, he was well supported by Aivaras Jonauskas and Martynas Gecevičius.\nVakaris Sukackis, Nojas Sukackis and the young athletes Augusta Sukarevičiūta and Rasa Ribačiauskaitei, who became the winners of the Lithuanian canoe polo championship for schoolchildren, performed well in the sprint.\nInformation from the Communication Department of the Alytus District Municipality Administration\n#kayakers #championship #titles #award #medals #season #account\n– 2024-09-05 19:58:07",

    "title": "Brittany Mahomes Postpartum Recovery: Biggest Hollywood Actress Shocked by Brittany Mahomes' Quick Return to the Field After Delivery | NFL News - The Times of India",
    "text": "Thread Britteny Mahomes, wife of the quarterback of Kansas City Chiefs Patrick Mahomes has already made headlines yet again this time for her super-fast postpartum recovery from giving birth to attending the Chiefs' playoff game on January 19, six days after giving birth. It shocks many people because most mothers take weeks or even months to recover completely after delivering a baby. Yet, there she was, beaming with a smile and cheering her husband on to another big win.\nScarlett Johansson Couldn’t Believe Her Eyes\nOne of the celebrities who could not believe it was Scarlett Johansson. The Avengers actress, who is no stranger to the challenges of motherhood, was left speechless when she learned about Brittany's quick recovery. \"How come she's upright?\" Scarlett joked when speaking about Brittany's rapid return to public life. Johansson, a mother of two, shared her own experience with postpartum recovery, which was far less glamorous.\n\"I think I had a giant Guinness and a giant bowl of puffed Cheetos, and I was staring off into the abyss like, 'What have I done?'\" Scarlett laughed, recalling the early days after giving birth. She also offered a reminder about the emotional challenges many new mothers face. \"You say, 'Okay, yeah. I'm okay. I'm fine. I'm fine.' And then you go home and you think, 'I'm not fine,'\" Johansson explained.\nBut with her own humorous twist on the woeful plight of a new mother, she couldn't help but show great praise for Brittany's remarkable recovery postpartum. She even expressed amazement at how quickly she was able to recover and get back into the fray of life immediately after giving birth.\nAs for Brittany, motherhood seems to be just another chapter in her busy life. Her husband Patrick is aiming for a third consecutive Super Bowl victory, and she has been by his side both on and off the field. Whether it's a massive sporting event or a quiet moment at home, Brittany's resilience has made her a true powerhouse in her own right.\nWhile the Chiefs prepare for their upcoming battle against the Buffalo Bills, the Mahomes family is thriving both on and off the field. We’ll see if Brittany’s superhuman recovery can be topped by another Super Bowl win for the family, but for now, it’s clear that she’s more than ready for whatever comes next.\nAlso read - Jason Kelce, the King of Controversies, Draws Criticism Again for his Controversial Comment\nAbout the Author TOI Sports Desk The TOI Sports Desk excels in a myriad of roles that capture the essence of live sporting events and deliver compelling content to readers worldwide.

    "text": "PETALING JAYA: Young families and elderly Christians from all walks of life make time to come for Good Friday services and mass.\nDespite a busy schedule and the hot weather, these individuals kept the tradition of commemorating Good Friday alive.\nManagement consultant Bryan Leong, 31, said that this year’s Good Friday (March 29) was special because it was the first Good Friday service for his four-month-old son.\n“Although it was a bit hard to concentrate with a little baby, we are thankful,” he said.\nHis wife, Tan Shen Wen, 31, said that they hoped going to service would become their family tradition so that the baby could learn about the importance of Good Friday.\nAlthough limping on a crutch, retiree Jasmine Khoo, 80, said that as long as there was a Good Friday service, she would come.\n“To show my gratitude for God's care, I will show up even though I am disabled,” she said.\nKuching native Stanilla Mayang, 35, said that she is grateful that both her husband and herself are off on Good Friday.\n“Last year, I could not come because of work.\n“This year, I am glad to bring my six-year-old son, and I hope he learns the importance of having faith,” she said.\nRetirees YC Huang, 72, and his wife Karen Kong, 65, are glad to see so many turn up for Good Friday mass.\n“People are returning, and the last two years have been muted.\n“Today is the most people we have seen in the last four years, and we are thankful for such a beautiful mass today,” exclaimed Huang.\nParishioner Alison Fernandez, 39, said she never misses Good Friday mass, and she came with her husband and four-year-old daughter.\nShe said that although her husband was a Hindu, he came to support her.\n\"I brought my daughter to teach her about faith, and she is learning how to pray. We are exposing her to both my husband’s and my religion; ultimately, it is important for her to have faith in God,” said the PhD student.\nMarketing administrator Basilika Simon said that Good Friday has always held much importance in her life.\n“I feel like I follow the journey of Christ from Holy Thursday until Easter Sunday.\n“Even though it is the same every year, I have a different experience,” said the 35-year-old, who is from Beaufort, Sabah.\nOpen Modal ×",

    "title": "Costco gold sales increase interest in metal but doesn't move market",
    "text": "Costco's decision to sell precious metals has brought it golden buzz. A Wells Fargo report stated that the bank's analysts believe that the warehouse retail giant is selling between $100 million to $200 million in gold per month. Wells Fargo suggested that the precious metal offering was a way to add value to the company's brand noting that \"it's a very low-profit business at best.\" \"We view the addition of gold/silver as a smart move for Costco, as it only reinforces its value position,\" the report said. The buzz around Costco's offering has led to increased interest in investing in the metal, according to Zachary Scott, general manager of Wilshire Coin in Santa Monica, Calif. Scott said that he is seeing customers who are \"less than typical\" brought in after seeing gold being sold by \"a trusted company.\" \"It's bringing in new buyers and interest, though not in massive amounts, who have seen the articles around Costco selling gold,\" Scott said. How much gold is Costco selling? Using the estimates from the Wells Fargo report and an approximate price of $2,000 Costco sells between 50,000 and 100,000 ounces of gold per month. USA TODAY reached out to Costco to inquire about the volume of gold it has sold and did not receive a response. Gold prices since Costco started selling After Costco introduced the 1 oz. gold bars to its website last October the spot price of the metal held steady around $2,000 until an upswing that started in February. The metal made a run at the start of March that stabilized around the $2,175 mark in the middle of the month. Gold is experiencing another breakout that started at the end of March and has continued. The spot price of the metal was $2,341.35 as of 9 a.m. ET Thursday, April 11. Should someone buy gold? Whether it’s a good time to buy gold depends on various factors, including your investment goals, risk tolerance and time horizon, the broader economic outlook, and forecasts about the gold market. Historically, many people view gold as a hedge against inflation and currency fluctuations. Others see it as a store of value during economic downturns. At the same time, some may find diversifying a portfolio of stocks and bonds useful, given its low correlation to both assets. “If you look at gold’s performance historically, it’s the kind of asset that should perform well through uncertainty, as it has done in five out of the last seven recessions,” said Joseph Cavatoni, chief market strategist for North America at the World Gold Council. “For people looking for a store of value and a portfolio diversifier, gold has a strong track record of delivering those qualities.” Contributing: Tony Dong and Farran Powel USA TODAY Blueprint",

    "text": "Tiendas\nAdiós Sanborns; estas son las TIENDAS que cerraron sus puertas en la CDMX durante 2025\nLas tiendas Sanborns se caracterizan por la gran variedad de productos que ofrecen, además de contar con restaurantes de ambiente familiarPese a su gran popularidad, en los últimos años de ha tenido que decir adiós a algunas sucursales de Sanborns, y este año no ha sido la excepción; dicha situación se trata de una estrategia comercial, pero hay usuarios que resultan afectados por estos ajustes, así que quienes suelen visitar esta cadena, no está de más que sepan cuáles son las tiendas que cerraron sus puertas en la CDMX durante 2025.\nHay que señalar que Sanborns a lo largo de su historia en México se ha caracterizado por la gran variedad de productos y servicios que ofrecen en sus tiendas, asimismo, sus restaurantes son conocidos por tener un ambiente agradable y familiar. Pese a esto, en los últimos años se ha tenido que decir adiós a algunas tiendas en diversas partes del país, pero principalmente la CDMX.\n¿Qué tiendas Sanborns cerraron sus puertas en la CDMX durante 2025?\nEl pasado lunes 28 de abril, Sanborns reportó a la Bolsa Mexicana de Valores (BMV) que durante 2025 cerraron las puertas de dos tiendas en la CDMX, las cuales son Parque Vía y Tabasco. Dicha situación representó un decremento de 2.1 por ciento de su piso de venta. Pese a ello, Carlos Slim, dueño de la cadena, ha asegurado que la idea es abrir más sucursales en el futuro y no se le está diciendo adiós a la empresa de manera definitiva.\nDe acuerdo con los reportes, la estrategia de Sanborns parece estar enfocada en optimizar su presencia física, adaptándose a los cambios en los hábitos de consumo y al crecimiento del comercio electrónico. Aunque la noticia de que han cerrado las puertas de algunas tiendas ha generado preocupación, la empresa ha declarado que no se retirará del mercado mexicano y que, por el contrario, planea seguir expandiéndose.\nSi bien no se espera un cierre total de la cadena Sanborns en México, es probable que continúen cerrando las puertas de algunas tiendas que no sean rentables o que enfrenten problemas con las rentas o la ubicación. La situación financiera de la empresa y la evolución del mercado minorista serán factores clave para determinar el número final de cierres y aperturas en los próximos meses de 2025.",
