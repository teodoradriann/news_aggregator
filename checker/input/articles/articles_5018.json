    "text": "The new plant-based soft gel will launch on Friday, January 19, providing Arizona consumers with a unique and innovative capsule option.\nAlly Biotech, dba Life Is Chill, a science-based provider of leading-edge bioactive delivery solutions for cannabinoids, today announces the launch of its live resin soft-gel capsules, ResinTime, under its Life Is Chill product line. The initial offering to the market is vegan-friendly, a new innovative soft gel based on a tapioca-starch and sugar-free product that addresses some of the dietary needs of consumers. The launch of live resin capsules marks a new era for soft gels in the Arizona market and will meet the increasing demand for products made from fresh-frozen cannabis.\n“Capsules are an increasingly popular choice for those seeking a smoke-free and sugar-free product, but the common practice of using gelatin in pills makes them inaccessible to people who prefer plant-based products or people that have allergies to bovine gelatin,” said Francis Baczek, President at Life Is Chill. “Our newest addition to the Chill Pill product line solves this problem with the additional benefit of high-quality live resin.”\nThe ResinTime soft gels will officially launch on January 19th, 2024, at The Superior Dispensary in Phoenix. The vegan-friendly ResinTime is the company's newest addition to its current portfolio of easy-to-swallow THC soft-gel capsules, which includes six other variations: Day Caps, Night Caps, Anytime Caps, Anytime Hybrid+, Extreme Caps, and THCa Caps.\n“We are honored to kick off the launch of these live resin soft gels, a first of its kind in the Arizona market,” said Steve Shapiro, founder and CEO of The Superior Dispensary. “As a vegan, I’m excited to have a vegan-friendly product available for consumers. These capsules will provide another great option for customers seeking new ways to consume live resin-based products in an easily digestible way.”\nThe award-winning soft gel brand is available in dozens of dispensaries across the state and has cemented itself as an Arizona staple for almost a decade. With the global cannabis capsule market expected to reach $108.14 billion by 2029, according to Data Bridge Market Research, and at least 6% of the American population identifying as either vegetarian or vegan, this new launch will meet the growing demand for dietary-friendly live resin products and provide an inhalation-free and sugar-free method of consumption for Arizona cannabis users.\nThe new product launch follows Ally Biotech’s acquisition of the Chill Pill line in the spring of 2023. It continues the company’s plan to expand its product line and establish itself as a market leader in the soft gel category.

    "text": "PANAMA CITY, Fla. (WJHG/WECP) - Good Friday morning everyone! It’s a quiet start on satellite and radar with clear skies and plenty of sunshine on the way today. However, it’s cooler out the door! Most will get the early morning commute before 8am underway in the 50s. You may want to reach for a light jacket to start the day. Make sure it’s something you can shed by lunch as temperatures still warm up pleasantly by the midday and afternoon. Highs today warm into the upper 70s near 80 degrees for a beautiful afternoon. Average highs for Mid-October are closer to the low 80s. So, we’re running slightly below average today. Keep the jacket handy if you’ve got Friday dinner or evening plans as we’ll get cooler quicker tonight. Temperatures slip into the 60s after dinner and we’ll continue to cool all the way back down into the 50s by Saturday morning. Sunday morning returns to the 50s as well! Yet, our weekend is full of blue sky and sunshine. That helps warm are midday and afternoons to the seasonal low 80s. Columbus day is on Monday. We’ll see a slight peak in temperatures returning to the mid 80s in the afternoon. But a bigger cool down is on the way for mid-week next week where highs by next Wednesday may only reach the mid 70s. Copyright 2024 WJHG. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "A serial shoplifter who fronted court over six separate matters has been ordered to pay back hundreds of dollars for the items he stole.\nWest Dubbo man Jayden McKellar, 27, appeared at Dubbo Local Court via video link from prison on Wednesday, April 2, to be sentenced over a number of larceny and shoplifting matters.\nAccording to court documents, McKellar has been charged almost 100 times before for stealing, trespassing, breaching AVOs and more.\nOn his most recent court appearance, he faced four separate larceny charges, one shoplifting charge and one trespass charge.\nThe \"most serious\" of the matters, the court heard, was from September 12, 2024, when McKellar went into Myer on Macquarie Street and stole a number of menswear items.\nHe first picked up a backpack valued at $139 and then started filling the backpack with different items as he moved around the section. The total value of the items he took was $868.55.\nA staff member saw McKellar carrying the backpack with the security tag still on it as he made his way towards the back exit of the store. The staff member approached him and asked to see inside the bag but McKellar refused and started shouting at them.\nThe tag on the bag set off the scanners as McKellar ran out of the store through the carpark.\nDays earlier, McKellar also made off with a haul of clothing from Rebel Sports on Macquarie Street.\nAt about 11.45am on September 2, McKellar went into the store's change room with a number of clothing items valued at a total of $434.\nFive minutes later, McKellar left the changing room carrying a black Coles bag that he didn't have when he went into the changing room. Seeing this, an employee attempted to stop McKellar to speak with him, however he ignored their requests and left the store.\nOther matters included McKellar stealing an ice-cream from a sushi restaurant and stealing cash from a chemist.\nMagistrate Aaron Tang convicted McKellar of all the charges and said considering the number of matters, the threshold for imprisonment was crossed.\nFor stealing from Myer and Rebel Sports, he was sentenced to two fixed terms in prison of three months and two months, respectively. Taking into account the time served, McKellar was eligible for release on his sentence date.\nHe was also placed on a two-year community corrections order for stealing cash from the chemist and must get drug and alcohol counselling.",
