    "text": "ISRO successfully completes its Reusable Launch Vehicle technology demonstrations Science PTI 23 Jun 2024 5:10 AM GMT x The final test in the series of Landing Experiment was conducted at the Aeronautical Test Range in Chitradurga, Karnataka. (X.com) Bengaluru: Space agency ISRO on Sunday said it has achieved a third consecutive success in the Reusable Launch Vehicle Landing Experiment by demonstrating the autonomous landing capability of the launch vehicle under more challenging conditions This mission simulated the approach and landing interface and high-speed landing conditions for a vehicle returning from space, reaffirming the Indian Space Research Organisation's (ISRO) expertise in acquiring the most critical technologies required for the development of a Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV), the space agency said.\nThe third and final test in the series of Landing Experiment (LEX-03) was conducted at 07:10 1ST at the Aeronautical Test Range (ATR) in Chitradurga, Karnataka.\nFollowing the success of the RLV LEX-01 and LEX-02 missions, ISRO in a release said, RLV LEX-03 re-demonstrated the autonomous landing capability of the RLV under more challenging release conditions (cross range of 500 m against 150 m for LEX-02) and more severe wind conditions.\nThe winged vehicle, named 'Pushpak', was released from an Indian Air Force Chinook Helicopter at an altitude of 4.5 km \"from a release point 4.5 km away from the runway. Pushpak autonomously executed cross-range correction manoeuvres, approached the runway and performed a precise horizontal landing at the runway centreline,\" it said.\nDue to this vehicle's low lift-to-drag ratio aerodynamic configuration, the landing velocity exceeded 320 kmph, compared to 260 kmph for a commercial aircraft and 280 kmph for a typical fighter aircraft, it added.\nISRO said, after touchdown, the vehicle velocity was reduced to nearly 100 kmph using its brake parachute, after which the landing gear brakes were employed for deceleration and stop on the runway.\nDuring this ground roll phase, Pushpak utilises its rudder and nose wheel steering system to autonomously maintain a stable and precise ground roll along the runway, it said.\nAccording to the space agency, this mission simulated the approach and landing interface and high-speed landing conditions for a vehicle returning from space, reaffirming ISRO's expertise in acquiring the most critical technologies required for the development of a Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV).\nThrough this mission, the advanced guidance algorithm catering to longitudinal and lateral plane error corrections, which is essential for the future Orbital Re-entry Mission has been validated, the space agency noted.\nThe RLV-LEX uses multi-sensor fusion including sensors like Inertial sensor, Radar altimeter, Flush air data system, Pseudolite system and NavIC, it said, adding \"Notably, the RLV-LEX-03 mission reused the winged body and flight systems as such without any modification, from the LEX-02 mission, demonstrating the robustness of ISRO's capability of design to reuse flight systems for multiple missions.\"\nThe mission, led by Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC), was a collaborative effort involving multiple ISRO centres -- Space Applications Centre (SAC), ISRO Telemetry, Tracking and Command Network (ISTRAC) and Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC) SHAR, Sriharikota.\nThe mission received significant support from the Indian Air Force, Aeronautical Development Establishment, Aerial Delivery Research and Development Establishment, Regional Centre for Military Airworthiness under Centre for Military Airworthiness and Certification, National Aerospace Laboratories, Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, Indian aerospace industrial partners, Indian Oil Corporation of India and Airport Authority of India.\nS Somanath, Chairman, ISRO/Secretary, Department of Space, congratulated the team for their efforts in maintaining the success streak in such complex missions.\nDr S Unnikrishnan Nair, Director of VSSC, emphasised that this consistent success boosts ISRO's confidence in the critical technologies essential for future orbital re-entry missions.\nJ Muthupandian is the Mission Director and B Karthik is the Vehicle Director for this successful mission.\n( Source : PTI )",

A senior Ukrainian intelligence official has spoken out on the inevitability of talks with [Russia](https://www.the-express.com/latest/russia) to end their ongoing conflict, despite [Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky](/latest/volodymyr-zelensky)'s previous refusal to engage in negotiations with the Kremlin. In an interview published by The Economist magazine on Thursday, Major-General Vadym Skibitsky, deputy chief of [Ukraine](https://www.the-express.com/latest/ukraine)'s HUR military intelligence directorate, acknowledged the necessity of eventual dialogue with [Russia](https://www.the-express.com/latest/russia) to conclude the more than two-year-old war. Skibitsky explained that wars typically culminate in treaties and that meaningful negotiations would likely commence in the second half of 2025 at the earliest. \"General Skibitsky says he does not see a way for [Ukraine](https://www.the-express.com/latest/ukraine) to win the war on the battlefield alone. Even if it were able to push Russian forces back to the borders - an increasingly distant prospect - it wouldn’t end the war,\" the magazine wrote. \"Such wars can only end with treaties, he says. Right now, both sides are jockeying for the 'the most favourable position' ahead of potential talks. But meaningful negotiations can begin only in the second half of 2025 at the earliest, he guesses.\" Don't miss...

O crime ocorreu em Novo México Um comerciante foi vítima de dois furtos em pouco mais de dois meses. Durante o período, a vítima perdeu dois carros, em Novo México, Vila Velha. Segundo a vítima, o último carro foi levado na madrugada dessa quinta-feira (24) e havia sido comprado no dia anterior. O veículo era utilizado para o trabalho do comerciante. \"Outro amigo meu tinha esse veículo, que eu precisava para o meu trabalho.

Devido à compra recente, o carro ainda não tinha seguro. \"Como já era tarde, não tinha como eu fazer o seguro. Fiquei de fazer hoje. Pode olhar as filmagens, foram as mesmas pessoas\". Crime aconteceu da mesma forma Ainda de acordo com a vítima, há pouco mais de dois meses, o mesmo crime aconteceu, com um carro do mesmo modelo. \"Eu comprei um carro, parcelei em 12 vezes, 12 cheques de 5 mil Seis dias depois, levaram o carro furtado\". O primeiro veículo furtado estava estacionando também no mesmo local que o último, e o furto aconteceu quase no mesmo horário. A suspeita da vítima é que os dois automóveis tenham sido roubados pelos mesmos criminosos. Agora, o comerciante enfrenta um prejuízo de quase R$ 200 mil. \"Eu fiquei dois meses pagando, quase perdi meu comércio. Agora eu não sei o que vou fazer da minha vida, porque tenho que pagar. Estou sem carro para trabalhar, sem condições de trabalhar, sem cabeça ou psicológico para trabalhar\", afirmou, emocionado. Vídeo flagrou ação dos criminosos Em um vídeo registrado por câmeras de segurança, uma dupla de suspeitos aparece caminhando em direção ao carro. Na sequência, um deles para na porta do motorista e parece mexer em algo. Logo depois, o mesmo homem entra no veículo enquanto o comparsa abre o capô e, também, mexe em algo. Em seguida, a dupla foge do local com o veículo do comerciante. Ao todo, a ação durou cerca de dois minutos. Veja as imagens: O veículo levado nesta quinta-feira é uma picape Fiat Strada de cor branca. A placa é: QRK3G96. Qualquer informação sobre o paradeiro do veículo pode ser repassada para a polícia. Em nota, a Polícia Civil informou que o caso está sendo investigado pela Delegacia Especializada de Furtos e Roubos de Veículos (DFRV) e, até o momento, nenhum suspeito foi detido e o veículo não consta como recuperado.

    "text": "Parte con il verso giusto l’avventura in Nations League del Portogallo. La Nazionale di Roberto Martinez ha superato 2-1 la Croazia con i gol di Dalot e Cristiano Ronaldo. Ha accorciato le distanze sul finire di primo tempo un autogol sempre dell’esterno ex Milan. Nello stesso incontro del raggruppamento la Scozia ha rimontato la Polonia chiudendo il match sul 2-2. Alle reti di Szynanski e Lewandowski hanno risposto i due calciatori del Napoli Gilmour e McTominay. Nell’altro girone invece la Danimarca ha battuto 2-0 la Svizzera grazie ai gol di Dorgu e Hojbjerg mentre la Spagna ha pareggiato 0-0 sul campo della Serbia.
