    "title": "India votes against Brand Modi",
    "text": "There is one thing certain in the 2024 Indian elections: no single party got a majority by itself to form the government. For the first time, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will have to work with coalition partners – and if history is any guide, the likes of Nitish Kumar and Chandrababu Naidu are not cakewalks. Modi has never worked with coalitions, neither in Gujarat when he was chief minister, nor in the Lok Sabha, where he led in 2014 a 282-strong contingent of his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), ten past the 272-majority mark. Then in 2019, he improved upon this tally and achieved a massive 303 seats. Officially of course, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), was in power, but Modi did not need any partners, and the manner in which cabinet berths were allocated and the business of the government run in the last ten years showed that allies were mere hangers-on. The 2024 elections have dramatically changed this reality. Without allies – and their issues, needs and demands – Modi cannot form or remain in government. This is uncharted territory. In parliamentary democracies, due to the nature of the game, very few periods are known by the name of the prime minister. Those that are, like the Thatcher era in the United Kingdom or the Nehru era in India, exhibit the towering nature of those leaders and the deep imprint they left on their country. From the start of Modi’s term as prime minister, achieving and even surpassing this was his aim. From the very personalized and strong control style of governance, to wearing clothes with the imprint of his name – even Covid vaccination certificates with his face, and a grand social media campaign solely focused on ‘Brand Modi,’ or ‘Modi ki guarantee,’ everything in the last ten years of India had to hover around him. The Modi brand had become so confident that the 2024 elections were often slated as ‘Modi v the Rest,’ as if simply this one giant – who also then claimed not to have been born biologically – was enough to single-handedly defeat all of the opposition. A grand target of 370 for the BJP, and a measly 30 for the other NDA allies, was then set by Modi to lead him beyond the 400 line to a two-thirds majority. All seemed to be working well – till it didn’t. While the BJP will still form the government with allies, the opposition INDIA alliance has given a knockout – even terminal – blow to Brand Modi. It is not about the BJP’s 240 versus the Congress’s 99, or the NDA’s 293 versus the INDIA alliance’s 232 – those are numbers, and with a split mandate anyone who can cobble together a viable alliance can make government. The real casualty of the election has been the failure of Modi vs the Rest mantra. The fact that Modi managed to win his Varanasi seat with only a 152,000 lead, while Rahul Gandhi – who he and his supporters made fun of for a decade – won with leads of nearly 400,000 thousand in both Rae Barelli in Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Wayanad in Kerala, must have stung too. How can people love the ‘Pappu’, as the BJP termed Rahul for years, more than their heavenly-born Modi? While these elections will be unpacked by commentators for long, one thing is clear. Modi lost primarily because the ‘Rest’ made this election ‘Modi v the Constitution,’ and while the INDIA alliance might not have been able to easily dislodge Modi, a very large percentage of India recognized the threat and voted for the constitution. Where Modi stood for Hindutva, the constitution stood for secularism; when Modi tried to scare the majority Hindus against the minority Muslims, the constitution guaranteed equality; when Modi tried to scare the rich and the middle class about the poor being given their wealth, the constitution spoke of equity and justice. These and more such binaries were at play in the elections, giving the people such a stark choice even in the BJP heartland of UP that it lost badly to the INDIA alliance. The hasty inauguration of the Ram Mandir at Ayodhya weeks before calling the election also didn’t help, and the BJP lost in the constituency. The impregnable Gujarat fortress of Modi was also punctured by a lone Congress win, while the INDIA alliance made gains elsewhere too. The BJP of course did well in some places too, like Odhisa, and opened its account in the south, but by and large, the shocks were from the INDIA alliance. The INDIA alliance’s win is not that it wrested power from the BJP/NDA, but that it has shattered the Modi brand and its claim of invincibility. For the INDIA partners the next two years – it would be surprising if Modi lasts a full five years – should be a time of consolidation, at the regional and national level, so that not only do they play their part as an effective opposition, but their state-level gains in the next two years should also easily propel them into power the next time. After ten years of increasingly dictatorial rule, a return to normal parliamentary politics, with its coalitions, consensus building, and collaborative government, is the need of the hour in India. Stifling the opposition through central agencies, cases, jailing, freeing of accounts, horse-trading etc, should now be a matter of the past, and a focus on the people – nearly one billion – who gave their verdict for the constitution and its core values, must be respected. Born on the same midnight, India and Pakistan always have something to learn from each other. India being Pakistan’s largest neighbour, we cannot ignore what is happening there – and we especially cannot escape the importance of true parliamentary government and the supremacy of the constitution as the bedrock of our republic.

    "title": "More recruits needed to meet Kawartha Lakes policing demands",
    "text": "There’s two new faces, and one familiar one, set to patrol Lindsay and Ops Township. The recent hires are a positive step forward in meeting staffing Kawartha Lakes Police Service’s current and future demands. Const. Matthew Self initially started with the Lindsay-based police service in 2018 after having served previously with the Toronto Police Service. In November he accepted a position with Durham Regional Police, which was closer to home. “Even though it was a much easier commute (to work), he realized that he wanted to return to KLPS,” said Chief Mark Mitchell. “So he reached out to inquire about the possibility of returning … Matt was a strong officer during his tenure with us and, in particular, was a mentor to younger staff. He was also working in the role of Acting Sergeant at the time he left.” Fortunately, the police service has a vacancy available and Const. Self will return Jan. 3. After being recruited by the police service in mid-2023, Paul Baron and Owen Porter attended the Basic Constable Training course at the Ontario Police College. The two cadets — who both attained an academic average over 90 per cent — took the oath of office Dec. 14 and are currently involved in local field training. You might be interested in The new officers were two of the 548 new recruits that have graduated from the Ontario Police College (OPC) this year. “It sounds like a lot, but there’s a significant excess of demand over supply,” said Mitchell, explaining of the seven individuals recruited this year, only four obtained College seats. “And the OPC has added a fourth intake. This will allow 2,000 recruits to graduate in 2024; which still isn’t going to meet demand.” Part of this, he notes, is due to growth. Thousands of new residences are expected to be constructed in and around Lindsay over the next seven years. A report by the Fraser Institute earlier this year, supported this factor in the demand for more officers. Since 2010, Ontario’s population has increased from 13.1 million to 14.8 million; an increase of 13 per cent. However, the total number of police officers has remained flat. In response, the province has made a number of changes to criteria and bumped up recruitment and training supports, but access and opportunity are only one part of the hiring challenge facing police services across the province. According to the Canadian Occupational Projection System, over the period 2022-2031, new job openings — arising from expansion demand and replacement demand — are expected to total 38,900 while only 36,300 new job seekers are projected to be available to fill them. Over the last three years, the COVID-19 pandemic, rising crime rates, police defunding movements and a series of officers killed in the line of duty have been cited as contributory factors to recruitment issues by the Police Association of Ontario. Salaries — at least from an applicants’ perspective — don’t appear to be an issue, complemented by the province’s decision to cover OPC tuitions while some police services, such as Timmins’, have offered singing bonuses. For those wondering what the future might hold. the average salary for a police officer in Canada, according to the federal government’s Job Bank, is $48 an hour. Ontario sits at a median of $50 and, if an individual is willing to set aside some of the negatives associated with Nunavut — such as the isolation, inadequate social services and cost of living — they can make as much as $87 an hour.",

(KTEN) — An Ardmore schoolteacher has been accused of physically abusing one of her first-grade students.\nSusan Marie Hartman, 62, was arrested and charged with child abuse by injury after the March 27 incident at Charles Evans Elementary School.\nA police statement said Hartman was walking her class to lunch when she began scolding one student, \"clapping in his face.\" According to the narrative, Hartman \"grabbed his left wrist and jerked him aggressively out of the line.\"\nAn unnamed school official questioned about the incident told investigators that she \"absolutely believes [the student] was in pain when Susan jerked him around.\"\nThe entire incident was recorded by surveillance cameras.\nThe district attorney's office reviewed the evidence and decided to press charges.\nHartman was released on bond and is on administrative leave from her teaching position. Police said the Ardmore City Schools superintendent is considering possible termination.",
