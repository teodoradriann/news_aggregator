    "text": "BRIGHTON — Joonas Korpisalo needed a fresh start after an ugly 2023-24 season that saw the goalie go 21-26-4 with a 3.27 goals-against average and an .890 save percentage for the Ottawa Senators. But now he finds himself in Boston after being acquired by the Bruins in a deal that sent Linus Ullmark to Ottawa.\nWhile the trade was a surprise to Korpisalo, he’s excited to get to work with his new teammates.\n“Things happen for a reason, and I’m here,” Korpisalo said after Thursday’s captains’ practice at Warrior Ice Arena. “Now I’m super excited.”\nKorpisalo was statistically one of the NHL’s worst goalies last season. It wasn’t solely on him, though, and he’s not far removed from a successful stint with the Los Angeles Kings when he amassed a .921 save percentage in 11 games.\n“It happens,” Korpisalo said of his numbers last year. “Everyone did their best and sometimes it just doesn’t work out. Certainly, it wasn’t that no one tried enough. But that’s last season and we got a new season coming up.”\nWith Ullmark in Ottawa , that leaves on spot behind Jeremy Swayman up for grabs. The Bruins have Brandon Bussi in Providence, and he’s knocking on the door of an NHL debut. Korpisalo doesn’t know what his workload will entail during the 2024-25 season, noting that’s a question for the coaches. But he has been in contact with goalie coach Bob Essensa.\n“I’m really excited to see Bob. ... and see what’s on his mind to make my game better. We’ve been calling (each other) a lot,” he said. “He’s not here yet. We’ve been catching up with each other throughout the summer. Excited to meet him.”\nLast season is behind him and Korpisalo is only looking ahead to the future. It will be an interesting training camp for both him and Bussi — especially after general manager Don Sweeney said in June that he’s not ruling anything out when it comes to the backup goalie.\nMore Bruins content Bruins newcomer excited to play with star forward Devils sign former Bruins defenseman Two Bruins prospects make college decisions Eastern Conference team denies report of signing Milan Lucic If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

    "text": "Travis Scott currently ranks among the top artists globally. His latest album, UTOPIA, reflects his continuous evolution in sound. Despite sparking mixed reactions, many fans consider it the best release of 2023. Critics may differ, but Travis remains unfazed, focusing on his art while his fanbase remains devoted.\nAlthough only a few music videos have been released for the album, the recent one for the track TOPIA TWINS stands out. Featuring Rob49 and 21 Savage, it's a high-energy song with provocative lyrics. The video is visually captivating, but it's not something you'd want to be caught watching by your mom. The video is filled with provocative scenes and features the Clermont Twins, a predictable addition. Travis and Rob49 are depicted cruising on jet skis surrounded by various twins, playing on male fantasies and offering a glimpse of utopia for some.\nTravis Scott With A New Music Video Hopefully, more compelling music videos will accompany the ongoing album rollout. Stay tuned to 103.5 The Beat for the latest music news and updates.",

    "text": "Le commandant en chef du Corps des gardiens de la Révolution islamique (CGRI), le général de division Hossein Salami, a salué le rôle du général Moussavi dans l’axe de la Résistance et la lutte contre le terrorisme dans la région. « L’ennemi le connaissait mieux que nous, car il avait reçu de violents coups de sa part, et l’ennemi savait quel rôle et quelle influence il avait pour le contrer », a-t-il dit avant d’ajouter que l’Iran ne fera jamais preuve de patience face au martyre de ses compatriotes. « Notre vengeance pour l’assassinat de Seyyed Razi ne sera rien d’autre que l’élimination du régime sioniste », a-t-il souligné avant de renchérir que l’Iran se réserve le droit de répondre à ce crime lâche au moment voulu et opportun sans se précipiter et sans entrer dans le jeu du régime de Tel-Aviv qui cherche à provoquer l’Iran pour élargir le feu de la guerre dans la région. L’Iran maintient une mission consultative en Syrie à la demande de Damas dans le but d’aider ce pays arabe déchiré par la guerre à se débarrasser des terroristes soutenus par l’étranger qui combattent le gouvernement démocratiquement élu depuis 2011. Plus tôt en décembre, Israël a tué deux conseillers militaires du CGRI – Mohammad Ali Ataee Shoorcheh et Panah Taqizadeh – lors d’une autre attaque en Syrie. Le CGRI avait alors annoncé dans un communiqué que ces deux officiers ont été tués en martyr dans le contexte de la sauvagerie implacable du régime israélien « faux et tueur d’enfants » à Gaza.
