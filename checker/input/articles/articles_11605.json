    "title": "What has happened with Red Bull’s rear wing in Las Vegas?",
    "text": "Red Bull has found itself on the back foot at the Las Vegas Grand Prix, with the rear wing it is running proving to be much draggier than what its rivals have on board. In a bid to help Max Verstappen and Sergio Perez attack the long straights, Red Bull arrived in Las Vegas with a trimmed rear and beam wing arrangement rather than designing a bespoke solution specifically for this track. This lowest drag arrangement is similar to what it took to Monza, but it has been a bit more aggressive this time around in trimming away more of the flap (yellow dotted line, for comparison). It wasn’t enough though, as the team found itself up to 7km\\/h down on its rivals in some of the speed traps during FP1. In response to this deficit, it cut away more of the upper flap’s trailing edge in a bid to get rid of as much drag as possible. This can be seen in the image below, as one of the mechanics cuts away the carbon fibre along a guide line that’s been drawn on the element, whilst another vacuums up the debris. This not only removes material from the existing crescent shaped cutout, but it also extends into and removes the central V groove that was present before, leaving very little material around the DRS anchor point. Beyond the main rear wing, there is just a single element beam wing installed on the RB20, which has also been trimmed significantly along the trailing edge. This leaves just a jagged full chord section in the central section to frame the exhaust’s tailpipe. Red Bull also has a revised front wing layout in Las Vegas, with flaps that feature less camber and chord length, to help balance the downforce level, front-to-rear. However, what does seem odd in its aerodynamic set-up is that it has opted for what has been attributed as its higher downforce engine cover variant. Introduced at the Hungarian Grand Prix (above, left) the solution is much more tapered at the rear of the car when compared with the unique cooling inlet and high-haunched arrangement that the RB20 used throughout the opening phase of 2024 (above, right). Red Bull fitted the RB20 with its older specification layout at both the Italian and Azerbaijan Grands Prix, making it what many assumed as a shoo-in for a return in Las Vegas. However, it hasn’t appeared as of yet. Red Bull Racing RB20 sidepods detail Photo by: Giorgio Piola Red Bull has also introduced a non-circuit specific fence update in Las Vegas, with the team continuing to search for additional performance from the RB20, even in this latter stage of the season. It is a design feature we have seen some of its rivals use in the past, with the second inboard floor fence now raised above the floor’s tideline and angled to ensure it sheds a vortex from its surface that will help flow across the upper surface of the floor. The overall shape of the fence below the tideline has been altered too, with a much squarer leading edge than was previously employed in the outgoing design.

    "text": "Largest Jewish Denomination In The USA On Gaza War – OpEd The largest Jewish denomination in the U.S.A.issued a statement on January 30 calling the Israel-Hamas war “a just war” of defense, but reiterating its support for a two-state solution to the conflict. The statement, signed by more than a dozen U.S. and Canadian leaders in the Reform Jewish movement, conveyed a resolute support for Israel while offering a strong critique of the Netanyahu government proposals for the war’s aftermath. Last week, in the midst of renewed international calls to revive a two-state solution, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu flatly rejected an independent Palestinian state while thousands of people, including several ministers of Netanyahu’s government, called for Jews to resettle in the Gaza Strip. Israel withdrew its troops from the Gaza Strip in 2005 and forced Jewish settlers there to evacuate their homes. The Reform movement’s statement opposed both Netanyahu’s stance and the new move to establish an Israeli presence in Gaza. It was issued by the Union for Reform Judaism, which represents almost 850 synagogues, as well as the Central Conference of American Rabbis, which represents 2,000 Reform rabbis (including me). About 37% of American Jews identify as Reform Jews according to Pew reach. But the two Jewish organizations maintained their support for Israel’s ongoing retaliation for the October 7, 2023 Hamas massacre of one thousand two hundred people in Israel, saying: “Israel’s goal of eradicating Hamas’s military capabilities is “a just war” because of Hamas’s ongoing commitment to Israel’s total destruction.” The war on Gaza has killed more than 26,000 Palestinians, 9,000 of them Hamas fighters, and displaced nearly 85% of Gaza’s residents.",

    "text": "|\n|\nLa tecnológica Harmonix cierra una ronda de 3,2 millones de euros con 4Founders, Kfund e ICF | |||\n| |||\nHarmonix, empresa española dedicada a digitalizar y centralizar las comunicaciones de las empresas mediante Inteligencia Artificial (IA), ha cerrado este jueves una ronda de financiación de 3,2 millones de euros. La compañía ha detallado en un comunicado que la inversión ha sido liderada por 4founders Capital junto a la participación de fondos como Kfund o ICF, entre otros. Harmonix planea con los fondos obtenidos en esta ronda acelerar su expansión en el mercado europeo y continuar las labores de innovacción en su plataforma. En palabras del director de operaciones, Toni Cáliz, el objetivo de esta ronda es hacer que el CRM sea una \"herramienta magnífica\" para el usuario y que todos los datos que se generan en las comunicaciones de las empresas con sus clientes queden registrados automáticamente en el sistema. Todo ello, según el ejecutivo, de tal manera que la IA pueda dar a los directivos toda la información que necesitan para tomar mejores decisiones, así como ayudar a los equipos y mejorar el control de calidad. El consejero delegado de Harmonix, Toni Pérez, ha subrayado que el CRM se basa en la importancia de centralizar todas las comunicaciones en un único lugar: \"Esto incluye emails, reuniones, llamadas, comunicaciones por WhatsApp [...] La verdadera IA de negocio requiere tener todo el contexto, todas las interacciones, con todos los contactos a través de todos los canales\", ha explicado para seguidamente sostener que \"la gran mayoría de sistemas CRM únicamente capturan una fracción mínima de las relaciones con clientes\". En ese sentido, han citado un informe de Forrester Research que señala que aproximadamente el 49% de las implementaciones de CRM no alcanzan los objetivos previstos debido a problemas de adopción por parte de los usuarios. \"La IA tiene un potencial enorme que, en el caso de los departamentos de ventas y atención al cliente, solo puede ser aprovechado mediante una centralización y digitalización completa de los canales de comunicación\", ha afirmado el consejero delegado sobre el potencial de este tipo de soluciones. En concreto, la compañía pretende llevar su IA a los procesos de negocio en entidades como Salesforce y Dynamics 365. |\nEl Juzgado Contencioso-Administrativo de Pontevedra ha anulado una factura de 15.600 € que pretendía cobrar la Distribuidora del grupo Naturgy alegando un “fraude eléctrico” que no ha podido demostrar en el juicio. En sentencia firme, UFD Distribución contra el recurso presentado ante la Resolución de la Xunta de Galicia, que daba la razón al titular del contrato de suministro y consideraba nula la refacturación practicada por alegar un ‘fraude eléctrico’ en el contador de electricidad.\nSí, me refiero a ti. A ese que de vez en cuando va a recoger a sus nietos al cole. A esos que están sentados en un banco de un jardín e incluso a los que están echando una partidita de dominó, esperando matar al contrario esos seis dobles que están a la expectativa, mirando de reojo al rival para que no le asesinen esa ficha adversa que todos no sabemos dónde meter cuando nos hunde la suerte en el reparto de fichas.

    "title": "Challenges for European Flying Taxi Ventures Amid Financial Strain",
    "text": "\\n Overview of the Electric Flying Taxi Landscape \\nThe dream of electric flying taxis in Europe is facing significant hurdles as companies in the sector grapple with financial difficulties. The most notable player, Volocopter, aimed to launch its electric flying taxi service during the Paris Olympics but fell short, resorting to merely conducting demonstration flights instead.\n\\n Volocopter\\u2019s Financial Predicament \\nVolocopter\\u2019s ambitious plan to operate its two-seater aircraft, the VoloCity, was met with setbacks due to an urgent need for new investments. Reports indicate that negotiations with the government for a \\u20ac100 million loan collapsed earlier this year. Now, the firm looks to Chinese automaker Geely for potential aid, as discussions are underway for Geely to acquire an 85% stake in Volocopter in exchange for $95 million in funding.\n\\nThis potential shift could lead to relocation of Volocopter\\u2019s manufacturing efforts to China, raising questions about the future of the company, which is among numerous firms globally pursuing electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) technologies.\n\\n Industry-Wide Challenges \\nIn the broader eVTOL sector, many companies face similar challenges. The significant costs tied to regulatory approval and equipment manufacturing are pressing some investors to withdraw their support.\n\\n Fallout for Companies in the Sector \\n Lilium\\u2019s Troubles \\nLilium, a German firm with a distinctive aircraft design featuring 30 tilting electric jets, has also encountered financial setbacks. Despite initial optimism and substantial orders for future aircraft, the company struggled to secure a critical \\u20ac100 million loan from Germany\\u2019s KfW bank, which required government guarantees that were not provided. In response to these financial strains, Lilium has initiated insolvency proceedings for its primary operating entities.\n\\nDespite these challenges, Lilium continues to push forward with its aircraft development as it seeks restructuring options or new investments to avoid deeper financial trouble.\n\\n Vertical Aerospace\\u2019s Ambitions \\nVertical Aerospace, a UK-based competitor, has introduced its VX4 model, which is designed to operate with eight large propellers. The company recently conducted its first untethered flight, however, it too has suffered setbacks, including a major incident during testing that damaged a prototype.\n\\nTo maintain operations, CEO Stephen Fitzpatrick has injected additional personal investments into the company, but ongoing financial pressures remain. Vertical hopes to collaborate with American financier Jason Mudrick to secure further investment, yet this has not come without internal resistance due to potential control issues.\n\\n Promising Developments on the Horizon \\nDespite the difficulties many eVTOL firms face, some projects appear to be on track to succeed. Airbus\\u2019s CityAirbus NextGen is reportedly making good progress, backed by the financial and technical resources of the established aerospace giant. This aircraft has a projected range of 80 kilometers and utilizes eight propellers for flight.\n\\nIn the wider landscape, U.S. companies such as Joby and Archer are also well-capitalized and appear poised to make strides in bringing their flying taxis to market.\n\\n Future Market Considerations \\nAs electric flying taxis prepare to enter commercial service, questions loom regarding their profitability and operational viability. Initial routes are likely to connect urban areas with airports, yet the cost structure, especially around pilot salaries and battery management, poses significant challenges.\n\\nInvestors, eager not to miss out on the next groundbreaking technology, continue to fund various electric aircraft initiatives, reminiscent of the burgeoning electric vehicle market. However, to realize the potential of electric flying taxis, companies must navigate an increasingly complex financial and regulatory landscape.\n\\n",

    "text": "Sebastián Cáceres es uno de los grandes prospectos que tiene el América para vender a Europa. Un jugador joven, seleccionado con Uruguay y que además ya levantó múltiples títulos con las Águilas.En las últimas semanas, el zaguero celeste ha sido vinculado a diferentes equipos europeos, entre ellos, el Sevilla. Aunque se ha informado que esa opción comienza a ser un poco lejana. Se había hablado de una cifra de 6 millones de dólares, pero de acuerdo a César Luis Merlo, el conjunto andaluz no está interesado en Cáceres e incluso no cuenta con el capital para adquirirlo, por lo que de momento queda descartado y con la posibilidad de permanecer en las Águilas una temporada más.“Merlo, no nos interesa y además tampoco tenemos dinero para pagar a un jugador de las características de Sebastián Cáceres”, mencionó una fuente al periodista argentino.¿Cuándo regresa el central uruguayo a la actividad con los de Coapa?Cabe mencionar que Sebastián se lesionó en la parte final del Clausura 2024 y no pudo disputar los últimos partidos que llevaron al América por el bicampeonato, por lo que tiene rato sin jugar con la playera azulcrema.Posteriormente, se recuperó y fue a Copa América con la Selección Uruguaya, donde tuvo más participación en los encuentros finales. Ahora y tras unos días de vacaciones, el sudamericano fue convocado para la Leagues Cup que se jugará en Estados Unidos.​ ​ ​​",
