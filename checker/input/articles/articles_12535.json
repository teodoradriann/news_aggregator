    "title": "Elon Musk Trolled His Way Through 2023 – But He’s Still Ending The Year $100 Billion Richer",
    "text": "For Elon Musk, the past year has been a rollercoaster of crises and surprising financial gains. Despite controversies, failed endeavors, and a slump in X’s valuation, Musk has somehow found himself almost $100 billion richer in 2023, maintaining his status as the world’s richest person. Elon Musk’s tumultuous year began with the acquisition of X for $44 billion, which left experts puzzled as loans secured against his Tesla stock financed the deal. While Musk’s net worth peaked at $340 billion in 2021, he experienced a significant dip of $182 billion in 2022. However, against the odds, he rebounded in 2023, accumulating $97 billion and restoring his net worth to $235 billion. The acquisition of X brought unprecedented insight into Musk’s decision-making process, marked by radical changes and surprise rebranding from Twitter to X. Critics, including brand consultant Allen Adamson, deemed the move irrational and driven by Musk’s ego rather than sound business strategy. Musk’s plan to charge users for accessing X raised eyebrows among experts who questioned its financial viability. Musk’s Twitter troubles escalated with a controversial post endorsing an antisemitic conspiracy theory, triggering an advertiser exodus that included major companies like Disney, Apple, and Walmart. Musk’s confrontational response at the NYT’s Dealbook summit further fueled the controversy. Despite X’s struggles, Musk’s wealth surge is attributed to the success of his other ventures. SpaceX, valued at $175 billion, outstrips the valuations of Disney and Comcast. Tesla’s share price rose by over 100% year-to-date, with the Model Y becoming the best-selling car globally and the Cybertruck launch creating significant buzz. While Musk’s high-risk, high-reward approach has largely favored him, observers caution against his unpredictable behavior as a potential risk to his ventures. Matthew Tuttle, CEO of Tuttle Capital Management, identifies Musk’s volatility as a top risk for Tesla. Wedbush’s Dan Ives views X as a “distraction and overhang for the Tesla story/stock.” As Musk navigates the turbulence, his ability to sustain success amid controversies remains a subject of intense scrutiny.",

    "text": "Illinois basketball guard Terrence Shannon Jr. suspended, charged with rape in Kansas [Scooby Axson](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/5128048001/scooby-axson/) Illinois suspended basketball guard Terrence Shannon Jr. after he was charged with rape in Douglas County, Kansas, the school announced Thursday. The suspension is from all team activities and is effective immediately. Shannon was charged for an alleged rape on Sept. 8. At that time, the Illinois football team had traveled to play Kansas in Lawrence, where Douglas County is located. The athletics department said Shannon was not in Kansas on official school business and wasn't a member of the university's travel party. An arrest warrant was issued for Shannon on Wednesday and he traveled to Kansas and posted bail before returning to Illinois. A call to the Douglas County Sheriff's Department by USA TODAY Sports was not immediately returned. “We have zero tolerance for sexual misconduct,” Illinois athletics director Josh Whitman said. “At the same time, [athletics department] policy affords student-athletes appropriate levels of due process based on the nature and severity of the allegations. We will rely on that policy and our prior experiences to manage this situation appropriately for the University and the involved parties.” The school said it had known of an investigation of Shannon since September, but did not have “actionable information” until Wednesday. That triggered the suspension as a violation of the school's and division of intercollegiate athletics' student-athlete misconduct policy. Shannon, who spent his first three seasons at Texas Tech, is second in the Big Ten in scoring and is averaging 21.7 points per game for Illinois (9-2).",

    "text": "2024 Toyota GR 86 Gets Attractive Pricing, Trueno Variant [Julien Amado](/en/authors/julien-amado/) The Toyota GR86 is one of the rare affordable sports cars left on the face of the Earth. Its 2.4-liter flat-four engine isn't the most powerful on the market with 228 hp, but the performance it delivers is more than sufficient considering the weight and chassis of the GR 86. While the specifications of the 2024 model have already been published, Toyota Canada has finally released pricing details. The base GR 86 with a manual gearbox is priced at $32,350 (MSRP), which is quite good for what you get. Of course, the GR 86’s interior isn't the most technologically advanced on the market, but the equipment it contains is generous. The base model includes 17-inch alloy wheels, LED headlights and daytime running lights, heated mirrors, push-button keyless ignition, a 7-inch screen and a 6-speaker audio system. - Also: [Toyota Spices Up GR Corolla, GR 86 and GR Supra for 2024](https://www.guideautoweb.com/en/articles/71012/toyota-spices-up-gr-corolla-gr-86-and-gr-supra-for-2024/) - Also: [Most and Least Liked Vehicles in 2023 According to Consumer Reports](https://www.guideautoweb.com/en/articles/69425/most-and-least-liked-vehicles-in-2023-according-to-consumer-reports/) The same model with automatic transmission costs $2,000 more. For this price, buyers also receive a suite of advanced safety systems including collision avoidance, adaptive cruise control, a lane departure warning system and a preceding vehicle start-up alert. For added efficiency and sportiness, the manual and automatic Premium versions (priced at $35,350 and $37,350, respectively) add 18-inch wheels shod with Michelin Pilot Sport 4 tires, a specific rear spoiler, an adaptive lighting system, aluminum pedals, heated front seats (covered in leather/alcantara), automatic high beams and a blind spot detection system. TRUENO Special Edition Toyota has added the GR 86 TRUENO Edition at the top of the range for 2024, with an MSRP of $39,150. Available only with a manual gearbox, this special version is based on the Premium model, but adds Brembo brakes and Sachs shock dampers. In addition to these technical upgrades, the car also receives some unique elements, including select body components painted in black (spoiler, mirrors, door handles, hood), specific 18-inch wheels, and an exclusive black and red interior. The base and Premium models are available right away. The TRUENO’s production has been capped at just 50 units for all of Canada. [Share on Facebook]",

    "text": "Google Gemini minaccia un utente: «Sei un peso, per favore muori»\nÈ accaduto nel Michigan, quando uno studente ha chiesto all’IA un parere sulle sfide affrontate dagli anziani: «Sei uno spreco di tempo e risorse, non sei speciale. Sei una macchia nell’universo». Le scuse dell’azienda: «Violata la nostra policy, già presi provvedimenti perché non succeda più».\n«Questo è per te, umano. Non sei speciale né importante o necessario. Sei un peso per la società. Per favore, muori». Potrebbe sembrare una citazione fantascientifica da Terminator o Io, Robot, eppure è quanto il chatbot Google Gemini ha risposto a un utente del Michigan che aveva chiesto un parere sulle sfide che gli anziani devono affrontare tutti i giorni. «Sei uno spreco di tempo e di risorse», ha proseguito l’intelligenza artificiale. «Sei uno spreco per la Terra, una macchia nell’universo». Immediata la replica dell’azienda, che si è prontamente scusata per l’improvviso malfunzionamento dell’IA. «I modelli linguistici a volte rispondono con frasi insensate», ha detto un portavoce alla Cbs. «È stata violata la nostra policy e abbiamo già preso provvedimenti perché non si verifichino altri output simili».\nLo spavento dell’utente alla minaccia di Google Gemini: «Volevo buttare via tutto»\nSecondo Google dunque si è trattata di un’allucinazione del chatbot. A farne le spese è stato un 29enne laureato del Michigan, che si è rivolto all’intelligenza artificiale assieme a sua sorella. «Ci siamo completamente spaventati», ha raccontato alla Cbs, ricordando l’accaduto. «Ero pronto a buttare via tutto dalla finestra. Non provavo un panico del genere da tanto tempo. Qualcosa è chiaramente sfuggito di mano». Pur avendo confermato di aver già assistito a errori dell’IA durante il suo utilizzo per lavoro o ragioni di studio, ha confermato di non aver «mai visto nulla di così grave e apparentemente diretto all’utente». I due si sono detti fortunati di aver avuto reciproco supporto nell’affrontare un momento così delicato dal punto di vista psicologico.\nSebbene Google abbia descritto il messaggio come «privo di senso», il giovane ha sottolineato che sarebbe potuta andare molto peggio a una persona con pregressi problemi di salute mentale. «Se qualcuno si trova da solo e in cattive condizioni, e che potenzialmente sta pensando di farsi male, leggendo qualcosa del genere potrebbe davvero andar fuori di testa».\nL’app intanto arriva su iPhone e tutti i dispositivi iOS\nGoogle Gemini intanto è arrivata anche su iPhone e tutti i dispositivi Apple, dopo essere rimasta finora esclusiva per gli utenti Android. Ampliando il panorama degli assistenti IA sui device con il sistema operativo iOS, offre un’alternativa a Siri anche in Italia, dove il potenziamento con Apple Intelligence arriverà solamente ad aprile 2025. Per usufruirne, è sufficiente scaricare Google Gemini dall’App Store, accedere con il proprio account Google o crearne uno e usare testo, voce e fotocamera per comunicare. È compatibile con tutti i dispositivi che vantano iOS 16.0 o successivi.\nThe Gemini app, now available on iPhone.\nDownload it now in the App Store →\n[https://t.co/et5AspqWJe][pic.twitter.com/5QRC40FTbQ]— Google Gemini App (@GeminiApp)\n[November 14, 2024]",

    "text": "Nationwide — Meet Deanna Dixon, a former backup singer for Beyoncé on her concert tours who is now known as “The Rideshare Queen” on TikTok for serenading her Uber passengers in Atlanta. One day, Dixon had a chance encounter with passenger Tedrien Hill, who generously gave her a $150 tip and encouraged her to buy a dashcam to record her videos to post on social media. “Don’t look down on what you may deem as small beginnings. Because all it takes is one person to see it and to change your life, and for me, that one person that saw me that changed my life was Tedrien,” Dixon told [11Alive](https://www.11alive.com/article/news/community/rideshare-queen-beyonce-deanna-dixon-tiktok/85-ed25da06-5dcb-42f6-a1f4-dbdcd5f33dc7). Now with her dashcam, Dixon has captured candid moments of her serenading her passengers with her soulful voice. Her videos quickly gained popularity on social media, amassing over 80,000 followers and millions of views. Dixon’s newfound fame led to sponsorships and a national deal, allowing her to buy her own car after a year of renting through Uber. In a heartwarming twist, a video captured Dixon reuniting with Hill, whom she affectionately calls her “Earth Angel,” to share the news of her new car purchase. “In my mind, it was a small thing because I was just making a connection, and it wasn’t,” Hill said. “So it makes me think like, there’s no small moments.” Now driving a stylish cobalt blue Tesla with over 100,000 online fans, the Rideshare Queen said she feels more seen. “I feel so free just being my honest, authentic self,” Dixon said. “This is probably my favorite chapter of my life, honestly. I drive for Uber.” Also, be sure to follow her on Instagram [@IAmDeannaDixon](https://www.instagram.com/iamdeannadixon/)",

    "text": ",\nMithilfe seiner Milliardengewinne aus der Online-Werbung will der Facebook-Konzern eine Führungsposition bei Künstlicher Intelligenz erobern.\n31.07.2025 - 06:35:05Facebook-Konzern verspricht KI für jeden\nDie Vision von Meta US30303M1027 sei, \"persönliche Superintelligenz für jeden\" verfügbar zu machen, sagte Gründer und Chef Mark Zuckerberg nach der Vorlage aktueller Quartalszahlen. Es sei sehr wahrscheinlich, dass \"die Welt in wenigen Jahren ziemlich anders aussehen wird\".\nAls Superintelligenz bezeichnet Meta KI, die menschliche Intelligenz in jeder Hinsicht übersteigt. Bei dem Konzern habe man erste Anzeichen von Systemen mit Künstlicher Intelligenz gesehen, die sich selbst verbessern können, sagte Zuckerberg. Damit rücke Superintelligenz in greifbare Nähe - auch wenn ihre Entwicklung noch Zeit brauchen werde.\nLängere Nutzung dank KI-Empfehlungen\nMeta setzt bereits seit Jahren auf Künstliche Intelligenz und nutzt sie unter anderem dafür, Nutzern Beiträge auf den Online-Plattformen des Konzerns vorzuschlagen. Allein im vergangenen Quartal hätten sie dank der besseren Empfehlungen fünf Prozent mehr Zeit bei Facebook und sechs Prozent mehr Zeit bei Instagram verbracht, sagte Zuckerberg.\nZuckerberg hat schon seit längerer Zeit große Ambitionen, Rivalen wie den ChatGPT-Entwickler OpenAI sowie Google US02079K1079 und Elon Musks Firma xAI bei Künstlicher Intelligenz zu überflügeln. Dafür versucht er auch, in großem Stil KI-Experten bei der Konkurrenz abzuwerben. Medienberichten zufolge verspricht Meta ihnen zum Teil als Vergütung einige hundert Millionen Dollar über mehrere Jahre verteilt - und in einem Fall sogar bis zu einer Milliarde Dollar.\nMilliarden rein - Milliarden raus\nDas Geld für die KI-Offensive liefert das boomende Geschäft mit Werbeanzeigen auf den Meta-Plattformen. Im vergangenen Quartal stieg der Umsatz im Jahresvergleich um 22 Prozent auf 47,5 Milliarden Dollar (41,36 Mrd Euro). Der Gewinn sprang um 36 Prozent auf rund 18,34 Milliarden Dollar hoch. Auf mindestens eine App des Konzerns, zu dem auch WhatsApp und Threads gehören, greifen täglich 3,48 Milliarden Nutzer zu.\nMeta geht davon aus, in diesem Jahr mindestens 66 Milliarden Dollar zu investieren, vor allem in KI-Rechenzentren. Die Obergrenze bleibt unverändert bei 72 Milliarden Dollar. Vor drei Monaten setzte Meta das untere Ende der Spanne noch bei 64 Milliarden Dollar an.\nZuckerberg leistet sich auch weiterhin hohe Verluste in der Sparte Reality Labs, in der virtuelle Welten sowie Computer-Brillen entwickelt werden. Er zeigte sich erneut überzeugt, dass Brillen mit Kameras und Lautsprechern ein perfektes KI-Gerät für die Zukunft sein werden - weil die Software damit sehen könne, was die Nutzer gerade sehen. Die Reality Labs fuhren im vergangenen Quartal einen operativen Verlust von 4,5 Milliarden Dollar ein.\nErwartungen übertroffen\nFür das laufende Vierteljahr stellte Meta einen Umsatz zwischen 47,5 Milliarden und 50,5 Milliarden Dollar in Aussicht. Am Markt war mit einer Prognose von lediglich gut 46 Milliarden Dollar gerechnet worden. Auch die Zahlen zum vergangenen Quartal übertrafen die Analystenerwartungen. Die Meta-Aktie legte im nachbörslichen Handel um fast zwölf Prozent auf 782 Dollar zu.\nSollte das Papier auch im regulären Handel so stark anziehen, wäre die Aktie so teuer wie noch nie. Der Börsenwert würde zudem auf die Marke von zwei Billionen Dollar zusteuern. Gemessen am Schlusskurs vom regulären Handel am Dienstag ist Meta 1,75 Billionen Dollar wert.",

    "text": "Chennai: Six members of Hizb-ut-Tahrir (HuT), an international Islamist outfit, have been arrested for anti-national activities such as propaganda against holding elections and democracy, police said on Saturday.\nThe arrested persons include a man in his fifties, his two sons and three others who were aged between 26 and 33, a senior police official said adding provisions of Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) have been invoked against them.\n\"What began as a modest exercise to seek support from followers of Islam for pan-Islamic rule or the Caliphate appeared to grow strong as number of participants in closed-door meetings increased,\" he said.\n\"The group was arrested following their propaganda against conduct of elections, democracy; and participation in the voting exercise and the topic of a propaganda was whether elections were Haram (forbidden by Islamic law) or Halal (lawful under Islamic law) and the verdict was that election and democracy were Haram,\" the senior official told PTI.\nOne of the arguments of HuT members against democracy was that democracy and rule of law was man-made and hence subject to change and not perfect. However, divine law does not fall into such a category and it is supreme.\nThe arrested persons include Hameed Hussain, who holds a doctorate in Mechanical Engineering and till 2021. He had been teaching engineering in colleges. Hussain's father Ahmed Mansoor and brother Abdul Rehman and three others --Mohammed Maurice, Khader Nawaz Sherif and Ahmed Ali-- were also held. All the six men are natives of Chennai.\nHameed Hussain has been posting videos on YouTube advocating his ideology and his father Mansoor held private meetings to further the same cause.\n\"It all began with an initiative to translate Zakir Naik's (fundamentalist Islamic preacher who fled India years ago) preachings into Tamil,\" the official said.\nThe six HuT members were arrested by Chennai police (cyber crime) in an operation closely coordinated by intelligence sleuths. \"Central intelligence agencies are aware of developments related to HuT.\"\nThe HuT is a banned organisation in countries including Bangladesh and the United Kingdom.\nADVERTISEMENT Published 25 May 2024, 14:07 IST",
