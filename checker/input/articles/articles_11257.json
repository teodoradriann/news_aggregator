    "text": "San Diego FC could've used a proven goal scorer Wednesday night.\nToronto shut out SDFC 1-0, for their second win in eight matches. The visitors arrived with just 18 points on the season, tied for the second worst record in Major League Soccer.\nStream San Diego News for free, 24/7, wherever you are with NBC 7.\n WATCH HERE Toronto led 1-0 after a 20th minute penalty kick. Franco Negri committed a foul in the penalty area, surrendering the attempt that Theo Corbeanu converted to give the visitors a leg up.\nSan Diego FC controlled possession like usual in the first half, but headed to the locker room without anything to show for it - not even a single shot.\nGet top local San Diego stories delivered to you every morning with our News Headlines newsletter.\n SIGN UP SDFC held possession for 70.1 percent of the match but only registered two shots on goal.\nIt was a physical match that got chippy at points, with the clubs combining for nine yellow cards.\nThere was a controversial non-call on a handball in the second half that would've given San Diego a shot to get level.\nThe result comes a day after the club parted ways with second leading scorer after the sides failed to reach an agreement on an extension to Iloski's loan, which was set to expire at month's end.\nDespite the loss San Diego FC ends the night where it began - sitting atop the Western Conference table. Second place Minnesota lost 1-0 to LAFC, while third place Vancouver topped Houston 3-0. The Whitecaps started the night four points back of SDFC.\nSan Diego is home for its next five matches, including Saturday's visit from Vancouver.",

    "title": "Megaton Musashi W: Wired Review (PS5)",
    "text": "We've all been waiting years for the return of once prominent Japanese developer Level-5, but you'd be forgiven for being completely ignorant of its latest Western release, [Megaton Musashi W: Wired](games/ps5/megaton_musashi_w_wired). Thanks to what feels like a near total lack of marketing, this awkwardly named action RPG has sailed effortlessly under the radar — but it definitely deserves more attention. Much like [Yo-Kai Watch](https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/yo-kai_watch), Megaton Musashi is a multimedia property from Level-5, spanning games and anime. It's a sci-fi story about humanity making one last stand against an all-conquering alien menace, with Wired putting you in the pilot seat of — you guessed it — a giant robot that can finally turn the tide of this intergalactic war. The title's split between two distinct parts. The first has you wander around 2D environments, talking to key characters in order to progress the plot. The second plops you onto the battlefield in your aforementioned mech, ready to kick some extraterrestrial arse across a large number of objective-based missions. Both the characters and the dialogue appear very trope-heavy at first, but things do get somewhat interesting later on, as the narrative introduces a decent degree of tension between cast members. It's not what we'd call an amazing story, but it holds the action together rather well. Indeed, it's said action that'll keep you playing. With impressively accessible controls and responsive gameplay, there's a lot to like about Megaton Musashi's brand of mechanical carnage. It's fast-paced and punchy — especially when you unleash super attacks — but repeated enemy types do take the edge off ever so slightly. As you progress, you unlock new body parts and weapons for your robot through a generous loot system, which in turn lets you tackle increasingly dangerous missions. Decking out your mech with new equipment does lean into make big number go up territory at times, but it's still an addictive process overall. You can also hop online to tackle missions alongside other players, but at the time of writing this review, the game feels borderline abandoned. It's not a huge deal given the strength of the single-player offering, but it's still something to be aware of. Megaton Musashi W: Wired is one of those games where you can identify its flaws very quickly, but they're not going to stop you from having fun. Ultimately, it's the title's fast-flowing and easy-to-grasp combat that wins the day, bolstered by an addictive loot system and a moreish, mission-based campaign.",

I want to support Berkeleyside!\nThe National Weather Service has issued wind and coastal flooding advisories across the Bay Area, including in Berkeley and Oakland.\nSustained winds of up to 40 mph, with gusts of up to 55 mph, could make it dangerous to drive high-profile vehicles and might knock down tree limbs, causing scattered power outages, according to the NWS Bay Area, which advises residents to “secure outdoor loose objects” and exercise caution on the roads.\nWinds are expected to increase Friday afternoon and evening, with the advisory in effect from 4 p.m. Friday until 7 a.m. Saturday.\nThe National Weather Service Bay Area forecast is summarized here. Courtesy NWS Bay Area Light rain is likely to continue Friday, with more to come through Saturday; about 1 to 2 inches are possible in Berkeley and Oakland. Thunderstorms are also possible overnight into Saturday morning. Sunny weather is expected to return on Sunday.\nOn the flooding front, the possibility of king tides this weekend — higher than normal tides peaking at about 7 feet — has prompted a minor coastal flooding advisory that is in effect until 1 p.m. Monday for low-lying regions along the bay shoreline. The weather service reminds drivers not to drive around barricades or through water of unknown depth.\nConditions will likely also be hazardous for mariners: A small craft advisory is in effect from 3 p.m. to 9 p.m. Friday, with gusts of up to 35 knots and choppy water expected. The advisory will become a warning Friday night, with winds of up to 30 knots and “very rough waters” expected.\n… We have a small favor to ask.

    "title": "Cloudy today with cooler temps and periods of rain in New Jersey",
    "text": "By Mike Rizzo ,\n8 minutes ago\nThere is a coastal flood advisory in effect for the high tide cycles tonight due to the easterly wind and New Moon tides that will cause very minor flooding due to a higher cycle. Showers continue on and off today. The weather is moving faster than predicted and should depart between 10 p.m. and midnight tonight. Temperatures remain in the mid-50s throughout the day.\nTomorrow starts sunny and the weather remains beautiful with a chance for a p.m. cloud or spot shower over the higher elevations north and west in the late afternoon. Highs will be in the lower 60s.\nSunday will be rainy again, with showers moving across New Jersey throughout much of the morning and early afternoon. Conditions improve slowly by the evening and then sunshine returns for Monday and Tuesday. Sunday's temperatures will be cool again.\nMonday's weather warms a bit into the mid-70s. Same for Tuesday with the next round of rain arriving Tuesday night into Wednesday.\nAurora forecast An unusual and rare Coronal Mass Ejection (solar flare) erupted out of the surface of the sun yesterday. This flare send a magnetic field and other particles from the sun toward Earth. They are expected to arrive sometime tonight and through the weekend. Should the timing align with nighttime, Aurora Borealis, AKA the Northern Lights can be very vibrant over the northern hemisphere and they can move farther south than usual. Given the unusual and rare nature of this particular CME/Solar Flare, the aurora can be far enough to be seen along the horizon at higher elevations in Northern New Jersey.\nHistorically, it has been known that the strongest aurora within these types of events can sometimes be seen as far south as the Carolinas and Alabama. Aurora is not easily predictable and does not last the entire nighttime. They arrive, pop up, strengthen, move, and dissipate at unpredictable intervals and intensity. Sometimes we can have a 30 min lead-time in seeing that some measurements are rising but does not always indicate that aurora will be strong on our side of the planet or close to our area. Often, for New Jersey, aurora in these types of storms can be seen low on the horizon, using a camera with a long exposure, at a higher elevation.\nDon't expect aurora to be directly overhead - we'd need an \"extreme\" level storm to even get a better chance of that. Consider this just a greater possibility of seeing a faint green glow on the northern horizon if viewing at nighttime without the pollution of city lights. Lastly, this type of geomagnetic storm can interrupt GPS, radio, and wireless communication functions the closer to the northern poles. This could make GPS act a bit wonky, especially. NOAA is expected to have media advisory and information here .\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "text": "Le parc bruxellois du Wolvendael à Uccle ne pourra pas accueillir les événements estivaux prévus en août et en septembre en raison des dégâts causés par les intempéries du 9 juillet dernier. De nombreux événements seront néanmoins maintenus et délocalisés ailleurs à Uccle. \"Les conditions météorologiques extrêmes du 9 juillet ont causé d’importants dégâts notamment dans le parc de Wolvendael\", explique la commune. \"Au vu des travaux conséquents que les services communaux doivent encore réaliser pour garantir la sécurité du parc, le lieu ne pourra pas accueillir tous les événements phares de la vie uccloise qui s’y déroulent habituellement au mois d’août et à la rentrée.\" Toutefois, afin de permettre aux Ucclois de tout de même profiter des festivités estivales, l’administration a pris la décision – \"quand cela s’avérait possible\" – de les maintenir en les délocalisant dans d’autres lieux du territoire communal. Le \"Zomer Quartier d’été spécial bébé\", qui se déroulera en matinée le 10 août, aura lieu à la bibliothèque du Centre. Les concerts de \"Musiques au parc\", prévus le 18 août, se produiront à la Maison des arts d’Uccle, tandis que \"Place à l’art\" se déroulera le 18 août au parvis Saint-Pierre. \"La Nuit au Wolvendael\", répartie sur le week-end du 24 au 25 août, se tiendra sur la plaine de la Gazelle. En ce qui concerne le Festival Uckel’Air (7 septembre), \"tous les indicateurs de sécurité sont au vert et laissent entrevoir la possibilité que ce festival 100% hip-hop à destination des jeunes pourra être organisé dans le bas du parc au niveau du théâtre de Verdure\", se réjouit la commune. La Brocante des enfants (8 septembre) est, quant à elle, annulée, sachant que la circulation des voitures dans le parc ne sera pas encore possible à cette date.",
