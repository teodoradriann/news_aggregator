    "text": "Global Security and EU Expansion: A Perspective from Lithuania's Rasa Jukneviciene\nEuropean Parliament Votes for Gaza Ceasefire and Acceleration of Humanitarian Aid\nOn January 19, 2024, the European Parliament took a significant stride in global politics by voting on a resolution that addresses the ongoing conflict in Gaza. The resolution, a beacon of hope amidst the continued unrest, calls for an immediate ceasefire in the contentious Gaza Strip and underscores the urgent need to accelerate the delivery of humanitarian aid to those affected in the area.\nA Call for Justice and Peace\nThe European Parliament, recognizing the escalating tensions and humanitarian crisis in Gaza, has expressed its unwavering support for the involvement of the International Court of Justice. This highlights the crucial role that this globally respected institution could play in bringing about justice and restoring peace in the region.\nReviving the Political Process\nThe resolution also proposes the launch of a new European initiative, a strategy aimed to breathe life into the political process once more. The political stalemate that has long gripped the region needs a fresh perspective, and the European Parliament believes that this initiative could provide the impetus for renewed dialogue and understanding.\nConcerns About Violence and Displacement\nFurthermore, the resolution does not shy away from addressing the difficult issues. The European Parliament has expressed its concerns about the violence perpetrated by Zionist settlers in the West Bank and the policies leading to the forced displacement of residents. The displacement of residents is a pressing humanitarian issue that has been overshadowed by the broader conflict, and its inclusion in the resolution is a clear indication of the European Parliament’s commitment to addressing all aspects of the situation.\nIn conclusion, the resolution’s text is a reflection of the European Parliament’s stance on these issues and provides a clear direction for future actions and involvement in the region’s affairs. With the vote on this resolution, the European Parliament has sent a strong message to the world: that peace, justice, and humanitarian aid are not just ideals, but tangible goals that can be achieved through concerted international effort.\nComments\nSubscribe to BNN Breaking\nSign up for our daily newsletter covering global breaking news around the world.",

    "text": "Desert Vipers' Fakhar Zaman plays a shot during their DP World ILT20 match against MI Emirates at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium in Dubai on Thursday.\nMohammad Abdullah, Senior Sports Reporter\nFakhar Zaman smashed a 52-ball 67 to steer Desert Vipers to a five-wicket victory over MI Emirates (MIE) and hand them the third successive win from as many matches at the ILT20 in Dubai on Thursday.\nVipers restricted MIE to 159/6 and reached the target for the loss of five wickets with five balls to spare.\nWith the victory, they tighten the grip on the top spot, procuring six points from three matches.\nA late charge by Zahoor Khan ignited some hopes of come-from-behind win for MIE with a late fightback as he got rid of Zaman and Sam Curran but the damage had been done. Shane Rutherford and Wanindu Hasaranga completed the formalities by taking Vipers past the target.\nVipers started the chase on a positive note. Their openers Zaman and Alex Hales set the tone with a blitzkrieg start. They began the chase slowly as both the openers added only 14 runs in the first three overs.\nIn the 4th over, Hales changed the gears and collected 11 runs off Hosein with the help of two boundaries.\nHe did not stop there as he belted another 12 runs off the next over, bowled by Fazalhaq Farooqi of Afghanistan.\nSeeing his partner, Zaman also flexed his muscles and took 14 runs off the sixth over as Vipers raced to 51 for no loss in the first powerplay.\nHales hit two consecutive boundaries off the first two balls of the seventh over, bowled by Zahoor as Vipers collected 48 runs in four overs.\nWaqar Salamkheil rattled the stumps of Hales to give MIE first breakthrough. After the dismissal of Hales, Vipers lost two more wickets in quick succession and were reduced to 71/3 from 61/0.\nMIE bowlers choked the flow of runs as Zaman and Sam Curran knuckled down to build the innings.\nAs the asking run rate started spiraling, Zaman started to cut loose. He hit Waqar for two successive sixes and took 16 runs off 14th over. He also brought up his fifty with a couple in the same over.\nZaman milked Mousley for another 16 runs in the next over. He titled the game in Vipers’ favour by taking 32 runs in two overs.\nZaman smashed Farooqi for another 13 runs to bring the equation down 29 needed off four overs from 74 off 42 balls.\nEarlier, openers Kusal Perera and Muhammad Waseem gave MI Emirates (MIE) a solid start. They added 48 runs for the first wickets to give a strong platform for a big total.\nBoth the batsmen played sensibly and kept the Vipers bowlers at bay. They exploited the powerplay and added 48 runs in the first six overs.\nPerera was the more brutal of the two as he did most of the scoring while Waseem played a perfect foil to him. Vipers bowlers were struggling to break the partnership as they did not look like a pale shadow of the same attack who destroyed Gulf Giants completely in the last match.\nVipers needed to break the dangerous-looking partnership to put a brake on the run rate.\nIt was Sri Lankan spinner Hasaranga, who gave Vipers the much-needed breakthrough by trapping Waseem in front of stumps.\nHe broke the partnership to bring some respite to the Vipers’ camp, Dismissal of Waseem opened the floodgates for Vipers bowlers as they ripped through the middle-order of the MIE.\nMIE kept on losing the wickets at regular intervals after that and could not get the partnerships going.\nAfter the dismissal of Waseem, Perera also could not last long as he was sent back to the pavilion by Lawerence, who got him caught by Rutherford as MIE lost their second wicket for 64.\nLockie Ferguson got rid of captain Nichlos Pooran to make it 86/3. Every time MIE batsmen tried to take a stride forward they were pegged back by two by a charged-up Vipers attack.\nAn agile Hasaranga dislodge the bails with a direct throw to find Tom Banton short of his ground off the next delivery. MIE lost two wickets in two balls.\nVipers bowlers fought back to dismantle the innings as MIE were reduced to 86/4 from 48/0. They lost four wickets and added just 38 runs in the next six over after the first powerplay.\nKieron Pollard and Dan Mousley shared a 37-run stand for the fifth wicket to take the score forward before the latter holed out to Lawrence off Payne as the fifth wicket went down.\nThey consumed too many deliveries as the duo took five overs to add 37 runs which affected the run rate. Pollard was waging the lone battle with a fiery knock of 36 off 23 deliveries.\nHe was well supported by Romario Shepherd smacked a quick-fire 8-ball 16 to spur the run rate as MIE ended their innings on 159/6 in 20 overs.",

    "title": "Aceras más anchas contra la doble fila - La Opinión de A Coruña",
    "text": "La ampliación del espacio peatonal en la calle Betanzos, en la zona de la plaza de Lugo, impactará también en una de las infracciones de tráfico más habituales que sanciona la Policía Local: la doble fila. Las obras que ejecuta el Ayuntamiento desde finales de mayo en esta vía del Ensanche supondrán más espacio para los peatones y conservarán las plazas de estacionamiento disponibles antes de la reforma, pero eliminarán uno de los carriles de circulación, por lo que, en la práctica, la doble fila quedará erradicada. Tras la reforma, un coche mal estacionado supondrá el colapso total de la calle. La adopción de medidas que eviten el aparcamiento incorrecto es precisamente uno de los objetivos del Plan de Movilidad Urbana Sostenible (PMUS) de A Coruña. La dimensión final de la vía de circulación será de 3,50 metros para el paso de vehículos, de acuerdo con la información remitida por el Gobierno local. Las aceras a ambos márgenes ganarán un ancho de un metro cada una, dando más espacio para los viandantes. Los pasos peatonales de los cruces con las calles Teresa Herrera y Francisco Mariño serán también elevados para hacer que la calzada esté al mismo nivel que el pavimento. Carga y descarga Las obras mantendrán las plazas de carga y descarga reservadas para los vehículos de reparto que dan servicio a los comercios de la zona. De esta forma la calle Betanzos podrá continuar con la circulación fluida evitando las retenciones causadas por los turismos y furgonetas estacionados incorrectamente. La renovación de las aceras permitirá también plantar más árboles, así como añadir nuevos elementos de mobiliario urbano para dar servicio a uno de los principales núcleos comerciales del Ensanche. La obra se completará con la instalación del pavimento de losas de granito gris, igual al de la calle Compostela y la plaza, para homogeneizar así la imagen de la contorna. Ya parcialmente terminados están los trabajos de sustitución de la antigua red de saneamiento, que forma parte del recorrido que va desde la calle Juan Flórez a Rosalía de Castro. Las obras en la calle Betanzos tienen un presupuesto de más de 300.000 euros. Está previsto que se terminen de ejecutar a finales de de agosto, según informó el Ayuntamiento el pasado mes de mayo.",

Last month, another anti-aircraft defence system in Tel Qulaib and Tel Maseeh in southern Syria were hit in what the senior intelligence sources said was an intensified campaign by Israel to disrupt Syrian air defence systems that Iran was involved in expanding. [Reuters](https://www.devdiscourse.com/reuters-stories)| Updated: 29-12-2023 04:08 IST | Created: 29-12-2023 04:08 IST Israel carried out an aerial strike targeting a main Syrian air defence base in southern Syria on Thursday in the latest bombing campaign since the outbreak of war in Gaza on Oct. 7, Syrian army and intelligence sources said. Citing a Syrian military source, state media had earlier said missile strikes coming from the direction of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights had targeted several sites it did not identify. \"Our air defences confronted the (Israeli) aggressors' missiles and downed some of them with only material losses,\" a Syrian military source said. Reuters could not independently verify the report. There was no immediate comment from Israel's military. Since the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas on Israeli civilians and soldiers, Israel has escalated its strikes on Iranian-backed militia targets in Syria and also struck Syrian army air defences and some Syrian forces. The strikes are believed to have targeted a Syrian army air defence base and a radar station in the Tel al-Sahn area in the Sweida province in southwestern Syria, according to a Syrian military intelligence source and another regional security official familiar with the matter. Last month, another anti-aircraft defence system in Tel Qulaib and Tel Maseeh in southern Syria were hit in what the senior intelligence sources said was an intensified campaign by Israel to disrupt Syrian air defence systems that Iran was involved in expanding. \"Tehran is stepping up its efforts to provide Syria with air defence systems that can potentially erode of the effectiveness of Israeli strikes,\" said another regional military source who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. \"This is related to the Gaza war calculations in the event of the conflict spreading,\" he added. Israel has for years carried out attacks on what it has described as Iran-linked targets in Syria, where Tehran's influence has grown since it began supporting President Bashar al-Assad in a civil war that started in 2011. The strikes are part of an escalation of what has been a low-intensity conflict with a goal of slowing Iran's growing entrenchment in Syria, Israeli military experts say. Fighters allied with Iran, including Hezbollah, now hold sway in vast areas in eastern, southern and northwestern Syria and in several suburbs around the capital.

    "text": "Las Rayadas del Monterrey no lograron romper la mala racha y cayó 1-0 frente a las tuzas del Pachuca en la final del torneo Campeón de Campeonas, celebrada en San Antonio, Texas. El equipo regiomontano sumó así su tercer intento fallido por conquistar este trofeo, tras haberlo perdido anteriormente ante Chivas y Tigres Femenil.\nEl único gol del encuentro cayó al minuto 54, luego de que Nina Nicosia robara un balón en campo rival, ingresara al área y definiera con un disparo cruzado que venció a la arquera albiazul. Ese tanto resultó suficiente para darle el título al cuadro hidalguense y agravar la sequía de las Rayadas en esta competencia.\nAunque Monterrey intentó reaccionar en la recta final del partido, el equipo no encontró la contundencia necesaria para igualar el marcador. Tuzas, por su parte, mantuvo el orden defensivo y selló la victoria que las consagra como campeonas absolutas.\nTe podría interesar\nCon este resultado, las dirigidas por Amelia Valverde prolongan la deuda pendiente con su afición en este torneo, al sumar su tercera final perdida en la disputa del Campeón de Campeonas.",
