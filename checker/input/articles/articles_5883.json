    "text": "El Hospital Quirónsalud Málaga ha sido incluido en el TOP 50 de mejores hospitales de España en el ranking World's Best Hospitals 2024 de la prestigiosa revista Newsweek como el mejor hospital privado de Andalucía y el mejor hospital de Málaga, teniendo en cuenta tanto los de gestión pública como privada. Así lo han informado desde el grupo hospitalario en un comunicado, apuntando que Quirónsalud Málaga repite presencia en esta lista por quinto año consecutivo, en el puesto 33. El Hospital Quirónsalud Sagrado Corazón también vuelve a aparecer en un lugar destacado de la lista (47), junto con Quirónsalud Málaga, los dos únicos centros privados de Andalucía entre los 50 mejores hospitales de España. La prestigiosa revista Newsweek ha publicado la última edición de su ranking World's Best Hospitals 2024, que destaca a diez hospitales de Quirónsalud entre los mejores hospitales de España, nueve de ellos en el top 50.

    "title": "35 of Pennsylvania's 67 counties are experiencing drought conditions, including 8 of 10 in Central PA",
    "text": "HARRISBURG, Pa. — After nearly a month of consistently dry weather, [drought conditions have returned](https://www.fox43.com/article/weather/drought-watchwarning-lifted-pennsylvania/521-f06f624d-c4f5-4797-965b-cc363818ac4b) to more than half of Pennsylvania's 67 counties, including eight of 10 counties in Central PA, the state Department of Environmental Protection said Friday. The Pennsylvania Drought Task Force on Friday announced that Adams, Allegheny, Beaver, Bucks, Butler, Carbon, Chester, Clearfield, Columbia, Cumberland, Dauphin, Delaware, Fayette, Franklin, Greene, Indiana, Lancaster, Lawrence, Lebanon, Lehigh, Luzerne, Monroe, Montgomery, Montour, Northampton, Northumberland, Perry, Philadelphia, Pike, Somerset, Washington, Westmoreland and York counties are under a Drought Watch, and Berks and Schuylkill counties are under a Drought Warning due to consistent dry conditions. The Drought Task Force is monitoring other areas of the state, the DEP said. While not required, residents and businesses are encouraged to voluntarily conserve water by reducing nonessential water use, the Task Force said. Public water suppliers may request water conservation measures to ensure reliable delivery of drinking water. “Pennsylvania received very little rain over September and October, capping off a dry six months, particularly in the southeast part of the state. DEP makes drought declarations based on long-term trends; a rainy week may not lift the drought status for an area,” said DEP Acting Secretary Jessica Shirley. “We want residents to be aware of these conditions and be mindful of their water use.” “Much of the Commonwealth is at a high risk for fire danger as a result of dry conditions, and it is critical that Pennsylvanians use extreme caution when handling fire or avoid any burning as these conditions persist,” Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR) Secretary Cindy Adams Dunn said. “Stay up to date with the latest information using DCNR’s [Wildfire Danger Forecast Map](https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.mediaoutreach.meltwater.com%2Fls%2Fclick%3Fupn%3Du001.5jpw0ENHomUkTUsaJkP6C5W6cnzjxz5fB8uM5CwaKJRGD4gRXZXU-2FVu0j4VtrFl894DE6A0N73plTpi93PaeH2fp-2BCvmlq0xXZTf8kFbSg5aTFRczZacIMbar8ZFjjw2-2FY41NZOjAE76aUhrK-2BRx8A-3D-3Dtxc-_YYFvQ5-2BEPn8C1cQsu9dAbCUjModwuSrDARxYkYim4ZsWgp-2B8Jlh-2BIg4t2FRqWc-2F9N1JJWD5vxLlEJ7sUSYZW9eEs-2FiNY3RIe8IInOXgog1ErVUCzIKGoidhUCBSuKUJdkDUo2QCAKEYMuMfq1tpkddP9H9xuWsGXLF5W06TAFigDlYV05zSzlpMIv1ArjxAYZYgPHuVEjNs2r1qPzi8b1mKQrg87Q2eNuVcGYSQqbmhMPIHsOqNWyh-2FxFfr4BNPITERTswlNGg4IaG6dGPs8aLOmP58hdKIw7r0P-2BpY-2BkhDHEGOdQawLGY4J8jqW-2F527h0NuYVBD-2F3EmHahemwF92rvzwcdfRVHWUlpYttUXWxu0rJ4gTFJGl-2BGY5O6jT0zD&data=05%7C02%7Cnews%40fox43.com%7Ca7df49f82f994ae1a41e08dcfa82ad92%7Cccd8a79b7268413b878971f8b6f4c0df%7C1%7C0%7C638660686381557375%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=JwMOTpbiRptM5KK15q4Nw5Xlh0igWuYIWNkAE5E9p4s%3D&reserved=0) and be sure to follow all local guidance pertaining to burn bans to do your part to keep our natural resources and communities safe from fire.” “Water is essential for growing food. Voluntary restrictions do not apply to farms and other businesses that rely on it to produce food,” Agriculture Secretary Russell Redding said. “Risks and volatility in farming are weather-related more than in any other business. Pennsylvania’s beneficial natural average rainfall has been upended by weather extremes and unpredictability in recent years and 2024 is no exception. Nearly 40 percent of the topsoil across the state is either short or very short in moisture content in the past week, and several counties are eligible for federal relief for earlier drought conditions or flooding. “It’s critical for farmers to keep track of losses, and take advantage of federal crop insurance to help recoup losses. State conservation funding and business planning grants help protect their soil, diversify their operations, and cushion against future weather extremes. Planning cannot change the weather, but it can help farm businesses manage the risks that come with it.” Drought declarations are based on four factors – precipitation, stream flows, groundwater levels and soil moisture. DEP makes its drought declarations after assessing the departures from normal ranges for periods of 3-12 months. DEP also factors in information it receives from public water suppliers. There are several different stages of drought declaration that can be declared by the Commonwealth: Drought Watch, Drought Warning and Drought Emergency. - Drought Watch – a Drought Watch is typically declared for a county with three of the four factors in a “watch” status. Residents are encouraged, but not required, to voluntarily reduce their water use by five to ten percent. - Drought Warning – a Drought Warning is typically declared for a county with 3 of the four indicators in “warning” status. Residents are encouraged, but not required, to reduce their water use by 10-15 percent. - Drought Emergency – if conditions become more severe, a Drought Emergency can be declared by the Governor and emergency water restrictions can be implemented. In the unlikely event of a drought emergency, water suppliers and/or municipal governments will guide residents about water use and conservation. DEP will not implement mandatory water use restrictions outside of a Drought Emergency. Individual public water systems may implement their own conservation measures. Dry conditions have also heightened wildfire risk, according to DEP.",

    "title": "Tottenham icon heeds exit advice as MLS move is at ‘final stages’, ending 11-year stay",
    "text": "Hugo Lloris, March 2023\nHugo Lloris is reportedly nearing the ‘final stages’ of talks with MLS side Los Angeles FC, which would end his 11-year spell as a Tottenham player.\nLloris has played 444 times for the north London outfit since joining from Lyon in 2012. He’s currently in his 11th season, but is yet to make a squad this term, with Guglielmo Vicario and Fraser Forster both ahead of him in the pecking order.\nThere was interest in Lloris in the summer, but he remained with Spurs. Ange Postecoglou has all but confirmed that the goalkeeper will leave, though, having told he, Eric Dier and Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg to find new clubs in January.\nBoth Lloris and Dier are out of contract at the end of the season anyway, but the former’s exit seems as if it will come sooner than that.\nIndeed, the Daily Mail reports Lloris is ‘in talks’ with LA FC regarding a move to the MLS. Those talks seem to have progressed well to this point, as it’s said discussions over the move are at the ‘final stages’.\nThe report suggests that the Frenchman will move in the middle of the season rather than signing a contract for the summer.\nIt’s not clear if LA FC will have to pay a fee, given Lloris is not actually due to leave Tottenham until then, but given he hasn’t played all season, and has been a loyal servant to Tottenham, they may well allow him to walk out the door now.\nLloris will not be the only high-profile player to have made a move to the MLS club of late if it is to go through. Indeed, former Juventus man Giorgio Chiellini moved in the summer of 2022.\nHe’s played 45 times for LA since moving to the club, playing alongside captain Carlos Vela, who moved from Real Sociedad in 2018.",

    "title": "\"Educational Resilience: Gaza's Children Soar Above the Rubble to Continue Learning Amidst War",
    "text": "Gaza / PNN /\nIn the words of Mr. Mohammed Al-Khudari, a teacher of Arabic language and literature, and a learning difficulties specialist, the children of Gaza and the Palestinian people are like the phoenix, emerging from the ruins to continue the process of education, soaring in the skies of knowledge and creativity.\nMr. Al-Khudari, who faced the bombing and destruction that targeted his home and school in the Shejaiya area, lost several family members in the process. Amidst the fear and confusion, some of his family and neighbors remained under the rubble, later transferred to Shifa Hospital, and eventually relocated to Deir al-Balah, an area that also witnessed destruction.\nFeeling a professional responsibility as a teacher, Mr. Al-Khudari believed it was crucial to have a positive impact on life and society. Thus, he initiated the educational project \"Continuing in Knowledge and Education Despite War and Destruction.\" This initiative, covering grades one to six, aimed to teach students the basics of the Arabic language while addressing the challenges of learning. He emphasized that everyone is aware of the trauma and destruction suffered by the children due to war, yet he felt compelled to contribute positively to their lives.\nAccording to Mr. Al-Khudari, the initiative began by teaching students' poetry, prose, and poems as an attempt to simulate the educational environment in terms of speech, delivery, and oratory. All that they learned in the educational environment was applied in the classroom setting, particularly in the makeshift schools for displaced students.\nDespite facing numerous challenges, Mr. Al-Khudari acknowledged the students' fear and the logistical difficulties related to seating, books, and notebooks, but he expressed determination to defy the impossible in order to continue the initiative. He remains hopeful that the initiative will persist and expand even after the cessation of hostilities in Gaza.\nStudents Share Their Happiness with the Experience:\nYasmine Haggag, a student, expressed the loss of crucial information in subjects like mathematics, Arabic, and English due to the destruction of their school. She highlighted the importance of education in their lives and the significant role that school plays in teaching them valuable skills for the future.\nMaryam Bassam, another student, emphasized that the arrival of Mr. Mohammed and the launch of these teaching sessions helped them learn all their academic subjects, reflecting the positive impact of the initiative on the students' education and well-being.\nMaryam Bassam, another student, added that the most beautiful aspect of studying with Mr. Mohammed is that he brings prizes and gifts. In some lessons, he even draws on the faces of the students, making them feel loved. He teaches and guides all the students who have grown to love him and eagerly participate in his classes.\nStudent Tala Kuhail expressed that Mr. Mohammed's presence, teaching, and reminders about school and the information they studied are excellent. She acknowledged that they lost all their knowledge due to not attending school during the war. She expressed deep gratitude to him for coming to teach them and hoped that the war would end so they could return to school and reunite with friends.\nThe students' eagerness for learning:\nMr. Mohammed Al-Khudari highlighted the students' keen interest in learning, both in terms of reviewing poetry and beautiful things. He mentioned using attractive tools with children, such as dolls, puppetry, and storytelling, to encourage them to study amidst the challenges of war and displacement.\nParents express gratitude:\nParents of the students in the displaced teaching tents expressed their thanks and appreciation for Mr. Mohammed Al-Khudari's initiative, despite all the difficulties. Yaser Al-Attar, a parent, expressed gratitude for Mr. Mohammed's efforts, emphasizing the challenging circumstances under which the initiative is taking place.\nAl-Attar mentioned that, under the prolonged war conditions, children are mentally exhausted, and Mr. Mohammed's initiative comes at the right time. He appreciated the initiative's impact on educating and engaging the children.\nHe thanked Mr. Mohammed Al-Khudari and all those supporting the displaced and their children, contributing to the preservation of their education.\nMr. Mohammed hopes for support and development of his initiative:\nMr. Mohammed concluded by expressing hope for support from various entities and initiatives to help him and the children continue their educational journey. He also hoped for the development of this initiative into a reputable academic institution capable of accommodating all children in the Gaza Strip, contributing to the ongoing educational process. He emphasized that nations are recognized through knowledge and education.\nThis story was produced as part of the Qareeb program implemented by the French Media Development Agency (CFI) in partnership with funding from the French Agency for International Cooperation (AFD).",

    "text": "This month is Plastic Free July, a global movement to minimize plastic waste. Plastic Free July is all about taking small steps to reduce our use of single-use plastic and keep plastic trash out of our ecosystems and waterways.

It's estimated that 2021's Plastic Free July eliminated more than 2 million tons of plastic waste. As consumers become more aware of the dangers of [microplastics](https://bestreviews.com/articles/health-and-wellness/digestion/how-to-avoid-consuming-microplastics) and the threat plastic trash poses to Earth's oceans, pressure is growing on manufacturers to reduce their introduction of petroleum-based fabrics, including polyester and nylon, as well as their reliance on plastic packaging. Individual consumers can also do their part by educating themselves on plastic pollution, recycling and alternatives to single-use plastics. Try some of these ideas as part of your Plastic Free July pledge: Ultimately, we as consumers can use Plastic Free July as a way to implement small changes that can establish better habits. However, our impact as individuals is always going to be tiny compared to the plastic waste generated by companies. In fact, research has found that about 50 companies are responsible for more than half of the branded plastic found in the environment. Plus, single-use plastics play an important role in some settings and for people with accessibility needs, so they can't be eliminated entirely without some major systemic changes. To make your Plastic Free July pledge go farther, spend some time this month contacting your representatives to pressure companies and manufacturers to reduce their reliance on plastic, especially plastic packaging. Ask your local government to model sustainable behaviors to set a good example for the wider community.

    "text": "(Reuters) – Moldovan prosecutors said on Thursday they opened a criminal case against the former chief of general staff of Moldova’s armed forces following a media report alleging he had spied for Russia.\nThe Insider, a Russian investigative outlet, in cooperation with Moldovan publication Malenkaya Strana reported last week that former army official Igor Gorgan passed sensitive information about both Moldova and neighbouring Ukraine to Russia’s intelligence services. He served as the army’s chief of staff from 2013-2016 and from 2019-2021.\nIn a statement, prosecutors said Gorgan was suspected of “alleged subversive actions for transferring to a foreign state and its representatives some data concerning Moldova’s national defense system”.\nFollowing the publication, Gorgan was suspended from his current position as head of security at the Chisinau office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, the office’s press secretary said.\nGorgan has not commented on the media investigation or prosecutors’ statement. He could not be reached for comment. There was no comment from Russia.\nGorgan, dismissed by pro-European President Maia Sandu as chief of staff in 2021, is a graduate of a Soviet-era military school. Sandu said he would be stripped of his rank of general as well as of his state honours.\nMoldova’s relations have deteriorated with the Kremlin during Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Its pro-Western government has staunchly condemned the invasion and accused Moscow of plotting to overthrow the Moldova government.\n(Reporting by Alexander Tanas; Writing by Yuliia Dysa; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)",

    "text": "La Paz, 26 de septiembre de 2024 (ABI). – En la XXIV Reunión del Consejo Político del ALBA-TCP, la canciller Celinda Sosa denunció que Bolivia se encuentra ante el peligro de un nuevo quebrantamiento del orden constitucional encabezado por el expresidente Evo Morales. “Lamentamos que una fracción del movimiento político encabezado por el expresidente Evo Morales impulse acciones violentas contra el propósito de acortar el mandato constitucional de nuestro hermano presidente (Luis Arce)”, afirmó. El Gobierno nacional hizo llamados al diálogo, sin embargo, la respuesta hasta el momento es condicionada. “Ponemos en su conocimiento esta denuncia, al mismo tiempo que ratificamos la voluntad de nuestro Gobierno de resolver las demandas y preocupaciones de las movilizaciones de la manera pacífica y en el marco del respeto de los derechos humanos de todos los bolivianos”, explicó. Morales convocó y encabezó una marcha de siete días que empezó en Caracollo y terminó en La Paz con un pliego que tiene como principal tema asegurar su postulación. Entre este jueves y viernes el evismo evalúa la marcha y alista su bloqueo de caminos desde el 30 de septiembre. El expresidente y sus voceros coincidieron en sus discursos en acortar el mandato de Arce. En el inicio de la marcha, Morales dijo que el presidente del Senado, Andrónico Rodríguez, asumirá la presidencia de Bolivia, tras la dimisión de Arce y del vicepresidente David Choquehuanca. Voceros como Poncio Santos exigen la renuncia del presidente. Sosa expresó también su solidaridad con países del bloque antiimperialista que sufren intentos de golpe de Estado e injerencia externa que busca la desestabilización y el derrocamiento de legítimos gobiernos elegidos democráticamente. “Nuestra soberanía está bajo la amenaza y los intereses geopolíticos que, una vez más, intentan apropiarse de nuestros recursos naturales, por ello reafirmamos que solo unidos, respetando nuestras diferencias y defendiendo la soberanía de nuestro pueblo y promoviendo la justicia de todas sus formas, podremos construir un futuro que nuestras naciones y nuestros pueblos merecen”, reflexionó. Condenó el bloqueo económico impuesto a Cuba por parte de Estados Unidos y exigió el cese de las medidas coercitivas unilaterales contra Nicaragua y Venezuela. Sosa demandó la unidad de los países para la defensa de la soberanía de los pueblos de América Latina y consolidar la paz en la región. nj/CC",
