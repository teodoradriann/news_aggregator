    "title": "Lady Cats Stand-Out Freshman Track Star Chasing State Dreams",
    "text": "SAN ANGELO, TX — The postseason for High School Track & Field is in full swing, and several members of the San Angelo Central High School Bobcats and Lady Cats track teams performed well enough at the Area track meet last weekend to qualify for Regionals. One of those qualifiers is Lady Cats Freshman Sydney Crooks.\nWhile it is impressive for any athlete to qualify for the Regional meet, Crooks qualified in two out of her three events last weekend, the High Jump and Long Jump (she also competes in the Triple Jump). She and the rest of her team will head to Arlington on Thursday, April 18, to compete in the 6A Region I Track Meet at Maverick Stadium at UT Arlington beginning on Friday.\nCentral also sends the Bobcats 4x100-meter relay team and Lady Cats 4x100-meter relay team and 4x200-meter relay team along with Jace Jackson in the 100-meter dash to Regionals in 2024.\nIt is uncommon for a freshman to qualify for a high-level varsity meet at 15 years old. This usually means the athlete is pretty special. Sydney expressed her thoughts on Regionals in an interview earlier this week.\n“So, my nerves are definitely up,” Crooks said. “Just the adrenaline going into the events itself. It’s just a whole new scenery, from volleyball on a court to competing outside. It’s a totally different environment, but I’m all in for it.”\nFor those not in the know, Crooks also made Central’s Varsity Volleyball team as a Freshman last fall. At 14 years old at the time, she was one of the youngest 6A varsity volleyball players in the state.\nSydney will compete in two events at Regionals. She qualified in the High Jump and the Long Jump and now has her sights set even higher, State.\n“So this week, I really practiced on one of the events that I’m confident I can have a chance to go to state in. High Jump,” Crooks said later. “I’m going to hit this Regional Track meet super hard and then see if I advance. If I do, it will then be more work and I’m here for all of it.”\nCrooks has had one of the most successful Freshman campaigns in Lady Cat history this year. She holds the freshman record for the High Jump and the Long Jump and 2nd place for the Freshman Triple Jump. As far as overall track records go for Central High School, she has some work to do, but she is already biting at the heels of the record books on varsity.\n“I think I am fourth right now at the all-time Central record,” Crooks said.\nWhen asked if she wanted to shatter those records by the time she graduated, she was confident in her reply.\n“Yes, I’m pretty sure I can do it,” she said.\nSydney began her Track & Field career in middle school, where she attended Lincoln Middle School on the Northside.\n“So I ran track (at Lincoln) my seventh-grade year, and I ran everything,” Crooks said. “I ran the 100m Hurdles, the 300m Hurdles, and 100m Dash, triple jump, and high jump. The love started there. I took a break in eighth grade to prepare myself for volleyball in high school, but once I hit high school, I went all in for all sports. So yeah, the love started in 7th grade.”\nThe up-and-coming Lady Cats star has big aspirations for the future. She hopes to continue to improve in volleyball and track to the point where universities around the country notice.\n“Volleyball is my number one dream I would say,” Crooks said of her future ambitions. “But I would love to be a dual athlete in college.”\nLike many in San Angelo, she has a good eye for where she wants to attend school in the future.\n“Texas Tech has a very successful track and field program,” she said, describing where she would like to run track in the future. “That would be amazing.”\nIf Division I schools notice her in volleyball, Crooks said that her dream would be to play for the premiere powerhouses in college volleyball like Texas or Nebraska.\nCrooks has a bright future at Central, but all the ‘Cats and Lady Cats who qualified for the Regional Meet need everyone's support this weekend. I wish them the best as they try to qualify for state in Austin in a few weeks.",

    "text": "O Atlético voltou aos treinamentos na tarde desta quarta-feira (19), na Cidade do Galo, dando início à preparação para a estreia no Campeonato Brasileiro e na Copa Sul-Americana. O elenco realizou atividades técnico-táticas comandadas por Cuca nos campos 6 e 7 do CT.\nO atacante Brahian Palacios, recuperado de lesão muscular na coxa esquerda, treinou normalmente. O colombiano esteve envolvido em negociação com o Vasco, mas seguirá no Alvinegro para a temporada, após a saída do atacante Alisson.\nEntre os desfalques do dia, destaque para Hulk. O camisa 7, que chegou a entrar em campo nos minutos finais da decisão do Campeonato Mineiro contra o América, permaneceu na fisioterapia, dando continuidade ao tratamento de sua lesão na coxa direita.\nO atacante tem sido peça-chave do time, é artilheiro do elenco no ano (8 gols), e sua recuperação é monitorada de perto pelo departamento médico. Além dele, os atacantes Caio Maia, Júnior Santos e Cadu também seguem em tratamento.\nO Galo ainda não conta com três jogadores que estão servindo suas seleções nas Eliminatórias para a Copa do Mundo: Guilherme Arana (Brasil), Junior Alonso (Paraguai) e Alan Franco (Equador).\nO primeiro compromisso do Atlético na Série A do Brasileirão será contra o Grêmio, no dia 29 de março, às 18h30, em Porto Alegre. Poucos dias depois, no dia 1º de abril, a equipe alvinegra estreia na fase de grupos da Sul-Americana, enfrentando o Cienciano, em Cusco, às 21h30.",

( Image courtesy of <a href=https://decaderesources.ca/projects/grassy/\" target=\"_blank\">Decade Resources. ) Topics Mining Commodities Gold Silver Regions Canada Tags Exploration Companies Decade Resources Decade Resources (TSXV: DEC) completed a successful surface exploration program on its Grassy property, 24 km north of Stewart, B.C., in that province’s famed Golden Triangle. The company sampled 31.9 g/t gold and 5,184 g/t silver.\nThe Grassy property consists of 830 ha in two separate, 100%-owned claims. The site is 6 km north of the former Premier gold mine being redeveloped by Ascot Resources (TSX: AOT; otcqx: aotvf), and it is contiguous with the Big Missouri property.\nThe bulk of the Grassy mineralization is located in four areas that have been explored by trenching and short adits in the past. These areas include the Start, Bush, Lakeshore, and Rama showings within a 4- to 5-metre-wide quartz-carbonate breccia zone. Mineralization generally consists of coarse-grained pyrite, sphalerite, galena and chalcopyrite in these breccia veins.\n\"The company is very pleased to have outlined and sampled higher grade portions of this strong structure. These are the highest grade assays taken by the Company to date. The work outlined two areas for diamond drilling in the future,\" said Decade president Ed Kruchkowski.\nFor a complete listing of the company assets and developments, visit www.DecadeResources.ca .\nComments Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

    "text": "French Scientific Agency Selects Pierre Deymier for Prestigious Fellow-Ambassador Role Pierre Deymier, professor of materials science and engineering at the University of Arizona, is among eight of the world's top scientists to be named to France's National Centre for Scientific Research second class of fellow-ambassadors. France's national agency for scientific research, known as CNRS, began the fellow-ambassadors program in 2023 to enrich its country's research efforts and international profile. The agency [announced the class](https://www.cnrs.fr/en/update/cnrs-fellow-ambassadors-second-class-revealed#:~:text=The%20second%20class%20of%20CNRS,Kyulux%20and%20Koala%3B%20Pierre%20A.) in March. Through the program¸ which is rooted in the academic tradition of eminent visiting professors, the agency invites a few celebrated minds to commit to spending at least one month per year for three years in French laboratories. The first class of 10 CNRS fellow-ambassadors included Saul Perlmutter, who won the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery that the expansion of the Universe is accelerating. Deymier's class includes Ardem Patapoutian, another Nobel Prize awardee, and Nicola Spaldin, a professor at ETH Zurich who won the L'Oréal-UNESCO Women in Science International Award in recognition of her materials science work. More Than a Fellowship The \"ambassador\" part of Deymier's new title is important to him. \"It's not just a fellowship,\" said Deymier, also a member of the [BIO5 Institute](https://bio5.org/) and on the faculty for the [Applied Mathematics Graduate Interdisciplinary Program](https://gidp.arizona.edu/academic-programs/applied-mathematics). \"It means serving as a bridge between the science research in the U.S. and that of our French counterparts. It's trying to bridge French and American research to make bigger and faster progress.\" Deymier, who is a native of France, has been collaborating with colleagues there for decades and will now have more resources to expand on that work. The CNRS has a budget of about $4.3 billion, operates 1,100 research labs, and employs 33,000 people. In addition to helping him develop new research activities, the fellowship will strengthen Deymier's ties to scientists at the University of Lille and the CNRS' Institute of Electronics, Microelectronics and Nanotechnology. They're working with topological acoustics – methods of exploiting the properties of sound in new ways that could vastly improve technologies. Topological acoustics holds the promise to make computers faster, extend the life of cellphone batteries, improve medical testing and reveal thawing of permafrost, to name a few examples. \"Many French laboratories are doing really cutting-edge research in this field,\" he said. \"The collaborations are going to be very useful, not only to the French laboratories, but also to the New Frontiers of Sound Science and Technology Center and the research that we're doing at the University of Arizona.\" Deymier leads the center, which was established in 2023 with a [$30 million award from the National Science Foundation](https://news.engineering.arizona.edu/news/ua-scientists-investigate-new-frontiers-sound-30m-center). New Frontiers of Sound unites researchers from several universities working with topological acoustics. \"As the New Frontiers of Sound Center director, Pierre fosters collaborations with leading scientists and thought leaders around the world,\" said Sammy Tin, head of the [Department of Materials Science and Engineering](https://mse.engineering.arizona.edu/) and the Patrick R. Taylor Endowed Department Leadership Chair. \"Being elected as a CNRS fellow-ambassador enables him to do precisely that, as he will conduct pioneering research related to acoustic metamaterials with scientists from CNRS labs.\" 39 Years of UA Contributions “I’ve never been much interested in prestige. I do the work and forget about trying to get awards,” said Deymier. “But I'm proud of this, because it shows the international standing of the research and the work that I've been doing here at the University of Arizona, that this research has international impact.” In addition to his work with topological acoustics, Deymier is recognized for contributions in fields including materials theory, acoustic metamaterials, biomaterials and thermodynamics. In 2023, he was awarded the International Phononics Society’s [Bloch Prize](https://news.engineering.arizona.edu/news/phononics-society-recognizes-ua-professor-pioneering-role-field) for “outstanding and sustained contributions in the field of phononics.” Phononics is a branch of physics concerning phonons, a type of quasi-particle that carries sound and heat. “I’ve been working on very diverse topics. I think that was appealing to the CNRS,” he said. Deymier joined the university faculty in 1985 and is the author of 228 refereed publications and the editor, author or co-author of three books and six book chapters. He served as the director for the School of Sustainable Engineered Systems at the UA from 2009 to 2017 and as the head of the materials science and engineering department from 2011 to 2021. He holds 12 patents and patent applications. “I cannot think of a person more deserving of this recognition than Pierre, and I look forward to working with him for many years to come,” said Tin.",

    "title": "LIBBY PURVES: To mark 100 years of the Shipping Forecast, one sailor makes a lyrical tribute... 'A blessed incantation that wraps gently around our coast to keep us safe' | Daily Mail Online",
    "text": "There are warnings of gales in Viking, North Utsire, Forties, Cromarty, German Bight. The general synopsis: Low Rockall 973, moving slowly. New low expected Malin...' Some listeners will be made more alert, others soothed towards sleep. The Shipping Forecast on BBC Radio 4 is both reality and romance: a warning to seafarers, but a familiar reassurance to drowsers ashore. We are an island people, and a blessed incantation of sea-area names wraps gently, clockwise, around our coast as if to keep us safe. Alan Bennett put it perfectly, remembering old-fashioned city rituals, when he said: 'It's beating the bounds of our country.' It is the voice of scientifically refined meteorology and wide geography, hard news from cold northern seas which respect no human fear or fragility; but it comes to us filtered through ineffably polite, correct, old-fashioned BBC voices. A lone fishing trawler struggles in the stormy seas off the Mumbles Headland near Swansea The radio broadcast marks its formal centenary this year, but the Shipping Forecast actually began long before then, in 1867 (stock photo) There's nothing like it: no wonder dozens of poets, artists and composers on this battered island have reached towards it for inspiration. The radio broadcast marks its formal centenary this year, but the Shipping Forecast actually began long before then, in 1867, as a series of telegraph messages to British coastal towns, warnings to fishermen and coasters. Its founding hero is Vice-Admiral Robert FitzRoy — after whom a sea area north-west of Portugal was renamed in 2002. After devastating storms on the west coast in the 19th century, this early naval meteorologist saw the value of warnings: of tracking the movement of huge atmospheric pressure systems and sea states. FitzRoy issued shore stations and ships with instruments to collect this information, from which the movement of storms and systems can be traced. Before the 19th century was over, telegraph messages were crackling along the coasts to warn captains at sea or deter fishing fleets from leaving shore. The Shipping Forecast's founding hero is Vice-Admiral Robert FitzRoy (pictured) — after whom a sea area north-west of Portugal was renamed in 2002 We are an island people, and a blessed incantation of sea-area names wraps gently, clockwise, around our coast as if to keep us safe. Pictured, the Tenby Lifeboat launching So, as the fledgling BBC began in 1923, it was obvious that the 'The Weather Shipping' should also be part of its service, using the long-wave transmitter which reached far out to sea. Since the mid-1940s it has had its own four slots a day, on Radio 4. Sea areas were gradually defined — there are 31 of them, to be read clockwise from Viking and the Utsires off Norway, round past the East coast, Tyne and Humber, down the Channel from Thames to Plymouth, dodging south to Biscay and Trafalgar, and up the wild Irish and Scottish west coasts to the edges of Iceland. Afloat, it is about reality and danger. Over 50 years I have been going to sea, mainly on small boats, and have been in all but three of those sea areas. Before satellites, cheaper radio equipment and internet forecasts, that long-wave forecast was of central importance for small-boat sailors and fishermen. Its reach, far out from land towards Ireland or the far Northern Isles, provided a calm dispassionate voice in the bucking cabin of a 26ft boat. You adjusted the radio, possibly a standard small Roberts lashed to the chart table, and clung on with one hand to jot down wind and sea forecasts with a pencil, and note the pressures at the Coastal Weather Stations, too. In a yellow notebook there were pages with a map and the stations all marked: St Catherine's Point, Channel Lightvessel Automatic, and so forth, so you could draw lines between the numbers which matched, and get a clearish picture of the bulge of a low or high-pressure area and work out fronts which would hit you later. The Inshore Waters forecast, which joins the main one twice a day at 0048 and 0520, is even richer in romantic names for a seashore people: 'Whitby to Gibraltar Point... North Foreland to Selsey Bill... Lyme Regis to Land's End.' I was always more than aware that if some of the sea area forecasts turned out a bit fussy. Pictured, South Shields lighthouse Believe me, sailing round Britain, it is useful to know what to expect in places like 'Mull of Kintyre to Ardnamurchan Point'. These days, it is often driving home through dark, damp winter lanes at night that I hear the late forecast. Some words still send a jolt of the nerves, a sense of being glad to be in a warm car and nearly home. 'Six to eight, increasing ten later, possibly 11 — a near-hurricane. The description of the sea itself bears threat. Even those for whom 'cyclonic' or wind force numbers mean nothing can relate to the difference between 'Smooth or Slight' and 'Rough, becoming Very Rough'. And indeed to the timings: 'Imminent' always makes me wince. I have those memories of shivering apprehension at sea, yet because I worked for years within Broadcasting House, I also remember deriving extra comfort from the familiar voices, so calm and dutiful. Peter Donaldson, Brian Perkins, Charlotte Green. I was always more than aware that if some of the sea area forecasts turned out a bit fussy ('...four or five, increasing seven to nine later, then moderating three or four in west...' ) they'll have to speed up, and yet remain crystal clear. On the other hand, a series of simple lines like 'Humber, Thames, Dover, Wight, Portland, Plymouth, four or five', means they'll need to slow down. In an age of slang and slurring, their clarity is a wise and deep civility: even now, in a high-tech age, there are people listening who carry heavy responsibilities of life and death; people with decisions to make, who hope for harbour and have the sense to fear the sea. A trawler is tossed about in the very rough sea as it attempts to enter the harbour at Whitby on the Yorkshire coast Waves crash against the lighthouse in Seaham Harbour, County Durham The readers themselves carry a deep sense of responsibility. Charlotte Green said her favourite moment was the one after the midnight news; alone in a continuity cubbyhole, under one light: 'I always aimed to read clearly and distinctly at a measured pace, to enable sailors wallowing in deep angry seas to write it down. 'I allowed my imagination to roam free... an image in my mind of small, relatively frail trawlers tossed about on vast indifferent waves in the pitch black icy cold of a winter's night.' And the skipper of a sailing barge remarked more prosaically that, even in an age of online information, the broadcast version feels human. 'It gives a reassuring view that people are still doing the same thing, collating the weather, telling you all about it.' Its very simplicity is that sense of service, of a duty to be careful and get it right. The combination of that stern pragmatic reality and those marvellously evocative names has won the Shipping Forecast many fascinated fans. Celebrities have occasionally been given the honour of reading one aloud on air — John Prescott and Alan Bennett, notably — though they don't get the real, strictly timed and anxiously expected live version. That's for the professionals. Frank Muir and Denis Norden sang it in a spoof operatic version. Seamus Heaney wrote a sonnet on it, Jethro Tull sampled it on an album, and Radiohead borrowed its words. Carol Ann Duffy's haunting poem Prayer is about small moments when some deep revelation or sorrow touches the heart: distant piano scales in a strange town, the rhythm of a passing train, or at night: 'Darkness outside. Inside, the radio's prayer — Rockall. Malin. Dogger. Finisterre.' I have loved that poem for years, and some have mourned the change of Finisterre to FitzRoy, which is less poetic. But that's the beauty of the Shipping Forecast: it is only romantic because it is real. And Vice-Admiral FitzRoy deserves being remembered. Its essential Britishness was confirmed when it featured in the Olympic Games handover ceremony in 2008. The ten-minute segment, which closed the ceremony in Beijing, is remembered for Boris Johnson receiving the Olympic flag as mayor of the next host city. But a red double-decker trundled around the stadium to the strings of Jerusalem, Greensleeves and excerps from the Shipping Forecast, interwoven with three sea shanties harmonised by the chimes of Big Ben. Nothing could be more Blighty. There has been further musical inspiration, too, not least the tune that precedes it after midnight and before the closedown and national anthem on Radio 4. The description of the sea itself bears threat. Even those for whom 'cyclonic' or wind force numbers mean nothing can relate to the difference between 'Smooth or Slight' and 'Rough, becoming Very Rough'. Pictured, a trawler in the North Sea What Controller would ever dare axe Sailing By? Well, one did briefly try it, in order to save on royalties, but was soon made to recant. It's a slow waltz, and its sleepy feeling becomes part of many late night rituals. It turns up on Desert Island Discs quite regularly: Marti Caine and Michael Ball picked it, and Jarvis Cocker of Pulp remarked that it comforted him in bed at night. 'And also on a desert island, it would be happy — because it would remind you of the fact that there are boats out there listening to the Shipping Forecast, and some of them might sail nearby so you could get rescued... that could help me deal with the isolation, I think'. Yes. That's part of its odd, unexpected comfort. Like a lifeboat station or a lighthouse, the Shipping Forecast is both proof and a symbol of the idea that human beings cooperate. People look out for one other, do their duty with care. How can that not move your heart? Happy New Year to all who make the forecast and read it.",

En redes sociales, la situación ha generado división entre los campechanos. Mientras algunos usuarios defendieron el comentario como una broma ligera y sin intención de ofender, otros lo calificaron de machista, irrespetuoso y fuera de lugar, sobre todo al venir de una figura de autoridad.\n“No es la primera vez que la gobernadora recurre al humor negro o frases polémicas, pero esta vez sí se pasó”, comentó una usuaria en Facebook. Otros, en cambio, celebraron la “picardía campechana” de la mandataria, asegurando que el comentario no debe tomarse con seriedad.\nHasta el momento, no ha habido pronunciamiento oficial por parte de la gobernadora ni de su equipo de comunicación en torno a la polémica frase. Sin embargo, el tema sigue generando discusión en redes sociales locales, donde algunos incluso han compartido memes y reacciones virales sobre el tema.\nJt",
