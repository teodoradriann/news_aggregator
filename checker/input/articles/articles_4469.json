    "title": "Baden-Württemberg: Klage gegen vegetarisches Schulessen scheitert vor Gericht",
    "text": "Die betroffene Ganztagsschule im Raum Konstanz bietet an vier Wochentagen Essen an, an dreien davon vegetarische oder vegane Gerichte. Nur an einem Tag gibt es Fleisch oder Fisch. Dagegen gingen die Eltern gerichtlich vor. Sie begründeten dies mit einer drohenden Mangelernährung und einer Nahrungsmittelunverträglichkeit.\nEin Eilantrag am Verwaltungsgericht Freiburg, mit dem die Eltern erreichen wollten, dass ihrer Tochter an sämtlichen Tagen Fleisch oder Fisch zur Verfügung gestellt wird, scheiterte jedoch. Gegen die Entscheidung legten die Eltern und ihre Tochter Beschwerde ein.\nDer VGH wies die Beschwerden als unzulässig zurück. Er begründete dies im Fall der Eltern damit, dass diese ihre Beschwerde entgegen der gesetzlichen Vorgaben ohne Rechtsanwalt erhoben hatten. Am VGH besteht sogenannter Anwaltszwang.\nDie Beschwerde der Tochter war nach der Begründung des Senats ebenfalls unzulässig, weil sie im erstinstanzlichen Verfahren nicht beteiligt war und daher gar nicht befugt war für eine Beschwerde. Der Beschluss ist unanfechtbar.",

    "title": "Bernie Sanders Throws Weight Behind Nordic Workers' Unions As They Take On Elon Musk's Tesla: 'They Deserve Our Support' - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) - Benzinga",
    "text": " Tesla, Inc. TSLA , which has avoided unionization in the U.S. so far, has found that it’s a different ball game altogether across the Atlantic. Sweden’s powerful union, IF Metall, has taken Tesla head-on, clamoring for a collective bargaining agreement, and the strike has spread to other Nordic nations as well.\nThe striking employees in the region have received support from none other than Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who champions workers’ causes in the U.S.\nWhat Happened: Danish member of Parliament Pelle Dragsted last week shared a video of himself addressing Musk, who is seen saying “I disagree with the idea of unions.” In response, Dragsted said, “Hey Elon! Don’t mess with Nordic workers and our unions because you will surely lose.”\nThe parliamentarian went on to say that Nordic people love unions because they make the lives of the people better. When America became richer over the last decades, the wealth of the country remained with the billionaires, he said.\nDragsted, who is a socialist by party affiliation, said when Denmark got richer, the workers got their share. Among the benefits unionization has brought about in the country were securing a decent living wage, a workweek of 37 hours, five weeks of paid vacation, paid sick leave, and the right to one-year parental leave for every child, he said.\nCommenting on Dragsted’s post on X, formerly Twitter, Sanders said Nordic workers have the highest standard of living on earth because of their strong trade unions. “They deserve our support,” he added.\nSanders has been a pro-labor Congressman, often voicing his opinion for raising the minimum wages and joining the picket lines of striking employees.\nSee Also: Best Electric Vehicle Stocks\nWhy It’s Important: The union strike in Sweden and other Nordic countries has crippled Tesla’s operations in the region despite the workarounds it tried. Danish labor union 3F last week joined Swedish mechanics in their strike action against Tesla, as they dockworkers and lorry drivers in the country stopped unloading and transporting Tesla vehicles to Sweden.\nAfter the United Auto Workers union in the U.S. successfully negotiated a deal with Detroit’s big three in the U.S. in October, reports suggested Shawn Fain , the president of the union, has expressed intent to take the fight to Tesla’s factories.\nTesla was spending on average $45 per hour for its workers, about $20 less than what the legacy automakers were paying ahead of the implementation of the latest deal they agreed with UAW, a Business Insider report said in mid-September.\nIn premarket trading on Friday, Tesla rose 0.88% to $255.40, according to Benzinga Pro data.\nRead Next: No Threat From Traditional Autos, But Tesla Should Be Concerned About Chinese Rivals And This FAANG Giant: Munster\n ",

    "title": "Trade union history: Unions to march with sacked GCHQ workers in January, here’s why",
    "text": "Commemorating the 40-year anniversary when workers faced the sack for being in a union\nIn January, hundreds of trade unionists are expected to march at a rally in Cheltenham marking the 40th anniversary of the GCHQ trade union ban.\nOrganised jointly by the Trades Union Congress (TUC) and Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union, the march will commemorate a significant event in the movement’s struggle against a hostile, anti-union political climate – whilst drawing parallels to the current struggle for workers’ rights.\nIn 1984 Margaret Thatcher’s Tory government banned trade unions at the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), citing security concerns. Staff were forced to quit their union, however fourteen refused and, as a result, were sacked.\nThe Civil and Public Services Association (CPAS), which pre-dating the PCS union, entered a relentless campaign to reinstate them, with speakers attending more than 350 events and organising annual marches through the town centre for 13 years so the issue was kept in the public consciousness.\nEventually, once a Labour government came in, their persistence and defiance paid off when the ban was lifted in 1997 and they were able to return to work.\nThis marked an important victory in the movement, the fourteen GCHQ workers had stood up for their basic human right to collectively organise, putting their jobs on the line for their principles in a remarkable act of resistance. However today, workers are once again facing union attacks that threaten their jobs.\nThe Cheltenham rally was confirmed following a major meeting of trade unions against the Tories Minimum Service Levels (Strikes) Bill,\nthe first special congress called by the TUC in over 40 years, with the last in 1982 over Margaret Thatcher’s anti-union legislation.\nTUC general secretary Paul Nowak said the march will represent union “defiance” against historic and current attacks on workers’ rights.\n“We will once again show a Conservative government that the full force of the union movement stands behind any worker sacked for trade union activity,” rallied Nowak.\n“On Saturday 27 January, 40 years on, unions will march through Cheltenham to commemorate the GCHQ victory and to demonstrate continued defiance against minimum service level regulations and attacks on the right to strike.”\nMark Serwotka echoed his call that the message today “is the same as it was in 1984 – we shall fight this injustice for however long it takes.”\nSerwotka said: “Margaret Thatcher’s decision to ban trade unions at GCHQ was part of her attack on unions in general but these workers weren’t prepared to accept it.\n“Their principled decision not to give up their trade union membership saw them pay a massive price.\n“Now, forty years on, as we celebrate their courage and determination, a different Conservative government is attacking trade union rights – this time they’re introducing Minimum Service Levels in a naked attack on our right to strike.”\nThe rally will take place in Montpellier Gardens, Cheltenham at 12pm, 27 January. Among the confirmed speakers are Mark Serworka, Paul Nowak and UNISON new general secretary Christina McAnea, with more expected. Four of the surviving members of the original campaign and their families will also be attending as guests of honour.\n(Image credit:\nUniversity of Salford)\nHannah Davenport is news reporter at Left Foot Forward, focusing on trade unions and environmental issues\nLeft Foot Forward doesn't have the backing of billionaires or big business.

    "text": "Michigan education bills disregard students' needs, says policy group\n Chrystal Blair, Producer\nThursday, June 26, 2025\nThe Michigan League for Public Policy is warning recently passed education budget bills may appear to boost funding but ultimately fall short.\nThe League argued the legislation cuts essential K-12 services such as school meals, health centers and transportation, while also threatening higher education by reducing support for colleges and limiting access for low-income students. They contended the plan moves Michigan backward by abandoning a fair funding formula.\nAlexandra Stamm, education policy analyst for the league, said the funding shift will harm many groups of students and schools.\n\"Instead of keeping those buckets of money for rural students, transportation, English-language learners, etc., this budget really just wipes all of those categoricals and then evenly distributes it across the state,\" Stamm explained.\nThe House bills have made it through both the Appropriations Committee and the full House, and are now in the hands of the Senate Appropriations Committee for review.\nWith the federal Department of Education facing $12 billion in budget cuts, Stamm stressed the uncertainty at the national level is trickling down to the states, so local education leaders need to work hard to keep classrooms steady despite the changing tides.\n\"It is really important that we continue to invest in schools here in Michigan with an eye towards equity,\" Stamm urged. \"So that our schools can feel as though they are kind of safe and grounded from some of the uncertainty at the federal level.\"\nNationwide, 80% of schools have reduced academic programs, including art, music and physical education, due to budget constraints.\nclick here.\nget more stories like this via email\nSocial Issues\nNelsonville residents have another chance to shape their city's political map.

MAX SLOVENCIK / APA / AFP Citant «un risque accru», la police a renforcé les contrôles autour des églises, cérémonies religieuses et marchés de Noël à Vienne.\n«Intervenant sur un réseau islamiste» , les autorités autrichiennes ont arrêté quatre personnes samedi 23 décembre, a indiqué le ministère de l'Intérieur. Un porte-parole du ministère a ensuite indiqué que parmi ces quatre, trois restaient détenues dans l'attente d'investigations complémentaires.\nCitant «un risque accru» , la police a par ailleurs renforcé les contrôles, notamment autour des églises, cérémonies religieuses et marchés de Noël à Vienne. «Il n'y a pas de menace immédiate d'attaque à Vienne» , a néanmoins précisé le porte-parole de la police. Samedi, la police autrichienne avait indiqué dans un communiqué que «des agents terroristes en Europe appellent à mener des attaques contre des évènements chrétiens, spécialement autour du 24 décembre» .\nDes mesures de sécurité prises à Cologne, en Allemagne Les autorités allemandes ont en parallèle annoncé avoir renforcé les mesures de sécurité dans et autour de la cathédrale de Cologne notamment, l'une des plus visitées du pays, en raison d'un risque de sécurité lié à une menace qualifiée d' «islamiste» . Les fidèles se rendant aux services religieux de Noël doivent se soumettre à de stricts contrôles à l'entrée notamment.\n«Nous apprécions tous nos traditions de Noël et nous ne nous laissons pas intimider» , a déclaré la ministre allemande de l'Intérieur, Nancy Faeser, dimanche au groupe de presse régional Funke. «Mais nous prenons la menace terroriste islamiste très au sérieux et sommes extrêmement vigilants» , a-t-elle ajouté, «nos services de sécurité surveillent les milieux islamistes et agissent en conséquence, comme le montrent les mesures en cours» .\nDes messes de Noël à Cologne, Vienne et Madrid visées Selon le site du quotidien allemand Bild samedi, des services de sécurité en Autriche, Allemagne et Espagne ont reçu des indications selon lesquelles un groupe islamiste voudrait commettre plusieurs attentats en Europe, possiblement à la Saint-Sylvestre et à Noël. Selon le journal, les cibles de ces attentats pourraient être des messes de Noël à Cologne, Vienne et Madrid. Il affirme également qu'une personne a été interpellée en Allemagne.\nD'après Bild , les personnes arrêtées sont des Tadjiks soupçonnés d'avoir voulu perpétrer des attaques au nom de l'État islamique au Khorassan (EI-K), branche locale de l'EI en Afghanistan. Des fouilles avec des chiens renifleurs effectuées samedi soir par la police dans la cathédrale de Cologne n'ont pas abouti à la découverte d'objets suspects.\nEn juillet, une cellule d'islamistes présumés de l'EI-K avait été démantelée en Allemagne et aux Pays-Bas . Les personnes arrêtées en Allemagne étaient soupçonnées de vouloir commettre une attaque dans le pays.",

    "text": "Venezuela anuncia ejercicio militar y acusa al Reino Unido de “provocación hostil” por buque en las costas de Guyana\nmacamilarincon\n(CNN Español) –– El presidente de Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, anunció este jueves que ordenó una acción conjunta defensiva en respuesta a lo que señaló como una “provocación del Reino Unido” luego de que inicialmente la BBC reportara, citando al Ministerio de Defensa británico, que se enviaría un buque patrullero a las costas de Guyana.\n¿Cómo es la riqueza del Esequibo y cómo contribuyó al crecimiento exponencial de Guyana?\n“Por eso he ordenado la activación de una acción conjunta de toda la fuerza armada nacional militar bolivariana sobre el caribe oriental de Venezuela, sobre la fachada atlántica, una acción conjunta de carácter defensiva como respuesta a la provocación y a la amenaza del Reino Unido contra la paz y la soberanía de nuestro país”, afirmó Maduro durante la ceremonia de salutación de fin de año a la Fuerza Armada Nacional Bolivariana (FANB).\nLa reacción de Venezuela sigue a un reporte de la BBC del domingo en el que indicaba, citando al Ministerio de Defensa, que el Reino Unido se preparaba para “enviar un buque de guerra a Guyana en una muestra de apoyo diplomático y militar a la antigua colonia británica”.\n¿Qué sigue ahora en la disputa entre Venezuela y Guyana por el Esequibo? Puntos claves del acuerdo y posibles escenarios\nEl HMS Trent, un patrullero de la Marina británica, agregó la BBC, visitará Guyana, “aliado regional y socio de la Commonwealth, a finales de este mes como parte de una serie de compromisos en la región durante su despliegue de tareas de patrulla en el Atlántico”. El Ministerio de Defensa del Reino Unido confirmó a CNN en Londres esta declaración.\nMaduró calificó a la respuesta venezolana como “acción conjunta militar general Domingo Sifonte” en honor al general que Maduro considera héroe de la Guyana Esequiba y a quien, además, se le rendirá homenaje en enero “trayendo sus restos a que descanse definitivamente en el panteón de los héroes de Venezuela”.\nVenezuela y Guyana acuerdan seguir con diálogo sobre disputa del Esequibo\nLa Cancillería de Venezuela publicó un comunicado en rechazo a la llegada del buque británico y advirtió a la Comunidad del Caribe (Caricom) y a la Comunidad de Estados Latinoamericanos y Caribeños (Celac) de que las acciones contradicen el entendimiento acordado el 14 de diciembre entre Venezuela y Guyana.\n“La presencia de la nave militar es extremadamente grave, ya que viene acompañada de declaraciones por parte de voceros políticos y militares de quien fungió como despojador de la Guyana Esequiba, el cual insiste en inmiscuirse en dicha controversia”, dice el comunicado.\nEl encuentro que se llevó a cabo el 14 de diciembre entre los mandatarios de Guyana y Venezuela en San Vicente y las Granadinas cerró con el compromiso de mantener la vía diplomática como el único camino para resolver el conflicto, y se estableció el acuerdo de 11 puntos suscrito por las partes y los mediadores de ambos países.\n“Venezuela insta a las autoridades guyanesas a tomar medidas inmediatas para el retiro del buque HMS Trent, y abstenerse de seguir involucrando a potencias militares en la controversia territorial”, afirma el comunicado.\nCNN está intentando comunicarse con el Ministerio de Defensa del Reino Unido por los informes de que personal militar venezolano participará en ejercicios militares en el golfo de Paria en respuesta al despliegue del HMS Trent en Guyana.\nOsmary Hernández colaboró con este reporte.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

    "title": "Revelan que Lula da Silva ofreció un avión para sacar de Venezuela a los asilados en la embajada argentina en Caracas",
    "text": "Celso Amorim , asesor internacional de Luis Inacio Lula da Silva , reveló este jueves que se le ofreció al régimen de Nicolás Maduro un avión especial para sacar del país a los seis colaboradores de María Corina Machado, asilados en la residencia diplomática argentina en Caracas . De esta manera se iba a lograr un salvoconducto. Amorim, ex canciller de Lula, habló en el marco de una reunión de la comisión de Relaciones Exteriores del Senado de su país, especialmente convocada para que hablar de la crisis venezolana en la que Brasil debe jugar un rol central. Clarín pudo confirmar la información de altas fuentes en Brasilia, sin embargo la propuesta del gobierno del vecino país no fue aceptada por el régimen de Maduro. En Buenos Aires también señalaron en el Gobierno nacional que \"no hay nada\". En Brasilia retrucaron con que la propuesta está vigente para Maduro. Al parecer, todavía no hay consenso de la dictadura venezolana para dejar salir a los seis colaboradores de la principal líder de la oposición venezolana, que fueron asilados por el gobierno de Javier Milei cuando entraron a la residencia el 20 de marzo pasado. Al momento, es Brasil es quien cuida la residencia y la embajada argentina en Venezuela por pedido de Milei y su canciller Diana Mondino . Es quien representa los intereses de la República Argentina en Venezuela. Ocurre que Maduro echó a todo el cuerpo diplomático argentino de Caracas, empezando por el encargado de negocios Andrés Mangiarotti. Y como Milei reconoció ganador de las elecciones presidenciales al opositor Edmundo González Urrutia, las relaciones con el chavismo de Argentina están cortadas. La embajadora chavista en Buenos Aires, Stella Lugo, cerró su embajada y se marchó del país. Antes de la partida de los diplomáticos argentinos, el vicecanciller Leopoldo Sahores ofreció a su contraparte venezolana que dejara salir a los seis disidentes con los cinco diplomáticos argentinos y sus familiares que debieron volar de Caracas a Lisboa, a Madrid y luego a Buenos Aires. El régimen dijo que no y tampoco habría aceptado hasta ahora la opción que le dio Brasil. Si los seis disidentes salen a la calle serán detenidos porque sobre ellos pende una acusación sobre un presunto complot contra Maduro. Brasil sigue considerándolos asilados de Argentina y de hecho, siguen en la residencia argentina en Caracas, donde flamea la bandera verde y amarilla, pero los alimentan y están a cuidado de empleados pagados por Argentina. Las personas que pidieron refugio a la Argentina y permanecen en la residencia nacional en Caracad son: Magalí Meda, la jefa de campaña de Corina Machado; Claudia Macero, jefa de prensa de la líder opositora y Pedro Urruchurtu, a cargo de las relaciones internacionales de ese espacio político. También están en la delegación argentina Humberto Villalobos, muy estrecho colaborador de Machado y un hombre clave en el grupo; Omar González, ex diputado por Vente Venezuela y Fernando Martínez Mottola, que no responde a Machado pero es una figura importante de la oposición. Al comparecer este jueves en el Senado de Brasil, Amorim afirmó que su país defiende una solución negociada al impasse político en Venezuela, \"sin injerencias externas\". Y al igual que Lula deslizó como mejor alternativa un nuevo llamado a elecciones, que la líder opositora Corina Machado rechazó de plano en una conferencia de prensa. Para ella ganó su delfín, Edmundo González Urrutia por el 65% contra el 30% de Maduro que, en cambio, se autoproclamó ganador el mismo 28 de julio, sin mostrar las actas de la votación. \"No hice una propuesta, nunca hicimos una propuesta para que haya nuevas elecciones en Venezuela\", apuntó el ex canciller, pero planteó: \"Creo que lo curioso de las nuevas elecciones es que ambos (chavismo y oposición, NDR) podrían aceptarlo fácilmente, verdad?\"; deslizó Amorim enfatizó al exponer en el Senado que la solución a la crisis venezolana debe ser interna, sin injerencias externas. Y ese diálogo, \"aunque difícil\", hay que intentarlo, puntualizó. \"Como dijo el panel de expertos de la ONU, la transparencia es esencial para la credibilidad de cualquier proceso electoral. \"La solución debe ser construida por los propios venezolanos y no impuesta desde afuera. Lo que podemos hacer es ayudar en este diálogo\", continuó.",
