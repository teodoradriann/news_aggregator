    "text": "Thinking of sending a check to Nikki Haley as she\ncontinues her quest for the GOP presidential nomination? Well, if for some reason you foresee also wanting to donate money to Donald Trump, now or in the future, the ex-president has a characteristically unhinged message for you: Do so at your own peril!\nYes, in a post on Truth Social on Wednesday, Trump\ndeclared, “Anybody that makes a ‘Contribution’ to Birdbrain, from this moment forth, will be permanently barred from the MAGA camp. We don’t want them, and will not accept them, because we Put America First, and ALWAYS WILL!” (Trump debuted the wildly misogynistic Birdbrain nickname at a recent rally in New Hampshire.) The former president of the United States did not say how his campaign would compile such a blacklist, but perhaps it’ll have an intern comb through disclosure forms to ensure no money is being accepted from anyone who dared also chip in to support his rival. Or maybe it was just an empty threat that he has no intention of following through on! One doesn’t really know, but something we do know is that Trump is quite clearly in full-on mob boss mode, as evidenced by his apparent attempt to scare Haley out of the election with a prediction that she’d be investigated if she were to win:\nX content\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it\noriginates from.\nOpenly vowing to get revenge on rivals and critics is, of course, nothing new for the last president, and has in fact been a feature of his campaign. “I’m hard-pressed to find any candidates anywhere who are so open that they would use the power of the state to go after critics and enemies,” Steven Levitsky, a Harvard government professor and coauthor of How Democracies Die,\ntold The Guardian in November. “This is one of the most openly authoritarian campaigns I’ve ever seen. You have to go back to the far-right authoritarians in the 1930s in Europe or in 1970s Latin America to find the kind of dehumanizing and violent language that Trump is starting to consistently use.”\nAt a rally in South Carolina on Wednesday, Haley told supporters that she had raised $1 million in approximately 24 hours, much of it from small-dollar donations. “We have raised $1 million since I gave that speech last night—online, in small dollars,” she said. “We have had 200,000 donors from all 50 states. Ninety-five percent of those donations are $200 or less.” And apparently, should those people decide to show her financial support again, they’ll be barred from ever giving money to Trump.\nMore Great Stories from Vanity Fair\nPlus: The\nMost Shocking Snubs and SurprisesFrom the 2024 Oscar Noms\nNikki Haley and the\nMAGA Mountain Simone BilesTalks Marriage, WAG Life, and the Paris Olympics\nA Legendary Photographer Recounts\nStorming AmericaWith the Beatles\nThe\nWild TruthBehind a So-Called Real Gone Girl Case\nFrom the Archive:\nDoris Duke’s Final Mystery(1994)\nThe post\nDonald Trump Tells Haley Donors to Abandon Her Now or He’ll Blacklist Them appeared first on Vanity Fair.",

    "text": "For Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the activist whom President-elect Donald J. Trump will nominate to serve as the secretary of health and human services, the solution to obesity in America — now at 40 percent of adults — is straightforward: “The first line of response should be lifestyle,” he told Jim Cramer in a Dec. 12 interview on CNBC.\nElon Musk, the technology billionaire who advises the president-elect, sees things differently: “Nothing would do more to improve the health, lifespan and quality of life for Americans than making GLP inhibitors super low cost to the public,” he wrote on X, referring to the new class of drugs that cause weight loss, including Ozempic. “Nothing else is even close.”\nAnd there, with the contrasting views of two men in Mr. Trump’s ear, lie two sides of an issue that is plaguing health and nutrition researchers. Is it even possible to change lifestyles and the food environment enough to solve America’s obesity problem? And, if not, do we really want to solve it by putting millions of people on powerful drugs? What is the right balance between the two approaches?\nMany people find that eating well is easier said than done. Food companies have saturated the United States and other nations with seductively cheap and tasty things to eat, available seemingly everywhere and around the clock. Obesity researchers suspect that the current food environment has allowed many Americans to be as overweight as they possibly can be.\nBut for the first time, there is an effective countervailing force — powerful new obesity drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound that allow people to ignore the siren call of high-calorie foods and large portion sizes.\nThose with views like Mr. Kennedy’s believe it is wrong to use pharmaceuticals to manage obesity and related issues that are tied to unhealthy lifestyle and to a ruinous food environment. The makers of obesity drugs, Mr. Kennedy told Greg Gutfeld on Fox News before the election, are “counting on selling it to Americans because we’re so stupid and so addicted to drugs.”\nBut there are many like Mr. Musk, who says he has used Wegovy, applauding the power of the new drugs to improve health and treat the seeming intractability of obesity.\nMany health and nutrition researchers say they would love for obesity to be treated through lifestyle changes alone, but they are not optimistic. They point to a history of attempts to teach people to change their diet and exercise habits. Multiple studies left them with dashed hopes and tempered their enthusiasm.\nThat happened with diabetes.\nIn 1996, the National Institutes of Health initiated a study involving thousands of people at risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. Researchers led these subjects through an intensive program of diet, counseling and exercise. It worked so well that the study was ended one year early. The intervention slashed people’s chances of developing diabetes by more than half.\nThe result was so consequential that Tommy Thompson, then the secretary of health and human services under President George W. Bush, joined the study’s principal investigator, Dr. David Nathan, a Harvard diabetes researcher, to announce it in 2001, telling the nation that the study showed diabetes could be conquered.\n“Just walk around the block, walk down the street 30 minutes each and every day and we can lick this particular disease,” Mr. Thompson said at the time. He also said “Prevention works.”\nUntil it doesn’t. Diabetes incidence has actually increased since those results were announced 23 years ago.\nPermanent lifestyle changes, it turns out, are not easy.\n“The problem, of course, is that people being people apparently find it difficult to maintain such changes over long periods,” Dr. Nathan said in a recent interview.\nChristopher Gardner, a nutrition researcher at Stanford, is a true believer in the power of a healthy diet. He has done study after study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, in which health professionals guided participants in their food choices or, in some cases, even delivered meals to them.\nThe studies succeeded — participants’ health improved. But when the studies ended, Dr. Gardner said, and when participants no longer had that guidance or food delivery, many, if not most, went back to their old eating habits and all those benefits of a healthy diet vanished.\n“Yes, diet should be the answer,” said Dr. Gardner, who was paid five years ago by a purveyor of meat alternatives to study its products. But, he added, diet will be insufficient “unless some major changes are made to the whole food system in the United States.”\nThere’s also the problem of genetics, said Dr. Jeffrey Friedman, an obesity researcher at Rockefeller University in New York. Some people have a genetic tendency to become obese, and they will gain weight as long as food is cheap and plentiful. Tweaks like changing portion sizes or food advertising are not enough — if popcorn were sold in smaller bags, many would simply eat two bags of popcorn, he said.\nThat has led Dr. Friedman, like Dr. Gardner, and Dr. Nathan to conclude that the only practical way to improve people’s health and allow them to lose weight is to rely on the new obesity drugs.\nDr. Charles Burant, a professor of internal medicine at the University of Michigan, is sympathetic to Mr. Kennedy’s view that the problem is the food system.\nHe recalled an experience with one large food company that showed him how hard it could be to change what foods are marketed to Americans.\nHe had an idea for a palatable drink containing an amino acid that he thought might sate hunger.\nSo he went to the large food company and asked if it could make such a drink for him to test in a study. After a while, he received a reply: It was not in the company’s business plan to develop products that reduced appetites. It was not interested in helping.\n“It wasn’t their business to sell less food,” Dr. Burant said.\n“If you can rein in corporations or try to use pressure to modulate what they do, I think that’s great,” he added. “But in the meantime, until the population learns to eat good things, we need to do something to help people.”\nOthers, like Dr. Kevin Volpp of the University of Pennsylvania, worry about promoting the widespread use of obesity drugs. He worries about the idea of tens of millions of Americans injecting themselves weekly with drugs to curb their appetites.\n“There is not enough money in the system to suddenly fund drugs for that many people,” Dr. Volpp said.\nHe prefers to reserve the drugs for adults with the most serious diseases related to obesity.\nInstead of handing out drugs to nearly all who qualify, Dr. Volpp said the country needed to consider other solutions, like marketing restrictions and taxes on sugary beverages.\nHe also would like health insurers to help subsidize the purchase of healthy food for those who can’t afford it and have chronic medical problems, like diabetes, that are related to diet. Eleven states have secured permission to test the use of state Medicaid programs for pilot studies along those lines, he said.\n“All this is like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle,” Dr. Volpp said. “But we have to try everything that will help make our population healthier, given the rise in obesity from 12 percent to 40 percent in the past few decades.”\nIt’s not clear, though, how to put the jigsaw puzzle together, or whether to even try.\nFor Dr. Peter Lurie, the president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, the situation is dire enough to try everything all at once.\nHis organization, he said, firmly believes that the food environment is an important factor driving high obesity rates, and he wants it to change.\nHe also describes himself as “something of a pharma skeptic.”\nBut “when the pharmaceutical industry comes up with strong data that affects important outcomes,” Dr. Lurie said, “it is irresponsible to turn your back on it.”\nThat is also the view of Dr. Robert Califf, who has been serving as commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration under President Biden. Before he joined the F.D.A. in 2016, Dr. Califf, a cardiologist, ran a clinical trials center at Duke University that received funding from drug companies as well as from the federal government.\n“While I am totally in favor of helping Americans have a better diet, these drugs are highly effective” for people with obesity, Dr. Califf said. “Not just for losing weight,” but also for preventing heart disease deaths.\nIn the meantime, “we have to control the advertising,” he said, and “we have to gradually change the agricultural system,” and “we have to subsidize healthier foods.”\n“You can either be a cynical old vet and say this is impossible, or you could be optimistic,” Dr. Califf said.\nThe post A Rift in Trump World Over How to Make America Healthier appeared first on New York Times.",

    "text": "eMobility Expo World Congress 2024 closed its second edition, consolidating the Valencia Region as a hub for sustainable mobility in southern Europe. Under the slogan ‘We are the future of eMobility’, the global multi-specialist meeting point for the mobility industry brought together 6,873 international attendees over three days to discover the trends, challenges and solutions of different segments of the mobility industry and set the roadmap for more sustainable, connected, autonomous and safer mobility. An event that in its second edition has left an economic impact of 16 million euros in the city of Valencia. A total of 219 exhibiting companies such as BP, Cepsa, Ford, Iberdrola, Repsol, Air Nostrum, Broseta, Eurecat, Iryo, ITE (Instituto Tecnológico de la Energía), Redit Mobility, Valenciaport and Vueling, among many others, showcased the most disruptive innovations and solutions that are leading the sector towards a paradigm shift. The eMobility World Congress also brought together 387 experts from all over the world to analyze, debate and share the present and future challenges of the mobility industry, which include more connected, autonomous and safer mobility, and the decarbonisation of the industry. In this sense, the last day of the eMobility Expo World Congress addressed the digital transformation that is marking a new era in port management, with the application of technology and the advance of the decarbonisation of operations. Sergi Sauri, director of the Center for Innovation in Transportation (CENIT), who advocated communication between all stakeholders to promote the resilience of ports, raised several concerns in the sector. Among them, to have clearer regulations and not only to force the ports to be greener but “to go out of the ports themselves and generate green corridors, that is to say, alliances and intercontinental connections.” Another of the concerns he expressed is the relocation of some of Europe’s hubs to North Africa, “which means a reduction in tax revenues, carbon leakage and the loss of a certain logistical independence in favor of North African countries.” In this aspect, José Andrés Giménez, director of Port Logistics at the Valenciaport Foundation, also agreed. The specialist has opted for more effective integration with the existing supply chain and has considered digitisation as an “element of great importance for the synchronisation of processes” in a very fragmented ecosystem. “There is a great opportunity to make a difference in the coming years by trying to embrace these new technologies that are coming: AI, Big Data… In the transport sector we are a little behind what these technologies can bring us,” he said. Along similar lines, Arjen Heeres, CEO of DECIDE4AI, has also called for synchronisation as the answer to incorporate ports into the supply chain. “If you have an intelligent system that controls everything and prevents new situations, you don’t need more resources, you need to use the available ones in an intelligent way. Artificial intelligence helps ports to be more profitable, more sustainable, and more competitive“, he pointed out. The use of alternative fuels in aviation is an opportunity eMobility Expo World Congress also analyzed the keys to Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) as an opportunity to advance decarbonisation in air transport, although only between 2 per cent and 5 per cent of emissions come from aviation. Rosa Nordfeldt, Director of Sustainability Air Europa Airlines, said they have already started experimenting with SAF on short, medium, and long routes. However, “we must understand that SAF is only one of many measures to be implemented in the transition to decarbonisation. By 2050, all aviation will have undergone a major change. New aircraft and fuel models will emerge, there are many different energies at our disposal.” María José Bartolomé, from Exolum, remarked that “the infrastructure to move sustainable fuel already exists, but there is a lot of work to be done in terms of regulation. We need many different scenarios and technologies to achieve sustainability goals.” She agreed with Santiago Lopezbarrena, Head of sustainability at Vueling, who insisted that the regulations “are lagging behind the industry” in an aspect as important as SAF, which “is not only an opportunity for aviation, but it can also be an option for other sectors”. After pointing out that it is already possible to supply current aircraft with lower emissions, he stressed that “the supply of sustainable fuel is less than 1 per cent of global demand, so there is still a long way to go. We must increase production to be competitive in terms of price”. For his part, Francisco José Lucas, Head of sustainable aviation at Repsol, recalled his company’s commitment to this initiative with the start-up of the new SAF production plant in Cartagena (Spain), which will be able to produce more than 2,000 tons of this energy. “IATA says that current world production is similar to what we will produce in Cartagena”, where they have invested 200,000 million. “We can reduce approximately 60-65 per cent of the emissions of the entire sector, but it is necessary to make investments in infrastructures, such as production plants,” he added. About air transport, experts such as Eduardo Carrillo, director of strategy at Boeing, addressed the megatrends that are leading the sector to a new paradigm, where a strong change in propulsion technologies, an increase in urban air mobility and, finally, an inexcusable need to address climate change are detected. “In an aircraft for a few people travelling a few hundred kilometers, the hydrogen fuel cell will be a good solution, but the entire hydrogen infrastructure (production, supply, etc.) will have to be managed”, remarked Jaime Fernández, Head of Research & Technology at ITP Aero. For his part, Isaac Pérez, delegate in Spain at Airbus UpNext - a company specialising in the manufacture of aerospace and aviation components - highlighted a breakthrough for his company. “We have demonstrated that a helicopter can fly without a pilot, and we are working on several projects on disruptive propulsion energies,” he revealed.

    "text": "N.B. signs free trade pact with Ontario\nPremiers pledge to keep pushing other provinces to come up with similar agreements to reduce trade barriers within Canada\nArticle content\nNew Brunswick has signed a free trade agreement with Ontario, the biggest market in Canada with more than 16 million people, as uncertainty swells over U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs.\nPremier Susan Holt and Ontario Premier Doug Ford – dubbed Captain Canada for taking on the belligerent president – signed the memorandum of understanding on Wednesday in Toronto to reduce trade and labour mobility barriers.\nNova Scotia Premier Tim Houston took part as well, inking a separate free trade agreement between his province and Ontario.\nThe goal is to move forward as quickly as possible and remove as many barriers as possible.\nSusan Holt\nBut noticeably absent from the ceremony were the 10 other provincial and territorial premiers, all of whom have talked about the importance of showing unity in the face of Trump’s threats.\n“It’s a great day for New Brunswick because New Brunswick entrepreneurs and businesses are now going to have free and clear access to a market of millions and millions of people in Ontario,” Holt said at a news conference on Wednesday after the signing ceremony.\n“I’m excited about that. The goal is to move forward as quickly as possible and remove as many barriers as possible to trade across this country.”\nSince taking office in November, the Republican president has launched a global trade war, spooking markets and raising fears of a widespread economic recession. He has already tariffed Canadian autos, aluminum and steel, and threatened even more punishing duties.\nTrump’s repeated comments that he wants to turn Canada into his country’s 51st state has rankled Canadians and become the dominant issue in the lead up to the April 28 federal election.\nThe three leaders admitted they had work to do convincing other premiers to sign similar agreements. And it was odd to see Ford sign separate deals with New Brunswick and Nova Scotia but not the two neighbouring Maritime provinces sign agreements with each other.\nHolt said she was confident the Atlantic provinces would hammer out a deal soon, noting that even Andrew Furey, the outgoing premier of Newfoundland and Labrador, is intent on signing an agreement before his successor is picked by Liberal Party members on May 3.\nQuebec, which borders New Brunswick and is its biggest trading partner, poses one of the biggest barriers to free trade because its labour agreements protect the local workforce from others taking their jobs.\nQuebec Premier François Legault has also been slow to smooth transportation bottlenecks, finishing the twinning of the TransCanada highway that runs through his province at a pace much slower than what the Canadian Chambers of Commerce had demanded.\nThe untwinned section, from Saint-Antonin to Saint-Louis-du-Ha! Ha! near New Brunswick is supposed to be converted to a divided, four-lane highway by the end of 2026 after years of delays.\nMuch was made at the press conference about how New Brunswick and Ontario would use the same transportation rules on everything from tire pressure, to safety vests, to first aid kits. The idea is to ensure transport trucks don’t need to swap out or change parts and equipment when they move across borders, lowering costs and making trade smoother and more seamless.\nBut, Quebec, with its own set of transportation rules, must be crossed first, a journey of hundreds of kilometres.\n“I have started the conversation with Premier Legault to assess his willingness to get into this and really tackle some of the sticky labour mobility challenges that we’ve been facing between New Brunswick and Quebec for a long time,” Holt said.\n“We also hope that Quebec agrees to change their transportation rules to recognize our drivers, and our vehicles, and our tire pressure and flags the same way we are prepared to recognize theirs.”\nCanada has had free trade with the United States since 1989, when it entered into force, but interprovincial trade barriers remain.\nYou talk about tariffs, my goodness, we’ve been tariffing each other, it seems, for decades, generations.\nDoug Ford\nFord said studies show that growth domestic product would rise between four and eight per cent with freer trade within Canada, adding $200 billion of economic activity.\n“Across the country internal trade barriers increase the cost of everyday goods and services by nearly 15 per cent,” the Progressive Conservative premier said. “You talk about tariffs, my goodness, we’ve been tariffing each other, it seems, for decades, generations, actually.”\nFord said much like Trump’s tariffs, “these trade barriers hurt our economy, drive away jobs and investment, and divide us from each other. With President Trump taking direct aim at Canada’s economy, it can’t be business as usual.”\nWhile most economists suggest free trade with the United States was good overall for Canada, there was upheaval along the way, with plant closures and job losses in certain sectors, especially when Canadians failed to compete.\nHolt said she wasn’t worried that would happen to some New Brunswick businesses if they compete without barriers with Ontario.\nWith 16 million people in Ontario versus the fewer than 900,000 in New Brunswick, she argued “the balance is in our favour,” for homegrown products like Mrs. Dunster’s donuts and Petit-Sault beer.\nAnd she said the $1.7-billion New Brunswick seafood industry could fill the plates of scores of Ontarians with more lobster, crab, red fish, oysters and mussels.\n“I am not expecting that businesses will close because they can’t compete,” Holt said. “Our government has been very keen to work with New Brunswick entrepreneurs on their competitiveness, their productivity, their access to markets, their automation.\n“And so, in partnership with the federal government, we’ve been encouraging businesses to get really lean and mean, and we’ve never had more interest from businesses that really want to seize this opportunity, with the threat the tariffs have imposed, to make investments.”\nAlthough there was a lot of serious economic talk, there were moments of levity too.\nOntario is introducing legislation to ensure any other province that does not impose trade barriers to goods from Canada’s most populous province will receive the same free access for its own goods.\nFord, who’s noticeably wider than the slim and fit Houston, mentioned one of his favourite treats.\n“You can tell this guy’s in shape,” he said gesturing toward Houston. “He hasn’t eaten too many pizzas like me, but anyways, I’ll go with the frozen pizza. The frozen pizza made in Nova Scotia will be automatically recognized as very safe to buy and eat here in Ontario. And to take that one step further, if the truck driver who’s moving those frozen pizzas is trained and certified in Nova Scotia, their credentials will automatically be recognized here.”\nNew Brunswick has already begun dismantling trade barriers with other provinces. Last month, the Liberal government introduced legislative amendments, aimed at improving labour mobility and reducing interprovincial obstacles.\nAmendments to the Fair Registration Practices in Regulated Professions Act, when passed by the Liberal majority, would allow people in regulated professions to begin working immediately in their new jurisdiction during the registration process.\nAmendments to the Liquor Control Act would allow New Brunswickers to participate in the direct-to-consumer sales of alcohol and erase personal exemption limits for alcohol. Previously, the New Brunswick government had fought all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada to retain the right to confiscate alcohol and fine New Brunswickers who brought in too much booze from Quebec or other provinces.\nThe three premiers pledged to keep pushing other Canadian provinces to reduce barriers and sign similar deals.",

The flash flood also caused serious landslides on the National Road 279D and many houses along the road in the neighbouring province of Son La's Muong La District, which blocked traffic for over an hour. Local authorities arrived to clear the road and traffic resumed at 6.30 am the same day. According to the National Centre for Hydro-meteorological Forecasting, heavy rains spread in the mountainous northwestern localities from Thursday night to Friday morning, with average rainfall of over 50 mm.",
