    "text": "Ottawa: Gunshots were fired at the residence of Satish Kumar's son, the president of Lakshmi Narayan Mandir, in Surrey on Wednesday. The Surrey RCMP General Investigation Unit has conducted the investigation. The incident occurred in the early morning at the residence in the 14900 block of 80 Avenue, Surrey, as per the RCMP. According to the police, no one was injured during the incident. Constable Parmbir Kahlon, Media Relations Officer for Surrey Police, stated that the residence involved sustained damage consistent with bullet holes. In the statement released by Kahlon, he mentioned that the police remained in the area, examining the scene, speaking with witnesses, and canvassing the neighbourhood for CCTV footage. \"On December 27, 2023, at approximately 8:03 a.m., Surrey RCMP responded to a report of shots fired at a residence in the 14900 block of 80 Avenue. No one was injured during the incident, but the residence involved sustained damage consistent with bullet holes. Police remained in the area, examining the scene, speaking with witnesses, and canvassing the neighbourhood for CCTV footage. The Surrey RCMP General Investigation Unit has conducted the investigation. Officers are still working to determine the motive of this incident. Anyone with more information, including dash cam footage of the incident, is asked to contact the Surrey RCMP,\" the Surrey Police said in the statement. The officers are working to determine the motive of this incident, and the identities of the perpetrators are not known yet. The Surrey Police have not confirmed any connection of the attack to recent threats received by the Lakshmi Narayan Mandir in Surrey. In November, India-origin Canadian MP Chandra Arya shared a purported video of Pro Khalistani supporters in Surrey claiming that they wanted to create trouble at the Hindu Laxmi Narayan Mandir there. He wrote, \"Last week, Khalistan supporters verbally abused a Sikh family outside a Sikh Gurdwara in Surrey, BC, according to some reports. Now it appears the same Khalistan group wants to create trouble at the Hindu Laxmi Narayan Mandir in Surrey,\" as quoted in reports.

NOT A LOT OF LEAVES FALLING AS OF YET, BUT WE ARE CERTAINLY MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION, ESPECIALLY WITH THE COOL MORNINGS THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE. HIGH TEMPERATURES DURING THE AFTERNOON. A PLEASANT DAY CLOSE TO 70 AND THEN WARMING UP A BIT THIS WEEKEND. TEMPERATURES ARE CLIMBING TOMORROW AND THEN INTO SUNDAY BEFORE MORE COOL AIR STARTS TO PUSH IN FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK. COOL ENOUGH THIS MORNING THAT SOME COULD SEE SOME FROST. WE HAVE SEVERAL AREAS IN THE 30S THIS MORNING. MOST OF THE AREA IN THE 40S, THOUGH A COOL FRIDAY JUST LIKE THURSDAY WITH WARMER TEMPERATURES MOVING IN THIS WEEKEND WE HAVE ANOTHER BLAST OF FALL AIR BEGINNING TO MOVE IN NEXT WEEK, DROPPING HIGH TEMPERATURES FOR A FEW DAYS, 2 OR 3 DAYS CLOSER TO 60. EVEN IN THE TRIAD. THIS IS WHAT’S LEFT OF MILTON. NO LONGER A TROPICAL ENTITY, BUT STILL A FORCE. IT IS STILL MOVING VERY QUICKLY, ALMOST DUE EAST THROUGH THE ATLANTIC, AWAY FROM LAND AND INTO THE OPEN WATERS. AND SO THERE’S GOOD NEWS THERE. HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES TO MOVE OUT OF THE GREAT LAKES. AND THEN DOWN ACROSS THE MID-ATLANTIC REGION. THIS IS COLD, DRY AIR. THE CENTER OF WHICH KEEPING THOSE WINDS LIGHT, ALLOWING TEMPERATURES TO DROP TO NEAR THE FREEZING MARK OVER MUCH OF THE MID-ATLANTIC, NORTHEAST AND DOWN THE SPINE OF THE APPALACHIAN CHAIN. WE’LL WARM UP WHEN WE’RE IN THIS SECTOR AHEAD OF OUR NEXT FRONT. THAT COMES THROUGH ON MONDAY. THIS COULD BRING A FEW EXTRA CLOUDS AND THE CHANCE FOR A SHOWER, BUT CHILLY AIR STARTS TO MOVE IN BEHIND THAT KIND OF COMPLICATED SYSTEM AND DROPS OUR TEMPERATURES. THAT WILL BE THE FORCE THAT DROPS OUR TEMPERATURES NEXT WEEK. BACK TO THE FROST ADVISORY IN PLACE FOR ALL NORTH CAROLINA AND VIRGINIA MOUNTAIN COUNTIES THAT WE SERVE UNTIL 9:00 THIS MORNING. CARROLL, GRAYSON, ASHE, ALLEGHANY AND WATAUGA COUNTIES. SOME OF THOSE AREAS HAVE TEMPERATURES AS LOW AS THE MID 30S. THAT’S WHERE YOU ARE IN BOONE THIS MORNING, TWO DEGREES ABOVE FREEZING. WE’RE ALSO AT 37 IN NORTH WILKESBORO, AS WELL AS MARTINSVILLE THIS MORNING AND 39 IN ROCKINGHAM COUNTY NEAR EDEN. SO CERTAINLY WORTHY OF AN EXTRA LAYER OR TWO THIS MORNING IF IF YOU’RE GOING TO THE FAIR TODAY, FINAL WEEKEND OF THE FAIR, THEY’VE HAD A NICE STRETCH OF WEATHER THIS WEEK AND THAT’S GOING TO CONTINUE TODAY. 50S WHEN GATES OPEN AT 11:00 THIS MORNING. BUT WARMING TO NEAR 70 MID AFTERNOON. IF YOU’RE GOING TO BE THERE LATER ON THIS EVENING, WE’LL HAVE TEMPERATURES THAT WILL BE IN THE UPPER 50S FOR THAT. SO CERTAINLY A LAYERING TYPE OF DAY WARM IN THE AFTERNOON. YOU CAN PUT THOSE LAYERS AWAY. WEST WINDS AT 3 TO 5MPH. SO GENERALLY ON THE LIGHT SIDE OF THINGS NICE DAY IN THE FOOTHILLS. AFTER A CHILLY START, TEMPERATURES WILL BE NEAR 70 AS WELL WITH HIGHS IN THE MID 60S ACROSS THE MOUNTAIN WEST. NICE DAY ACROSS THE BOARD AND I KNOW A LOT OF FOLKS ARE STILL CLEANING UP. SO YOU WANT THE WEATHER TO COOPERATE. FOR FOLKS HEADED TO HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL GAMES THIS EVENING WILL BE IN THE 60S, COUPLE HOURS BEFORE KICKOFF. BUT NOTICE THE SHARP DROP IN TEMPERATURES. SO A BLANKET ON THOSE CHILLY ALUMINUM BLEACHERS MIGHT NOT BE A BAD IDEA. WE’VE GOT PRETTY CLEAR SKIES IN PLACE FOR THE WEEKEND. TOUGH TO BUY A CLOUD OUT THERE UNTIL SUNDAY. WE’LL SEE A FEW PASSING BY, BUT OTHERWISE BLUE SKIES THROUGH THE WEEKEND AND WARMER WEATHER TOO. HIGHS GETTING BACK INTO THE UPPER 70S. LOOKING AHEAD INTO OCTOBER, WE’VE GOT A STRETCH OF DRY WEATHER THAT’S LIKELY GOING TO LAST FOR ABOUT TWO WEEKS AND THEN WARMER WEATHER BEGINS TO MOVE IN TOWARD THE END OF THIS MONTH. YOU DON’T SEE IT VERY MUCH IN THE SEVEN-DAY FORECAST WIL\nAdvertisement\nWATCH: Fine fall Triad days warm up a bit this weekend\nMeteorologist Brian Slocum has your weeeknd forecast\nLots of sunny days are in the forecast for the next 2 weeks, but high temperatures will be up and down\nLots of sunny days are in the forecast for the next 2 weeks, but high temperatures will be up and down\nAdvertisement",

    "title": "81岁山东村民植树二十载，无偿捐赠价值近百万红松树_山东新闻_大众网",
    "text": "央视新闻\n在山东荣成市黄山王家村，有一片郁郁葱葱的红松树林，在这个植树节里，格外引人注目。\n红松有“北国宝树”的美誉，主要分布在东北长白山到小兴安岭一带，可生长在东北的红松，为什么在荣成市得以繁育且成林成片呢？这得从村里的一位81岁老人——宋忠华说起。\n记者找到宋忠华老人时，他正在红松林里忙活着。虽已年至耄耋，但精神矍铄，谈及与红松树的缘分，宋忠华打开了话匣子。1965年，他随母亲去吉林临江市生活，第一次看到红松，那高大挺拔的身姿一下子就印在了他的心里。\n黄山王家村村民 宋忠华：我在东北住的地方满山都是红松，我觉得这个树非常好，一个是美化环境，净化空气，保持水土，最主要的结松子能供应美食，这个松子的营养价值高得很。\n从2004年起，宋忠华回到家乡山东荣成市虎山镇黄山王家村，租赁了一片荒地，开始了漫长而艰辛的种树历程。他托朋友从吉林临江市寄来了约14万粒红松种子，满心期待着它们在家乡生根发芽。由于南北气温土壤条件差异大，红松树“水土不服”，第一年的成苗率仅有7%。面对这样的结果，宋忠华没有退缩。他买来专业书籍钻研学习，还四处向林业专家请教，终于摸索出一套自己的种植方法。\n黄山王家村村民 宋忠华：选择河沟边的地，阴坡地，因为地温低，靠河沟的地还有水，这个水很凉，我早晨和晚上用水瓢往树上浇水，浇水能降地温，树慢慢大了以后，我就用草、麦秸和花生秆盖上它，能降地温保水，适合它生长。所以现在这些树都长得非常好，阴坡栽了5年了，今年是第6年，397棵5年就死3棵，基本上100%的成活率。\n2013年，看着培育成功的红松茁壮成长，宋忠华有了新的想法，捐赠移栽红松树，让更多的红松树在家乡向上而生。\n黄山王家村村民 宋忠华：骑着摩托车基本跑遍了威海地区，荣成、乳山、文登很多地方，最远去过招远，来回532公里，12年基本上超过10万公里。\n宋忠华妻子 王秀珍：当初家里人都不支持他，都觉得他这么大年纪骑摩托车不安全，现在都支持他捐树都挺有意义的，都支持他，都拉他一把。\n多年来，他累计无偿捐赠红松树4980棵，价值近百万元。如今，81岁的宋忠华依然忙碌在红松林间。\n黄山王家村村民 宋忠华：只要能在我干得动的情况下，我继续捐下去，继续种下去，我想着在保护环境方面大家都行动起来，把这个树栽遍荣成，栽遍威海，栽遍山东，那是最理想的，我继续努力。\n责编：\n审核：付兴帅\n责编：付兴帅",

Entro mercoledì le iscrizioni al concorso fotografico\nAnche domenica 7 gennaio il presepe vivente di Piubega, nonostante la pioggia incessante che non si è interrotta per l’intera giornata, è stato visitato da migliaia di persone. La stima degli organizzatori parla di 4mila ingressi, che in questo modo fanno diventare il totale complessivo (e definitivo, visto che quella di domenica è stata l’ultima rappresentazione) oltre quota 40mila. Una bella soddisfazione per un evento che non andava in scena ormai da quattro anni, principalmente a causa dell’esplodere della pandemia da Covid 19.\nOra, tuttavia, ci sarà una coda: l’associazione Eos- Cultura & Ricerca, con il patrocinio del Comune di Piubega, ha infatti organizzato il primo concorso fotografico “Presepio Vivente di Piubega”, riservato a immagini scattate durante una delle sette giornate di rappresentazione della Natività. Il termine per l’iscrizione scade alle 23.59 di mercoledì, mentre le opere potranno essere inviate entro la stessa ora del 20 gennaio.\nLa cerimonia di premiazione avverrà in una delle prime due domeniche di marzo; le opere segnalate saranno esposte in via Marconi 13, negli ambienti di “Palazzo Pavesi”.",
