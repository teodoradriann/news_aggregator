    "title": "First US moon landing in decades to launch with NASA science, human remains on board",
    "text": "(CNN) — When a rocket makes its inaugural liftoff attempt on Monday, it will carry nothing less than the first lunar lander to launch from the United States since NASA’s final Apollo mission in 1972. The stakes are high. The success of the rocket, developed by the joint venture of Lockheed Martin and Boeing called United Launch Alliance, is crucial to that company’s future and its desire to chip away at SpaceX’s dominance in the commercial launch industry. The lunar lander, built by small Pittsburgh-based company Astrobotic Technology, could become the first commercially developed spacecraft to make a soft landing on the moon. NASA has sponsored the development of a small fleet of such privately developed lunar landers — aiming to use them to give the US a presence on the moon amid a new international space race that began heating up in 2023. And while the NASA program does not hinge on a single lander making a successful touchdown, this first robotic mission could set the tone and pace for the space agency’s renewed efforts to explore the moon robotically before it tries to return astronauts to the lunar surface later this decade. Astrobotic’s robotic lunar lander, Peregrine, is scheduled to launch aboard the ULA Vulcan Centaur rocket from Florida’s Cape Canaveral Space Force Station at 2:18 a.m. ET Monday. Recent forecasts showed about an 85% chance the weather will be clear for takeoff. Backup launch opportunities are also available over the next few days. The path ahead Experts across the space industry, including Astrobotic CEO John Thornton, have likened the odds of successfully landing any spacecraft on the moon to flipping a coin. “This really is like a 50-50 shots on goal kind of an approach — where it’s really more about the industry succeeding, not any specific one mission,” Thornton told CNN in a January 2 phone interview. That said, Thornton added, “we’ve put everything that we can into this mission.” Landing on the moon is a complex endeavor. If the launch takes off as scheduled Monday, Vulcan Centaur will propel the lunar lander en route to the moon — placing it into what’s called a trans-lunar injection orbit. That involves a precisely timed engine burn that will push the Peregrine lander onto a path in Earth’ orbit that will allow it to sync up with the moon some 384,400 kilometers (238,855 miles) away. From there, beginning about an hour after launch, the Peregrine lander will separate from the rocket and forge its own path, using onboard thrusters to place itself on a precise course toward the moon. After reaching the moon, Peregrine — named for the falcon that is the fastest-flying bird in the world — will spend some time in lunar orbit before attempting a touchdown on February 23. The target landing site is a patch of the moon’s near-side surface that stretches a few kilometers wide, Thornton said, but the lander will test technology that could provide a more precise landing zone on future missions. The final moments before the spacecraft reaches the lunar surface will be the most crucial. Two failed lunar landing attempts last year, one by a Japan-based company and another by Russia, foreshadowed the difficulty of maintaining precise control over a vehicle as it swoops in for a touchdown, with both efforts crashing into the moon. A new space race This mission will mark the first lunar landing attempt — robotic or crewed — for the US in five decades. And the mission comes amid a renewed international push to explore the moon. While both the [Japan-based company Ispace](https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/26/world/hakuto-r-ispace-lunar-lander-results-scn/index.html) and [Russia’s Roscosmos space agency](https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/20/world/luna-25-spacecraft-moon-collision-intl/index.html) failed in their lunar landing attempts last year, India’s Chandrayaan-3 [made a safe landing in August](https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/23/world/chandrayaan-3-lunar-landing-attempt-scn/index.html). With that success, India became the fourth nation — after China, the former Soviet Union and the United States — to put a vehicle on the moon. So far in the 21st century, only India and China have made soft landings. The Japan Exploration Aerospace Agency, or JAXA, could complete its first lunar landing this month, using its “Moon Sniper” spacecraft that’s already [been en route](https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/26/world/japan-lunar-lander-moon-orbit-scn/index.html) for months. But NASA is hoping to swiftly catch up using the commercially developed robotic landers it has sponsored. Apart from Peregrine, the space agency has contracts with Texas-based companies Firefly Aerospace and Intuitive Machines. The latter could launch its lunar lander as soon as mid-February. Those contracts, all part of NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services program, aim to drastically drive down the cost of building a lunar lander — especially in comparison to the multibillion-dollar effort that it took to create the Apollo-era lander. Peregrine and the other CLPS landers are designed to be far cheaper, with NASA agreeing to pay its partner companies only a single fix-priced contract. (Astrobotic’s contract for this mission, for example, totaled $108 million, which was more than NASA initially promised. But agency officials said the contract was renegotiated amid the pandemic.) “This is one of many relatively cheap missions that are going to be sent to the surface of the moon to try to break the paradigm to try to get to a new price point,” Thornton told CNN. Other robotic moon missions for CLPS could take off later in 2024, including a golf cart-size rover aboard a different lunar lander for Astrobotic called Griffin. This rover will peruse the lunar south pole for water ice — a search that’s a key feature of the 21st-century space race. Water ice could be used for sustaining colonies of future astronauts or converted into rocket fuel for missions deeper into space. A cornerstone of NASA’s lunar efforts will be to pave the way for humans to return to the surface under the Artemis program. NASA aims to send astronauts on a mission to fly by the moon as soon as late 2024 before returning humans to the surface later this decade. Peregrine’s science For this mission, Astrobotic’s Peregrine lander is heading for a lunar region called Sinus Viscositatis, otherwise known as the “Bay of Stickiness.” The name is an homage to the nearby Gruithuisen Domes, a unique lunar feature that scientists suspect was formed by sticky magma. The Peregrine lander will carry 10 science payloads, five of which are NASA-sponsored experiments. They include two instruments that will monitor the radiation environment, “helping us better prepare to send crewed missions back to the moon,” said Paul Niles, NASA’s project scientist for the Commercial Lunar Payload Services program, during a Thursday press briefing. Other instruments sent by the space agency will analyze the makeup of the lunar soil, looking for water and hydroxyl [molecules](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/images/pia12221-daytime-water-cycle-on-the-moon). NASA will also study the moon’s super-thin atmosphere. Thornton said the Peregrine vehicle will operate for about 10 days on the moon’s surface until the region is plunged into lunar night, a period when it will be too cold for instruments to operate. Human remains and mementos While NASA is the primary financial backer of the mission, the space agency is just one customer involved. Also on board Peregrine will be science experiments and commercial cargo from other nations, including Germany, Mexico and the United Kingdom. Astrobotic partnered with German shipping company DHL, for example, to take small mementos to space, including “photographs and novels to student work and a piece of Mount Everest.” Notably, Peregrine will also carry human remains on behalf of two commercial space burial companies — Elysium Space and Celestis — a move that’s sparked opposition from Navajo Nation, the largest group of Native Americans in the United States. The group contends that allowing the remains to touch down on the lunar surface would be an affront to many Indigenous cultures, which regard the moon as sacred. Celestis offered to carry ashes to the moon for prices starting at around $13,000, according to its [website](https://www.celestis.com/experiences-pricing/). Thornton, the Astrobotic CEO, told CNN that the landing attempt will be a surreal moment — the culmination of 16 years of work by the company’s employees. The most difficult hurdle to overcome during Astrobotic’s journey, he noted, was convincing people that a Pittsburgh-based company of fewer than 300 people was capable of creating a lunar lander at all. “We got loads of people that doubted us and laughed at us along the way,” he said. But Thornton is hopeful that success will lead to a burgeoning lunar economy, helping NASA achieve its goals while also inspiring the commercial sector to pursue possibilities on the moon.

    "title": "Burundi: President calls for 'stoning' homosexuals - The Limited Times",
    "text": "Same-sex marriage is an \" abominable practice \", gay couples are to be \" stoned \" because they have \" chosen the devil \" and attract the divine \" curse \": Burundian President Évariste Ndayishimiye on Friday (December 29th) delivered a virulent diatribe against homosexuality.\nThe head of state of this conservative Christian African country, where same-sex relations are punishable by up to two years in prison, was speaking at a public conference in the eastern province of Cankuzo broadcast on radio and television, answering questions from the press and the population.\n«\nYou asked me a question about this abominable practice of one man marrying another man and a woman marrying another woman ,\" he said, before referring to the Bible. \" I'm telling you the truth, if you want to bring the curse on a country, you have to let people of the same sex get married. Remember what happened to Sodom and Gomorrah? God then came to say, 'I regret having created man,' \" he added.\n«\nPersonally, I think that if we see this kind of people in Burundi, we should put them in a stadium and stone them. And it wouldn't be a sin for those who do,\" said Ndayishimiye, who earlier this year called for homosexuals to be \" banned \" and \" treated as pariahs .\"\n\"Don't let them come back!\" He also lashed out at Western countries, which routinely display their opposition to violations of the rights of the LGBTQ+ community. In Uganda, another East African country, a law passed by parliament in May harshly punishing homosexual practices and the \" promotion of homosexuality \" drew strong Western condemnation and sanctions from the United States.\n«\nYou said that Western countries are trying to force small countries to adopt this practice, and that they will not receive any help if they do not comply. Let them keep their help, let them keep it!\" he said.\n«\nWhoever has chosen the devil, let him go and live in these lands. Moreover, I believe that those who go into exile in these countries go there to adopt these practices (...) Don't let them come back!\" he also said. Burundi's penal code punishes same-sex relations, punishable by fines and penalties ranging from three months to two years in prison.\nIn March, 24 people were charged with \"homosexual practices or incitement to homosexual practices \" and imprisoned. Seven of them were sentenced, five to two years in prison and two others to one year in prison.\nIn East Africa, as in many countries on the continent, LGBTQ+ people face stigma and discrimination in conservative societies, whether predominantly Christian or Muslim, where homosexuality is taboo.",

    "text": "In 2023, BMW pushed past Mercedes-Benz – at least where cars and SUVs are concerned – while Lexus and Volvo had record years and Tesla outsold them all.\nHere, we look at the luxury brands on sale in Australia and how they performed in 2023. Note, VFACTS figures are based on customers taking delivery of a vehicle, not simply ordering one.\nWe’ve omitted ultra-luxury brands like Bentley and Rolls-Royce for brevity, but we’ve included Tesla for context – even if it’s arguably not a luxury brand.\nFor more Motoring related news and videos check out\nMotoring >>\nTesla: 46,116 sales\nYou may argue Tesla doesn’t belong here, given its\nModel 3 and Model Y have base prices that undercut not only rivals from luxury brands but even those from mass-market brands. Nevertheless, we’ve included it for context.\nTesla sales were up 135.4 per cent over 2022 despite having only two models: the Model Y, Australia’s best-selling electric vehicle (EV) in 2023; and the Model 3.\nSales of the Model 3 were up 59.5 per cent year over year, but the Model Y was up by a whopping 230 per cent.\nNot only did Tesla outsell every other brand on this list, it was Australia’s eighth best-selling brand overall, overtaking the likes of Subaru, Volkswagen and Nissan.\nBMW: 26,184 sales\nBMW beat out Mercedes-Benz, but with an asterisk attached.\nThe three-pointed star brand still sold more vehicles overall if you lump in sales from both its passenger car and commercial vehicle divisions.\nStrip away Vito cargo vans and the like, however, and the Bavarian brand edged past.\nSales were up 15.4 per cent, with its best-selling vehicles being the\nX1 (4644 sales, up 91.5 per cent), X3 (4002 sales, down 12 per cent), X5 (3682 sales, up 18.4 per cent) and 3 Series (3147 sales, up 11.7 per cent).\nLike the related X3,\nX4 sales declined (775 sales, down 13 per cent) while some of BMW’s sportier models didn’t do as well like the 4 Series (858 sales, down 14.3 per cent) and 4 Series Gran Coupe (805 sales, down 6.2 per cent).\nThe latter two’s electric sibling, however, had a good year. BMW sold 353\ni4s, up 70.5 per cent.\nMercedes-Benz: 24,315 sales\nMercedes-Benz sold 24,315 vehicles, while Mercedes-Benz Vans sold 4538 vehicles.\nThe Vans division includes not only load-haulers like the\nVito, but also plush people movers like the V-Class, but the bulk of its sales was of the Sprinter van (3113 units, up 15.9 per cent).\nMercedes-Benz Cars was down 9.3 per cent year over year, with double-digit declines for several key models.\nThe\nGLC was its best-seller with 3631 sales, down 16 per cent, though the related GLC Coupe managed to grow sales by 17.5 per cent to 1799 units.\nThe\nC-Class sat in second with 2625 sales, down 26.4 per cent, followed by the GLE (2535 sales, down 18 per cent). Again, the coupe SUV version of the GLE posted an increase (809 sales, up 3.6 per cent).\nMercedes-Benz’s most affordable model, the\nA-Class, was also down. The brand sold 2392 examples, a decrease of 15.8 per cent.\nThere were few bright spots.\nEQB sales were up massively (783 sales, an increase of 455.3 per cent), while the outgoing E-Class posted an increase in its twilight months (421 sales, up 21.3 per cent).\nAudi: 19,039 sales\nAudi sales were up 29.2 per cent year over year, despite a drop in sales for its top seller, the\nQ3. Audi shifted 4457 examples, a decrease of 11.7 per cent that saw it fall further behind its Volvo XC40 rival.\nBut apart from drops for the fairly low-volume\nA6 and A7, it was otherwise a rosy picture at Audi.\nThe\nQ5 was its second-best seller (4210 sales, up 31.2 per cent), followed by the A3 (3319 sales, up 57.3 per cent) which came remarkably close to matching the Volkswagen Golf in sales – there was a difference of just 273 units.\nIntriguingly, some Audi models saw spikes in popularity despite being at the end of their lifecycles. These include the\nA4 (863 sales, up 61.3 per cent), A5 (178 sales, up 17.1 per cent) and A5 Sportback (572 sales, up 47.8 per cent).\nLexus: 15,192 sales\nLexus is kicking goals, with sales up 114.3 per cent. That’s a new record for the brand, eclipsing its previous best of 9612 sales in 2019.\nThis was fuelled by stronger supply, with wait times slashed for key models. That includes the NX 350h, which went from wait times of beyond 24 months to just 4-6 months.\n60.4 per cent of all Lexus sales in 2023 were of hybrid, plug-in hybrid or electric models, the first year these powertrains have accounted for the majority of sales.\nLexus sold a total of 8377 hybrid vehicles, plus 415 plug-in hybrids and just 378 EVs.\nThe\nNX overtook the Audi Q5 to become the second best-selling vehicle in the Medium SUV over $60,000 segment, behind only the dominant Tesla Model Y. Lexus sold 6875 examples, 3417 of which were hybrid or plug-in hybrid variants.\nThe\nRX was the brand’s second-best seller, with 2743 units, an increase of 102.9 per cent. It was followed by the UX (2468 sales, up 110.8 per cent) and ES (1727 sales, up 107.8 per cent and an all-time record for that nameplate).\nExcluding discontinued vehicles, only the flagship\nLS sedan was down with just 20 examples sold compared with 21 in 2022.\nVolvo: 11,128 sales\nVolvo is another brand that set a sales record, with sales up 3.9 per cent compared with its record-setting 2022 performance.\nA total of 3949 of these sales were of electric models, accounting for 35 per cent of its total volume. The brand plans to go electric-only in Australia from 2026 ahead of a global switch to an EV-only line-up in 2030.\nThe\nXC40 was Volvo’s best seller and the best-selling vehicle in its segment with 5837 sales, up 14 per cent.\nIt was followed by the\nXC60 (2542 sales, down 26.6 per cent), XC90 (1299 sales, up 3.3 per cent) and C40 (1103 sales, up 124.6 per cent).\nVolvo’s cars continue to be its worst sellers. Volvo sold just 152 examples of its\nS60 sedan (down 31.5 per cent), though V60 Cross Country wagon sales ticked up slightly (195 sales, up 21.9 per cent).\nLand Rover: 8425 sales\nLand Rover sales increased by 93.8 per cent, buoyed by a stronger performance from its top-selling\nDefender and Range Rover Sport.\nThe Defender was up 137 per cent to 3846 sales, while the Range Rover Sport was up 144.9 per cent to 2224 sales.\nLand Rover has been prioritising its more expensive models, and this is reflected in the sales figures. The flagship\nRange Rover was up 436.1 per cent to 713 sales, while even the oft-overlooked Discovery had a huge increase of 319.7 per cent to 533 sales.\nBut the company’s entry-level models were down. Land Rover sold just 176\nDiscovery Sports, down 67.9 per cent, and 419 Range Rover Evoques, down 39.2 per cent.\nPorsche: 6052 sales\nPorsche sales were up 7.9 per cent, with the\nMacan remaining by far its best seller.\nThe German brand sold 2925 examples of the crossover, an increase of 6.9 per cent. It’s set to be replaced by an electric model in 2024.\nTwo other Porsches set to be replaced by electric models, the\nBoxster and Cayman, also posted increases. Porsche sold 136 Boxsters, up 44.7 per cent, and 282 Caymans, up 77.4 per cent.\nThe more expensive\n911 outsold them both (558 sales, up 2 per cent), while the Cayenne Coupe (847 sales, up 17.2 per cent) overtook the Cayenne (699 sales, down 18.5 per cent).\nPorsche currently has only one EV in the\nTaycan, and it also posted an increase. Sales were up 24.4 per cent year over year to 535 units.\nGenesis: 1916 sales\nKorea’s only luxury brand saw an 84.4 per cent increase in sales, continuing an upward trajectory for the brand that arrived here in 2019. It nearly outsold Alfa Romeo, Maserati and Jaguar combined.\nThe\nGV70 was its best seller with 1190 units, up 138.8 per cent. It was followed by the GV80 (403 sales, up 60.6 per cent) and electric-only GV60 (191 sales, up 67.5 per cent).\nGenesis’ passenger car line-up was down. It sold just 81\nG70 sedans and wagons (down 13.8 per cent) and 51 G80 sedans (down 37 per cent).\nAlfa Romeo: 716 sales\nThe new\nTonale helped increase Alfa Romeo’s sales by 25.4 per cent year over year, with 365 examples of the new small crossover being delivered.\nIt outsold both the\nGiulia (184 sales, down 35.9 per cent) and Stelvio (167 sales, down 41 per cent) combined.\nMaserati: 638 sales\nMaserati sales were up 7.4 per cent, and like its fellow Stellantis brand Alfa Romeo this was fuelled by a new, more affordable entry point to the range.\nThe\nGrecale accounted for 494 of the brand’s sales, which saw it outsell the rest of the line-up combined. Once the favourite children, the Levante SUV and Ghibli sedan were down considerably – the Levante by 79.1 per cent to 91 units, the Ghibli by 75.2 per cent to just 29 units.\nMaserati sold just 3\nQuattroporte sedans, compared with 10 in 2022. That made it the least popular vehicle in its segment.\nJaguar: 581 sales\nJaguar sales were down as the brand waits out the clock on the entire current line-up ahead of a repositioning mid-decade as a more exclusive marque with a new, smaller line-up.\nIts entry-level\nE-Pace was down 71.3 per cent to just 75 units, making it the worst-selling vehicle in its segment.\nThe results were rosier for other Jaguars. The\nF-Pace was up 13.9 per cent to 360 units, while all bar the XF and aforementioned E-Pace saw increases.\nThe sharpest was the 52.2 per cent improvement in\nI-Pace sales, if from a low base – Jaguar still sold only 35 of the slinky electric crossover. The F-Type also enjoyed a late-life bump of 46.9 per cent, with 47 of the brand’s last petrol-powered sports car sold.\nMORE:\nVFACTS 2023: All-time Australian sales record, Ford Ranger tops charts",

Temperatures will climb to the mid to upper 90s with heat index values up to 108 possible. A cold front moving into the region will trigger scattered to numerous showers and storms this afternoon. A few could be strong to severe with damaging wind and localized flooding the biggest concerns. The cold front will stall just to our east Saturday meaning more storms likely beginning in the mountains and shifting east through the afternoon. The severe threat will increase through the day as storms organize into lines and clusters increasing the threat of damaging wind and heavy downpours. Temps won’t be quite as hot, but humidity will remain high with feels like temps in the triple digits ahead of any rain. Rain chances remain Sunday as the front remains near the area. Next week’s forecast will depend on the track of Invest 97-L, the tropical wave over Hispaniola. It will likely become a tropical depression this weekend near Florida or in the Gulf. Models are in better agreement on where this storm will be this weekend, but there is still a lot of wiggle room in its potential intensity and track. It could stall bringing flooding rain to Florida and the Gulf coast. However, if it tracks back into the southeast and along the coast it could bring some issues to the Carolinas later in the week. Right now, keeping the forecast seasonable with highs in the low 90s with isolated afternoon storm chances. But, we’ll need to monitor this situation very closely over the next few days.",

    "text": "2024-01-06 02:42:34 They demand that the health authorities include it in the health system’s portfolio of services. In Spain, more than 30,000 new cases of lung cancer occur every year. Furthermore, it is the tumor with the highest mortality rate, with an overall survival at the time of diagnosis of 21% at five years, given that more than 70% of cases are diagnosed in advanced stages. When detected early, more than 80% of patients survive five years. The lack of systematic population screening in high-risk patients is one of the main barriers to early diagnosis in Spain. Consequently, various organizations are calling for biomarker screening to be included in the health system’s portfolio of services. This is what the experts from the Lung Ambition Alliance (LAA) expressed in their last meeting. The LAA, made up of entities from more than 50 countries, aims to double the survival of lung patients by 2025. Last year, the European Commission recommended that member countries implement lung cancer screening. Since then, it has substantial support from scientific evidence to be incorporated into the service portfolio of health systems. Various studies indicate that lung cancer screening could reduce overall mortality by between 6.7% and 20%, and specific mortality from this type of cancer by between 18% and 39%. Furthermore, the feasibility and profitability of its implementation has been verified, ensuring that the benefits obtained outweigh the risks and justify the costs. LAA members maintain that equitable access to treatments and diagnostic tests is a fundamental right. “The health system must provide adequate care, diagnosis and treatment, guaranteeing at all times the equity, safety, effectiveness and quality of health services throughout the territory,” says Marta Moreno, director of Corporate Affairs and Access to the AstraZeneca Spain Market. In some communities, progress is being made in the implementation of effective screening protocols that contribute to saving lives, and in some of them, prevention plans are already being implemented. Laureano Molins, national coordinator of the LAA and consultant of the Thoracic Surgery Service of the Hospital Clínic of Barcelona, underlines the need to continue studying its implementation in all communities.

Experts have also formulated specific recommendations for monitoring the oncological process in lung cancer. They have established a set of variables to collect, as well as indicators that allow monitoring the care process, contributing to improving the quality of care and ensuring the interoperability of information at the national level.
