    "text": "Florida priest accused of biting woman during dispute over Communion bread By Rebekah Riess, CNN (CNN) — A Florida priest is accused of biting a woman while giving out Communion during a Mass in St. Cloud in an alleged “attempt to defend the Communion bread,” according to the charging affidavit in the case. The priest, identified as Father Fidel Rodriguez, initially refused to give the woman Communion bread on May 19 and told her “she did not do the prior steps necessary” to receive the bread when he encountered her at a Mass held earlier that day at St. Thomas Aquinas Catholic Church, according to police. A statement provided by the Diocese of Orlando states Rodriguez gave the woman a blessing at the 10 a.m. Mass and “advised her to receive the Sacrament of Penance (Confession) before coming back to receive Holy Communion (Eucharist).” The woman told police she returned to the church for the noon Mass and informed the priest she had in fact done the necessary steps and “is now accepted by God, thus, granting her the ability to participate in communion,” the affidavit states. The priest asked the woman if she “had been to the Sacrament of Penance (Confession), to which she stated it was not his business,” according to the statement from the Diocese. The woman told police Rodriguez allegedly “became upset and tried to ram the ‘cookie’ in her mouth,” according to the affidavit. She said she then attempted to grab another Communion bread, which the priest was holding, when he grabbed and bit her arm, the affidavit states. “Father Rodriguez offered the woman Holy Communion on the tongue. At that point, the woman forcefully placed her hand in the vessel and grabbed some sacred Communion hosts, crushing them,” according to the Diocese’s statement on the incident. “Having only one hand free, Father Rodriguez struggled to restrain the woman as she refused to let go of the hosts. When the woman pushed him and reacting to a perceived act of aggression, Father Rodriguez bit her hand so she would let go of the hosts she grabbed,” the statement continued. The woman was asked to leave, according to the Diocese, which added the priest had not met her before. When interviewed by police, the priest told the investigating officer the woman had pushed him and “would not let go of the communion tray and the only way he thought to extract her from it was to bite her arm,” according to the affidavit. “In the Catholic Tradition, the Eucharist is considered ‘the source and summit’ of worship and faith. The act of participation in Holy Communion therefore calls for a proper understanding, reverence, and devotion,” the statement from the Diocese reads. “It is not something a person can arbitrarily demand and is certainly not a mere ‘cookie’ as the complainant called it,” the statement adds. The woman refused medical attention and police photographed the bite mark, according to the affidavit. St. Cloud Police have forwarded the affidavit summary of events to the State Attorney’s Office for review. The Ninth Judicial Circuit State Attorney’s Office told CNN in a statement on Friday, “We have received the case and it is currently under review to determine the appropriate course of action.” The-CNN-Wire ™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Request a sample and discover the recent advances in the antibody-drug conjugates in oncology market @ Antibody-drug Conjugates in Oncology Competitive Landscape Report\nAntibody-drug Conjugates in Oncology Overview\nAntibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) represent a cutting-edge approach in oncology, combining the targeting ability of monoclonal antibodies with the potent cytotoxicity of small-molecule drugs. These therapeutic agents consist of three main components: a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to a tumor-associated antigen, a cytotoxic payload (often a chemotherapeutic agent), and a linker that connects the two. The antibody component of the ADC ensures that the cytotoxic drug is delivered primarily to cancer cells, minimizing damage to normal, healthy cells. This targeted delivery mechanism aims to enhance the therapeutic window by allowing the use of highly potent drugs that would otherwise be too toxic if administered systemically.\nIn oncology, ADCs are being used to treat a variety of cancers, including breast cancer, lymphoma, and urothelial cancer. The efficacy of ADCs depends not only on the specificity of the antibody but also on the stability of the linker, which must ensure that the cytotoxic agent is released only when the ADC is internalized by the cancer cell. Once inside the cell, the cytotoxic drug is released and induces cell death by disrupting vital cellular processes, such as DNA replication or microtubule function. This precision targeting helps reduce the common side effects associated with conventional chemotherapy, such as nausea, hair loss, and bone marrow suppression, while also improving patient outcomes.\nSeveral ADCs have been approved by regulatory agencies, including Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) for HER2-positive breast cancer and Brentuximab vedotin for Hodgkin lymphoma and anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Ongoing research is focused on improving the safety, efficacy, and resistance profiles of ADCs by developing more stable linkers, more potent cytotoxic agents, and antibodies that target novel cancer-specific antigens. ADCs are becoming a crucial component of personalized cancer treatment, offering a highly targeted approach that promises better efficacy with fewer side effects.\nAntibody-drug Conjugates in Oncology Pipeline Analysis: Drug Profile\nTRODELVY: Gilead Sciences\nTRODELVY (sacituzumab govitecan-hziy) is an innovative TROP-2-targeted antibody-drug conjugate. TROP-2, a cell surface antigen, is predominantly expressed in various tumor types, including over 90% of breast and bladder cancers. Trodelvy features a proprietary hydrolyzable linker connected to SN-38, which is a topoisomerase I inhibitor payload. This unique formulation provides significant efficacy against both TROP-2-expressing cells and their surrounding microenvironment. Approved in more than 40 countries, with additional regulatory reviews in progress globally, TRODELVY is indicated for adult patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer who have previously undergone two or more systemic therapies, including at least one for metastatic disease. In the U.S., TRODELVY is also approved for certain patients with pre-treated HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer and has received accelerated approval for specific patients with second-line metastatic urothelial cancer.\nPADCEV: Astellas Pharma\nPADCEV (enfortumab vedotin-ejfv) is an antibody-drug conjugate designed for treating advanced bladder cancer and other urothelial cancers. It has received approval for use alongside pembrolizumab in adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer. PADCEV operates by targeting cancer cells that express a protein known as Nectin-4, delivering a chemotherapy agent directly to these cells. The antibody component of PADCEV binds to Nectin-4 on the surface of cancer cells, facilitating the entry of the chemotherapy drug, which then leads to the cell's destruction.\nFind out more about FDA antibody-drug conjugates @ Antibody-drug Conjugates Analysis\nAntibody-drug Conjugates in Oncology Market Dynamics\nAntibody-drug conjugates have emerged as a transformative approach in oncology, combining the specificity of monoclonal antibodies with the cytotoxic potency of chemotherapeutic agents. The market dynamics surrounding ADCs are shaped by several interrelated factors, including technological advancements, regulatory environments, competitive landscapes, and shifting treatment paradigms . These factors collectively influence the growth trajectory, accessibility, and clinical adoption of ADCs in cancer treatment.\nTechnological innovation is a primary driver of the ADC market. Companies are increasingly focusing on improving linker technologies and drug payloads to enhance the efficacy and safety profiles of these therapeutics. Advances in biotechnology have allowed for more precise targeting of cancer cells while minimizing damage to healthy tissue. For instance, the development of new payloads that are more potent or have novel mechanisms of action can significantly improve therapeutic outcomes, thus attracting interest from both researchers and investors.\nRegulatory pathways also play a crucial role in shaping the ADC market dynamics. The expedited approval processes for innovative therapies, such as the FDA's Breakthrough Therapy designation , encourage the development of ADCs by reducing the time and resources required to bring these products to market. Regulatory agencies are increasingly recognizing the potential of ADCs to fill unmet medical needs, particularly in treating difficult-to-target malignancies. This favorable regulatory landscape fosters a competitive environment where pharmaceutical companies are incentivized to invest in ADC development.\nThe competitive landscape is characterized by both established pharmaceutical giants and emerging biotech firms. Major players are expanding their portfolios through collaborations, acquisitions, and partnerships to enhance their ADC offerings. This competitive pressure is driving innovation, resulting in a growing number of ADCs entering clinical trials and subsequent commercialization. Additionally, as clinical data supporting the efficacy of ADCs accumulates , more oncologists are likely to adopt these therapies, further propelling market growth.\nLastly, changing treatment paradigms and increasing demand for personalized medicine are shaping the ADC landscape. As more targeted therapies become available, oncologists are seeking options that provide effective treatment while minimizing toxicity. ADCs are particularly appealing in this context, as they can be tailored to target specific cancer markers.

    "text": "Ryan Reynolds, Rob McElhenney e Eva Longoria compram clube de futebol da Colômbia\nFundado em 1982, o clube fica na cidade de Bogotá e pertencia à empresa Equidad Seguros\nLance|Do R7\nAs estrelas de Hollywood Ryan Reynolds, Rob McElhenney e Eva Longoria compraram 99% do La Equidad, time de futebol da Colômbia. Liderados pelo consórcio Tylis-Porter, o trio desembolsou cerca de 30 milhões de dólares (cerca de R$ 180 milhões na cotação atual) pelo clube.\nO consórcio é comandado por Al Tylis, investidor imobiliário, e por Sam Porter, executivo mexicano. Até então, o Club Deportivo La Equidad pertencia à empresa Equidad Seguros.\nO La Equidad é um pequeno clube da cidade de Bogotá, capital colombiana, fundado em 1982. O time disputou a elite do futebol colombiano pela primeira vez em 2007 e nunca foi campeão nacional.\nEste não é o primeiro time de futebol que Reynolds e McElhenney adquirem juntos. Os dois compraram 100% do Wrexham, do País de Gales, durante a temporada 2020/21 por R$ 15 milhões.\nO futebol tem chamado a atenção de cantores e atores nos últimos tempos. No final de outubro de 2024, por exemplo, circulou a informação de que o rapper norte-americano ASAP Rocky, pai dos filhos da cantora Rihanna, estaria interessado em comprar o Tranmere Rovers, clube da League Two - quarta divisão - da Inglaterra. O artista teria o apoio de investidores para adquirir 80% da equipe inglesa por cerca de 15 milhões de libras.",

    "text": "Family Promise receives $1M Bezos grant to help Wake County's homeless families find permanent homes Family Promise of the Triangle, a Wake County organization serving families experiencing homelessness for 30 years, received a much-needed $1 million grant from the Bezos Day 1 Fund. The organization does not just offer families a temporary roof over their heads – they provide apartments, creating a semblance of normalcy and a path toward a brighter future. Lisa Owens and her six-year-old son moved into her apartment three weeks ago. It's the first stable housing they have had in a long time. \"It's been on and off since 2012, but his whole life has just been place to place, and we really never had our own space.\" Lisa Owens said. The Family Promise of the Triangle provides temporary shelter for families experiencing homelessness but it also has a transitional housing program that helps families create a future. \"There are requirements where they have to be employed; they have to put so much into an escrow account every month; they have to work with their case manager; they have budgeting skills; they attend life skills classes.\"Scott Ferris, Family Promise of the Triangle, said. Family Promise has turned a former student housing complex into 12 three-bedroom, three-bath apartments. It keeps things as normal as possible for families, especially children. \"A child that experiences homelessness is one to two years behind in school,\" Ferris said. \"They're more likely to suffer from depression and anxiety, more likely to commit suicide.\" Ferris says they served 136 families across six programs last year, up from the previous year, and the need is just increasing. \"We have calls between 15 and 20 a day now, people requesting services,\" Ferris said. Owens has a job cleaning houses and has enrolled her six-year-old in school. For the first time in a long time, she has hope. \"Being a single mom is something else. The girls, I had help with their dad, and I don't get child support or anything, and it's scary, and just to be here is stability,\" Owens said. related •Credits [Jelia Hepner](/rs/bio/20740495/)",

    "text": "Embassy of Japan, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary His Excellency\n2024-10-25: Dear Sir,\nHurricane Milton has caused great damage in the United States. Not only in the United States, but also in Russia and China, \"damage\" due to abnormal weather has occurred. .\nThe Amazon River has \"dried up\" in Brazil. In Japan, \"crops\" have \"abnormally har-vested\" due to abnormal weather. \"Seafood\" catches have also changed signifi-cantly. .\nThese abnormal weather events have been blamed on the increase in \"CO2\". The world has been working hard to \"reduce\" \"CO2\". However, there is something that everyone is \"turning a blind eye to\". .\nI think that much of the cause of the increase in \"CO2\" is the increase in the use of \"gunpowder\" in war. The world should conclude a new \"Treaty to Prohibit Explosive Weapons\".\nThe conclusion of a \"Treaty to Prohibit Explosive Weapons\" should take precedence over the \"Paris Convention\" and be applied. Trump believes there are \"oppositions,\" but he should \"insist\" on the creation of a \"ban treaty\" for \"gunpowder weapons.\"\nTrump is advocating withdrawal from the \"Paris Convention,\" but a \"ban treaty\" for \"gunpowder weapons\" should be created. I think \"Harris,\" who supports the Ukraine war, will oppose it, but he should make his case for the sake of humanity.\nThree months have passed since Israel's invasion of Gaza. It has become clear that this war has \"emitted a large amount of CO2,\" which exceeds the annual emissions of \"countries affected by climate change,\" such as the \"Central African Republic.\"\nAccording to a report as of June 2024, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions due to Rus-sia's invasion of Ukraine are expected to reach \"at least 175 million tons.\"\nA group of European experts and the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natu-ral Resources of Ukraine announced this on the 13th. The invasion of Ukraine has increased greenhouse gas emissions. This is the annual emissions of 90 million cars.\nThe report states that the additional greenhouse gases generated in the two years since Russia's invasion of Ukraine have reached at least 175 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2), equivalent to \"the equivalent of 90 million gasoline vehicles\" or \"the annual emissions of the Netherlands.\"\nI agree with the voices that the \"popularization of EVs\" is a \"conspiracy theory.\" It was all a forced \"conspiracy theory\" that CO2 could be reduced by popularizing \"EVs.\"\nI think that the EU should withdraw from the \"Paris Agreement\" and continue selling gasoline vehicles. However, they should make further improvements to reduce CO2 emissions.\nI think that Trump, who loves America's \"gasoline-powered cars,\" was \"right\" in his statement. America should use \"gasoline-powered cars\" to realize \"MAGA.\"\nI find it strange that there is no \"official report\" that publishes the emissions of \"CO2 from gunpowder\" in war. Looking at Ukraine and Gaza, I think that abnormal weather will increase.\nTrump should withdraw from the Paris Agreement and insist on a ban treaty on gunpowder weapons. I think he will be hated by the \"war merchants.\" Good luck, Trump!\nPart 1 Citations/References\nWar accelerates the climate crisis! The enormous impact of Israel's invasion of Ga-za on the planet\nhttps://www.eco-online.org/news-2024-1-11/\nI will write again tomorrow.\nPart 2. Japan is a \"state of abnormal human rights violations\". \"Everyone\" of the \"international community\", please help!\nFirst of all, please read \"false accusation\" in the 2010 \"Crime of Supporting Violation of Immigration Law\".\nReason for punishment:\nA Chinese national obtained a \"residence status\" by submitting a \"false employment contract.\" And they committed immigration law violations (activities outside of their qualifications).\nBecause \"we\" provided \"false employment contract documents\" to the Chinese, the Chinese were able to obtain \"residence status.\"\nThe Chinese were able to \"live\" in Japan because they obtained a \"status of residence\".\nBecause the Chinese were able to \"live\" in Japan, they were able to \"work illegally.\"\nTherefore, ``we'' who ``provided'' the Chinese with ``false employment contract documents'' were punished as ``helping'' the Chinese ``activities outside the scope of their status of residence''.\nThis is an arbitrary \"error of applicable law\". This is out of the \"logic of the law\".\nMy claim:\n\"1\" The Immigration Control Act stipulates that the Minister of Justice will take an \"administrative disposition\" (Immigration Control Act: Cancellation of the status of residence) for the act of submitting false documents and obtaining a status of residence. You are now \"finished\". \"Aiding\" an act of innocence is innocence.\nA Chinese national who has engaged in “2” (activities outside the qualification) is not guilty. The reason is that the \"person who hired them\" has not been punished for \"promoting illegal employment\" under the Immigration Control Act. Therefore, by \"equality under the law\", the Chinese are innocent.\nThe revision of the Immigration Control Law in December 2016 made it possible to punish the act of \"providing\" \"false employment contract documents\".\nImplemented from January 2017. According to Article 39 of the Constitution, it is not possible to \"retroactively\" to the \"past\" and \"punish\".\nhttps://www.moj.go.jp/isa/laws/h28_kaisei.html\nSee \"Indictment.\" The stated facts \"state\" the \"fact\" of \"not guilty.\" (Japanese English)\nhttp://www.miraico.jp/ICC-crime/2Related%20Documents/%EF%BC%91Indictment.pdf\n\"My Appeal\" (Japanese)\nhttps://blog.goo.ne.jp/nipponnoasa/e/d28c05d97af7a48394921a2dc1ae8f98\n\"My Appeal\" (English)\nhttps://blog.goo.ne.jp/nipponnoasa/e/ac718e4f2aab09297bdab896a94bd194\n\"Chinese, Korean, Filipino, American, etc.\" There are more than tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of victims all over the world. An unusual number of people.\nProsecutors' \"(deprivation) of liberty\" is \"arbitrary.\" They are \"disobeying the law\" and \"selfish\". They have no \"(logical) (necessity)\". The prosecution is \"punishing\" \"as they wish\".\nIn 2010, \"me and the Chinese\" in the immigration violation case, and in 2013, Philippine Embassy staff and diplomats were also punished for the same reason.\n\"I\" argued \"not guilty\", explaining with \"logic of the law\".\nPolice and prosecutors then said, \"(You) should admit (your crime) in general terms.\"\nJapan is the only country that punishes in general terms! .\nThe judge stated \"Causal relationship\" with crazy \"logic\". When I \"see\" (text of the judgment), I \"laugh out loud.\"\nThis case is an error of arbitrary application of law by police officers, prosecutors and judges. The charges are \"abuse of authority of a special public official\" and \"crimes of false complaints.\" The prosecution \"killed\" the \"accusation letter\" and \"accusation letter\" by \"ex officio.\" Therefore, the statute of limitations has been suspended.\nI am \"appealing\" two things.\n1: The foreigner performed \"illegal labor\" other than \"status of residence\". But foreigners are innocent because of \"equality under the law\".\n2: The prosecution “applied” “Articles 60 and 62 of the Penal Code” to Article 70 of the Immigration Control Act on the grounds of “support for Article 22-4-4 of the Immigration Act”. However, it is \"error of applicable law\". (as above).\nKoreans make demands on Japan over the \"solved\" \"comfort women and forced laborers\" issue, but should support \"tens of thousands of Korean victims\" who have been punished for \"violating immigration laws.\" .\nThe Japanese government is hiding Japan's human rights violations by making up such things as \"human rights violations against Uyghurs in China.\"\n\"I\" am demanding \"restoration of honor\" and \"compensation\" for myself, the Chinese, and the Philippine Embassy officials.\nEveryone in the world! ! Victims should report to their respective governments. The governments of each country have an obligation to demand the Japanese government to restore the honor of their own citizens and compensate them.\nPart 3. Construction of special zones.\nThe \"special zone\" \"accepts\" refugees and immigrants as \"temporary immigrant\" workers, limiting their residence to the \"special zone\". Developed countries can use them as low-wage workers for economic growth, and refugees and immigrants can get jobs and live a hopeful human life.\nNo2:\nhttps://world-special-zone.seesaa.net/\nNo1:\nhttps://naganoopinion.blog.jp/\nPart 4.

Michael has been made an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) for services to Association Football, to sport, to charity and to reconciliation in Northern Ireland (Liam McBurney/PA)\nA man who helped to tackle sectarianism in football in Northern Ireland has been made an OBE in the New Year Honours list.\nMichael Boyd, who works at the Human Rights Commission, is being recognised for services to sport and charity work.\nMr Boyd, from Belfast, began his career at the Irish Football Association (IFA) as a community relations officer.\nHe said: “When I first joined they had big problems unfortunately at the (international) games; there were crowds of 4,000.\n“A big part of my job was to try and create a better atmosphere at the internationals and to tackle the issues around sectarianism at the games.\n“When I bump into people they always remember I did a lot of work around the Football for All campaign and working with the Northern Ireland supporters to create a better atmosphere at the international matches.\n“I was very lucky because the Amalgamation of Northern Ireland Supporters’ Clubs were really good to work with and we saw a big transformation.\n“We went from crowds of 4,000 to basically sell-out crowds, it was a lot of work but we got there.\n“It is a much better, more family-friendly experience these days. There was a big transformation in the atmosphere.”\nMr Boyd left the IFA in 2021.\nAs well as his job with the Human Rights Commission he works with the Belfast Healthy Cities initiative, the Rio Ferdinand Foundation and with the charity Street Soccer.\nMr Boyd said he believed the OBE was a recognition of all of his work.\nHe said: “I still do a lot of work around sports and human rights, it is good fun and I get the opportunity to chair a sports and human rights forum which has countries from all around the Commonwealth in it.\n“I had absolutely no idea the honour was coming, I thought it was an elaborate wind-up at first.\n“I honestly couldn’t believe it, it was a shock to the system. I am absolutely delighted.\n“I think the letter went to my old house so I got an email. I was in Geneva and it said I needed to respond in a few days. I really couldn’t believe it.\n“I have no idea who put me forward. It referenced the work I did with Northern Ireland football but also referenced the Rio Ferdinand Foundation and Belfast Healthy Cities.\n“It is such an honour. An OBE is something I never thought of or imagined. I’ve only told my wife so far and my mum and they were buzzing. I am looking forward to my daughters finding out.\n“I have an older brother John who is in the Army and he has an OBE so it is pretty cool for two wee lads from east Belfast both to have OBEs.\n“I think you get an option of where to go to get it, but I’ll definitely be choosing Buckingham Palace; that will be a special day.”",

    "text": "Opositora alerta para “onda migratória” nunca vista na Venezuela se Maduro continuar no poder Líder da oposição assinalou que ainda há tempo de reverter o que, para ela, seria o maior êxodo de venezuelanos publicidade A líder da [oposição venezuelana](https://www.correiodopovo.com.br/not%C3%ADcias/mundo/coordenadora-de-campanha-de-oposi%C3%A7%C3%A3o-a-maduro-%C3%A9-presa-na-venezuela-1.1520565) [María Corina Machado](https://www.correiodopovo.com.br/not%C3%ADcias/mundo/homens-mascarados-invadem-comit%C3%AA-da-l%C3%ADder-da-oposi%C3%A7%C3%A3o-da-venezuela-1.1519200) alertou o México, nesta quinta-feira, 8, para uma \"onda migratória\" sem precedentes na Venezuela se [Nicolás Maduro](https://www.correiodopovo.com.br/not%C3%ADcias/pol%C3%ADtica/celso-amorim-brasil-col%C3%B4mbia-e-m%C3%A9xico-ainda-n%C3%A3o-conseguiram-dialogar-com-maduro-1.1520804) continuar no poder. \"Digo uma coisa [ao México], se Maduro decidir se manter pela força, na marra [no poder], poderemos ver uma onda de migração como nunca vimos: 3, 4, 5 milhões de venezuelanos em muito pouco tempo\", disse María Corina em videoconferência com a imprensa mexicana. A líder da oposição assinalou que ainda há tempo de \"reverter\" o que, para ela, seria o maior êxodo de venezuelanos. \"O México tem um poder muito importante, porque tem um canal direto com o regime\" de Maduro. \"Espero que o governo mexicano compreenda a enorme responsabilidade\" que tem, acrescentou. O governo do México, no entanto, manteve-se afastado das críticas ao processo eleitoral venezuelano e se recusou a participar de uma sessão da Organização dos Estados Americanos (OEA) sobre a crise na Venezuela. \"Não coloquem o nariz\" no processo eleitoral da Venezuela, afirmou em 30 de julho López Obrador, que reiterou que seu governo reconhecerá os resultados do Conselho Nacional Eleitoral (CNE), sob controle do chavismo. María Corina disse ontem que não descarta que o México, a Colômbia e o Brasil, também governados por líderes de esquerda, possam contribuir para \"estabelecer os termos de uma negociação clara, firme e eficaz\" em busca de uma solução na Venezuela. A capital mexicana sediou diálogos entre o governo de Caracas e a oposição nos últimos anos. Segundo dados da ONU, cerca de 7,7 milhões de venezuelanos emigraram nos últimos anos devido à profunda crise econômica e política no país. Os venezuelanos somaram-se aos milhares de migrantes de outros países, principalmente centro-americanos, que atravessam o México para tentar entrar nos Estados Unidos.
