    "text": "Madrid, 13 sep (.).- Los trabajadores de Boeing (NYSE: BA ) han decidido, después de semanas de negociaciones, ir a una huelga tras rechazar el acuerdo entre los sindicatos y el fabricante estadounidense de aviones, que contemplaba un incremento general de los salarios del 25 % en cuatros años y que consideran insuficiente.\nSería la primera huelga de la empresa en 16 años. La anterior fue en 2008 y tuvo un seguimiento de más de 50 días que paralizó la producción y le costó a Boeing unos 100 millones de dólares por día, según señalan medios estadounidenses como WSJ y FT.\nEn concreto, cerca del 95 % de los miembros del sindicato International Association of Machinist (IAM, por sus siglas en inglés) ha votado en contra del acuerdo que incluía el citado incremento salarial hasta 2027.\nEn este sentido, señalan que los aumentos salariales propuestos son escasos tras una década de estancamiento salarial y a tenor del aumento del coste de la vida.\nEsta huelga detendrá la producción de aviones de Boeing, en un momento en el que la compañía arrastra problemas tras el incidente del avión Boeing 737 MAX 9 de Alaska Airlines (NYSE: ALK ) en pleno vuelo, y acentuará la falta de aviones en el sector aéreo.\nEn el marco de las negociaciones, el reciente director ejecutivo de Boeing, Kelly Ortberg, había pedido a los trabajadores que no hiciera huelga y realizó algunas visitas a las fábricas.\nLos miembros del Distrito 751 de la IAM representa a unos 33.000 trabajadores de Boeing.\nLos trabajadores de Boeing acuerdan ir a la huelga, la primera en 16 años",

    "text": "Former Telangana minister and Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) working president K Taraka Ramarao has slammed Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah for taking a ‘U-turn’ on the hijab row. He said that the Congress party is known for breaking promises after coming to power.Also Read - Hijab ban to be lifted in Karnataka, what to wear personal choice: SiddaramaiahWhen asked about his reaction to the lifting of the \\\"ban\\\" on hijab at Karnataka educational institutions, KTR said, “No, they have not lifted the ban yet. The Karnataka CM said that he is still thinking about it. This is what the Congress is popular for. Making promises before the elections and then breaking them by not fulfilling them. Not just in Karnataka, but it has been happening in Telangana as well.”Speaking at an event in Mysuru on Friday, Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah said, “We will be withdrawing the ban on hijab which was imposed by the previous BJP government. I have directed the officials on the same and an official order will come soon regarding it. What to wear and what to eat is a personal choice. Why should the government obstruct such issues? Wear what you want and eat what you feel like.”However, on Saturday, Siddaramaiah clarified that the ban has not been lifted yet. “We have not lifted the ban yet. We are thinking about it. After speaking to experts, we will take a call,\\\" he added.The hijab controversy first erupted in January last year when six students of the Government Pre-University (PU) College in Udupi accused the institute’s administration of not allowing them to enter the premises with their hijab on. The Muslim girls protested outside the institute after being denied entry.In response, several Hindu students started attending classes wearing saffron shawls in several educational institutions.On March 15 last year, the Karnataka high court declared that wearing the hijab was not mandatory in Islam and upheld the executive order. The students have moved the Supreme Court.",

    "text": "Where to drink\nWhere to drink now: 6 best bars near the Fort Worth Stock Show & Rodeo\nFor patrons of the 2025 Fort Worth Stock Show & Rodeo looking to whet their whistles nearby, this edition of Where to Drink is for you. From old-school dives that have drawn rodeo regulars for decades to newer establishments known for glitz, glam, and great cocktails, these six spots are sure to provide for legendary good times. Here are six top Fort Worth bars just a lasso's throw from Will Rogers and Dickies Arena, with one even right on-site.\nLooking for live music during the FWSSR? Find the whole musical lineup here with even more bars on-site to visit during the event.\nThe Bar at Bowie HouseThe newest be-seen spot for pre-rodeo cocktails is this cowboy-chic bar inside Bowie House, Auberge Resorts Collection hotel (3700 Camp Bowie Blvd.). In fact, the bar has been busy with nearby locals nightly since it opened one year ago. National Cutting Horse Association hall-of-famer Jo Ellard is the visionary behind the Western-inspired hotel, making it a perfect fit for a rodeo season pit stop. (The intricate details on the antique bar, including its triple archway, weathered mirrors, and ornate wooden details, are stunning.) Try the Two Dozen Roses, made with Hendricks Gin, Combier Rose liqueur, and cucumber, or the Bowie House Old Fashioned, made with Bowie House private barrel Maker's Mark and Dr Pepper cherry Syrup.\nSarah’s PlaceThe neighborhood bar (5223 Camp Bowie Blvd.) is well-known as the place for post-rodeo drinks, especially for those involved in the three-week event who might need a nightcap after a long day. The epitome of a casual dive bar, Sarah’s intimate atmosphere boasts vinyl high-back barstools, TVs for game-watching, and one of Fort Worth’s most popular karaoke scene after dark. For drinks, think simplistic classics like gin and tonic, vodka soda, whiskey and water, or a cold longneck.\nReata at the Backstage ClubBefore Dickies Arena opened in 2019, rodeo performances were held at the historic Will Rogers Coliseum, where the members-only Backstage Club drew well-dressed rodeo-goers (and even a few celebs) for cocktails overlooking the arena action for more than 50 years. Operated by Reata, the Backstage Club (3301 West Lancaster Ave.) is now open to the public and is considered a rite of rodeo passage for a pre-performance libation. While reservations are recommended for dinner, anyone can visit for open seating in the bar area - just take the short elevator ride up from the ground level of Will Rogers Coliseum. It’s hard to go wrong with a salt-rimmed margarita or cold beer while there.\nThe Circle Bar at The Crescent HotelAnother popular hotel bar welcoming rodeo-goers is The Circle Bar inside The Crescent Hotel (3300 Camp Bowie Blvd.). The 360-degree bar surrounded by floor-to-ceiling windows offers plenty of room to kick your boots up before or after heading to Dickies Arena. During rodeo season, the bar will feature specialty drinks made with Sir Davis Whiskey, Glenmorangie scotch, and Belvedere Vodka, along with Texas wines from Lost Draw Cellars and William Chris, and Fort Worth beers from Cowtown Brewing and Rahr & Sons Brewing Co. There’ll also be Texas-inspired bar bites like prosciutto-wrapped quail, porchetta sliders, and Texas cheese and charcuterie, along with live music on weekends. “Social Hour” is 4-6 pm Monday-Thursday and includes specials on Aperol spritzes, old fashioneds, margaritas, and gin or vodka martinis. (Oysters are only $2, too.)\nAncho Chili Bar at Michaels CuisineA longstanding rodeo-season tradition is meeting at Michaels (3413 W. 7th St.) before heading to the arena – more specifically, the restaurant’s separate bar area located immediately to the right upon entering. The 30-plus year-old destination for contemporary ranch-style cuisine remains a popular spot for cowboys and cowgirls to show off their turquoise and boots for pre-show drinks and bar bites. It’s owner and chef Michael Thomson’s favorite time of year, so much so that he offers a special\nStock Show menujust for the occasion. From the\nbar menu, try the Michaels Makers Manhattan garnished with a Bordeaux cherry, or the Fort Worth Blackland Bliss made with Blackland Distillery gin, elderflower liqueur, and grapefruit juice.\nShowdown SaloonEstablished in 1972, the Showdown Saloon (4907 Camp Bowie Blvd.) is an institution for cold beer and good times. The list of regulars is long, and many of them have their very own beer mug hanging from the ceiling over the bar. There are TVs with sports, a small back patio, and pool and foosball tables. Rodeo fans are always welcome to the old-school dive bar, so belly up to the bar and stay a while.",

    "title": "Hugo Weaving Laments Time in Middle-earth; Not First to Dislike a Classic",
    "text": "‘I don’t particularly want to go back there’ … Hugo Weaving as Elrond in The Lord of the Rings. Photograph: Moviestore/REX Shutterstock It probably shouldn’t be a huge shock that Hugo Weaving has admitted to not really feeling The Lord of the Rings movies. After all, if you were stuck in Rivendell playing Elrond the half-elven for years, reciting lines primarily for haughty, eyebrow-arched exposition while everyone else got to battle orcs and ride giant eagles, you might feel a bit bitter too.\nDiscussing the new season of the Tolkien prequel, The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, the British actor revealed this week that he hasn’t watched a second of the Amazon Prime Video show. Nor has he seen actor Robert Aramayo’s portrayal of a younger Elrond, because he “spent too long in Middle-earth” and doesn’t “particularly want to go back there.” Speaking to Radio Times, Weaving described his part as “not a role that I think of with the same sort of stature in my head as it might do for fans.”\nThis perspective might be understandable. Although those movies are untouchable masterpieces for many of us who watch them repeatedly, they can be nothing more than a time-consuming paycheck for the actors involved. Weaving isn’t the first actor to harbor a distaste for a beloved genre role.\nAlec Guinness was less than enthusiastic about his Oscar-nominated role as Obi-Wan Kenobi in Star Wars. He once told Talk magazine that he suggested to George Lucas to kill off the Jedi Master in 1977’s Star Wars because he “couldn’t go on speaking those bloody awful, banal lines.” Guinness also wrote in his memoir, “A Positively Final Appearance,” that he agreed to give a young fan an autograph on the condition the boy would never watch the movie again.\nIn 1978, Marlon Brando was somehow convinced by Warner Bros. to play Superman’s father, Jor-El, in a big budget reboot of the superhero franchise. Brando received an impressive $3.7 million and 11.75% of the box office gross. However, he showed such minimal interest in the role that filmmakers had to entice him out of his trailer with food just to get him to do a day’s shoot. Even then, Brando refused to learn his lines, requiring the crew to use cue cards.\nThe list of similarly disgruntled actors goes on. Harrison Ford, who also criticized Star Wars’ clunky dialogue, detested the original cut of 1982’s Blade Runner so much that it was rumored he recorded the film’s voiceover with the least enthusiasm possible, hoping it would be discarded. He denied this, stating he was contractually obliged to record the audio but did so imagining it wouldn’t be used.\nMax von Sydow might have disliked portraying Ming the Merciless in 1980’s Flash Gordon, and it’s hard to picture Orson Welles enjoying voicing the villain Unicron in 1986’s animated The Transformers: The Movie. It seems unlikely that Oscar winner Faye Dunaway relished playing the villainous Selena in 1984’s critically panned Supergirl.\nThe difference between the past and the modern day is that performances by actors like Guinness and Brando changed perspectives on genre fare. These days, Blade Runner is considered a dystopian masterpiece. Star Wars is part of Hollywood history, and if high-caliber actors like Stellan Skarsgård, Diego Luna, and Adam Driver are involved, it’s hard to argue there’s any stigma attached to roles in ostensibly very silly space movies about wizards with laser swords.\nIn a way, it’s surprising to see Weaving biting the fantasy hand that feeds him, albeit in a polite and semi-apologetic manner.\nWe can, of course, forgive him. Like Guinness and Brando before him, if the actor truly is just phoning it in for the money in Jackson’s swords and sorcery series, only the guy whose job it was to cajole him onto the sound stage would be able to tell.\nSource: The Guardian",

    "title": "Trail Ridge Middle School Leads the Way with Unified Theater Program",
    "text": "Trail Ridge Middle School has become the first middle school in St. Vrain Valley Schools to introduce a Unified Theater program, a milestone that highlights the school’s dedication to providing meaningful opportunities for students of all abilities. Building on its strong Unified program, which has earned numerous awards, including this year’s “Chaka Sutton” Unified Champion School of the Year from Special Olympics Colorado, the theater initiative showcases the schools focus on fostering collaboration and connections.\n“The idea to start Unified Theater program at Trail Ridge felt natural,” said Drama Teacher Lindsay Sullivan. “I knew if the district was going to create a Unified program at the middle school level, it had to start here. Seeing the success of Unified Theater programs at Niwot High and Frederick High gave me the confidence to take the leap.”\nThe program’s debut production, The Enchanted Garden , will premiere on Friday, December 6, at 5 p.m. at Trail Ridge Middle School. Co-written by Sullivan and Special Education Teacher Becci Warren the play aligns with the program’s goals by celebrating themes of friendship and kindness. “Writing my own play allowed me to create the most accommodating experience possible,” said Sullivan. “ The Enchanted Garden offers roles tailored to each student’s unique strengths and opens opportunities for students of all abilities, both on stage and behind the scenes.”\nRehearsals have already shown how impactful Unified Theater can be. Students from Sullivan’s Technical Theater program have taken on mentorship roles, helping peers with speech and movement during rehearsals. “It’s been inspiring to see students not only perform but also help each other with speech and movement. The connections they’re building are incredible,” said Sullivan. “Many of our Unified students are performing for their first time, and their growth has been a source of pride for everyone involved.”\nFor eighth grader Molly Brickley, being part of Unified Theater has been an unforgettable experience. “I’ve had the privilege of working on lights, sound, and even designing the costumes for the production. I joined Unified Theater because I love helping everyone, and theater is something I’m really passionate about,” she said. “Having Unified Theater at our school is so exciting. It’s amazing to see everyone working together and supporting each other.”\nThe program has been met with enthusiasm from parents, students, and staff alike. Parents of Unified students are particularly excited about the new opportunities it provides, giving their children a chance to participate in ways that were not available before. The initiative highlights the school’s dedication to collaboration and kindness while reinforcing that theater truly is for everyone.\nTrail Ridge’s Unified Theater program exemplifies the school’s mission to create opportunities that connect and empower students. “The more programs we create that bring people together, the stronger our school community becomes — not just within our walls, but outside of them as well,” said Warren “We want to develop a school where everyone has something they can participate in and feel successful. The confidence this builds in students will encourage them to be great people throughout their lives.”",

    "title": "Australia beat Pakistan by 79 runs to win second Test and series",
    "text": "A fired-up Pat Cummins bagged five wickets and 10 for the match to earn Australia a nail-biting 79-run win in the second Test and clinch the series against Pakistan on Friday. Set 317 to win, the visitors put up a stellar fight, but were dismissed for 237, with the last five wickets falling for just 18 runs. Cummins was the chief destroyer, taking 5-49 to go with his first innings of 5-48 — only the second 10-wicket haul of his Test career. Just when it looked like the match would go down to the wire on the final day, the pacer stepped in to remove batter Mohammad Rizwan and claim his 250th test wicket. Mitchell Starc chipped in with 4-55 as the tail collapsed after Shan Masood (60), Agha Salman (50) and Babar Azam (41) gave them a fighting chance. It was always going to be a tough task, with the highest-ever successful fourth innings run chase at the Melbourne Cricket Ground the 332-7 England managed in 1928, with no other team getting past 300. Opener Abdullah Shafique departed for four during a tricky session before lunch, caught by Usman Khawaja in the slips off Starc following a period of intense pressure. Iman-ul-Haq survived the initial blitz, but was no match after the break for Cummins, who sent down a probing ball that nipped back and trapped him lbw for 12. Masood was given out lbw by the umpire on 12, but it was overturned on review and he quickly got back in his stride. He took a nasty ball to the ribs that needed treatment, but was undeterred and raced to a gutsy 50 before Cummins again came to Australia’s rescue, enticing an edge to Steve Smith. Plenty was resting on the shoulders of Azam as the side’s premier batter and he looked in good nick. But after reaching 41, Josh Hazlewood got a ball to jag back and it clattered into his off stump. Rizwan also looked dangerous on his way to 35 before Cummins again worked his magic, with Alex Carey collecting a catch behind the stumps after the ball went off the batsman’s glove. Cummins then removed Aamer Jamal and Shaheen Shah Afridi in quick succession before Starc cleaned up. Bounced back Pakistanis padded up after the hosts were all out in their second innings for 262, after resuming on 187-6. Mir Hamza was the best of the bowlers with 4-32, while Afridi took 4-76. Carey slammed 53 to help Australia build their overnight lead and quieten chatter about his form after losing his place in the one-day side to Josh Inglis. He resumed on 16 after Australia had bounced back from 16-4 thanks to an attacking 96 from Mitchell Marsh and Smith’s gutsy 50. Carey, who made his first and only Test hundred in Melbourne a year ago, hit consecutive fours in his first over from Hasan Ali to build confidence. At the other end, Starc lived dangerously and fell for nine with the impressive Afridi getting the breakthrough on a pitch still offering a bit for the bowlers. Azam took the sharp chance at slip after Starc miscued a drive. Cummins made a breezy 16 but was caught behind by Rizwan off Jamal, while Lyon crunched two straight fours off Jamal, then was bowled for 11 three deliveries later. Carey brought up his sixth Test half-century before being the last man out, lbw to Hamza. Positive Masood rues giving ruthless Australia a sniff Skipper Shan Masood rued his side letting Australia off the hook at key moments in the second test but was taking plenty of positives from defeat. “We’ve taken 20 wickets which we haven’t done in Australia for a while, that’s a box ticked,” he said. “In terms of runs, everyone got good starts and there were some nice fifties but in test cricket against quality sides, you want to get the hundreds. “So a lot to work on but this is the blueprint of the way we want to play test cricket and hopefully we’ll keep doing that.” Masood thought it was clear where the match had been lost. “(You can’t) give a quality side like Australia a sniff, which we did. Maybe sometimes with the ball, maybe sometimes with the bat, yesterday maybe in the field,” he added. “If you (don’t) drop someone in form like Mitchell Marsh, we might […] have been chasing 237 today, but mistakes happen,” he said. Masood said it was imperative that the batsmen produced bigger scores if they were to compete with the Australians in the third and final test in Sydney next week. “They’re ruthless,” he added. “They have some world-class bowlers in their ranks and if you give them a sniff, if you don’t convert your fifties into hundreds, you might not have enough runs on the board,” he said.",
