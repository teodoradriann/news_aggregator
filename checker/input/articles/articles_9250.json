    "title": "Greenpeace warnt vor Hitze in Schulen - wien.ORF.at",
    "text": "Nicht nur die Matura, sondern auch die Temperaturen haben die Schülerinnen und Schüler in den letzten Wochen zum Schwitzen gebracht. An 25 der letzten 30 Tagen gab es in den Klassenzimmern des Gymnasiums Maroltingergasse in Ottakring mehr als 27 Grad, an 16 Tagen sogar über 30 Grad. „Teilweise sind die Klassenräume so aufgeheizt, dass Kinder Kreislaufprobleme bekommen. Wir brauchen dringend Unterstützung vom Bund, um unser Schulgebäude an die veränderten Bedingungen anzupassen“, sagte Direktorin Elisabeth Gutenberg in einer Aussendung der NGO Greenpeace.\nMehr als 38 Grad im Klassenzimmer\nGemeinsam mit der BOKU hat Greenpeace die Temperaturen gemessen. Ein Beispiel: Am 13. Juni hatte es bereits zu Unterrichtsbeginn rund 28 Grad und obwohl die Außentemperatur den ganzen Tag darunter blieb, stieg die Temperatur im Klassenzimmer auf über 32 Grad an. Die höchste Temperatur in dem Gebäude betrug laut einem Hitze-Dashboard der NGO über 38 Grad.\nHerbert Formayer, Professor am BOKU-Institut für Meteorologie und Klimatologie, betonte: „Die Durchschnittstemperatur in Österreich liegt bereits um 3,1 Grad über dem vorindustriellen Niveau. Der Großteil der Erwärmung erfolgte seit den 1980er Jahren. Viele österreichische Schulen sind deutlich früher und damit unter anderen Bedingungen gebaut worden. In Klassenzimmern ohne entsprechende Maßnahmen gegen Überhitzung wie in der Maroltingergasse spitzt sich die Situation prekär zu.“\nNGO fordert Sofortprogramm\nGleichzeitig sei es keine Möglichkeit, nicht zu Lüften. Der CO2-Gehalt in den Klassenzimmern würde auf unzumutbare Werte steigen. Greenpeace fordert deshalb vom Bund ein Sofortprogramm für hitzetaugliche Schulen, sagte Klima- und Energieexpertin Jasmin Duregger von Greenpeace. „Die Bundesregierung muss endlich handeln und genug Budget und Ressourcen bereitstellen, um Schulen vor Hitze zu schützen – mit Sanierungen, außenliegender Beschattung und modernen Lüftungssystemen.“",

    "text": "Unprecedented Telecom Breach Linked to China Sparks Concerns\nThe U.S. reports a major telecommunications hack linked to China, declaring it the largest in history. Hackers intercepted U.S. law enforcement surveillance data and unofficially accessed political figures' communications. Beijing denies these allegations amidst growing concerns about telecoms' security vulnerabilities.\nThe United States is grappling with an unprecedented breach of telecommunications security, allegedly linked to China, with officials dubbing it the largest telecom hack in national history. The chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee revealed this information to the Washington Post, highlighting serious security implications.\nAuthorities reported earlier this month that hackers had accessed surveillance data intended for law enforcement. The breach affected multiple telecom networks, allowing unauthorized access to U.S. customer call records and communications from select political figures, as confirmed by a joint FBI and CISA statement.\nDespite China's repeated denials of these accusations, concerns over the vulnerability of U.S. telecom infrastructure are on the rise. This incident, reportedly involving communications of prominent political figures, underscores the ongoing threats posed by cyber-infiltration globally.\nALSO READ\n[ED Raids Amazon and Flipkart Vendors Amidst FDI Rule Breach Allegations](/article/headlines/3148865-ed-raids-amazon-and-flipkart-vendors-amidst-fdi-rule-breach-allegations)[Rising Tensions: Ceasefire Breaches in Eastern Congo](/article/law-order/3150734-rising-tensions-ceasefire-breaches-in-eastern-congo)[Odisha FC Aims to Breach Mohun Bagan’s Defensive Wall in Crucial ISL Clash](/article/sports-games/3151902-odisha-fc-aims-to-breach-mohun-bagans-defensive-wall-in-crucial-isl-clash)[Kerala's Left Government Suspends IAS Officers Over Code of Conduct Breaches](/article/law-order/3153559-keralas-left-government-suspends-ias-officers-over-code-of-conduct-breaches)[TMC Files Complaint Against Suvendu Adhikari for MCC Breach](/article/politics/3152680-tmc-files-complaint-against-suvendu-adhikari-for-mcc-breach)",

    "title": "Drunk Ukrainians Decided to Blow Up Nord Stream with Zelensky’s OK",
    "text": "Volodymyr Zelensky approved the operation with US allies to blow up the Russian Nord Stream Pipeline to Europe. A bunch of drunken Ukrainians decided to blow up Nord Stream, and that’s how it came about.\nThe Wall Street Journal reports: In May of 2022, a handful of senior Ukrainian military officers and businessmen had gathered to toast their country’s remarkable success in halting the Russian invasion. Buoyed by alcohol and patriotic fervor, somebody suggested a radical next step: destroying Nord Stream.\nAfter all, the twin natural-gas pipelines that carried Russian gas to Europe were providing billions to the Kremlin war machine. What better way to make Vladimir Putin pay for his aggression?\nJust over four months later, in the small hours of Sept. 26 , Scandinavian seismologists picked up signals indicating an underwater earthquake or volcanic eruption hundreds of miles away, near the Danish island of Bornholm. They were caused by three powerful explosions and the largest-ever recorded release of natural gas, equivalent to the annual CO2 emissions of Denmark.\n[…] Now, for the first time, the outlines of the real story can be told. The Ukrainian operation cost around $300,000, according to people who participated in it. It involved a small rented yacht with a six-member crew, including trained civilian divers. One was a woman, whose presence helped create the illusion they were a group of friends on a pleasure cruise.\n“I always laugh when I read media speculation about some huge operation involving secret services, submarines, drones, and satellites,” one officer who was involved in the plot said. “The whole thing was born out of a night of heavy boozing and the iron determination of a handful of people who had the guts to risk their lives for their country.”\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky initially approved the plan, according to one officer who participated and three people familiar with it. But later, when the CIA learned of it and asked the Ukrainian president to pull the plug, he ordered a halt, those people said.\nVia Euro News : German prosecutors issued the first arrest warrant in their investigation into the undersea explosions in 2022 that damaged the Nord Stream gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea, according to media reports on Wednesday.\nGerman public broadcaster ARD, the daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung and the weekly Die Zeit said in a joint report that federal prosecutors obtained an arrest warrant in June against a Ukrainian national who was believed to have been living, until recently, in Poland.\nThe reports, which did not cite sources, identified the man as Volodymyr Z and suggested he had recently returned to Ukraine.\n[Volodymyr Z, you say? This is beginning to sound like a bad C movie plot. I wonder if they’re looking for a Ukrainian named Joe B?]\n[…] It remains a mystery who was responsible for the sabotage, and investigators have been tight-lipped about their findings so far.\nSwedish and Danish authorities closed their investigations in February, leaving the German prosecutors’ case as the sole probe.\nIf true, the CIA and Biden regime lied to the American public for two years now. I can’t believe that they do that.\nThis looks like a planted intel story to me. This sounds like a satire from Babylon Bee, but it’s not. They want you to believe this.",

He said the EU commended and strongly supported the efforts of France and the United States to achieve a negotiated ceasefire and renewed the call on all parties to protect and support the critical mission of (UNIFI)L United Nations Peacekeeping Forces in Lebanon.\nThe EU official reiterated in the statement its strong support for Lebanon's state institutions, including the Lebanese Armed Forces, and said it stands ready to help Lebanon get out of its political impasse. Borrell underlined that \"EU member states have a long tradition of supporting Lebanon,\" adding that the Lebanese people can rest assured that member states and the EU will continue supporting them.

    "text": "Honey Glazed Carrots are quick and easy to make with just a few ingredients that you likely already have on hand! They’re cooked on the stove-top to sweet, buttery perfection with honey, butter, and just a touch of fresh lemon. Great for complimenting both holiday feasts and easy weeknight dinners!\nEnjoy more of my favorite carrot recipes like\nBalsamic Carrots and Honey Roasted Carrots.\nTable of Contents\nIf you’re looking for a vegetable side dish that both kids and adults will eat, glazed carrots is the way to go! Carrots have a natural sweetness, so kids usually like them. And when you cook them with butter and honey, they truly become irresistible.\nCarrots are full of vitamins and nutrients like beta carotene, fiber, Vitamin A, Vitamin K, potassium, and antioxidants. Even cooked butter and honey, carrots still provide great health benefits!\nOur holiday table is not not complete without these beautiful honey glazed carrots. Sometimes I add fun ingredient like lemon, orange, cinnamon, or cayenne pepper. Each additional ingredient takes the flavor of the carrots to a whole new level. Orange or lemon are typically my favorite add-ins, but when I want to add some heat, cayenne pepper is the way to go. Combine cayenne pepper with orange for s spicy orange twist.\nIngredient Notes\nCarrots – Be sure to wash and peel the carrots prior to cutting them.\nButter – It can be salted or unsalted, whichever you prefer. I recommend using unsalted so you can control the amount of sodium added to the dish.\nOlive Oil – If you’d prefer, you can swap this with avocado oil.\nLemon Juice – Freshly squeezed lemon juice is best!\nHoney – Try to use a good quality honey for the very best flavor if possible.\nSee recipe card for complete information on ingredients and quantities.\nHow to Make Honey Glazed Carrots\nPrepare the carrots. Wash and peel the carrots. Then, cut them on the bias at about a 45° angle. Make sure all of the slices are about the same size so they cook evenly!\nCook the carrots. Add olive oil to a pan over medium heat. Add the carrots, season with salt and pepper, and cover the pan. Cook for just about 5 minutes.\nAdd final ingredients. Flip all of the carrots over. Add butter, honey, lemon juice, and parsley. Once the butter melts, stir it all together and let simmer until the carrots are tender. Stir once in a while.\nPRO TIP: You can cook carrots a little softer or a little crunchier, according you your personal taste.\nTips for the Best Honey Butter Glazed Carrots\n- When cutting carrots, make sure that they are as uniform in size as possible to ensure even cooking.\n- If using young carrots, you won’t need to peel them but wash them and scrub the thin outer layer of the skin.\n- Don’t overcrowd the pan! This will ensure even cooking and you can get some sear of the carrots if you’d like.\n- If you want to get some sear on your carrots, let them cook without moving or tossing for about 5 minutes. This will ensure some beautiful browning on the outside.\nAdditional Flavors\n- Feel free to add some nuts like chopped almonds or pecans.\n- If you want to add some seasonal flavor, try fall spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice.\n- For those who like a spicy touch, add a pinch of cayenne pepper. The spice will work great with the sweetness of honey.\n- You can finish cooked glazed carrots with a squeeze of lemon juice, a pinch of fresh ginger, or squeeze of orange juice.\n- If you want stronger lemon or orange flavor, mix in lemon or orange zest during the last 5 minutes of cooking.\nMake Ahead and Reheating Instructions\nYou can simply wash, peel, and cut carrots ahead of time. Place cut carrots into a zip-lock bag and keep it in the fridge for a day or two before cooking.\nEven though carrots only take about 20 minutes to cook, you can still make them ahead of time. Cook carrots a day ahead and store in a plastic container with an airtight lid.\nTo reheat cooked carrots, you can use a microwave or in a pan on the stove. In a microwave, make sure to reheat them in a microwave-safe container and covered with a microwave lid or another plate. In the pan, reheat over medium heat, covered with a lid, just until heated through.\nRecipe FAQs\nAbsolutely! You can easily use baby carrots to make pan-roasted glazed carrots, but you have to make sure they are close to the same size. This means if you have thick carrots in the mix, you would need to cut them in half, length-wise.\nLet the cooked carrots cool to room temperature before transferring into an airtight storage container. Pop them in the fridge for just 1-2 days before reheating in the microwave or back in the pan.\nThis veggie side dish helps balance heartier main courses like\nLamb Chops and Beef Tenderloin. It also plates well beside entrees like Roast Chicken and Garlic Pork Loin. Since it’s a sweet side dish, I don’t recommend pairing it with another sweeter side dish! Think more along the lines of savory sides like Mashed Potatoes and Roasted Mushrooms.\nMore Vegetable Side Dish Recipes\nDID YOU MAKE THIS RECIPE? PLEASE leave a 🌟 star rating!
