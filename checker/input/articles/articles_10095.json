    "text": "President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo has reaffirmed his commitment to developing a resilient cocoa industry that prioritises the welfare of cocoa farmers.\nHe made the comments during the official opening of the permanent office of the Cote d’Ivoire-Ghana Cocoa Initiative in Accra.\nUnderlining his government’s accomplishments President Akufo-Addo stressed that his administration has instituted the highest cocoa producer price in the nation’s history.\n“In 2019, Ghana and Cote d’Ivoire met in Accra where we held a dialogue on an important subject, which was critical to the survival of the global cocoa industry supply chain. That meeting, culminated in the adoption of a living income deferential for cocoa producers in the two countries which involves the additional payment of cocoa farmers of $400 per ton on the world market price for every cocoa sold by the two nations effective by the 2020/2021 season.\n“The international cocoa market justifies our course of action. What we thought was impossible only two years ago is happening now,” he stated.\nHowever, President Akufo-Addo also stressed the critical need for collaborative efforts between Ghana and Cote d’Ivoire to address the myriad of challenges confronting the cocoa industry.\n“However, with the current peak in market prices, a new set of challenges has emerged necessitating a revision of the research approach to sustain or prevent a decline in prices. This underscores the importance of this organisation for the two countries to devise new strategies to address the evolving market dynamics,” he stated.",

    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\n[#3](c3#c-3) y está escrito, en su libro mágico, que todos los no judíos existen para servir a los judíos.\nSu libro mágico es el bueno, los demás libros mágicos no.\n[#19](c19#c-19) En realidad sí, pero no te alarmes, no hay construcción de la identidad etnica de un grupo (y más si se trata de uno generalmente minoritario y perseguido)n sin su dosis de etnocentrismo.\nEn el caso de los creyentes en yahvé el resto de la humanidad es referida como “goyim”, o “gentiles” y no tiene connotaciones especialmente positivas.\n[#3](c3#c-3) Típico de fanatismos y sectas cuando se hace una barrera entre los que están dentro y los que están fuera. Cuando la religión no respeta otras formas de ver el mundo es cuando empiezan los fanatismos y las hostias. Si no se acepta la diversidad de credos, apaga y vámonos porque lo que viene luego no es agradable para nadie.\nLuego empezarán con sus Frentes Populares de Judea y acabarán a hostia limpia entre ellos, porque alguien que necesita y busca enemigos para elevar su moral y sus creencias son un saco de hostias en potencia. Alguien que piense así, tiene todas las papeletas para recibir hostias a cascoporro y es lo que van buscando. Quien anda con fuego acaba quemándose.\n[#5](c5#c-5) En realidad este discurso en concreto se parece más al del ISIS que al de Hitler.\nAunque el resultado de ambos sea el mismo.\n[#9](c9#c-9) Creo que el problema es que eso lo dice la religión de los judíos, que son descendientes de no sé qué tribu elegida por un dios.\nY habrá judíos que se tomen el judaismo como pertenencia a un grupo y lo reinterpretan y lo ponen al servicio de su vida (igual que hay cristianos que no apedrean a su hija si se casa sin el permiso de su padre). Pero el judaismo tiene una base de supremacismo muy mala de esquivar.\n[#2](c2#c-2) Un mes.. da un mes, al resto del planeta - sin eeuu... iban a ver los \"elegidos\" que opinan de aquello del \"pueblo elegido\"...\nPues para ser el pueblo elegido:\n- menuda mierda territorio les ha dado, a mí que me den algo que no sea un puto desierto: Francia, El norte de España, Italia, las Seychelles, las mismas orillas del Nilo, Mesopotamia. Zonas fértiles.\n- Salvo los últimos 70 años les han dado más que a una estera.\nAsí que menudo dios cutre.\n[#11](c11#c-11) Eso es: si su dios los hubiera elegido y les tuviera cariño bien pudo haberles dao cuerpo de senegalés...\n[#11](c11#c-11) Un amigo ingeniero agrónomo me contó que aquella zona en tiempos bíblicos fue un vergel, pero empezaron a regar los cultivos con agua de mar y se lo cargaron. No son muy listos los “elegidos”.\nSi Dios existiera haría un fisting con su culo y les enviaría al puto infierno por toda la eternidad.\n[#23](c23#c-23) No sé salvaron los que no quisieron realizar la Aliá (que empezó en 1840 https://es.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali%C3%A1 ) y a esos que no se salvaron los llamaron los sacrificados o holocausto https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocausto_(sacrificio)\nEs supremacista (pueblo elegido, el resto está para servir) y elitista (no buscan crear nuevos adeptos como en el cristianismo o islamismo o naces judío o no eres judío)\nEsto lo dicen los lideres religiosos judios y la mayoria de ellos lo aceptan como algo natural y te lo repiten con otras palabras menos extremas pero que vienen a ser lo mismo\nPues al final hablando así hasta hacen buenos a los nazis, igual estaban engañados con esta gente...",

    "title": "\" CNN Host Struck by Debris on Live Air While Reporting Hurricane Milton: A Dramatic Tale of Survival \"",
    "text": "CNN Host Struck by Flying Debris While Reporting on Hurricane Milton CNN’s on-ground reporter faced a terrifying incident while covering the chaos of Hurricane Milton, as debris flew into the camera’s shot during a live broadcast. This dramatic moment underscores the severe impact of the storm as it wreaked havoc across Florida.\nHurricane Milton Causes Devastating Damage in Florida With at least 17 confirmed deaths , Hurricane Milton has left a trail of destruction across the state of Florida. Experts warn that the risk of flooding persists, potentially lasting for “days to weeks.” Authorities are scrambling to assess the damage, particularly in the severely affected west-central region of the state.\nAs of early Saturday, approximately 1.8 million households remain without power, prompting over 50,000 utility workers to be deployed for restoration efforts, as confirmed by Governor Ron DeSantis.\nEnvironmental Impact A phosphate mine operator faced backlash after releasing thousands of gallons of pollutants into Tampa Bay due to overflowing drains during the storm.\nHurricane Milton’s Powerful Path Hurricane Milton made landfall as a Category 3 storm on Wednesday night, particularly affecting Sarasota County’s Siesta Key. The hurricane’s force spurred numerous tornadoes, created 28-ft waves, and produced heavy rainfall and severe storm surges.\nTragedies struck in a retirement community in St. Lucie County, where six lives were claimed after tornadoes surged through the area in a mere 20 minutes.\nSubstantial winds caused a crane to topple onto The Tampa Bay Times building in St. Petersburg, while the Tampa Bay Rays reported significant damage to the roof of their Tropicana Field stadium.\nStorm Outcome and Community Resilience As recovery and rescue operations continue, Florida’s communities are rallying together. Evacuations preceding the storm likely mitigated the potential death toll, with many recalling the devastation from Hurricane Helene just weeks prior, prompting widespread preparations for Milton.\nLocal Stories of Survival Florida residents, including Fred and Rita Neuman, reflected on their evacuation journey to the Panhandle. Living in Siesta Key, they chose safety after witnessing the terrifying power of Helene. “I love my house, but I’m not dying in it,” Fred stated as he faced the aftermath awaiting at home.\nIn nearby Palmetto, residents Lee and Pamela Essenburm took precautions as winds ravaged their backyard trees. “I wasn’t going to take a chance on it,” Lee expressed, showcasing the community’s proactive stance against such storms.\nFlorida Faces Ongoing Rescue Operations Rescue efforts are crucial as the full scope of Hurricane Milton’s impact becomes clearer. Authorities collaborate with local organizations on search and rescue missions for residents and their animals, including pets unexpectedly caught in the storm’s aftermath.\nEnviromental Observations As the state assesses the storm’s environmental aftermath, reports state the hurricane’s increased rainfall by 20 to 30 percent is attributable to the climate crisis. This includes an approximate 10 percent rise in winds due to humanitarian-driven warming. Experts highlighted the urgency of hurricane preparedness as storm frequency and intensity continue to rise.\nAerial Views of the Destruction Contrasts in safety remind families across Florida of daunting realities. Aerial footage showcases ravaged neighborhoods due to tornadoes as Hurricane Milton passed. This visual evidence underscores the need for expanded emergency measures and community recovery efforts.",
