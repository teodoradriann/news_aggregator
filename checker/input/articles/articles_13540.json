    "text": "Bufera sul partner sciamano della principessa norvegese Martha Offre consigli su come affrontare suicidio causato da 'spirito' STOCCOLMA, 29 DIC - Durek Verrett, il compagno sciamano della principessa norvegese Märtha Louise, figlia del re Harald V, ha suscitato accese polemiche dopo aver pubblicato un video sul suo profilo Instagram in cui offre consigli su come affrontare \"lo spirito suicida\". Nel video, pubblicato ieri, Verrett ammette che si tratta di un argomento delicato e prosegue dando i suoi consigli da sciamano su come scacciare lo spirito. Le affermazioni hanno suscitato reazioni da parte di diverse persone, tra cui Petter Eide dell'associazione 'Leve', che fornisce supporto ai chi ha tentato di togliersi la vita: \"Sostiene che il suicidio sia causato da uno spirito che si è insediato nel corpo e che possa essere scacciato usando la forza mentale.\" ha affermato Eide al quotidiano norvegese VG. \"Non riesco a esprimere quanto mi sconvolga sentire queste sciocchezze. Sta giocando con la vita delle persone\", ha aggiunto. Secondo l'Istituto di Sanità Norvegese, oltre 600 persone si tolgono la vita ogni anno in Norvegia, un dato significativo per un Paese con una popolazione di 5,5 milioni di abitanti. A confronto, il numero annuale di vittime per incidenti stradali si aggira intorno alle 100 persone. (ANSA).",

    "text": "\"Ce n’est juste pas possible\" : À Perpignan, les salariés de Leroy Merlin débrayent pour une augmentation de leur salaire et une prime d’ancienneté\nCe vendredi 29 novembre 2024, entre 9 heures et midi, les salariés de la grande surface perpignanaise ont débrayé à l’appel de la CGT afin de notamment réclamer une hausse de leur salaire.\nIls étaient attendus avec leurs chasubles et leurs pancartes devant le magasin ce vendredi 29 novembre. À l’appel de la CGT FO, une quinzaine d’employés des deux Leroy Merlin des P.-O., celui de Rivesaltes et celui du Mas Galté, s'est mobilisée devant l’enseigne perpignanaise pour protester contre les dernières négociations annuelles. Ils exigent une augmentation de salaire.\nPour une augmentation générale de 70 € brut par mois\n\"Ils ont pris des décisions qui servent ni les salariés, ni l’avenir de l’entreprise et nous en payons le prix. Toutes les propositions ont été balayées d’un revers de main\", martèle la déléguée syndicale Sylvie Valverde, dénonçant un salaire moyen bien trop bas chez les employés. \"Il y a 1,1 % d’augmentation générale face à un milliard d’euros versé aux actionnaires. Ce n’est juste pas possible. Et nos salaires ?\", lance-t-elle.\nEmployée de l’entreprise depuis bientôt 40 ans, la syndicaliste fait également part de son sentiment de mépris en raison d’une absence de valorisation de l’ancienneté. \"Ça fait 39 ans que je travaille à Leroy Merlin et je ne suis qu’à 1 700 € net, rendez-vous compte… C’est le cas de mes collègues aussi. Certains sont à peine au-dessus du SMIC.\"\nA lire aussi :\n[Sécurité sociale à Perpignan : les salariés débrayent pour leurs salaires et un service public de qualité](/2024/11/22/securite-sociale-a-perpignan-les-salaries-debrayent-pour-leurs-salaires-et-un-service-public-de-qualite-12340846.php)\nLes salariés revendiquent une augmentation minimale de 70 € brut par mois, une prime d’ancienneté \"cumulable et indissociable de l’augmentation générale\", l’alignement des fourchettes de rémunération de toutes les filières et de toutes les régions. Mais encore, la réévaluation du titre-restaurant et l’augmentation de la prise en charge de la part de l’employeur sur la mutuelle.\nPar ailleurs, ils réclament la réouverture des négociations sur les accords de temps de travail.

    "text": "In the wake of one major hurricane that rolled through the American Southeast and with a cautious eye on another one approaching, Catholics in an Atlantic coastal community experienced the presence of – as one person put it – Jesus in the storm-tossed fishermen’s boat. Tybee Island is one of Georgia’s barrier islands on the Atlantic, just outside of historic Savannah. It’s a busy place in summer, but in the off months many vacation homes and rentals are empty, leaving a base population of about 3,000. When Hurricane Helene cut a deadly path from the Gulf of Mexico up to the Appalachian Mountains, Savannah and Tybee Island escaped its worst effects. So for people from areas without power or water, it was a good place to take refuge. That turned out to be providential for St. Michael the Archangel , the only Catholic church on Tybee Island. Fr. Brett Brannen, the pastor, had long hoped to awaken his small flock on Tybee to the need to evangelize. To do so, he enlisted the help of an old friend, Mother Olga of the Sacred Heart , a native of Iraq who helped Boston Cardinal Sean O’Malley form a new religious community, the Daughters of Mary of Nazareth . [The slideshow below shows images of their visit.] Fr. Brannen invited Mother Olga and her sisters to visit St. Michael’s to lead a parish mission. “I said, ‘Mother, would you be willing to come and bring all your sisters? I want all of them, because I want to go door to door and knock on every house on Tybee Island and invite people to Jesus,’” Fr. Brannen told Aleteia. Providential timing The only time the community could come as a group was at the end of September. No one knew, when they planned the mission, that it would be a week when Tybee Island’s population swelled with people escaping the wrath of Hurricane Helene. The mission included a nightly Eucharistic Holy Hour in the small wooden church of St. Michael, but Fr. Brannen felt the need also to “get out of the sacristy,” as Pope Francis puts it, and bring the Gospel to the places where people live and work. Going door to door with “Catholic goody bags” that the sisters and parishioners had prepared – with things like a New Testament, prayer card, and holy water -- the sisters and their helpers discovered people going through personal storms of their own. One man said he’d been away from regular Mass attendance because of alcoholism, another because he had suffered abuse in the Church. They and others agreed to attend a healing service at St. Michael’s, and, according to Mother Olga and Fr. Brannen, the experience provided something of a lifeline. Working in small groups and driven around by parishioners, the sisters knocked on about 300 doors, Mother Olga said. Asking people “How can we pray for you?” they collected almost 350 prayer intentions that were typed up and placed on the altar in church. “With every person that we encountered, we heard stories of their storms and the storms of their loved ones,” said Mother Olga, who gave a [witness talk at the National Eucharistic Congress]this summer. As Jesus was in the Apostles’ boat during a storm on the Sea of Galilee , the sisters felt they were able to board that “boat” in a number of different circumstances: people suffering loss, separation, illness, or addiction. “Some of the stories, like one couple, they said some big trees fell on their home and almost split the house into two pieces,” Mother Olga told Aleteia. “They cannot really fix it. It's just all gone. They lost everything. There was another family, who had 50,000 chickens – a family business. They just lost everything.” Eucharistic healing In church, the Blessed Sacrament was exposed in a monstrance on the altar and wrapped with a special cloth. People were invited to come up, kneel before Christ in the Eucharist, and touch the cloth, just as the woman with a hemorrhage had been healed when she touched the garment of the Lord, in Matthew 9:20-22 . Longtime parishioner Betty Jayne Hendrix observed that many people were deeply moved by the experience, placing the cloth on various parts of their body that needed healing and walking away in tears. “We said to our own parishioners, ‘Please go to people you know who are hurting,’” Fr. Brannen said. “‘Invite them, go pick them up, and bring them to this healing service.’ And the church was packed.” He and retired priest Fr. John Lyons offered the Anointing of the Sick , and a visiting priest heard confessions. At the end, there was still a line outside the confessional, so Fr. Brannen and Fr. Lyons stepped in. In total, confessions were heard for four hours. Scenes from a special parish mission At the end of the week, St. Michael’s held an outdoor Mass on the pier, as it does annually to celebrate the Feast of St. Michael. The congregation included more than a few people who had returned to the practice of the faith. “I saw at least five people that I haven't seen in a church or at Mass in five years, 10 years, some even longer,” said Hendrix, who helped schedule the sisters’ visits around town. Fr. Brannen hopes people continue to return, but it might not have happened without the Mission to Tybee Island. “We just have so many stories of people who just needed that little, tiny nudge to say, ‘Hey, we love you. We care about you,’” he said. With the island’s population swelled once again, this time with Floridians escaping the effects of Hurricane Milton, the people of St. Michael’s have a new boldness to share their faith with those in need.",

    "text": "VENICE — Tania Vitvitsky spent months traveling around Ukraine, focusing her camera on the “beautiful” people there rather than the atrocities of war they have faced. Vitvitsky joined Branch 56 of the Ukrainian National Women’s League to present a slideshow about a her recent journey to Ukraine. As president of the Ukrainian Charitable Platform, she wanted to share what she learned. On her journey, she soaked up the culture and resilience of the Ukrainian people. But getting there wasn’t easy. All passenger flights remain restricted due to the ongoing war with Russia, which is nearing its two-year mark. She visited Lviv, a city in the Western side of Ukraine, which she left at 3 years of age. To get there, she had to fly into Warsaw, Poland, and travel via train. Although Lviv is distanced from much of the violence, the impacts of the war are still palpable and “everyone is involved,” Vitvitsky said. She presented a video she took at a park with various people walking around, mingling. In the background, however, an air-raid warning siren blared. The people in the park were not reacting to it. Sirens like the one in the video went off every other day, according to Vitvitsky. Ukraine has seen one-third of its population ousted from their homes, Vitvitsky said. “Imagine if that was here,” Vitvitsky said. “That would be over 100 million people displaced.” Vitvitsky then showed a photo she took of a group of children taking refuge in an underground bunker. “Look at their faces,” she said. “They don’t even look scared, and that’s not a good thing.” Once the sirens turn off, life turns back on and everyday life resumes. Vitvitsky presented various landmarks across the city and the ever-present nightlife that even included live music. Each attraction had numerous Ukrainians going about their lives. Some showed soldiers visiting their families and friends, according to Vitvitsky. “Every single person is affected by the war,” she said, then showing people rummaging together supplies in an effort to help those on the front lines. “But we can’t forget, you need to live, too,” Vitvitsky said.

    "text": "Jan 9 (Reuters) - Nvidia on Thursday criticized a reported plan by the Joe Biden administration to impose new restrictions on AI chip exports, saying that the outgoing U.S. leader should not \"preempt incoming President Trump\" by enacting a last-minute policy.\n\"We would encourage President Biden to not preempt incoming President Trump by enacting a policy that will only harm the U.S. economy, set America back, and play into the hands of U.S. adversaries,\" Nvidia Vice President Ned Finkle said in an emailed statement.\nThe U.S. Commerce Department and the White House did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment outside regular business hours.\nReuters reported exclusive details last month on the Commerce Department's plan for approving global AI chip exports while also preventing bad actors from accessing them. A key aim of the restrictions is to keep AI from supercharging China's military capabilities.\nBloomberg News reported on Thursday that new export regulations could be announced soon, adding that a group of U.S. adversaries would effectively get blocked from importing these chips, while the vast majority of the world would face limits on the total computing power that can go to one country.\nNvidia's Finkle said the reported policy was disguised as an \"anti-China move\" and warned that the extreme country cap will affect computers around the world and push the world to alternative technologies.\n\"This last-minute Biden administration policy would be a legacy that will be criticized by U.S. industry and the global community,\" Finkle said.\nThe Information Technology Industry Council, representing companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Meta , has said the rule would place arbitrary constraints on U.S. companies' ability to sell computing systems overseas and cede the global market to competitors.\nU.S. President-elect Donald Trump, in his first term in office, imposed restrictions on the sale of U.S. technology to China citing national security. Trump's second term begins on Jan. 20.\nNvidia shares were down more than 1% during extended trading on Thursday after the Bloomberg report.\n(Reporting by Devika Nair and Shubham Kalia in Bengaluru and Karen Freifeld in New York; Editing by Mrigank Dhaniwala)\nCatch all the [Business News ](https://www.livemint.com/), [ Corporate news ](https://www.livemint.com/companies), [Breaking News ](https://www.livemint.com/news)Events and [Latest News ](https://www.livemint.com/latest-news) Updates on Live Mint.

    "title": "35 Maoists surrender in Chhattisgarh, embracing democracy and rehabilitation | Raipur News - Times of India",
    "text": "RAIPUR: As many as 35 Maoists, including three individuals with bounties on their heads, have surrendered in Dantewada district of Chhattisgarh under the \\\"Lon Varattu\\\" (Return Home) campaign. This campaign, rooted in the local tribal dialect Gondi, aims to reintegrate misguided individuals into mainstream society.Dantewada SP Gaurav Rai confirmed that the surrendered Maoists have renounced violence and expressed their belief in democracy and the Constitution. These individuals were previously active in the Bhairamgarh, Malanger, and Katekalyan Area Committees, often involved in disruptive activities like road digging, tree cutting, and dissemination of Maoist propaganda during bandhs.Under the leadership of IG Sundarraj P of Bastar Range, DIG Dantewada Range Kamlochan Kashyap, DIG (Ops) CRPF Dantewada Range Vikas Katheria (IPS), SP Dantewada Gaurav Rai, Additional SP Smritika Rajnala, and Additional SP Dantewada Ramkumar Barman (RPS), the district police force and CRPF have been actively implementing the Maoist Eradication Campaign and the Rehabilitation Policy of the Chhattisgarh government.Efforts to publicize the administration's Maoist rehabilitation policy have reached the grassroots level, resulting in a noticeable shift within the Maoist cadre. Frustrated with the inhumane ideology of Naxalism and the exploitation of local tribals, more individuals are choosing to surrender and join the mainstream.Of the 35 surrendered Maoists, 25 were facilitated by DRG Dantewada, 06 by RFT CRPF, and 04 by the 111th Battalion CRPF Dantewada.Both the district police force and CRPF urge other misguided Maoists to abandon violence and embrace peace by contacting the nearest police station or camp. They emphasize the importance of contributing to the region's development and prosperity.As part of the Chhattisgarh government's rehabilitation plan, the surrendered Maoists will receive a reward of Rs 25,000 each from the Dantewada Police Superintendent.This recent surrender brings the total number of individuals embracing the Lon Varattu campaign to 796 Maoists, including 180 with bounties on their heads, marking a significant step towards peace and stability in the region.",
