    "text": "IBM is making Intel Gaudi 3 AI accelerators available on IBM Cloud to help customers scale gen AI workloads and optimize performance for AI inferencing and fine-tuning.\nCredit: Intel IBM Cloud is broadening its AI technology services with Intel Gaudi 3 AI accelerators now available to enterprise customers.\nWith Gaudi 3 accelerators, customers can more cost-effectively test, deploy and scale enterprise AI models and applications, according to IBM, which is said to be the first cloud service provider to adopt Gaudi 3.\nIntel Gaudi 3 accelerators include AI-specific designs and features and are targeted at multi-model large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) development, IBM stated. The accelerators feature matrix math engines, tensor processing cores, high-bandwidth memory, and built-in Ethernet ports for accelerated inferencing of deep neural networks, according to IBM.\n“Enterprises can scale from a single node (eight accelerators) with a throughput of 9.6 TB/s to a 1,024-node cluster (8,192 accelerators) with a throughput of 9.830 PB/s. Scaling is achieved using a choice of numerous industry-standard and high-capacity Ethernet switches and other supporting infrastructure to help lower costs,” IBM stated.\nIntel Gaudi 3 can be deployed through IBM Cloud Virtual Servers for virtual private cloud (VPC) instances. Businesses can pick their compute, storage and networking resources as needed, IBM stated.\nIn addition, the package can be provisioned as a container worker node, and IBM Cloud said it has plans to deliver Intel Gaudi 3 as a worker node for Red Hat OpenShift AI clusters and Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud in early 2025. The Intel Gaudi 3 instance also supports Red Hat Enterprise Linux AI image options.\nFor businesses that need more control over their AI development, IBM says they can deploy IBM watsonx.ai software with the Intel Gaudi 3-based virtual server on IBM Cloud VPC in Q2 2025. IBM watsonx.ai includes an end-to-end AI development studio, AI developer toolkit and full AI lifecycle management for developing AI services and deploying them into customers applications.\n“As AI is increasingly moving from an experimental trend to the backbone of real world applications, IT organizations are challenged with balancing the necessary performance with economic considerations of AI hardware, and doing so at scale,” wrote Mitch Lewis, a performance analyst with Signal65, which offers tech industry testing, performance validation, and data-based consulting.\n“Previous analysis by Signal65 demonstrated that Intel Gaudi 3 accelerators were capable of offering highly competitive performance for AI inferencing workloads, while offering substantial economic advantages. The availability of Gaudi 3 accelerators on IBM Cloud looks to build upon these advantages while providing IT organizations with an easily accessible and scalable cloud-based approach to deploying AI applications,” Lewis wrote in a blog post about the Intel Gaudi 3 AI accelerator implementation on IBM Cloud.\n“This preliminary performance testing conducted by Signal65 found Intel Gaudi 3 to offer highly competitive performance when compared to alternative Nvidia-based offerings on IBM Cloud. Gaudi 3 on IBM Cloud provides a flexible platform capable of achieving high performance across various models and technical configurations,” Lewis wrote. “In addition, the pricing of Gaudi 3 instances on IBM Cloud builds an appealing economic advantage over both Nvidia instance types” – the Nvidia H100 and H200 – that IBM Cloud also supports, Lewis stated.\nRelated content News Nvidia’s Blackwell raises the bar with new MLPerf Inference V5.0 results By Paul Barker Apr 02, 2025 6 mins Artificial Intelligence CPUs and Processors GPUs",

The gusty winds could damage buildings (such as roof shingles and windows), toss loose objects, and topple trees, according to the weather warning.\nHigh winds may also cause power outages and hazardous driving conditions.\nDoyle says another storm system is expected to make its way into the Lower Mainland on Wednesday. However, the timing and details of the event remain uncertain.\nStay up-to-date with hyperlocal forecasts across 50 neighbourhoods in the Lower Mainland with V.I.A.'s Weatherhood.",

    "title": "Copa Libertadores: Afición de Nacional y policía brasileña protagonizan un violento enfrentamiento en las tribunas",
    "text": "La Copa Libertadores ha vuelto a cubrirse con la sombra de la violencia, luego de que el partido de Vuelta de los Octavos de Final entre el Sao Paulo de Brasil y El Nacional de Montevideo viviera un lamentable momento que involucró a los aficionados uruguayos con la policía brasileña. Luego del silbatazo final y cuando los aficionados del Nacional se disponían a abandonar las tribunas del Estadio Morumbi, elementos de la policía irrumpieron para desalojar con violencia a los hinchas que se enfrentaron con la policía. Una de las salidas de la tribuna donde se encontraban los seguidores uruguayos fue bloqueada por la policía brasileña que buscó dispersar a los simpatizantes que arrojaron bengalas. Previamente, durante el arranque del segundo tiempo y luego del gol de Jonathan Calleri al minuto 47, el partido tuvo que interrumpirse por algunos momentos luego de que se registrará una confrontación entre los elementos de la policía y los seguidores de El Nacional. Apenas dos días antes, los seguidores del San Lorenzo de Almagro también habían denunciado represión por parte de la policía de Brasil durante el partido de vuelta de los Octavos de Final en donde se enfrentaron al Atlético Mineiro. El dramatismo no solamente estuvo reservado para las tribunas del Estadio Morumbi, sino que también se vivieron momentos de angustia en pleno partido luego de que el jugador de Nacional, Juan Izquierdo, se desmayara en mitad del terreno de juego. Izquierdo, quien había ingresado para el segundo tiempo, comenzó a tambalearse hasta que se desplomó a mitad del campo, cerca del minuto 90, mientras que uno de sus compañeros solicitaba desesperadamente la asistencia. El jugador uruguayo tuvo que ser retirado de la cancha del Morumbi en una ambulancia que ingresó hasta el terreno de juego para trasladar el futbolista a un hospital. El Sao Paulo consiguió su pase a los Cuartos de Final de la Copa Libertadores tras superar en el global al Nacional por 2-0 y ahora se enfrentará al Botafogo en la siguiente ronda.",

    "title": "Covid WAS ‘clearly’ a Chinese lab leak covered up by Beijing, a British expert says",
    "text": "Covid most likely emerged from a laboratory leak in China and its origins were “clearly” the subject of a cover-up by Beijing, a top British epidemiologist has said.\nProfessor Tim Spector, who co-created the Zoe symptom tracker app and was awarded an OBE for his work during the pandemic response, questioned whether the virus could have been manipulated by scientists before it was allegedly leaked.\n“I don’t think there’s any doubt that this virus originated in China, in a place near Wuhan,” the King’s College London epidemiology professor told the Zoe podcast.\n‘The question is: does this come from bats? Did it come from a lab that worked on this virus and manipulated it to make it grow faster? Or was it a completely artificially generated virus?’\nCovid-19 emerged in Wuhan, central China, with varying theories among scientists as to whether it could have originated from the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) or from a wet market in the region.\nDebate rages over the source of the pandemic, which has claimed seven million lives worldwide and more than 200,000 in Britain.\nThe theory that it was a laboratory leak gained traction after it was shared by the head of the FBI, who stated last year that the origin of the pandemic “is most likely a potential laboratory incident.”\nProfessor Spector said Covid has proven that laboratories around the world need to be more closely monitored and treated with the same seriousness as a nuclear threat, warning that it could “happen again in another laboratory if we are not careful.”\nCovid-19 emerged in Wuhan, central China, with varying theories among scientists as to whether it could have originated from the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) or from a wet market in the region.\nProfessor Tim Spector co-founded the Zoe symptom tracker app and was awarded an OBE for supporting the pandemic response with his work\nHe also emphasized during US congressional hearings that Chinese and US laboratories had worked together to study the contagiousness of coronaviruses and how to “achieve their control or acceleration.”\nHe described a possible cover-up and pointed to “the trail of shredded documents and email exchanges between the US and China at the time.”\nHe added that “there was a clear cover-up very early on by various governments saying we need to put out a report saying this is all due to bats so people won’t blame labs and scientists for that credibility to maintain. .’\n‘I don’t think the idea that someone built a virus from scratch would be very easy. “So I think it’s more likely that it was a mistake than it was something deliberate, but I think these were people working with dangerous viruses that spiraled out of control, rather than it being a conspiracy,” he said. ‘\nThe pandemic government adviser described it as his “personal view,” adding that “there are views on all sides.”\nIn September, a major international study rejected the popular theory and suggested instead that the virus began life in a “wet market” in Wuhan rather than in a scientific experiment.\nResearchers tested genetic samples from animals sold at market stalls in Wuhan in 2019 and found traces of the Covid virus in some species.\nThey claimed to have identified animals that may have been responsible for its transmission to humans.\nIt has also emerged that American and Chinese scientists tried to create a Covid-like virus just a year before the pandemic began\n“This adds another layer to the mounting evidence that all points to the same scenario: that infected animals were introduced into the market in mid-to-late November 2019, triggering the pandemic,” said study author Kristian Andersen from Scripps Research.\nIt has been suggested that the raccoon dog, a fox-like animal common in East Asia, is the main carrier of the virus.\nOther animals, such as masked palm civets, gray bamboo rats and Malayan porcupines, were also found to be carriers of Covid-19 before it spread to humans.\nThis is not a definitive list as many of the key species disappeared from the market before the Chinese health team arrived, said Florence Débarre of the French National Center for Scientific Research, who led the study.\nThe scientists note that many of the early cases in Wuhan, a city of 12 million, were workers from the market.\nHowever, proponents of the laboratory leak theory are supported by the findings of Australian and American researchers who used a risk assessment tool to determine the likelihood that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was of ‘unnatural’ or ‘natural’ origin.\nIt found that Covid was likely to be of ‘unnatural’ origin, although the researchers undermined this by saying the ‘risk assessment cannot prove the origin of (Covid) but shows that the possibility of a laboratory origin cannot be easily are rejected. .’\nIt has also emerged that American and Chinese scientists tried to create a Covid-like virus just a year before the pandemic began.\nData – obtained through Freedom of Information requests in December 2023 – included a plan to “engineer spike proteins” to infect human cells that would then be “inserted into SARS-Covid backbones” at WIV in December 2018.\nThis photo taken on April 15, 2020, shows vendors wearing face masks as they offer shrimp for sale at the Wuhan Baishazhou Market in Wuhan, central China’s Hubei province\nThe proposal was made by the EcoHealth Alliance, a New York-based nonprofit that channels U.S. government subsidies abroad to fund these types of experiments.\nUltimately, the application was rejected by the US Department of Defense, but critics say the plans in the proposal served as a ‘blueprint’ for creating Covid.\nSpeaking about the implications of the research, Australian biosafety expert Dr Raina MacIntyre told Daily Mail Australia: ‘Policically this (study) is important because we have more control over the prevention of unnatural outbreaks, many of which result from simple human error or inadequate biosecurity. .\n‘Poor biosafety procedures at bat sampling and at the Wuhan Institute of Virology were documented, but laboratory accidents are common around the world.’",

    "text": "Women’s Basketball Faces New Mexico State in WNIT Showdown\nThe Pacific women's basketball team is gearing up for its eighth postseason appearance, facing New Mexico State in the opening round of the 2025 Women's National Invitation Tournament (WNIT). The Tigers, with a record of 15-18, previously competed against the Aggies, holding a strong 7-2 record in Stockton during their shared time in the Big West Conference. To secure victory, Pacific will lean on its defensive strengths, particularly in forcing turnovers and blocking shots, as they aim to capitalize on past successes against NMSU.\n- Pacific's defense has forced 651 turnovers this season, ranking in the top 35 nationally.\n- Graduate Liz Smith has 84 steals, while senior Anaya James has 75 steals this season.\n- The team's defensive strategy relies heavily on the backcourt duo of Smith and James.\n- Junior Sydney Ward and sophomore Marina Radocaj have both achieved 30+ blocks this season.\nThe Tigers aim for a strong opening round against New Mexico State, with a focus on leveraging their defensive advantages. A win could set the stage for further success in the tournament, depending on their performance against other teams.\nBottom LinePacific's successful postseason run will hinge on their defensive capabilities and the historical strengths of their roster. As they face New Mexico State, the outcome will likely reflect the team's ability to replicate prior successes against the Aggies.\nRead more at University of the Pacific\nThe summary of the linked article was generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence technology from OpenAI",

    "title": "Amid Conflicting Reports About Pope Francis' Condition, Italian Cardinal Now Says Pontiff May Resign Due to Ill Health | The Gateway Pundit | by Paul Serran",
    "text": "As Pope Francis spent his sixth day in the hospital under treatment for pneumonia in both lungs, the speculations about his real health status are running crazy, with simultaneous reports about Francis being at death’s door, or else felling a bit better and showing some improvement. Now, yet another version of future developments emerges, with former Vatican department chief of cultural affairs, Cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi, mentioning the possibility of a Francis resignation. Ravasi said the Pontiff is ‘decisive’, and that he might step down if his health makes him unable to fulfil his duties. The Telegraph reported: “’I think he could do it because he is a person who is quite decisive in his choices’, said Cardinal Ravasi in an interview with Italian radio network RTL on Thursday.” “’He has always had the tendency to fight and react and that is a legitimate choice too, because he has been able to handle trips in very difficult and challenging conditions, like the one in the Far East’, Cardinal Ravasi said, referring to the Pope’s gruelling 20,000-mile trip last year to Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, East Timor and Singapore. ‘However, there is no question that if he found himself in a situation where he was compromised in his ability to have direct contact – as he loves to do – to be able to communicate in an immediate, incisive and decisive way, then I believe he might consider resigning’.” The Vatican says pontiff spent a restful night in his private suite at the hospital, ‘got out of bed and had his breakfast in an armchair’. The official bulletin states that in this evening he was improving slightly. While the speculation is perhaps unwelcome, Francis was the one who first mentioned the possibility of resignation. “In a wide-ranging interview he did in 2023 to mark 10 years since he became Pope, he said he would step aside if he became too tired or lacked the mental ability to lead the world’s 1.3 billion Catholics. ‘The Pope is a person who, if he thinks that he no longer has the energy to carry the Church forward, would resign’, said the Rev Spadaro, a fellow Jesuit and close advisor to the Pope. ‘Benedict XVI opened up the possibility and Francis has never excluded resigning. But he has also explained that the papacy is customarily [a job] for life’.” Pope Francis Now Has Pneumonia on Both Lungs – As Worries Mount About His Health, Nasty MSM Begins Speculation About His Death",
