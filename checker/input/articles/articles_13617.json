The seven-day holiday focuses on seven principles - unity, self-determination, responsibility, economics, purpose, creativity and faith. \"January 1st, that is the day of faith. Our focus is on what is our relationship with our creator God, and then how do we bring other people to that realization. Kwanzaa means first fruits. It's really a harvest festival,\" said Darnell Byrd McPherson, First Steps Darlington County. You're invited to a family-friendly Kwanzaa celebration this weekend in Darlington County.

ULFA leader Arabinda Rajkhowa, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, and Union Minister Amit Shah were all present during the signing of the memorandum. The ULFA was formed in 1979, originally advocating and fighting for the “restoration of Assam’s sovereignty” or greater state autonomy. However, the death of the militant leader of the United Front in 1991 caused a division of forces in the ULFA. In 2012, the ULFA underwent a formal [split](https://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/states/assam/terrorist_outfits/ulfa.htm), and two factions emerged: the Anti-Talks faction (ULFA-ATF) and the Pro-Talks faction (ULFA-PTF). The ULFA-ATF renamed itself ULFA-Independent (ULFA-I) in 2013, and the ULFA-PTF is in talks with the government. The ULFA was banned by the Indian government in 1990, and there were several violent encounters between the Indian military and the ULFA in the following years. The Chief Minister (CM) of Assam, Himanta Biswa Sarma, [highlighted](https://www.sentinelassam.com/north-east-india-news/assam-news/assam-landmark-peace-accord-signed-with-ulfa-pro-talk-faction-683749) the importance of the memorandum in moving towards more peaceful approaches with other “separatist groups” in the region and “insurgent groups” in the state including the Bodo, Karbi, and Adivasi factions. CM Sarma reassures that the government will be successful in dissolving the organization, surrendering weapons possessed and integrating the 729 members into the “mainstream” through this agreement. However, ULFA-I, led by Paresh Barua, was excluded from the negotiations. Assam’s sovereignty is an issue that the anti-talks ULFA-I continues to press. Members of the party have been involved in violence across the region.",

    "title": "Four-year-old survives 22 hours in California wilderness after walking away from campsite",
    "text": "A four-year-old boy survived nearly an entire day alone in the wilderness after he wandered away from his family while they were at a campsite in central California . Christian Ramirez of Torrance, California, was camping with his family at the Rancheria campground in Lakeshore, about 70 miles outside of Fresno, when his ordeal began, KTLA reported . Christian became separated from his family on Thursday at about 10am local time. His relatives searched him for an hour but were unable to find him, so they called rescue crews, who then launched a frantic search for the boy. With much of the US in the grips of extreme heat recently, Thursday’s high in Lakeshore was 79F (26.1C) – and the low was 40F (4.4C). A crew of more than 50 volunteers and officers searched for Christian for hours, using dogs, an aerial search, and other methods, the California news outlet ABC7 Eyewitness News reported . Christian was then in a wooded area about a quarter-mile from the campsite when, fortunately for him, his family and the search crews, members of the Tulare county search and rescue team found him at about 8am on Friday. Authorities say Christian was hungry and tired when rescuers found him after he had been missing for roughly 22 hours. But he was in good health, according to officials. The four-year-old was wearing only a T-shirt and shorts when he dealt with the overnight low temperatures in the 40s. The forest area is also home to dangerous animals, including bears and snakes. “There’s a lot of things that could have gone really, really wrong with this one, and we got lucky – the family got lucky,” Brandon Pursell of the Fresno county sheriff’s office said to ABC7. “The boy is very, very fortunate to be with his family.” Upon finding Christian, rescuers gave the boy a sandwich and quickly reunited him with his parents. Christian’s successful rescue came only a day after a man was rescued after being lost in the California mountains for more than a week. Lukas McClish, 34, of Boulder Creek, California , sustained himself on creek water and wild berries after he became lost on a hike on 11 June. McClish – who had planned to hike for only a few hours when he became lost – was not found until 20 June after people heard his screams for help. “I felt comfortable the whole time I was out there – I wasn’t worried,” McClish told KSBW in an interview published on Sunday. “I think it was just somebody watching over me.”",

    "text": "WASHINGTON — France, Germany, Britain and the United States on Thursday condemned Iran’s increase in its production rate of highly enriched uranium of up to 60% purity, close to the level used for nuclear weapons fuel.\nIn a joint statement, the allies made no mention of any consequences Iran could face for the production hike but called for its reversal and said they remained \"committed to a diplomatic solution\" to the feud over Tehran's nuclear program.\n\"The production of high-enriched uranium by Iran has no credible civilian justification,\" the statement said. \"These decisions ... represent reckless behavior in a tense regional context.\"\nSince the start of Israel's offensive against Gaza's ruling Hamas militants, Iran-backed proxies have increased their attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and on U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria, sharply increasing tensions in the region.\nIsrael launched its operation in response to Hamas' deadly October 7 rampage into Israel.\nThe U.N. nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA, said in a report on Tuesday that Iran had reversed a monthslong slowdown in the production rate of highly enriched uranium up to 60% purity.\n\"We condemn this action, which adds to the unabated escalation of Iran’s nuclear program,\" the joint statement said.\nIran on Wednesday dismissed the IAEA report as \"nothing new\" and said it was running its program \"according to the rules.\"\nTehran already has enough uranium of 60% purity, if enriched to 90%, to make three nuclear bombs, according to the IAEA's theoretical definition.\nIran has denied seeking nuclear weapons.\nBritain, France and Germany remain parties to the 2015 deal designed to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Former U.S. President Donald Trump reneged on the accord in 2018, after which Iran gradually violated its strictures.",

    "text": "Cory Wharton is happy to welcome the New Year because 2023 started as a very “dark time” in his life.\nThe Teen Mom OG alum shared a reflective post on social media and revealed that one year ago today, his youngest daughter, Maya Grace Wharton, underwent open-heart surgery.\nHe also admitted that the one-year-old isn’t out of the woods just yet, as she’s scheduled for another surgery in a year or so.\nMaya is the third child for Cory, who has another daughter, Mila, with wife Taylor Selfridge, and a six-year-old daughter, Ryder, with Teen Mom: The Next Chapter star, Cheyenne Floyd.\nCory shared the happy news in March of 2022 that Taylor was pregnant with their second child, and in June, they welcomed Maya into the world.\nSeveral days later, Cory and Taylor revealed that\nshe was born with Tricuspid Atresia — a rare form of congenital heart disease — and underwent open heart surgery the first week of her life.\nAt seven months old, Maya underwent her second open-heart surgery but\nsuffered complications and spent some time in the ICU.\nThankfully, the toddler is doing much better today, and her parents are grateful for that.\nCory Wharton’s daughter Maya reaches the one-year milestone of her second open-heart surgery\nLittle Maya has been through a lot since birth, but the tiny red-haired beauty is a fighter.\nHer dad Cory shared a post on Instagram to mark the one-year milestone of the toddler’s second open-heart surgery as he reflected on 2023.\nThe image showed little Maya clad in a red outfit, surrounded by a collage of stunning black and white images from the past year.\n“Today, marks 1 Year from Maya’s Open Heart Surgery ❤️,” wrote Cory. “I learned so much throughout that process.”\nThe 31-year-old stressed the importance of health and revealed that watching the kids in the children’s hospital with a smile on their faces despite their circumstances left a memorable impression.\n“Really made me look into my life and what’s important. I learned that I have a great support system around me, and most importantly, a great partner in this,” reasoned Cory.\nTeen Mom OG alum Cory Wharton reflects on a ‘dark time’ in 2023\nIn his lengthy message, Cory had some words for his youngest daughter, saying “Maya, I know that was a dark time in our lives, but you got through it.”\nHe also revealed that Maya will have to do another heart surgery, and then all should be well.\nBefore ending the post, Cory thanked the CHD (Congenital Heart Defects) community that sent supportive messages and DMs and noted, “It’s a storm that will pass! You will get through it I promise!”\nFor Maya, he added, “Happy Heartiversary ❤️ My Lil redhead, Love you more then you’ll ever know 😘.”\nTeen Mom: The Next Chapter is currently on hiatus.",
