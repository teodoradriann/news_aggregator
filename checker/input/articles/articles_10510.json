    "text": "The [San Francisco Giants](/mlb/team/_/name/sf/san-francisco-giants) placed infielder [Wilmer Flores](http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30627/wilmer-flores) on the 10-day injured list Thursday because of right knee tendonitis. The move was retroactive to Wednesday. In a corresponding move, the Giants recalled infielder David Villar from Triple-A Sacramento. \"He's a good hitter,\" Giants manager Bob Melvin said of Villar. \"He fits into this group. This will be a better opportunity for him here. He'll play the Wilmer role as far as facing lefties.\" Flores, 32, last played Tuesday. He had missed nine games with the same injury in late June and early July. \"Never really cleared up,\" Melvin said. \"When you're not playing as much and not swinging how you're used to, you're putting in a lot of extra work, and it's not allowing it to really heal.\" Flores is batting .206 with four home runs and 26 RBIs in 71 games this season. For his 12-year career, Flores is batting .260 with 153 homers and 532 RBIs in 1,212 games for the [New York Mets](/mlb/team/_/name/nym/new-york-mets) (2013-18), [Arizona Diamondbacks](/mlb/team/_/name/ari/arizona-diamondbacks) (2019) and Giants. Villar, 27, is 5-for-17 (.294) with one homer and four RBIs in six games with San Francisco. In parts of three seasons since 2022, he is batting .199 with 15 home runs and 40 RBIs in 104 games.",

    "text": "Depuis au moins une centaine de millions d’années, des créatures à l’allure cauchemardesque se développent dans les intestins de nombreuses espèces animales, et il s’avère qu’elles peuvent atteindre des tailles prodigieuses.\nTénias géants\nAvec une longueur pouvant dépasser 40 mètres, le ténia géant Tetragonoporus calyptocephalus, qui prospère dans les entrailles des baleines, fait sans doute partie des parasites intestinaux les plus impressionnants connus.\nInitialement d’une taille très réduite, il se fixe aux parois du tube digestif des cétacés grâce à sa tête munie d’« organes de fixation », appelée scolex. Profitant des nutriments de son hôte, le ver va progressivement développer de nouveaux segments. Connus sous le nom de proglottis, ils comportent à la fois un appareil génital hermaphrodite et un appareil excréteur. On estime que les spécimens les plus imposants en possèdent jusqu’à 45 000.\nProvenant généralement de viande ou de poisson insuffisamment cuits, les ténias qui infectent l’Homme (jusqu’à ses tissus cérébraux) se distinguent également par leur taille.\nLe musée parasitologique de Meguro, à Tokyo, est connu pour abriter un spécimen de Dibothriocephalus nihonkaiensis de 8,8 mètres de long, retiré intact d’un intestin humain. Selon une étude publiée en 2009.), ces vers parasites peuvent mesurer, dans les cas les plus extrêmes, jusqu’à 25 mètres.\nParasites anciens\nDébut 2024, l’identification d’un tentacule de ténia dans un morceau d’ambre vieux de 99 millions d’années avait révélé que de tels parasites intestinaux sévissaient déjà au milieu du Crétacé. Avant cela, les exemples les plus précoces confirmés se résumaient à des oeufs découverts dans des excréments de requin fossilisés datant du Permien.\nSelon les chercheurs, ce nombre remarquablement faible de témoignages fossiles s’expliquerait en grande partie par la structure corporelle des vers (constituée de tissus mous) et leur mode de vie endoparasite.\nPour aller plus loin, découvrez 10 des parasites humains les plus redoutables jamais décrits.\nPar Yann Contegat, le\nSource: IFL Science\nÉtiquettes: parasite, https://dailygeekshow.com/tag/ver/, https://dailygeekshow.com/tag/tenia/\nCatégories: Sciences, Actualités",

    "text": "A teenage boy killed in a shark attack off the coast of South Australia has been remembered as a talented and dearly loved member of the surfing community.\nThe 15-year-old, identified by friends and a family member as Khai Cowley, was mauled by a suspected great white while surfing off the remote Ethel beach on the Yorke Peninsula west of Adelaide about 1.30pm on Thursday.\nEmergency services rushed to the popular surfing spot in Innes national park but were unable to save the boy, who was from Maslin Beach in Adelaide’s south, police said.\nSurfing SA paid tribute to the talented surfer on Thursday night. “We are devastated to learn that a young, talented and dearly loved member of our surfing community was the surfer involved in the attack at Ethel Beach, and are absolutely shattered to hear that the incident was fatal,” it said. “Our utmost deepest sympathies are with his family.”\nSouth Australia imposes snap ban on school beach trips after multiple shark attacks\nRead more The surf club MicroGroms Junior Boardriders said the teenager would be missed and sent “love and support to his family”. “It is with immense sadness that Microgroms Junior Surf Club remember Khai after his devastating passing,” it said on social media.\n“Khai was a member since 2016 and will be remembered as a good friend and talented surfer who was well respected and admired by all that knew him.”\nAn undated image of Khai Cowley surfing. Photograph: SUPPLIED/AAP Ryan Valente, a local skipper with Reef Encounters who knows the Marion Bay region well, said it was unusual to see great whites in the area and he could not recall any similar encounters.\n“It’s stuff nightmares are made of,” he told ABC Radio on Friday. “Yesterday itself, conditions-wise, was a very grim day: lightning, strong winds and it was quite a dark day. The town’s in a bit of shock, I guess. Our hearts go out to the family.”\nAndrew Fox, a researcher at the Rodney Fox Shark Museum, said great whites were ambush predators and murky conditions on Thursday may have increased their activity.\n“They’re more motivated – bigger swell, dirty water,” he told ABC Radio. “Anything that increases the chances of an ambush predator.”\nThe death rounds out a horror year for beachgoers in the state, with three people killed by sharks and two othes injured.\nIn May a teacher, Simon Baccanello, 46, died in a suspected shark attack while surfing at Walkers Rock beach, about 365km west of Adelaide, before 55-year-old Tod Gendle was killed while surfing at Granites beach on the state’s west coast in October. Neither of their bodies were recovered.\nProf Charlie Huveneers, a shark expert at Flinders University, said the number of bites had risen globally over the past four decades, but they still occurred infrequently.\nHuman population growth, habitat destruction, declining water quality, climate change and the changing distribution of sharks and their prey were all likely contributors.\nHuveneers said there were three main ways to mitigate shark attacks and serious injuries, including reducing the overlap of sharks and humans by establishing swimming enclosures or aerial surveillance, the use of personal electrical deterrents, and the use of bite-resistant wetsuits.\nThe South Australian premier, Peter Malinauskas, said his thoughts were with Khai’s family.\n“I can’t think of anything more horrific, particularly at this time of year,” he told Channel 9.\nMalinauskas said the government was looking at a range of deterrents but the remoteness of South Australian beaches made it a difficult task.\n“We’ve got a coastline in South Australia that’s basically the equivalent of NSW and Victoria combined,” he said.\n“It’s impossible to net the entire area.\n“But we’ve seen 11 fatal shark attacks in South Australia since the year 2000, so the fact we’ve seen three across this summer is startling and it is of concern.”\nExplore more on these topics Sharks South Australia Animals Marine life Surfing news\nReuse this content",

La enorme mayoría son otro tipo de daños”.",

    "title": "La coopération entre le Maroc et l'Espagne réduit la migration irrégulière",
    "text": "La coopération entre le Maroc et l’Espagne, portée par une série de réformes diplomatiques et sécuritaires, s’illustre par une avancée majeure dans la lutte contre l’immigration irrégulière. Dans une récente déclaration, le ministre espagnol de l’Intérieur, Fernando Grande-Marlaska, a souligné l’efficacité de la coopération entre l’Espagne et les pays africains, y compris le Maroc. Fernando Grande-Marlaska, a récemment mis en lumière cette collaboration fructueuse qui, en 2023, a permis de contrecarrer plus de 27 000 tentatives de migration vers l’Espagne. Cette action préventive représente environ 40 % des départs irréguliers, témoignant de l’engagement conjoint dans la protection des frontières et des droits humains. Dans cette lutte contre l’immigration irrégulière, le partenariat stratégique entre le Maroc et l’Espagne se distingue comme un modèle de coopération internationale. Fortifiée par la reprise des relations diplomatiques, cette alliance a permis d’atteindre des résultats notables : une réduction significative de près de 50% des flux migratoires irréguliers vers l’Espagne dès le premier trimestre de 2023, en comparaison avec la même période de l’année précédente. Ces interventions sont considérées comme des mesures vitales non seulement pour la sécurité frontalière, mais aussi pour la préservation des vies humaines en prévenant les traversées maritimes périlleuses. En parallèle, l’Espagne continue de faire face à l’arrivée de migrants sur ses côtes, notamment sur les îles Canaries, où un nombre record d’arrivées a été enregistré fin 2023. Les premiers jours de janvier ont vu l’arrivée de 381 migrants, sauvés en mer et amenés sur l’archipel, avec des interventions de sauvetage nécessitant des soins médicaux pour certains. En 2023, il y a eu une réduction de 51 % des arrivées maritimes au premier trimestre par rapport à la même période de l’année précédente. Cette réduction a continué la tendance à la baisse observée les années précédentes, avec une chute de 25,6 % des entrées illégales en Espagne de 2021 à 2022. L’efficacité de la coopération maroco-espagnole a été un facteur déterminant dans l’approche de la question des arrivées irrégulières. Cette collaboration entre les deux Royaumes se traduit par une diminution notable des arrivées, avec 56 852 personnes ayant atteint l’Espagne l’année dernière, une augmentation certes, mais qui aurait pu être plus importante sans ces mesures. Le partenariat avec le Maroc, en particulier, s’avère être un pilier dans cette réussite, avec des opérations ciblées contre les réseaux criminels impliqués dans le trafic de migrants. Le Maroc, en sa qualité de pays de transit, déploie des efforts considérables pour endiguer ce phénomène qui touche l’Espagne et, au-delà, l’Europe entière. Ces efforts s’inscrivent dans un contexte dans lequel le Royaume s’affirme non seulement comme un gardien des portes de l’Europe, mais aussi comme un acteur proactif dans la sécurisation des routes migratoires. Cette dynamique bénéficie du soutien financier de l’Espagne et de l’Union européenne, cette dernière ayant promis au Maroc une aide substantielle pour couvrir les dépenses opérationnelles liées à la surveillance et au contrôle des flux migratoires. Ces efforts conjoints entre le Maroc et l’Espagne ont permis de sauver des vies et de minimiser les voyages périlleux vers l’Europe. Aujourd’hui, les relations maroco-espagnoles, à l’apogée de leur collaboration, démontrent la volonté mutuelle d’enrichir et de pérenniser leur partenariat. Le Maroc participe activement à des initiatives de sécurité régionale, notamment l’opération « Active Endeavour » de l’OTAN et l’exercice maritime « Seaboard » dans le cadre de l’initiative 5+5 en Méditerranée occidentale. Les résultats de cette coopération se mesurent non seulement en termes de chiffres, mais aussi en vies humaines épargnées, évitant ainsi les périls d’un voyage souvent dangereux vers l’Europe. L’approche adoptée entre les deux pays va au-delà de la simple répression, mettant l’accent sur la prévention et le démantèlement des réseaux de traite, avec un impact direct sur la baisse des chiffres de l’immigration irrégulière. Les relations maroco-espagnoles, aujourd’hui au sommet de leur collaboration, témoignent de la volonté partagée d’enrichir continuellement leur partenariat. Le Maroc, par le biais de ses Forces Armées Royales (FAR), participe activement à des initiatives de sécurité régionale, telles que l’opération « Active Endeavour » de l’OTAN, et l’exercice maritime « Seaboard » dans le cadre de l’initiative 5+5 en Méditerranée occidentale. La réduction des arrivées irrégulières est une illustration tangible de l’efficacité de cette coopération. Toutefois, le défi reste entier, avec une vigilance constante requise pour maintenir ces résultats et poursuivre les efforts dans un contexte migratoire mondial en constante évolution. Cette collaboration est destinée à se renforcer davantage, avec la finalisation prochaine d’accords couvrant la sécurité, l’économie, l’industrie et la lutte continue contre l’immigration irrégulière, signifiant un engagement continu des deux nations pour relever ces défis ensemble. Le Maroc et l’Espagne s’engagent ainsi à perpétuer et à enrichir leurs relations d’excellence, en restant des partenaires incontournables dans la sécurisation de la région méditerranéenne et dans la promotion d’une gestion migratoire responsable et durable. Du tout bon dans ce cadre, des prochaines Réunions de Haut Niveau (RHN) pour finaliser de nouveaux accords bilatéraux et consolider les acquis de ces dernières années.",

[José Alejandro Mendoza](https://www.mundodeportivo.com/alfabeta/author/jose-alejandro-mendoza)en [Series](https://www.mundodeportivo.com/alfabeta/series) Para nadie es un secreto que tanto One Piece como Bleach son dos de las obras más aclamadas y exitosas de todos los tiempos, ya que ambas historias formaron parte del “Gran Trio del Shonen” junto a Naruto, convirtiéndose en las series que lograron marcar un antes y un después en la industria manga/anime, causando un gran impacto que, a día de hoy, sigue muy vigente. Asimismo, Eiichiro Oda y Tite Kubo han deslumbrado a los fans con sus fascinantes historias y su gran talento para relatar estas distintivas tramas que han logrado trascender a través del tiempo, pues tanto One Piece como Bleach siguen siendo obras muy destacadas a tal punto que ambas han causado mucha nostalgia a los fans al estar en emisión al mismo tiempo, haciéndolos rememorar los viejos tiempos. Pero esto no es todo, ya que, como muestra de respeto, Tite Kubo realizó una ilustración de Monkey D. Luffy muy genial y tiempo después, Eiichiro Oda le devolvió el cumplido al dibujar a Ichigo Kurosaki para celebrar el regreso del anime de Bleach: TYBW, teniendo resultados sumamente increíbles. Monkey D. Luffy e Ichigo Kurosaki cobran vida a través de estas grandiosas ilustraciones [One Piece tras más de 1.000 capítulos en su haber](https://www.mundodeportivo.com/alfabeta/one-piece/temporadas-one-piece-capitulos) se ha consagrado como una de las obras más respetadas e influyentes de todos los tiempos, pues las trepidantes aventuras de Luffy han logrado cautivar a millones de fans a nivel mundial, y el 2023 ha sido un claro ejemplo de ello, ya que este ha sido uno de los años más exitosos de la franquicia de Oda. Por otro lado, Bleach también se ha ganado su lugar en el podio durante décadas, ya que la grandiosa obra de Tite Kubo ha tenido un éxito sin precedentes con la nueva temporada de [Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War, la cual adaptará en 2024 la parte 3 de este controvertido arco](https://www.mundodeportivo.com/alfabeta/series/bleach-thousand-year-blood-war-revela-un-nuevo-trailer-de-su-parte-3) que ha dejado batallas y momentos memorables que han engrandecido la historia de Ichigo Kurosaki. Debido al gran éxito que han tenido ambas franquicias este año, el usuario llamado [@sandman_AP](https://twitter.com/sandman_AP) a través de X, ha hecho resurgir dos geniales ilustraciones realizadas por ambos mangakas en el pasado, en las cuales se puede apreciar que Tite Kubo dibujó a Luffy y Eiichiro Oda ilustró a Ichigo Kurosaki, demostrando el respeto que existe entre estos artistas. Oda drew Ichigo (Bleach) in 2021, and Kubo drew Luffy in 2007. I hope Oda and Kubo will have an interview some day.😍— sandman (@sandman_AP) [pic.twitter.com/EPKHsFKiXG] [December 27, 2023] En la primera imagen se puede apreciar la ilustración que realizó Eiichiro Oda de Ichigo en el año 2021 para conmemorar el regreso del anime Bleach:TYBW y en la otra se muestra el dibujo que realizó Tite Kubo de Luffy en el año 2007, siendo estos bocetos grandes homenajes que han incluido el toque distintivo de cada mangaka, haciendo de estas ilustraciones más icónicas e importantes. Evidentemente, en el dibujo que Oda realizó de Ichigo se pueden apreciar los rasgos y diseños que el mangaka suele utilizar para crear a sus personajes, y en la ilustración de Kubo también se ha podido admirar el reconocido estilo de dibujo de este artista, puesto que la cara de Luffy tiene mucha semejanza a algunos de los personajes que se pueden ver en Bleach. Cabe destacar que este ha sido un detalle sumamente interesante que engrandece la historia y el legado de One Piece y Bleach, pues ambos mangakas se han dado muestras de respeto a través de estos geniales homenajes que capturan la esencia de estos artistas de manera sublime. Es necesario resaltar que muchos fans de ambas IP han realizado algunos [crossovers de Bleach y One Piece](https://www.mundodeportivo.com/alfabeta/one-piece/one-piece-y-bleach-se-unen-en-uno-de-los-mejores-crossover-que-veras-nunca) de manera épica, pues le han dado rienda suelta a su imaginación para unir a los personajes en una sola misma historia, teniendo resultados muy asombrosos.",
