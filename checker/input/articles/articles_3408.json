    "title": "How to Keep Your Digital Marketing Assets Secure?",
    "text": "Digital marketing assets are valuable to the success of your online business. These assets may include websites, social media accounts, intellectual property, and more. So, you need to beef up your security protocols to deal with ever-evolving cyber crimes.\nThe security of SaaS companies, marketers, and entrepreneurs is always at risk. Those threats often lead to compromised data integrity. However, financial losses and a tainted brand reputation are important concerns, too. Here’s how you can mitigate these risks and secure your assets.\nUse Reliable Marketing Software and Tools\nReliable marketing tools like SEO software can serve as an additional line of defence when trying to keep digital assets secure. Of course, you need a more robust security plan with dedicated security software and additional layers, like backups, strong passwords, and employee training.\nNevertheless, a well-rounded SEO software, one that you pick after reading SEO tool reviews on\nhttps://top10seosoftware.com/reviews/ and conducting your research, can help identify potential threats.\nHere’s how a solid SEO tool can help in this regard:\n- It can help identify issues such as injected content and suspicious redirects.\n- It ensures improved organization through cataloging features, and also revealing unauthorized access attempts.\n- It helps identify and fix broken links. This deters attackers from exploiting these potential security vulnerabilities.\n- It may inform you about any modifications to your website content. It sometimes indicates a security breach.\nEnsure Secure Email Communication\nBusinesses always share sensitive information via email. It could be in the form of financial records, customer data, or proprietary strategies. Hackers can intercept these messages. And they can even gain complete control of your email account. So, it is crucial to use authentication and encryption techniques. Here are some steps to avoid that.\nUse Encrypted Email Services\nAlways use a reliable\nRemember not to choose an email service at random. Pick a service that is easy to use. It should have high encryption strength. And, of course, it should comply with data protection regulations. A bonus tip is to pick a service that is compatible with your current email client to avoid problems.\nEducate Team Members to Identify Phishing Attacks\nCybercriminals have always used phishing attacks to their advantage. But they now rely on many other techniques to fly under the radar. For instance, they often use techniques like waterhole attacks and wireless access points. But, you may also become a victim of a bait and switch, brute forcing, and clickjacking.\nSo, you should work on raising awareness to ensure your team members don’t fall prey to those tactics.\nHere are some best practices to follow:\n- Train employees to spot phishing red flags. Don’t ignore urgent requests for sensitive information, suspicious sender addresses, and weird language.\n- Run simulated phishing drills to ensure employees are aware of the risk.\n- Ask employees to report suspicious emails immediately. This helps security or the IT team to conduct further investigation.\nProtect Websites and Social Media Accounts\nSaaS companies and\nImplement Multi-Factor Authentication\nMulti-factor authentication (MFA) involves setting up a system with extra verification procedures. The system may include a fingerprint scan, a code sent to your mobile, or even a physical security key.\nThese authentication methods make it harder for cybercriminals to access your account. This is true even if they manage to crack your password using brute-force attacks or another method.\nUpdate Your Passwords Regularly\nChanging your passwords regularly is an important step to keeping your account secure.\nIn most cases, you should update your password at least every 90 days. This helps if someone has gained access to your password without your knowledge. If you change it, you may be able to stop a hacker from having prolonged access to your accounts.\nJust don’t let your guard down after updating your password. Be proactive and keep looking for any suspicious account activity to react promptly.\nSecure Data Storage and Backup Solutions\nGoing with secure data storage solutions is also important for protecting digital assets. Proper storage solutions will prevent unauthorized access to campaign strategies, intellectual property, and anything that contains sensitive information.\nUtilize Encrypted Cloud Storage\nUsing cloud storage can help protect marketing data. It works because these solutions are encrypted. They also work under data privacy regulations, including the CCPA and the GDPR.\nIt also makes sense to use encrypted cloud storage for intellectual property. This is especially true for marketing strategies and creative assets. With this option, your team can collaborate securely with remote access to the assets.\nImplement Regular Backups and Disaster Recovery Plans\nNo matter what you do, data loss risks are always present. To mitigate those risks, regular backups are essential. These procedures protect against issues like:\nIf you notice any attacks, it’s easier to restore those assets you’ve backed up already to minimize potential revenue loss. But, having a comprehensive disaster recovery plan is just as important. The plan should include:\n- Communication protocols to ensure all stakeholders and relevant authorities are onboard.\n- Data restoration procedures to prioritize critical digital assets and restore systematically.\n- Role assignments to identify incident response team lead, data recovery specialists, and legal advisors.\nConduct Regular Security Audits\nRegular security audits are important for safeguarding digital marketing assets. Here’s why you should audit your sites regularly.\nComprehensive Security Audits\nUsing some good security software is usually enough to help you\nconduct regular audits. Comprehensive security audits are essential for many reasons. For instance:\nSEO tools can also be helpful. They crawl websites and analyze various technical factors. During this crawling process, they may detect issues like injected spam content. But, it may show cloaking, redirects to malicious sites, or other suspicious activities.\nUsing a well-rounded security software works better when conducting an audit. The audit identifies digital marketing vulnerabilities (e.g., outdated\nsoftware, weak access controls) to prevent cyber threats. They may also help identify risks to creative assets (e.g., logos, graphics) in marketing campaigns, enabling protective measures.\nIdentify Vulnerabilities and Implement Security Patches\nWith regular audits, you can detect vulnerabilities early. And you can often manage things with timely patching of security loopholes. This usually involves adjusting settings, updating software, and doubling up on security controls.\nPartner with Trusted Service Providers\nIt’s important to look for a trusted service provider. It offers some peace of mind while trying to protect sensitive information.\nSelect Digital Agencies with Robust Security Protocols\nYou need to pay attention to several things before choosing a digital agency. For instance:\n|Aspect||Description|\n|Reputation and Certifications||Choose providers with strong reputations and industry certifications. Pay attention to ISO 27001 or SOC 2 compliance. Ensure they deliver secure services and follow best practices.|\n|Security Policies and Procedures||Check for documented security policies. Learn about encryption, access controls, incident response, and regular audits.|\n|Employee Training and Awareness||Focus on providers who train their staff in security best practices. This is crucial because it reduces the risk of human error.|\n|Secure Infrastructure and Tech||Evaluate providers’ infrastructure for secure hosting, encrypted data transmission, and regular updates to prevent vulnerabilities.|\nEnsure Contractual Agreements Include Provisions for Data Protection\nAlways pay attention to contractual agreements and what they include. There should be clauses highlighting the responsibilities of providers for data protection.\nThose agreements should also follow relevant regulations depending on the data type. They should allow you to audit and track a provider’s security practices. This may help avoid serious issues in the future.\nMonitoring and Response Procedures\nWhen you’ve taken all the steps, it’s vital to keep monitoring your assets. And it’s just as vital to have response procedures in place.\nEstablish Protocols to Deal with Security Incidents\nContinuous monitoring is vital. It’s true for databases, websites, and even third-party integrations. Being proactive pays off in the long run, so be prepared to invest in the right tools and software solutions.\nAlso, you should define protocols for identifying and reporting potential security incidents. Sometimes, you can do it with intrusion detection and prevention systems. But you may also have to rely on some security information and event management (SIEM) tools.\nWork on Incident Response Plans\nTo avoid potential losses, you should create and put in place an incident response plan. The plan should explain the steps necessary for dealing with a security breach. It should identify the incident immediately. But, it should also share details about containing, eradicating, and recovering after it.\nConclusion\nDigital asset protection is an ongoing battle, and you need to be ready to put your best foot forward. Ensure you use the right software solutions. Also, invest in team training to be prepared in advance. And work on incident response plans to mitigate the damage if something goes wrong. Also, never ignore the importance of regular monitoring. And for that, auditing your assets is essential. It helps identify loopholes that need to be patched immediately. That’s the only way to deal with the situation.",

    "text": "- By [Imran Zafar](https://english.jagran.com/authors/imran-zafar) - Published: Fri, 29 Dec 2023 03:25 PM (IST) - Source:JND Sunehri Masjid Demolition: The New Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC) sought public opinion on its proposed demolition of the Sunehri Bagh Masjid, which is located near the Parliament. In a notice issued on Sunday, the civic body officials invited citizen’s objections and suggestions on the matter by January 1. The NDMC stated that the mosque is leading to traffic congestion and removing the same will help in traffic management in the area. The NDMC received hundreds of suggestions from Sunday on the email ID, chief.architect@ndmc.gov.in, requesting the civic body to not demolish the historical structure. Most of the emails received were from Muslim organisations and minority welfare bodies, news agency PTI reported. NDMC chairman Amit Yadav answered a question about the possible demolition of the mosque at the budget press conference. \"We have sought public feedback on the Sunehri Masjid. We had got a request from the Delhi Traffic Police on traffic snarls being reported around the area. We had started the process and sought comments from various stakeholders. We had also approached the religious committee but the Delhi Waqf Board went to the court over the matter,\" he said. Amit Yadav said that NDMC has requested public opinion on the issue and following the proper procedure. The public opinion will be reviewed and the heritage committee will also consider it. Historical Importance Of Sunehri Masjid Sunehri Masjid is located in a green circle where six roads meet in Lutyens’ Delhi. Next to it are the IAF headquarters and Udyog Bhawan. The mosque dates back to pre-independent India and is listed as a Grade-III Heritage building as per a 2009 notification of the government. It is more than 150 years old and was built during the Mughal era by Roshan-ud-Daula, a nobleman. The mosque has a historical and cultural significance, as it was one of the places of worship that the British agreed to spare when they acquired the land around Delhi in 1911. The Sunheri Masjid also hosted freedom fighters like Maulana Hasrat Mohani, who coined the slogan \"Inquilab Zindabad'' and moved the resolution for complete independence from the British in 1921. Meanwhile, the Delhi Waqf Board claims ownership of the land on which the mosque is built and challenged the NDMC’s notification in the Delhi High Court. The imam of the mosque, Abdul Aziz, has denied that the mosque causes traffic congestion and has submitted evidence to the NDMC.

The NDMC’s notification about the demolition also raised criticism from the political sphere where several Muslim MPs raised concerns about the decision. Lok Sabha MP Asaduddin Owaisi also wrote to the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC)’s chief architect opposing the proposal to remove Sunehri Bagh's Sunehri Masjid from the list of heritage buildings by the national capital's civic body. \"It is not only unfortunate but astounding that the Council thinks that a mosque that has been functioning for the past 200 years is an \"obstruction.\" It is also unfortunate that the Council has ignored its duty to conserve the heritage and beauty of the capital city,\" Owaisi said.

The proposal must be withdrawn immediately [pic.twitter.com/rhJ02JGHor] [December 28, 2023] Lok Sabha MP from Amroha Danish Ali also raised objections to the proposed removal of the Sunehri Bagh Masjid in the national capital, saying the mosque has historical and archaeological importance.

    "title": "Des Fondations et OBNL lancent un appel à l'aide face aux impacts de la grève chez Postes Canada",
    "text": "MONTRÉAL , le 29 nov. 2024 /CNW/ - La prolongation de la grève nationale chez Postes Canada engendre des répercussions importantes sur les organismes sans but lucratif (OBNL) et fondations, qui soutiennent des citoyennes et citoyens parmi les plus vulnérables de la société. En raison des retards dans les dons et des perturbations liées à ce conflit, quatre grandes organisations unissent leurs voix pour sensibiliser le public et les décideurs politiques.\nCes organisations incluent : Les Petits Frères, La Fondation des jeunes de la DPJ, La Fondation pour l'alphabétisation et Marie-Vincent. Ce matin, une lettre conjointe a été transmise aux cabinets du ministre du Travail et des Aînés, Steven MacKinnon , et du ministre des Services publics et de l'Approvisionnement, Jean-Yves Duclos , ainsi qu'aux principaux chefs de l'opposition.\nPar cette initiative, les organismes visent à interpeller les représentants gouvernementaux et élus, renforcer la reconnaissance du rôle crucial des OBNL et encourager une collaboration multipartite pour protéger les services essentiels aux populations vulnérables.\nDes impacts immédiats et préoccupants\nÀ l'approche des Fêtes, une période critique pour les campagnes de financement, les organismes constatent une baisse significative de leurs revenus. Les organismes estiment que les pertes financières liées à la grève pourraient atteindre plusieurs centaines de milliers de dollars, compromettant gravement leur capacité à maintenir leurs services essentiels en 2025.\nLes conséquences directes de la grève incluent :\nDes retards dans la réception des dons par chèques; Des perturbations dans les campagnes de sollicitation par publipostage; Des retards dans la livraison des objets achetés en soutien aux organismes; Une diminution générale des contributions, particulièrement cruciales en cette période de l'année. Faits saillants sur la générosité des Québécois et Canadiens\nPlus de 30 % des dons annuels effectués par les Canadiens se concentrent durant les Fêtes, une période vitale pour les campagnes des OBNL (source : Association des professionnels en philanthropie (AFP)). Malgré la montée en popularité des dons en ligne, les méthodes traditionnelles, comme les chèques et les campagnes par courrier, restent des canaux essentiels pour de nombreuses organisations (source : Imagine Canada). Une part significative des donateurs au Canada donne en réponse à des campagnes annuelles ou des sollicitations ciblées par courrier. Par ailleurs, plus de 5 % des dons annuels sont effectués la seule journée du 31 décembre, soulignant l'importance des appels de fin d'année (sources : AFP et Statistique Canada). Ces données soulignent l'importance de cette période de l'année pour les campagnes de financement des OBNL, ainsi que le rôle central des méthodes traditionnelles comme les dons par chèques et les sollicitations par courrier. Ces approches restent cruciales pour les donateurs plus âgés. Elles révèlent également l'importance du service postal pour les organismes , un pilier indispensable pour garantir une part essentielle de leurs revenus et poursuivre leurs missions.\nComment contribuer malgré les défis actuels\nRésilients et mobilisés pour repenser leurs façons de faire, les organismes appellent à une action collective en sollicitant le soutien des entreprises et des citoyens. Voici comment chacun peut contribuer :\nFaire des dons en ligne via les sites web sécurisés des organismes; Appeler les services aux donateurs pour effectuer une transaction par téléphone; Si un bureau physique existe , se rendre sur place pour déposer un don en personne. Citations des dirigeants\n« Les personnes aînées comptent sur nous pour briser leur isolement et leur solitude. Avec des revenus en baisse durant cette période cruciale, notre mission est compromise. Nous devons agir maintenant. » - Catherine Harel Bourdon , présidente-directrice générale, Les Petits Frères\n« Les jeunes que nous aidons sont parmi les plus vulnérables. L'impasse de la grève met en péril notre capacité d'augmenter notre soutien pour leur offrir un avenir meilleur. » - Fabienne Audette , présidente-directrice générale, Fondation des jeunes de la DPJ\n« Les campagnes de dons de fin d'année mobilisent des milliers de Québécois, soutenant les enfants et les adultes dans l'acquisition et le maintien de leurs capacités à lire et à apprendre. » - Caroline Varin , directrice générale, Fondation pour l'alphabétisation\n« Les dons nous permettent de maintenir l'accessibilité à nos services et de garantir la réalisation de notre mission. Toute diminution a un impact réel et direct sur les jeunes victimes que nous soutenons. » - Stéphanie Gareau , directrice générale, Marie-Vincent\nDisponibilité pour entrevues\nLes dirigeantes des quatre organisations sont disponibles pour des entrevues afin de discuter des répercussions de la grève et des solutions proposées. Pour toute demande, veuillez contacter :\nJustin Meloche , directeur, relations médias, NATIONAL Tél. : (514) 995-9704 / Courriel : [email protected]\nÀ propos des organismes\nLes Petits Frères\nDepuis 1962, Les Petits Frères ont pour mission de briser l'isolement des personnes seules du grand âge en créant autour d'elles une famille engagée et fidèle. En action dans 12 régions du Québec, l'organisme est le seul à accompagner les personnes aînées jusqu'à la fin de leur vie, peu importe leur condition. Âgés en moyenne de 85 ans, ces « Grandes Amies » et « Grands Amis », comme les surnomment affectueusement les bénévoles, bénéficient d'un réseau de soutien pendant une moyenne de quatre ans, mais parfois jusqu'à plus de dix ans. petitsfreres.ca\nFondation des jeunes de la DPJ\nLa Fondation des jeunes de la DPJ a pour mission de transformer la vision qu'un jeune de la DPJ a de son avenir en lui donnant le courage et la confiance de croire au champ des possibles. Depuis 1998, la Fondation soutient les jeunes de la DPJ en offrant une aide qui vient compléter celle de l'État et qui permet de répondre rapidement à des besoins précis et personnalisés. Bien ancrée à Montréal, elle appuie les jeunes de la métropole, tout en déployant son impact partout au Québec en collaboration avec les acteurs régionaux. fondationjeunesdpj.ca\nFondation pour l'alphabétisation\nFondée en 1989, la Fondation pour l'alphabétisation est un organisme caritatif qui a pour mission de soutenir les enfants et les adultes dans le développement et le maintien de leur capacité à lire et à apprendre, pour favoriser leur bien-être et leur pleine participation à la société. fondationalphabetisation.org\nMarie-Vincent\nMarie-Vincent soutient les enfants et les adolescentes et adolescents victimes de violence sexuelle en leur offrant, sous un même toit et en collaboration avec ses partenaires, les services dont elles et ils ont besoin. Nous contribuons à prévenir la violence en misant sur l'éducation et la sensibilisation, et en aidant les enfants présentant des comportements sexuels problématiques. marie-vincent.org\nSOURCE Les Petits Frères",

    "text": "NEW DELHI: The weather department has sounded a red alert for very dense fog on Friday and experts have requested people not to venture out in their vehicles between 4 am and 10 am, unless it is unavoidable.When fog causes visibility to drop below 50 metres, it is categorised as very dense fog. The red alert, which is the highest level of warning, is rarely used. The warning for Friday is primarily for deterring people from venturing out as the 4 am to 10 am time window could lead to car pile-ups and deaths on the road in Delhi-NCR, which have already been reported since the fog thickened in the last three days.By 10 pm on Thursday, several parts of Delhi-NCR were enveloped in a thick fog.On Thursday, the capital saw a slight improvement in some places. Palam had a visibility of 50 metres and Safdarjung 200 metres in the morning and it improved as the day rolled on. However, Aya Nagar remained covered under very dense fog around 8.30am.“The reason the fog situation saw some improvement on Thursday was due to overnight winds in several areas. The wind speed on Wednesday night reached up to 8 kmph, so the fog dissipated. However, on Friday the wind speed will drop,” Kuldeep Srivastava, a scientist with India Meteorological Department (IMD), said, explaining why experts expect very dense fog on Friday morning.“We have issued the red warning for Friday, suggesting that the time between 4am to 10am could see accidents as visibility will be very low. So, unless it’s very essential, do not take out your vehicle at this time,” Srivastava said. For Saturday, the IMD has issued an orange alert for dense to moderate fog.Delhi’s base station at Safdarjung recorded at 21.4 degrees Celsius as the maximum, a notch above normal and against 22 degrees Celsius a day earlier. The minimum temperature was 8.4 degrees Celsius, two notches above normal. On Wednesday, it was 7.8 degrees Celsius.106333563106277366106304823The maximum and minimum temperature is likely to hover around 21 degrees Celsius and 7 degrees Celsius on Friday.The air quality index (AQI) of the capital remained very poor at 358 at 4 pm. The average AQI was 350, against 380 on Wednesday. According to the air quality early warning system, the AQI is likely to be in the very poor range from Friday to Sunday too.“Weather conditions are not favourable for effective dispersion of pollutants. Emissions from firecrackers if burnt on December 31 will further deteriorate air quality… The predominant surface wind is likely to be from the east-southeast direction in Delhi-NCR with wind speed of 6-4 kmph with partly cloudy sky with dense to very dense fog at most places in the morning on December 29,” the IITM’s air quality early warning system has predicted.Meanwhile, the region’s air quality on Thursday improved marginally but remained in the ‘very poor’ category. Noida recorded an AQI of 351 against 385 a day ago, and Greater Noida had 360 against 353 on Wednesday. Ghaziabad’s AQI also improved slightly at 318 against 362 on Wednesday. As per a SAFAR bulletin, the air quality is likely to remain in the ‘very poor’ category on Friday.",

    "text": "Former\nMajor League Baseball pitcher Scott Sauerbeck has died at the age of 53 after suffering a heart attack in Bradenton, Florida, Pittsburgh Baseball Now reports.\nSauerbeck, a left-handed reliever, was drafted by the New York Mets in the 23rd round of the 1994 MLB Amateur Draft and selected by the\nPittsburgh Pirates in the 1998 Rule 5 Draft after four seasons in the minors. The Cincinnati native spent five seasons with the Pirates before being traded to the Boston Red Sox midway through the 2003 season and had later stints with the Cleveland Indians and Oakland Athletics.\n“The Pirates family mourns the passing of Scott Sauerbeck,” the team wrote in a post shared on its social media accounts. “Scott played for the Bucs from 1999-2003 and shares the club record for most games pitched by a LHP in one season.\n“Our thoughts are with his family and friends during this time.\nSauerbeck finished his MLB career with a 20-17 record and a 3.82 ERA, as well as five saves and 389 strikeouts in 386.1 innings pitched and 471 games. The left-hander attempted to make a comeback with the Cincinnati Reds in 2008, signing a minor league deal but never playing for his hometown team.",

    "title": "Office manager testifies James Craig dismissed wife's poisoning symptoms | Fox News",
    "text": "The second day of Dr. James Craig's murder trial hinged on critical testimony from the office manager at his Sunnybook Dental Group practice in Aurora, Colorado , who said Craig flippantly dismissed the first alleged poisoning attempt of his wife, Angela.\nCaitlin Romero worked at the dentist's office in 2023 and was with Craig for several days during the period he is alleged to have killed his wife by mixing cyanide and tetrahydrozoline, a chemical in eyedrops, in her protein shakes.\nShe told Assistant District Attorney Ryan Brackley and the court that, on March 6 of that year, Craig entered the office unusually late and told her he and his wife had worked out earlier in the morning. He apologized for being late and told Romero Angela wasn't feeling well after he made her a post-workout protein shake.\nVICTIM OR MANIPULATOR? COLORADO DENTIST’S MURDER TRIAL PAINTS DUELING PORTRAITS OF WIFE IN TROUBLED MARRIAGE\nRecalling the conversation, Romero testified that Craig said, \"Maybe he added too much protein\" to his wife's shake.\nShe said Craig left the office later that day to take his wife to the emergency room, where Angela reported feeling dizzy. She texted her husband that she felt \"drugged\" before they went to the hospital. She was released without a diagnosis the same day.\nCraig returned to the office at 5:30 p.m., which was unusual. The practice closes at 4 p.m.\nWhen she left for the day, Romero said she was startled to find Craig sitting in the dark, using the computer in an exam room, which was not his usual computer. When she asked him what he was doing, Craig told her he had come back to the office to unwind after a stressful day dealing with his wife's sickness.\nAfter Romero left the office that day, she said Craig texted her to alert her that a personal package would be delivered to the office and asked her not to open it. That had never happened before, Romero noted.\nCOLORADO DENTIST'S ALLEGED INTERNET SEARCH HISTORY TAKES CENTER STAGE AS MURDER TRIAL BEGINS\nOn March 9, Angela returned to the hospital, exhibiting similar symptoms to three days earlier. This time, she was admitted and remained in the hospital until March 14.\nRomero testified that, on that day, Craig told her he didn't think Angela would live through the night, which Romero said was the second time he had made that prediction since Angela began experiencing symptoms.\n\"Evidence that Craig predicted his wife's death twice before it occurred can be significant in his criminal case to prove his alleged intent in his case,\" Kelly Hyman, a nationally renowned defense lawyer and legal analyst, told Fox News Digital. Hyman is not involved in the tr\n\"Intent in murder cases refers to the accused's mental state at the time of the crime. First-degree murder can require proof of premeditation and specific intent to kill in a criminal case.\n\"Predictions of death may suggest that Craig had allegedly been contemplating and planning the act for a period, potentially for a ‘sustained period of time,’ which may imply premeditation.\"\nThe defense chose not to challenge these statements made by Romero, but Hyman said it could have.\nSMALL TOWN DENTIST FACING TRIAL FOR ALLEGEDLY POISONING WIFE'S PROTEIN SHAKE AMID SECRET AFFAIR\n\"However, the defense would challenge the admissibility and interpretation of such statements and argue that Craig’s wife was suicidal,\" Hyman said. \"Also, the defense could argue that the statements were taken out of context and/or misinterpreted.\"\nOn March 13, the package arrived to Craig's practice. A staff member opened the package before bringing it to Romero, who described the contents of the box as a sealed \"foil package\" and a paper invoice. The box was marked as a biohazard. She checked the invoice to make sure it was the personal package that Craig had discussed with her and saw that it was. On the invoice, she read that Craig had ordered potassium cyanide, which she immediately googled out of curiosity.\nOn March 15, Angela was admitted to the hospital for the final time.\nCraig was in the office that day and told Romero he had to leave because Angela was returning to the hospital.\nRomero testified that with suspicions mounting, she then googled symptoms of cyanide poisoning.\nCOLORADO DENTIST'S MURDER TRIAL PUT ON HOLD AFTER DEFENSE ‘SUDDENLY QUIT' PRIOR TO JURY SELECTION\nDuring cross-examination, lead defense attorney Lisa Fine Moses pointed to the fact that while Romero had received the package and read that it contained potassium cyanide, she couldn't be sure of that because she did not open the sealed foil package.\nShe also asked Romero about her evening office interaction with Craig on March 6, and Romero conceded that, emotionally, Craig seemed normal during that time.\nMoses examined Romero's relationship with Craig, which Romero described as an \"intimate emotional relationship.\" She established that the pair were close and often spoke about personal and family matters on personal devices and via channels unrelated to their work.\nMoses also established that, during the investigation into the alleged crime, when Romero spoke to police, she did not disclose the true nature of their relationship or all of the communications between them.\nThe importance of calling a critical witness like Romero as a witness so early in the trial was not lost on Hyman.\n\"The prosecutor will want to start strong and end strong as to the witnesses,\" she said. \"The prosecutor may want to start the case with the most important witness. For example, the star witness, or someone that is going to start telling the story of the case as to the timeline of the case from start to finish.\"",

    "title": "Transforming Belmont: Skanska USA Building's Sustainable Athletic Facility Project",
    "text": "In the heart of Belmont, MA, a transformative project is underway, marking not just the construction of a new athletic facility, but a leap towards sustainable community development. Skanska USA Building has been awarded a significant $22.6 million contract to erect a 40,300 square foot skating rink and athletic center. This initiative, set to replace the existing Viglirolo Skating Rink, embarked on its journey in October 2023, with a completion target set for early 2025. This development is not just about enhancing sports facilities; it's a narrative of community, sustainability, and progress.\nA New Era for Belmont's Athletic Infrastructure\nThe new facility is poised to become a landmark in Belmont, boasting a steel-framed, pre-engineered metal building that encompasses a 200-ft. by 85-ft. ice sheet. But it's more than just an ice rink; it will house four team locker rooms, four dressing rooms, public toilets, bleacher seating for spectators, and a concession stand to cater to the needs of athletes and visitors alike. What sets this project apart is not just its scale but its commitment to sustainability. The inclusion of PV solar panels and a heat pump refrigeration system in the design underscores a forward-thinking approach to energy use and environmental responsibility.\nSkanska: Building with Vision\nSkanska's selection for this project is no happenstance. Their portfolio in Massachusetts speaks volumes, with notable projects like the expansion and renovation of the Deerfield Academy athletic complex and the construction of the Margot Connell Recreation Center at Boston College. These undertakings showcase a blend of architectural ingenuity and a commitment to sustainability, aligning perfectly with Belmont's vision for its new athletic facility. This project is not just about constructing a building; it's about crafting a space that will inspire, include, and innovate for generations to come.\nLooking Towards a Sustainable Future\nThe decision to integrate PV solar panels and a heat pump refrigeration system into the new facility's design is a testament to Belmont's dedication to sustainability. These features are not merely add-ons but are central to the project's ethos, ensuring that the facility will minimize its carbon footprint while providing top-notch amenities. This approach mirrors a broader shift towards sustainability in community planning, recognizing the vital role that public spaces play in promoting environmental stewardship.\nAs we look towards the completion of the new skating rink and athletic facility in early 2025, it's clear that this project is more than a construction endeavor; it's a step towards a more sustainable and inclusive future for Belmont. Through innovative design, attention to environmental impact, and a focus on community needs, this new facility will not just replace the Viglirolo Skating Rink but will elevate the standards for athletic complexes everywhere. The partnership between Belmont and Skanska, grounded in shared values of progress and sustainability, is set to transform not just a physical space, but the very fabric of the community it serves.",
