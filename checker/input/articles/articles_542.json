    "text": "Сильная, нестерпимая головная боль, которую не удается снять никакими средствами, — один из ключевых признаков менингококковой инфекции. Об этом рассказал доктор медицинских наук, врач-терапевт и иммунолог, специалист по особо опасным инфекциям Владислав Жемчугов. «Основной симптом — это головная боль, очень сильная, непроходящая и ничем не снимающаяся. Также у больных отмечается очень высокая температура, им больно смотреть на свет», — пояснил он. Симптомы В числе других признаков медик назвал так называемый симптом Ласега: больной не может наклониться вперед, спина выгибается назад.",

Navigating feelings of grief, confusion and even anger can be much more difficult during the holiday season, notes Hospice of Ukiah’s Grief and Bereavement Counselor, Kay Lieberknecht.\n“For many years, Hospice of Ukiah has been offering support groups for those grieving a loved one during the holidays,” says Lieberknecht. The free support groups are scheduled for Saturday, Nov. 9 and Saturday, Dec. 7. The groups will take place at the Ukiah United Methodist Church from 10 a.m. to noon. Individuals may choose to attend one or both sessions.\nLieberknecht stresses that anyone who has lost a loved one, regardless of when the person has passed, is invited to attend.\n“Grief has no expiration date. It is not unusual for someone who has lost a loved one to feel overwhelmed as the calendar moves closer to the holidays. We have had people attend the support group who lost a family member many years ago. But because the celebrations of Christmas, Thanksgiving or Hanukah were significant family events, grief can start pouring in unexpectedly and leave people feeling unmoored or overwhelmed,” Lieberknecht continues. “Our grief groups provide a safe, loving atmosphere where individuals may share their direct experiences. From there, we create ways for grieving individuals to honor their loved ones during this tender time.”\nIn addition to the two workshops, Lieberknecht is available for no-cost individual and group counseling sessions. The Methodist Church is located at 270 N. Pine St., room 106. Pre-registration is strongly preferred, but the groups will be open to walk-in attendees if the session hasn’t reached capacity. To pre-register, phone Kay Lieberknecht at (707) 391-1817.\nShare this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Most Popular Most Popular More (unofficial) Mendocino County Election results More (unofficial) Mendocino County Election results Criss, Crane leading in Ukiah City Council race Criss, Crane leading in Ukiah City Council race Controlled burn planned Friday in Ukiah Controlled burn planned Friday in Ukiah Mendocino County Farm Bureau relocates to new office in Ukiah Mendocino County Farm Bureau relocates to new office in Ukiah Measure V passing, Measure W failing in early results Measure V passing, Measure W failing in early results Bartolomie sees likely ‘huge turnout’ in Mendocino County Bartolomie sees likely 'huge turnout' in Mendocino County The Observer: Who closed mental health hospitals in California?

    "text": "2024 might be an election year, but the battle for the White House has nothing on one of the greatest, and most ridiculous, feuds ever to take place in a movie theatre.\nDune director Dennis Villeneuve might as well have declared open war on Ryan Reynolds and his highly-anticipated Deadpool & Wolverine after casually dismissing one of the best popcorn buckets ever made.\nFor anyone not in the know, this year has delivered some truly amazing movie tie-ins.\nBarbie came with a slick convertible, while Garfield delivered a classic kitty collectible. It was all fun and games until Dune: Part 2 went and made things weird with a slightly suggestive Shai-Hulud, aka sandworm, maw to hold the buttery snack. The simple bucket is incredibly detailed, and looks like… well, a worm. It’s reaching the popcorn that makes the cup so suggestive — to nab a bite, snackers have to plunge their hand into the worm’s gaping cavity, a hole that stretches to the middle of your forearm.\nMirroring the dirty details of Dune’s masterful collectible, Wolfie’s mouth holds the buttery snack in Deadpool & Wolverine‘s popcorn bucket. It’s hard to say which critter would be more dangerous to stick your hand in, but we’re betting Wolverine would be just as likely to chomp those fingers right off. The tie-in vessel is wildly NSFW and filmed with enough innuendo that we’d be reticent to have Grandma in the room when it came on.\nDespite the Deadpool-approved levels of deeply suggestive footage that left viewers uncomfortably hot, Villeneuve is completely unbothered. When asked if he knew that Ryan Reynolds had declared a popcorn bucket war, the director said,\n“They are tremendously jealous of our bucket. And they are doing their best to bring something horrific to the world, but the Dune bucket is unmatchable.”\nWhen pressed, he made sure to say that he did like Deadpool & Wolverine’s attempt at Dune 2‘s bucket crown, but in the director’s own words, Dune’s unnerving and gapping sandworm is, “one of a kind.”\nAs much as we love the attempt and respect the shots fired, we’ve got to agree. There is something so effortlessly naughty about that rearing, toothy sandworm. And while we can all agree that we’d jump at the chance to do something dirty with Hugh Jackman in any form, it takes some powerful suggestion to consider Shai-Hulud the pinnacle of sexy.\nAnd yet… here we are.\n ",

    "text": "Google Pixel Watch update introduces an annoying change that makes the device harder to use\nPixel Watch, changing how users interact with the device when the screen is locked. This change centers around the functionality of the watch's rotating crown.\nBefore this update, activating Touch Lock on Pixel Watches running Wear OS 4 or the initial Wear OS 5 would disable the touchscreen. This prevented accidental inputs from stray touches or water droplets, which was useful during activities like exercise or in wet environments.\nTurning Touch Lock on and off on a Pixel Watch. | Image credit — 9to5Google\nThe new behavior in Wear OS 5.1\nFollowing the update to Wear OS 5.1, enabling Touch Locknow disables both the touchscreen and the rotating crown. With Touch Lock active, the screen ignores taps, and the crown no longer responds to rotation. The only interaction possible is a two-second long-press of the crown, which deactivates the lock entirely.\nThis modification has drawn criticism from some users.\nOne pointed outthe convenience of the older system, especially for checking notifications with the crown while showering, a scenario where using the touchscreen is impractical.\nThis specific change arrives alongside the rollout of Wear OS 5 and its subsequent point releases like 5.1. Wear OS 5 itself focused on larger improvements, including battery life optimizations and new developer tools. Small usability tweaks in updates like 5.1 are common but, as seen here, can sometimes have a noticeable impact on the daily user experience, especially compared to competitors like Apple Watch or Samsung Galaxy Watch which have their own screen lock nuances.\nCurrently, it's not certain if Google intended to disable crown functionality with Touch Lock or if it's an unintentional bug in Wear OS 5.1. The company hasn't updated the official support documentation for Touch Lock to reflect this change. Users affected by this are hoping for clarification or a fix in a future software update, possibly in the next monthly patch cycle if it's deemed a bug.\nDisabling all physical input methods when Touch Lock is on seems somewhat counterintuitive for a device designed for quick glances. Limiting interaction options, even when trying to prevent accidental input, can reduce the watch's convenience in certain situations. We await Google's clarification on whether this is the new standard behavior.\nLoading Comments...",
