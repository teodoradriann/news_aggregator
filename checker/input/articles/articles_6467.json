    "text": "NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. (WCIV) — An individual getting off a school bus in early March was pistol-whipped multiple times in an attempted armed robbery in North Charleston, the city police department said in an incident report. On March 8, North Charleston Police Department officers were sent to the site of an assault on Centre Pointe Drive. When police arrived, they encountered a victim who said that as they exited a school bus at Constitution Avenue around 3:45 p.m. two suspects chased them down, asked for money and beat them with the butt of a black Glock that had an extended magazine, the incident report said. The altercation began when the victim began walking home after getting off at the bus stop. One of the suspects got off the bus at the same stop and got into a dark blue Chevy Malibu that was waiting near the vicinity, police said.

Both suspects then exited the vehicle, chasing down the victim on Ranger Drive where they began repeatedly asking where the money was located, police said. When the victim said they didn't have any money, that was when the suspects struck them with a handgun on the left side of the head, police said. The victim then dropped the book bag and ran into a nearby residence while the suspects rummaged through the bag before running back to the car, police said. One arrest has been made in the case, which was carried out on March 22.",

    "text": "Siddaramaiah’s U-turn on hijab ban\nAfter row over the change in law, Karnataka CM says matter is still at discussion stage\nPublished: 24th December 2023 05:48 AM | Last Updated: 24th December 2023 05:48 AM | A+A A-\nMYSURU : Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, who declared on Friday that he had directed officials to lift the ban on wearing hijab in educational institutions, did a U-turn on Saturday stating that no such decision has been taken and the matter is still at the discussion stage.\nHis statement at Kavalande village in Mysuru district, where he inaugurated a police station, drew widespread criticism. BJP leaders, including former chief ministers BS Yediyurappa and Basavaraj Bommai, and senior leader Basangouda Patil Yatnal came down heavily on Siddaramaiah soon after his statement.\nMany Congress leaders also criticised Siddaramaiah stating that it was wrong on the part of the CM to make such a statement which would affect the party’s winning prospects in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. Siddaramaiah refused to speak on the hijab issue during his visit to Mysuru on Saturday. However, when reporters pressed him for his response, he opened up stating that the matter was still at the discussion stage.\nSiddaramaiah said, “We have not revoked the ban yet, I had to reply when somebody in the audience raised the issue during the function at Kavalande village on Friday. We are thinking about lifting the ban. We will discuss it at the government level before taking a final decision.”\nMeanwhile, the BJP was unhappy with the CM’s U-turn. “Did any Muslim leader insist CM Siddaramaiah to withdraw the ban on hijab? He should stop doing this kind of political drama. He can’t satisfy Muslims by doing this. I strongly condemn Siddaramaiah’s statement,” said former chief minister BS Yediyurappa here on Saturday.\nReplying to Siddaramaiah’s statement that his government is thinking of withdrawing the ban on wearing hijab in schools and colleges, Yediyurappa said the CM should refrain from taking such a decision. He said people from all religions and castes are equal for BJP. But Siddaramaiah is against this. The Congress government is trying to divert people’s attention as it has failed in implementing its five guarantee schemes, he alleged.\nLeader of Opposition in the Legislative Assembly R Ashoka said the BJP will launch a struggle against the government over the issue. He alleged that Siddaramaiah has made it a habit to divide society for political gains. “Caste Census card failed. North-South card failed. Now Hijab is back! Having failed in Karnataka to deliver on guarantees and governance, CM is now trying to rake up the Hijab issue to hide his government’s shortcomings,” Ashoka posted on ‘X’.",

    "text": "Zesty and flavorful, this easy pico de gallo recipe boasts authenticity in every bite.\nIt combines simple, fresh ingredients to make the perfect condiment. With tomatoes, onions, cilantro, and jalapenos, it’s a delightful contrast of tastes and textures.\nServe it up as a\ngame-day snack or an accompaniment to the best Mexican recipes around.\nSo, want to learn how to make authentic pico de gallo? You’ve come to the right place.\nWhat Is Pico de Gallo?\nPico de gallo, also known as “Salsa Fresca” or “Salsa Cruda,” is a beloved Mexican salsa.\nIt’s made with ripe tomatoes, chopped onions, cilantro, and lime juice.\nI like to add jalapeno peppers to mine for extra heat. But feel free to skip them or remove the seeds for a milder version.\nIt’s a snatch to make and takes about 10 minutes to prepare. You can also easily adjust the measurements to your liking.\nIt’s also highly customizable! I sometimes use sweeter tomatoes or add sliced peaches or mangoes for a nice flavor contrast.\nSo feel free to experiment. It’s your salsa, your rules!\nPico de Gallo vs. Salsa\nPico de gallo and salsa are both Mexican condiments, but they differ in key ways.\nPico de gallo, often called “fresh salsa,” uses raw, finely diced ingredients. It’s chunkier and less watery than salsa.\nTraditional salsa can involve roasted or stewed tomatoes, resulting in a smoother, purée-like texture.\nBoth\nhomemade salsa recipes are delicious and versatile.\nServe them as accompaniments to these\neasy Mexican appetizers for a fun feast!\nIngredients\nYou need these essential components to make the perfect pico de gallo.\n- Ripe tomatoes – These provide a fresh and vibrant base.\n- White onion – The onion’s sharpness adds a delightful contrast to the salsa.\n- Fresh cilantro – Fragrant cilantro enhances the salsa’s aromatic profile.\n- Fresh jalapeño peppers – These spicy peppers infuse the salsa with a kick of heat.\n- Lime juice – Lime juice offers a zesty, tangy twist to brighten the flavors.\n- Salt – A pinch of salt balances the ingredients and enhances their natural tastes.\nRefer to the complete recipe below for specific amounts and the detailed method.\nHow to Make Homemade Pico de Gallo\nThis delicious pico de gallo is a breeze to make. With just a few simple steps, you’ll have a fresh and vibrant salsa ready to enjoy.\n1. Chop and toss the vegetables. Cut up your tomatoes, onion, cilantro, and jalapenos finely.\n2. Place them in a bowl. Season them with lime juice and salt.\n3. Wait for 10-15 minutes before serving. Serve and enjoy your homemade pico de gallo!\nTips for the Best Pico de Gallo\nWith these tips, you’ll master the art of creating the best homemade pico de gallo every time.\n- The riper and redder, the better. Opt for vibrant, ripe tomatoes with deep red hues to ensure the best flavor.\n- Quality is key. The simplicity of this recipe relies on excellent ingredients.\n- Ditch the tomato seeds and juices. Exclude the seedy pulp when preparing the tomatoes to prevent your pico from becoming too watery.\n- Dice the ingredients finely. Chop your tomato, onion, jalapeño, and cilantro into small, uniform pieces for maximum flavor in every bite.\n- Marinate the onion and jalapeño. Let the onion, jalapeño, lime, and salt marinate while you chop the remaining ingredients. This extra step enhances the overall flavor.\n- Give it a rest. Allow your pico de gallo to rest for at least 15 minutes before serving to let the flavors meld and intensify.\n- Let it chill for enhanced flavor. Refrigerate your pico de gallo for at least an hour or up to a day to improve its taste.\n- Serve with a slotted spoon. Tomatoes release moisture. Use a slotted spoon for serving to avoid transferring excess liquid to your dishes.\nRecipe Variations\nPico de gallo is your versatile canvas to create ideal summer appetizers! You can also tailor-make it to complement your favorite Mexican dishes. Let’s get creative:\n- Make it fruity. Replace tomatoes with mango, pineapple, watermelon, peaches, or strawberries for a tropical spin.\n- Add extra crunch. Incorporate diced red bell peppers or fresh corn kernels into your pico.\n- Spice it up. Infuse bold flavors with a pinch of coriander or ground cumin for a zesty kick.\n- Make it creamy. Enhance your pico with creamy elements like diced avocado or black beans for a satisfying richness.\n- Swap the ingredients. Feel free to use red onion or scallions if white onion is unavailable. Serrano peppers can also replace jalapeños.\nWhat to Serve with Fresh Pico de Gallo\nFresh pico de gallo is the perfect side or appetizer for culinary creations! It adds zest to your table, whether Cinco de Mayo parties or a casual night in.\nPair pico de gallo with:\n- Chips and Salsa: The classic duo for an easy snack.\nChicken Fajitas: Spice up your fajitas with a zesty topping.\n- Fish Tacos: Freshen up your tacos with a burst of flavor.\n- Enchiladas: Elevate your enchiladas with a vibrant salsa.\nQuesadilla: Add a refreshing twist to your cheesy quesadillas. Mexican Pizza: Top your pizza with fresh pico de gallo for a zesty punch.\nHow to Store\nIn case you’ve made too much, here’s how to store leftover fresh salsa.\nTo Make Ahead: It’s a great idea to make pico de gallo in advance. It allows the flavors to meld and make it taste even better.\nJust prepare it a few hours before serving to let the ingredients marinate. Stir it occasionally for best results.\nTo Store: Store leftover pico de gallo in an air-tight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Give it a good stir before serving, and adjust the lime and salt to taste if needed.\nThe salsa will soften and become slightly watery as it sits. However, it’s still delicious!\nNote: Pico de gallo does not freeze well, so it’s best enjoyed fresh or refrigerated.\nMore Mexican Recipes You’ll Love\n ",

    "text": "Café segue com pressão das chuvas no Brasil e arábica passa a cair nesta 6ª feira (01) Após começar o dia com variações positivas na bolsa na Bolsa de Nova York, o café arábica passou a cair mais de 1% entre os principais contratos nesta sexta-feira (01). Em Londres, os futuros do robusta tinham começado o dia com baixas e as perdas também superavam 1% durante esta tarde. Por volta das 12h30 (horário de Brasília), em Nova York, o contrato dezembro/24 do arábica tinha baixa de 285 pontos, negociado em 243,05 cents/lbp. O março/25 caía 305 pontos, cotado em 242,45 cents/lbp. O maio/25 perdia 310 pontos, com valor de 241,35 cents/lbp, e o julho/25 registrava uma redução de 65 pontos, precificado em 239,35 cents/lbp. Em Londres, o robusta perdia US$ 73 no contrato novembro/24, que valia US$ 4.296/tonelada, assim como janeiro/25 que apresentava a mesma baixa e o mesmo valor. O março/25 caía US$ 66, cotado em US$ 4.215. O maio/25 tinha preço de US$ 4.154, com redução de US$ 62. Nesta sexta-feira, segundo informações da Reuters, cooperativas brasileiras relataram boas floradas em outubro com a chegada de chuvas volumosas, mas a questão que fica para a safra de 2025 é sobre parcela dos \"chumbinhos\" que vão se transformar em grãos após um longo período de déficit hídrico. A Reuters destacou a fala de Carlos Augusto Rodrigues de Melo, presidente da Cooxupé, maior cooperativa de cafeicultores e exportadora líder do país: \"Mas, como diziam os antigos, flor não é café\". Segundo ele, as lavouras que estão \"bem vestidas, enfolhadas\", deverão ter \"bom pegamento\", o que não acontecerá com as \"mais depauperadas\". Por isso, é \"cedo\" para estimar a safra 2025.

    "title": "‘Transgender’ Biden official Levine behind removal of age limits in ‘sex change’ surgery guidelines - LifeSite",
    "text": "WASHINGTON, D.C. ( LifeSiteNews ) — Cross-dressing Biden administration assistant Health & Human Services (HHS) Secretary Richard “Rachel” Levine was instrumental in the World Professional Association for Transgender Health’s (WPATH’s) elimination of minimum-age guidelines for “gender reassignment” procedures, according to newly-unsealed documents. Released as part of a court filing in the ongoing lawsuit against Alabama’s ban on “transitioning” gender-confused minors, the documents include the declaration by Canadian psychologist James Cantor that Levine – a man who “identifies” as a woman – “strongly pressured WPATH leadership to rush the development and issuance of SOC-8 [WPATH’s Standards of Care Version 8 ], in order to assist with Administration political strategy.” Cantor submitted emails from WPATH members discussing meetings with Levine, who they say “like[s] the SOC-8 very much but [he] was very concerned that having ages (mainly for surgery) will affect access to health care for trans youth [sic] and maybe adults too,” that he “and the Biden administration worried that having ages in the document will make matters worse,” and that Levine “as always is extremely supportive of the SOC 8, but also very eager for its release.” Specifically, the emails relay Levine’s fear that “specific listings of ages, under 18,” would lead to more legislation limiting procedures on minors. “She [Levine’s chief of staff Sara Boateng] wonders if the specific ages can be taken out and perhaps an adjunct document could be created that is published or distributed in a way that is less visible than the SOC8, is the way to go,” one reads. “[W]e heard your comments regarding the minimal age criteria for transgender healthcare [sic] adolescents; the potential negative outcome of these minimal ages as recommendations in the US,” so “we have changes to the SOC 8 in this respect,” one email from a WPATH member told Levine in response. An overwhelming body of evidence shows that “affirming” gender confusion carries serious harms, especially when done with impressionable children who lack the mental development, emotional maturity, and life experience to consider the long-term ramifications of the decisions being pushed on them or full knowledge about the long-term effects of life-altering, physically destructive, and often irreversible surgical and chemical procedures. Studies find that more than 80% of children suffering gender dysphoria outgrow it on their own by late adolescence and that “transition” interventions, including full “reassignment” surgery, fail to resolve gender-confused individuals’ heightened tendency to engage in self-harm and suicide – and may even exacerbate it , including by reinforcing their confusion and neglecting the actual root causes of their mental strife. Yet despite this evidence, including a since-deleted report from its own Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), the Biden White House aggressively promotes surgical and chemical deformation of gender-confused minors and condemns state laws banning the practices as “close to sinful.” In February, government watchdog Protect the Public Trust filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request in the Alabama case for “records of scientific evidence, studies, and/or data to support the Assistant Secretary’s claim that ‘gender-affirming care is medically necessary, safe, and effective for trans and non-binary youth [sic]’” and “records of surveys of medical professionals regarding the value and importance of ‘gender-affirming care’ for minor children.” In response, HHS produced a document titled “Gender-Affirming Care and Young People” that cites a study from the LGBT pressure group Trevor Project, leading Protect the Public Trust to conclude that “Assistant Secretary Levine has constantly, continually, ‘everywhere I go,’ made unequivocal statements regarding the medical necessity, safety, and effectiveness of [transgender interventions] based entirely upon a single two-page document” that is “essentially a piece of marketing material with cherry-picked data and agenda-driven assertions.”",
