    "text": "Get ready for an unsettled weekend with showers and the potential for some severe weather November 1, 2024 - Evening forecast HASTINGS, Neb. (KSNB) - After a pleasant start to the month of November, reality will be setting in as we head into the first part of next week. And between now and then there will be a transition period. As with any transition there is usually an unsettled time. This weekend will be no exception as it will mark the dividing line between a warm fall season and a typical November weather weather pattern. With that said, get ready for an unsettled weekend with showers and storms. Some of those storms potentially strong to severe later in the second half on the weekend. The weather looks quiet with a gradual increase in clouds from the south later tonight. Lows will dip into the 30s and 40s with the warmest temperatures in North Central Kansas. A weak disturbance will lift northeast into the area tomorrow, increasing the chance of rain and isolated thunder as the day goes on. Chances will be greatest in the east and lowest to the west. Winds will be slightly breezy out of the southeast, increasing low-level moisture as the day goes on. Despite the increase in clouds, temperatures will still manage to get to the upper 50s and lower 60s for most. A chance of showers and thunderstorms will continue Saturday night. It’ll remain quite mild, thanks to the clouds and low-level moisture. Lows will remain in the upper 40s and low to mid 50s. It’ll actually be a bit milder on Sunday, despite the continued off and on chance of showers and thunderstorms. High temperatures will range from the upper 50s northwest to the lower 70s south. With enough instability, there is an outside chance of severe weather Sunday evening as a cold front slides southeast. While I don’t anticipated a large amount of severe weather, some isolated large hail and severe gusts can’t be ruled out. The cold front will push southeastward, bringing chillier air on Monday. Highs on Monday will mostly range from the upper 40s northwest to the upper 50s southeast. Some rain will continue, but the first area to dry out will be the northwest. We’ll then see the rain move on out Monday night. Tuesday should be a decent day for election day with a decent amount of sun. Highs will mostly be in the mid to upper 50s. Clouds will start to move in Wednesday and so will cooler temperatures. We’ll see highs back down in the 40s and 50s on Wednesday. There’s a lot of uncertainty with timing of moisture, but active weather could return for a time between Thursday and next weekend. This could be mostly rain, but it’s not out of the question for some wintry weather for some. But that will certain depend on timing, which is too difficult to predict this far out.

    "title": "Ramaswamy campaigns at Lincoln's Pub in Council Bluffs",
    "text": "Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy doubled down on his war against “wokeism,” linking it with “transgenderism, climatism” and “covidism” as the cornerstones of an insidious plot to undermine the American dream — a plot that he beieves only he can defeat. “I see a Republican party that has grown lazy,” Ramaswamy told a small crowd of about 20 people at Lincoln’s Pub in Council Bluffs on Thursday, the first of nine scheduled campaign stops for the day. “I don't just mean lazy in the ‘get out the vote operation’ sense of lazy. I mean lazy in defining who we are and what we even stand for,\" Ramaswamy continued. \"The left is very good at this. I mean, they don't give you the right vision, but they'll give you a vision: race, gender, sexuality, climate.\" He said the Republican Party has \"grown lazy to just sit here criticizing what they put up, but without offering our own vision of what we actually stand for: individuals, family, nation, God. That beats race, gender, sexuality and climate if we have the courage to actually stand for something.\" People are also reading… Ramaswamy added: \"We can't anymore just be the party that is running from something. We gotta be running to something, to our vision of what it means to be an American today.” Ramaswamy stands for an isolationist “America First” policy, echoing the words of former President Donald Trump and others who have used the slogan. Ramaswamy referred to the Ukrainian defense against Russian invasion as “a pointless foreign war,” suggesting he would no longer aid the nation’s allies against neighboring aggressors. Ramaswamy, said he would send U.S. military forces to both the northern and southern borders to stop people from entering the United States without legal permission. “I can't be a father of two sons in the White House and tell them they have to follow the rules when I'm leading a government that isn't following its own rules,” he said. “Anybody who's in this country illegally will be returned to their country of origin.\" He cited a law he says allows Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents \"can deputize local law enforcement to serve their warrants. That's how we do it. Use our military to secure our own southern border.” Ramaswamy stands for a nuclear family composed of a husband and wife of opposite genders raising their children together. “Kids born in a two parent household versus a fatherless household -- that's most single parent households -- the ones in single parent households are eight times more likely to end up in jail, 10 times more likely not to graduate from high school,” Ramaswamy said. “Right now we are paying single mothers more money not to have a man in the house then to have a man in the house, teaching them to be married to Uncle Sam instead of that other guy who was in their house. That's what we're incentivizing, actually,” he added. Ramaswamy also believes that “the best person no longer gets the job,” calling it “the death of meritocracy,” which is a political ideology that believes that people should be rewarded based solely on talent and effort — without considering how wealth, income inequalities and other factors can impede a person’s opportunities and, thus, their achievements. “It’s based on other attributes,” he said. “Race, gender or whatever the other popular attributes are. That shrinks the success of our culture. We’re penalizing excellence.” If elected president, Ramaswamy would close a variety of government agencies, including the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the federal Department of Education. “That’s how you revive the integrity of a constitutional republic,” he said. He would fire the 20,000 “back office bureaucrats” at the FBI and fold the remaining agents into the U.S. Marshals Service or the Drug Enforcement Administration. Ramaswamy would make Election Day a federal holiday and do away with early voting. He would seek to have ballots printed only in English, and voter identification would be mandatory. “That’s not too much to ask,” he said. “This isn’t a Black or a white idea. These aren’t even Democrat or Republican ideas, not really. These are American ideals that we fought a revolution to secure in this country, and I believe, deep in my heart, that those ideals still exist. I’m running for president to revive them.” Also on the campaign trail this week is the wife of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Casey DeSantis. She will appear Friday in Atlantic at Family Table of Atlantic, 609 W. Seventh St., at 2:30 p.m., followed by Barley's at 114 W. Broadway in Council Bluffs at 4:30 p.m.",

    "title": "Sharp rise in religious hate crimes recorded by UK’s largest police forces | Echo",
    "text": "The number of antisemitic hate crimes recorded by many of the UK’s largest police forces jumped sharply in the weeks following the outbreak of the Hamas-Israel conflict, new figures reveal. Islamophobic offences also rose for some forces, although the picture was more mixed across the country. Jewish charities called the findings “shocking”, while campaigners against anti-Muslim abuse said the data was “deeply worrying”. The Home Office condemned the rise in offences, adding: “There is no place for hate in our society.” The figures have been obtained by the PA news agency using Freedom of Information requests. They show that: – Greater Manchester Police recorded 74 antisemitic offences in the month following the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7, compared with 15 for the same period in 2022 and 14 in 2021, while West Yorkshire Police recorded 53, compared with 10 (2022) and 14 (2021). – West Midlands Police recorded 22 antisemitic offences from October 7 to November 7, compared with one (2022) and eight (2021), while Merseyside Police recorded 20 compared with four (both 2022 and 2021). – The British Transport Police had one of the largest increases, recording 87 antisemitic offences in the month after October 7, up from eight in the same period in 2022 and 11 in 2021, as well as a jump in Islamophobic offences with 22 (2023), up from two (2022) and eight (2021). – West Yorkshire recorded 49 Islamophobic offences in this period in 2023, up from 29 (2022) and 38 (2021), but the pattern was not so clear for Greater Manchester (34 in 2023, 43 in 2022 and 42 in 2021) or West Midlands (25 in 2023, 33 in 2022 and 23 in 2021). The Community Security Trust described the figures as “shocking” and said they made clear “the extent of the unacceptable rise in anti-Jewish hatred across the country since the Hamas terror attack on October 7”. A spokesman for the Jewish charity said: “This wave of antisemitism was triggered by the mass murder, rape and kidnapping of Jews in Israel, and is fuelled and sustained by extremist hatred online and on our streets. “It is essential that perpetrators are identified and prosecuted, and that wider society shows its disgust for this racist hate crime.” Tell Mama, which monitors and works to tackle anti-Muslim sentiment and abuse in the UK, told PA that “levels of anti-Muslim hatred and discrimination are deeply worrying, impacting trust in authorities and their sense of identity and belonging”. Iman Atta, the organisation’s director, said there had been a “significant spike in anti-Muslim hate since the atrocities on October 7”, adding: “The nature of many offline cases sent to our service is often overtly racist – targeting Arab and Palestinian communities with dehumanising slurs, anti-Muslim slurs or in some cases targeting their homes, or when speaking Arabic in public, as well as targeting Muslim communities across all ages and gender. “We should never allow such hatred and intolerance to take root in our communities and at this time, please look out for each other, whether Muslim or Jewish. We must stand together against intolerance, hate and racism.” The Metropolitan Police, the largest force in the UK, said delays prevented it from supplying full figures until the new year, but it had previously reported 218 antisemitic and 101 Islamophobic offences between October 1 and 18 this year, compared with 15 and 42 respectively in the same period in 2022. PA obtained full responses from 31 of the 46 forces across the UK, with the data representing a snapshot of what has currently been recorded by forces and is therefore subject to change. Methods for recording hate crime are not consistent across forces, so the data cannot be used to compare the number of offences between different areas or provide an overall total for the whole of the UK. But the figures do point to a jump in antisemitic offences recorded by forces concentrated mostly in cities or across built-up areas, while the pattern for Islamophobic offences was more varied. Some forces that operate across a mix of urban and less populated areas tend to show a similar pattern, although with lower volumes of offences – for example Hertfordshire Police (17 antisemitic offences for the period in 2023, compared with six in 2022 and three in 2021) and Thames Valley Police (21 antisemitic offences in 2023, one in 2022 and four in 2021). Data obtained from smaller forces, or those covering areas with few towns or cities, typically showed low numbers of offences, often in single figures, meaning a clear trend was hard to determine. A spokesman for the Board of Deputies of British Jews said the findings “provide further evidence of the huge upsurge in antisemitism following the Hamas massacre of October 7”. The board, seen as the voice of the British Jewish community with over 300 deputies directly elected by the synagogues and communal organisations they represent, told PA the rise in antisemitism had “caused enormous anxiety for Jewish people, particularly children and Jewish students on campus or indeed anyone easily identified as Jewish by their dress”. A spokesman added: “We call on police to take strong action against anyone found to be perpetrating hate crimes.” The Muslim Council of Britain said: “Despite the extremely low reporting rate from Muslim communities, the huge increase in Islamophobic hate crimes recorded with the police reflects what we are seeing from third-party reporting groups. “The Government’s laissez-faire attitude to Islamophobia contrasts strongly with its no-tolerance approach to antisemitism. We are hopeful this will now change.” A spokesperson for the Home Office said: “There is no place for hate in our society and we condemn the recent rise in reported antisemitic and anti-Muslim hatred. “We expect the police to fully investigate all hate crimes and work with the CPS to make sure the cowards who commit these abhorrent offences feel the full force of the law. “Following recent events, we have also made further funding available to Jewish and Muslim communities, to provide additional security at places of worship and faith schools.” Comments: Our rules We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

    "text": "The [Africa Centre for Disease Control and Prevention](https://africacdc.org/#:~:text=Africa%20CDC%20strengthens%20the%20capacity%20and) (Africa CDC) has raised concerns over the low testing rate for Mpox in Africa, as “cases are steadily increasing across all affected countries.” As of 22 September, a total of 32,407 confirmed cases and 840 deaths have been reported in 15 countries, according to the situation report released Thursday after the weekly press briefing on the multi-country mpox outbreak in Africa. Signed by the Director General of Africa CDC, Jean Kaseya, the report shows that the Central Africa region accounts for 90 per cent of all cases reported with 28,822 cases and 836 deaths. The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) accounts for the majority of cases, with over 26,267 cases, followed by Burundi, Central Africa Republic (CAR), Congo, Uganda, Côte D’Ivoire, Liberia, Kenya, Nigeria and Gabon. | ---| The report noted that cumulatively, there is over a 194 per cent increase in cases recorded this year when compared to the same time in 2023. Key concerns The Africa CDC raised concerns about gaps and challenges in surveillance, contact tracing and follow-up; and data quality. It noted that contact tracing is less than 4 per cent with over 68 per cent of cases with an unknown epidemiological link. “Overall laboratory testing is 49.5 per cent with much variability across countries and low in highly affected countries against our target of 80 per cent,” it noted. It also said the testing rate remains less than 80 per cent in DRC, Burundi, Congo, Liberia, and Kenya, emphasising the need for enhanced surveillance, contact tracing, lab testing and expansion. Situation in Nigeria According to the Africa CDC situation report, Nigeria ranks 9th out of the 15 countries affected by the current outbreak. As of 15 September, Nigeria has recorded a total of 1,100 detected cases with no fatalities across 51 local government areas (LGAs) in 23 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).
