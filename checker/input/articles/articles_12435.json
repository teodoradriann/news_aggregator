El primer episodio nos presenta a los dos principales protagonistas de esta historia, Basilio Aragón y Sandra Fentanes, dos personas que se dedican a esto y que cuentan desde la crudeza de su día a día por qué el sector se acerca al colapso casi sin darse cuenta.\nMás información\nCamioneros es una historia sobre nosotros. Sobre nuestras sociedades. Nos hemos acostumbrado a vivir en un mundo donde compramos algo y esperamos recibirlo en el menor tiempo posible sin pensar cómo ha llegado a nuestra mesa. Pero ¿En qué condiciones?, ¿Cuánto cobran las personas que trabajan al frente de los camiones?, ¿cuántas horas trabajan? “Te puedo enseñar ahí el trabajo de la semana pasada. Días de diez horas. De 12 horas. De 14 horas” denuncia Basilio subido a su camión en una de sus interminables esperas durante la jornada de trabajo.\nDentro de las cabinas\nNos metemos en las cabinas de los camiones para hacer una radiografía completa de un sector imprescindible que nos enseña la cara más cruda de la desregulación. “El problema no es que haya pocos chóferes ahora. El problema es que va a haber pocos chóferes dentro de diez años\" dice Basilio. Porque este Inicio del viaje es el comienzo de una ruta que nos llevará por todos los problemas de esta industria, “El camionero sabe descargar, sabe meterse al muelle, sabe todo. Cuando es una mujer tienes que demostrar hasta que sabes encender el camión\" se queja Sandra, porque el machismo también va sobre ruedas en este sector.\nLa falta de camioneros puede hacer que nuestro sistema colapse y no le estamos prestando la atención que merece. “La mano la tiene el empresario. Lo que pasa es que no van a dejar de tener ese margen de beneficio para que tú tengas un poquito más de vida o de conciliación familiar\", denuncia Sandra. Intentar encontrar por qué se ha llegado a esta situación es lo que busca este podcast documental. A las condiciones laborales, hay que sumar el problema medioambiental o los retos tecnológicos que afronta el sector y que nos afecta a todos. “No tienes reconocida una puñetera enfermedad profesional. La mayoría de nosotros, los que somos mayores de 45, todos tenemos o algún infarto encima, o problemas de diabetes, de espalda, tenemos problemas todos, pero no te reconocen ni una sola enfermedad profesional” alerta Basilio sobre qué supone trabajar tantas horas dentro de la cabina. No somos conscientes, pero no estamos preparados a un mundo sin los camiones.\nEl sector del transporte de mercancías es el que sostiene realmente nuestra sociedad de consumo, entregas rápidas obtenidas gracias a condiciones laborales que parecen de otra época. Vamos camino del colapso y cuando eso suceda nos preguntaremos cómo hemos llegado hasta aquí. Antes de que llegue ese día mejor saber por qué pasó.

    "title": "Joe Biden uses fiery State of the Union address to contrast with Donald Trump - Jersey Evening Post",
    "text": "President Joe Biden turned his State of the Union speech into an animated argument for a second term as he laced into Republican frontrunner Donald Trump for espousing “resentment, revenge and retribution” and jeopardising freedom at home and abroad. Over and over, Mr Biden delivered broadsides at “my predecessor” without ever mentioning Mr Trump by name — 13 times in all — raising his voice repeatedly as he tried to quell voter concerns about his age and job performance while sharpening the contrast with his all-but-certain November rival. It was a far feistier tone from Mr Biden than his prior State of the Union addresses and it was designed to banish doubts about whether the 81-year-old is still up to the job. For 68 minutes in the House chamber, Mr Biden goaded Republicans over their policies, invited call-and-response banter with fellow Democrats on economic issues, taxes and healthcare and seemed to revel in the fight. “History is watching.” Mr Biden quickly pivoted to the threats at home, referencing the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol by Mr Trump’s supporters seeking to overturn the 2020 election, and calling for the threat to democracy to be countered. “My predecessor — and some of you here — seek to bury the truth about January 6 — I will not do that,” Mr Biden said. “This is a moment to speak the truth and to bury the lies. Here’s a simple truth. You can’t love your country only when you win. “My lifetime has taught me to embrace freedom and democracy. A future based on the core values that have defined America: honesty, decency, dignity, equality. To respect everyone. To give everyone a fair shot. To give hate no safe harbour. “Now some other people my age see a different story: an American story of resentment, revenge, and retribution. That’s not me.” The president showcased his accomplishments on infrastructure and manufacturing, and pushed Congress to approve more aid to Ukraine, tougher migration rules and lower drug prices. He also sought to remind voters of the situation he inherited when he entered office in 2021 amid a raging pandemic and a contracting economy. The 81-year-old president was being closely watched not just for his message, but for whether he could deliver it with vigour and command. Taking a victory lap in selling his legislative accomplishments, such as one that bolsters manufacturing of computer chips nationwide, Mr Biden veered from his prepared script to take a dig at Republicans who voted against such policies but are eager to take credit for them back home. “If any of you don’t want that money in your districts,” Mr Biden said, “just let me know.” The president was speaking before a historically ineffective Congress. In the Republican-led House, Speaker Mike Johnson took power five months ago after the chaotic ouster of former speaker Kevin McCarthy. Legislators are still struggling to approve funding bills for the current year and have been deadlocked for months on foreign assistance bills to help Ukraine stave off Russia’s invasion and support Israel’s fight against Hamas. The State of the Union address is a marquee night on the White House calendar, offering presidents a direct line to a captive audience of lawmakers and dignitaries in the House chamber and tens of millions of viewers at home. But even so, the night has lost some of its lustre as viewership has declined. Mr Biden’s aides inside the White House and on his campaign had hoped for some fresh viral moments — like when he tussled last year with heckling Republicans and chided them for past efforts to cut Medicare and Social Security. Mr Johnson, eager to avoid a similar episode this year, urged Republicans in a private meeting on Wednesday to show “decorum” during the speech, according to a person familiar with his remarks to lawmakers. He appeared to have limited success. A number of House Republicans began to stand up and leave the chamber as Mr Biden discussed raising taxes on billionaires and corporations. Other, like Mr Johnson, remained in their chairs and shook their heads. One of the most contentious moments of his speech came during his remarks on immigration, when Mr Biden was running down the endorsements by conservative groups of the bipartisan border legislation that Republicans killed last month. Some in the audience appeared to yell and interject, and Mr Biden shot back: “I know you know how to read.” As Marjorie Taylor Greene, decked out in pro-Trump paraphernalia, continued to shout at Mr Biden, the president held up a white button that the Georgia Republican had handed him earlier bearing the name of Laken Riley, who authorities say was killed by a Venezuelan national who unlawfully crossed into the US in September 2022. “Laken Riley,” Mr Biden said, calling her an “innocent young woman who was killed by an illegal”. He expressed condolences to her family, saying his heart goes out to them. And congressional Republican leaders were showcasing one of their newest lawmakers through the State of the Union rebuttal in order to make a generational contrast with Mr Biden. Alabama Republican Katie Britt, the youngest woman in the Senate, delivered a stinging election-year critique of the president. She said: “The free world deserves better than a dithering and diminished leader. “America deserves leaders who recognise that secure borders, stable prices, safe streets and a strong defence are the cornerstones of a great nation.” Mr Biden painted an optimistic future for the country as the massive pieces of legislation he signed into law during his first two years in office are implemented. But he also was set to warn that the progress he sees at home and abroad is fragile — and particularly vulnerable if Mr Trump returns to the White House. Mr Trump, for his part, said he planned to respond in real time to Mr Biden’s remarks on his Truth Social platform. This year, Mr Biden faced heightened emotions — particularly among his base supporters — over his staunch backing for Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza. A slew of Democrats and Republicans wore pins and stickers in honour of the Israeli hostages still being held captive in Gaza. Meanwhile, several House progressives wore Palestinian keffiyehs, the black and white chequered scarfs that have come to symbolise Palestinian solidarity. Mr Biden’s motorcade took a circuitous route to the Capitol, as hundreds of pro-ceasefire demonstrators tried to disrupt its path from the White House. Amid growing concerns about the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, Mr Biden announced in his address that he has directed the US military to establish a temporary port on the Gaza coast aimed at increasing the flow of aid into the beleaguered territory. The president also issued an emphatic call for lawmakers to pass sorely needed defence assistance for Ukraine. Acute ammunition shortages have allowed Russia to retake the offensive in the two-year-old war. The Republican-controlled House has refused to act on a Senate-passed version of the aid legislation, insisting on new stiffer measures to limit migration at the US-Mexico border, after Mr Trump used his influence to help sink a bipartisan compromise that would have done just that. Access to abortion and fertility treatments was also a key component of Mr Biden’s speech, especially in light of a controversial ruling from Alabama’s Supreme Court that has upended access to in vitro fertilisation treatment in the state. One of first lady Jill Biden’s guests for the speech was Kate Cox, who sued Texas, and ultimately left her home state, to obtain an emergency abortion after a severe foetal anomaly was detected. “If Americans send me a Congress that supports the right to choose I promise you: I will restore Roe v Wade as the law of the land again,” Mr Biden said. Several House Democratic women were wearing white – a symbol of women’s suffrage – to promote reproductive rights. The White House also invited union leaders, a gun control advocate, and others that Jill Biden and her husband have met as they travelled the country promoting his agenda.",
