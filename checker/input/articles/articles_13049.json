    "text": "First Alert Weather Days issued for Friday & Saturday as icy conditions expected to develop\n**Winter Weather Advisory for most of Siouxland from Friday afternoon through Saturday morning**\nSIOUX CITY (KTIV) - Thursday continued our wintry weather pattern with continued cold temperatures and a little light snow that made travel a little slick in some areas. Now we all have to get ready for a larger system to impact Siouxland with a chance of very slick conditions due to freezing rain that may develop.\nFirst Alert Weather Days have been issued for Friday and Saturday to give you an extra heads up of the dangerous travel that could be involved with this system and to urge you to keep track of the forecast to possibly change travel plans that you may have.\nBefore that system arrives, Thursday night will stay quiet but chilly for us with lows in the single digits under a partly cloudy sky.\nFriday will start off quiet and despite mostly cloudy skies, temperatures will slowly climb into the mid 20s by mid-afternoon with a stronger southeast wind at 15 to 25 miles per hour. It’s during the afternoon that some mixed precipitation could start to develop. The first areas to see development will likely be after mid-afternoon in southern Siouxland where it could be a combination of sleet and freezing drizzle. That moisture will then move to the north through the rest of the afternoon and into the evening perhaps putting down a glaze of ice as the evening hours go along. Due to the travel hazards that will be caused, the National Weather Service has issued a Winter Weather Advisory from Friday afternoon through Saturday morning for the entire KTIV viewing area except for Holt County.\nFriday night will continue the combination of freezing drizzle, freezing rain, sleet, and possibly even some snow at times as the wind tapes off through the night. This mixture will then continue to be widespread into the morning hours Saturday before slowly tapering off as the day goes along on Saturday. One positive for Saturday is that temperatures will be on the rise and some places will be able to go above 32 degrees, helping with the icing that has taken place. In Sioux City, we may try to approach 32 degrees toward the noon hour. By the end of this system, Siouxland could see anywhere from a light glaze of ice to up to .20” of ice accumulation which could make travel difficult. The snow is not expected to be too heavy with most of us seeing sleet and snow accumulation of around an inch or less.\nSaturday night will quiet down but stay mostly cloudy with lows not falling too much into the mid 20s.\nSunday will give us peeks of sunshine but more importantly bring us warmer temperatures. Expect highs to get into the low 40s to round out the weekend with a south wind of 5 to 15 miles per hour.\nAnother cold front will be moving through the region on Monday but at this point we’re expecting to keep conditions dry with highs near 40 under partly cloudy skies.\nWe’ll then cool down a bit into the middle part of the week with highs returning back to the 30s.\nAre there any more systems on the horizon next week? I’ll have more on that here in my story and on News 4 at 10.\nCopyright 2024 KTIV. All rights reserved.",

    "title": "7 Years after ‘summer of hell,’ the subway approaches another crisis - The Boston Globe",
    "text": "NEW YORK — Seven years ago, after a series of subway failures so severe that a stretch of 2017 came to be known as the Summer of Hell, New York officials came up with a plan to make sure a crisis like that would never happen again.\nThrough a tolling program known as congestion pricing, they would raise enough money to restore the system to competency. This would ward off the kind of meltdowns that had left passengers stranded without service, trapped them in dark, hot cars, and injured them in derailments.\nNow, with congestion pricing on hold, experts warn that a return to hell is inevitable.\nThe tolling program would have generated $15 billion to fund critical infrastructure upgrades such as fixing century-old tunnels and crumbling tracks. Just weeks before officials were to begin collecting tolls in June, Governor Kathy Hochul canceled the plan. In doing so, climate change and engineering experts say, she left the continent’s biggest transportation network teetering on the brink of another crisis.\nAdvertisement\n“Concrete and steel, you poke holes in it, subject it to water and chemicals and salt for 100 years, it’s going to give out,” Janno Lieber, CEO of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, said during a board meeting last week. “That is what’s happening, and we must do something about it.”\nBut the congestion pricing plan was politically unpopular, perhaps in part because the benefits to the system were harder to picture than the cost to motorists. A Siena College survey in April found that 63 percent of New York City residents opposed congestion pricing. It was even less popular among suburban respondents.\nIn other cities that have adopted congestion pricing, residents have initially reacted negatively, until the plans went into effect and positive effects were realized.\nHochul has said she halted the tolling plan because of New York City’s unstable economic recovery from the pandemic, though economists, business owners, and civic leaders have rebutted her logic.\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for the governor, John Lindsay, said Hochul was committed to funding the MTA’s capital plan after finding the money last year to save the authority from billions of dollars in deficits to its operating budget.\nAdvertisement\nHe said Hochul oversaw “the largest investment” in the agency’s repair plan in its history and added that she was “working with partners in government on funding mechanisms while congestion pricing is paused.”\nAn MTA spokesperson, Tim Minton, said in a statement that the authority has made strides in improving subway reliability in the past seven years by prioritizing infrastructure upgrades. An average of 84 percent of trains are on time this summer, he noted, compared with only 65 percent during the summer of 2017.\nBut, he added, “We need to maintain this high level of capital investment in order to confront new challenges, including those presented by global climate change.”\nThe disasters that happened during the Summer of Hell were not tied to a single malfunction but a string of engineering emergencies that resulted from decades of deferred repairs to the subway network, said Mona Hemmati, a scientist at Columbia University’s Climate School.\nThe subway’s limits were tested as recently as last month, when power outages and signal problems created lengthy delays for passengers who had to wait inside sweltering stations, where temperatures can surpass 100 degrees.\nRiders were unnerved in January when two separate and unrelated train derailments occurred within a week. A storm last fall shut down half the subway and brought much of the city to a standstill, underscoring the transit system’s difficulties dealing with bad weather intensified by climate change.\nHemmati said that during this time of year, rail operators often impose speed restrictions to reduce the risk of accidents caused by track deformations, which leads to delays.\n“Imagine how people will suffer in this heat in these stations where there is no fan, no air conditioning,” Hemmati said, adding that she nearly fainted from exposure while waiting for a train last month. “It’s a silent killer, and usually will result in more fatalities compared to storms and large-scale events like hurricanes.”\nAdvertisement\nRidership in the city has not rebounded to prepandemic levels; it’s now at about 70 percent of where it once was. When school begins in the fall, passenger counts are expected to reach their highest level in four years, and transit observers believe that the added strain on the system could further test its resiliency.\nCongestion pricing would have charged most drivers $15 to enter Manhattan below 60th Street during peak periods. It was designed to tamp down traffic and pollution while raising $1 billion annually for mass transit.\nLast month the MTA predicted deficits totaling nearly $900 million in 2027 and 2028 in its operating budget because of lower-than-expected revenues from passenger fares and real estate-related taxes. Without the proceeds from congestion pricing tolls, it expects additional operating budget losses of at least $640 million.\nUnable to afford new fleets of buses and train cars, it might have to pay more for emergency repairs and maintenance for older vehicles. The tolls were expected to nudge drivers out of their cars and into subways, buses and commuter rail lines, but now the system cannot count on what had been a projected ridership increase of 1.25 percent.\nHochul has vowed to find a way to plug the hole left by her decision to delay the program.\nLindsay noted that Hochul announced last week that she had found $54 million to revive work on a long-awaited extension of the Second Avenue subway line in Manhattan, a project that was deferred after her decision to pause congestion pricing. But transit advocates have scoffed at what they described as a paltry sum for a single project.\nAdvertisement",

    "text": "La Unión General de Trabajadores (UGT) ha felicitado a la nueva vicepresidenta primera, María Jesús Montero, por su nombramiento, a José Luis Escrivá por sus nuevas competencias y saluda la llegada del nuevo ministro de Economía, Comercio y Empresa, Carlos Cuerpo, un profesional «con un destacado currículum como servidor del Estado».\nDesde el sindicato entienden que Cuerpo mantendrá la línea de la ya exvicepresidenta primera Nadia Calviño, que ha tenido «buenos resultados en materia de política económica durante la anterior legislatura».\nUGT ha solicitado al nuevo ministro a través de un comunicado el reconocimiento del papel constitucional de los interlocutores sociales «que tan buenos resultados se alcanzaron en la pasada legislatura».\nLa organización dirigida por Pepe Álvarez se ha felicitado también por las nuevas competencias del ministro José Luis Escrivá, del que el sindicato ha destacado los acuerdos conseguidos en la reforma del sistema público de pensiones. «Estamos seguros que el Ministerio mantendrá la senda de negociación, diálogo y acuerdo con los sindicatos en estas nuevas funciones», ha señalado.\nPara leer más",

    "title": "3D Printer Software May Alert Authorities to What You're Building",
    "text": "I've long heralded the rise of the 3D printer as the end of gun control. While regulating firearms was never really a viable strategy for most things beyond oppressing people, the idea of building your own firearm with easily obtained materials in the comfort of your own home. The technology opens up a ton of possibilities.\nBut printers are hardware. They don't really run by themselves. They need software in order to work, and according to a piece by our friends at The Truth About Guns, that's where we're now going to run into a problem.\nSoftware makers have solidified their place as useful idiots for the anti-Second Amendment agenda by leading the charge when it comes to the development of programs that detect gun parts being made by 3D printers, block those prints and in some cases, automatically notify the authorities. Claiming that these advances are\n[aimed at curbing the illegal printing of firearms]and firearms parts, these companies have donned their brown shirts a bit too quickly and have not the first clue regarding the tradition and constitutionality of homemade guns in America.Cloud-based 3D printing management platform 3DPrinterOS has partnered with Montclair State University to develop an algorithm that identifies the 3D printing of firearm parts, but they are not the first. Print&Go recently launched a software system designed to block 3D-printed production of firearms called 3D GUN’T. What this software does not offer before it invades your privacy and tells you what you can and can’t do in your home on the equipment you paid hard-earned money for is detect whether or not you are a prohibited individual, that is a person who’s record prohibits them from legally purchasing or possessing a firearm.\n...\nPrint&Go claims 3D GUN’T is designed to prevent the illegal manufacture of firearms via 3D printers, however, if a law-abiding citizen in a free state (actual America) chooses to manufacture a gun at home using their 3D printer, how does 3D GUN’T distinguish between this user and a criminal? It doesn’t. The software treats all Americans as criminals, deploying advanced algorithms to analyze CAD files, sent remotely or loaded via USB, and detect components that resemble firearm designs, immediately blocking print jobs that match these items in its extensive database. Additional use of artificial intelligence (AI) recognizes new or modified gun designs, keeping the software adaptive to emerging freedom and helping to stifle it.\n3D GUN'T also logs details of the prints and creates an \"audit trail\" as well as apparently takes pictures of what's being printed.\nBut, as noted, this is billed as a way to prevent the illegal printing of firearms, but it doesn't do background checks and there's no indication that it even pays any attention to what state someone is in.\nThere's another problem, though, and that's in the fact that there's no restriction to this technology being sold abroad.\nRight now, we have the right to keep and bear arms. We can buy traditionally manufactured guns and can still buy kits and make them ourselves if we so desire. Those who use 3D printers are doing it just because they like it.\nNot everywhere is like that.\n3D printers allow people to manufacture firearms that can be used to overthrow tyrants. It allows regular people access to arms that they can then use to resist oppressive regimes, and these turdnuggets just created software that will likely be used to prevent just that.\nAnd then we have the idea that our own printers won't print what we tell them to print because some Silicon Valley wanker decided guns were too scary to build.\nIf there's an upside, it's that there's going to be someone to offer an alternative software that won't do any of this. That's what you use and relegate this crap to the dustbin of history.",
