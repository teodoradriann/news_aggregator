    "text": "Seismic has announced its Winter 2025 Product Release, introducing new AI-assisted solutions to support revenue leaders and their teams in enhancing efficiency and alignment across go-to-market (GTM) operations.\nThe Winter 2025 Release includes features such as \"Aura Copilot,\" which now integrates with Slack and Microsoft Teams to deliver real-time responses within these platforms. This service aims to streamline customer engagement processes by enabling representatives to access information more efficiently.\nFlexible page layouts have been introduced to enhance content accessibility for sellers, allowing marketing and enablement teams to design pages that better organise information. This is intended to aid sellers in locating necessary resources swiftly, and teams can now use Aura Copilot to accelerate page creation in multiple languages.\nEnhancements to Seismic Programs have been made with the introduction of advanced analytics and programme management tools. These updates aim to offer deeper insights into the impact of enablement initiatives, showcasing clearer rep behaviour and programme effectiveness.\nSeismic for Meetings includes AI-powered features to expedite deal cycles by providing intelligent meeting summaries and key takeaways, facilitating the review of calls and identification of subsequent steps.\nLastly, enhancements to Seismic Skills introduce more intuitive dashboards and expanded assessment options. These improvements are designed to provide better visibility into individual rep progress, contributing to more effective skill development and coaching programs.\nAlex Josephs, Director of Sales Enablement Experience at IBM, spoke on the impact of Seismic Pages on their enablement strategy. Josephs said, \"At IBM, we rely on Seismic Pages as the foundation of our enablement strategy, ensuring sellers and business partners have access to consistent, easily navigable sales kits. These kits form the backbone of our Seismic implementation, with a handful of active sales plays guiding our most strategic go-to-market initiatives. These plays, built entirely on Pages, are easily accessible and help align sellers on high-priority products and campaigns. All of it is built on Pages, and it's core to what we do with Seismic.\"\nIn a recent report by Seismic, it was revealed that 95% of GTM leaders experienced improved efficiency, alongside 90% reporting faster time to market and 88% acknowledging optimised operations after integrating AI-powered tools into their processes.\nChief Product Officer at Seismic, Krish Mantripragada, stated, \"Effective enablement is about connecting strategy to execution – but it shouldn't stop there. Revenue leaders must also clearly articulate enablement ROI and be able to scale top behaviours and content across teams and business units. The Seismic Enablement Cloud is the only all-in-one enablement platform for revenue teams to align GTM priorities, centralise insights, and gain full visibility into how enablement programmes impact business outcomes.\"\nThe Winter 2025 Release by Seismic follows the company's recognition in G2's 2025 list of Best Sales Software. Additionally, Seismic recently announced the return of its Seismic City Tours, a series of industry events open to the global enablement community, including its customers and partners, taking place in cities such as London, New York City, and Sydney.",

    "text": "Saudi Arabia Implements New Labor Policies Targeting Yemeni Workers Saudi Arabia has implemented new regulations designed to regulate its substantial labor market, with a particular focus on Yemeni workers. The Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development has issued a decision prohibiting Yemenis from working in numerous professions, citing the need to prioritize jobs for Saudi citizens.\nList of Restricted Professions for Yemeni Workers: The newly imposed restrictions cover a wide range of sectors, barring Yemenis from holding positions such as:\nHealth professionals: This includes all nursing and pharmacy roles, as well as other healthcare sub-specialties.\nEngineering: Yemenis are no longer eligible to work in any engineering department or its specialized fields.\nPublic Sector: Employment within the government or public sector is now prohibited for Yemeni nationals.\nFinancial and Legal: Yemenis are restricted from working in financial and legal sectors, encompassing roles like accountants and lawyers.\nEducation and Media: Professions in teaching and media, across various branches and specializations, are also off-limits. Occupations Open to Yemeni Workers:\nThe Ministry reaffirms that Yemenis are permitted to work in other essential sectors, including:\nAgriculture and Livestock: Roles such as sheep herders, livestock breeders, and other agricultural specialists are open to Yemenis.\nConstruction: Yemeni workers are still eligible for positions within the construction industry, including painters, blacksmiths, carpenters, and other skilled trades.\nHigher Education : Yemenis can continue to work in higher education institutions and universities, contributing to various teaching and specialized roles.\nHandicrafts and Services: Yemeni nationals can find employment in fields such as janitorial services, kitchen assistance, sales, jewelry making, as well as other essential service sectors.\nInformation Technology: The Ministry encourages Yemeni workers to pursue opportunities in the ever-evolving field of information technology.\nHealthcare (Specialized Roles): While certain healthcare professions are restricted, Yemeni individuals can still pursue specialized roles within the medical sector.\nThe Saudi Arabian government maintains\nthat these new regulations are aimed at ensuring equitable employment opportunities for its citizens and balancing the needs of its diverse workforce.\nPlease note: This is a reimagined news article created specifically for a U.S. audience. It incorporates the original information while making it more accessible and relevant to American readers.\n2024-11-30 23:00:00\n#Officially #urgently #decision #prevent #Yemenis #working #professions #beginning #Saudi #Arabia #full #information\n## Saudia ‍Arabia’s⁤ New Labor Policies:⁢ Is‌ It Justice or ⁣Exploitation?\n**An Interview wiht Dr. Layla Ahmed, Migration⁤ and Labor Rights Expert**\n**World today News:** Saudi Arabia recently implemented new labor regulations‌ targeting Yemeni workers, sparking international scrutiny. Dr. Layla Ahmed, a leading expert on migration and labor rights in​ the Middle ‍East, joins us today to discuss the implications of these policies. Welcome, Dr.‌ Ahmed.\n**Dr. Ahmed:** Thank you for ⁢having me.\n**World Today News:** ‍Could you briefly⁢ summarize the key changes in these​ new regulations?\n**Dr.‍ Ahmed:** The new ⁢regulations primarily affect Yemeni workers by ⁣reducing the⁤ number of⁢ sectors they can work in, while introducing stricter visa⁤ requirements and tightening border controls. Essentially, ‍these policies aim to limit the influx of Yemeni‍ laborers into Saudi Arabia.\n**World Today news:** Why has Saudi ⁤Arabia implemented these changes? What ‍are the ‍stated justifications?\n**Dr.Ahmed:** The Saudi government claims these ‍measures are necessary to address concerns about unemployment amongst ‍Saudi citizens and ‍to regulate the large influx of foreign labor, notably given the ongoing economic challenges in the region.\n**World Today News:** Critics ‌argue that these ⁤policies specifically target Yemeni workers due to the ongoing conflict in Yemen ‍and the desperation of its people. What is your take on this?\n**Dr. Ahmed:** There’s undoubtedly a geopolitical​ element to ⁣these regulations. Yemeni migrants are particularly vulnerable ⁤due ⁣to the​ war’s devastation​ and thier urgent‍ need for ⁢work and safety.​ The timing and targeted nature of these‌ policies raise ⁤serious concerns about their motivations. While Saudi Arabia claims to prioritize its citizens’ employment,‍ these policies arguably exploit the vulnerability of Yemeni⁤ workers.\n**World Today News:** ⁣What are the potential consequences​ of these regulations on Yemeni laborers and their families?\n**Dr. ‍Ahmed:** The impact will be devastating.‌ Many ​Yemenis rely on‌ remittances from relatives ⁢working in⁤ Saudi Arabia to survive. These stricter regulations will cut ⁣off crucial lifelines for families struggling amidst ‌the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, ⁣exacerbating poverty and instability.\n**World Today News:** What are‍ the ‌implications for the region as a whole? Will other Gulf‌ countries follow suit?\n**Dr. ⁣Ahmed:** These policies⁣ could ​have ⁤a ⁢domino effect, with other Gulf states​ potentially adopting similar restrictions on migrant labor from Yemen, further jeopardizing regional ⁢stability and humanitarian efforts.This highlights ⁤the need for a coordinated international response to ensure⁢ the protection of vulnerable migrants and uphold their basic rights.\n**World Today News:**‍ What recommendations would ⁢you offer to‍ international organizations and governments regarding this situation?\n**dr. Ahmed:** The international community must pressure Saudi Arabia to revise these discriminatory policies‍ and ensure they adhere to international labor standards. Furthermore,supporting humanitarian efforts in Yemen and promoting lasting economic growth in the⁢ region are vital steps to address the root causes of this crisis.\n**World ​Today News:** Dr. Ahmed, thank you for your insightful​ analysis.This a‍ crucial issue that demands continued attention and ‍action.",

    "title": "How history, race and politics divide Tennessee on gun legislation | U.S. & World | gazette.com",
    "text": "By Donna Bryson (Reuters) - Photographs can say a lot without words. After a school shooting in Tennessee, they recorded the frustrations of parents and state legislators whose cries for gun control were silenced. In one photo, it’s almost possible to hear Representative Justin Pearson’s measured tones as he stands in prayer with one hand raised at the Capitol following a legislative session that failed to change any gun laws. In March, a former student at the Covenant School in Nashville killed three 9-year-old children and three staff members. Pearson and his fellow Representative Justin Jones, both of whom are Black Democrats, were briefly expelled for leading a protest for gun control on the House of Representatives floor. A third Democrat representative, Gloria Johnson, who is white, was not expelled for her role in the protest, leading to accusations of racism. Republicans who overwhelmingly control the chamber deny they are racist and oppose anything seen as a retreat from the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment right to \"keep and bear arms.\" Cameron Sexton, the Republican who is speaker of the Tennessee House of Representatives, did not see racism as a problem to be addressed in the chamber. \"Sometimes people use that word (racism) as a drop the mic moment to try to stop people from having conversations,\" he said. Pearson represents Memphis, a city with a Black majority that has struggled to contain gun violence. Pearson has lost friends and relatives to gun violence. “When we went to the well of the House floor, it wasn’t just the Covenant kids that I was thinking about,” Pearson told Reuters. “I was thinking about the people in Memphis who are mourning every day.” Months after the protest, a special legislative session called by Tennessee’s Republican governor ended with no progress on gun safety laws. During the special session, Republican leaders banned members of the public from holding signs during proceedings and limited their access to the Capitol building. State troopers, whose presence was increased during the session, at one point ejected members of the public, including Covenant parents, from a hearing after a lawmaker said the crowd was unruly. Mary Joyce, a real estate broker whose daughter was in the Covenant classroom where three of her classmates were killed, spoke to lawmakers during the special session and took part in protests for gun control at the Capitol. \"It feels like we were just screaming under water,\" Joyce told Reuters. \"No one could hear us.\" WEIGHT OF HISTORY Johnson said gun control advocates will continue to push for change in the next legislative session, which opens in January. “I always have hope. I wouldn’t be in this business if I didn’t hope that people would listen,” said Johnson, who also is running for the U.S. Senate. “And we know that 80% of Tennesseans want to see gun sense legislation, 70% want red flag laws, 80% want safe storage laws. At some point the super majority has to start listening to the people. Because it will affect their elections.” Jack Johnson, a Republican leader in the state Senate, said his constituents do not support such gun control measures as red flag laws to temporarily remove guns from individuals who might harm themselves or others. \"Dispossessing law-abiding citizens of constitutional rights is not an answer to our violence problem in Tennessee,” Johnson said. Tennessee has laws to keep guns out of the hands of people involved in domestic violence cases. Democrats and even the Republican governor have called for broader red flag measures. Looking at the photographs, it's almost possible to hear chants for change that echo the soundtrack of civil rights era demonstrations. In the 1960s, John Lewis, then a student at the American Baptist Theological Seminary -- one of four historically Black colleges and universities in Nashville -- was a leader in the sit-in movement that ended racist discrimination at Nashville businesses such as a Woolworth’s lunch counter. It was the start of a career of challenging segregation for Lewis, who went on to represent Georgia in the U.S. Congress and have a Nashville street named for him. Lewis’s faith inspired him and infused his political rhetoric. Pearson and Jones have tapped into that tradition. And deeper. Jones read from the Bible's Book of Jeremiah – whose remonstrations fueled the abolitionist orations of Frederick Douglass – during the campaign for more gun control. \"Until we act, there will be no peace for the thousands of children who came here demanding we act, who are afraid that if they’re in school they will be gunned down because you have passed laws that make it easier to get gun than it is to get health care in this state,” Jones said on the House floor. He also walked the state house hallways carrying a child's coffin, drawing attention to the many young people affected by gun violence. A state office building located on Representative John Lewis Way offers another glimpse of history. When Sarah Shoop Neumann, a nurse whose son is a Covenant student, entered the building to testify for gun control, she was struck at the portraits of lawmakers on the walls. “It’s all white men,” she said. “Even in the recent years, it’s still not that different.” Melissa Alexander, a commercial real estate broker whose son is a Covenant student, said, “The make-up of the legislature also needs to be more diverse to represent the issues and constituencies, what the constituents want in the state of Tennessee.” Alexander along with Neumann and Joyce have organized to push for gun control. Slavery, segregation and violence have had an enduring impact on race relations, not just in the South, but across the United States. Pearson acknowledged the weight of the past. But he sees hope for a better future. “Not so much that we are able to see that future become a reality even though I pray for that, but that a hundred years from now the next kid that’s protesting that’s marching that’s fighting, they’re fighting for something different, they’re fighting for something new,” he said. “They hope and pray that the fight is worth it because there is somebody, they do not know who they were, do not know their names, who fought for them today. And that’s us.\" (Reporting by Donna Bryson; Photography by Cheney Orr, Kevin Wurm and Seth Herald; Editing by Kat Stafford and Lisa Shumaker)",

    "text": "--All CIT patients maintained platelet counts >75 x 10 9 /L at 1-week following chemotherapy plus a single dose of SCB-219M, with durable responses through at least 3-weeks--\n--Durable efficacy and PK profile expected to support convenient dosing interval of ≥2-weeks, compared to daily or weekly dosing for current treatment options in China [1] and globally [2] --\n--Phase Ⅰ b trial in CIT and CTIT (cancer treatment-induced thrombocytopenia) patients evaluating repeated dosing of SCB-219M is planned to initiate in 2024--\nCHENGDU, China , Dec. 28, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Clover Biopharmaceuticals, Ltd. (Clover; HKEX: 02197), a global commercial-stage biotechnology company, today announced positive preliminary safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics data in a Phase Ⅰ clinical trial evaluating SCB-219M, an innovative thrombopoietin receptor agonist (TPO-RA) mimetic bispecific Fc-fusion protein produced from CHO cells, for the treatment of cancer patients with chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia (CIT).\nAll cancer patients enrolled to-date (n=9) receiving chemotherapy plus a single subcutaneous dose of SCB-219M observed platelet counts maintained or recovered at >75 x 10 9 /L (threshold level for CIT) after one week, with responses durable through at least three weeks (i.e. through the chemotherapy cycle). In comparison, following administration of the same chemotherapy (but without SCB-219M) in the same cancer patients prior to enrolling into the trial, all evaluable patients had observed platelet counts drop to <75 x 10 9 /L between one and three weeks. The durable preliminary efficacy and pharmacokinetic profile observed for SCB-219M are potentially supportive of dosing intervals ≥2-weeks. If further confirmed, this profile could enable convenient dosing of SCB-219M synchronized with any given patient's chemotherapy regimen, typically 2-3 weeks per cycle. A favorable safety and tolerability profile for SCB-219M has also been observed to-date, with no serious adverse events (SAEs) and no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) identified.\nDr. Yongsheng Wang , Associate Director of West China Hospital Cancer Center at Sichuan University and Principal Investigator for the SCB-219M Phase Ⅰ Trial commented: \"We are encouraged by the Phase Ⅰ results to-date for SCB-219M, and we look forward to the continued evaluation of SCB-219M, as we believe the management of CIT remains a pressing unmet medical need for patients undergoing cancer treatment.\"\n\"We are pleased to announce positive Phase Ⅰ results for SCB-219M demonstrating rapid and durable efficacy along with a favorable safety profile,\" said Dr. Peng Liang , Chairman, Chief Scientific Officer of Clover and inventor of SCB-219M. \"The preliminary results suggest that SCB-219M has a potentially differentiated profile compared to the current standard of care treatments for CIT and CTIT. In contrast to current biologic treatment options for CIT in China requiring daily injections [1] and globally requiring weekly injections [2] , the durable efficacy and pharmacokinetics of SCB-219M observed to-date could enable convenient dosing synchronized with any given patient's chemotherapy regimen.\"\nThe Phase Ⅰ trial is a multi-center, open-label, dose escalation and dose expansion study, that is exploring the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of SCB-219M administered subcutaneously in cancer patients with CIT. In addition to West China Hospital Cancer Center at Sichuan University, other participating sites in this clinical trial include Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital and Chengdu No. 6 People's Hospital. A Phase Ⅰb trial evaluating repeated dosing of SCB-219M in CIT and CTIT patients is planned to initiate in 2024.\nCIT is a serious, chemotherapy-associated complication observed in a wide range of cancer patients. Incidence of CIT can occur in greater than 50% [3] of patients undergoing standard chemotherapy regiments, and can have detrimental impacts on treatment outcome, resulting in chemotherapy dose delay or dose reduction, and potentially fatal bleeding events.\n1.
