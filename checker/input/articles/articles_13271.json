    "text": "If there was one element of the commercial roasting equipment industry that was absolutely on fire this year, it was the one that was literally not on fire: electric heat. As we continue our [2023 Year in Review](https://dailycoffeenews.com/tag/2023-year-in-review/), nearly every story below focuses on new all-electric roasting equipment.

    "text": "A whale was sighted off the coast of Mui Dien (Dien Cape), a popular tourist destination in Phu Yen Province, south-central Vietnam, on Friday morning, a local official confirmed the same day. While operating in the waters off Mui Dien at around 8:00 am, several fishermen caught sight of a whale swimming next to their fishing boat, owned by Huynh Kim Tuong, a 50-year-old resident in the town. After notifying authorities of the sighting of the mammal, the fishermen were requested to protect the fish and not to catch it at any cost, said Pham Van Huan, deputy head of the Hoa Hiep Nam border guard office in Dong Hoa Town. Dolphins are frequently spotted in the area, but sightings of whales are rare, Huan elaborated. Nguyen Thanh Hoan, a 25-year-old native of Phu Hoa District, recounted his sighting of the whale when he was fishing off the coast of Mui Dien at about 7:00 am the same day. Dao Quang Minh, head of the provincial Fisheries Sub-Department, reckoned that this whale was moving toward the coast to hunt for food. The appearance of the sea creature in the waters off Mui Dien showed that the marine habitat in the area is home to a great source of small fish that whales mainly feed on, Minh added. “[The whale’s appearance] is good news,” Minh continued. He advised local residents to keep a safe distance from and not to catch whales if they spot the mammals.

    "text": "It might look odd now, but one day in the not-too-distant future, you might not blink twice seeing a robot sit among humans in a school line-up. As part of a robotics incursion at Engadine High School, located in Sydney, NSW, students got on the artificial intelligence (AI) bandwagon and got close to a robot with very lifelike features. Over 500 students from 16 high schools across the Sutherland Shire and St George have entered an AI Careers Immersion program this year. The initiative, supported by the Regional Industry Education Partnerships program under the NSW Department of Education, equips young people with the essential skills and knowledge to thrive in a rapidly evolving job market. Engadine High School was the first in NSW to welcome G1, a state-of-the-art humanoid robot from Unitree. As companies like BMW increasingly deploy humanoids in manufacturing, students gained hands-on exposure to the cutting edge of AI and robotics. The AI Careers Incursion program prepares students to lead in industries yet to be imagined by fostering lifelong learning and hands-on engagement with transformative technology. Trevor Adams from Regional Industry Education Partnerships emphasised the importance of such initiatives. \"In today&apos;s fast-changing job landscape, connecting students with emerging technologies and local employers as early as possible is key,\" he said. \"We know this has a massive impact on positive outcomes for students. These experiences empower students to explore future career pathways and develop the agility to adapt to evolving industries.\" The program inspired students to think critically about the impact of AI and robotics on their future. Vice Captain of Engadine High School, Holly, said: \"I don&apos;t think the question is, &apos;What jobs can we use the humanoid for?&apos; I think the question is, &apos;What jobs aren&apos;t we going to use the humanoids for?&apos; The pace of technology and diversity of jobs remain the challenge.\" Students interacted with robotic dogs and humanoid robots, diving into AI and Mechatronic Engineering. Tara, a student in the enrichment class, was intrigued. \"I was immediately very excited because the last time robots came to Engadine High with this program, we got to see quadrupeds, and this time it was a bipedal robot, so it was cool to see a humanoid, an advancement that has a lot of unknown potential,\" she said. Another student, Zac, reflected on the robot&apos;s future uses. \"I think it will be useful for things that are too dangerous for humans to do or for it to do things humans don&apos;t want to,\" he said. To further their learning, students completed AI Microskills through the TAFE Institute of Applied Technology, taking their first steps toward becoming part of a workforce ready to embrace AI-driven opportunities. They also secured opportunities to participate in Cyber Security Work Experience, leveraging their knowledge from the program to explore another critical and rapidly growing field. Engadine High School principal Kerrie Jones praised the program. \"Our students and the world they are inheriting are so very different from the world even five years ago,\" she said. We have no idea of the impact of such phenomenal technology. This will also be the next generation&apos;s challenge.\"",

    "text": "It issued a statement Saturday in reaction to a Quran burning incident in London earlier this week.\nThe statement said Al-Azhar has been monitoring events worldwide and has followed the attempt to desecrate the Quran in front of the Turkish consulate in London, el-Balad News reported.\nIt noted that the man who burned a copy of the Quran outside the Turkish consulate in central London on Thursday had previously announced his intention to do so in posts on social media networks.\nThe Egyptian center said a study of this and some other Islamophobic incidents such as the Christchurch terror attack in New Zealand shows the influence of far-right ideas that seek to spread hate and discrimination.\nSuch incidents are not beneficial for societies; rather, they have negative consequences and will intensify violence by dividing the community, Al-Azhar said.\n“This is what we witnessed in the Quran burning incident in London, where an individual’s violent interference was a response to this extremist act.\nAl-Azhar called for the enactment of laws to prevent the recurrence of such racist incidents, and the adoption of laws to control the spread of extremist ideas on social media.\nThe center also urged responsible authorities to implement awareness-raising initiatives in society and to publish educational materials that promote human values such as tolerance and peaceful coexistence among young people and groups most influenced by far-right ideologies.\nHamit Coskun, 50, from Derby, who tried to burn a Quran in London on Thursday has denied religiously motivated harassment.\nRead More:\nHe was charged following the incident near the Turkish consulate in Knightsbridge, London.\nIn a video of the incident, the Quran burner can be heard calling Muslims “terrorists” while a man yielding a knife can be seen kicking and spitting on him.\nHe also lashed out at him several times with a knife but it’s not clear if any connection was made.\n4266325",

    "text": "Cette fin de week-end offrira un petit goût d'été aux plus chanceux du Sud-Ouest.Le thermomètre pourra grimper jusqu'à 27°C du côté du Pays basque.Découvrez les prévisions de Coralie Dioum. Un dimanche ensoleillé et même un petit parfum d'été pour les plus chanceux. C'est le cas du côté de Biarritz, où l'on attend des [températures très agréables ](/environnement-ecologie/rechauffement-climatique-inquietude-apres-les-temperatures-anormalement-elevees-du-mois-de-mars-1197442.html) aujourd'hui, selon les prévisions de Coralie Dioum à retrouver dans la vidéo en tête de cet article. Écharpe au nord, lunettes de soleil dans le sud Ne vous fiez pas aux quelques nuages bien installés ce matin, la situation va vite évoluer au cours de la journée. Ils seront nombreux sur une bande centrale dans le pays, avec de la grisaille, voire quelques pluies sur la façade est. À noter, quelques entrées maritimes autour du golfe du Lion. Ailleurs en France, vous risquez d'avoir un temps très lumineux en ouvrant vos volets ce matin, et ça va continuer. Le soleil va gagner du terrain par le sud du pays, même si ce sera un petit peu plus nuageux en allant vers le nord. Du côté des températures, la situation est pour le moins contrastée. Il faudra par exemple bien se couvrir pour affronter les 5 à 6 degrés entre Brest et Cherbourg. L'écharpe ne sera en revanche pas nécessaire du côté du Grand Est ou du Sud-Est, où le mercure grimpera entre 16 et 17 degrés à Strasbourg et à Nice. Un contraste que l'on va conserver cet après-midi, où on n'attend pas plus de 12 degrés du côté de Lille. Une fraicheur au nord en opposition totale avec un temps quasiment estival dans le sud, où le thermomètre va grimper jusqu'à 27°C à Biarritz, où la journée promet d'être très douce.",
