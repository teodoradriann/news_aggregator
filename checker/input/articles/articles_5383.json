    "text": "SALT LAKE CITY (KUTV) — Say goodbye to the sunshine and 60s! The first in a series of storms will move through Utah over the weekend. This storm will issue in an unsettled, cool pattern for next week. Here's what you can expect each day. Increasing clouds with a few isolated sprinkles are expected in the late afternoon and evening across northern Utah and southwestern Wyoming. Temperatures will still warm with highs in the mid-60s in northern Utah and mid-70s down south. Mostly cloudy skies in the morning with winds picking up. By afternoon, winds are expected to be in the 15-25 mph range with gusts as high as 40 mph. Even stronger gusts will be possible in west central and southwestern Utah, and a High Wind Watch is in place there as a result. A few isolated light showers may move through northern Utah tomorrow morning, but most of the valley rain and mountain snow will hold off until the afternoon and evening. A few thunderstorms will even be possible during that timeframe as the cold front slides through western Utah. By late evening, a few snowflakes may mix in with rain. Little to no accumulation is expected along the valley floors, but the mountains could pick up 5-10\" through Saturday night. Scattered rain and snow showers will continue on-and-off through the day. Little to no accumulation is expected in the valleys from these showers. If any snow does accumulate, it will just be on non-paved surfaces. In the mountains, another 5-10\" of snow could fall during the day Sunday. Temperatures will be much cooler Sunday with highs near 50 in northern Utah and in the upper 50s down south. A few rain and snow showers will continue into Monday in northern Utah as another little disturbance clips the state. Southern Utah will stay dry. Temperatures will be well below normal for late March with highs near 50 in northern Utah and around 60 down south. The active pattern continues with another small disturbance clipping the state. This will, once again, produce a few scattered showers in northern Utah. These showers will likely produce both rain and snow, depending on the intensity of the showers. Temperatures will once again be near 50 in northern Utah and mid-60s down south. We'll get a break from the unsettled weather on Wednesday. Skies will still be a little cloudy and winds will be gusty, but it will be the driest day of the week across the state. Temperatures will get back into the 50s in northern Utah. Southern Utah will top out in the upper 60s. Yet another storm will move through the region. This storm looks mild, but pretty powerful. The valleys will get a mixture of rain and snow showers as the system is moving through the region. Southern Utah may get a few showers from this system as well. While the valleys are getting rain or a rain/snow mix, the mountains should be able to pick up some high snow totals! We will be in between storms on March 22, but another storm has its sights set on Salt Lake City for next weekend. This system will produce both rain and snow As you can see, the meteorologists in the 2News Weather Center will be busy all week long! Stay turned to the 2News Weather Team as we bring you updates on this active pattern through the weekend and into next week.",

    "text": "One man’s breast cancer diagnosis inspires groundbreaking treatment tool [View gallery - 3 images](#gallery:1) Being diagnosed with potentially fatal metastatic breast cancer inspired one man to gather a team of diverse professionals to create an AI-based tool that analyzes a patient’s symptoms using a smartphone, providing oncologists with a means of providing an individualized treatment care plan to patients with metastatic cancer. When Christopher Gregg was diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic breast cancer in 2018, he started thinking of ways of improving his – and others’ – cancer treatments. A neurobiology and human genetics professor at the University of Utah and member of the University’s Huntsman Cancer Institute, Gregg assembled a 20-strong team to create a tool to help oncologists decide the right treatment path for patients with metastatic cancer. “On the first day, we decided to make a tool that would help oncologists determine the right medication dose and treatment for each individual patient, giving them both the best chance at eliminating the cancer and the best quality of life,” Gregg said. “One of the biggest challenges for cancer treatment is that the drugs are toxic, so not only do we need to factor in the disease response but also how much of the medication their body can handle for a specific amount of time.” Although breast cancer rates are higher for women, the [American Cancer Society](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/breast-cancer-in-men/about/key-statistics.html) (ACS) estimates that, by the end of 2023, about 2,800 men in the US will have been diagnosed with invasive breast cancer and around 530 will die from it. When cancer is first discovered, doctors ‘stage’ it from zero to 4. Stage 4 cancer, which is what Gregg was diagnosed with, means the cancer has spread to distant parts of the body. The goal of treatment for metastatic cancer is often to slow or stop its spread. Treatment can include hormone therapy, chemo, targeted therapy and immunotherapy, as well as surgery. Using the data from his own cancer treatment, Gregg and his team created a prototype AI algorithm that captures information about patient symptoms via a smartphone. Accurately measuring over 20,000 ‘micro-symptoms’ in behavior, speech, and vocal patterns ranging from abnormal neurological phenotypes and eye movements to sadness in the vocal tone, the AI assesses how patients are faring during their treatment and predicts changes to future symptoms. Oncologists can use these predictions to adjust a patient’s treatment, avoiding drug toxicity and dangerous side effects. In effect, the AI-based tool provides a tailored treatment plan for each patient and is designed to assist with any cancer treatment, not just treatment for breast cancer. Gregg and the team’s tool won first prize at this year’s 11th annual [Moffitt Cancer Center Integrated Mathematical Oncology (IMO) workshop](https://endeavor.moffitt.org/archive/steering-cancer-evolution-with-global-collaboration), where mathematicians, researchers and clinicians from around the world gather to find innovative solutions for cancer treatment and care. “My team at the Moffitt Cancer Center competition included 20 diverse experts from around the world,” Gregg said. “Expert mathematicians, researchers, software developers, and clinicians worked together to create a solution for metastatic cancer care. The amazing this about this workshop is that it creates an environment that fosters collaboration between those who may not usually work together.” As competition winners, the team received a US$50,000 grant, which they’ll use to continue to develop the tool. A clinical trial of the tool is scheduled to start in January 2024 at the Moffitt Cancer Center. But Gregg didn’t stop at developing a groundbreaking tool to aid metastatic cancer care and treatment. “When I was diagnosed, I asked my oncologist at Huntsman Cancer Institute if there were any exciting new treatments that could be curative,” Gregg said. “She said after a long career in oncology, she’s seen many ideas and new medicines that didn’t turn out to be curative. She thought the solution would come from learning how to use the medications we already have in a better way. I started to shift my attention that way.” Typically, if a patient with cancer responds positively to treatment, it’s given regularly. However, over time, cancer cells evolve to become treatment-resistant, necessitating the introduction of a new treatment. In so-called extinction therapy, additional therapeutic agents are introduced in relatively quick succession. The goal is to cure the patient while never using a drug long enough to permit the evolution of resistance. Extinction therapy formed the basis of Gregg’s first cancer treatment plan and has worked to effectively keep treatment resistance in check since his 2018 diagnosis. “I’m doing really well right now,” said Gregg. “I’ve continued to innovate and come up with ideas to control the disease. I’ve been off treatment for many months at a time and successfully been able to keep the disease stable. My goal is turning metastatic cancer, which is currently a lethal disease, into a manageable chronic disease that offers patients a high quality of life for a long time.” Source: [Huntsman Cancer Institute](https://healthcare.utah.edu/huntsmancancerinstitute/press-releases/2023/12/male-breast-cancer-diagnosis-fuels-groundbreaking-treatment-tool) [View gallery - 3 images](#gallery:1)",

    "text": "LAHORE: The Shaukat Khanum Memorial Trust (SKMT) has launched its Zakat collection campaign this year with the theme “Their Lives Depend On It,” which aims to highlight the vital role philanthropy plays in supporting treatment of cancer for all patients, especially children. On this occasion, Dr Faisal Sultan, CEO of SKMT, said that a cancer diagnosis brings multiple challenges, including emotional and financial costs associated with treatment. He explained, “At our hospitals in Lahore and Peshawar, we provide all-encompassing care to our patients, including physical and psychological support. Over the last 29 years, support of generous donors has enabled SKMT to provide quality treatment to deserving cancer patients, irrespective of their ability to pay.” Dr Faisal Sultan also commented on the impact of charity given to SKMT last year, “In 2023, the generous support of people enabled us to provide free of charge treatment worth Rs13 billion to over 75 percent of our cancer patients. The proportion of Zakat in this was over fifty percent, which shows that Zakat plays a crucial role in funding treatment of needy cancer patients and it is not enough in itself to cover the costs of direct patient care. Zakat is utilised on the treatment of eligible patients only based on a consistent and fair methodology. Shaukat Khanum Memorial Trust is also independently certified for Shariah compliance, confirming that the framework we follow for collection, utilisation, and management of Zakat funds is in line with Islamic principles. The entire amount collected in the form of Zakat is completely exhausted in providing direct patient care within the same year. During the ongoing economic situation, more people are expected to need financially supported treatment. In these circumstances, your support can play a crucial role in saving lives. We hope that Pakistanis from around the world will give their Zakat to Shaukat Khanum Hospitals for patients fighting cancer because their lives depend on it.\" Representational image of degree and mortarboard. — PixabayLAHORE: Another traffic warden of City Traffic Police...

    "text": "As wars rage across the Middle East and Ukraine , the prospect for a more peaceful year in 2024 remains bleak.\nGlobal rivals have taken sides, linking up the two main conflicts and furthering the risk of wider violence. The Israel - Hamas struggle is backed by the US -led West, with Iran providing aid to Israel’s foes, including Hamas and Hezbollah. Russia is thought to have done deals with Iran and China – and even North Korea . And the UK and the rest of NATO is supporting Kyiv’s struggle for survival against Moscow’s invasion.\nExperts fear the Red Sea will be a new focus of trouble, due to Iran-backed Houthis attacking Western shipping. And Iran yesterday underlined its goal of wiping out Israel after one of its top commanders was killed in a strike on Syrian capital Damascus. It came as Israel tries to stop Iran giving arms to terrorists attacking it.\nHere, we analyse the main conflicts and risks directly affecting the UK...\nIsrael/Gaza Israel’s war against Hamas is set to rage past the summer.\nBut the US is desperate to persuade it not to launch ground attacks on Hezbollah on its northern frontier, which could explode if the West Bank, Lebanon, Iran and its proxies in Yemen hit back.\nThe diplomacy push is hampered by PM Benjamin Netanyahu’s right-wing government and its stance following the October Hamas atrocities against civilians.\nUkraine Ukraine is struggling to make significant inroads in its counter-offensive but Russia’s forces have taken an almighty beating.\nWinter slows fighting but Kyiv now has F16 jets and superior missiles.\nThis advantage could mean victory or at least force Putin to offer a deal.\nA compromise would mean Kyiv losing territory but allow both sides to celebrate a partial victory.\nNorth Korea Kim Jong-un has again told his military to “accelerate” war preparations and is likely to continue weapons testing.\nThis is likely a bluff by the dictator, rather than a serious threat – but the US, which has more than 25,000 troops in South Korea, is monitoring the situation.\nWhile the West does not really know Kim’s intentions – and this prediction could bite back – nuclear-armed North Korea remains a sideshow.\nChina Intelligence agencies say while Russia is like a storm to be dealt with now, China is a longer-term threat more akin to climate change.\nBeijing’s ambition to re-absorb Taiwan is probably not possible for a few years, so a Chinese assault on the island nation remains very unlikely in 2024.\nBut if and when it comes, the conflict will be bloody for both sides and change the geopolitical landscape.\nIran Iran is a headache for US as it supports the terror groups fighting and threatening Israel – Hamas, Hezbollah and the Yemeni Houthis.\nThe Houthi drones threat to Red Sea shipping must be tackled and the US has updated plans for attacking Iran directly. Yesterday, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp vowed to wipe out Israel after the burial of Razi Mousavi, a general killed in an air strike in Syria.\nGuyana The UK is sending warship HMS Trent to support the ex-colony against a threat from Venezuela, which aims to annex the oil and mineral-rich Essequibo region.\nWith Guyana booming and Venezuela’s economy ailing, the latter’s President Maduro is under pressure, so this is one to watch. Israel’s war against Hamas is set to rage past the summer.\nBut the US is desperate to persuade it not to launch ground attacks on Hezbollah on its northern frontier, which could explode if the West Bank, Lebanon, Iran and its proxies in Yemen hit back.\nThe diplomacy push is hampered by PM Benjamin Netanyahu’s right-wing government and its stance following the October Hamas atrocities against civilians.",
