    "title": "On V-E Day, let’s remember Europe’s gratitude for U.S. military support | The American Legion",
    "text": "At 87, I have lived through many epic world events, from the aftermath of the Great Depression to World War II and the horrors of the Holocaust. Over time, I’ve observed that our nation’s divisions over the U.S. role in armed conflicts overseas have become increasingly bitter and deep. Not since Vietnam have we seen such rage and controversy about U.S. involvement in wars abroad as we’re seeing today.\nSome who oppose involvement would prefer to see conflicts resolved through diplomacy and negotiation. Others view the United States as aligning with the wrong side of history and want nothing short of a complete policy reversal. This is especially true when it comes to the Israel-Gaza war. Regardless of the political context, an important aspect gets overlooked when we disparage U.S. military involvement abroad: The invaluable, often life-saving support it brings to nations in need, and the gratitude of those who receive it.\nIn honor of V-E Day on May 8, I call upon Americans everywhere to remember the times in history when direct U.S. military support has been a source of celebration for those on the receiving end. I for one vividly recall the joy and gratitude expressed by Europeans in the decade following the end of World War II, in which U.S. troops had helped bring about an Allied victory in Europe. During travels to Europe in the 1950s, and in particular to France – where D-Day and the battles of Omaha Beach played out – I experienced firsthand the respect, admiration and sheer appreciation European citizens had for the American soldiers who had saved their lives. And for Americans in general by association. Even more than 10 years later, it was still fresh on peoples’ minds.\nI recall how people would approach me, smiling broadly, reaching to vigorously shake my hand. “An American!” They would exclaim with awe. “Thank you! Thank you!” Even though I was too young to have fought in the war, men, women and youngsters would stop what they were doing to tell me, in broken English, what they were doing before D-Day, on it, and afterward when their lives were transformed. They would point to the sky and recount the U.S. aircraft overhead that heralded the war’s end and portended freedom. They told stories of GIs tossing them chewing gum and chocolate bars from the back of jeeps as they drove by, and the tears of gratitude that welled in their eyes.\nMy novel “The Badger Game” – one of eight I have authored – reflects this sentiment in scenes set on Omaha Beach during that fateful battle and at the Normandy American Cemetery, where a bronze statue of an unknown American soldier with his arm and rifle pointing skyward pays tribute to the American troops who helped end the war.\nWar is always controversial. There are good guys and bad guys. There are winners and losers. Tax dollars spent. As the world’s leading military power, the United States will inevitably find itself at the crosshairs, time and again, of opposing opinions worldwide. But that must not prevent us from honoring the good that comes from intervening to protect U.S. allies, respond to acts of aggression, prevent terrorism or stop the spread of weapons of mass destruction. Actions aimed at these specific goals are overwhelmingly favored by public opinion.\nOn V-E Day, let’s recall Europe’s gratitude at the end of World War II as a way to remember and honor the positive impact our actions can have. ** About Norman Shabel Norman Shabel is the author of eight novels, praised by Judge Andrew P. Napolitano as “terrific, fast-paced reads about the dark side of law enforcement and the judiciary.” Many of his stories are inspired by his 55-year career as a plaintiff’s attorney and prosecutor, where he witnessed injustice and oppression on a daily basis; others draw on his experiences of Jewish family life and his astute observations of its unique, often hilarious, dynamics. Also a prolific playwright, Shabel has written seven plays, three of which have been produced off-Broadway in New York City, Philadelphia and Florida to rave reviews. Born in Brooklyn, N.Y., Norman is retired from law and splits his time between New Jersey and Florida. He finds much joy spending time with his adult children and grandchildren.",

    "text": "Court Nullifies PDP's Candidacy in Ebonyi South Bye-Election: Onu Alleges Political Motivation\nHuman Rights Alarm Over Military Deployment for Election Security in El Salvador\nEl Salvador, a nation with a history of armed conflict, teeters on the brink of a contentious electoral process. Human rights organizations have raised alarm bells over the deployment of military personnel for security tasks during the elections set for February 4 and the upcoming municipal elections in March. By law, only the National Civil Police (PNC), with 22 thousand members active on voting day, should be tasked with security duties. Yet, military forces have been spotted in various locations in the capital, including near Cuscatlán Park, around Rosales Hospital, and in parts of the historic center.\nMilitary Involvement in Public Security: A Cause for Concern\nGabriela Santos, director of the Human Rights Institute of the UCA (Idhuca), has expressed disquiet about the military’s involvement in public security. She fears that this action could cultivate an environment of fear, intimidation, and potential repression. Santos pointed to past instances of sexual abuse against girls and excessive use of force by the military during the emergency regime, indicating the possible dangers of such a deployment.\nControversy Surrounding Bukele’s Presidency\nThe presidency of Nayib Bukele has been riddled with allegations of human rights abuses and power concentration. Human rights groups and advocates have voiced concerns about the authoritarian tactics employed by Bukele’s administration, which include mass detentions and the suspension of rights. Despite a decrease in the homicide rate, the long-term democratic risks associated with Bukele’s increasing control over every branch of El Salvador’s government raise serious concerns.\nDemocracy at Risk?\nWhile improved security is a positive development, the potential erosion of democratic processes and the normalization of militarized public security is worrisome. The presence of the military during an electoral process sends a strong signal about the state of democracy in El Salvador. As the country heads towards the upcoming elections, the world watches with bated breath, hoping that the rights and freedoms of the Salvadoran people are upheld, and their democratic processes remain untarnished.\nComments\nSubscribe to BNN Breaking\nSign up for our daily newsletter covering global breaking news around the world.\n[]https://bnnbreaking.com/politics/unveiling-australias-political-donation-landscape-in-2023-top-donors-and-the-quest-for-transparency/",

Her handcrafted tea types share thoughtfulness and intentionality in every cup. \"I have a tea for smiles, tears, health, real conversations,\" described Mitchell. \"I really believe that tea time gives you the power to slow down.\" Teas with Meaning began in 2018 following Mitchell's cancer diagnosis. The news lead her to discover the wellness benefits of various herbs found in tea. \"I have friends who have land in Mount Shasta, California, so I went there to kind of just grieve and process the news,\" recalled Mitchell. \"In the midst of processing the news, it was the first day of fall, so I recognized that we have everything we need around us...there was just a lot of harvest.\" She added, \"I just took the time to learn more about the things that I would need on the spiritual and physical journey to fight the battle of cancer.\" Mitchell started one cup of tea at a time, creating organic loose leaf teas and nourishing tea-infused products with magic and meaning as the main ingredients. One of her most popular offerings is \"DiviniTea,\" a black tea blend popular for invigorating the mind, body, and spirit. \"I tell people it's better than your favorite chai, and I mean that,\" Mitchell said about DiviniTea. \"You can see the grapefruit, you can see the orange, you can see the cardamom.\" The process for creating the renowned blends revolves around seasonal ingredients. \"We focus on the quality of ingredients,\" shared Mitchell. \"We also focus on what is available organically and ethically sourced.\" She continued, \"I started to create a blend a month just to get the community's feedback, as well as to learn more about what the community needs.\" Teas with Meaning regularly teams up with the community to foster creativity and share food and drink with purpose. \"I've collaborated with over 30 Black-owned, minority-owned businesses in the past 6 years,\" Mitchell said. Her most recent project, in collaboration with Visit Oakland, showcases a tea blend that best represents the neighborhoods within The Town. \"With each blend and each neighborhood, I took the time to talk to Oakland natives in those communities to see what they thought tea time would represent for their neighborhood,\" stated Mitchell. \"With the support, help, and push of Visit Oakland, I created 'The Town Teas.'\" Mitchell doesn't consider herself a business owner, but instead refers to herself proudly as the \"Tea Lady.\" \"Tea lady with a passion,\" she said. \"To have my own business reminds me of what the power of community is.\" For more information, visit here and follow @teaswithmeaning on Instagram.",

    "title": "Rams must bring back key veteran in wake of Derion Kendrick injury",
    "text": "The [Los Angeles Rams](https://www.turfshowtimes.com/) were dealt a tough blow after [cornerback Derion Kendrick reportedly tore his ACL](https://www.turfshowtimes.com/2024/7/25/24205941/rams-cb-injuries-derion-kendrick-tre-white). LA’s secondary was already stretched thin entering training camp and Kendrick likely being lost for the year further puts the unit in a bind. While the news is undoubtedly painful for the Rams, Les Snead must make the right move by reuniting with Ahkello Witherspoon. I pray Derion Kendrick did not tear his ACL…Just an awful awful injury and really unfortunate if so. With that said this would be a significant loss.— JAKE ELLENBOGEN (@JKBOGEN) [#Rams]need depth. Felt Ahkello Witherspoon was needed back on the roster before this. Now? Get him back PRONTO! [July 25, 2024] To echo the words of TST’s own Jake Ellenbogen — GET WITHERSPOON BACK PRONTO! The eight-year veteran was an underrated addition for Los Angeles after coming over from the [Steelers](https://www.behindthesteelcurtain.com/). Witherspoon recorded career highs in combined tackles (52), passes defensed (14), interceptions (3) and fumbles recovered (2) [in 17 regular season starts](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/W/WithAh00.htm). He realistically could have been a [Pro Bowl](http://www.sbnation.com/nfl-pro-bowl) alternate during his lone season in Hollywood. The Colorado product played lights out for a Rams team that needed a spark in the secondary. Now, Witherspoon might be called upon again on short notice to hold down the fort with Kendrick sidelined. Bringing him back is really the only right answer to this problem. There will be plenty of name dropping until Snead can find a suitable replacement. One big-name free agent who could be a solution is [Super Bowl](https://www.sbnation.com/super-bowl) champ and 2019 Defensive Player of the Year, Stephon Gilmore. Despite closing in on his mid-30s, Gilmore has remained quite productive at his age. Including the postseason, Gilmore has started 34 games [since the start of the 2022 campaign](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/G/GilmSt00.htm) and snagged two interceptions in back-to-back years with the Colts and Cowboys. The vet got absolutely cooked against the [Packers](https://www.acmepackingcompany.com/) in last year’s playoffs, which could amount to being a victim of the Cowboys’ postseason curse. Another option much closer to home is Tre Tomlinson [who played just 5% of the defensive snaps](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/H/HodgTr00.htm) in his rookie campaign. An in-house option like Tomlinson might be an attraction option, yet a risky one at that if the second-year defender isn’t up to the task. Better to be safe than sorry when it comes to the secondary. Signing an All-Pro talent off the open market has got to be tempting for Snead, but the only logical move is for LA to reunite with Ahkello Witherspoon. Someone with knowledge of the system is invaluable and it could be argued that the Rams should have never let him slip away to begin with.",

    "text": "Vivianne Miedema deals Chelsea first defeat of season as Man City seize first-leg lead\nManchester City 2-0 Chelsea: A double off the bench from the Dutchwoman ended Sonia Bompastor’s 28-game unbeaten start as Chelsea manager\nSubstitute Vivianne Miedema scored a brace as Manchester City inflicted Chelsea's first defeat of the season by beating them 2-0 in their Champions League quarter-final first leg at the Joie Stadium.\nMiedema, having come off the bench for the start of the second half, put City in front on the hour mark, rifling in the rebound when Hannah Hampton tipped Laia Aleixandri's header against the crossbar.\nAnd after Chelsea substitute Johanna Rytting Kaneryd had struck the bar at the other end in the 80th minute, Miedema added her second with two minutes of normal time remaining to give City a two-goal advantage heading into next Thursday's second leg at Stamford Bridge.\nThat match will complete a series of four successive meetings between the sides, which started with Chelsea's 2-1 triumph on Saturday in the League Cup final at Pride Park that gave them their first trophy under boss Sonia Bompastor.\nThey have now suffered a maiden loss of the Frenchwoman's tenure, ending an unbeaten run of 28 games since she took charge last summer - of which 26 were wins - and 31 matches in total.\nCity, meanwhile, have a first win of Nick Cushing's interim tenure after he replaced Gareth Taylor ahead of the quartet of fixtures, which continues with Sunday's Women's Super League clash at the Etihad Stadium.\nWith Khadija Shaw and Aoba Fujino dropping out having come off with injuries in Saturday's contest, Kerolin and 19-year-old Lily Murphy came into City's starting attack, while Cushing also opted to replace Miedema with Jess Park.\nBompastor made two changes which included former City midfielder Keira Walsh returning to Chelsea's line-up after three games out.\nCushing had spoken about Saturday's result serving as \"fuel\" for his team, and City started brightly as Kerolin shot over and Jill Roord's strike was gathered by Hampton.\nChelsea registered an attempt with Nathalie Bjorn's header being saved by Ayaka Yamashita before Hampton was called upon again twice in quick succession just prior to the half-hour, dealing with efforts from Murphy and Mary Fowler.\nA Chelsea burst forward soon after ended with Catarina Macario heading over from Lauren James' cross, and the opening stages of the second half saw efforts from James and Roord saved.\nCity then broke the deadlock when Aleixandri sent a header goalwards from Fowler's delivery, Hampton did well to divert it against the woodwork and Miedema, who had replaced Murphy at the break, was on hand to crack the loose ball home from close range.\nAfter Miedema saw a further shot parried by Hampton, Chelsea had the ball in the net in the 71st minute as Mayra Ramirez slotted in, but the flag went up for offside.\nThe visitors continued to push for a leveller and Rytting Kaneryd's shot came back off the upright and fellow substitute Weike Kaptein saw an effort parried by Yamashita, before Miedema struck again as stoppage time drew near, slotting into the corner having been fed by Kerolin.\n“This should be our standard,” the Dutch striker told TNT Sports after the win. “We were really disappointed after the game on Saturday. We have had some special Champions League nights here and this one really sums it all up.\n\"I'm really happy that I came on. It's not bad, we all want to play Champions League. Today is special and hopefully we can put in the same performance next week. We have been getting a lot of knocks everywhere, we are missing a lot of players and I'm happy we got this result today.
