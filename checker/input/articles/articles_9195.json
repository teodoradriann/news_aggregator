    "text": "Saints' Kamara unlikely to play MNF, Rattler to start\nNew Orleans Saints running back Alvin Kamara is unlikely to play Monday night against the Green Bay Packers because of a groin injury, interim head coach Darren Rizzi said Thursday, per NFL Network's Tom Pelissero.\nKamara's injury is still being evaluated but it could be a season-ending ailment, sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter.\nRizzi also announced that Spencer Rattler will start at quarterback.\nKamara has tallied 950 yards and six touchdowns as a runner along with 543 yards and another two scores as a receiver this season. The five-time Pro Bowler has never posted 1,000 rushing yards in a single season.\nKendre Miller is expected to operate as the team's top runner with Kamara sidelined. Jamaal Williams and Jordan Mims could also see an uptick in playing time.\nRattler, meanwhile, will start over Jake Haener. Haener made his first career start against the Washington Commanders last week and completed 4 of 10 passes for 49 yards with an interception.\nRattler has thrown for 706 yards with two touchdowns and two interceptions this season. He's appeared in four games with three starts.\nWide receiver Chris Olave had his 21-day practice window opened to return from injured reserve but isn't expected to play Monday, Rizzi told reporters, including NewOrleans.Football's Mike Triplett. Olave hasn't played since sustaining his second concussion of the campaign Nov. 3.",
