Lignes d’Azur : tram bloqué, circulation perturbée, ce qu’il s’est passé\nUne journée noire sur les routes ce samedi Le départ des vacances risque de mettre la pagaille sur les routes ce week-end. Bison Futé prévient : tout le territoire national, dont les Alpes-Maritimes, a été classé en noir ce samedi, soit une « circulation extrêmement difficile » annoncée.\n« Dès le début de la matinée et jusqu’en fin de soirée, les axes desservant les régions côtières et frontalières du pays ainsi que les différents lieux de villégiature seront très fortement fréquentés », note le prévisionniste. Particulièrement l’autoroute A8 , qui accueillera « un nombre exceptionnel de véhicules ».\nÀ noter également que l’accès à l’Italie peut s’avérer compliqué, des travaux sur l’A10 au niveau du péage de Vintimille étant en cours. La zone est souvent propice à d’importants embouteillages sur plusieurs kilomètres, dès Menton parfois.\nVidéos : en ce moment sur Actu Idem dans le sens des retours avec une circulation classée rouge, soit « très difficile » sur l’ensemble du territoire et les Alpes-Maritimes.

    "text": "Abdul-Samad Rabiu, the BUA Group Chairman, affirmed the company’s commitment to selling cement at the rate of N3,500, starting January 2024. He said this while speaking with State House Correspondents after a visit to President Bola Tinubu on Thursday in Lagos. Also, he assured that the company is committed to making the product accessible and affordable for customers despite encountering several challenges. - “You know the price that we have set will be N3,500 per bag. You know x factory of course plus VAT and then delivered to customers depending on the region. - “As you know, the factory that we have; is in Edo, and the other one is in Sokoto state. So for example, if you want us to deliver cement to you from Sokoto say to Lagos from Adamawa or to Maiduguri, the distance is quite far. - “So dependent on the distance and dependent on the location. You know the price changes but we intend to keep that promise,” he said. Rabiu also mentioned that the cement company site in Sokoto, set to be inaugurated in January 2024, is anticipated to broaden the market nationwide. - “And as we all know, the volumes that we will be having will be about six million tonnes per annum combined. And we expect those volumes to have an impact. - “Though we’re having some issues here and there, these are issues that I believe we can address and we are addressing them,” he outlined. What you should know - Earlier in September, the chairman of Bua Cement Plc, Abdul Samad Rabiu, [announced](https://nairametrics.com/2023/09/15/bua-cement-to-bring-down-cement-price-from-n5500-to-m3500-per-bag/)plans to reduce the price of cement in Nigeria from the present N5,500 to between N3,000 to N3,500. - He said this is part of its contribution to supporting the efforts of the Federal Government to bring down the prices of key commodities in the country, adding that this will enable the company to bring down the price of cement to about N3,500 per bag. - Meanwhile, a [survey](https://nairametrics.com/2023/10/11/bua-cement-still-sells-between-n5300-and-n5500-despite-price-cut/)done by Nairametrics showed that the price of cement is still sold at the initial price between N5,300 to N5,500 in some places across the country. - Responding to the development, Rabiu noted that the company still maintained its promise to sell at the announced price, adding that other external challenges have contributed to the delay in price slash.",

    "text": "Eurostar services have begun running as normal again after flooded tunnels brought 24 hours of travel chaos.\nMillions of gallons of water have been pumped out since Friday and both tunnels are now operational again with speed restrictions lifted, engineers said.\nThe first Eurostar train left London St Pancras International shortly after 8am bound for Paris but a backlog of up to 36,000 people unable to travel on Saturday will need to be cleared.\nThe problem began on Friday night when water filled tunnels near Ebbsfleet International in Kent, scuppering all high-speed services.\nWhile a normal service has resumed, Eurostar has not said it will be able to run any extra trains.\nSome passengers, whose trains were cancelled on Saturday, have been queuing at St Pancras to try and book tickets on Sunday.\nOne French family, who feared they would not be able to get home until January 2 after Saturday’s Eurostar chaos, have hailed their unexpected tickets home on Sunday as a New Year’s Eve “miracle”.\nIsobel Ram, 49, her partner Amaury Ferrero, 52, and daughter Lee Ram, 20, who live in Toulouse, will be home in time for celebrations.\nMs Ram told the PA news agency: “We spent the night in a hotel, we came back this morning and a miracle happened and they gave us three tickets for today’s Eurostar (12.30pm train).\n“We were super happy but a bit embarrassed because there was a huge queue of people waiting behind us and we didn’t want to show we got tickets, make it too obvious, in case other people didn’t. But we said a huge thank you to the lady who did the tickets for us.”\nSoutheastern Railway said its full highspeed service is now running to and from St Pancras International as normal.\nA spokesperson for HS1, which runs the track between London and the Channel Tunnel, said speed restrictions were lifted at 11am.\n“Both tunnels affected by unprecedented volumes of water yesterday were cleared of flooding overnight, allowing engineers to inspect the line to ensure the safe running of trains through the affected area.\n“We understand how frustrating this has been for passengers and apologise for the inconvenience caused at such an important time of the year.”\nAn HS1 spokesman said the cause of the flooding will be investigated but added there is no evidence to suggest it was caused by a burst pipe feeding the tunnel’s fire safety system as had previously been suggested by a water company.\nRichard Thorp, engineering director for HS1, said he had never seen such a large volume of water in the tunnels.\nSpeaking to Times Radio, he said: “The volume of water that we had was huge, it was something that we’ve never seen before, and in my years of working on the railway I’ve never seen that volume of water before.\n“There are clearly systems in place, the tunnel is under the Thames and we expect there to be a small amount of water in the tunnel, but the pumping system we had was overwhelmed.\n“We’re talking millions of gallons here.”\nElsewhere, hundreds of trains are being cancelled on domestic routes due to staff shortages.\nNorthern Trains has issued a do not travel notice for December 31 on links from Manchester Victoria to Stalybridge, Morecambe and Heysham to Lancaster, Oxenholme to Windermere, Preston to Colne and Clitheroe to Bolton.\nThere is major disruption to Thameslink services due to staff shortages and severe weather is expected to impact some Transport for Wales services until the end of Monday.\nThe Met Office has warned there could be further disruption caused by wind and rain sweeping across the UK.\nA yellow weather warning for wind is in place.",

Resultado fez o clube ter um alívio no Campeonato Mineiro.\n\"Feliz com o resultado. Precisávamos de uma vitória e de uma resposta depois de não termos conseguido o resultado nos últimos dois jogos. E hoje conseguimos vencer marcando quatro gols, e isso foi importante para nós\", disse o argentino.\nEssa foi a primeira partida após a demissão do técnico Fernando Diniz. O argentino foi um dos únicos que postaram nas redes sociais uma homenagem ao profissional, e, no Independência, voltou a falar do assunto.\n\"Falar do Fernando hoje é difícil. Ainda há um pouco de tristeza sobre sua partida. Mas isso é futebol. Precisamos virar a página e nos concentrar no resto da temporada que acabou de começar\", completou Romero.\nÀ beira de campo, estava o auxiliar fixo da Raposa, Wesley Carvalho. Atualmente, a diretoria celeste procura um novo nome para o cargo, mas o venezuelano naturalizado português Leonardo Jardim é o mais cotado para ser contratado.",

    "text": "Skip to content\nMoro Ojomo gave ‘Inner Excellence’ to A.J. Brown. The lesser-known Eagle has his own motivational story.\n“I read it one day and had it on my heart that A.J. would like it … I think it was God. I had it on my heart to give it to him. I didn’t think it would result into what it has,” Ojomo said.\nMaybe A.J. Brown never reads a book on the sidelines if Moro Ojomo didn’t answer his door 11 years ago.\nOjomo, now an Eagles defensive tackle, didn’t go out for the football team as a freshman at Katy High School near Houston. He learned the sport after emigrating from Nigeria when he was 8, struggled, and decided he had enough after middle school.\nBut after the 2014 season started, Katy coach Gary Joseph asked the junior-high coach if there were any kids he should know about who didn’t show up for the high-school squad. The coach told Joseph about a big lineman who was two years younger than the rest of his grade. Joseph needed to go see him.\n“I went to his house and talked to him,” the coach said. “You’re intimidated when you’re that young and playing against older people. Most of those kids that were freshmen in high school were 14 or 15 and getting ready to get their driver’s license. He was 12.”\nOjomo decided to give football another chance. There was a spot for him on the team.\n“Freshman team backup,” the 23-year-old Ojomo said. “Freshman ‘B’ team backup. The fourth guy in my position.”\nOjomo didn’t know much, but he knew how to work hard thanks to two parents who moved their family from Nigeria. He made Katy’s varsity squad as a junior, blossomed into a big-time recruit as a senior, played five seasons at the University of Texas, and joined the Eagles last season as a seventh-round pick.\nAnd that’s how he was able to give Brown a copy of Inner Excellence, the motivational book that became a bestseller after Brown paged through it on the sidelines during the Birds’ postseason win over Green Bay.\n» READ MORE: A.J. Brown and the lessons from ‘Inner Excellence’ sideline book reading: ‘Clear mind and unburdened heart’\nOjomo enjoyed the book, which is author Jim Murphy’s attempt to “Train your mind for extraordinary performance and the best possible life.” He figured Brown could use a copy after listening earlier this season to an interview the wide receiver had with reporters.\n“I had the book for a while but I hadn’t actually read it,” Ojomo said. “I read it one day and had it on my heart that A.J. would like it…I think it was God. I had it on my heart to give it to him. I didn’t think it would result into what it has.”\nLearning the game\nOjomo’s father, Ololade, is a missionary and the Ojomos came to California from Africa to open a church. They lived with family near Los Angeles and Ojomo’s cousins introduced him to football.\n“They threw me in,” Ojomo said. “I went to tryouts and everyone was trying to be the quarterback. I tried to throw a football and they were like ‘Go over there.’”\nA few years later, the Ojomos moved to Texas when his father became the pastor of a holiness Pentecostal church near Houston.\n“It was unique,” Ojomo said of growing up in the church. “I think it shaped a lot of ways that I am with work ethic and attitude in life. I think faith allows you to not feel like the world’s weight is on your shoulders and allows you to move in freedom. I know that God has me regardless of whatever so it allows you to pursue anything to the best of your ability, even if you fall short you know there’s a better plan in hand.”\nOjomo was two years younger than the other kids because he started school in Nigeria when he was just three. He was young but he was big. Ojomo was a backup on Katy’s freshman “B” team but the coaches knew they had something.\n“You never give up on big kids like that,” Joseph said. “He was raw but he was athletic.”\nOjomo worked tirelessly with the team’s coaches to turn himself into a recruiter’s dream as he learned the nuisances of the defensive line.\nBig-time college coaches were soon knocking on his door just like Joseph did years earlier. The kid from Africa who didn’t know how to hold a football signed a scholarship with Texas to play on Saturdays in front of 100,000 fans.\n“I don’t think we understood the reality of it,” Ojomo said. “It was really cool.”\nInner Excellence\nOjomo was inactive for more than half the games last season and earned less than $1 million this year. But he still felt empowered to recommend a book to Brown, one of the team’s stars and the league’s third highest-paid wide receiver.\n“I don’t think anyone is too little or too big,” Ojomo said. “At the end of the day, we are a team and we need everyone. It’s cool to have that kind of dynamic.”\nBrown left the Eagles’ locker room on Wednesday carrying a stack of books. Inner Excellence, which Brown called his “recipe,” is not the only one on his shelf. Ojomo has a backpack full of books he’s reading. It may have been different to see a player page through a book on the sidelines but it wasn’t surprising for Ojomo that a football player was reading.\n“The things that sell are clickbait,” Ojomo said.\n» READ MORE: Dan Quinn helped him chase his NFL dream. This diehard Eagles fan can’t lose on Sunday.\nOjomo received Inner Excellence from DJ Giaritelli, a chaplain with Athletes in Action, a sports ministry organization. He also has a financial literacy book that defensive line coach Clint Hurtt gave to the linemen and is reading a few books about the issues of poverty. Other players had copies of Inner Excellence in their lockers. The Eagles seem to believe in the power of reading.\n“I encourage people to learn little things,” Ojomo said. “Everyone wants to put you in a box. This is what you should be doing. This is what you shouldn’t be doing. You can’t fit us in a box.”\nA chapter in Philly\nOjomo expected to be drafted in April of 2023 but that belief flattened as the day went on and his name was not called.\n“I thought it was over,” Ojomo said.\nThere were just 11 picks remaining when his phone rang. It was Howie Roseman and the Eagles were going to draft him. Roseman asked Ojomo if he wanted to come to Philly. There was silence.\n“Oh gosh,” Ojomo finally said.\nIt was hard for Ojomo to find the words. He moved to America as an 8-year-old, stumbled upon football, tried to stop playing, and then mastered the game when he gave it another try. He struggled to answer Roseman’s question as his sister screamed in the background.\n“The kids who you’re really proud for are ones who are self-made football players,” Joseph said. “They work with what they have and he’s one of those kids. He worked. It wasn’t a fluke.”\nA seventh-round pick receives little guarantee -- “Zero,” Ojomo said -- but that was fine. He just needed a chance. Ojomo played sparingly as a rookie and didn’t record a tackle until the penultimate game of the 2023 regular season. But his role increased this season and his first career sack was a pivotal one in the divisional-round win over the Los Angeles Rams. Ojomo is starting to show the promise that made a coach knock on his door.\nOf course, he wanted to come to Philly for his next chapter. The guy that gave Brown a motivational book is living a motivational story of his own.\n“Dream big,” Ojomo said. “God can do anything in your life. When you look at my story, what are the odds? The most random kid from Nigeria and his cousins are playing football. He starts playing football and now he’s in the NFL. What are the odds? A seventh-round pick makes a deep, talented defensive line like this. Just keep believing in yourself and keep working. Just try. You only get one life so why not give it 110 percent.”",
