    "title": "In deluge of protests, fuel subsidies prove hard to abolish",
    "text": "LONDON: Like thousands of Nigerians and millions of others across the developing world, higher fuel costs have irked Antonia Arosanwo. “I am angry”, the 46-year-old mother of five said at a bus stop in Lagos, the teeming commercial capital of Africa’s most populous nation. Her journey from Ojuelegba, a bustling suburb just 8 miles north of Lagos’s business district, has more than doubled in price to 700 naira (45 US cents) since the government announced an end to fuel subsidies last year -- allowing petrol prices to triple. Arosanwo’s anger mirrored that of thousands of other Nigerians, whose nationwide protests last week demanding protection from rocketing inflation, spreading hunger and dwindling jobs rattled the government. Nearly all had one core complaint: fuel prices.Across Africa -- and a string of other emerging market nations -- debt-laden governments trying to shed costly fuel subsidies are running headlong into angry populations reeling from years of increasing living costs. Egypt and Malaysia this year boosted prices to cut subsidy spending, while Bolivia’s President Luis Arce, who fended off an attempted coup in June, called this week for a referendum on fuel subsidies. The government expects gasoline and diesel subsidies to cost Bolivia some $2 billion this year. Arce, like others, faces dollar shortages and a flagging economy.“Difficult moments require firm, mature, thoughtful decisions and human beings who do not falter in the face of adversity, and this is precisely a moment of this nature,” Arce said in a speech in the Bolivian city of Sucre. But the smoke of protests is clouding governments’ hopes of ending fuel subsidies, as the same stagnating economic growth that’s punching a hole in budgets is making life harder for citizens. Leaders in Angola and Senegal are, like Nigeria, struggling to cut them.“In a situation of cost-of-living crisis and high inflation, (more expensive fuel) becomes even unbearable,” said Bismarck Rewane, chief executive of the Financial Derivatives Co in Lagos and a government economics adviser. Removing the subsidy, he said, must be phased in according to two principles – “one, what the government can afford (and) two, what the people can afford?” INTO THE FIRE Nearly every nation on earth has some form of energy subsidy, costs of which hit a record $7 trillion in 2022 -- a whopping 7.1 per cent of GDP -- according to the International Monetary Fund. Experts slam subsidies as blunt-force tools that give more to wealthy car owners than to the poor - and that they are prone to corruption and bad for the environment. The biggest spenders, according to the International Energy Agency, are Russia, Iran, China and Saudi Arabia -- countries that can, broadly, afford the costs. But for emerging countries, saddled with costly debt and still-high global interest rates, financing these is more punishing. “It’s acute now, because countries have fiscal problems,” said Chris Celio, senior economist and strategist with ProMeritum Investment Management. “And so then the question is, why do you have fiscal problems? Well, one reason is because you have this hole in your budget going to something that’s inefficient ... and you’re having problems financing it.” Nigeria’s President Bola Tinubu announced an end to subsidies after taking office last year. But when pump prices tripled, he froze them. And when the naira currency crashed, subsidies crept back -- despite higher pump prices. UNPOPULAR POLICIES Now, leaders mulling further price hikes are also nervously eyeing revolts elsewhere over unpopular economic policies. Bangladesh’s prime minister resigned after hundreds died protesting job quota changes, while Kenya’s president fired his cabinet and backtracked on tax hikes after deadly demonstrations in June. “If there was a reluctance to increase fuel prices prior to the events in Kenya ... that reluctance, if anything, is probably even higher,” said Goldman Sachs senior economist Andrew Matheny. “Politicians around the world are tuned to this cost of living crisis ... that probably does limit the willingness of policymakers to undertake reforms that, at least in the short term, might prove to be unpopular.” The image shows the head office of the Mari Petroleum Company Limited. — MPCLKARACHI: Mari Petroleum Company...

So, mark your calendar for Sunday, May 12th 2024, and start hunting for her perfect gift.\nL’Occitane, Almond Shower Oil\nTurn your mum’s\nmorning shower into an indulgent experience — just in time for winter. The L’Occitane, Almond Shower Oil ($75) has a warm, nutty scent and transforms from an oil into a silky, luxuriant lather. Mum can consider it her in-shower body lotion.\nAlpha-H, Melting Moments Cleansing Balm in Plum\nWith a sorbet texture, the\nAlpha-H, Melting Moment Cleansing Balm ($69.95) lives up to its name, dissolving impurities and makeup in one sweet sweep. This product can be used as an in-shower mask, with a gua-sha tool in front of her favourite “Midsomer Murders” ep or, as it was intended — to melt away the day. The limited edition Australian Davidson plum enriched formula has a soft berry scent making this treatment extra special.\nPortrait of a Lady, Frederic Malle\nSophisticated, glamorous, opulent and feminine — if this describes your mum then\n“Portrait of a Lady” ($563) could be her new signature scent.

Además, los Bomberos de Logroño han denunciado la situación \"crítica\" de los trabajadores del servicio y aseguraban que de cara a las fiestas de San Mateo, el servicio en los fuegos artificiales se va a cubrir con horas extras, ante la falta \"acuciante\" de personal. Y ahora, llegan las reclamaciones de los trabajadores del Parque de Servicios del Ayuntamiento de Logroño, que también reclaman mejorar sus condiciones laborales. Desde San Bernabé Ya en fechas previas a San Bernabé la plantilla amenazó con paros, pero el Ayuntamiento se comprometió a mejorar el acuerdo salarial, sin embargo, han llegado las fiestas de San Mateo y aseguran que \"todo sigue igual\". Neftalí Galilea, delegado sindical de CCOO en el Ayuntamiento de Logroño, dice que \"el acuerdo está obsoleto desde hace 23 años y lo queremos poner al día acordándolo con el Ayuntamiento. El alcalde nos prometió ya en las pasadas fiestas de San Bernabé que para estas de San Mateo iba a estar resuelto y no nos han hecho ni caso\". De cara a estas fiestas de San Mateo , los trabajadores del Parque de Servicios se han negado a hacer horas extras, y el Ayuntamiento está organizando los servicios previos a estos días a través de resoluciones de alcaldía. \"Ahora hay que hacer montaje de escenarios y después en las fiestas otras actividades como el tragantúa o poner bolardos, que nos están tocando hacer sin saber muchas veces cómo desarrollar el trabajo porque no todos estamos preparados para todo\". Incluso añade, Galilea, que hay servicios que estamos haciendo que pueden estar \"en contra de la Ley de Prevención de Riesgos Laborales porque nunca antes los hemos realizado\". El delegado sindical de CCOO añade que \"no descartan emprender acciones durante los próximos días, incluso ir a la huelga\".

    "text": "- Light\nPublished: | By: Christian Helgert\nSource article\nThe Faculty of Physics and Astronomy together with the Abbe School of Photonics are proud to announce the start of a new international Master's degree program. The new M.Sc. Quantum Science & Technology is an all-English, two-year Master's degree course providing multidisciplinary coverage in the field of quantum sciences including quantum mechanics, information, communication, computing, imaging, sensing and further rising fields of quantum technology. The course schedule ranges from fundamental scientific subjects to application-oriented quantum engineering aspects.\nThe study course is designed to incorporate international students from different backgrounds. It aims to provide them with a solid knowledge of the quantum theory as well as the potential of quantum-related effects, both for academic research and for technological applications in industry. All lectures, courses and modules are taught completely in English. Students enrolled in the two-year program receive dedicated tutorial support and are trained for leading positions in the upcoming quantum challenges in industry and academia. Moreover, graduating the M.Sc. Quantum Science & Technology program offers a very direct way either to enter the local PhD program or to find a to enter the prestigious doctoral (PhD) program afterwards.\nThe new Master's degree course will already start in the winter term 2024/25 with its first lectures and seminars. Thus, interested applicants are invited to apply already now to secure sufficient time for obtaining an international student visa, if necessary.\nHands-on experience in the Quantum Laboratory Lab Course\nOne particular feature of the new research-oriented Master's degree course it that already in the first and second semester, students are offered a Quantum Lab Course. This specific module introduces quantum optics and related quantum technology in a phenomenological way, centered on particular experiments that show specific features or applications of non-classical light and other quantum systems. It contain hands-on experiences, where the students themselves perform quantum-optical experiments or program quantum algorithms, as well as classroom instruction. It is one rare example where students get such practical experience in quantum technology setups already during their Master studies. In the Quantum Laboratoratory Lab Course, students perform experiments on Quantum Computing, Quantum Cryptography, Quantum Entanglement, Quantum Imaging, and many others.\nAlbert-Einstein-Straße 6\n07745 Jena\nGoogle Maps site planExternal link\nAlbert-Einstein-Straße 6\n07745 Jena\nGoogle Maps site planExternal link",
