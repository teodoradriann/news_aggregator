    "text": "First, they came for urban gardens, then they came for suburban gardens, then they came for all gardens.\nAccording to\nScience Daily, a new international study led by the University of Michigan finds that fruits and vegetables grown in urban farms and gardens have an average carbon footprint six times greater than conventionally grown produce.\n“However, a few city-grown crops equaled or outperformed conventional agriculture under certain conditions. Tomatoes grown in the soil of open-air urban plots had a lower carbon intensity than tomatoes grown in conventional greenhouses, while the emissions difference between conventional and urban agriculture vanished for air-freighted crops like asparagus.\n“The exceptions revealed by our study suggest that urban agriculture practitioners can reduce their climate impacts by cultivating crops that are typically greenhouse-grown or air-freighted, in addition to making changes in site design and management,” said study co-lead author Jason Hawes, a doctoral student at U-M’s School for Environment and Sustainability.\nAccording to\nUSSA News, numerous international research agencies have supported this project, including those from the UK, Germany, France, the U.S., Poland, and the EU.\nThat sounds like these lunatics want to control urban farming.\n“The study’s findings\ncould lead to discussions about implementing licenses and regulations for personal gardening, ostensibly for environmental or food safety reasons. This could result in restrictions on seed usage, possibly favoring genetically modified organisms (GMOs) designed to mitigate climate change impacts,” reports USSA News.\nYes, they are coming for your urban garden.

    "text": "So far in the 2025 NASCAR season, along with navigating complex legal landscapes,\nMichael Jordan’s 23XI Racing team is also making headlines for securing notable sponsorships.\nRecently, 23XI Racing revealed the new look for their No. 35 car driven by Riley Herbst. In a post on X, they said, “Just smile and wave. The No. 35 LUCY Breakers Toyota Camry XSE will hit the track for the first time in Martinsville.” The post also included an image of the car’s new paint scheme with the LUCY Breakers logo. As per the post, the new look for the No.35 car will have its on-track debut for the first time at the Martinsville speedway.\nNASCAR Fans Share Their Thoughts on the New Look\nAs of November 2024, 23XI Racing announced the expansion to a third full-time NASCAR Cup Series car, the No. 35 Toyota Camry XSE, driven by Herbst and primarily sponsored by Monster Energy. With the new announcement, NASCAR fans can expect to see the No. 35 car debut its new look by the end of March.\nJust smile and wave 👋\nThe No. 35 LUCY Breakers Toyota Camry XSE will be hitting the track for the first time in Martinsville.\n[pic.twitter.com/AC3Bj0UxjA]— 23XI Racing (@23XIRacing)\n[March 19, 2025]\nReacting to the post, one fan said, “Good lookin’ ride there, and harkens back to the old Copenhagen/Skoal days with tobacco cars.”\nAnother fan chipped in, “Nice paint scheme.”\n“Good looking scheme!” added another fan.\n23XI Racing Expanded to Third Full-Time Car\nIn 2024, 23XI Racing announced the addition of a third NASCAR Cup Series car. Herbst, 25, will pilot the No. 35 Toyota, joining the team alongside Tyler Reddick and Bubba Wallace in the third car as 23XI expands operations.\nHerbst said, “It’s an honor to join 23XI and Toyota for the opportunity to race in the Cup Series each week. Racing full-time in the Cup Series has been my goal since I started in NASCAR, and I’m excited to start my Cup career with such an accomplished and driven team.”\n“What 23XI has accomplished in a short time is impressive, and I look forward to building on their success as the organization grows. It’s also great to continue representing Monster, and I’m excited about adding to their legacy in NASCAR.”\nSo far, Monster Energy, a longtime partner with Herbst, has been the primary sponsor of the No. 35 Toyota Camry. However, with 23XI Racing’s latest announcement on X, fans can expect to see the new paint scheme and sponsorship announced soon.\nBefore 23XI Racing, Herbst made eight Cup Series starts with Rick Ware Racing and Front Row Motorsports. In the fall of 2023, he scored a career-high ninth-place result at the Talladega Superspeedway.",

    "title": "‘Passion, performance, poison’: Why this Scottish soccer league is struggling to shake off the specter of religious bigotry - LocalNews8.com - KIFI",
    "text": "By Amy Woodyatt, CNN\n(CNN) — Surrounded by medics, Hibernian FC player Martin Boyle lay on the pitch after diving for the ball in a Scottish Cup quarterfinal earlier this year and landing awkwardly on his head – the then 30-year-old suffered a concussion – an injury he would later describe as having sent him to “hell and back.”\nThe game was stopped for around 10 minutes, but as medics tended to the injured forward, chants of “die ya Fenian bastard” sung by some fans of the opposing team Rangers FC echoed throughout the stadium in Edinburgh. Fenian refers to a group of 19th century Irish revolutionaries but is widely recognized as a derogatory term for Irish Catholics.\nThe language mirrors the division caused by centuries of war and strife between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, in part because of the west of Scotland’s close historical links with Northern Ireland.\n“Over recent years supporters’ unacceptable conduct has become rife in Scotland whether that be through the use of pyrotechnics, sectarianism, objects being thrown onto the field of play or through other actions,” Hibernian FC, commonly known as Hibs said in a statement in response to the chanting.\nPolice Scotland told CNN it had received no reports regarding fans’ behavior towards Boyle. A spokesperson added: “I can confirm a man was arrested in connection with comments being made towards Rangers fans/staff, however, he was released without charge.”\nDavid Scott, director of Nil by Mouth – a Scottish charity that campaigns against religious bigotry – told CNN “sectarianism is something that’s very woven into the game of football.” He explained that “passion, performance, poison” are at the heart of the game in Scotland, with bigoted chanting taking the forefront.\n“It was a historic problem born of the Catholic-Protestant divide in Scottish society, especially in the West of Scotland. And it became greatly manifest in football,” Scottish sports journalist Graham Spiers told CNN.\n“That in the main has meant anti-Catholic chanting. This is not anti-Protestant. It’s not anti-Asian, it’s not anti-Semitic. In the main, it has been about anti-Catholic and anti-Irish chanting,” Spiers added.\nA problem rooted in history\nThe fierce rivalry between Glasgow’s two most famous teams – Celtic FC and Rangers – is historically one of the most vivid examples of sectarianism in Scottish football, and society.\nThe two teams play each other in Saturday’s Scottish Cup final.\nHistorically chants have included anti-Catholic religious bigotry, or vocal support for paramilitary groups like the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF).\nCeltic, founded by an Irish member of a Catholic religious order in 1887, wears its heritage proudly in the four-leaf clover of its team emblem.\nMeanwhile, Rangers, founded in 1872, was “historically and shamefully” a mostly Protestant club until the 1980s, Spiers explained. “Rangers didn’t hide it, they were proud of the fact they were all Protestant,” he said.\nThese historically religious identities and rivalries – often described as “Scotland’s shame” – extend to other Scottish clubs, including Edinburgh’s historically Catholic Hibernian and Protestant Hearts of Midlothian FC.\nPerhaps the most violent chapter in the sectarian sports rivalry happened in 1995, when 16-year-old Celtic fan Mark Scott was killed by a man who police say had family links to a Protestant paramilitary group.\nScott was wearing a Celtic scarf while walking past a pub frequented by Loyalist fans on his way home from a match on the day of his murder. Jason Campbell was arrested, tried and convicted in 1996 for the killing. He was sentenced to life in prison but was freed on parole in 2011 following human rights legislation.\nAnd though Scotland has become more secular than when these clubs were founded some 150 years ago, “these tribal loyalties remain,” said Nil by Mouth’s Scott.\n“When you’re singing and chanting these things, you may think you’re just thinking about your tradition, your background, but actually other people may just hear the hatred and agonism,” said Scott. “Across the city, people will sing songs, ‘We’re up to our knees in Fenian blood, surrender or you’ll die.’\n“They will tell you that, ‘This is just theater, these are just words that don’t mean anything, these are football chants,’ that people like me are taking it too seriously. It’s all culture. But it can also be a very intimidating atmosphere to be at,” Scott added.\nAccording to Spiers, Celtic’s support is “maybe 70% Catholic, but with a very large Protestant minority, who are Celtic fans. And they also have songs about ‘Orange [named after King William III, also known as William of Orange and a political society] bastards,’ meaning Protestants.”\nGeographically, these are clubs whose support cuts across the geography of Scotland as well as social class, said Scott.\n“People don’t go to church anymore,” he added. “People don’t live in these kinds of working class communities in Scotland where they used to do – people are more spread out. I think football becomes this kind of social cement that links people to parts of their past.”\nAuthorities have tried to tackle the problem, introducing legislation including The Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications (Scotland) Act 2012, which was repealed in 2018.\n“If you’re watching football matches with five or 10,000 people or whatever it is shouting and chanting, you can’t arrest them. So you have to come up with a system of addressing that,” Scott explained.\nThere were 576 charges with a religious aggravation reported in 2022-23 according to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS), an 8% increase on the previous 12 months.\nThe COPFS reports that “over the last five years, the number of religious charges reported has fluctuated between around 530 and 670 per year.”\nThis April, Scotland’s new hate crime law came into force, which focuses on “stirring up hatred,” “racially aggravated harassment” and crimes “aggravated by prejudice” with regard to age, disability, impairment, religion, sexual orientation, transgender identity and sex characteristics – though Scott describes this law as a “red herring” when it comes to addressing bigotry in football given previous legislation didn’t solve the problem.\nA spokesperson for the Scottish Government told CNN that it is “fully committed to tackling all forms of bigotry and prejudice including sectarianism.”\nThe spokesperson highlighted the new Hate Crime and Public Order Act as a mechanism to tackle hatred and prejudice, and said the government would support the police in “taking appropriate and proportionate action to safeguard public safety.”\nJoseph Webster, Professor of the Anthropology of Religion at the University of Cambridge, told CNN that his own research shows that the majority of “offensive chanting” occurs when only one fan group is present, in spaces like a social club or pub, and can “foster intra-group solidarity.”\nWebster added that his research shows an unintended consequence of the now defunct Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications (Scotland) Act 2012 “is that those fan bases feel unfairly targeted by the police, and the result is they look inward, among themselves even further, and the chanting then escalates.”\nCNN has reached out to Police Scotland, Scottish Football Association, Rangers and Celtic for comment.\nHiding a wider problem\nJeanette Findlay, the Chair, and a founding member of Call it Out, a campaign against anti-Irish racism and anti-Catholic bigotry, said that outrage over anti-Catholic chanting in football is “a long running diversion by the Scottish government, Scottish society.”\n“The Scottish government and polite Scottish society don’t like to acknowledge that there is, across Scottish society, geographically and in class terms, a continued anti-Catholic bigotry,” she told CNN Sport, explaining that the vast majority of Catholics in Scotland are of Irish descent.\nThe Scottish Government referred CNN to its previous statement when asked about these claims.\nFindlay says that the government often comments that the problem is contained to football, and by association, areas lived in by the working class.\n“Catholics are more likely to live in poorer areas, they are over represented in the prison system, hugely overrepresented in religious aggravated hate crime. We are over represented in certain health conditions,” she added. Scottish government data backs up those observations of Findlay.\nIn almost half of religion aggravated hate crimes, “the perpetrator showed prejudice towards the Catholic community” (47%), according to a Police Scotland report which reviewed recorded crimes in 2020-21.\nThe next largest groups were Muslims and Protestants, who each made up 16% of cases, the report data based on a random sample of cases, found.\nIn 2022-23, police noted that around one in 10 hate crimes were religiously aggravated, though this data set did not disclose which religions were targeted.\nFindlay said that, while she has heard hostile chants at football matches, “frankly, I’m more concerned with the employment statistics, and the justice statistics and the health statistics which are more of a problem for us.”\n“Someone calling us a Fenian bastard and threatening us on a football pitch doesn’t cause us much trouble.\n“If they were marching past places of worship, spitting on our priests and vandalizing our churches, that’s a problem. If they were standing at the door, shouting up, that should be dealt with,” she added.\nJournalist Spiers said that, although Rangers “modernized” long ago following pressure from fans and the media, prejudicial songs and their associated meanings “still hangs around Rangers like a bad stench.”\nHe said, “I’ve been at Rangers games in recent years where the atmosphere has been great – nobody is more sensitive than I am to chanting because God knows I’ve written about it for 25 years.”\nBut “every so often, it will flare up and we all go. ‘All right. It’s still there. The old problem is still there.’ But it’s not as regular as it was 10, 20, 30, 40 years ago” Spiers added.\n“People find it tedious and boring and tragic. I’m not actually offended by these chants, but I’m embarrassed for my country. I’m embarrassed for Scotland, that people will say – why are they singing about Catholics, you know, as if it’s as if it’s the 1920s or the 1890s?”\nWebster is one of many who cautions against relying on legislation alone to deal with bigotry, adding: “I think most people would agree that you can’t prevent someone from holding bigoted attitudes by arresting them.”\nCeltic recently won the Scottish Premiership, edging Rangers to the title.\nSaturday’s cup final offers Rangers a chance to stop its rival from winning the double, but given the clubs’ complicated history, how their respective fanbases behave will also be closely watched.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

    "text": "«Esternalizzare le frontiere significa negare i valori fondanti dell’Europa»\nCecilia Strada, parlamentare europea eletta nelle liste del Partito democratico, è seduta al tavolino di un bar a Bruxelles quando incontra una donna che non aveva mai visto prima: sfoggia una borsa con la scritta «Sta rottura di coglioni dei fascisti» (la frase divenuta un tormentone che venne pronunciata qualche anno fa da un attivista dei castelli romani che proteggeva un gruppo di rifugiati dalle contestazioni di una squadraccia di estrema destra) e la maglietta di Emergency. Strada non può fare a meno di fermarla e presentarsi per complimentarsi per l’outfit. A questo punto la nostra intervista può cominciare.\nLa lettera sui migranti di Ursula Von der Leyen sembra spostare a destra l’asse della commissione. Che ne pensa?\nGià la scorsa legislatura si era chiusa con approvazione del patto immigrazione e asilo che di certo non era di sinistra. Il problema era già allora rispetto dei diritti umani e infatti il Partito democratico non ha votato. Von der Leyen ha fretta, perché ci sono due anni prima che il patto entri in vigore. Ecco, bisogna trovare in modo di correggere il testo che è stato approvato. Non solo per i diritti dei migranti, anche per i paesi di primo approdo che non vengono tutelati in alcun modo. Quel patto non genera alcun meccanismo di solidarietà europea\nGiorgia Meloni ha lavorato per concentrare l’azione dell’Ue sul blocco delle partenze invece che sulla gestione comune dell’accoglienza.\nMeloni probabilmente non può più chiedere solidarietà europea. Magari altri potevano farlo, ma in questo momento gli amici del governo Meloni non vogliono che ci sia alcuna solidarietà europea. Quindi puntano su altro, ma puntano su cose che non funzionano. Pensare di fermare le partenze è soltanto una pia illusione. E in ogni caso tentare di farlo ha come prezzo una gravissima violazione dei diritti umani. Inoltre, questo tipo di scelte rende l’Europa ricattabile.\nIn attesa del pre-consiglio Elly Schlein ha criticato duramente ogni scelta di esternalizzare la gestione delle frontiere.\nEsternalizzare le frontiere significa negare i valori sui quali è fondata l’Europa. È quello che si è fatto con la Libia, che ha preso soldi per violare i diritti umani al posto nostro. Quel memorandum, va detto, non l’aveva inventato Meloni, purtroppo era opera del centrosinistra. Schlein per fortuna su questo è stata molto netta: non possiamo accettare violazioni del genere.\nSembra però disposta ad accettarle Von der Leyen…\nVon der Leyen dice nella sua lettera che alcuni paesi membri stanno pensando a «soluzioni innovative». Ma l’unica soluzione veramente innovativa è l’apertura di canali di accesso sicuri e legali. È l’unica cosa che funziona concretamente, anche in termini egoistici. Lo dice anche il governatore della Banca d’Italia: bisogna attirare lavoratrici e lavoratori migranti altrimenti nel 2045 spegneremo la luce.\nQueste valutazioni sono condivise dal gruppo dei Socialisti e democratici?\nNe parleremo, cominceremo a farlo appena possibile. La protezione dei diritti umani è un tema su cui bisogna discutere.\nNel frattempo in Italia Schlein ha finalmente presentato una proposta di legge per superare la Bossi-Fini. Fa parte del percorso di ripensamento degli errori del passato?\nAnche questa è una necessità, non solo per i diritti ma anche per quelli che dicono di volere la sicurezza, che si ottiene con la legalità e non con la Bossi-Fini. Una legge che genera illegalità non è molto funzionale.\nGli eventi europei di questi giorni segnano la prima vera battuta d’arresto per il governo e Giorgia Meloni?\nMeloni in termini assoluti ha già perso 700 mila voti alle europee. E poi ha perso le amministrative. Il governo non sta tutelando i diritti dei cittadini. Ma sembra che gli italiani se ne stiamo accorgendo.",

    "text": "Abigail Castillo estaba a punto de cruzar la frontera de Estados Unidos de manera ilegal cuando escuchó que el presidente Joe Biden estaba deteniendo el asilo . De todos modos, continuó, caminando horas a través de las montañas al este de San Diego con su hijo pequeño, esperando que no fuera demasiado tarde.\n\"Escuchaba que lo iban a hacer o que lo estaban finalizando\", dijo Castillo, de 35 años, el miércoles mientras ella y su hijo eran escoltados hacia una camioneta de la Patrulla Fronteriza con unas dos docenas de personas más procedentes de Brasil, Ecuador y su pueblo en el estado sureño mexicano de Oaxaca , del cual dijo haberse ido debido a la violencia que lo azota.\nHabían perdido el plazo y ahora estaban sujetos a la nueva regla de deportación .\nSu sensación de incertidumbre prevaleció entre muchos migrantes después de que Biden invocara poderes presidenciales para detener el procesamiento de asilo cuando las detenciones por cruces ilegales superan las 2,500 en un día. La medida entró en vigor a las 12:01 a.m. del miércoles porque se alcanzó ese umbral.\nDos funcionarios de alto rango del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional confirmaron que las primeras deportaciones bajo la nueva regla se realizaron el miércoles, aunque no dijeron cuántas personas fueron deportadas. Los funcionarios hablaron con los periodistas bajo la condición de que sus nombres no se usaran, en conformidad con las regulaciones.\nSergio Franco, quien sostenía a su bebé después de un viaje de casi dos meses desde Ecuador con su familia, caminando a través de la peligrosa región del Darién en la frontera entre Colombia y Panamá, dijo que confiaba en que prevalecería en su súplica para encontrar un refugio seguro en Estados Unidos .\n\"Mientras nosotros tengamos las pruebas suficientes, no habría problema\", comentó mientras subía a la camioneta con Castillo y los demás.\nMientras el grupo se alejaba, varios migrantes de la India se acercaron a la misma área polvorienta cerca de una tienda de armas en el pueblo de Dulzura, uno de varios que han surgido en el último año en las afueras rurales remotas de San Diego para que los migrantes se entreguen a los agentes de la Patrulla Fronteriza . No había agua ni baños y poca sombra.\nRELACIONADAS\nActualidad EE.UU. anuncia que está en conversaciones con otros gobiernos para repatriar los migrantes",
