    "text": "分享到微信X\n打开微信，点击底部的“发现”，使用 “扫一扫” 即可将网页分享到我的朋友圈。\n记者3月10日从河南农业大学获悉，该校联合新疆农业科学院微生物应用研究所团队依托新疆重点研发项目，创建了我国最大的、拥有完全知识产权的新疆耐盐碱微生物资源库，并建立了相应的资源信息库和查询系统。\n新疆是我国盐碱地类型最多、分布面积最广、积盐情况最为严重的地区，有着“世界盐碱土博物馆”之称。盐碱地是我国耕地扩容、提质、增效的重要战略后备资源。微生物改良法作为一种生态友好、可持续的改良方式，正逐步成为盐碱地边治理边利用的有效手段。新疆独特的地理、气候与生态条件，孕育了丰富且独特的微生物区系。\n研究团队从南北疆采集样品2000余份，分离、鉴定、保藏了微生物资源2万余份，涵盖112个科、282个属、2264个种，创建了我国最大的新疆耐盐碱微生物资源库。通过对这些微生物进行分子鉴定及耐盐碱、抗盐碱、作物促生、抗病害等性能研究，为盐碱地改良微生物肥料的研发打下了基础，将有效促进对新疆盐碱地微生物生态的了解及盐碱地治理。利用资源库，科研工作者可以检索目标微生物菌种的信息，从而促进菌株研究的合作与交流。\n基于资源库，团队成员以棉花、玉米、花生、番茄等作物为应用对象，开发了具有耐盐碱、促生、抗病害等功能的微生物制剂。截至目前，依托资源库，团队申请专利18项、软件著作权3项，建立了国际领先的微生物筛选与鉴定平台。\n“下一步，我们将扩大耐盐碱微生物资源的挖掘范围，将采样范围扩大至宁夏、内蒙古以及我国东部地区。团队也将加强微生物资源的功能鉴定、安全评价、稳定性保持、有益代谢物分析和产业化应用等工作，确保科研向生产力的转化。”团队带头人梁振普说，耐盐碱微生物资源库的建立，将有力推动新疆盐碱地的改良，对扩大可耕地面积和生态保护具有重要意义。\n（责任编辑：杨淼）",

    "text": "Twitter changed its name to X and some things seem to get better but there is nothing in this world that will ever beat old-school Twitter Hashtag games and we found one that was that kind of old-school funny. We legitimately laughed out loud, full belly laughs and a snort. We hope you do as well. To read about the story that inspired the tag you can click [here](https://twitchy.com/brettt/2024/04/17/biden-tells-steelworkers-his-cannibals-story-again-n2395211). Let's Go! [#RIPUncleBosey](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23RIPUncleBosey&src=typed_query) We think this hashtag started with a simple comment to someone talking about the insane story. [April 17, 2024] It went on from there and it is GLORIOUS! This is why they have to script everything he does. When they set him free, he goes off telling old man stories.— Don'tBeAJagoff (@Eponine1973) [#RIPUncleBosey] [April 17, 2024] She's not wrong.

    "text": "The Kings droppped their fourth consecutive game on the road, falling by a 3-0 final score on Thursday evening against the Tampa Bay Lightning.\nJust shy of five minutes into the game, the Lightning opened the scoring. Forward Brandon Hagel, skating in transition, pulled a move on Kings defenseman Jordan Spence in a 1-on-1 situation before skating in on a breakaway. Hagel shot five hole on Kings netminder David Rittich, scoring his 21st goal of the season to give the hosts an early 1-0 advantage.\nFor the third time in four games, the Kings had a goal taken off the board, one that would have tied the game midway through the second period. Out of the penalty box, defenseman Jacob Moverare appeared to gain the offensive zone and find a charging Quinton Byfield, with the latter scoring his 12th goal of the season, but Moverare was judged to be offsides on a Tampa Bay coaches challenge, keeping the score 1-0 Lightning.\nWith fewer than five minutes to play in the third period, Tampa Bay doubled its advantage, as Hagel buried his second goal of the game. With forward Nikita Kucherov on a breakaway, Rittich aggressively charged out and made a sprawling save on the first attempt, but Hagel followed up on the play and put home the rebound from close range, giving the hosts a two-goal lead.\nWith the Kings on a late, 6-on-4 power play, Tampa Bay forward Anthony Cirelli hit the empty net from distance, bringing the game to the 3-0 final score.\nHear from Anze Kopitar, Jordan Spence and Jim Hiller following tonight’s game.\nAnze Kopitar\nOn the team’s struggles offensively right now\nIt seems like we’re doing the right things, it’s just you’ve got to keep on going really. I mean, we do have chances but for whatever reason, the puck’s are not going in. It’s very hard mentally now, when you’re not scoring and losing tight games. It ends up being 3-0 tonight but it was tighter than the score. We’ve got to find a way, that’s the bottom line, I mean, there’s no other way to put it, really. We’re going to have to score goals, whether that’s on on the power play, 5-on-5, we’ve just got to find a way.\nOn the team’s frustration level, with the work and compete being there, without the offense\nYeah, it’s pretty frustrating. The goalies are doing a really good job of keeping us in the game and everything. We’re not giving up a whole lot, it’s just like I said, putting the puck in the net. It falls on this group and me being on the top of that list to get the offense going.\nOn where he feels the team’s confidence level is right now\nI wouldn’t say the confidence is sky high right now, but sometimes all it takes, it’s a little bounce, a little something to spark the group. We’re still obviously confident that it’s within this room.\nOn if three disallowed goals over four games feels like “when it rains, it pours”\nYeah, it sure does, but can’t look back. We’ve just got to refocus and make sure that on Saturday, we’re ready to go again and keep on grinding away.\nJordan Spence\nOn the offensive struggles of the group right now\nI don’t think our confidence is there right now. Obviously we have some chances to score some goals and we’re not capitalizing on our chances. At the end of the day, we’re just not playing well right now. We’ve got to just reset, forget about tonight and be ready for Carolina.\nOn the frustration level right now when the puck isn’t going in for the team\nIt’s been tough. We’re not doing our job to score goals. At the end of the day, we have to score goals to win games and we’re not doing that. At the end of the game, I think we’re showing our emotions on why we’re mad and I think, overall, it wasn’t our game. We just have to stop it.\nOn the momentum downswing that disallowed goals give the team\nAt the end of the day, it’s hockey, it happens, teams go through slumps, but I think good teams, they get back up and try to do the best to win games and that’s what we’ve got to try and do. We’re getting some bad bounces right now, but think if we if we play our game, if we do the right things on the ice, good things will always come. We’re just going to try and get our confidence and our mojo back.\nOn having Drew Doughty back with the group again\nHe’s a key part of our team, on and off the ice. We’re really happy to have him back and every shift that he goes out there, he gets better and better. Big to see that. It’s unfortunate that we’ve lost two games in a row but at the end of the day, it’s good to get that leader that’s vocal, on and off the ice, to get us going, get our get our groove back and try to win games.\nJim Hiller\n*Hiller confirmed before the game that defenseman Brandt Clarke would be a healthy scratch in tonight’s game. He added that he has had a conversation with Clarke about the situation, but did not elaborate on Clarke’s status beyond that.\nNotes –\n• Goaltender David Rittich turned aside 30 of the 32 shots on goal he faced in tonight’s game. This marks Rittich’s first 30-save performance since he made 31 stops on March 30, 2024 at Calgary.\n• The netminder’s new single-game high in saves comes the day after his partner, Darcy Kuemper, made 36 saves on 38 shots faced against the Florida Panthers, his highest single-game total this season.\n• The Kings were shutout this evening for the fourth time this season and the second time in two nights. In total, the Kings have just four goals on their current trip to date and have scored an NHL-low 22 goals in 13 games during the month of January.\nThe Kings have a scheduled team off day tomorrow in Raleigh, after the back-to-back. The team will return to the ice on Saturday, February 1 for a full-team morning skate in North Carolina.\nRules for Blog Commenting\n- No profanity, slurs or other offensive language.

    "text": "113 car seats inspected, 93 new car seats gifted to local families at safety event “Proper use of child safety seats not only reduces medical costs but also prevents lost future earnings and improves a child’s quality of life following a collision.” BRYAN, Texas (KBTX) - There is new information about [Saturday’s car seat safety event in Bryan](https://www.kbtx.com/2024/09/15/daniel-stark-holds-car-seat-safety-event/). Daniel Stark Injury Lawyers hosted their 17th Annual Car Seat Safety Event to provide essential car seat inspections and distribute new child car seats at no cost to families who needed them. During the event, 113 car seat inspections were conducted but only one child was found to be a property-restrained seat. The statistic highlights the critical need for increased car seat safety awareness, said organizers. In total, Daniel Stark provided 93 new car seats to local families. Over 30 students from Bryan Collegiate High School volunteered to join Daniel Stark and Texas A&M AgriLife Extension during the event. “Proper use of child safety seats not only reduces medical costs but also prevents lost future earnings and improves a child’s quality of life following a collision,” said Daniel Stark Public Communications Director Linda McMillan.” According to Texas A&M AgriLife, the Bryan event had an estimated economic impact of $234,889.
