    "text": "Hot and humid is the weather story for this Thursday. Temperatures have soared into the upper 90s late today. We should top out in the upper 90s around 6pm. You’ve likely noticed it’s a bit more humid than normal too; that continues tonight through Friday. In fact, tonight we will see a record warm low temperature around 70 degrees in the urban parts of Portland; it’ll be the most uncomfortable night of the summer if you don’t have air-conditioning. Outlying areas drop well down into the 60s, but that’s warm for those spots.\nThe strong area of high pressure remains over the western USA through all this first week of August. From time to time, we’ll see some marine air surge inland, cooling us a bit west of the Cascades. That happens Friday and Saturday, plus again next Tuesday/Wednesday. So tomorrow will be a few degrees cooler than today but we’ll continue to call it a First Alert Weather Day due to the very warm start and afternoon humidity. A few clouds plus the marine air should keep us below 90 degrees on Saturday.\nPortland's Forecast (kptv) There’s no sign if widespread lighting over or west of the Cascades through at least the middle of next week, but hot weather means the three dozen fires burning in Oregon will become much more active. Most fire smoke remains over/east of the Cascades during this time, but overhead we may see some yellowish sun at times.\nCopyright 2024 KPTV-KPDX. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "[Contactmusic](/) [Sheryl Lee Ralph](https://www.contactmusic.com/sheryl-lee-ralph) is “grateful” that Hurricane Beryl has passed Jamaica without a \"direct hit\". [Sheryl Lee Ralph](https://www.contactmusic.com/sheryl-lee-ralph) is “grateful” that Hurricane Beryl has passed Jamaica. The 'Abbot Elementary' actress is currently staying on the Caribbean island ahead of her 32-year-old son Etienne Maurice's wedding this weekend and she has thanked fans for their \"good vibes and prayers\" after the Category 4 storm left them unscathed. She shared on X on Thursday (04.07.24): “It looks like the hurricane Beryl has passed and is running like a Jamaican track star off to another race. \"Thank you all for your good vibes and prayers. We did not get a direct hit and we are grateful but Carriacou needs help.” The 67-year-old actress - who, as well as Etienne, also has daughter Ivy 'Coco' Maurice, 32, with ex-husband Eric Maurice - had been monitoring the weather over the last few days before the hurricane hit. She said in a video post on Wednesday (03.07.24): “It’s starting. I’m not going to go all the way out there, but it’s happening now. “We are praying for safety for everybody and stay off the roads, stay inside, ‘cause I’m going all the way back inside now.” Sheryl began preparing for the hurricane earlier this week. She said in another video post: “From the looks of the sky, it looks like Beryl is gonna be here much sooner than the news keeps saying. “So it’s very calm here in Jamaica, the sky is so beautifully clear. And they said that the sea looked like glass today.… We have to take in all of the outside furniture because, you know, those things take flight “I hope you’ve put oil in your lamp and are taking extra care. So to everybody that’s here on the island, we remember that [Hurricane] Gilbert was a three and Beryl is a four. Wow. God bless you, goodnight.” Etienne had been \"praying for the best\" ahead of his nuptials to ABC News journalist Stephanie Wash. He said on his own Instagram Story on Wednesday: “But what I don’t love is rain during the week of my wedding. “I’m praying that everybody here and in Jamaica and the Caribbean Islands are safe and all we can do is pray for the best.” On the same day that Glastonbury welcomed back Margate's adopted sons, The Libertines, Margate itself put on it's very own Leisure Festival as it...
