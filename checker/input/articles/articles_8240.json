    "text": "Mission Bay High’s Mediums of Mental Health team has expanded its outreach efforts to more students while also planning for its future longevity.\nLast year, seven MBHS freshmen and sophomores took on the Aspen Challenge. It was a frenzied and hectic 8-week challenge to develop a response to solving one of society’s most difficult problems.\nWith guidance from biology teacher Echo Jacoway and English teacher Nathan Sheehy, the team consisting of Iris Brogan, Yemaya Bruce, Natalie Chen, Madison Davis, Tegan Grzyb, Matilda Meyer and Dylan Talarico-Smith designed an innovative approach for helping youth effectively navigate their mental health journey by creating a roadmap that connects them to resources to support their wellness.\n“We selected the name ‘The Mediums of Mental Health’ because we used the different mediums of art to help guide people through their mental health journey and lead them to resources for any issues they may be having,” said junior Iris Brogan. “We created two interactive murals, a website, an Instagram account and several art-related activities as part of our solution.”\nAt the May 1, 2024 Aspen Challenge Solutions Showcase, the Mission Bay High team was awarded the People’s Choice Award and an additional $500 to continue their project for a second year.\nKeeping their commitment to destigmatize conversations around mental health has been productive and revelatory.\nIris Brogan and Dylan Talarico-Smith building the interactive mural board for Longfellow Spanish Immersion School. (Natalie Chen) “Mental health has always been important to me because I’ve seen both my peers and myself struggle without proper outlets for support,” said sophomore Maddy Davis. “It can be isolating and I wanted to be part of an effort to change that.\n“Over the past two years, my perspective on destigmatization has shifted, especially in how young students approach the topic,” Davis said. “Their understanding is often simple, but incredibly genuine, and their reactions show how impactful these early conversations can be. Seeing that firsthand has reinforced how important it is to introduce mental health in a way that is both accessible and meaningful.”\nJunior Matilda Meyer said this issue is common for most.\n“I don’t think anyone has gone through high school without experiencing some kind of mental health issue,” Meyer said. “We’ve all felt anxious and stressed, especially now dealing with the rigorous (International Baccalaurate) diploma and all my extracurriculars, so paying attention to my mental health and learning strategies to cope have really allowed me to get to where I am today.\n“After working on this project for so long, I’ve really learned to appreciate taking time for myself, and definitely become more aware of what I’m feeling and what I need,” Meyer said.\n“As a woman of color pursuing a career in medicine, I understand the importance of representation in a field that has a long history of generational trauma related to health disparities, and stigma regarding mental health,” said junior Yemaya Bruce. “My role in shattering stereotypes, makes me feel empowered to create pathways to a more equitable society.\n“Even as a community leader in Mediums of Mental Health, I strengthen those pathways through each and every conversation, podcast episode, event and connection,” Bruce said. “It gives me a sense of confidence knowing I play even a small role to address destigmatizing mental health in our society, especially for youth in our communities.”\nEach team member has committed to Mission Bay High’s IB diploma course work during their junior and senior years. Their mental health project will continue as part of their Community Action Service project, an IB diploma requirement.\nJunior Natalie Chen said their CAS project is “self-directed” and that it challenges students “to show initiative, demonstrate perseverance and develop skills such as problem-solving, collaboration and decision-making.\n“The project can take form in countless different ways, and students are encouraged to go above and beyond in creative ways to contribute to their community,” she said.\nThis school year the Mediums For Mental Health team members made two more interactive mural boards — one each for Pacific Beach Elementary and the K-8 Longfellow Spanish Immersion School in Clairemont Mesa, upgraded their website and started translating materials into Spanish.\nMission Bay Mediums of Mental Health members Iris Brogan, Maddy Davis, Natalie Chen, Tegan Grzyb and Yemaya Bruce when they presented the “Savannah of Serenity” interactive mural board to Longfellow Spanish Language Immersion School on April 9. (Natalie Chen) “We knew we wanted to continue making boards for schools, and each board costs about $160, so that is most of our budget already,” Meyer said. “We also have our own website (mediumsofmentalhealth.org), which costs about $200 yearly to keep, so we’ve done a couple fundraisers at our school to raise money for that.”\nMeyer said the team is also planning to apply for grants so their project can continue in future years.\nIn January, Pacific Beach Elementary School received its interactive mural board titled “Icebergs of Inspirations” because its mascot is the penguin.\nEach of the four boards created thus far have a theme that ties into a specific attribute of the receiving school.\n“Savannah of Serenity” was the theme for the board presented to Longfellow students on April 9. Its interactive messaging was in Spanish since it is a Spanish immersion school.\nAs for the project’s third year in 2025-26, six of the seven team members will be seniors. So a big focus will be selecting younger students as their successors, they said. Another major goal is to bring their podcast to fruition while continuing to make and deliver interactive mural boards to local schools, make presentations at community events and write grant applications as part of their fundraising.\nAnyone who would like to donate can email Mission Bay High Wellness Coordinator Gloria Cota at gcota@sandi.net for details.\nOriginally Published: April 23, 2025 at 3:24 PM PDT",

    "text": "A Ericsson inaugura neste mês, em Indaiatuba-SP, seu novo centro de inovação chamado 5G Open Innovation Center — ambiente de inovação aberto impulsionado pela atuação já consolidada da companhia em Pesquisas, Desenvolvimento e Inovação (P&D&I) com desenvolvimento tecnológico de ponta e ecossistema colaborativo sólido.\nO objetivo, segundo Karam Takieddine, Head de Inovação da Ericsson para o Cone Sul da América Latina, é fomentar a colaboração de empresas, universidades e startups para a criação de ecossistemas de referência, e ser uma ferramenta de desenvolvimento de negócios para permitir casos de uso mais avançados e monetização para empresas, setor público e consumidores alimentados pela plataforma de inovação 5G.\n\"Nossa ideia com o novo centro de inovação é proporcionar um ambiente aberto para ampliar a cooperação entre parceiros tecnológicos, industriais e integradores para desenvolvermos juntos novos casos de uso da tecnologia a partir da infraestrutura 5G disponível no laboratório. Nosso diferencial está justamente na competência local de longa data em pesquisa e desenvolvimento, que já trabalha com tecnologia de ponta e conta com um ecossistema de colaboração bastante sólido\", diz Takieddine.\nHoje a Ericsson tem parceria com seis universidades brasileiras: Universidade Federal do Ceará (UFC), Universidade Federal do Pará (UFPA), Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPE), Universidade Estadual de Campinas (Unicamp), Universidade Federal de Campina Grande (UFCG), Universidade de São Paulo (USP). E com quatro Institutos de Ciência e Tecnologia: Instituto Nacional de Telecomunicações (Inatel), Venturus, FACENS e FITec.\nO novo centro de inovação está equipado com ativos de Realidade Aumentada (AR), Realidade Virtual (VR) e Realidade Mista (MR), plataforma de design 3D, servidores em cloud, placas de vídeo (GPUs) de útima geração, simuladores de robótica 3D AGVs (Automated Guided Vehicle ) e AMRs (Autonomous Mobile Robots), kit drone, câmeras avançadas e sensores de IoT. Além disso, o espaço vai contar com três redes diferentes: rede privativa 5G na faixa de 3,7-3,8 GHz, rede pública 5G na faixa de 3,5GHz e a nova tecnologia 5G Fixed Wireless Access (FWA), solução versátil, de rápida implantação e eficaz para fornecer conectividade de banda larga em áreas urbanas e rurais, onde a infraestrutura de banda larga fixa é limitada.\nPara Edvaldo Santos, Vice-presidente de P&D&I da Ericsson para o Cone Sul da América Latina, o impacto do 5G nas novas tecnologias é enorme. Para isso, o novo centro vai contar com um moderno espaço para Provas de Conceito (PoCs) e demonstrações que combinam IA (Inteligência Artificial), tecnologias imersivas, robótica, Cloud e 5G, projetadas por um ecossistema de inovação.\n\"Atualmente, temos um vasto leque de inovações, como o uso de AR para aplicações da Indústria 4.0 com robôs controlados pelo movimento dos dedos da mão e não por joysticks; Inteligência Artificial para que as redes se autogerenciem; comunicação veicular para traslados mais seguros; visão computacional para a tomada de decisão acertada e em tempo real, entre outras. E já estamos trabalhando no que vem depois do 5G – para um futuro bem próximo, podemos esperar por iniciativas como Gêmeos Digitais, e representações digitais e programáveis de fenômenos do mundo real\", conclui.\nReconhecida globalmente como principal impulsionadora da padronização do 5G, a Ericsson repete a história de sucesso registrada nas gerações anteriores. Com o seu centro de excelência em P&D&I na cidade de Indaiatuba, a empresa se fortaleceu ao longo dos últimos 52 anos no Brasil como líder em pesquisa e desenvolvimento no setor de telecomunicações, contribuindo ativamente para o avanço tecnológico e para a construção de uma sociedade cada vez mais conectada.",

    "text": "President William Ruto on Thursday fired his entire Cabinet save for Prime CS Musalia Mudavadi. Ruto said he had reached the decision after keenly listening to what people were saying and after gauging the performance of his Cabinet. Nyeri Governor Mutahi Kahiga says he has been vindicated after President William Ruto on Thursday fired his entire Cabinet save for Prime CS Musalia Mudavadi. Ruto said he had decided after keenly listening to what people were saying and after gauging the performance of his Cabinet. Nilisema aje? (What did I say?) Vindicated! Anguka nayo(drop with it),” Kahiga said on X. The governor had on Wednesday appealed to the President to listen to the voice of reason and do what had been demanded of the Gen Z and rid his government of people they deemed unsuitable to hold office. “I wish to, with a lot of humility and respect, address my President Dr William Samoei Ruto and tell him Mr President, there are men and women around you who you could be calling advisors but you are in the hole you are today because of the misadvise they have given you,” Kahiga said. Speaking in Nyeri county, the governor asked the President to seize the moment and after careful introspection make a wise decision in line with what was being demanded of him by the masses. “It does not matter who is close to you, in politics it’s your skin that matters and this is a nation whose existence and survival are in your hands. It’s important for you now to take action, the best action that you think should be taken,” he said. Kahiga asked the President to evaluate the direction the country was taking in light of the recent Gen Z-driven protests to help him make an informed choice. He said the President had made so many promises before coming to office and they were not going to be achieved in the prevailing atmosphere. “The Gen Z have made demands, you engaged with them, they told you what they wanted, none of the demands was for you to put up 150 teams to negotiate. They have clearly told you we don’t want you to do this, they want you to do this, it’s that simple,” he said. “If they say that you reorganise your Cabinet, kindly do. If they say you sack it, do it,” he added. Before the sacking of his Cabinet, Ruto had on Tuesday announced that the National Multi-Sectoral Forum would begin talks on Monday, July 15 to address the issues raised by Gen Z. The youth, however, declined and demanded that the issues that were affecting the country like the audit of public debt and employment of intern doctors did not require dialogue. While sending his Cabinet home, Ruto said he had keenly listened to what the people of Kenya have said and “decided to dismiss with immediate effect all the Cabinet Secretaries and the Attorney-General from the Cabinet of the Republic of Kenya except the Prime Cabinet Secretary and Cabinet Secretary for Foreign and Diaspora Affairs”. Ruto assured the country that government operations would continue uninterrupted under the guidance of Principal Secretaries and other relevant officials as he immediately embarked on extensive consultations to set up a broad-based government. “I will be announcing additional measures in due course,” Ruto said.

    "title": "The warmest December in Cleburne County history",
    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Cleburne County, Arkansas from 1901-2000 was 39.8. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Cleburne County, Arkansas experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Cleburne County, Arkansas history.",

    "text": "OCCUPIED JERUSALEM — Khalil Sayegh lives in the United States and for days he anxiously awaited news of his family who had taken refuge in Gaza churches to escape the Hamas-Israel war.\nA few days before Christmas, he learned his father had died due to a lack of medical care, Sayegh said by telephone from Washington DC where he works as a political analyst.\n\"I was told by a relative... who had learned it from a priest,\" he said.\nThe news left him feeling shattered, he said, adding that he has yet to speak with other relatives stuck in Gaza which has been under heavy Israeli bombardment since Hamas' October 7 sudden attacks.\nMobile and Internet services, as well as electricity, have been largely disrupted in the Palestinian territory since the war broke out.\n\"Days go by without us having any news,\" said Sayegh, 29.\n\"We live with fear... not knowing if they are dead or alive, if they have food and water or if they are hungry.\"\nSayegh's family — his parents, two sisters and a brother — are among the 1.9 million people the United Nations estimates have been displaced in the territory of 2.4 million.\nHis parents and one sister took shelter at the Catholic Holy Family Church in Gaza City, while his younger brother stayed in Khan Yunis as he needs kidney dialysis.\nHis other sister fled to the nearby Saint Porphyrius Greek Orthodox Church with her husband and two children. While there she gave birth to a third child, a boy named Khader.\n\"I haven't even seen a picture of him. All I know is that he exists,\" said Sayegh.\nAbout 7,000 Christians lived in Gaza before Hamas took control of the Palestinian territory in 2007, according to the Gaza authorities. Now they number around 1,000.\nThe Hamas government says more than 20,000 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched air strikes and a ground offensive. Most of the dead are women and children.\nThe war has reduced much of Gaza to rubble and put out of action most of its hospitals, particularly in the north of the territory, the United Nations says.\nFood, medicine, water and fuel are hard to come by.\n'Pray for us'\nThe Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem reported that on December 16 two Christian women were \"murdered\" by an Israeli forces sniper inside the same church where Sayegh's family are sheltering.\nPope Francis deplored the deaths, which he said happened in a church complex \"where there are no terrorists but families, children, people who are sick and have disabilities\".\nBack in Washington, Gaza-born Sayegh said he has put on hold studies he was undertaking in the field of human rights.\n\"I just cannot function 100 per cent,\" he said.\n\"The only thing that keeps me going is to talk about what is happening and to remember that the people of Gaza have no voice of their own.\"\nSayegh is not the only person eager for news of loved ones trapped in Gaza.\nA Jerusalem-based nun, who declined to be identified, said she is only able to reach two other nuns sheltering at the Holy Family Church every three or four days.\n“They say they are well and ask us to pray for them,” she said.\nOn Monday, they told her that water supplies were cut and that none of the displaced had been able to shower for at least two weeks.\n“God be with them. Their situation is miserable.”\nFather Ibrahim Nino of the Latin Patriarchate in Jerusalem said the displaced at the church have enough food, water and electricity to last them days and must be frugal.\nBut regardless of the difficult situation, he said, they will celebrate Christmas mass.\nThis year, church leaders in Jerusalem and the city council of Bethlehem — home to the Church of the Nativity where Christians believe Christ was born — decided to dampen Christmas celebrations in solidarity with Gazans.\nAnd in a Christmas message, the patriarchs and heads of churches in Jerusalem lamented that “hope seems distant and beyond” reach for Gazans caught up in 11-weeks of deadly violence.\n“Christmas should be a time of hope and celebration,” said Sayegh. But “it’s really hard to celebrate or feel any joy when Muslims and Christians are being massacred in Gaza and innocent civilians are dying”.\n“I still rejoice in the fact that we know God is with us... He feels the pain of people, of all people.”",

    "text": "[Ninjastrikers](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Protest_against_military_coup_(9_Feb_2021,_Hpa-An,_Kayin_State,_Myanmar)_(7).jpg)) [Myanmar junta extends state of emergency by 6 months](#) Myanmar’s ruling military junta [announced](https://myawady.net.mm/node/51566) Wednesday that they have extended the country’s state of emergency period for another six months, according to military-run media Myawady TV’s web portal. The junta previously [extended](https://www.jurist.org/news/2023/08/myanmar-ruling-junta-postpones-election-promised-by-august-this-year/) the state of emergency period by six months on July 31, 2023 and postponed an election it promised to hold in August 2023. The state of emergency was first declared in the aftermath of the [2021 coup](https://www.jurist.org/news/2023/02/myanmar-dispatch-two-years-after-the-military-coup-myanmar-people-stage-a-silent-strike/) and has been continuously extended since then. While [Article 425 of the Constitution](https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Myanmar_2008) stipulates that a state of emergency will usually only be extended twice at maximum, the junta [stated](https://myawady.net.mm/node/51585) that it was necessary to extend the state of emergency as Myanmar was in an unusual situation. The junta also said that the rule of law in Myanmar was weak and that local ethnics in some parts of northern Myanmar were deprived of socioeconomic lives due to the [armed conflicts](https://www.jurist.org/news/2023/12/china-warns-against-travel-to-northern-myanmar-as-unrest-continues/). The junta claimed that they are aiming to develop a more effective public defense system to improve public security in Myanmar. It commended its military personnel in stating that they engaged in “brave and daring actions … [to protect] the destructive activities that are currently undermining the stability and security of the country.” In addition, the junta blamed opposing organizations for keeping the country from conducting multi-party democratic elections in Myanmar. The leading opposing organization, the [National Unity Government](https://www.jurist.org/news/2021/04/ousted-myanmar-leaders-form-parallel-government-to-end-military-junta/) (NUG), came together in April 2021 after many now-members were ousted from the ruling government in the 2021 coup. Since then, the NUG has operated as a government in exile. UN Security-General António Guterres [expressed concerns](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2024-01-31/statement-attributable-the-spokesperson-for-the-secretary-general-%E2%80%93-myanmar) on Wednesday over the protection of civilians in Myanmar. He wrote that the country’s humanitarian [crisis](https://www.jurist.org/news/2022/12/myanmar-dispatch-the-military-juntas-repressive-rules-make-our-lives-harder/) has continued to deteriorate and emphasized the importance of ensuring that all communities in Myanmar are protected. On January 23, the Centre for Information Resilience [suggested](https://www.jurist.org/news/2024/01/rerport-claims-churches-hit-by-military-airstrikes-in-myanmar/) that there was a correlation between areas in Myanmar under the junta’s martial law and those subject to airstrikes. It also stated that ethnic and religious minorities were targeted by the military. On December 21, 2022, the UN Security Council [expressed concerns](https://www.jurist.org/news/2022/12/un-security-council-condemns-myanmar-military-junta/) over the state of emergency extension and criticized the junta for executing pro-democracy activists.",
