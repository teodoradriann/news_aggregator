Ryan Hunter (third-left) were commemorated during a ceremony at the Capitol Rotunda Friday by officials including Lt. Gov. Jacqueline Coleman (second-right) and Adjutant General Haldane Lamberton (far right). (Shepherd Snyder / WEKU) Two members of the Kentucky National Guard were honored Friday with the Kentucky Medal for Valor for their role in rescuing flood victims two years ago.\nSgt. 1st Class Jeremy Lowe and Staff Sgt. Ryan Hunter were presented with the commendation by Lieutenant Governor Jacqueline Coleman and Adjutant General Haldane (Hahl-dayn) B. Lamberton during a ceremony at the capitol rotunda.\nBoth men were involved in dangerous rescue operations that included rappelling from a helicopter and through rooftops to save victims that would have drowned in their homes otherwise.\nLamberton presented the two men with the award. He also recognized how rare the commendation is.\n“In the past two plus decades and doing a little bit of research, including today's presentation, we've only recognized some of our service members seven times,” Lamberton said.\nLowe credited everyone else involved in the rescue missions during his speech at the ceremony.\n“This award is not just the recognition of the actions of two flight paramedics. It is a testament to the extraordinary teamwork, bravery, dedication of countless individuals and organizations being united during the devastating floods,” Lowe said.\nThe National Guard rescued 241 victims of the eastern Kentucky floods two years ago.\n** WEKU is working hard to be a leading source for public service, and fact-based journalism.

    "title": "AI-capable PCs forecasted to become norm by 2027",
    "text": "New research commissioned by Canalys predicts a transformative role for Artificial Intelligence (AI) in personal computing, with the expectation that AI-capable PCs will become the norm within the next five to seven years. The report suggests that this technological progression stands poised to revitalise the PC sector and substantially alter user experiences in a number of ways, especially in terms of efficiency, productivity and creativity. The study outlines several key findings, including a prediction that by 2027, 60% of PCs in circulation will possess AI capabilities. Initially, the key drivers of adoption are expected to emerge from the commercial sector, given that more than 60% of AI-capable PCs are projected to be sold to corporate buyers by 2027. As AI becomes more widespread, Canalys expects private consumer adoption to increase, especially for creative applications.\nThe Canalys report underlines the important role that businesses will play in the uptake of AI-capable systems. It predicts a \"major refresh cycle\" around 2024-2025, following the withdrawal of support for the current operating system, Windows 10. This juncture is likely to be exploited as an opportunity for businesses to migrate their existing hardware to AI-capable systems.\nPC manufacturers recognised in the report, including Dell, HP and Lenovo, are already gearing up for an AI future with waves of AI-accelerated models set to hit the market in 2024. Canalys emphasises the necessity of these companies to take an \"open, growth mindset focused on user needs.\"\nIn the development of AI-capable PCs, a crucial role is foreseen for leading chip developers such as Intel, AMD, Apple and Qualcomm. All have incorporated dedicated AI acceleration hardware, known as Neural Processing Units (NPUs), into CPU designs. True sector progression, however, is dependent on cooperative engineering between hard and software developers.\nCrucially, the inevitable privacy and ethical concerns surrounding on-device AI must be addressed to achieve mainstream adoption. Canalys recommends that technology vendors keep communication clear and transparent and impose stringent privacy and ethical standards over data use. Hopefully, public trust can be built in this way, and the adoption of AI-based technologies will accelerate accordingly.\nBased on this research, it's clear that AI integration into personal computing has the potential to revolutionise the industry. Going forward, the key task will be to negotiate the challenges that such a potentially transformative evolution may bring.\nThe commissioner of this research, Canalys, is a technology market research firm that specialises in providing analysis, insights, and advisory services related to the technology industry. The company focuses on tracking and analysing global technology market trends, including smartphones, tablets, PCs, cloud computing, cybersecurity, and emerging technologies.\nCanalys is known for its reports, market forecasts, and consulting services that help businesses, technology vendors, and investors make informed decisions in the rapidly evolving tech landscape.\nThe firm covers a wide range of topics, including market share analysis, channel strategies, emerging technologies, and the impact of digital transformation on various industries. Canalys often releases reports and commentary on major technology events and product launches, contributing to a better understanding of market dynamics and trends within the technology sector.",

    "text": "Bunnings, whose in-store facial recognition technology breached privacy laws, partnered with Victoria Police during a trial of the system.\nPrivacy Commissioner Carly Kind from the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) was heavily critical of the Bunnings system which captured the faces of every person – including children – who entered 63 Bunnings stores in Victoria and New South Wales between November 2018 and November 2021via its CCTVs.\nBunnings compared a customer’s face against a “limited database” of less than 500 banned people, working with Victoria Police to identify those individuals, reported The Australian.\nThe recordings of its customers is reported to have stayed within its stores, with no sensitive information uploaded to the cloud or sent to third-party processors.\nThe Wesfarmers-owned chain said that the sole purpose was to prevent violent crime in its stores, and it required human oversight.\nIt noted that its FRT system was only accessible by six “specially trained Bunnings team members who were located in a centralised location”.\n“No other team members had access to the FRT,” it added.\nVideo explaining why Bunnings says it used FRT.\nIt reportedly did not automatically alert police of a threat. After it detected a customer had been banned from one of its stores for abusive, violent behaviour or committing a crime, one of those six staff members then performed a manual check to verify that it was an accurate match.\nIf there was no match, customer data was reported to be deleted in “0.00417 seconds”.\nKind from the OAIC noted though that deploying facial recognition technology “was the most intrusive option, disproportionately interfering with the privacy of everyone who entered its stores, not just high-risk individuals.”\nCommissioner Kind noted that Bunnings “collected individuals’ sensitive information without consent, failed to take reasonable steps to notify individuals that their personal information was being collected, and did not include required information in its privacy policy.”\nOAIC Commissioner Carly Kind\nBunnings has defended its use of the technology with statistics such as there being a 50 per cent increase in incidents of abuse, threats and assaults in its stores last year.\nAdditionally it noted that for the 12 months ending April 2024, there were about 700,000 retail crime events recorded by Australian retailers with 16 per cent of those constituting threatening or violent behaviour, and 60 per cent of store thefts are conducted by the same 10 per cent of people.",

    "text": "Por fin 2023 nos trae una buena noticia, se ha hecho esperar pero ya tenemos la buena noticia del año: que se acaba. La mejor noticia de 2023 es que por fin se acaba, que en dos días despediremos un año abundante en malas noticias. No es que por una vez esté de acuerdo con Feijóo y piense que este año “han ocurrido todas las indignidades imaginables a la vez”; pero basta hacer memoria o leer los resúmenes anuales que estos días publican los medios, y está claro: ha sido un año de mierda. No ya es que en 2023 volviese a ser, parafraseando al Colectivo Todoazen, “el año que tampoco hicimos la revolución”. Es que nos contentamos con haber sobrevivido a doce meses de sustos y destrozos. La guerra en Gaza –que ya ha superado los 21.000 muertos– sin haber terminado la de Ucrania –estancada y acumulando muertos, destrucción y dinero de occidente en armamento–; los nuevos avances de la ultraderecha en el mundo –con Milei a la cabeza en Argentina–; el planeta batiendo récords históricos de temperatura mes a mes y estación a estación; la cumbre del clima que no sirvió para gran cosa mientras seguimos cruzando líneas rojas en la crisis climática. Y en España, la ultraderecha entrando en gobiernos municipales y autonómicos, imponiendo su agenda en materia de derechos sociales y cultura, a la vez que ocupando las calles en las protestas contra la amnistía.\nMe propuse terminar el año, igual que el anterior, recopilando las buenas noticias que también ha habido y que pasan desapercibidas o se olvidan bajo la impresión de año nefasto. Pero por más que lo he intentado, no he encontrado muchos motivos para la esperanza en este 2023. Así que he preguntado a gente de mi entorno, a ver si recuerdan cosas buenas que también hayan pasado este año, y nos quitamos entre todos el mal sabor de boca. Me ha salido un artículo colaborativo, ahí van algunas buenas noticias que me han recordado amigas y amigos a los que nombraré en agradecimiento:\nEl freno a la derecha y la ultraderecha el 23-J es la buena noticia más repetida: esa bala que nos pasó rozando, faltaron unos pocos miles de votos para que hoy Abascal fuera vicepresidente del Gobierno, y quién sabe si el matón Ortega Smith tendría también un ministerio. Que la sociedad española se movilizase contra los sondeos y contra el fatalismo, y consiguiera revertir la tendencia mundial al ascenso ultra, es la noticia del año para la ciudadanía de izquierda.\nJunto a ello, que finalmente haya un gobierno progresista, con todas sus dificultades, y el mantenimiento de las principales medidas del escudo social, salva un poco el mal año político. El uso de las lenguas cooficiales en el Congreso fue también un avance, me recuerda Marta. Y algunas medidas que sí salieron este año, como las bajas para las menstruaciones dolorosas, que recuerda Elena; o la ley de bienestar animal, que persigue el maltrato a los animales, y que está entre lo mejor del año para Marta y Victoria.\nLo mismo con la guerra de Gaza: el reverso positivo de la mala noticia del año es la movilización ciudadana en todo el mundo, mayoritaria en señalar los crímenes de Israel y en solidarizarse con el pueblo palestino. A la agenda internacional añade Marta los procesos contra Trump en Estados Unidos, y José Manuel tiene un recuerdo para los ecuatorianos, que en referéndum decidieron proteger dos zonas naturales frente a petroleras y minería.\nTambién hubo buenas noticias en materia de memoria democrática: Paco me recuerda lo avanzado en las exhumaciones del Valle de Cuelgamuros, donde han encontrado restos de republicanos y con material genético viable para identificarlos. Paqui destaca que concluyese la exhumación de la fosa de Pico Reja en el cementerio de Sevilla, y Ricardo la inauguración del monumento a las víctimas en la misma fosa. Además, Joaquín recuerda cómo se localizó al asesino de Arturo Ruiz en Buenos Aires.\nLa victoria doble de la selección femenina de fútbol, ganando el mundial y logrando con el apoyo ciudadano echar a Rubiales, es una gran noticia para Marta, Antonio o Elena. José Antonio se acordó de ese instituto del Raval barcelonés, el Miquel Tarradell, modélico en su ambiente escolar y en sus resultados académicos teniendo un 95% de alumnado inmigrante, un buen argumento contra la agenda racista de la ultraderecha.\nEn Andalucía se creó el sindicato andaluz de Kellys, recuerda Charo. En Córdoba, Fabio señala la lucha de familias, profesorado y barrios que ha conseguido que el ayuntamiento dé marcha atrás en su intención de externalizar las plazas de portería de los colegios con seguridad privada. En Cádiz, recuerda Joaquín, la empresa concesionaria de la Ayuda a Domicilio fue condenada a pagar 60.000 euros a 25 trabajadoras. Y el Supremo reconoció a las parejas de hecho con familia numerosa los mismos derechos que a los matrimonios, gracias al abogado Luis Ocaña.\nJesús mira a los trabajadores suecos en su lucha contra Tesla; y Virginia a los docentes marroquíes, en huelga por la mejora de sus salarios, y cómo su lucha se va extendiendo a otros colectivos como funcionarios municipales o la sanidad pública de Marruecos. Alfons cuenta cómo los comercios de su pueblo valenciano han resistido a la pandemia y a la despoblación. José Manuel se acuerda de los 50 años de la cabalgata participativa de Hortaleza. Marta destaca la apertura de la encomienda cooperativa La Manuela en Villamartín (Sevilla). Y Olga reivindica la fuerza del colectivo DIME, de Docentes por la Inclusión y la Mejora Educativa, que están haciendo un importante trabajo.\nLa ciencia siempre deja buenas noticias: Marta recuerda el medicamento contra varios tipos de cáncer desarrollado por un científico español, Asier Unciti; o los ensayos clínicos exitosos en dos nuevos medicamentos para tratar el Alzheimer. Valle me cuenta que una científica vasca ha desarrollado junto a su equipo un sistema para detectar las fugas de metano en la industria fósil, y subraya la reducción en la deforestación en la Amazonia. Para José Antonio la buena noticia es que doce países africanos puedan recibir la primera vacuna contra la malaria, que podría salvar la vida de miles de niños. Y Juan recuerda que la OMS dio por acabada la pandemia de COVID.\nMarta añade una noticia cultural: el estreno de la película Creatura , que normaliza el placer femenino. Y Azahara celebra que haya sido el año de menor consumo televisivo en España.\nSeguro que hay muchas más buenas noticias. Si te acuerdas, puedes dejarlas en los comentarios, a ver si entre todos nos quitamos el mal sabor, y concluimos que ha sido un mal año, sí, incluso un muy mal año, pero lleno de buenas noticias. Venga, dime algo bueno del 2023.",

    "text": "A cheval sur leur ligne d’eau, Ugo Didier et Hector Denayer se font face, les bras en miroir. Encore un peu hébétés, les deux copains s’apprêtent à partager le podium du 200 mètres quatre nages, jeudi 5 septembre, respectivement deuxième et troisième (dans la catégorie SM9, dédiée aux nageurs ayant une déficience de la coordination, une faiblesse d’une jambe ou l’absence de membres). Un bis repetita pour les Français, déjà ensemble sur le podium des championnats d’Europe à Funchal (Portugal), fin avril, sur cette même épreuve (or pour Didier, argent pour son cadet). « On en avait rêvé aux championnats d’Europe et on l’avait fait. Cette fois-ci, on ne s’en est même pas parlé, car on savait qu’il y avait de la densité, on a juste cherché à faire notre course de notre côté et à donner le meilleur de nous-mêmes », racontait Hector Denayer. A tout juste 19 ans, le licencié de l’Alliance Dijon Natation avait déjà décroché l’argent sur le 100 m brasse (SB9), pour ses premiers Jeux paralympiques. Pour son aîné, âgé de 22 ans, c’est la troisième médaille depuis le début de la compétition, après l’or sur 400 m nage libre le premier jour et l’argent sur 100 m dos. « Quand je vois la lumière s’allumer sur mon plot, je suis supercontent, directement je regarde où s’est allumée la troisième lumière et quand je vois que c’est Hector tout au bout, je n’en reviens pas, a réagi Ugo Didier. [Ce doublé], on ne l’avait même pas envisagé tant la concurrence était dense. Partager un podium paralympique, c’est un moment extraordinaire. » Médailles autour du cou, les deux Français ont savouré leur victoire avec leur public, faisant la ola devant la marée de drapeaux tricolores. [Jeux paralympiques 2024 : Ugo Didier, sacré sur le 400 m nage libre, l’autre nageur surdoué de Toulouse](https://www.lemonde.fr/sport/article/2024/08/29/jeux-paralympiques-2024-ugo-didier-sacre-sur-le-400-m-nage-libre-l-autre-nageur-surdoue-de-toulouse_6298238_3243.html) Ola et tour d’honneur Ce doublé – le deuxième après celui des frères Portal – est d’autant plus inattendu que, jeudi matin, en séries, Hector Denayer s’était fait peur, se qualifiant d’extrême justesse. « J’ai eu un peu de chance de rentrer dans cette finale, mais j’ai su la concrétiser. Ce rôle d’outsider me va bien, je suis chez moi, je fais le show comme je sais le faire, a commenté le cadet, atteint d’agénésie de la main gauche. Je suis parti vite en papillon, en dos, j’ai réussi à m’accrocher et une fois que je suis parti en brasse, je ne voyais plus personne, j’étais isolé dans mon coin. » [Natation aux paralympiques 2024 : Alex et Kylian Portal, frères d’argent et de bronze](https://www.lemonde.fr/sport/article/2024/08/31/jeux-paralympiques-alex-et-kylian-portal-freres-d-argent-et-de-bronze_6300606_3242.html) Il s’est employé dans les quinze derniers mètres pour finalement signer un chrono de 2 min 17 s 34. Grand favori, l’Australien Timothy Hodge n’a jamais été inquiété (2 min 13 s 31), malgré la stratégie mise en place par Ugo Didier (2 min 15 s 98). « Je savais que ça allait être très difficile d’aller le chercher. Je voulais partir assez fort pour le faire un peu paniquer et qu’il se crispe dans sa nage. Bon, ça n’a pas marché, mais j’ai tout donné », s’est satisfait le Toulousain, qui ne s’était pas entraîné spécifiquement pour cette épreuve, cette année. Il vous reste 40.91% de cet article à lire.
