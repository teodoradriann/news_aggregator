    "text": "FILE PHOTO: 'X' logo is seen reflected on an apartment window across the street from the headquarters of the messaging platform X, formerly known as Twitter, in downtown San Francisco, California, U.S., July 30, 2023. REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File photo\n(Reuters) -Social media platform Bluesky is adding millions of users as people flee X after Donald Trump was elected U.S. President and as an upcoming change to the terms of service threatens to complicate legal challenges for the Elon Musk-owned platform.\nBluesky has gained about 2.5 million new users in the past week, raising its total users to more than 16 million, it said on Thursday. It is among a slew of apps looking to replace the platform formerly known as Twitter after Musk's takeover.\n\"We're seeing record-high activity levels across all different forms of engagement: likes, follows, new accounts, etc, and we're on track to add 1 million new users in one day alone,\" Bluesky said in a statement.\nSeveral well-known organizations and personalities, including the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate, British news publisher the Guardian and former CNN anchor Don Lemon have said they were leaving X due to concerns about the platform's content and the looming terms change.\nX was called out by misinformation experts during the election for playing a central role in enabling the spread of false information about the critical battleground states.\nOn Nov. 6, as news broke that Musk ally Trump won the presidency, X attracted 46.5 million visits in the U.S. - more than any day in the past year and 38% higher than an average day in recent months, according to analytics firm SimilarWeb.\nBut more than 115,000 U.S. web visitors deactivated their X accounts – the most since Musk bought the platform, SimilarWeb data showed.\nBluesky's website, meanwhile, attracted around 1.2 million visitors on Nov.6, more than Meta Platforms-owned Threads, which had around 950,000 visitors. But Threads app had more visitors than that of Bluesky.\n\"Outsized growth, particularly for Bluesky, may have been driven by a rise of controversial content or technical issues on competitor X,\" said Abraham Yousef, senior insights analyst at market intelligence firm Sensor Tower.\n\"The departure of popular accounts, media personalities, or organizations, may have led consumers to conclude that X is no longer their preferred platform, which could also be fueling growth on other platforms, particularly Bluesky and Threads.\"\nTERMS CHANGE\nThe Bluesky surge comes ahead of a change in X's terms on Friday that requires all legal disputes related to the platform to be brought exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas or state courts in Tarrant County, Texas.\nThe Center for Countering Digital Hate said on Thursday the change could hinder legal challenges against the platform by steering future lawsuits toward judges Musk believes \"will be on his side\".\n\"Now, the billionaire will be able to bring lawsuits to friendly courts against whoever disagrees with him on his platform,\" said the nonprofit that has faulted Musk for letting hate speech spread on X.\nX and Musk did not respond to requests for comment.\nStill, Bluesky's user count is much smaller than rivals. Threads has about 252 million monthly active users on its mobile app, while X has about 317 million, according to Sensor Tower.\n\"X seems to be in a better position than it has in a while given the ability to represent the views of president-elect Trump,\" said D.A. Davidson & Co analyst Gil Luria.\n\"While there are other competing platforms, those may have a hard time catching up with X, since microblogging has significant network effects.\"\n(Reporting by Aditya Soni and Jaspreet Singh in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Rishi Kant in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur)\nOpen Modal × Follow us on our official WhatsApp channel for breaking news alerts and key updates!

    "title": "Arsenal denied a return to Premier League summit as they are beaten by West Ham | Shropshire Star",
    "text": "The Gunners went down 2-0 at home Arsenal missed the chance to return to the top of the Premier League as they slipped to a disappointing defeat to West Ham amid more VAR controversy. The Gunners needed victory to replace Liverpool at the summit but lost 2-0 by the Hammers on a night where David Moyes finally landed a victory at the Emirates Stadium. His West Ham side lost Kurt Zouma ahead of the game and Lucas Paqueta after just over half an hour but hit the front through Tomas Soucek’s strike, awarded after VAR could not determine whether the whole ball had gone out of play in the build-up. A second-half header from former Arsenal defender Konstantinos Mavropanos secured the points and things could have been even better for the visitors had Said Benrahma not seen a last-gasp penalty saved by David Raya. Moyes had failed to secure victory in his previous 72 Premier League away games at Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool or Manchester United, so this was a long time coming for the Scot. Arsenal laboured when they needed to continue their recent winning run in London derbies to go back to the top of the table. Instead, only captain Martin Odegaard could hold his head high on a night where their defence creaked and Gabriel Jesus was guilty of missing a couple of very good chances. Arsenal started well, with some great touches in and around the West Ham box from Odegaard in particular. But at the other end their defending left a lot to be desired, as Oleksandr Zinchenko and Gabriel Magalhaes failed to deal with a simple ball into the middle. Jarrod Bowen capitalised by latching onto the miscue and teed up Soucek to finish – the goal surviving a lengthy VAR check which could not ultimately make a call on if the ball had not gone out of play before Bowen’s cutback. Arsenal looked to respond although the goal gave West Ham something to defend, although Jesus found a way in behind with a subtle flick into Bukayo Saka, whose header was brilliantly saved by Alphonse Areola. Paqueta had been hurt in the warm-up and lasted just over half an hour, with his fellow Brazilian Gabriel Martinelli curling an effort just wide for Arsenal as they continued in vain to find a leveller. The hosts were getting closer, West Ham gifting possession as two passes saw Arsenal in on goal once more, this time Saka hitting the base of the post from an acute angle. Former West Ham captain Declan Rice fired just over from 25 yards but it was another player coming back to haunt his former club who would find the back of the net soon after. Mavropanos made just seven league starts in three years as an Arsenal player but returned to the Premier League last summer with the Hammers and headed them two goals ahead before the hour. Jesus then headed straight at Areola before sending another fine chance well over the bar moments after Arteta introduced Eddie Nketiah and Reiss Nelson off the bench. Areola was on hand again to keep out a Leandro Trossard effort, with Vladimir Coufal clearing a William Saliba header off the line from the resulting corner. Rice had come off the bench during a 3-0 Carabao Cup defeat on his return to West Ham earlier in the season and endured another night to forget here as he conceded a late penalty for tripping Emerson Palmieri in the box – only for Raya to keep out substitute Benrahma’s tame spot-kick.",

    "text": "Lahore, May 25 (PTI) A mob led by radical Islamists on Saturday unleashed an attack on Christians in Pakistan Punjab province over the allegations of desecration of the Quran that left at least two members from the minority community injured, one of them seriously, police said. The incident took place in Mujahid Colony Sargodha district of Punjab, some 200 km from Lahore in the morning.

Several video clips of the mob attack on the properties of the Christian community are doing rounds on social media.

The mob led by radical Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) activists attacked the Christian community, burning and ransacking their property. According to senior Punjab police officer Asad Ejaz Malhi, a heavy contingent of police has reached Mujahid Colony and dispersed the mob which had surrounded some houses (of Christians) over the allegations of the desecration of the Quran. He said one injured person has been shifted to a hospital and police have been deployed there to maintain law and order. Another police officer told PTI that on Saturday morning some youth in Mujahid Colony alleged that one Nazir Gill Masih desecrated the Quran. &quot;Following their allegations, a mob led by the TLP activists marched towards the residence and a factory of Nazir. They set ablaze his shoe factory and his house. They also ransacked a few shops owned by Christians. Before police could reach the spot, the mob lynched and thrashed Nazir,&quot; he said. However, the police were able to rescue Nazir and shifted him to the hospital where his condition was stated to be critical, the officer said. He said another Christian man also suffered injuries. Ifran Gill, a relative of Nazir, told PTI that his uncle had returned from Dubai after four years. He said some people in the locality accused him falsely of desecration of the Quran. He said the Christian families saved their lives by locking themselves inside their houses when the mob marched towards them. He said the environment has been tense in the area and the Christians are terrified. &quot;Another Jaranwala style attack on Christians in Sargodha with mob attacking the local community, burning and ransacking property. The failure of the State to take any serious and sincere action against perpetrators of the Jaranwala incident has only emboldened those who exploit religious sentiments for their criminal acts,&quot; Human rights lawyer and politician Jibran Nasir said on X. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) said it was seriously concerned by the unfolding situation in Sargodha, where the Christian community in Gillwala village is reportedly at grave risk to their lives at the hands of charged mobs. &quot;There are unconfirmed reports of a man having been allegedly lynched,&#8221; the HRCP said on X and asked the Punjab police to immediately restore calm and bring the perpetrators to book, while ensuring that the Christian community comes to no further harm. Sara Taseer, daughter of slain Punjab governor Salman Taseer, said: &quot;The poor Pak Christian community reaches out to me for help when lynchings stir up. Before X was banned, I could alert some groups to help when there was an attack and try to avert the worst. But now they are more cornered than ever.&quot; Last year at least 24 churches and over 80 houses belonging to Christians in Jaranwala tehsil of Faisalabad district, some 130 km from the provincial capital, were burnt down by a mob over reports that two Christians had desecrated the Quran.

    "text": "Toronto, Dec 29 (IANS) Canadian police said it is investigating an incident in which shots were fired at the residence of a Hindu temple's head’s son in British Columbia in the early hours of Wednesday.Police said no one was injured during the incident at the 14900 block of 80 Avenue in Surrey -- the residence of the son of Satish Kumar, president of Lakshmi Narayan Mandir.\n\"Officers are still working to determine the motive of this incident,\" said Constable Parmbir Kahlon, Media Relations Officer for Surrey RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted Police).\nKahlon added that the residence involved sustained damage consistent with bullet holes.\nAccording to the Indo-Canadian voice website, as many as 14 shots were fired at the Hindu businessman's house.\nPolice remained in the area, examining the scene, speaking with witnesses and canvassing the neighbourhood for CCTV footage.\nThe Surrey RCMP General Investigation Unit is conducting the probe, and has appealed to anyone with more information, including dash cam footage of the incident, to get in touch with them.\nCanada has witnessed a rise in incidents of vandalism and attacks against Hindu temples and installations in the country with pro-Khalistan elements getting active beginning this year.\nThe situation worsened after Khalistani leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar was shot dead outside a Sikh temple in Surrey on June 18 this year.\nThe same Lakshmi Narayan Mandir of Surrey was targeted in August this year after anti-India and pro-Khalistan posters were found pasted on its front and rear walls.\nLast month, Indian-origin Canadian MP Chandra Arya shared a purported video of pro-Khalistan supporters in Surrey, claiming they want to create trouble at the Lakshmi Narayan Mandir.\nIn September, Shri Mata Bhameshwari Durga temple in Surrey was defaced with anti-India and pro-Khalistan graffiti on its outer walls.\nIncidents of vandalism have also occurred at temples in Brampton and the Greater Toronto area.\n--IANS\nmi/dan\nAdd Chart to Comment",

    "text": "Amidst a fluctuating global economy, Silvano Fashion Group has reported a notable improvement in financial performance for the year 2023, signaling resilience and strategic expansion in the retail sector. This analysis delves into the key financial indicators, investment activities, and personnel changes that marked the company's journey through the year, juxtaposed against the broader context of tech-driven efficiency gains in the industry.\nFinancial Milestones Achieved\n2023 proved to be a year of growth for Silvano Fashion Group, with sales reaching 58,597 thousand EUR, a modest but significant increase of 1.6% over the previous year. A more pronounced growth was observed in the company's gross profit, which soared by 9.3% to 33,743 thousand EUR, underpinned by a gross margin improvement of 7.5% and a reduction in the cost of sold goods by 7.2%. This financial upswing was further accentuated by a 22.6% increase in consolidated operating profit, amounting to 17,973 thousand EUR, and a 15.5% hike in consolidated EBITDA, totaling 21,120 thousand EUR. Despite these gains, the reported consolidated net profit attributable to equity holders dipped to 9,927 thousand EUR, from a higher margin in the preceding year.\nStrategic Investments and Structural Adjustments\nIn alignment with its growth trajectory, the Group channeled 1,133 thousand EUR into property, plant, and equipment, marking a significant uptick from the previous year's investment. This capital injection primarily facilitated the opening and refurbishment of retail outlets, alongside enhancements in production efficiency. Personnel dynamics within the Group also witnessed subtle shifts, with a slight increase in the workforce to 1,626 employees, reflecting the company's commitment to bolstering its retail and production capabilities. Concurrently, the Group's financial solidity was underscored by a 12.9% increase in consolidated assets, reaching 72,252 thousand EUR as of December 31, 2023.\nCorporate Governance and Future Outlook\nThe year also saw pivotal decisions made by the Group's governing bodies, including the proposal to adopt resolutions of the annual general meeting of shareholders without convening a physical meeting, a testament to the evolving corporate governance practices in the digital age. Looking ahead, Silvano Fashion Group's strategic investments and operational optimizations, especially in the realm of AI and tech integration, as hinted by broader industry trends\n(source), position it favorably for sustained growth amidst evolving market dynamics.\nThe financial resilience and strategic adaptability demonstrated by Silvano Fashion Group in 2023 not only reflect its robust response to global economic challenges but also spotlight the potential for leveraging technology to enhance operational efficiencies. As the retail sector continues to navigate the complexities of digital transformation, the Group's performance offers valuable insights into the synergies between traditional retail strategies and cutting-edge technological advancements. With a clear focus on sustainable growth and market responsiveness, Silvano Fashion Group is poised to continue its trajectory of innovation and financial strength in the years to come.",
