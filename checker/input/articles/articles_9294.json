    "text": "By Brad Harvey ,\n2 hours ago The Kentucky Wildcats’ 2025 transfer portal class is shaping up to be a strong one. With 18 incoming transfers, the team is making significant moves to bolster its roster.\nKey Additions Mi’Quise Grace: A four-star recruit and FCS All-American EDGE from South Dakota, who chose Kentucky over Mississippi State, USC, and Georgia.\nDavid Gusta: A defensive lineman from Washington State, ranked No. 151 in the transfer portal.\nJosh Braun: An interior offensive lineman with experience from Florida and Arkansas.\nSam Greene: An EDGE rusher from USC.\nLandyn Watson: A linebacker from Marshall.\nKentucky football’s wide receiver transfer portal class is looking promising, with several key additions as well.\nWide Receiver Additions Kendrick Law: A blue-chip prospect from Alabama who never quite lived up to expectations, but brings valuable experience to the table.\nJ.J. Hester: A veteran receiver from Missouri who had a productive year in 2021 under their wide receivers coach Bush Hamdan (who is now Kentucky Offensive Coordinator).\nTru Edwards: A seasoned wideout from Louisiana Tech who brings a strong track record, including 166 career receptions and a first-team All-CUSA selection.\nTroy Stellato: A transfer from Clemson, adding depth to the Wildcats’ receiving corps.\nThese additions have been guided by new wide receivers coach L’Damian Washington, who’s already making an impact on the recruiting trail. With Washington’s expertise and these new transfers, the Wildcats are looking to revamp their wide receiver room after some key losses transferring out.\nKentucky Football Full Transfer Portal Class Quarterbacks – Zach Calzada (Texas A&M/Auburn/Incarnate Word)\nRunning Backs – Dante Dowdell (Oregon/Nebraska)\nWide Receivers – J.J. Hester (Missouri/Oklahoma) – Kendrick Law (Alabama) – Troy Stellato (Clemson) – Tru Edwards (Louisiana Tech)\nTight Ends – Henry Boyer (Illinois)\nOffensive Linemen – Alex Wollschlaeger (Bowling Green) – Wallace Unamba (Florida Atlantic/New Mexico) – Joshua Braun (Florida/Arkansas) – Evan Wibberley (WKU)\nDefensive Linemen – Jaden Williams (Wyoming) – David Gusta (Washington State)\nLinebackers – Landyn Watson (TCU/Marshall)\nDefensive Backs – Kevis Thomas (Maryland)\nEdge Rushers – Sam Greene (USC) – Kameron Olds (Buffalo/Kent State) – Mi’Quise Grace (South Dakota)\nWhat It Means These additions address key needs for the Wildcats, including defensive line, edge rusher, and interior offensive line. 24/7 Sports has the class ranked seventh overall and fourth in the SEC to this point. The Wildcats are still in the running to add a highly rated left tackle, a cornerback, and possibly 1-2 others to the class.\nAfter last year’s disappointing 4-8 season, it is going to take seeing how the class translates on the field in the SEC. While good on paper, it doesn’t always mean the talent will make a strong push to compete near the top in the SEC.\nSubscribe to College SportsCast for fun, original college sports shows.

    "text": "OKC Thunder’s Success Reflected in Low Turnover Percentage\nOklahoma City has had sustainable success all season long, building off of last season’s rise to the top. Currently, the Thunder has the best record in the NBA, tied with the Cleveland Cavaliers at 56-12. Cleveland’s two consecutive losses have opened up a spot at the top, and Oklahoma City is 9-1 in its last 10 games.\nThis Thunder team has learned to win in many different ways. They are praised for their defense, and Mark Daigneault’s operation can certainly be attributed to wins, but the offense has caught fire recently, too. Oklahoma City has shown the ability to roll out a tall, double-big lineup — but they have also dominated by small ball, too. With all the injuries throughout the roster from top to bottom, OKC has been able to give so many guys experience, too.\nOne constant that has remained no matter what lineup is on the floor is Oklahoma City’s ability to take care of the ball. Fully healthy or injured, big or small, hot or cold offensively, the Thunder has been ultra committed to taking care of the ball at a high level.\nCurrently, Oklahoma City averages the least turnovers per game across the entire NBA at just 11.8 per night. Coincidentally, the top three of least turnovers committed is rounded out by Boston and Cleveland — the NBA’s second and third best teams in no specific order. The top three teams in the league are the teams that are committing the fewest turnovers.\nPart of the reason Oklahoma City ranks high on this list is the decision making of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. Most high-volume superstars that are near the top of the league in drives to the basket have high turnover percentages, but not SGA. The Thunder’s MVP candidate is averaging just 2.5 turnovers compared to 6.2 assists and the ball is in his hands all night every night.\nThere is not a single player in Oklahoma City’s active rotation averaging more turnovers than assists. The Thunder have built its roster full of high IQ, winning basketball players that know how to take care of the ball at a premium.\nThe Thunder’s spot at the top is a testament to the team’s buy-in and doing all of the little things right. If Oklahoma City continues to take care of the rock and limit turnovers, the sky is the limit in the postseason.\nWant to join the discussion?

    "text": "Checo Pérez es 'destrozado' en las votaciones a lo mejor de la F1 y termina décimo Los pilotos de la [Fórmula 1](https://www.record.com.mx/formula1) eligieron a los mejores de la temporada 2023, y como era de esperarse, [Max Verstappen](https://www.record.com.mx/formula1) arrasó en las votaciones para posicionarse en el primer puesto, sin embargo, sorprendió que a la mayoría no les gustó el desempeño del subcampeón mexicano [Sergio Pérez](https://www.record.com.mx/formula1), quien terminó hasta el décimo puesto. Por sexto año consecutivo, la máxima categoría solicitó a los integrantes de la parrilla ordenar del 1 al 10 los que consideren los mejores pilotos del año y se aplica el sistema de puntos de un gran premio de F1 para llegar al orden definitivo. 'Mad Max' consiguió este 2023 su tercer título mundial de pilotos con una temporada récord en la que ganó 19 de los 22 grandes premios disputados, mostrando gran dominio de principio a fin, por lo que es posible que todos los pilotos los hayan puesto en el primer puesto. Por su parte, 'Checo' Pérez conquistó su primer subcampeonato, aunque realmente tuvo una temporada muy irregular, pues tuvo bastantes errores en las clasificaciones que le costaron muchos puntos. El tapatío terminó cayendo dos puestos a comparación del año pasado en la misma votación. Quien repuntó fue Lewis Hamilton, aunque fue el único piloto que no participó en la encuesta. El piloto británico logró culminar en la tercera posición del campeonato mundial de pilotos, lo que le valió el reconocimiento de sus compañeros para terminar en la segunda plaza de las votaciones.

    "text": "He complained about everything from artwork with rainbows in it to \"LGBTQ lanyards.\" By Mira Lazine Thursday, June 13, 2024 Photo: Shutterstock A dad who accused school officials of “grooming and abusing” children just got hit with a $20 million defamation lawsuit.\nDamon Gettier, the parent and defendant in question, appeared at a May 18, 2023 meeting with the school board where he, after having made Facebook posts angry about gay people existing at the school, went on a long rant where he called LGBTQ+ materials at schools indoctrination and grooming, the Roanoke Times reports.\nRelated: Public school tried to ban student’s lesbian art work because it’s “offensive” to Christians Her piece was about religious trauma that LGBTQ+ people deal with, and it apparently struck a nerve.\n“What I’m here to talk about is the child abuse, grooming, conditioning, and indoctrination by sexual predators disguised as teachers and staff at Glen Cove Elementary,” Gettier said.\nStay connected to your community Connect with the issues and events that impact your community at home and beyond by subscribing to our newsletter.\nDaily Weekly Good News “We have five plus staff and faculty conditioning, grooming, and abusing children, and no one says a thing… The teachers and staff need to teach their curriculum and not their woke, progressive ideologies,” he said.\n“I will not stand for it!”\nGlen Cove Elementary School Assistant Principal Tobie McPhail, who filed the lawsuit last month, referred to Gettier’s claims as false and harmful, having caused her emotional distress and damaged her career.\nGettier was also angry about trans issues being discussed in front of his son, accusing a teacher of saying that “a boy could be a girl and a girl could be a boy and they could decide.”\n“I had to explain to my nine-year-old what transgender was because Glen Cove Elementary woke staff put me in a situation where I had to,” he said.\nGettier also complained about a music teacher putting up rainbow decorations across her classroom. He was upset when a psychologist had an “LGBTQ lanyard” and that students drew art involving Pride flags, and he was also angry that teachers with “woke, progressive ideologies” were bringing up topics he didn’t want kids to hear about.\n“The guidance counselor, the school psychologist, the assistant principal, and the music teacher were bent on indoctrinating our children on LGBTQA and not reading, writing, and arithmetic.”\nOther parents spoke at the meeting against LGBTQ+ people, but Gettier was the only one who named specific members of the staff and accused them of grooming children.\nThe school board banned rainbow decorations after Gettier’s outburst and implemented Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s (R) policies for transgender youth in schools, which include the forced misgendering or deadnaming of kids who don’t have parents’ permission, allowing youth to “opt-out” of being near trans kids in gendered spaces, and forced outing of trans kids to their parents.\nMcPhail’s attorneys, John Fishwick and Daniel Martin of Roanoke, described her as “a long-time educator and administrator who has worked tirelessly throughout her career to ensure that all children receive a quality education in a safe learning environment.”\n“We have great respect for her and look forward to moving ahead with her case.”\nMcPhail is asking for $5 million in compensatory damages and $5 million in punitive damages.\nGettier’s outrage inspired protests shortly after in solidarity with the school, as many in the community felt they were being unfairly targeted. Protestors held up signs calling to support their teachers and saying that their favorite color is the rainbow.\nThere were arrests at board meetings in July and August last year after people opposed the school’s policies regarding LGBTQ+ representation. The arrestees opposed the discriminatory new policies. Causes for arrest vary from trespassing to disruption.\nDon't forget to share:\nNews (USA) Anti-Trans Discrimination Virginia Support vital LGBTQ+ journalism Reader contributions help keep LGBTQ Nation free, so that queer people get the news they need, with stories that mainstream media often leaves out.

    "title": "Zelensky needs to go before Ukraine collapses",
    "text": "There is an [emerging consensus in the Biden administration](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/12/27/biden-endgame-ukraine-00133211) that Ukraine is barely hanging on in its war with Russia and that some sort of negotiated settlement will be needed. While this is portrayed as the “long held” policy of President Biden, the truth is it is just the reverse: It has been the Biden administration that has blocked all attempts to broker a peace deal with Russia. Biden and company have embraced Zelensky for the same reason: Zelensky, who more than a year ago was open to a deal with the Russians, fell into line with Biden’s national security team and even got the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine’s parliament, to pass a law making it unlawful for him to deal with the Russians while the war was going on. The United States and its NATO allies have poured massive amounts of military hardware and ammunition into Ukraine, have provided the backbone for Ukrainian strategic intelligence, trained Ukrainian troops, and have put advisers in the field, some of whom have been killed in action. If the reports are true about the Russian [Iskander strike](https://www.militarytoday.com/missiles/iskander.htm) on Kherson on December 27th, four UK Patriot operators were killed along with 60 other soldiers and police when Russian rockets slammed into the Kherson train depot. On the battlefield the Ukrainian army is facing defeats. Setbacks are seen nearly everywhere along the line of contact. The Russians have forced the Ukrainians out of Marinka, a strategic Donbas village, and are clearing the villages around Bakhmut, Avdiivka, Bradley Square in Zaphorize, and elsewhere. Valery Zaluzhny, overall commander of Ukraine’s military, expects that the town of Avdiivka will fall in the next few months. In fact the Ukrainians either will have to pull out sooner or end up on a suicide mission trying to hold out against devastating attacks. On the political front cracks are getting wider. Ylulia Timoshenko served as Ukraine’s prime minister two times and is now a serving member in Ukraine’s Parliament under the banner of the Batkivshchyna (Fatherland) political party. She is a supporter of Ukraine’s membership in the EU and NATO. [Timoshenko says](https://www.rt.com/russia/589786-tymoshenko-ukraine-plan-b-zelensky/) that the country is at a dead end and is facing defeat. Politicians who say such things in Ukraine most often are arrested or exiled or, as in the case of former Ukrainian President [Petro Poroshenko, ](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-ex-president-says-he-was-blocked-leaving-country-2023-12-01/)are stopped at the border by Ukraine’s secret service. Even worse happens if they cross Zelensky. Treason charges have recently been brought against politician [Oleksandr Dubinsky](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukrainian-politician-us-sanctions-list-suspected-state-treason-lawmakers-2023-11-13/), and he is not alone. Ukraine is facing a huge manpower problem as it suffers more and more battlefield casualties. A war of words broke out this week between Zaluzhny and Zelensky on exactly who ordered a forced recruitment of another 500,000 soldiers. Zaluzhny says [he never proposed any number](https://www.kyivpost.com/post/25980). Zelensky [ says the armed forces asked him](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-67767246) for an additional 500,000 men. In fact, the number is irrelevant. What is important is that, to sign up new soldiers, Ukraine has to use impressment tactics: grabbing men from the street or from apartments, from cars, from clubs, at border crossings and any other place they can be found. The draft age is now between 18 and 60, and a Christmas [video of Ukrainian troops ](https://twitter.com/i/status/1739356122362818665)gathered together for holiday meals show mainly middle aged and older men, very few young people. As Zaluzhny and others have noted, the older soldiers cannot carry out all the tasks required because they lack the stamina of younger soldiers. Worse still, many of the soldiers do not want to serve. The [ forced recruitment of soldiers](https://twitter.com/i/status/1618458487243309067) has negative political implications for Ukraine’s leadership (which is why Zelensky was trying to blame it on Zaluzhny). It also has implications outside of Ukraine, because many draft-age men from Ukraine now are in Europe. Ukraine wants them forcibly returned to Ukraine. Estonian Interior Minister [ Lauri Laanemets ](https://www.rt.com/russia/589815-ukrainians-europe-passport-queues/)said Estonia could “hand over” able-bodied Ukrainian men. Other European countries are also considering similar actions. Ukraine says there will be harsh penalties for draft dodgers with fines and [prison sentences](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-67120904) up to 8 years. Other than bad health there are no exemptions available to eligible recruits. As a practical matter this means teachers, scientists, doctors, engineers and all others can be grabbed. As the noose tightens and dragoon measures to grab them step up, support for Zelensky will inevitably drop precipitously, especially in key cities such as Kiev, Odesa and Kharkiv. Even with the new mobilization, it will take months to train mostly unwilling recruits and put them on the battlefield. By then, Ukraine will have lost even more ground to the Russians. Russia also needs to soon make important military and political decisions. These may come after the Russian elections in mid-March. Putin, who again is seeking reelection, is facing discontent at home over the war. He has resisted additional call-ups of troops, arguing that there are enough volunteers to fulfil current requirements. So far Putin has not decided on any large-scale Russian offensive to exploit the Ukrainian army’s growing inability to stop Russian attacks. Russian military operations have been aimed at straightening and strengthening its territorial holdings in Ukraine. Moscow has not tried recently to expand beyond that task or to relaunch attacks aimed at actually defeating Ukraine’s army and forcing political change in Kiev. The reasons for that are threefold. Firstly, Russia knows that going on a massive offensive would be costly in terms of casualties and lost equipment. Secondly, Putin does not want to risk domestic unrest that could harm his political hold on the country. Thirdly, Russia wants to keep sufficient forces to protect Russia from a broader NATO war. Russian leaders are well aware that if the United States becomes desperate and fears Ukraine’s collapse, Washington may seek NATO’s actual entry into the war, using abundant air power and other resources to shore up the Ukrainian regime. As a result, Russian planning is careful to try and contain the war to Ukrainian territory, and to incrementally push the Ukrainians back, hoping for a negotiated deal, and avoiding a direct clash with NATO troops. Even in the context of the above constraints, the Ukrainians are being pushed back and the Ukraine army could collapse at any point in the near future. Russia is not likely to accept a ceasefire deal without a political settlement, as Putin would lose his standing at home. Zelensky won’t make any political agreement with Russia. Washington will be watching the situation unfold in the coming days and weeks, and will be worried that the entire landscape of the war could turn deadly negative for Washington and NATO. Since Washington’s under the table efforts to try arranging a ceasefire have not borne any fruit, the only choices are either to enter the war (which means a war in Europe) or to make a deal. If Washington really wants a political deal, Zelensky can’t negotiate it. He will have to go. Washington may decide the only way out is a coup d’état in Ukraine, replacing Zelensky with either a political or military leader willing to sit down with the Russians.
