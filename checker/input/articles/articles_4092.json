    "title": "Olympic Games Matildas have questions to answer everywhere after humbling by Germany - ESPN",
    "text": "Whatever the expectation was heading into the [Matildas](/football/team/_/id/2751/australia)' opening match of the [Olympic women's football tournament](/football/league/_/name/fifa.w.olympics), against [Germany](/football/team?id=2756), surely no one was expecting that. Goals to Marina Hegering , [Lea Schüller](/soccer/player/_/id/258844/lea-schuller), and Jule Brand gave the 2016 Olympic champions a [3-0 win](/football/match/_/gameId/699835/australia-germany) and the perfect opening to their tournament. For the Matildas, it was a horror start, a tough watch in the middle of the night for those back home, and a wakeup call according to captain Steph Catley . Morale was high with Catley and Caitlin Foord both deemed healthy enough to start after injury and precaution had kept them out of the Matildas' final warmup game against [Canada](/football/team?id=2753). Although Tameka Yallop was ruled out and replaced in the 18 by Sharn Freier , there was nothing obvious to worry about, personnel wise. But what followed was one of the worst games of consequence played by the Matildas under Tony Gustavsson. Moreover, it was confusing in how un-Matildas-like it was -- not just in defence but in attack. One of the strongest transformations under Gustavsson has been the Matildas' defensive stocks. It's an area of the pitch where assistant coach Jens Fjellstrom gets a lot of credit, and rightly so. Under his guidance and direction, the Australians have been able to nip silly defensive errors in the bud. There has been a concerted focus on set-piece defending, learning not to panic, and fostering stronger connections between the back four. And over the course of the past three-and-a-half years, the proof had been in the pudding. But the team's usual defensive solidity looked like it had been packed in the luggage that got lost on the team's charter flight from the training camp in Marbella to Marseille. Both Hegering and Schüller scored free headers from [Giulia Gwinn](/soccer/player/_/id/268102/giulia-gwinn) corners: Hegering ghosted between Ellie Carpenter and Alanna Kennedy at the far post while Schüller was simply left to her own devices, completely unmarked. If not for an offside [Alexandra Popp](/soccer/player/_/id/158735/alexandra-popp), Germany could have easily had a hat trick of easy, headed goals. It immediately bore dozens of memes, all using Sam Kerr 's quote about the [USWNT](/football/team/_/id/2765/united-states)'s record on defending set pieces -- \"do youse not work on that?\" -- from the Netflix documentary on the team's 2023 [FIFA Women's World Cup](/football/league/_/name/fifa.wwc). Ultimately, the first two goals were undeniable errors that the Matildas will be filthy with. And perhaps if they had been the only goals conceded, the aftermath wouldn't feel as bad as it does. But Germany's third goal was a team move that saw the Matildas a beat behind for the entire passage, with Brand tapping the ball into the back of the net. Those in yellow looked like dancers who hadn't been given the choreography but were trying their best to not to look out of place. Naturally, the talk postgame was about how those mistakes must be eliminated and quickly. But defensive errors aren't the only thing that require tweaking ahead of the [Zambia](/football/team?id=20795) clash on Monday (AEST). [Australia](/football/team?id=2751) also struggled up front; this was a scenario that felt more likely than the defensive stumbles but it was no less disappointing to watch. Gustavsson chose to employ Cortnee Vine as the No. 9. It was a decision that prioritised Mary Fowler as a free-roaming No. 10 with Foord out on the left to work in combination with her [Arsenal](/football/team?id=19973) teammate, Catley -- a connection Gustavsson leans on time and time again. But Vine as the central striker looked as untested as it felt. The general wisdom that Michelle Heyman would be better selected in the Matildas' second fixture since she can't play consecutive 90-minute games; but Vine as the next woman in to occupy that central space up top wasn't right either. On top of that, the Catley-Foord combination failed to capitalise on their bright moments while Fowler was unable to impact that game in the way she -- and Gustavsson and the nation -- wanted or needed. It begs the question: Do Gustavsson's attacking priorities need to be changed? Should Fowler be deployed out wide where she enjoyed success at club level? Does shifting Foord more central solve the No. 9 problem? Is there value in reprising the Fowler and Emily van Egmond double false No. 9 that enjoyed success in the small sample of games at the World Cup? Would that in any way solve the seeming disconnect between the midfield and the forward line in this game? These are the questions both Gustavsson and his team will ponder as they recover and immediately shift focus to Zambia in Nice. A lot needs to be tweaked in an incredibly short amount of time if the Matildas are to keep their medal dreams alive.",

    "text": "I am writing to publicly thank Congressman Ryan Zinke for his support of America’s military.\nCongressman Zinke is a retired Navy SEAL who was a part of SEAL Team One and SEAL Team Six. He earned numerous medals while serving, including two Bronze Stars, and served on Operation IRAQI FREEDOM. After 23 years of service, he retired as a Commander.\nZinke’s dedication to America is evident through his military service and he continues to be dedicated now as a Representative for Montana in Washington, D.C.\nIn June 2024, he voted to fully fund veterans’ healthcare programs. In July 2023, he voted for the National Defense Authorization Act to fund for the United States military and raise pay for our troops. Also in July 2023, he voted to fund veterans’ benefits and veterans’ programs.\nShockingly, these bills were not passed with unanimous, bipartisan support. Somehow, it has become a bold claim for members of Congress to unabashedly stand with our troops.\nA veteran with a strong backbone is rare these days, and for the sake of future generations, we need more veterans — especially statesmen like Ryan Zinke — elected to our government. If you agree, join me in electing more veterans to Congress.\nJohn Lind\nBelgrade\nLet the news come to you Get any of our free daily email newsletters — news headlines, opinion, e-edition, obituaries and more.\nExplore newsletters Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save Tags Ryan Zinke United States Politics Of The United States Federal Government Of The United States United States House Of Representatives Executive Branch Of The Government Of The United States Government Legislative Branch Of The United States Government Veteran Military Military Of The United States United States Congress American Politicians Politics Featured Local Savings Recommended for you sponsored",

    "text": "Cleveland FD honors 50th anniversary of fallen firefighters\nFirefighters Edward Gresky Jr . and John McNamee died while trying to save others\nBy Olivia Mitchell\ncleveland.com\nCLEVELAND, Ohio — The Cleveland Division of Fire on Thursday honored the 50th anniversary of two firefighters who died in the line of duty.\nRetirees, current members and cadets joined the families of firefighters Edward Gresky Jr . and John McNamee at the Cleveland Fire Training Academy at 3101 Lakeside Ave. to praise the two men who died while saving others.\n“If you are in danger, if you’re at risk, if you’re in need, we will risk our lives to find and save you,” said Anthony Luke, the city’s fire chief. “That is our commitment. That is our promise. Firefighters Gresky and McNamee honored that commitment. We will forever be grateful for their bravery and so sorry for the loss to their lovely families.”\nGresky was 43 when he died on Feb. 12, 1974, at a building on West 9th Street and Frankfort Avenue. On the rescue mission, the floor collapsed, and he fell into the basement. Firefighters breached an outside wall to get to Gresky, but he died.\nHe was survived by his wife, Catherine. His two sons, Scott and Edward, and two daughters, Jill and Susan, attended the ceremony.\n“That changed my mom’s life forever,” Scott Gresky said. “Because now she had to be both the mother and the father, and how tragic that was. But she had a purpose.”\nScott Gresky said his dad grew up in Cleveland, played football in high school and served in the U.S. Marine Corps. When his father returned home from Korea, wounded, he met his wife, Catherine.\nScott said his father loved being a firefighter. He appreciated the camaraderie and lived by their chalkboard of rules.\nMcNamee died on Dec. 7, 1974, while he attempted to save a fourth victim at the Hawley House Hotel at West 3rd and St. Clair Avenue. The firefighter removed his face mask to allow victims to breathe from his air pack. Six firefighters and five hotel residents were hospitalized from the incident. McNamee was 31.\nDuring the ceremony, Brent Collins, the executive director of Bluecoats Inc., presented plaques to the families of the honorees. The group is a nonprofit devoted to caring for the families of safety officers who have died or cannot care for themselves.\nMcNamee’s wife, Marilyn, and daughters Christine, Margaret, and Jacqueline thanked the Bluecoats for the help the group provided to their family after the death of her father.\n“For my mom, a young mother at the time, who found herself to now raise three young girls on her own, the Bluecoats helped us in our (time of) need,” Christine said.\n“Growing up, we always had food on the table and clothes on our backs. We never did without. My sisters and I were the first in her family to go to college. Because the Bluecoats paid for our college tuition and all expenses. Thank you.”\nScott Gresky also paid tribute to “the wonderful organization” that he and his brother thanked for its support.\n©2024 Advance Local Media LLC.\nVisit\ncleveland.com.\nDistributed by\nTribune Content Agency, LLC.",

    "text": "Una persona firmando un documento\nLa decisión tomada por el Ejecutivo durante el mes de octubre respecto a la jornada laboral de los trabajadores afectará de forma inmediata a millones de personas con la entrada en el año 2024.\nSegún la decisión tomada por PSOE y Sumar, la reducción laboral -una de las medidas estrella de la ministra de Trabajo, Yolanda Díaz- provocará que los trabajadores vean reducida su semana de trabajo a un máximo de 38’5 horas semanales.\nEsta decisión fue tomada por el gobierno de coalición para que se implementara de forma progresiva, pasando a 38’5 horas semanales como máximo en 2024 y 37’5 en 2025. Para posteriormente dialogar con la patronal y sindicatos y reducirla hasta las 32 horas más adelante.\nEsta decisión no cayó especialmente bien en los diferentes agentes sociales, que vieron en esta medida un peligro en lo que respecta a la productividad, incremento de costes y también en la inflación.\nAunque no afectará a todas las personas por igual, ya que dependerá en gran medida de lo que dictamine el convenio que les ataña. Lo que sí es seguro es que aquellos a los que se les aplique esta reducción no verán alterados ni reducidos sus salarios pese a trabajar 2’5 horas menos -la ley actual establece un máximo de 40 horas a la semana-.\nPero también habrá otro grupo de beneficiados. Esto serán los trabajadores a tiempo parcial, que verán cómo su nómina crece ya que si un trabajador cuenta con una reducción del 25% sobre la jornada máxima semana, el porcentaje se reducirá hasta el 20% respecto a su jornada semanal de 37’5 horas.\nCon la nueva ley, la empresa tendrá que pagarles el salario de acuerdo a ese porcentaje de parcialidad, algo que no terminan de ver con buenos ojos de las empresas que se vean obligadas a llevar a cabo esta reducción.",
