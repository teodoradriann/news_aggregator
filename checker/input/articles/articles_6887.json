    "text": "Meralco Bolts’ Shonn Miller in his PBA debut. –PBA IMAGES\nMeralco dismantled Magnolia on the road on Saturday night for a key Philippine Basketball Association (PBA) Commissioner’s Cup victory that, according to coach Luigi Trillo, gave the Bolts something more than a win reflected in the standings.\nAside from a win that pushed the Bolts to 7-2 and kept the club in the hunt for the much-coveted playoff protection, Trillo was thrilled to see a full-strength Bolts roster and their new import impress with a pair of games to go.\nADVERTISEMENT “Guys are back, Shonn Miller, and we still have games coming in,” the Meralco coach told the Inquirer on Sunday afternoon, fresh off a return flight from Iloilo City where the Bolts stifled Magnolia, 85-80, at a packed University of San Agustin Gym.\nFEATURED STORIES SPORTS Time for step two for Gilas Pilipinas SPORTS PVL: Creamline coach sees ‘easy’ transition for veteran stars SPORTS PBA: Ginebra stays in twice-to-beat hunt with win over NorthPort Miller, who replaced high-scoring guard Zach Lofton, delivered 33 points and 22 rebounds while preserving the fourth-quarter heroics of hometown hero Anjo Caram, whose presence completed the Bolts for the first time this season-opening conference.\n“We took Magnolia out of its strengths,” Trillo said. “But really, the revelation was the impact Shonn had,” Trillo said.\n“Out of town, in a hot gym, and playing against the best defensive team? The No. 1 rebounding team? It was nice to see Shonn come in and play in that win.”\nDoing a quick math during the chat, Trillo said the only way Meralco can tab a twice-to-beat bonus is for his charges to sweep dangerous Phoenix Super LPG and desperate Terrafirma.\nOne error would put Meralco in a perilous spot as San Miguel and defending champion Barangay Ginebra both hold superior quotients over them. A win by the two powerhouses would cause great complications for the Bolts.\nAmid the other grim scenarios, Trillo is taking each day in stride.\n“These [next] games will also get guys back into the groove of things with playoff basketball upon us now,” he said.

    "title": "Fans Call Travis Kelce’s Interview with Kid Reporter ‘Cutest Thing Ever’",
    "text": "Fans of Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce know that he has a lot of different charms, including his way with children. As \"Uncle Trav\" to brother Jason Kelce 's daughters, he has some practice taking care of young kids, and it showed in the sweet way he interacted with Taylen Biggs , a little girl and fashion enthusiast who interviewed Travis at a sports event. In early 2023, 10-year-old Biggs spoke with Travis and his team on the red carpet for the Super Bowl Championship Ring Ceremony, and a Chiefs fan account reposted the clip , leading many to comment on Travis' interactions. Biggs first asked Travis, \"How old were you when you found your style?\" Considering her question, he answered honestly, \"When I finally got some money in my pocket when I was like, 23, that's when I really figured it out. I was able to buy stuff.\" The young interviewer also told Travis about meeting his mother, Donna Kelce , at a different event, with Biggs saying, \"She was so sweet. You have the best mom ever.\" Travis thanked her, and they shared a high-five. Fans were in awe of both how Travis interacted with Biggs and how talented the 10-year-old was at interviewing, discussing the clip in the comments. \"OMG why is this the cutest thing ever? They should have her on New Heights!\" said one fan of Biggs, as another wrote, \"She’s a pistol. Big things in HER future!\" Complimenting Travis, someone noted, \"He is so good with her! Respectful and answers her questions sincerely.\" Other comments called the football star a \"big softie\" and \"adorable.\" \"How is he this good with children? I love this man,\" read a different response. For those interested in learning more about Biggs, she has a large presence on social media, especially when it comes to fashion, and she even talked about Taylor Swift , Travis' girlfriend, and Beyoncé in a recent update! With any luck, Biggs and Travis will come together to create a fashion collab in the future—or just another cute interview.
