    "text": "The African Guarantee Fund (AGF) (\nhttps://AfricanGuaranteeFund.com), a leader in promoting financing of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) across Africa and FSD Africa, a pioneering development agency committed to reshaping Africa's long-term financial landscape, have today signed a strategic Cooperation Agreement aimed at propelling the growth of Green SMEs by providing critical financial support, technical assistance, and capacity building.\nThe Cooperation Agreement outlines a detailed framework collaboration between the organizations in boosting sustainable development in Africa. The main aspects of this partnership involve assisting in the development of financial products for institutions, offering partial credit guarantees for bonds and funds raised on behalf of SMEs, and conducting capacity-building events.\nFurthermore, by providing financial support and fostering business growth, Green SMEs are expected to play a pivotal role in reducing CO2 emissions. This active contribution aligns with the overarching goal of preserving the environment and facilitates access to finance for business growth and empowering SMEs to generate and sustain employment opportunities, especially for youth and women.\nSpeaking during the agreement signing, Mark Napier, Chief Executive Officer of FSD Africa said: \"This partnership represents an important milestone in our efforts to foster sustainable economic development in Africa. By leveraging the strengths of FSD Africa and the African Guarantee Fund, we will actively create a robust ecosystem that empowers Green SMEs. This collaborative effort aims at facilitating access to affordable long-term funds, thereby accelerating the transition towards a greener and more resilient economy.\"\nJules Ngankam, AGF Group Chief Executive Officer said: “Fostering a green economic transformation in Africa is one of our key priorities. Through this partnership, AGF will provide financial institutions with bank fundraising guarantees to enable them access affordable funds aimed at facilitating loans to SMEs investing in low carbon and climate resilient businesses.\nAdditionally, AGF will extend partial credit guarantees to lenders in a bid to enhance credit accessibility for Green SMEs, empowering them to flourish and make meaningful contributions to environmental conservation.\nThe two organisations will also provide technical assistance on green financing initiatives, which is critical in building the capacity of key stakeholders such as Governments, Financial Institutions, and Green SMEs.\nDistributed by APO Group on behalf of African Guarantee Fund.\nFor more information, please contact:\nFSD Africa\nNelson Karanja\nDirector, Communications, and Engagement\nEmail:\nnelson@fsdafrica.org\nAfrican Guarantee Fund\nDiana Aluga\nGroup Communications&Public Relations Officer\nEmail:\nAbout FSD Africa:\nFSD Africa (\nhttps://apo-opa.co/3uxb9AN) is a specialist development agency established in 2012 by the UK Government working to make finance work for Africa’s future. We work on the ground in over 30 African countries to mobilise “green plus” finance that will power economic and social development while delivering environmental gains and building Africa’s resilience. We work on policy and regulatory reform, capacity strengthening and improving financial infrastructure, and addressing systemic challenges in Africa's financial markets to spark large-scale and long-term change.\nFSD Africa is part of a family of 10 financial sector deepening, or FSD programmes, operating across sub-Saharan Africa, known as the FSD Network. Together, the network provides over £50m a year in financial support to high-potential financial market development programmes, and employs over 150 financial sector experts, based in local offices across Africa.\nOur work has contributed to tackling financial exclusion challenges within Africa, supporting over 10.2 million people to access financial services. Such improved access has been particularly helpful during the Covid-19 crisis. For instance, between 2020 and 2021, we saw an 87% increase in the demand for and use of remittance services to cushion families from the adverse economic effects of Covid-19.\nAs of 2020, we supported approximately 35,700 Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) jobs, of which 20% were green jobs and 40% for women. About 42% of the jobs were created in Nigeria and the rest are spread across multiple countries. However, we are looking to intensify job creation in our priority countries.\nSince 2017, we have helped mobilise more than £2 billion in long-term capital to underfinanced sectors, such as renewable energy and housing. This has resulted in a more efficient allocation of private and public capital to the productive sector, basic services, and climate finance.\nIn more recent years, our strategy has evolved to respond to Africa's growing needs, with an increasing focus on finding innovative ways to mobilise capital for sustainable economic development. Following several successful initiatives, such as developing regulations and supporting green bond issuance programmes in Kenya and Nigeria, we have doubled our investment into initiatives that support a just transition to a green future for Africa.\nSince 2017 our green portfolio and pipeline have continued to grow, and we have invested close to £50 million into green investments. We continue to invest in programmes that deliver environmental and social outcomes.\nFor more information, visit:\nhttps://apo-opa.co/3uxb9AN\nAbout African Guarantee Fund:\nAfrican Guarantee Fund (AGF) (\nhttps://AfricanGuaranteeFund.com) is a specialized guarantee provider whose mission is to facilitate economic development and poverty reduction in Africa. To achieve this, AGF increases access to finance for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) across key economic sectors through an array of guarantee products and capacity development assistance. Since inception, AGF has unlocked more than USD 3.5 billion in SME financing, through partnerships with 200 partner financial institutions across 40 African countries.\nAGF is backed by the following shareholders and sponsors: The Government of Denmark through the Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA), the Government of Spain through the Spanish Agency for International Cooperation (AECID), the African Development Bank (AfDB), French Development Agency (AFD), Nordic Development Fund (NDF), Investment Fund for Developing Countries (IFU), German Development Bank (KfW), French Agency for Private Sector (PROPARCO), West African Development Bank (BOAD), Global Affairs Canada (GAC), USAID's West Africa Trade&Investment Hub (WATIH), and TechnoServe.\nAfrican Guarantee Fund is rated AA- by Fitch Ratings.\nFor more information, please visit:\nhttps://AfricanGuaranteeFund.com\nLatest Stories\n-\nAfrican Guarantee Fund and FSD Africa partner to boost Green Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Financing\n8 mins\n-\nE.P.

    "title": "The Unspoken Rule Of Conversation That Explains Why AI Chatbots Feel So Human",
    "text": "Earlier this year, a Hong Kong finance worker was tricked into paying US$25 million to scammers who had used deepfake technology to pretend to be the company's chief financial officer in a video conference call. Thinking the images on screen were his colleagues, the financier authorised the multi-million dollar transfer to fraudsters posing as friends. It's a dramatic example, but the bamboozled office worker was far from alone in being fooled by generative AI. This technology, which relies heavily on large language models trained on vast amounts of data to learn and predict the patterns of language, has become increasingly widespread since the launch of ChatGPT in 2022. How can we explain why some people who interact with generative AI chatbots are so readily convinced they are having a conversation with a kind of person? The answer may lie in the rules of conversation itself – and how they are deeply ingrained in the way we interact with the world. Generative AI systems based on language models produce text that a linguist would call“ungrounded”: it lacks the mutual understanding that is an essential component of conversations between people. However, when humans engage in an interaction we tend to assume that our partner has a mind. We are wired to anthropomorphise the various non-humans we interact with. Before the recent leaps in generative AI, this was mainly animals. Now it is machines. Before generative AI, our interactions with computers generally involved minimal linguistic back-and-forth. With generative AI, however, computer systems acknowledge us in a way that seems real. This“seeming real” is a huge part of the technology's success. So how does it work? In a recent paper , American scientists Kyle Mahowald, Anna Ivanova and colleagues argue that we are conflating language and thought. Because generative AI systems can use language somewhat fluently, we believe they can think. (For the record, they cannot.) The authors distinguish between formal linguistic competence (knowledge of rules and statistical patterns in language) and functional linguistic competence (how to use language in real-world situations). It's not enough to produce rule-governed utterances. They must also be used appropriately in context. In this example (crafted with the help of ChatGPT-4o when prompted to produce an example of an accurate but inappropriate conversational response), Alex offers a response that, while factually correct, fails to address their friend's need for support. Mahowald and colleagues say our belief in the intelligence of generative AI systems comes from their capacity for language. However, a crucial piece of the puzzle is what happens to humans when we interact with the technology. The key to understanding the allure of generative AI chatbots for humans lies in the genre the bots perform: conversation. Conversation is governed by rules and routines. Conversational routines vary across cultures, and different expectations are in place. In Western cultures, at least, linguists often regard conversation as proceeding according to four principles or“maxims” set out in 1975 by British philosopher of language Paul Grice. The maxim of quality : be truthful; do not give information that is false or not supported by evidence. The maxim of quantity : be as informative as is required; don't give too much or too little information. The maxim of relevance : only give information that is relevant to the topic under discussion. The maxim of manner : be clear, brief, and orderly; avoid obscurity and ambiguity. Generative AI chatbots usually do well in terms of quantity (sometimes erring on the side of giving too much information), and they tend to be relevant and clear (a reason people use them to improve their writing). However, they do often fail on the maxim of quality. They tend to hallucinate, giving answers which may appear authoritative but are in fact false. The crux of generative AI's success, however, lies in Grice's claim that anyone engaged in meaningful communication will abide by these maxims and will assume that others are also following them. For example, the reason lying works is that people interacting with a liar will assume the other person is telling the truth. People interacting with someone who offers an irrelevant comment will attempt to find relevance at all costs. Grice's cooperative principle holds that conversation is underpinned by our overarching will to understand one another. The success of generative AI, then, depends in part on the human need to cooperate in conversation, and to be instinctively drawn to interaction. This way of interacting through conversation, learned in childhood, becomes habitual. Grice argued that“it would take a good deal of effort to make a radical departure from the habit”. Next time you engage with generative AI, then, do so with caution. Remember it's only a language model. Don't let your habitual need for conversational cooperation accept a machine as a fellow human.

    "text": "Retired police sergeant on vacation with family rescues couple from sinking car CINCINNATI ( [WXIX](https://www.fox19.com/2024/06/21/retired-cpd-sergeant-family-rescue-unknown-tri-state-couple-during-florida-vacation/)/Gray News) - A retired Cincinnati police sergeant and his family saved an Ohio couple who just happened to be vacationing in the same area in Florida. The Ramsey family is from Ohio, while the Bell family lives in northern Kentucky. Up until June 11, the two families had no idea they lived so close to one another. Some might call it a coincidence. Others will say it’s luck, but these two families call it a miracle. Dean and Shana Ramsey recall the moment they said they almost drowned while vacationing in Siesta Key, Florida. Several streets flooded that day after the area received more than 11 inches of rain, an abnormal amount, according to Sarasota County officials. “You couldn’t see anything but rain and water,” Dean Ramsey recalled. With several cars stalled on the road, the couple said they tried to pull off on what they thought was land. “The water sucked us right into that lagoon and that was it,” Dean Ramsey explained. Watching in horror from their condo was retired Cincinnati Police Department sergeant Mike Bell, his wife Ginger Bell and their three young kids. The Bell family responded. “We were able to stop, slow things down, and assess and make some decisions on how we were going to move forward,” Mike Bell said. That plan started with Mackenzie Bell giving valuable information to 911. “I remembered they needed to know the address, so that’s the first thing I told her and then I told her a car is in the pond and there was two people in there,” Mike’s and Ginger Bell’s daughter, Mackenzie Bell, said. Meanwhile, the retired sergeant and his wife, who is an emergency medical doctor, took action. “I went over to the edge of the water and realized it wasn’t sinking immediately, so I have a few minutes,” Mike Bell recounted from that moment. “At that time, Ginger exited the front door next to the pond. I look at her and said, ‘We need flotation devices.’” That’s where little Hank Bell came in. “I didn’t want them to die, so I ran as fast as I could,” Hank Bell explained. “I went up the elevator, which is extremely slow, and I knew there were stairs that were faster. So, I ran down the stairs.” Flotation devices in hand, the Bell kids handed them to their parents who were already in the water. “He went into the lady’s side and I went into the man’s side,” Ginger Bell said. “She was able to climb out on her own, but I put the boogie board right in front of her. She got her body on the boogie board and that’s when I started paddling and we kicked over to the side.” Ginger Bell ran into some issues helping Dean Ramsey. “When he was trying to get out, his foot got stuck, so he was on his back with one foot out and one foot stuck in the steering wheel,” Ginger Bell remembered. “I looked at her and I said, ‘I’m stuck, I can’t,’” Dean Ramsey remembered. “At that time, I was like, ‘I’m going down with the car,’ but she’s like, ‘Get out of this car! You got to get out! Kick your leg!’ I started thrashing my leg and my foot popped out.” The rescue took about five minutes. Back on dry land, the Ramsey family saw their rescuers as “guardian angels.” The families say they have plans to reunite in the near future. The Bell family wants to remind residents to always be mindful of their surroundings and assess a situation before getting involved. They said if your car is going in a body of water, roll down the windows or punch them out by hitting the corners. Those tactics could save a life. Copyright 2024 WXIX via Gray Media Group, Inc.

    "text": "Depois de passar pelo Rio Grande do Sul e causar uma [tempestade que deixou estragos em diversas cidades](https://www.brasildefato.com.br/2024/03/21/apos-onda-de-calor-temporal-causa-estragos-no-rio-grande-do-sul), a frente fria que chegou ao Brasil nos últimos dias segue pela região Sul e se aproxima das regiões Centro-Oeste e Sudeste. O Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia (Inmet) alerta para o risco de tempestades em diferentes partes dessas regiões já a partir da noite desta quinta-feira (21). Segundo o Inmet, há risco de tempestades em boa parte do Paraná e em praticamente todo o território dos estados de São Paulo e Mato Grosso do Sul já nesta quinta. Para os estados do Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, Goiás, e Mato Grosso a previsão é de \"chuvas intensas\". Para sexta-feira (22), a previsão é de mais chuva forte nos mesmos estados. Em todo o [Rio de Janeiro](https://www.brasildefato.com.br/2024/03/19/estado-do-rio-pode-ter-chuva-extrema-a-partir-de-sexta-feira-22-diz-climatempo), na região do Vale do Paraíba (em São Paulo) e na Zona da Mata mineira o Inmet emitiu um alerta de \"grande perigo\" de chuvas que podem superar os 100 mm, com rajadas de vento superiores a 100 km/h. O alerta é reforçado para o sábado (23), quando algumas localidades do Vale do Paraíba e do litoral norte de São Paulo; das regiões sul e Zona da Mata mineira; do sul do Espírito Santo e de todo o estado do Rio podem ter chuvas ainda mais fortes, podendo superar os 150 mm. Com isso, não está descartada a hipótese de enxurradas, deslizamentos e alagamentos. O Inmet recomenda que, em caso de rajadas de vento, as pessoas não se abriguem debaixo de árvores, já que há risco de queda e de descargas elétricas. Os veículos devem ser estacionados longe de torres de transmissão. Quem puder, deve desligar os aparelhos elétricos ou até mesmo o quadro geral de energia. Em todos os casos, as pessoas devem estar atentas às orientações da Defesa Civil (que atende pelo número 199, e deve ser acionada em caso de deslizamentos ou enchentes). O Corpo de Bombeiros também está à disposição, pelo telefone 193. Edição: Matheus Alves de Almeida [](https://apoie.brasildefato.com.br/?utm_source=site&utm_medium=bannersite&utm_campaign=apoiase)",
