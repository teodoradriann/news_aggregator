    "text": "India may be forced to forfeit a Davis Cup playoff hosted by rival Pakistan, with the local tennis association saying on Thursday, Dec. 28, the team was waiting on New Delhi's approval to travel. India may miss Davis Cup match hosted by rival Pakistan At a glance NEW DELHI (AFP) -- India may be forced to forfeit a Davis Cup playoff hosted by rival Pakistan, with the local tennis association saying on Thursday, Dec. 28, the team was waiting on New Delhi's approval to travel. The nuclear-armed neighbors have fought several wars since winning independence from British rule in 1947, and sporting contests between the two have long been the victim of their enduring animosity. The All India Tennis Association (AITA) asked the sports ministry for approval to travel to Pakistan after a request to shift the fixture to a third country was rejected by the International Tennis Federation tribunal. \"The proposal is still pending with the ministry and we are awaiting a decision,\" AITA secretary-general Anil Dhupar told AFP. Pakistan Tennis Federation president Salim Saifullah Khan said 18 members of the Indian squad had requested visas for the World Group 1 clash scheduled for February 3-4. \"We have all the arrangements put in place. They will be given the best security and accommodation,\" he told AFP. \"Let politics be kept away from sports and better sense prevail.\" New Delhi last hosted the Pakistani tennis team in 2006 and the Indian Davis Cup team last traveled to Islamabad in 1964, according to news outlet India Today. Local media reports said a 2019 match was moved to Kazakhstan, with the AITA citing political tensions as the reason for the request. Sports matches between India and Pakistan are rare owing to decades of hostility between the two nations. They share one of the world's great sporting rivalries in cricket, by far the most popular sport in both countries. But their teams have not played a bilateral series in more than a decade, and typically only face each other in larger tournaments. India refused to travel to Pakistan for the 50-over Asia Cup in September, a move that forced its neighbor to partially relinquish hosting duties to Sri Lanka. Pakistan traveled to India the following month for the Cricket World Cup after its request to stage some matches in a third country was rejected.",

    "text": "Running community rallies behind cross country coach battling cancer ERLANGER, Ky. (WXIX) - A 5k is being held this weekend to honor and show support for a Northern Kentucky cross country coach. Late last year, St. Henry High School boys cross country coach Jeremy Hurm was diagnosed with a brain tumor. His friend and fellow runner Rob Tagher says he remembers when Hurm first showed interest in coaching. “He said, ‘Coach Rob, would you ever need any help with this team? I’d love to help you out if I can,’ and I said, ‘Well, Jeremy, that sounds great because my kids are out of St. Paul now and I would love someone to help out,’” recalls Tagher. “Little did I know he was eventually going to take over that team altogether.” After leading his team to a third-place finish at the state championship this year and back-to-back first-place finishes before that, he was diagnosed with a brain tumor at the end of November. And just days after that, a [5k](https://runsignup.com/Race/KY/Burlington/HurmDawgFrosty5K) was planned to support Hurm and his family. It’s Called Hurm Dawg’s Frosty 5k, it is happening Saturday morning at Idlewild Park in Burlington. But if you haven’t signed up, it’s too late. That’s because in a matter of days, more than 1000 people registered for the walk/run exceeding expectations for the race organizers. “I think runners love to gather and they love to suffer together and they love to give,” says Tagher. Tagher says Hurm is a generous person, always thinking of everyone else before himself and that makes it hard to deal with this news. “Jeremy’s really special and I think that he’s gotten so much outreach from the community because of who he is and what he’s done,” Tagher continues, “And anybody who’s made contact with him knows how special he is.” Tagher says Hurm has a long road ahead of him as he battles this tough diagnosis, but he knows that Hurm is tougher. The man has run 100-mile races for fun, after all. Hurm’s wife and daughter are going through this battle with him and Tagher says they need support too. “I think being positive and giving the family hope is part of that support,” says Tagher.

    "text": "Mirwaiz barred from Friday prayers at Jamia Mosque In a statement, Mirwaiz said that after his release on September 22 following four years of house detention since August 2019, he was only permitted to go to the Jamia Masjid for three Fridays The chief priest of Jamia Masjid and Hurriyat leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq was on Friday not allowed to offer congregational prayers at the grand mosque in the old city. The prayers were held at the grand mosque but the chief priest was not allowed to move out of his house in Nigeen in the outskirts of Srinagar. He denounced his “house detention” by authorities. In a statement, Mirwaiz said that after his release on September 22 following four years of house detention since August 2019, he was only permitted to go to the Jamia Masjid for three Fridays. [Click here](https://www.hindustantimes.com/2024-planner-guide-and-2023-top-events-recap) “Since then, every Friday, he has been put under house arrest without any reason provided by the authorities,” the statement added. Since October 13, Friday prayers were not allowed at the grand mosque for 10 weeks as security forces had apprehensions that there could be protests in support of Palestine. “It was only last week that people were allowed to offer Friday prayers there. The duration of this permission remains uncertain while the ban on me continues,” Mirwaiz said. “The authorities whimsically open or close the central Jamia Masjid to Muslims for prayers without accountability, and no one can enquire about the reasons,” he alleged. On December 22, Anjuman Auqaf of Jama Masjid had said that authorities allowed Friday prayers at the historic mosque after a gap of ten weeks. However, Mirwaiz alleged that he was being confined to his home on Fridays. “It mocks the authorities’ own statements claiming things are great in Jammu & Kashmir, and I am a free man who can go anywhere,” he added. Mirwaiz claimed that control of any kind, including on religious rights, cannot bring or maintain peace. “Those in-charge of decision-making should revisit this policy, considering historical precedents and adopting a long-term perspective,” he said. Mirwaiz has been leading the prayers and delivering Friday sermons at Jamia Masjid as part of the Mirwaiz’s family tradition.",

Que la— Giovanna Salem (@GiovannaFSalem) [@SFP_mx]investigué también a sus cómplices, y me violentaron de manera laboral y de género. Luis Guillermo Chapa, Director Gral de Evaluación y Planeación; Diana Fabiola Piedra, Coordinadora Gral de Educación y Divulgación, [@SheffieldGto]Nuevo Senador por Guanajuato; Ilse… [https://t.co/ruJUF94jhI] [August 15, 2024] Según reportes, Salem presentó una denuncia contra Aguilar ante la SFP y la Comisión Nacional de los Derechos Humanos. La exsecretaria del funcionario también envió una carta a la presidenta electa Claudia Sheinbaum, el pasado 7 de julio, en la que señaló las violencias que sufrió y pidió ayuda a la futura mandataria. “Me quitaron mi sustento que era mi trabajo, además de lo difícil que ha sido para mí haber sido víctima de violencia sexual, me han amenazado, mandado a golpear y atacado”, expuso en la misiva. Presidenta— Giovanna Salem (@GiovannaFSalem) [@Claudiashein] Ccp: [@SheffieldGto] [@ProcuradorPFC] Por favor, le pido como mujer y víctima su apoyo. [pic.twitter.com/XmlcayDavH] [June 7, 2024] En el escrito dirigido a Sheinbaum, la otrora trabajadora de Profeco también denunció que, durante la administración de Ricardo Sheffield como exprocurador federal del consumidor, éste cometió una “extorsión multimillonaria y esos recursos se fueron directamente a sus propiedades, directamente a los negocios que tiene con sus amigos que conforman la plantilla de Profeco a nivel nacional, amigos que también tienen en otros puestos estratégicos”. Además, en un video en su cuenta de X, Salem cuestionó la narrativa de la “austeridad” del gobierno morenista, en relación con una fiesta que supuestamente Sheffield le hizo a David Aguilar, con un presunto costo de tres millones de pesos por el cumpleaños del ahora procurador, en junio pasado. “Solamente un cómplice celebra a un violador, haciéndole una fiesta con gran lujo. ¿Dónde está la austeridad que ellos deberían tener?”, preguntó Salem. Presidenta [@Claudiashein]hago nuevamente un llamado a usted. El fin de semana le festejaron a [@ProcuradorPFC]mi abusador y violador sexual con una fiesta de más de 3 millones de pesos, su cómplice y red de la mafia [@SheffieldGto]. Se piensan otros 6 años más deshaciendo PROFECO.

Judge Deidre Orchard told the Dunedin District Court this week she would have sentenced 46-year-old Brett Douglas Lawson to home detention but it would stop him working at his business, and it might \"go under\". The defendant was instead given six months’ community detention (a curfew). The sentencing, in front of a packed public gallery, heard Lawson’s victim had been unable to drive for three months, had lost some vision in her right eye and had been diagnosed with PTSD and anxiety disorder. \"The assault has had a huge impact on me, my family, my colleagues and my friends. It’s completely changed my life,\" the woman said in a statement. \"I’m no longer able to go out in public alone.\" The couple, who had since separated, hosted a group of friends at their home to watch a rugby match in August last year. As the night progressed, Lawson became paranoid about his then partner’s cellphone use. \"He belittled the victim in front of their associates before throwing food at her,\" a police summary said. The woman went to bed and Lawson reacted angrily when he found another man had gone to check on her. The victim came out of the bedroom to find the defendant had pinned the man against the wall but when she yelled at him to stop, he pivoted to face her. When Lawson grabbed her by the neck, snapping her head back, she kicked out. Yelling that the woman had struck him in the genitals, the defendant threw her on to the bed and pinned her down. As Lawson released his weight, the victim tried to escape, but he picked her up and threw her against a wall. She also hit a table along the way. A friend helped her leave the address and a temporary protection order was issued by the court a couple of weeks later. \"That did not stop you,\" Judge Diedre Orchard said. Lawson breached the order by visiting the woman in December while on bail, and again the following month, when he repeatedly called her in the early hours. The victim said she still feared for her safety and wanted the truth about her ex-partner to come out. \"I want Brett to stop acting like a victim in a situation he created. I want him to start being honest with the people around him,\" she said. The court heard Lawson had paid her $6000 to recognise the emotional harm he had caused.",
