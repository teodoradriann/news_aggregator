    "text": "Josh Hazlewood stars as Australia claim 10-wicket win inside 3 days over West Indies in 1st Test Australia dismissed the West Indies for 120 in the 13th over of the day on Friday, leaving the home side needing just 26 runs to win. Josh Hazlewood claimed his 11th five-wicket total in Test matches as Australia completed a 10-wicket win over West Indies on Friday before lunch on the third day of the first Test. Australia dismissed the West Indies for 120 in the 13th over of the day on Friday, leaving the home side needing just 26 runs to win. [Click here](https://www.hindustantimes.com/2024-planner-guide-and-2023-top-events-recap) Steve Smith (11) and Usman Khawaja (9) easily completed that total for Australia, although Khawaja retired hurt after being hit by a bouncer with Australia needing one run to win. Marnus Labuschagne hit the winning run two balls later. Hazlewood already had 4-18 at the start of the day as he helped Australia reduce the West Indies to 73-6 in its second innings before stumps on the second day. Australia led by 95 runs on the first innings after making 283 in reply to the West Indies 188. “It’s nice to have the weekend off now. It’s nice as a group to play on that wicket. It felt like there was enough there the whole game,\" Hazlewood said. “I felt I bowled just as well in the first half of the summer with no result. The wickets have been really good and playing with this team, it feels relentless and the pressure just builds all the time.” Australia captain Pat Cummins said “it was a wicket where you always felt like there might be a ball that nips and you were in the game even when someone was scoring a few runs.\" “The big fella (Hazlewood) really turned it on for us this week. We had a decent lead but not a huge lead and he took the game away from them in one spell really.” The big question at the start of the day was whether the West Indies would be able to make Australia bat again. It began to look unlikely when Mitchell Starc dismissed Joshua da Silva (18) and Alzarri Joseph (16) and Hazlewood bowled Gudakesh Motie (3) to leave the West Indies 94-9, still needing one run to avoid an innings defeat. Shamar Joseph and Kemar Roche again produced a small rearguard action, adding 26 for the last wicket after putting on 55 for the last wicket in the first innings. Joseph already was a star of the match for his 36 in the first innings and his 5-94 on debut. He hit three boundaries on Friday to add a little to the West Indies lead before he was the last man out. West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite said Shamar Joseph was a joy to be around. “He’s full of energy and he makes me laugh a lot,” Brathwaite said. “He has a lot of talent, at lot of skill and he can score some runs as well.” “I thought our bowlers did extremely well to bowl out Australia for less than 300. We obviously didn’t bat well both innings. Our top order didn’t get going.\" The second and final Test between the teams begins Jan. 25 in Brisbane, a day-night match at the Gabba [Login Now!](https://accounts.hindustantimes.com/?type=plain&ref=ht&funnel_entry=end_of_article&cta=end_of_article&is_premium=false/) Catch all the Latest [Cricket News](https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket), [Live Cricket Score](https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/live-score)and [India vs Afghanistan](https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/team-ind-vs-afg-live-score-india-afghanistan-upcoming-matches-and-results-4-1188)match updates along with [Cricket Schedule](https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/schedule)and [India vs Afghanistan Live Score](https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/india-vs-afghanistan-live-score-3rd-t20i-match-today-17-january-ind-vs-afg-match-in-m-chinnaswamy-stadium-bengaluru-101705480386090.html)other related updates on Hindustan Times Website and APPs",

    "text": "Fahad Shabbir (@FahadShabbir) Published June 02, 2024 | 05:40 PM\nISLAMABAD, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 2nd Jun, 2024) Pakistan Ulema Council (PUC) Chairman Hafiz Muhammad Tahir Mehmood Ashrafi has expressed his satisfaction with the ongoing Hajj operations and called upon government and private Hajj organizers to ensure the comfort and ease of pilgrims.\nTalking to media , he emphasized the importance of maintaining high standards of service, particularly in ensuring the well-being of the intending pilgrims.\nAshrafi lauded the current Hajj operations, noting significant improvements in logistical arrangements, transportation, and accommodation for the pilgrims. He highlighted that the collaborative efforts between the Saudi and Pakistani authorities had resulted in a more organized and efficient Hajj experience this year.\n“I am pleased with the way the Hajj operations have been conducted so far. The cooperation between the Pak-Saudi authorities has been exemplary, ensuring that our pilgrims can perform their religious duties with dignity and peace of mind,” Ashrafi stated.\nThe PUC chairman also issued an advisory for pilgrims urging to book their Hajj packages through authorized organizers to avoid falling victim to fraudulent activities. He said the Saudi and Pakistani authorities, alongside the Hajj Organizers Association Pakistan (HAOP), had emphasized the necessity of legitimate booking to ensure a safe and genuine pilgrimage experience.\nAshrafi said to assist pilgrims in making legitimate arrangements, the Saudi Ministry of Hajj and Umrah, the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony, and HOAP had disseminated comprehensive guidelines from time to time.\nHe said these guidelines, frequently shared through a section of media , were designed to protect innocent pilgrims from the clutches of fraudsters.\nAshrafi advised the prospective pilgrims to verify the credentials of Hajj organizers, ensure that the organizers were officially recognized by the relevant Saudi and Pakistani authorities and follow the booking procedures as outlined in the official guidelines. By adhering to these recommendations, he said pilgrims could secure their journey and avoid any potential scams that could jeopardize their pilgrimage.\nAshrafi said the Dar-ul-Ifta of Saudi Arabia had issued a significant religious decree stating that performing Hajj without official permission was forbidden. “This Fatwa aims to uphold the sanctity and order of the pilgrimage by ensuring that all pilgrims follow the proper channels and guidelines established by the Saudi authorities,” he added.\nAshrafi said pilgrims traveling from Islamabad and Karachi had expressed immense satisfaction with the “Road to Makkah” project. He said this initiative had significantly streamlined the travel process, making the spiritual journey to the holy land more efficient and comfortable.\nConcluding his remarks, Ashrafi expressed deep appreciation for the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Salman bin Abdulaziz, and Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammad bin Salman for their unwavering commitment to providing comprehensive facilities and support to the ‘Guests of Allah Almighty’ through every possible means.\n/778",
