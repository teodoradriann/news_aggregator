    "text": "Innovative Strategies and Emerging Technologies Promise a Brighter, More Reliable Future for Renewable Energy At New York Energy Week 2024 , Amir Valibeygi , Director of Analytics at BrightNight , tackles a critical question for the future of energy: “Has the Era of High Capacity Factor Renewables Arrived?” As energy demands escalate, industry leaders gather to explore the possibilities of advancing renewable energy technologies.\nBrightNight’s Strategic Innovation: PowerAlpha\nValibeygi kicks off his presentation by highlighting BrightNight’s formidable 37-gigawatt portfolio, which includes utility-scale solar, wind, and energy storage projects. Central to BrightNight’s success is PowerAlpha, a cutting-edge software tool designed to optimize project design, operation, and finance. Unlike typical tools, PowerAlpha enables BrightNight to deliver highly customized renewable solutions tailored to specific market demands and project requirements, achieving the lowest possible levelized cost of energy (LCOE).\nRising to Modern Energy Challenges\nThe discussion shifts to the significant pressures on global energy infrastructure, exacerbated by rapid industrial electrification and the expansion of data-driven technologies. Valibeygi points out that some regions anticipate annual energy demand growth rates as high as 4%, a stark contrast to the relatively stable growth of previous decades. He advocates for a strategic shift toward integrating energy storage with renewable sources, a move that could substantially raise capacity factors and improve the reliability of green energy.\nMaximizing Efficiency with Advanced Analytics\nValibeygi introduces the concept of the “efficient frontier,” a sophisticated approach to renewable energy project design. This methodology identifies the optimal trade-offs between capacity factor and cost, informed by extensive simulations. Valibeygi presents real-world case studies to demonstrate how BrightNight applies this framework to craft solutions for various energy needs, including the substantial power requirements of data centers and the intricate balance needed for green hydrogen production.\nEmerging Technologies on the Horizon\nLooking ahead, Valibeygi expresses optimism about the potential of emerging long-duration energy storage technologies. These advancements, he suggests, could dramatically lower costs and enhance the reliability of high capacity factor renewables. Such technologies are especially valuable for managing peak demand challenges. Valibeygi also highlights BrightNight’s international projects, such as those in India, which showcase the company’s ability to meet stringent global standards for reliable and dispatchable renewable energy.\nStrategic Conclusions and Industry Impact\nIn his closing remarks, Valibeygi reaffirms the transformative potential of high capacity factor renewables to meet the growing global energy demands. He underscores the importance of continuous innovation in storage and analytics technologies to enhance the reliability and dispatchability of renewable sources. This approach, he argues, is crucial for aligning renewable energy with both economic and environmental goals.\nAs Valibeygi wraps up his presentation, the audience is left with a clear and compelling vision of the future. BrightNight’s strategic use of PowerAlpha and its commitment to innovative project design set a high bar for the industry. These insights not only highlight the current capabilities of renewable technologies but also pave the way for future advancements that promise to meet the complex demands of the modern energy landscape.\n>>> WATCH THE VIDEO OF THE PRESENTATION SESSION HERE",

    "text": "A surprise to nobody here ... but having some harder numbers is worthwhile to encourage pattern recognition.\nhttps://newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/tim-graham/2023/12/27/study-syracuse-just-34-percent-american-journalists-are-republicans\nSTUDY from Syracuse: Just 3.4 Percent of American Journalists Are Republicans\nTim Graham\nDecember 27th, 2023 4:09 PM\nShocker! Isaac Schorr at Mediaite reported a new study from Syracuse University’s Newhouse School of Public Communications found that just 3.4 percent of American journalists are Republicans. In the last ten years, the proportion of Democrats has increased to 36.4% and proportion of Independents has ticked upwards to 51.7%, while the already low Republican share has been cut in half.\nThe last study in 2013 pegged the proportion of Republican journalists in America at 7.1%, Democrats at 28.1%, and Independents at 50.2%.\nIt's fair to guess that journalists who choose \"independent\" are attempting to look nonpartisan, but we can safely guess a large share of them are Biden-Harris voters.\nThe study is based “on an online survey with 1,600 U.S. journalists conducted in early 2022” and is the latest in a series of studies stretching back to 1971 that take the temperature of the fourth estate’s partisan lean, job satisfaction, and professional attitudes.\n When the first iteration of the study came out over 50 years ago, 35.5% of respondents said they were Democrats, 25.7% said they were Republicans, and 32.5% said they were Independents. The percentage that call themselves Democrats or independents have bounced around over the years, with the proportion of Democrats reaching a high of 44.1% in 1992.\nSurveys of journalists across the country in local newsrooms used to provide a more bipartisan picture, but the national media has been severely liberal since Robert and Linda Richter and Stanley Morgan published The Media Elite studies in 1981. They found over 90 percent of national journalists picked Lyndon Johnson over Barry Goldwater in 1964 and over 80 percent picked Hubert Humphrey over Richard Nixon in 1968\nIn 2022, just 3.4% of journalists were Republicans.\nThat figure was 18% in 2002 and 25.7% in 1971.\nAs with most professions, conservatives have been increasingly excluded or purged from the ranks of journalists.\nIf you wonder why the media is the way it is today, this is why. pic.twitter.com/AuZ8iCMiwQ\nKevin Bass PhD MS (@kevinnbass) December 27, 2023\nAccording to a Gallup poll from November, today's newsrooms are wildly out of step with the general public. Independents do make up the largest proportion of the population at 40%, but the same proportion of Americans (29%) are Republicans as Democrats.\nIn another Gallup poll in October, the 32% of Americans who say they trust the mass media “a great deal” or “a fair amount” to report the news in a full, fair and accurate way ties Gallup’s lowest historical reading, previously recorded in 2016. While 58% of Democrats and 29% of Independents have a “great deal” or “fair amount” of confidence in the media, just 11% of Republicans feel the same way. Given all the tilted reporting we expose at NewsBusters, that's also not a shocker. View Quote\nStudy key findings:\nhttps://www.theamericanjournalist.org/_files/ugd/46a507_4fe1c4d6ec6d4c229895282965258a7a.pdf\nPage for the study:\nhttps://www.theamericanjournalist.org/the-2022-survey\nFrom the linked pdf:\nCompared with 2013, the percentage of full-time U.S. journalists who claim to be Democrats has increased 8 percentage points in 2022 to about 36 percent, a figure higher than the overall population percentage of 27 percent, according to a 2022 ABC News/Washington Post national poll. This is the third highest percentage of journalists saying they are Democrats since 1971. Journalists who said they were Republicans continued to drop from 18 percent in 2002 and 7.1 percent in 2013 to 3.4 percent in 2022. This figure is notably lower than the percentage of U.S. adults who identified with the Republican party (26 percent according to the poll mentioned earlier) in 2022. About half of all journalists (51.7 percent) said they were Independents, which is about 12 percentage points above the figure for all U.S. adults (40 percent). Overall, U.S. journalists today are much more likely to identify themselves as Independents rather than Democrats or Republicans—a pattern similar to 2013.\nAnd I expect most of those independents are as they have usually been ... functional democrats.",

    "title": "Alberta bill gives cabinet power to remove municipal councillors, change or repeal bylaws",
    "text": "A new bill would give the Alberta government more power over municipalities including granting cabinet the power to remove councillors from office, and forcing councils to repeal bylaws it doesn't like. Bill 20, the Municipal Affairs Statutes Amendment, was tabled in the legislature Thursday afternoon. The bill would allow the creation of municipal political parties, but it comes in the form of a pilot project only affecting Edmonton in Calgary. Bill 20 goes much further by proposing many other changes to the Local Authorities Election Act and the Municipal Government Act to reinforce the province's authority over municipalities. If passed, the bill would allow cabinet to call a public referendum on the fate of a municipal councillor, or go as far as to unilaterally remove them from office if it is deemed in the public interest. There are no legislative guardrails or limits for when that can happen but the decision can be appealed to the Court of King's Bench. Municipal Affairs Minister Ric McIver insisted that provision would be rarely used. \"First of all, I hope it never has to happen. But second of all, if it does, then it will be incumbent upon cabinet to have a really good explanation for the public,\" he told reporters at a news conference prior to the bill's introduction. \"I think the public will judge cabinet kindly or harshly depending upon the facts and the circumstances around when this decision is made.\" Cabinet has had the power to force municipal councils to amend or repeal land-use bylaws and statutory plans for 30 years. Bill 20 extends that power to all bylaws passed by councils. McIver said the current amendment power has never been used so the public shouldn't worry about the government having an \"itchy trigger finger.\" Cabinet would also gain the ability to tell municipalities what to do in protecting public health and safety, although the government already exercised that authority in 2022 when it prohibited cities and towns from passing or extending their own masking bylaws. Other measures proposed in Bill 20 include: Allowing unions and corporations to make donations of up to $5,000 to municipal candidates, a measure that was outlawed for provincial candidates in 2015. Banning the use of electronic voting machines like tabulators in municipal elections. Limiting the practice of vouching only to confirming someone's address, not their identity and age as currently allowed. Giving the municipal affairs minister the power to validate recall petitions, not a municipality's CAO who reports directly to council. This was something requested by smaller municipalities. Allowing the province to make regulations to postpone elections in the case of an emergency or natural disaster such as a wildfire. Making orientation training mandatory for councillors. Giving municipalities the power to require criminal record checks for candidates. However, this provision is not mandatory. Exempt non-profit subsidized affordable housing from paying property taxes. Prohibiting municipalities from holding more public hearings than legally required. This measure prevents municipal councils from purposefully delaying initiatives. Municipalities will be limited in how they can ask developers for non-statutory studies. Municipal political parties would not be allowed to have the same name or formal affiliations with provincial or federal parties. If the bill is passed, the province plans to develop regulations by consulting with municipalities in the upcoming months. The next province-wide municipal elections are scheduled to take place in October 2025.",
