    "title": "38 dogs were close to drowning on a Mississippi lake. But some fishermen had quite a catch",
    "text": "ATLANTA – By the time fishermen spotted the first head bobbing above the water, the 38 dogs were exhausted and struggling to stay alive. The hound dogs had plunged into a large Mississippi lake while chasing a deer, a diversion during a fox hunt. Bob Gist, who was fishing on the lake, knew they had no chance. Recommended Videos “A deer can swim the Mississippi River, and those dogs are not going to catch a deer in the water,” he recalled Friday. They weren't going to survive, either, Gist and the others realized — unless someone acted right away. The insurance agent from Jonesboro, Arkansas, along with friend Brad Carlisle and guide Jordan Chrestman, headed over in their small boat. “There were dogs everywhere,” Gist said. “They were kind of swimming in circles and didn’t know which direction to go.\" As the dogs' frantic owners watched from the shore, the three men started grabbing whatever dogs they could. There were too many to all fit on the bass boat, so three trips to shore were needed. A photo Gist took during the rescue shows Carlisle standing and grinning in mirrored sunglasses, with more than a half-dozen of the hound dogs perched on the bow. Numbers from the fox hunt are painted on their sides. Other dogs are standing behind the seats — two of them calmly looking ahead as Chrestman, beside them, steers. \"The hero here is Jordan,\" Gist said, as the guide had recognized the danger and sped the boat over. “If it wasn’t for Jordan, there would have been 38 dead dogs.\" The dogs had probably been in the water for about 15 or 20 minutes by then, Gist said. Some of them were so worn out that the men had to reach into the water and lift their heads out. Each dog was then heaved aboard. By the time the last were rescued, they had been in the water for 45 minutes to an hour, Gist said. Dogs, especially when hunting, can “follow game relentlessly, as in this case,” said Chris Gurner, a natural resource specialist with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which patrols Grenada Lake — but he called it rare for them to go that far from shore. Even though they were on a fox hunt, it’s not unusual for the dogs to go after any animal that startled them, he said. “Opportunities to help somebody are in front of us all the time,” Gist said. “Sometimes if you see something, do something.”",

    "text": "TORONTO — A second condemnation of the CFL schedule has earned Edmonton Elks quarterback McLeod Bethel-Thompson another fine. The CFL announced Thursday it was penalizing Bethel-Thompson for a second violation of its code of conduct. Following Edmonton's 20-14 loss to Ottawa on Friday, Bethel-Thompson was publicly critical of the league having both teams play on five days rest. It marked the second time this season that Bethel-Thompson has publicly criticized the league for scheduling the Elks to play games five days apart. After dropping a 39-36 decision in Toronto on June 22, Edmonton was on the short end of a 24-21 score in Vancouver to the B.C. Lions on June 27. The league also fined Edmonton defensive back Loucheiz Purifoy for delivering a high hit on Ottawa receiver Bralon Addison. As well, Winnipeg linebacker Adam Bighill was fined for unnecessary roughness after driving Saskatchewan quarterback Shea Patterson into the ground late in the Riders' 19-9 victory. Bighill was disciplined for hitting Patterson as he rolled out to pass on the final play of the game. As per league policy, the amounts of the fines were not disclosed. This report by The Canadian Press was first published July 25, 2024. The Canadian Press",

Instead, she dedicated the words to new mothers:[..] how will those girls vote, let’s say if there are 400 of them… they are… you won’t deny them the right to vote if they don’t even know exactly who the father is, when the doctor asks them which father he can’t say or not”.\nThe Presidium believes that the statements cited may be perceived as a lack of respect.\nKirstein also made a comparison between “hunweibins” and age in the debate, pointing to his opponent. The expression ”[..] mostly the hunwebi were between 14 and 16 years old, well, they look like you, it’s a compliment for you” can be perceived as an attack on the opponent’s personality and physical characteristics, express the authors of the presentation.\nThe Saeima Presidium believes that Kirstein’s expressions, which included personal attacks and disrespectful comments towards public and opposition groups, clearly violate the parliamentarian’s code of ethics .\nThe commission responsible for the possible opening of the case will decide on Wednesday 23 October.\n#dont #father #proceeding #initiated #Kirštein #violation #code #ethics #statements #Saeima #session\n–",

    "text": "2025年07月16日16:56 | 来源： 三明日报 小字号\n原标题：“党建+政务服务”暖侨心促回归 走进三明市明溪县政务服务中心“侨易办”专窗，党员代办员正通过“远程帮办”系统，指导意大利华侨王先生办理结婚证补办手续。“请您把证件放在镜头前，我们进行人脸比对。”短短半小时，远在万里之外的侨胞就办妥了委托公证，省去往返2万里的奔波。这样高效的服务，正是明溪县创新“党建+政务服务”模式结出的丰硕成果。\n作为“八闽旅欧第一县”，明溪县有1.44万侨胞分布在全球86个国家，约占全县人口的12.6%。如何服务好“远方的亲人”？明溪县行政服务中心管委会党支部（以下简称管委会党支部）深度融合机关党建与业务工作，立足侨情实际，突出组织引领与党员示范，创新打造“侨易办 暖侨心”党建品牌，探索“3+3+3”工作法，聚力解决侨胞、侨企在境内外办事的急难愁盼问题，为“三侨回归”和明溪革命老区高质量发展提供坚实支撑。\n党建领航 架起跨境服务“连心桥”\n“非常感谢侨易办工作人员，跨越地域帮我换领了驾驶证。”远在意大利的侨胞吴先生向工作人员表示感谢。\n明溪县行政服务中心管委会副主任王达伟向记者介绍：“这是我们今年新增的涉侨跨境办理服务事项，通过创新视频线上体检容缺办理的便民措施，联合明溪县总医院启动线上体检流程，为海外侨胞提供线上延期换领驾驶证期满换证服务。”\n近年来，管委会党支部以“侨易办”机制为依托，牵头梳理出25项高频涉侨事项开展跨境办理，设立涉侨政务服务微信群，为侨胞提供24小时业务咨询和预约服务。借助人脸识别、电子签章等技术，实现了“身份远程核验、材料在线提交、结果快递送达”的全流程服务，让侨胞办事“一趟都不用跑”。2023年以来，累计接待侨胞咨询4500人次，办结涉侨事项2650件，为侨胞节省办事成本4100万元。\n走进瀚仙镇石珩村，党员代办员陈文慧正在向老侨眷宣传社保政策。“子女都在国外，我们就是他们的‘家里人’。”为扩大服务半径，管委会党支部建立了“县乡联动”服务网络，由党员干部担任代办专员，像这样的“红色代办”服务已覆盖全县所有乡镇。\n为让为侨服务不是“一阵风”而是“四季春”，管委会党支部探索“3+3+3”工作法，通过“三大课堂”强本领、“三办机制”提质效、“三项机制”保长效，实现党建工作与服务侨胞同频共振。2024年，明溪县行政服务中心管委会党支部获评全市先进基层党组织和五星级党支部称号，“侨易办”服务模式入选省深化行政审批制度改革典型经验案例和优化营商环境工作典型经验做法。\n“全周期”服务 助力侨资项目落地生根\n政务服务的高效便捷，不仅温暖了侨胞的心，更成了吸引侨资回归的“强磁场”。\n“我一趟也不用跑，仅用1小时就拿到了营业执照！”近日，侨商余小姐在侨易办窗口工作人员的帮助下，通过线上快速办结了营业执照开办手续。涉侨服务激发了创业活力，助力回引800余名侨胞、160余名归侨侨眷。\n此外，管委会党支部积极融入县域发展大局，将政务服务延伸至产业发展一线，在侨资企业设立“流动服务站”，助力实施“三侨回归”工程。\n2023年，省、市重点项目——欧起航电商直播及供应链基地申请建设用地规划许可时，原本需30天的审批流程，在“帮代办”机制协助下，仅用半天便完成。从项目签约到开工建设，全程仅用76天，刷新了明溪项目落地的速度。\n这样的高效服务并非个例。管委会副主任杨旷向记者介绍，通过探索“全生命周期”服务模式，推动企业项目审批全程“帮代办”，构建起乡镇及引资企业、职能部门、管委会紧密合作的“三级联动”机制，量身定制了从项目落地到投产经营的“绿色通道”，助力侨企侨资加速回归。\n明溪县行政服务中心管委会党支部书记杨秋香表示，管委会将党建与涉侨政务服务深度融合，把“侨易办”作为检验干部作风的“试金石”，下一步将持续深化“侨易办 暖侨心”党建品牌，拓展“跨境办理”事项清单，让更多侨胞享受到家门口的便利，为明溪革命老区高质量发展注入更强的“侨动力”。（张金玲 罗杰）\n(责编：江苇杭、刘卿) 分享让更多人看到",
