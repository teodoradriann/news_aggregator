    "text": "Unusual Environmental Phenomenon Causes Automobile Damage in Georgia\nA family in Georgia experienced an unusual automotive problem when their 2022 Honda Civic began to show signs of melting due to reflected sunlight from energy-efficient windows. This report delves into the unforeseen interaction between modern energy-saving building features and vehicle materials.\nThe Goldberg family, residing north of Atlanta, Georgia, faced an unexpected issue when parts of their vehicle, including side-view mirrors and bumper, started to warp as if subjected to intense heat. The paint on their car also developed peculiar blisters, a condition likened to damage from a futuristic weapon.\nUpon addressing the issue with the dealership, the family learned that the cause was likely the intense glare reflecting off energy-efficient windows. These windows, while beneficial for reducing indoor heat and conserving energy, can inadvertently focus sunlight to a point where it can damage the plastics and paint on a car’s exterior. Unfortunately for the Goldbergs, this type of environmental damage falls outside the scope of the car manufacturer’s warranty.\nThe family’s dissatisfaction with the response led them to file an official complaint with Honda. Upon further investigation, it seems that while this kind of incident is rare and not unique to Honda, there have been multiple online reports regarding similar damage to the exterior of automobiles.\nAs temperatures gradually climb globally, and energy-saving measures become more prevalent, this incident raises questions regarding the materials used in automobile manufacturing and whether adjustments need to be made to prevent similar occurrences in the future. The Goldberg’s experience serves as a cautionary tale on the complex interplay between environmental conservation efforts and modern material use.\nFAQ Section\nWhat happened to the Goldberg family’s 2022 Honda Civic?\nThe Goldberg family’s Honda Civic began showing signs of melting, with parts of the vehicle like the side-view mirrors and bumper warping and the paint developing blisters.\nWhere is the Goldberg family located?\nThey reside north of Atlanta, Georgia.\nWhat caused the damage to the car?\nThe damage to the car was likely due to intense glare reflecting off of energy-efficient windows, which can focus sunlight and damage car exteriors.\nIs this problem unique to Honda vehicles?\nNo, this type of incident is rare but not unique to Honda. There have been multiple online reports of similar damage to the exteriors of various automobiles.\nDid the car manufacturer’s warranty cover this damage?\nUnfortunately, this type of environmental damage falls outside the scope of the car manufacturer’s warranty.\nWhat does this incident suggest for vehicle manufacturing?\nIt raises concerns about the materials used in automobiles and whether manufacturing processes or materials need adaptation to prevent such occurrences, given increasing global temperatures and more common energy-saving measures.\nDefinitions and Key Terms\nEnergy-efficient windows: Windows designed to prevent the escape of heated or cooled air from the inside of a building, thus saving on energy costs. They can sometimes reflect sunlight strongly enough to cause damage to nearby objects.\nComplex interplay: A situation where multiple factors or elements influence each other in intricate or complicated ways.\nSuggested Related Links:\nNote: The URLs provided are based on typical domain structures for the respective organizations and are assumed to be accurate at the time of this writing.

    "text": "It may be some kind of a record: Omahan Malina Faue, age 3½, has already been to 39 states.\nShe’s seen the Golden Gate Bridge, the Statue of Liberty and a casino in Reno, Nevada. She’s been in a “second line” parade in New Orleans, wearing purple, gold and green Mardi Gras beads and carrying a small umbrella.\nShe cruised at sunset on Lake Michigan in Chicago, and watched fireworks in Washington, D.C., on the Fourth of July. And, for nearly all of her life, she’s been traveling with the cast and crew of a popular Broadway touring musical.\nThis week, Malina arrived at the Orpheum Theater with her parents — musician Mike Faue and “kid wrangler” Anna Speed — and the entire entourage from “The Lion King” to begin a three-week residency.\n“I tell her, ‘You have no idea how lucky you are,” Speed said.\nPeople are also reading…\nFaue and Speed met when “The Lion King” came to Omaha in 2007. He was raised in northern California and has a music degree from Cal State-Northridge. He joined the tour in 2003.\nShe’s from Grand Island, Nebraska, and has a music degree from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. A cellist, she was one of the local musicians that touring shows used to hire, a practice Faue says is increasingly rare.\nThe tour was in Omaha for six weeks the year they met, giving them enough time to realize their relationship might have a future. She went to Hawaii with Faue in August 2007 and remained with the tour. They bought a house in the Old Market and lived there between gigs, and got married at the Orpheum in 2017.\nBut virtually their entire marriage has been on the road. They took a 16-month break in Omaha when Malina was born in 2020 and COVID-19 shuttered the show. But as soon as the pandemic eased, the tour resumed and they returned, this time with a baby.\nAfter years of touring as a couple, adding an infant created some challenges.\n“We are on the road every day of the year,” Speed said. “We have to find sitters in every city. We will have to figure out our schooling situation. And just being on the road is hard. We miss out on weddings, funerals and family reunions.”\nBut it also created new opportunities for exploring and education.\n“It’s a different lifestyle and it works for us,” Speed said.\nMalina is on their schedule, which means she stays up later than most kids her age. The family still follows a morning routine, however: breakfast, a puzzle game, talking about the letter of the day and the color of the day.\nThey schedule daily activities, Faue said, including visiting a gym for kids, going to museums and days at zoos across the country. They also go to the library in every city on the tour.\n“That’s why we’re on the road,” Speed said.\nIt’s not about sitting around in the hotel or bed and breakfast.\nThey also go to national parks whenever they can, enough that Malina participates in junior ranger programs wherever they are. And though she’s still a toddler, she’s remembering a lot about her travels.\nIn St. Louis, for instance, they attended a Cardinals baseball game and met Fredbird, the team mascot. When they encountered an abstract statue of a player in another city, Malina recognized it as “the guy where we saw Fredbird,” Faue said.\nFavorite places include Hawaii and Alaska.\n“It was very cool to go for so many weeks at a time,” Speed said. “We got to feel like we lived there a bit.”\nDuring trick-or-treating in New Orleans, she said, people handed out candy to the kids and cocktails to the adults.\nBut Reno may have been their “craziest” stop yet, she said. In her job as a kid wrangler, she has to make sure the four actors who play young Simba and young Nala make their cues. Performers had to trudge through the casino — past gamblers and scantily-clad cocktail waitresses — to get to the stage door.\n“It was hilarious with these four little kids,” Speed said.\nFor some bizarre reason, there’s also a huge airplane backstage in Reno, and the orchestra was seated behind it because there’s no pit in the auditorium.\nEven with all the adventure on the road, Speed and Faue miss relatives in Nebraska. To compensate, they embrace the cast and crew as their family. They spend holidays together and keep in touch with people who have quit touring and settled in various cities. Some of the kids Faue knew when he was first on the road are now having kids of their own.\nSpeed estimates that she has “wrangled\" at least 80 kids since she got the job in 2007. (She took a break from work for a while). Some have remained in the business, including Niles Fitch, who appeared on TV show “This Is Us” as young Randall. And some took sharp career turns, like the former actor who’s studying to be an accountant.\nMany of the kids on the tour keep in touch long after they quit. One young Simba and one young Nala even reunited to attend senior prom together.\n“They have friends across the country,” Faue said of the show’s kids.\nThe couple said they have no plans to leave the show. They love “The Lion King” and they expect it to be around for a long time because parents and grandparents will want to share it with future generations.\n“One of the things about this show is that it is for all ages,” Speed said. “‘Circle of Life’ (one of the show’s signature songs) really is moving. There are nights when it really catches you off guard, especially when you can see the (audience) reactions. This may be someone’s very first show and someone’s very last.”\nBut no matter how much they like the road and the show, Omaha always beckons. They have lots of plans for the month: visits to family, the Omaha Children’s Museum, the Durham Museum, the Henry Doorly Zoo & Aquarium and the refurbished Gene Leahy Mall and Riverfront.\n“We are so excited to be home for three weeks,” Speed said.",

    "title": "BEST Time to Visit St Lucia: St Lucia Weather Month By Month",
    "text": "St Lucia is a Caribbean island famous for its beaches, carnivals, and vibrant culture. Regarding the best time to visit St Lucia, there is no right or wrong; it just depends on what you want! There’s plenty of nature to explore here, incredible dive sites, and fabulous resorts where you can spend your days lazing around.\nThe best time to visit St Lucia can be tricky to work out, however, as they’ve got wet and dry seasons going on – which is why we put together a St Lucia weather guide. We also threw in a list of the best St Lucia festivals!\nWhen Is The Best Time To Visit St Lucia?\nBefore we dig in it’s important to keep in mind your expectations when traveling to St Lucia and ask yourself these questions:\n- Are you on a budget?\n- Do you care about rain?\n- Does humidity bother you?\n- Do high crowds bother you?\n- Would you rather pay less but take a higher gamble on the weather?\n- Are you interested in just lounging on a\ntropical island,hiking, free diving, surfing, or scuba diving?\nSt Lucia’s Two Main seasons\nDry Season\n- Late December – Late May\n- Driest Month: March\n- High Season (mid-December – April)\n- Higher Prices\n- Less chance of rain\n- A popular time to visit\n- Lower humidity\n- Cooler Temps\nWet/Rainy Season\n- June-Early December\n- Wettest Month: October\n- Hurricane Season: September and October\n- Low Season\n- Lower Prices\n- Rainforests typically experience more rainfall than coastal regions\n- Rainfalls are typically quick and heavy\n- Fewer Crowds\n- Higher humidity (July and August)\n- Higher Temps\nSo When is the Best Time to Visit St Lucia?\nTechnically, for great weather, the best time to travel to St Lucia is from December to May, while the rainfall is low and temperatures are cooler. However, this is far from the cheapest time to visit St. Lucia, and you’ll be looking at high accommodation prices.\nIn Our Opinion?\nLate April to mid-June is the best all-around time to visit St Lucia. This is outside the high season, so the crowds and prices will be lower. While the weather is not as ideal as December – April, it’s still wonderful, with temperatures hovering between 70 and 80°F. You’re getting to St Lucia right before the heavy rainfall hits in July. Hiking trails will be pleasantly dry. Plus – the\nSt. Lucia Jazz Festival is during this time!\nThe Best Time To Visit Saint Lucia: Quick Answers\n- When is the Cheapest Time to visit St Lucia? August – October (Hurrican Season)\n- When is the Best Time to Visit St Lucia for Good Weather? December – April\n- When is the Best Time to Visit St Lucia for Diving? Diving great year-round in St Lucia.\n- When is the Best Time to Visit St Lucia for Birding? During the dry season, between December and April.\nWhen is The Best Time to Visit St Lucia?\nSt Lucia in January\nIn January, St Lucia sees average temperatures of 26°C – pretty warm. In the second month of the country’s dry season, there’s not much rain to be seen. However, since it’s only the start of the dry season, many of the hills around the country remain lush and green, making it one of the best months to visit St Lucia.\nThere’s plenty of sunshine at this time of year, and towards the end of the month, there are 11 and a half hours of daylight per day. It is 55% cloudy throughout the month, and the sea temperature is a very inviting 27°C. With relative humidity that fluctuates between mild and very muggy, it’s a pretty good time of year to visit St Lucia.\nSt Lucia in February\nAnother of St Lucia’s dry months, there are average temperatures of 26°C – with highs of 29°C –\nthroughout February. There is plenty of sunshine to be had, with nine hours per day (on average). There is very little rainfall in February compared to the rest of the year – the least, in fact.\nThough the temperatures may seem hot to you, February is actually one of the cooler months on the island; it may be a good time of year to visit St Lucia if you can’t stand the heat. It is also a fairly breezy time of year, so expect some fresh, light winds coming in off the sea. Like hiking? Then you may find February in St Lucia is perfect for you.\n[Jade Mountain is one of the most beautiful resorts in the entire world - check the rates here!]\nSt Lucia in March\nThe weather in March in St Lucia is great. This is when\nwe visited last and had a fantastic time. It’s definitely one of the best times to visit St Lucia. Visitors to the island during this spring month can expect plenty of sunshine and a lot of warm weather.\nThe average low is 24°C, while the high is 30°C. This month is pretty popular for kite flying and kite surfing, thanks to the northeast trade winds that are beginning to blow.\nIf that sounds like something you’re into, this might be the best time of year to visit St Lucia. The sea has a temperature of 27°C, which is very pleasant. It’s an excellent time to come if you’re keen to go hiking and enjoy the island before the heat really starts to increase.\nSt Lucia in April\nHot and dry days are the order for April in St Lucia. Those Trade Winds are still blowing and cooling things down in the process – mainly on the coast. Being the middle of the country’s dry season, those lush green hills are looking a little more parched than they have been.\nHumidity is comparatively low, so the heat isn’t exactly unbearable; the average temperature in St Lucia during April is 27°C, with highs of 30°C and lows of 24°C. Though it is quite dry and there are, on average, nine hours of sunshine per day, there’s around 70% cloud coverage throughout April, steadily increasing towards the end of the month.\nSt Lucia in May\nSt Lucia in May means a transitional month for the island. It’s not the best time to go to St Lucia, but certainly not the worst. The wet season is right on the horizon, which – towards the end of the month – means a little more rain than the month before, but not much.\nMay is a good time of year to visit St Lucia if you want to attend the island’s famous Jazz Festival, which traditionally kicks off the summer months.\nTemperatures in May rise to 28°C, so things are warming up; humidity is also rising, at around 70% across the month. The Trade Winds are not blowing as strongly as they were before, so expect plenty of sunshine and enjoyable days, not to mention lovely sunsets!\nSt Lucia in June\nBy the time\nJune rolls around in St Lucia, the rains have already arrived. That’s right; June marks the start of the wet – or rainy – season. Don’t worry; the rain is still quite tame and won’t by any means ruin your vacation, but it’s certainly not the best time to go to St Lucia.\nThere is twice as much rain going on in June than there was in May, so you will certainly experience a downpour, or at least a light shower, while you are here. The Trade Winds are nowhere near as strong as they were earlier in the year, which means less of a breeze, but increased humidity. In fact, three out of four days see high humidity. Beautiful sunsets can be seen in June, however. The temperature? On average, it’s 28°C.\nGet Travel Insurance\nProtect yourself from theft, injury, illness, or the unexpected.\nHeymondo has great short-term travel insurance plans! (World Pursuit Readers get 5% off!)\nSt Lucia Weather in July\nSt Lucia in July is a very hot month – very humid, too, so not exactly the best time to visit St Lucia. The highs hover around 31°C, which feels hotter with that humidity. It is also a popular month to visit the island because of school vacation beginning this month for much of the world.\nThat means things can get a little busy on the island towards the end of July. It’s maybe not the best time of year to visit St Lucia. It’s also the St Lucia rainy season, with an average of six inches of rain falling across the entire month. Downpours are common. However, visiting St Lucia is a cool time if you want to catch part of the St Lucia Carnival – one of the Caribbean’s best.\nSt Lucia Weather in August\nNot only is it still raining in St Lucia in August, but it is also the middle of Hurricane Season in the North Atlantic. These don’t tend to be a huge threat to the island, but they can affect it, so it may not be the best time to visit St Lucia. Temperatures are an average of 28°C but can drop as low as 25°C.\nIf you are worried about the rain, don’t be; it usually only rains for a couple of hours at most, and the rainy days are mixed in with glorious, sunny days. It’s humid in August: three out of four days reach as high as 90% humidity. With schools still out, resorts can be busy. If you want to avoid heat (and crowds), this may not be the best time to visit St Lucia.\nSt Lucia Weather in September\nSeptember is the time of year in St Lucia when summer is coming to an end. Resorts get cheaper as children of the world go back to school. However, the temperature is still 28°C – rising into the early 30s – and sea temperatures match. If you love heat, visiting St Lucia is a good time.\nHowever, there is still quite a lot of rainfall, just slightly more than in August. While you will experience some rain during your stay, it most likely won’t ruin your vacation. It is still very humid, around 89% for three days out of four.\nSunshine is definitely lacking: it’s the second rainiest month of the year, with only 8.1 hours of daily sunshine (compared to 8.5, on average, for the year).\nSt Lucia Weather in October\nWere you wondering about October? Well, accommodation is cheaper, so it’s an excellent time to visit St Lucia if you like to travel on a budget. But everything else remains pretty much the same as it was in September.\nIt’s still rainy, it’s still around 28°C, the average low is still about 25°C, the sea is still about 29°C, it’s still very humid, and there’s still just over eight hours of sunshine per day. Expect rain daily (short, sharp showers, for the most part). It’s generally one of the worst times to visit St Lucia, but also one of the cheapest times to visit St Lucia.\nSt Lucia Weather in November\nIn November, there is finally a break in the relentless heat and humidity that has plagued the island for the past few months. November is also the end of the Hurricane Season and the last month of the wet season. So, all in all, not a bad time to go to St Lucia.\nThe rain does start to ease by the end of the month, though there is still plenty of it around. Most days will see a morning downpour, but there may be a couple where it rains all day. The hills are glowing green and looking very beautiful; it’s a good time to go on excursions.\nSt Lucia Weather in December\nThe first month of the dry season,\nDecember, is a great time to visit St Lucia – which is good because this is also the Holiday Season for many people around the world.\nVisitors to the island in December can expect lots of dry days, a little bit of rain, temperatures around 27°C, and – especially towards the end of the month – less humidity. Christmas in St Lucia, anyone? Sounds good to us.\nFestivals in St Lucia\nSpring Festivals in St Lucia\nSt Lucia observes Holy Week, which occurs during April. Many people attend mass and participate in Catholic traditions, including religious meals. Because of the family – and church – the time involved, it is one of the more somber times to visit St Lucia.\nIn early May, Castries sees the Saint Lucia Jazz and Arts Festival – one of the most renowned festivals in the country and the whole of the Caribbean. Popular names in modern jazz (Amy Winehouse once appeared here, for instance) perform on big stages and at small venues. Needless to say, it’s a big deal.\nSummer Festivals in St Lucia\nTaking place between June and July, the\nSt Lucia Carnival is a colorful event. A kaleidoscope of events occurs during this time, such as steel pan competitions and inter-commercial house calypso competitions, with plenty of vibrant carnival costumes, live bands, DJs, parties, fetes, and community events besides. It’s recognized as one of the top carnivals in the Caribbean.\nThe last Sunday in June every year (that’s June 28 in 2020) is time for the Fishermen’s Feast – or Fête Pêche, in French. This Thanksgiving celebration includes church services and, aptly enough, feasting.\nIn July, Mercury Fest brings people together in the name of one simple thing –\n partying on the beach. Attendees rock up at a beach at Pigeon Island National Landmark from the neighboring islands and gather for live music, boat parties, and all-around good times.\nFor something a little less crazy but still super cool, La Rose Flower Festival takes place on August 30. This community-minded cultural event makes up one of the island nation’s two strangely rival flower festivals (the other being La Marguerite). It’s about observing and appreciating St Lucia’s cultural heritage, history, and collective memories.\nAugust 23-25 is when the St Lucia Roots & Soul Festival is about new voices in the realm of music. Free performances occur in various locations across the island, ending with a big party at Pigeon Island National Landmark.\nFall Festivals in St Lucia\nDo you like snorkeling or scuba diving? Fall might be one of the best times to visit St Lucia for you. You can now check out the Saint Lucia Dive & Adventure Week – a time to celebrate the island’s world-class dive sites and diverse marine life. This watery bonanza takes place from September 6-13.\nLater in September (21-27), St Lucia hosts the Wellness Music Festival. This sustainable and environmentally aware music festival is all about healthy living and being good to yourself – all on good music background.\nCelebrated since 1981, Creole Heritage Month is celebrated throughout October. With dance, cuisine, and music taking center stage, it is a celebration of the diversity of the island’s culture, culminating on International Creole Day on October 27.\nThe second of St Lucia’s flower festivals, the La Marguerite Flower Festival, sees members of a local community dress in blue (as opposed to La Rose’s red) as a display of their pride in the La Marguerite flower.\nWinter Festivals in St Lucia\nDecember 13 is when CECF St Lucia takes place. CECF stands for Caribbean Equine Cultural Festival and spans two days of lifestyle and racing events, all held at the Royal Saint Lucia Turf Club.\nAlso December 13 is the country’s National Day. Celebrating its patron saint of St Luce, it is also called “the Festival of Light.” There’s a lantern competition and parade, as well as a Christmas show (since the festive season is just around the corner) and illuminations galore. It all ends with fireworks.\nFebruary 22 is\n St Lucia’s Independence Day. Celebrated since 1979 – when St Lucia gained independence from the United Kingdom – there is kite flying, parades, and other festivals throughout the week. One of the events taking place during Independence “Week” is the Independence Squash Open – like a tennis tournament, but with squash instead!\nHopefully, this guide on the best time to visit St Lucia will help you determine when to go! If you have any questions, please drop a comment, and we will respond!\nWhat to Pack for St Lucia?\nTravel Water Bottle\nPlastic pollution is a problem in the Caribbean, so it’s best not to contribute to the problem by buying plastic water bottles everywhere. Bottles like the Grayl are great for purifying unsafe water!\nDry bag\nDry bags are great if you spend time at the beach or find yourself out on a boat.\nSee the best-reviewed dry bags here.\nRainbow Sandals\nWant to fit in on Saint Lucia? Get yourself some\n Rainbow brand sandals. Seriously, everyone around you will be wearing them – and for a good reason. They are uber comfortable once you break them in and last forever!\nSunscreen\nWe highly recommend getting an eco-friendly sun cream that does not contain harmful chemicals when going into the ocean.\nPlan For Your Trip\n- Protect Your Trip: We don’t travel without\ntravel insurance,nor should you.

    "text": "Ministro de Salud defiende nueva evaluación para el Serums. Video: Canal N El ministro de Salud, César Vásquez , defendió el nuevo proceso de evaluación para el Servicio Rural y Urbano Marginal de Salud (Serums) , argumentando que “el Ministerio de Salud tiene que recuperar la rectoría” en la evaluación de los profesionales de salud.\nEn entrevista con Canal N , Vásquez señaló que hasta ahora, el único colegio profesional que ha manifestado su oposición es el Colegio Médico del Perú, cuyo decano también es docente en la Facultad de Medicina de la Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos (UNMSM) . Según el titular de la cartera, existe un conflicto de intereses , ya que considera que las críticas tienen un trasfondo económico debido a la utilidad que estas evaluaciones generan para las facultades de medicina.\n“El único colegio profesional que está manifestando su posición en contra es el Colegio Médico y en cuanto al decano de la Facultad de Medicina de San Marcos, coincidentemente el decano del Colegio Médico es docente en San Marcos. Para mí, me queda claro que el interés no es político, sino económico, porque hay una utilidad bastante importante que superan los cuatro millones de soles al año solo en facultades de medicina”, declaró Vásquez. El ministro de Salud, César Vásquez, atribuyó las denuncias por desabastecimiento de medicinas a campañas financiadas por cadenas farmacéuticas “La población tiene que entender lo siguiente: las facultades de medicina que forman y educan a los profesionales médicos tienen todo el derecho de tomar los exámenes que deseen, incluso el ENAM (Examen Nacional de Medicina) , por ejemplo, deberían tomarlo antes de darles el título”, enfatizó posteriormente el ministro.\nEn esa línea, cuestionó la legitimidad de que las mismas instituciones que forman a los estudiantes luego evalúen su capacidad para trabajar en el Estado. “No nos parece correcto que la misma entidad que los forma los quiera luego contratar para que trabajen para el Estado. El Ministerio de Salud tiene que recuperar la rectoría ”, añadió.\nEn esa línea, Vásquez también puso en duda que las facultades cobren altas cifras por estas evaluaciones y sugirió que deberían ofrecerlas de manera gratuita como un refuerzo a la formación académica.\n“No es prudente que luego que les entregan un título, que supuestamente les acredita para que estén en condiciones de ejercer, ellos mismos los evalúen y lo que es peor, que cobren cifras altas por estas evaluaciones cuando deberían ser gratuitas”, acotó.\nLa oportunidad de formar parte del cambio en la salud rural y urbana marginal espera a los profesionales listos para el desafío. (Andina) Estudiantes sanmarquinos rechazan postura del Minsa Por otro lado, la Facultad de Medicina de la UNMSM ya comunicó oficialmente su decisión de no participar en el nuevo proceso de evaluación , alineándose con la Asociación Peruana de Facultades de Medicina y la Asociación Peruana de Facultades de Odontología, que también se opone a la medida. Las tres entidades argumentan que el proceso carece de las garantías de calidad necesarias y lo califican como una medida improvisada.\n“Al respecto, le manifestamos que la facultad se abstiene de participar en cualquiera de las etapas comprendidas en dicho lineamiento al no reunir los requisitos esenciales de calidad que una evaluación debe tener en resguardo de una adecuada atención de salud a la población”, señalaron en su reciente pronunciamiento. Asimismo, el decano de la Facultad de Medicina de la UNMSM, Luis Podestá Gavilano , explicó que la decisión de no participar se debe a la falta de requisitos esenciales de calidad en la evaluación, lo que podría afectar la adecuada atención de salud a la población. Además, señaló que no se ha convocado a asesores clave como el Colegio Médico del Perú, la Asociación Peruana de Facultades de Medicina y la Academia Nacional de Medicina.\nEl Ministerio de Salud , por su parte, asegura que otras facultades de medicina sí están de acuerdo con la implementación del nuevo examen Serums y se comprometió a garantizar la transparencia del proceso a través de la participación de órganos de control y otras entidades profesionales que deseen sumarse a la iniciativa.",

    "title": "PHOTO GALLERY: Greene Devils take two from Chiefs",
    "text": "By CARMEN MUSICK Sports Editor ,\n38 minutes ago\nROGERSVILLE — The Cherokee baseball team faced one of its toughest district challenges right off the bat with a season-opening series against defending 3A state champion Greeneville. Unfortunately for the Chiefs, the Greene Devils appear poised to pick up right where they left off.\nCarson Quillen, a Mr. Baseball finalist and Virginia Tech commit, tossed a five-inning no-hitter in a 10-0 win over the Chiefs on Monday at The Reservation.\nThe Chiefs made more of a game of it on Tuesday at Greeneville’s Hardin Park, but the Greene Devils shut the door on the seventh-inning rally to take a 5-3 victory in the home-and-away series. District 2-3A teams meet three times each year — on back-to-back days at each field to start the series and then once later in the season to wrap it up.\nFirst-year Cherokee coach Augustus Fraley said “getting the good competition right off the bat is only going to help” the Chiefs get better as the season goes on.\n“The takeaway for me is just ways of improving. This is the first game of the year. I’m not going to lose sleep over tonight. We’re just going to come back and get better from this opportunity,” Fraley said.\nMonday’s home opener\nQuillen, the 2023 District 2-3A player of the year, pitched Greeneville to victory in the state title game as a sophomore in May and looked every bit the part of a Mr. Baseball finalist in his first junior season start.\nThe teams played a scoreless first before Greeneville got rolling in the second inning. Kobe Mundy reached on an error and moved to second on a sacrifice bunt to set the table for a Noah Murray home run and a 2-0 Greeneville lead. Murray finished 3 for 4 on the night.\nColton Richards put Greeneville up 3-0 in the third with a solo shot to left. Richards went 4 for 4 in the game with a pair of doubles and the home run.\nThe Chiefs kept things manageable until the fourth, when the Greene Devils exploded for five runs to extend the lead to 8-0. An inning later, an RBI double by Richards and an infield single that hit the infield umpire made it 10-0 — putting the pressure on Cherokee to try to avoid the run-rule ending. But they stranded a runner at second to end the game after five.\n“We started off in a manageable position, where we felt like we could compete… We just got in a tough situation that we hadn’t been faced with yet,” Fraley said.\nStarter Manning Brooks took the loss for the Chiefs.\n“That’s a quality hitting team right there. Manning missed a few spots here and there, and it’s one swing of the bat and they make you pay for it,” Fraley said. “It’s like we told the boys, ‘You’ve got to have your A-game when you play somebody like that.’”\nTuesday’s road game\nGREENEVILLE — Greeneville jumped out to 5-0 lead after five innings, but the Chiefs didn’t quit. They made a late run before falling 5-3 in the second game of the series.\nTrailing 5-0 in the top of the seventh, Gage Adkins singled to left field and Mason Emery drew a walk to put a pair of Chiefs aboard with nobody out. Jake Elliott bunted and reached on an error by the pitcher that scored both Adkins and Emery.\nElliott, safe at third, later scored on a groundout by Gavin Housewright to clear the bases. Greeneville made a pitching change, and Carson Norris got the strikeout he needed to end the game.\nIn all, three Greeneville pitchers held the Chiefs to just two hits — one each by Clay Wagoner and Adkins. Starter Will Harmon picked up the win. He allowed just one hit in six innings, walked one and struck out nine.\nCherokee starter Keaton Lawson was tagged with the loss. The Greene Devils managed five runs — all unearned — on seven hits. Lawson walked three and struck out nine. Housewright worked an inning in relief.\nLooking ahead\nCherokee (0-2, 0-2) will host North Greene on Thursday, March 14, and travel to Union County on Friday, March 15, for a pair of nonconference games. Both games will start at 5:30 p.m. The Chiefs return to District 2-3A competition on Monday, March 18, at Claiborne. Game time there is 6 p.m.\n“We’re going to come out night in and night out and give it our best go — and whatever happens happens. That’s the glory of the game of baseball... Everybody’s gotta field the baseball. Everybody’s gotta throw the baseball and everybody’s gotta catch the baseball,” Fraley said Monday. “We’re just going to keep competing.”",

    "text": "La motion de censure du Nouveau Front populaire (NFP) contre le premier ministre Michel Barnier sera déposée en fin de semaine prochaine, ont annoncé les chefs du parti ce jeudi 26 septembre 2024. Les chefs du Nouveau Front populaire à l'Assemblée ont décidé jeudi, selon des sources parlementaires, que leur motion de censure contre le gouvernement Barnier serait déposée en fin de semaine prochaine plutôt qu'après sa déclaration de politique générale, pour qu'elle gagne en visibilité.\nLes chefs des quatre groupes du NFP à l'Assemblée, LFI, PS, Écologiste et social et GDR (communistes et ultramarins), se sont également entendus pour que la motion de censure soit défendue par un membre du groupe socialiste.\nSi le projet de certains de membres de l'alliance de gauche était de la déposer immédiatement après la déclaration de politique générale (DPG) du Premier ministre, mardi 1er octobre à l'Assemblée nationale , les leaders du NFP ont finalement fait le choix de la déposer plus tard, \"probablement\" jeudi ou vendredi, selon une source parlementaire confirmant une information de LCP.\n289 voix nécessaires Un détail qui a son importance pour la date de son examen. Le règlement de l'Assemblée impose qu'une motion de censure doit être discutée au plus tôt quarante-huit heures, et au plus tard le cinquième jour de séance après son dépôt.\nEn dégainant quelques jours plus tard la gauche se donnerait ainsi toutes les chances que la motion soit examinée en début de semaine suivante (celle du 7 octobre), lui donnant un écho politique et médiatique plus important, d'autant que les leaders du NFP auront déjà pris la parole dans la foulée de la \"DPG\".\n\"Si on la dépose le mardi, on la défend le jeudi et on redit la même chose qu'on a dite deux jours avant\", souligne un député socialiste, soucieux de voir la motion de censure coïncider avec la semaine où le gouvernement doit présenter le très inflammable budget de l'État.\nCette motion de censure, la première qu'affrontera Michel Barnier, aurait toutefois besoin des voix des députés du Rassemblement national pour avoir une chance d'obtenir les 289 voix nécessaires et faire chuter le gouvernement dès le mois d'octobre. Un calendrier jusqu'ici écarté par les cadres du groupe de Marine Le Pen .\ndossier : Michel Barnier Premier ministre",
