    "title": "Australian Bishop Christopher Saunders Arrested, Charged With Rape",
    "text": "Australian Bishop Christopher Saunders Arrested, Charged With Rape The Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported that Bishop Saunders will plead not guilty to the charges brought against him. Christopher Saunders, the bishop emeritus of Broome, Australia, has been arrested and charged with rape and other charges based at least in part on the findings of a Vatican investigation into allegations he abused vulnerable young men. Authorities announced Thursday that they were charging the 74-year-old prelate with two counts of rape, 14 counts of unlawful and indecent assault, and three counts of indecently dealing with a child as a person in authority, which reportedly occurred in the towns of Broome, Kununurra, and the Aboriginal community of Kalumburu between 2008 and 2014. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation [reported](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-22/former-broome-bishop-saunders-to-deny-19-criminal-charges/103496282) that Bishop Saunders will plead not guilty to the charges brought against him. Bishop Saunders was released on bail on a AU$10,000 ($6,500) bond on Thursday and has been ordered by the Broome Magistrates Court to reside at this home until the initial hearing in June. In a [press release](https://www.catholic.au/s/article/Matter-regarding-Bishop-Christopher-Saunders) published on Thursday, Archbishop Timothy Costelloe, president of the Australian Catholic Bishops’ Conference, said the allegations made against Saunders “are very serious and deeply distressing, especially for those making those allegations.” Noting that it is “right and proper, and indeed necessary, that all such allegations be thoroughly investigated,” Archbishop Costelloe expressed that the Church “will continue to cooperate fully with the police and take every necessary step to avoid any actions which may compromise the integrity and autonomy of the police investigation.” Bishop Saunders was ordained to the priesthood in 1976. Before he was appointed the bishop of Broome in 1996, he had several assignments with aboriginal parishes. The Diocese of Broome, a suffragan diocese of the Archdiocese of Perth, is located in the remote northwestern region of Kimberley in the state of Western Australia and covers an area of approximately 297,000 square miles. Allegations were first made in 2020 against Bishop Saunders, who took a step back from the active governance of the diocese later that year. He formally resigned in 2021, citing “ill health.” After an initial police investigation did not result in any charges against Bishop Saunders, Pope Francis ordered a canonical investigation — the first of its kind in Australia — following his 2019 motu proprio [Vos Estis Lux Mundi](https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/motu_proprio/documents/20230325-motu-proprio-vos-estis-lux-mundi-aggiornato.html), which established a new set of norms for the universal Church concerning the procedural handling of sexual abuse cases. The investigation was overseen by Archbishop Mark Coleridge of the Archdiocese of Brisbane but carried out by private investigators, culminating in a 200-page report. A new investigation was opened on the allegations brought against Bishop Saunders after the report was handed over to Australian police. In January, detectives from the Child Abuse Squad raided Saunders’ former home as part of “an ongoing investigation into historic child sex offenses.” Australian news outlet [7NEWS](https://7news.com.au/news/wa/wa-police-call-for-church-authorities-to-hand-over-vatican-report-into-bishop-of-broome-sex-scandal-c-11958237) in September 2023 obtained the investigative report, which detailed a pattern of grooming young men and occasions of coercing young men to undress and perform sexual acts. The report also noted that Bishop Saunders held “bunga-bunga” parties, which were attended only by young men. The bombshell report stated that Bishop Saunders “spent hundreds of thousands of dollars grooming vulnerable young Aboriginal males by supplying them with gifts of alcohol, telephones, cash, and travel.” “The bishop has been variously described by witnesses as … a sexual predator that seeks to prey upon vulnerable Aboriginal men and boys,” the investigative report said. - Keywords: [christopher saunders](https://www.ncregister.com/tag/christopher-saunders)",

Because of their magnetic nature, the electrons that cause the Northern Lights are normally just drawn to our planet’s poles, according to the NOAA. But major geomagnetic storms can cause those electrons to expand further afield, blinking and [changing shape](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/content/aurora-tutorial) depending on the time of night.

    "text": "(OSV News) — Legislation that would require clergy to report child abuse or neglect in Washington state was recently approved by the Legislature and has been sent to Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson for his signature.\nSome have expressed concern that without exceptions for clergy-penitent privilege, the bill could place Catholic priests at odds with civil law in order to uphold church law regarding the seal of the confessional.\nNo confession exception\nSenate Bill 5375, sponsored by Democratic Sen. Noel Frame of Seattle seeks to make members of the clergy mandatory reporters, or people required by law to report suspected or known instances of child abuse or neglect, without an exception to the requirement for sacramental confessions.\nIn a February statement about her bill to make clergy mandatory reporters, Frame said, “It’s long past time that the Legislature steps up, closes this loophole, and protects children.”\n“I know this is a tough subject for many of my colleagues, especially those with deep religious views,” she said. “I respect that, but this bill is about the separation of church and state. This bill is about the state’s secular responsibility to the public interest of protecting children. That’s the most important thing we do here.”\nFerguson’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment from OSV News about his plans for the legislation.\nSimilar bills failed in the Legislature in the two previous years after lawmakers could not reach consensus on the exception.\nWashington State Catholic Conference opposition\nThe Washington State Catholic Conference opposed the particular version of the legislation that was passed, urging its supporters to tell their lawmakers to reject it “unless it is amended to provide a narrow exception for confidential communications between a member of the clergy and a penitent person of faith.”\n“The majority of states that include clergy as mandatory reporters include an exemption for confidential communications, demonstrating that the states’ interests in child protection can be achieved without violating the right to free exercise of religion,” the conference said in its advocacy bulletin.\nThe conference, which is the public policy arm of the state’s Catholic bishops, has stated it would support such legislation with an exemption for the sacrament of confession.\nMost states that specifically include clergy in their mandatory reporting laws provide some clergy-penitent privileges to varying degrees, according to data from the Child Welfare Information Gateway, which operates under the Children’s Bureau at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church states that priests are strictly forbidden from divulging what penitents tell them during confession, which is part of the sacrament of reconciliation, and states that information a penitent divulges is under “seal.”\n“Given the delicacy and greatness of this ministry and the respect due to persons, the Church declares that every priest who hears confessions is bound under very severe penalties to keep absolute secrecy regarding the sins that his penitents have confessed to him,” the catechism states.\nKate Scanlon is a national reporter for OSV News covering Washington.
