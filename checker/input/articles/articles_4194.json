    "text": "( Morning Star News ) – An Iranian Christian convert faces possible expulsion from Turkey and a three-year prison sentence on a charge of spreading “propaganda against the Islamic Republic of Iran,” according to religious freedom advocates. The government of Turkish President Recept Tayyip Erdogan continued its crackdown on expatriate Christians with the Jan. 29 arrest of Mojtaba Keshavarz Ahmadi, 56, on questionable immigration charges, according to a statement by advocacy group Article 18. “Despite being in Turkey for over a decade and applying for refugee status, Mojtaba has never been interviewed about his case and has therefore never been granted official protection,” the group reported. Turkish immigration authorities accused Ahmadi of leaving Düzce, his assigned city of residence, without prior government authorization. Ahmadi has denied the accusation, and Turkish authorities have yet to provide any evidence to support their claim, according to Article 18. The Turkish government assigns applicants for U.N. refugee status a city where they are required to live during the application processing. The aim is to spread the burden that close to 4 million refugees in Turkey could bring to any one area of the country. Authorities seized Ahmadi’s card identifying him as a candidate for refugee status and took him to an immigration detention center located just outside Ayvacık, in western Turkey near the Aegean Sea, where he remains. The status of any formal charges against him are unknown, and he has very few legal rights. “Facing a three-year prison sentence in Iran on account of his Christian faith and activities, there can be little doubt that Mojtaba is worthy of asylum,” Article 18 stated. The group highlighted the plight of Iranian Christian refugees in a joint report last year, including the threat of deportation. Several other Iranian Christians have been transferred to deportation camps in recent years, the group stated. “There is a concerning trend, where individuals with valid asylum claims are being put in these camps, seemingly arbitrarily,” a source who wished to remain anonymous told Article 18. “There have been other instances in which…an immigration officer from the Turkish authorities has unexpectedly knocked on their door. If they don’t open the door, they are accused of not being in their designated location, whereas they may only have gone to the shops.” Ahmadi, the son of an Islamic cleric, fled to Turkey due to persecution in Iran. After putting his faith in Christ on Christmas Day, 2002, by March 2004 he’d begun participating in house-church meetings and “talked to many people about Christianity in the cities of Tehran, Qom, Kashan, and Arak,” Ahmadi said in a witness statement to Article 18. In September 2010, four plainclothes security officials raided a small meeting of three Christians that Ahmadi was leading. The officers seized their Christian materials, including numerous Bibles and films about Christ. Authorities handcuffed and threw them into a van and blindfolded them. Iranian officials held Ahmadi in a detention center and then Arak prison for 170 days, he told Article 18. During the first week of his detention, Ahmadi was held in solitary confinement and interrogated several times a day, blindfolded and subjected to brutal beatings. “They beat me with their fists, with kicks, and with all their might,” he told Article 18. “They slapped, punched and kicked my whole body, especially my head and face. I don’t know how long it took; I only know that eventually I surrendered myself to the punches and kicks of the interrogators.” Ahmadi credited his survival to a voice he heard after he was taken back to his cell following a beating. “I heard a clear and noble voice in my heart, saying: ‘Be still, and cling to me tightly!’ This voice in my heart gave me an unnatural strength,” Ahmadi told Article 18. “In those moments, it was only Jesus Christ who could give me the strength so that I could endure the physical and mental torture and be able to hold steadfastly and courageously to all my beliefs, and not deny them.” Eventually Ahmadi was found guilty of two crimes, “carrying out propaganda activities against the holy regime of the Islamic Republic,” and “insulting the sacred.” He was sentenced to three years in prison for each charge, but appealed. The second charge was eventually thrown out after a witness shouted in court that he had been forced into making a false confession against Ahmadi. The first charge stuck, however, and Ahmadi was sentenced to three years in prison. In November 2012, Ahmadi, who had appealed the court’s rulings in absentia, was informed that a judge had issued a warrant ordering he be arrested and taken to prison to begin his three-year sentence. Fearful of facing three years of beatings and other torture, Ahmadi fled the country and entered Turkey in March 2013. Ahmadi is hardly the first Iranian to face deportation from Turkey. Last year Article 18 documented numerous cases of Turkish officials harassing Iranian Christian refugees. In one wave of arrests that lasted six months in 2023, officials rounded up five Iranian Christian refugee families and took them to detention centers, threatening them with deportation. Other Christians have been targeted in Turkey by a weaponized immigration and refugee system. Since a coup attempt in 2016, the Erdogan government has singled out expatriate Christians from the West for expulsion. Numerous long-term foreign residents, especially those in teaching or leadership roles in churches, have had their residency permits revoked without cause. Other expatriate Christians who had lived in Turkey without incident for decades have received an N-82 security code identifying them as a “threat to public order and security.” The immigration code acts as a ban for reentry into the country for those who leave. At least 75 foreign Christian workers and their families were kicked out of Turkey between 2020 and 2023, according to Open Doors. This figure does not begin to address the untold number of expatriate Christians who fled Turkey of their own accord out of fear. Turkey ranks 50th on Open Doors’ 2024 World Watch List of the most difficult places to be a Christian. Iran ranks ninth.

    "text": "- Paige VanZant spoke in detail about the dangers of cutting weight for fights - VanZant, 29, has turned to Onlyfans after leaving fights behind - DailyMail.com provides the latest international sports news. Paige VanZant opened up about the dangers of cutting weight for UFC fights in a very candid discussion on her latest podcast episode with her husband, MMA fighter Austin Vanderford. Fighters often essentially dehydrate themselves to make weight class for a fight and, as VanZant also alluded to, they often starve themselves or resort to other methods to clear their system. Her husband Vanderford told VanZant that he enjoyed the process, prompting her to tell him exactly how and why she didn’t. “The best feeling in the world is after a weight loss, the next day,” Vanderford said. “You feel so, so good.” VanZant, who fought in the UFC for six years until 2020, responded firmly and told him: ‘No. TMI, TMI, here I come: every time I lose weight. I shit my pants.’ Paige VanZant has boldly opened up about the dangers of cutting weight for UFC fights VanZant, 29, fought in the UFC for six years before stepping away from MMA in 2020. He recently revealed that he makes more money through Onlyfans than fighting. She continued: ‘Every time I weighed myself, I would try to rehydrate (and get sick) instantly. So part of USADA (United States Anti-Doping Agency) is that once they see you, you can’t lose sight of them, because, you know, it’s the whole anti-doping thing. ‘Maybe you’re going to do something to mask the drugs or take something. I don’t even know. “So, I had my drug tester in the bathroom with me for two hours, while I shit my brains out.” VanZant is believed to be planning to return to mixed martial arts at some point, but in November, the 29-year-old opened up about how much money she has made through Onlyfans. ‘OnlyFans has definitely been my biggest source of income. I would say combined, in my wrestling career,’ he told Glenny Balls of Barstool Sports. ‘I think I made more money in 24 hours on Onlyfans than in my entire wrestling career. Set. Yeah.’",

    "text": "If you have been following the news in artificial intelligence, you probably already know that this field is growing at an exponential pace. Each day we are hearing about new use cases in AI, use cases, and applications that we haven't even dreamt of in the past few years.\nBut in the same news, you probably are also hearing about AI systems that have been deployed to production that are not yielding the expected outcomes. We are hearing about chatbots that have been misdirecting customers and employees into making the wrong decisions.\nWe also heard about chatbots that are hallucinating responses to customers. And we also heard about models that have been generating biased outcomes.\nThere is no denying that there is huge potential in artificial intelligence, but a premature deployment and adoption of AI systems could put companies at a huge risk of reputational and financial loss. And this exactly is the reason why AI governance platforms have become one of the most relevant and important topics today.\nWhat is an AI Governance Framework?\nAI governance refers to a set of rules, standards, and processes that have been set in place in order to ensure the responsible and ethical development and deployment of artificial intelligence systems.\nThink of it as a set of guardrails, that ensure the ethical use of these artificial intelligence systems so that we minimize the risk in the systems while maximizing the potential benefit.\nBenefits of AI Governance\nNow we all know what the benefits are of artificial intelligence. It leads to reduced costs, improved efficiency, and leads to automation of repetitive and manual tasks. While these benefits make artificial intelligence a highly important topic and the most sought-after technology today, there is still at risk in artificial intelligence that is making AI governance an even more important topic to be discussed.\nWhat are the Components of an AI Governance Framework?\nManage an AI Inventory\nConduct Risk Assessments\nEstablish Roles and Accountability\nConduct Model Testing\nTrack Laws and Regulations\nGenerate Model Documentation\nManage Vendor Risk\nTrain and Educate Your Team\nChallenges of AI Risk AssessmentLack of Transparency\nNo matter how much the AI models become smarter, there will always be the chance of errors with AI, and there are dozens of examples available on the internet. Even the developers who made these systems don't know how AI operates and assess risks. This lack of visibility makes it challenging to assess risks, and due to this organizations struggle to build trust with stakeholders\nRapid Technological Leaps\nAI is growing at a rapid growth and the government is no doubt trying to adopt the new technologies but they can’t achieve the maximum. As a result, AI systems lack some crucial resources and fail to detect risks. Even organizations failed to establish stable risk assessment frameworks, as the tools and techniques used today may become obsolete within months.\nRegulatory & Legal Hurdles\nGovernments worldwide are introducing new laws to ensure AI systems remain ethical, transparent, and fair, but they can do this to some extent. Because every region and industry is different so do the rules which may conflict with one another. Moreover, it's early to say that AI will become smart enough to handle legal issues as many AI regulations are still in their early stages.\nEthical Dilemmas\nThe purpose of using AI in risk assessment is to reduce human efforts. The problem we are seeing this AI today is unfair behavior of AI based on different factors like race, gender, or social background. Another ethical issue is deciding how much control AI should have. We all know that AI can analyze huge amounts of data fast, but should it always make important decisions without human supervision?\nBest Practices for AI Risk MitigationAI Model Discovery\nEvery technology comes with challenges and limitations but it does not mean we should not adopt technology. Instead of fear from AI, organizations should have clear information about all AI models that they are using in their systems for transparency and accountability. If you do not know which AI platform works best for risk assessment associated with your business, you will face severe security risks.\nAI Model Risk Assessment\nIf you have done with AI models, the next step is to identify potential threats and weaknesses in artificial intelligence systems before they cause harm. However, a detailed risk check-up will help AI models to work correctly and follow legal rules. To properly check AI risks, organizations should use a clear process that includes regular monitoring, and third-party audits.\nData & AI Mapping and Flows\nAI needs excessive and accurate data to perform well and AI governance platforms have an abundance of data but without a clear mapping of its sources, organizations face the risk of data breaches.\nHowever, if data is mapped properly then AI will surely help to find weak points. To map data and AI effectively, organizations should record all data sources and track how AI changes the data,\nData & AI Controls\nUsing AI for risk assessment if fine but its important to make sure that AI models operate securely and ethically. Without proper controls, AI system may process unauthorized data, or fail to meet industry standards. As a business owner, you can use AI controls by defining clear policies for data usage and implementing encryption techniques. Additionally, AI models should undergo continuous testing and validation to detect erorors and performance issues.\nConclusion\nThe rapid growth of artificial intelligence presents both opportunities and risks for businesses. Without proper AI governance frameworks, organizations are at risk of reputational and financial loss. To mitigate these risks, businesses should conduct thorough risk assessments and stay updated on laws and regulations.\nImplementing best practices such as AI model discovery and risk assessment can help ensure the responsible use of AI. Ultimately, AI governance platforms play a pivotal role in maximizing the benefits of AI while minimizing the associated risks.\nMedia Contact\nCompany Name: Aiguardianapp\nContact Person: David Thomas\nEmail: Send Email\nCity: New York\nCountry: United States\nWebsite: https://www.aiguardianapp.com/\nStock Quote API & Stock News API supplied by www.cloudquote.io\nQuotes delayed at least 20 minutes.\nBy accessing this page, you agree to the following\nand .",

    "text": "Heat wave puts older residents at risk in Charlotte Mecklenburg County released an extreme heat advisory through Friday. Older adults are among the most vulnerable to heat, with heat-related visits to county emergency departments being the highest among this age group. There has only been one heat-related death among adults 65 and over in Mecklenburg since 2011, according to the North Carolina Division of Public Health. But the rate of heat-related visits to the county’s emergency department remains highest among older adults. That rate increased over the last six years. Robyn Stone, who oversees research at [LeadingAge](https://leadingage.org/) recently wrote about climate change’s disproportionate impact on older adults in a new book, \"Climate Justice and Public Health.\" Stone says that as we age, our bodies experience heat differently. “If you are extremely overheated, you might not sweat, but you will become extremely cognitively impaired and lose your sense of consciousness,” Stone said. She says older adults often encounter financial and information barriers to extreme weather resources. Cognitive impairments, such as Alzheimer’s disease, may make communicating risks, warnings and offers of assistance difficult. Mecklenburg has many programs that provide assistance during weather-related emergencies. The county offers free box fans to county residents ages 60 and up. During heat waves like this one, county senior centers act as cooling centers for anyone in the community. Energy bill assistance is also available through the county’s Crisis Intervention Program. The Charlotte Area Transit System will offer free rides to designated cooling centers during the heat advisory. However, Stone argued that it’s not enough to provide relief during an emergency. Beyond heat waves, Stone looked at other weather-related events, such as hurricanes. In 2008, [many older adults visited emergency departments](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/disaster-medicine-and-public-health-preparedness/article/abs/vulnerability-of-older-adults-in-disasters-emergency-department-utilization-by-geriatric-patients-after-hurricane-sandy/17AAB203F6729CC7BE19681B3FBD2829) in the weeks following Hurricane Sandy because access to services, such as prescription refills, was interrupted. “It can’t be a plan just for the emergency,” Stone said. “It has to be a plan before, and there has to be a plan after.” Stone also said there’s something anyone can do for older adults in their community. “If you’re living in a community with older adults who are living alone, check on them. Make sure things are working,” Stone said.",
