    "text": "Watch the animated short featuring the series’ 2nd single, with vocals by Blake Roman; the new series streams January 19 on Prime Video with early access January 12 on A24’s app. [Prime Video](https://www.awn.com/tag/prime-video) and A24 Music have shared “Poison,” the second single from the soundtrack of the highly anticipated adult animation series [Hazbin Hotel](https://www.awn.com/tag/hazbin-hotel). The high-energy pop track is written and produced by composers Sam Haft and Andrew Underberg, and features vocals by Blake Roman. Check out the animated lyric video of “Poison” below. The season premieres with the first four episodes on January 19, 2024, with two more rolling out each week through February 2. The series will stream in more than 240 countries and territories worldwide. Hazbin Hotel follows Charlie, the princess of Hell, as she pursues her seemingly impossible goal of rehabilitating demons to peacefully reduce overpopulation in her kingdom. After a yearly extermination imposed by angels, she opens a hotel in the hopes that patrons will be \"checking out\" into heaven. While most of Hell mocks her goal, her devoted partner Vaggie and their first test subject, adult-film star Angel Dust, stick by her side. When a powerful entity known as the \"Radio Demon\" reaches out to assist Charlie in her endeavors, her crazy dream is given a chance to become a reality. Created by Vivienne Medrano, Hazbin Hotel is based on her popular animated pilot released on YouTube in 2019 that quickly generated over 89 million views and a rabid worldwide fan base. The series blends adult humor, unforgettable characters, and catchy musical numbers, creating a wholly original and unique world. Check out the lyric video and get a taste of “Poison:” Medrano serves as executive producer and director for all episodes. Joel Kuwahara, Dana Tafoya-Cameron, and Scott Greenberg (Season 1) also serve as executive producers. Hazbin Hotel is produced by A24 and FOX Entertainment’s Emmy Award-winning animation studio, Bento Box Entertainment.

    "text": "The Bethel nursing program has successfully completed its most recent accreditation process.\nThe baccalaureate degree program in nursing at Bethel College is accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education ( http://www.ccneaccreditation.org ).\nThe accreditation process takes place every 10 years.\n“In July, we received full approval from the Kansas State Board of Nursing with no recommendations for improvement,” said Becky Bartell, director of Bethel’s Department of Nursing.\n“Earlier in the semester, I received word from CCNE that we have been granted accreditation for another 10 years and that we ‘substantially complied with all four accreditation standards.’”\nThe accreditation takes effect retroactively, as of Feb. 26, 2024, and extends to Dec. 31, 2034.\nThe on-site evaluation took place in late February and early March of this year, and the next one will be at approximately the same time in 2034.\nA continuous improvement progress report (CIPR) will be submitted at the 5-year mark.\nThe program is evaluated based on the CCNE Standards for Accreditation of Baccalaureate and Graduate Nursing Programs (2018).\n“We are thrilled to see the dedication and hard work of our students, alumni, faculty and staff being recognized,” Bartell said.\n“Our nursing program stands out for its excellence, and this was clearly evident to the site visitors.\n“This achievement is a testament to the commitment and passion that everyone involved has put into making our program exceptional.”\nBethel is a four-year liberal arts college founded in 1887 and is the oldest Mennonite college in North America. Bethel was the first Kansas college or university to be named a Truth, Racial Healing and Transformation (TRHT) Campus Center, in 2021. For more information, see http://www.bethelks.edu",

    "text": "The Spirit of Peace Lutheran Church in Milwaukee has officially decided to close its doors. Leaders with the LGBTQ+ affirming congregation say they were unable to fully recover from the pandemic. Their last service will be this weekend. Spirit of the Peace was known to be as inclusive as churches come. TMJ4's Sydni Eure says she felt that welcome as soon as she shook Pastor Michael McAllister's hand. The church has hosted a Lutheran congregation for more than a hundred years, but it became Spirit of Peace Lutheran Church in 2014. Inclusivity has become a major part of the church's mission, from welcoming members of the LGBTQ+ community to meeting people through the food pantry they've operated for years. Pastor McAllister says all walks of life worship at Spirit of Peace. He says it'll be bittersweet to say goodbye, but a legacy will live on. \"The love and the faithful service and worship that we've done in this place will live on,\" McAllister says. \"It will live on through us and the other ministries we will continue to support and that's something important to realize and remember.\" McAllister says the congregation will find other churches to call home.
