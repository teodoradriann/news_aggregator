    "text": "Impressive teenager Jutorre Burgess came off the bench to help Harborough Town move a step closer to qualifying for the prestigious FA Cup. The 18-year-old Bermudian winger made an impact in an impressive 3-2 comeback win away at Darlaston Town in the first round of FA Cup qualifying at Paycare Ground on Wednesday. “It was a pleasure playing in the oldest competition in the world,” an elated Burgess told The Royal Gazette. “I just want to thank God first and foremost and also thank Harborough Town for trusting me to come on when we were 2-0 down to make an impact and then eventually winning 3-2 in the replay. “Everything has happened really fast, so I just have to keep my head down and continue working.” Burgess, who started in Harborough’s goalless draw at home to Darlaston in the initial cup tie at Bowdens Park last weekend, has made early strides at the Southern League Premier Division Central club. “The club, players and the fans have been very welcoming,” Burgess added, having become the first player from the club’s under-23 squad to sign with the senior team. “During my first appearance with the first team in preseason they made me instantly feel welcome and even coming on late in the game to make my debut. Just hearing the fans clapping your first couple of steps on the pitch and even asking for pictures shows that this really is a family club that support the team.” The transition from academy to senior level has been a seamless one for the former Hamilton Parish youth player. “Transitioning from Brooke House College Football Academy straight into men’s football would be hard for anybody, but my development at the school has given me the platform I need to make such a huge step up,” Burgess explained. “But the transition isn’t just on the pitch, it’s also before and after the game in the changing rooms and even how you recover and prepare because the games are very close together and if you don’t recover right it will take a toll on your body.” Burgess offered a glimpse of his potential in only his second appearance for the senior squad when he came off the bench to help salvage a point in a league derby at Kettering Town on August 26. “It’s really hard to put into words coming on in a derby as a teenager with 1,500 home fans giving you stick and then turning around and winning the penalty in the dying minutes of the game to earn a valuable point which sent the fans nuts,” he said. “I even got some beer on me from me jumping in the crowd. But that’s how you know that the fans are behind us wherever we go and we just have to repay them by winning games.” Josh Unsworth, the Harborough under-23 coach, has high expectations for the promising player. “I’m super impressed with Jutorre,” he said. “To come to a new environment surrounded by new players, new coaches, it’s not easy for a young lad to come into that. He took it in his stride. “It’s important for me to get to know my players on a personal level, too. To build that trust, that relationship, so when we go onto the pitch we’re ready for war together. Jutorre has adapted that mentality quickly.” “My only expectation is on Jutorre is to be the best version of himself. That’s all. “If he does that, boy, the sky is the limit. He is so talented, so dedicated, so committed. If he carries on how he’s doing, the boy will go far.” Need to Know How do I clear my cache and cookies? 2.

    "text": "<p>Région de Donetsk, (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th May, 2024) In a small house near the front line, the location a closely guarded secret, around 40 Ukrainian soldiers gathered for a copious breakfast to celebrate the Orthodox Easter.</p><p> Gathered in a canteen, where the windows were blacked out with tarpaulins, the men of the 24th motorised brigade lined up in front of the chaplain.</p><p> Under the harsh light of the lightbulb, the faces appeared tired after more than two years of harrowing warfare.</p><p> Singing, prayers, blessing: the service lasted nearly an hour before the soldiers sat down to a breakfast of chicken, mashed potato, cakes and sodas.</p><p> \"In the context of the day-to-day military work, this is a spiritual relief, a spiritual uplifting,\" said one soldier, 49-year-old Igor Kotsko.</p><p> \"It also gives you a lot of strength. To keep your morale up, to keep fighting the enemy,\" he added.</p><p> Rostyslav Osushan, the 39-year-old military chaplain, shared the soldiers' meal, seated beside them.</p><p> \"In war, life and death are so close,\" he said. \"And yet you have to see and feel the inner strength, which you can only get from the spirit.\"</p><p> The men were celebrating Easter at a time when Russian forces have been making frontline gains because of the lack of weapons and ammunitions on the Ukrainian side.</p><p> Asked what the troops needed most badly, Osushan replied: \"Ammunition and God.\"</p><p> \"You need ammunition, good weapons, and you also need to have a strong inner resilience,\" he added. \"It's psychology, and you also need to have spiritual power. So you need both.\"</p><p> Just a few dozen kilometres away to the south, a small village next to the front line serves as the base for the 59th mechanised brigade.</p><p> This time, it is a visiting chaplain who comes by to celebrate Easter with a handful of the unit's soldiers gathered in front of a house.</p><p> \"It's a chance for my guys to relax, those who are here,\" said Mykola Panyshenko, the group's 45-year-old commander. \"For whether you're in the trenches or here, you have to get your job done at all times.\"</p><p> Panyshenko, who has led the brigade, which has been in position here since November 2022, did not join his men for the service.</p><p> \"You know, if there was a lot of God here, there wouldn't be so many deaths,\" he said. \"And there are a lot of deaths here. There is a lot of pain and suffering.</p><p> \"I understand that God protects Ukraine, because Ukraine is still holding on. The whole world is helping Ukraine. But here, at the front, in these trenches, there is certainly a lot more death than God,\" Panyshenko added.</p><p> On the horizon, plumes of dark smoke rose up into the blue sky, as the sound of artillery and heavy explosions carried across to the house, not far away.</p>",

    "text": "Africa CDC in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia – is a promising way for countries to domestically invest in strengthening their health systems. The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) plans to declare mpox a public health emergency of continental concern next week, marking the first such declaration in the agency’s history.\nThe decision follows a surge in mpox cases across Africa in 2024, matching 2023’s total in just six months. Since January 2022, over 38,000 cases and 1,456 deaths have been reported. This year, 10 African Union states have recorded more than 14,000 cases and 450 deaths, with 2,750 confirmed — 160% higher than the same period in 2023.\nRecent outbreaks in Ivory Coast, Kenya and Uganda highlight the virus’s expanding reach. Mpox infections in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda are the first on record in these countries.\nA new variant of the mpox virus, known as clade 1b, is fueling the outbreak in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) that has spread to neighboring countries. The DRC, where mpox was first detected in 1970 and remains endemic, bears the brunt of this outbreak, accounting for more than 96% of both cases and deaths.\nJean Kaseya, director of Africa CDC, announced the impending declaration Thursday, emphasizing its significance in controlling the outbreak and mobilizing resources. The declaration is expected to boost African production of diagnostic tools and ease import restrictions on medical supplies.\n“This declaration will increase coordination between Africa CDC and member states,” Kaseya said, adding it would accelerate research and development of diagnostics and vaccines.\nThe move coincides with the World Health Organization considering a similar global declaration. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Wednesday an emergency committee would be convened “as soon as possible” to advise on whether the outbreak represents a public health emergency of international concern.\n“In light of the spread of mpox outside DRC and the potential for further international spread within and outside Africa, I have decided to convene an emergency committee under the International Health Regulations,” Tedros said at a press briefing in Geneva.\nThis is a developing story.\nImage Credits: Africa CDC .",

Mientras, en la capital de Durango se registraron por segundo día consecutivo 2 grados centígrados bajo cero, y hasta menos 15 en la comunidad La Rosilla del municipio de Guanaceví, en la misma entidad.\nAutoridades de Delicias dieron a conocer que la noche del miércoles se reportó una conflagración en una vivienda y que luego de sofocar las llamas bomberos de esa demarcación de la zona centro sur del estado de Chihuahua hallaron los cadáveres de dos ancianos, que fueron trasladados al Servicio Médico Forense para precisar las causas de sus decesos a través de autopsias.\nLa Coordinación Estatal de Protección Civil chihuahuense adelantó que el descenso en el mercurio continuaría en la entidad al menos este viernes debido al frente frío número 14, por lo que pidió a la ciudadanía tomar precauciones para evitar incendios e intoxicaciones con monóxido de carbono por calentones defectuosos, e hipotermia por salir sin protección.\nEn Durango, los termómetros marcaron menos 9 grados Celsius en los municipios de San Bernardo y Nuevo Ideal; 8 bajo cero en Ocampo y Pueblo Nuevo, y menos 7 en la sierra del municipio de Durango. Sin embargo, no ha nevado por falta de humedad.\nSuspenden actividades\nEl ausentismo escolar en Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, fue de 55 por ciento, lo que se atribuyó al frío. César Bolaños, titular del Centro Regional de Desarrollo Educativo, comentó que los padres comprendieron la importancia de prevenir enfermedades respiratorias .\nEn tanto, el frente frío número 14 y las lluvias obligaron a suspender actividades artísticas y culturales en Centro Cultural Quinta Grijalva, en Villahermosa, Tabasco, anteriormente residencia oficial de los gobernadores.\nEl ayuntamiento informó que también se cancelaron las actividades del programa Nochebuena en Centro, en la Plaza de la Revolución.\nRubén Villalpando, Saúl Maldonado, Carlos Figueroa y René A.

    "title": "Prominent Jesuit: The Society Of Jesus Is In ‘Profound Decline’ – Analysis – Eurasia Review",
    "text": "By Walter Sánchez Silva\nFather Julio Fernández Techera, a Jesuit priest and rector of the Catholic University of Uruguay, has written a widely circulated, critical essay about the Society of Jesus warning that the order, founded by St. Ignatius of Loyola in 1534, is in “deep decline.”\nThe essay by the 57-year-old priest is titled “Ad Usum Nostrorum III” (“For Our Use III”) addressed to his Jesuit brothers. The document, which originally circulated within the Society of Jesus, was recently published by the Spanish journalist Francisco José Fernández de la Cigoña on his blog on Infovaticana .\nThis is the third document in a series that Fernández began in 2022 when he wrote his initial essay (“Ad Usum Nostrorum”), noting that for a long time he has felt dissatisfied with the situation in the Society of Jesus while making it clear that he is not going through a vocational crisis nor is he thinking about leaving.\nHe published the second essay a year later, in April 2023. In that text he expressed his appreciation for the many responses he received, also from young Jesuits, and even from some who didn’t agree with him but thanked him for the opportunity to debate and propose a revision of the order.\nThe third essay by Fernández is dated April 22. The new text has the subtitle “Some Considerations about the ‘De Statu Societatis 2023’ (‘On the State of the Society 2023’),” in reference to the general report produced by the superior general of the Society of Jesus, in this case the Venezuelan priest Arturo Sosa , in collaboration with the procurators (who assess the state of the order), who met in May of last year in Loyola, Spain.\nRecent sex abuse scandals “The society is experiencing very worrying situations that seem not to have been addressed in the Congregation of Procurators and that do not appear clearly and are not taken up in the ‘De Statu’ report. To give some examples, in December of 2022 we learned about what an Italian Jesuit called the ‘Rupnik Tsunami,’” Fernández noted in his essay.\nMarko Rupnik is a priest who was expelled from the Society of Jesus in 2023 — accused since 2018 of having committed serious sexual, spiritual, and psychological abuse against at least 20 women in the Loyola Community that he co-founded in Slovenia — and who continues to appear as a Jesuit and Vatican consultant in the 2024 Pontifical Yearbook.\nFernández then referred to the “scandal” of sexual abuse against minors “ committed by some Jesuits in Bolivia , and the alleged cover-up by several provincials who were accused by the prosecutor’s office of that country. We have had to find out about everything through the press and we have not received a single statement or letter from the General Curia explaining what happened or to ask for prayers for the province of Bolivia.”\nThe main Jesuit accused in this case is the late Alfonso Pedrajas, known as “Padre Pica,” who kept a diary about the sexual abuse he committed against more than 80 minors in Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador.\nA shrinking society Fernández pointed out in his most recent essay that “other urgent issues that were not dealt with clearly and forcefully are: the drop in the number of admissions to the society, which in the West worsens year by year, as well as the high number of members leaving the order.”\n“Recently a friend told me that 72 novices entered his province in the last 10 years. In the same period, the number of Jesuits who left the society in his province were 71,” he said, adding that “in 2023, 314 novices entered the entire society, and 319 died.”\nThe priest also noted that there are currently 13,995 Jesuits and lamented that “in a few years the society will have disappeared from several European countries and will become insignificant in others in Europe, America, and Oceania.” The only growth is in Africa. In 2013 , there were more than 17,200 Jesuits, which means that in just over 10 years, the Society of Jesus has decreased by more than 3,000 members.\nFor the Uruguayan priest, “the problem is not only that many die and few enter, but also that we do not know how to retain many of those who enter.”\n“The reason why we do not have vocations is not because of the secularized society, the changing times, and a thousand other excuses. The reason is that these conditions of our time have cowed us, they overwhelm us, and we do not know how to respond to today’s challenges with the drive and creativity of yesterday,” he pointed out.\nJesuits currently more akin to a ‘progressive NGO’ According to Fernández, the vision of the general report on the Society of Jesus “could perfectly be the view of the world of a secular think tank, with ties to a left-wing political party or a progressive NGO [nongovernmental organization].”\n“One does not find in that [evaluation] any of the supernatural or transcendent outlook that would be expected from a religious, apostolic, and priestly order,” he lamented.\n“There are many signs in the current life of Jesuit ministries, in the documents that are published and the guidelines that are given, that give the impression that we are in an NGO and not in a religious order,” Fernandez pointed out.\nIn ‘deep decline’ As Fernández sees it, the Society of Jesus “is in deep decline. It doesn’t know it, or it doesn’t want to know it, which is the same thing. It wants to believe that this is the situation of all the other realities of the Church that surround it and that therefore it is what it should be.”\nIn his opinion, the society’s leadership “fears that if it speaks clearly to the entire order, its members will suffer and become discouraged. The leaders “prefer to maintain the fiction that things are going well rather than risk recognizing the religious and apostolic decline of the society.”\nRegarding the Jesuits’ 2023 general report, Fernández pointed out that “in this entire long document of more than 24,000 words, the word ‘priest’ never appears and only twice ‘priesthood,’ although only to make a reference distinguishing between priesthood in the society and the diocesan priesthood.”\n“I think our attitude is suicidal: We want vocations for the priesthood in the society, but we don’t want to talk about being priests,” he pointed out.\nToward the end of the essay, Fernández recalls that the Jesuits “have a wonderful and necessary charism for the Church, a religious, apostolic, and priestly charism. We have to recover it and live it with passion, boldness, and generosity.”\n“To achieve this it is necessary to speak more freely, express clearly what we experience and think and stop being politically correct.”\nIn conclusion, Fernández expresses his prayer that God “would grant us in this time a living hope to believe that if we put ourselves in his hands and are faithful, we can still rise again and once again be a great service to his Church.”\nACI Prensa, CNA’s Spanish-language news partner, contacted the General Curia of the Jesuits in Rome to request its impressions of Fernandez’s essay. As of publication of this article, no response has been received.\nHistory of apostolic visits In a piece published in March 2022, the late Cardinal George Pell, under the pseudonym Demos , suggested conducting an apostolic visit or investigation into the Society of Jesus.\nThe early 1980s was the last time the Jesuits were investigated. At that time, Pope John Paul II personally intervened in the governance of the society, removing Father Pedro Arrupe from his position as superior general.\nThis story was first published by ACI Prensa, CNA’s Spanish-language news partner.
