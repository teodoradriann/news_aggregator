    "title": "Israel’s initial dismissal of US’ ‘breakthrough’ Lebanon ceasefire deal creates confusion | National Politics | koamnewsnow.com",
    "text": "(CNN) — Senior US officials were practically triumphant Wednesday night: The United States and a large number of its allies had nailed down a proposal after days of feverish talks that would put in place a ceasefire [across the Israel-Lebanon border.](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-lebanon-war-hezbollah-09-26-24-intl-hnk/index.html) In a hastily arranged call with reporters just moments after the release of a joint statement, top administration officials hailed the framework as “an important breakthrough.” The [21-day pause in fighting](https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/25/politics/us-plan-mediate-israel-hezbollah-ceasefire/index.html) that the nations were proposing would give time for diplomacy and could prevent a full-fledged war from breaking out between Israel and Hezbollah. Those officials were clear: The question was not if Israel and Hezbollah would accept the ceasefire proposal, but precisely when. Both Israel and Hezbollah were “familiar with the text,” one official said, and the US felt comfortable going public with the framework, with the understanding that both sides were ready to sign on. But only hours later, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [would throw cold water](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-lebanon-war-hezbollah-09-26-24-intl-hnk#cm1j3b24700003b6mc1wgg0w6) on the multi-national proposal. First, the prime minister’s office released a statement saying any reports of an imminent ceasefire was “incorrect” and that the IDF would continue fighting with “full force.” Then, the prime minister himself told the press as he got off his plane in New York City: “My policy, our policy, is clear: We continue to hit Hezbollah with all our might. We will not stop until we achieve all our goals.” Some 24 hours after the White House’s announcement of the ceasefire proposal, there has still been no indication that Israel and Hezbollah are ready to agree to it. Israel’s initial response was clearly not the reaction the White House had anticipated, and it raised immediate question of why, if Israel was on board with the proposal, its leader appeared so eager to dismiss it. “We are shocked,” said one US official, underscoring deep frustration after they had hoped Israel would accept the proposal. “Not a complete surprise, but also not helpful,” a second US official said. There were quiet rumblings in Washington that domestic politics could be at play for Netanyahu, as right-wing Israeli ministers – whom Netanyahu had depended upon to maintain his governing coalition – expressed indignation at reports of a US-backed ceasefire. One US source who suggested that the Israeli government was being swayed by the negative reaction to the proposal at home expressed frustration, saying the US would not have come out with such optimism had there not been strong private indications that the Israelis were prepared to accept the framework. The source said they did not expect negotiations to wrap up in the coming days, saying they expected the process to be long. And as long as Israel does not publicly accept it, they added, Hezbollah won’t feel pressure to either. American officials’ confidence in announcing the proposal on Wednesday had been derived, in part, because they were dealing with Ron Dermer, one of Netanyahu’s closest confidants, as they wrote and revised the statement’s text. Discussions on the ceasefire began with a conversation Monday between Dermer and Jake Sullivan, Biden’s national security adviser. The impression the US officials received was that Netanyahu would support a pause in fighting, and they were encouraged to work with French officials to complete a statement that urged a 21-day ceasefire. Speaking Thursday, French President Emmanuel Macron said it would be a “mistake” for Netanyahu to reject the ceasefire, but added the United States would need to increase pressure on Israel to accept its terms. Netanyahu’s apparent reversal amounted to a major disappointment, but for some officials it also underscored a reality that has existed for months: Netanyahu’s willingness to break publicly and openly with Biden, particularly when he faces internal political opposition in Israel. In a statement released Thursday night, the prime minister’s office said that “Israel shares the aims of the U.S.-led initiative of enabling people along our northern border to return safely and securely to their homes.” “Israel appreciates the US efforts,” the statement said, and promised that discussions would continue “in the coming days.” Meanwhile, White House officials had been left confronting a barrage of questions from reporters throughout the day on Thursday – and had no good answers. Asked about the apparent disconnect between the US and Israel, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the multi-nation statement was “indeed coordinated with the Israeli side.” Discussions between the negotiations parties in New York are “ongoing,” she continued, but failed to explain why Netanyahu and his office appeared wholly uninterested in agreeing to the temporary ceasefire. White House spokesman John Kirby was even more blunt in acknowledging that he had no good explanation for Netanyahu’s comments. “I can’t speak for Prime Minister Netanyahu, I can’t answer the question why he said what he said,” he told reporters. “What I can tell you is that statement we worked on last night wasn’t just drawn up in a vacuum,” Kirby added. “It was done after careful consultation, not only with the countries that signed on to it, but Israel itself.” Kirby even acknowledged that the plan would not have been released Wednesday night had the US not believed Netanyahu and his government was on board. For now, administration officials continue to insist that discussions are ongoing and expressed hope that news could come within hours. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with top Israeli officials in New York Thursday afternoon, even as many US officials were open to the possibility that Netanyahu may not get on board. Dermer and Israeli Ambassador Michael Herzog demurred when asked by CNN ahead of that meeting if they are going to accept the ceasefire proposal between Israel and Hezbollah. Dermer quipped that “less is more” when speaking as a diplomat, and pointed out that their day of meetings was only just getting started. This story has been updated with additional details.

    "text": "Rebels 3\nAmericans 1\nIt may have been Red Deer’s coldest day of the winter season so far but inside the Peavey Mart Centrium, the Rebels were scorching hot.\nThey defeated the visiting Tri-City Americans 3-1 for the Rebels’ third straight win in front of 3,422 fans.\n“I really appreciate the people who came out tonight. It’s the coldest day I’ve ever seen in my life,” said head coach Derrick Walser.\n“We played for 60 minutes and that was the challenge tonight. We wanted to play a complete game. We did a real good job with our puck placement… And I thought everyone contributed something tonight. It was real special.”\nThe Rebels were relentless in the offensive end outshooting the Tri-City by 30 shots 49-19.\n“I think sometimes when you’re struggling to score you try to walk the puck into the net. We talked about jamming it in and the first goal of the game was a great start from that line,” he said.\n“Birnie did something simple and got his goal. You have to learn to score ugly sometimes. It can’t always be pretty and that’s our main focus just trying to generate those shots.”\nThe Rebels scored two unanswered goals in the first period. The first came 29 seconds into the game when Carson Birnie scored on a wrap-around opportunity.\nForward Talon Brigley followed that up with less than two minutes left in the opening period when he crashed the net for a rebound.\nIn the second period, defenceman Elias Carmichael dropped the gloves with Cash Koch. The two traded punches but Carmichael delivered the knockout punch with a powerful left that ignited the crowd.\nJust a few minutes later the Americans notched their first of the game to cut into the Rebels lead off a one-timer from Deagen McMillan.\nHowever, with less than five minutes left in the frame defenceman Mats Lindgren hammered in his fifth of the season from the blue line to take a 3-1 lead on the powerplay.\nThat would be all the Rebels needed to secure the victory which was led by an 18-save performance by goaltender Chase Wutzke.\nLindgren said after the game that they never lifted their foot off the gas pedal.\n“I think we played great as a team, stuck to our systems, and what happened tonight is kind of what you get when we play our way,” he said.\n“Getting shots on net in high volumes was a big part of it and when you get pucks to the net like we did over there, good things happen. It’s a classic quote but it’s true. We focused on that and I think it worked.”\nThe Rebels return to the ice at the Peavey Mart Centrium on Saturday where they’ll take on the Edmonton Oil Kings at 7 p.m.",

    "text": "Israeli authorities say 68 people — 19 sick or wounded children plus their companions — have been allowed out of the Gaza Strip and into Egypt in the first medical evacuation since May, when the territory’s sole travel crossing was shut down after Israel captured it. COGAT, the Israeli military body responsible for Palestinian civilian affairs, said on Thursday that the evacuation was carried out in co-ordination with officials from the United States, Egypt and the international community. The children and their companions left the Gaza Strip via the Kerem Shalom crossing, and the patients were to travel to Egypt and further abroad for medical treatment. The nearly nine-month Israel-Hamas war has devastated Gaza’s health sector and forced most of its hospitals to shut down. Health officials say thousands of people need medical treatment abroad, including hundreds of urgent cases. Family members earlier bade a tearful goodbye to the children as they and their escorts left the Nasser Hospital in the southern Gaza town of Khan Younis bound for the Kerem Shalom cargo crossing with Israel. The Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt, the only one available for people to travel in or out, shut down after Israeli forces captured it during their operation in the city early last month. Egypt has refused to reopen its side of the crossing until the Gaza side is returned to Palestinian control. Six of the children were transferred to the Nasser Hospital from Al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City earlier this week. Five have malignant cases of cancer and one suffers from metabolic syndrome. That evacuation was organised by the World Health Organisation (WHO), which could not immediately be reached for comment. At a press conference at Nasser Hospital on Thursday, Dr Mohammed Zaqout, the head of Gaza’s hospitals, said the evacuation was being conducted in co-ordination with the WHO and three American charities. Dr Zaqout said more than 25,000 patients in Gaza require treatment abroad, including some 980 children with cancer, a quarter of whom need “urgent and immediate evacuation”. He said the cases included in Thursday’s evacuation are “a drop in the ocean” and that the complicated route through Kerem Shalom and into Egypt cannot serve as an alternative to the Rafah crossing. In a post on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter, the WHO regional director for the Eastern Mediterranean, Hanan Balkhy, welcomed news of the children’s evacuation, but noted that “more than 10,000 patients still require medical care outside the Strip. Of the 13,872 people who have applied for medical evacuation since October 7, only 35% have been evacuated”. “Medical evacuation corridors must be urgently established for the sustained, organised, safe, and timely passage of critically ill patients from Gaza via all possible routes,” she said. Israel’s offensive against Hamas, which runs the Gaza Strip, has killed over 37,700 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between civilians and fighters in its count. Thousands of women and children are among the dead. The war began with Hamas’ surprise attack into Israel on October 7, in which militants killed some 1,200 people and took another 250 hostage.",
