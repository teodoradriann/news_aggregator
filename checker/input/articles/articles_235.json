    "text": "WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden on Thursday said he is \"determined\" and \"fit\" to seek his re-election against his Republican rival Donald Trump and a \"stupid mistake\" by him will not change his course as he has work to finish.\nResponding to questions during a press conference at the conclusion of the NATO Summit, Biden said that no poll or person is telling him that he can't win reelection currently.\nThat is the only way he would consider ending his presidential bid.\n\"I'm determined on running,\" he said.\n\"The fact is that the consideration is that I think I'm the most qualified person to run for president. I beat him (Trump) once and I will beat him again. Secondly.. The idea that senators and congressmen are running for office worrying about the ticket is not unusual and I might add, there were at least five presidents running or incumbent presidents who had lower numbers than I have now later in a campaign,\" Biden said.\n\"So there's a long way to go in this campaign and so I'm just going to keep moving, keep moving,\" he said.\n\"And because look, I got more work to do. We've got more work to finish. We made so much progress. Think about where we are economically relative to the rest of the world. Name me a world leader who wouldn't want to trade places with our economy. We created over 800,000 manufacturing jobs, so things are moving. We've got more to go,\" the president said.\n\"Working class people still need help. Corporate greed is still at large. Corporate profits have doubled since the pandemic. They're coming down and so I'm optimistic about where things are going,\" he asserted.\nBiden added that he is seeking his re-election not for his legacy.\n\"I'm in this to complete the job I started. As you recall, understandably, many of you and many economists thought my initial initiatives that I put forward can't do that because it's going to cause inflation. Things are going to skyrocket. The debt's going to go up. What are you hearing now from mainstream economists?\"\n\"Sixteen economic Nobel laureates said I've done a hell of a job, that under my plan so far and what's going to happen in the future, if I'm reelected, that things are going to get much better. Our economy is growing. I was determined when I got elected to stop the trickle down economic theory that if the wealthy did very well, everybody else would do well,\" the president said.\n\"I'm not anti-corporate, but corporate profits have doubled since the pandemic, doubled. It's time things get back in order a little bit. It's time. For example, if I'm reelected, we're going to make sure that rents are kept at a five percent increase of corporate rents for apartments and the like and homes are limited to five percent,\" he said.\nBiden refuted reports that he told his aides that he needed to go to bed earlier and end meetings around eight in the evening.\n\"That's not true what I said was, instead of my every day starting at seven and going to bed at midnight, it'd be smarter for me to pace myself a little more. And I said, for example, the 8:00, 7:00, 6:00 stuff, instead of starting the fundraiser at 9:00, start at 8:00. People get to go home by 10:00. That's what I'm talking about,\" he said.\nWhen asked about what changed his mind when in 2020 he said that he would be the bridge candidacy for a younger, fresher generation of Democratic leaders, Biden said: \"What changed was the gravity of the situation I inherited in terms of the economy, our foreign policy and domestic division.",

    "text": "Bloomberg Bond Investors Are Lining Up to Fund the War Against Putin Read full article Sujata Rao and Aline Oyamada March 10, 2024 at 10:30 AM · 5 min read Bond Investors Are Lining Up to Fund the War Against Putin\n(Bloomberg) -- Bond investors are urging squabbling European Union leaders to get their act together on defense spending and make the bloc’s trillion-euro bond program permanent.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nThese Are the Best Countries for Wealthy Expats\nBillions Pour Into Nigeria as Tinubu’s Reforms Start to Pay Off\nIs Now the Right Time to Invest in Bitcoin?\nThe $1 Trillion Race to Rebuild Ukraine Is Slowly Getting Going\nUnited Plane Veers Off Runway in Third Boeing Mishap of Week\nThat means demand won’t number among the challenges faced by EU politicians at loggerheads over whether to boost shared military capabilities by issuing joint bonds. Fund managers starved of AAA-rated securities say they’re clamoring for more European issuance.\nInvestors point out that these instruments would enable the spending boost that is becoming ever more imperative to counter Russian belligerence, but without loading more debt onto individual member states. And there is also something in it for them, since EU bonds pay a premium over similarly rated sovereigns.\n“Investors are thirsty for these bonds,” said Brian Mangwiro, a portfolio manager at Barings who owns EU debt.\nThe solution of a bloc-wide debt program is starting to be taken seriously in some capitals as European security officials warn that Vladimir Putin could move on to target their territory if he secures victory in Ukraine, while a decades-long shortfall in military spending leaves the continent dangerously unprepared.\nShared borrowing was described by EU Economy Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni last month as “a sound way” to deal with crises. The plan’s being championed by countries whose defense industries would be well-placed to benefit — like France — and countries whose proximity to Russia sharpens their sense of the threats — like Estonia — although it faces opposition from Europe’s more fiscally conservative states.\nOne reason investors are urging the holdouts to overcome these reservations is that AAA-rated paper is highly prized — and even more so since the US was stripped of its top-tier rating last year. An added bonus: for reasons that include the temporary nature of the issuance, existing EU bonds pay investors slightly higher yields than equally-rated Germany, and even than lower-rated France.\nStory continues Bond-buyer enthusiasm is evident at virtually every sale. Last month, a €3 billion ($3.3 billion) EU bond received €81 billion in orders — at 27 times, that was the highest cover ratio ever recorded in Europe’s publicly syndicated debt market, according to data analyzed by Bloomberg. Even back in October 2020, the EU’s first joint issuance since the landmark pandemic bond deal recorded a €233 billion order book, the largest for any single deal in bond-market history.\nThe EU already has some €450 billion outstanding in bonds, mostly issued to finance the pandemic recovery fund. That program will cease to issue new bonds after 2026 but conviction is growing among investors that the EU bond issuance should become permanent.\nThat’s precisely what’s making some fiscally conservative countries skeptical. Many are opposed to anything that isn’t framed as a one-off. That was the rationale that triumphed during the pandemic when an acute crisis forced Germany and other wealthier EU states softened their habitual opposition to pooled borrowing.\nInvestors know much will depend on what happens on the Ukrainian battlefield in the weeks ahead, and are watching for whether the advance of Russian tanks toward the EU’s eastern border forces a wake-up call. “Unfortunately it always takes a crisis in Europe to make much traction,” said Guy Miller, head of market strategy at Zurich Insurance Co.\nGermany and the Netherlands have rejected suggestions for a joint instrument to fund defense, and so far the increases in defense spending undertaken since Russian invaded Ukraine two years ago have been largely left up to member states themselves. That push has not without controversy, both domestically, and as EU members argue among themselves about who is — and isn’t — doing enough.\nEarlier this week the commission allocated €1.5 billion from additional EU budget funds by way of joint spending, but that won’t get close to funding the step-change needed to repel Vladimir Putin from Ukraine — still less, to gear up for a putative attack on European soil in years ahead. EU industry commissioner Thierry Breton has urged the bloc to consider spending €100 billion.\nSuperior Returns\nThe irony of any new, joint defense issuance would be that the very thing attracting investors to EU debt — its yield premium — may moderate slightly, were they to initiate a larger, joint-funding plan. The temporary nature of the Covid relief program is one reason why they ask for higher returns to buy the notes.\nBut that may constitute yet another advantage for the bloc. EU bonds due 2034 trade with a 2.9% yield, while German notes maturing the same year pay less than 2.2%, and French 2033 securities yield 2.7%. That means at current bond prices the EU would incur an additional annual interest cost of about €7 million per €1 billion compared to Germany.\nEU issuance would also reduce the need for individual sovereigns to raise borrowing. That’s crucial, given that interest payments already surpass defense spending in seven European NATO countries, according to Germany’s Ifo Institute. In highly indebted Italy, interest costs are three times annual military expenditure.\n“The beauty of EU bonds is that the debt doesn’t appear in your national statistics, it doesn’t count toward Maastricht or the debt brake or anything like that,” said Moritz Kraemer, chief economist at German bank LBBW. “So in principle, you can get funding for whatever you think you need without having to incur the penalty.”\nMaastricht refers to a bloc-wide treaty that seeks to limit budget deficits to 3% of GDP, while the debt brake is a borrowing cap enshrined in Germany’s constitution.\nA debt-funded EU defense program “would be a very welcome development — an Hamiltonian moment so to say,” said Kaspar Hense, a senior portfolio manager at RBC BlueBay Asset Management, referring to the Treasury secretary who in 1790 helped turn the US into a federation by pooling the debt of various states. “I would not worry about there not being demand.”\n--With assistance from Paul Cohen, Lyubov Pronina, Ben Sills and Max Ramsay.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow Apple Sank About $1 Billion a Year Into a Car It Never Built\nThe Battle to Unseat the Aeron, the World’s Most Coveted Office Chair\nHow Microsoft’s Bing Helps Maintain Beijing’s Great Firewall\nAirbus Is Soaring at Boeing’s Expense\nElon Musk Is Right About OpenAI But for the Wrong Reasons\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\nTRENDING 1.

    "text": "Why teachers in Grand Rapids are leaving – and what it means for students\nFor years now, Michigan’s public schools have been grappling with a persistent teacher shortage and lower-than-national-average funding.\nThe numbers tell a difficult story: Michigan’s education workforce has grown over the past three years – but teacher shortages still persist across many parts of the state, particularly in special education.\nThat’s despite the state spending hundreds of millions of dollars on a wide range of efforts to train new teachers and keep them on staff, including apprenticeships, mentorship and recognition programs, and research into the teacher workforce.\nGrand Rapids Public Schools, one of West Michigan’s largest school districts, is feeling the strain. The district – once home to the best high school in the state as ranked by one publication – is now struggling to hire and retain teachers like elementary school teacher Malori Salamango.\nWhen she spoke at a recent school board meeting, it had been just under five months since Salamango, a second-year teacher, last stood before the Grand Rapids Public Schools Board of Education.\n“I spoke in January when my caseload was at 21, which is one over the limit. After that meeting, I was fact-checked, not given adequate support,” she told the school board at a meeting in May.\nSince then, she said, things had only gotten worse. Her caseload has continued to grow, and she’s been working more than 60 hours a week just to keep up.\n“That's how you lose teachers like the resource teacher before me, and that is why I am resigning from my position,” she announced, the crowd groaning as they heard the news.\nSalamango has spent the last two years working at GRPS’ Southwest Elementary School - Academia Bilingüe, a dual immersion school in English and Spanish. As a special education teacher, she works with students with disabilities from kindergarten through fourth grade. Her job is to update and keep track of each student’s Individualized Education Program (IEP).\nIn the classroom this could mean pulling out a student for specialized instruction for a number of minutes per week.\n“I have some students that have a really low amount of of minutes, like 30 to 60 minutes a week, and then I have some that are all the way to 376 minutes per week, and legally I have to be meeting those minutes every single week as much as I can,” Salamango told Michigan Public in an interview.\nAn IEP outlines the educational goals and services to which each student is entitled, according to federal guidelines.\nSalamango said she’s not supposed to have a caseload of more than 20 students, but this year her school lost its only other resource teacher, and she had to take on additional students.\nSalamango isn't alone in facing these challenges. The teacher shortage has persisted across Grand Rapids Public Schools since 2020 when the district’s daily substitute rate surged from 1.8% to 18.6%.\nState data reveals the scope of the problem. In the 2023-24 school year, GRPS employed 866 full-time teachers — a 10-year low for the district.\nNow, GRPS officials say, more than 90 teaching positions remain unfilled across the district. To keep classrooms running, the district has turned to stopgap measures, relying on long-term substitute teachers and, in some cases, remote instruction delivered via video conference.\nSome critics point to the district’s teacher salaries as a driving factor behind the ongoing shortages.\n“If you look at the career earnings of a teacher in Grand Rapids Public Schools, it pales in comparison to other districts,” said Matt Marlowe, president of the Grand Rapids Education Association, the union representing teachers at GRPS.\nOver half of Grand Rapids' full-time teaching staff have 10 or fewer years of experience. Data from the union shows the median salary for those teachers was under $50,000 last school year. A report from Michigan State University found schools are relying on new teachers more, but those new teachers are also more likely to leave the profession.\nThe highest salaries in the district are just under $88,000, but the majority of teachers anywhere near that salary level have decades of experience and masters degrees. The union wants the district to increase salaries by shifting funds from executive positions to teachers.\n“The district spends less than half of their money on instruction, which is very unusual, and about half of their employees are non-instruction, not counting administration,” said Marlowe.\nHigh salaries for district leaders have long been a point of contention. State data show the district’s superintendent and other top officials each made an average of over $200,000 in 2024. The district’s best-paid teacher received less than half of that.\nOver the past year, the union has been pressing the district to raise teacher salaries by 7.5% before the teachers’ contract expires at the end of the month.\n“We are working to rectify through our negotiations with the union and we greatly appreciate what our teachers are doing every day inside of our schools and we are working to improve upon that,” Luke Stier, director of communications and community liaison at Grand Rapids Public Schools.\nStier pointed out that teachers already received a raise at the start of the school year and that the district has offered to make it retroactive — bringing the total pay increase to roughly 3%.\nThis last school year the district has been operating with a shortfall of millions dollars caused in part by the cuts to COVID-19 emergency relief funds from the federal government.\n“We’re projecting that our general fund balance will have gone from $40 million last year to about $28 million this year,” Stier added.\nTo make up for the deficit, the 2025-2026 school year budget includes a salary freeze for district leaders for the immediate future, along with the removal of at least nine existing positions including two executive director roles. Union and district officials have not confirmed what percentage of the funds budgeted for instructional expenditures would go toward teacher salary raises.\nThe salary concerns at GRPS reflect a statewide pattern. Michigan's struggles with teacher compensation aren't new — during the 2021-2022 school year, the state offered the lowest average starting salary for teachers among all Great Lakes states.\nSome economics and education experts trace this back to 2002, when the state made significant cuts to public education funding that continue to reverberate today.\n“It was the sharpest decline in education funding of any state and it lasted for 15 years,” said David Arsen, professor emeritus and researcher at MSU College of Education.\nArsen has spent the last several decades analyzing the state’s school budget and its impact.\nA 2019 report from Michigan State University on the state’s school funding found that the total K-12 education funding declined by 30% between 2002 and 2015. About three-quarters of that drop was due to declining state support for schools. During that same period, per-pupil revenue declined by 22%.\nThat drop happened as the proportion of students requiring extra help rose.\n“We did a very poor job of adjusting the revenues, matching the revenues that districts received for the differences in costs of educating special education, children from poverty, and English-language learners,” Arsen added.\nAs demographics in the state have changed, its budget priorities haven’t. In fact, Michigan ranks dead last among states in total education revenue growth.\n“This represents a decline of over $1 billion annually in state revenues for K-12 education between 1995 and 2015,” Arsen said.\nEven though state funding has risen slightly in recent years, Arsen said it still hasn’t made up for lost ground. Meanwhile, Michigan students continue to score below the national average, especially in reading.\nThese consequences have been especially apparent in Grand Rapids, Arsen said, where state data show more than 75% of kids are economically disadvantaged.\nTo help fix this, some advocates are backing a ballot initiative that would add an additional 5% income tax rate on earnings above $500,000 for individuals or $1 million for couples filing jointly, and direct that money to schools..\nThe State Board of Canvassers will decide this week whether the group behind [Invest in MI Kids](https://www.michigan.gov/sos/-/media/Project/Websites/sos/BSC-Announcements/Announcement-Summary-Language--Petition--Invest-in-MI-Kids.pdf?rev=8b56ac3b52ec4bdfaf07fd776dd120ca&hash=40AD14472063D12E55B60C3D3772AD55) can begin to collect signatures.\nSome [critics](https://www.michamber.com/news/massive-tax-hike-being-pushed-via-ballot-initiative/) argue the proposal could hurt small business owners and keep some people from wanting to stay in or move to Michigan.\nBut for some Grand Rapids Public School teachers, it could be an incentive to stay.\nFor teachers like Malori Salamango, however, that solution would come a little too late.\n“I moved here for this job. That's not a light commitment so I would have liked to stay, but I need to put myself first,” she said.\nSalamango is not giving up on her lifelong dream of being a teacher, and plans to continue helping kids learn how to read. But this time, she won't be with the school district.",

    "text": "She was the founding mastermind behind provocative lingerie chain Honey Birdette, but after selling the brand in 2021, Eloise Monaghan says she is “devastated” that her life’s work has been destroyed.\nDespite pocketing $66 million from the $443 million sale to PLBY, the leisure and entertainment company behind Playboy magazine, the outspoken businesswoman says the downfall of her former brand has been like a death.\n“It’s been devastating to watch,” she told Daily Mail Australia.\n‘I built the brand on female empowerment – it wasn’t about fake boobs or fake asses, that’s all it is now.’\nThe US-based company bought Honey Birdette in 2021, with the 48-year-old former founder staying on as creative director of the brand she had honed for more than a decade. Within eight months, however, everything fell apart.\n“I came into an industry that wasn’t ready for women’s clothing or anything ridiculously empowering,” she said.\n“I felt like I was wearing a muzzle, so I just stopped.”\nAfter his release, his life took a 180-degree turn. He quietly divorced his ex-wife Natalie, lives full-time in Los Angeles and is in love with Australian designer and photographer Rebecca Collinson-Smith.\nEloise Monaghan is the mastermind behind Honey Birdette, the edgy Brisbane-based company she founded in 2006 after visiting her first adult toy store while shopping for a hen party.\nHoney Birdette is no longer about female empowerment, says founder Eloise Monoghan\nThe couple have since joined forces in love and business, expanding Collinson-Smith’s swim and resort brand, Hunting Hue, into the U.S. market.\n“We were friends before we were together,” says Collinson-Smith, 37.\n“Now I can’t imagine doing this without her. We challenge each other but we’re good partners because we listen to each other.”\nDriven by a passion to empower women, Eloise’s journey with Hunting Hue represents more than just a business venture, but redefining the industry.\n“Having witnessed numerous takeovers, including my own, by male corporate figures who don’t understand the essence of female empowerment brands, I feel driven to preserve our message at Hunting Hue,” Monoghan said.\n‘We proudly operate as a fully female-owned and operated company and intend to remain that way. I am thrilled to re-enter the retail space and partner with my life and business partner.’\nIn June, the couple captivated the American fashion industry with their latest show at Paraiso’s Miami Swim Week, ushering in a new era in swimwear: a canvas for artistic expression, a testament to love and a commitment to timeless allure.\nThe swimwear collection featured stunning aerial images of Sydney’s famous beaches.\nTo capture stunning images, Collinson-Smith hired a helicopter and photographed iconic Sydney landmarks including the Harbour Bridge, Bondi Beach and the Opera House from 500 feet up.\nLooking ahead, the brand is preparing for a major expansion into the U.S. market in 2025, with plans to establish a physical presence in Los Angeles, New York, Miami and Texas.\nRebecca Collinson-Smith (pictured left) and her partner in business and love Eloise Monoghan (right)\nCouples resortwear brand Hunting Hue was a hit at Paraiso’s Miami Swim Week last month.\n“Having witnessed numerous takeovers, including my own, by male corporate figures who don’t understand the essence of female empowerment brands, I feel motivated to preserve our message at Hunting Hue,” said Eloise Monoghan.\nHunting Hue proudly operates as a fully female-owned and operated business.\n“Americans love anything ‘made in Australia’, so it’s a really exciting time for the brand to have a strong presence in the US market,” Collinson-Smith said.\nWhile its store at The Rocks will remain an iconic shopping destination loved by tourists who love Australia, its culture and iconic landmarks such as the Opera House and Bondi Beach.\nAway from fashion, the couple say they hope to continue travelling the world before settling down and have recently taken steps to expand their family.\n“We are currently considering IVF and could ultimately live in Greece,” Monaghan said.\n“We love the States, but our families are in Australia, so it’s important for us to get back home, although we certainly see ourselves travelling and continuing to be inspired,” Collinson-Smith added.",

You won’t make that up later in the season, even if we get amazing snowfall in January, February, March.”\nApex on Thursday had about a third of its roughly 79 runs open, a stark contrast from 2022 when every run was open in the first week of December thanks to heavy snowfalls.\nShalman said Apex had significant snow-making capacity and used it to combat the lack of precipitation, but there were weeks this month where the temperatures were too warm to make snow.\n“I mean, we are essentially snow farmers,” he says. “We’re Mother Nature-dependent, and we just have to take what we get.”\nAt Cypress Mountain in West Vancouver, management warned skiers of “thin snow coverage” for what little of the hill was open.\nSeveral resorts have been offering discounted passes and tickets to entice skiers to visit.\n“Rain’s the star of the show today,” Cypress Mountain’s update on Thursday said, noting that night skiing had been cancelled.\nEnvironment Canada meteorologist Brian Proctor said that in addition to El Niño, a ridge of high pressure had created a “blocking pattern” across much of North America. That was preventing the warm air generated by El Niño from passing over mountains and continuing inland.\nProctor said it meant the warm air mass had lingered over B.C., unable to go east due to high pressure acting like “a wall.”\nHe said Environment Canada’s long-term forecast called for more seasonal temperatures to return for the first week of January, bringing potential snowfall to higher elevations in the Interior.\nBut Proctor said snowfall was less certain for coastal areas in coming weeks, adding that skiers and resorts should temper expectations.\n“We may see potential for some snowfall,” Proctor says. “But really longer term it does look like an El Niño winter at this point in time, continuing and remaining fairly significant into the early spring.”\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 29, 2023.",
