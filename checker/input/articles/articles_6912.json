    "title": "Super Bowl Matchup Getting Spicy: All-Pro 49ers D-Lineman Nick Bosa Throws Major Shade At Chiefs Offensive Line | The Daily Caller",
    "text": "The NFL’s reigning defensive player of the year Nick Bosa just threw major shade at the Chiefs’ offensive linemen, claiming “they hold a lot.”\nBosa was prompted to call out Chiefs tackles Donovan Smith and Jawaan Taylor when a reporter asked him if anything stood out about them. He, naturally, replied with the biting accusation.\nBosa , arguably the best defensive lineman in the NFL, has a point. The Chiefs were second in the league in offensive holdings this season with 21, just one behind the league-leading New York Jets, according to the Football Database.\n#49ers DE Nick Bosa on Chiefs LT Donovan Smith and RT Jawaan Taylor:\n“They hold a lot.” pic.twitter.com/S05D0hLuMk\n— Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate) February 1, 2024\nTaylor himself has been a massive penalty liability, guilty of a league-leading 23 yellow flags this season including playoffs, according to NFLPenalties.com. His competition? Fellow Kansas City Chief L’Jarius Sneed. The shutdown corner is in a distant second with 17 of his own penalties, according to NFL Penalties.\nBosa’s rage wasn’t confined to just current Chiefs either. Former Chief lineman Eric Fisher caught a ricochet shot when reporters asked Bosa if he was held on the last play of Super Bowl LIV, which the Chiefs won over San Francisco 31-20. (RELATED: Ravens Tight End Mark Andrews Saves Woman’s Life On Flight)\n“Were you held on the last play?” a reporter asked.\n“I don’t think they had the back view, but yeah I’m sure… Eric Fisher,” Bosa replied.\nDamn! Poor Fisher catching strays from his couch.\nI do love this type of banter though. Make it real. Convince me you literally hate your opponent. It’s all for a good show and I’m here for it.",

    "title": "'Starter homes' cost at least $1 million in over 200 U.S. cities, Zillow data finds",
    "text": "log in or registerto comment.\nWell… define starter home. I got a starter for about half that in LA but I have a shared wall townhome. Not great, but if we’re talking no shared walls and a yard, ya I can see that costing more… Except I also saw those for about this price, only with like… 600sq ft? Pick you battles, but those aren’t a million even in the city.\nNow, maybe the 200 cities are specific neighborhoods, like how Santa Monica isn’t technically Los Angeles since it’s got it’s own city government. Same with Beverly Hills, Bel Air, etc. You sure as hell ain’t getting a place for 1 mil there, even if it’s a small “starter home.”\nAll of your question are answered right at the beginning of the article:\n“Zillow defines “cities” as distinct housing markets, which can include large suburbs, towns or boroughs within major metro areas. “Starter homes” are defined as properties in the bottom third of home values within a given market. That means these aren’t luxury listings — they’re the least expensive homes available in each city.”\nZillow is a part of the problem. With all the data collected and only a few companies, prices are conveniently increasing at extreme rates. It is not just cities; land and rural areas are increasing at high rates.\nThe real issue is the commodification of housing. Houses shouldn’t make people money; they are supposed to be homes to live in.\nThis! We have the means to provide housing for everyone but don’t because, fuck you thats why.\nSpeaking of which, zillow’s stupid “zestimate” is worthless. Any assclown can put their house up for way too high a price and the zestimate will automatically jump up to match.\nApparently the value is whatever the seller says it is, even if the home has been on the market for over a year (either continuously or repeatedly taken off and put on, I guess to reset the time on market).\nGet off your ass and get 50+ full time jobs you lazy fucks!\nIf I keep paying the current $1200 a month to my landlord it’ll eventually trickle down to me. No doubt!\nThen with that revenue, I’ll buy my first house!\nIn reality, I’m almost 28 and I have no delusions about home ownership. Just like retirement!\nOnly 1200 a month?\nGod I wish.\nThat’s the going rate for renting a room in someone’s house in my neck of the woods.\nAnd stop earning avocados.\nStop eating avocados. Start eating landlords.\nTough to stomach at first, but very good for you and the community.\nGuess it’s a nonstarter.\nA starter home?! This home is a finisher home! A shelterer of gods! The GOLDEN GOD!\nI am untethered, and my rage knows no bounds!\nYou rang?\n* curb your enthusiasm theme plays *\nThis…is hard to believe. I’ve been looking around non-major US cities, and even some major cities, and the starter homes are around 200-500k.\nThat’s still fucked for a starter home but a million??? That’s the average home price in Honolulu and NYC lol.\ni was going to say its avg in the west coast blue area. 200-500k is “cheap”\nIt literally sounds super fake.\nI can’t find a single major city without 200k to 350k homes lol\nIt takes like 30 seconds to check what starter homes cost in any city, yet people will believe this shit instead of just go look.\nEdit: this is the “source”\nhttps://www.zillow.com/research/million-dollar-start-home-2025-35100/Just 1 chart with literally zero further info, no published actual data of where these numbers came from, how they calculated them, how they gathered the data.\nWhy do people fall for empty garbage articles like this so easy. I wish we collectively called this out more.\nIf a person posts an article citing another article, instead of just the original article, they should get fuckin blasted for it and downvoted to hell.\nPost. Original. Sources.\nI quite kiterally cant find anything in my city for less than 900k, and they are rare\nWhat city\nDoesn’t sound super fake if you are looking for a place with what I think are pretty reasonable basic characteristics of comfort and security.\nHouse that can accommodate a small family not in a higher than average crime area, does not require fix up maintenance that those of us working long hours will never have time to do or can’t afford to have done, has been well cared for and doesn’t feel gross. I’m not talking luxury homes here, I’m just talking about something that you would at least look forward to coming home to.\nWhen I see all these people buying these homes, I’m just shocked at how they have either accrued so much wealth or are so comfortable with so much debt.\nIt’s pretty tough out there right now.\n“When I eliminate all the homes that normal people would classify as a starter home, I can’t find any starter homes!”\n“Wait to buy a starter homes you are telling me I can’t live in a rich gentrified white neighborhood, I might have a black guy for a neighbour? That just won’t do!”\n“Sorry anything not within 5 blocks of a Starbucks can’t possibly count as a starter home”\nThis is what people sound like when they talk about “safety” and “crime rates” and “starter homes” in the same sentence.\nTry looking in San Francisco, or any city in the entire Bay Area. You won’t find a 500sq ft shack for less than $800k.\n3 seconds of looking and I found five houses under 500k. Two of them genuinely look pretty decent too tbh, not even rough looking homes.\nAs someone who has lived in and priced out homes in major US cities, I find this article to be accurate.\n(X) Doubt\nUpdated 1400 sf 3 bed 1 bath $1M where I live.\nAnd you wonder why the young folk vote for conservatives…\n1 they don’t 2 why would thismake them?\nJust don’t live in a city geez\nEdit: Yes, my quest for downvotes is successful.\nI aim to be karma neutral on the fediverse and had a pretty good day I need to counteract.\nA couple years ago this was the “just don’t live in California” argument.\njust don’t live\n^This guy gets it\nPeople take this advice, move to a lower COL area and rise the COL.\nPeople that handed the advice now complains that they can’t afford to live in their not-so-low-COL-anymore area\nThat’s where the jobs are.\nNot much for good paying work in podunk towns.\nJust commute for an hour to work every day. Ew, no, we don’t want to fund buses, that’s for poors. Pay for it yourself.\nEw, commuting. Just WFH\nYou want a WFH plumber? Cause I don’t.\nI know you’re trolling, but you could at least write some funny ones\nIt’s a dry humor\nDesiccated, even\nYou get me.\ndeleted by creator\nAt which point, Id have to spend the money saved on housing on buying, fueling, maintaining and insuring a car, if I was even able to drive one in the first place.\nJust work from home, jeez\nSure thing, just need to find a jedi to teach me the force so that I can move and assemble the parts in the factory without actually being there.\nGotta work from home, but keep your mailing address somewhere expensive like Seattle. The pay is higher if you ‘live’ somewhere expensive for some reason. I guess you work better if you live somewhere expensive.",

Um município do Paraná, no sul do Brasil, está mostrando que esse recurso é viável. Crédito: pixabay A cidade de Toledo, no oeste do Paraná, está produzindo energia elétrica a partir do biogás gerado pelas fezes de porco. Crédito: stevepb - pixabay O biogás é uma forma de aproveitamento da biomassa, que é uma matéria orgânica utilizada como fonte de energia renovável e sustentável. Crédito: Arianza1 wikimedia commons A unidade de Toledo consegue gerar energia suficiente para abastecer 1,5 mil casas populares. Crédito: Divulgação / Central de Biogás de Toledo (CBT) A matéria prima vem de 15 produtores da região que possuem 41 mil suínos. Crédito: Divulgação / Central de Biogás de Toledo (CBT) Os animais produzem diariamente cerca de 340 metros cúbicos de estrume. Isso basicamente equivale a 340 caixas d'água de mil litros. Crédito: Divulgação / Central de Biogás de Toledo (CBT) Para transformar o estrume em energia são utilizados biodigestores, que são estruturas de concreto revestidas com lona plástica resistente. Crédito: Freepik Rafael González, presidente do Centro Internacional de Energias Renováveis (CIbiogás), explicou ao G1 como ocorre o processo. Crédito: Reprodução de vídeo / G1 Os dejetos ficam nos biodigestores por 30 dias. Com pouco oxigênio no ambiente fechado, as bactérias comem parte do material orgânico do estrume, liberando um gás rico em metano. Crédito: Divulgação / CIBiogás Em seguida, esse gás (o Biogás) é convertido em energia elétrica a partir de um motor gerador. Crédito: Divulgação / Central de Biogás de Toledo (CBT) Essa alternativa contribui consideravelmente para o planeta. Isso porque há uma redução da emissão de gases que agravam o efeito estufa e que são liberados pelas fezes dos animais. Crédito: Divulgação / Central de Biogás de Toledo (CBT) A unidade de Toledo é capaz de diminuir a emissão de até 10 mil toneladas de gás carbônico por ano, segundo o CIBiogás. Crédito: Divulgação / Central de Biogás de Toledo (CBT) Com baixo custo e com grande quantidade, a biomassa pode ser obtida no bagaço de cana, resíduos agrícolas e no dejeto de animais. Crédito: Reprodução/TV Clube O Paraná como um todo é um grande aproveitador do biogás. E tem grande potencial a partir dos dejetos gerados pela pecuária, suinocultura ou avicultura, já que é um grande produto nesses segmentos. Crédito: Divulgação / Central de Biogás de Toledo (CBT) Essa forma de energia é muito importante para o Brasil. Dados do Minstério de Minas e Energia apontam que, em 2022, 31,4% da energia necessária para atender o país foram referentes à biomassa. Crédito: reprodução tv globo O volume de biogás deve aumentar 15 vezes até 2030 no Brasil, segundo projeção da Associação Brasileira de Biogás (Abiogás). Crédito: Freepik A Abiogás aponta que o Brasil tem potencial para produzir 100 milhões de metros cúbicos do produto diariamente. Crédito: Divulgação / Abiogás O Biogás ainda pode ser combustível para veículos e substituir a lenha no setor agroindustrial. E ele pode ser refinado, assim como o gás natural fóssil. Crédito: Divulgação JAC Motors Brasil Além disso, o Biogás tem um potencial ambiental enorme. Por exemplo, os esgotos das cidades podem virar energia com a ajuda dos biodigestores.

    "title": "Taiwán Fahui | Falun Dafa me salvó cuando mi situación era desesperada | Falun Dafa - Minghui.org",
    "text": "(Minghui.org) ¡Saludos estimado Shifu y compañeros practicantes! Antes de comenzar a practicar Falun Dafa hace catorce meses, los médicos dijeron que sólo me quedaban dos meses de vida. Me gustaría contarles cómo pasé de las profundidades de la desesperación a obtener una nueva oportunidad de vida. El deseo de cultivarse Como resultado de la epidemia de COVID-19, mi lugar de trabajo suspendió todas las actividades laborales presenciales. Pasé la mayor parte del tiempo navegando por internet en casa. En mayo de 2022 encontré información que hablaba de la inmortalidad del alma. Me sentí inspirado y sentí un fuerte deseo de cultivarme; busqué en todas partes en línea, pero no pude encontrar un método de cultivación creíble. Solía sufrir de cálculos renales, lo que requería una administración regular de litotricia por ondas de choque en el hospital para descomponerlos. A finales de julio de 2022, visité el hospital para recibir tratamiento. La enfermera me dijo: “Esta vez las piedras se rompieron en pedazos mucho más pequeños. Deberías poder eliminarlos de tu cuerpo rápidamente”. Curiosamente, las piezas no se descargaron. Tres días después, a las 4 de la mañana, ingresé en el hospital por un dolor abdominal intenso y se consideró necesaria una cirugía para eliminar los cálculos residuales. Como requería anestesia general, el hospital realizó una radiografía de tórax de precaución. Después de que el médico miró mis radiografías, preguntó: \"¿Sabías que tienes un tumor grande en el pecho?\". La información me golpeó como un rayo. Según el director del hospital, las tomografías computarizadas determinaron que el tumor era masivo y me instó a buscar tratamiento rápidamente. Recomendó a dos reconocidos especialistas torácicos; uno de ellos nos dijo que estaba seguro de que el tumor era en un 90 por ciento, un linfoma. Pasé las siguientes dos semanas en casa, esperando que el hospital llamara y me admitiera para recibir tratamiento. Al no recibir ninguna llamada, mi esposa y yo fuimos al hospital. Durante nuestra visita, el jefe del departamento nos dijo que mi tumor de ocho centímetros estaba completamente atrapado dentro de arterias y vasos sanguíneos clave que irrigaban el corazón. Cualquier procedimiento quirúrgico podía ser fatal. Los exámenes detallados posteriores confirmaron que las células cancerosas no habían hecho metástasis y me diagnosticaron un raro tumor mediastínico. El hospital concertó una cita con el departamento de hematología y oncología a finales de agosto. Recibimos la noticia del fallecimiento de mi suegra el 20 de agosto y regresamos a Hualien al día siguiente para asistir a su funeral. Durante la cena, una frase apareció vívidamente en mi mente: \"Quieren imponerte una enfermedad y someterte a un tratamiento\". Inmediatamente respondí: \"Entonces rechazo más tratamientos\". Al día siguiente regresé al Departamento de Hematología y Oncología para mi consulta. El especialista miró mi informe y dijo: \"Después de estudiar el informe del examen y sus síntomas, no hemos podido diagnosticar su enfermedad\". Me quedé impactado. ¡Estas palabras hicieron eco de la voz que escuché antes! Los médicos me dijeron que confirmaron que era un “tumor carcinoide” el 4 de octubre. Debido a su tamaño y ubicación peligrosa, sugirieron que me sometiera a una dosis alta de quimioterapia lo antes posible. Cuando le pedí al médico que me diera dos meses antes de volver a comprobar mi situación, el médico respondió: \"Para entonces, necesitarás tratamiento de urgencia y, además, no podemos garantizar tu supervivencia\". No sabía que mi condición ya había llegado a un estado muy crítico. Para entonces, el tumor presionaba y bloqueaba los vasos sanguíneos que canalizaban la sangre, provocando una grave falta de oxígeno en todo mi cuerpo. Tenía la cara hinchada, tosí sangre y me faltaba el aire. Tenía dificultad para tragar y no tenía fuerzas para masticar cuando comía. Encuentro con Falun Dafa Me reuní con algunos amigos en una reunión el 1 de octubre. Uno de los asistentes era un amigo que practicaba Falun Dafa durante más de 10 años y me recomendó leer [Zhuan Falun](https://es.falundafa.org/docs/zfl-2017/zfl-es-00-2017.html?v=bks04). Viajo con frecuencia a China por trabajo y mi exposición a la propaganda sobre Falun Dafa me hizo evitar toda información relacionada con la práctica. Investigué Falun Dafa después de regresar a casa. Además de descubrir que Falun Dafa enseña a los practicantes a cultivar la bondad, descubrí que la práctica estaba disponible sin costo alguno e incluso se podía encontrar en línea. Convencido de que esta era la forma de cultivación recta que había estado buscando, comencé a aprender los ejercicios y a escuchar grabaciones de audio de las conferencias de Shifu en el sitio web. Aproximadamente dos semanas después, me desperté sintiendo irritación en la cavidad nasal derecha. Estornudé para expulsar una bola de moco salpicada de coágulos de sangre. Desde entonces, ¡la congestión nasal y la secreción nasal que me habían atormentado durante más de 20 años desaparecieron! Durante años, intenté, sin éxito, curar mi enfermedad con remedios tradicionales chinos, medicina occidental y comiendo alimentos saludables. Sin embargo, Falun Dafa curó esto. Originalmente, quería cultivarme antes de morir, con la esperanza de que mi cultivación permaneciera profundamente arraigada en mi corazón. Si tuviera la buena suerte de reencarnar como humano en mi próxima vida, quisiera seguir practicando Falun Dafa. Las rápidas mejoras de mi salud despertaron el interés de mi esposa. Comenzó a leer sobre Falun Dafa y a aprender la práctica. En dos meses me recuperé de diversas afecciones crónicas, como dolores de cabeza, dolor de espalda, congestión y secreción nasal, flemas frecuentes, moscas volantes y palpitaciones del corazón. Mi tumor originalmente medía ocho centímetros y era un bulto obvio en la parte media derecha de mi pecho. Desapareció y solo me di cuenta un día que no pude encontrarlo con mis manos. Mi tos con sangre y mi intenso dolor de esternón desaparecieron, y ya no me faltaba el aliento cuando caminé del segundo al tercer piso. Hoy en día, subir del primer al quinto piso es muy fácil y mi cuerpo está en mejor forma que cuando tenía 40 años. Solía sufrir de cálculos renales varias veces al año. Hasta la fecha ha pasado más de un año, pero mis cálculos renales no han vuelto a aparecer. Hacer bien las tres cosas “La vida es impredecible y confusa. La verdad traerá claridad y el destino otorgará bendiciones”. Leí este pasaje por primera vez en el Semanario Minghui, cuando le contaba a la gente sobre Falun Dafa y aclaraba la verdad en el templo de Xuanguang ubicado en el lago Sun Moon. Muchos turistas que visitan este lugar pintoresco han sido envenenados por la propaganda del PCCh y nos evitan. Sin embargo, hay algunos que se salvan gracias a nuestros esfuerzos y han expresado su más sincera gratitud. Habiendo recibido esta preciosa oportunidad de cultivarnos, mi esposa y yo ya no deambulamos por la vida, perdidos en la confusión entre la gente común. Estudiamos el Fa y practicamos los ejercicios todos los días. También participamos en actividades grupales de estudio del Fa y clarificación de la verdad. Durante nuestro segundo viaje al lago Sun Moon, un practicante de nuestro grupo de estudio del Fa les recordó a todos: “El propósito de nuestro viaje es aclarar la verdad y transmitir nuestra compasión. Deberíamos aumentar la conciencia de la gente sobre Dafa. No te apresures y trates de convencer a la gente de que practique la cultivación”. Esta afirmación me hizo pensar. Después de obtener el Fa y recibir tantos beneficios, mi esposa y yo estábamos decididos a persuadir a otros para que obtuvieran el Fa. Aunque aquellos con quienes hablamos reaccionaron positivamente, se negaron a practicar. Nuestra impaciencia puede haber obstaculizado su oportunidad de obtener el Fa. Ese día, experimentamos la energía armoniosa y poderosa que nos permitió transmitir palabras de compasión y aclarar la verdad sobre Falun Gong. Hacia aquellos que rechazaron o respondieron con rudeza, nuestros corazones permanecieron impasibles y continuamos ofreciendo nuestra compasión. También sentimos el campo de energía amable y estable emitido por los compañeros practicantes que se han estado cultivando durante muchos años. Esto nos motivó a mi esposa y a mí a trabajar más duro en la cultivación, para fortalecer nuestras energías internas y aclarar la verdad de manera más efectiva. Al principio mi esposa y yo practicábamos en casa. Con las enseñanzas del Fa y las cinco series de ejercicios disponibles gratuitamente en línea, sentimos que podíamos practicar diligentemente por nuestra cuenta sin necesidad de participar en sesiones grupales de estudio del Fa. Pero, después de participar en una sesión de estudio del Fa con compañeros practicantes en mayo, me di cuenta de los grandes beneficios que el estudio del Fa en grupo y el intercambio de experiencias tenían para nuestra cultivación. Mi esposa y yo hemos estado practicando Falun Dafa durante más de un año, pero nuestra comprensión es muy superficial. Solo puedo usar esta comprensión preliminar para contarles sobre mis experiencias de cultivación y agradecer a Shifu por su compasión. ¡Gracias estimado Shifu! ¡Gracias, compañeros practicantes!
