    "title": "House Speaker Says GOP Has \"Obligation\" to \"Eliminate\" Medicaid. Young Kim MIA.",
    "text": "Kim & House GOP would risk health coverage for 82,000 people in CA-40\nWith inflation rising and the price of eggs hitting all time highs, Young Kim and House Republicans are scheming to rip away health coverage for millions of American families to fund tax breaks for billionaires and wealthy corporations.\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson doubled down on the GOP bait and switch, telling Punchbowl News that he intends to cut Medicaid: “We have a stewardship obligation to root that out and eliminate it.”\nLast week, far-right Republicans scored a huge victory when the Budget Committee adopted an amendment that ensured Republicans would seek at least $1.5 trillion in cuts to vital programs like Medicaid.\nDespite campaigning on making life more affordable for Californians, Kim is poised to do just the opposite.\nDCCC Spokesperson Courtney Rice:\n“Young Kim knows exactly what she is doing. After Republicans accepted millions of dollars from billionaires like Elon Musk, they are choosing to screw over hardworking families with cruel cuts to Medicaid in order to fund tax breaks for their same billionaire backers.”\n###",

As I arrived home and took off my snow boots , I started thinking about how nice it would be to slip my feet into a cozy pair of house socks like these ones from heritage outdoors brand Woolrich. Usually $14, they’re marked down to just $8 at REI right now, which is a 43 percent discount.\nWith a fleecy inner layer and knitted outer layer, these snuggly socks are ideal for padding around one’s apartment — even more so because they’re infused with aloe vera, which helps combat dry winter skin .

Speaking of which: If you’re on the hunt for winter socks to wear once you leave the house, here’s a guide I wrote to the best merino-wool ones .\nWoolrich Aloe-Infused Double-Layer Socks - Snowflakes $8 $14 now 43% off $8 $8 at REI Buy",

Jay Biggerstaff-USA TODAY Sports Gambling content 21+. The New York Post may receive an affiliate commission if you sign up through our links. Read our editorial standards for more information.\nPatrick Mahomes’ receiving corps is as good as it’s been in years.\nOver the offseason, Chiefs brass went out and signed wide receiver Marquise “Hollywood” Brown and drafted speedster Xavier Worthy with the No. 28 overall pick.\nAlthough Brown will miss the opener with a shoulder injury, Worthy’s presence alone will help Mahomes in the passing game in Thursday’s season opener against the Ravens.\nMahomes had perhaps the worst season of his career in 2023 in the passing department with a career-high 14 interceptions, a career-worst 7.0 yards per attempt and a 92.6 passer rating.\nVegas oddsmakers are expecting some improvement with his new weapons this season, though, pegging Mahomes as the favorite to lead the NFL in passing yards.\nExplore More Fanatics Sportsbook Promo: Earn $1K in bonus bets with daily bet match for Ravens vs. Chiefs, any game Ravens vs. Chiefs same-game parlay: NFL Kickoff game picks, player props, odds Chiefs vs. Ravens predictions, odds: Two prop picks for Thursday’s 2024 NFL season opener Patrick Mahomes #15 of the Kansas City Chiefs looks for an open receiver during the first quarter of a preseason game against the Detroit Lions at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium on August 17, 2024 in Kansas City, Missouri. Getty Images\nHe’ll get his first licks against the Ravens in Kansas City, where his passing yards over/under are sitting at 267.5 at BetRivers Sportsbook hours before kickoff.\nMahomes went over this number in half of his games (10/20) last season, including the Chiefs’ playoff run.\nBut from 2018-23, Mahomes had no problem clearing 267.5 passing yards on a regular basis, throwing for 268+ in nearly two-thirds (63.1 percent) during the regular season over that period.",
