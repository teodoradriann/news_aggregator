    "title": "UN warns of rapidly deteriorating human rights situation in the West Bank, calls for end to violence | Jordan Times",
    "text": "GENEVA — A UN report released today details the rapidly deteriorating human rights situation in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, after 7 October 2023, and calls on Israel to end unlawful killings and settler violence against the Palestinian population.\n The report calls for an immediate end to the use of military weapons and means during law enforcement operations, an end to arbitrary detention and ill-treatment of Palestinians, and the lifting of discriminatory movement restrictions.\n The UN Human Rights Office has verified the deaths of 300 Palestinians from 7 October to 27 December 2023 — including 79 children — in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, since the sudden attacks by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups in southern Israel. Of these, Israeli forces killed at least 291 Palestinians, settlers killed eight, and one Palestinian was killed either by Israeli forces or settlers. Prior to 7 October, 200 Palestinians had already been killed in the area in 2023 — the highest number in a ten-month-period since the UN began keeping records in 2005.\n “The use of military tactics means and weapons in law enforcement contexts, the use of unnecessary or disproportionate force, and the enforcement of broad, arbitrary and discriminatory movement restrictions that affect Palestinians are extremely troubling,” said UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk, reflecting on the findings of the report.\n “The violations documented in this report repeat the pattern and nature of violations reported in the past in the context of the long-standing Israeli occupation of the West Bank. However, the intensity of the violence and repression is something that has not been seen in years,” he added.\n“I call on Israel to take immediate, clear and effective steps to put an end to settler violence against the Palestinian population, to investigate all incidents of violence by settlers and Israeli forces, to ensure effective protection of Palestinian communities against any form of forcible transfer, and to ensure the ability of herding communities displaced due to repeated attacks by armed settlers to return to their lands.”\nThe report, which covered the period from 7 October to 20 November, described a sharp increase in air strikes as well as in incursions by armoured personnel carriers and bulldozers sent to refugee camps and other densely populated areas in the West Bank, resulting in deaths, injuries and extensive damage to civilian objects and infrastructure. These incursions, which continue to take place, have resulted in the death of at least 105 Palestinians, among them 23 children, since 7 October up to today.\n In one of these instances, on 19 and 20 October, during a 30 hour-long incursion into Nur Shams Refugee Camp in Tulkarem, Israeli forces using military weaponry and means of engagement killed 14 Palestinians, including six children, wounded at least 20 others, and arrested 10 Palestinians, the report said.\n Israeli forces have arrested more than 4,700 Palestinians, including about 40 journalists, in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Some were stripped naked, blindfolded and restrained for long hours with handcuffs and with their legs tied, while Israeli forces stepped on their heads and backs, were spat at, slammed against walls, threatened, insulted, humiliated and in some cases subjected to sexual and gender-based violence, the report describes.\n In the weeks following 7 October, there has also been a sharp rise in settler attacks with an average of six incidents per day, such as shootings, burning of homes and vehicles, and uprooting of trees. In many incidents, settlers were accompanied by Israeli forces, or were themselves wearing Israeli forces’ uniforms, and carrying army rifles, the report said. The UN Human Rights Office documented multiple incidents of settlers attacking Palestinians harvesting their olives, including with firearms, and forcing them to leave their land, stealing their harvest and poisoning or vandalising their olive trees, depriving many Palestinians of a vital source of income.\n “The de-humanisation of Palestinians that characterises many of the settlers’ actions is very disturbing and must cease immediately. Israeli authorities should strongly censure and prevent settler violence and prosecute both its instigators and perpetrators,” said the UN Human Rights Chief.\nSince 7 October, Israeli authorities have imposed severe and systematic restrictions on the movement of Palestinians across the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, the report said. The Israeli forces has closed almost all entrances to Palestinian villages and towns to vehicular access and disconnected Palestinian cities and towns from main roads by closing road gates and placing earth mounds or concrete roadblocks.\n“The report reiterates our calls for a halt to measures that lead to the creation of a coercive environment and concerns regarding forcible transfer, in addition to the continued lack of accountability for settler and Israeli forces’ violence,” said Türk.\nThe High Commissioner urged Israel to grant the UN Human Rights Office access to the country, adding it was ready to report similarly on the 7 October attacks.",

    "text": "Rain, coastal flooding and waves as tall as 30 feet were expected along parts of the West Coast today, a day after giant waves pummeled the California shoreline and prompted some evacuation warnings.\nMore than 6 million people in coastal areas of California and Oregon were under high surf warnings overnight as breaking waves posed an “especially heightened threat to life and property,” according to the National Weather Service.\n“Dangerously large” waves about 28 to 33 feet tall, and potentially up to 40 feet tall, were forecast overnight in some coastal spots in the San Francisco Bay Area and for some parts of Central California, where a few communities in Santa Cruz County had received evacuation warnings a day earlier.\nPHOTO GALLERY: Large Pacific swell delivers big surf in California\nA high surf warning for the Bay Area and the Central Coast expired at 3 a.m. local time. But a high surf advisory, indicating a lower level of risk, along with a coastal flood advisory, were scheduled to last for several more hours.\nSeparately, a high surf warning was set to remain in effect through Saturday for more than 4 million people along the coasts of Oregon and California. The Weather Service office in Medford, Oregon, said that it expected infrastructure damage and beach erosion from breaking waves up to 30 feet tall.\nIn Southern California, forecasters predicted waves of up to 25 feet and said that the threat of significant coastal flooding would last into Saturday night. For beaches in San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties, northwest of Los Angeles, high surf and coastal flood warnings were in effect through 10 p.m. Saturday. (A coastal flood warning is a notch higher than an advisory and indicates an imminent or likely threat to life and property.)\nThe Weather Service office in Los Angeles told surfers and beachgoers that the risk of drowning was high, and the California state parks system warned outdoor enthusiasts to be careful at the ocean. More than a dozen state parks and beaches in California were fully or partially closed because of bad weather.\nThe large waves were part of a storm system that was approaching the West Coast early today. The Weather Service said in a forecast that moderate rainfall, becoming heavy in some places, was likely for much of California later in the day. A foot or two of snow was also possible in the Sierra Nevada by Saturday night.\nSome coastal areas of California, Oregon and Washington state were also under a gale warning until late today, meaning that wind gusts of 39 to 54 mph were imminent or already occurring.\nThere is evidence that the United States can expect more unusual and severe storms as the planet heats up, potentially striking in new places or at unexpected times of year.\nLast winter brought some of the most ferocious weather that California had seen in decades, including many atmospheric rivers — narrow conveyor belts of water vapor in the sky — that dumped wave after wave of precipitation onto already soaking ground.\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said in October that it expected conditions to be wetter than average across much of California this winter, partly because of the weather phenomenon El Nino.\n———\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.",

    "text": "«Si actualmente con la jornada laboral de 40 horas no podemos cubrir las demandas del mercado , ¿cómo las vamos a cubrir reduciendo todavía más la jornada?». Esta frase del presidente de la patronal de jóvenes empresarios Ceaje, Fermín Albaladejo , resume un sentir que se extiende entre la mayor parte de empresarios españoles, más aún entre los pertenecientes a aquellos sectores a los que más les cuesta encontrar trabajadores, que ven con preocupación añadida la necesidad de relevos que necesitarán si les han de recortar sus horarios por ley. La crisis de mano de obra puede agravarse desde el año que viene si la medida estrella del Gobierno, la jornada laboral de 37,5 horas , entra en vigor tal y como se ha comprometido en el acuerdo de legislatura. Pero no solo eso, en la actualidad, esta falta de trabajadores que cada vez se está extendiendo a más y más actividades (ya no solo en las altamente cualificadas) va a tener un impacto directo también en la reconstrucción de Valencia tras el paso de la catastrófica dana.\nMás que ladrillo y servicios\nSolo en una primera estimación, la patronal de la construcción calcula que harán falta un mínimo de 30.000 trabajadores para comenzar la reconstrucción de las zonas devastadas por la dana. «Nosotros ya teníamos un problema estructural de mano de obra para hacer las viviendas que se dice que se tienen que hacer y esta situación ha venido a agravar la situación del mercado», se lamenta José Luis Santa Isabel, presidente de la Federación de Contratistas de Obras de la Administración de la Comunidad Valenciana (Fecoval) , que insta a los nuevos parados, aquellas personas que han perdido su empleo tras la dana, a que se sumen al sector de la construcción.\nPero la escasez de mano de obra no solo afecta a la construcción, ni al comercio, ni a la hostelería , se ha extendido también a sectores como la tecnología, la salud y los servicios. Tampoco es una cuestión de puestos altamente cualificados. El número de vacantes en España se ha exacerbado tras la pandemia, se ha triplicado en la última década y supera ya la barrera de las 150.000 , según las cifras oficiales del INE, aunque no casan con las denuncias que hacen desde los diferentes sectores.",

    "title": "“I’m doing this for both of us.” UK grad earns Social Work degree, honoring her veteran husband - University of Kentucky College of Social Work",
    "text": "LEXINGTON, KY (April 18, 2024) – At the University of Kentucky, Tracy Garret’s return to college is a narrative of transformation. At 54, Garret is not the traditional student one might expect to see in a Bachelor of Social Work program. Her journey is unique, her resolve unshakable, and her story interlaced with moments of deep personal change. “I’ve bled blue since I knew what that meant,” Garret said with a sense of nostalgia and determination. “It’s always been my dream to have a degree from UK. At one time, I thought that was completely out of reach for me, but now I see the light at the end of the tunnel.” Garret’s first stint at UK began in 1988, a year that would set the stage for her lifelong connection with the university. As a sophomore, she stepped into the rhythm of the marching band and alongside, found her life’s partner. Yet, with the unexpected twist of early pregnancy, her educational aspirations were put on pause. Years rolled on, filled with family life and a move prompted by her husband’s Navy career. “We always said this was the best thing that ever happened to our family” she recalls on these transformative years. “My husband was really proud to serve… and it opened so many doors for us.” In 2018, Garret found her way back to Kentucky, and with her family, embraced the role of foster parents, living their belief that love could build bridges to healing for children in need. “We always said we were a house full of love,” Garret said. “That was our family motto.” Then, as the pandemic closed doors, it simultaneously opened a new one for Garret. Her husband’s encouragement was the nudge she needed. “He simply said, ‘You’re going back to school,’ and somehow, that made perfect sense,” she recalls. Garret describes her decision to re-enroll at UK as “the decision that changed my life.” It wasn’t just a return to academia; it was a reaffirmation of dreams and the love that had carried her through the years, and a community of support. Tragedy struck in December 2023, when Garret faced the loss of her husband. The impact was devastating. “In a single moment, my world turned upside down,” she shares with a mix of pain and strength. “I lost my husband and I knew I couldn’t continue to foster.” The subsequent decision to close her home to foster care was one of the most difficult she’s ever made, but it was essential for her well-being. Through the midst of her sorrow, Garret’s commitment to her social work studies never wavered, bolstered by the support of her cohort at the College of Social Work. “My cohort immediately had my back with everything I needed. This semester has been chaos – I see the finish line, I’m almost at the end, I feel bittersweet, and I know my husband’s watching me from above and he’s still cheering me on,” said Garret. Looking ahead, Garret envisions a new beginning as a social worker dedicated to veterans. “Serving those who’ve served us is how I’ll honor his memory,” Garret articulates. “My husband’s pride in his Navy service is my inspiration.” With her impending graduation, Garret not only honors her past but also paves the way for her future. Her advice to others contemplating a return to education is unequivocal: “Take the step. Education is a journey of self-discovery and empowerment.” As Tracy Garret stands at the threshold of graduation, her story at UK concludes one chapter and commences another. Hers is a narrative of life’s unexpected paths, of persisting through adversity, and the power of education to ignite hope anew. It is a poignant reminder that it is never too late to embrace change and leave a lasting impact. Tracy Garret’s story at UK is one of heart, of resilience, and a testament to the indomitable human spirit.",
