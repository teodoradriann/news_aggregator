    "text": "Happy Friday everyone! We are setting up to see a very unsettled weekend ahead. First, let's start with this morning. You may run into a few slick and icy spots on the roads along the Treasure Valley due to freezing rain, and snow. Drive with extra caution as you head into your morning commute.\nAs we prepare to head into the weekend, a stronger and warmer system along the coast will slowly move inland. Bringing widespread rain and snow into Friday evening through Saturday. If you have any plans outdoors be sure to move them inside, and carry your umbrella through Saturday.\nA winter storm watch has been issued for the Camas Prarie, Boise Mountains, and West Central Mountains through Saturday evening. However, snowfall totals may be near the 6\" under 5,000 feet elevation due to the system incoming bringing warmer temperatures.\nWhile the heaviest amount may not occur, again it's best to prepare for icy and slick road conditions through Saturday along our mountains. Snowfall amounts vary from 10\"-18\" above 7,000 feet elevation with 2\"-13\" possible above 5,500 feet.\nAs far as rainfall totals along the Valley floors, we can anticipate anywhere from 0.50\"-0.75\" through Saturday. It's possible that we may see a mixing of both snow and rain as we continue into Saturday.\nGood news is that the rain doesn't stick all the way through our weekend. We dry out into Sunday with partly cloudy skies and temperatures sitting in the mid 40s.\nThe start of next week will continue to bring isolated showers into Monday possibly Tuesday.\nWe will get through the rain and snow together!\nHave a wonderful and safe weekend Idaho\nStay up to date right here or [https://www.instagram.com/sophiacruzwx/](https://www.instagram.com/sophiacruzwx/)",

    "text": "by Sharelle Burt August 15, 2024 J.D. Vance Thinks The Purpose Of A ‘Postmenopausal Female’ Is To Raise Grandkids Do you agree? GOP Vice Presidential nominee J.D. Vance gave an unconventional take on the purpose of the “postmenopausal female”: to raise grandkids, TMZ reports. During an April 2020 appearance on “The Portal” podcast, host Eric Weinstein proposed grandmothers raising grandkids is “the whole purpose of the postmenopausal female.” Vance then chimed in and talked about how beneficial it was to have his wife’s mother move in with them to take care of their newborn son. “She lived with us for a year,” Vance admitted. After labeling it a “weird, unadvertised feature of marrying an Indian woman,” he called it the most “transgressive thing I’ve ever done against sort of the hyper neo-liberal approach to the working family.” “My wife had this baby seven weeks before she started the clerkship, still not sleeping any more than an hour and a half, and her mom just took a sabbatical … .for a year and came and lived with us and took care of our kid for a year,” he said. “And it’s just one of those things…this is what you do.” His mother-in-law is a biology professor at a college in California , and he called her decision “painfully economically inefficient.” While the interview is four years past, Vance’s postmenopausal comments have since gone viral, catching the attention of “The View” Host Alyssa Farah Griffin. According to Newsweek, Griffin reposted the clip on X and called for men to stay out of women’s business ,“ writing: *shouts into void* Can men please stop analyzing women’s value to society based around their fertility/ menstruation/ if they have kids?” she wrote. A spokesperson from Vance’s team accused the media of twisting the senator’s words. “The media is dishonestly putting words in JD’s mouth — of course, he does not agree with what the host said,” spokesperson Taylor Van Kirk said. “JD reacted to the first part of the host’s sentence, assuming he would say: ‘That’s the whole purpose of spending time with grandparents.’ It’s a disgrace that the media is lying about JD instead of holding Kamala Harris accountable for her policies that caused sky-high prices for groceries and everyday necessities, a disaster at the southern border, and a historic drug overdose epidemic.” The former White House aide in the Trump administration warned that the senator’s “radioactive” comments could ultimately hurt the Republican Party come November 2024. Vance is still catching heat for his 2021 interview when he said the country was run by “childless cat ladies.” RELATED CONTENT: J.D.
