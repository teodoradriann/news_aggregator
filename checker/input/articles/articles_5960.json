    "title": "Meltwater beneath Martian Ice Could Support Microbial Life, Researchers Suggest",
    "text": "On Earth, solar radiation can transmit down to multiple meters within ice, depending on its optical properties. Organisms within ice can harness energy from photosynthetically active radiation while being protected from damaging ultraviolet radiation. On Mars, the lack of an effective ozone shield allows approximately 30% more damaging ultraviolet radiation to reach the surface in comparison with Earth. However, new research shows that despite the intense surface ultraviolet radiation, there are radiatively habitable zones within ice in the Martian mid-latitudes, at depths ranging from a few centimeters for ice with 0.01-0.1% dust, and up to a few meters within cleaner ice.\nThe white edges along these gullies in Mars’ Terra Sirenum are believed to be dusty water ice. Khuller et al . think meltwater could form beneath the surface of this kind of ice, providing a place for possible photosynthesis. Image credit: NASA / JPL-Caltech / University of Arizona.\n“If we’re trying to find life anywhere in the Universe today, Martian ice exposures are probably one of the most accessible places we should be looking,” said Dr. Aditya Khuller, a researcher at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nMars has two kinds of ice: frozen water and frozen carbon dioxide.\nDr. Khuller and colleagues looked at water ice, large amounts of which formed from snow mixed with dust that fell on the surface during a series of Martian ice ages in the past million years.\nThat ancient snow has since solidified into ice, still peppered with specks of dust.\nAlthough dust particles may obscure light in deeper layers of the ice, they are key to explaining how subsurface pools of water could form within ice when exposed to the Sun.\nDark dust absorbs more sunlight than the surrounding ice, potentially causing the ice to warm up and melt up to a few feet below the surface.\nMars scientists are divided about whether ice can actually melt when exposed to the Martian surface.\nThat’s due to the planet’s thin, dry atmosphere, where water ice is believed to sublimate — turn directly into gas — the way dry ice does on Earth.\nBut the atmospheric effects that make melting difficult on the Martian surface wouldn’t apply below the surface of a dusty snowpack or glacier.\nOn Earth, dust within ice can create what are called cryoconite holes — small cavities that form in ice when particles of windblown dust (called cryoconite) land there, absorb sunlight, and melt farther into the ice each summer.\nEventually, as these dust particles travel farther from the Sun’s rays, they stop sinking, but they still generate enough warmth to create a pocket of meltwater around them.\nThe pockets can nourish a thriving ecosystem for simple lifeforms.\n“This is a common phenomenon on Earth,” said Dr. Phil Christensen, a researcher at Arizona State University.\n“Dense snow and ice can melt from the inside out, letting in sunlight that warms it like a greenhouse, rather than melting from the top down.”\nIn 2021, the authors discovered dusty water ice exposed within gullies on Mars, proposing that many Martian gullies form by erosion caused by the ice melting to form liquid water.\nTheir new paper suggests that dusty ice lets in enough light for photosynthesis to occur as deep as 3 m (9 feet) below the surface.\nIn this scenario, the upper layers of ice prevent the shallow subsurface pools of water from evaporating while also providing protection from harmful radiation.\nThat’s important, because unlike Earth, Mars lacks a protective magnetic field to shield it from both the Sun and radioactive cosmic ray particles zipping around space.\n“The water ice that would be most likely to form subsurface pools would exist in Mars’ tropics, between 30 degrees and 60 degrees latitude, in both the northern and southern hemispheres,” the researchers said.\nThe paper appears in the journal Communications Earth & Environment .",

    "text": "Colombia\nLuego de que el Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadística (DANE) informara que la tasa nacional de desocupación en Colombia pasó del 9,5 % (noviembre 2022) al 9,0 % (noviembre 2023), el presidente Gustavo Petro destacó el balance en materia de recuperación de empleo.\n“ Excelente noticia de fin de año, tenemos una caída sustancial del desempleo en el mes de noviembre. Llegamos a 9%. La tasa de ocupación sigue subiendo sobretodo en empleo formal y la tasa global de participación de la población en la economía también”, comenzó diciendo el presidente.\nSegún Petro, con este balance se refleja que “la brecha de empleo entre hombre y mujer se cierra. Subió el salario mínimo real y subió el empleo. Datos para una nueva macroeconomía”.\nPese a lo destacado por el jefe de Estado, otros sectores han alertado que más allá de esta reducción con relación al año pasado, en esta nueva entrega se evidencian tres meses seguidos con tasa de desempleo mensual desestacionalizada creciendo.\nUno de los críticos fue el exministro de Hacienda (del Gobierno Duque) José Manuel Restrepo, quien comentó que “en palabras sencillas, eliminando diferencias de comparación de los meses, el desempleo lleva tres meses seguidos aumentando”.",

    "title": "Marianne Faithfull, singer-songwriter and 1960s pop star, dies at 78",
    "text": "Marianne Faithfull, singer-songwriter and 1960s pop star, dies at 78\nReviews and recommendations are unbiased and products are independently selected. Postmedia may earn an affiliate commission from purchases made through links on this page.\nArticle content\nMarianne Faithfull, a British singer-songwriter and 1960s pop star who reinvented herself as a new-wave artist and smoky-voiced chanteuse, channeling her struggles with drug abuse and personal loss into songs of torment, anger, sorrow and resilience, died Jan. 30 in London. She was 78.\nA spokesperson for Ms. Faithfull confirmed the death but did not provide a cause. Ms. Faithfull had battled years of health problems – including hepatitis C, breast cancer and an infection from a broken hip – before being hospitalized with covid in 2020. A year later, she told the New York Times that she was suffering from fatigue, memory problems and lung issues but was hoping to return to the stage.\nA teen idol, film and stage performer, deadpan vocalist, ragged torch singer and cabaret queen, Ms. Faithfull was initially known as a poster child for rock-and-roll excess, a tabloid fixture who dated Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger before battling anorexia and heroin use. She attempted suicide in the early 1970s and spent several years on the streets of London, suffering persistent laryngitis that left her voice husky and raw.\n“My career had been a fluke. … At best I was a curious anomaly in the mechanics of pop. As a performer I was only average,” she wrote in her 1994 autobiography, “Faithfull.”\nYet she made a triumphant comeback with the Grammy-nominated album “Broken English” (1979), embracing a darker, more intimate sound in songs such as Shel Silverstein’s “The Ballad of Lucy Jordan,” about a disillusioned suburban housewife. In recent years she drew renewed praise for albums including “Negative Capability” (2018), which combined new material with old standards and led a Rolling Stone reviewer to call her the “Grande Dame of Melancholy, the High Priestess of Dusky Rock.”\nThe album reaffirmed Ms. Faithfull’s reputation as a master interpreter of popular music, bringing new life over the years to songs by Dolly Parton, Randy Newman, Duke Ellington, Michel Legrand, Morrissey and Kurt Weill. She also worked with a varied cast of musicians, collaborating with artists including Metallica, Angelo Badalamenti, Nick Cave, PJ Harvey and David Bowie, with whom she performed “I Got You Babe” on a 1973 NBC variety show, dressed as a renegade nun in a backless habit.\nMs. Faithfull had turned toward music while studying at a Catholic convent school, performing in coffee houses and envisioning a future as a folk singer, if not an actor. But she said she was treated as “cheesecake” after Rolling Stones manager Andrew Loog Oldham spotted her in 1964, sitting on a heater at a London record-industry party at age 17 with blond hair, sparkling eyes and one of her boyfriend’s shirts tucked into her jeans.\n“Who is she?” Oldham asked her date, according to Ms. Faithfull’s autobiography.\nAs Ms. Faithfull wrote, “That was that.”\nInvited into the studio, she recorded the melancholy single “As Tears Go By,” later calling it “a commercial fantasy that pushes all the right buttons.” Written by Oldham, Jagger and Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards, it cracked the Top 10 in Britain and was recorded by the Stones in 1965.\nThe song thrust Ms. Faithfull and her quavering soprano into the acid-, booze- and grass-fueled center of the London music scene. She put out pop singles (“Come and Stay With Me”) and folk songs (“Blowin’ in the Wind” by Bob Dylan, whose advances she rejected), and in 1965 she simultaneously released her first two studio albums, the pop collection “Marianne Faithfull” and folksy “Come My Way.”\nShe also maintained a close association with the Stones. “I slept with three of them and then decided the lead singer was the best bet,” People magazine once quoted her as saying, explaining the origins of her four-year relationship with Jagger.\nMs. Faithfull performed at the group’s “Rock and Roll Circus” concert in 1968; contributed to the “whoo-whoo” backing vocals on their song “Sympathy for the Devil” (by some accounts it was inspired by the novel “The Master and Margarita,” which she gave to Jagger); and co-wrote “Sister Morphine,” a bluesy song about addiction that she released in 1969, two years before the Stones.\nBut her public image was transformed by a 1967 drug bust at Richards’s estate, which briefly landed him and Jagger in jail and led to Ms. Faithfull’s increasing villainization in the press. She was reportedly found by the police wearing nothing but a bearskin rug.\n“They emerged with their reputations amplified as dangerous, glamorous outlaws. … I was destroyed by the very things that enhanced them,” she later wrote, according to Britain’s Observer newspaper.\nIn 1969, soon after Stones musician Brian Jones was dismissed from the band and found dead in his pool, Ms. Faithfull overdosed on barbiturates and entered a six-day coma. She awoke from her suicide attempt to see Jagger, who told her that she had seemed on the verge of death. In Ms. Faithfull’s telling, she replied, “Wild horses wouldn’t drag me away.”\nBy the time the Rolling Stones released “Wild Horses” in 1971, Ms. Faithfull and Jagger had split up. She had suffered a miscarriage, lost custody of a son from an early marriage and started using heroin, romanticizing the junkie lifestyle after reading William S. Burroughs’s novel “Naked Lunch.” “At that point,” she wrote in her autobiography, “I entered one of the outer levels of hell, and stayed there for years.”\nShe reemerged with “Broken English,” supported by musicians including keyboardist Steve Winwood and guitarist Barry Reynolds. The album included a propulsive cover of John Lennon’s “Working Class Hero”; a bouncy title song about the far-left German terrorist Baader–Meinhof Gang; and “Why D’ya Do It,” a sexually explicit punk-reggae number with lyrics from a Heathcote Williams poem.\n“It isn’t anything we’ve heard before, from anyone,” rock critic Greil Marcus wrote in Rolling Stone. “As far as Faithfull goes, there’s a gutsiness here, a sense of craft and a disruptive intelligence that nothing in her old records remotely suggested. ‘Broken English’ is a kind of triumph: fifteen years after making her first single, Marianne Faithfull has made her first real album.”\n“I gave myself permission to make a record that I’d wanted to make for a long time,” she later told Mojo magazine. “I thought I was going to die, that this was going to be my last chance to make a record. That is the thing about ‘Broken English,’ it’s this sense, this energy, that ‘ … before I die I’m going to show you … who I am.’ ”\nMarianne Evelyn Gabriel Faithfull was born in London on Dec. 29, 1946.\nHer father, Robert Glynn Faithfull, was a British intelligence officer and Italian literature instructor. Her mother, Austrian aristocrat Eva von Sacher-Masoch, was a onetime cabaret performer and relative of 19th-century author Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, whose name and writings inspired the term masochism.\nHer parents met in Vienna during World War II and separated when she was 6. Her father moved to a utopian commune near Oxford, and her mother sent her to a Catholic boarding school in Reading.\nAt 18, she married artist John Dunbar, with whom she had a son, Nicholas. Their marriage ended in divorce, as did Ms. Faithfull’s later marriages to punk musician Ben Brierley, who worked on “Broken English,” and Giorgio Della Terza, a writer and actor.\nSurvivors include her son and three grandchildren.\nAt the height of her 1960s fame, Ms. Faithfull worked as an actor, appearing in movies such as “The Girl on a Motorcycle” (1968), an erotic film co-starring Alain Delon (“Your body is like a violin in a velvet case,” his character tells Ms. Faithfull’s), and director Tony Richardson’s 1969 adaptation of “Hamlet,” as Ophelia to Nicol Williamson’s scruffy Hamlet.\nShe later played God in the British sitcom “Absolutely Fabulous” and the devil in productions of “The Black Rider,” a musical collaboration involving Burroughs, Tom Waits and director Robert Wilson.\n“Without showiness or actorly straining – but with a faint aura of rock ‘n’ roll sexual glamour still hovering around her – Ms. Faithfull explores a full and fascinating range of emotion,” Times movie critic A.O. Scott wrote of her performance in “Irina Palm” (2007) as a grandmother who becomes a prostitute.\nMs. Faithfull turned toward standards and cover songs after the release of “Broken English,” notably in the album “Strange Weather” (1987), her first full release since she was treated for heroin addiction. Her 21st solo album, “She Walks in Beauty” (2021), was completed after she was treated for covid-19 and featured readings of Romantic poems by Keats, Shelley and Wordsworth, set to music by Warren Ellis.\nThe album followed “Negative Capability,” her last with original material. “What can I do but pretend to be brave / And pretend to be strong when I’m not?” she sang on the closing track, “No Moon in Paris.” “There’s no moon, no moon in Paris tonight / And it’s lonely and that’s all I got.”\n“It’s the most honest record I’ve ever made,” Ms. Faithfull told the Observer. “There are no hidden corners. … I’m afraid it’s open-heart surgery, darling.”",

    "text": "Projections show that 98.6% of Canadians will have access to high-speed Internet by 2026\nOTTAWA, ON , Dec. 28, 2023 /CNW/ - No matter where you live, access to reliable, affordable high-speed Internet is essential. That's why the Government of Canada is working with provinces and territories, municipalities, Indigenous communities, and large and small Internet service providers to ensure that all Canadians are connected.\nToday, the Honourable Gudie Hutchings, Minister of Rural Economic Development and Minister responsible for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, updated Canadians on the Government of Canada's progress toward connecting all Canadians, no matter where they live, to high-speed Internet.\nA year of progress Thanks to the $3.225 billion Universal Broadband Fund (UBF), as well as other federal and provincial investments, the federal government is on track to exceed its goal of providing access to high-speed Internet to 98% of Canadian households by 2026 and 100% by 2030. Today, 93.5% of Canadian households have access to high-speed Internet compared to just 79% in 2014. Current projections show that 98.6% of households will have access by 2026.\nSince the launch of the UBF in November 2020 , 295 projects have been announced across Canada . This includes 45 projects in 2023 alone, which will serve more than 200,000 households. In 2023, 40,000 households also gained new access to high-speed Internet through completed UBF projects. The Government of Canada looks forward to announcing more UBF projects through 2024. Projects are posted online as they are announced.\nIn June 2023 , Minister Hutchings launched the government's redesigned website — canada.ca/rural . The interactive website is a source for rural Canadians to find relevant resources and information on Government of Canada programs, including the UBF.\nPartnering for success To help meet connectivity targets faster, the Government of Canada has also entered into co-funding partnerships with Quebec , Ontario , Newfoundland and Labrador , Alberta , British Columbia , and Prince Edward Island . With more than $2 billion in provincial co-funding secured, these partnerships allow for more households to be connected through UBF funding.\nMany provinces have made significant progress toward achieving universal connectivity already. With a total of $920 million in federal-provincial co-funding under Canada–Quebec Operation High Speed, Quebec has achieved our common goal of offering high-speed Internet access to all residents in the province. Many other provinces, including Prince Edward Island , New Brunswick , Ontario , British Columbia and Nova Scotia , are also very close to achieving universal connectivity.\nThe Government of Canada is working closely with all provinces and territories to help connect remaining underserved households. For the latest information on Canada's progress toward achieving universal high-speed Internet access, visit the interactive High-Speed Internet Access Dashboard . The dashboard allows Canadians to track national progress and government funding by province and territory.\nReal results, real progress These investments are making a real difference in peoples' lives, including by enabling them to access health care or expand their businesses.\nIn Iskatewizaagegan No. 39 Independent First Nation , also known as Shoal Lake No. 39 First Nation, community members are benefiting from improved access to reliable high-speed Internet. Residents can now access telehealth services, enabling people to meet with doctors virtually when in-person appointments are not possible. This has been an important benefit to Shoal Lake No. 39 First Nation and has improved residents' quality of life.\nElsewhere, in Port-Menier, Quebec , recent access to high-speed Internet has enhanced the village's tourism industry. Businesses in the community, located on Anticosti Island in the heart of the St. Lawrence, have improved their online visibility and increased their opportunities to market to tourists. Visitors can now enjoy the region's vast wilderness while staying connected to the rest of the world.\nThe work continues Since 2015, the federal government has allocated more than $7.6 billion for improving connectivity across Canada . These investments will level the playing field and ensure rural communities have equal ability to benefit from Internet access. The Government of Canada will continue working with provinces and territories, municipalities, Indigenous communities, and Internet service providers so that all Canadians, no matter where they live, have access to high-speed Internet as fast as possible.\nQuote \"High-speed Internet is no longer a luxury—it's a necessity. Thanks to our government, 93.5% of Canadian households now have access to high-speed Internet, compared to just 79% in 2014. We are on track to surpass our target of providing 98% of Canadians with high-speed Internet access by 2026 and all Canadians by 2030. I will continue to make sure rural Canadians have the access they need to affordable high-speed Internet connectivity.\" – The Honourable Gudie Hutchings, Minister of Rural Economic Development and Minister responsible for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency\nQuick facts Canada's Connectivity Strategy aims to provide all Canadians with access to Internet speeds of at least 50 megabits per second (Mbps) download / 10 Mbps upload. Since 2015, the Government of Canada has allocated $7.6 billion for building or improving broadband Internet infrastructure from coast to coast to coast. The Universal Broadband Fund (UBF) is a $3.225 billion investment by the Government of Canada designed to help provide high-speed Internet access to 98% of Canadians by 2026 and achieve the national target of 100% access by 2030. Of that amount, up to $50 million is allocated for mobile Internet projects that primarily benefit Indigenous people. Today, 93.5% of Canadian households have access to high-speed Internet compared to just 79% in 2014. The High-Speed Internet Access Dashboard is updated on a quarterly basis and allows Canadians to view national progress and government funding by province and territory. The National Broadband Internet Service Availability Map is an interactive tool that allows Canadians to find Internet service providers as well as connectivity projects under way in their area.

    "text": "BERLIN: Volkswagen workers will go on warning strikes on Monday at plants across Germany, labour union IG Metall said, marking the first large-scale walkouts at Volkswagen's domestic operations since 2018. The start of the strikes represents a further escalation of a dispute between Europe's top carmaker and its workers over mass layoffs, pay cuts and possible plant closures - drastic measures the company says it cannot rule out in the face of Chinese competition and cooling consumer demand. Labour representatives at VW had on Nov. 22 voted for limited strikes at German operations from early December after talks over wages and plant closures failed to achieve a breakthrough. If necessary, this will be the toughest collective bargaining battle Volkswagen has ever seen, IG Metall negotiator Thorsten Groeger said in a statement. The carmaker said it continues to rely on constructive dialogue to find a sustainable solution. Volkswagen respects the right of employees to take part in a warning strike, a spokesperson said in reply to the union's announcement, adding that the company had taken steps in advance to ensure a basic level of supplies to customers and minimise the impact of the strike. Warning strikes in Germany usually last from a few hours up to a day.",

    "title": "After the Hamas attack, is Christmas canceled in Bethlehem and Syria? - The Jerusalem Post",
    "text": "Hamas chose to attack Israel on October 7 , carrying out an unprecedented massacre directed at civilians. Now, two and a half months later, Christian minorities in the Middle East have been affected by the Hamas attack, as Christmas festivities are toned down or canceled in Bethlehem, Syria, and other places.\nWhile this is ostensibly in solidarity with suffering in Gaza, it is unclear where the pressure came from to coordinate this cancellation.\nAccording to CNN, “local leaders [in Bethlehem] made the decision last month to scale back festivities in solidarity with the Palestinian population, as heavy fighting raged between Israel and Hamas in the devastated Gaza Strip.”\nThe report notes that “decorations that once adorned neighborhoods have been removed. The parades and religious celebrations have been canceled. In the city center, Manger Square's traditional enormous Christmas tree is conspicuously absent.” Where is the holiday cheer?\nArab News also reported that in Syria, “Christmas cheer has deserted the streets of Syria’s cities, where the main churches have limited celebrations to prayers in solidarity with Palestinians suffering war in Gaza.” According to the report in Aleppo, an annual Christian market is now empty.\n“This year, the main square is almost empty, and no Christmas decorations are in sight.” Syriac Catholic Archbishop of Aleppo, Mor Dionysius Antoine Shahda, told the AFP that “in Syria, we canceled all official celebrations and receptions in our churches in solidarity with the victims of the bombing on Gaza.” A Palestinian dressed as Santa gestures during a celebration in Bethlehem, in the West Bank, December 2, 2021. Picture taken December 2, 2021. (credit: REUTERS/MUSSA QAWASMA)\nIt should be noted not all Christians in the Middle East celebrate Christmas on the same day. Christmas is celebrated in early January by Orthodox and Armenian Christians. Advertisement\nAccording to the report, the canceling of Christmas festivities is also being done by other churches, the Greek Orthodox, Syriac Orthodox, and Melkite Greek Catholics. The local Patriarchs of the churches said that “given the current circumstances, especially in Gaza, the patriarchs apologize for not receiving Christmas and New Year greetings,” according to the report.\n The same report in Damascus says there is only one Christmas market, and the Greek Orthodox Mariamite Cathedral in Damascus “has put up modest decorations and a small tree in its courtyard.” Is Christmas cancelled?\n The decision to cancel Christmas or pressure Christians to tone down celebrations is not universal across the region. In Turkey, various media spotlighted how Christmas would be festive this year.\nDaily Sabah wrote that Turkey is a “wonder place to be for the holiday season.” Hurriyet said, \"Istanbul clinched the second position among Europe's most brilliantly illuminated Christmas cities in the month of December, according to research conducted by a U.K.-based company that focused on the utilization of outdoor artificial lights during nighttime.” In the Gulf, there are plenty of signs of Christmas as well. Articles about Dubai, for instance, emphasize how malls and other areas have decorations up for the holiday.\n Lebanon is also celebrating Christmas. There are plenty of decorations up in Beirut, according to reports. In southern Lebanon, Christians have been affected by the ongoing Hezbollah attacks on Israel.\nAs with the Hamas attacks, causing Christmas to be canceled in Bethlehem and parts of Syria, due to Israel defending itself, Iranian-backed Hezbollah has also harmed Christians in southern Lebanon. There will be subdued Christian festivities in southern Lebanon.\n It also appears Christmas is going ahead as usual in Iran, even as Iran backed the Hamas and Hezbollah attacks that harmed Christmas in Bethlehem, southern Lebanon, and Syria. A report described Christmas cheer and shopping on Mirzaye Shirazi Street in northern Tehran.\nIn Erbil in northern Iraq’s autonomous Kurdistan Region, Christmas is also going ahead as expected. Kurdistan24 noted that “the Kurdistan Region’s capital Erbil has officially inaugurated the Christmas Festival, which hosts various food brands, concerts, and dances.\nThe Erbil International Fair (EIF) officially inaugurated the festival on Tuesday night in the presence of the Erbil governor and head of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) Board of Investment.”\n However, the Chaldean Patriarchate also put out a notice canceling many events linked to Christmas. This was not solely linked to the Gaza war.\nInstead, the announcement was due to the Iraqi central government's removal of Patriarch Raphael Louis Sako from his role as patriarch. Sako relocated to Erbil. The celebrations were also canceled due to a massive fire at a wedding in Bakhdida (Hamdaniya) this year, where most victims were Christian.\n“In addition, the statement cited the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict in the Holy Land, currently resulting in the deaths of over 19,000 people on both sides, as another reason for the cancellations,” Kurdistan24 said.\n“There will be no Christmas and New Year celebrations except for prayers for peace and stability in Iraq, the Holy Land, and the region. We apologize that we will not receive any congratulations from government officials during these holidays,\" the Patriarch read. According to the report, Christmas was also canceled in Iraq in 2014 during the ISIS war and in 2019.\nChristmas events have also been hijacked in the West to try to tie them to Gaza. A Rockefeller Center Christmas tree lighting in New York was disrupted by activists seeking to “flood” the tree lighting. The term “flood” is taken from the Hamas name for its attack on Israel and massacre of civilians.",

    "title": "'It's a huge blow' - Edogbo set to miss the rest of Munster's season",
    "text": "MUNSTER LOCK EDWIN Edogbo is set to miss the rest of this season with the Achilles tendon injury he suffered during his side’s St Stephen’s Day defeat to Leinster at Thomond Park.\n21-year-old Edogbo has previously ruptured his left Achilles tendon and also injured his right Achilles, with Munster now facing the strong likelihood of the imposing second row spending another spell on the sidelines.\nEdogbo will go for a surgical review of his latest Achilles injury next week but Munster are not expecting positive news.\n“It’s a huge blow for both [Munster and the player], I’m not going to lie,” said assistant coach Andi Kyriacou today when asked about Edogbo’s injury.\n“We saw it instantly in the game and all our heads went into our hands, we were absolutely devasted for him. He’s a kid who’s worked incredibly hard at his game and his craft. He’s shown huge improvements in the technical side, around the tight stuff in the forward side of the game and his mauling is incredible.\n“Some of the stuff he did against Leinster was superb, the way he cleans people out in phase play, the way he puts shots in defensively, he was looking good and we were all excited about where he was going so it’s a real shame that he’s not able to continue that this season.\n“We’ll get him right. He’s shown huge resilience mentally to bounce back from the last one and we’ve no doubt that he’ll show the same characteristics along this rehab journey he’s about to go on again.”\nAdvertisement\nWith RG Snyman and Jean Kleyn also injured at present, Munster may look to bring in short-term cover in the second row, although Fineen Wycherley could return from his shoulder issue for the clash against Connacht in Galway on New Year’s Day, while Tadhg Beirne is available again after sitting out the Leinster game.\n“We’ve got good lads here at the minute that we’re looking to develop and bring through,” said Kyriacou. “There’s no getting away from it, it’s tough when you have a physio room as loaded with talent as ours. We’ll drive on, it’s what we do.”\nMunster’s injury crisis continued to mount during the loss to Leinster, with the province confirming today that centre Alex Nankivell, hooker Diarmuid Barron, and loosehead prop Dave Kilcoyne all need scans on the injuries they suffered at Thomond Park.\nBarron, who has been captaining the province in recent times, has a foot injury and will go for a scan before getting surgical opinion next week. With Niall Scannell already sidelined, Munster are light at hooker.\nNankivell, who has had an impressive start to life with Munster, picked up an ankle injury against Leinster and will now undergo a scan.\nKilcoyne, meanwhile, suffered a shoulder injury in the same game and also requires a scan to determine the severity of the issue.\nPeter O’Mahony remains sidelined.\nFormer Munster captain Peter O’Mahony remains among the list of injured players who won’t return for the clash with Connacht in Galway.\nAlso on the Munster injury list are Patrick Campbell [shoulder], Kleyn [eye], Jack Daly [ankle], Liam Coombes [shoulder], Niall Scannell [groin], Snyman [chest/shoulder], Joey Carbery [wrist], Roman Salanoa [knee], Mike Haley [hip], and Cian Hurley [ankle/achilles].\nMore positively, Munster will be able to call on Beirne and scrum-half Conor Murray again after both Ireland internationals sat out the Leinster game due to the IRFU’s player management protocols.\n“It’s great,” said Kyriacou. “We had to give them that down week last week in line with the IRFU, and it’s two lads with unbelievable experience, and behind them world-class players.\n“It’s great to have them back in the mix this week, they’ll add value to the group and hopefully the performance come Monday.”\nMunster said second row Wycherley will “increase his training exposure” this week before a final call is made on his involvement against Connacht.\nMeanwhile, Leinster scrum-half Jamison Gibson-Park remains a doubt for his team’s URC clash with Ulster in Dublin on New Year’s Day.\nIreland international Gibson-Park was named to start Leinster’s meeting with Munster on St Stephen’s Day but he didn’t travel to Limerick and was officially withdrawn before his side’s win.\nThe influential scrum-half is now a doubt for the home clash against Ulster in four days’ time, with Leinster saying his unspecified injury “will be further assessed” this week after he was withdrawn from the Munster game as a “precaution.”\nLeinster can call on hooker John McKee after he returned to full training following his recent hamstring injury.",
