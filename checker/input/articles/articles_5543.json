    "text": "[World Bank](/user/world-bank)on Sat, 06/22/2024 - 02:09 WASHINGTON, June 21, 2024 — Over 113,000 people in Cambodia are expected to benefit from better water supply infrastructure following the approval today of a new World Bank supported project. WASHINGTON, June 21, 2024 — Over 113,000 people in Cambodia are expected to benefit from better water supply infrastructure following the approval today of a new World Bank supported project. Funded by a US$145 million credit from the World Bank’s International Development Association, the Cambodia Water Security Improvement Project will improve water security, increase agricultural productivity, and build resilience to climate risks. “This project helps Cambodia move toward sustainable water security and greater agricultural productivity,” said Maryam Salim, World Bank Country Manager for Cambodia. “Investing now in climate resilience, planning, and better infrastructure not only addresses the immediate water needs of Cambodian farmers and households, but also lays the groundwork for long-term water service delivery.” Although Cambodia has abundant water, seasonal and regional differences in rainfall bring challenges to urban and rural water supply. Climate projections suggest flooding and drought will become more frequent and severe, placing even more strain on the country's capacity to manage its freshwater resources. This would affect food production and economic growth. The project will be implemented over five years by the Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology and the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries. It will enhance water resource management by expanding hydrometeorological stations, updating policies and regulations, preparing climate-informed river basin management plans, and strengthening the performance of central and provincial water authorities. Water supply systems for households and irrigation are to be rehabilitated and upgraded, while the project will train Famer Water User Communities and provide technical assistance for improved operation and maintenance of infrastructure. With central and provincial departments for agriculture, forestry, and fisheries, measures will be taken to help farmers adopt climate-smart technologies that improve productivity and reduce emissions in agriculture.",

    "text": "Winter will finally arrive for B.C. ski areas this week, much to the delight of resorts waiting patiently for the white stuff to arrive.\nSeveral storm systems will bring much-needed snowfall to many ski resorts across British Columbia in the coming days.\nMUST SEE: Winter to finally show up in January as El Niño bested by polar vortex\nA very mild December has made it difficult for many resorts to build a solid snow base. Whistler is running well below average snowfall for this time of year. An average season would see more than 10 metres of snow, and this season so far, we have only seen 20 per cent of it. However, there is an opportunity to change this over the next seven-day period.\nSki resorts on the North Shore Mountains will be rejoicing also by the weekend, with more than 30 cm of snow possible to accumulate on the slopes by the weekend.\nMetro Vancouver will see the influence of the warm ocean temperatures nearby, keeping the temperature above the freezing mark when the systems move through. However, North Vancouver and higher terrain around the city, above 800 metres, will see snow.\nThe timing will come in a few different rounds of precipitation.\nOn Thursday throughout the day we will see rain for Metro Vancouver and snow above 1200 metres. The precipitation will diminish by the overnight hours. The next system will bring much heavier rainfall rates and snow above 800 metres, beginning on Friday morning and continuing through Saturday morning.\nThe Interior will also see snow in several rounds through the weekend with driving conditions compromised in all passes throughout both Friday and Saturday.\nGive yourself lots of extra time if travelling along any of the passes, especially the Rogers and Eagles routes along the Trans-Canada Highway.\nThe coldest air will sneak down from the North on Sunday and progressively get colder into the middle of the week, with temperatures in northern B.C. getting down into the -20s and feeling close to the -30s.\nA couple of systems are expected early or mid-next week. There is the potential for a significant system around Tuesday. Snow levels will be quite low at the start, so we are watching for the chance for some wet snow across the lower terrain near the coast Sunday night or Monday.\nSubstantial snow is likely for ski areas next week, and temperatures will be cold enough for making snow. A colder pattern is expected to continue through mid-January.\nStay tuned to The Weather Network for the latest forecast updates across B.C.",

    "text": "[SkyTG24](https://tg24.sky.it/salute-e-benessere/2024/11/07/covid-dolore-cronico)ha riportato i dettagli sullo [studio](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.10.24.24316018v1.full.pdf). Dall’inizio della pandemia la sofferenza cronica si è diffusa sempre di più, arrivando a riguardare quasi il 25% degli adulti negli USA nel 2023. La causa di tutto ciò è legata al long-Covid, una sindrome caratterizzata da sintomi che in alcuni casi persistono per settimane o mesi dopo la guarigione dall’infezione. Tuttavia, questo non basta a spiegarne la crescita. Infatti, un nuovo studio ha analizzato i dati raccolti negli Stati Uniti ed ha confermato che nel 2019 e 2021, circa il 21% degli adulti americani riferiva di soffrire di indolenzimento persistente. Nel 2023 la percentuale risulta essere salita al 24%. Tale incremento suggerisce che circa 10 milioni di adulti in più ne hanno sofferto, rispetto al 2019. Emerge, inoltre, che sono incrementati vari tipi di dolore localizzati in diverse aree del corpo, tra questi: mal di testa, dolori alla schiena, spalle e addome. Denti e mandibola non hanno mostrato variazioni significative. Questa problematica ha interessato uomini e donne di tutte le fasce d’età. Ma cos’altro dicono i ricercatori? Dichiarano che il 15% dell’incremento è attribuibile al long-Covid , perché i sintomi di questa sindrome includono il malessere corporeo. Gli altri fattori legati sono ad esempio: l’isolamento sociale ed il minore accesso alle cure per la gestione dei dolori che potrebbero averne favorito la trasformazione, da acuto a cronico. Infine, è possibile che i lockdown e la maggiore sedentarietà abbiano accresciuto il rischio di sviluppare indolenzimenti di tipo articolare e muscolare.",

    "title": "Boeing va a la huelga por primera vez en 16 años",
    "text": "El sindicato de los trabajadores de Boeing en en la región de Seattle (EE.UU.) ha convocado una huelga por primera vez en 16 años y ha rechazado la oferta del fabricante para subir un 25% los salarios.Según recoge DPA, el 94,65% de los trabajadores votaron que no a la oferta que lanzó Boeing para evitar los paros, que contemplaba una subida salarial del 25% en cuatro años, mejorar en las coberturas sanitarias y las jubilaciones, dado que el sindicato IAM había pedido inicialmente un incremento del 40% en los salarios. Además, el 96% apoyó la convocatoria de huelga.La huelga ha comenzado a las 00.00 hora local de este viernes para unos 30.000 trabajadores. Los representantes sindicales han señalado en una rueda de prensa recogida por \\u0027Bloomberg\\u0027 que los puntos del acuerdo no eran lo suficientemente buenos y que la oferta no compensaba los 16 años de estancamiento salarial, el aumento de los gastos sanitarios y la deslocalización de miles de empleos sindicales.Por su parte, Boeing ha emitido un comunicado en el que muestra su compromiso para restablecer la relación con los trabajadores y el sindicato, además de volver a la mesa para alcanzar un nuevo acuerdo.Boeing atraviesa una crisis de reputación, de seguridad y económica desde 2019, cuando dos aviones 737 MAX sufrieron accidentes fatales. Tras esto, se han producido otros incidentes, como la caída de una parte del fuselaje de un avión de Alaska Airlines a principios de este año.",
