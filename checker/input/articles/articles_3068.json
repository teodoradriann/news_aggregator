    "text": "MARYVILLE, Tenn. — Don't call it a comeback. Rocky Williams, the owner of Maryville-based Rocky's Jamaica Sunrise, isn't cooking out of a storefront restaurant right now. But,\ncustomers are rallying around his family to bring back a Blount County favorite.\nRocky, along with his wife Cheryl Williams, brought the flavors of the Caribbean to Blount County in 2010. They've operated out of two brick-and-mortar locations during their tenure but had to shut down earlier this year.\nThey said the rising costs of doing business are to blame. Despite the rising costs, Rocky hasn't stopped working or cooking. He's setting his sights on a food truck and is working on raising $5,000 to get it on the road.\nRocky said a food truck doesn't have any overhead costs and customers are donating to a GoFundMe page started less than a month ago.\n\"Everybody wants me to set up at their parking lots when we get it,\" Rocky said. \" A lot of different places, doctor offices.\"\nRocky's food, like his jerk chicken, macaroni and cheese, red beans and rice and his well-known hot sauce will be served at the food truck. Since shuttering the brick-and-mortar location, Rocky and Cheryl have done a few catering orders for customers.\n\"I miss cooking for them,\" Rocky said, referring to his customers.\nThe supporters of Rocky's Jamaica Sunrise are what kept them in business for the past 14 years. The couple is touched by the support they've received in the past month.\n\"It means a lot because, I mean, a lot for them because they miss the food, you know, it is different from everybody else's food,\" Rocky said. \"Jamaican food, you can't get it anywhere in Maryville or Alcoa.\"\nRocky isn't one to sit still and has been working shifts at Rubbermaid over the past few weeks. Cheryl, a Maryville native, said the initial goal of their fundraiser is to raise $5,000. The money is a down payment on the food truck, which will take a few months to build.\n\"It shocked me to see how Blount County supported us,\" Cheryl said. \"I mean, I knew they would come out and thought they loved it. And they supported us, but when I saw (the GoFundMe), I was just, I was amazed.\"\nCheryl said people don't have to donate to the GoFundMe if they aren't able to. They can also show support by sharing\nsocial media posts about Rocky's Jamaica Sunrise. The Williams will give back to supporters, too.\n\"So once we get the food truck, the first day that we set up, we're going to give out free samples to everybody to give back for helping us to get the food truck,\" she said.",

    "text": "MONTRÉAL — Trois hôtels à Québec, Montréal et Sherbrooke sont touchés par au moins une journée de grève ce jeudi. Les hôtels Bonaventure à Montréal, Pur à Québec et Delta à Sherbrooke sont cette fois touchés. Dans le cas de l’hôtel Pur, à Québec, la grève avait débuté mercredi et aura lieu aussi vendredi, donc durant trois jours, indique la CSN. Ces journées de grève s’inscrivent dans le cadre de la négociation coordonnée que mène la Fédération du commerce, affiliée à la CSN. Par ce type de négociation, la fédération cherche à obtenir un règlement dans un premier hôtel, puis à le généraliser dans d’autres hôtels, même s’il s’agit d’employeurs différents. Jusqu’ici toutefois, il n’y a eu aucun règlement, bien que cette négociation coordonnée dure depuis des mois. Au total, une trentaine d’hôtels sont concernés par cette négociation à la Fédération du commerce. Les travailleurs de plusieurs hôtels avaient déjà débrayé ensemble, la même journée, les 8 août et 30 août. Le litige porte sur les salaires et les assurances collectives. Les syndiqués réclament un rattrapage salarial, estimant avoir fait des sacrifices durant la pandémie de la COVID-19, lorsque la situation était particulièrement difficile pour les hôteliers. Ils revendiquent 36 % d’augmentation sur quatre ans, dont 15 % dès la première année. Les employeurs estiment que leurs offres sont déjà raisonnables. L’Association hôtelière du Grand Montréal a déjà indiqué que les offres faites par les hôteliers «sont très intéressantes» et que les conditions de travail des employés «sont déjà très bonnes».",

    "text": "Firefighters continued gaining ground fighting the Post Fire in the Gorman area north of Los Angeles Sunday with containment growing to 83% overnight, up from 79% a day earlier.\nFurther, the fire’s size continues to hold steady at 15,690 acres, according to Cal Fire.\nWith the weather heating up, more than 950 firefighters continued to focus on protecting critical infrastructure and recreation areas throughout the fire footprint. Crews were also working to identify and address pockets of fire and heat within interior portions of the burned area, along roads, and the Interstate 5 corridor, according to the agency.\nHot and dry weather is expected through the weekend, with temperatures nearly triple-digits possible. There was a slight chance of thunderstorms Sunday bringing minimal rain to the area.\nAs of Saturday evening, evacuation orders remained in place for the area south of Gorman Post Road, west of the 5 Freeway, east of the L.A. County line and north of Pyramid Lake. Evacuation warnings were in effect south of Pyramid Lake, west of the 5 Freeway, east of the county line and north of Templin Highway.\nThe fire started just before 2 p.m. June 15, prompting the evacuation of about 1,200 people from the Hungry Valley State Vehicular Recreation Area.\nCal Fire officials reported two structures destroyed in the blaze and one damaged. One destroyed structure was commercial and one was a house. A house was also damaged.\nAuthorities are officially reporting one injury from the fire, although no details were released.\nThe blaze is being battled by a unified command that includes the U.S. Forest Service, Angeles National Forest, the Los Angeles County Fire Department and Ventura County Fire Department. The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, California State Park Services, Los Angeles County Office of Emergency Management, Cal Fire and California Highway Patrol were also providing support.\n“Crews continue making progress on the perimeter of the Post Fire … allowing teams to focus more on the interior terrain,” officials said in their Thursday morning update. “Crews continue seeking out isolated smoke and heat sources that produced small flare ups (Wednesday). Increased temperatures are expected over the next several days and into the weekend which make these areas a priority.”\nThe South Coast Air Quality Management District issued a wildfire smoke advisory for the Santa Clarita and Castaic areas, with northwesterly winds expected to push smoke from the fire southeast toward Santa Clarita, the San Fernando Valley and parts of the Angeles National Forest.\nThe SCAQMD advised people in the area to limit their exposure by remaining indoors with windows and doors closed or by seeking immediate shelter, avoid vigorous physical activity and to run their air conditioners or air purifiers.\n“It’s best to avoid using swamp coolers or whole house fans that bring in outside air,” the agency said. “Residents should also avoid burning wood in their fireplaces or firepits. And, if they absolutely must be outside, a properly fit N95 mask or P100 respirator may provide some protection.\nThe Post Fire started at Ralph’s Ranch and Gorman School roads, near the Golden State (5) Freeway, Los Angeles County Fire Department spokesman Craig Little told City News Service.\nThe cause remains under investigation.",

    "title": "ISIS terrorists arrested in Maharashtra have been sharing ‘DIY kits’ with contacts, have taken ‘oath of allegiance’ to serve caliphate: What NIA chargesheet says",
    "text": "In a significant revelation, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Thursday said that members of the Maharashtra Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) terror module had been sharing “DIY (Do It Yourself) kits” with their contacts committed to propagating the extremist and violent ideology of the global terrorist organisation within India. The accused were also found to be raising funds to finance their terror plans and designs, as mentioned by the NIA in its charge-sheet against six persons to tighten its noose further around the ISIS terror conspiracy in India. “NIA investigations so far in the Maharashtra ISIS terror module case (NIA RC-02/2023/NIA/MUM) have revealed a larger conspiracy with international linkages and the involvement of foreign-based ISIS handlers,” states the charge-sheet “The investigations have also exposed a complex network of individuals committed to propagating the extremist and violent ideology of ISIS within India.” Those chargesheeted have been identified as Tabish Nasser Siddiqui of Mumbai, Zulfikar Ali Barodawala alias Lalabhai, Sharjeel Shaikh and Aakif Ateeque Nachan of Borivali-Padgha, as well as Zubair Noor Mohammad Shaikh alias Abu Nusaiba and Adnanali Sarkar of Pune. As per the NIA, all the accused are members of the proscribed ISIS outfit and had “hatched a conspiracy to further the terrorist activities of organisation, with the intention to strike fear and terror amongst the people and threaten the security of India its secular ethos and culture and the democratic system of governance.” Two of these accused, Zulfikar Ali Barodawala and Aakif Ateeque Nachan, were earlier also chargesheeted in the Pune ISIS module case for fabrication of IEDs for triggering blasts. The accused, chargesheeted before the NIA Special Court, Mumbai, under various sections of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and the Indian Penal Code, were engaged in actively propagating the violent and extremist ideology of the ISIS and in carrying out acts preparatory to terrorist violence through recruitment of individuals to the organisation and its cause. Two accused, Tabish and Zulfikar, had taken an oath of allegiance (Bayath) to the self-styled Khalifa (leader) of the ISIS. The NIA Mumbai Branch also found the accused in possession of incriminating material related to Hijrah to Syria, along with propaganda magazines like ‘Voice of Hind’ and ‘Voice of Khurasan’ published by the ISIS. “Further, the accused had been sharing DIY (Do It Yourself) kits with their contacts. The accused were also found to be raising funds to finance their terror plans and designs, as per NIA investigations,” said the anti-terror agency in the charge-sheet. The case was registered by NIA Mumbai on June 28 this year against Tabish Nasser Siddiqui and others, following information received by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) regarding a conspiracy hatched by them to disturb the unity, integrity, security and sovereignty of the country, and to wage a war against the government of India by promoting the terrorist activities of ISIS. Further investigations in the case are continuing in accordance with the provisions of section 173(8) of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). It is noted that ISIS, also known by the names Islamic State (IS), Islamic State of Iraq and Levant (ISIL), Daish, Islamic State in Khorasan Province (ISKP), ISIS Wilayat Khorasan, and Islamic State of Iraq and Sham Khorasan (ISIS-K), has been operating through various modules to spread terror across India.

    "text": "( MENAFN - IANS) New Delhi, July 11 (IANS) Union Minister of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Wednesday reviewed the progress in the sowing of the country's kharif crops and directed officials to step up efforts to enhance the production of pulses.\nAs part of the goal to achieve self-sufficiency in pulse production, the minister reiterated that the Centre is committed to 100 per cent procurement for Urad, Arhar and Masur in all the states and called for generating awareness on the issue so that more and more farmers come forward for pulse cultivation.\nHe expressed happiness over the 50 per cent increase in the area of pulses cultivation during ongoing Kharif sowing this year, particularly for Tur and Urad.\nCurrently, pulses have to be imported to meet the shortfall in demand and prices of the crucial protein tend to firm up, adding to food inflation.\nThe minister was also briefed about the status of the monsoon, groundwater situation and availability of seeds and fertilisers.\nThe Union Minister also stressed the timely availability of fertilisers, both for Kharif and Rabi crops. The Department of Fertilisers was advised to ensure the availability of DAP fertiliser in accordance with the demand of states.\nSecretary, Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Sanjeev Chopra along with senior officials of the Ministry, officials from the Meteorological Department, Central Water Commission and Department of Fertilisers were also present during the meeting.\nMENAFN11072024000231011071ID1108432544",

    "text": "MADURAI: Thousands of devotees thronged the Tiruparangunram Sri Subramania Swamy Temple in Madurai on Friday to witness the grand car festival, also known as the 'Rath Yatra'. The devotees gathered at the temple to pull the chariot of Subrahmanya Swamy and Lord Deivanai as part of the Panguni Uthiram festival held at Tiruparangunram Sri Subramania Swamy Temple on Friday.The procession commenced at 5:40 a.m. with a beautifully adorned wooden chariot carrying the idols of Lord Subramania Swamy and Goddess Deivanai in exquisite attire. It departed from the Urchavar Subramania Swamy sanctuary towards the temple gate, making a brief stop at the sanctum sanctorum of the guardian deity 'Karuppasamy' for a special puja.After special pujas were performed by the temple priests, devotees pulled the main chariot and chanted the mantras of Lord Deivanai. The festival was attended by people from 48 villages, locals and many others from across the state. Following this, heavy security arrangements were made for the peaceful procession. Panguni Uthiram is a significant Tamil Hindu festival observed during the full moon of the Panguni month, which falls between March 14 and April 13. This festival aligns with the transit of the moon through the Uttiram nakshatram (asterism) in the twelfth month of the Tamil calendar, Panguni. It coincides with the Hindu month of Phalguna/Chaitra. Panguni marks the conclusion of the solar Tamil calendar year, ushering in the beginning of the next new Tamil year. Panguni Uthiram is considered auspicious for Tamil Hindus worldwide. The festival is also associated with various mythological events, like the weddings of lord Shiva and goddess Parvati, lord Ram and goddess Sita and lord Murugan (Kartikeya) and Devasena.",
