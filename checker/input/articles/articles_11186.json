    "text": "TEGUCIGALPA, HONDURAS.- Honduras tendrá un fin de semana lluvioso y bajo alertas producto de una vaguada, mientras se mantiene la amenaza de que dos [sistemas de baja presión](https://www.elheraldo.hn/honduras/pronostican-lluvias-para-fin-de-semana-en-sur-suroccidente-de-honduras-OL22386338) ingresen al territorio nacional la próxima semana. Así lo informó el pronosticador del Centro Nacional de Estudios Atmosféricos, Oceanográficos y Sísmicos ([Cenaos](https://www.elheraldo.hn/cronologia/-/meta/cenaos)), José Pavón, quien manifestó que actualmente se está realizando una vigilancia constante de las condiciones climáticas en las costas del Pacífico y el Atlántico. Según lo indicado por Pavón, para la próxima semana se espera el impacto de dos fenómenos de baja categoría. Uno de estos sistemas de baja presión se localiza en el Pacífico, cerca de la costa sur de Nicaragua, mientras que el segundo avanza en el Atlántico con posible impacto en Haití, Cuba y República Dominicana, aunque podría generar lluvias en la región oriental de Honduras. “El sistema en el Pacífico podría dejar fuertes lluvias en la zona sur y suroccidental del país”, explicó Pavón. Estas lluvias intensas elevan el riesgo de inundaciones y deslizamientos, especialmente en comunidades vulnerables. Mientras tanto, el sistema del Atlántico, aunque se dirige hacia el Caribe, podría traer precipitaciones a lo largo del litoral atlántico. “El comité de alerta ha estado vigilando el radar y enviando reportes al ministro y a los subcomisionados para mantener medidas preventivas”, explicó Pavón. Alerta verde en dos departamentos Mientras para la próxima semana se esperan estos pronósticos, para este sábado y domingo la jornada de lluvias continuará. La Secretaría de Gestión de Riesgos y Contingencias Nacionales (Copeco) emitió este viernes una alerta verde de 48 horas para los departamentos de Valle y Choluteca, debido a lluvias y chubascos con actividad eléctrica en la zona sur del país. Una vaguada asociada a un sistema de baja presión cerca de Nicaragua podría intensificar las precipitaciones, según detalla el informe. Este rotativo conoció que las alertas pueden intensificarse durante el fin de semana.",

    "text": "How Adam-12 helped turn Mark Harmon from a college football standout into a TV star A link to Ozzie and Harriet helped boost his decade-long career, too. One doesn't become the \"Sexiest Man Alive\" overnight. People bestowed that title upon Mark Harmon in 1986. The St. Elsewhere hunk became just the second man to earn the title, following, erm, Mel Gibson. By then, the thirtysomething actor was no newcomer. Networks had been handing the handsome California kid headlining television roles for decades. He had been a cop with a dog partner in Sam (1977), and a helicopter rescue hero in 240-Robert (1979). That Sexiest Man Alive honor took him to another level. Harmon was playing a game of basketball when he found out. The other fellows had [taped covers of the magazine to the backboard](https://people.com/celebrity/mark-harmon-peoples-sexiest-man-alive-1986/) to rib their buddy. He may have been on the court when he learned of his supreme sexiness, but Harmon was best known for his achievements on the football field. After putting two years in a community college, Harman made the leap to the big time at the University of California, Los Angeles. He was a quarterback of course. Just look at the guy. As QB, Harmon led UCLA in the 1972 and 1973 seasons. In his first game as a starter (which took place days before the above photo) the slinger led the Bruins to a shocking upset over two-time defending champions Nebraska. Being a photogenic college athlete just miles away from Hollywood studios can certainly lead to a screen career, but Harmon can truly thank two people for his television stardom — his sister Kristin and Dragnet creator Jack Webb. Let's start with the former. Kristin was undoubtedly the envy of American girls when she married teen idol Ricky Nelson in 1963. She was a teenager at the time. (Fun aside: Mark's other sister, Kelly, married John DeLorean, the automobile innovator.) Being married to Ricky had its perks, specifically a role on The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet. She made her first appearance as Kris Nelson on the era-defining sitcom in 1963. Mark was just 12 at the time, and not quite ready for his primetime debut. However, in 1973, a forgotten reboot, Ozzie's Girls, brought Ozzie and Harriet back to (syndicated) television. Through his sister, Harmon nabbed a walk-on role in 1973, his screen debut. Kristin Nelson had just one other significant recurring role on television — playing Jean Reed, the wife of Officer Jim Reed (Kent McCord) on Adam-12. It just so happens that Harmon solidified his acting career playing a \"partner\" of Jim Reed, too. After UCLA, an uncertain Harmon turned down offers to go pro, dabbled with law school, worked at an ad agency, and sold shoes. Finally, still feeling the bite of the acting bug from his tiny role on Ozzie's Girls, Harmon sought advice from Jack Webb, the creator of Dragnet and Adam-12. Webb himself helped Harmon secure guest spots on his shows Emergency! and Adam-12. Harmon ended up with an entire episode named after his character, \"Gus Corbin.\" The story came late in the show's run, just two episodes before the finale. When Malloy is otherwise occupied, Reed finds himself working with a new partner, Gus (Harmon, naturally). Alas, that episode did not feature his sister, Kristin. She can be seen before and after his turn in the squad car. Forty-five years later, Harmon is still playing law enforcement on NCIS. Let's see who People picks for the cover later this year.

    "title": "Weather service issues historic December flood warning for Red River",
    "text": "The slow-moving storm system that let loose 3 inches of rain over Fargo this week has prompted the National Weather Service to issue an unprecedented flood warning for the Red River in December.\n\"This was an unusual system. It dumped a lot of rain,\" said Brad Hopkins, meteorologist for the National Weather Service (NWS) in Grand Forks, N.D. \"There was really no snowpack to absorb any of that water so it collected in the ditches and eventually flowed into the rivers.\"\nHopkins said Friday that he has pored over weather records as far back as he could and \"unless there's something handwritten by observers in the late 1800s or early 1900s, I cannot find another instance where we've issued a river point flood warning in December.\"\nThe NWS warning issued Thursday for the Red River in Fargo estimated the river would rise above the flood stage of 18 feet Friday and potentially crest at 21 feet on Sunday.\nHopkins said Friday that the river will likely not reach the anticipated crest because the rate of ascent is slowing. By midafternoon Friday, the river was measured at 17.6 feet, which was just shy of the flood stage of 18 feet.\n\"It looks like it's starting to crest just under minor flood stage, but there's still that chance it could bump up right against it,\" Hopkins said.\nFlooding of the Red River has wreaked havoc on the Fargo-Moorhead area in the past few decades, including the April 1997 flood that crested at nearly 40 feet. That flood displaced thousands of residents and devastated the Grand Forks area, ultimately causing about $4 billion in damage .\nSince then, many communities at risk of flooding have implemented mitigation projects . In Fargo, the city purchased and removed more than 200 properties from high-risk areas, improved drainage and installed permanent levees and floodwalls.\nWhen the Red River rises to 17 feet, as it did Friday, water creeps to the edge of the bike path along Elm Street N. in Fargo and crews set up cones to alert pedestrians of possible high water, according to Jody Bertrand, the city's storm utility division engineer. The city on Friday also closed Elm Street N. to traffic between 13th and 15th avenues.\n\"Operations-wise for the flood event, there's very little that changes until we get to a much higher [crest],\" Bertrand said.\nThe forecast of dry weather in the coming days is giving folks peace of mind. And the region is still listed as abnormally dry.\n\"We're still hoping for some snowpack so we can get rid of the drought conditions,\" Bertrand said.\nHopkins said this rare December flood warning shouldn't serve as an indication for spring flooding.\n\"We've still got a long ways to go this winter,\" he said, noting long-range forecasts for the next three months hint at below-average precipitation.\n\"We may be starting the spring flood season on the drier side, which means the impacts would be lesser,\" he said. \"But we'll be watching very closely as we get into the end of January and beginning of February.\"",

    "text": "« Jésus nous accompagne dans nos souffrances »\nLe dimanche des Rameaux et de la Passion marque l’entrée dans la Semaine sainte.\nLa messe est centrée sur le thème de la Passion de Jésus, avec des lectures qui rappellent son obéissance jusqu’à la mort sur la croix.\nCe jour commémore l’entrée de Jésus à Jérusalem, accueilli par une foule en fête, et le souvenir de sa Passion.\nL’Evangile invite à méditer sur l’amour infini de Dieu pour l’humanité et la présence de Jésus à nos côtés dans nos joies et nos souffrances.\nLes rameaux, tenus en main par les fidèles, symbolisent la marche du peuple de Dieu vers Pâques, à la suite du Christ.\n« Le récit de la Passion de Jésus-Christ nous plonge dans les derniers instants du Christ, dans ses souffrances », a rappelé le père Daniel Boué.\n« Pourtant, le Christ est là, à nos côtés, nous accompagnant dans nos épreuves. Quelle belle Espérance pour notre Foi. Quel bel Amour de notre Dieu : Père – Fils – Saint-Esprit ».\nC’est un moment solennel où nous réfléchissons sur la signification profonde de la vie et du sacrifice de Jésus.\n« Nous ne pouvons oublier les violences qui sévissent dans le monde : attentats, conflits, souffrances physiques et morales. »",

    "text": "Dreaming of a White Christmas? The chances are declining for the Twin Cities Meteorologist Sven Sundgaard Fri, December 13, 2024 at 8:17 PM UTC 3 min read\nIf you’re dreaming of a White Christmas in the Twin Cities/ southern Minnesota, keep dreaming and cross your fingers and toes. If we pull it off this year, it’s going to be close.\nClimatologically speaking, we have a White Christmas three out of every four years on average. Of course last year we had quite the opposite of a White Christmas, with over an inch of rain and record high temperatures in the 50s.\nIn 2022 we had 10 inches of snow pack, while 2021 was another Brown Christmas. If we look at the past four years, only two were white and the other two brown.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Sign up for our BREAKING WEATHER newsletters\nThe average snow depth, since the year 2000 is four inches on Dec. 25. While the official climatology is a 75% chance of a White Christmas in the Twin Cities using the 1991-2020 average, since 2000 that has dropped to just 67%.\nNWS You guessed it: climate change is a likely culprit as December is one of our fastest warming months in the state.\nThe big climate trend in recent years is that winter still happens, of course, but gets a later start, which impacts your White Christmas.\nThe Christmas forecast\nUnsplash&plus; Enough with averages. How about the forecast for the next 12 days?\nIf we look at the National Blend of Models, essentially a weighted average of the models, it gives us a pathetic 0.8 inches of TOTAL snowfall between now and Christmas.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement That in itself would be enough as \"white\" is defined by an inch of snow cover and we round up with snow measurements to the nearest whole inch, so technically we’d only need half-an-inch to qualify. I know it’s not quite what people would like to play in, but that’s the technical definition.\nWeatherbell If we zoom out to all the models, they range at giving us anywhere from 1 to 2 total inches in a more optimistic scenario.\nThe other forecast challenge though isn’t just snowfall but temperatures. We’ve had some actual cold weather this winter unlike some recent ones, BUT it’s been a roller coaster. Last weekend was 52 degrees and this weekend we could be near 40 on Sunday again, with a -7 degree reading in between!\nIf the European model verifies, we’re in trouble. There are several above freezing days that would easily melt 0.8 inches of snow.\nWeatherbell If the Canadian model is right, keeping things colder, we may just hang on to a half inch of snow to be defined as \"white.\"\nWeatherbell Without going too in depth, my \"back of a napkin\" calculations based on all the models snowfall and all the models temperatures, I put the probability of that 1/2” of snow depth at about 42%.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement More in Lifestyle Maryland Crab Cakes Vs Baltimore Coddies: What's The Difference?

Each model run is going to be slightly different.\nIf we REALLY want a White Christmas and ample snow to play in, we need to depend on a surprise storm or rather a surprise shift in a storm track. Even in almost 2025, this still happens which makes forecasting fun and challenging!\nBMTN Note: Weather events in isolation can't always be pinned on climate change, but the broader trend of increasingly severe weather and record-breaking extremes seen in Minnesota and across the globe can be attributed directly to the rapidly warming climate caused by human activity. The IPCC has warned that Earth is \"firmly on track toward an unlivable world,\" and says greenhouse gas emissions must be halved by 2030 in order to limit warming to 1.5C, which would prevent the most catastrophic effects on humankind.
