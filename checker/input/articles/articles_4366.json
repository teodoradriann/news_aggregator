    "text": "Biden administration threatens to sue Texas if its strict immigration law is implemented Abbott signed the measure into law earlier this month. The Biden administration on Thursday warned Texas that it would sue the Lone Star state if it implements a law that would allow state officials to arrest immigrants who cross the border illegally. The Justice Department said it would file a lawsuit against the [legislation titled SB4](https://hro.house.texas.gov/pdf/ba884/sb0004.pdf#navpanes=0), by Jan. 3, unless Texas assured the administration that the state would not go through with enforcing the measure. \"Because SB 4 is unconstitutional and will disrupt the federal government's operations, we request that Texas forbear in its enforcement,\" Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian Boynton said in a letter to Texas GOP Gov. Greg Abbott, [according to CBS News.](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/texas-immigration-law-sb4-justice-department-threatens-lawsuit/) Abbott signed the measure into law earlier this month. It is slated to take effect in March of 2024. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and other groups have [already filed lawsuits](https://justthenews.com/government/courts-law/aclu-and-other-groups-sue-texas-over-law-allowing-arrest-illegals-state) against this law. “The bill overrides bedrock constitutional principles and flouts federal immigration law while harming Texans, in particular Brown and Black communities,” said Adriana Piñon, legal director of the ACLU of Texas. National Border Patrol Council President Brandon Judd, meanwhile, praised Abbott's border security measure. \"Border Patrol agents nationwide, not just in Texas, are grateful for Governor Abbott's leadership and willingness to recognize that it is the rule of law that keeps all Americans safe,\" Judd said.",

Post-independence, the Nepal government continues to maintain the Gorkha connection with the Indian Army following the Tripartite Agreement signed between the representatives of the governments of UK, India and Nepal on November 9, 1947.\nLt Gen AK Singh, GOC-in-C Southern Command and President, Gorkha Brigade, Indian Army, who embarked on his Nepal visit Friday, discussed “furtherance in military bilateral relations” between India and Nepal along with bolstering army to army connect with Gen Prabhu Ram Sharma, COAS, Nepal.\n“Lt Gen AK Singh, AVSM, YSM, SM, VSM, GOC-in-C Southern Command & President Gorkha Brigade, IA called on Gen Prabhu Ram Sharma, COAS, @NepaliArmyHQ to discuss furtherance in military bilateral relations of India-Nepal & bolstering Army to Army connect,” the Indian High Commission in Nepal posted on X along with photos from the meeting.\nOn Saturday, the second day of his visit, Lt Gen Singh visited revered MuktiNath Temple, about 375 kms northwest of Kathmandu, and paid obeisance at the ‘Bipin Bell’ installed on February 18 last year in memory of late Gen Bipin Rawat, former COAS of the Indian Army by four former Indian COAS and honorary generals of Nepali Army.\nLater, Lt Gen Singh visited the Welfare & Military Pension Branch, a Polyclinic in Defence Wing at Kathmandu and appreciated the initiatives undertaken for veterans' welfare. He also inaugurated a newly built portion of the Bhartiya Gorkha Sainik Niwas, the Southern Command said.\nEarlier on Friday, the top Army official addressed 3,000 Gorkha Veterans, Veer Naris, widows & dependants at a rally in Pokhara. He also highlighted key welfare issues and honoured Veer Naaris & Gallantry Awardees. At the Pokhra rally, “the General recalled the invaluable sacrifices of our gallant Gorkha veterans and affirmed the continued commitment of IA & GoI for their meaningful welfare,” said another post from the Indian High Commission.\nAt the beginning of his Nepal visit, Lt Gen Singh visited the Embassy of India and interacted with the Indian Ambassador Naveen Srivastava.\nAs per the Indian Embassy’s data, there are over 1.22 Lakh pensioners (of Indian Army) residing in Nepal as on date. “The Government of India has made every effort to ensure that these pensioners, their families and dependents are looked after in the best possible manner,” it said.",
