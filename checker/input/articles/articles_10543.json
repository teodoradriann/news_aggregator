Let's use the community connections. Let's use all that goodwill that came together to try to get Space Command here and offered to continue to support our military families,\" said John Hilgert, the director of the Nebraska Department of Veteran's Affairs.\n211 calls from military members and their families are directed to United Way's navigator, Samantha Kuns, who is a veteran herself.\n\"I've seen it firsthand how well it can work. And just like having Offutt there as well, there's a need out there for these resources,\" Kuns said. \"So, it's a huge thing to be able to connect through offer and through the community side of it as well.\"\nCallers are given 24/7, free, confidential help, connecting them with resources in their community.\n\"It can be anything from mental health to finding food resources to finding tax help. You know, the broad range of anything that a family may need. We have resources available for them,\" said Shawna Forsberg, president and CEO of United Way of the Midlands.\nThe organizations hope this program will help our military community feel safe, comfortable, and supported as they undergo transitions in their lives.",

    "text": "A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and Molldrem Family Dentistry caused her significant injury that is still being corrected.\nAccording to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement.\nMolldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up.\nTreatment called 'inconceivable' Gypsy Rose Blanchard released from Missouri prison early Thursday morning, DOC confirms Cher files for conservatorship of her son, claims Elijah Blue Allman's life is 'at risk' Ex-boyfriend of missing St. Louis woman admits to her murder after Wisconsin arrest: Police 6 dead, 3 injured in Johnson County, Texas, crash; victims include 2 young kids ages 9, 10 California Pizza Huts lay off all delivery drivers ahead of minimum wage increase “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote Dr. Avrum Goldstein, a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit.\nGoldstein, who is a faculty member at NOVA Southeastern University , also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment.\n\"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.”\nDoctors remove wrong organ from man: They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.\nThe lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg.\n“Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote.\nWilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages.\nWilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "text": "Jarvis , la inteligencia artificial experimental de Google , fue filtrada por accidente y es capaz de tomar control de tu navegador. La aplicación se describe a sí misma como un asistente que explora la web para ayudarte a investigar temas, comprar productos, agendar viajes y muchas otras funciones.\nPero no es cualquier otro ayudante con IA. Jarvis es capaz de actuar de manera completamente autónoma e independiente sin la necesidad de intervención humana manual, por lo que en teoría podría tomar el control total de tu navegador web.\nParece que el día del juicio tendrá que esperar un poco más, ya que la versión beta de este pequeño Skynet aún no es completamente funcional, debido a que carece de los permisos de acceso necesarios para utilizar todas sus características.\nLa filtración se dio en la tienda de extensiones de Chrome, pero rápidamente fue retirada por Google. Solo algunos pocos usuarios lograron descargar y probar la aplicación. La IA iba a ser originalmente revelada en el mes de diciembre, por lo que aún no sabemos si esta filtración afectará los planes de la compañía.\nExpertos en el área de las inteligencias artificiales sospechan que la iniciativa de Jarvis nace como la respuesta de Google a Claude AI . Esta es una aplicación similar que recientemente ha añadido una función que le daría una similar capacidad de autonomía a la que aspira la extensión de Chrome, pero con un alcance incluso más amplio, ya que se extiende fuera del navegador y puede tomar las riendas de tu PC.\nTal parece que la época de las computadoras autónomas está cada vez más cerca. Solo nos queda rezar porque la humanidad tenga mejor suerte en el mundo real, que en las películas distópicas de Hollywood.\nVía: Engadget",
