    "title": "Re: Frequent WiFi Disconnects",
    "text": "3 weeks ago\nThis latest update with the new sounds seems to have majorly broken wifi - my Google Homes are constantly getting disconnected from wifi.\nEvery other device is completely fine and working great. It would be great if Google could either add a trigger to search for wifi when the \"sorry, I can't fine the network\" error is triggered, or add a way to reboot the Homes without requiring me to unplug the damned things.\n3 weeks ago\nAfter rebooting, they continue to work normally, until at some arbitrary point they feel that the wifi no longer has that.. je ne sais quoi quality, and decided to disconnect from the world like a college student traveling to Europe.\n2 weeks ago\nHi Midnitte,\nThank you for posting in the community. I'm sorry that you're experiencing troubles with Wifi disconnections with your Google Home devices. I understand how frustrating this can be. I'm here to help.\nBefore I begin, I need to ask some questions for further assistance:\nIn the mean time, some suggested steps to check the Wi-Fi network for your speaker or display to follow:\nPlease keep me posted. I'll look forward to your response.\nRegards,\nByron\na week ago - last edited a week ago\nThis is not isolated. I have 4 google homes 3 home (living room 3ft from router, bathroom, and bedroom 3 feet from mesh) and a home max in the kitchen. The home 3 feet literally from the router multiple times a day says \"I can't find the the wifi network please check your router.\" The same for the bedroom and bath room homes twice a day. The home max in the kitchen never has a problem and its the furthest away. This just started a few week ago and it's maddening!!! Nothing else has a problem, just Google Homes, Router and Wifi are exactly the same. This is INCREDBILE FRUSTRATING!! It is something Google pushed in its code! The only thing that fixes this is unplugging the Homes and re-plugging them into the electricity.\na week ago\nHi GameTheory,\nThank you for reaching out to the community. I'm sorry that you're having troubles with the connections of your Nest Homes. I understand how frustrating this can be. I'm here to help.\nBefore I begin. I need to ask a few questions for better assistance:\nIn the meantime, please try the following:\nSet up a temporary mobile Wi-Fi hotspot.\nPlease keep me posted. I'll look forward to your response.\nRegards,\nByron\na week ago\nHow long did the device work before the connectivity situation started? Many many years (5+) for the three Google Homes.\nHow was the connectivity situation discovered? The 3 Google Home say \"I cannot find the Wi-Fi network please check your router.\"\nDid the device give any visible or audible error? See previous answer.\nHow long did the situation persist before it started to work again? It never resolves itself and after a few hours I unplug the Home and plug it back in again and it works fine immediately after but the problem will come back later in the day.\nHow many times have you experienced this situation? 3 Google Homes have this issue and they each had it 2 times today so I had this happen 6 times in one day!!! One of them sits three feet from the WiFi & router.\nNo other Google devices have this problem. I have 2 Nest Cams and a Nest Audio and they never have problems and no other devices have issues either.\nFriday\nHi GameTheory,\nThank you for your response.\nI just want to confirm. Did you try the above steps to set up a temporary mobile Wi-Fi hotspot?\nLet me know how it goes and keep me posted.\nRegards,\nByron\n26m ago - last edited 25m ago\nOkay yes it does.\nThe Nest Audio and Nest Cams never have this issue. The three round white topped color-based Google Homes do and still do daily. The wifi router and firewall have not has their firmware change. This multiple times a day problem started with the three round white topped color-based Google Homes started at the same time and no devices have physically move. The system firmware for the homes with the issue is (1)the one three feet from the wifi router is 437716, (2) the bed room 437716, and (3) the bathroom 437716. The Nest Audio in the kitchen has the same firmware 437716 and it never has the problem. The 3 with the problem are listed as offline in the Google Home app when the issue is happening. This started when their firmware was updated to 3.74.437716. version https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/7365257?hl=en",

Rest in power, icon.\"\nFaithfull was famously found wearing nothing except a rug at an infamous drugs bust at Rolling Stones guitarist Richards' country house, Redlands, in 1967.\nFollowing her split with Sir Mick, Faithfull spent two years on the streets of Soho while addicted to heroin before living in a squat.\nShe returned to release an album, Broken English, in 1979, which is now regarded as a classic.\nMarianne Faithfull.

    "text": "El 2024 ha comenzado de la mejor manera para el\nVelle, que conseguía una trabajada y bálsamica victoria en la última fecha de la primera vuelta ante uno de los gallitos de la competición, 2-0 al Portonovo SD, en un partido igualado y en el que ambos conjuntos tuvieron oportunidades para estrenar el casillero, inclinándose hacía el bando local en la recta final.\nPara comenzar, sorpresa relativa en la alineación inicial de Peluso, que volvió a rotar la portería, entrando Nacho en sustitución de Valencia, como ocurrió varias jornadas atrás y con otra novedad, el debut ante la parroquia local de Fernando, que cuajó una buena actuación.\nDesde el pitido inicial, el Velle salió enchufado y tuvo en las botas de Adrián Blanco el primer gol cuando se llevaba apenas un minuto de juego. Combinación perfecta entre Brais Outeiriño desde la derecha que cede a Hugo Rodríguez y este a su vez filtra a Adrían , que la estrella en Conde, meta visitante. El Portonovo, tras el arreón inicial local, se sacudía la presión y el dominio, comenzando a generar peligro desde el flanco derecho. Desde ahí llegaban dos asistencias en el minuto 11 y 13 que terminarían en sendo disparos desde la frontal de Lucas y Hugo Soto, los dos encontrando respuesta en un seguro Nacho.\nLos locales no se quedarían atrás y emularían a los visitantes también desnivelando por la misma banda, con un Brais Outeiriño que ganaba por velocidad la partida a la defensa rival y que en una de estas se encontraba con Conde en la segunda oportunidad clara para los locales. Mario Langa a la salida de un córner la tuvo en el 19, emulando otro cabezazo del foráneo Renda en el 15. La alternancia continuó siendo un hecho durante toda la primera mitad y el propio Brais Outeiriño seguía haciendo de las suyas: centro al área que no encontraba a Hugo y Jorge lo probaba desde lejos. Los visitantes tuvieron la última en una “rosquita” desde el vértice derecho del área de Dieguito que Nacho desviaba a córner.\nTras una vistosa y entretenida primera parte, el choque entró en tedio en el arranque de la segunda, en el que el ritmo lento y la falta de ocasiones primaron sobre el espectáculo, siendo el Portonovo un poco mejor. Todo cambió en el minuto 59 con la entrada en el campo de Beni, Xaco y Raúl Dinis, que le dieron más verticalidad y ritmo al ataque de los de Peluso.\nLos tres fueron protagonistas en el partido. Xaco avisaba desde fuera del área, Raúl Dinis desequilibraba desde la derecha y a punto estuvo de sorprender a Conde en sendas internadas. Lo bueno quedó para el final y tras un disparo de Hugo Soto que chapó nuevamente Nacho, los locales reclamaría penalti por una caída en el área. Las protestas se convirtieron en aplausos cuando Caneiro abría el melón en el 80 con un tiro cruzado.\nLa sentencia\nCon el 1-0, los visitantes se volcaron con balones colgados que una segura defensa local repelía una y otra vez. Aprovechando la velocidad de sus extremos, el Velle pudo sellar de forma brillante su triunfo en la última jugada del partido. Beni a pase de Raúl Dinis establecía el definitivo 2-0 y la puerta para seguir soñando con la permanencia en esta Preferente.",

    "text": "New Delhi: Ebbing El Nino effect and projected normal monsoon are likely to boost agriculture sector growth to 3.7 per cent in the current financial year from a sluggish 1.4 per cent expansion recorded in the previous year, a survey conducted by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) showed on Thursday.\nAs per the latest round of FICCI’s Economic Outlook Survey, India’s gross domestic product (GDP) is likely to post an annual growth of 6.8 per cent in the first half of the current financial year. The GDP growth is likely to accelerate to 7.2 per cent in the second half of the fiscal year, taking the average for the whole financial year 2024-25 to 7 per cent.\nServices sector is projected to grow at 7.4 per cent while the growth in the industry sector is estimated at 6.7 per cent for the current financial year.\nThe survey is based on responses from leading economists representing industry, banking and financial services sector, as per a statement issued by FICCI.\nIndia’s GDP grew by 8.2 per cent during the financial year ended March 2024, as per the latest government data. Major organisations including the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) have pegged India’s growth for the current fiscal year at 7 per cent.\nInflation\nAs per the FICCI survey, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) based retail inflation is likely to remain in the range of 4.4 per cent to 5 per cent. The median forecast for CPI based inflation has been put at 4.5 per cent. “While food prices remain sticky with inflation inching up in cereals, fruits and milk, the survey participants expect easing of prices in the second quarter with kharif output reaching the market,” FICCI said in the survey report.\nThe surveyed economists expect that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) would cut policy repo rate by 50 basis points to 6 per cent by the end of the current financial year. Majority of the economists are of the view that a cut in the repo rate is expected only in the “latter half of the current fiscal year as RBI is expected to continue with its cautious approach keeping a close watch on the inflation trajectory,” FICCI said.\nUrban employment boost\nOn the Union Budget 2024-25, the participating economists indicated that the forthcoming budget is expected to introduce comprehensive measures to boost employment and enhance workforce capabilities.\nAnnouncement of an Employment-linked incentive scheme, introduction of an urban counterpart of MGNREGA (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act), increased investments in labour skilling programmes and soft infrastructure, and implementation of targeted policies and support systems to increase female labour force participation are some of suggestions highlighted by the surveyed economists.\nFinance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman scheduled to present the Union Budget 2024-25 on July 23.\nAs per the surveyed economists, the agriculture sector is expected to receive greater attention in the upcoming budget. The economists proposed creation of reform-linked incentives for states to implement agricultural reforms and improve efficiency; increased support for developing weather-resistant crops and implementing adaptive measures against climate effects; measures to improve storage infrastructure; and establishment of a price forecasting mechanism for non-MSP crops to strengthen the agri-supply chain.\nADVERTISEMENT Published 18 July 2024, 21:18 IST",
