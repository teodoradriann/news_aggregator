    "title": "Abandoned UK race track built on RAF runway discovered in amazing condition",
    "text": "An explorer has shared pictures of a long forgotten race track she rediscovered after hearing about it online. The race track, once known as Long Marston Raceway, was built on the runway of RAF Long Marston in Stratford-upon-Avon and opened in 1980 where it hosted drag races. Although it was abandoned, it remains untouched and still in place are the stands, where fans once watched from, toilets and offices. The track still has all of its stop and start lines intact. Explorer Chloe Urbex, 23, said: “This is one I had assumed had been demolished but recently I saw a few posts on it so when we was looking at an abandoned house down the road we took a quick mooch around here. Long Marston Raceway “The raceway &quot;It opened in 1980, opening with the name Long Marston Raceway. It was renamed Avon Park Raceway in 1990 and finally renamed Shakespeare County Raceway in 2008. The new housing estate is slowly getting closer and closer to I&#039;d imagine in a year this one will be gone.&quot; Long Marston Raceway The track was closed and sold in 2018 to make way for a new housing estate and has sat derelict ever since. Pictures showed how to the side of the course are mountains of sand, used incase of fires. There are still advertisements attached to the old boards, as well as the stands looking over the track. Long Marston Raceway One fan said: “Some of my best childhood memories are at that place.” Another added: &quot;Gutted this place wasn&#039;t allowed to continue running, loved going down to the Halloween bash. Great memories.&quot; Another said: &quot;I was there in the early 90s, it was always a great track and a great atmosphere.&quot; Long Marston Raceway One more fan: &quot;Wow, this is so sad. I used to run my bike down that strip in the 90s at the Bulldog bash. Brilliant place with a lot of happy memories. So very sad it&#039;s falling victim to more houses.&quot; Earlier this month pictures were shared of the Munich Olympiastadion, which was once a bustling sports hub in the heart of Germany and has been left untouched for several years. Nestled in the centre of the Olpmpiapark Munchen, construction for the stadium began in 1968 and it was officially opened in May 1972, just in time for the Summer Olympics. The city of Munich won its Olympic bid back in 1966, beating out Detroit, Madrid and Montreal.",

    "text": "More than 2,000 county lines have been dismantled in the last 18 months, as the government hits its target of closing thousands of these criminal networks early. [Data published](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/county-lines-programme/county-lines-programme-overview) this month shows the ambitious three-year target, made in the government's 10-year drug strategy, has been achieved in just a year and a half, with dedicated police taskforces from the County Lines Programme arresting senior line holders and breaking the gangs that terrorise communities. Between April 2022 and September this year, over 4,000 arrests have been made, whilst 4,800 vulnerable people caught up in these vile operations have been offered support to turn their lives around. Between April and September 2023, over 700 lines were dismantled, 1,300 arrests made and 1,600 victims were supported. These results demonstrate the relentless targeting of county lines by the police, who are persistently closing them down as they appear. The government is also keeping the dangerous criminals behind these gangs locked up for longer, ensuring they are off our streets and stopping them re-opening drug networks. Home Secretary James Cleverly said: County lines gangs are some of the most vile, exploitative criminals in this country, lining their pockets at the expense of countless vulnerable lives. We set a target of taking down 2,000 lines in three years, which we have delivered in half the time. We will go even further to shut down these criminal enterprises and help victims to turn their lives around. The Home Office launched the County Lines Programme in 2019 to tackle the harmful drug supply model which devastates lives through exploitation, coercion and violence. County lines gangs often target the most vulnerable people, manipulating and coercing them into debt, and forcing them to transport and sell drugs. A key part of the County Lines Programme lies in victim support to ensure that young people and their families have the support they need as they escape these gangs. Since the start of the programme, the Home Office has invested up to £5 million in support services like [Catch22](https://www.catch-22.org.uk/find-services/county-lines-support-and-rescue/) and Missing People, who carry out crucial work to help vulnerable individuals and families. Catch22 provides specialist support and rescue services for young people and their families who are criminally exploited through county lines. One vulnerable young person who has turned their back on county lines criminality due to Catch22's work is Liam*. Liam was referred to Catch22 by social services after a raid at his home found his mother and brother in possession of Class A and Class B drugs, alongside £3,000 in cash. A subsequent raid found 11 bags of cannabis and weapons. Care workers were concerned that Liam was going down the same path as his family and referred him to Catch22 for support. Whilst Liam was resistant to support at first, Catch22 were able to build a relationship with him and help him understand the dangers of getting involved in county lines and drug use and how to recognise and avoid criminal exploitation. Liam never missed a session with Catch22 and his attendance and performance at college subsequently improved. He has now moved onto a construction college, knowing that support is there if he is struggling. Liam is just one of hundreds of young people who have been supported by Home Office-funded victim support services since 2022 and shows that vulnerable, hard-to-reach people can, with support, make different choices and turn their backs on a life of criminality. The government has committed to increasing police funding to tackle criminal activity like county lines and this month announced the 2024-25 provisional police funding settlement which will give police forces in England and Wales up to £922 million additional funding next year, should Police and Crime Commissioners choose to take full advantage of police precept flexibility. In addition to this, over £200 million will be invested in priority projects next year, including continued work to tackle county lines. The government has also delivered on its manifesto commitment to recruit 20,000 additional officers by March 2023, bolstering police action against these gangs with a record high of almost 150,000 officers across England and Wales. *Liam is not the victim's real name, which has been changed to protect his identity.

    "text": "THE Ultimate wing-off\n'I Compared The New Wings At Popeyes To Wingstop. I Couldn't Believe Who Won — And By A Near-Landslide'\nWingstop is the King of Wings in the fast-food world. The chain, which has more than 1,800 locations in the US, is unstoppable.\nSo, when\nPopeyes expanded its permanent menu to include chicken wings in late November, it seemed fitting to see how they stacked up to the No. 1 player in the category.\nBusiness Insider's correspondent, Nancy Luna, compared\nWingstop to Popeyes and was stunned by the results.\n[We compared four flavors at Wingstop to similar flavors at Popeyes. Nancy Luna/Business Insider]\nWingstop sells 12 flavors of wings. Popeyes offers five flavors. The Popeyes vs. Wingstop matchups went as follows:\n-\nRoasted Garlic Parmesan vs. Garlic Parmesan.\n-\nHoney BBQ vs. Hickory Smoked BBQ.\n-\nGhost Pepper vs. Louisiana Rub.\n-\nSweet 'N Spicy vs. Spicy Korean Q.\n[Wingstop prices are a tad higher per wing than Popeyes. Nancy Luna/Business Insider]\nWingstop's prices per wing are a tad higher than Popeyes.\nAt Popeyes, six a la carte wings are $6.99, or roughly $1.17 per wing. At Wingstop, the smallest a la carte box is 10 pieces for $12.99. That's about $1.30 per wing.\nBoth chains took about 20 minutes to prepare my order.\n[Roasted Garlic wings at Popeyes show red flakes, indicating I might feel some heat. Nancy Luna/Business Insider]\nThe Roasted Garlic Parmesan wings at Popeyes were crazy delicious. The asiago cheese mixed into the sauce gave the wings a nice smoky flavor.\nThe cheesy garlic sauce was soaked in the deep-fried coating of the wing, making for a delicious crunchy bite. There's a bit of unexpected heat that comes with these wings, as well.\n[The Garlic Parmesan wings at Wingstop were heavily dusted in cheese. Nancy Luna/Business Insider]\nLuna thought the\nGarlic Parmesan wings at Wingstop would be superior to Popeyes because it's such a classic flavor.\nBut the wings were a total letdown, from presentation to taste. The wings are also noticeably smaller than Popeyes.\n[The Sweet 'N Spicy wings are swimming in chili oil. Nancy Luna/Business Insider]\nPopeyes said the Sweet 'N Spicy wings, tested earlier this year, are the chain's \"best performing product since the infamous Chicken Sandwich.\"\nThe wings are bathed in a pool of chili oil. It was sticky tangy goodness in one bite. It was like eating orange chicken but with a lot more heat.\n[Wingstop's Spicy Korean wings were similar in flavor to the Sweet 'N Spicy wings at Popeyes. Nancy Luna/Business Insider]\nThe Spicy Korean Q wings at Wingstop have a similar flavor and heat profile to the Sweet 'N Spicy wings.\nThe Spicy Korean Q wings are described on Wingstop's menu as a \"sweet and spicy\" wing made with ginger, garlic, sriracha, and crushed red pepper. It was nearly identical in taste to Popeyes' Sweet 'N Spicy wings.\n[Wingstop's Louisiana Rub wings were the best of the four we tasted. Nancy Luna/Business Insider]\nThe Louisiana Rub wings at Wingstop were lightly coated in a Cajun seasoning. They were the best wings Luna tried at Wingstop.\nThe Louisiana Rub wings had the perfect amount of heat. The seasoning on the breading also wasn't an afterthought like the Parmesan crumbles on the garlic wings.",

    "title": "Classic MW2 multiplayer mod shut down by Activision day before launch",
    "text": "If you were to ask veteran Call of Duty players what the best game in the series’ long history is, I’d put money on the most popular answer being MW2 . No, not the mediocre reboot that came out a couple of years ago, I’m talking about the original from 2009. Its multiplayer is particularly etched into the memories of millions of CoD fans, and an ambitious new mod was about to revive it. However, just 24 hours before it was set to be released, the team behind the mod has revealed it will never see the light of day because Activision has sent them a cease and desist order.\nThe mod in question is called H2 and it essentially remakes the multiplayer experience from the original Modern Warfare 2 inside the PC version of Call of Duty Modern Warfare Remastered. I know that seems a little bit confusing, but MW Remastered already has online multiplayer support to build upon. On top of recreating all the original MW2 maps, H2 was also going to incorporate all of the maps from Modern Warfare Remastered and create some unique new maps using its assets. The FPS game ‘s mod would also introduce a fresh progression system, dynamic camos, and much more.\nFans have been incredibly excited for this mod – sales for Modern Warfare Remastered have spiked on Steam, and its player count has risen to its highest point since it launched. The H2 mod had already been played by some members of the community (you can check out a video from ‘Inkslasher’ below which shows off the gameplay), but it was set to be unleashed to the public on Friday August 16. However, today, August 15, the development team behind it broke some very bad news.\n“Today, our team members received a Cease & Desist order on behalf of Activision Publishing in relation to the H2M-Mod project. We are complying with this order and shutting down all operations immediately and permanently.” The H2 website has now disappeared, its bio on X now reads “shutdown”, and the mod will no longer be released.\nThis is disappointing, but not all that surprising. Activision has a track record of shutting down Call of Duty mod projects – just last year, it sent a cease and desist to the creators of an equally-ambitious MW2 mod known as SM2. Despite the H2 mod actually resulting in an uplift in sales for Modern Warfare Remastered, which many hoped would see Activision be more lenient this time around, there was a very high chance that this outcome would happen.\nIt is also possible to still experience the original MW2’s multiplayer on PC, so there’s even more of an incentive on Activision’s end to shut down a project that remakes it in a different game. The most recently-released CoD, Modern Warfare 3, is also stuffed with remastered MW2 maps in its popular multiplayer.\nDespite there being official avenues to experience MW2 multiplayer, and despite the incredibly high risk of your project getting shut down, these kinds of mods prove that there is an appetite to properly remaster the multiplayer action from the 2009 hit. The campaign was bestowed that honor in 2020, but not the online play.\nAs a consolation for this disappointing news, here are some great multiplayer games you can play right now. Also be sure to check out everything we know about the next Call of Duty game ahead of the Black Ops 6 release date .\nYou can also follow us on Google News for daily PC games news, reviews, and guides, or grab our PCGN deals tracker to net yourself some bargains.",

    "title": "‘Socratic valor in the West Philippine Sea’",
    "text": "It is a collective duty for Filipinos to support these efforts and uphold the legacy of Socrates In the shadow of rising tensions in the West Philippine Sea, Gov. Victorino Dennis Socrates emerges as a present-day Socratic interrogator, championing the cause of the Philippines against China’s territorial claims. His symbolic visit to Pag-asa Island not only asserts the nation’s sovereign rights but also underscores the resilience of the island’s residents amid escalating tensions. Socrates’ acknowledgment of the residents as the living proof of Kalayaan’s Philippine roots resonates as a powerful assertion against China’s sweeping maritime claim. As the Permanent Court of Arbitration has refuted China’s nine-dash line, Socrates commendably stands firm on the legal and historical foundations supporting the Philippines’ sovereignty. The governor’s obligation to assess the status of provincial programs and projects on Pag-asa Island reflects a significant move in the face of China’s continuing aggression. His commitment to fulfilling his duties, especially in a region long neglected, sets a commendable precedent. Socrates wisely draws attention to the historical significance of Kalayaan, emphasizing how Filipino explorer Tomas Cloma’s claim laid the groundwork for its inclusion under President Marcos Sr. government. He aptly references former Justice Antonio Carpio’s lectures, affirming Kalayaan’s status through historic title, rooted in the 1898 Treaty of Paris. The governor’s plans to expand residential areas in the West Philippine Sea signal a proactive approach to strengthen the country’s presence in the region. Investing in Lawak Island not only enhances sovereignty but also acknowledges the delicate balance needed to preserve its natural sanctuaries. Socrates’ assurance of allocated funds for various projects on Pag-asa Island, including a school building and recreational center, demonstrates a commitment to improving the lives of its residents. His careful consideration of interventions showcases a thoughtful approach to the challenges posed by the island’s limited space. The Kalayaan mayor’s gratitude for Socrates’ visit highlights the inspirational impact on the residents. This symbolic move fosters a sense of unity and shared purpose, essential in the face of external pressures. The governor’s visit, characterized as a “strong partnership” between the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the provincial government of Palawan, highlights the need for collaborative efforts in safeguarding the nation’s interests. Socrates’ initiative aligns with the government’s broader plan to develop islands in the South China Sea, making them more habitable for troops. As tensions escalate, Socrates’ bravery and sincere efforts to serve the Filipinos in the disputed islands deserve recognition and emulation. Filipinos, in turn, should value the heroism displayed and draw inspiration from his commitment to duty. Emulating Socrates involves standing resilient against external pressures, understanding the historical context, and contributing actively to the nation’s sovereignty. In this critical time, the Philippines must unite, drawing strength from the spirit of Pag-asa Island. The government’s plans to improve the habitability of occupied islands underscore the importance of fortifying positions in the South China Sea. It is a collective duty for Filipinos to support these efforts and uphold the legacy of Socrates, ensuring that the nation’s sovereignty remains unwavering in the face of external challenges",

    "title": "Una actualización de Android Auto está afectando la pantalla de los usuarios. Hay una solución mientras llega un parche de Google",
    "text": "Una actualización de software puede incluir nuevas funciones, cambios en la interfaz de una aplicación o un sistema operativo, y también soluciones a fallos en el sistema. No obstante, a veces una actualización en vez de traer mejoras, puede ocasionar problemas en el funcionamiento. Tal parece ser el caso de una actualización reciente de Android Auto.\nY es que algunos usuarios han publicado quejas sobre el mal funcionamiento de sus sistemas de Android Auto desde una actualización reciente. El fallo provoca problemas de contraste en la pantalla, lo que tiene como consecuencia que los colores en pantalla sea vean muy opacos, y los negros se vean como grises.\nAsí es la solución temporal a los problemas de contraste de Android Auto\nEl problema de funcionamiento de Android Auto ha sido reportado en plataformas como Reddit, donde los propios usuarios han compartido imágenes mostrando cómo luce la interfaz de su sistema de infoentretenimiento para el coche desde una actualización reciente: colores opacos, problemas de visibilidad y en general un aspecto difuminado y pálido en la pantalla.\nEl cambio en la interfaz es tan extremo que algunos usuarios pensaron que se trataba de un nuevo diseño para Android Auto. Así se ven los colores y la interfaz en general de los sistemas afectados:\nSegún las quejas, este fallo no solo ocasiona un problema estético, sino que también afecta a la visibilidad del sistema y la información en pantalla, especialmente de noche y en condiciones de poca luz como al conducir dentro de un túnel.\nSi estás sufriendo de este problema en tu sistema de Android Auto, hay una posible solución temporal, según los propios usuarios: eliminar los datos y la cache de Android Auto y reiniciar el sistema soluciona el problema en la pantalla durante un período de tiempo. Con suerte, una solución oficial ya está en camino, aunque al momento de escribir este artículo Google todavía no ha confirmado una fecha de lanzamiento de una actualización.\nComo ya mencionamos, este tipo de problemas puede ser común. De hecho, hace apenas algunas semanas los usuarios de Android Auto sufrieron de otro fallo que hacía que la pantalla del móvil se quedara completamente en negro si se usaba Android Auto, un fallo que, en ese caso, estaba relacionado al modo 'Always-On Display' (o pantalla siempre encendida).\nFoto de portada | Xataka (con edición)\nEn Xataka Android | Siete ajustes de Google Maps para Android Auto que recomiendo configurar cuanto antes\nEn Xataka Android | Si usas Android Auto conectando el móvil por cable, puedes ahorrar batería apagando el modo inalámbrico",
