    "text": "Robotic food could reduce [electronic waste](https://techxplore.com/tags/electronic+waste/), help deliver nutrition and medicines to people and animals in need, monitor health, and even pave the way to novel gastronomical experiences. But how far are we from having a fully edible robot for lunch or dessert? And what are the challenges? Scientists from the RoboFood project, based at EPFL, address these and other questions in a perspective article in the journal [Nature Reviews Materials](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41578-024-00688-9). “Bringing robots and food together is a fascinating challenge,” says Dario Floreano [who] [ joined forces](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41578-024-00688-9) with Remko Boom from Wageningen University, The Netherlands, Jonathan Rossiter from the University of Bristol, UK, and Mario Caironi from the Italian Institute of Technology, to launch the project [RoboFood](https://www.robofood.org/). … “We are still figuring out which edible materials work similarly to non-edible ones,” says Floreano. For example, gelatin can replace rubber, rice cookies are akin to foam, a chocolate film can protect robots in humid environments, and mixing starch and tannin can mimic commercial glues. Once the components are ready, the goal is to produce fully edible robots. To date, scientists have succeeded in assembling partially edible robotic systems. In 2022, researchers from EPFL and the Wageningen University designed a drone with wings out of rice cookies glued with gelatin. Scientists at EPFL and IIT have also created a partially edible rolling [robot](https://techxplore.com/tags/robot/) that uses pneumatic gelatin legs and an edible tilt sensor.",

    "title": "Easter Sunday: Day of Deliverance and Victory",
    "text": "Today’s Gospel describes an absence that confounds the disciples, preparing them for the Presence their hearts desire. Gospel (Read Jn 20:1-9) On Palm Sunday, the narrative of our Lord’s Passion ended with these words: “Then they rolled a stone against the entrance to the tomb” (Mk 15:46b). Jesus’ dead body had been quickly prepared for burial, because the Sabbath sundown approached, and He was laid in the fresh tomb of a rich man. Then, for His followers, there was silence and utter desolation. We can only imagine how much “rest” they got on what must have been the longest Sabbath day of their lives. Today, St. John tells us, “On the first day of the week, Mary of Magdala came to the tomb early in the morning, while it was still dark” (Jn 20:1). Now that the Sabbath was over, she was coming to finish the burial anointing. Why did she arrive so early, before dawn? Anyone who has grieved over the death of a loved one knows the answer to this question. The finality of death, even for those prepared for its arrival, is literally un-believable. We cannot bear the thought of not seeing this dear one again. Mary had the opportunity to be near Jesus once more, to see and touch Him. Even in death, He drew her to Him with an irresistible force. Mary saw that the stone had been removed from the tomb. Shock! We can feel her eagerness to be with Jesus again, yet He was not in the tomb. St. John wants us to see that the followers of Jesus were slow to understand what He had told them many times: He would rise from the dead. Mary believed that someone had taken the Lord and put Him elsewhere. Imagine this for a moment: profound grief was compounded by profound horror. For Mary, the empty tomb was not a source of joy. It was an agonizing twist in what was becoming a nightmare. Peter and John (“the other disciple whom Jesus loved”) ran to the tomb with Mary’s news. They, too, were drawn to the Lord in this energetic race. John arrived first, but notice his deference to Peter, the Lord’s own appointed leader of the apostles. Once inside, they quickly realized that grave robbers were not responsible for the absence of Jesus. The burial cloths (fine, expensive linen) would never have been left behind by robbers this way. No, something big was underway. St. John tells us that when he entered the tomb and saw the burial cloths, “…he believed” (Jn 20:8). What did he believe? Only that Jesus was really gone from the tomb—itself a great mystery. He goes on to make that clear: “For they did not yet understand the Scripture that He had to rise from the dead” (Jn 20:9). So, on Easter Sunday, the Gospel reading leaves us with only clues. How interesting! There is not, as we might expect, the boundless joy of the disciples seeing Jesus alive again. Instead, we spend time with His followers in their longing, anxiety, sadness, and utter confusion. We, of course, know what’s going on, but they don’t as yet. St. John wants us to linger for a spell in the very human reactions to an astounding miracle. He helps us feel deeply the question that boggled the disciples: What has happened to Jesus? It is only by entering fully into this human dilemma that we are truly prepared for the answer: Jesus has conquered Death. The worst thing that has ever happened in human history (men killed the “Author of life,” Acts 3:15) has become the best thing that has ever happened in human history, and man’s history has been changed forever. Possible response: Lord Jesus, sometimes I am shocked that You don’t seem to be where I expect You. Help me believe that what I feel as Your absence will always lead to Your Presence. First Reading (Read Acts 10:34a, 37-43) If we think about what we have seen of Peter in the readings for Holy Week, this passage from Acts might leave us asking a question: What has happened to Peter? We remember him on Palm Sunday, denying the Lord three times and fleeing when Jesus was crucified. Today’s Gospel tells us that Mary Magdalene had to go fetch Peter with her news, because he and the other apostles were hiding “for fear of the Jews” (Jn 20:19). Yet here we see him boldly preaching the Good News (to the same Jews who had terrified him) that death could not hold Jesus. We see the effects in him of the Resurrection—more clues to its reality. Peter testifies not only to “Jesus of Nazareth,” Who “went about doing good” (Acts 10:38), but also to the fact that he “ate and drank with Him after He rose from the dead” (Acts 10:41). The commission he and the other apostles received from the Risen Jesus, confirmed by the anointing of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost, turned Peter inside out. What a transformation from the befuddlement of the empty tomb. Freed from his cowardice and fear, he wanted the world to know that Jesus is alive and that “everyone who believes in Him will receive forgiveness of sins through His Name” (Acts 10:43). Possible response: Lord, this Easter season, please loosen my tongue to bear witness to Your empty tomb and to the meal we still eat and drink with You in the Mass. Psalm (Read Ps 118:1-2, 16-17, 22-23) The psalmist announces: “This is the day the LORD has made; let us rejoice and be glad.” Great joy like this might make us wonder about its cause: What has happened to the psalmist? If we read the entire psalm, we see he describes a time of unthinkable reversal in his life, when he was in terrible distress, and his enemies surrounded him “like bees” that “blazed like a fire of thorns” (Ps 118:12). He recounts that he was “pushed hard, so that I was falling, but the LORD helped me” (Ps 118:13). In fact, the LORD’s deliverance sprung him from death: “I shall not die but live, and declare the works of the LORD” (Ps 118:17). Yet what really seems to fuel the psalmist’s elation is that “the stone which the builders rejected has become the cornerstone” (Ps 118:22). The psalmist’s enemies had rejected him, but God upset their plans to be rid of him, and, instead, set him like a cornerstone, a rock of solid strength. Now we understand the joy of the psalmist, and why we are using his words to rejoice on Resurrection Sunday. The reversal he experienced from God’s mighty hand ignited his heart to sing God’s praises on the day of his deliverance and victory. His words help us re-live the exquisite joy of Jesus’ victory over sin and death, our most feared enemies. When the meaning of the empty tomb washes over us, we will echo the psalmist’s awe: “By the LORD has this been done; it is wonderful in our eyes!” (Ps 118:23) Possible response: The psalm is, itself, a response to our other readings. Read it again prayerfully to make it your own. Second Reading (Read Col 3:1-4) In his epistle, St. Paul writes a most remarkable exhortation to his Christian friends (and to us): “Think of what is above, not of what is on earth” (Col 3:2). Why should we, earthbound creatures that we are, be seeking what is above? What has happened to us?St. Paul tells us that the death and Resurrection of Jesus, our focal point all during Holy Week, has happened to us, too. In baptism, we died with Christ and rose again with Him into a brand-new life. The power that raised Jesus from the dead has seated us with Christ: “Your life is hidden with Christ in God” (Col 3:3). What a transformation for us! The empty tomb of the first Easter has reverberated all the way out to us now, in the 21st century. Its meaning is not only historical but personal. In Christ, we are forgiven our sins, released from death, and destined for glory: “When Christ your life appears, then you will appear with Him in glory” (Col 3:4). Allelulia! Possible response: Father, forgive me when I try to make life on this earth my only goal. Help me to set my mind on heaven.

    "text": "MADRID, 5 May. (EUROPA PRESS) -\nEl Ejército de Sudán y el Movimiento por la Liberación de Sudán - Norte (SPLM-N, por sus siglas en inglés) han decidido dar un respiro a los cruentos combates que están librando en el estado de Kordofán del Sur, en el sur del país, para permitir la llegada de ayuda humanitaria.\nEl Ejército y el grupo liderado por Abdulaziz al Hilu llevan protagonizando intensos enfrentamientos en el estado desde el verano del año pasado, cuando el grupo rebelde decidió romper en junio el alto el fuego que estaba en vigor tras denunciar ataques militares en medio de la guerra que libra el Ejército contra las paramilitares Fuerzas de Apoyo Rápido (RSF).\nEl pacto ha sido alcanzado tras el primer encuentro mantenido entre ambas partes tras el estallido de la guerra, el 15 de abril del año pasado, y en el que por fin se han visto las caras el número dos del Ejército sudanés, Shams al Din Kabbashi, con el propio Al Hilu en Yuba, la capital de Sudán del Sur.\n\"Ambas partes han acordado facilitar la entrega inmediata de ayuda humantiaria en las zonas respectivamente controladas del estado\", según el comunicado del Consejo Soberano de Transición, la entidad política creada por los militares y que dirige su líder, Abdelfatá al Burhan, que avanza además un segundo encuentro dentro de una semana para formalizar el protocolo de ayuda.\nEl acuerdo ha sido confirmado al 'Sudan Tribune' por el portavoz del SPLM-N Sanaa Philip Matar, quien estima que los combates en Kordofán del Sur han forzado el desplazamiento de 600.000 personas hacia las montañas de Nuba, a las que hay que sumar otras 50.000 desplazadas por los combates entre el Ejército y los paramilitares que se han refugiado en la provincia de New Fung, en el estado de Nilo Azul, también bajo control del SPLM-N.\nLa guerra en Sudán ha provocado la mayor crisis de desplazamiento humano de la actualidad, donde más de ocho millones de sudaneses se han visto obligadas a abandonar sus hogares. De ellos, tres millones son niños. Más de 25 millones de personas necesitan alimentos y medicinas básicos y 4,9 millones de esas personas están directamente borde de la hambruna.\nLa guerra ha dejado al menos 15.500 fallecidos, según datos verificados por la ONG del Proyecto de Datos de Eventos y Ubicación de Conflictos Armados (ACLED) pero el enviado especial de EEUU para el país africano, Tom Perriello, da por válido que estas estimaciones representan solo una fracción de los muertos reales, que podrían rebasar ya los 150.000 en todo el país.\nLeer más acerca de: Reino Unido Sudán",

    "text": "Arsenal missed the chance to return to the top of the Premier League as they slipped to a disappointing defeat to West Ham amid more VAR controversy.\nThe Gunners needed victory to replace Liverpool at the summit but lost 2-0 on a night where Hammers boss David Moyes finally landed a victory at the Emirates Stadium.\nWest Ham lost Kurt Zouma ahead of the game and Lucas Paqueta after just over half an hour but hit the front through Tomas Soucek’s strike, awarded after VAR could not determine whether the whole ball had gone out of play in the build-up.\nA second-half header from former Arsenal defender Konstantinos Mavropanos secured the points and things could have been even better for the visitors had Said Benrahma not seen a last-gasp penalty saved by David Raya.\nA massive result for West Ham ⚒️ #ARSWHU pic.twitter.com/JLAN9CInMV\n— Premier League (@premierleague) December 28, 2023\nMoyes had failed to secure victory in his previous 72 Premier League away games at Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool or Manchester United, so this was a long time coming for the Scot.\nArsenal laboured when they needed to continue their recent winning run in London derbies to go back to the top of the table.\nInstead, only captain Martin Odegaard could hold his head high on a night where their defence creaked and Gabriel Jesus was guilty of missing a couple of very good chances.\nIt was a big win for David Moyes (Adam Davy/PA) Arsenal started well, with some great touches in and around the West Ham box from Odegaard in particular.\nBut at the other end their defending left a lot to be desired, as Oleksandr Zinchenko and Gabriel Magalhaes failed to deal with a simple ball into the middle.\nJarrod Bowen capitalised by latching onto the miscue and teed up Soucek to finish – the goal surviving a lengthy VAR check which could not ultimately make a call on if the ball had not gone out of play before Bowen’s cutback.\nTomas Soucek, number 28, opened the scoring (Adam Davy/PA) Arsenal looked to respond although the goal gave West Ham something to defend, although Jesus found a way in behind with a subtle flick into Bukayo Saka, whose header was brilliantly saved by Alphonse Areola.\nPaqueta had been hurt in the warm-up and lasted just over half an hour, with his fellow Brazilian Gabriel Martinelli curling an effort just wide for Arsenal as they continued in vain to find a leveller.\nThe hosts were getting closer, West Ham gifting possession as two passes saw Arsenal in on goal once more, this time Saka hitting the base of the post from an acute angle.\nBukayo Saka came close to an equaliser (Adam Davy/PA) Former West Ham captain Declan Rice fired just over from 25 yards but it was another player coming back to haunt his former club who would find the back of the net soon after.\nMavropanos made just seven league starts in three years as an Arsenal player but returned to the Premier League last summer with the Hammers and headed them two goals ahead before the hour.\nJesus then headed straight at Areola before sending another fine chance well over the bar moments after Arteta introduced Eddie Nketiah and Reiss Nelson off the bench.\nAreola was on hand again to keep out a Leandro Trossard effort, with Vladimir Coufal clearing a William Saliba header off the line from the resulting corner.\nRice had come off the bench during a 3-0 Carabao Cup defeat on his return to West Ham earlier in the season and endured another night to forget here as he conceded a late penalty for tripping Emerson Palmieri in the box – only for Raya to keep out substitute Benrahma’s tame spot-kick.\nSport",

    "text": "A woman is dead after an alligator attack. Cynthia Diekema, 61, was canoeing with her husband in Florida, when an alligator tipped over their vessel and attacked, officials with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said during a press conference.\nThe incident occurred on May 6 on the mouth of Tiger Creek on Lake Kissimmee, FWC Maj. Evan Laskowski said. The couple was on a 14-foot canoe in two feet of water when their vessel passed over a large alligator.\nVideos by VICE\nIn response, the animal thrashed and tipped the canoe over, sending both the husband and wife into the water.\nDiekema ended up on top of the alligator in the water and was bitten by the animal. Her husband attempted to intervene, but was unsuccessful. Later, Diekema was spotted by a helicopter, and her body was recovered from the water.\nAfterwards, trappers recovered an 11-foot, four inch alligator that matched the description of the animal involved in the incident. A second, smaller gator was later recovered as well.\nInvestigation Launched After Deadly Alligator Attack\nRoger Young, the executive director of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, called the situation “tragic.”\n“This is a devastating loss, and our hearts go out to everyone affected,” he added.\nA full investigation has been launched in response, Young said. He and the FWC, Young noted, “are working hard to understand exactly what happened.”\n“While alligator attacks resulting in fatalities are extremely rare, this tragedy serves as a somber reminder of the powerful wildlife that share our natural spaces,” Young noted.\nBradley Johnson, FWC’s public information officer, encouraged Floridians to contact FWC’s nuisance alligator hotline if they have concerns about a gator.\nTo remain safe around alligators, Johnson said people should maintain distance, ensure pets are on a leash, swim only in designated areas, and refrain from feeding alligators.",
