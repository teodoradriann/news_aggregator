The call comes amid escalating conflict, intensifying human suffering, and the critical shortage of basic life necessities in the region.\nGuterres Speaks at the NAM Summit\nAddressing the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) summit in Uganda, Guterres underscored the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, where the inhabitants grapple daily with a lack of food, clean water, electricity, and essential medical supplies in hospitals. The ongoing strife and the worsening living conditions, he warned, necessitate immediate action, else they risk causing further loss of life.\nThe Right to Statehood\nDuring his remarks, Guterres stressed the importance of acknowledging the right of the Palestinian people to establish their own state. He depicted any denial of this fundamental right as unacceptable, viewing it as a significant obstacle to securing lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians.\nThe Gaza Conflict\nThe conflict, which has been steadily escalating, surged in intensity following a Hamas attack on southern Israel on October 7, leading to significant casualties. The subsequent Israeli offensive has resulted in the death of at least 24,927 Palestinians, with women and children forming a majority of the casualties, as reported by the Hamas health ministry in Gaza.\nThe World Health Organization has vehemently condemned the inhumane living conditions in Gaza, where approximately 2.4 million people are grappling with the challenge of accessing their basic needs in the midst of conflict.\nAs the conflict continues to claim lives and shatter existences, the international community waits, hoping for a resolution that can bring an end to the bloodshed and pave the way for a peaceful future.\nComments\nSubscribe to BNN Breaking\nSign up for our daily newsletter covering global breaking news around the world.",

A red warning is issued for the authorities concerned to take action in view of high predictability of adverse weather conditions. More trains are expected to get delayed in future too. Ludhiana railway station superintendent Amrik Singh said 10-12 trains were delayed because of poor visibility during the day, with the Jammu Rajdhani, which plies from New Delhi to Jammu Tawi, getting delayed by more than five hours.While visibility was poor for most of the morning, it improved to 350 metres by 11.30am. There was moderate fog for the remaining part of the day and sunlight could barely make it past the grey skies. Day temperature dropped to 12.8°C in the city, 5.9°C below normal and fall of 5.8°C from Wednesday.The minimum temperature, also called night temperature, was recorded at 10.3°C, which is 5°C above normal. As per the meteorological department, day temperature in the city might rise to 21°C by Sunday, whereas night temperature might fall to 9°C on Friday. It could further fall to 6°C by next week. Residents too had a difficult time because of poor visibility in the morning hours. Deepak Kumar, a resident, said he was driving on the Southern bypass that runs parallel to Sidhwan canal, but had to stay slow due to fog. Major trains which were delayed because of bad weather included Malwa Express, Amritsar Shatabdi and Shan-e-Punjab. We also published the following articles recentlyDense fog envelopes parts of North India, reduces visibilityThe winter chill continues to grip North India with dense fog in cities like Kanpur, Aligarh, Prayagraj, and Meerut in Uttar Pradesh, and Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh.

In Delhi, the temperature dropped to 9.4 degrees Celsius with visibility as low as 125 meters.

Temperature drops to 7 degrees Celsius. Air Quality Index (AQI) remains in the \\\"very poor\\\" category at 374. Isolated pockets of Delhi and surrounding areas expected to have very dense fog.

The warning aims to prevent car pile-ups and accidents caused by low visibility.

The IMD has also issued an orange alert for dense to moderate fog on Saturday.

    "text": "Las autoridades de la prisión Cuba Panamá para enfermos de VIH, mintieron a la presa política Yilian Oramas García cuando afirmaron que cancelarían su transferencia a un régimen de mayor severidad para que abandonara la huelga de hambre.\nOramas García se declaró en ayuno total en protesta por la que consideraba una medida arbitraria, denunció en declaraciones a Martí Noticias Josefa Oramas, la madre de la prisionera política.\n“No le han quitado la revocación, ni le están dando pases. A ella la pasaron para la parte cerrada desde el primer momento que llegó a la prisión. Su retraso fue de tres o cuatro horas, porque ese día no había transporte. La Seguridad del Estado me dijo a mí que la revocación, lo que faltaba era quitarla de la máquina, que no entiendo: si no han sancionado a un recluso, por qué está en la máquina [la computadora].\nOramas García inició su protesta el 13 de agosto, cuando los mandos del penal ubicado en la provincia Mayabeque le informaron que había perdido sus beneficios por atrasarse en el regreso de un pase a su vivienda situada en la ciudad de Santa Clara, a más de 250 kilómetros de la prisión donde está recluida.\nLuego de más de diez días en ayuno voluntario, suspendió su protesta con la promesa de los mandos penitenciarios y de la Seguridad del Estado de que cambiarían la medida punitiva a la suspensión de dos visitas a su hogar.\n“Mintieron para que ella levantara la huelga. El Jefe de la Unidad, Camilo Zúñiga, dice que él no puede darle pases hasta que no le quiten de la máquina la sanción, que la Seguridad del Estado tiene que llevar un documento”, lamentó la madre.\nYilian Oramas García, de 43 años, cumple una sentencia de seis años de privación de libertad por su participación en una protesta el 15 de agosto de 2021 en la capital villaclareña, en la que ella, su esposo y otras personas exigieron que el gobierno tomara medidas para brindar adecuada asistencia hospitalaria a los enfermos de Covid-19, y que se implementaran mejoras en los servicios mortuorios.",
