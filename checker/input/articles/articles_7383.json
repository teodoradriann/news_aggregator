    "title": "Google Pixel Tablet 3 potrebbe non arrivare mai",
    "text": "Il debutto del Pixel Tablet 2 è previsto nel corso del 2025 a circa due anni di distanza dal lancio dall’ultimo device della serie. Nonostante il tablet non sia ancora arrivato ufficialmente, sono già in circolazione alcune voci riguardanti il suo successore.\nNonostante Google presenterà il nuovo tablet il prossimo anno, gli analisti credevano che una nuova generazione avrebbe permesso di dare vita ad una serie fiorente. Tuttavia, i nuovi report emersi indicano [che Google](https://www.tecnoandroid.it/2024/11/20/oneplus-pad-2-il-primo-tablet-con-android-15-fuori-dalla-famiglia-pixel-1480117/) potrebbe bloccare lo sviluppo del presunto Pixel Tablet 3.\nStando a quanto anticipato dai colleghi di [Android Headlines](https://www.androidheadlines.com/exclusive-google-cancels-pixel-tablet-3-development), il presunto Pixel Tablet 3 era già in fase di sviluppo presso gli uffici di Mountain View. Il device era conosciuto internamente con il nome “Kiyomi”.\nGoogle potrebbe uscire definitivamente dal mercato dei tablet, l’azienda ha sospeso i lavori sul Pixel Tablet 3\nLa fonte, rimasta anonima, ha affermato che Google avrebbe avvisato i team interni dedicati allo sviluppo del Pixel Tablet 3 della chiusura del progetto. La notizia risale alla scorsa settimana e i dipendenti sono stati riassegnati ad altri progetti.\nSe questa notizia dovesse essere confermata, potrebbe trattarsi dell’addio definitivo di Google al settore tablet. Le motivazioni di questa scelta non sono chiare ma non è la prima volta che l’azienda del robottino verde abbandona questo mercato. Il precedente risale a quando la linea di dispositivi realizzata da [Mountain View](https://www.tecnoandroid.it/2024/11/21/google-chat-continua-a-evolversi-con-i-messaggi-vocali-alla-portata-di-tutti-1480660/) si chiamava Nexus.\nSi tratta di una scelta in controtendenza rispetto ai principali competitor che ancora credono nel mercato dei tablet Android. Infatti, produttori del calibro di Samsung, Xiaomi, [Oppo](https://www.tecnoandroid.it/2024/11/20/oppo-pad-3-scopriamo-le-caratteristiche-del-tablet-prima-del-lancio-ufficiale-1480059/) e [OnePlus](https://www.tecnoandroid.it/2024/11/20/oneplus-in-arrivo-un-tablet-da-13-pollici-1480058/) presentano device con costanza e si stanno preparando a presentare nuovi dispositivi.\nPurtroppo, al momento non è chiaro se si tratti di una notizia reale o solo una delle tante voci. Nonostante le fonti riportate siano state indicate come vicine all’azienda, resta il dubbio considerando anche che il Pixel Tabet 2 non è stato annunciato ufficialmente.",

Durante el asedio israelí de este hospital, personal médico y pacientes se vieron forzados a enterrar a algunos fallecidos en los patios, al no poder abandonar la instalación por miedo a la artillería israelí.\nPero entre los centenares de cadáveres hallados hay niños, mujeres y también cadáveres con las manos atadas y sondas todavía ligadas a sus cuerpos.\nLas escenas recuerdan a lo sucedido en el hospital Al Shifa, el más importante de la Franja ubicado en el norte del enclave, que quedó totalmente fuera de servicio tras un asedio israelí de dos semanas a finales de marzo.\nTras la salida de las tropas israelíes el 1 de abril, las autoridades gazatíes descubrieron una fosa común con una decena de cuerpos enterrados, entre los que había pacientes, mujeres y ancianos.\nEn total, se recuperaron unos 400 cuerpos dentro del perímetro del hospital y alrededores en los días posteriores a la salida de las tropas.\nEl Ejército israelí se retiró de Jan Yunis durante la madrugada del 7 de abril, tras cuatro meses de combates y bombardeos en esta zona, también contra viviendas y población civil en los que murieron familias enteras gazatíes.",

    "text": "Man celebrates last day of work after 48 years at supermarket chain WEST DES MOINES, Iowa (KCCI) - For an Iowa man, the start of 2024 will bring a lot of change to his normal routine as he retires from supermarket chain Hy-Vee after almost five decades. It’s not every day Steve Mick gets chauffeured around, but after 48 years at Hy-Vee, Sunday was his last day and his boss insisted on the special ride to work. Outside the West Des Moines supermarket was a display celebrating Mick’s years of service. “That’s amazing,” Mick said. “Wow. It’s about all I can say.” Inside the store, countless hugs and congratulations from family, friends and former colleagues showed the impact Mick had on the community. He started at Hy-Vee behind the meat counter in 1975 when he was just 16. “He’s the same person today: extremely nice, extremely thoughtful, willing to help the customers,” longtime colleague Marilyn Cook said. “He’s been such a hard worker all his life, and today is kind of a bittersweet day for all of us,” said Mick’s daughter, Kerri Driscoll. Mick worked at different Hy-Vee locations throughout his career, his last being the store in West Des Moines on Jordan Creek Parkway. “It was just a place that fit for me,” Mick said. “Been a long haul, and it’s been well worth it.” As the chapter at Hy-Vee comes to an end, the cake at Mick’s party is a hint as to what part of retirement looks like: camping and time in nature with family. “I’m going to let life happen to me, enjoy every minute of it,” Mick said. Mick’s co-workers say he will be missed after bringing smiles to people during his nearly five decades on the job. Copyright 2024 KCCI via CNN Newsource. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "Vivian Jones Former President Donald Trump called on Christians to support his presidential bid, pledging if elected to \"protect God in the public square,\" defend Christian broadcasters and their \"pro-God\" content from censorship, and appoint a task force to fight anti-Christian bias, including federal prosecutions. Trump spoke to an enthusiastic crowd of about 1,500 Thursday evening at a presidential forum at the annual conference of the National Religious Broadcasters at the Gaylord Opryland Resort and Convention Center in Nashville. The [nonprofit’s annual convention is in Music City this week](/story/news/religion/2024/02/22/national-religous-broadcasters-media-summit-defending-faith-in-public-donald-trump-speech/72687839007/). Many in the crowd wore red and white hats with the phrase “Make America Pray Again,” provided by conference sponsor Pray.com, as wild cheers broke out to welcome the former president. “I really believe it’s the biggest thing missing from this country, the biggest thing. We have to bring back our religion. We have to bring back Christianity,” Trump said, prompting a big cheer from the crowd. Despite a tight calendar of court appearances and campaigning, Trump appeared in Nashville with just two days to go before the South Carolina primary. The former president is the frontrunner against former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley in her home state – as he is here in Tennessee. Voters here in the Volunteer State will cast ballots on Super Tuesday on March 5. Early voting is already underway. Prep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide NRB President Troy Miller said the organization invited all eligible candidates from both parties to participate in the presidential forum, and Trump was the only candidate who was available to attend. The NRB has not endorsed Trump’s presidential bid. Lines for the presidential forum already snaked through the Opryland hotel lobby just after 3 p.m. But Trump, who was scheduled to take the stage around 8 p.m. CT, kept the hyped crowd waiting. The room was far from packed. At about 8:40 p.m., nearly an hour before Trump took the stage, staff urgently began removing hundreds of chairs from the back corner of the room. About 200 empty seats on the far side of the room remained. Before Trump walked on stage, the crowd stood in recognition of “the January 6th hostages,\" referring to those who face federal charges for their role in storming the U.S. Capitol. His speech began at 9:42 p.m. and wrapped shortly before 11 p.m. During his opening comments, Trump blamed the delay on rough weather during his flight. 'We will protect God in our public square' Trump asked the crowd of Christian broadcasters and media to support his bid for the White House, pledging to defend Christians from domestic persecution, censorship, and infringements on their rights. He denounced the [recent convictions of six anti-abortion protesters arrested in 2021 for blockading the entrance to a Mt. Juliet reproductive health clinic where abortions are performed](/story/news/crime/2024/01/30/anti-abortion-protesters-felony-convictions-nashville-blockade/72397522007/). The group is facing up to 10.5 years in prison and fines of more than a quarter-million dollars for their actions. “Let’s call these brave Americans what they really are: persecuted Christians,” Trump said. Meanwhile, Trump accused the Biden administration of “targeting Christian believers” and pledged, if elected again, to appoint a special task force “to rapidly review the cases of every political prisoner.\" “Remember, every communist regime throughout history has tried to stamp out the churches – just like every fascist regime is trying to go up and control them,” he said. “In America, the radical left is trying to do both at the same time.” Trump pledged to establish a new federal task force on “fighting anti-Christian bias.” “Its mission will be to investigate all forms of illegal discrimination, harassment and persecution against Christians in America,” Trump said. “No one will be touching the cross of Christ under the Trump administration,” he added, to a big applause from the crowd. Trump also claimed without evidence that religious broadcasters are “under siege,” pledging if elected to “protect content that is pro-God.” “We will protect God in our public square,\" Trump said. \"I will not allow the media or left-wing groups silence you, censor you, discriminate against you, or in any way tell you what you have to say.\" Trump briefly mentioned his multiple criminal indictments, claiming them as political persecution. “I take all these arrows for you and I’m so proud to take them,” he said. “I’m being indicted for you,” outstretching his arms as if on a cross. He touted efforts to support Israel during his presidency, citing his administration’s move to relocate the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem – and pledged to “stand strongly” with Israel – prompting a standing ovation from much of the crowd. During his speech, Trump invited former U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman up on stage to provide remarks. Friedman, who wore a medallion around his neck to remember the more than 100 Israeli hostages still in Hamas captivity, told Trump that the Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel “would not have happened,” had Trump still been in office. The crowd stood cheering several times as Trump rolled through a list of other priorities, including expanding school choice options, abolishing the U. S. Department of Education, securing the southern U.S. border with Mexico, defeating the “toxic force of gender ideology,” keeping “men out of women’s sports,” and “prohibiting child mutilation in all 50 states.” “In the end, we do not answer to bureaucrats in Washington, we answer to God in heaven,” Trump said. ‘He’s one of us’ Those attending were overwhelmingly supportive of the former president, and [ much of the conference carried similar themes as his speech.](/story/news/religion/2024/02/22/national-religous-broadcasters-media-summit-defending-faith-in-public-donald-trump-speech/72687839007/) Washington state resident Fritz Von Tagen traveled to Nashville for the NRB conference to exhibit his company, which develops backgrounds for virtual reality television. Von Tagen, who was wearing a red MAGA hat and an Israeli flag lapel pin, said he hopes Trump is reelected for the sake of small business owners, like himself. “I want to hear his plan to put our country back together. We’re hurting badly,” Von Tagen told The Tennessean. “Our company really started growing until this last administration. It’s doing well, but not near as well as it would normally.” “There’s a lot more people working now that know nothing about the English language. They can’t speak English,\" Von Tagen added. \"I feel bad that all those illegal people are taking jobs away from the Americans.” Jim Sheldon, of Kentucky, whose company is also exhibiting at NRB, said he was looking forward to hearing directly from the former president with “no spin.” “Trump is just, I think, one of us, really,” Sheldon said. “He’s a billionaire, but he’s one of us.” Vivian Jones covers state politics and government for The Tennessean.

    "text": "Party is on course to win the election after victory in European parliament poll The French election poses a threat to Britain’s financial stability if Emmanuel Macron loses to Marie Le Pen, the Bank of England has warned. The National Rally is on course to win the snap vote called by President Macron after the hard-Right party’s crushing victory in European parliament elections last month. Bond markets — which lend to governments — are closely analysing the polls in France as well as in Britain and the United States, with some politicians making big spending promises despite high debt levels. The Bank cited the issue in its latest Financial Stability Report. ‘Policy uncertainty associated with upcoming elections globally has increased,’ it said. ‘This could make the global economic outlook less certain and lead to financial market volatility. Marine Le-Pen&#039;s party could pose a threat to Britain&#039;s economy if her party wins the French snap elections, the Bank of England has warned ‘It could also increase existing sovereign debt pressures, geopolitical risks, and risks associated with global fragmentation, all of which are relevant to UK financial stability.’ The Bank said such factors could ‘make the economic outlook less certain and could lead to market volatility... as already observed in response to the unexpected news of French parliamentary elections over the summer’. The Bank made clear that worries about public finances abroad could be brought home to the UK. ‘High public debt levels in major economies could have consequences for UK financial stability and interact with other risks,’ the Bank said. That could happen if bond investors’ worries about public debt spread across the world. Aside from Macron&#039;s election, the Bank said that other factors such as developments in the Middle East, Russia&#039;s war in Ukraine and US-China relations all represent &#039;sources of material geopolitical risks&#039; Households and businesses could then find it harder to borrow and government borrowing costs could rise, making it harder to find the money to respond to future shocks. Meanwhile, threats posed by conflict in the Middle East, Russia’s war in Ukraine and US-China relations all represent ‘sources of material geopolitical risks’. ‘For example, developments in the Middle East, including disruption to shipping through the Red Sea, or further escalation of conflict in Ukraine, could disrupt global trade and supply chains and cause sharp moves in commodity prices,’ the Bank said. Such moves could trigger a range of consequences such as higher inflation and interest rates or market turbulence. Read more",
