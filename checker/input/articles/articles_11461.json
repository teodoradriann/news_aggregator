    "text": "Indore Breaks World Record with Massive Tree Plantation Drive Indore Mayor Pushyamitra Bhargava announced that the city has set a new Guinness World Record by planting over 11 lakh saplings in a single day, surpassing Assam's previous record. The effort was a collaboration between the public, the Border Security Force, and various social groups. The week-long initiative saw the total plantation of 51 lakh saplings. [Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| Indore | Updated: 19-07-2024 13:29 IST | Created: 19-07-2024 13:29 IST - Country: - India Indore Mayor Pushyamitra Bhargava on Friday declared that the city has made history by planting over 11 lakh saplings in a single day, setting a new Guinness World Record. The achievement was possible through public participation and significant contributions from the Border Security Force (BSF). On July 14, Indore met its ambitious goal, previously held by Assam, of planting the most trees in 24 hours. Mayor Bhargava revealed that the idea was initiated by Urban Development Minister Kailash Vijayvargiya, and it was decided that breaking the record would be more feasible if the plantation activities spanned over a week. Revati Hill was chosen as the site for this massive plantation drive, with zones meticulously divided and thousands of volunteers mobilized. Of the 11 lakh saplings, the BSF planted 3 lakh, with forest and civic body teams planting another 1 lakh, and social groups contributing 7 lakh saplings. The drive resulted in a total of 51 lakh saplings planted in a week. Union Home Minister Amit Shah lauded Indore for this monumental achievement and participated in the 'Ek Ped Maa Ke Naam' campaign by planting a sapling in the city on the record day. According to the Guinness World Records website, the previous benchmark was set by Assam with 9,21,730 saplings. (With inputs from agencies.)

    "text": "Florida has been experiencing a heat streak over the past week, consistently reaching highs in the 90s — though “feels-like” temps have been even hotter .\nDue to the extreme temperatures, SunRail announced on Thursday evening that all of its trains were running on a 5-10 minute delay .\nRecommended Videos\nAccording to Business Insider , intense heat can cause steel railroad tracks to expand and lengthen, making them appear almost like spaghetti.\nThis can cause the tracks to “buckle” under the stress, which can be a huge risk for trains operating on them. As such, rail networks typically reduce the speed of their trains when the temperature goes over 86 degrees.\n[EXCLUSIVE: Become a News 6 Insider (it’s FREE) | PINIT! Share your photos ]\nWhile SunRail later announced that its trains were back on schedule, it’s an indicator of just how hot Central Florida has gotten recently.\nDue to extreme temperatures, all trains are running at restricted speed. Expect 5 to 10 mins delays.\n— SunRail (@RideSunRail) May 9, 2024 However, the region is expected to get a break from the hot weather thanks to approaching showers that are expected to cross through, which should bring the temperatures down a little.\nIn the meantime, it’s also important to remember these safety tips to avoid heat exhaustion:\nNever leave pets/children inside a parked vehicle Drink water/stay hydrated Reduce strenuous activities Find shade or stay in A/C Wear lightweight, light-colored clothing",
