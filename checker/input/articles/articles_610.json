    "title": "Sources -- Canelo Alvarez to be stripped of IBF 168-pound title - ESPN",
    "text": "Canelo Alvarez is being stripped of his IBF super middleweight title ahead of his Sept. 14 fight against Edgar Berlanga in Las Vegas, sources told ESPN on Thursday. The decision comes with Alvarez's mandatory title defense against the IBF's No. 1 contender, William Scull, overdue. Alvarez, boxing's top star, will still defend his WBA, WBC and WBO 168-pound titles against Berlanga. The IBF is set to order a vacant title fight between Scull and No. 2 contender Vladimir Shiskin, sources said. \"Once we officially notify the involved parties we will issue a statement,\" IBF president Daryl Peoples told ESPN on Thursday. Alvarez (61-2-2, 39 KOs) won the undisputed super middleweight championship in November 2021 when he added the IBF title with an 11th-round TKO against Caleb Plant. The 34-year-old Mexican fighter went on to make four successful defenses of all four 168-pound belts. Alvarez, who is ESPN's No. 5 pound-for-pound boxer, most recently outpointed Jaime Munguia in May. Berlanga (22-0, 17 KOs) will be challenging for his first world title. The 27-year-old Brooklyn, New York, native is ESPN's No. 6 super middleweight. Scull (22-0, 9 KOs) has never competed on the world-class level. The 32-year-old, who fights out of Germany, is coming off an eight-round decision win over Sean Hemphill in May on the Alvarez-Munguia undercard. Russia's Shiskin (16-0, 10 KOs) scored a seventh-round TKO victory over Mike Guy in March. The 32-year-old Shiskin, who fights out of South Florida, has a career-best victory in a decision over former titleholder Jose Uzcategui in December 2022. Neither Scull nor Shiskin is rated by ESPN at super middleweight. \"Vladimir has been waiting for this opportunity for a long time, and I am thrilled that he is finally going to get his chance to shine,\" Shiskin's promoter, Dmitry Salita, told ESPN. \"As a promoter, it's gratifying to see someone progress to world-champion status, especially after witnessing their growth from the early stages of their career.\" Alvarez is the latest star boxer to lose his undisputed championship after being stripped by the IBF. Oleksandr Usyk was stripped of his IBF heavyweight title after he defeated Tyson Fury in May.",

    "text": "Rub your Thanksgiving turkey with this compound Garlic Herb Butter for added flavor and moisture. Prepare the herbed butter in advance to save yourself time on the big day!\nAbout This Recipe Rubbing butter under the skin of a whole turkey or turkey breast before roasting is a guaranteed way to infuse the meat with tons of fresh flavor, lock in moisture, and crisp up the skin.\nThe recipe I’m sharing with you today is garlic herb compound butter that’s ideal for any cut of turkey. To make it, softened butter is combined with fragrant fresh herbs like rosemary and sage as well as minced garlic.\nThe one “secret” ingredient? Olive oil! Adding a little olive oil to the herb butter keeps it smooth and spreadable, making it so much easier to spread beneath the skin of your turkey.\nIf you plan on roasting a whole turkey or turkey breast this holiday season, be sure to bookmark this garlic and herb butter recipe for seasoning your turkey!\nTools You’ll Need You’ll need a few pieces of kitchen equipment to prepare the butter herb rub:\nSmall mixing bowl — For combining the ingredients. Microplane — I prefer grating the garlic directly in the butter. If you don’t own a microplane, use a garlic press instead. Cutting board and knife — For chopping the fresh herbs. Measuring spoon — For measuring the herbs and olive oil. Parchment paper or plastic wrap — Only needed if you plan on shaping the butter and storing it for later. Recipe Ingredients You’ll need a handful of simple ingredients to make the herbed butter for your turkey:\nButter Olive Oil Garlic Fresh Rosemary Fresh Thyme Fresh Sage Fresh Parsley For the complete ingredient list and detailed instructions, scroll to the bottom of this post for the FREE printable recipe card.\nIngredient Notes Butter — If you’ve brined your turkey, I recommend using unsalted butter so as not to add extra unnecessary salt. Also, you must use softened butter to make the garlic herb butter for your Thanksgiving turkey (here’s my tutorial on how to soften butter quickly ). Garlic — Fresh is best; garlic powder will not deliver the same level of flavor. Herbs — Please use fresh herbs! If you only have dried herbs, use one-third the amount that the recipe calls for. How to Make Herb Butter for a Turkey a quick overview! This garlic herb compound butter comes together in about 5 minutes and can be refrigerated for later or immediately slathered under the turkey skin.\nMake the herb butter : Combine the softened butter, garlic, olive oil, and chopped fresh herbs in a mixing bowl. Shape into a log (optional) : If you wish to shape the butter and store it for later, transfer the butter mixture to a piece of parchment paper or plastic wrap and shape into a log. Refrigerate until ready to use. Rub under the skin of the turkey : If you chilled the butter mixture, bring it back to room temperature. Gently loosen the turkey skin before rubbing the garlic herb butter around the bird and inside the cavity. (You want the butter to be rubbed directly onto the meat, beneath the skin.) The above is simply a quick summary of this recipe. Check out the full recipe in the free printable recipe card at the bottom of this post for all the detailed instructions.\nTips for Making This Recipe I like to wear gloves when loosening the skin of the turkey and slathering on the compound butter to keep my hands cleaner. If frying the turkey, I recommend only placing the butter under the skin and not in the cavity or the exterior. If smoking the turkey , I recommend placing a drip tray under the turkey while in the smoker to collect the excess butter as it melts. This helps keep the smoker cleaner because it produces less grease. Recipe FAQs Got questions about how to make this recipe? Here are the answers to a few commonly asked questions. Feel free to leave any other questions in the comments on this post and I’ll respond with answers.\nHow much butter should I rub over a turkey? The amount of herb butter you should use for different areas of the turkey will vary depending on how large your bird is.\nFor an average sized turkey (12 to 14 pounds), start with the below measurements , then adjust adding more according to your preference:\n2 tablespoons for turkey breast 2 tablespoons inside of cavity 3 to 4 tablespoons for all over turkey exterior Should I use salted or unsalted butter on my Thanksgiving turkey? If your turkey has been brined or injected with a marinade that contains salt, I suggest sticking with unsalted butter. Otherwise, salted butter works!\nWhat are the best herbs for flavoring a turkey? Can I use just one kind? Take your cue from Simon and Garfunkle and use a blend of fresh parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme. Using a blend of herbs creates a more nuanced flavor and will keep your holiday guests coming back for more!\nIf you don’t have all four herbs, use what you do have on hand. If possible, please use at least two types of fresh herbs to create the most flavorful turkey.\nCan I add salt and/or pepper? If so, how much? Yes, but only add a pinch! Remember that turkey brine is very salty, so if you’re brining your turkey then you really don’t need extra salt in the garlic herb butter.\nAnd if you’re using salted butter, you definitely don’t need to add extra salt to the mixture.\nCan I use this on chicken if I’m not roasting a turkey? Of course! Just note that you’ll need to use significantly less compound butter when using it for a roast chicken ; save any herbed butter that hasn’t touched the raw meat to use on dinner rolls, mashed potatoes, and more.\nCan I use this on turkey breast vs whole turkey? Of course! However, you’ll need roughly 2 tablespoons of the butter herb rub if using on just a turkey breast.\nCan the herb butter be prepared in advance? Yes, the garlic and herb butter can be prepared, rolled into a log, and sealed in parchment paper or plastic wrap. Refrigerate it for up to 5 days.\nStorage Instructions If you wind up with leftovers, they will last up to 5 days in the fridge. Only store leftover butter if it has not touched the raw turkey! Once the butter comes into contact with the raw turkey, it needs to be used or thrown away.\nLeftover butter can also be frozen for up to 3 months. Let it firm up in the fridge (sealed within parchment paper or plastic wrap) before transferring to a freezer bag or freezer-safe container.\nTry Making an Herb and Butter Rub for Your Turkey This Year!

Prepare the herbed butter in advance to save yourself time on the big day!\nPrint Ingredients 8 tablespoons butter (I prefer Kerrygold)* 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 large cloves garlic 1 tablespoon finely chopped rosemary 1 tablespoon thyme leaves ½ tablespoon finely chopped sage ½ tablespoon finely chopped parsley Instructions Making the Herb Butter Bring the butter to room temperature. If you forgot to do so, here’s a guide on how to soften butter quickly. Then, add the softened butter to a mixing bowl. Using a microplane grater, grate the garlic cloves into the bowl with the butter. Next, add the olive oil and chopped herbs. Combine the ingredients. You can do this using a fork, pastry cutter, or handheld electric mixer. Shaping the Herb Butter (Optional) If you wish to shape the butter, once the ingredients are all combined, transfer the butter mixture to a piece of parchment paper or plastic wrap. Shape the butter mixture into a log, then roll up in the plastic wrap or parchment paper. After you’ve shaped the butter, place it in the fridge for 1 to 2 hours, or until firm. Using the Butter for Turkey You want to use softened butter for this, so if you’ve made it in advance and refrigerated the mixture, you’ll need to soften it first. Carefully loosen the skin on the turkey by using your fingers to separate the skin from the breast meat. I recommend starting on the side of the turkey closest to the cavity and working your way to the end of the breast by gently sliding your fingers under the skin once separated. Work slowly and carefully so you don’t tear the skin. Then, rub some of the softened herb butter over the breast meat (under the skin). Rub more butter inside the cavity of the turkey as well as all over on the outside of the turkey. Proceed with cooking the turkey according to your preference. Notes\n*Butter: If you've brined your turkey or are using a salt injected turkey, I recommend using unsalted butter so as not to add extra unnecessary salt. Also, you must use softened butter to make the garlic herb butter for your Thanksgiving turkey (here’s my tutorial on how to soften butter quickly).\nShaping the compound butter is only necessary if you're preparing it for later use or want to serve it on your holiday table alongside dinner rolls, etc. (i.e. as a flavored butter than as a rub for your roast turkey.)\nDid you make this?

    "text": "Back in spring 2021, Eyewitness News\nshared the story of two sisters in Britain who were using TikTok to encourage other teens to read.\nMireille and Elodie Lee's\n\"A Life of Literature\" account has grown dramatically since then, and now they're stepping into the publishing business.\nThe Lee sisters' move to become publishers is all more remarkable when you consider Mireille is just 18 years old and Elodie recently turned 16.\nTogether they have found fame promoting the books they love on TikTok and now they are looking to deepen the connection with fans and broaden their reach.\n\"We've been building this audience together on TikTok and Instagram for a long time now,\" said Mireille to Eyewitness News entertainment reporter Sandy Kenyon.\n\"It's been an amazing experience. All of the offers that we have received have been unimaginable,\" said Elodie.\nThe sisters grew up close in Brighton, England.\n\"When we were little, we were obsessed with the library,\" said Mireille.\nThey took to TikTok early, starting \"A Life of Literature\" and encouraging their peers to read the books they love.\n\"And, our love of books is behind our new venture, Bindery,\" added Mireille.\nThe Lee sisters are part of a diverse group under the Bindery umbrella.\nBindery is the brainchild of Matt Kaye.\n\"When I saw what was happening with people like Mireille and Elodie on social media, like how many books they were selling and how passionate their audience was, I got really excited about this idea that they could do even more in the publishing world,\" Kaye said.\nHis new company is a place to interact directly with fans.\nWhat's even more exciting about the new venture is the opportunity for these influencers to become publishers.\n\"We get to give unpublished authors a bigger chance to get their books published because they're just as deserving as the other bigger authors in the industry, but they don't necessarily get that chance,\" said Elodie. \"So that's what Bindery is about and that's what everyone's trying to do on the platform.\"\nOnce a manuscript is accepted for publication, Bindery acts like a traditional publisher when it comes to editing and cover design and the like, but those who follow Mireille, Elodie and the others get to follow along as that process unfolds.\nReaders get to be a part of a book's journey to the point of sale.",

Temples have been increasingly subjected to acts of vandalism and attacks, coinciding with the surging presence of Khalistani groups in the country, something that India has been probing Canada to take action against. There has been a concerning escalation in violence against Hindu communities in Canada. Temples have been increasingly subjected to acts of vandalism and attacks, coinciding with the surging presence of Khalistani groups in the country, something that India has been probing Canada to take action against. As many as 14 gunshots were fired at the residence of the son of a Hindu temple president in Surrey, in the Canadian province of British Columbia. In the wake of this unsettling incident, Canadian authorities are currently investigating the matter, details of which in media reports only include the efforts being made in the probe and do not confirm if any suspects have been identified. The house in this case is of the son of Satish Kumar, who is the president of the Lakshmi Narayan Mandir in Surrey. The man whose house came under attack is a Hindu businessman and the incident transpired on December 27, 2023, at around 8:03 am. The resident is located in the 14900 block of 80 Avenue. Surrey Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) responded to a report of shots fired at the house. According to a statement from RCMP, no one was injured during the incident. However, the police added that the residence involved \"sustained damage consistent with bullet holes.\" trending now \"Police remained in the area, examining the scene, speaking with witnesses and canvassing the neighbourhood for CCTV footage. The Surrey RCMP General Investigation Unit has conduct of the investigation. Officers are still working to determine the motive of this incident,\" the statement added. The police requested anyone with more information about the incident, including dashcam footage of the incident, to get in contact with them. This attack comes against the backdrop of a growing diplomatic row between India and Canada. The Surrey RCMP General Investigation Unit has taken charge of the investigation and is working to ascertain the motive behind this targeted attack.

    "title": "Risankizumab (Skyrizi) Dose Optimization Effective, Safe for Patients with Psoriasis",
    "text": "Patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis using dose optimization for risankizumab will find it efficacious and safe, according to new findings, aligning with the positive results of dose optimization seen with other biologics. 1\nThese findings represent the conclusion of a recent letter to the editor highlighting research into optimizing dosing for risankizumab, an interleukin (IL)-23 inhibitor for the chronic inflammatory skin disease psoriasis. This research was authored in part by Jensen Yeung, from the division of dermatology at Women's College Hospital in Toronto, Canada.\n“While optimized dosing strategies have been elucidated for other biologics, risankizumab's potential has not been fully explored,” Yeung and colleagues wrote. “This study aims to explore the effectiveness and safety of risankizumab dose optimization in adult patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.” 1,2\nStudy Design A multicenter, international, retrospective study was conducted by the investigators, during which the team reviewed patient records from tertiary academic dermatology clinics found within both Canada and Portugal. They determined their primary outcome would be a 90%-or-greater improvement in participants’ Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI90) scores and the achievement of a Physician Global Assessment (PGA) score of clear or almost clear (PGA 0/1).\nThe research team made up their study population of adults aged 18 years and older who had moderate-to-severe psoriasis. These subjects were treated with the standard on-label risankizumab regimen of 150 mg administered subcutaneously at the 0 and 4-week mark, followed every 12 weeks.\nAdjustments to treatments, including shifts in the dosing intervals, were decided upon based on individual needs of the participants. The team monitored participant safety in their documentation of adverse events (AEs) and rates of treatment cessation.\nAmong the 511 subjects in the study treated with subcutaneous risankizumab, 16% were shown to require dose optimization. These subjects’ average age was found to be 51.4 years, with 63.4% of the group being male.\nBefore beginning risankizumab, these individuals had failed approximately 1.1 non-biologic systemic treatments and 0.91 biologics. Among the prior biologics were guselkumab, adalimumab, and ustekinumab, while the most commonly used non-biologic options were acitretin, methotrexate, and cyclosporine.\nNotable Findings on Optimization The research team reported that the average PASI score among subjects was 3.7 at the time of the subjects dose optimization. The team added that participants had been on the standard dose of risankizumab for an average of 212.2 days.\nThe investigators found that 72% of subjects switched to an 8-week dosing schedule, noting that this was chiefly due to their initial regimen response being inadequate. Only 4.8% were reported to have chosen to extend their predetermined dosing intervals for personal reasons, and these individuals had a PASI score of 0 prior to the optimization decision.\nFollowing the trial participants’ dose optimization, the researchers noted that the average follow-up period had been 190.2 days, concluding that 90.2% of participants were successful in achieving either PASI90 or a PGA 0/1 score. The team also highlighted that 37.8% reached PASI100 and that 80.5% attained a PASI score of 2 or lower.\nThey added that 54.9% had a PASI score which was under 1. The subjects who opted for a longer dosing interval maintained their PASI response, while 89.7% of the subjects who optimized to a shorter interval were successful in achieving PASI90 or PGA 0/1.\nThe investigators highlighted the fact that only 3 participants reported at least a single AE, suggesting that AEs were rare. A single case of alopecia resulted in cessation of treatment, and there was 1 unrelated thrombosis event reported.\nAll AEs transpired in individuals who had a shortened dosing schedule. After the dose was optimized, it was found that 18.3% of subjects discontinued risankizumab. 73% of these discontinuations resulted from insufficient efficacy.\n“Dose optimization of biologics is relatively well-studied in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, with our previous reports affirming enhancement of patient outcomes without compromising safety,” they wrote. “Our current study aligns with these findings, marking, to our knowledge, the first to showcase the effectiveness and safety of dose optimized risankizumab for plaque psoriasis.”\nThe investigators did acknowledge, however, that their outcomes’ generalizability may be held back by their study’s heterogeneous population and its limited sample size, suggesting a need for rigorous and controlled studies.\nReferences\nBagit, A., Maliyar, K., Mansour, M., Georgakopoulos, J.R., Rankin, B., Lytvyn, Y., Zaaroura, H., Park, Y.J., Wang, E., Mufti, A., Torres, T., Le, A.M., Vender, R., Prajapati, V.H. and Yeung, J.
