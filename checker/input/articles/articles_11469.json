    "text": "Superconductores y materiales diamagnéticos, que repelen los campos magnéticos, pueden levitar sobre imanes y utilizarse para crear sensores avanzados aplicables en contextos científicos y cotidianos. (Imagen de referencia)\nEn el Instituto de Ciencia y Tecnología de Okinawa (OIST), en Japón, un equipo de especialistas en materiales levitantes dirigido por el profesor Jason Twamley ha logrado avances significativos. Los científicos han conseguido hacer levitar un fragmento de grafito sobre un conjunto de imanes, permaneciendo en un estado de ingravidez casi absoluta.\nEste avance, presentado en un artículo en la revista Applied Physics Letters, no solo demuestra el potencial de la levitación magnética, sino que también destaca por su independencia de fuentes de energía externas. Esto posiciona a la tecnología como una candidata ideal para el desarrollo de una nueva generación de sensores altamente sensibles, aplicables tanto en la ciencia como en el mercado de consumo, prometiendo mediciones con una precisión y eficacia inigualables.\nEl material en cuestión, el grafito, es diamagnético, es decir, repele los campos magnéticos. Al posicionarlo sobre un sustrato ferromagnético adecuado, se crea una plataforma de levitación que opera sin necesidad de conexión con su entorno, similar a los trenes de levitación magnética que utilizan imanes superconductores para generar un campo magnético intenso.\nLa “amortiguación de Foucault” Sin embargo, la aplicación de esta tecnología se enfrenta a varios retos, entre ellos la “amortiguación de Foucault”, según el comunicado de prensa del OIST. Este efecto describe la pérdida de energía de un sistema oscilante debido a fuerzas externas, un fenómeno especialmente problemático cuando el conductor eléctrico, como el grafito, se desplaza a través de un campo magnético intenso.\nPara contrarrestar esta pérdida de energía, los investigadores del OIST idearon una solución ingeniosa: recubrieron microesferas de grafito con sílice y cera, transformándolas en aislantes eléctricos.\n“Alcanzar este nivel de precisión requiere una ingeniería rigurosa para aislar la plataforma de perturbaciones externas como vibraciones, campos magnéticos y ruido eléctrico”, aclara Twamley.\nMinimizar la energía cinética Además de los esfuerzos científicos por mitigar la amortiguación de Foucault, persiste otro desafío: disminuir la energía cinética en plataformas oscilantes. Tal como se menciona en el comunicado oficial, reducirla no solo mejora la sensibilidad del sensor, sino que también permite explorar el régimen cuántico para mediciones de precisión.\nAsí, en su búsqueda de soluciones, los investigadores desarrollaron un innovador material a partir del grafito. A través de una modificación química, lograron convertir el grafito en un aislante eléctrico, una transformación que impide la pérdida de energía y facilita la levitación del material en el vacío.\nEl experimento involucró un control continuo del movimiento de la plataforma y la aplicación de una fuerza magnética de retroalimentación para reducir su movimiento. “El calor genera movimiento, pero con un control y correcciones en tiempo real, podemos enfriar el sistema efectivamente”, señala Twamley.\n“La retroalimentación ajusta el índice de amortiguación del sistema, que es la rapidez con la que pierde energía, así que, controlando activamente la amortiguación, reducimos la energía cinética del sistema, enfriándolo de forma efectiva”, agrega.\nEste control preciso sobre la plataforma no solo tiene el potencial de responder preguntas fundamentales de la física cuántica para determinar el papel de la gravedad dentro de este marco, sino que también podría llevar al desarrollo de gravímetros atómicos más sensibles que los actuales. El equipo continúa trabajando para eliminar perturbaciones externas y mejorar su sistema, prometiendo avances significativos en el campo de la medición de precisión.\nFelipe Espinosa Wang con información de OIST y Science Alert.",

    "text": "—Largest Global Clinical Trial Ever Conducted in Bronchiectasis Demonstrates Statistically Significant and Clinically Meaningful Reduction in Frequency of Pulmonary Exacerbations Versus Placebo—\n—Brensocatib 25 mg is the First Investigational Therapy for Bronchiectasis to Show a Statistically Significant Reduction in the Rate of Lung Function Decline—\n—Brensocatib is Currently Under Priority Review with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration—\nBRIDGEWATER, N.J. , April 23, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Insmed Incorporated (Nasdaq: INSM), a people-first global biopharmaceutical company striving to deliver first- and best-in-class therapies to transform the lives of patients facing serious diseases, today announced that positive results from the pivotal phase 3 ASPEN study of brensocatib in patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis were published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). The landmark ASPEN study is the largest clinical trial ever conducted in bronchiectasis, a serious, chronic, and progressive inflammatory pulmonary disease that today has no approved therapies.\n\"Bronchiectasis is a debilitating disease characterized by pulmonary exacerbations, which contribute to lung function decline and severely impact quality of life,\" said lead author James Chalmers , MBChB, PhD, Professor and Consultant Respiratory Physician at the School of Medicine, University of Dundee , UK. \"With limited treatment options and no approved therapies, the burden of exacerbations remains high, with many patients experiencing multiple episodes each year. For the first time, the ASPEN data published in NEJM demonstrates that a treatment which targets inflammation can reduce exacerbations and slow the rate of lung function decline. This is an exciting development and represents a potentially transformative breakthrough for people living with bronchiectasis, offering new hope for patients with this challenging condition if brensocatib is approved.\"\nAs previously reported, the ASPEN study met its primary endpoint, with both brensocatib doses achieving statistical and clinical significance for the reduction in the annualized rate of pulmonary exacerbations versus placebo over the 52-week treatment period. The annualized rate of exacerbations was 1.02 for brensocatib 10 mg, 1.04 for brensocatib 25 mg, and 1.29 for placebo. These rates were significantly lower in the brensocatib 10 mg and 25 mg groups versus placebo with rate ratios of 0.79 (adjusted P=0.004) and 0.81 (adjusted P=0.005), respectively.\nBoth dosage strengths of brensocatib also met several exacerbation-related secondary endpoints, including significantly prolonging the time to first exacerbation and significantly increasing the proportion of patients remaining exacerbation-free over the treatment period. Patients treated with brensocatib 25 mg also showed significantly lower lung function decline at week 52 as measured by post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume over one second (FEV1).\nBrensocatib was well-tolerated in the study. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurring in at least 5.0% of patients treated with either dose of brensocatib and more frequently than in placebo were COVID-19 (15.8%, 20.9%, 15.8%), nasopharyngitis (7.7%, 6.3%, 7.6%), cough (7.0%, 6.1%, 6.4%), and headache (6.7%, 8.5%, and 6.9%) for brensocatib 10 mg, brensocatib 25 mg, and placebo, respectively.\n\"Currently, people with bronchiectasis have no approved treatments to address the frequent, damaging exacerbations that are the hallmark of this disease,\" said Martina Flammer , M.D., MBA, Chief Medical Officer of Insmed. \"Brensocatib has the potential to be the first approved therapy to fill this critical unmet need in the care of patients with bronchiectasis, as well as the first approved dipeptidyl peptidase 1 (DPP1) inhibitor—a new mechanism of action with the potential to address a range of neutrophil-mediated inflammatory diseases. The ASPEN trial represents a transformative step forward for the millions of people globally diagnosed with bronchiectasis.\"\nBrensocatib is currently under Priority Review with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, with a target action date of August 12, 2025 , under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA).\nAbout ASPEN\nThe total number of active sites in ASPEN was 391 sites in 35 countries. Adult patients (ages 18 to 85 years) were randomized 1:1:1 and adolescent patients (ages 12 to About Bronchiectasis\nBronchiectasis is a serious, chronic lung disease in which the bronchi become permanently dilated due to a cycle of infection, inflammation, and lung tissue damage. The condition is marked by frequent pulmonary exacerbations requiring antibiotic therapy and/or hospitalizations. Symptoms include chronic cough, excessive sputum production, shortness of breath, and repeated respiratory infections, which can worsen the underlying condition. Today, approximately 500,000 patients in the U.S., 600,000 patients in the EU5 ( France , Germany , Italy , Spain , and UK), and 150,000 patients in Japan have been diagnosed with bronchiectasis, and there are currently no approved therapies specifically targeting bronchiectasis in these regions.\nAbout Brensocatib\nBrensocatib is a small molecule, oral, reversible inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase 1 (DPP1) being developed by Insmed for the treatment of patients with bronchiectasis, chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps, hidradenitis suppurativa, and other neutrophil-mediated diseases. DPP1 is an enzyme responsible for activating neutrophil serine proteases (NSPs), such as neutrophil elastase, in neutrophils when they are formed in the bone marrow. Neutrophils are the most common type of white blood cell and play an essential role in pathogen destruction and inflammatory mediation. In chronic inflammatory lung diseases, neutrophils accumulate in the airways and result in excessive active NSPs that cause lung destruction and inflammation. Brensocatib may decrease the damaging effects of inflammatory diseases such as bronchiectasis by inhibiting DPP1 and its activation of NSPs. Brensocatib is an investigational drug product that has not been approved for any indication in any jurisdiction.\nAbout Insmed\nInsmed Incorporated is a people-first global biopharmaceutical company striving to deliver first- and best-in-class therapies to transform the lives of patients facing serious diseases.

    "text": "BRIGHTON, England, Dec 28 (Reuters) - Tottenham Hotspur's top-four ambitions suffered a blow as they lost 4-2 at Brighton & Hove Albion in the Premier League on Thursday with only a late rally saving them from their heaviest defeat since Ange Postecoglou became manager.\nVictory would have put injury-hit Spurs above Manchester City into fourth spot but they were mauled on the south coast as a Brighton side also missing key players ran riot.\nA powerful early strike by Josh Hinshelwood and Joao Pedro's penalty gave the hosts a deserved 2-0 lead at halftime as Tottenham struggled to deal with Brighton's intensity.\nThe visitors responded in the second half with Richarlison having a goal disallowed but when halftime substitute Pervis Estupinan sent a thunderbolt past Spurs keeper Guglielmo Vicario and Joao Pedro netted a second penalty the game seemed over.\nHowever, when Tottenham's late substitute Alejo Veliz fired home from close range in the 75th minute and Ben Davies scored with a header a miraculous comeback suddenly looked possible.\nMidfielder Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg hit the post for Spurs in stoppage time as Brighton looked nervy but they held on to move into eighth place in the table on 30 points while Tottenham remain fifth on 36, a point behind Manchester City in fourth.\n(Reporting by Martyn Herman; Editing by Ken Ferris)\n(( ; +442075427933; Reuters Messaging: @reuters.net))\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

    "title": "Gunman found guilty of murder in California road rage shooting that killed 6-year-old Aiden Leos",
    "text": "SANTA ANA, Calif. -- A California jury on Thursday found Marcus Anthony Eriz guilty of second-degree murder in the fatal shooting of 6-year-old Aiden Leos in a road rage incident on a freeway in 2021.\nEriz was also found guilty of causing great bodily injury and death, and shooting at an occupied vehicle. He is facing the possibility of up to 40 years in prison.\nThe verdict was announced Thursday morning. Seated alongside his defense attorney, Eriz did not visibly react when the jury's decision was read aloud.\nAiden was fatally shot on May 21, 2021, 10 days after his birthday. He was sitting in a booster seat and his mother, Joanna Cloonan, was driving him to kindergarten at the time of the shooting.\nAccording to accounts from Cloonan and witnesses who stopped to help her, another car cut off Cloonan, and she responded with a hand gesture. The car slipped in behind Cloonan, and then someone inside fired a shot through the rear of her car.\nAfter a two-week manhunt, Eriz, now 26 years old, and his girlfriend, Wynne Lee, were arrested in connection with the shooting.\nLee was allegedly driving the car when the shooting took place. Investigators said Eriz was the passenger who shot at Cloonan's vehicle. She faces up to four years behind bars if convicted on charges of being an accessory after the fact and having a concealed firearm in a vehicle.\nThe\ncouple had pleaded not guilty.\nWhile Eriz's trial has ended, Lee has a pretrial hearing scheduled for Feb. 9.\nThe key question the jury considered during deliberations was Eriz's intent and state of mind when he fired his Glock 17 9mm at the Cloonan's car, piercing her vehicle and killing Aiden.\nEriz and his defense team have conceded that he did indeed fire his weapon at the car. But his\ndefense attorney argued that it was a spontaneous act with no intent to kill the child.\n\"The age and status of the victim is irrelevant, when you're talking about Mr. Eriz's mental state,\" defense attorney Randall Bethune said in Wednesday's closing statemtn. \"There is no evidence whatsoever that Mr. Eriz even knew a child was in the car.\"\nBethune said his client was willing to accept responsibility to a lesser charge.\n\"Mr. Eriz acted rashly that day. He made a split decision act,\" Bethune said. \"This is a voluntary manslaughter case. Mr. Eriz is not a murderer.\"\nOrange County prosecutors argued that whether Eriz intended to kill Aiden or not, he acted with implied malice that led to the child's death.\n\"There can be no greater example of callous, cold-hearted, disregard for human life than firing at someone over a gesture, from a moving car as they drove away,\" said senior deputy district attorney Dan Feldman.\nEriz told investigators that he had started carrying around the Glock because he was noticing increased hostility on local freeways. When asked why he shot at Cloonan's car, he couldn't think of an answer, other than to say: \"I don't have an answer. Because I'm stupid. I didn't think of anything. I didn't think of the consequences or anyone.\"\nDuring\n her testimony, Cloonan described what happened on the freeway after the shooting.\n\"I remember being surrounded. I couldn't see what was going on with him. I looked at the back of my car and saw a hole. And I asked a man, 'Is that a bullet hole? Is that what happened? and he said, 'It appears to be so.'\"\nToward the end of her testimony, Cloonan was shown a picture of Aiden and she began crying on the stand.",

    "text": "Positiva sesión para el Dow Jones , que acabó la sesión del jueves 28 de diciembre con leves ascensos del 0,14% , hasta los 37.710,10 puntos .\nEl Dow Jones Industrial Average marcó la cifra máxima de 37.778,85 puntos y la cifra mínima de 37.650,98 puntos . El rango de cotización para el selectivo entre su punto más alto y el más bajo (máximo-mínimo) durante este día se situó en el 0,34% .\nSi consideramos los datos de los últimos siete días, el índice acumula un incremento del 1,69% , de modo que desde hace un año mantiene aún una ganancia del 13,44% .\ny un 18,51% por encima de su cotización mínima en lo que va de año (31.819,14 puntos).\n¿Qué es el Dow Jones? El Dow Jones Industrial Average, llamado también \"el Dow\", es un índice bursátil compuesto por 30 de las empresas más grandes de Estados Unidos. El valor del Dow se calcula mediante la suma de los precios de las acciones de estas 30 empresas y se utiliza como un indicador clave del estado de la economía del mercado de valores estadounidense. El índice fue creado en 1896 por el editor del Wall Street Journal, Charles Dow e inicialmente contenía solo 12 empresas. El número de empresas se aumentó a 30 en 1928 y ese número se ha mantenido desde entonces.\nEl Dow Jones es importante porque inversores, analistas y medios de comunicación de todo el mundo siguen de cerca su evolución para conocer el estado del mercado de EE.UU., básicamente porque al incluir a algunas de las empresas más influyentes de los sectores industriales, financieros y de servicios públicos, el Dow no deja de ser un indicador crucial o de la economía estadounidense en su conjunto. Aunque se piensa que es el más antiguo de Estados Unidos, el primero fue el Dow Jones Transportation Average, creado en 1886.\nAdemás, el Dow también sirve como un barómetro de la confianza de los inversores en la economía y en la política económica del gobierno de Estados Unidos. Cuando éste sube, se considera que la confianza también lo hace, mientras que una caída del índice puede implicar preocupaciones sobre el futuro de la economía.\n¿Quieres publicitar en Cronista.com?

    "title": "“I was lucky”: Diabetic has a warning for weight loss drug users",
    "text": "MESA, Ariz. - New weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy are pretty popular, but they come with a warning from health experts and patients. The most common side effects of these drugs are nausea, vomiting, and fainting. But there&apos;s also been a spike in emergency room visits, including one in November at Banner Desert Medical Center in Mesa. Dave Wilhelmi has been battling Type 2 diabetes for 10 years and his doctor thought the new medicine on the block, Ozempic, might help. \"My blood sugars, my A1C were a little bit high and so this would be a better way to control my Type 2 diabetes,\" said Wilhelmi. But after a few months on Ozempic and two other diabetes drugs and increasingly higher doses, the trouble started, and it was time to get to the ER. Related \"They confirmed what I kind of suspected. I was severely dehydrated, and that can happen when you take some of these drugs.\" Dave is not alone. Poison control centers across the country are seeing a spike in calls connected to these drugs. \"Over the last couple of years, we’ve seen a doubling in the numbers of calls reported to our center,\" said Dr. Bryan Kuhn, a pharmacist and toxicologist at Banner Health. Dr. Kuhn says most issues come from a high dose to improper use. \"When we see patients taking the higher dose or if they accidentally or inadvertently take a double dose or some sort of the dose in medication, these otherwise tolerable and self-limiting symptoms can be quite uncomfortable and potentially harmful.\" Dave’s three-day hospital stay came after a bad reaction to another diabetes drug, according to his doctor. Now back at home and on the mend, Dave has a warning for other Ozempic users. \"If you wait too long, it could be fatal. I was lucky.\" Related Doctors are also urging people to stick with FDA-approved drugs , not similar drugs made at compounding pharmacies that can come with the wrong amount of ingredients. As for Dave, he’s getting back on Ozempic without the other drug that caused a bad reaction.",

    "title": "¿Cómo reportar a CFE cuando hay un apagón? Estas son las causas – Publimetro México",
    "text": "El aumento de las temperaturas en diversas regiones del país ha generado interrupciones en el [ suministro de energía eléctrica](https://www.publimetro.com.mx/noticias/2024/05/08/apagones-en-mexico-por-que-ocurrieron-en-varios-estados-del-pais/), lo que ha llevado a la Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE) a recordar a los usuarios la importancia de reportar tales incidentes para una pronta solución. Ante esta situación, la empresa ha destacado la utilidad de su aplicación móvil CFE Contigo, una herramienta que permite a los usuarios reportar fallas en el suministro eléctrico de manera rápida y sencilla. Esta aplicación, que ha estado en funcionamiento durante varios años, requiere que el usuario proporcione su nombre y número de servicio para identificar la ubicación exacta del problema. Además, permite detallar el tipo de falla eléctrica experimentada, ya sea una interrupción total o intermitente, así como especificar la ubicación precisa del problema. Una vez que se ha realizado el reporte a través de la aplicación, se genera un número de seguimiento que permite al usuario dar seguimiento al progreso de la resolución del problema por parte de la Comisión Sin embargo, la empresa también ha subrayado que existen otras opciones disponibles para reportar interrupciones en el suministro eléctrico. Los usuarios pueden comunicarse con el centro de atención telefónica, así como a través de sus plataformas en línea, para informar sobre las fallas en el servicio. Se enfatiza que al realizar estos reportes, el personal cuenta con información precisa sobre la zona afectada, lo que facilita la pronta atención del problema. ¿Qué provocó los apagones? Los apagones se registraron principalmente por un incremento de la demanda de energía eléctrica. Es decir, tras el aumento de temperaturas, la gente comenzó a usar más ventiladores, aires acondicionados y otros aparatos eléctricos, lo que provocó una carga mayor en el sistema eléctrico. Aunque esto no significa que CFE no cuente con los márgenes de reserva necesarios, simplemente rebasó sus parámetros. Por ello, se exhorta a los usuarios a utilizar las diferentes vías disponibles para reportar tales incidentes y contribuir así a una respuesta más eficiente.",
