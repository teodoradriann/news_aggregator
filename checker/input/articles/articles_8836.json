    "text": "A new video appears to show a U.S. military member guarding a room of illegal immigrants released by President Joe Biden’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) at the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. The [video](https://youtu.be/m35rEy7c-64) of the migrants at the airport in Atlanta, which was first [obtained](https://dailycaller.com/2024/01/31/exclusive-video-appears-to-show-migrants-tucked-away-in-hidden-room-under-military-guard-at-major-us-airport/) by The Daily Caller, was recorded Tuesday by Republican state Sen. Colton Moore. Moore told The Daily Caller that he was notified by a “whistleblower” at the airport regarding the hidden room of illegal immigrants and that the whistleblower had observed an increase in illegal immigrants passing through the airport over the past several months. The video allegedly shows a U.S. service member guarding the entrance of the room, which was filled with illegal immigrants and “Team Libertad” volunteers. Team Libertad is a [volunteer program](https://www.facebook.com/teamlibertadatl) that provides illegal immigrants with assistance at the Atlanta airport. “We’re all getting them flights to where they need to be,” a Team Libertad volunteer can be heard saying in the video. “These are just recently documented travelers getting released from ICE getting to where they need to be.” The volunteer added, “There’s people that, they get dropped off here from ICE detention with no help.” [READ MORE: Pic: Illegal immigrants can fly without ID under Biden admin: Reports](https://americanmilitarynews.com/2024/01/pic-illegal-immigrants-can-fly-without-id-under-biden-admin-reports/) The Daily Caller reported that the affiliation of the alleged military member in the video has not yet been revealed; however, a Georgia National Guard spokesperson said they were “not aware of the incident in question or any such activity involving the Georgia National Guard at the airport.” Moore told The Daily Caller that the man dressed in a military uniform took his phone as he was recording evidence of the illegal immigrant room at the airport. Toward the end of the video, voices can be heard shouting “no” and “you’re done” at Moore while he was attempting to record illegal immigrants at the airport. “The room was absolutely packed with people from every continent on this planet,” Moore told The Daily Caller. “When I took my phone and reached it up above the guy to get a better view of all the illegals in the room, that’s when chaos broke out. That’s when the U.S. Army guy took the phone. It was a scrimmage between he and I in order to get the phone back. And then he proceeded to tell me to get out of there and just made a real big scene out of it.”",

    "text": "中国经济开门红 应对外部挑战有底气\n2025年一季度，中国经济实现开门红。\n“国民经济实现良好开局，高质量发展向新向好。”在国新办4月16日举行的新闻发布会上，国家统计局副局长盛来运介绍，初步核算，一季度国内生产总值（GDP）318758亿元，按不变价格计算，同比增长5.4%，比上年四季度环比增长1.2%。\n在全球主要经济体中名列前茅\n“增长”一词在这场发布会上频频出现。工业被喻为国民经济的“压舱石”。一季度，我国工业生产增长加快，全国规模以上工业增加值同比增长6.5%，比去年全年加快0.7个百分点。\n3月份，全国规模以上工业增加值同比增长7.7%。中泰证券研究所政策组首席分析师杨畅注意到，在去年工业生产基数较高的情况下，今年3月仍然实现了较高增速，表明我国工业生产仍然很强。\n消费、投资、出口被视为拉动经济增长的“三驾马车”，其中，消费是拉动经济增长的“主引擎”。民生银行首席经济学家温彬认为，我国经济开年运行平稳，尽管外需有所放缓，但政策发力对内需形成提振。\n一季度，消费在政策的推动下持续改善。社会消费品零售总额为124671亿元，同比增长4.6%，比上年全年加快1.1个百分点。\n在投资方面，一季度，全国固定资产投资（不含农户）103174亿元，同比增长4.2%，比上年全年加快1个百分点。扣除房地产开发投资，全国固定资产投资增长8.3%。\n盛来运指出，前期出台的宏观政策和今年以来扩容加码的增量政策叠加发力，有效扩大了需求、促进了生产、激发了活力、增强了信心。3月份，制造业采购经理人指数是50.5%，环比上升了0.3个百分点，连续两个月回升。\n一系列政策举措为民营企业投资创造公平的营商环境，民间投资由上年全年下降转为增长。民营企业的活力动力不断显现，一季度制造业中的民间投资同比增长9.7%，基础设施投资中的民间投资增长9.3%，均比各自领域的平均增速快。\n此外，盛来运表示，一季度GDP同比增长5.4%，增速高于去年全国5%的增速，也高于去年一季度5.3%的增速，还高于不少全球主要经济体一季度的经济增速，在全球主要经济体中名列前茅。在全球经济增长乏力的情况下，中国将为世界经济的稳定发挥重要作用。\n高质量发展持续向新向好\n一季度，中国经济在实现“量”的合理增长的同时，新质生产力也在培育壮大，高质量发展向新向好的大势没有改变。\n5个维度反映出这一趋势。盛来运介绍，第一个维度是创新持续推进，新质生产力培育壮大。第二个维度是协调发展持续改善。第三个维度是高水平开放继续推进。第四个维度是绿色转型、绿色发展扎实推进。第五个维度是民生改善和安全发展继续取得新进展。\n一季度，各地方加大对创新的支持力度，尤其是人工智能、量子科技等一批先进技术不断推出和应用，带动了高技术产业发展。DeepSeek、宇树人形机器人等一批成果的应用，既彰显了中国科技创新的实力，同时也增强了市场的信心。\n新兴产业正在蓬勃发展。一季度，新能源汽车、3D打印设备、工业机器人产品产量同比分别增长45.4%、44.9%、26.0%。\n盛来运指出，一季度，规模以上高技术制造业增加值同比增长9.7%，信息传输、软件和信息技术服务业增加值增长10.3%，这两个数据也显示出我国创新动力在增强。\n工业向高端化、智能化、绿色化转型的趋势明显。从需求结构来看，当下我国投资增速实际上不高，但是高技术产业投资比重是在提升的。一季度，高技术产业投资同比增长6.5%，占全部投资的比重为10.3%，提高0.3个百分点。\n民生改善和安全发展继续取得新进展。政府高度重视加大民生方面的支出，对民生方面的支出占比持续提高。能源保供有力有效，一季度就业形势总体稳定，城镇调查失业率稳中略降。一季度末，外出务工农村劳动力总量18795万人，同比增长1.1%。\n此外，全国城镇调查失业率平均值为5.3%。居民收入增长与经济增长基本同步。一季度，全国居民人均可支配收入12179元，同比名义增长5.5%，扣除价格因素实际增长5.6%。\n安全发展得到加强。作为防风险的重点领域，房地产行业也出现了不少积极变化。1-3月，全国新建商品房销售面积21869万平方米，同比下降3.0%，降幅比1-2月收窄2.1个百分点；新建商品房销售额20798亿元，下降2.1%，降幅收窄0.5个百分点。\n“房地产止跌回稳的态势明显。”广东省城规院住房政策研究中心首席研究员李宇嘉说，一季度，房地产行业从上游开工到下游销售，相关的跌幅明显收窄。\n有底气、有信心、有能力应对外部挑战\n近期，美国“对等关税”风波愈演愈烈。面对冲击，我国外贸韧性依然强劲。今年一季度，我国货物贸易进出口10.3万亿元，同比增长1.3%。其中，出口6.13万亿元，增长6.9%。\n“我们坚决反对美国搞关税壁垒和贸易霸凌，这种做法损人不利己，违背了经济规律和世界贸易的原则，对世界经济秩序造成严重冲击，拖累世界经济复苏。”盛来运表示，中方坚决采取一系列反制措施，不仅是维护自身发展利益的需要，也是维护世界多边贸易体系和世贸组织规则的正当之举。\n谈及加征高额关税对中国的影响，盛来运说：“从短期来看，美国加征高额关税会对我国经济和外贸带来一定压力，但是改变不了中国经济持续长期向好的大势。中国经济基础稳、优势多、韧性强、潜力大，我们有底气、有信心、有能力应对外部挑战，实现既定发展目标。”\n盛来运说，中国经济有基础，内需有支撑。中国是世界第二大经济体，连续15年稳居第一制造业大国的地位，产业体系完整、配套能力强，经济发展底盘稳、基础牢。同时，中国有14亿多人口，市场规模巨大，人均GDP超过1.3万美元，正处在消费升级的关键阶段，市场成长性好，无论是投资还是消费空间都非常大，将支撑中国经济持续发展。他指出，我国依靠内需和创新驱动共同推动经济增长的新格局正在形成。\n目前，我国已成为150多个国家和地区的重要贸易伙伴，外贸多元化市场格局正在形成，这意味着我国对某一个国家单一出口市场的依存度在下降。盛来运举例，2018年，我国对美国的出口额占出口总额的比重是19.2%，去年已经下降到14.7%。\n针对当前的外部变化，我国应对有经验，并且政策有保障。盛来运谈到，当下，一揽子政策正在发力显效，“下阶段会根据外部形势的变化及时推出增量政策，丰富的政策‘工具箱’是应对外部的冲击和挑战的保障”。\n此外，中国的企业家敢闯敢拼，中国人民智慧勤劳，都是我国应对巨大风险挑战的基础和底气。“我们对中国经济后期的走势以及发展的前景充满信心。”盛来运说。",

    "title": "DEVOTIONAL: The inspiration of Harold Gomes | Community | normantranscript.com",
    "text": "Harold Gomes wanted us all to be brave. “A warrior” is how his sister described him, but one who as “tender” and “authoritative,” she said before his funeral Mass. As long as I knew him, he was on a ventilator and in a wheelchair, due to the afflictions of muscular dystrophy. And yet, even in the confines of his illness, he lived so freely. On a pilgrimage to Lourdes, France, he felt a closeness to God that changed his life. Harold wrote about what he learned regarding his suffering on that pilgrimage. “God permits suffering in order to bring a greater good out of it — the Crucifix is proof! I was moved when I learned that my suffering has great value when it is united with the suffering of Jesus on the Cross. I can offer my suffering to save souls! ... I was in a wheelchair precisely because God loved me!” At his funeral Mass, his sister made clear that Harold wasn’t a delusional recluse. He wasn’t trying to escape. He truly saw love and inspiration in the message of Christianity. He worked tirelessly to spread that message in his daily life. Earlier this year, he wrote about the conversion of St. Paul as “a miracle of God’s transforming grace. What the Lord did for him, he can do for anyone.” “It is Christmas Eve as I write this message,” Harold wrote last year. “The prospect of going to Christmas Mass, whether in a few hours at midnight or tomorrow in the midmorning, is now simply impossible for me. I am used to not being able to go to Holy Mass on occasion, and most recently I joined with everyone else in not being able to go during the quarantine. Still, it is difficult. It is even more difficult to have to miss Mass on December 25. God knows that I would like to go and rejoice in the birth of Christ, who has become very dear to me in the past years.” Harold understood the truth of eternity that his Catholic faith taught him. He understood that amid suffering, showing the light of something greater than the turmoil, pain and distractions of everyday life can be an important gift. This time of year can often be reduced to Santa Claus and trees and whatever New Year’s traditions we observe. But it is really about a radical vulnerability that Harold Gomes had no choice but to live. His choice was to live it with radiant love, with a generosity that insisted that Christianity is more than a pious story, but a love that transforms lives. It transformed his life and the lives of his family. I first met Harold because he reached out to me wanting to communicate the Gospel in the world. He wanted to go on TV, to do anything to share God’s love for him with others. To say he was inspiring, as he was struggling to breathe, would clearly be an understatement. While I can’t believe Harold is gone — the grace of his life was a blessing in the D.C. area — the timing of his death seems appropriate. We’re a mess politically and otherwise. Harold will advocate for us from a place more powerful than the nation’s capital. Pray for the repose of the soul of Harold Gomes as we enter into a new year. At the same time, ask him for his supernatural advocacy. He was a “warrior” here for eternal good and will continue to be, reminding us that success in life is about love in the midst of our sufferings, more than anything else.",

    "title": "South Dakota Bishops Warn ‘Fiducia Supplicans’ May Normalize Serious Sin - CatholicVote org",
    "text": "CV NEWS FEED // The two Bishops of South Dakota in a recent letter shared the concern of a growing number of faithful Catholics who fear the Vatican document Fiducia Supplicans may normalize “serious sin.” In the [unified December 22 statement](https://www.sfcatholic.org/bishop-degrood/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2023/12/Joint-Letter-of-Fiducia-Supplicans.pdf), Bishops Peter M. Muhich of Rapid City and Donald E. DeGrood of Sioux Falls reminded Catholics that “the ministers of the Church have no power to bless sin.” “[We] have received a number of inquiries from the faithful concerning Fiducia Supplicans, a Vatican document published Monday on the topic of blessings,” the bishops’ letter stated. They wrote that “controversy has followed publication of this document, as some have hailed a supposed novel change in the Church’s perennial teaching on sexuality, or praised it as a ‘step’ towards such a change.” “These pronouncements, even celebrations of a particular interpretation, have been heard both within and outside the Church,” they wrote. “It is important to understand that the document itself makes explicit that the Church’s teaching on marriage and human sexuality is unchanged. Nor can it change.” Reminding the faithful of South Dakota that “the moral law is the pathway to freedom and happiness,” the bishops noted “some have further expressed concern that, as a practical matter, Fiducia Supplicans will have the impact of normalizing serious sin. Indeed it is troubling that some, even in the Church, may seek to use it for this purpose.” They continued, Any misappropriation of the teaching office of the Church in a way that normalizes sin contributes to leading people further from Jesus’ loving heart rather than closer to it, and must be repudiated. Thus we must have a clear understanding of what the Church teaches, even while the virtue of prudence helps us to know when and how to admonish sin in practice. “There should be no ambiguity as regards this truth: the ministers of the Church have no power to bless sin. To do so would be a perversion of the very purpose of a blessing,” the bishops continued, insisting that “any sort of blessing that would give the semblance of condoning sin is not to be granted.” “Repentance opens the person to the possibility of forgiveness, reconciliation, healing, new life, and flourishing, which God desires for every person,” the letter explained. “In this way, persons desiring prayers of blessing are met with the generosity of the Church as a loving mother, who seeks to draw all souls to the nearness of the Father.” “Let us turn to the Lord and seek his peace in these days by living in the fullness of his revealed truths in the Deposit of Faith,” the bishops concluded.",

El hallazgo, publicado por investigadores de la Universidad de Saitama, demuestra la forma en que se perciben los ecosistemas vegetales y subraya la complejidad de las interacciones biológicas.\nLa investigación, liderada por el biológo molecular Masatsugu Toyota, reveló que las plantas utilizan redes de comunicación vegetal basadas en señales químicas y físicas para enviar mensajes de alerta. Este descubrimiento ofrece nuevas perspectivas para la ecología química y la defensa contra plagas en cultivos, abriendo oportunidades para estudios futuros en biología vegetal avanzada.\nPUEDES VER:\n[Científicos descubren que una de las especies más antiguas de la Tierra puede evolucionar 'hacia atrás']\n¿Cómo se comunican las plantas?\nLas plantas emplean un lenguaje invisible basado en compuestos químicos volátiles y cambios físicos para interactuar entre sí. Cuando una planta enfrenta un ataque de plagas o está sometida a estrés ambiental, libera moléculas que pueden ser detectadas por sus vecinas. Estas señales químicas en plantas activan mecanismos de defensa en especies cercanas, permitiéndoles prepararse ante amenazas inminentes.\nEl video muestra como las plantas realizan procesos químicos para comunicarse ante la amenaza de una oruga. Foto: Nature\nAdemás, estudios recientes destacan el uso de señales físicas, como vibraciones y modificaciones en la luz reflejada, para facilitar la comunicación entre plantas. Esta interacción biológica compleja redefine nuestra comprensión sobre los ecosistemas vegetales y su capacidad de supervivencia colectiva.\nPUEDES VER:\n[Científicos revelan que los gatos son más inteligentes que los humanos: son capaces de identificar palabras]\n¿Cómo fue el experimento entre ambas plantas?\nEl equipo de Toyota llevó a cabo un experimento pionero utilizando plantas de tomate y maleza. Emplearon un sistema de bombas para transferir compuestos liberados por plantas dañadas hacia otras sanas. Para monitorear las respuestas, utilizaron biosensores fluorescentes que emitían luz verde al detectar cambios en los niveles de calcio celular.\nDurante el estudio, las plantas intactas reaccionaron de inmediato al recibir las advertencias aéreas. Sus hojas mostraron ráfagas de señales de calcio, indicando una activación en sus sistemas de defensa. Esta respuesta confirmó la existencia de redes de comunicación vegetal altamente sofisticadas.\n“Finalmente, hemos desvelado la intrincada historia de cómo las plantas responden a los mensajes de advertencia de sus vecinos amenazados”, declaró Toyota en una entrevista. Este hallazgo impulsa la investigación en botánica y plantea nuevas estrategias para proteger cultivos contra plagas y condiciones adversas.",
