    "text": "CARTHAGE — To chase away the winter blues and to bring a little sunshine, the 20th annual winter gala to benefit Augustinian Academy — “Hula in the Snow: A Winter Luau” — was held Feb. 10.\nTalitha Workman, a member of the event planning committee, said 155 tickets were sold for the gala, which is one of the school’s most significant fundraisers with all funds going directly back to support the students of the school.\n“People enjoyed the tropical theme, wearing bright colors and even flip flops, an attempt to beat the winter blues,” she said. “The meal was an all tropical flare with Hawaiian meats, grilled pineapple, SPAM and rice. We had tropical cocktails too at our tiki bar. The Patti Stanford Band all dressed in tropical attire and their first set of music was all brand new music they put together especially for our event — tropical country. They kicked off the entertainment portion of our evening with ‘Margaritaville,’ for which the Augustinian Academy staff had learned a line dance for.”\nDuring the gala, former school principal Sister Annunciata Collins was honored for her 55 years of service to religious life and more than 20 years of service to Augustinian Academy. Current principal Sister Suanne Johnson, Sister of St. Joseph, and previous principal Mary Ann Margrey shared some stories and words to the attendees about Sister Aunnunciata and then she was given a fresh flower lei in the school colors.\nIn addition the members of the Knights of Columbus Father John Cosmic Council No. 291 were recognized for their service to Augustinian Academy and St. James church.\n“We wish to pay homage to a remarkable group of men within our church whose unwavering commitment to giving mirrors the timeless legacy of King Kamehameha of Hawaii,” said Mrs. Workman. “In the spirit of King Kamehameha, who united the Hawaiian Islands through wisdom, strength and a deep love for his people we recognize these dedicated individuals standing before you. They exemplified the true essence of benevolence within our church community. Their acts of kindness, compassion, and selfless giving mirror the same spirit that King Kamehameha displayed in leading his people to prosperity and unity. Much like the king who prioritized the well-being of his subjects, these men of the church have dedicated their time, talents, and resources to uplift the lives of those around them.”\nMrs. Workman pointed out the many deeds both physically and financially the Knight have done for the school and church including renovation projects, fundraising, the purchase of equipment and aiding with the St. James Fair.\nThe Knights were each presented with a symbolic crown lapel pin.\nAwards were presented for best dressed in the theme and other fun categories.\nGarry Stevens won the “Cheeseburger in Paradise” award for Most-Laid Back and Carefree Spirit. He was awarded a platter of cheeseburgers\nJim and Lucie Cassoni were awarded “Hula Hotties” for best dressed couple and won a Hawaiian dashboard Hula dancer.\nDebbie Kepler won the “Golden Pineapple” award for spending the most money at the silent auction. She was awarded a solid gold pineapple — a fresh pineapple spray painted gold.\nMrs. Workman expressed thanks to the donors of the larger raffle prizes provided by Aubuchon Hardware, providing a grill, and Cross-Tracks Archery, providing a crossbow. In addition, she also expressed thanks to the major sponsors — Carthage Area Hospital, Robert Sligar with CrossCountry Mortgage, The Sisters of St. Joseph, Fuller Insurance Agency, The Knights of Columbus Father John Cosmic Council No. 291 and Iseneker Funeral Home.\n“Many other area businesses supported our silent auction with items and gift certificates and donated to our gala through sponsorships,” she pointed out.\nJohnson Newspapers 7.1",

    "text": "Source: NDTV News | Title: Netanyahu Says At Least 13,000 \\”Terrorists\\” Among Palestinians Killed\n<!–\n–> “We are very close to victory,” said Netanyahu (File)\nIsrael’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has told a German newspaper that at least 13,000 “terrorists” were among Palestinians killed during Israel’s air and ground assault on Gaza.\nFive months into Israel’s campaign following the October 7 Hamas-led attack on southern Israel, Palestinian health authorities say nearly 31,000 Palestinians have been killed.\nThe Gaza health ministry does not break down the death count between civilians and Hamas operatives but has said that 72% of those killed were women and children. Hamas dismisses Israeli figures for militants killed as attempts to portray “fake victories”.\nIn an interview with Germany’s Bild newspaper, Netanyahu was quoted as saying that an extension of Israel’s offensive into Rafah in southern Gaza was key to defeating Hamas.\n“We are very close to victory … Once we begin military action against the remaining terror battalions in Rafah, it is only a question of weeks” until the intensive phase of fighting is concluded, he said.\nThree quarters of Hamas battalions had been destroyed and halting the offensive now would only allow them to regroup, Bild quoted Netanyahu as saying.\nBild made excerpts of the interview, which was jointly held with Politico and German broadcaster Welt TV, available to Reuters on Sunday.\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)\nRead More | Source: NDTV News",
