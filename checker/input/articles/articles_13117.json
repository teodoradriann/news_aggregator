    "text": "The Chief of Defence Forces Francis Ogolla died on Thursday afternoon in a tragic helicopter crash which also killed nine other senior military officers in the Sindar area in Elgeyo Marakwet County.\nPresident William Ruto announced Ogolla’s demise as he mourned him as a “distinguished four-star General.”\nNational and world leaders have since joined in and sent their heart-felt messages of condolence to the family of the late General.\nOpposition leader Raila Odinga, in his message, sympathized with families of the slain officers, terming Ogolla as a true patriot and a consummate professional in his dedication of service to the country.\n “A terrible day for Kenya: My wife Ida and I are deeply saddened and profoundly shocked by the passing of General. Francis Ogolla, the Chief of Defence Forces. We join the nation in mourning his loss. Gen. Ogolla was a true patriot, a highly decorated soldier, and a consummate professional who served our country with unwavering dedication,” Mr. Odinga said.\n“Our hearts go out to his family, his colleagues in the KDF, and the entire nation as we grieve this immense loss. We also extend our very heartfelt condolences to the families of the KDF team who were accompanying Gen. Ogolla. We know that at this moment words will not be enough to console your tremendous grief. We pray the Lord may give you comfort. May the souls of all those who have departed find eternal peace.”\nChief Justice Martha Koome, who on her part said Ogolla was a close friend and fellow church member, remembered him as a selfless and humble leader whose service had been marked with patriotism.\n“I have known Gen Ogolla and his family for over 30 years. A fellow member of the Methodist Church where he and family worshiped. His commitment to duty and selfless service to our country exemplified the highest ideals of leadership,” she said.\n“His earned and decorated career, marked by exceptional humility and adherence to the ethos of patriotism and nationhood inspired all to excel in service to the public. Today, we mourn a dear friend whose firm, yet endearing spirit of family exemplified the values of justice and human dignity.”\nNational Assembly Speaker Moses Wetangula said the deceased had left behind a legacy of distinguished service to the nation.\n“I stand with reverence together with the nation and our disciplined forces, grieving the tragic loss of Gen. Francis .O. Ogolla, the Chief of the Defence Forces, whose untimely demise in a helicopter crash while on duty in Elgeyo Marakwet County weighs heavily upon our hearts,” Wetangula noted.\n“In this sombre moment, my deepest condolences go out to the grieving families of his fellow officers. May the bereaved find solace in knowing that he died while steadfastly serving his country with honour and defending the cause of peace.”\nInterior Cabinet Secretary Kithure Kindiki eulogised General Ogolla and the nine other deceased military personnel as courageous patriots that the country is now a little poorer without.\n“I had the previlege of working closely with General Ogolla during the past 18 months, and I ocassionally flew with his late pilot on my journeys to Northern Kenya and the Boni Enclave. General Ogolla and his nine colleagues have lost their lives in the service of our Country,” he stated.\nTanzanian President Samia Suluhu led global leaders in mourning the departed CDF, as she also sent her condolence message to President Ruto and Kenyans in general.\n“Nimepokea kwa masikitiko makubwa taarifa ya kifo cha Mkuu wa Majeshi ya Ulinzi ya Jamhuri ya Kenya, Jenerali Francis Omondi Ogolla na wanajeshi wengine tisa katika ajali ya helikopta iliyotokea leo katika Kaunti ya Elgeyo-Marakwet,” she wrote.\n“Natuma salamu za pole kwa Rais na Amiri Jeshi Mkuu wa Majeshi ya Ulinzi ya Kenya, Mheshimiwa @WilliamsRuto, wananchi wote wa Kenya, familia, ndugu, jamaa na marafiki wa wote waliopoteza jamaa zao katika katika ajali hiyo. Poleni sana. Mwenyezi Mungu azilaze roho za ndugu zetu hawa mahali pema peponi. Amina.”\nUnited States Ambassador to Kenya Meg Whitman remembered Ogolla as a man of integrity and dedication who has helped strengthen ties between Kenya and US in his line of work.\n“I had the honour of working with General Ogolla and had great respect for his integrity and dedication to the Kenyan people. He was a great friend of the United States and helped advance the U.S.-Kenya partnership,” Whitman wrote.\nUK Commissioner to Kenya Neil Wigan extended his consolation to the families of the deceased military personnel, terming Ogolla as a close friend to the UK.\n“Sending our deepest condolences to the loved ones of all those who lost their lives in today’s military helicopter crash. CDF General Francis Ogolla was a close friend of the UK and will be deeply missed,” Wigan wrote.\nOther Kenyan leaders who also expressed their solace for the passing of Ogolla included ICT Cabinet Secretary Eliud Owallo, MPs Otiende Amollo (Rarieda), Babu Owino (Embakasi East) among others.\n\"It is with profound shock and deep sadness that I have learnt of the passing of General Francis Omondi Ogolla, Chief of the Defence Forces, in a tragic helicopter crash today,\" Owalo said.\n\"The crash took the lives of other armed officers and I wish to extend condolences to their families, loved ones and the entire armed forces. General Ogolla was a distinguished officer who served this country with unwavering dedication and excellence.\"\nTags: KDF Raila Odinga Citizen TV Citizen Digital Francis Ogolla Want to send us a story?

    "title": "Canetada de Tarcísio sobre FIM de uma era nas linhas 2 e 3 em metrô de SP atinge milhares de paulistas",
    "text": "O metrô é um dos principais meios de transportes, principalmente em São Paulo, onde conta com o maior número de linhas, sendo o sistema mais extenso do país Canetada do Governador de São Paulo, Tarcísio de Freitas crava sobre o fim de uma era nas linhas 2 e 3 em metrô da capital paulista, onde atinge milhares de passageiros.\nO metrô de São Paulo tem seis linhas e 91 estações, cobrindo mais de 100 km de trilhos. Para quem não sabe, ele é o mais antigo do Brasil, com início de operação em 1974.\nDe acordo com informações da Rádio Tupi, o metrô de São Paulo é o mais utilizado, com mais de 5 milhões de passageiros diariamente.\nDesse modo, milhares de passageiros buscam esse meio de transporte pela praticidade e agilidade. Afinal, através do metrô não é preciso se preocupar com o trânsito.\nOcorre que o Governo de São Paulo deu sinais de que não compartilha do otimismo inicial de quando Tarcísio de Freitas assumiu suas funções.\nIsso porque ele havia prometido conceder toda a malha ferroviária de São Paulo nos próximos anos.\nA partir de informações da Revista Veja e de apurações feitas pela equipe especializada do TV Foco em transportes públicos, detalha agora as novidades do metrô de SP.\nFIM DE UMA ERA NO METRÔ? De acordo com a fonte, as concessões das linhas 2-Verde e 3-Vermelha do metrô deverão ficar para o próximo mandato, a partir de 2027.\nA explicação de Tarcísio é sensata: falta tempo para finalizar o processo em cerca de dois anos antes de colocá-las em leilão neste mandato.\nO objetivo será oferecer ao mercado as linhas 1-Azul e 20-Rosa em um combo, como já tinha sido revelado anteriormente.\nNesse modelo, que está sendo analisado, o ramal mais antigo do metrô servirá como “chamariz” para as empresas privadas já que significa na prática conseguir receita com a operação imediata.\nEm paralelo, a empresa ganhadora tocará os projetos e estudos para tirar do papel a Linha 20 , que ligará Santa Marina à Santo André.\nMetrô da Linha 3-Vermelha (Foto: Reprodução / Jean Carlos) ‘MENINA DOS OLHOS’ DE TARCÍSIO DE FEITAS? Oficialmente, a Secretaria de Parcerias em Investimentos (SPI) determina que o leilão não apenas da Linha 20 mas também da Linha 19-Celeste (Guarulhos-centro de SP) acontecerá no final desse ano.\nPortanto, com assinatura de contratos no 2º trimestre de 2026. O intuito é que os dois ramais já estão finalizados, para consequentemente ocorrer audiências públicas e publicação do edital.\nApesar de adiantada, a Linha 19 pode ser superada pela Linha 20 nas prioridades da gestão de Tarcísio .\nAfinal, o governador considera o ramal Rosa como uma questão de honra, principalmente no trecho que atenderá o ABC Paulista.\nTrata-se de uma região que ainda não possui grandes avanços de mobilidade urbana, visto que seus munícipios dependem apenas da Linha 10-Turquesa , da CPTM .\nSão Bernardo do Campo , por exemplo, que é o mais populoso deles, não tem nem essa proeza.\nSendo assim, o município depende apenas de ônibus submetidos por um grupo privado da redondeza.\nConcessão das linhas 1-Azul e 20-Rosa (Foto: Reprodução / Jean Carlos) CONSIDERAÇÕES FINAIS Primeiramente, as concessões das linhas 2-Verde e 3-Vermelha para a iniciativa privada devem ficar para a próxima gestão. Afinal, fontes do Governo Tarcísio de Freitas afirmaram que complexidade dos projetos torna leilões difíceis de serem realizados até 2026. Tarcísio de Freitas e estação de metrô em SP (Foto: Reprodução / Canva / Montagem TV Foco) AFINAL, QUAL O PREÇO DA PASSAGEM DE METRÔ EM SP? De acordo com informações do G1, desde o dia 06 de janeiro deste ano, a tarifa do metrô em São Paulo é R$ 5,20. Se aplicando também as concessões privadas.\nPorém, quem tiver carregado o Bilhete Único até o domingo (5/01) seguira pagando o valor antigo das tarifas por até 180 dias.\n“Desse modo, veja matéria completa sobre nova linha de metrô anunciada em 2025 para salvar milhões de trabalhadores em SP”.",

    "text": "Read full article The Guardian Four-year-old survives 22 hours in California wilderness after walking away from campsite Gloria Oladipo June 24, 2024 at 5:09 PM · 2 min read Link Copied Search and rescue teams found Christian Ramirez safe after he wandered away from a campsite in Lakeshore, California. Photograph: Tulare County Sheriff's Office\nA four-year-old boy survived nearly an entire day alone in the wilderness after he wandered away from his family while they were at a campsite in central California .\nChristian Ramirez of Torrance, California, was camping with his family at the Rancheria campground in Lakeshore, about 70 miles outside of Fresno, when his ordeal began, KTLA reported .\nRamirez became separated from his family Thursday at about 10am local time. His relatives searched the boy for an hour but were unable to find him, so they called rescue crews, who then launched a frantic search for Ramirez.\nWith much of the US in the grips of extreme heat recently, Thursday’s high in Lakeshore was 79F (26.1C) – and the low was 40F (4.4C).\nA crew of more than 50 volunteers and officers searched for Ramirez for hours, using dogs, an aerial search, and other methods, the California news outlet ABC7 Eyewitness News reported .\nRamirez was then in a wooded area about a quarter-mile from the campsite when, fortunately for him, his family and the search crews, members of the Tulare county search and rescue team found him at about 8am on Friday.\nAuthorities say Ramirez was hungry and tired when rescuers found him after he had been missing for roughly 22 hours. But he was in good health, according to officials.\nThe four-year-old was only wearing a T-shirt and shorts when he dealt with the overnight low temperatures in the 40s. The forest area is also home to dangerous animals, including bears and snakes.\n“There’s a lot of things that could have gone really, really wrong with this one, and we got lucky – the family got lucky,” Brandon Pursell of the Fresno county sheriff’s office said to ABC7. “The boy is very, very fortunate to be with his family.”\nUpon finding Ramirez, rescuers gave the boy a sandwich and quickly reunited him with his parents.\nRamirez’s successful rescue came only a day after a man was rescued after being lost in the California mountains for more than a week.\nLukas McClish, 34, of Boulder Creek, California , sustained himself on creek water and wild berries after he became lost on a hike on 11 June.\nMcClish – who had planned to hike for only a few hours when he became lost – wasn’t found until 20 June after people heard his screams for help.\n“I felt comfortable the whole time I was out there – I wasn’t worried,” McClish told KSBW in an interview published Sunday. “I think it was just somebody watching over me.”\nView comments",
