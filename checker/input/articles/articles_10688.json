Las protestas contra la nueva política migratoria de la Administración Trump se extienden por hasta 13 estados EEUU anuncia el despliegue de 700 marines en Los Ángeles - Foto: Europa Press/Contacto/Amy Katz El Mando Norte de Estados Unidos ha anunciado este miércoles que desplegará en las próximas 48 horas a 700 marines en Los Ángeles tras haber completado su entrenamiento, en el marco de una nueva escalada de las protestas iniciadas en el pasado viernes en la ciudad californiana y que se han extendido a múltiples ciudades de hasta trece estados de Estados Unidos en contra de las deportaciones y redadas del Servicio de Control de Inmigración y Aduanas (ICE) contra la migración irregular.Los marines se unirán de esta forma a la Policía de Los Ángeles y a más de 4.000 soldados de la Guardia Nacional, 2.100 de ellos ya desplegados y la otra mitad movilizada para el jueves, según ha explicado el general Scott Sherman, que encabeza la operación.De todas formas, \"el papel aún no está claro\" para ninguno de los tres cuerpos de seguridad desplegados, ha declarado a CNN el jefe del Departamento de Policía de Los Ángeles, Jim McDonnell, que ha destacado que \"esto no tiene precedentes\".En la ciudad angelina, las protestas han continuado por sexto día consecutivo aun a pesar del toque de queda, que ha comenzado a las 20.00 (hora local) y tras el que la CNN ha informado de entre 20 y 30 detenciones, además de disparos con pelotas de goma y Policía montada para dispersar a los manifestantes.Además, el gobernador de California, Gavin Newsom, ha denunciado en la red social X que un \"incendio de Ranch, en San Bernardino, (a menos de 100 km de Los Ángeles) abarca 4.000 acres (1.619 hectáreas) y sigue creciendo. Mientras tanto, cinco de los 14 equipos de bomberos de la Guardia Nacional de California tienen poco personal porque Trump los desplegó para un acto político en Los Ángeles\". \"Esto no sólo es ilegal. Es peligroso\", ha añadido.Paralelamente, las protestas se han extendido a múltiples ciudades de hasta 13 estados del país y en Washington D.C. En Spokane, estado de Washington, se ha declarado el estado de emergencia y un toque de queda y se han realizado más de 30 arrestos.También han sido escenario de intensas protestas ciudades como Nueva York, Las Vegas o Indiana, donde la multitud ha rodeado el estadio de los Indiana Pacers de la NBA en el marco del tercer partido de las finales en las que se enfrentan a los Oklahoma City Thunder. , , , , , , , , , , , ,",

    "text": "Today’s consumers are actively becoming more conscious of the ingredients used in personal care products. As they seek safer alternatives, consumers likewise try to avoid harmful chemicals. Despite this, delivering effective results remains one of the driving factors for purchases.\nNittany Valley Organics positioned itself at the center of this growing trend by offering a wide range of personal care products made with organic ingredients. The company aims to build transparency and safety for the health-conscious consumer. Founded by Tony & Dee Musso, Nittany Valley Organics offers skin, hair, and body care solutions that users can trust.\nThe Birth of Nittany Valley Organics\nThe story behind Nittany Valley Organics is deeply personal. Tony Musso, one of the founders, struggled with a severe skin condition that caused persistent itching, dryness, and even bleeding. His search for a remedy led to disappointment with chemical-laden products on the market, which failed to provide relief. This experience inspired his wife, Dee, to create an organic lavender lotion. The lotion worked overnight, easing Tony’s symptoms and providing the much-needed comfort his skin deserved.\nWhat began as a personal journey soon evolved into a business. Friends and family members saw Tony’s remarkable improvement and started requesting their lotions. This sparked the idea for a brand built around natural and organic care. From this humble beginning, Nittany Valley Organics has grown into a successful company offering over 100 organic skin, hair, and body care products.\nOrganic Ingredients You Can Trust\nOne key reason behind Nittany Valley Organics’ popularity is its commitment to transparency. Unlike many personal care brands, Nittany Valley Organics avoids harmful chemicals and synthetic additives. Every product is made with organic ingredients. This means customers know exactly what they are putting on their bodies. This focus on natural and safe ingredients has resonated with many concerned consumers about the long-term effects of exposure to the usual chemicals commonly placed in their personal care products.\nWhether the consumer is looking for a gentle moisturizer, a chemical-free shampoo, or a soothing body wash, Nittany Valley Organics has something for everyone. The brand is famous for its organic lavender lotion, which remains one of its top sellers due to its soothing properties. With a focus on natural, plant-based ingredients, Nittany Valley Organics continues to provide products that work effectively and are safe for both the skin and the environment.\nWhy Go Organic with Your Personal Care?\nChoosing organic personal care products has several advantages. First, it helps reduce the risk of skin irritations and allergic reactions. Many conventional products contain parabens, sulfates, and synthetic fragrances, which disrupt the skin’s natural balance and lead to dryness or irritation. On the other hand, Nittany Valley Organics avoids all harmful chemicals, ensuring that its products are gentle yet effective.\nAnother reason to opt for organic products is the environmental benefit. Products made with organic ingredients tend to have a smaller carbon footprint and are also less harmful to the planet. Nittany Valley Organics takes this commitment seriously by using sustainable practices and eco-friendly packaging whenever possible. It provides a trusted solution for individuals who want to make conscious choices for their health and the environment.\nA Growing Range of Products\nNittany Valley Organics has come a long way since its early days. The company offers an extensive range of personal care items, including facial serums, body scrubs, hair treatments, and more. Each product is meticulously crafted to deliver the desired results without compromising quality or safety.\nThe brand’s growth can be attributed to its dedication to customer feedback. Nittany Valley Organics constantly listens to its users and tailors its offerings based on their needs. As Tony Musso puts it, “Nittany Valley Organics is committed to providing personal care products you can trust, made with organic ingredients and no harmful chemicals.” This focus on customer satisfaction has earned the company a loyal following of individuals who rely on their products for daily care routines.\nA Continuous Commitment to Wellness\nNittany Valley Organics is more than just a personal care brand. It represents a commitment to wellness, both inside and out. By prioritizing natural ingredients and avoiding harmful chemicals, the brand offers peace of mind to its customers. With over 100 products, there’s something for everyone, whether addressing a specific skin issue or simply looking for safe, organic options for your daily routine.\nNittany Valley Organics’ dedication to quality and transparency has set it apart in a crowded marketplace. With a story rooted in personal experience and a product line that continues to evolve, Nittany Valley Organics is poised to remain a trusted name in the organic personal care industry through the coming years.\nFor more information about Nittany Valley Organics, visit their website, Facebook, and Instagram accounts.\nPublished by: Khy Talara",
