    "title": "BUA to maintain N3,500 cement price from January 2024 – Abdul-Samad Rabiu",
    "text": "Abdul-Samad Rabiu, the BUA Group Chairman, affirmed the company’s commitment to selling cement at the rate of N3,500, starting January 2024. He said this while speaking with State House Correspondents after a visit to President Bola Tinubu on Thursday in Lagos. Also, he assured that the company is committed to making the product accessible and affordable for customers despite encountering several challenges. - “You know the price that we have set will be N3,500 per bag. You know x factory of course plus VAT and then delivered to customers depending on the region. - “As you know, the factory that we have; is in Edo, and the other one is in Sokoto state. So for example, if you want us to deliver cement to you from Sokoto say to Lagos from Adamawa or to Maiduguri, the distance is quite far. - “So dependent on the distance and dependent on the location. You know the price changes but we intend to keep that promise,” he said. Rabiu also mentioned that the cement company site in Sokoto, set to be inaugurated in January 2024, is anticipated to broaden the market nationwide. - “And as we all know, the volumes that we will be having will be about six million tonnes per annum combined. And we expect those volumes to have an impact. - “Though we’re having some issues here and there, these are issues that I believe we can address and we are addressing them,” he outlined. What you should know - Earlier in September, the chairman of Bua Cement Plc, Abdul Samad Rabiu, [announced](https://nairametrics.com/2023/09/15/bua-cement-to-bring-down-cement-price-from-n5500-to-m3500-per-bag/)plans to reduce the price of cement in Nigeria from the present N5,500 to between N3,000 to N3,500. - He said this is part of its contribution to supporting the efforts of the Federal Government to bring down the prices of key commodities in the country, adding that this will enable the company to bring down the price of cement to about N3,500 per bag. - Meanwhile, a [survey](https://nairametrics.com/2023/10/11/bua-cement-still-sells-between-n5300-and-n5500-despite-price-cut/)done by Nairametrics showed that the price of cement is still sold at the initial price between N5,300 to N5,500 in some places across the country. - Responding to the development, Rabiu noted that the company still maintained its promise to sell at the announced price, adding that other external challenges have contributed to the delay in price slash.",

    "text": "RESTON, Va. (7News) — Life is unpredictable - but one Northern Virginia couple found out that unexpected events can lead to the best memories. Nearly a month before his due date, Kahil and Keiko Britt’s son was struggling to grow. “When I went to see my doctor, I found out that he needed to be delivered as soon as possible,” Keiko told 7News Health and Wellness Reporter Victoria Sanchez. “He came out so little. He was 4lbs. 1oz. I was very scared,” said Kahil. After six days in the Reston Hospital Center’s neonatal intensive care unit, little Kwame was able to his family's South Riding, Virginia home. Kwame’s parents started dating in 2019 - Keiko is from Atlanta and has a son from a previous relationship, she was clear early on with Kahil when their long-distance relationship started. “She don’t really want to do the dating thing, and for me to be in the mindset that if we’re going to be in this relationship, it’s going to be about marriage,” Kahil explained. Soon after their 2022 engagement, the couple found out they were expecting and scheduled the wedding before the baby’s arrival. “And we were just going to do a court wedding,” said Keiko. But the emergency induction scrapped the ceremony. “I approached my manager and said, ‘We need to do something for them,’” said Reston Hospital Center Registered Nurse Danielle Viates. Viates knew the couple wanted to be married as soon as possible. “Basically, my RN was my wedding planner,” Keiko said with a smile. With help from other nurses and staff, a cake, flowers, and sparkling cider were delivered and the hospital chaplain called in. “Everybody was just so excited. Everybody was so excited to be part of that moment,” said Kahil. Just hours before their son was born, the couple exchanged vows and said “I do.” What a story to tell little Kwame and big brother MJ. One wedding and a birthday all wrapped up into one. “Truly show my sons, how it is for a man to love a woman and to have a wonderful relationship and bond. I’m just trying to teach my sons right,” Kahil told Sanchez. “That’s why we decided to have our wedding at Reston Hospital,” added Keiko.",

A separate 911 caller reported hearing a baby crying in the background, suggesting potential injuries. Paramedics were dispatched to the scene to assess the situation and provide medical care. However, the severity of injuries and the cause of the crash remain unclear at this time.\nAuthorities are actively investigating the collision. Anyone with information is encouraged to contact law enforcement. Our thoughts are with those affected, and we hope for a full recovery.\nCar Accidents Involving Children in California Car accidents involving young children are especially concerning due to their vulnerability to serious injuries. Properly secured car seats can reduce the risk of harm, but collisions that trigger airbag deployment can still result in significant trauma.\nCalifornia sees thousands of vehicle crashes each year, many of which involve families and young passengers. In accidents like this, victims may face medical expenses, emotional distress, and long recovery periods. Understanding available support options can be crucial in navigating the aftermath.\nIf you or a loved one has been injured in a car accident, seeking professional assistance can help manage the legal and financial challenges that often follow a serious collision.\nLocal Accident Reports is committed to providing timely updates and connecting victims with the support they need.

    "text": "TEGUCIGALPA, HONDURAS.- Debido al ingreso de un frente frío y una vaguada al territorio hondureño que dejará fuertes lluvias y bajas temperaturas, la [Secretaría de Gestión de Riesgos y Contigencias Nacionales (Copeco)](https://twitter.com/CopecoHonduras1/status/1740455347377328264) emitió esta tarde alerta verde en siete departamentos del país. Y nuevamente sería la zona norte de Honduras la más afectada. Los departamentos declarados en alerta son: Islas de la Bahía, Santa Bárbara, Yoro, Atlántida, Cortés, Colón y Gracias a Dios. Estas alertas fueron emitidas por un período de 72 horas a partir de hoy jueves desde las 12 del mediodía. Según explicó Copeco, las fuertes lluvias que comenzaron ayer provocaría “posibles inundaciones urbanas y desbordamientos de los ríos que nacen en las sierras de Omoa, Merendón, Mico Quemado, Nombre de Dios, La Esperanza y Sico, así como alto oleaje en la costa norte del país”. Los mayores acumulados se registrarían en las montañas del norte y noroccidente con acumulados de hasta 200 a 250 milímetros (mm) diarios los días viernes y sábado y se advierte de vientos racheados que podrían alcanzar los 60 kilómetros por hora sobre las planicies del sur. Este es el sexto frente frío de la temporada 2023-2024 y aún quedan en proyecciones al menos 8 de estos fenómenos climatológicos. Los frentes fríos anteriores dejaron grandes disturbios y muertes en la zona norte de Honduras. Periodista digital desde 2021, con recorrido en periodismo de datos, profundidad y de investigación.

    "text": "The Brief The City Council passed a resolution urging HR to block the hiring of applicants convicted in the Jan. 6 Capitol attack. The measure passed 43-3 and applies regardless of pardon or clemency status. Alderman Gilbert Villegas led the effort, citing the importance of defending democracy. CHICAGO - Chicago is now the first major U.S. city to adopt a policy aimed at keeping Jan. 6 offenders out of city government jobs.\nWhat we know:\nOn Wednesday afternoon, the Chicago City Council passed a resolution calling on the city’s Human Resources Commissioner to use discretion in rejecting job applicants who were convicted of crimes tied to the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. The measure passed by a wide margin—43 yeas to 3 nays.\nYea-Nay votes on Chicago Jan. 6 hiring resolution | Provided\nThe resolution, R2025-0015310, applies regardless of whether an applicant has received clemency or a pardon and takes effect immediately.\n\"You should not be allowed to work for the same government you are attempting to overthrow,\" said Alderman Gilbert Villegas, the resolution’s chief sponsor. \"There is a misalignment in values there.\"\nThe measure comes after the State of Illinois identified 53 residents involved in the Jan. 6 attack, including several from Chicago. At least one was found to be employed by the city as a police officer.\nFILE - US President Donald Trumps supporters gather outside the Capitol building in Washington D.C., United States on Jan. 06, 2021. (Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)\nThe backstory:\nVillegas, a veteran of the United States Marine Corps, said the Capitol riot shook his sense of duty and drew a rare comparison in his life.\n\"There’s only been two times that I’ve thought about putting my uniform on and reactivating—September 11th and January 6th—because this democracy is worth fighting for,\" he said during council remarks.\nHe was joined by Aldermen Chris Taliaferro, Bill Conway, and Matt Martin in sponsoring the measure.\nWhat's next:\nWhile the resolution is not a formal ordinance, it strongly signals the City Council’s stance and gives the Commissioner of Human Resources broad backing to apply the new hiring standard going forward.\nThe resolution takes effect immediately.\nThe Source: The information in this article was provided by the Office of Alderman Gilbert Villegas.",

    "text": "NEW DELHI: A church priest in Florida is facing allegations of biting a woman during Communion at a Mass in St. Cloud, purportedly in an attempt to \\\"defend the Communion bread,\\\" according to the charging affidavit quoted by CNN. The priest, Father Fidel Rodriguez, initially refused to give the woman Communion on May 19, stating she had not completed the necessary steps to receive it when they met earlier that day at St. Thomas Aquinas Catholic Church, as per police records.The Diocese of Orlando’s statement notes Rodriguez gave the woman a blessing at the 10am. The woman reportedly came back for the noon Mass, claiming she had fulfilled the required steps and “is now accepted by God, thus, granting her the ability to participate in communion,”.The priest reportedly asked the woman if she had been to the Sacrament of Penance (Confession), to which she replied saying, \\\"it was not his business.” During a police interview, Rodriguez in his defense claimed the woman pushed him and refused to let go of the communion tray, leading him to bite her arm.“In the Catholic Tradition, the Eucharist is considered ‘the source and summit’ of worship and faith. The act of participation in Holy Communion therefore calls for a proper understanding, reverence, and devotion,” the statement from the Diocese reads.“It is not something a person can arbitrarily demand and is certainly not a mere ‘cookie’ as the complainant called it,” the statement adds.The Diocese emphasized that in Catholic tradition, the Eucharist is a central element of worship and faith, requiring proper understanding and reverence, not something to be demanded or treated as a mere \\\"cookie.\\\"The woman declined medical attention, and police documented the bite mark.St. Cloud Police have forwarded the case to the State Attorney’s Office for review. The Ninth Judicial Circuit State Attorney’s Office confirmed the case is under review to determine the appropriate action.",

Backup quarterback Jarrett Stidham will start the team’s final two games of the season beginning this Sunday at home against the Los Angeles Chargers.\nWhen asked about the move away from Wilson, who Denver traded for two offseasons ago and signed to a five-year, $245 million extension, coach Sean Payton gave a puzzling answer.\n“We’re desperately trying to win,” Payton told reporters on Wednesday afternoon. “Sure, in our game today, there are economics and all those other things, but the number one push behind this…and it’s a decision I’m making…is to get a spark offensively. …If I didn’t feel like [Stidham] gave us a chance to win, I wouldn’t be making that move.”\n— Nick Ferguson (@NickFerguson_25)\n[#Broncos]Head Coach Sean Payton on benching [#RussellWilson]and why he made the move [pic.twitter.com/3GhqUBqYvu] [December 27, 2023]\nWilson was 11-19 across 30 games as Denver’s starter, and now where he heads next once the team moves on from him in the off-season\nis anybody’s guess.\nAs for the Broncos, they’ll try to win the final two games of the regular season to keep their outside shot at a postseason appearance alive.\n[Sign up for our e-News Alerts](/users/newsletters-dc/)\nSUBMIT FEEDBACK\nClick Below to:",
