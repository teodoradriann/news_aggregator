    "text": "[Skip to main content](#main) RCMP 'won't be able to talk to' bus driver in deadly Carberry crash As the first anniversary of the Carberry crash approaches, Manitoba RCMP provided an update on the investigation and how the first responders are doing a year later. On June 15, 2023, a bus with 25 people on board left Dauphin to visit a casino near Carberry when it was struck by a semi at the intersection of Highway 5 and the Trans-Canada Highway. Seventeen people died as a result of the crash. Speaking to media Thursday, Supt. Rob Lasson spoke about one of the first times he addressed the public following the tragedy, and how he promised the RCMP would provide thorough and accurate answers regarding the incident. \"I am now confident that we have gathered the appropriate evidence required to do that and that our evidence sits with the Crown pending review,\" said Lasson, who confirmed the investigation was submitted with the potential for charges. Lasson said police have been able to talk to survivors of the crash, but have been unable to talk with the bus driver, noting it is due to his ongoing medical condition. Police had previously said the semi-driver had the right of way. \"We won't be able to talk to the driver.\" Lasson called this a unique and complex investigation and pointed to those factors as the reason why it took so long to submit the final results. \"We needed to get this right and I am confident that we did.\" The impact on first responders When asked about how the first responders to the crash are dealing now, Lasson said this is an incident that is going to stick with them for the rest of their lives. \"This is something that is unimaginable for first responders and police officers, even though throughout our careers we attend many tragic scenes. But this one was honestly above and beyond anything that we can comprehend.\" The majority of the officers involved in attending the scene and investigating the incident are back to work in some capacity Lasson said, and he noted RCMP has programs in place to monitor these officers. A memorial to remember the victims will be unveiled on June 15, 2024, in Dauphin. Lasson said some officers who attended the scene a year ago will be in attendance. \"It'll be sad, very emotional, mourning, grieving…police officers are people too and when we experience things like this, there is a personal connection made to that. We can't help that.\" Ahead of Saturday, Lasson again offered his condolences and apologized to the impacted families for the loss they have experienced. He also thanked them for their ongoing understanding and help during the investigation. - With files from The Canadian Press [Winnipeg Top Stories](https://winnipeg.ctvnews.ca/) CTVNews.ca Top Stories DEVELOPING [Two potential tornadoes in Quebec, warning lifted for Ontario](https://www.ctvnews.ca/climate-and-environment/two-potential-tornadoes-in-quebec-warning-lifted-for-ontario-1.6924920) Tornado warnings have been issued describing 'dangerous and potentially life-threatening' situations amid severe thunderstorms in Ontario and Quebec.

The Philadelphia 76ers also lost 28 straight from the end of the 2014-15 season into the beginning of the 2015-16 campaign.\nThe Pistons previously broke the single-season NBA record for consecutive losses on Tuesday when they suffered their 27th straight defeat at the hands of the Brooklyn Nets.\nHere’s how the NBA world reacted to Detroit’s latest historic loss:\nThe Detroit Pistons blew a 19 point halftime lead and have now lost 28 straight games😬\npic.twitter.com/XVbONUY2tn\n— Fanatics Sportsbook | PB (@fanaticsbook_pb) December 29, 2023\nThe Celtics decided to give the Pistons a head start and still won… pic.twitter.com/qVzReDKKPD\n— Celtics Junkies (@Celtics_Junkies) December 29, 2023\nthe pistons are like watching a 16th seed try to beat a 1 seed but every single night over and over again. elite content.\n— alex (@steven_lebron) December 29, 2023\nThe Celtics after avoiding being the team the Pistons snapped the losing streak against pic.twitter.com/btBI7zUas1\n— Complex Sports (@ComplexSports) December 29, 2023\nNEW DETROIT PISTONS BANNER 🫡 pic.twitter.com/k1iOj5NyKW\n— Kofie.bsky.social (@Kofie) December 29, 2023\n“What was the Pistons' 28th consecutive loss like?” pic.twitter.com/SBqe9VZG5N\n— FanDuel (@FanDuel) December 29, 2023\npistons fans never getting them damn wings pic.twitter.com/91NkgmKF3M\n— 𝐬𝐞a✬ (@destroynectar) December 29, 2023\nIf they just put the Pistons on National TV every game until that streak ends I wouldn’t complain\n— RB (@RyB_311) December 29, 2023\nYou know this losing streak means something when my mom who doesn’t watch basketball is texting me live updates about the Pistons\n— ry (@NinjaBands) December 29, 2023\nWe are 4 days away from 2024 and the Texas Rangers have still won a game more recently than the Detroit Pistons\n— lynzie ✭ (@lynziekate) December 29, 2023\nPistons are easily the best team to ever lose 28 straight games.\n— Frank Isola (@TheFrankIsola) December 29, 2023\nDetroit, which hasn’t won a game since Oct. 28, will now have to beat the Toronto Raptors at home on Saturday to avoid a record-breaking 29th straight loss.\nThe now-2-29 Pistons also find themselves in danger of recording one of the worst seasons in league history. The 1972-73 Sixers own the record for most losses (73), the 1947-48 Providence Steam Rollers own the record for fewest wins (6) and the 2011-12 Charlotte Bobcats own the record for worst winning percentage (.106).",

Sign in with Google Continue with Facebook Login using other methods Aryna Sabalenka, Daria Kasatkina, Sloane Stephens and several other tennis players have reacted to the extreme temperatures they are currently practicing in ahead of the Brisbane International, with the mercury soaring above 35 degrees Celsius (95 Fahrenheit).\nSeveral ATP and WTA players have landed in Brisbane in the middle of the Australian summer, to commence their 2024 campaigns at the 250 and 500 events, respectively. The tournament's main draw is scheduled from December 31–January 7, whereas the qualifiers are already underway. Meanwhile, those who have earned a direct entry to the main draw have started their on-court preparations.\nOn Friday, December 29, the likes of Aryna Sabalenka, Daria Kasatkina and Sloane Stephens took the practice court during the day session. They shared glimpses of their training while also highlighting that they were grappling with extreme heat .\nSabalenka, the top seed at the WTA 500 Brisbane International, revealed the temperature during her practice to be 37 degrees Celsius (approximately 99 Fahrenheit). 2017 US Open champion Sloane Stephens and World No. 27 Anastasia Potapova, too, accorded with the World No. 2.\nMeanwhile, for former World No. 8 Daria Kasatkina, former World No. 1 Karolina Pliskova, and 2022 French Open semifinalist Martina Trevisan, the mercury nudged 38 degrees Celsius (over 100 Fahrenheit).\nKasatkina also showed her sunburned face to her fans on social media.\nAryna Sabalenka, Daria Kasatkina and Sloane Stephens on Instagram Other tennis players on Instagram It is worth noting that the Australian Bureau of Meteorology had issued a ‘Severe Heatwave Warning’ for Brisbane on December 27, stating that the extreme conditions were expected to last through December 29.\nThis isn’t the first time that the tennis players have had to bear the brunt of the summer Down Under. With the entire Australian swing taking place in late December and across January, there have been numerous instances annually, where the play has been halted or the competitors have retired due to fatigue.\nJust this year at the 2023 Australian Open, the Extreme Heat Policy was put in place and several matches were suspended when the temperature crossed the tournament’s Heat Stress Scale threshold of 5.0.",

    "text": "Does everybody remember when the Kamala Harris for President slogan was the \"campaign of joy\"? That campaign spin lasted about as long as the time Joe Biden tried to stay awake past 9 p.m.\nNow, like a Roomba returning to its home base, the Harris campaign is back to \"Trump loves Hitler and if he wins everybody dies.\"\nThis has provided quite a contrast with what Trump's doing, which is addressing the concerns that voters actually have. The Federalist's Mollie Hemingway compares the two closing arguments. Choose your fighter:\nTrump closing argument: \"I'll fight for you and do for you what I did before on the economy, foreign policy, border, etc.\"\n— Mollie (@MZHemingway)\nHarris: \"We need Trump's cholesterol numbers and he has secretly told John Kelly evil things he's never told anyone else.\"[October 24, 2024]\nTeam Harris has also called in Eminem, Springsteen, Beyonce and everybody else who's well known but not named \"Kamala Harris.\" Meanwhile, the headliner people show up to see at Trump rallies is Donald Trump.\nPretty much sums that up\n— Chris Boutell (@CBoutell)[pic.twitter.com/SFv4X1DL1W][October 24, 2024]\nVote accordingly\n— tzmolen (@tzmolen)[https://t.co/kicCg0OFVj][October 24, 2024]\nYes, please do!",
