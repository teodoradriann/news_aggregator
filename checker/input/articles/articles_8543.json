    "text": "[News](https://ijr.com/news/) Franklin Graham Scorches Christianity Today Article Claiming Jesus Was Asian Franklin Graham, the son of late evangelist Billy Graham, scorched the Christian media magazine Christianity Today for claiming Jesus Christ was Asian. On Dec. 27, Graham, 71, responded to the article from Christianity Today on X, formerly known as Twitter. “[Christianity Today Magazine] is being criticized for their article about artists depicting Jesus as Asian—and I also have to ask why they would publish something so far off base. We don’t have to wonder or speculate about this—the Bible gives us very specific details about Jesus’ earthly lineage and where He was born and grew up,” he wrote. Additionally, Graham stated, “We know that Jesus was Jewish” and noted that not believing or accepting the Bible as “the Word of God” puts everything “in question.” “Guess what—we don’t get to make God in our own image. He is Who He is! We must be on guard against anything or anyone who attempts to undermine the authority of the Word of God,” he concluded. This came after Christianity Today promoted the article Christmas Eve on X. “Jesus was born in Asia. He was Asian. The artists in this photo essay bring him back to Asia—but not to ancient Israel,” the magazine wrote. The magazine added, “These nine artworks proclaim the expansiveness of Christ’s kingdom.” In the [article](https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2023/december-web-only/nativity-art-asian-jesus-birth-china-india-middle-east.html?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=article), written by art curator Victoria Emily Jones on Dec. 18, titled “How Asian Artists Picture Jesus’ Birth From 1240 to Today” she stated, “Some may object to depicting Jesus as anything other than a brown male born into a Jewish family in Bethlehem of Judea in the first century, believing that doing so undermines his historicity.” However, she claimed that “Christian artists who tackle the subject of the Incarnation are often aiming not at historical realism but at theological meaning.” “By representing Jesus as Japanese, Indonesian, or Indian, “convey a sense of God’s immanence, his “with-us–ness,” for their own communities—and for everyone else, the universality of Christ’s birth,” she shared.

    "title": "Vaccine safety panel long criticized by RFK Jr. told to postpone meeting",
    "text": "The Trump administration has directed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to indefinitely postpone a public meeting of its vaccine advisory panel, a key forum for the nation’s discussion of information about vaccine safety and effectiveness.\nExperts say vaccines are safe and effective, but the independent 19-member vaccine advisory panel meets regularly to review the latest scientific evidence, vote on recommendations to the CDC director and present data on vaccine safety and effectiveness. As HHS secretary, experts fear that Kennedy — who has asserted the panel fails to adequately test vaccines and be transparent about safety data — could use his authority to potentially steer vaccine skeptics onto the advisory committee or to abolish the panel altogether.\nAndrew Nixon, an HHS spokesperson, said the meeting scheduled for Feb. 26 to 28 will not take place, and would be “postponed to accommodate public comment in advance of the meeting.” No date has been set for a rescheduled meeting.\nPublic health groups criticized the postponement of the federal advisory committee meeting, saying it would delay action and public discussion on pressing infectious diseases threats, including one of the worst flu seasons in years.\nAn executive order signed Wednesday night by President Donald Trump aimed at cutting federal bureaucracy, included language on cutting “unnecessary” federal advisory committees.\nDuring Kennedy’s confirmation hearing, Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee Chair Bill Cassidy (R-Louisiana) said he received commitments from Kennedy that he would work within the current vaccine approval and safety monitoring systems and not establish parallel systems. “If confirmed, he will maintain the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices without changes,” Cassidy said in a Feb. 4 Senate speech.\nA draft agenda for the three-day meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) that was to take place includes information about 10 vaccines, including the effectiveness of influenza vaccine and a presentation on possible side effects of a newly approved vaccine to prevent chikungunya, a mosquito-borne disease that causes fever and joint pain.\nPanel members were scheduled to vote on recommendations for the use of the chikungunya vaccine, a new meningitis vaccine, and new recommendations on influenza and vaccines for RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, a common respiratory virus that can be especially dangerous for babies.\nThe Food and Drug Administration licenses vaccines, but clinicians wait for recommendations from the CDC advisory panel to understand the best ways to use them. In addition, insurance generally does not cover new vaccines without a recommendation from the vaccine panel.\nNews about the postponed meeting drew swift reaction. More than 50 medical experts and organizations sent a letter to Kennedy, Cassidy and the CDC’s acting director, Susan Monarez, to preserve the panel’s meeting and agenda.\nThe meeting holds “tremendous weight and relevance,” said the letter, which included signatories from the American Medical Association, the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Partnership to Fight Chronic Disease. “Infectious diseases are constantly evolving opponents; vaccines are among the best tools for constantly adapting and responding to the latest public health threats.”\nThe meetings are held three times a year. They are usually all-day meetings and discussions and votes are broadcast through a live video stream, the type of activities in which “a thoughtful, transparent and well-organized scientific community engages,” the letter said.\nMaking America healthy, part of Kennedy’s signature “Make America Health Again” mantra, “requires healthy discussion and timely, evidence-based decisions,” the letter said. “This meeting should to be no different.”\nJamie Loehr, a physician and panel member who was scheduled to present data on the effectiveness of influenza vaccine, said he was disappointed that the scheduled meeting had been postponed.\n“The ACIP is an voluntary panel of experts which has met regularly for over 50 years, providing the American medical community and American citizens guidance on when and how to use lifesaving vaccines,” Loehr said. During the coronavirus pandemic, the panel went far beyond the call of duty, he said, working 16 hour days and meeting monthly, sometimes weekly, to provide the American public with a vaccine that saved millions of lives.\n“I hope the American public will not infer from this decision to postpone the meeting that I have any hesitation regarding the benefits and safety of recommended vaccines,” he said.\nImmunization advocates, who had warned that Kennedy’s repeated disparaging of vaccines and falsely linking them to autism could undermine established science about the safety of vaccines, criticized the delay.\nKelly Moore, president and CEO of Immunize.org, a nonprofit focused on vaccination education for health-care professionals, said organizations had been looking forward to this meeting, especially the data on the effectiveness of influenza vaccine this season, “given that this has been the most severe flu season in 15 years for people of all ages,” she said.\n“We know many people are still unvaccinated against influenza this year, and they can still be helped by vaccination now as this severe season continues in full swing,” she said.\nWithout the meeting, Americans will also have to wait indefinitely for the recommendations for newly licensed vaccines for other diseases, she said.\nRegular meetings of the panel are scheduled months in advance, with notice about public comment for each meeting. Meetings where votes will take place must allow a period for public comment.\nFor weeks, CDC officials have been asking whether the meeting could proceed, but without formal approval to go ahead, appropriate notice for public comment was not opened. HHS officials imposed an abrupt halt on external communications by CDC and other health agencies a month ago, disrupting the flow of much basic information from the agencies to other health organizations and community groups.\nHHS spokesman Nixon said the vaccine advisory panel’s work groups — or subcommittees focused on reviewing relevant data and developing recommendations to present to the full panel — met as scheduled this month and will present at an upcoming ACIP meeting.",

    "text": "Microsoft layoffs: 1,900 workers at Activision Blizzard and Xbox to be let go [Eric Lagatta](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/5803430002/eric-lagatta/) [Paul Davidson](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/2646662001/paul-davidson/) Microsoft will lay off 1,900 employees at Activision Blizzard and Xbox, the latest tech company to announce cuts so far in 2024. The layoffs represent about an 8% cut of its video gaming staff of 22,000 workers and come months after Microsoft [acquired Activision](/story/money/2023/10/13/microsoft-activision-blizzard-call-of-duty-acquisition-deal/71167139007/) in a blockbuster deal. The $69 billion transaction in October represented one of the largest tech deals in history as Microsoft took over the studios behind bestselling games like Call of Duty, Diablo and Overwatch for its Xbox console. The planned cuts are part of a larger “execution plan” that would reduce “areas of overlap,” Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer wrote in an internal memo, which was quoted in multiple news reports. \"We are grateful for all of the creativity, passion and dedication they have brought to our games, our players and our colleagues,\" Spencer is quoted as saying in the memo. \"We will provide our full support to those who are impacted during the transition.\" Microsoft confirmed news of the layoffs when reached Thursday by USA TODAY but declined to provide a copy of the memo. Layoffs: [Business Insider to lay off around 8% of employees in latest media job cuts](/story/money/2024/01/25/business-insider-layoffs/72351587007/) Blizzard executives announce resignations Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard was seen as [ a strategy to keep pace](/story/money/2024/01/16/microsoft-worth-more-than-apple/72239504007/) with Sony and Nintendo in a console race by adding more games to its multi-game subscription service and cloud gaming libraries. Microsoft’s Xbox gaming console, which ranks third in sales behind PlayStation and Nintendo, seeks to fold Activision titles into its Game Pass service, which isn't unlike Netflix but for video games. The Wall Street Journal [reported](https://www.wsj.com/tech/microsoft-layoffs-videogaming-staff-4cc124c7?page=1) that the planned cuts, which mostly target Activision Blizzard employees, reflect \"redundancies\" after the October acquisition of video game company. Spencer said in the cited memo that Microsoft would provide location-dependent severance to all laid-off employees. Alongside the layoffs, two Blizzard Entertainment executives are leaving the company, President Mike Ybarra and design chief Allen Adham, a Microsoft spokesman told multiple outlets. Ybarra confirmed the news himself of his immediate departure in a [post](https://twitter.com/Qwik/status/1750527310493868293) Thursday on social media platform X. \"Leading Blizzard through an incredible time and being part of the team, shaping it for the future ahead, was an absolute honor,\" Ybarra said in the post. Other tech layoffs in the news Several big-name companies have already announced 2024 job cuts, including [Amazon](/story/money/2024/01/10/twitch-layoffs-job-cuts/72174329007/), [eBay](/story/money/2024/01/24/ebay-layoffs-2024/72335627007/) and In the tech sector, at least, job cuts are fewer this year than last. Another layoff tracking site, [Layoffs.fyi](https://layoffs.fyi/), reports that [76 tech companies had announced 21,370 layoffs](https://layoffs.fyi/) through late January. By contrast, 277 firms had laid off 89,709 workers through January 2023. But some economists foresee more layoffs to come, amid talk of a [possible economic slowdown later in 2024](/story/money/2024/01/22/shrinking-profits-spark-layoffs/72283931007/).",

    "text": "LAKE WORTH, Fla. (CBS12) — The Chabad of Lake Worth unveiled its first-ever \"branded\" Jewish teen center, and it’s all the brainchild of local teens who felt that a safe space was necessary during these challenging times for Jewish youth. The CTeen Lounge is a center where Jewish teens can go to relax and bond with like-minded people in a safe and enjoyable environment. “In this time when we just need the light and this CTeen Lounge, it really just gives us that light that the world needs right now in this time of darkness,\" said local teen Neta Froimovich. Neta is a part of the group of teens who advocated for their own space. And she says the Chabad of Lake Worth’s newly unveiled CTeen lounge is perfect, especially as she and her peers have seen increasing anti-semitism across the country. “I think that every teen needs a kind of support system and the Jewish CTeen Lounge, having an open space, that physical tangible space that we have. It's crucial. It's really great,\" said Neta. And they’re not alone, a study done by the Anti-Defamation League reveals after the October 7th attack on Israel by Hamas, Antisemitic incidents rose in schools by 54 percent.

Rabbi Mendy’s wife, and co-director of CTeen Lake Worth, Leah says this center can help shape teens’ futures. “If they understand their value and they know how necessary they are. And they feel valued by us as a community. Then they become the leaders of the next generation,\" said Leah. And teens like Neta are more than grateful to have the support. “It's really that place where you're able to connect with that Jewish soul that you have, and even not Jewish having that safe space to talk about whatever you need to talk about. Its important-it's really important,\" said Neta. Rabbi Mendy says even though they just opened, so many teens utilize this space that they’re already talking about how they can expand it.",

    "title": "Unconventional ADHD Treatments: Exploring Emerging Medications Beyond the Mainstream",
    "text": "Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders, affecting millions of children and adults worldwide. It is characterized by symptoms such as inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, which can significantly disrupt daily functioning in academic, professional, and social settings. While stimulant medications like methylphenidate (Ritalin) and amphetamines (Adderall) have long been the cornerstone of ADHD treatment, not everyone responds well to these conventional therapies. Furthermore, there is growing interest in exploring unconventional and emerging treatments for ADHD that fall outside of the mainstream options. These alternative medications and therapies may offer hope for individuals who struggle with traditional treatments or who experience significant side effects.\nIn this article, we will delve into some of the unconventional and emerging medications that are being researched or used in the treatment of ADHD, focusing on their mechanisms, efficacy, and potential benefits.\n1. Alpha-2 Adrenergic Agonists: Clonidine and Guanfacine Alpha-2 adrenergic agonists, such as clonidine and guanfacine, are primarily used as antihypertensive medications, but they have also shown promise as ADHD treatments, especially for children. These drugs work by stimulating receptors in the brain that help regulate norepinephrine and other neurotransmitters, which can play a role in controlling symptoms of ADHD .\nClonidine: Originally developed to treat high blood pressure, clonidine has been found to help reduce hyperactivity and impulsivity in children with ADHD. It is often used when stimulant medications are either ineffective or cause undesirable side effects, such as insomnia or irritability. Clonidine’s sedating effects can also help children with ADHD who struggle with sleep disturbances.\nGuanfacine: Another alpha-2 agonist, guanfacine (brand name Intuniv), has been FDA-approved for the treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents. It has a similar effect to clonidine but is thought to be more selective, meaning it may have fewer side effects. Guanfacine works by enhancing prefrontal cortex functioning, which is involved in executive functions such as working memory, decision-making, and attention regulation.\nBoth of these medications offer an alternative to stimulants, especially for children who have co-occurring issues like anxiety or sleep disturbances.\n2. Norepinephrine-Dopamine Reuptake Inhibitors (NDRIs): Bupropion Bupropion (brand name Wellbutrin) is a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI) primarily used to treat depression and smoking cessation. Interestingly, there is growing evidence suggesting that bupropion may also be beneficial for ADHD, particularly in individuals who cannot tolerate stimulant medications or who have a history of substance abuse.\nBupropion works by increasing the levels of norepinephrine and dopamine in the brain, two neurotransmitters that play a critical role in attention, motivation, and mood regulation. Studies have shown that bupropion can reduce ADHD symptoms in both children and adults, although it is not FDA-approved specifically for this purpose. It is sometimes used off-label as an alternative to stimulants, especially for individuals with comorbid conditions such as depression or anxiety.\nOne of the major advantages of bupropion is that it is not addictive and has a lower risk of abuse compared to stimulant medications, which makes it an attractive option for individuals with substance use disorders. Additionally, it can have mood-stabilizing effects, which may be particularly helpful for individuals with ADHD who also experience depression or anxiety.\n3. Modafinil: A Wakefulness-Promoting Agent Modafinil (brand name Provigil) is a wakefulness-promoting agent that is typically prescribed for conditions such as narcolepsy and obstructive sleep apnea. However, due to its ability to enhance focus and cognitive performance, it has also gained attention as a potential treatment for ADHD, particularly in adults.\nUnlike traditional stimulants, modafinil has a unique mechanism of action. It works by increasing the availability of dopamine in the brain, but it does so in a more gradual and less direct manner than traditional stimulants. This results in fewer side effects such as jitteriness or anxiety. Modafinil has been shown to improve cognitive performance, attention, and focus in individuals with ADHD, and some studies suggest it may have fewer addictive properties compared to stimulant medications.\nHowever, modafinil is not FDA-approved for ADHD treatment, and its use for this purpose remains off-label. While initial studies show promising results, more research is needed to determine its long-term efficacy and safety in individuals with ADHD.\n4. The Role of Cannabinoids in ADHD Treatment Cannabis and cannabinoids have been the subject of growing interest in the treatment of various medical conditions, including ADHD. While the relationship between ADHD and cannabis use is complex—cannabis use is sometimes seen as a way for individuals with ADHD to self-medicate—it is also worth exploring the potential therapeutic effects of specific cannabinoids.\nCBD (Cannabidiol): Unlike THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), which has psychoactive effects, CBD is non-psychoactive and is believed to have neuroprotective and anti-anxiety properties. Some studies suggest that CBD may help reduce hyperactivity, impulsivity, and anxiety in individuals with ADHD. It is thought that CBD may work by influencing the brain’s endocannabinoid system, which regulates mood, attention, and memory.\nTHC (Tetrahydrocannabinol): While the use of THC in ADHD treatment is controversial due to its psychoactive effects, there is emerging evidence suggesting that low doses of THC may help improve focus and reduce anxiety in some individuals. However, the use of THC in ADHD treatment requires caution, as it can exacerbate certain symptoms, particularly in adolescents.\nAlthough cannabinoid-based treatments hold potential, research in this area is still in its infancy. As with other alternative treatments, more rigorous clinical trials are needed to fully understand the risks and benefits of cannabinoids for ADHD.\n5. Ketamine and Its Potential in ADHD Treatment Ketamine, a dissociative anesthetic, is best known for its use in surgical procedures and as a treatment for depression. In recent years, however, it has gained attention for its potential in treating various psychiatric conditions, including ADHD. Ketamine acts on the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors in the brain, which are involved in mood regulation, learning, and memory. Preliminary research suggests that ketamine may have rapid-acting effects on symptoms of ADHD, particularly in adults.\nKetamine’s potential as an ADHD treatment is still being explored, but it has shown promise in addressing co-occurring issues such as depression, anxiety, and executive function impairments. As with other unconventional treatments, the use of ketamine for ADHD remains experimental, and more research is needed to assess its safety and efficacy.\n6. Psychostimulant Alternatives: L-Theanine and Rhodiola Rosea For individuals looking for non-pharmacological options to complement traditional ADHD treatments, natural compounds such as L-theanine and Rhodiola Rosea are gaining popularity.\nL-Theanine: Found in green tea, L-theanine is an amino acid known for its calming effects. It is thought to enhance the production of alpha waves in the brain, which are associated with a relaxed yet alert state. Some studies have suggested that L-theanine can help improve attention and reduce stress, making it a potential adjunctive treatment for ADHD.\nRhodiola Rosea: An adaptogenic herb used in traditional medicine, Rhodiola Rosea is believed to enhance mental clarity, reduce fatigue, and improve focus. Some preliminary research suggests that Rhodiola may be beneficial for individuals with ADHD, particularly in terms of reducing mental fatigue and improving cognitive performance.\nWhile these natural supplements are not a substitute for conventional ADHD treatments, they may offer benefits when used as part of a broader therapeutic strategy.\nConclusion The landscape of ADHD treatment is evolving, and unconventional therapies are beginning to gain traction. While stimulant medications remain the gold standard for many individuals, emerging treatments such as alpha-2 adrenergic agonists, norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors, and even cannabinoids offer promising alternatives. However, as with any medical treatment, it is essential to work closely with a healthcare provider to determine the best course of action. Research into these unconventional treatments is still in its early stages, and while they may offer benefits for some, their safety and efficacy require further investigation. As science progresses, it is likely that ADHD treatment will become increasingly personalized, allowing individuals to find the most effective solution for their unique needs.",
