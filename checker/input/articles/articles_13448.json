    "text": "NEW DELHI: Highlighting the historical and cultural connect between the two nations, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday said that like India, the history and culture of Austria is also very old and magnificent.\n“Our contacts have also been historic and both countries have benefited from it. This benefit has happened in culture as well as in commerce. The study of Sanskrit had started in the University of Vienna about 200 years ago. It gained further prominence with the establishment of an Independent Chair for Indology in 1880… Vienna has hosted many of our great personalities such as Rabindranath Tagore and Netaji Subhash Bose and Gandhiji’s disciple Miraben spent her last days in Vienna,” he said.\nModi was addressing the Indian community at an event organised in his honour by the Indian diaspora in Vienna. The Austrian Federal Minister of Labour and Economy Martin Kocher also attended the event.\nThe PM said that there is a lot of interest globally in India’s thoughts and actions. He emphasised that India has shared knowledge and expertise with the world for thousands of years, promoting peace and prosperity, rather than war.\n“Everyone wants to understand India. What is India thinking today? What is India doing? It is necessary to create a better informed world regarding this. For thousands of years we have been sharing knowledge and expertise with the world. We did not give wars, we can proudly say to the world that India did not give ‘Yuddha’ (wars) but Buddha. When I talk about Buddha, it means that India has always given peace and prosperity. Today when the world sees India as a world friend, it is a matter of pride for us,” Modi said.\nHe also dwelt on India being a “Vishwabandhu” and contributing to global progress and well-being. He urged the community to continue nurturing their cultural and emotional bonds with the motherland, even as they prosper in their new homeland.\nIn his address, Modi also shared his thoughts on the contribution made by the Indian Diaspora to strengthening bilateral relations between the two countries. He stated that his visit to the country at a time when the two friendly nations were celebrating 75 years of diplomatic ties, made it truly special. Recalling the shared democratic values and pluralistic ethos of the two countries, Modi underlined the expanse, scale and success of recent Indian elections, where the people of India voted for continuity, giving him the mandate for a historic third term.\nAustria is home to about 31,000 Indian diaspora, which mainly consists of professionals working in the health-care and other sectors and in multilateral UN bodies. There are around 500 Indian students pursuing higher education there.\nThe PM said that geographically, India and Austria are at two different ends, but there are many similarities. “Democracy connects the two countries. Liberty, Equality, Pluralism and respect for the rule of law are our shared values. Both our societies are multi-cultural and multilingual. In both the countries, in our society, it is the habit of both of us to celebrate diversity. And a major medium to reflect these values is elections. Elections are going to be held in Austria in a few months. Whereas in India we have just celebrated the festival of democracy with great pomp and show,” he said.\nModi returned to New Delhi on Thursday morning after a two-nation visit to Russia and Austria.",

    "text": "by: Johan Sheridan\nPosted: Jun 13, 2024 / 04:18 PM EDT\nUpdated: Jun 13, 2024 / 04:18 PM EDT\nby: Johan Sheridan\nPosted: Jun 13, 2024 / 04:18 PM EDT\nUpdated: Jun 13, 2024 / 04:18 PM EDT\nSHARE\nALBANY, N.Y. (NEXSTAR) — Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo returned to the public eye this week, testifying before Congress about the aftermath of his executive order sending COVID patients to nursing homes on Tuesday. That same day, Cuomo’s team sued the Office of the New York State Comptroller and Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli for refusing to reimburse all of his legal fees.\nAlso this week, a federal judge decided to honor the “sovereign immunity” argument from the Office of the New York Attorney General (OAG), which refused to grant universal access to the investigation into the former governor to Cuomo’s legal team. These connected lawsuits and testimonies represent the latest in the former governor’s crusade to clear his name once the crisis crumbled his administration.\nKnowing he was the subject of investigations into a double scandal taking shape—COVID at nursing homes and misconduct accusations—then-Gov. Cuomo required that both his defense and the legal experts investigating him come from third-party legal firms. Damning reports came from the nonbiased fact-finding excursion to ultimately legitimize Cuomo’s status today as political persona non grata.\nNew York gets $44 million from Johnson & Johnson for baby powder “The State Assembly yesterday outlined weeks of process that will then lead to months of litigation, time and money that government should spend managing Covid, guarding against the Delta variant, reopening upstate, fighting gun violence and saving New York City. All that time would be wasted,” the governor said when he resigned in the days after the misconduct report was released. “Wasting energy on distractions is the last thing that state government should be doing. And I cannot be the cause of that.”\nAfter the fall, the former governor kicked off several legal actions against the state in an apparent effort to clear his name, with New York State footing the bill for both sides of the litigation. Accusers also filed federal lawsuits against him. The different venues—state and federal—mean different sets of rules for related parts of these disparate court proceedings.\nCannabis board overhaul rolling out as home growing rules take shape According to the Comptroller’s Office, “From January 1, 2020 to date, the state has spent nearly $11.5 million for defense costs for former Governor Cuomo and former executive chamber officials under Public Officers Law section 17 in the matters of Trooper 1 v NYSP et al. and Bennett v Cuomo et al . Of this amount, nearly $6.8 million has been paid to Glavin PLLC and Sher Tremonte LLP for representation of former Governor Cuomo,” said a spokesperson from the Comptroller’s Office. “Additional monies have been expended by the state for legal representation related to the sexual harassment investigation, COVID-19 response, and impeachment proceedings, etc. under budget appropriations (eg, L.2023 c.50) and legal services contracts.”\nIn 2023, Cuomo’s legal team subpoenaed—and ultimately filed a Freedom of Informational Law request with—the OAG for access to the evidence gathered for the misconduct report. OAG challenged the subpoena on the grounds of “sovereign immunity,” which protects the agency from being sued by a New Yorker in federal court for refusing to divulge confidential information about witnesses.\nNew York mulls sunsetting regents requirements U.S. Magistrate Judge Sarah Cave eventually agreed, affirming as well that the third-party law firm that investigated Cuomo could not be legally compelled to produce the documents at issue. Take a look at that decision here or at the bottom of this story.\n“We respectfully disagree with this decision which will establish a terrible precedent allowing state agencies like the Attorney General’s Office to pick and choose willy nilly when or when not to turn over documents in federal cases. We are reviewing our options to appeal,” said Cuomo spokesperson Rich Azzopardi.\nConsumer alert: Scams targeting older New Yorkers now more common, successful, and expensive When Cuomo’s camp asked the Comptroller’s Office to reimburse the legal fees related to the FOIL request, the agency refused. Because Cuomo directed his motions at a state agency in a federal case, the jurisdiction created an issue, the agency argued.\nIn an email—you can take a look at it here , or at the bottom of this story—to Cuomo attorney Rita Glavin, a lawyer for the agency said, “An affirmative action brought in a different jurisdiction against a non-party arising under an unrelated state statute is not lawfully part of the “defense” of a federal action as contemplated by Public Officers Law § 17.”\nNew York State issues standing order for doulas, Hochul adds 20 hours of prenatal sick time That’s why Cuomo sued.

    "text": "Nikki Haley has 24 hours in New Hampshire she'd rather forget: Bizarre moment a NINE-YEAR-OLD compares her to 'flip-flopping John Kerry' after she was forced to clean-up Civil War comments - Republican Nikki Haley was told by a 9-year-old on Thursday that she was a 'flip-flopper' like 2004 Democratic presidential hopeful John Kerry - The comment came at a New Hampshire town hall where she was asked about her stance on former President Donald Trump - It came after a gaffe when she answered a question about what caused the Civil War without mentioning slavery Republican presidential candidate [Nikki Haley](/news/nikki-haley/index.html) ended 24 hours in [New Hampshire](/news/new-hampshire/index.html) she'd rather forget by facing off against a 9-year-old who compared her to John Kerry Thursday afternoon. The night before, Haley stuck her foot in her mouth at a New Hampshire town hall when asked what caused the Civil War and then failed to mention slavery. She spent the bulk of Thursday in the Granite State cleaning up those comments before heading to North Conway where she faced audience members' questions yet again. 'So Chris Christie think that you're a flip-flopper on the [Donald Trump](/news/donald_trump/index.html) issue,' a child named Adam boldly told her. 'And honestly, I agree with him. You're basically the new John Kerry,' the kid said to laughs. Kerry was the [Democrats](/news/democrats/index.html)' 2004 presidential nominee, who was criticized for constantly changing his position, and lost to incumbent Republican President George W. Bush. Nikki Haley was confronted by a 9-year-old at a town hall Thursday in North Conway, New Hampshire, who compared her to 'flip-flopper' John Kerry on the issue of support for former President Donald Trump 'How can you change your opinion like that in just eight years and will you pardon Donald Trump?' the 9-year-old then asked. Christie, who is also running for the Republican nomination, has been critical of Haley for being too soft on Trump, her former boss. Haley commended the youngster and said that politics is often about 'distraction.' She answered that she hasn't been able to appease 'anti-Trumpers' nor 'pro-Trumpers' with her stance on the ex-president, who is leading the GOP primary pack. 'I told you that I agreed with a lot of his policies. But do I think he's the right president to go forward? No,' Haley answered. 'We can't handle the chaos anymore.' She also used the question to go after Christie. 'I mean God bless him, he's a friend. He's obsessed with Trump,' Haley said. 'He sleeps, eats and breaths it, every day.' Christie was one of only a handful of GOP hopefuls to base his run off being a Trump critic. 'I'm thinking bigger than that,' Haley said. 'If we do that, we're no different than Trump.' Nikki Haley cleaned-up her town hall blunder leaving slavery out as a reason for the Civil War by claiming 'that's the easy part' – and suggested the person who asked the question was a 'plant' Earlier Thursday, Haley was clarifying that her comments about the Civil War didn't mention slavery because 'that's the easy part.' Haley told [CNN](/news/cnn/index.html) that it's 'unquestioned' that the Civil War was about slavery, adding: 'But it was also more than that.' 'It was about the freedoms of every individual. It was about the role of government,' she insisted. [She also said in an interview with Pulse of New Hampshire radio show](https://thepulseofnh.com/good-morning-nh/nikki-haley-responds-to-civil-war-comment-on-good-morning-new-hampshire/) that she was answering the question by putting it into the context of what it means to Americans in the present day. 'Of course the Civil War was about slavery. We know that. That's the easy part of it,' Haley said Thursday morning. 'What I was saying was: What does it mean to us today?' 'What it means to us today is about freedom. That's what that was all about,' the former United Nations Ambassador said. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' communications director said Haley's damage control was weak. 'I think it always comes down to the role of government and what the rights of the people are, and I will always stand by the fact that I think government was intended to secure the rights and freedoms of the people,' she said Haley's refusal to acknowledge this caught the ire of many across the political spectrum 'Embarrassing cleanup attempt,' Andrew Romeo wrote on X. 'Even if that is true...If she can't handle a question as basic as the cause of the Civil War, what does she think is going to happen to her in a general election.' 'The Democrats would eat her lunch,' he added. Critics included her 2024 Republican competitors, but also President Joe Biden who quipped on X, formerly Twitter: 'It was about slavery.' The former governor for South Carolina also insisted Thursday morning that the person who prompted the response was sent as a plant in an effort to get media to attack her as her [poll figures skyrocket in New Hampshire](/news/article-12892755/nikki-haley-donald-trump-new-hampshire-republican-primary.html). She jokingly told the audience member asking the question Wednesday: 'Well, don't come with an easy question.' She then claimed that the Civil War was fought for freedom and ideological differences in how governments are supposed to work. 'I think the cause of the Civil War was basically how government was going to run, the freedoms of what people could and couldn't do.' Historians generally agree that slavery, and the divided opinions of Northern and Southern states over whether to abolish it, was the primary cause of the Civil War Donald Trump is currently leading the race for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination – and the ex-president has not ruled out tapping Haley as his running mate The White House hopeful, currently fighting for a distant second place after Trump with DeSantis, then went on a tangent about government overreach and civil liberties.

'It was never meant to be all things to all people. Government doesn't need to tell you how to live your life. 'They don't need to tell you what you can and can't do. They don't need to be a part of your life. They need to make sure that you have freedom. 'We need to have capitalism. We need to have economic freedom. We need to make sure that we do all things so that individuals have the liberties so that they can have freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom to do or be anything they want to be without government getting in the way.' Following the tangent, she tried to turn the question back to the voter, who told her that he isn't the one running for the Oval Office in 2024. He is then heard saying: 'In 2023, it's astonishing to me that you would answer that question without mentioning the word slavery.' Haley asks him: 'What do you want me to say about slavery? Next question.' New Hampshire holds the first-in-the-nation primary, held just days after the Iowa caucuses, which makes it important for those vying for the nomination to run for president. With just 26 days until the Granite State's elections, Haley is surging in the polls with one survey showing her trailing Trump by only 4 percent with 29 percent support among Republican voters. She clarified Thursday that she is well aware that slavery was a reason for the Civil War. Polling shows Haley is now within only 4 percentage points of Trump with just 26 days until the New Hampshire primary elections on January 23 – and aggregated data from FiveThirtyEight shows that Haley may soon overtake Ron DeSantis to be second place nationally Historians generally agree that slavery, and the divided opinions of Northern and Southern states over whether to abolish it, was the primary cause of the Civil War. The Southern states of the US, including Haley's home state of South Carolina, were pro-slavery, while Northern states were anti-slavery. South Carolina's proclamation outlining its reasons for leaving the Union in 1860 pointed to the 'increasing hostility on the part of the non-slaveholding States to the institution of slavery' as a reason for the state removing itself from the Union. But Haley's refusal to acknowledge this caught the ire of many across the political spectrum. Meanwhile, the DeSantis campaign recirculated video of the exchange on social media, adding the comment, 'Yikes.' Issues surrounding the origins of the Civil War and its heritage are still much of the fabric of Haley's home state, and she has been pressed on the war's origins before. As she ran for governor in 2010, Haley, in an interview with a now-defunct activist group then known as The Palmetto Patriots, described the war as between two disparate sides fighting for 'tradition' and 'change' and said the Confederate flag was 'not something that is racist.' During that same campaign, she dismissed the need for the flag to come down from the Statehouse grounds, portraying her Democratic rival's push for its removal as a desperate political stunt. Five years later, Haley urged lawmakers to remove the flag from its perch near a Confederate soldier monument following a mass shooting in which a white gunman killed eight Black church members who were attending Bible study. At the time, Haley said the flag had been 'hijacked' by the shooter from those who saw the flag as symbolizing 'sacrifice and heritage.' Aggregated polling data from FiveThirtyEight shows that, nationally, Haley may soon overtake Ron DeSantis to be second place in the race for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. Despite this, she has a long way to go to beat Donald Trump, who currently has 61.2% of Republicans pledged to vote for him. Even in her home state, Haley is trailing far behind, with less than half the share of votes that Trump has. The comments below have not been moderated.

    "text": "COLUMBIA, S.C. — The S.C. Drought Response Committee declared Thursday that the entire state is now drought free.\nDue to significant rainfall since mid-December, the committee removed the incipient drought status of 16 counties and the moderate drought status of seven counties.\nThe committee tries to avoid changing the drought status by two levels unless there is substantial support across all drought indicators, which is the case currently, said\nS.C. State Climatologist Hope Mizzell said. The time of year was also a factor, since water use and evaporation are low during the winter months. Most stations across the state reported 7 to 14 inches of rain since Dec. 1, with a few reporting 15 to 20 inches.\nElliot Wickham, water resources climatologist with the State Climatology Office, said that the Upstate had higher precipitation accumulation during the last 40 days than it did during the 91-day period of Sept. 1-Nov. 30, 2023, the period of climatological fall.\nDuring that time, precipitation totals in the Upstate ranged from 4 to 6 inches. Contrastingly, precipitation totals in the Upstate since Dec. 1 have ranged from 8 to 14 inches, roughly twice the amount of precipitation in about half the amount of time.\nThe committee considered several factors when downgrading counties that were previously designated in late November as either incipient” or moderate drought, said committee member Ken Tuck, director of drinking water services with Spartanburg Water.\n“Among those factors, precipitation, crop moisture index, streamflow, lake and reservoir levels, forest fire risk, and short and long-term forecast models provided overwhelming support of a return to normal conditions throughout the state,” Tuck said. “These decisions were not without appropriate discussion, particularly around agriculture and groundwater where full recovery from previous drought conditions may take a little more time. The Drought Response Committee continues to monitor a wide variety of drought indicators and seek observations from a diverse group of stakeholders to make well-informed decisions.”\nPriyanka More,\nS.C. Department of Natural Resources (SCDNR) hydrologist, provided an update of the hydrologic conditions showing improved lake levels and streamflow conditions. Some streams across the state went from much below normal flows in late November to high flows by Jan. 10. The table below shows the lake level improvement since Nov. 29.\nAlthough the streamflows and lake levels have improved in the past few weeks, a few groundwater wells continued to remain below normal conditions. In general, groundwater is a slow indicator and would have a lagged response to the recent rain. Also, it will take bit longer for some of the wells to recover from the dryness experienced during early fall months.\nThe S.C. Drought Response Committee will continue to monitor conditions and meet as needed.\n|Lake Level Improvement|\n|Nov. 29, 2023||Jan. 10, 2024|\n|Savannah River Basin|\n|Jocassee||-8.80 ft||-3.00 ft|\n|Keowee||-2.00 ft||-1.60 ft|\n|Hartwell||-4.86 ft||+0.19 ft|\n|Thurmond||-4.56 ft||-2.30 ft|\n|Catawba Wateree Basin|\n|Wylie||-1.40 ft||+2.30|\n|Wateree||+0.10 ft||+6.00|\n|Santee River Basin|\n|Blalock||+0.11 ft||+2.13|\n|Greenwood||-0.14 ft||+2.15|\n|Murray||-2.19 ft||+0.59|\n|Marion||-0.42 ft||+3.12|\n–SCDNR",
