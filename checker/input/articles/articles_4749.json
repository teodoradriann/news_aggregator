    "text": "ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Hundreds of supporters from Pakistani Islamist parties on Friday rallied to protest against what they say were blasphemous remarks by the country's chief justice.\nThe protest call, by various religious and political groups led by hardline Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan (TLP) whose rallying cry is \"death to blasphemers\", said that remarks by Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa in a case against a member of the minority Ahmadi community were blasphemous.\nThe court had granted bail to an Ahmadi community member earlier this week, ruling that blasphemy charges against him did not stand. The man, accused of blasphemy for distributing Islamic literature, had been in jail for 13 months.\n\"We (will) monitor the sermons and protests outside mosques,\" said police official Abrar Hussain in southern city of Karahci, warning the protesters to remain peaceful.\nHundreds of the protesters took to streets in the northwestern city of Peshawar, chanting slogans against the chief justice, said police official Mubarak Khan.\nThe top court on Thursday issued a statement after the Islamist parties and some political groups launched a campaign accusing the chief justice of deviating in his ruling from the constitutional definition of a Muslim, which excludes Ahmadis.\n\"This impression is absolutely wrong,\" the court statement said, deploring what it called a \"vicious campaign\" against Isa.\nThe campaign against Isa was also joined by some supporters and aides of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan, who think a ruling by the chief justice stripping Khan's party of its symbol on ballots cost them votes in an election on Feb. 8.\nKhan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party's information secretary Rauf Hasan did not respond to a request for a comment.\nHuman rights groups say Pakistan's harsh blasphemy laws are often misused to settle personal scores, and just accusing someone of such a crime could lead to mob justice.\nJudges hesitate to take up such cases for fear of retribution, which leaves accused languishing in jail for years without cases being heard.\nBlasphemy is punishable by death in Pakistan. No one has been executed by the state for it, but numerous accused have been lynched by outraged mobs.\n(Reporting by Asif Shahzad in Islamabad, Ariba Shahid in Karachi and Mushtaq Ali in Peshawar; Editing by Peter Graff)\nShare © Reuters - 2024",

    "title": "Solana Faces Pressure Below $200, Targets $210",
    "text": "Solana (SOL) is facing significant resistance in its attempt to hold above the $200 mark. After briefly rising above this threshold, the price of SOL has dropped below $200, unable to reclaim its previous gains. This decline has fueled concerns that the cryptocurrency might test lower support levels in the coming hours.\nMarket observers are closely watching the $190 level, which is becoming increasingly critical. A drop below $190 could cause widespread fear, leading to further downward momentum and potentially breaching crucial support levels, especially near $188. The question now is whether SOL can maintain its current support or whether a more substantial drop is on the horizon.\nSolana’s Struggle to Maintain Momentum\nLooking at Solana’s daily chart, the technicals suggest that the token is in a bearish phase. The price has consistently formed lower highs and lower lows, indicating a market controlled by the bears. Although the bulls have made attempts to defend key support levels, including $195, their efforts have so far been insufficient to prevent further declines.\nOne important factor in this situation is the formation of a falling wedge pattern, which often signals a potential reversal or breakout. However, the current market dynamics do not support a strong bullish trend at the moment. After facing rejection from higher resistance levels, SOL’s price is expected to revisit lower support zones.\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicators support the bearish outlook. While the MACD has shown a reduction in selling pressure, the lack of strong buying interest means the price might struggle to sustain a rebound. A bearish crossover in the MACD further increases the likelihood of a continued downtrend.\nSolana’s Key Support Levels\nDespite the current downward pressure, Solana is expected to test key support zones around $190 and $188. These levels have historically acted as strong demand zones, prompting a rebound each time SOL has tested them. As the price approaches these levels, it could trigger increased buying activity, leading to a possible reversal.\nHowever, if the price falls below $190, it may signal more extensive selling and the potential for further declines. A drop beneath $188 could lead to significant bearish momentum, potentially pushing the price closer to $180. On the other hand, if Solana can hold above these support levels, it could provide an opportunity for a strong rebound.\nThe Bullish Scenario: A Potential Reversal to $210\nIn the event of a recovery, Solana’s price would need to break above the immediate resistance at $200 to pave the way for a move towards $210. If SOL can reclaim this level and hold above it, the market may become more bullish, signaling the possibility of further gains. A rise above $210 would neutralize the bearish sentiment and open the door for a new uptrend that could bring Solana closer to its yearly highs around $225.\nSolana’s future price trajectory remains uncertain, but it will largely depend on its ability to maintain support and avoid further declines. If it can establish a solid foundation above $190, Solana may experience a strong rebound, potentially leading to new highs in the months ahead.\nConclusion:\nSolana’s price is at a critical juncture, with the market sentiment leaning towards bearishness due to its struggle to hold above $200. If SOL fails to hold key support levels, a dip below $190 could trigger a deeper correction. However, strong historical support at lower levels could provide an opportunity for a rebound. Traders will need to closely monitor SOL’s price action in the coming days to determine whether the cryptocurrency can sustain its momentum or if it will continue to struggle in the face of broader market challenges.",

    "text": "The next Insidious movie is getting pushed back. Sony Pictures originally planned to release Insidious 6 in August 2025, but that’s no longer happening. Instead, it’s been delayed by a full year and is now set to hit theaters on August 21, 2026 .\nThis comes after Insidious: The Red Door became the highest-grossing movie in the franchise. The 2023 film was meant to wrap up the story, but after its massive success, a follow-up was given the green light. However, the delay means fans will have to wait longer to see what happens next.\nSony made this decision because another film, Caught Stealing , is taking its original release date. The new crime thriller, directed by Darren Aronofsky, stars Austin Butler, Zoë Kravitz, Regina King, and Liev Schreiber. The studio shifted Insidious 6 to make room for it.\nDetails about the next chapter remain a mystery. It’s unclear if Insidious 6 will focus on the Lambert family or explore other characters connected to The Further. The ending of The Red Door left things open with a post-credits tease, but no one knows exactly where the story will go.\nThere’s also the upcoming spinoff Thread: An Insidious Tale , featuring Mandy Moore and Kumail Nanjiani. That movie is separate from Insidious 6 but will still tie into The Further in some way.\nWhile it’s frustrating to wait, this delay could be a good thing. The Red Door gave the Lambert family a satisfying ending, and if they return, the story needs a strong reason that doesn’t undo that closure. With extra time, the writers can make sure Insidious 6 is worth it.\nHave something to add? Let us know in the comments below!",

    "title": "‘Every shift matters’: Ronnie Attard looking to make the most of Flyers call-up",
    "text": "John Tortorella left the decision to the coaching staff in Lehigh Valley and to Flyers president Keith Jones and general manager Danny Brière.\nThe coach wanted a defenseman called up, with Rasmus Ristolainen and Jamie Drysdale both out week-to-week with upper-body injuries and on injured reserve and with the first game of a back-to-back on the road Friday. So he tasked them with sending who they felt was the best choice.\nEnter Ronnie Attard.\n“Obviously hate to see guys get injured, but you only get so many chances,” Attard said. “Just got to make the best of every chance I get and set my best foot forward.”\nAdvertisement » READ MORE: Q&A: Flyers GM Danny Brière on the trade deadline, the promise of Matvei Michkov, and much more\nThe 24-year-old blueliner found out after Phantoms practice Wednesday that he had been tapped for a promotion. He made his way down for Flyers practice Thursday and was skating on a rotation with the six other defensemen. There are no guarantees that he gets ice time, but the Flyers do often like to suit up seven defensemen.\n“We’re always cognizant of trying to put players into a spot to succeed,” Tortorella said. “I think when you succeed, you’re going to go through the process of failing too. ... Does he play? How much does he play if he does play? I don’t know where that goes. That’s a call we’ll make.”\nAttard is no stranger to Tortorella or associate coach Brad Shaw. He spent a good chunk of the preseason with the Flyers, before being sent down on Oct. 4. The Michigan native played two games last season, averaging 16 minutes, 44 seconds of ice time. He played 15 games in 2021-22, notching two goals and two assists after his season at Western Michigan University ended.\n» READ MORE: Flyers’ Carter Hart, ex-teammates with Hockey Canada opt for a jury trial in sexual assault case\n“I played a little bit with him in training camp and got to know him,” Marc Staal said. “He’s a good defenseman. He’s smart, very poised with the puck.”\nSelf-described as a guy who likes “to shoot the puck a lot, likes to defend hard, and just tries to keep it simple,” Attard has 25 points (10 goals, 15 assists) in 46 games with Lehigh Valley this season. Last season, he posted 32 points in 68 games and was named to the AHL All-Star Game.\n“He’s a really big guy that skates well and has really good instincts all over the ice,” Cam York said. “He has a really high IQ, and we’re kind of banged up right now so it’s a great opportunity for him to be up here and show us what he has.\n“He’s a really good player. Great guy off the ice and a right-shot D-man, can do a lot of things for us,” York said.\nYork didn’t find out until he got to the Flyers Training Center in Voorhees that his former Phantoms teammate was called up. He thinks the 6-foot-3, 208-pound defender should fit in seamlessly as a right-shot with Drysdale out. And Attard, who is now sporting No. 23, is ready to showcase his game.\n“For me, it’s just a defending hard,” Attard said when asked about how he has elevated his game since December. “I gotta be miserable to play against, kill plays, move the pucks fast.\n“If I’m not killing plays, I get myself into trouble. So just got to continue to focus on that, not getting beat, and if there’s an opportunity to jump up and jump in the rush and try to make something happen.”\nA third-round pick in 2019 as an over-ager after getting passed over twice for the NHL draft, Attard knows this is a key time for him. He said on Thursday that he’s been working hard on building and growing his game. Back in October, his goal was to “just continue to put my head down and work and see where it takes me.”\nNow it’s gotten him back to the NHL. And while the Phantoms are themselves in a tight playoff race, Attard has been keeping an eye on the Flyers and is excited about the opportunity to participate in the NHL playoff push.\n“It’s awesome. It’s meaningful hockey and almost March now, so every game matters, every point matters, every shift matters,” he said. “So just gotta be ready to go.”\n» READ MORE: The power went out during the Flyers game Tuesday. Here’s how everyone reacted.\nBreakaways Goalie Cal Petersen cleared waivers and has been loaned to the Phantoms. “I just didn’t feel Cal was good enough the last game,” Tortorella said. Felix Sandström was recalled from Lehigh Valley and will back up Sam Ersson . There’s a good chance Sandström will start one of the two games the Flyers have over the next two days, Friday at the Washington Capitals (7 p.m., NBCSP) and Saturday against the Ottawa Senators at home (7 p.m., NBCSP). ... Cam Atkinson participated in practice but did not take line rushes, hinting that he could be a healthy scratch for a second straight game. “He’s going to wait his turn. And then, if I think it’s time for him to come back in, I hope he sticks,” Tortorella said.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement",
