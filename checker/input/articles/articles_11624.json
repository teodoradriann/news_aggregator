    "text": "COURCHEVEL, 30 GEN - Apparentemente un po' stanca e qualche errore di troppo nella manche decisiva e così la campionessa americana Mikaela Shiffrin ha chiuso solo in 10/a in 1.47.10 lo slalom speciale di cdm di Courchevel, la sua prima gara dopo l'incidente del 30 novembre scorso a Killington. \"E' stata una bella sfida ed ho fatto anche delle belle curve per cui mi sono divertita. Ma alla fine mi sentivo stanca\", aveva confessato Mikaela dopo la prima manche in cui aveva pur ottenuto un promettente quinto posto. Ha così vinto nettamente il settimo dei dieci slalom stagionali il giovane gran talento croato Zrinka Ljutic, 21 anni, terzo successo in carriera e tutti in questa stagione. Con lei sul podio la svedese Sara Hector in 1.46.32 e la tedesca Lena Duerr in 1.46.34. Miglior azzurra tra le quattro qualificatesi per la seconda manche (e questo era finalmente un segnale positivo in una disciplina da anni in crisi nera per i colori italiani) è stata ancora una volta la trentina Martina Peterlini: 15/a in 1.47.64. Migliora così il suo miglior risultato stagionale - questo dice tutto sul rendimento e sullo stato della squadra italiana - che era un 17/o posto. Ventesime ex aequo nella prima manche, sono invece finite fuori per errori l'altoatesina Vera Tschurtschenthaler e la bresciana Marta Rossetti che ha saltato una porta finendo lunga mentre stava facendo una splendida seconda prova. Così in classifica per l'Italia c'è poi ancora solo la friulana Lara Della Mea, 22/a in 1.48.26. Ora, mentre per gli uomini è ancora in programma la discesa di domenica a Garmisch-Partenkirchen, la coppa del mondo donne si ferma in vista dei Mondiali austriaci dI Saalbach dal 4 al 16 febbraio. Nel frattempo sono attese le convocazioni delle varie nazioni degli atleti che saranno impegnati nelle competizioni iridate. Il primo appuntamento a Saalbach sarà martedì 4 con la ormai consolidata gara a squadre mista: due uomini e due donne per ogni paese in un parallelo con porte da gigante ma usando sci più corti da slalom speciale..",

    "title": "Crucial T500 4TB SSD Review - World's Best Performing 4-Channel SSD",
    "text": "The Bottom Line Pros - Gaming performance - Capacity - User experience performance - Pricing Cons - None Should you buy it?AvoidConsiderShortlistBuy Introduction & Drive Details Almost a year ago, Crucial dropped its groundbreaking [T500 Series SSDs](https://www.tweaktown.com/reviews/10577/crucial-t500-gen4-ssd-2tb-when-4-channels-beats-8/index.html). What makes the T500 remarkable is that it is 4-channel controlled yet still capable of beating 99.9% of all 8-channel controlled PCIe Gen4 SSDs in terms of real-world performance or, as we call it, performance that matters. The lone exception is the 990 Pro, and then only if the 990 Pro is running in special full-power mode. The T500 is a bit different than any other SSD currently in circulation in that is 4-channel controlled with onboard DRAM. To date it is the only 4-channel, PCIe Gen4 x4 NVMe SSD to employ onboard DRAM to increase and sustain performance. Being 4-channel, the T500 series SSDs are more power efficient than their 8-channel counterparts. They run cool in comparison, and they tend to be more affordable. All major wins for the consumer as we see it. [Popular Now: Nintendo confirms when it will announce the Switch successor](https://www.tweaktown.com/news/101547/nintendo-confirms-when-it-will-announce-the-switch-successor/index.html) We see the T500 Series as the pinnacle of PCIe Gen4 solid-state storage, giving us the best overall performance/efficiency package in all of consumer DIY storage. Till now, there was only one wish that the T500 Series did not grant us - more, as in more capacity. Well today Crucial has granted us our wish with a 4TB capacity point T500. The 4TB T500 is spec'd as a little bit slower than the 2TB model at 7,000 MB/s throughput vs. 7,400 MB/s and 1,050K random read IOPS vs. 1,180K IOPS. However, as most of our readers know, neither of those performance metrics accurately indicates which SSD is more powerful. Throughput and superior real-world performance are many times independently variable, and the subject of today's review is the perfect example of this fact. Slightly slower throughput but more capacious and powerful than ever before is what the 4TB T500 is all about. Turns out that it is indeed the best performing 4-channel SSD we've ever encountered, even slightly more powerful than the Phison [E31T PCIe Gen5 x4 SSD](https://www.tweaktown.com/reviews/10855/phison-ps5031-e31t-ssd-controller-affordable-gen5-awesomeness/index.html) we recently tested. Impressive. Now, let's get into this review so we can show you what Crucial's T500 4TB SSD can do for you by the numbers.

Because Intel still delivers the best real-world storage performance, [(Look Here)](https://www.tweaktown.com/articles/10212/storage-showdown-intel-alder-lake-vs-amd-zen/index.html), our running chart will continue to be Intel-based until AMD can deliver better real-world storage performance than its rival. |Today||7 days ago||30 days ago| | |[Loading...]() [$309.99 USD](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RZrrn*9L87M&mid=44583&murl=https://www.newegg.com/p/N82E16820156410) [$309.99 USD](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=RZrrn*9L87M&mid=44583&murl=https://www.newegg.com/p/N82E16820156410) Sony PlayStation 5 - M.2 Storage Expansion PS5 Read Performance With Sony's wildly popular PlayStation 5 console now enabled for M.2 NVMe SSDs to be used as fast storage expansion, we are including results for PS5 compatible SSDs we test as a part of our reviews going forward. For SSDs that don't have an adequately sized PS5 compatible heatsink or other SSDs where the heatsink provided doesn't fit right and can be removed, we both use and recommend Sabrent's unparalleled PS5 heatsink available [HERE](https://www.amazon.com/SABRENT-Heatsink-PS5-Console-SB-PSHS/dp/B09HSQQWCL?tag=twea-20). We only chart SSDs that can deliver a minimum of 5,500 MB/s read, which is Sony's original recommendation. The result here of 6,559 MB/s is the best result of all-time. Impressive, and significantly better than the 2TB model. Like we said - more powerful in the real-world, even though it's spec'd as slower. Synthetic Benchmarks: CDM, Anvil, ATTO CrystalDiskMark We employ CDM as our standard measurement for sequential throughput and Q1T1 random read. In terms of sequential throughput, we find our test subject fully capable of exceeding quoted up to factory throughput specifications. Across the board, synthetically, a bit slower than the 2TB model. Anvil's Storage Utilities Again, it is a bit slower than the 2TB model in terms of synthetic performance. We employ Anvil's random read test as our standard for measuring max random read IOPS. This test is very accurate as it at its core is Iometer skinned over. We test at QD128. The drive is spec's for up to 1,050K IOPS here and we are getting 934K IOPS. Good enough considering our more demanding user state. Again, a bit slower than the 2TB model. ATTO ATTO gives us a clear picture of what transfer sizes a particular SSD favors in terms of QD4 sequential throughput. We chart 128K transfers. At a queue depth of four, T500 4TB favors sequential transfers of 64KB or larger when serving data to the host (reading) and 64KB or larger when programming (writing) data. This is epic small-file performance, overall, even better than its older and less capacious siblings. Real-World Testing: Transfers, 3DMark SSD Gaming Test, PCM10 Storage Transfer Rates Our 100GB data transfer test is not your ordinary 100GB of data, ours is a crushing mix composed of more than 62K files. Write performance random or sequential, is an infrequent operation and such, we do not consider it to be an important performance metric in the consumer space. An example being how many times is a game installed vs. how many times it's played. Unlike programming (writing) data, serving data to the host (reading) is typically an important performance metric as it relates to the consumer space. Here we find the 4TB model is roughly 10% slower than the 2TB model. 3DMark SSD Gaming Test UL's newest 3DMark SSD Gaming Test is the most comprehensive SSD gaming test ever devised. We consider it superior to testing against games themselves because, as a trace, it is much more consistent than variations that will occur between runs on the actual game itself. This test is the same as running the actual game, just without the inconsistencies inherent to application testing. In short, we believe that this is the world's best way to test an SSDs gaming prowess and accurately compare it against competing SSDs. The 3DMark SSD Gaming Test measures and scores the following: - Loading Battlefield V from launch to the main menu. - Loading Call of Duty Black Ops 4 from launch to the main menu. - Loading Overwatch from launch to the main menu. - Recording a 1080p gameplay video at 60 FPS with OBS (Open Broadcaster Software) while playing Overwatch. - Installing The Outer Worlds from the Epic Games Launcher. - Saving game progress in The Outer Worlds. - Copying the Steam folder for Counter-Strike Global Offensive from an external SSD to the system drive. Gaming is a performance metric that matters to most DIY consumers, especially for the enthusiast crowd that TweakTown caters to. Now we've reached the point where results start to matter as they are a direct reflection of user experience. The 4TB T500 is indeed the most powerful PCIe Gen4 x4 consumer SSD for gaming. The T500 4TB may be technically \"slower\" than its 2TB predecessor, but it is more powerful, and that is what matters most. Again, our 4-channel capacious contender even manages to outperform the PCIe Gen5 E31T and even more impressively beats the 990 Pro, where it arguably matters most. Outstanding. PCM10 Storage Tests PCMark 10 Storage Test is the most advanced and most accurate real-world consumer storage test ever made. There are four different tests you can choose from; we run two of them. The Full System Drive Benchmark and the Quick System Drive Benchmark. The Full System Drive Benchmark writes 204 GB of data over the duration of the test. These tests directly correlate with mainstream user experience. PCMark 10 Full System Drive Benchmark This test writes 204GB data and covers a broad range of common consumer tasks, including booting Windows 10, file transfers, Adobe and Office applications, and startup times for games including Battlefield V, COD Black Ops 4, and Overwatch. Unlike synthetic numbers, this is comprehensive real-world data which is why we use it to rank SSDs in terms of user experience. Within 10 points of the best we've ever recorded for a PCIe Gen4 SSD and doing so with half the channels. Again, it is more powerful than the 2TB model and, outperforming the E31T PCIe Gen5 SSD. Amazing. PCMark 10 Quick System Drive Benchmark The Quick System Drive Benchmark writes 23 GB of data over the duration of the test. Of all the benchmarks we run, it can be argued that this one offers the best reflection of a typical consumer use case scenario. Our 4TB contender just edges out its 2TB sibling for the second-best performance delivered by PCIe Gen4 series SSD. Final Thoughts Do you want the best real-world and gaming PCIe Gen4 storage performance? Crucial's 4TB stands ready to deliver and does so for a price that cannot be beaten. Additionally, with its huge capacity, power-efficient 4-channel controller, and blazing-fast read speed, it is the best SSD we've encountered for PS5. We rank SSDs in terms of overall user experience (performance where it matters most) as expressed by PCMark 10 storage and 3DMark gaming storage tests. Currently, we consider a user experience score of 15K or more to verify an SSD as a TweakTown Elite performer. Whether you are running on Intel or AMD, Crucial's T500 can deliver 15K TT elite performance. Wow, you don't see that every day. Whether you are on PC or a PS5 gamer, it's the best of its kind that we've ever encountered and as such is worthy of our highest award. Editor's Choice.",

    "text": "Giannis Antetokounmpo is always one to give insight answers to the media after games. The two-time MVP did again on Tuesday night following the Milwaukee Bucks' 123-85 win over the Charlotte Hornets . But he wasn't answering a question from the usual group of media members. It came from none other than Bucks fan favorite Brandon Jennings. Jennings, wearing a Bucks-themed shirt from his Tuff Crowd Collection , sat courtside for the game. As he always does when he's in town, he received a nice ovation from the home crowd. There's not too many former players more popular than Mr. Bucks in 6 . But Jennings, who once scored 55 points in a game , then made his way into the locker room for Antetokounmpo's postgame press conference at his locker. And he likely got the best answer out of him. Jennings' first stint with the Bucks ended just as Antetokounmpo joined the NBA. But the two got the opportunity to play together briefly at the end of the 2018 season when Jennings returned to the Bucks on a 10-day contract . Jennings asked him about his mindset going into his MVP seasons (2018-19 and 2019-20) and what advice he would give to younger players now as a veteran in the league and specifically as a father. Giannis Antetokounmpo motivated by Kobe Bryant's challenge to him on winning MVP Antetokounmpo, of course, went from unknown player from Greece when the Bucks drafted him in the first round in 2013 to a two-time MVP, NBA Finals MVP, an NBA champion and one of the game's best ever. Antetokounmpo gave an over three-minute answer to Jennings about his personal journey in how the late Kobe Bryant inspired him , not listening to outside noise and his approach on self-improvement. Antetokounmpo first told the story about how Bryant once told him to go chase greatness and capture an MVP. \"That was in the back of my mind,\" Antetokounmpo recalled about pursuing his first one. Antetokounmpo would eventually train with Bryant and would soon win his first MVP in 2018-19 . \"I was just happy that I was in that conversation,\" Antetokounmpo acknowledged, while adding about his humble beginnings. \"I came from nothing. I came into the league, they told me I should go to the G League, I was too skinny, I couldn't handle it. I should go back to Greece.\" Antetokounmpo continued: \"Five or six years later Kobe giving me a challenge. I’m in the (MVP) conversation. I’m just going to go hard. I have nothing to lose. God blessed me with one (MVP). When you get that feeling you start craving more.\" He won his second MVP the following year but he said his focus was also on making the team better. He and the Bucks, of course, would win the 2021 NBA championship . \"Now I’m here,\" he said. \"I can’t get bored with doing the simple stuff. I was able to win a second one. Since then, I’ve always been in the conversation.\" Giannis Antetokounmpo shares wisdom for younger generation about expectations All of this success and personal growth leads Antetokounmpo back to Jennings' original question about what kids can learn from him. Don't let success or failure suffocate you, Antetokounmpo's message would be. \"I don’t want that to consume me,\" he said about the MVPs. \"It's a lot. For every hooper out there, just play the game the right way. This new generation they go on social media and see all this stuff how people talk about them. Good or bad, that's not reality. \"When I go drop my kids off at school they don't tell me (about my free throws). If I go on social media, they make me feel like I'm trash, good or bad. When they talk good about you, you’re not that good; when they talk bad about you, you’re not that bad. If you stay on course, good things are going to happen.\"",

    "text": "Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr. on Friday vowed that his administration is focused on eradicating criminality, specifically the operations of illegal Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators (POGOs).\nMarcos made the commitment during the distribution of presidential aid to farmers and fisherfolk in Pampanga.\n\"Alam ko rin po, na labis ang inyong [pagkabahala] sa mga kriminalidad at ilegal na mga gawain na sumisira sa kapayapaan ng inyong pamayanan. Nais ko pong ipaalam sa inyo na amin pong tinututukan at tinutugunan ang problemang ito,\" Marcos said in his speech.\n(I am aware that you are deeply concerned about criminality and the illegal activities that are destroying the peace and order of your community. I want to let you know that we are focused on and addressing this problem.)\n\"Sa katunayan, mayroon [nang] ginawang task force [ang] DILG para tutukan ang mga ilegal na gawaing kaugnay ng mga naririnig nating mga POGO at patuloy din ang pakikipagtulungan ng Bureau of Customs sa ilang ahensya upang matigil [na] ang pagpupuslit [ng] ilegal na droga dito sa bansa,\" he added.\n(In fact, the DILG has formed a task force on illegal activities regarding the POGOs that we have been hearing. The Bureau of Customs is also working with other agencies to stop illegal drugs from entering the country.)\nTo recall, a POGO firm in Porac, Pampanga is being investigated for alleged illegal activities linked to Chinese syndicates. More than 150 foreigners were rescued including Chinese, Malaysian, Burmese, and Vietnamese citizens. Some of those who were rescued were torture and kidnap victims.\nThe continued search on the POGO hub also led to the discovery of alleged uniforms of the Chinese military . Several butcher knives were recovered during the search of the compound. Authorities also seized packages allegedly containing shabu during the operated raids.\nAuthorities have also raided a POGO hub in Bamban, Tarlac which was allegedly used for illegal activities by scammers. Suspended Bamban Mayor Alice Guo is currently under investigation for alleged links to POGO activities in her town.\nSeeking to crack down on the personalities behind the Bamban POGO, authorities have recently raided villas at a leisure park in Mabalacat, Pampanga .\nFinance Secretary Ralph Recto earlier said he sent a letter to Marcos recommending the total ban of POGO operations in the country. The President has not made any decision yet on the matter.\nMeanwhile, Marcos also said the country's anti-narcotics agency would continue its operations against illegal drugs.\n\"Patuloy din po ang mga hakbangin ng PDEA upang masawata ang ilegal na droga,\" Marcos said. — VDV, GMA Integrated News",

    "text": "KINGSVILLE, Tx — The Salvation Army of Kingsville and King's Way Family Church are giving the Kingsville community some options to stay warm during the Arctic blast. They're providing heaters, warm clothing, food and a place to stay. But to keep on giving, the Salvation Army is encouraging those who can help to donate. Kingsville City Commissioner Edna Lopez spent her morning donating heaters to those who came in. She said as soon as she heard the update on the freezing weather, she decided to help. She couldn't find any heaters in stores, so she took her shopping online. \"Kingsville's been good to me and I just wanted to help out and donate, so I bought close to 50 heaters,\" Lopez said. Those heaters came as fast as they went. Recipients have to meet specific qualifications to get a heater and each family gets one. \"We've been getting calls all day, especially for the heaters,\" Director of the Salvation Army of Kingsville Steve Martinez said. \"There’s some people who don't have central air heat or much of their house is cold and they’re trying to stay warm, so please don’t come and get one if you have proper heating. Please save it for someone who really needs it.\" For those who cannot get a heater or do not meet the qualifications, there are still more options to stay warm. The Salvation Army and King's Way Family Church are offering an all-day and all-night shelter, along with food and shower access. The organization has helped people like Gerardo Perez, who found himself wondering where he would have slept if it wasn't for the shelter. \"I may be out there still laying down. I just need help for me to stay somewhere and they said it would be cold a lot. I have my own blankets and my pillow,\" Perez said. And in a time of cold, it's warmth from the heart that keeps the community together. \"We’re one, we're all in this together as people are coming in and picking stuff up, people are also giving back so its been a real blessing,\" Martinez said. For those interested in donating, clothing items, food, and heaters can be dropped off at the King's Way Family Church office until 5 p.m. and inside the yellow bus at any hour of the day or night. The shelter will stay open until Tuesday night, possibly Wednesday if needed. For any questions, contact Martinez at 956-292-5129.

    "text": "On Oscar eve, Oppenheimer stars and physicist's descendants call for nuclear disarmament Hollywood stars, including Julianne Moore, Jane Fonda and Emma Thompson, as well as the grandson of the \"father of the atomic bomb\" Robert Oppenheimer, called on world leaders to disarm The Guardian [writes](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/mar/06/hollywood-nuclear-disarmament-letter-oppenheimer) about it. As Christopher Nolan's biopic Oppenheimer, about the physicist who created the atomic bomb, has the most nominations for the Oscars, which will be awarded on March 10, a coalition of actors and activists signed an open letter telling people about the current nuclear danger around the world. In the letter, the signatories remind that nine countries keep 13,000 nuclear weapons, which are about 80 times more powerful than those that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. \"As artists and advocates, we want to raise our voices to remind people that while Oppenheimer is history, nuclear weapons are not,” the letter reads. “At a time of great uncertainty, even one nuclear weapon – on land, under the sea, in the air, or in space – is too many. To protect our families, our communities, and our world, we must demand that global leaders work to make nuclear weapons history – and build a brighter future,\" the letter reads. Robert Oppenheimer’s grandson Charles has also added his name to the letter along with some stars from the film, including Tony Goldwyn and Matthew Modine. Other names include Michael Douglas, Ellen Burstyn, Alan Cumming, Bill Nye, Christoph Waltz, Lily Tomlin, Viggo Mortensen and Annie Lennox. It’s part of a new campaign called Makes Nukes History, launched by the Nuclear Threat Initiative, which also includes a billboard campaign and art installation. For reference. Oppenheimer is a biographical film by Christopher Nolan about the American theoretical physicist Robert Oppenheimer, who is called the \"father of the atomic bomb\" because he was the scientific director of the Manhattan Project, a World War II initiative that developed the first nuclear weapons. The film, co-produced by the United Kingdom and the United States, is based on the book American Prometheus, a Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin. The film premiered in Ukraine on July 20. Oppenheimer became the highest-grossing biopic of all time, grossing a record $912.7 million during its release. Oppenheimer won the Critics Choice Awards 2024. The film also won the top prize at the 30th SAG Awards. The film has received 13 nominations for the Oscars 2024, including in the main category \"Best Picture\".
