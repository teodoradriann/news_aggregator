    "title": "Majority of Americans are future-proofing their homes against severe weather",
    "text": "A new study has identified a growing concern compelling American homeowners to take action for their homes and families: over the next five years, a third of Americans believe severe weather events will leave their homes without power more often. The poll of 2,000 US homeowners found three in four have made improvements to their homes to address severe weather concerns, 73% of whom made modifications proactively to prevent future damage to the home. Homeowners stated they’re the most concerned about tornadoes (44%), hurricanes (30%) and thunder and lightning storms (30%), and that their top concerns as a result of severe weather are structural damage to their home (65%), power loss (58%), and the health and safety of their family/friends (57%). Sixty-four percent were concerned about power loss in their home — so much so that 59% would prioritize buying a portable power supply over other essentials like extra food (54%) and water (53%). ðŸ“¡ << Broadcast-ready version of this research story >> ðŸ“¡ To address concerns about their homes, the survey, commissioned by Generac and conducted by OnePoll, found homeowners implemented improvements including repairing or replacing the roof (34%), getting a power generator (32%) and improving the drainage system (24%). If they were to lose power today, nearly half (45%) said that compared to options like relying on an existing backup power source they already have at home (27%) or depending on a home solar system (7%), they would be stuck simply waiting for the utility to restore power. Over one in four (29%) said they “don’t feel confident” their local power provider can keep the power going during severe weather events. “As evolving climate patterns cause more extreme weather events, homeowners are assessing how power loss may affect their homes, and how they can plan ahead before it does,” said Kyle Raabe, president of Consumer Power for Generac Power Systems. “Millions of Americans are left in stressful, potentially dangerous situations amidst severe weather while they wait for power to be restored. No one should ever have to feel powerless at home.” The new data indicated homeowners’ concerns while simultaneously demonstrating a knowledge gap in home power. Half reported they understand how their home is powered only somewhat, a little, or not at all. The survey also looked into the awareness Americans have and lack when it comes to energy use habits and how electricity works within their home. Only 32% somewhat understand how their home consumes electricity, while 30% somewhat understand how their home is powered and 28% somewhat understand how their home is connected to the larger electrical grid. Only two in five (45%) believe their homes need the most power in the evenings, from 6 p.m. to midnight. Likewise, 34% believe their homes consume more than the standard average of 886kWh per month. However, the lack of knowledge isn’t for naught: many respondents monitor and attempt to manage energy consumption within their homes. They do so by checking their energy provider’s statement on a regular basis (50%), estimating energy use based on personal observations (29%), or by using smart energy devices (28%). TOP 9 CONCERNS AMERICANS HAVE OVER SEVERE WEATHER Structural damage to the home - 65%Losing power/electricity in the home - 58%The health and safety of family/friends - 57%Their own health and safety - 49%Damage to personal belongings - 40%Damage to their vehicle - 36%Their pet(s) experiencing discomfort or danger - 32%The home flooding - 31%Mold growth - 23% Survey methodology: This random double-opt-in survey of 2,000 American homeowners was commissioned by Generac between October 11 and October 16, 2023. It was conducted by market research company OnePoll , whose team members are members of the Market Research Society and have corporate membership to the American Association for Public Opinion Research ( AAPOR ) and the European Society for Opinion and Marketing Research ( ESOMAR ).

    "text": "Pope Francis certainly\nruffled the feathers of many, especially those in the Protestant sphere of faith, in his interview with CBS news magazine “60 Minutes,” making some rather suspect comments about the goodness of humanity.\nThe quotes implied that humanity in itself is good, leading many to ask him on social media why then did Jesus have to die on the cross?\n“We are all fundamentally good. Yes, there are some rogues and sinners, but the heart itself is good,” says Pope Francis.\nWell, this sentiment doesn’t exactly line up with the words of Paul (among others), which are written down in the holy Bible, which is the inerrant Word of God.\nBreaking News. Spirit-Filled Stories. Subscribe to Charisma on YouTube now!\nPaul often discusses the “sin nature” of man, as we are born into a sin-cursed world and that the only way we become “good” as the Pope refers to, is through the blood of Jesus Christ, and the only way to live a “good” life is with the empowerment of the Holy Spirit within us.\nEven the Old Testament prophet Jeremiah\naddressed issues with the heart and in turn humanity itself saying:\n“The heart is more deceitful than all things and desperately wicked; who can understand it?” in Jeremiah 17:9.\nThis is far from the only topic the Pope addressed, and is certainly not the only item on the agenda he has raised eyebrows about.\nAddressing the widening schism between conservative Catholics and the Vatican, he addressed the outrage that ensued when he removed conservative bishop Joseph Strickland of Tyler, Texas, from his position after publicly feuding with the Pope, and even went so far as to say he was undermining the Catholic faith with his words and actions.\nNo love appears to have been lost between the two sides, as Pope Francis claims that conservative bishops hold a “suicidal attitude.”\nGet your FREE CHARISMA NEWSLETTERS today! Stay up-to-date with current issues, Holy Spirit news, Christian teachings, Charisma videos & more!\n“Conservative is one who clings to something and does not want to see beyond that. It is a suicidal attitude,” says Pope Francis.\n“Because one thing is to take tradition into account, to consider situations from the past, but quite another is to be closed up inside a dogmatic box,” he continued.\nJoin Charisma Magazine Online to follow everything the Holy Spirit is doing around the world!\nJames Lasher is Staff Writer for Charisma Media.",

Le mercure ne va pas remonter ce vendredi 13 décembre, bien au contraire.

Du Grand Est au Centre, ainsi que sur les Hauts-de-France et la Bretagne, les gelées sont quasi généralisées.\nLes relevés à 7 heures de Météo-France montrent cette fraîcheur qui persiste, avec 2°C à Brest, Cherbourg et Tours, 3°C à Paris, 1°C à Lyon, Nantes et Strasbourg, 3°C à Rennes et Limoges. Il fait particulièrement froid ce matin à Clermont-Ferrand avec -3°C relevés, Nancy (-2°C) et Dijon (-1°C).

    "title": "'Nightmare for women': Trump ignores own legal woes with latest attack on Biden",
    "text": "Donald\nTrump previewed one of his likely attacks on President Joe Biden with a vicious smear against immigrants.\nThe former president has made his opposition to immigration the cornerstone of his political rise, and has highlighted several unrelated homicides allegedly carried out by undocumented migrants to blame Biden for the slayings — which he's\nexpected to do in Thursday's presidential debate.\n\"Biden’s policies are a NIGHTMARE FOR WOMEN when it comes to the Border and Immigration!\" Trump\nposted hours before the debate is scheduled to begin.\nThe former president, who has been found liable for sexual abuse and boasted in a recorded conversation that he gets away with molesting women, launched his first presidential campaign by slandering Mexican immigrants as rapists.\n\"The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else's problems,\"\nTrump said in his first campaign speech nine years ago. \"Thank you. It's true, and these are the best and the finest. When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you. They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime. They're rapists, and some, I assume, are good people.\"\nALSO READ:\nWhat Donald Trump's weird WWE Hall of Fame speech tells us about his debate strategy\nTrump was penalized earlier this year by $88.3 million after a jury found him\nliable for sexually abusing author E. Jean Carroll and then defaming her, and a judge in another case found him liable for fraud and penalized him $355 million for habitually lying about his wealth on financial statements he used to secure loans and make deals.\n“The finding that Ms. Carroll failed to prove that she was ‘raped’ within the meaning of the New York Penal Law does not mean that she failed to prove that Mr. Trump ‘raped’ her as many people commonly understand the word ‘rape,’\"\nwrote judge Lewis Kaplan after the jury's verdict. \"Indeed, as the evidence at trial recounted below makes clear, the jury found that Mr. Trump in fact did exactly that.”\nThe presumptive Republican nominee was found guilty last month on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to hide hush money payments to an adult film actress to prevent voters from learning of their affair, in an apparent violation of campaign finance laws.\nTrump's comments to former \"Access Hollywood\" host Billy Bush about grabbing women by the genitals were used as evidence in both the Carroll trial and his criminal trial.\nHe has also been indicted on felony charges in two federal cases involving his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss and his mishandling of classified documents, and he also faces felony charges in a Georgia racketeering case related to his post-election activity.",

    "title": "Embrace the Cold for Winter Adventure",
    "text": "Embrace the Cold for Winter Adventure\nAt the risk of being unpopular, I hope that by the time you are reading this story there is a formidable layer of snow pack on the ground and we are living in a certifiable winter wonderland.\nYes, not everyone loves the snow like I do (I am originally from the frozen tundra of Wisconsin, after all), but I feel sometimes that is just because people are afraid to go out in it. I think that if some folks bundled up and got out into the cold, they might realize that playing in the snow can make you feel like a kid again.\nRemember those days, building snowmen, sled riding, and coming home to hot cocoa? Well, I am telling you, no matter your age, those kinds of memories can be made again, because central Pennsylvania offers plenty of opportunity for winter adventures.\nFrom hiking to skiing to skating and more, you don’t want to miss out on all of the wintery fun that is out there. After all, what is the point of living somewhere that is cold (usually) at least three months of the year if we don’t embrace it, right?\nLet’s explore some of the opportunities available in Centre County:\nHitting the Trails\nThe trails are open year round for hiking and more, so don’t be afraid to use them, even in the cold. Always dress in layers, and, especially if you are new to winter excursions, go out with a buddy. Starting out, stick to well-known trails. Rothrock State Forest, Scotia, and Black Moshannon State Park offer plenty of options, as do other locations in the area.\nI am mostly a hiker, but I am always amazed when I see mountain bikers out on the snow-covered trails (fat tires are a must).\nSkis and snowshoes are another good option, and state parks often have rentals available for those looking to give it a whirl.\nSome winter trail tips:\n- Hike with a friend.\n- Stick to trails you know when starting out.\n- Beware of driving on snow-covered forest roads; the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources does not plow.\n- Traction devices are a must on steep and icy trails.\n- Don’t post hole (letting your legs sink deep in the snow with every step) on dedicated cross-country ski trails.\n- It gets dark early, so bring a light.\nSlide Down the Slopes of Tussey\nOf course, the first thing people around these parts think of when they think of outdoor winter activities is Tussey Mountain Resort. Centre County’s home slope is a great place to learn to ski and snowboard, and it is right in the Centre Region’s backyard.\nFirst-timers should consider a lesson and lots of practice on the bunny hill, because even though Tussey slopes are not that high compared to some others, they are steep. One thing for sure is that getting off the lift on top of the mountain and looking down at Happy Valley below is awesome (and maybe a little scary to newbies, like me).\nAnd if skiing and snowboarding aren’t for you, snow tubing is a less upright way to make your way down the slopes.\nDon’t forget to grab a warm (or cold) beverage in the lodge at the end of the day.\nSledding\nSome of my favorite memories from when my son was little were winter days spent at Slab Cabin Park, with a hot coffee in one hand and a sled in the other. When the snow falls, the sled hill is a favorite Centre Region spot that you don’t want to miss, with a fun atmosphere and a great hill.\nBald Eagle State Park also has a great sledding hill that is usually a little less busy, but just as much fun. All you have to do is bundle up and brave the climb back up the hill for more.\nSnowmobiling\nI have never used a snowmobile in my life, but boy do they look like fun, with the snow blowing behind you as you speed ahead. Along with dedicated snowmobile trails, many state forest roads are open to snowmobilers (check\nDCNR for open dates) as long as there is enough snow. There are groups dedicated to snowmobiling in different areas of the county, such as the Black Mo Snowmobile Club, that are good resources for those looking to get into this winter activity.\nIce Skating\nFrom community skating rinks in Bellefonte, Howard, and Boalsburg to our many state parks and indoors at Pegula Ice Arena, the ice skating options in Centre County are many.\nLet’s hope the weather cooperates this season for some outdoor skating, but in the meantime, Pegula is the perfect place to practice.\nFun in the Snow at Black Mo\nEvery year, Black Moshannon State Park offers a celebration of winter activities called\nFun in the Snow at Black Mo. The January 27 event is an opportunity to try ice skating, cross-country skiing, broomball, ice mini golf, curling, sledding, and snowshoeing. It is a fun time for the whole family. If there is no snow on the ground on the 27th, the makeup date is February 10. T&G\nVincent Corso loves exploring the outdoors in central Pennsylvania and beyond.",

    "text": "Lusa 24 out 2024 22:33 Atualidade Partilhar Partilhar Partilhar Partilhar Partilhar Mondlane rejeita \"resultados adulterados\" que não refletem vontade do povo O candidato presidencial Venâncio Mondlane rejeitou hoje \"de forma liminar\" os resultados das eleições gerais moçambicanas, que atribuem à Frelimo e ao seu candidato, Daniel Chapo, a vitória, considerando que \"não refletem a vontade do povo\".\n\"Nós rejeitamos de forma liminar, de forma taxativa, estes resultados. São resultados tremendamente e absurdamente falsos, adulterados, mentirosos. Não são resultados que refletem a vontade do povo\", afirmou num vídeo divulgado na rede social Facebook.\nA Comissão Nacional de Eleições (CNE) moçambicana anunciou hoje a vitória de Daniel Chapo (Frelimo) na eleição a Presidente da República de 09 de outubro, com 70,67% dos votos, resultados que ainda carecem da validação do Conselho Constitucional.\nSegundo os resultados do apuramento geral das eleições de 09 de outubro, anunciados pelo presidente da CNE, Carlos Matsinhe, em Maputo, Daniel Chapo, candidato apoiado pela Frente de Libertação de Moçambique (Frelimo, no poder), venceu com mais de 50% dos votos em todos os círculos eleitorais do país, somando no total 4.912.762 votos.\nVenâncio Mondlane, apoiado pelo Partido Optimista para o Desenvolvimento de Moçambique (Podemos, extraparlamentar), ficou em segundo lugar, com 20,32%, totalizando 1.412.517 votos.\nA declaração de Venâncio Mondlane foi feita em \"local incerto\", como o próprio afirmou, justificando com o que acusa de ser \"um plano dos esquadrões da morte da Frelimo\" para o matarem.\nMondlane desafiou a CNE e a Frelimo a provarem os resultados que dão a vitória a Chapo e ao partido no poder desde a independência, para o que deverão apresentar provas, neste caso, os editais das assembleias de voto.\nRelativamente às manifestações de rua, Mondlane criticou as forças de defesa e segurança, acusando-as de estarem a usar balas verdadeiras para reprimir os populares que contestam a vitória da Frelimo e apelou aos oficiais subalternos que detenham os comandantes, que lhes transmitem as ordens para disparar contra o povo.\n\"Não aceitem ordens dos vossos comandantes. São orientações ilegais e criminosas\", frisou, evocando o que aconteceu em Portugal na revolução do 25 de Abril de 1974, quando oficiais subalternos derrubaram o regime colonial português.\nReferindo que as manifestações são um direito previsto na Constituição moçambicana, Venâncio Mondlane apelou à continuação dos protestos, que pediu para serem pacíficos e garantiu que na sexta-feira a contestação será maior.\n\"Vamos intensificar cada vez mais. Amanhã (sexta-feira) vamos intensificar cada vez mais. Os bairros que não saíram hoje, vamos sair todos. Vamos para a rua, em todos os distritos, em todas as capitais provinciais\", defendeu, referindo que na próxima semana poderá começar a terceira de quatro fases que prometeu de protestos até à proclamação dos resultados pelo Conselho Constitucional.\nMondlane referiu que a Frelimo \"continua a usar a força para se manter no poder. Usa as forças de defesa e segurança, que disparam balas verdadeiras e estão a matar moçambicanos\".\nO candidato citou, a concluir, Afonso Dhlakama, líder histórico da Resistência Nacional Moçambicana (Renamo), principal movimento de resistência ao poder da Frelimo e que durante 16 anos protagonizou uma guerra civil contra o regime.\n\"A revolução já chegou. A hora já chegou\", vincou.\nO anúncio dos resultados feito hoje pela CNE acontece no primeiro de dois dias de greve geral e manifestações em todo o país convocadas por Mondlane contra o processo eleitoral deste ano, que está a ser marcado por confrontos entre manifestantes e a polícia nas principais avenidas da capital moçambicana.\nEL // VM\nLusa/Fim\n Partilhar Partilhar Partilhar Partilhar Partilhar Em destaque <article class=\"article no-related-articles tiny-hide-media-helper small-hide-media-helper medium-overlaid-details large-overlaid-details xlarge-overlaid-details medium-two-by-one large-two-by-one xlarge-two-by-one category-- article-type- \" \">\nViolência nos bairros: o Governo deve “aplicar” medidas nos próximos dias, diz Marcelo",

    "title": "Electra.aero and Surf Air Mobility Will Operate and Lease Hybrid-Electric Aircraft - FLYING Magazine",
    "text": "Green regional air mobility provider Surf Air Mobility is joining forces with Electra.aero, the manufacturer of a nine-seat, hybrid-electric short takeoff and landing (eSTOL) design. A bilateral agreement between the two firms announced Thursday seeks to bring Electra’s eSTOL to market by leveraging Surf Air’s on-demand air mobility platform and Aircraft-as-a-Service (ACaaS) leasing program for operators. Surf Air also secured preferred delivery positions for 90 Electra aircraft. The manufacturer’s eSTOL design uses a distinctive blown-lift propulsion system. According to Electra, this allows the aircraft to take off at “neighborhood driving speeds,” reducing its runway requirement to just 150 feet. The unique ability will open direct air travel beyond large airports to include small regional airfields and even advanced air mobility (AAM) infrastructure such as vertiports, the company said. The goal is to serve more regional transportation customers than private aviation does currently. The eSTOL further stands out for its ability to recharge during flight, using a small turbogenerator running on hybrid-electric power to juice up its batteries. The use of hybrid-electric fuel also reduces emissions (by 30 percent) and noise (75 dBA at 300 feet, equivalent to a vacuum cleaner) below those of traditional airplane or rotorcraft, while improving range and payload, Electra said. “Electra stands out as one of the early market leaders in regional air mobility [RAM], and we’re excited to bring them onto our platform,” said Stan Little, CEO of Surf Air. “Their innovations around hybrid-electric, short takeoff and landing aircraft—which can essentially take off and land on a football field-sized space—will unlock tremendous opportunities within the changing landscape of regional air mobility.” Electra’s nine-seat design is the third green vehicle planned for Surf Air’s platform. It will join the company’s electrified Cessna 208B Grand Caravan—retrofit with its proprietary powertrain system—and Regent Craft’s electric seaglider. Surf Air hopes to introduce “affordable, sustainable, and easily accessible” trips across its national flight network, which includes Southern Airways Express and Mokulele Airlines. Together with Electra, it will explore fleetwide data analytics services, create routes for the eSTOL within its network, provide real-time aircraft information, and develop predictive analytics systems. That last component, Electra said, is expected to reduce operating costs and streamline operations. “As the country’s largest commuter airline, Surf Air is at the forefront of addressing the growing demand for cleaner, more affordable, and convenient travel options,” said John Langford, founder and CEO of Electra. “Electra is pleased to partner with Surf Air in spearheading the decarbonization of regional business aviation through the integration of our eSTOL aircraft into their fleet.” Electra and Surf Air will further develop a leasing agreement, which would make the latter the preferred lessor and provider of Electra eSTOL aircraft to Surf Air customers. Surf Air already has a leasing program in place called Aircraft-as-a-Service, or ACaaS. But according to the company, regional Part 135 operators lack the access to aircraft funding options and software services that large commercial air carriers enjoy. ACaaS attempts to solve this problem by providing financing and software tools, lowering barriers to entry for smaller operators. Through ACaaS, smaller providers will soon get the opportunity to expand their regional transport networks with eSTOL aircraft. “With billions of dollars being invested into the regional and advanced air mobility space, it’s becoming increasingly important for a solution that can on-ramp new technologies and get them into the hands of operators as quickly and safely as possible,” said Jamie Strecker, vice president of business development for Surf Air. “Through our air mobility platform and our ACaaS program, we believe we can accelerate Electra’s eSTOL aircraft time to market.” Simultaneously, Surf Air continues to develop electrified powertrain technology for the Cessna Grand Caravan through an [exclusive relationship](https://www.flyingmag.com/surf-air-mobility-to-purchase-cessna-grand-caravan-exs/) with Textron Aviation. It has [agreed](https://www.flyingmag.com/electric-regional-aircraft-firm-inks-deal-for-20-cessna-grand-caravan-exs/) to purchase as many as 170 Cessna models from the manufacturer. The company intends to use its on-demand platform to bring the electrified Caravan to market on a global scale. It said the introduction of the hybrid-electric model will demonstrate what its technology could do for other manufacturers. Surf Air also sells its proprietary [electric powertrains](https://www.flyingmag.com/surf-air-mobility-inks-450-million-deal-with-jetstream-aviation-capital/) to operators. Its most recent [electrification deal](https://www.flyingmag.com/surf-air-mobility-signs-aircraft-electrification-deals-with-2-kenyan-operators/) came from Kenyan operators Safarilink and Yellow Wings last month. Electra, meanwhile, last month [surpassed 2,000 preorder sales](https://www.flyingmag.com/electra-aero-surpasses-2000-orders-for-hybrid-electric-aircraft/) for its flagship model following a [massive deal](https://www.flyingmag.com/regional-air-carrier-jsx-to-purchase-more-than-330-hybrid-electric-aircraft/) with regional air carrier JSX, as well as a few smaller agreements. In November, the company completed what it said was the [“world’s first” flight](https://www.flyingmag.com/electra-completes-worlds-first-flight-of-hybrid-electric-stol-design/) of a hybrid eSTOL design, using its [EL-2 Goldfinch demonstrator](https://www.flyingmag.com/electra-aero-unveils-hybrid-electric-stol-demonstrator/). The jaunt lasted 23 minutes, reached 3,200 feet in altitude, and covered approximately 30 miles. Like this story?
