    "text": "Thousands of homes remain without power as the post-storm cleanup begins in the wake of Storm Gerrit. Around 1,500 homes in Scotland experienced their second night without power in Scotland while a lightning strike hit supplies in Wales on Thursday. Power company Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks said it had restored supply to more than 46,000 properties that lost power due to the storm, with people in the north east and Shetland worst affected. They said the remaining homes should be reconnected on Friday with welfare vans serving hot food and drink to affected customers from 9am. Operations director Andy Smith said: “This has been a difficult couple of days for the communities affected and I’m grateful to them for their patience and support as our teams work extremely hard to restore power.” National Grid UK said 36,000 properties were without power in Ceredigion on Thursday after lightning struck. Three men died after their 4×4 vehicle was submerged in the River Esk, near Glaisdale, on Thursday, North Yorkshire Police said. A supercell thunderstorm moved across the northwest of England on Thursday after a similar storm is thought to have resulted in a tornado that damaged homes in Greater Manchester on Wednesday. Around 100 properties were damaged by what police called a “localised tornado” in Stalybridge, Tameside and in the badly-hit village of Carrbrook. Hayley McCaffer, 40, who lives in Carrbrook, told the PA news agency that some of her neighbours’ houses “are an absolute disaster” with missing roofs and “squished” cars. Damage will be covered by standard property insurance policies, the Association of British Insurers has said. ScotRail said many lines have been reopened but urged passengers to check for the latest information before travelling, a message echoed by LNER, Avanti West Coast and London Northwestern Railway who suspensed or cancelled services due to damage or system faults. Friday will see significant disruption for travellers wishing to travel on the London Euston and Watford Junction lines with services expected to be up and running by the end of the day. In Wales, the aftermath of the recent severe weather will see rail services hampered until Monday. Ferry services also experienced cancellations and delays due to storm activity with operator DFDS confirming sailings between Dover and France were delayed due to strong winds in the English Channel. Air travel in and out of the UK saw cancellations but most services have returned to normal. The Met Office reported the worst of Storm Gerrit had passed with the last few days of 2023 forecast to be unsettled with strong winds, rain and even snow on higher ground. Met Office chief forecaster Steven Ramsdale said: “Heavy rain will spread across all but the far north on Saturday, affecting similar areas previously affected by Storm Gerrit. However, this rainfall will be a step down from that seen during Storm Gerrit.”",

    "text": "Schlösser in Baden-Württemberg: Hier wurden 2 berühmte Märchenfilme gedreht\nZwei Filme und vier Schlösser: „Der Froschkönig“ und „Der Teufel mit den drei goldenen Haaren“ wurden in Schlössern Baden-Württembergs gedreht.\nDas barocke Lustschloss Favorite in Rastatt war 2008 der Hauptdrehort für die ARD-Verfilmung des Grimmschen Märchens „Der Froschkönig“. Der jungen Prinzessin Sophie fällt in dem Film ihre goldene Kugel deshalb auch nicht in einen Brunnen, sondern in den Teich vor Schloss Favorite.\nDreh von „Der Froschkönig“ auf Schloss Rastatt\nDie ehemalige Residenz des Markgraf von Baden, das Schloss Rastatt, diente für weitere Szenen als Kulisse. Es handelt sich dabei um eine imposante barocke Dreiflügelanlage. Die inneren Gemächer sind pompös verziert. Dabei ist die hölzerne Bodenornamentik besonders beeindruckend. Auch die wohl berühmteste Schlossruine der Welt befindet sich in Baden-Württemberg.\nDie Auswahl der Stadt Rastatt als Drehort war besonders geschickt. Als barocke Residenzstadt der Markgrafschaft Baden-Baden beherbergt sie viele stattliche Bauten mit weitläufigen Gartenanlagen. Mit dem Residenzschloss Rastatt und dem Lustschloss Favorite entschied sich die ARD für zwei Gebäude in unweitem Abstand voneinander.\n„Der Teufel mit den drei goldenen Haaren“ auf Burg Teck und Schloss Ehrenfels\n„Der Teufel mit den drei goldenen Haaren“ ist ebenfalls ein Märchen der Gebrüder Grimm. Es erzählt von einem Jungen, der als Glückskind gilt. Die Prophezeiung, er werde die Königstochter heiraten, führt dazu, dass der König versucht, ihn zu töten. Deshalb schickt der König ihn schließlich zum Teufel, dem er drei goldene Haare stehlen soll. Der Junge überlebt diese Herausforderung und heiratet die Prinzessin.\nDie ARD-Verfilmung des Märchens 2013 war aufwändig und spielte an verschiedensten Orten. Zu den Kulissen gehörten zwei Bauten in Baden-Württemberg: das Schloss Ehrenfels in Hayingen und die Burg Teck bei Kirchheim unter Teck. Schloss Ehrenfels erinnert eher an einen säuberlich gepflegten Gutshof. Die Ruine der Gipfelburg Teck ragt dagegen imposant über das Tal der Lauter, ein Nebenfluss des Neckars. Burg Teck zählt zu den zehn schönsten Burgen Baden-Württembergs. (haro)",

    "text": "Da Seattle a Chicago, 70 municipi chiedono il cessate il fuoco\n[Marina Catucci](/archivio?autore=Marina%20Catucci), NEW YORK\nIl consiglio comunale di Chicago ha votato una risoluzione per chiedere il cessate il fuoco a Gaza. La richiesta è simbolica e non ha alcuna autorità vincolante, ma il voto testa a testa (il sindaco Brandon Johnson ha rotto un pareggio 23-23 per far approvare la risoluzione) ha fatto di Chicago la città più grande del paese ad avere approvato una simile misura.\nMercoledì mattina, a sostenerla, si era presentato anche l’attivista e politico, reverendo Jesse Jackson, mentre molti gruppi ebraici hanno chiesto al consiglio di votare no, sostenendo che stesse dedicando tempo ed energie alla guerra tra Israele e Hamas su cui non ha alcun potere mentre ci sono tanti altri problemi, come la criminalità, che vengono tralasciati. «Questo voto è simbolico – ha dichiarato Hatem Abu Dayyeh, parte della Coalizione di Chicago per la Giustizia in Palestina – ma spinge altre persone in altre città a lavorare su risoluzioni per il cessate il fuoco. Quando questo movimento sarà presente in tutto il paese, allora le potenze che sono a Washington dovranno ascoltare. Oggi diciamo sì al cessate il fuoco, sì alla risoluzione, sì al cambiamento qui a Chicago e in tutto il mondo».\nNEGLI STATI UNITI le manifestazioni per la fine della guerra continuano ad aumentare (l’ultima ieri a Washington ha paralizzato un pezzo di città) e i gruppi di attivisti stanno portando la loro battaglia dentro i municipi, dove in alcuni casi l’argomento sta offuscando le priorità locali. Da ottobre a Cleveland, Ohio, gli incontri settimanali del consiglio comunale con il pubblico è dominato dai discorsi su Gaza. Circa settanta consigli comunali in tutto il paese hanno approvato risoluzioni sul cessate il fuoco, che vanno dalla condanna di entrambe le parti in guerra, alla richiesta di porre fine agli aiuti militari statunitensi a Israele. Da settimane, in una serie di città a guida democratica, gli americani affollano le aule comunali per maratone di sessioni per chiedere un’azione immediata da parte dei leader locali su una questione lontana dai loro problemi immediati. A novembre il consiglio comunale di Detroit, in Michigan, stato che ospita la più grande comunità palestinese negli Usa, ha votato 7-2 per approvare la richiesta di un cessate il fuoco a Gaza, unendosi ad Atlanta, Akron, Wilmington, Providence, Minneapoli, Richmond e Seattle, dove il dibattito sta monopolizzando gran parte delle riunioni comunali. A San Francisco, sotto la cupola del municipio, le persone restano in fila tutta la notte per intervenire. Il consiglio comunale di Oakland ha dedicato più volte almeno quattro ore solo ai commenti del pubblico.\nÈ DI IERI, invece, la decisione della corte distrettuale di Oakland (California) in merito alla denuncia presentata da diverse associazioni statunitensi e palestinesi e dai familiari di alcune delle vittime gazawi dell’offensiva israeliana: chiedevano al tribunale di ordinare all’amministrazione Biden di agire «per impedire il genocidio del popolo palestinese a Gaza». Il giudice Jeffrey White ha detto di non aver giurisdizione sul caso («la più difficile decisione giuridica della mia vita»), ma ha espresso una durissima condanna della Casa bianca, definendo le azioni israeliane nella Striscia un «genocidio «plausibile e «implorando» il presidente Biden di «esaminare i risultati dell’instancabile sostegno all’assedio militare contro i palestinesi di Gaza».\nIntanto a Washington il Dipartimento di Stato ha minimizzato l’importanza della decisione di sospendere i finanziamenti all’agenzia dell’Onu per i rifugiati palestinesi, Unrwa. I gruppi per i diritti umani e i democratici progressisti al Congresso hanno denunciato la mossa, affermando che priverà i palestinesi di aiuti disperatamente necessari, ma il Dipartimento di Stato ha risposto dicendo di aver inviato all’agenzia 300mila dollari dei circa 121 milioni stanziati.",

A população trabalhando sem carteira assinada no setor privado alcançou um recorde de 13,444 milhões, 243 mil a mais que no trimestre anterior. Em relação ao trimestre até novembro de 2022, foram abertas 135 mil vagas sem carteira no setor privado. O trabalho por conta própria ganhou 161 mil pessoas em um trimestre, para um total de 25,556 milhões. O resultado significa 57 mil pessoas a mais atuando nessa condição em relação a um ano antes. O número de empregadores cresceu em 1 mil em um trimestre. Em relação a novembro de 2022, o total de empregadores é menor em 120 mil pessoas. O País teve um aumento de 50 mil pessoas no trabalho doméstico em um trimestre, para um total de 5,939 milhões de pessoas. Esse contingente é 75 mil pessoas maior que no ano anterior.

    "text": "National Eucharistic Pilgrimage Is ‘Bringing Out the Best in People,’ Pilgrims Say\nThe young people dedicated to walking with the Eucharist the entire journey say they’ve experienced amazing enthusiasm, hospitality and reverence among the crowds of people who have met them so far.\nMarching under a brutal south Texas sun, Charlie McCullough stopped this week to briefly talk to a young bystander as the southern route of the\nNational Eucharistic Pilgrimage passed through Victoria. The 20-something man, who grew up Protestant and in the foster-care system, had lots of questions for McCullough about what this large group of Catholics was doing — and why.\nLater on, McCullough said he encountered the young man again — he told him he had not only been inspired to pray for the first time in years, but he also wanted to continue to accompany the pilgrimage, despite not yet being Catholic.\nMcCullough, who is one of the\n23 young men and women accompanying the Eucharist all the way to Indianapolis, said although he doesn’t expect to see the young man again in this life, he hopes to reunite with him one day in heaven.\n“On pilgrimage, it’s so easy to see the best in people,” McCullough said at a Wednesday press conference with several\nfellow “ Perpetual Pilgrims,” adding that he believes it is “the Presence of the Lord bringing out the best in people.” The St. Juan Diego Route, the southernmost of the four, began in Brownsville, Texas, and has included many distinctly Hispanic expressions of Catholicism.\nThe National Eucharistic Pilgrimage is an unprecedented Catholic effort to walk with the Eucharist thousands of miles across the United States, inviting thousands of people to join along the way as a public witness to the Church’s teaching that the Eucharist is truly the Body of Jesus Christ.\nCollectively, the pilgrims will walk more than 6,500 miles and will\ntraverse four different routes, beginning on opposite sides of the country and meeting in Indianapolis for the National Eucharistic Congress July 17-21.\nBeginning on Pentecost weekend,\nthe four blockbuster pilgrimages began simultaneously with large, enthusiastic crowds present at each starting point. Now, nearly two weeks in, the nearly two dozen young people dedicated to walking with the Eucharist say they’ve experienced amazing enthusiasm, hospitality and reverence among the crowds of people who have met them so far.\nKai Weiss, a native of Germany now doing graduate studies in Washington, D.C., is traversing the northern\nMarian Route, which began at the headwaters of the Mississippi in northern Minnesota. He mentioned as a major highlight the four-and-a-half-mile Eucharistic procession from St. Paul Seminary to the Cathedral of St. Paul in St. Paul, Minnesota, which attracted a massive crowd of 7,000 people. He also said it was a wonderful experience to visit the elderly at a nursing home in St. Paul, praying the Rosary with the residents in the presence of the Eucharist.\nOutside of the large cities, however, Weiss said the crowds have been no less enthusiastic. When the pilgrims processed through the Diocese of St. Cloud — often through small towns of 200 people — crowds were out, church bells were ringing, and first communicants appeared on the side of the road with flowers.\n“The enthusiasm in the small towns was shocking,” he said, adding that although the days have been long and exhausting in many ways, he has found that the Lord always provides “some kind of spark” to help the pilgrims keep going.\nThe eastern St. Elizabeth Ann\nSeton Route has so far included stops at New York City’s St. Patrick’s Cathedral, the shrine at the former home of St. Elizabeth Ann Seton, as well as a scenic crossing of the Brooklyn Bridge. Zoe Dongas, a Perpetual Pilgrim on the route, called the moment when Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York blessed the Statue of Liberty with the monstrance a “setting out into the deep” moment that communicated to her that “Christ wants to bless our country.”\nChas Firestone East, a pilgrim on the western St.\nJunipero Serra Route, echoed Weiss’ amazement at the numbers they’ve seen even in small parishes, saying that he didn’t expect the massive welcome the pilgrims received at a rural parish in Oregon. He also said he has heard about at least one conversion connected to the pilgrimages — a photographer working for a secular newspaper who decided to become Catholic after covering the pilgrimage in Lake Tahoe.\nThe amount of actual walking the pilgrims do each day varies and is often affected by weather or terrain. The Serra Route pilgrims, with by far the longest distance to traverse, have been driving a lot through rural areas, while much of the urban stretches of the pilgrimage have so far been done on foot, often at least 10 miles a day.\nShayla Elm, a fellow\nJuan Diego Route pilgrim with McCullough, said the enthusiasm they’ve encountered so far shows “how hungry people are to show their faith.”\n“We’re giving a lot of Catholics the opportunity to be Catholic, to be Eucharistic, to show that love to the world,” she said.\nCatholics throughout the U.S. are encouraged to\nregister to join the pilgrims in walking short sections of the pilgrimages and joining in numerous other special events put on by their local dioceses.\nTo read more articles about the National Eucharistic Pilgrimage and National Eucharistic Congress,\nvisit this special page on the Register website.",

    "text": "A polícia da cidade de Phoenix, no Arizona (Estados Unidos), viola sistematicamente os direitos constitucionais ao implementar força excessiva, atacar minorias e pessoas em situação de rua, segundo um informe do Departamento de Justiça divulgado nesta quinta-feira (13). \"O Departamento de Polícia de Phoenix faz uso excessivo de força, muitas vezes aumentando injustificadamente o nível de força nos primeiros minutos ou até segundos\" da abordagem, disse Kristen Clarke, promotora-geral adjunta de Direitos Civis do Departamento de Justiça dos Estados Unidos. \"Por exemplo, os policiais de Phoenix atiraram em um homem e, depois que ele caiu, dispararam contra ele várias vezes, e mandaram um cachorro policial para arrastá-lo até eles\", declarou Clarke. \"A dor que eles lhe causaram foi extraordinária, por nove minutos os agentes não lhe deram assistência médica. De forma trágica, o homem morreu\", concluiu. O informe de 126 páginas é produto de uma investigação de quase três anos iniciada pelo Departamento de Justiça, depois de um pente fino nas polícias de cidades como Mineápolis e Louisville, onde foram registradas situações similares. Os Estados Unidos vêm registrando há décadas episódios trágicos de violência policial, um tema que divide a sociedade. Clarke disse, ainda, que a população de rua da capital do Arizona \"tem sofrido um padrão de conduta inconstitucional\" pelas mãos da polícia. \"É histórico. Essa é a primeira vez que o Departamento de Justiça encontra violações dos direitos civis e constitucionais de pessoas sem teto\", disse a porta-voz do gabinete em coletiva de imprensa. De acordo com o relatório, 37% das prisões e intimações delitos menores correspondem a pessoas em situação de rua. A investigação também constatou uma discriminação sistemática contra negros, latinos e indígenas durante a atividade policial, baseando-se em estatísticas do próprio Departamento de Polícia sobre o tratamento desproporcional que as minorias recebem. \"O Departamento de Polícia afirmou que não estava a par dessas desigualdades raciais\", indicou Clarke. \"Pelas queixas da comunidade, deveriam ter impulsionado o departamento a analisar seus próprios dados. Ao contrário, fizeram vista grossa\", afirmou. O relatório também mostra que a polícia discrimina pessoas com deficiência, e que reprime violentamente manisfestantes ou cidadãos que protestam contra seus atos. \"Levamos a sério todas as acusações e vamos revisar este extenso informe com a mente aberta\", disse Jeff Barton, administrador da Prefeitura, em um comunicado. A polícia de Phoenix tem sido considerada como uma das mais violentas dos Estados Unidos, de acordo com um informe de 2018, realizado pelo Instituto Nacional de Polícia, uma organização sem fins lucrativos. pr/mel/ln/mvv © Agence France-Presse",
