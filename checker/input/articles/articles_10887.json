    "title": "RCCG Celebrates Pastor Enoch Adeboye's 82nd Birthday with N400 Million Digital Skills Initiative",
    "text": "The Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) has launched a N400 million digital skills initiative, titled 'A World of Unlimited Possibilities,' to commemorate the 82nd birthday of its General Overseer, Pastor Enoch Adeboye. This initiative aims to equip over 1,000 Nigerian youths with vital digital skills, promoting economic growth and alleviating poverty.\nWhy this matters: This initiative has broader significance as it addresses the critical issue of poverty alleviation and economic growth in Nigeria. By equipping youths with digital skills, it has the potential to create a ripple effect that can lead to sustainable economic development and improved living standards.\nOver 12,000 Nigerian youths applied for the\nprogram, with 5,000 taking an online test, and 1,000 selected for the physical meeting. The initiative focuses on youths aged 15-45, preparing them for the future of work by providing them with the necessary digital skills.\nPastor Oluwagbemileke Adeboye, the personal assistant and son of Pastor Enoch Adeboye, emphasized the initiative's goal of empowering Nigerian youths to start their own\nbusinesses and support the economy. 'We are hoping that in nine months, people that have come will give birth to their own businesses and companies along that line, but with the mindset of 'A World of Unlimited Possibilities,' they will help support the economy,' he said.\nFatai Williams, CEO of\nAfrica Mission Global, highlighted the broader impact of the initiative on society. 'The initiative would be extremely impactful for the youth as it would reach a larger number of people in society based on what the digital initiative offers. So when you scale up young people with digital knowledge, they can fit into any sector based on their digital skills,' he noted.\nThe program is part of RCCG's\nContinent 3s digital transformation drive and is expected to have a long-term impact on the Nigerian economy. It aims to create jobs and alleviate poverty by equipping youths with the skills needed to thrive in a digital world. The church does not intend to employ the youths directly but rather to empower them to start their own businesses and create jobs for others.\nPastor Enoch Adeboye's 82nd birthday marks another milestone in his life, which has been characterized by his commitment to spreading\nlove, faith, and hope globally. His visionary leadership has transformed countless lives, inspiring millions to walk in the path of righteousness and pursue God's purpose.\nThe RCCG's digital skills initiative demonstrates its commitment to not only spiritual growth but also to the economic and social development of Nigerian youths. By equipping them with digital skills, the church aims to create a ripple effect that will alleviate poverty and promote economic growth across the nation.\nTo recap, the RCCG's N400 million digital skills initiative, launched in celebration of Pastor Enoch Adeboye's 82nd birthday, aims to transform the lives of over 1,000 Nigerian youths by providing them with vital digital skills. This initiative is expected to have a significant impact on poverty alleviation and economic growth in Nigeria.\nKey Takeaways\n- RCCG launches N400m digital skills initiative for 1,000 Nigerian youths.\n- Initiative aims to equip youths with vital digital skills for economic growth.\n- Program focuses on youths aged 15-45, preparing them for the future of work.\n- Goal is to empower youths to start their own businesses and support the economy.\n- Initiative expected to have a long-term impact on poverty alleviation and economic growth.",

    "title": "Weak \"Guardrails\" on Police Face Recognition Use Make Things Worse",
    "text": "Police use of face recognition technology (FRT) poses a particularly massive risk to our civil liberties, [particularly for Black men and women](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/police-facial-recognition-technology-cant-tell-black-people-apart/) and other marginalized communities. That's why EFF supports a ban on government FRT use. Half-measures aren't up to the task. However, even as half-measures go, California's legislature is currently considering a [particularly weak proposal](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB1814) in the form of A.B. 1814, authored by Asm. Phil Ting (San Francisco). It would introduce paltry limits that will do nothing to address the many problems that police use of face recognition raises. In fact, the bill's language could make things worse in California. This something? It's worse than nothing—by a long shot. For example, major police departments in California [have pledged not to use](https://onezero.medium.com/lapd-drops-clearview-a-i-but-not-all-facial-recognition-a5e7931e40bc) Clearview AI, a company that's [been sued repeatedly](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/02/victory-another-lawsuit-proceeds-against-clearviews-face-surveillance) for building its database from scraped social media posts, in light of public pressure. But A.B. 1814 expressly gives police departments the right to access \"third-party databases,\" including Clearview AI. This could give law enforcement agencies cover to use databases that they have previously distanced themselves from and will erode progress civil liberties advocates have already made. The bill also states police have access to any state database, even if the images were not collected for law enforcement purposes. California should not give law enforcement the green light to mine databases, particularly those built for completely different reasons. This goes against what people are expecting when they give their information to one database, only to learn later that information has been informing police face surveillance. Finally, A.B. 1814 fails to even meet the bar of restrictions other police departments have agreed to adopt. As we have previously written, the [Detroit Police Department](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/07/detroit-takes-important-step-curbing-harms-face-recognition-technology) agreed to limits on its use of face recognition technology after it [falsely arrested Robert Williams](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/10/face-recognition-isnt-just-face-identification-and-verification) as a result of a incorrect face recognition \"match.\" As part of these limits, the Detroit police have agreed to \"bar arrests based solely on face recognition results, or the results of the ensuing photo lineup.\" Their agreement also affirms that prosecutors and defense attorneys will have access to information about any uses of FRT in cases where law enforcement files charges. The California bill does not even include these safeguards. It says that police can not use a database match as the sole basis for an arrest, but it would allow a photo lineup based on a match to be considered a second technique. This puts people who look like the suspect in front of witnesses who may be likely to pick that person—even if it is an entirely different person. That lets law enforcement agencies easily clear the low bar the bill sets. A.B. 1814 is sitting in the Senate Appropriations Committee. EFF has joined with dozens of civil liberties organizations to urge the committee not to advance the bill. If it does move forward, we'll be asking you to help us fight it on the Senate floor. Proponents of the bill have argued that, essentially, it is better to do something than have no guardrails in place. But this something? It's worse than nothing—by a long shot.",

    "text": "The National Mall was transformed into somewhat of a wintry battlefield Tuesday morning as people gathered for a snowball fight. [Amid cancellations throughout the region due to a winter weather advisory](https://wtop.com/weather/2024/01/snow-and-freezing-rain-continue-to-fall-in-dc-region-slick-road-conditions-remain/), the Washington D.C. Snowball Fight Association issued a call to battle that turned the mall into a scene of pure snowball carnage. Michal Lippen, with the association, picked the setting for the snow showdown. It’s a tradition in D.C. with the first fight organized by the association dating back to 2010, Lippen said. “You’ve got a view of the monument one direction, you’ve got the Capitol the other direction, and the snow is nice and spread out,” he told WTOP. The gathering happens in what Max Bluestein characterized as “polarized” city. “A lot of anxiety, a lot of hate, a lot of ideology, we kind of put all that to the side once in a blue moon when it snows out here,” he said. “We pelt each other snowballs, and we act like kids.” Dozens of people of all ages floated, zinged and whipped snowballs with some even participating in a quick fight before logging into work. And it wouldn’t be much of a snowball fight without some shots to the face and some tears. “Took a couple of my head, one on the nose and one where it was really sensitive and that one took me out,” Bluestein said. WTOP’s Jessica Kronzer and John Domen contributed to this report. See photos of the big snowball fight as well as photos from a popular sledding spot in Prince George’s County, Maryland, below.",
