    "text": "It’s fair to say that keeping on top of the laundry pile is no one’s idea of fun. Particularly while the weather’s as cold and wet as it is. Hanging washing outside is generally a no-go during the winter months, which makes the process more of a hassle than it needs to be, as we all know hanging garments up in chilly rooms can mean they take yonks to dry. Enter, heated clothes airers . These handy home appliances provide a compromise between draping wet garments over radiators and using a tumble dryer when you want to speed up laundry drying times. Tumble dryers can be expensive to run, which typically makes heated clothes airers a more energy-efficient option to invest in, while energy prices aren’t far from many of our minds. The Dry:Soon drying pod features in our review of the best heated clothes airers and it impressed our testers when it came to super-fast drying times. Our writer noted that T-shirts and cotton shirts were dry in the space of an hour, while thicker fabrics were “mostly dry in two hours”. Better still, the appliance is reduced by 30 per cent, which has brought the price down to less than £70, the same price as during the Black Friday sales. Keep reading for all the details on this money-saving home appliance deal. Looking for an energy-efficient way to tackle your laundry this winter? There’s 30 per cent off this drying pod at Amazon right now, taking its price to less than £70. It can hold up to 12 items of clothing on hangers, has six drying time settings, and a timer.

AFP\nUN rights experts voiced alarm on Thursday at soaring numbers of journalists killed in the Gaza war, decrying an apparent \"deliberate\" Israeli strategy to silence critical reporting.\n\"Rarely have journalists paid such a heavy price for just doing their job as those in Gaza now,\" the five experts said in a statement.\nUnited Nations reports indicate that at least 122 journalists and other media workers have been killed and many others injured in the Gaza Strip since war erupted.\n\"We are alarmed at the extraordinarily high numbers of journalists and media workers who have been killed, attacked, injured and detained in the occupied Palestinian territory, particularly in Gaza, in recent months,\" the experts said.\nThe independent experts, who are appointed by the UN Human Rights Council but do not speak on behalf of the United Nations, said they had received \"disturbing reports that, despite being clearly identifiable in jackets and helmets marked 'press' or travelling in well-marked press vehicles, journalists have come under attack.\"\nThis, they warned, \"would seem to indicate that the killings, injury, and detention are a deliberate strategy by Israeli forces to obstruct the media and silence critical reporting.\" \"Targeted attacks and killings of journalists are war crimes.\"\nThe experts, including the special rapporteurs on freedom of expression, on rights in the Palestinian territories and on extrajudicial executions, also voiced grave concerns that Israel has refused to let media from outside Gaza to enter and report unless they are embedded with Israeli forces.\n\"The attacks on media in Gaza and restrictions on other journalists from accessing Gaza, combined with severe disruptions of the internet, are major impediments to the right of information of the people of Gaza as well as the outside world,\" they said.\nThey also urged international courts to pay particular attention to this \"dangerous pattern of attacks and impunity for crimes against journalists.\"\nAgence France-Presse",

    "text": "President Tinubu: Workers’ll enjoy living wage in 2024 President Bola Tinubu has said that the Federal Government would implement a new national living wage for industrious workers in 2024. He said that the decision was not only for good economic sense but “because it is the morally and politically correct thing to do”. In a New Year message on Monday in Lagos, Tinubu said this would ensure that the economic aspirations and material well-being of the poor, most vulnerable and working people, are not neglected. “We will work diligently to make sure every Nigerian feels the impact of their government. “The economic aspirations and the material well-being of the poor, the most vulnerable and the working people shall not be neglected. “It is in this spirit that we are going to implement a new national living wage for our industrious workers this New Year. “It is not only good economics to do this; it is also a morally and politically correct thing to do. “Having laid the groundwork of our economic recovery plans within the last seven months of 2023, we are now poised to accelerate the pace of our service delivery across sectors.’’ He said that the issue of stable electricity supply would continue to get priority because of the recognition that no sustainable development could be achieved without steady electricity. The president said that 2024 would also witness a boost in food supply and production of petroleum product with the various initiatives put in place in the last seven months of the administration. “Just this past December during COP28 in Dubai, the German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and I agreed and committed to a new deal to speed up the delivery of the Siemens Energy power project that will ultimately deliver reliable supply of electricity to our homes and businesses under the Presidential Power Initiative which began in 2018. “Other power installation projects to strengthen the reliability of our transmission lines and optimise the integrity of our National grid are on-going across the country. “My administration recognises that no meaningful economic transformation can happen without steady electricity supply. “In 2024, we are moving a step further in our quest to restart local refining of petroleum products with Port Harcourt Refinery, and the Dangote Refinery which shall fully come on stream. “To ensure constant food supply, security and affordability, we will step up our plan to cultivate 500,000 hectares of farmlands across the country to grow maize, rice, wheat, millet and other staple crops. “We launched the dry season farming with 120,000 hectares of land in Jigawa State last November under our National Wheat Development Programme. “In this new year, we will race against time to ensure all the fiscal and tax policies reforms we need to put in place are codified and simplified to ensure the business environment does not destroy value. “On every foreign trip I have embarked on, my message to investors and other business people has been the same -Nigeria is ready and open for business.’’ Get the latest news delivered straight to your inbox every day of the week.

    "text": "El albergue departamental no solo protege animales domésticos. A este sitio también llegan animales víctimas de negligencia, abandono y maltrato. En el caso de San Andrés, el Centro de Bienestar Animal es un espacio para cuidar y rehabilitar animales de la isla en situación de vulnerabilidad. Sin embargo, desde el Centro explican que “la importancia de este tipo de sitios va más allá de la protección animal, pues contribuyen al bienestar social y a la sensibilización de la comunidad sobre el respeto hacia todos los seres vivos”.Actualmente, el Centro de Bienestar Animal de San Andrés, que actualmente se encuentra adjudicado, alberga más de 70 perros, todos vacunados y esterilizados. Además de animales maltratados que fueron rescatados como caballos y vacas.De hecho, esta labor que lideran ha servido para erradicar la cultura del abuso animal en la isla. “El trabajo conjunto con la Policía Ambiental y la Secretaría de Servicios Públicos y Medio Ambiente ha sido clave para llevar a cabo rescates y tomar acciones legales en contra de quienes infringen los derechos de los animales”, agregaron desde el Centro. Estas acciones son posibles gracias al manejo adecuado del albergue, que ha sido uno de los frentes de acción de la administración departamental con el objetivo de proteger los animales y brindar educación sobre el maltrato.Acciones concretasControlar la sobrepoblación de animales de compañía ha sido otro de los grandes objetivos. Por eso, desde el Centro de Bienestar Animal se lideran campañas de esterilización que ayudan a evitar situaciones de abandono y maltrato. Este año, por ejemplo, se hicieron diez jornadas de esterilización exitosas que beneficiaron a más de 700 animales, incluyendo la Isla de Providencia. Estos procedimientos no solo previenen la proliferación de animales sin hogar, sino que promueven la salud y el bienestar de las mascotas, reduciendo el riesgo de enfermedades transmisibles y mejorando la calidad de vida de los que ya tienen hogar.Con respecto al rescate de vacas y caballos, aunque menos frecuentes que los de perros y gatos, ponen de manifiesto la diversidad de animales que necesitan atención y protección en la isla. En el Centro de Bienestar reciben atención médica, rehabilitación física y emocional. Así mismo, se les brinda la oportunidad de ser devueltos a sus dueños cuando estos demuestran ser responsables o, en algunos casos, se les busca un nuevo hogar.Crear concienciaEste albergue también desempeña un rol fundamental para generar conciencia en la comunidad sobre la importancia de tratar a los animales con respeto y cuidado. “La sensibilización contra el maltrato animal es uno de los pilares, pues una sociedad informada es clave para erradicar conductas abusivas. La comunidad juega un papel crucial en este proceso a través de la denuncia de casos de maltrato y el apoyo en las jornadas de esterilización”, advirtieron los especialistas del Centro.Para garantizar que el albergue siga cumpliendo con su misión, la comunidad puede contribuir de varias formas: donación de alimentos, medicinas y recursos para las jornadas de esterilización, además de colaborar activamente con la Policía Ambiental y la Secretaría de Servicios Públicos. Por cuenta de todas estas acciones, un albergue departamental como el Centro de Bienestar Animal de San Andrés no solo tiene un impacto directo en la vida de los animales rescatados, también contribuye a la construcción de una comunidad más empática y responsable.“La protección animal y la educación sobre el maltrato son esenciales para construir una sociedad más justa, solidaria y respetuosa con todos los seres vivos”, concluyeron desde la entidad, que se ha convertido en un modelo de bienestar social y animal. *Contenido elaborado con apoyo de la Gobernación de San Andrés",
