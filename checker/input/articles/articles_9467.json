    "text": "The National Payments Corporation of India has announced important changes in the rules of UPI. The peer-to-peer collect request feature will be discontinued from October 1, 2025, which was increasing the possibilities of fraud. From now on, users will have to resort to QR code or contact number for UPI payments.\nUPI Payments Rule Change: Since the advent of UPI, the culture of cash has almost ended in India. Now everyone makes online payments through UPI apps like Phonepe, GooglePay or PayTm. If you also do the same, then know that NPCI i.e. National Payments Corporation of India has issued new rules for UPI. According to these changed rules, a very commonly used feature peer-to-peer (P2P) “collect request” will be removed on UPI apps from October 1, 2025.\nWhat is P2P Collect Request feature?\nLet us tell you that with the help of P2P Collect Request feature, a user could request payment from another UPI user. After this, the other user accepts the request and makes the payment by entering his UPI PIN. For some time, this feature was being used more for fraud. After this, now NPCI has decided to remove this feature from UPI apps. This means that now users using UPI apps will not be able to make payments on someone’s request.\nHow was the fraud done?\nThose who commit fraud through UPI apps used to use this P2P collect request feature a lot. Through this, they used to send money requests to the user by telling fake identity or fake emergency. After this, the user used to accept that request and his entire account used to be emptied. Despite the limit of Rs 2,000 on this feature, people were being cheated in many cases.\nWhat will happen next?\nNow from October 1, this feature will not be visible on UPI apps. If you have to make payment through UPI apps, then you will have to scan the QR code or select the contact number for this. Without this, UPI payment will not be possible through any third method. Experts believe that this will lead to a huge decline in cases of fraud with UPI users.\nThese services will not be affected\nIf you are thinking that you will not be able to make UPI payment even if the merchant requests payment for making an online payment, then it is not so. Merchant services like Flipkart, Amazon, Swiggy, IRCTC will not be affected. By using them, you will be able to send collection requests as before. After this, you will have to accept the request and make the payment by entering the UPI PIN.",

Turns out, a pack of four coyotes was quietly lurking behind them.\n“So when I look at the back, I just saw them, I never realized there were four coyotes behind me,” he said.\nThe coyotes were bold and lunged at the leashed Dalmatians.\nLantadilla said Deanna bit one of the coyotes in the neck, which convinced the pack to run away.\nJane Friedlander, the dogs’ owner, said she is not surprised that her dogs acted so bravely. She said this isn’t the first time her dogs have been targeted by coyotes.\nLantadilla and the dogs were unharmed, and their owner is crediting their breed.\n“They’re meant to drive away coyotes, wolves, foxes, rabbits, anything that would bother a stable or horses,” Friedlander said.\nThere’s no doubt in the dog walker’s mind that the two dogs were looking out for him that night.\n“Of course, they were meant for that,” he said.\nCopyright 2023 WBZ via CNN Newsource.

    "text": "El reciclaje y la sostenibilidad se han convertido en banderas de la generación joven en pleno siglo XXI. Se habla con orgullo de la importancia de reutilizar, reducir el consumo y reciclar para cuidar el planeta todos aquellos que se hacen llamar \" alternativos\" .\nSin embargo, lo que muchos no saben (igual que hay tanta reivindicación hay mucha ignorancia), es que esta \"nueva\" conciencia ecológica tiene raíces mucho más profundas, ya que se trataba como forma de vida para los que crecimos en los años 60 y 70.\nEn aquellos tiempos, el uso de las bolsas de tela no eran una moda hípster ni un accesorio de la vida sostenible; eran simplemente una necesidad.\nLas bolsas de tela antes de ser \" Cool\" fueron accesorios útiles , de las que había varias en cada familia y se utilizaban para comprar el pan, para ir al mercado o cualquier otro lugar donde se necesitara cargar algo. Eran prácticas y duraderas y, lo más importante, reutilizables . No se trataba de ser ecológico, sino de usar lo que estaba disponible y era útil.\nA diferencia de las actuales bolsas con eslóganes y diseños llamativos , las talegas eran humildes y muchas veces hechas en casa con retales , usarlas formaba parte de la rutina diaria.\nPero la Economía Circular , ya existía antes que muchos la promulgaran, nosotros lo llamábamos \" heredar la ropa\" , que es otro ejemplo claro de que la sostenibilidad no es una novedad . En aquella época, era común que la ropa pasara de un hermano a otro, o incluso entre primos y vecinos. No se trataba de \"moda pronto\" ni de consumir por consumir . Toda la ropa se usaba hasta que ya no daba más de sí, y luego se reciclaba en trapos.\nLas prendas de vestir se reparaban y cuidaban con esmero. El fenómeno de la costurera en casa (mi recuerdo para esa Toñi ) que hacia la ropa a medida además de \" hacer el repaso\" subir y bajar dobladillos, coser lo roto y remendar lo imposible. Comprar ropa nueva era un lujo , y no la norma.\nTambién cada página tenia otra vida. Los libros del colegio tampoco se quedaban atrás en la dinámica del reciclaje . Las familias los cuidaban como si fueran tesoros , porque sabían que después del hermano mayor, el libro de matemáticas, ciencias o latín pasaría al siguiente en la fila. Era habitual encontrar libros llenos de anotaciones, subrayados y fórmulas escritas en los márgenes por otros niños, lo que, de alguna forma, añadía un plus sentimental a cada ejemplar.\nLa conciencia de \"no desperdiciar\" estaba presente en cada aspecto de la vida cotidiana. No había tanta abundancia ni facilidad para reemplazar lo que se dañaba, lo que obligaba a las personas a valorar más lo que tenían y a extender la vida útil de cada objeto lo máximo posible.\nOtro punto importante es el uso de envases retornables . Las botellas de leche, de refrescos o cervezas se devolvían al comercio donde se compraban, y allí se limpiaban y reutilizaban. Hoy en día, hablar de envases retornables es casi un acto revolucionario , pero en el pasado era lo más normal del mundo.\nAunque hoy día el reciclaje se ha industrializado y se ha convertido en una cuestión de conciencia global , no podemos olvidar que las generaciones anteriores ya practicábamos el arte de reutilizar mucho antes de que la palabra \"ecológico\" se pusiera de moda. No se hacía por una causa ambiental, sino por una cuestión de necesidad y economía doméstica.\nPero como decía T.S. Eliot, \" Cada momento es un nuevo comienzo\".\nY también es un nuevo comienzo para esos niñitos que la Fundación Tierra de Hombres trae cada año para poderlos operar y con ese fin organizan una gala que este año se celebró en El Fuerte de Isla Mágica .\nGala Benéfica La Esperanza. E. E.\nMaria Antonia Jiménez (Nena) responsable de la fundación, recibió a multitud de personas que quisieron apoyar el evento que presentaron y animaron Lucia Hoyos y Agustín Bravo , y duro hasta altas horas de la madrugada.\nMuy peligroso es el nuevo comienzo de la experiencia Orange Garden en Aires de Sevilla, una vez que empiezas ya no lo puedes dejar…¡¡ maravillosa!!\nFoto del acto.\nEl Consulado de Portugal en Sevilla se convirtió en el escenario de la inauguración de la XXII edición de la Semana Internacional de la Moda en Andalucía. La velada, que reunió a más de 250 invitados del sector de la moda, incluyó la entrega de la IV edición de los Premios SIMA 41 , galardones que destacan la innovación, sostenibilidad y proyección internacional del diseño andaluz.\nPremios SIMA 41.\nNo quiero despedirme sin felicitar antes a la Doctora Pilar Gomez Juste por su descumpleaños y a Esther Álvarez-Ossorio por llevar 37 años con la firma Victorio&Lucchino.\nEn la siguiente nos vemos y os seguiré contando qué pasó por aquí.\nLos últimos LOS DÍAS AZULES Entre Olavide y Alexa Javier Navarro LOS DÍAS AZULES San Gonzalo, Dostoievski y el Gran Inquisidor Javier Navarro AL FINAL, BIEN El otro barrio Pedro Ybarra En la presentación de un libro Luis Romero",
