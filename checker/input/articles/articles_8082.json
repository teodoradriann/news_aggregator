    "title": "FDA Plans to End Ban on Sperm Donations From Gay, Bisexual Men",
    "text": "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is reportedly planning to end its broad ban against anonymous sperm donations by gay and bisexual men. “Longstanding agency rules ban anonymous sperm donations by men who acknowledged having sex with other men during the previous five years to reduce the risk of spreading pathogens including HIV, the virus that causes AIDS,” The Wall Street Journal first reported on Thursday. “Under a proposal it is drafting, the FDA would eliminate the broad ban and instead adopt more pointed screening questions to assess HIV risk, according to people familiar with the agency’s deliberations.” The proposed changes would also extend to the donations of other cells and tissues, “such as heart valves and ligaments,” according to the report. The agency is reportedly planning to finalize the rule change by summer. The new guidelines would likely go into effect by the end of the year if the White House gives its stamp of approval, the report states. The FDA ban originated in the 1980s during the HIV epidemic, with health authorities enforcing the rule to reduce the risk of the virus spreading through sperm. Medical groups and gay-rights groups have been pressuring the FDA to relax the rules in recent years, and say HIV tests are much more accurate now to allow for safe sperm donation. Precautions also include testing donors twice, six months apart — donors’ samples must test negative for HIV before their sperm vials are released, according to the report. “The current policy ‘is based on outdated thinking and is contrary to evidence-based science, and serves to perpetuate discrimination and stigma,’ a coalition of groups including the American Medical Association and nonprofit National Center for Lesbian Rights wrote to the FDA last year,” the report continues. The proposal comes soon after the FDA made a similar change allowing more gay and bisexual men to donate blood. Expanding the pool of sperm donors “could address shortages,” the Journal notes. “Sperm banks have been experiencing shortages of donors, especially donors of color. The Covid-19 pandemic exacerbated the problem as young professionals and university students, who often compose a large portion of prospective donors, left cities,” according to the report. Many people who use sperm banks are part of the LGBTQ+ community, and “some seek out donors who are also LGBTQ,” the report states.",

    "text": "Xavier Worthy could start the season with a bang. By Christopher Kline | 4:54 PM EDT\nXavier Worthy, Kansas City Chiefs / David Eulitt/GettyImages\nThe Kansas City Chiefs are generally a smart offense to bet on in fantasy football . Last season was a mild aberration, though. Even Travis Kelce went through his lulls. Patrick Mahomes will always rank near the top of QB boards, but it's fair to wonder how the individual pieces around him will produce through the cold, hard lense of fantasy.\nIsiah Pecheco and Travis Kelce are the strongest, safest bets — a workhorse power back and the NFL's most dominant tight end. Even after mixed results in 2023, Kelce figures to produce as well as anybody at his position. How the Chiefs' WR room fares, however, will be the focus for a lot of folks. There are golden opportunities aplenty to buy low on Kansas City wideouts. If the right connection clicks with Mahomes, there could be major rewards for those who take the plunge.\nThere are probably three Chiefs wideouts who are truly worthy of investment in fantasy football — Hollywood Brown, Rashee Rice, and (no pun intended) Xavier Worthy. Rice is the de facto WR1 after a strong rookie season, but he's due for a suspension in the distant future. It's unclear when the league will actually bring the hammer down, but Rice was responsible for multiple injuries in a reckless driving accident, so he figures to miss a fair amount of time.\nAs for which Chiefs wideout deserves second billing, that is a more complex issue. Both Hollywood Brown and Xavier Worthy occupy similar niches on paper. Small, skinny, and utterly explosive pass-catchers who can take the lid off a defense and wreak havoc after the catch. The Chiefs have plenty of room for multiple wide receivers in that mold, but odds are one really pops as Mahomes' favorite deep-ball target.\nXavier Worthy has major Week 1 upside for Chiefs, but it could get complicated afterward For those toggling their lineup bubble on Thursday night, Worthy is among the best upside bets for Week 1. It's never totally safe to rely on rookies in fantasy — especially not in Week 1 — but Worthy should receive a healthy target share with Hollywood on the sideline. Brown has been officially ruled out for Thursday Night Football after suffering a shoulder injury in the Chiefs' preseason opener. He could miss another week or two, depending on unknowable factors.\nThat sets up Worthy on a pedestal out of the gate. It also means Worthy has been able to get more reps with Mahomes, both in practice and in preseason action, since Brown's injury. That could prove to be an early-season advantage, even after Brown returns.\nIn the long run, however, Brown has more experience to lean on and he's a generally \"safe\" projection compared to the untested Worthy. Neither is very strong, but Brown is listed at 180 pounds. Worthy sits at 165 pounds. Physicality was an issue for Worthy during camp and he's going to face a steep adjustment period at the NFL level. It won't matter so much if Mahomes is focused on Worthy, but once Brown returns, he could very quickly take a chunk out of Worthy's week-to-week target share.\nBoth Worthy and Brown can score a 60-yard touchdown at a moment's notice, so there will be upside all around every week. In terms of who emerges as a more stable WR2 from the Chiefs offense, though, the safest season-long bet in probably Brown. That obviously won't apply to Week 1, though. Plus Worthy into those lineups and see if he can use his trademark speed to break off a chunk gain against the Baltimore Ravens' stingy defense. With Mahomes throwing the football, pretty much anything is possible.\nfeed\nRelated Topics Kansas Fantasy NFL News Kansas City Chiefs Fantasy Football Home / Fantasy Football",

    "text": "子癇前症增孕產婦與胎兒死亡風險！醫籲：中晚期子癇檢測應納入臨床風險評估\n「如果當初照常規約產婦一個月後才回診，後果一定不堪設想」台大醫院婦產部產科主任施景中醫師，分享近期透過中晚期子癇前症篩檢，醫療團隊及時介入、適當處置，成功保住母胎的實例。\n看似平順的產檢背後，其實潛藏風險。一名懷孕21週的準媽媽，在高層次超音波檢查中被發現胎兒體重小兩週，雖未出現其他症狀，卻在中期子癇前症篩檢中驗出，胎盤功能異常程度超標7倍，屬於高風險族群，醫療團隊當下緊急連絡孕婦回診，啟動一連串監測與用藥，一路安胎到29週，寶寶順利出生。\n子癇前症是孕產婦與胎兒死亡的主因之一，全球每年造成超過7萬名孕婦死亡、胎兒死亡更逾50萬例，導致早產約260萬例。病程變化迅速，常見於懷孕20週後，若未及時發現與妥善處置，恐引發顱內出血、胎盤早期剝離，甚至子宮內胎兒死亡。\n這項檢測的臨床價值，也在近日舉行的台灣周產期醫學會共識會議中獲得肯定。會中針對「中晚期子癇前症篩檢」的臨床經驗與國際制度進行深入討論，與會專家達成共識，該檢驗具備預測高危險妊娠的實用性，建議可作為台灣產科臨床風險評估與照護決策的重要參考依據。\n國際上，德國自2019年起即針對中晚期子癇前症檢測建立制度，由政府醫療保險(SHI)補助孕婦在24週後受檢，最多可免費提供三次檢測。德國漢堡-埃彭多夫大學醫學中心Stefan Verlohren教授指出，該檢測已被德、奧地利和瑞士等國婦產科協會建議列為常規臨床參數，幫助診斷、預測子癇前症，並掌握疾病進展。\n英國的全國性子癇前症病例分析顯示，發生癲癇發作時，孕婦事前並無高血壓或蛋白尿紀錄者高達38%。因此，英國胎兒醫學基金會(FMF)建議，22週、36週都應該重新評估子癇前症風險。若22週為中/高風險者，應於32週再次評估，36週評估則有助決定分娩時機。\n中晚期子癇前症篩檢可藉由血液中sFlt-1(可溶性血管內皮生長因子受體1)/PlGF(胎盤生長因子)比值掌握胎盤功能異常程度。檢測時機為懷孕20週後至36週，篩檢結果可協助臨床醫師判斷是否提前用藥、安排生產計畫，及早介入治療；針對懷孕周數較小且風險極高的孕婦，能及早促進胎兒肺泡成熟，並提前通報兒科新生兒團隊介入，確保母胎安全。\n臺北榮民總醫院婦女醫學部產科主任葉長青醫師表示，子癇前症的症狀多變，難以單靠傳統指標(如血壓、蛋白尿)掌握風險，至今仍是產科領域中最難應對的高危妊娠挑戰之一。如今透過生化指標可在症狀出現前就預警，將有助降低不良妊娠的發生率。\n周產期醫學會指出，該檢測對基層婦產科診所而言，是快速識別高危險妊娠的的有效工具；在醫學中心則可發揮鑑別診斷與風險分級、精準照護的作用，為母胎安全提供多一層保障。\n就是現在！0元購高濃度魚油！快加入【華人健康網VIP開團購】享好康！>>>\n【延伸閱讀】\n預防腎結石要不能補鈣片？迷思破解！高敏敏營養師：造成腎結石飲食4大風險\n好動=過動症？過動症長大就會好？吳宛容中醫師：刺激5大穴位，助改善ADHD\n減肥或延緩性早熟，吃益生菌有用嗎？侯家瑋醫師：5要訣吃益生菌守護健康\n更多健康資訊：華人健康網\nhttps://www.top1health.com",

    "title": "U.S. Strikes Are Not the Solution to Escalating Conflict in the Middle East",
    "text": "With recent U.S. strikes against\nIran-backed militia groups in Yemen and across the Middle East, the United States risks escalating regional conflict and being pulled into yet another disastrous war.\nSince the beginning of January., the U.S. and U.K. have carried out repeated strikes against the Houthis, a Yemeni militia group that controls large swaths of the country. The strikes have come in response to\nHouthi efforts to hinder international trade in the Red Sea in what they say is a protest of Israel’s war in Gaza.\n“Are [the strikes] stopping the Houthis? No,” President Joe Biden\ntold reporters on Jan. 18. “Are they going to continue? Yes.”\nRather than pursuing a reckless, ineffective military approach, the U.S. must focus on the root issue of this conflict: Gaza.\nThe strikes between the U.S. and Iran-backed groups in Syria and Iraq have also surged in recent months, culminating tragically in the\nkilling of three U.S. service members last week in Jordan near the Syrian border.\nRather than pursuing a reckless, ineffective military approach that will only fuel more violence, the U.S. must focus on the root issue of this conflict: Gaza. Pressing for a ceasefire in Gaza is the only solution to ending many of the attacks being carried out by the Houthis and other militant groups in the Middle East.\nIn fact, during the short-term ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in November, attacks from both the\nHouthis and Iran-backed groups stopped almost completely.\nMembers of Congress Question U.S. Strikes\nHouthi attacks on cargo ships in the Red Sea began in October in\nresponse to Israel’s attacks in Gaza. On Jan. 9, the Houthis carried out their l argest attack so far, targeting American and British warships. While no casualties were reported, the U.S. and U.K. retaliated with dozens of strikes on Houthi targets starting Jan. 11.\nThese strikes were criticized by members of Congress from both parties. On Jan. 23, Senators Tim Kaine (VA), Todd Young (IN), Chris Murphy (CT), and Mike Lee (UT) wrote a bipartisan\nletter pressing President Biden to provide clarity on the strikes. They asked the administration to articulate its reasoning behind these strikes, especially given Biden’s admission that they are doing little to deter the Houthis.\nA ceasefire in Gaz is the only step that’s proven effective in ending these attacks.\nThe Senators also inquired about the administration’s lack of reporting to Congress. The 1973\nWar Powers Resolution (WPR) requires the president to report military strikes not authorized by Congress. But the administration failed to report strikes against the Houthis that were carried out prior to January, which sets a dangerous precedent for disregarding the WPR and the separation of powers set out in the Constitution.\nA bipartisan group of 27 House lawmakers wrote their own\nletter to the president questioning the constitutionality of the strikes. Their letter asked the Biden administration to provide the legal authority for the strikes and urged the president to seek authorization from Congress before conducting any further military action in Yemen.\nAn Avenue for De-Escalation\nRather than de-escalating the situation, these strikes are serving as fuel for a new U.S. conflict in the Middle East. Instead of deterring Houthi attacks, they are only further hampering commercial travel through the Red Sea.\nContinuing military strikes risks dragging the United States into a military quagmire in Yemen to the detriment of U.S. troops, the stability of the region, and the people of Yemen. Instead of relying on counterproductive military actions that risk escalating into a new, unwinnable war, the U.S. must adopt a more effective and non-violent approach to this conflict—one which gets to its root cause.\nA ceasefire in Gaza is urgently needed for many reasons, most pressingly to end the appalling humanitarian disaster that’s been created by Israel’s massive, indiscriminate bombing of civilians. But it’s also the only step that’s proven effective in ending these attacks by Iran-backed militias in the past. And it’s the only reasonable step forward now.",
