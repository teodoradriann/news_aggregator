    "title": "Neck Protection Q-and-A with Manager of Player Safety Kevin Margarucci",
    "text": "Following the tragic death of the Hibbing, Minnesota native and Nottingham Panthers player Adam Johnson, hockey governing bodies, associations and leagues around the world have started taking hard looks at their equipment requirements and overall approaches around player safety.\nIn early November, USA Hockey announced that its Board of Directors unanimously voted to request that the USA Hockey Safety and Protective Equipment Committee begin the process of recommending potential rule changes regarding neck laceration protection. While any potential rule change proposals could be addressed as early as USA Hockey’s Winter Meeting in January 2024, some NHL, college and USHL players have already begun the practice of wearing protective neck and wrist protection on their own, while some local youth hockey districts have required them as well.\nWhile it is very likely that more widespread policies on this issue will come to fruition, the decision to change the rule and to implement it quickly isn’t as simple as many might think.\nKevin Margarucci, USA Hockey’s manager of player safety, who has more than 25 years of experience as a certified athletic trainer and serves on the executive committee for the Hockey Equipment Certification Council, shared his thoughts on the issue with USA Hockey.\nUSA Hockey: Is there anything that can be done to prevent these kinds of tragic accidents from happening in the first place?\nMargarucci: In general, protective equipment is one way; better on-ice awareness is another. But no one piece of equipment will provide zero risk of injury. These types of accidents are not common, but obviously tragic when they do occur.\nUSA Hockey: Currently, USA Hockey does not require players to wear neck laceration protectors. Do you see that policy changing?\nMargarucci: The Board recently requested that the safety committee look at potential rule changes regarding neck laceration protectors. We don’t know yet what the scope of a rule change would look like. Any rule change proposal that may come out of our ongoing discussions could be addressed as early as our Winter Meetings in January. As an organization, we do recommend that all players wear a neck laceration protector that covers as much of the neck area as possible, in addition to cut-resistant socks, sleeves or undergarments.\nUSA Hockey: How easy or difficult would it be to implement such a rule? What needs to be considered?\nMargarucci: Things to consider are who it impacts, what age levels, how it is enforced and when it goes into effect. One of the biggest questions now is about the current inventory of these products, which is very low. Also, there are different styles of neck laceration protectors, and not every style is right for every person. So, finding the right style and size, which covers as much of the neck as possible is important when selecting this piece of equipment. With the size of our membership and the demand for these items sure to grow if there was a rule change, as we aren’t the only organization having these conversations, that creates a supply issue. I know the equipment companies are trying to obtain materials to get on the market, and there are some back orders in place. So, these are the things being discussed.\nUSA Hockey: We’ve seen some professional players and college teams make the change to wearing neck protectors (though the NHL currently does not require them). Do you see this widespread change coming any time soon?\nMargarucci: The discussions are definitely being had on a variety of different levels. How broad that change may be is yet to be known. Recent incidents have certainly heightened the attention to cut-resistant materials, but the full scope of where that leads remains to be seen.\nUSA Hockey: For parents out there who might not be sure how to react to this issue, what would you say to them about what it can/should mean for their own situation?\nMargarucci: It is up to each individual family to determine whether their child should wear additional protective equipment. As an organization, our current recommendation is for players to wear a neck laceration protector that covers as much of the neck as possible, along with cut-resistant sleeves, socks, or undergarments.",

Además del ingreso de aire cálido y húmedo del Golfo de México, canales de baja presión en el interior del país, inestabilidad en niveles altos de la atmósfera, y el ingreso de humedad de los litorales y de un nuevo frente frío asociado con una vaguada polar al noroeste del país, en interacción con las corrientes en chorro polar y subtropical. El último reporte del SMN prevé para el sábado lluvias de fuertes a intensas en 10 de los 32 estados de México. En Chiapas y Quintana Roo se esperan lluvias muy fuertes, de 50 a 75 milímetros (mm), además de fuertes, de entre 25 a 50 mm en Estado de México, Guerrero, Michoacán, Puebla, Oaxaca, Tabasco, Veracruz y Yucatán.

Además de oleaje de 1 a 2 metros de altura en la costa occidental de la península de Baja California y la costa de Quintana Roo. El SMN advirtió que las precipitaciones de mayor intensidad podrían acompañarse de descargas eléctricas y posible granizo; y podrían generar encharcamientos, incremento en los niveles de ríos y arroyos, así como deslaves e inundaciones en zonas bajas de los estados mencionados. El organismo advirtió que los vientos fuertes podrían derribar árboles y anuncios publicitarios, por lo que exhortó a la población a atender los avisos del SMN, de la Conagua, y seguir las recomendaciones de Protección Civil. Finalmente, anticipó un descenso de temperatura en el noroeste de México, y nieve o aguanieve en las sierras del norte de Baja California, con estimados de -10 a -5 grados Celsius y heladas durante la madrugada del sábado.

    "text": "(CNN) — A former Mississippi police officer was sentenced to a year in federal prison followed by a year of supervised release along with fines and assessments for forcing a man who he arrested to lick urine off the holding cell floor.\nMichael Christian Green was sentenced to the maximum penalty for a federal misdemeanor for acting under color of law to deprive a person of their civil rights. The former Pearl Police Department officer\nplead guilty in March and is scheduled to report to the Federal Bureau of Prisons on July 26.\nGreen worked for the Pearl Police Department for six months after working at other law enforcement agencies in Jackson, Mississippi. Pearl is in the same county where\nsix White former law enforcement officers, some of whom called themselves the “Goon Squad,” were sentenced on federal and state charges after pleading guilty to a racist assault on two innocent Black men.\nGreen responded to a disturbance at a Sam’s Club on December 23, 2023, and arrested a man, according to the complaint. Once the man was booked, security footage from the holding cell showed him trying to tell Green he needed to urinate, the federal prosecutor wrote in the complaint. After not receiving a response, the man urinated in a corner. When Green was later told about the urine, he demanded the arrestee lick the urine, threatening to beat him with a phone, the complaint said.\nWhile standing in the doorway of the holding cell, Green commanded the man to get on the ground and “suck it up,” according to the complaint, then “removed his phone from his duty vest and filmed” the man, who complied. Green resigned on December 27.\nGreen testified in federal court during his sentencing hearing and took responsibility for his actions and said he regrets what he did.\nCNN reached out to Green’s attorney for comment.\n“The City of Pearl, while not the sentencing body on this case, is glad to have this part of our recent history put behind us,” the municipality said in a statement. “The actions of Michael Green were reprehensible and inexcusable, and we have been deeply grieved to have been associated with this incident. We hope that this sentencing can help the victim and his family in their healing process, and we’re grateful to our federal partners who helped bring this terrible incident to justice swiftly.”\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.
