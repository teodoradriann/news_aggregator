    "title": "'My peanut allergy nearly killed me - now I eat them every day'",
    "text": "'My peanut allergy nearly killed me - now I eat them every day for breakfast'\nChris Brookes-Smith, 28, used to live in fear of dying from eating even the smallest trace of peanut.\nTen years ago he had his worst allergic reaction after ordering a curry at a local Indian takeaway. The trauma of it is seared into his memory.\n\"I knew I was in trouble after one bite,\" he says. \"Within seconds there were spots on my lips. Within minutes I was vomiting. I could feel my throat closing up, hives forming in my armpits then over my whole body... My face going all puffy with the swelling.\"\nHis voice tails off, full of emotion.\n\"I thought I was going to die.\"\nPhotos taken in hospital later that day show the toll the reaction took on his body.\n\"I looked like a plucked turkey because my skin had blistered so much,\" Chris says.\nBut the most painful thing were the hives - red, raised bumps on the skin - which felt \"like boiling water had been poured over me\".\nTrying to avoid peanuts, one of the most common food allergies, has been a way of life for Chris and millions of other adults with a serious allergy. Eating out, going to social events and travelling abroad are all fraught with anxiety.\nAs many as one in 200 adults and one in 50 children have a nut allergy, charities say. Some children grow out of their allergies, but many don't - and they continue into adulthood, often getting worse.\nAn allergic reaction occurs when the body reacts to the protein in peanuts, thinking it's a threat, which triggers a sudden release of chemicals. Symptoms can range from the mild to very serious.\nChris's allergy first came to light as a baby, when he developed a rash as his mum made peanut butter sandwiches.\nEach reaction since has been worse than the one before, which means he's become accustomed to living every day \"on high alert hoping nothing bad happens\".\nActivities such as going out with friends or eating in restaurants, which should be enjoyable, turned into stressful, potentially life-threatening experiences.\nDespite a love of travel, Chris avoided going to countries where peanuts are commonly used, like south east Asia, after three allergic reactions on a trip to Italy.\nAs Chris grew up, his family constantly worried about him. But then his mum heard about a clinical trial at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London that would change her son's life.\nIt would test whether adults like Chris with serious peanut allergies could be desensitised by training their bodies to tolerate the very thing that could kill it, calming down the immune system when it would usually over-react.\nDespite being \"really nervous\", Chris agreed to sign up.\nFrom milligrams to whole nuts\nUnder the watchful eye of doctors, Chris started by eating a fraction of a milligram of peanut powder mixed with yoghurt. Over many months, the amount of peanut was gradually increased, slowly building up to Chris eating fractions of nuts and, finally, whole nuts.\nBy the end of the nine-month study, 14 of the 21 patients could eat the equivalent of five peanuts without having allergic reactions - including Chris.\nProfessor Stephen Till, who led the research, says the treatment \"has potential to have a real impact on patients' lives\".\n\"Most severe reactions occur because of mistakes, usually by somebody else, and miscommunication. So it provides them with some protection against that.\n\"They've taken control, if you like, of their peanut allergy now.\"\nThe method - called oral immunotherapy - is already proven to work for allergies to pollen, wasp and bee stings. It's only been used on food allergies in the last 20 years, and mostly in children whose immune systems are still developing. Adult allergies are thought to be harder to shift.\n\"Peanut allergy is very common in children and almost never goes away,\" says Prof Till. \"Those young people are going to become adults, so we need treatments for adults too.\"\nThis trial, published in the journal Allergy, shows adults with serious allergies can increase the amount of peanut they can tolerate by 100 times.\nChris had no idea how he would react to even the slightest trace of peanut. Increasing that dose - willingly - every day was something he couldn't imagine.\n\"The first time I went there and I ingest this stuff, my heart's going a million miles an hour,\" he says. \"The big jump in fear was going from peanut dust to half a whole nut.\"\nBut he was reassured by having a team of doctors and nurses present, with drugs such as adrenaline standing by in case of a severe, life-threatening reaction.\n\"You've got 100 eyes on you - nothing is gonna happen.\"\nHowever, experts stress no one should try this at home on their own because of the risk of a serious allergic reaction occurring.\n'Wonderful feeling'\nNot everyone who tried the treatment was desensitised, and larger trials in more people will have to work out why that is.\n\"For some people, there were reactions and we had to slow down or go back a step,\" explains Prof Till. \"But the message is that you can desensitise adults to peanuts -and there should be more focus on adults in the future.\"\nBeing able to eat peanuts safely had a huge impact on the lives of those who took part, the researchers say. It has given them freedom to travel, reduced their anxiety when eating out and removed their fear of food.\nHow to develop this into a practical treatment on the NHS is more of a challenge. First, larger trials are needed to prove it can work for more people.\nAnd researchers are looking at whether putting drops of peanut in solution under the tongue could be a safer way of achieving the same end result.\nChris now eats four peanuts every morning with his breakfast granola to keep his allergy at bay – as recommended by his doctors.\nHe's grateful for having had the opportunity to take part in the trial and hopes many others with serious peanut allergies can also benefit from the treatment.\nWhile he admits he still hates the flavour of peanuts, he says knowing he can now eat something that once sent his body into \"nuclear meltdown\" has changed his life.\n\"It's a wonderful feeling,\" Chris says. \"I'm no longer afraid of dying.\"",

    "text": "Shemar Moore is making more fans swoon. On a Wednesday episode of \" The Jennifer Hudson Show ,\" the Hollywood heartthrob heated up the daytime talker. \"That's the thing about being in the game 30 years ... my baby girls just, you know, they getting older and older but they're staying strong,\" Moore said of his fans, before remarking he is always \"taking off my shirt and counting my six-pack\" before flashing his abs to cheers from the crowd. \"Calm down. everybody. She about to fall out the chair! Help her!\" Hudson joked, while pointing to a member of the audience. Then, the pair went into the audience to meet some of Moore's fans. Things then took an interesting turn when Hudson invited one audience member to meet Moore, who embraced her. The audience member told Hudson, \"Girl, I'm going to faint.\" Later, she touched his abs after the star lifted up his shirt once again. \"We about to get our cuddle on,\" Moore joked when the woman gifted him a pillow with his face on it. After Hudson called another audience member, Dina, down to the front, Moore asked, \"How you doing beautiful?\" and Dina responded, \"He's going home with me.\" Then, Moore grabbed her face and the duo shared a smooch. J Hud's jaw dropped as she pointed out that Dina was \"trembling\" and fanned the audience member with cue cards. \"My husband's going to see that,\" Dina told Hudson. Shemar Moore kiss isn't the only surprise he's shared with Jennifer Hudson Last January, the \"Criminal Minds\" star, 52, announced that he was having a child on \" https://youtu.be/n2Hn3s9kws8.\" Moore told the host Wednesday that the three-year anniversary of his mother Marilyn Joan Wilson-Moore 's death is on Feb. 8, and he made \"one of her dreams come true\" by becoming \"a daddy.\" He welcomed his daughter Frankie with girlfriend Jesiree Dizon last January. Shemar Moore is expecting his first baby at 52, says he worried 'that ship had sailed' Moore later shared a video on Instagram of the gender reveal with Dizon. “I honestly just want whatever is healthy, happy, like (Shemar) says, 10 fingers, 10 toes,\" Dizon told the camera. \"I’m just so excited for this portion of our life together, and it’s going to be amazing.\" Contributing: Naledi Ushe",

    "text": "Biden issues order targeting Israeli settlers who attack West Bank Palestinians Updated February 1, 2024 at 4:37 PM ET President Biden issued an executive order on Thursday targeting Israeli settlers in the West Bank who have been attacking Palestinians in the occupied territory. The order named four people and will lay the groundwork for financial sanctions against settlers who carry out violent assaults, which have increased since Hamas launched an attack on Israel three months ago, triggering a full-scale war in Gaza. The order will not target U.S. citizens, who make up a significant number of the settler community. The Biden administration had issued an order late last year imposing travel bans on Israeli settlers who had attacked Palestinians. While only four people are named, the order marks the first time that the U.S. has targeted Israeli settlers with the threat of frozen assets and bank accounts in an attempt to rein in settler attacks on Palestinians living in the West Bank, which Palestinians see as the central plank of a future Palestinian state. \"This violence poses a grave threat to peace, security, and stability in the West Bank, Israel, and the Middle East region, and threatens the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States,\" White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in a statement. There have been almost 500 attacks by settlers on Palestinians in the West Bank, which is largely under Israeli-military occupation, since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, according to the United Nations. Some Palestinians have been killed in these attacks while settlers have also attacked property and torched cars, the Palestinian authorities and human right groups say. Three of the four men named in Thursday's executive order have been prosecuted by Israeli authorities, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters on Thursday. One of the four men cited in the order, Shalom Zicherman, was indicted by Israeli police on assault and damage charges in 2022, after he was filmed attacking left-wing Israeli activists near Hebron, in the southern West Bank, as they traveled to join a demonstration in protest at Palestinians being evicted from their homes, [according to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz.](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2022-06-20/ty-article/.premium/israeli-settler-indicted-for-throwing-stones-at-left-wing-activists/ 181-800a-da88-afef-d5cee72b0000) Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded to the announcement on Thursday, saying, \"Israel acts against all those who break the law everywhere, and therefore there is no room for exceptional measures in this regard.\" But Dror Etkes, an Israeli expert in settler violence, welcomed the news. \"The fact that these people are walking free and they are in the West Bank and can do what they want to do is an indication that the law enforcement system in Israel... prefers not to deal with this type of people,\" he told NPR. \"This is why we came to the point that the American administration is, you know, is sanctioning them,\" he said, adding that all four had been \"involved in severe violent attacks against Palestinians.\" Israel's Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who himself lives in a settlement in the West Bank, [said on X, formerly known as Twitter](https://twitter.com/bezalelsm/status/1753093343507005858?s=46), that \"the 'settler violence campaign is an anti-Semitic lie spread by Israel's enemies with the aim of discrediting the pioneer settlers.\" Copyright 2024 NPR.

Sólo un pequeño porcentaje de estos plásticos es reciclado mientras que el resto termina en el medio ambiente fragmentándose en microplásticos y nanoplásticos.\nEstas partículas ya se encuentran en todos los ecosistemas y provienen de diversas fuentes como neumáticos, ropa, material agrícola y productos de cuidado personal. Además, tanto microplásticos como nanoplásticos pueden ser transportados fácilmente por el aire y el agua, acumulándose en suelos y masas de agua.\nSon ingeridos por organismos acuáticos, causando efectos negativos como inflamación y alteraciones metabólicas, lo que termina afectando a la postre tanto a la salud de los ecosistemas, como la salud humana, ha indicado la UJA en un comunicado.\nJaén, entre las provincias con mayor mortalidad asociada al IAM\nLa provincia de Jaén se caracteriza por su agricultura intensiva, particularmente en la industria olivarera. El uso de envases y equipos plásticos en la aplicación de pesticidas contribuye a la presencia de MPs y NPs en los campos agrícolas, que se dispersan por el viento y el agua, lo que supone un riesgo tanto para los ecosistemas como para la salud humana.\nLos investigadores consideran que la provincia de Jaén, dada su alta exposición a agroquímicos, es un lugar ideal para investigar la relación entre la presencia de MPs y NPs en el ambiente y la salud cardiovascular.\nPor otro lado, Jaén se encuentra entre las provincias con mayor mortalidad asociada al infarto agudo de miocardio (IAM) en España, ocupando la 12ª posición en tasa de mortalidad por esta causa por cada 100.000 habitantes.\nPor este motivo, a través de dicho proyecto, los investigadores pretenden estudiar la presencia de MPs y NPs en sangre de personas que hayan y que no hayan sufrido un infarto, con el propósito de determinar si la presencia de estos contaminantes se correlaciona con eventos cardiacos graves.\n\"Estos contaminantes son un problema grave y emergente, pues los humanos estamos expuestos a ellos principalmente por ingestión e inhalación. Esto provoca su acumulación en órganos y tejidos, alterando procesos biológicos esenciales y sirviendo como vectores de sustancias tóxicas como metales pesados, lo que puede inducir estrés oxidativo, inflamación y disrupción endocrina en humanos\", afirma Jorge Nicolás Domínguez Macías, profesor de Biología Celular de la UJA.\nEn concreto, un aspecto de gran interés es la relación entre la exposición a MPs y NPsy enfermedades cardiovasculares, ya que un estudio reciente ha mostrado una posible asociación con enfermedades cardiovasculares graves.\nAunque existen algunos estudios, la investigación sobre los efectos nocivos de MPs y NPs en humanos es aún limitada y los trabajos existentes utilizan principalmente modelos animales, lo que supone la necesidad de más estudios epidemiológicos con pacientes para comprender completamente el impacto de los MPs y NPs en la salud humana.\nDe ahí la importancia de este estudio, que según explica el investigador de la UJA \"es pionero en su enfoque, buscando identificar los MPs y NPs como agentes relevantes en la etiología de las enfermedades cardiovasculares, lo que podría ayudar a desarrollar estrategias de prevención y tratamiento, así como a concienciar sobre los riesgos de los contaminantes ambientales\".\n[Las entidades tendrán que declarar a Hacienda los pagos realizados con una tarjeta si el total supera los 25.000 euros al año](https://www.elperiodico.com/es/politica/20250108/entidades-informar-hacienda-pagos-tarjeta-bizum-113190074)[El quemagrasas perfecto': así es el suplemento más recomendado para acabar con la grasa localizada](https://www.elperiodico.com/es/shopping/20250108/suplemento-perder-peso-grasa-rapido-fatburner-113215958)[El hijo de Maite Galdeano se sincera sobre su situación actual tras ser repudiado por su madre: 'Las peores navidades de mi vida](https://www.elperiodico.com/es/gente/20250107/hijo-maite-galdeano-sincera-situacion-actual-repudiado-madre-peores-navidades-vida-dv-113179191)[Los psiquiatras cargan contra TVE por hablar de forma 'irresponsable' sobre enfermedades mentales](https://www.elperiodico.com/es/ser-feliz/20250107/psiquiatras-cargan-tve-hablar-forma-113161028)[El Meteocat avisa: así será la nueva borrasca que congelará Catalunya tras el paso de Floriane](https://www.elperiodico.com/es/tiempo/20250108/tiempo-meteocat-cataluna-borrasca-nieve-lluvias-frio-dv-113199784)[España ya negocia con los supermercados el despliegue de la devolución de envases para 2026](https://www.elperiodico.com/es/sociedad/20250108/espana-trabaja-convencer-supermercados-sistema-devolucion-envases-113160515)[VÍDEO | Miedo en La Mina y balas en los pisos tras un tiroteo entre dos familias: 'Fueron cinco minutos interminables](https://www.elperiodico.com/es/barcelona/20250108/video-intenso-tiroteo-pasada-noche-barrio-la-mina-113197590)[La línea R3 de Rodalies estará 10 meses cortada para terminar el desdoblamiento de vías entre Parets y la Garriga](https://www.elperiodico.com/es/sociedad/20250108/r3-rodalies-estara-10-meses-cortada-para-terminar-desdoblamiento-vias-entre-parets-la-garriga-113201254)",

Just be prepared to spend $20 to get this new gun.\nCall of Duty games released in the last few years have frustrated fans with a prompt asking them to restart the game due to an update. This message often appears before jumping into the main menu. While on console this restart might only take a few seconds, PC players might have to wait a minute or more before they can start playing. It’s been a problem since at least 2020 and is still a thing in MWIII and battle royale spin-off Warzone. The message has become so ubiquitous over the years that it has become a meme within the CoD community. And Activision is ready to laugh at itself while taking some money from you, too.\nRead more\nRam Will Still Sell You A Brand-New, 16-Year-Old Truck\nThese Are The Black Celebs Who Were Named On Jeffrey Epstein's List\nSeth MacFarlane Just Gave New Hope to Orville Fans Across the Galaxy\nGoogle Just Disabled Cookies for 30 Million Chrome Users.

And it even features pixelated muzzle smoke, which is a nice touch.\nOnce again Call of Duty keeps tempting me with cool retro video game skins and weapons, like that Doom shotgun from last year .
