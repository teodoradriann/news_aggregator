    "text": "Política 28-12-2023 18:41 - \"beneficia a la medicina prepaga\" La Federación de Médicos rechazó el DNU y dijo que perjudicará la salud pública La entidad argumenta que el decreto promueve la liberación de los precios de sus cuotas y permite a los afiliados redireccionar de forma directa sus aportes de salud a esas empresas. La titular de la Federación Sindical de Profesionales de la Salud (Fesprosa), María Boriotti, rechazó este jueves el decreto de necesidad y urgencia (DNU) del Gobierno nacional por considerar que beneficia a las empresas de medicina prepaga y perjudica a la salud pública y a los trabajadores del sector. \"El 90% de los argentinos no se atiende en una prepaga y más de 20 millones tiene Cobertura Pública Exclusiva (CPE) en los 1.700 hospitales y 6 mil unidades sanitarias\", dijo la dirigente. La también jefa del Sindicato de Profesionales Universitarios de la Sanidad de Santa Fe (Siprus) sostuvo en un comunicado que \"el conglomerado de empresas prepagas asciende a poco más de 600 y ofrece cobertura médica a 5 millones de argentinos, o sea solo el 10%\". El DNU promueve la liberación de los precios de sus cuotas y permite a los afiliados redireccionar de forma directa sus aportes de salud a esas empresas. \"El 70% de los usuarios del sistema público es pobre y no solo tiene CPE sino que muchos no tienen cobertura de seguridad social. Ese sistema público estatal está creciendo en productividad a pesar de su crónica crisis de financiamiento. En 2013 se realizaron 110 millones de consultas ambulatorias y, en 2019, 150 millones\", enfatizó la dirigente. Según Boriotti, el 80% de la financiación del sistema público está a cargo de las provincias y los municipios (65% y 15%, respectivamente), por lo que \"el efecto de la restricción de los recursos coparticipables será devastador\", y añadió que \"el 20% que aporta el Ministerio de Salud nacional tendrá, según el Gobierno, el presupuesto congelado en los niveles de 2023, lo que significa devaluarlo en un 140%\". Consideró que ello afectará los programas de vacunación, salud reproductiva, sida, tuberculosis, oncológicos y otros, y advirtió que de forma previsible \"el descreme programado de la cartera de las obras sociales y la caída del salario real impactará de lleno en el nivel prestacional de la seguridad social, lo que significará que la rueda de auxilio -siempre fue el sector público- deberá funcionar al doble y sin recursos\", afirmó. \"Las prepagas, entonces, absorberán a los usuarios de salarios altos y deglutirán a las prepagas pequeñas, concentrando aún más el mercado\", dijo, y afirmó que \"el complejo médico industrial financiador y prestador será el gran ganador y, los usuarios del sector público -trabajadores en blanco de ingresos medios y bajos y los jubilados-, serán los perdedores\", puntualizó. Boriotti incluyó entre esos perdedores al medio millón de trabajadores de la salud pública, a quienes el Gobierno, dijo además, pretende cercenar \"el derecho de huelga\".",

    "title": "Varadkar: Violent crime 'not the majority or the norm' in Dublin city centre | Newstalk",
    "text": "The majority of people still feel safe in Dublin city centre, the Taoiseach has insisted. Crime in the capital has been one of the main issues facing the Government this year and [last month’s Dublin riots](https://www.newstalk.com/news/complete-chaos-law-and-order-was-completely-gone-riots-cause-mayhem-in-dublin-1617547) were seen as a tipping point by many. Meanwhile, a recent study by business group Dublin Town earlier this year found that more people now feel unsafe in the city than did in 2016. Speaking at a pre-Christmas briefing, Leo Varadkar said most people still have positive experiences in Dublin. “Of course I am concerned about individual negative experiences people have in Dublin or anywhere else,” he said. “That is something you are very aware of and very exposed to as a politician – like somebody who would have, maybe, a very bad experience of our health service but I am also aware of the huge number of people who have a very positive experience of our health service for example, and say so when surveyed. “The same thing applies to people coming into town, coming into our cities and coming into our country.” Three Garda cars, three buses and a Luas tram were set on fire as the city centre descended into chaos during the Dublin riots – with Gardaí attacked and shops looted. The riots broke out after protesters gathered at the scene of a [knife attack on three young children and a teacher](https://www.newstalk.com/news/parnell-square-eyewitness-describes-complete-and-utter-pandemonium-after-attack-1617409) near a school on Parnell Square became violent. The incidents saw the Government moving to [supply Gardaí with more equipment](https://www.newstalk.com/news/gardai-are-operating-on-the-basis-weekend-may-bring-more-riots-varadkar-1617732) and fast-tracking legislation that would enable Gardaí to make better use of facial recognition technology. Mr Varadkar said politicians and media outlets have a responsibility to remember that the majority of people still have positive experiences in the capital. “Most people thankfully don’t experience being victims of violent crime in Dublin or anywhere else,” he said. “While it is really important that we listen to and acknowledge the stories of people who have a very bad experience, we have a responsibility as politicians and journalists not to make the mistake of thinking that bad experiences are the majority or the norm.” The Dublin Town survey showed that the perception of safety in Dublin began to decline before the pandemic began and has continued to fall in the years since. The number of people who said they felt safe in the evening time in north central Dublin fell from 51% in 2016 to just 35% in May of this year.",

Incidents in Bangladesh and atrocities in Pakistan remind us of the sacrifices of the Sikh Gurus… The ideals of the Sikh Gurus provide us with the energy to move forward. Their blessings serve as our inspiration. By carrying forward their legacy, we can prevent situations like those in Kabul and Bangladesh. Places like Nankana Sahib will come to us naturally, without the need for agitation or struggle,” he said.\nThe event to mark the Veer Bal Diwas saw the commencement of 11,000 Sahaj Paaths.\n“Today, this event has grown into a national observance. On this day, two Sahibzaades of Guru Gobind Singh—Baba Zorawar Singh and Fateh Singh—were walled up alive by Wazir Khan.”\nRecounting the sacrifices made during the Battle of Chamkaur, where Guru Gobind Singh’s sons, Baba Ajit Singh and Baba Jujhar Singh, attained martyrdom, Adityanath said: “Guru Nanak Dev was the first to stand against Babar’s atrocities. Guru Arjun Dev’s martyrdom in Lahore was to protect India from Jahangir’s tyranny. Guru Teg Bahadur sacrificed his life but upheld India’s honor, ensuring that Kashmir remained an integral part of India. Guru Gobind Singh Ji Maharaj witnessed the ultimate sacrifice of his sons and father for the nation.”\nThe Chief Minister emphasized that the history of Sikh Gurus, from Guru Nanak Dev to Guru Gobind Singh Maharaj, the four Sahibzaades, and the Panch Pyaras, is a testament to their martyrdom for the country and religion. “This history is not just of the Sikh community, but of the entire nation, serving as a profound inspiration for all Indians,” he stated.\nRecalling the historical significance of [Lucknow](https://indianexpress.com/section/cities/lucknow/), he said, “Lucknow is fortunate that Guru Teg Bahadur ji had come here with Guru Gobind Singh. To honor this heritage, a comprehensive plan for the beautification of associated Gurudwaras should be prepared in collaboration with the Municipal Corporation.”\nHe assured financial support from the state government and urged coordinated efforts.\nYou want to be the smartest in the room.\nYou want access to our award-winning journalism.\nYou don’t want to be misled and misinformed.",
