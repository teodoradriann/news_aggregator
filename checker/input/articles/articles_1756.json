    "text": "Gov. Kathy Hochul announced in a media release, the launch of New York’s inaugural first responder mental health needs assessment to better understand the mental health-related challenges facing the public safety community and strengthen programs and services for these professionals. The project stems from a partnership between the state Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services and SUNY New Paltz’s Institute for Disaster Mental Health and Benjamin Center, the release said. The assessment will include results from a voluntary anonymous survey and input from law enforcement, the fire service, EMTs, 911 dispatchers and emergency managers. Officials from DHSES and SUNY New Paltz will deliver the results of the assessment at the 19th Annual Institute for Disaster Mental Health Conference at the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park on May 14 and May 15. “As we continue to make historic investments in mental health care, it is critical that we engage with communities of first responders, who suffer disproportionately from mental health related challenges,” Hochul said in the release. “Our state is only as strong as the network of individuals who keep us safe, and this comprehensive needs assessment will help us provide them with the care and resources they deserve.” In addition to these initiatives, the state Office of Mental Health is partnering with the Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services and the Institute for Disaster Mental Health to develop a disaster mental health response statewide, the release said. Disaster mental health responders may be activated to support disaster response operations and provide a compassionate presence, immediate psychological first aid and additional support as needed to address the early and expected stress reactions to disasters. OMH is leveraging federal funding to further develop and train the disaster mental health team, with plans underway to help develop and support local and regional teams, the release said. Likewise, DHSES has been working with OMH and the institute to identify additional first responder mental health-related training opportunities, including peer-to-peer courses offered at the State Preparedness Training Center. Peer support teams include individuals with lived experience to provide emotional, social and practical support when needed, the release said. Peer support teams are often used within public safety organizations to help individuals deal with job-related stress and following critical incidents. Last week, the training center hosted two peer support team training sessions – Assisting Individuals in Crisis and Group Crisis Intervention — in Oriskany, the release said. Both sessions reached capacity and additional trainings will be offered later this year.",

    "text": "The General Association of the German Insurance Industry (GDV) has reported that damage caused by extreme weather events in the country, such as floods and storms in 2023 total €4.9 billion. Jörg Asmussen, General Manager of the GDV, commented: “The insured damage to houses, household goods, businesses and motor vehicles is expected to have increased by 900 million euros to 4.9 billion euros in 2023 compared to the previous year.” Adding: “Unfortunately, they are pretty stable at the high level of the long-term average of 4.9 billion euros.” According to the GDV, property insurance accounted for damages amounting to €3.6 billion : €2.7 billion for damage caused by storms and hail, and €900 million for other natural hazards such as floods as a result of heavy rain. As for motor insurers, 2023 was above average with around 465,000 claims totaling €1.3 billion. Reflecting on the year, there was largely no major damage caused from winter and autumn storms, however, things were very different in the summer. August alone, witnessed severe storms that winded up causing insured damages [that amounted to €1.5 billion,](https://www.reinsurancene.ws/gdv-reports-e1-5bn-of-insured-natural-disaster-losses-in-august/) almost a third of the total damage. At the same time, property insurers were affected by €950 million and motor vehicle insurers by €550 million. GDV noted that the storms “Kay” and “Lambert” had already caused severe damage amounting to €740 million in June. From this figure, €390 million went to property insurance and the remaining €350 million went towards motor insurers. Moreover, it is important to remember, that with natural hazard insurance, property owners can insure themselves against other natural hazards, such as flooding as a result of heavy rain. “Many property owners are unaware of the natural hazards that threaten their homes. They therefore forego this existential security, even though sufficient insurance cover is offered,” added Asmussen. However, GDV warned that this insurance coverage could become more expensive in the future as a result of climate change and a lack of adaptation to climate impacts. “In many places, things are being planned and built as if climate change and its consequences didn’t exist,” said Asmussen. “We therefore need adaptation to climate change to be anchored in building regulations, less surface sealing and building bans in flood areas.”",

    "text": "[](https://ambcrypto.com/chainlink-is-another-rally-in-the-works-for-link/) [Altcoin](https://ambcrypto.com/category/altcoins-news/) LINK and MKR stir investor interest: Here’s why - LINK was up by 12% in the last 24 hours, but a few market indicators were bearish. - MKR’s market indicators looked bullish, as they suggested a price rise. As we enter the concluding days of 2023, several tokens, such as [Chainlink [LINK]](https://ambcrypto.com/search/link) and [Maker [MKR],](https://ambcrypto.com/search/maker) are witnessing newfound interest, as several new wallets started to accumulate those tokens. Whenever accumulation rises, it increases the possibility of a price uptick. Therefore, considering the latest interest from investors, are LINK and MKR on the brink of a new rally? Buying pressure on Chainlink and Maker rises On the 27th of December, Lookonchain recently posted a tweet, which highlighted that fresh wallets have started to accumulate LINK and MKR. Notably, whale wallet 0xE68E withdrew 3,150 MKR worth more than $4.5 million, while another wallet withdrew 136,146 MKR worth over $2 million. Fresh whale wallets are accumulating [$MKR]and [$LINK]today. 0xE68E withdrew 3,150 [$MKR]($4.55M) from [#Binance]in the past 20 minutes. [https://t.co/LRuLN0j4Ia] 0x8eAD withdrew 136,146 [$LINK]($2.05M) from [#Binance]10 minutes ago and has withdrawn 384,006 [$LINK]($5.79M) from [#Binance]… [pic.twitter.com/fjCp1lo0Nx] — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) [December 27, 2023] Therefore, to better understand whether investors at large were buying these tokens, AMBCrypto took a look at Santiment’s data. As per our analysis, [LINK](https://ambcrypto.com/chainlink-is-another-rally-in-the-works-for-link/)’s Supply on Exchanges registered a drop while its Supply outside of Exchanges increased. Surprisingly, despite a hike in buying pressure, Chainlink’s supply held by the top addresses remained flat. A similar trend was visible on Maker’s graph. AMBCrypto’s analysis revealed that MKR’s Supply on Exchanges registered a massive drop on the 27th of December while its Supply outside of Exchanges surged considerably. This meant that investors were actively buying MKR at press time. Additionally, whales’ confidence in the token also increased, which was evident from the rise in its supply held by top addresses. However, the graph registered a decline soon after that. Will the coins have a positive impact? To better understand whether the hike in buying pressure would have any positive impact on both tokens’ price actions, AMBCrypto took a look at their daily charts. Our analysis found that Chainlink’s MACD displayed a bullish crossover. Additionally, its Bollinger Bands also hinted that LINK’s price was entering a comparatively volatile zone, which looked bullish. However, its Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) registered downticks, implying that a price drop is on the cards. In the last 24 hours, LINK was up over 12% and, at press time, was [trading](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/chainlink/) at $17.04. Read [Maker’s [MKR] Price Prediction](https://ambcrypto.com/predictions/maker-price-prediction) 2023-24 Like LINK, MKR’s MACD also displayed a clear bullish upper hand in the market, and its Bollinger Bands also looked optimistic. [MKR](https://ambcrypto.com/makerdao-closes-the-year-with-this-milestone/)’s CMF and RSI also went northwards, increasing the chances of a price uptick. According to CoinMarketCap, MKR was up by 2% in the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, it was trading at $1,599.01 with a market cap of over $1.4 billion.",

    "text": "NAPOLI, 08 AGO – Divieto di accesso e di permanenza nella Vela celeste di Scampia, dove si verificò il crollo del 22 luglio nel quale tre persone sono morte ed altre 13 (ta cui 7 bambini) sono rimaste ferite: è quanto dispone un’ordinanza del sindaco di Napoli, Gaetano Manfredi. Nell’ordinanza si premette che il Comune di Napoli è proprietario dell’immobile e che i vigili del fuoco, all’indomani del crollo, hanno decretato in via precauzionale l’inagibilità dell’intero complesso della Vela celeste interessata da uno “stato di diffuso degrado”. Da qui la decisione dello sgombero di tutti gli occupanti. Ieri, poi, il responsabile dell’Area tecnica patrimonio ha giudicato “inutilizzabile” e “inagibile” il complesso, considerati gli esiti delle indagini tecniche sullo stato delle passerelle e delle scale in acciaio, del “definitivo distacco elettrico di tutti gli allacci abusivi rinvenuti preso i vani contatori dell’edificio” (attuato ieri) e della necessità di eseguire ulteriori accertamenti per gli altri impianti. Sulla base di tutto ciò, e considerato che nella Vela celeste “sono evidenziate criticità ascrivibili alla mancanza di elementi essenziali per la sicurezza che determinano pericolo per la pubblica e privata incolumità”, il dirigente del servizio Politiche della casa del Comune ha chiesto al sindaco di emanare l’ordinanza. Questa vieta a chiunque di accedere o permanere nel complesso di proprietà del Comune “per motivi urgenti e contingibili di sicurezza pubblica a causa dei rischi che minacciano la pubblica e privata incolumità e per garantire la sicurezza urbana”. Potrà entrarvi solo chi deve recuperare effetti personali, previa richiesta agli uffici comunali: i cittadini, in questo caso, dovranno essere accompagnati dai vigili del fuoco e dalla Polizia locale.",

    "text": "Norma Dumont explains why UFC Noche was no different as Las Vegas unbeaten streak extended\nEXCLUSIVE: Norma Dumont grew her winning streak to five with a unanimous decision victory over Irene Aldana at UFC Noche and has never lost a fight in Las Vegas\nNorma Dumont walked away from UFC Noche victorious, continuing her streak to five in a row and advancing to a 12-2 record. Both fighters predicted an all-out war between two ranked UFC bantamweights, with the Brazillian and\n[Irene Aldana](/latest/irena-aldana) delivering on their pre-fight hype claims.\nThe event, also known as UFC 306, was designed to honor Mexican heritage and took place in Las Vegas at The Sphere. The UFC said that due to\n[high production costs](/sport/mma/137560/Dana-White-UFC-306-Sphere-Las-Vegas), the show would [become historic as a one-night-only event](/sport/mma/148843/joe-rogan-andrew-schulz-agreement).\nAfter the preliminary card headliner, all three judges awarded Dumont a 30-27. Dumont utilized her range and power to punch her way through the crowd favorite, but the fight was most notably marked by Aldana's eye injury, which was instantly labeled as \"\n[the worst cut in UFC history](/sport/mma/148716/ufc-star-suffers-worst-cut-in-history).\" [Irene Aldana shows off horrific eye injury after severe facial lacerations from UFC 306](/sport/mma/148884/irene-aldana-shows-off-horrific) [Jake Paul sneaks into UFC 306 undercover after being banned by Dana White](/sport/mma/148800/jake-paul-ufc-306-disguise-ban-dana-white)\nBefore\n[UFC Noche](/sport/mma/148715/ufc-306-results-in-full-omalley-dvalishvili), Dumont made headlines outside the octagon with her announcement of joining [OnlyFans](/latest/onlyfans). Some fans initially leaped to their own conclusions about the content she would be posting, but Dumont set the record straight, explaining that the platform was a way for her to connect with fans through her training and daily life.\n\"The first reaction was that people thought I was going to post more private content,\" Dumont explained to Express U.S Sports. \"But they soon understood that it was more about my daily life, my training, and the preparation that goes into my career.\"\nDumont admitted that her tireless schedule during a fight camp features two daily training sessions, with the cameras always rolling. She balances training and content creation with assistance from teammates who train at whichever gym she's at for the day.\nFor Dumont, joining OnlyFans wasn’t just a platform for interaction but a chance to showcase the work behind the scenes that often goes unseen. The UFC bantamweight exhibits harsh physical preparation that the average athlete wouldn't dare to try and unforgiving technical drills that shape her success on fight night.\nFans quickly followed the page with initial assumptions but were converted to eager-to-learn students from her insights and routines. \"People started following because they enjoyed my physical preparation workouts and technical routines,\" she admitted. Over time, her audience expanded, and Dumont used the platform to bridge the cage and her personal life, connecting the dots with nutrition and fitness as topics.\nUFC Noche also saw Dumont preserve her unbeaten streak in Las Vegas, where she has fought eight times and never tasted defeat. \"I think it's the best place for everyone. I feel totally at home here. I've already lived here, so I feel at home,\" she said.\nDON'T MISS\n[Georgia goes wild in streets after Merab Dvalishvili's Championship victory over Sean O'Malley](/sport/mma/148728/georgia-goes-wild-in-streets) [Jon Jones confirms UFC retirement plans after Stipe Miocic announcement](/sport/mma/148886/jon-jones-confirms-ufc-retirement) [Dana White receives rare gift from WWE legend at UFC 306 in Las Vegas Sphere](/sport/mma/148725/dana-white-ufc-receives-gift-wwe-legend)\nDespite the event honoring Mexican heritage and her facing a Mexican opponent on the\n[same night of a Canelo Alvarez boxing event](/sport/boxing/144312/canelo-alvarez-announces-next-fight-undisputed), Dumont felt just as at home in the city.\"I've never lost in Las Vegas, and I'm going to continue not to lose here. Even though the night is Mexican, Las Vegas is my home and I felt 100 percent comfortable.\"\nHer comfort in the city translated into another star performance inside the octagon. After the win, Dumont rose three slots in the official UFC bantamweight rankings, making her No. 5 worldwide.",

    "text": "Ariana Grande's notorious doppelgänger Paige Niemann has this week gone viral for 'impersonating' the star at a red carpet movie premiere, prompting fans of the real Wicked actress to wonder how she must be feeling about it.\nGrande has addressed her resemblance to the controversial social media 'cosplayer' several times publicly since the image-mirroring began - including on one brutal occasion, where she supposedly slammed Niemann as 'bizarre'.\nWho is Paige Niemann?\nThe Mail previously reported that, when California schoolgirl Paige Niemann was just 10 years old, a friend noted her physical similarities to then-Disney Channel star, Ariana Grande - who is around 11 years older.\nAdvert\nIn the years prior, the actress was famed for portraying red-haired class clown Cat Valentine on Nickelodeon hits like Victorious and Sam & Cat, before launching a successful career as a pop singer.\nAgreeing with the resemblance, Niemann then tried her hand at purposefully dressing up as Grande, with her first Instagram post - uploaded in 2017 - showing her donning a similar hot-red wig to the one worn on kids TV by the actress.\nThe years that followed saw Niemann copy the several changes that Grande made to her appearance - from her lengthy brunette ponytail and winged eyeliner phase of 2018-20, to the more minimal blonde get-up she's been donning more recently.\nAnd after Wicked was released in cinemas in November of last year, the lookalike - who had since racked up a staggering 10.3 million fans on TikTok - went viral for recreating her performing as her character 'Glinda' in 'What Is This Feeling?', complete with pink dress and blonde wig.\nControversial copying\nDespite her mighty online following, however, Niemann's fame hasn't come without its controversies.\nAdvert\n2022 saw her subjected to mass backlash after reportedly signing up to the online subscription service OnlyFans - which is known for hosting explicit material - where she vowed to share 'exclusive content that you wouldn't normally see from me'.\nThe move raised questions of permission and consent on the part of the real 'Thank U Next' singer, with critics later branding Niemann 'weird', 'desperate' and 'creepy' on X.\nAnd this week, Niemann's impersonating antics were seemingly raised to a whole new level after she made what she described online as her 'first red carpet appearance' on Monday (27 January), by the attending the movie premiere for Companion in Hollywood, dressed as Grande.\n\"I thought it’s a Madame Tussaud wax figure at first,\" one critic later slammed online, whilst another agreed: \"Yeah I’m terrified too.\"\nAdvert\nBut how must the real Ariana Grande feel to know that she's having her entire aesthetic ripped off in public without her consent?\nAriana Grande's take\nWhilst she's never explicitly hit out at Niemann's antics by using her name, she has taken a passionate stance against celebrities being impersonated on several occasions now.\nAdvert\nAccording to Buzzfeed in 2019, the actress and musician, now 31, responded on X to a fans' theory about Niemann's rise to prominence, writing: \"@knnewagb i just wonder whyyyy the cat voice / dialogue.\"\nGrande is said to have continued: \"i am sure she is the sweetest sweet sweetheart forreal !! but it’s definitley bizarre seeing people blend the two worlds lmao.\"\nThe news outlet also alleges that, on another occasion, Grande shared a now-deleted video of another internet user discussing the concept of impersonation online.\nThe video in question supposedly saw filmmaker Jordan Firstman explaining: \"What if we, like, we took a moment, like a small clip from a movie or a TV show — something that, like, an artist really poured their soul into and it, like, it just took them years to make, and it was an uphill battle the entire time — what if we took a moment from that and we kind of, like, recontextualised it?\nAdvert\n\"Like, does that make sense? And we put a completely arbitrary meaning onto that thing that the artist loves so much? Kind of, like, degrading its entire value?\"\nFirstman added: \"I just think that could be, like, a fun, bitchy thing to do,\" he ends the video. \"I'm so bored... I just kind of wanna ruin someone's life today.\"\nApparently, Grande re-shared the clip with her own caption, writing: \"Can this please also double as your impression of the pony tail TikTok girls who think doing the Cat Valentine voice and that wearing winged eyeliner and a sweatshirt is doing a good impersonation of me...\n\"Cause this is really how it feels.\"\nAnd in a promo interview for Wicked with Variety more recently - where she was hooked up to a lie detecter and asked by co-star Cynthia Erivo whether she'd 'ever confronted' anyone who impersonated her - she began by claiming, 'No'.\nThen, asked if she 'wanted to' - in a video which many fans interpreted as being about Niemann - Grande admitted: \"Yes - in a fun way.\"",

    "title": "UTA Researcher: Children of Divorce May Have Increased Stroke Risk Later in Life",
    "text": "A researcher at the University of Texas at Arlington has found that the effects of divorce on children’s mental health could last longer than expected and could increase their risk of serious health issues decades later.\nThe university said the findings by social work Associate Professor Philip Baiden recently were published in the journal PLoS One. The research showed that Americans aged 65 and older who experienced their parents divorcing as children were more likely to suffer a stroke compared to their peers—one in nine as compared to one in 15 for those whose parents did not divorce.\n“Even when taking into account common risk factors of a stroke, such as smoking, physical inactivity, obesity, diabetes, depression, income and education, older adults whose parents divorced when they were children were much more likely to have a stroke than their counterparts whose parents were not divorced,” Baiden—who conducted the research with colleagues from Tyndale University and the University of Toronto, both in Ontario, Canada—said in a statement. “From a biological perspective, experiencing parental divorce as a child could lead to sustained levels of stress hormones that could have a lasting influence on the brain.”\nUTA said the study analyzed data from more than 13,000 older Americans from the 2022 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey. Some 14% had experienced parental divorce during childhood. To isolate the effects of divorce, UTA said that persons who experienced physical or sexual abuse as children were excluded from the study.\nBaiden said that the youngest people in the sample were born in 1957—more than a decade before the introduction of the first no-fault divorce laws in 1969.\n“It’s likely this cohort experienced greater social stigma from their communities and peers compared to those who experienced parental divorce after it became more common,” he said.\n‘Long-term impacts of childhood trauma’ UTA said that while the study has limitations, understanding the link between childhood divorce and stroke risk is important because of the serious and lasting effects of strokes.\nStudies reveal that roughly half of all strokes are fatal and that among survivors, roughly two-thirds report impaired mobility, more than half suffer from cognitive decline, and many lose the ability to live independently. Strokes have significant financial implications for those who get them, with combined direct and indirect costs exceeding $56 billion annually in the U.S.\n“As a longtime researcher of adverse childhood experiences and social determinants of health, I believe this study provides additional information on the long-term impacts of childhood trauma on the adult brain,” Baiden said.\nBaiden said that in the future, he plans to look at how childhood poverty, stress, and sleep disorders intersect with the risk of stroke, and he also plans to explore the mechanisms through which divorce might contribute to stroke.\n“Interestingly, males who experienced divorce as children were more likely to suffer a stroke than females,” Baiden said. “This is unusual, as women are statistically more likely to have a stroke than men. This is another element we want to study further in future research.”",

    "title": "Is PETA against aquariums?",
    "text": "Is PETA Against Aquariums? A Deep Dive into Animal Rights and Marine Conservation Yes, the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) is fundamentally against aquariums , particularly those that house and display marine mammals and other large aquatic animals. Their opposition stems from their core belief that animals have the right to live free from human exploitation and confinement, viewing aquariums as institutions that prioritize human entertainment over the well-being of the animals they hold captive. PETA’s stance is not merely a casual disapproval; it’s an active campaign against the aquarium industry, advocating for its eventual shutdown and replacement with humane alternatives.\nUnderstanding PETA’s Core Arguments PETA’s objections to aquariums are multifaceted, revolving around concerns about animal welfare, ethical considerations, and the effectiveness of aquariums in promoting conservation. They argue that:\nConfinement is Cruel: Large marine animals, such as dolphins, whales, and seals, require vast open spaces to thrive. Aquariums, regardless of their size, cannot replicate the natural environment and freedom these animals are adapted for. This confinement leads to stress, boredom, and psychological distress, often manifesting in abnormal behaviors. Unnatural Social Structures: Aquariums often house animals in artificial social groups, which can disrupt natural hierarchies and lead to aggression or isolation. Breeding Programs: PETA opposes breeding programs within aquariums, arguing that they perpetuate the cycle of captivity and contribute to the overpopulation of captive animals. They advocate for a focus on rescuing and rehabilitating injured wildlife, rather than breeding more animals for display. Poor Living Conditions: While some aquariums invest in providing high-quality care, PETA argues that many facilities, particularly roadside zoos and smaller aquariums, fail to meet basic animal welfare standards. These facilities may have inadequate space, poor water quality, and a lack of environmental enrichment. Entertainment Over Education: PETA asserts that the primary purpose of aquariums is entertainment, not education or conservation. They believe that observing animals in artificial environments does not provide a true understanding of their natural behaviors or the challenges they face in the wild. PETA’s Call to Action PETA urges the public to boycott aquariums and other facilities that keep animals in captivity. They encourage individuals to:\nRefuse to Visit: Do not buy tickets to aquariums, zoos, or marine parks. Spread Awareness: Educate others about the ethical concerns surrounding animal captivity. Support Alternatives: Advocate for and support alternative forms of animal education, such as virtual reality experiences, documentaries, and wildlife sanctuaries that prioritize animal welfare. Lobby for Change: Contact local aquariums and government officials to advocate for improved animal welfare standards and the eventual phasing out of animal captivity. FAQs: Delving Deeper into Aquariums and Animal Welfare Here are some frequently asked questions to further clarify the complexities surrounding aquariums and animal welfare:\n1. Do zoos and aquariums have an ethical obligation to ensure animal welfare? Absolutely. Zoos and aquariums have a fundamental ethical obligation to prioritize the well-being and humane treatment of all animals in their care. This includes providing adequate space, nutrition, veterinary care, and environmental enrichment. Independent, third-party certifications using science-based animal welfare standards can help ensure these obligations are met.\n2. What does PETA think about pets in general? PETA does not oppose people sharing their lives with animal companions who are loved, well-treated, and properly cared for. However, they oppose puppy mills and private breeders, advocating for adoption from shelters and spaying/neutering to address pet overpopulation.\n3. What four areas does PETA feel animals suffer the most? PETA focuses its attention on the four areas in which the largest numbers of animals suffer the most intensely for the longest periods of time: laboratories, the food industry, the clothing trade, and the entertainment business.\n4. Is it ethical to go to an aquarium at all? The ethics of visiting an aquarium are subjective and depend on individual values. Some argue that well-run aquariums contribute to conservation and education, while others believe that keeping animals in captivity is inherently unethical. Considering the specific aquarium’s animal welfare practices and conservation efforts is crucial in making an informed decision.\n5. Do fish realize they are in a tank? Fish may not have the cognitive ability to understand the concept of being “in a tank” in the same way humans do. However, they can experience stress and discomfort if their environment is inadequate. Sufficient space, water quality, and environmental enrichment are essential for their well-being.\n6. Are fish happy in an aquarium? Fish can live happily in an aquarium if their needs are properly met. This includes providing appropriate space, clean water, suitable temperature, and a stimulating environment. Observe your fish for signs of stress, such as lethargy or erratic swimming, and adjust their environment accordingly.\n7. Do fish know they are in water? It’s unlikely fish have a conscious awareness of being “in water” as humans do of the air around them. Fish have evolved to live and thrive in water.\n8. Do fish get excited to see you? Certain species, like Betta fish , are known to recognize their owners and exhibit excitement, swimming to the front of the tank and reacting to their presence.\n9. Can fish learn their name? Fish may not understand names like dogs or cats. However, some fish can become accustomed to sounds or movements associated with feeding time and respond to those cues.\n10. What do fish do all day in a tank? Fish behavior varies by species. Some, like catfish, are bottom-feeders. Fish also sleep, often at the bottom of the tank. Listlessness or unusual behavior could indicate disease.\n11. Is it cruel to keep jellyfish as pets? Whether keeping jellyfish is cruel is debated. In the wild, their mortality rates are high. Some argue that keeping jellyfish in an aquarium is no more cruel than keeping a plant in a pot, provided their specific needs are met.\n12. Can fishes see us? Yes, fish can see you through the tank. They have well-developed eyesight and can see movement and shapes outside of the tank, but their vision is adapted to the underwater environment.\n13. Can fish hear you when you talk to them? Yes, fish can hear you talk . Sounds created above water typically do not carry enough force to penetrate the surface tension of the water.\n14. What colors can fish not see? Fish generally have difficulty seeing red light, as it’s quickly absorbed in water. Red colors may appear grey or black, especially at deeper depths.\n15. Why is this fish staring at me? Fish quickly learn to associate humans with food. When they see you, they anticipate feeding time and may come to the front of the tank to watch.\nThe Role of Conservation and Education While PETA emphasizes the ethical concerns surrounding captivity, some aquariums argue they play a vital role in conservation and education. They participate in breeding programs for endangered species, rescue and rehabilitate injured animals, and educate the public about marine ecosystems and the threats they face.\nHowever, even these arguments are subject to debate. Critics question the effectiveness of breeding programs in truly contributing to wild populations and argue that education can be achieved through non-captive means. Furthermore, the potential psychological harm to animals caused by captivity outweighs any potential conservation benefits.\nFinding a Balanced Perspective The question of whether to visit an aquarium is a complex one, requiring individuals to weigh the potential benefits of conservation and education against the ethical concerns of animal captivity. Organizations like The Environmental Literacy Council provide valuable resources for understanding environmental issues and promoting informed decision-making; you can find them at enviroliteracy.org . Ultimately, the decision rests on individual values and beliefs.\nHowever, regardless of one’s stance on aquariums, it is essential to support initiatives that promote animal welfare, protect marine ecosystems, and advance our understanding of the natural world. By engaging in informed discussions, advocating for responsible practices, and supporting humane alternatives, we can strive towards a future where the well-being of animals is prioritized alongside human interests.\nAquariums and similar facilities need to adhere to third-party certifications, such as the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA), to confirm that animals in their care have proper conditions to thrive. This accreditation is a starting point for the ethical treatment of all animals.\nPETA has good intentions of protecting animal well being, but it’s up to individual research and feelings whether a zoo or aquarium is worth the visit.",

    "title": "Professores da rede municipal do Rio vão continuar em greve | Agência Brasil",
    "text": "[Educação](/educacao)\nProfessores da rede municipal do Rio vão continuar em greve\nA greve dos professores da rede municipal do Rio de Janeiro, que começou na segunda-feira (25), vai continuar. A decisão foi tomada pela categoria em assembleia realizada nesta sexta-feira (29), na quadra da Escola de Samba São Clemente, na região central da cidade, para discutir os rumos do movimento.\nSegundo a coordenadora geral do Sindicato Estadual dos Profissionais da Educação do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (Sepe-RJ), Helenita Bezerra, que participou da assembleia, a entidade ainda não foi notificada oficialmente da decisão do presidente do Tribunal de Justiça do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (TJRJ), desembargador Ricardo Rodrigues Cardoso, que determinou ontem (28) a imediata interrupção da greve dos professores da rede municipal e o retorno ao trabalho.\nAlém disso, o desembargador estipulou multa de R$ 500 mil à entidade da categoria e de R$ 5 mil aos diretores do sindicato em cada dia de descumprimento da ordem.\n“A assembleia deliberou pela continuidade da greve, e o sindicato ainda não tem notificação oficial de ilegalidade da greve. Enquanto não tem, os nossos advogados não têm como se mexer sobre um fato que, para nós, não é oficial”, disse Helenita à Agência Brasil.\nA decisão do juiz atendeu a pedido da prefeitura do Rio, que argumentou ilegalidade da paralisação por meio de ação de dissídio coletivo de greve. “O município informou que não houve aviso prévio em relação ao movimento grevista e nem tentativa de diálogo entre a categoria e a Secretaria Municipal de Educação”, relatou o TJRJ.\nDe acordo com o presidente do tribunal, o sindicato não cumpriu “elementos básicos para garantir a legalidade da greve”, como o esgotamento da tentativa de diálogo e a notificação prévia mínima de 48 horas. “Em uma primeira análise, não há comprovação do esgotamento da via negocial e da sua frustração. Pelo contrário, o documento ID. 01, do Anexo 1, demonstra que, no mesmo dia em que houve a convocação da assembleia pelo sindicato, deliberou-se pelo início imediato e sem termo final do movimento paredista”, disse o desembargador.\n“Não há dúvida de que as atividades dos servidores da educação são essenciais”, afirmou Ricardo Cardoso, ressaltando que este é um fator de limite para o exercício do direito de greve. O desembargador determinou que a prefeitura desconte o salário proporcionalmente aos dias de paralisação ilegal.\nNa tentativa de acordo, foi marcada uma audiência virtual para o dia 11 de dezembro, às 15h. “O sindicato da categoria reivindica o arquivamento do Projeto de Lei (PL) 186/2024, que amplia a quantidade de aulas para os professores e traz alterações em direitos como férias e licenças. Professores e funcionários das escolas do município também exigem a revogação da Lei 8666/2024, que aumenta para até seis anos os contratos temporários na rede”, completou o TJRJ em nota.\nA coordenadora do Sepe-RJ informou ainda que, na quarta-feira (4), haverá nova assembleia. Até lá, a categoria pretende discutir na Câmara de Vereadores a apresentação de emendas ao Projeto de Lei 186 ou a retirada deste pelo prefeito Eduardo Paes.\n“Tiramos uma pauta de mobilização que prevê panfletagens, atos e uma série de coisas para serem feitas com a categoria. Na quarta-feira teremos nova assembleia. Estamos aguardando também a casa legislativa nos chamar para mais uma audiência em que vamos dizer se a categoria concordou, ou não, em colocar emendas ao projeto de lei.

    "text": "ROME, Dec. 28 (Xinhua) -- Italy has experienced a record-setting number of extreme weather events in 2023, a year that is set to be the warmest in more than 150 years, reports said on Thursday.\nAccording to the climate observatory run by the environmental lobby group Legambiente, Italy reported 378 severe weather events in 2023, an increase of 22 percent compared to last year -- ranging from heatwaves to drought and from hailstorms to floods and extreme winds, which were directly responsible for at least 31 deaths.\nOn the other hand, the agriculture sector union Coldiretti said there were more than nine harsh weather events per day this year across Italy's boot-shaped peninsula.\nIn its report, Coldiretti estimated that extreme weather caused a record 6 billion euros (6.6 billion U.S. dollars) of damages to crops and agricultural infrastructure, leading to shortfalls in the country's production of olive oil, peaches, nectarines and wheat.\nLegambiente said its calculations showed that the northern part of the country was hit the hardest, with 210 separate extreme weather events, followed by 98 in the central regions and 70 in the south which includes the island regions of Sicily and Sardinia.\nAmong the extreme weather events were floods, record high temperatures, rain-triggered landslides and hailstorms, it said.\nMuch of Europe suffered a long and dry summer and multiple severe weather events this year, but Italy is often hit harder due to its long coastline and exposure to the sea on two coasts. Meteorological data indicate that this year is set to be the warmest in more than 150 years of record-keeping in Italy.\nMeanwhile, weather agencies predict the year will end with an unusually warm spell, with high daytime temperatures across much of the Italian peninsula, assuring that 2024 will start out on the warm side. ■",
