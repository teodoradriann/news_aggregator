    "title": "The Apple Vision Pro Is One of the Worst Headsets for Gaming",
    "text": "Apple really wanted the Apple Vision Pro to take over the VR landscape when it released earlier this year, but after months of returns and rumors of delays for follow-ups , it’s clear that demand isn’t quite living up to expectations. One potential reason for the problem? Well, the $3,500 price tag. But aside from that? The Vision Pro has yet to prove itself as a gaming device.\nVR headsets and gaming go hand in hand Since the very first Oculus Rift launched back in 2016, current consumer VR technology has always been deeply intertwined with gaming. One of the most prominent VR headsets in the space right now is PlayStation branded , and despite Meta’s attempts to push the Quest family of devices as being useful for anything from work to fitness , the company’s headsets still come with motion tracking, console-like controllers and plenty of big-budget exclusive games .\nThis sort of support helps give a headset broader appeal and a sense of having “killer apps” that give you a reason to wear it outside of air travel or other niche situations. But the Vision Pro is, by design, much less capable of supporting gaming. That’s because Apple has chosen not to ship it with controllers.\nThere’s two sides to this. The first is that Apple’s hand-tracking is quite good, making casually scrolling through the Vision Pro’s interface not too dissimilar from using an iPad. It also makes the Vision Pro perhaps a bit more approachable to non-gamers, again fitting its branding less as a gaming device and more as, to use Apple’s words, a “spatial computer.”\nBut unfortunately, the lack of controllers also means that, in the odd situation where you want to game, your inputs are seriously limited. Despite the accuracy of Apple’s hand tracking, it’s still a big laggy for twitchy actions, and the lack of dedicated buttons means developers are limited in how they can use the device.\nIt’s a shame, because armed with beautiful screens, an easy-to-navigate interface, and an M2 chip, the Vision Pro definitely has the hardware to support more experiences than it does. It could be the best gaming headset by default if it simply supported motion controllers. Unfortunately, we’re left with much lighter experiences, sacrificed on the altar of fashion.\nStill, let’s say you don’t have interest in big-budget VR games, but just want to poke around with playing in VR or AR while you’re there. Is the Apple Vision Pro good for casual gaming? Well, yes, but with some big asterisks.\nGears & Goo on the Apple Vision Pro Credit: Apple Recently, I got to go hands-on with an early build of Gears & Goo , an upcoming Apple Vision Pro exclusive from veteran VR and AR developers Resolution Games. The game is a sort of a cross between a real-time strategy game and a MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena), where you lead troops to take down an enemy stronghold. It’s a clever choice for the Vision Pro, and is probably as impressive as a game for the headset could get (previous experiences have generally been lighter than this ), but nevertheless, I could feel the developers straining against the device’s limitations. If this is Apple’s best, it’s a concerning sign.\nFirst, the good. The graphics here are genuinely immersive, and nothing feels blurry or hard to follow. The AR effect here is especially well sold, with the game’s tiny cartoon critters actually feeling like they’re sharing the same space as you. Control was also surprisingly intuitive for a hands-only game, with your hands essentially taking the place of a mouse as you command troops. There’s a lot of charm to be found here as you play through the game’s silly setting of rival alien soda companies taking part in literal corporate warfare.\nBut once the glitz of the first impression is gone, the parlor trick feeling of it all starts to set in. While the game sets itself up as an RTS, with you spawning troops and choosing how to build your home base, it’s more limited than most games in the genre. You quickly realize that you have no direct control over your troops: once they're deployed, the only decision you’re able to make with them is which “lane” of the battlefield you want them to attack—which is where the MOBA elements come in. Similarly, you can only build in a very small square directly in front of you.\nThere are elements you can interact with on the map, like bombs you can click on to blow up enemies as they walk past them, but while the game tries to make you feel like a commander, the truth is that you’re mostly ordering the type of army you’d like off a menu and watching it do all the work for you.\nThat’s not inherently a bad thing, and works for the bite-sized, mobile game-style levels presented to you. But it’s also clear that the restricted gameplay is due to the Vision Pro’s lack of controllers.\nIt’s likely that you can only build your base in a very small area in front of you because that’s easier on the device. Same with not being able to order troops around directly. And the choice of genre is almost certainly so that players can play sitting down, without needing to use room-scale tracking. Again, it’s a clever choice, but not exactly an ambitious one.\nEssentially, there’s nothing being done here that couldn’t be replicated outside of VR, meaning this is basically an iPad game with a three-dimensional coat of paint. In fact, it would probably play better on that platform, as the more precise control would likely mean fewer restrictions on gameplay.\nI only got to play a few levels, so it’s possible it gets more complex later, but as it is, this isn’t a great first impression for what the Vision Pro might deliver with its exclusives in the future, and it certainly doesn’t bode well for ongoing third-party VR game support. It should be a fun distraction for people who already own the headset, but unlike with Meta-exclusive games like Batman: Arkham Shadow , it’s unlikely to convince anyone who doesn’t already own a Vision Pro to rush out and buy one. Even if you’re not into more “hardcore” games, there’s little unique here at the moment. Not only are you just fine with an iPad, but probably better off with one, too.\nWhat about more traditional games? So, VR gaming on the Apple Vision Pro might come across more as a novelty for now, but what about using the headset as a monitor for playing 2D games? This worked better in my demo, where I got to experience the console game Lies of P in the Vision Pro, but I have two problems stopping me from recommending it.\nAgain, let’s start with the positives. In my time with it, I got to play the game, a more traditional hack-and-slash RPG akin to Dark Souls , by using the Vision Pro as an external monitor for a MacBook running the game. Connection was smooth, gameplay was responsive, and the beta ultrawide mode I got to test with allowed me to replicate a type of monitor most people don’t own in real life.\nAnd yet, I’m left feeling like Apple is doing the bare minimum here. Case in point: If the Apple Vision Pro is supposed to be a “spatial computer,” why do I need a MacBook to stream the game from? Released for Mac last year just a few months after the M2 hit the market, Lies of P is plenty capable of achieving solid performance on an M2 chip, so it would make sense to expect the Vision Pro to run it natively. Instead, you need an external computer communicating with it wirelessly, and in a situation like a flight, that just adds extra bulk and more potential points of failure.\nMeanwhile, I’m wondering why you’d want to use the Vision Pro to play this game anywhere other than a flight or another situation where you can’t access a television or large monitor. That’s because, while the large virtual display was certainly nice, I’m not sure wearing the Vision Pro for a whole gameplay session is feasible.\nThis headset is premium, and that means an all-metal construction, which is heavy on your face. I only wore the Vision Pro for about 45 minutes, and by the end, I was happy to take it off. Meanwhile, I can usually go with the plastic construction of my Meta Quest 3 for a few hours before getting tired. A cheaper Apple Vision product can’t get here fast enough, and that’s for more reasons than price.\nSo, while the Apple Vision Pro works for non-VR games, I don’t see myself using it for them outside of situations where I have few other options. And even then, the experience could be better.\nShould gamers get the Apple Vision Pro? With its horsepower, the Apple Vision Pro should be a contender for best gaming headset, but the baffling decision to opt out of controllers keeps it from holding that status. Right now, it’s one of the worst headsets for gaming, and with gaming still holding such a big part of the overall headset market , that leaves the Vision Pro in an awkward spot overall.\nI still think it’s possible we might see Apple release Vision Pro controllers in the future, as it starts to adjust more to the reality that VR headsets are specialty devices with specific appeal that general audiences can’t be forced to love, and, therefore, can’t be sold on the same minimalist, luxury approach as a MacBook. But until that time comes, the Apple Vision Pro will continue to be very powerful hardware without any real experience that pushes it to its limits. For now, you can still get a better gaming experience for much less.",

A concessionária responsável, GRU Airport, comunicou que a instabilidade no sistema de navegação por satélite (GNSS) destinado a aeronaves está provocando atrasos e cancelamentos pontuais nas decolagens. As companhias aéreas Gol e Latam foram as mais afetadas por essa situação. A Gol, por exemplo, precisou cancelar alguns voos e também registrou atrasos significativos. Por outro lado, a Latam conseguiu normalizar sua operação após enfrentar períodos de atraso. A GRU Airport garantiu que os sistemas do aeroporto e de navegação aérea continuam funcionando normalmente, apesar da falha. A concessionára disse em nota que “devido à intermitência no sistema de navegação (GNSS), que é especifico para aeronaves, algumas empresas aéreas enfrentam atrasos pontuais nas decolagens do aeroporto de Guarulhos”. A situação foi normalizada por volta das 16h45. *Reportagem produzida com auxílio de IA Publicado por Fernando Keller",

Read full article The Canadian Press January 6, 2024 at 12:03 a.m. · 5 min read\nTORONTO — The Los Angeles Lakers' mystique was alive and well with Ontario bettors.\nThe Lakers, led by superstar LeBron James, were the second-most bet on team on DraftKings' Ontario sportsbook last year. Only the Toronto Blue Jays drew more action.\n\"The Lakers are a popular team, whether it's the U.S., Canada, Germany, Spain, it doesn't matter,\" said Johnny Avello, DraftKings' director of race and sports operations. \"The team has a big following and has for many years because of all the great players that go through their doors.\n\"You go anywhere and you'll see people wearing Lakers shirts.\"\nThe Buffalo Bills -- popular in southern Ontario -- held down third spot. The Toronto Maple Leafs were the only other Canadian franchise to make the cut, standing eighth ahead of basketball's Phoenix Suns and football's New York Jets.\nThe Jays (89-73) finished third in the American League East to qualify for the playoffs. However, they were swept 2-0 by the Minnesota Twins in the AL wildcard series.\nToronto was the most-bet on World Series team, ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers and Philadelphia Phillies. The champion Texas Rangers were fourth.\nToronto slugger Vladimir Guerrero Jr. was the most bet-on player to win the AL MVP, ahead of New York's Aaron Judge and Texas's Corey Seager. But Anaheim's Shohei Ohtani, the fourth pick, was the runaway winner of the award before signing a mega 10-year, US$700-million free-agent deal with the Dodgers.\nAvello wasn't surprised to see the Jays atop the list.\n\"When you look at certain jurisdictions where we are, teams in that jurisdiction are bet on more than others,\" he said. \"So that's no surprise.\"\nThe Toronto Raptors were the seventh-most bet on team to win the NBA crown. The Milwaukee Bucks, Suns and eventual-champion Denver Nuggets held the top three spots.\nNo Raptors were listed as favourites for the NBA's outstanding player award but Hamilton's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander of the Oklahoma City Thunder, was the fourth most-bet on individual by handle. Denver's Nikola Jokic, Boston's Jayson Tatum and Dallas's Luka Doncic were the top-three picks.\nStory continues Toronto's Darko Rajakovic was fourth in betting for the NBA's top coach award. Former Raptors boss Nick Nurse, now with the Philadelphia 76ers, was tops.\nLast month, Gilgeous-Alexander was named The Canadian Press male athlete of the year.\n\"He is a tremendous player and has been for a few years now,\" Avello said. \"It's not unusual that he'd be bet up there because he's certainly one of your top players in the NBA.\"\nSurprisingly, the Cincinnati Bengals were the most bet-on NFL team to win the Super Bowl. Buffalo was second ahead of the San Francisco 49ers (12-4), who've clinched top spot in the NFC.\nBuffalo (10-6) can secure the AFC East for a fourth straight year with a road win Sunday over Miami. The Dolphins (11-5) have already clinched an NFL playoff spot.\n\"I found that (Cincinnati selection) to be a little surprising,\" Avello said. 'Buffalo has always been a top choice because it has had a good, competitive team over the last few years and there's also the proximity to Canada.\n\"But the Bengals have had a good team knocking on the door so I think this was about value . . . going for a double-digit underdog and trying to get a better price for your buck. I don't blame (bettors) because going into the season I thought Cincinnati would also contend for the title but unfortunately when you lose (quarterback) Joe Burrow and a couple of receivers . . . it was just a bad overall year for Cincinnati.\"\nBuffalo quarterback Josh Allen was the third pick for the NFL's most valuable player award behind San Francisco's Brock Purdy and Dallas's Dak Prescott. Lamar Jackson, who has led Baltimore (13-3) to top spot in the AFC and emerged as the favourite to win the honour for a second time, was initially ninth.\nOntario bettors made the Maple Leafs the most bet-on team to win the Stanley Cup. Edmonton was No. 2 ahead of Las Vegas, last year's champion.\nToronto last won the Stanley Cup in 1967.\n\"Toronto has been there, it has had great, outstanding regular-season records, it just hasn't been able to get far enough,\" Avello said. \"I think it (Leafs topping list) should be.\"\nThe Vancouver Canucks were fifth, ahead of the Ottawa Senators (sixth).\nRick Tocchet, in his first full season behind Vancouver's bench, was the top selection to win the Jack Adams Trophy as the NHL's top coach. The Canucks (24-11-3, 51 points) currently top the Pacific Conference.\nPeter Laviolette of the New York Rangers (26-10-1, 53 points) and Mike Sullivan of the Pittsburgh Penguins (19-14-4, 42 points) were the other top two candidates.\n\"Obviously it makes sense that (Tocchet) would get bet,\" Avello said. \"But (Laviolette) is also a good choice and value play.\n\"That was probably bet more toward the beginning of the year so I see that also as a very smart play by bettors.\"\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 5, 2024.\nDan Ralph, The Canadian Press\nTRENDING 1.

Learn more about us.\nBriana Stephenson, assistant professor of biostatistics at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, develops biostatistical models to better understand population health disparities. In this Q&A, she shares what motivates her work and the broad applications of her research.\nQ: How did you become interested in biostatistics and public health?\nA: I’ve always loved math, but I also was really interested in the life sciences. Around 7th grade when I was first exposed to life science, my teacher told me, “You’re going to be a doctor.” So I went down that route and stayed pretty rigid. Every decision that I made through school and college was with the intention of becoming a physician.\nWhen I got to college, I was a math major and pre-med. While the topic of health and medicine interested me, I found myself more captivated in my math courses. I loved learning how mathematical theories and principles could be applied to solve interesting problems, from understanding traffic flow on the Massachusetts Turnpike to finding disease causes in vulnerable populations. However, I stayed on the pre-med track. It was not until my first semester of medical school that I found myself at a crossroad.\nAt medical school, while I wanted to improve the health of my community, my scope of impact was limited to the individual patient level. As part of my practical training, I worked at a children’s sports clinic, where I saw a lot of repetition of injuries and treatment plans. Over time, I began to notice patterns in the types of injuries being presented, based on the patient’s age, neighborhood, and other demographics. My attention began to shift to identifying the source of these clustered cases to better strategize interventions to reduce the number of injuries within these patient groups.\nI took a seminar in epidemiology and biostatistics and learned how I could use math to quantify and explain trends at the population level, and predict the impact that interventions could have on the community if implemented. That seminar is what ultimately motivated my pivot from medical school to public health.\nRead the full article about biostatistics by Jay Lau at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.",

    "title": "Slimeball Will Wade will be the next head basketball coach at NC State",
    "text": "Will Wade, Mr. Strong-Ass Offer, former VCU coach, former LSU coach, now the coach at McNeese State, who let slip yesterday that he’d talked to NC State about its basketball job, will be the new coach at NC State after the NCAA Tournament.\nAn AD with any amount of self-respect and self-awareness would be embarrassed beyond recognition if anybody found out that a sleazebag like Will Wade was even under consideration.\nWhat does that say about Boo Corrigan, a guy that more than a few people in UVA circles still whine about because he didn’t get the AD job at Virginia?\nGive Corrigan credit, I guess, for being able to look past what got Wade fired at LSU in 2022, and earned him a 10-game suspension and two-year show-cause penalty when he wormed his way back into the basketball business in 2023 at McNeese State.\nWade wins – he was 40-25 in two years at Chattanooga, took both of his VCU teams to the NCAA Tournament, and was 105-51 in five seasons at LSU, with a Sweet Sixteen appearance in 2019.\nAnd at McNeese State, he’s 49-8 with a pair of NCAA bids.\nIt’s how he wins that’s the issue.\nYou can dismiss the “strong-ass offer” as, well, now it’s legal to pay players, which, fine.\nIt’s not legal, never will be, to offer hush money to a witness, to try to stonewall an investigation by refusing to supply records.\nAnd then there’s the ethics of lawyering up to strong-arm the school into keeping him on the job for an extra year.\nThe guy is slime.\nI got several emails from UVA fans asking me why Wade wasn’t on Virginia’s radar.\nWill Wade shouldn’t be on any college AD’s radar.\nThe guy would have a hard time getting past a job interview at your local McDonald’s.\nLSU, for god’s sake, the kingfish of the SEC – motto: if you ain’t cheatin’, you ain’t tryin’ – fired Will Wade.\nUVA dodged two bullets – not hiring Boo Corrigan, and thus not having this Will Wade creep on our basketball sidelines.",

    "text": "„Höhle der Löwen“-Star Judith Williams warnt Fans eindringlich: „Fallt darauf nicht rein“\nUnternehmerin Judith Williams, bekannt aus „Die Höhle der Löwen“, ist aktuell sehr besorgt. Auf Instagram sendet sie ihren Fans eine ernste Botschaft.\nHerrsching – Die erfolgreiche „Höhle der Löwen“-Investorin Judith Williams (53) ist Rampenlicht gewöhnt. Sie selbst steht mit ihrem Gesicht vor allem für die erfolgreichen Produkte ihrer Kosmetiklinie. Als Geschäftsfrau mit Herz ist sie zudem sehr nahbar. Kunden und Fans vertrauen ihrem Urteil und Rat. Das macht ihr Business so erfolgreich. Doch das könnte ihr zum Verhängnis werden.\n„Höhle der Löwen“-Investorin Judith Williams kämpft gegen Betrüger\nNun richtet die smarte Geschäftsfrau auf Instagram ernste Worte an ihre Fans. Scheinbar nutzen Betrüger ihren Namen und ihr Gesicht, um mit minderwertigen Produkten das schnelle Geld zu machen. „Bitte fallt darauf nicht rein! Wir haben bereits rechtliche Schritte eingeleitet“, schreibt Judith Williams in einem Post. Die Fans sind dankbar für den Tipp und bewundern sie dafür, dass sie so aktiv dagegen vorgeht.\nJudith Williams ist klar, dass es nicht einfach sein wird, die Betrüger dingfest zu machen. Unter den Anzeigen sind viele KI-generierte Inhalte. Sie kennt sich aus, denn in ihren Firmen sind inzwischen ebenfalls KI-Tools im Einsatz. „Solange der Mensch im Mittelpunkt bleibt, kann KI ein mächtiger Begleiter sein“, sagt die Unternehmerin in einem aktuellen Interview mit der Zeitschrift KI-Buzzer. Sie weiß um den Nutzen und die Möglichkeiten der Technik bestens Bescheid.\nJudith Williams kennt die Gefahren von Fake-Profilen\nDie aktuellen Fake-Anzeigen können Judith Williams erheblich schaden. Kunden, die den Betrug nicht sofort durchschauen, vermuten vielleicht Absicht. Doch die „Höhle der Löwen“-Jurorin hat zum Glück den Ernst der Lage erkannt und wehrt sich öffentlich gegen die dunklen Schatten im Netz. Ihre Fans stehen hinter ihr und melden sogar selbst immer wieder Fake-Anzeigen und Profile.\nSolche Herausforderungen im Unternehmensalltag schlauchen, immerhin hat Judith Williams viele andere Projekte – wie ihr Ausflug zum „Traumschiff“ – auf der Tagesordnung. Erholung sucht sie im Zuhause am Ammersee. Sie ist ein Familienmensch durch und durch und findet vor allem bei Ehemann Alexander Rat. „Er ist ein ganz wunderbarer Mensch mit sehr tiefsinnigen Gedanken“, sagte sie einst gegenüber der Zeitschrift Bunte.

    "title": "Griffin Steinfeld's 2000-HP Chevy Apache Is The Baddest Truck Around",
    "text": "This old school muscle truck is a beautiful monster!\nOn what might be our favorite episode of AutotopiaLA yet, a familiar face and build were featured: Griffin Steinfeld and his killer 1956 twin-turbo LS Chevy Apache. This truck was noted by the web series' host as being the fastest vehicle they've ever featured, and that's a claim we find easy to believe. Hold onto your high-quality custom seat covers, this is a rocking truck!\nSpeaking of[high-quality custom seat covers], read this before buying your next[high-quality custom seat covers].\nYou might be familiar with the truck's owner, as Steinfeld has spent a lot of time behind the wheel. We dug up a video posted on YouTube of the driver on the NASCAR Circuit when he was just 17-years-old and Westlake High School senior.\nHe would go on to race in the K&N Pro Series West for three seasons, and dedicates most of his time since to building bad-to-the-bone machines for his own garage. As you can see in the stunt driving reel on his YouTube page, he's put in as much time honing his skills as he has turning wrenches, and it shows.\nAnd yes, Griffin is the proud older brother of the Bumblebee star and pop superstar, Hailee Steinfeld. We don't know what's in the water at the Steinfeld house, but this is one mega-talented family!\nThe current star of the show would have to be the 2000-horsepower Apache that seems to put a little fear into Shawn Davis from AutotopiaLA when they go for a spin. If you don't want to take Davis' vouching for the prowess of the truck, the fact that they have to communicate using aircraft headphones should be a tip-off.\nA lot of what went into this build involved Griffin getting his hands dirty, which is always reflective when a vehicle's owner is so knowledgeable about their ride, to the point where they know the limitations and can tell you every last specification of the build.\nAlong with twin-turbos, the LS2 engine is built to the nines, as is the rest of the truck. At 20 psi, the striking blue Apache is pumping out 1400-horsepower, and at 40 psi, a jaw-dropping 2,000-horsepower. The best part is, it's all happening on radials.\n\"Slicks are for slow cars,\" Griffin told us in a recent chat about the truck.\nAll the effort put into the Chevy add up to a zero to sixty that falls under one second (estimated 0.8-seconds), and a truck that's not just confined to track - this beast is perfectly streetable!
