    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II [Saleen Martin](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7245115001/saleen-martin/) During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, [online records](https://rafbeaulieu.co.uk/honouring-the-airmen-of-raf-beaulieu/) show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",

    "title": "Plumbing Supply Firm Loses Appeal Over Sales Reps’ Overtime Pay",
    "text": "A federal appeals court has upheld a district court ruling that a wholesale distributor of plumbing supplies has wrongly exempted its inside sales representatives from overtime pay for years. The 1st Circuit Court of Appeals denied F.W. Webb’s request for a new hearing. As a result, the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) which sued the firm in 2020, will recover $4.2 million in overtime back wages from the plumbing supply firm for more than 700 inside sales representatives of the company. The department alleged that Webb violated the Fair Labor Standards Act by treating its inside sales representatives (ISRs) as exempt administrative employees and failing to pay them overtime premiums for their hours worked over 40 hours in a workweek. The department also alleged the employer failed to keep adequate and accurate records of hours worked. DOL argued that the ISRs are ineligible for the administrative exemption because their primary duty is to produce sales, Webb’s principal business is producing sales, and the ISRs are not predominately engaged in administrative work. Webb argued that the ISRs are covered under the administrative exemption because their primary duty is providing solutions to Webb’s customers and that they help develop strategy, and enjoy broad discretion and authority on matters of significance as part of their role. In June 2023, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of DOL on the exemption issue, as well as the overtime and recordkeeping claims. The district court concluded that the ISRs were not administratively exempt because they perform the very work that is F. W. Webb Co.’s primary business purpose, namely producing wholesale sales. The district court also found that the company had failed to pay the affected workers overtime back wages since August 2018 and violated recordkeeping provisions of the FLSA. In August 2023, the district court entered a consent judgment and stay order that preserved Webb’s right to appeal the district court’s summary judgment decision on the administrative exemption and resolved all other outstanding issues in the case. Webb appealed the summary judgment decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit in September 2023. On Aug. 1, 2024, the 1st Circuit affirmed the district court’s summary judgment decision, agreeing that Webb’s ISRs are not exempt administrative employees under the FLSA. The 1st Circuit said the affected employees’ “primary duties are not ‘administrative’ in any sense of the word.” Webb then petitioned the 1st Circuit to rehear the case en banc, which the 1st Circuit denied on Sept. 4, 2024. According to DOL, Webb has deposited approximately $4.2 million in back wages with the district court that DOL will distribute to the more than 700 employees in the event that Webb does not seek any further appellate review. Based in Bedford, Massachusetts, F.W. Webb Co. sells HVAC and plumbing and heating supplies, bathroom fixtures, pipe valves and fittings, and related equipment to contractors, industry professionals and homeowners. It has wholesale establishments in Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont. Was this article valuable?

    "text": "OHSAA expands postseason tournaments for high school track and field, cross country\nHigh school runners, jumpers, throwers and vaulters can rejoice.\nThe Ohio High School Athletic Association announced Thursday that postseason tournament divisions in track and field and cross country will be expanded beginning with the 2025-26 school year. The move was unanimously approved by the OHSAA's board of directors.\nTrack and field will add two divisions, increasing from three to five. Cross country will expand from three to four divisions.\nDivision I tournaments for both sports will have the smallest amount of schools. The number of schools in the other divisions will be divided as equally as possible.\nIn the current three-division format, the number of schools in each division are divided equally.\nThe Ohio Association of Track and Cross Country Coaches have made a number of proposals for expansion in both sports. Thursday's decision follows the OHSAA's recent tournament expansion of basketball, baseball, soccer, softball and girls volleyball.\n“We have been studying expansion in track and field and cross country for quite some time, just like how we studied expanding divisions in those teams sports,” OHSAA Executive Director Doug Ute said in a statement. “Adding divisions and decreasing the size of Division I has already brought such a positive change for those team sports, and now we have worked through the process to do that in track and field and cross country. We appreciate the dialogue with the OATCCC leadership and their assistance and patience.”\nDetails and postseason format information for track and field and cross country will be announced after the OHSAA board of directors approves the tournament regulations.\nReach Mike at mike.popovich@cantonrep.com\nOn X: @mpopovichREP",

    "title": "Gracias a hombres y caninos de la Armada Nacional, Montes de María ya es un territorio libre de minas antipersonal",
    "text": "Este logro representa un hito significativo para una región donde marcharon los ejércitos de la muerte: donde guerrilla y paramilitares, en alianza con la Fuerza Pública, dejaron más de medio centenar de mascares a campesinos inocentes, y envenenaron las tierras fértiles con minas antipersona, donde han caído guerreros e inocentes por igual, entre ellos muchos niños.Hoy, este anuncio de la Armada Nacional abre nuevas puertas a la paz, la esperanza y el desarrollo sostenible.Los habitantes de Montes de María pueden celebrar la recuperación de 770.670 metros cuadrados libres de sospecha de minas y 569.054 metros cuadrados de territorio completamente despejados, informa la Armada Nacional.(También: Cartagena le pone la lupa a $ 14 billones que vale el Plan de Desarrollo 2024- 2027 y exige que se vean las obras)Este avance ha permitido el retorno seguro de pobladores y campesinos a sus lugares de origen, donde ahora cultivan con confianza en los fértiles terrenos, impulsando así la economía local. La entrega oficial de esta subregión montemariana ha sido posible gracias al arduo trabajo del Batallón de Desminado e Ingenieros Anfibios de la Armada de Colombia. Durante años, este batallón ha llevado a cabo labores de desminado en los municipios de Cartagena, Córdoba, El Carmen de Bolívar, El Guamo, María la Baja, San Jacinto, San Juan de Nepomuceno, Santa Rosa de Lima, Villanueva y Zambrano en Bolívar; así como en Colosó, Corozal, Chalán, Galeras, Los Palmitos, Ovejas, Morroa, San Onofre y Sincelejo en Sucre.(Vale la pena leer: Cartagena: Juez ordena que sea devuelto apartamento que habría sido invadido a extranjero, por un vecino, en el Centro Histórico)\"El Carmen de Bolívar es el último municipio intervenido con la atención de 533 eventos sospechosos, 296 estudios no técnicos, 69 áreas peligrosas intervenidas, 108 artefactos destruidos, 1.264 personas capacidades en riesgo de minas y 378.575 metros cuadrados de área despejada\", señala la Armada Nacional.Estas acciones se enmarcan en los compromisos adquiridos por Colombia en la firma del Tratado de Ottawa, que prohíbe el empleo, almacenamiento, producción y transferencia de Minas Antipersonal. La Instancia Interinstitucional de Desminado Humanitario, conformada por el Ministerio de Defensa Nacional, la Oficina del Consejero Comisionado de Paz y la Inspección General de las Fuerzas Militares, asignó a la Compañía de Desminado Humanitario de la Armada de Colombia la tarea de erradicar la sospecha de contaminación por minas antipersonal en 19 municipios de la Subregión de los Montes de María.Durante este proceso, estos hombres y caninos realizaron investigaciones exhaustivas para identificar áreas contaminadas, y se llevaron a cabo intervenciones para neutralizar las amenazas encontradas.(Además: Este es el plan en Cartagena para combatir la violencia e inseguridad: analistas hablan)Un total de 2.250 Infantes de Marina del Batallón de Desminado e Ingenieros Anfibios participaron en estas operaciones, investigando 1.066 eventos sospechosos y neutralizando 251 amenazas, incluyendo minas antipersonales, munición sin explosionar y artefactos explosivos improvisados. Además del desminado, la Armada de Colombia llevó a cabo actividades de sensibilización en riesgo de minas antipersonal, capacitando a más de 5.695 habitantes de la región para identificar y reportar este tipo de artefactos explosivos.Estas iniciativas fueron monitoreadas por el programa de Acción Integral contra Minas Antipersonal de la Organización de los Estados Americanos, que certificó el cumplimiento de los estándares nacionales de desminado humanitario.El anuncio oficial de la liberación de Montes de María de minas antipersonal tuvo lugar en un acto simbólico en El Carmen de Bolívar, presidido por el Presidente de la República, Gustavo Petro, y acompañado por el Consejero Comisionado de Paz, Otty Patiño; el Ministro de Defensa, Iván Velásquez; la cúpula militar, autoridades locales y regionales, así como líderes de la comunidad. Este hito marca un paso importante hacia la consolidación de la paz y el desarrollo en la región del Caribe colombiano. La Armada de Colombia continuará trabajando para mantener las condiciones de seguridad en la zona, y hace un llamado a la comunidad a seguir apoyando las iniciativas de integración y desarrollo regional.El desminado de Montes de María es un ejemplo de cómo la cooperación y el compromiso pueden transformar una región afectada por el conflicto en un entorno seguro y próspero para sus habitantes.

    "title": "Viral photo of forlorn Spiral Hot Dogs owner leads to booming business",
    "text": "Customer's photo of forlorn owner in empty restaurant leads business to boom at OK diner Nick Chappell had never been to Spirals Hot Dogs & More before he took a photo of Scott Hosek in his empty restaurant. But after business boomed, Chappell's part of the Spirals family, Hosek says. [Anthony Robledo](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7612431001/anthony-robledo/) An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Hosek standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Hosek would soon have no time to stand around as \" [Spirals: Hot Dogs & More](https://spiralshotdogs.com/),\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Hosek told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Hosek found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Hosek said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Hosek wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': [See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her](/story/life/humankind/2023/12/26/dolly-parton-meets-longtime-fan/72033945007/) Customer knew he had to capture 'wholesome moment' Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance. Noticing Hosek gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\" \"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Hosek waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Owner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Hosek is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Hosek said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Hosek added.",

    "title": "#148 La queja de los turistas británicos sobre Benidorm: \"demasiados españoles\"",
    "text": "[alesay](/user/alesay)a [viajar.elperiodico.com](/go/link/3953499) [#5](c5#c-5) Añadiré un dato curioso oído de boca de un grupo de guiris (y de otros), algunos piensan que la gente no vive en la ciudad que pisa y que la gente vive en otros lugares creyendo realmente que es una especie de parque de atracciones pintoresco.\nOído en Madrid+pueblos de la comunidad, Valencia y Alicante. En sevilla lo que oí fue lo de siempre de que qué raro, la gente viste normal.\n[#43](c43#c-43) Puedes pasarte unos links?\nMi familia tiene un apartamento, y siempre que voy lo que peor llevo es el tema restaurantes. No se si es mala suerte, pero no encuentro termino medio: o es carísimo o es malísimo. A veces ambos.\nEs una pena, sobretodo cuando vienen amigos y no se a donde llevarles 😰\n[#119](c119#c-119) te recomiendo que, además de moverte por Benidorm, vayas a Villajoyosa y Altea. Hay restaurantes de mucha calidad. Si quieres algo más concreto por Benidorm te puedo decir.\nLo primero que hay que entender sobre Benidorm es que hay diferentes zonas y si bien está lo que los lugareños llamamos \"la zona guiri\", hay muchas otras zonas donde apenas hay extranjeros y es mayoría de turismo nacional o gente del pueblo.\n[#119](c119#c-119) El restaurante de un amigo se llama Beni Park. Está al principio de Poniente y allí dan muy buen servicio y comida a precio bueno, estando en primera línea es un lujo.\nUn restaurante algo más caro es el Ducado, en Levante. Buenas carnes y pescados, tapas y paellas, recomendable, 50 pavos por cabeza.\nEs verdad que lo normal aquí es encontrar la típica trampa para turistas si pruebas al azar.\n[#111](c111#c-111) también, y muchos días no te puedes bañar por presencia de arroáz, y muchísimas veces el mar está picado y hay bandera roja.\nEl norte es un asco en serio, hay lobos, osos se puede hacer senderismo, todos al sur.\n[#127](c127#c-127) Todo mojado, se necesita manta de noche por el frío la gente te mira raro, está todo boscoso sin asfaltar ni nada solo carreteras...\n[#139](c139#c-139) que si, que esos slogans están muy bien, ahora sustituye lo que generan esos 20-30 millones de turistas por otra cosa, que la gente tiene que comer. Es como los que se quejan en Canarias o Baleares del turismo, TODAS las islas de bue tiempo de europa viven de eso, no hay otra cosa. Pues en Benidorm o sitios similares igual\n[#94](c94#c-94) juas, solo en Benidorm hay más de 40.000 plazas hoteleras. Tendría que veranear allí medio país para ocupar eso\n[#137](c137#c-137) sigues sin entender la brutalidad que es tener más de 12 millones de plazas hoteleras al año, y no entiendes los costes operativos fijos de esas instalaciones, no, al 70% esos hoteles cierran, y más con los precios de los españoles (hola IMSERSO), es que no, el que no ve las cifras ni conoce la realidad habla de reconvertir, turismo sostenible y esas cosas, pero Benidorm es las vegas europeo, un decorado donde el 100% vive por y para el turismo de masas, y donde no ya sin ese turismo de masas, con la mitad (que sigue siendo una brutalidad de gente) el castillo se cae\n[#138](c138#c-138) Entender la entiendo pero no comparto tu opinión, que es distinto. He dicho que es complicado pero que es algo necesario si no queremos que sea un terra mítica para guiris (o un puy le fou).\nSi queremos turismo de calidad, no queda otra que reciclarse, de lo contrario seguiremos chupando culo guiri y aguantandoles las gracietas. La gente está harta no? pues a moverse. No he dicho nada más.\nRápido, hay que expulsar a los que parezcan españoles y en nuestra distopía contratar a figurantes que paseen por la zona turística que parezcan extranjeros. Hay que tener en cuenta que es prensa chatarra como el Daily Mirror.\n[#94](c94#c-94) Ya, pero el hostelero que tiene a 6 contratados para atender a 300 gilipollas o bien acabará con un solo empleado o bien cerrará el negocio por no salirle rentable. ¿O es que crees que el empresario no contrata en función del volumen de clientes que tenga?\n[#7](c7#c-7) Cierto, pero esos tabloides tienen millones de lectores, la basura infecta que publican es relevante (véase por ejemplo su influencia en el Brexit).\n[#105](c105#c-105) ya, pero el nivel de gente, cutrerio, fealdad urbanística y caspa solo lo puedes encontrar allí!\nvaya plaga de analfabetos que llega a ciertos sitios... aunque si las chorradas de este panfleto ayudan a que vengan menos bienvenida sea\n[#104](c104#c-104) si fueran los empresarios no me preocuparía, son los empleados quienes más sufrirían. Porque un bar en el que ahora hay 7 empleados, se puede quedar con uno solo y el empresario seguirá viviendo más o menos bien (vale, un poco peor), pero los 6 que se van a la calle, ya me cuentas...\n[#20](c20#c-20) Eso es verdad, se come muy bien y barato pero la zona guiri es un puñetero zoo... Y ojo porque siempre parece que hay jaleos.\n[#75](c75#c-75) Igual si no hubiese salido adelante se lo hubiera pensado pero algunos no aprenden ni por esas.\n[#140](c140#c-140) Si era muy maja y agradable, yo la conocí de bastante jovencita, pero supongo que no habra cambiado mucho.\n[#12](c12#c-12) Yo fui en una ocasión a hacer safari y me lo pasé bastante bien. Si te lo tomas como tal es divertido pero al mismo tiempo te da lástima porque es literalmente un parque de atracciones o un zoo para guiris. No cabe ni un alfiler y para colmo hay muchos lugares donde o hablas inglés o ni te miran, totalmente orientado a ellos y al bebercio.\nEs curioso eso de \"demasiados españoles\". No coincide con lo que yo he vivido. Los turistas ingleses siempre preguntan por algún sitio donde haya pocos ingleses.\n[#90](c90#c-90) De atender turistas nacionales, de turistas respetuosos internacionales y si me apuras se reconvertirán en puestos de otra cosa, igual hasta recuperamos industria. En vez de tener la zona petada de gente, sucia y sin tiempo para atenderlos decentemente se podrá tener el hotel y los restaurantes mejor acondicionados con menos gente y mejor tratada tanto clientes como trabajadores, la zona seguirá teniendo turismo pero será turismo tranquilo, sin follones y de calidad.\nYa va siendo hora de reconvertir el turismo de garrafón en turismo de calidad y es más fácil si dejan de venir guiris borrachos.\n[#106](c106#c-106) lo de reconvertir está muy bien pero solamente Benidorm tiene +40 mil plazas hoteleras, al mes son 1,2 millones. 1 de cada 4 españoles deberían pernoctar en Benidorm para llenar eso. Para que algunos entendáis lo \"complicado\" que es sustituir ese turismo de mierda cuando tienes esa infraestructura montada\n[#134](c134#c-134) La gente no duerme un solo día y se va, se quedan días y benidorm es una ciudad que siempre tiene turismo durante todo el año. Tampoco se trata de llenar hasta la bandera, con que haya una ocupación del 70% de media tienes un turismo mas tranquilo y muchas de las plazas hoteleras son como suele decirse \"de batalla\" porque no todo va a ser 5 estrellas, esas plazas se pueden convertir en hoteles mas decentes. Se trata de que la ciudad sacrifique cantidad en pos de calidad. Igual donde un hotel tenía 30 mini habitaciones pues ahora tiene 15 mas grandes por las que puede cobrar más y atender mejor.\nComplicado es desde luego pero es que no es sostenible la situación actual y si los guiris se buscan otros prados en los que abrevar pues mejor porque te quita el peso de tener que tener todas las plazas disponibles. España no se va a quedar sin turistas pero necesitamos empezar a proteger nuestro entorno y migrar a un turismo más sostenible para todos que yo oigo cada comentario de los guiris que asusta (uno que menciono mucho es que se creen que en las ciudades que visitan no vive nadie, que estamos ahí de npc o algo)\n[#106](c106#c-106) madre mía, ¡que nivel!\nO sea, que si se van todos los guiris (que todos, obviamente son unos irrespetuosos) nos quedamos con el turismo nacional (que todos son super respetuosos, por supuesto) y encima subimos los precios para que gasten los españolitos que tienen aproximadamente la mitad de salario que los alemanes que nos visitan. Un plan maestro. Sin fisuras!\n[#95](c95#c-95) Muy poco en realidad, hablaria con el unas tres o cuatro veces, un tío político mío era director de una de sus tiendas y yo trabajé en ella tres veranos en mi época de estudiante. Con quien realmente tuve bastante trato fue con su hija Clara, que por aquel entonces estaba trabajando en esa tienda de vendedora para aprender el negocio, hasta salíamos de fiesta juntos.\n[#136](c136#c-136) pues ahora es ella la que maneja el cotarro. Me parece una persona más sencilla. Yo me reunía mucho con su padre y fue muy interesante conocer su opiniones sobre negocios y economía.\nEsto de que 'había muchos españoles en el hotel o en la playa' es un chiste británico tan viejo como el Internet mismo. A veces que que remover la sopa, luego, otros veces no tanto.\n[#5](c5#c-5) hace años que no piso Benidorm, y cuando lo hice fué por un par de días, con lo que no sé como de \"vulgar\" se ha vuelto.\nDe lo que sí estoy seguro, es que si es verdad que se ha vuelto el destino mas vulgar de Europa, es por la avalancha de vulgares turistas británicos, pero es lo que pasa cuando se fomenta el turismo low cost... que te llevas lo peor de cada casa.",
