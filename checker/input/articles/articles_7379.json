    "title": "China Embarrassed When Brand-New Secret Nuclear Submarine Instantly Sinks",
    "text": "The country refuses to say anything about the debacle. Sub Drop Amid ongoing competition with the United States , China experienced a major setback earlier this year when its secret nuclear submarine sank right after being launched. As the Wall Street Journal reports based on intelligence from American officials, the incident that occurred in late May or early June near Wuhan was quickly and quietly covered up by government officials. Though most of the country's nuclear attack subs are manufactured in the northeastern Chinese city of Huludao, this new one seems to have been built in the Wuchang Shipyard near Wuhan. It was, WSJ's sources indicate, the first of a new class of submarines known as Zhou and featured a distinctive X-shaped stern. Because of the secretive nature of the entire operation — and the refusal by the Chinese government and its People's Liberation Army (PLA) to even admit that anything happened — the sinking remains murky. Experts outside the American government believe, however, that it was likely carrying nuclear fuel. \"It’s not surprising that the PLA Navy would try to conceal the fact that their new first-in-class nuclear-powered attack submarine sank pierside,\" a senior American defense official told the newspaper on condition of anonymity. \"In addition to the obvious questions about training standards and equipment quality, the incident raises deeper questions about the PLA’s internal accountability and oversight of China’s defense industry, which has long been plagued by corruption.\" Informed Observer Though satellite imagery acquired by the WSJ has since confirmed the existence of the new Zhou-class nuclear sub, a defense expert's posts on social media may well have been the first inklings the public got about it. Over the summer, former US submarine officer Thomas Shugart posted on X that he'd spotted floating cranes near the shipyard that, to him, seemed to signal there \"may be a new class of Chinese submarine out there.\" He was, as it turns out, correct — but he wasn't aware at the time that it was nuclear. \"Can you imagine a US nuclear submarine sinking in San Diego and the government hushes it up and doesn’t tell anybody about it?\" Shugart said in an interview with the WSJ. \"I mean, Holy Cow!\" Though satellite images suggest the wreckage has been salvaged, American officials told the newspaper that there's been no indication that Chinese officials have sampled the part of the Yangtze River where it sank for radiation. This isn't the end of the world, Shugart suggests, because the risk of a nuclear leak that soon into the sub's voyage is low. Though there's a possibility people were killed or injured during the sinking, there hasn't been any intelligence that confirms or denies this — which is yet another illustration of just how hazy this entire debacle really is.

    "text": "In front of a raucous Wednesday night crowd inside Dickies Arena, Leandro Zampollo (Pirassununga, Brazil) proved to be the toughest cowboy of them all, outriding the field to be crowned PBR’s (Professional Bull Riders) Last Cowboy Standing at the Fort Worth Stock Show & Rodeo. The win propelled Zampollo from No. 60 to No. 26 in the race for the 2025 World Championship as he chases his first gold buckle this May.\nAfter an intense two nights and four rounds of competition, the winner of the PBR Last Cowboy Standing, presented by PlainsCapital Bank, came down to four men: Zampollo, Kaique Pacheco (Itatiba, Brazil), Brady Fielder (Clermont, Queensland, Australia) and Ezekiel Mitchell (Rockdale, Texas).\nZampollo, however, was nearly eliminated, only earning a spot in the penultimate round after Daniel Keeping (Montague, Texas) was unable to compete to injury.\nThe New York Maverick rider in the separate PBR Teams league advanced to Round 4 courtesy of an 82.75-point ride on Lieutenant Dan (Farris Cattle/Big Schott Rodeo) and an 84.75-point effort atop Stryker (Cooper/Scruggs Bucking Bulls).\nThe Austin Gamblers’ Pacheco remained in contention for his unprecedented fourth Last Cowboy Standing title after covering Renegade (Hale/Vella/Ogden/Hart) for 84.5 points, Younts Brody’s Pet (Farris Cattle/Big Schott Rodeo) for 79 points and Sucker Pop (Spencer/Sherman Cattle Co./Farris) for 87 points.\nA proud member of Fort Worth’s own Texas Rattlers, Fielder advanced courtesy of two 86.5-point rides, topping Oyster Creek Brawler (Farris Cattle/Big Schott Rodeo) and Mr. Right Now (Silent 7/Hilton Bull Co.).\nFor Mitchell, he punched his ticket to the final rounds of the progressive elimination event by conquering Body Roc (Cooper/Scruggs bucking Bulls) for 86.25 points and Rowdy (Ogden Ranch/Hart Cattle Co.) for 85 points.\nIn the fourth round, Zampollo, Pacheco, Fielder and Mitchell all failed to make the 8. As a result, each member of the quartet advanced to Round 5 as the slate wiped clean and the top scoring rider was prepared to walk away the winner.\nThe round began with 2018 World Champion Pacheco, however, he failed to convert, tossed by Magic Hunter (Martinez Bucking Bulls, LLC) in 1.11 seconds.\nFielder next took to the chutes paired with Constant Payne (Flying S/Kasel/Payne). While he initially appeared centered, he was ultimately whipped down in 5.57 seconds.\nThird out was Mitchell. Nodding with confidence on Rock ‘n Roll (Raymond & Coy Henry/Lidgard), he came down in a heartbreaking 7.01 seconds.\nAs a result of the buckoffs, the event came down to Zampollo on Bamboozle (Farris Cattle/Big Schott Rodeo). Bursting from the chutes, the reserved Brazilian matched the powerful animal athlete jump-for-jump en route to the requisite 8 as the crowd erupted in cheer. Awarded 86 points, the qualified ride clinched Zampollo the title of PBR Last Cowboy Standing.\nThe golden finish earned Zampollo a check for $61,695.24 in addition to a crucial 133 Unleash The Beast points. He rose from No. 60 to No. 26 in the race for the 2025 World Championship.\nPacheco finished second collecting 46 Unleash The Beast points. He climbed from No. 24 to No. 19 as he seeks his second gold buckle.\nThird was Fielder. Garnering 35 Unleash The Beast points, the affable Australian rose from No. 3 to No. 2 in the world. He now trails No. 1 John Crimber (Decatur, Texas) by 59.5 points. The Florida Freedom’s Crimber did not compete in Fort Worth due to injury.\nMitchell concluded the event fourth, netting 44 Unleash The Beast points.\nFor more information about the 2025 Fort Worth Stock Show & Rodeo please visit FWSSR.com.

    "title": "Helping Your Printer Go Green: Sustainable Printing Practices",
    "text": "In today’s environmentally conscious world, it is important for businesses and individuals alike to adopt sustainable practices in all aspects of their operations. One area where sustainability can make a significant impact is in the realm of printing. By implementing green printing practices, you can help reduce waste, conserve resources, and minimize your carbon footprint. In this article, we will explore some sustainable printing practices that can help your printer go green.\nOptimize Print Settings for Efficiency One of the simplest yet most effective ways to promote sustainability in printing is by optimizing your print settings for efficiency. By default, printers often come with settings that prioritize speed and quality over resource conservation. However, by making a few adjustments, you can significantly reduce the amount of paper and ink used.\nConsider setting your printer to double-sided (duplex) printing as the default option. This will automatically print on both sides of the paper, effectively cutting your paper usage in half. Additionally, adjust your printer’s default resolution to a lower setting unless high-quality prints are absolutely necessary. Lower resolutions will use less ink and result in lighter prints that are still perfectly readable for most purposes.\nUse Recycled Paper and Eco-Friendly Inks Another way to make your printer more eco-friendly is by using recycled paper and eco-friendly inks. Traditional paper production involves cutting down trees and consuming large amounts of water and energy. By opting for recycled paper made from post-consumer waste, you can help reduce deforestation and save valuable resources.\nEco-friendly inks are also gaining popularity as they contain fewer harmful chemicals than traditional ink cartridges. Look for vegetable-based or soy-based inks when purchasing refills or new cartridges for your printer. These options are not only better for the environment but also produce vibrant prints with excellent color quality.\nPrint Only When Necessary A significant step towards sustainable printing practices is to print only when absolutely necessary. In today’s digital age, most documents can be stored, shared, and presented electronically. Embrace the use of digital platforms for storing and sharing files to minimize the need for physical copies.\nWhen printing is unavoidable, consider whether a black and white print would suffice instead of color. Black ink cartridges typically have a lower environmental impact than color ones. Additionally, before hitting the print button, ensure that you have thoroughly proofread the document to avoid reprints due to errors.\nRecycle Printer Cartridges Printer cartridges are one of the most common sources of waste in office environments. Instead of throwing them away after use, make it a habit to recycle your printer cartridges. Many manufacturers and office supply stores offer free recycling programs where you can drop off empty cartridges for proper disposal and recycling.\nIn addition to recycling, you can also explore options for refilling your printer cartridges with ink refill kits or by utilizing cartridge recycling services offered by various companies. This not only reduces waste but also saves money in the long run as refilled cartridges are often more affordable than new ones.\nBy implementing these sustainable printing practices, you can help your printer go green while reducing costs and contributing to environmental conservation efforts. Remember that every small step towards sustainability counts, and by making conscious choices in your printing habits, you can make a significant difference in preserving our planet’s resources for future generations.\nThis text was generated using a large language model, and select text has been reviewed and moderated for purposes such as readability.",

    "text": "Highlights - Elon Musk files a revised lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft for monopolistic practices. - Musk claims OpenAI betrayed its nonprofit mission by prioritizing commercial interests. - The lawsuit alleges OpenAI and Microsoft control nearly 70% of the generative AI market. Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has intensified his battle against OpenAI and Microsoft by filing a revised lawsuit on November 14. The legal move accuses the tech giants of monopolistic practices in the generative AI sector. Musk’s company, xAI, and Shivon Zilis, a Neuralink executive and former OpenAI board member, are among the plaintiffs challenging the alleged anticompetitive collaboration. Elon Musk Revises Lawsuit Against OpenAI & Microsoft The [amended lawsuit](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.433688/gov.uscourts.cand.433688.32.0_1.pdf) filed by Elon Musk on November 14 claims that OpenAI and Microsoft have formed a “de facto merger,” leveraging their combined dominance to stifle competition in the AI industry. The complaint accuses the companies of recruiting AI talent through extravagant salaries, reportedly spending $1.5 billion for a workforce of 1,500. Notably, reports indicate some OpenAI engineers earn up to $800,000 annually, including bonuses and stock options. Besides, the lawsuit also alleges that OpenAI discouraged investors from funding rival AI companies during a recent $6.6 billion fundraising round. Previously, several reports claimed that this stipulation aimed to block competitors, including Musk’s xAI, from securing critical investments. Despite these claims, SoftBank, which contributed $500 million to OpenAI’s funding round, has stated it retains the freedom to back other AI ventures. Meanwhile, lawyers for Musk argue the partnership between Microsoft and OpenAI creates a monopolistic environment, with the duo controlling nearly 70% of the generative AI market. The complaint suggests Microsoft has embedded itself deeply within OpenAI operations, blurring the lines between the two entities. Escalating Rivalry With OpenAI The amended lawsuit builds upon a series of disputes between Elon Musk and OpenAI. In March, Musk filed an initial suit against the AI firm and its founders, Sam Altman and Greg Brockman, accusing them of abandoning their nonprofit mission. Musk later withdrew the lawsuit without explanation but reignited the legal battle in August. The new lawsuit also highlights OpenAI’s shift to a for-profit model, which Musk claims betrays its original mission to advance AI for the benefit of humanity. Musk, who co-founded OpenAI in 2015, has alleged he was misled into supporting the organization, which now prioritizes commercial interests over ethical development. Notably, this report comes as [Sam Altman’s OpenAI is gearing up](https://coingape.com/ai-news-sam-altman-openai-to-launch-operator-task-automating-ai-tool/) to launch a new artificial intelligence tool named Operator. Besides, the [AI firm has also pulled funding](https://coingape.com/openai-pulls-6-6-bln-funding-as-valuation-tops-157-bln/) of $6.6 billion recently, which puts its valuation at $157 billion.
