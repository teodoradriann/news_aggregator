    "text": "FútbolUy. Seguinos en Twitter [@futbolportaluy](https://twitter.com/futbolportaluy) River Plate cayó 2-0 en su visita a Deportivo Riestra por la quinta fecha de la Liga Profesional del fútbol argentino y quedó sexto con nueve puntos, a uno de Racing, Talleres, Huracán, Unión y Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata, que es el único que ya jugó por esta etapa. En el cierre de su semestre, por haber sido el último partido antes del parate por la Copa América, el conjunto dirigido por Martín Demichelis mostró una pobre imagen y, sin sus jugadores citados para la Copa América, volvió a perder como visitante. Alan Barrionuevo abrió el tanteador a los 56’ con un buen golpe de cabeza y Nicolás Benegas liquidó el pleito a los 92’, cuando capitalizó un clarísimo penal que le cometió el uruguayo Sebastián Boselli después de un saque de banda que lo encontró mal parado. El zaguero ex Defensor Sporting disputó todo el encuentro al igual que su compatriota Nicolás Fonseca. Deportivo Riestra, de la mano de Christian Ogro Fabbiani como director técnico, le ganó a San Lorenzo 1-0 en el debut y luego sufrió tres derrotas al hilo, por lo que llegó a seis puntos con la victoria de hoy.

    "title": "Netflix adds WWE 2K games, quietly ditches multiple indie and double-A titles",
    "text": "Netflix is adding 2K’s WWE games to its games roster – but is also quietly removing multiple indie and double-A games from its current offering and future release slate.\nThe streaming giant said today that the WWE 2K games are coming to the service this autumn, as well as stating that there will be new interactive fiction games based on Netflix shows Ginny & Georgia, Sweet Magnolias, Love is Blind and Outer Banks, under its Netflix Stories brand.\nBut in keeping with the ongoing strategy shift at the streaming giant, it’s also quietly removing some indie and double-A titles from its live roster and forthcoming release slate.\nWhat’s on Netflix spotted that six games previously announced as coming in 2025 are no longer on the way. The streaming giant confirmed that Tales of the Shire, Thirsty Suitors, Compass Point: West, plus three games from indie dev Klei, Don’t Starve Together, Lab Rat and Rotwood, will no longer be coming to Netflix games.\nFrom Tuesday: ‘How Netflix greenlights games’. Netflix told What’s on Netflix that the decision not to add them to the service is “part of adjusting our portfolio as we learn more about what our members like.” Netflix PR also confirmed the same information to mobilegamer.biz.\nThe same report notes that several other indie/double-A games have been removed from the service recently, including Ustwo’s Delta: The Memories Between, Ubisoft’s Mighty Quest Rogue Palace and Yacht Club Games’ Shovel Knight: Pocket Dungeon.\nThe shift away from indie and double-A type games makes sense in light of last week’s Netflix earnings call, in which coCEO Greg Peters said the firm is refocusing on more mainstream fare – mostly narrative, party, kids and known-IP games.\n“We continue to refine our strategy,” he told investors. “And we’re going to be focusing on more narrative games based on Netflix IP. These are consistent fan favorites and we’ve got a lot in the library to work with there.”\nFrom last week: ‘Netflix is refocusing on narrative, party, kids and known-IP games’. “We’ll also be introducing party and couch co-op games on TV delivered from the cloud. We think of this as a successor to family board game night or an evolution of what the game show on TV used to be.”\nPeters continued: “We’ll deliver games for kids. This is no ads, no in-app payments. It’s a safe space for kids just included with your subscription.”\n“And of course, we want to do more recognizable mainstream titles, whether that is licensed titles like GTA and we’re going to have more of those big licensed titles to come that we’re looking forward to as well as homegrown titles based on our IP like Squid Game: Unleashed”.\nAs we reported recently , Netflix is also currently hiring for what it has described as a Stardew Valley-like life sim drived by AI, plus projects involving “dual-screen gaming”.",

L’association avait constaté que certains lycées de la région Auvergne Rhône-Alpes ne respectaient pas la loi imposant un menu végétarien obligatoire par semaine.\nMalgré des demandes de l’association, la Région n'avait pas fourni les documents prouvant qu’il mettait tout en œuvre pour faire appliquer la loi dans les établissements. Florence Dubessy, vice-présidente déléguée à l’Education avait même déclaré dans certains médias que \"la Région n’entend pas se soumettre aux injonctions délirantes d’associations extrémistes minoritaires\".\nLe tribunal administratif de Lyon donne donc un mois à la Région pour agir.

D’autres véhicules du voisinage ont en effet subi la même hargne, dans ce quartier pourtant « tranquille », « à deux pas » de la police municipale.\nPas la première fois La responsable évoque des dégradations, légères, contre des véhicules, il y a quelques semaines déjà. « Des rétroviseurs avaient nécessité des réparations, des personnes avaient dû frapper fort dedans. »\nÀ lire aussi\nGuerre en Ukraine : une vingtaine de réfugiés accueillie au Havre par la Croix-Rouge Presque rien par rapport à cette nuit du lundi 25 au mardi 26 décembre.
