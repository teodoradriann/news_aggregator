    "text": "ASEAN and EU leaders and experts took decisive steps for marine protection and sustainable fisheries. — The ASEAN Network for Combating IUU Fishing (AN-IUU) and the European Union (EU) have united once more to bolster efforts against Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing. At the recent 4th Regional Workshop of the ASEAN Network for Combating IUU Fishing in Partnership with the EU, held from 17 to 18 July in Bangkok, Thailand, ASEAN Member States took decisive steps through enhanced information exchange, improved implementation of guidelines, and expert technical support. IUU fishing remains a critical global threat, endangering marine environments and security. As demand for affordable protein sources rapidly increases in Southeast Asia, IUU fishing practices are on the rise, undermining sustainability and conservation efforts. ‘With ASEAN’s vast maritime territories and significant seafood industries, IUU fishing poses a significant regional threat, eroding economic benefits and food security. Consequently, ASEAN is committed to combatting IUU fishing to enhance marine resource protection and ensure the sustainability of our fisheries. We are prioritising collaborative efforts to address this cross-border issue.’ stated Mr Choltisak Chawpaknum, Director of Fisheries Foreign Affairs Division, Department of Fisheries of Thailand. ‘The EU is committed to supporting ASEAN in tackling IUU fishing,’ confirmed H.E. David Daly, Ambassador of the European Union to Thailand. He added: ‘Worldwide, IUU fishing activities are responsible for the loss of 11 to 26 million tonnes of fish each year, which translates into an economic value of EUR 9 to 23 billion. It is estimated that 1 in every 5 fish caught comes from IUU fishing. Our joint efforts to eradicate this practice are pivotal in establishing a robust international framework for marine protection and sustainable fisheries.’ The workshop focused on implementing the [Guidelines for Sharing, Access to, and Use of IUU Fishing-Related Information](https://asean.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/11.-Guidelines-for-Sharing-Access-to-and-Use-of-IUU-Fishing-Related-Information-Adopted.pdf). Discussions covered the effective use of the AN-IUU platform, best practices in information sharing, and strategies for enhancing regulatory measures and enforcement procedures. Experts from the EU and other international organisations provided invaluable insights. Thailand, as the host country of the AN-IUU Centre and the AN-IUU Interactive Platform, has been playing a pivotal role in the AN-IUU partnership with the EU and the preparation of this 4th workshop. It also organised a field visit to fishing ports in Samut Prakan province. Participants observed vessel and landing inspections. These practical demonstrations showcased the process of information input through relevant platforms and systematic information sharing among stakeholders. The workshop was supported by the EU through the Enhanced Regional EU-ASEAN Dialogue Instrument (E-READI), a demand-driven cooperation programme supporting EU-ASEAN dialogues, and fostering regional integration, in strong collaboration with AN-IUU, a regional initiative enhancing ASEAN Member States’ cooperation to combat IUU fishing. # The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) was established on 8 August 1967.

    "title": "Consejos de Enel Colombia para el ahorro de energía en el hogar | Bogota.gov.co",
    "text": "Consumir energía de forma eficiente no solo es una buena manera de ahorrar en la factura de tu servicio, también es un hábito que todos debemos adoptar en estos tiempos de [conciencia ambiental.](https://www.enel.com.co/es/historias/a202002-por-amor-a-la-tierra-celebremos-el-dia-de-la-energia.html) Por este motivo, [Enel Colombia](https://www.enel.com.co/es.html), le brinda a la ciudadanía una serie de recomendaciones para el ahorro de energía en el hogar. Además de seguir consejos como aprovechar la luz del día, utilizar bombillos ahorradores led o apagar las luces cuando no las estés usando; es importante seguir ciertas recomendaciones para que tu consumo de energía sea más eficiente. Contenidos relacionados Para comenzar, si vas a comprar un electrodoméstico nuevo prefiere los de bajo consumo clasificados con las letras A, B y C. Recuerda que si tienen las letras D y E son de consumo medio, y los de letras F y G, de alto consumo. Con los tuyos, ten en cuenta que: ● La nevera es uno de los electrodomésticos que más consumen energía (aproximadamente el 30%). Para que este consumo no aumente, mantenla en una temperatura no tan fría (entre 2 y 6 grados), y lejos de hornos o lavadoras. Además, evita guardar alimentos calientes para no sobrecargar el compresor, intenta abrirla la menor cantidad de veces y siempre asegúrate de que esté bien cerrada. ● Para utilizar eficientemente la estufa y el horno, usa siempre recipientes acordes al tamaño de los alimentos que vas a preparar y tápalos mientras se cocinan. Otro truco sencillo es aprovechar el calor residual para terminar la cocción y fijarte que el diámetro de la hornilla no supere el recipiente. ● La limpieza es fundamental en el hogar, por eso, para usar mejor tu lavadora prefiere siempre los ciclos cortos con agua fría y las cargas completas. En cuanto a la hora del baño, es recomendable instalar duchas eléctricas que consumen menos energía. ● Para un entretenimiento eficiente, elige los de tecnología led porque consumen 25% menos que un LCD y 40% menos que los de las pantallas plasma. Además, intenta desconectarlos cuando no los estés usando. Cuidado con el consumo stand by Stand by, así se denomina el consumo silencioso de tus electrodomésticos aun cuando están apagados. Electrodomésticos como televisores y decodificadores, laptops, consolas de videojuego, microondas, cafeteras, cargadores de celular siguen consumiendo entre 5% y 8% de energía si están conectados. ¿Qué puedes hacer? Adquiere un enchufe inteligente o un multitoma en el que puedes conectar varios equipos y así mismo, desconectarlos al mismo tiempo o de forma remota: Así ahorrarás el 10% en tu consumo mensual de energía. Si estás pensando en adquirir uno y este se controla a través de una app, fíjate si es compatible con tu celular y con la intensidad del voltaje de tus electrodomésticos; también prefiere los de tamaño medio que no obstruyan la conexión de otros aparatos. En cuanto a sus funcionalidades generales, el modo away activa, por seguridad, los aparatos cuando no hay nadie en casa; algunos cuentan con monitorización de consumo, ayudándote a medir tu consumo eléctrico, y los más sotisficados se activan a través de asistentes virtuales. Con o sin estos enchufes, consume energía de forma eficiente aprovechando el horario valle, o de menor consumo energético, para usar tus electrodomésticos en su mayor capacidad. Así mismo, evita el horario pico (6 pm y las 8 pm) que es donde se genera mayor consumo. Como puedes ver, la forma más fácil de ahorrar energía es usándola eficientemente y ser consciente de que [consumirla responsablemente depende de ti](https://www.enel.com.co/es/personas/ahorro-energia-eficiencia-energetica.html), así como de las prácticas que incorpores a diario en tu casa o lugar de trabajo. 👉🏻 Conoce tu consumo en el simulador de Enel ingresando [aquí](https://www.enel.com.co/es/personas/servicio-al-cliente/calcula-gasto-electrica-con-el-simulador-de-consumo.html).",

    "text": "Irán pide a la CIJ a hacer historia al dictar una orden que cese los crímenes israelíes y ayude a poner fin a la prolongada ocupación ilegal de Palestina.\n“Se espera que esta Corte, una vez más, haga historia al emitir una opinión consultiva histórica en apoyo del derecho a la libre determinación del pueblo palestino que finalmente pueda ayudar a poner fin a la prolongada ocupación ilegal de Palestina”, ha indicado este jueves el viceministro de Asuntos Exteriores para Asuntos Jurídicos e Internacionales de Irán, Reza Nayafi, leyendo la declaración de la República Islámica durante el procedimiento oral ante la Corte Internacional de Justicia (CIJ) sobre las consecuencias jurídicas de la ocupación israelí de los territorios palestinos desde 1967.\nEl diplomático iraní ha alertado de que “la ocupación de los territorios palestinos es la ocupación militar más larga que existe en la actualidad. El derecho a la autodeterminación del pueblo palestino seguirá siendo violado mientras esta ocupación continúe; esta violación constante frustra la capacidad de Palestina de confiar en los derechos y obligaciones del Estado, según el derecho internacional, privándolos de su derecho inalienable a la autodeterminación, incluido su derecho a vivir en libertad, justicia y dignidad”.\nEl enviado iraní a La Haya ha subrayado que “esta declaración no implicará de ninguna manera nuestro reconocimiento de Israel”.\nBrasil y Chile piden a CIJ que declare ilegal ocupación israelí de Palestina | HISPANTV Brasil y chile acusaron a Israel de violencia sistemática del derecho internacional del pueblo palestino y le llamaron culpable por ignorar resoluciones de la Organización de las Naciones Unidas (ONU).\n“Seguimos en un punto de inflexión en la historia de la humanidad; la opinión de esta Corte puede sentar las bases para salvar las vidas de miles de mujeres y niños inocentes, y contribuir a la demanda legítima de un pueblo privado de su derecho inherente a la autodeterminación durante décadas”, ha afirmado.\nHaciendo hincapié en la competencia de la CIJ para dar la opinión consultiva solicitada por la Asamblea General de las Naciones Unidas (AGNU), Nayafi ha expresado: “Hay consecuencias jurídicas que surgen de la ocupación prolongada de los territorios palestinos por el régimen ocupante israelí en violación del derecho del pueblo palestino que nunca he experimentado el derecho a la autodeterminación”.\nEn alusión a la propuesta de Irán de celebrar un referéndum nacional en Palestina para que el pueblo palestino pueda decidir su propio destino, como la única solución para el conflicto entre ambas partes, ha agregado que “habiendo explicado en detalle las consecuencias jurídicas que se derivan de este estatuto para todos los Estados y las Naciones Unidas, reiteraré el plan inclusivo presentado anteriormente por la República Islámica de Irán a las Naciones Unidas para la realización del derecho de los palestinos a la libre determinación”.\nTambién ha instado a la CIJ a opinar que las políticas y prácticas de Israel deben cesar de inmediato ya que continúan violando el derecho de autodeterminación del pueblo palestino.\nLas audiencias públicas en la CIJ sobre los efectos de las prácticas del régimen israelí en Palestina comenzaron este lunes 19 de febrero.\n‘Apartheid de Israel con los palestinos es peor que el de Sudáfrica’ Más de 50 Estados y al menos tres organizaciones internacionales presentarán a los jueces del máximo tribunal de las Naciones Unidas sus argumentos sobre la legalidad o no de la ocupación israelí en los territorios palestinos hasta el 26 de febrero.\nColombia: Israel aplica un apartheid contra la población palestina China defiende derecho a lucha armada de palestinos contra opresión israelí Se espera una opinión legal no vinculante después de meses de deliberación por parte de los jueces.\nEl lunes, los representantes palestinos presentaron sus argumentos sobre el tema al pedir a la CIJ declarar que la ocupación israelí de Palestina es “ilegal y debe terminar de forma inmediata, total e incondicional”, argumentando de que “el genocidio en curso” en Gaza es resultado de “décadas de impunidad” de ese régimen, que ha matado al menos 29 313 palestinos en la guerra desde el 7 de octubre.\n“El genocidio en curso en Gaza es resultado de décadas de impunidad e inacción”, en las que Israel solo “ha dado tres opciones al pueblo palestino: desplazamiento, subyugación o muerte”, puntualizó el ministro palestino de Exteriores, Riad al-Maliki.\nEl régimen sionista no asistirá a las audiencias, pero envió una declaración escrita de cinco páginas alegando que una opinión consultiva sería “dañina” para los intentos de resolver el conflicto porque las preguntas planteadas por la Asamblea General de la ONU muestran prejuicios.\ntmv/ctl/rba",
