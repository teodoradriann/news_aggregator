    "text": "ST. CLOUD, Fla. (WFTV/CNN/CNN Newsource/WKRC) - A Catholic priest bit a woman after denying her Communion. A woman in Florida said she was bitten by a priest after being denied Communion on Sunday. It happened at St. Thomas Aquinas Church in St. Cloud, Florida. An woman, who has not been identified, said when she tried to receive communion, she was bitten by the priest. The priest was identified on police body camera video as Father Fidel. The woman told authorities in St. Cloud that a scuffle broke out when she attempted to receive communion. \"He wouldn't give me the cookie. I don't know if it was the way I was dressed, or if it is what I like,\" the woman told police, per WFTV. A witness told police that she was singled out because of her sexuality and attire. \"So he tried to forcefully shove it in her mouth she backed up she said 'no don't do that' and she tried to get it and that is when he went crazy,\" the witness told police, per the outlet. The confrontation could be seen on a feed for the church's online stream. The priest has a different account of the events that took place, however, per WFTV. The priest said that the woman came to the 10:00 a.m. mass, but didn't appear to know the process of receiving communion, so he denied her the bread. He told authorities that she came back to another service and tried again, claiming that the confrontation occurred when she attempted to grab the bread out of his hand. He told police that he was protecting the bread, as it is considered the Body of Christ in the Catholic religion. \"I am not judging you, I am asking you, did you confess after mass. If you did not confess, I cannot give you Communion. I bit her, I am not denying that. I am defending myself and the Sacrament,\" the priest told police, per the outlet. Father Fidel made it clear that this was the only reason he bit her, adding that he didn't know the woman's sexual orientation, nor did he care. \"I don't judge anybody,\" Father Fidel told police. Father Fidel declined to common on the situation when WFTV reached out to the church. A man outside the church told the station to call the Diocese of Orlando instead.",

Así se estableció mediante un acuerdo de cooperación entre ese organismo y algunas facultades de la UNT.\nContreras remarcó que el acompañamiento del equipo de Asistencia Integral a víctimas de trata de personas (Punto Focal Tucumán) fue determinante para lograr el objetivo.\n\"La efectivización de este acuerdo posibilitó que la víctima accediera a un empleo genuino en planta permanente, logrando así un avance importante en la restitución de sus derechos y la inclusión a un empleo formal, en pos de fortalecer su proyecto de vida, tal como lo establece la Ley 26.364 y 26.842\", dijo.\nPor otra parte, en el marco del convenio celebrado entre el Consejo Federal del Hábitat y el Comité Ejecutivo para la Lucha contra la Trata de Personas, se entregó en Tucumán una vivienda del Instituto Nacional de la Vivienda (IPV) a otra victima de trata. Este tipo de políticas públicas colaboran, significativamente, en el abordaje integral de asistencia y acceso a derechos.\nMientras tanto, el comité de lucha contra la trata, Delegación Tucumán, trabaja en su agenda 2024. Se continuarán desarrollando operativos en lugares como el Aeropuerto Benjamín Matienzo y la Terminal de Ómnibus. Se sumarán algunos nuevos puntos turísticos como Tafí del Valle, San Pedro de Colalao y El Cadillal; con el objetivo de dar a conocer cada vez a más personas el mensaje de la línea 145 de consulta y denuncias anónima y gratuita.",

    "text": "Despite inflation and rising stress about the uncertain state of the economy, Americans are traveling at record numbers, with no signs of slowing down. According to data from Mastercard, global travel grew 25 percent year-over-year from 2022 to 2023, and is now above pre-pandemic levels. On top of that, travelers are increasingly seeking unique experiences, spending 65 percent more this year on experiences.\nAs travel writers, this comes as no surprise. Airports were chaos this year, perhaps more than ever. Everyone, it seems, is looking for an escape—and we're here to help make your next trip one of the best.\nWhy You Should Trust Us Andy Cochrane spends nearly half his life on the road, in airport lounges, sidestreet cafes, noisy taxis, and odd hotels, chasing stories about interesting places and unique people. Moreover, Austa Somvichian-Clausen is a travel journalist, published author, and hospitality entrepreneur.\nAfter years of globetrotting, it’s time for us to give back. Here are our recommendations for the trips you should to take in 2024. We put an emphasis on thoughtful tour operators with an eye on sustainability and community development, as well as adventure travel (it's the Men's Journal way).\nArgentine Patagonia Ushuaia, Tierra del Fuego, ArgentinaIzzet Keribar&solGetty Images\nWhere to Book: Black Tomato Mitre Peninsula Trek For the intrepid traveler, the Mitre Peninsula in Argentina should be at the top of your bucket list. Incredibly remote and preserved, it’s not the kind of destination you journey to solo, or without scrupulous planning and the right permits. Luckily, luxury travel group Black Tomato is adding the far-flung destination to its catalog in 2024, with a never-before-done expedition as part of its new \"See You in the Moment\" collection of trips. Because the most memorable bits of travel hinge upon the shared experience of an outstanding meal, formative event, special journey, fulfilling challenge, or milestone celebration, these ~30 itineraries are meant to be embarked upon in a group—with family or friends—and categorized by The Meal, The Event, The Challenge, The Journey, and The Celebration. This expedition to the Andes falls under The Challenge and will test your endurance in a thrilling way—whether hiking, sailing, or riding on horseback, staying in nomadic campsites along the way.\nWhat to Do The expedition begins in Ushuai, and what happens next depends on the needs and desires of your group, since Black Tomato expeditions are highly tailored. Helicopter and sail boat transportation could combine with sections of hiking and horseback riding to the tip of Tierra del Fuego, encountering snow-capped peaks, dense evergreen forests, glaciers, and glistening fjords. Extra experiences can also be added, such as history and geography lessons, a private yacht voyage to Isla de los Estados, and flying in a chef for a one-of-a-kind dining experience.\nVal d'Orcia, Tuscany Monteverdi Tuscany is a cyclist's paradise as it's set on a medieval hilltop.Andy Cochrane\nWhere to Book and Stay: Monteverdi Tuscany For those looking for the perfect balance of adventure, relaxation, and food, Monteverdi Tuscany is a top pick.

Balinese culture, in the region of Ubud, is a vibrant tapestry woven with intricate rituals, colorful ceremonies, and traditional arts, deeply rooted in Hindu-Balinese spirituality. What makes it truly unique is the seamless integration of daily life with spiritual practices, evident in the ornate temples, elaborate dance performances, and communal ceremonies that showcase the island's profound connection among art, religion, and community.\nWhat to Do At boutique hotel Viceroy Bali, set on the edge of a stunning ridge overlooking the lush Valley of the Kings, visitors next year are able to book bespoke experiences to peek (respectfully) into the unique culture and rituals of Bali.

Its Bernese Oberland Haute Route, for instance, includes four days of ski touring in some of the most stunning and remote locations in the world. During your tour, you’ll try your hand at epic glacier skiing by day, and spend nights warming up and celebrating in huts in the Jungfrau-Aletsch UNESCO World Heritage area. It helps that Jungfraujoch, aka the \"Top of Europe,\" is bathed in 365 days of powder every year.\nOkavango Delta, Botswana Wilderness meets luxury in the Okavango.Peter Adams&solGetty Images\nWhere to Book: Natural Selection The Okavango Delta, a unique seasonal wetland area of Botswana known for lush biodiversity, might sound like the kind of place you only get to see through the pages of National Geographic. Once that might've been true, but lately it's been opening up as the frontier for a new kind of safari from thoughtful operators that are rooted in sustainability and a community-oriented approach.
