    "title": "Initial Drawdown Complete, Klamath Basin Restoration Has Begun Ahead of Historic Dam Removal This Fall | Lost Coast Outpost | Humboldt County News",
    "text": "### With the largest dam removal project in U.S. history mere months away from its scheduled completion, work has officially begun on restoring the Lower Klamath Basin to conditions not seen for more than a century. Up to 20 billion seeds comprising 98 different species are now being spread across newly exposed landscapes that have sat mostly underwater for the past 100 years. In a project update presented via Zoom Thursday morning, Klamath River Renewal Corporation CEO Mark Bransom said the reservoirs have been drained behind the four dams slated for removal: JC Boyle, Copco No. 1, Iron Gate and Copco No. 2, which [was already brought down last month](https://lostcoastoutpost.com/2024/jan/24/video-boom-copco-dam-blast-sends-klamath-river-flo/). ### “It’s important to note that these four dams basically bisect the Klamath watershed into a lower and an upper region, and of course [the dams] have blocked the migration of fish and other species up and down the river” since they were installed, Bransom said. After taking ownership of the four dams from electric power company PacifiCorp in late 2022, the Klamath River Renewal Corporation (KRRC) spent last year preparing for drawdown and dam removal. With initial drawdown complete, it’s now a waiting game for spring runoff and storm flows to flush through the system, returning the Klamath to base flow conditions by the fall. “And that is the point at which we will be prepared to initiate dam removal,” Bransom said. KRRC estimates that somewhere between 17 million and 20 million cubic yards of sediment have accumulated behind the dams over the past century, and scientists figure that about a third of that volume — 5 million to 7 million cubic yards — was mobilized during the drawdown. That sediment traveled downstream through the river system, much of it flowing out to the Pacific Ocean, “thereby restoring [a really critical function](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/southwest-biological-science-center/science/river-sediment-dynamics#:~:text=Sediment%20transport%20in%20rivers%20is,either%20get%20deposited%20or%20eroded.) in a healthy river system,” Bransom said. That sediment volume of 5 million to 7 million cubic yards is roughly equivalent to the amount produced in the lower Klamath annually, Bransom explained, and this surplus was released during the winter because that’s when fisheries agencies and local tribes determined that it would have the fewest biological impacts. “Most of the [fish] juveniles are up in the tributaries and have not yet started their out-migration to the ocean,” Bransom said. ### Here are before-and-after photos of Copco No. 2’s removal: BEFORE: AFTER: ### During the project update, Dave Coffman, Northern California and Southern Oregon operations director with Resource Environmental Solutions (RES), offered an update on the work of his employer, which is in charge of water quality and sediment monitoring. That monitoring work has been ongoing for more than a year in a collaborative effort between RES, the Karuk Tribe and the U.S. Geological Survey, Coffman said. He also elaborated on the revegetation efforts, which began in 2018 with the collection of 13 million-15 million seeds by hand, primarily through a partnership with the Yurok Tribe. Those seeds were then propagated at nurseries up and down the West Coast, resulting in a total seed source of 17 billion-20 billion. “We can honestly say now, the restoration truly is underway,” Coffman said. “We’ve had revegetation crews out on reservoir sediments since the 15th of January.” ### While the majority of the planting and seeding is being done by hand, crews will soon continue the work via helicopter, laying down seed in more remote and muddy areas that are inaccessible on foot. Coffman said this revegetation should be wrapped up by mid-March. Here’s a map of the restoration plan for the Copco Lake area: ### In the coming months, as spring runoff passes through the system, crews will work on decommissioning the now-defunct powerhouses, among other tasks. “Once we get to the spring and see the river back down to base flow condition, we’ll get out and initiate the removal of JC Boyle, Iron Gate and Copco No. 1 more or less simultaneously,” Bransom said. Crews aim to have dam removal completed and the river restored to its free-flowing condition by September or early October, if not sooner. “The goal is to be entirely out of the river in time for the fall [salmon] run and to have reopened some of the upper tributaries and main stem for fish that may be coming through,” he said.

    "title": "Moscow Alarmed By Kyiv’s Increased Interest In Ethnic Ukrainians Across Russia – Analysis",
    "text": "Moscow Alarmed By Kyiv’s Increased Interest In Ethnic Ukrainians Across Russia – Analysis By [Paul Goble](https://www.eurasiareview.com/author/paul-goble/) On January 22, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed a decree calling for Kyiv to devote more attention to the fate of ethnic Ukrainians living in Russia ( [President of Ukraine](https://www.president.gov.ua/documents/172024-49513), January 22; see [ EDM](https://jamestown.org/program/kyiv-raises-stakes-by-expanding-appeals-to-ukrainian-wedges-inside-russia/), January 25). Kremlin officials and commentators view the decree as an indication of Ukrainian aggressiveness and an attack on Russia’s territorial integrity. Perhaps more importantly, some see it as an effort to call into question Russian President Vladimir Putin’s insistence that Russians and Ukrainians are one people. Others believe that the measure is meant to undermine domestic support for the Russian war effort and a broader policy of support for non-Russian nationalist and secessionist movements (Vzglyad, January 22; Ukraina.ru, January 24; Business Gazeta, January 28; [ Izvestia](https://iz.ru/1641978/2024-01-30/v-sovbeze-rf-nazvali-absurdnymi-pretenzii-kieva-na-kuban), January 30). Paradoxically, these Russians see Zelenskyy’s move as larger and more threatening than many in Ukraine and the West do. Many observers in the West and Ukraine have focused solely on the Ukrainian president’s explicit call for expanded attention to ethnic Ukrainians in the portions of Russia bordering Ukraine rather than on the rest of his text ( [Kavkaz Realii](https://www.kavkazr.com/a/zapretnaya-identichnostj-zachem-zelenskiy-priznal-kubanj-i-don-istoricheski-naselennymi-ukraintsami-/32792777.html), January 26). Zelenskyy also called for more attention to the other regions and nations within the Russian Federation that are further away from the Ukrainian border, which include ethnic Ukrainians as well. As so often happens, the Russian reaction may prove more significant than Zelenskyy’s specific intentions. Those in Moscow who view Zelenskyy’s decree as an expansion of Kyiv’s longstanding policies have their reasons. Some Russian writers point to Ukraine’s persistent interest in ethnic Ukrainians across the Russian Federation all the way to the Pacific Ocean ( [Apostrophe.ua](https://apostrophe.ua/article/politics/foreign-policy/2024-01-29/ot-belgoroda-do-vladivostoka-mojno-li-spasti-ukraintsev-v-rossii/56265), January 29; [ Sibir’ Realii](https://www.sibreal.org/a/zeleny-klyn-kak-ukraincy-osvaivali-dalnii-vostok/32795931.html), January 29; [ Bloknot](https://bloknot.ru/obshhestvo/kak-zelenskij-podtverdil-stat-yu-putina-ob-istoricheskom-edinstve-russkih-i-ukraintsev-1238413.html), January 31). Additionally, they refer to Kyiv’s increasing support for non-Russian ethnic groups within Russia, especially those national movements that are on the rise (see [ EDM](https://jamestown.org/program/ukrainian-deputies-press-kyiv-to-recognize-chechnya-ichkeria-and-circassian-genocide/), July 28, 2022). These analysts also comment on Zelenskyy’s increasing willingness to call Putin’s Russia “an evil empire,” as former US President Ronald Reagan called the Soviet Union 40 years ago (see [EDM](https://jamestown.org/program/zelenskyy-defines-putins-russia-as-an-evil-empire/), October 13, 2022). Many in Moscow are concerned that, despite claims to the contrary, Russia’s program of assimilating Ukrainians is not working and that many of the nominally assimilated remain Ukrainians at heart. The fear is growing that the Ukrainians living in Russia are waiting for the chance to express their true sentiments once Moscow has been significantly weakened and Ukraine and the West have grown in strength. This possibility will likely increase as other nations expand their protests against the Kremlin. A year ago, Nikolai Patrushev, secretary of the Russian Security Council, was explicit on this point (Argumenty i fakty, January 10, 2023; see [ EDM](https://jamestown.org/program/moscow-alarmed-by-kyivs-interest-in-russian-far-east-and-with-good-reason/), June 8, 2023). There is little reason to think that such worries have lessened, especially with increased attacks on Russian military and transportation facilities east of the Urals These attacks have almost certainly been carried out by “assimilated” Ukrainians in support of Ukraine ( [Stoletie](https://www.stoletie.ru/lenta/fsb_khabarovchanin_planiroval_pokushenije_na_vojennyh_po_zadaniju_kijeva_684.htm), January 19; [ The New Times](https://newtimes.ru/articles/detail/246064), January 23). In contrast, most Ukrainian and Western analysts view Zelenskyy’s latest decree as having a more limited scope. Above all, they point to the fact that the Ukrainian president explicitly talked about the Ukrainian or formerly Ukrainian regions in Russia along Ukraine’s eastern border and made no mention of other “wedges”—Kyiv’s term for regions across Russia that, in the past or currently, have sizeable Ukrainian populations ( [President of Ukraine](https://www.president.gov.ua/documents/172024-49513), January 22; Kavkaz Realii, [January 22](http://kavkazr.com/a/kubanj-i-rostov-vklyucheny-v-ukaz-zelenskogo-ob-istoricheski-naselennyh-ukraintsami-territoriyah-rf-/32786700.html), [ January 26](https://www.kavkazr.com/a/zapretnaya-identichnostj-zachem-zelenskiy-priznal-kubanj-i-don-istoricheski-naselennymi-ukraintsami-/32792777.html)). These writers also touch on the notion that Zelenskyy’s actions have broader implications. They discuss how assimilation has reduced the number of Ukrainians recorded by the Russian census from over three million in the early 2000s to under 900,000. Additionally, they highlight the closing of Ukrainian institutions and restrictions on the Ukrainian language throughout Russia since 2014 ( [Kavkaz Realii](https://www.kavkazr.com/a/my-ih-srazu-poprosili-podaljshe-na-yuge-rossii-zakryvayutsya-ukrainskie-natsionaljno-kuljturnye-obschestva/32308485.html), March 14, 2023; [ Apostrophe.ua](https://apostrophe.ua/article/politics/foreign-policy/2024-01-29/ot-belgoroda-do-vladivostoka-mojno-li-spasti-ukraintsev-v-rossii/56265), January 29). Russian observers are likely to see the arguments of Ukrainian officials and commentators that Zelenskyy’s words are more about attracting Western attention to what Moscow has done as confirmation of their views. They believe that these efforts are an attempt to generate more support for Ukraine in the West and to force more Western populations to accept the fact that Putin’s empire is about to disintegrate, just as the Russian Empire did in 1917 and the Soviet Union in 1991. (On Ukrainian efforts to do just that, see the comments of former Ukrainian Foreign Minister Volodymyr Ogryzko at [ Glavred](https://glavred.info/article/chi-pretenduye-ukrajina-na-kuban-bilgorod-i-voronezh-ogrizko-pro-istorichniy-ukaz-zelenskogo-10536515.html), January 29.) Kremlin analysts are even more convinced that their assessments of Ukrainian policies are correct based on comments from Volodymyr Postnikov, a commentator in Kyiv who used to work with ethnic Ukrainians in Russia in the 1990s. In a recent article, Postnikov speaks to an even deeper fear in the Kremlin and says there are now few committed Ukrainians left in Russia ( [Censoru.NET](https://censoru.net/2024/01/29/vojna-okonchatelno-postavit-tochku-na-istorii-ukraincev-rossii.html), January 29). While he acknowledges that Moscow’s assimilation policies have been successful among ethnic Ukrainians in the country, he points out that the Kremlin’s success parallels Kyiv’s own success with ethnic Russians in Ukraine, who are identifying more frequently as civic or even ethnic Ukrainians. Postnikov argues that Kyiv should not be under any illusions that it can reverse the process in Russia. Still, Moscow should not be under any similar illusions about what it can do regarding ethnic Russians and Ukrainians in Ukraine. According to the Ukrainian analyst, the current realities are the final sorting out of these communities into two nations, precisely the opposite of what Putin has declared as his goal. Putin cannot possibly accept Postnikov’s perspective. The Kremlin leader appears more likely to use his favored method of repression to end the history of the Ukrainian community in Russia quickly as part of his war effort against Ukraine. Such an approach will likely backfire, leading more Ukrainians and non-Russians to view Moscow as the enemy, more ethnic Russians in Ukraine to identify as Ukrainians, and more in the West to recognize the Kremlin’s true intentions. The current realities in Russia are exactly the opposite of what Putin seeks and are compelling reasons for viewing Zelenskyy’s decree as having far more sweeping intentions and consequences than many in Ukraine and the West now envisage.
