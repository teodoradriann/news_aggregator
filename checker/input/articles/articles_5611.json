    "title": "LA Knight's Career Might Have Already Peaked In WWE",
    "text": "When LA Knight first debuted as Max Dupri on the WWE main roster, it felt like he was doomed to fail. Fans of NWA and TNA knew what he was capable of, and his run in NXT had been successful enough to suggest his character did not need to change on the main roster. But Vince being Vince, he made him the manager of Maximum Male Models . Then Vince McMahon went away and Triple H took over, leading to the return of LA Knight. He quickly got over with fans with his brash personality, fiery promo style, and in-ring ability.\nRelated 10 Backstage Tales About LA Knight Fans Should Know While LA Knight is a relatively new phenomenon to many, his career goes back about two decades, which means there are a lot of backstage stories.\nPosts That popularity even had him briefly ascending to the main event, where he challenged Roman Reigns for the Undisputed WWE Championship . He didn't succeed, but fans bought into him as a main event star. A high-profile feud with Logan Paul won him the United States Championship , but instead of elevating him to the next level, his title reign was when the wheels began to come off. Shinsuke Nakamura soundly beat him, and Knight appears to have settled into a midcard role that sees him win some and lose some. Fans may not want to hear it, but it's very likely that he has already hit his ceiling in WWE, and it's not a very high one.\nWWE's Roster Is Just Too Stacked There Are Only So Many Main Event Spots To Go Around\nWWE has several established main-event stars. LA Knight got a shot at the spotlight before settling back into the midcard. The top-heavy roster is to LA Knight's detriment. It's great for fans and a booking headache for Triple H, but WWE's roster is incredibly stacked right now. Beyond major stars like Cody Rhodes, Roman Reigns , and CM Punk, or even legends like Randy Orton or John Cena, Drew McIntyre, Kevin Owens, and Seth Rollins make up a fraction of the wrestlers established in the main event.\nRelated 10 WWE Wrestlers Who Had One Shot At The Main Event (And Missed) Making it to the main event scene in WWE is something many wrestlers dream of. While the following names got a shot at it, they had a short run.\nPosts It is practically impossible at this point for another wrestler to break into the main event for a sustained run with marquee wins. LA Knight got a second in the main event spotlight before he was shunted back to the midcard. That's hardly the worst place to be, but it spells bad news for anyone holding out for Knight's actual main event run.\nLong Title Reigns In WWE Are Limiting Triple H's Booking Style Doesn't Favor Someone Like LA Knight\nTriple H loves lengthy world title reigns. LA Knight has no clear route to main event gold. Knight could benefit massively from winning the Money in the Bank briefcase. Triple H's booking has brought back logical, long-term storytelling with far-reaching consequences for the roster. He hasn't been perfect, but his work has been a massive upgrade when compared to Vince McMahon's last few years in charge. A bane and boon of Triple H's style has been his preference for lengthy world title reigns. Gunther has been World Heavyweight Champion for about six months, and Cody is at around the 300-day mark.\nBefore Gunther, Damian Priest was champion for over three months, and inaugural champion Seth Rollins held the gold for nearly a year. For fans to buy into a wrestler as a main event star in the long run, winning a world championship sure helps. Look no further than the concerns surrounding Jey Uso's main event run , which saw him fail to win a world title yet again. Wrestlers can still be elevated to that level without a title around their waist, but it sure helps. Unless WWE invests significant time into giving Knight a story that keeps him in the main event, he's going to stay in the midcard. A Money in the Bank win would suit someone like Knight perfectly, just as it suited Damian Priest, who is now a certified main-eventer.\nLA Knight Is Missing That One Thing To Take Him To The Next Level LA Knight Has No True Rival Or Long-Building Story To Turn To\nKnight has been a lone wolf on SmackDown. LA Knight has no clear allies, or an epic feud. Fans' investment in LA Knight is surface-level right now. Kevin Owens' multi-year blood feud with Roman Reigns was the catalyst for his heel turn against Cody Rhodes. When Damian Priest became World Heavyweight Champion, WWE was already planting the seeds for his eventual feud with Finn Balor . He used the title to elevate himself and once he lost the gold, there was a clear storyline waiting for him.\nRelated Lone Wolves: 10 WWE Wrestlers Who Were Surprisingly Never In A Stable Call them the Lone Wolves, because these wrestlers were surprisingly never in a stable during their WWE run.\nPosts LA Knight has been a lone wolf. He has no true allies to build a long-term story with or a career-defining rivalry. The WWE Universe's investment in LA Knight is surface-level at the moment, and the last several months have made it clear that without a deeper connection, Knight is not going to make it to the next level.\nOn a more optimistic note, Knight has been mostly injury-free throughout his career, so being over 40 is no big deal. Furthermore, WWE fans are willing to embrace him as a main-eventer, so the promotion just needs to put a portion of the machine behind him, and magic can happen. The real question remains, will it ever happen?",

    "text": "According to a recent permit filing, Golden Roosters will soon open its new Downtown location at 115 Occidental Ave S. “We will try to open on January 15th of 2024! We will be doing fried chicken in a sports bar. We even have a 180-inch projector installed for customers to watch games,” the owner, Sean Yoon, told What Now Seattle . “As a sports fan in Seattle, I couldn’t find a good sports bar for local fans. I always wanted to make a sports bar and have a touch of Korean food, and I would love to make space for sports fans in Downtown Seattle.” Sean had expressed that the fried chicken would specifically be of Korean origin. The hallmark of Korean fried chicken is often considered to be its double-frying technique. The chicken is first fried at a lower temperature to cook the meat thoroughly, and then it undergoes a second round of frying at a higher temperature. This dual-frying process results in exceptionally crisp and light skin while ensuring the meat inside remains juicy and tender. One of the most popular variations is the yangnyeom chicken, which involves coating the fried chicken in a sweet and spicy glaze made with ingredients like gochujang (Korean red chili paste), soy sauce, garlic, and ginger. The sauce imparts a balance of heat, sweetness, and umami to the chicken. In addition to yangnyeom chicken, there are various other flavors and styles of Korean fried chicken. Ganjang chicken, for example, features a soy-based glaze that is savory and slightly sweet, offering a different taste experience. Some variations also include cheese, honey, or additional toppings like green onions and sesame seeds for added depth and texture.

Tras los [ intentos de Boeing](https://www.hosteltur.com/165472_boeing-intenta-despejar-la-huelga-con-el-mejor-contrato-de-la-historia.html) de frenar el último capítulo de la crisis en la que se halla inmersa el [ gigante aeronáutico](https://www.hosteltur.com/tag/boeing), los trabajadores han decidido por aplastante mayoría -el 96%- rechazar el acuerdo al que se había llegado con los sindicatos que contemplaba un incremento general de los salarios del 25% en cuatro años. Será la primera huelga de la empresa en 16 años. La anterior fue en 2008 y tuvo un seguimiento de más de 50 días que paralizó la producción y le costó a Boeing unos 100 millones de dólares por día, según señalan medios estadounidenses como Wall Street Journal, según recoge EFE. En concreto, cerca del 95 % de los miembros del sindicato International Association of Machinist (IAM, por sus siglas en inglés) que reperesenta a más de 33.000 trabajadores, ha votado en contra del acuerdo que incluía el citado incremento salarial hasta 2027. En este sentido, señalan que los aumentos salariales propuestos son escasos tras una década de estancamiento salarial y a tenor del aumento del coste de la vida. La puntilla a la crisis de Boeing Esta huelga detendrá la producción de aviones de Boeing, en un momento en el que la compañía arrastra problemas tras el incidente del avión Boeing 737 MAX 9 de Alaska Airlines en pleno vuelo, y acentuará la falta de aviones en el sector aéreo. En el marco de las negociaciones, el reciente director ejecutivo de Boeing, Kelly Ortberg, había pedido a los trabajadores que no hiciera huelga y realizó algunas visitas a las fábricas.

    "title": "#38 Un atentado islamista durante la misa de Navidad deja más de 160 cristianos asesinados en Nigeria",
    "text": "[Expat_Guinea_Ecuatorial](/user/Expat_Guinea_Ecuatorial)a [gaceta.es](/go/link/3891432) [#0](c0#c-0) Ese titular es tendencioso y confuso, y probablemente seas consciente. El ataque no fue durante una misa, como quiere dar a entender, si no que se atacó una serie de aldeas de manera coordinada. Y además, el factor religioso no es el único relevante, y tampoco está plenamente confirmado.\nHay fuentes mucho más serias, informadas y rigurosas que la que has mandado...\n[#10](c10#c-10) Resulta difícil creer que puedan existir fuentes más serias leyendo maravillas cosas como:\nLa reciente matanza sucedida en Navidad confirma lo que anuncian las estadísticas: el cristianismo es la religión más perseguida en el mundo. Y no se limita solamente a esta región de África, sino que ocurre en Asia y Medio Oriente. Hace poco a cristianos perseguidos por el régimen comunista chino se les negó asilo en la España de Pedro Sánchez y el PSOE. Solo una lo pudo obtener porque su salud le impedía subir al avión donde la deportaban.\nTodo ello, mientras las pateras siguen llegando a España, posiblemente con insurgentes tan radicales como los que masacran a los cristianos en Nigeria y sin el amparo para los cristianos que huyen de estos.\n[#9](c9#c-9) bueno. Entérate quién financio al valeroso pueblo de Afganistán y sus valerosos guerreros los muyahidines( les dedicaron Rambo iii y todo), o quien armó y financio a Irak, a estos que ves ahora este terrible atentado de la noticia, quien los organizo y financió, ... Después nos vuelves a contar estás cosas. Y si sigues pensando que está irán detrás de todo pq es omnipresente vale. Si ves q algún otro estado puede estar implicado, fijate quién lo arma y financia. Un saludo.\n[#13](c13#c-13) lo se y lo he criticado 100 millones de veces, dinero de EEUU y Arabia Saudita y Pakistán.\nPero eso no les importa para llamarlos partisanos, \"que en Europa les habría llamado partisanos y que habrían luchado contra los nazis\"\nEso es mierda, el fanatismo religioso no atiende a razones.\nAl menos tu comentario muestra algo de vergüenza de esa gente... Algo es algo.\n[#20](c20#c-20) pues mira otra vez la captura que mandas, pq es exactamente lo que estoy diciendo. Afganistán era un país más adelantado que España y las mujeres iban sin velo. El tío Sam puso a la derecha religiosa conservadora, o lo que viene a ser los fascistas de toda la vida, pero en musulmán, a levantarse en armas... Cómo en Irak, libia, Egipto, Ucrania... Mismo proceder en todos lados, mismo resultado en todos lados. Países de mierda con gobiernos autoritarios y la población paupérrima y reprimida. Eso es el tío Sam.\n[#30](c30#c-30) Claro, Afganistan era un paraiso...\nhttps://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerra_de_Afganist%C3%A1n_(1978-1992))\nTienes una vision de la historia bastante distorsionada. China tambien dio armas a los talibanes para luchar contra la URSS, entre otros tantos paises....\nClaaaaaaro, todo culpa del tio sam...\n[#31](c31#c-31) entérate lo que era Afganistán antes del 92.\nEra un estado laico. En el año 90 la mayoría del profesorado eran mujeres, por ejemplo, que estaba integrada en el mundo laboral.\nY la revolución hostigada por el tío Sam puso a los integristas islámicos. Los valerosos muyahidines, como dijeron en Rambo 3, que les dedicaron.\nInfórmate tú un poquito, antes de hablar sin saber.\n[#14](c14#c-14) Yo no apoyo yihadistas, eso es Israel que apoya a DAESH\nYo soy de izquierdas, no apoyo a la extrema derecha\nNo es muy dificil de entender, ánimo\n[#18](c18#c-18) otro comentario más de \"la culpa es de todos menos de la yihad y los países de mierda donde reina la sharia\"\nHoy te estás coronado máquina.\nQue lastima que estes aquí criticando a occidente para tapar mierdas de asesinos fanatizados y no allí al revés como los verdaderos mártires que si luchan por denunciar atrocidades de países islámicos, ahí veríamos lo valiente que eres con tu reinvidicacion de sofa y tu bandera nazi con la israelí en la foto de perfil.\n[#25](c25#c-25) Financiasteis a los talibanes para combatir a los rusos y ahora estamos pagando los platos\nFinanciar ISIS para destruir oriente medio\nFinanciar siempre lo peor para seguir con los genocidios, apartheid, limpieza étnica...\n[#26](c26#c-26) \"Financiasteis a los talibanes\"\nyo no financie a nadie, manipulador de pacotilla. Típico de esos de la bandera de tu perfil.\nMuestras muchos decíamos que la primavera árabe está plagado de fanáticos religiosos que apoyaban las reveliones, tantos otros decían que \"callate, hacen lo que deberíamos estar haciendo en Europa, es una revolución\". Ahora a gente como tú, si tu, que estás criticando a los críticos con el yihadismo de hamas se le avisa que apoyar grupos terroristas que hacen matanzas públicas es una barbaridad y que esto les embalentona y atrae a más fanáticos y que será la perdición de Palestina no escucháis. Dentro de 10 años saldrán muchos de Europa que han visto gritos de Allahu adbak y tontos en Internet diciendo que el único error de hamas es no haber actuado antes... Luego habrán chavales que pensarán que están siendo héroes en un Isis o unos talibanes dando su vida por puercos que vienen a cuerpo de rey con 4 mujeres y esclavas sexuales.\nMira, igual en que en Gaza, pero estos no lo llaman masacre.\nhttps://www.lavanguardia.com/internacional/20231217/9456963/iglesia-denuncia-israel-mato-sangre-fria-dos-feligresas-gaza.html\nhttps://es.zenit.org/2023/12/12/22-cristianos-muertos-en-gaza-cohete-sin-detonar-hallado-en-parroquia/\n[#9](c9#c-9) ¿En qué parte de su comentario dice eso? \"no son culpables de sus actos\" y toda la mierda que sigue. O qué parte de su comentario te ha llevado a esa conclusión, si es que necesitas algo más de margen.\nAunque es posible que esa respuesta no tenga nada que ver con su comentario y simplemente sea una patética y lamentable pataleta porque no te ha gustado su respuesta.\n[#17](c17#c-17) \"por no sé que historia\".\n¿O por \"no quiero saber\"? Te dan la oportunidad de aprender, no la desperdicies.\n[#19](c19#c-19) tienes algún comentario de crítica o de repudio a esta atrocidad? O vienes aquí a adoctrinar me sobre lo malo que es eeuu?\nEs una noticia de 160 muertos a manos de yihadistas por ser infieles.\nEntre tu y yo? Es duro entrar aquí a un noticia tan trágica y ponerte a discutir sobre si la culpa es o no es de occidente o ya estás curado de eso?\nEntras aquí a recalcar que \"no quiero saber\" tu verdad... Que ascazo.\n[#21](c21#c-21) Eres tú quien ha introducido este tema. Igual esperabas otro tipo de respuestas y ahora te arrepientes de haberte puesto a chapotear con intención de salpicar a los demás.\n[#23](c23#c-23) en todo momento denunció:\n1* las atrocidades de grupos islamistas radicales, no como tantos aquí que aprendieron que eran los talibanes hace 2 meses y ahora los llaman partisanos. Asesinos es su nombre, como es el del gobierno de irán o Arabia Saudita ente otros.\n2* crítico a los que claramente ocultan y defienden a estos asesinos bajo un pretexto de victimismo en Palestina.\nUn terrorista es un terrorista y lo es con 0 muertos en Palestina y con un millón de muertos.\n[#27](c27#c-27) 1a parte todo bien. Segunda, ya no tanto ¿Cómo que terrorista se es y punto?\n¿Crees de verdad que si a esta gente nadie estuviera tocándole los huevos en su casa harían lo mismo?\nIr a la raíz del problema, a las causas, e intentar desenredar un tema complejo no es defender a nadie.\nEstos son los que en Francia, España e Italia eran llamados partisanos por que no se que mierdas de las circunstancias? O estos los podemos llamar terroristas?\nLa yihad se lleva a cabo con muerte de infieles y el miedo a serlo.\nNo se trata de liberar nada, cada ataque sirve para atraer radicales y causar estragos en los no creyetes.\nQuien apoya a yihadistas es tan asesino como ellos.\n[#3](c3#c-3) Estos son los que llevan EEUU y UK financiando más de un siglo\nA lo más fundamentalista y extremista\nAquí cuando iban a la casa blanca a recibir paguitas\nhttps://es.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archivo:Reagan_sitting_with_people_from_the_Afghanistan-Pakistan_region_in_February_1983.jpg\n[#8](c8#c-8) bajo ninguna circunstancia son culpables de sus actos, siempre es otro, la culpa siempre será de EEUU, de UK, de la sociedad, de la Bernarda, pero nunca ellos y su fanatismo religioso serán los culpables para vosotros.\nVuestra fijación por defender o tapar cada asesino terrorista con escusas es repugnante y os rebaja como... Voy a decir seres humanos.\nEs decir para vosotros el fanatismo islámico viene de un supuesto apoyo de EEUU a hamas y no de irán...\nBoko haram es un paso de baile radicalizado por EEUU.\nLos talibanes son partisanos radicalizados por EEUU.\nLos hermanos musulmanes se radicalizado jugando call of duty.\nPero jamás lobbys, poderes y dinero de países radicales apoyan a estos grupos de mierda.\nAsí es vuestro mundo.\n[#12](c12#c-12) pero si tu pecas de lo mismo.\nA quien coño quieres dar lecciones?\nEEUU: apoyo yihadistas para quitarse de en medio a un enemigo común.\nTu: apoyas yihadistas para quitarte de en medio un enemigo común.\nEso que tienes ahí llamando nazis es la bandera de Israel no? Imagino que no eres simpatizante, pues eso.\nLa única deferencia entre EEUU y vosotros es que a EEUU sólo le movía la política, a vosotros os pierde el fanatismo.\nSabes lo que más me revienta de vosotros? Que no vais a ser vosotros quien caiga en esa oscuridad por vuestra culpa.\nHabrá niños de 15 que se sentirán libertadores, partisanos, defensores poniendo bombas para un estado islámico por vuestra culpa y vuestros comentarios.",

    "text": "После мытья головы ванна покрывается волосами, а расческа напоминает ежа?\nВозможно, виноват не стресс, а ваш шампунь.\nМногие средства содержат сульфаты — агрессивные компоненты, которые смывают естественную защиту кожи.\nПроверьте состав: если в первых строчках есть SLS (Sodium Lauryl Sulfate) или SLES (Sodium Laureth Sulfate), это как мыть волосы средством для посуды.\nТакие шампуни пересушивают кожу, вызывая зуд и перхоть, а волосы становятся ломкими. Еще один враг — силиконы (оканчиваются на -cone или -xane).\nОни создают иллюзию гладкости, но со временем забивают поры, мешая питанию фолликулов. Но и это не всё! Парабены и искусственные ароматизаторы вызывают аллергию, из-за которой волосы могут выпадать пучками.\nЧтобы проверить, насколько ваш шампунь безопасен, взболтайте его в стакане с водой. Если пена обильная и долго не оседает, а вода мутная — средство перегружено химией.\nХороший шампунь дает мало пены и быстро растворяется. Переходите на мягкие формулы с натуральными маслами или попробуйте мыть голову ржаной мукой: она абсорбирует грязь, не нарушая pH.\nА для блеска ополаскивайте волосы отваром крапивы или ромашки. И не мойте волосы горячей водой — она активирует сальные железы, заставляя вас мыть голову чаще.\nЕсли волосы жирнеют у корней, но сухие на кончиках, попробуйте метод «мыть только корни»: наносите шампунь на кожу головы, а концы промывайте водой.\nИ никогда не расчесывайте мокрые волосы — они легко ломаются.",

    "text": "Tottenham avança de fase na Copa da Inglaterra\nEm casa, time londrino busca sempre o gol diante do Burnley. E o chorado 1 a 0 vem no finzinho, uma pintura de Pedro Porro\nO Tottenham recebeu o Burnley, pela terceira fase da Copa da Inglaterra, nesta sexta-feira (5/1). Em jogo duríssimo, venceu por 1 a 0, graças a um golaço de Pedro Porro, no segundo tempo. Com esta vitória, os Spurs avançam à quarta fase da competição. O Burnley está eliminado.\nEm casa, o Tottenham, como era de se esperar, buscou o ataque. Assim, teve oportunidades para abrir o placar em finalizações de Richarlison (duas vezes) e Johnson. Mas em nenhum momento desta etapa o time se mostrou feliz nos arremates. O Burnley, às vezes aparecia próximo da área dos Spurs. Mas Odobert perdeu a melhor chance dos visitantes.\nTottenham fura a retranca\nVeio o segundo tempo e o Tottenham ficou em cima. O zagueiro brasileiro Emerson Royal passou a ser um elemento-surpresa apoiando o ataque como lateral-direito e Pedro Porro (o lateral-direito) quase um ponta. Royal se tornou a melhor opção ofensiva para tentar furar a retranca. Numa delas, deixou Johnson em condições de marcar. Contudo, o goleiro Muric salvou.\nO empate levaria a decisão a um jogo-extra na casa do Burley para se saber qual time avançaria de fase. Era tudo o que a torcida não queria.; E ela já estava nervosa quando, aos 33 minutos, veio o alívio. O goleiro Muric evitou um lance de perigo de Richalison e tentou ligar um contra-ataque. Mas a bola foi interceptada por Pedro Porro, que ajeitou e mandou cruzado de fora da área. Uma pintura que definiu o 1 a 0, E, desta forma, a vaga do Tottenham à quarta fase.\nSiga o Jogada10 nas redes sociais:\nFacebook.",
