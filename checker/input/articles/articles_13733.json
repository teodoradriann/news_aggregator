    "title": "IUML: BJP using Ram Temple consecration event for political purposes",
    "text": "IUML: BJP using Ram Temple consecration event for political purposes Malappuram (Kerala), Dec 29 (PTI) The Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), a key ally of the Congress-led UDF in Kerala, accused the BJP on Friday of exploiting the consecration ceremony of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya for political purposes. The IUML expressed hope that secular forces would recognise this political manoeuvre of the BJP. Amid increasing uncertainty in the Congress's Kerala state unit on the political stance the party should take regarding the invitation to its national leadership for the Ram Temple consecration ceremony on January 22, the IUML urged the Congress to take an independent decision. \"The BJP is treating it as a political inauguration for the upcoming Lok Sabha polls. The prime minister and others have launched a political propaganda aimed at the next parliamentary election,\" IUML National General Secretary P K Kunhalikutty told reporters after the party's political affairs committee meeting. Alleging that the saffron party is politicising the event by differentiating between those who participate in it and those who don't, Kunhalikutty said, \"The BJP government's target is the next parliamentary elections. The League highly respects the faith and freedom of worship of the Hindu community. No comment on that. But the opening of the Ram temple is being used politically.\" He said the issue is political, not religious, and called on every political party, especially those with secular views, to realise this and take independent decisions. On the Congress's stand, Kunhalikutty said, \"Congress has its own set up, leadership. They are facing a lot of problems. Let them take an independent decision.\" IUML supremo Sadiq Ali Shihab Thangal added that the IUML supports the faithful on the issue but cannot accept the attempt to turn it into a political agenda for the upcoming Lok Sabha polls. The IUML's statement is seen as an attempt to exert pressure on the Congress's state unit, which is in a difficult position regarding the invitation extended to its national leaders for the consecration ceremony next month. The ruling CPI(M) in the state has already declared that its representatives will not attend the ceremony, considering it a political move by the BJP ahead of the general elections that are to be held in a few months.

    "title": "Rahul Gandhi embraces his new role as head of India’s opposition",
    "text": "Rahul Gandhi has been credited for the Congress Party&#039;s impressive result in the recent general elections. In his new role as leader of the opposition in parliament, Gandhi has not stopped railing against the ruling BJP. Rahul Gandhi is the most recognizable face of India&#039;s newly resurgent opposition Just three days after a crowd crush disaster at a religious event in northern Uttar Pradesh state killed over 120 people, Rahul Gandhi, the newly appointed leader of the opposition in the lower house of India&#039;s parliament, visited the site to meet with family members of those killed. &quot;It is a matter of grief that so many families have suffered, so many have lost their lives,&quot; Gandhi told reporters after meeting with the families. &quot;I don&#039;t want to speak through a political prism, but there have been some lapses on the part of the administration. There have been mistakes, which should be identified.&quot; Soon after, Gandhi visited relief camps in Manipur, a state in northeastern India that has been torn by ethnic conflict. &quot;I want to tell Manipur, I come here as your brother. I want to work with you to bring back peace in Manipur,&quot; he said. At each stop, Gandhi railed against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). For Gandhi, who has often been portrayed as an unserious politician, the gains by his Congress Party and the opposition in the recently concluded national elections have given him a wider, more prominent platform to take on the BJP. New role, same rhetoric Despite having won a third consecutive term, Prime Minister Modi&#039;s BJP failed to win an outright majority and now relies on coalition partners to remain in power. In his first address to parliament earlier this month, his first since being appointed leader of the opposition, Gandhi picked up from where he left off in his campaign by attacking Modi&#039;s government on various fronts. &quot;All religions talk about courage. All our great men have spoken about non-violence and fear. But those who call themselves Hindu only talk about violence, hatred, untruth,&quot; said Gandhi, referring to the BJP. He finished the statement by asking in Hindi, &quot;Are you Hindu or not?&quot; This remark led to loud protests from the BJP members and their allies. The comment was considered so inflammatory that it was later expunged from the parliamentary record. For many, though, the comments signaled a change in the power dynamics of the newly constituted legislature. &quot;Gandhi surprised Modi and his political opponents by his sharp speech in parliament. He has emerged as a powerful voice on issues that have put the government on the defensive,&quot; political analyst Rasheed Kidwai told DW. &quot;Gandhi wants to prove his detractors wrong that he lacks application and avoids a position of responsibility.&quot; Rahul Gandhi embarked on a two-month-long cross-country campaign march prior to the 2024 Indian general election Gandhi&#039;s more prominent role As the Congress Party&#039;s most prominent face, Gandhi&#039;s popularity has soared since the election. His image was bolstered in the run-up to the election as Gandhi embarked on a 6,700-kilometer-long (4,160 miles) trek across India. Some observers believe that these actions have transformed his image into that of a &quot;poor man&#039;s leader.&quot; &quot;His constant mention of social justice, and saving the Constitution not only pulled in more listeners but has solidified his support base. For the first time, there was great coherence in Gandhi&#039;s pitch,&quot; Alishan Jafri, a commentator told DW, adding that Gandhi needs to continue to debate Modi on real issues that matter to all Indians. &quot;Modi has altered the thought process of many Indians. They see rights with contempt and government as the ultimate authority before which all subjects must kneel. For Gandhi, the real challenge is to remind the people that all Indians have the right to have rights,&quot; added Jafri. Political columnist Radhika Ramaseshan told DW that Gandhi&#039;s new position is markedly different from his previous stint as the Congress president. &quot;The difference this time is that he has accepted a constitutional post. The Congress party&#039;s vastly improved performance in the elections has given him the confidence he lacked,&quot; said Ramaseshan. She pointed out that these were still early days and Gandhi will be tested in and out of parliament. &quot;Consistency is all-important to motivate the Congress workers and galvanize their morale. It is a long haul and the onus to take the party to a position where it can respectably challenge the BJP lies squarely on Gandhi.&quot; Edited by Ole Tangen Jr Before you leave: Every Friday, the DW Asia newsletter delivers compelling articles and videos from around the continent right to your inbox.

    "title": "Maternity Nurses Protect Newborn Babies During Taiwan Earthquake",
    "text": " Maternity nurses at a Taiwanese hospital jumped into action to protect newborn babies during the country's magnitude 7.4 earthquake. A CTV video, released April 4, shows two nurses at Ma Cherie Maternity Centre in Taipei, Taiwan holding tiny cots with newborns during the shaking, as a third nurse rushes in to help steady the beds. One of the nurses managed to lock the wheel of a cot in place with her foot. According to [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/scores-remain-missing-taiwans-biggest-earthquake-25-years-rcna146335), the April 3 morning earthquake, which occurred near the eastern city of Hualien, was the biggest the country has experienced in 25 years. The earthquake killed at least 10 people and injured 1,099, reported NBC News; 705 people are trapped under rubble and 15 are missing. “Of course we were scared, very scared, but I think this is the natural instinct of a maternity staff,\" Chen Ting-Chin, the supervisor of Ma Cherie Maternity Centre told Reuters. \"The safety of the babies is of utmost importance.” On X, the nurses were called \"brave\" and the footage \"beautiful.\" One family who lives in Hualien County told [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/taiwan-earthquake-cracks-walls-shatters-memories-one-family-2024-04-04/) their home is too dangerous to stay in. “I saw how this spot was damaged and felt really sad. I was thinking how ... the memories seemed to be destroyed all of a sudden,” Linda Chen told Reuters of a wall with height chart markings for her now-teenage son. Chen's son, Chen Le-chi, told Reuters of their home, “It feels like it’s about to fall after the next quake, and the walls are all cracked. Too outrageous, too serious.” Daniel Aldrich, the director of the Resilience Studies Program at Northeastern University in Massachusetts, told NBC News that Taiwan has enhanced its emergency response systems since a 1999 earthquake that killed approximately 2,400 people. Aldrich points to building code enforcement and education as areas in which Taiwan's government has been well prepared. “Individual residents know what to do. Where’s the evacuation shelter?\" Aldrich told NBC News. \"What do I do? Where do I go?”",

The facility can also analyze soils, plants, water, fertilizer, and gas samples.\nProviding sufficient and accurate soil information to farmers, the soils laboratory will enable them to choose the crops suitable for their farmlands and the type and rate of fertilizer that should be used for their crops for optimum plant growth and development.\nThe Provincial Soils Laboratory is expected to be completed next year with soil chemists, soil microbiologists, and agronomists working as the facility’s lead personnel. — Anna Felicia Bajo\\/RSJ, GMA Integrated News",

This decision comes in light of disrupting New Zealand’s training ahead of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games. Assistant coach Andy Spence will lead the team in her absence. [Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| Updated: 26-07-2024 06:26 IST | Created: 26-07-2024 06:26 IST The Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) has suspended Women's National Team Head Coach Bev Priestman amid a drone spying scandal that has cast the 2020 gold medalists in an unfavorable light. Assistant coach Andy Spence will take over for the rest of the Paris games, the COC announced on Thursday. In a statement, Canada Soccer CEO & General Secretary Kevin Blue disclosed that further information about previous drone use against opponents had surfaced, leading to Priestman's suspension for the remainder of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games and until an independent external review is completed. The scandal erupted after a drone operated by a Canada Soccer staff member disrupted New Zealand's training session on Monday, days before their opening match against Canada. Priestman, who sat out the opening game voluntarily, apologized to the New Zealand team and took full responsibility for the incident. FIFA has initiated disciplinary proceedings against Canada Soccer, Priestman, and two staff members now expelled from the Paris Games. An independent external review will be conducted into the drone incident and the historic culture of competitive ethics within Canada Soccer's programs. Canada Soccer has not responded to requests for further comments. The Canadian team is set to face France on Sunday in Saint-Etienne. (With inputs from agencies.)",

    "text": "“Desleal” é o governador, rebate bancada petista após fala de Eduardo Leite Parlamentares cobram do tucano aplicação de quase R$ 800 milhões de recursos do Fundo de Recuperação publicidade [Após o governador Eduardo Leite (PSDB) voltar a criticar o governo federal, na manhã desta quinta-feira, durante evento do SOS Agro](https://www.correiodopovo.com.br/not%C3%ADcias/pol%C3%ADtica/com-discurso-regionalista-leite-intensifica-ainda-mais-as-cr%C3%ADticas-contra-o-governo-federal-1.1521089), em Porto Alegre, as bancadas do PT e do PCdoB na Assembleia Legislativa reagiram e chamaram o tucano de “desleal”. Em nota divulgada à tarde, os parlamentares disseram que as críticas “faltam com a verdade”, e, em seguida, elencam valores repassados pelo governo federal ao Estado após as enchentes. \"Eduardo Leite escolheu o pior caminho, o do conflito e não o da cooperação. No momento em que nosso estado precisa de um governador de verdade, Leite renuncia a sua responsabilidade e passa a ser um comentarista das ações do Governo Federal. Um governador ausente\", diz trecho da nota. Ao ampliarem as críticas, os deputados ainda questionam o uso dos quase R$ 800 milhões que estão no Fundo para a Recuperação do Estado (Funrigs) para utilização na recuperação do Estado e que não avançaram. Nota das bancadas do PT e PCdoB As críticas de Eduardo Leite ao Governo Federal e ao presidente Lula são desleais e faltam com a verdade. Os R$ 22 bilhões já aportados pelo Governo Lula são recursos extraordinários que vêm ajudando muito as pessoas e a nossa economia. São 350 mil famílias que receberam em tempo recorde, o auxílio emergencial de R$ 5.100,00. São quase R$ 2 bilhões em Auxílio Reconstrução. São R$ 9,5 bilhões em crédito e apoio para as empresas gaúchas e R$ 1,6 bilhão em apoio aos municípios. A suspensão do pagamento da dívida por três anos, mais de R$ 12 bilhões que ficam aqui no RS para investir em nossa reconstrução não é nada? É muito. As dívidas rurais dos produtores atingidos foram todas prorrogadas, as perdas serão compensadas com redução das dívidas e aquelas com perda total serão integralmente anistiadas. Tudo isto sendo feito em um ambiente de diálogo permanente. Eduardo Leite escolheu o pior caminho, o do conflito e não o da cooperação. No momento em que nosso estado precisa de um governador de verdade, Leite renuncia a sua responsabilidade e passa a ser um comentarista das ações do Governo Federal. Um governador ausente. É tão grave esta ausência que até mesmo o Fundo para a Recuperação do Estado (Funrigs) aprovado com urgência pela Assembleia Legislativa em 21 de maio, passados mais de dois meses, ainda não foi implementado. Quase R$ 800 milhões parados! Recursos que deveriam ser investidos na recuperação do estado, nas estradas vicinais, na compra de áreas para construção de casas populares nos municípios, em programas ambientais, na duplicação da RS-118, no apoio às empresas e agricultores. O Governo Lula fez muito pelo Rio Grande e continuará fazendo porque tem compromisso e respeito pelo povo gaúcho. As bancadas do PT e PCdoB continuarão trabalhando incansavelmente na reconstrução do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul e no bem-estar do nosso povo!",

    "text": "Deux hommes particulièrement surveillés, issus de la mouvance islamiste, ont été interpellés jeudi en marge du passage de la flamme olympique dans le sud-ouest de la France, a annoncé vendredi le gouvernement. \"En marge du passage de la flamme olympique en Gironde, (le ministre de l'Intérieur) Gérald Darmanin annonce l'interpellation de deux individus particulièrement surveillés\", a indiqué le ministère dans un communiqué. \"Ces hommes sont issus de la mouvance islamiste, ayant violé la mesure individuelle de contrôle administratif et de surveillance dont ils font l'objet\", ajoute-t-il. \"Le premier homme, âgé de 33 ans, a été condamné en janvier dernier pour apologie publique du terrorisme. Le second, âgé de 23 ans, était connu des services de renseignement pour des propos pro-djihadistes répétés sur la voie publique. Il avait par ailleurs été condamné à une peine d'emprisonnement ferme en octobre 2022\", précise le ministère. Début mai, [Gérald Darmanin](https://www.rtbf.be/article/france-l-assemblee-rejette-la-loi-immigration-darmanin-presente-sa-demission-refusee-par-macron-11299528) avait dévoilé aux préfets \"un plan d'actions\" de lutte antiterroriste reposant sur une \"stratégie d'entrave optimisée\" à l'encontre de la \"mouvance islamiste et jihadiste\" en amont et pendant les Jeux olympiques. Le ministre proposait notamment le déploiement systématique de mesures administratives comme des visites domiciliaires et des mesures individuelles de contrôle administratif et de surveillance (Micas) pour les personnes \"condamnées pour faits de terrorisme ou fortement radicalisées, dès leur libération\". Selon le ministère, 77 \"Micas\" sont en cours, un chiffre qui a fortement augmenté depuis le début du relais de la flamme. Le ministère assure par ailleurs que les mesures d'entraves \"continueront d'être renforcées à l'approche des Jeux\".",
