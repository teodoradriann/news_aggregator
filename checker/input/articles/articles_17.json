    "text": "Read full article The Independent Police warned ‘there will be more knives’ as teachers fear plan to take officers from London schools Andy Gregory April 10, 2025 at 12:46 a.m. · 4 min read\nLink Copied\nPolice in London received 173 reports of incidents of weapon possession, which can also include broken glass, in schools in 2023 (The Independent/Getty) Teachers and pupils have expressed their fears over plans by the Metropolitan Police to remove more than 300 specialist officers from long-held posts in London schools .\nHeadteachers have warned that pupils will be put at greater risk of violence and exploitation by gangs if the force presses ahead with its decision to withdraw 371 safer schools officers (SSOs) from their posts, starting from next month.\nOne pupil expressed fears that “there will be more knives ” and “drugs coming into school with nobody to actually stop it” if the plans to transfer SSOs into neighbourhood policing teams goes ahead.\nScotland Yard has written to headteachers saying the decision was “not made lightly”, after warning it had been forced into “tough choices” amid a £260m budget shortfall , which is expected to result in 1,700 layoffs.\nOne pupil said more knives would find their way into schools if the officers were removed (PA Archive) The force argued that, in their new posts, the transferred officers “will retain strong relationships with schools to ensure that any reports of knife crime can be dealt with quickly”.\nADVERTISEMENT Arguing that the “primary risk” to young people “exists outside the school grounds, for example, in the travel corridor between school and home,” the force added: “That is why we are changing our approach to ensure our efforts are focused on the wider community.”\nBut in a joint letter, seen by The Independent , 15 headteachers from schools in northeast London have warned the Met that, “without the support of safer school officers, vulnerable students may become prey to exploitation and, in turn, perpetrators of crime”.\nThe headteachers warned that such officers “play a critical role in ensuring the safety and well-being of students”, adding: “They are highly effective at addressing potential problems before they spiral out of control.”\nKnife crime rose 18 per cent in London to hit a record high of 16,521 offences during the year to September 2024, according to the Office for National Statistics.\nFigures obtained by The Independent last year showed that police received 37 reports of attacks involving blades or sharp instruments during term time in London schools in 2023, and 173 regarding incidents of weapon possession, which can also include broken glass.\nADVERTISEMENT SSOs were first introduced to schools in 2009 and – by 2023 – there were close to 1,000 operating across the UK , data obtained by the Runnymede Trust showed – with the charity warning at the time of a “deeply concerning” and “normalised” police presence.\nPointing to the Child Q scandal, in which a Black schoolgirl was strip-searched by police while on her period and without another adult present, after being wrongly suspected of carrying cannabis, the charity criticised “the highly racialised and damaging impact excessive force can have inside a school setting”, and called for the removal of SSOs.\nBut with such a move now set to happen en masse in London, Chris Hall, headteacher of Footsteps Trust in Haringey, told Sky News that SSOs had been “very, very, valuable assets” who had helped familiarise “young people with the police in the most positive way”.\nCharities have previously criticised the “damaging impact excessive force can have inside a school setting” (Ben Birchall/PA) One 14-year-old pupil at the Footsteps Trust told the broadcaster that “if anything happens outside of school you can tell them [SSOs] and let them know”, warning: “There will be more knives. There will be fighting, there will be drugs coming into school and no one will be there to actually stop it.”\nADVERTISEMENT A Metropolitan Police spokesperson told the Evening Standard : “Children should be able to travel to and from school and study without the fear of violence.\n“This is where we know young people are most at risk of violence and gangs, and it is where our officers will continue to be, ensuring that they are able to quickly respond to any incidents or concerns in the community.\n“Although officers will no longer be based in schools, they will join local policing teams where they will retain strong relationships with schools to ensure that any reports of knife crime can be dealt with quickly.\n“Officers will also work with local organisations and other youth based establishments to safeguard young people, prevent victimisation and reduce crime and anti-social behaviour beyond schools.”",

    "text": "St. John’s University welcomed more than 1,700 high school seniors, graduate candidates, and their families as they converged on the Queens, NY, campus on Saturday, April 15, for Accepted Student Day. The institution annually hosts the signature event to enable potential Johnnies to explore academic programs, innovative technology, state-of-the-art learning facilities, athletics, service opportunities, and many other offerings. “Accepted Student Day is one of the best days of the year as it allows admitted students to fully visualize our beautiful campus, to talk to our professors, and to learn about all the exciting opportunities that St. John’s has to offer,” said Simon G. Møller, Ph.D., Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs, University Distinguished Professor, and Provost Endowed Chair. Numerous students cued up inside Carnesecca Arena to formalize their commitment to the University by registering for the Fall 2023 semester, before heading over to join a boisterous pep rally underway at Taffner Field House to celebrate their acceptance to St. John’s. The buoyant crowd was greeted by Rev. Brian J. Shanley, O.P., University President, as he took to the stage to deliver his welcoming remarks. In addressing the gathering, Fr. Shanley offered students some advice. “One thing I would ask you to do today as you explore St. John’s is to pay attention to your gut,” he said. “Decisions are often made on intuition and on feelings. At the end of this day, when you’re trying to decide about whether to attend St. John’s, the key thing to ask yourself is, ‘How did I feel walking around today? Did this feel like home? Do these people feel like family? Does this feel like where God wants me to be?’” “There is a part of me, as President, that wants you all to come to St. John’s,” Fr. Shanley added. “But what I care about the most, and my hope and my prayer for you today, is that God gives you the grace to make a good decision about the next four years of your life.” Before Fr. Shanley’s remarks, the pep rally kicked off with performances by the St. John’s Pep Band, Dance Team, Kickline Team, and Cheerleading Team. University mascot Johnny Thunderbird was a notable presence at the event, mingling with students and posing for selfies with them and other guests. Alpha Psi Omega, a dramatic honor fraternity, also participated in the pep rally. DJ Zeke, also known as Ezekiel O. Akinyemi ’08TCB, presided over the pep rally, employing his well-known disc jockeying skills to encourage participants to dance and clap along to his musical selections. The crowd’s enthusiasm prompted Mr. Akinyemi, owner of DJ Zeke Entertainment, to enthuse, “I love this energy,” as he turned up the music. A new feature introduced at this year’s Student Accepted Day was the inclusion of students who will enroll in the University’s graduate programs. Event organizers said they wanted these students, like their undergraduate counterparts, to experience the unique sense of camaraderie that permeates the annual event. The Battle of the Orgs was also hosted for the first time for visiting families to enjoy and cast their votes for student performances by members of St. John’s numerous arts organizations. The four winning teams of the contest were Alpha Psi Omega, L.I.V.E. Dance Crew, Sensacion Dance Team, and Step Ya Game Up. These groups will be competing at the upcoming Campus Life event, Stormin’ Loud, a highly anticipated, end-of-year festival scheduled to be held on Friday, April 28. Throughout the remainder of the day, prospective students met with deans, faculty, and future peers to learn more about academic opportunities and the advantages of attending St. John’s. Justin Cracchiolo, a senior at Xaverian in his hometown of Brooklyn, NY, seemed to have channeled Fr. Shanley’s advice to rely on his gut instincts. “This event really helps me become more comfortable with going to school here,” said Justin, just after he registered for the start of classes this fall as a Computer Science major. “They do a very good job of making you comfortable and helping you feel that this is the right place to be.” Accepted student Adrianna Caporale, a senior at Holy Cross High School in Flushing, NY, visits the Queens campus often because it is very close to her home in Whitestone, NY. “I have been here a few times and I keep getting drawn back to this campus because it’s very welcoming,” she said. “The people don’t make you feel lost or out of place.” “Today, the campus was alive as we welcomed the next generation of talented Johnnies. I hope students were able to enjoy the celebration, have their questions answered, and, ultimately, envision themselves calling this place home,” said Corinne Gentile, Director of Enrollment Management Events. “Each year this event reminds me of the many reasons I am proud to call myself a Johnnie, and today was no exception!”",

    "text": "By Maria Loreto - New York April 18, 2024 6:06 PM EDT Suri Cruise is celebrating her 18th birthday. The daughter of Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise was spotted enjoying herself on a rainy day in New York City, walking around with a friend and a couple of gift bags.\nRELATED: Tom Cruise still sends Kristen Dunst his famous Christmas coconut cake\nSuri Cruise enjoys her final days before becoming a legal adult\n©GrosbyGroup\nSuri Cruise and a friend on her birthday Photos captured by paparazzi showed Suri wearing an all denim look while she walked around the city with a friend. She wore a jean jacket, a brown button up sweater, and some jeans. She wore black shoes and styled her hair in an elaborate braid, which had some pink flowers braided in the strands of her hair. She wore some make up and was holding on to a bright pink umbrella, shielding herself and her friend from the rain.\nSuri and her friend were holding on to some presents, so they were presumably leaving or going to a celebration for her birthday.\n©GrosbyGroup\nA closer look at Suri’s hairstyle Suri’s future plans Over the past year, sources have reported that Suri is getting ready for college. A source explained to The Daily Mail that she was interested in pursuing a career in fashion , and that she was applying to a variety of schools located all over the country. “Suri is applying to schools all over the place,” but she is leaning towards a school in NYC, said the source. “[Katie] really does want her to stay in New York so they can be close to each other. Katie takes great pride in her but is also extremely overprotective.“\nWhile she has an interest in fashion, she also appears to have an interest in acting. Last year, it was reported that Suri starred in a high school production of “The Addams Family: A New Musical,” where she played the role of Morticia Addams. No matter what she chooses, the strong bond with her mother is obvious, with Suri taking an interest in two of the topics that her mother is an expert in.\n ",

    "title": "Advertising group suspends brand safety unit after Elon Musk's antitrust lawsuit",
    "text": "The World Federation of Advertisers said Thursday that it’s suspending the operations of its Global Alliance for Responsible Media nonprofit initiative. GARM was started in 2019 in part to help advertisers avoid having their promotions show up alongside content they deem harmful. Earlier this week, Elon Musk’s X filed a federal lawsuit, alleging WFA and member companies engaged in anticompetitive behavior and organized an advertising boycott. A global advertising association said it is suspending the operations of a unit focused on brand safety two days after Elon Musk’s social media company, X, sued the group, alleging it organized an illegal ad boycott.\nThe World Federation of Advertisers, or WFA, confirmed Thursday that it would halt its nonprofit initiative Global Alliance for Responsible Media. GARM was started in 2019 in part to help advertisers avoid having their promotions show up alongside content they deem harmful.\nBusiness Insider first reported that GARM was being shuttered.\nX, formerly Twitter, filed a federal lawsuit Tuesday against WFA and member companies, including Unilever, Mars and CVS Health. The suit alleged that the WFA engaged in anticompetitive behavior and organized an advertising boycott that ultimately damaged X’s financial health.\nIn the lawsuit, filed in the Northern District of Texas, X’s attorneys referenced previous allegations made by the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee against GARM that claimed the group’s activities “rob consumers of choices” and are “likely illegal under the antitrust laws.”\nRussell Dye, a spokesperson for the House Judiciary panel, called the disbanding of GARM “a big win for the first amendment and a big win for Chairman Jordan’s oversight work.”\nFollowing Musk’s $44 billion acquisition of Twitter in 2022, a number of advertisers paused their campaigns due to what civil rights and other groups found to be an increase in hate speech and problematic content on the platform.\nMusk told advertisers during a public interview in November to “Go f— yourself” if they were attempting to “blackmail” him by pausing their X ad spending.\n“The whole world will know that those advertisers killed the company and we will document it in great detail,” Musk said at the time.\nX has since sued various watchdog organizations such as Media Matters and the Center for Countering Digital Hate, or CCDH, which published reports about the rise of hate speech and homophobic, conspiratorial and other inflammatory content on the site.\nIn March, a California judge dismissed X’s lawsuit against the CCDH, writing, “This case is about punishing the Defendants for their speech.”\nRuben Schreurs, chief strategy officer at media marketing group Ebiquity, called X’s lawsuit against WFA an example of “weaponized litigation” that “simply serves as a vehicle to stifle those voices and to cripple the organizations” that are trying to make the web safer, particularly for children.\nBrands are finding themselves wrapped up in a political battle, Schreurs said. The House Committee said in March that it obtained evidence that GARM members illegally colluded to “demonetize conservative platforms and voices.”\nSchreurs said X’s lawsuit against the WFA will likely be dismissed. Still, he’s concerned about the aggressive moves against advertisers and said the legal actions “are more political in nature than fact based.”\nX didn’t respond to a request for comment.\nWATCH : SpaceX plans to move headquarters from California to Texas",

    "text": "Life on Earth has an insatiable wanderlust spirit. From creeper plants sluggishly exploring new lands with their vines to humans diligently curating their dream getaways on Pinterest boards, even animals traverse great distances for suitable climates, better pastures, or ideal breeding grounds. Witnessing mass migrations, with herds and flocks moving in sync towards a destination, is breathtaking. These migrations happen during particular seasons or mating periods, or to seek better living conditions. You must add these animal migrations to your travel checklist, for it’s a guaranteed sensory experience.ALSO READ: Top 5 cultural festivals around the world you need to visit for a wholesome travel experience The Great African migrationOne of the biggest animal migrations, the extraordinary magnitude of this event is astonishing. It’s a heart-thumping experience to feel the thunderous hooves of over 1 million wildebeests, 400,000 zebras, and 300,000 gazelles galloping across the vast stretch of the savanna. The enormous herds are widely photographed. The migration timing depends on the rain and occurs mostly year-round but peaks in July. Depending on the season, the migration takes place between Tanzania's Serengeti National Park and Kenya's Masai Mara National Reserve. Monarch butterfly migrationMillions of Monarch butterflies take to the sky and embark on a 3,000-mile journey from the frigid northeastern regions of the United States and Canada towards the warmer areas of Mexico’s Central Highlands to breed. The delicate creatures start their southern migration in September and October to escape the harsh winter. The swarm of butterflies can be seen in various wildlife sanctuaries and groves in California. The Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve in Mexico also offers a firsthand experience of this breathtaking phenomenon.ALSO READ: Top natural phenomena that are a must for your travel bucket list Sea turtle hatchlingsGet ready to swoon over little turtles and cheer them on as the hatchlings race towards the sea. With nests on the land, female turtles lay their eggs near the beaches. It’s an impossibly adorable sight to watch the miracle of life as the eggs crack, and the newly hatched turtles waddle towards the safety of the waves. Florida beaches are the best places to spot these cute turtles. Red crab migrationAustralia’s Christmas Island beach turns red as thousands of red crabs march to the sea to lay their eggs. This annual breeding event takes place during the wet season, generally between November and December. These crabs look like a red tide against the blue of the sea, a stunning view. It makes one ponder in awe about nature’s workings.Humpback whale migrationWhales are gigantic and regal creatures, and it’s even more thrilling to watch an entire herd of whales moving together. Following food sources, they undertake long journeys spanning thousands of miles. It’s truly a captivating display of nature’s power.

The Wife of Lagos State Governor, Dr Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu and the Chairman of the Epe Local Government Area, Princess Surah Animashaun will today (Friday) flag off a two-day tuberculosis screening campaign in the council. According to Animashaun, the campaign is necessary because a lack of awareness has continued to pose threats to the residents of the council, the state, and Nigeria at large. The council chair stated this during a press conference organised to usher in the campaign exercise, held at the Secretariat Chamber, Ita-Marun, Epe, Lagos State, on Thursday. She said the event with the theme “End TB, Stop TB,” featuring free blood pressure checks, blood sugar screening, free X-rays, and free TB screening exercises, will be held at the Epe LG Primary Healthcare Centre, Epe. She asked residents to converge and afford themselves the opportunity of the screening to eliminate and control the spread of tuberculosis in the council, state, and country at large.

She said “Those diseases are preventable and treatable, yet they continue to pose a threat due to a lack of awareness and access to medical services. “So this screening and awareness campaign will not only provide our people with the knowledge they need to protect themselves and their loved ones but also ensure that those affected receive the care and support they deserve.” The chairman lamented the rising scourge of tuberculosis and high blood pressure among many Nigerians and underscored the importance of the free screening programme.

Such investors are encouraged to join this case by visiting the firm's site: bgandg.com/MRNS .\nCase Details:\nAccording to the Complaint, Marinus describes itself as a \"commercial-stage pharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of innovative therapeutics for the treatment of seizure disorders, including rare genetic epilepsies and status epilepticus, which includes the use of ZTALMY® (ganaxolone).\"\nThe Complaint alleges that Marinus made materially false and/or misleading statements regarding its Randomized Therapy in Status Epilepticus (RAISE) trial, which the Company described as a \"pivotal Phase 3 trial in refractory status epilepticus (RSE) patients.\" Specifically, the Company made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that:\n(1) Marinus understated the risk of failure to meet the early-stopping criteria in the RAISE trial;\n(2) Marinus did not disclose that a possible consequence of failing to meet the early stopping criteria in the RAISE trial would be that Marinus would stop the separate Phase 3 RAISE II trial; and\n(3) as a result, Marinus' statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all times.\nOn April 15, 2024 , according to the Complaint, before the market opened, Marinus issued a press release entitled \"Marinus Pharmaceuticals Provides Update on the Phase 3 RAISE Trial and Reports Preliminary First Quarter 2024 Financial results.\" (the \" April 15 Announcement\"). The April 15 Announcement revealed that the RAISE trial had not met early stopping criteria and also that the Company would implement cost-saving measures.\nOn this news, the price of Marinus stock fell $6.22 per share, or 82.7%, to close at $1.30 per share on April 15, 2024 . The next day, the price of Marinus stock fell a further7.69% to close at $1.20 on April 16, 2024 .\nThen, on May 8, 2024 , according to the Complaint, before the market opened, the Company filed with the SEC a current report on Form 8-K. In a press release attached to this Form 8-K, the Company announced cost cutting measures including:\n(1) stopping clinical trial enrollment in the RAISE and RAISE II trials;\n(2) stopping the Phase 3 Raise II trial in RSE;\n(3) reducing the Company's workforce by approximately 20%; and\n(4) increasing overall efficiency of the Company's operations through other operational changes.\nDuring market hours on May 8, 2024 , Fierce Biotech published an article entitled \"Marinus lays of 20% of staff to steady ship after IV seizure med's phase 3 struggles,\" which illustrated the impact on the Company of the failure to meet the early stopping criteria in the RAISE trial.\nOn this news, the price of Marinus stock fell $0.14 per share, or 8.91%, to close at $1.43 on May 8, 2024 .\nTherefore, the Complaint alleges that as a result of Marinus' wrongful acts and omissions, and the precipitous decline in the market value of the Company's common shares, investors have suffered significant losses and damages.\nWhat's Next?\nA class action lawsuit has already been filed.
