    "text": "Young children have a surprising capacity to learn math from their surroundings. It doesn’t take much, and they hear and use math language all the time without realizing it. When they ask for snacks, they use size comparisons, “big” and “little,” or when they count the number of kitchen utensils needed for a family meal, they are developing foundational math concepts that anchor their thinking for future learning. These casual and playful routine math opportunities are everywhere and free; all we have to do is to recognize and share them with children. When children are babies and toddlers, parents and early childhood educators think about the best ways to provide them with a head start in life and in school. Often, the emphasis to date has been on reading, with less consideration given to math. Yet early math is an integral part of the complex web of learning that includes language, movement and social interactions that support children’s natural instincts to collect and organize information.",

    "text": "Nelle ultime settimane la temperatura non è mai scesa sotto lo zero e di giorno si toccano i 15 gradi. Le condizioni meteo impediscono anche di sparare la neve artificiale Vacanze senza neve per molti sciatori che sono andati in montagna per le feste di [Natale](https://tg24.sky.it/argomenti/natale). In Appennino la situazione è particolarmente critica. La temperatura nelle ultime settimane non è quasi mai scesa sotto lo zero neppure a 1500 metri di quota. E di giorno si toccano punte di 14-15 gradi. Risultato: impossibile sparare la neve artificiale. Il video dal drone In un video ripreso da un drone si vede la situazione al Cimone, quasi privo di neve. Gli impiantisti sono riusciti faticosamente ad aprire un paio di piste, ma il grosso della stazione è chiuso. Temperature troppo elevate. La situazione appare ancora più critica rispetto all'anno passato La neve artificiale Tutte le piste sono aperte grazie all’innevamento artificiale e non mancano turisti e scuole di sci, ma si scia circondati da un panorama straniante per la stagione invernale, che ricorda invece più quello primaverile. Viste dall’alto, le piste sono delle lunghe strisce bianche che attraversano la vegetazione color marrone.",
