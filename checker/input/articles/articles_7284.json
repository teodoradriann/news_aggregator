    "text": "(Gray News) - A postal worker reportedly went hundreds of miles off his route to make a special delivery.\nPeople reports Grand Prairie United States Postal Service carrier Alvin Gauthier helped a family reunite with World War II-era letters sent from their loved one who was serving in the Army.\nGauthier shared he knew the importance of the letters when he came across them in his work bag.\n“I was getting ready for my route and found some letters that were dated back to 1942,” KXAS quoted Gauthier. “My main thought was I have to find this family.”\nHowever, the letters offered few details other than being addressed to Mr. and Mrs. Henry Lamb who lived in Jacksonville, Arkansas.\nKARK reported that Gauthier contacted its news team for assistance, and they were able to find Jo Ann Smith whose brother was Marion Lamb, the soldier who wrote the letters addressed to their parents.\nGauthier shared he decided to take a road trip from Texas to Arkansas on his day off to deliver the letters.\n“Sometimes you have to go above and beyond,” KXAS quoted Gauthier.\nGauthier, a Marine Corps veteran himself, arrived at Smith’s door with the letters after about a reported 5.5-hour drive.\nSmith thanked Gauthier for going above and beyond in delivering the letters. She said they are a reminder of the sacrifices her brother made.\nCopyright 2024 Gray Media Group, Inc. All rights reserved.",

    "title": "Los polémicos tuits de la nueva directora del Instituto de las mujeres: \"#StopDelirioTrans\"",
    "text": "Isabel García, nueva directora del Instituto de la Mujer\nColectivos que representan y defienden a personas trans han denunciado este jueves el nombramiento de Isabel García como directora del Instituto de las Mujeres ya que aseguran que “ha mantenido discursos abiertamente transfóbicos y antiderechos trans” durante la tramitación de esta ley.\nEn un comunicado, la Federación Plataforma Trans y Euforia Familias Trans-Aliadas han criticado el nombramiento de Isabel García como directora del Instituto de las Mujeres que ayer hizo el Consejo de Ministros, a propuesta del Ministerio de Igualdad.\nAseguran que García ha mantenido discursos “abiertamente transfóbicos y antiderechos trans durante la tramitación de la Ley Trans” y han pedido a la Ministra de Igualdad, Ana Redondo, que reboque tal designación y en su lugar ponga al frente a una mujer que defienda a todas las mujeres, también las trans.\n“Pedimos coherencia a un Gobierno que se dice progresista y que no puede poner al frente de ninguna institución a personas que se han destacado por sus declaraciones transfóbicas y anti derechos trans”, ha subrayado la presidenta de la Plataforma Trans, Mar Cambrollé.\nPor su parte, la presidenta de Euforia Familias Trans-Aliadas, Natalia Aventín, ha indicado que “es decepcionante que se nombre como representante del Instituto de las Mujeres a quien ha sido extremadamente agresiva con las madres que representamos a las familias de personas trans”.\nSumar, socio de Gobierno, también se ha unido en las últimas horas a las voces discrepantes. “Dicha institución no puede estar en manos de quien menosprecia e insulta a las mujeres y a las personas LGTBI”, aseguraba el partido de Yolanda Díaz en un tuit.\nIsabel García, que también fue asesora del Ministerio de Transportes y Movilidad Sostenible entre 2019 y 2022, es contraria a la autodeterminación de género y a la ley trans que sacó adelante Irene Montero en la pasada legislatura. De hecho, para García, “las mujeres trans no existen”. Así se lo dejó claro a su compañero de partido Víctor Gutiérrez, Secretario de Políticas LGTBI del PSOE, en un tuit en el que él afirmaba lo contrario.\nSobre la ley trans, García incluso se atrevió a publicar hashtags como #StopDelirioTrans o a asegurar que la norma “no es buena ley” y que había logrado “en tiempo récord dividir el movimiento feminista y al colectivo LGTBI”. También dijo que la teoría queer “avanza sin descanso con el único objetivo de perpetuar el heteropatriarcado y borrar a las mujeres de lo político”.\nMuchos usuarios también han denunciado que García no consideró en un primer momento delito de odio por homofobia el asesinato del joven gallego Samuel Luiz al grito de “maricón de mierda”. “No parecer ser un asesinato por motivos homófobos”, escribió en Twitter. Una publicación que, días después, acabó borrando.\nGarcía también ha arremetido duramente contra Irene Montero a lo largo de la última legislatura. El día del traspaso de la cartera con Ana Redondo, la despidió de esta manera en redes sociales: “Hay que saber irse con dignidad. Los Ministerios no se heredan . Hoy has demostrado porque no estás a la altura de la responsabilidad que se te encomendó”.\nAhora, es Irene Montero la que ha criticado su nombramiento como directora del Instituto de la Mujer. “Defender los derechos trans y LGTBI es una obligación democrática. Más para un Gobierno que tiene la obligación de cumplir y hacer cumplir los DDHH. No olvidéis que somos más. Que viva la furia trans. Que viva el orgullo LGTBI. Que viva la lucha de las mujeres”, ha señalado la exministra de Igualdad.",

    "title": "Max Melton: Rutgers football star from NJ ready for NFL Combine 2024",
    "text": "With patience and no panic, Rutgers football star Max Melton is proving he belongs in NFL [Art Stapleton](https://www.northjersey.com/staff/2648356001/art-stapleton/) INDIANAPOLIS - [Isiah Pacheco](/story/sports/college/rutgers/2024/02/11/isiah-pacheco-nfl-draft-round-pick-kansas-city-chiefs-2022-rutgers-scarlet-knights-rb/72423431007/) is already one of the angriest runners the NFL has ever seen. Max Melton, his former Rutgers teammate, is not one to run from physicality, either. In talking about the pride he takes in that part of his game as a cornerback, Melton beams about bringing an ill mindset on defense that requires being unafraid to be a fierce, tone-setting presence on \"the Dark Side.\" The diamond-studded \"Mad Max\" necklace hanging on Melton's chest embodies his way of life on the field. But Melton could not help but laugh recalling that one time in practice during his freshman season in Piscataway when he sized up Pacheco after the star running back and current two-time Super Bowl champion for the Kansas City Chiefs caught a swing pass and turned up field ready to bury the opposition. That's when Melton did something he rarely does - he backed down. Of course, there's more to the story. \"It was a spring scrimmage and he caught a pass in the flat, but he didn't see me coming, though,\" Melton said during his interview session at the Scouting Combine on Thursday morning. \"This was the only time I ever got to try to hit 'Pop' for real, but I let up and let him go. It's practice, it's your own player, you don't want to blow him up.\" Then Melton smiled before offering a playful warning that goes for Pacheco and the rest of the NFL, too: \"But I'll definitely look forward to facing him up in the league for sure.\" Melton is on the precipice of becoming the next Rutgers defensive back to make a name for himself in the pros. His face lights up at the mention of the McCourty twins, Devin and Jason, Logan Ryan and Duron Harmon - all of whom have won Super Bowl rings - plus Christian Braswell and Christian Izien, who stood out as rookies with the Jaguars and Bucs this past season. Rutgers: [In era of constant player movement, Greg Schiano and Rutgers football defying the odds](/story/sports/college/rutgers/2023/12/15/rutgers-football-roster-intact-nfl-nil-transfer-portal/71924007007/) \"I feel like people have got to open their eyes more. Rutgers DBs in the league, I feel like we’re making our mark,\" said Melton, who offered effusive praise for Rutgers coach Greg Schiano. \"We’re very smart, very disciplined, very athletic and we all get the job done. I meet with teams and they’re like, ‘Oh, you’re a Rutgers guy, you know football,’ and I’m like, sure enough, I do know football. The physical attributes mixed in with the mental preparation, mix that all together and you’re gonna have a good player.\" At 6-foot and 193 pounds, Melton has shown tremendous versatility on the back end. He can man up on the boundary and his game is complete enough to slide into the slot and challenge for a starting role as the nickel as a rookie. Melton put on a show in the Senior Bowl practices in Mobile, and the Giants and Jets are among the teams who have met with the 21-year-old from South Jersey. He told NorthJersey.com that he plans on attending the Giants' local Pro Day in April, and that, in addition to Big Blue and the Jets, he has had visits with the Steelers, Buccaneers, Cowboys, 49ers and Bears, among others. \"Throw on the Ohio State tape and watch him compete his butt off. It didn’t feel like that moment was too big for him with the way he played,\" NFL draft analyst Dane Brugler of The Athletic said of Melton, who he believes has a chance to work his way into the Top 100 picks. \"And obviously, he’s got family connections with his brother Bo [wide receiver for the Green Bay Packers], he knows what to expect. When you’re talking about a corner position, you want athletes and you want competitors. He checks both those boxes. ... Corner’s a sink or swim position when you put him out there, but if I know he’s an athlete and he’s gonna compete his butt off, I feel good about him swimming more than sinking.\" At the Senior Bowl, Melton was timed as [the fastest player in 1-on-1 drills](https://twitter.com/NFL_DF/status/1752381832937763085), peaking at 20.9 miles per hour. The patience with which he defends the entire route tree is impressive, and situationally, there appears to be no panic in his game. He is sticky in coverage both in the slot and on the boundary. An interesting part of his resume is Melton's excellence on special teams. He is an outstanding gunner and a disruptor on the punt team with four career blocks in his tenure with the Scarlet Knights. Asked which players he models his game after, Melton mentioned two former Ohio State Buckeyes once coached by Schiano: Saints corner Marshon Lattimore and Browns corner Denzel Ward. \"You've got to be able to cover, and you've got to be able to hit,\" Melton said. \"On defense, there's no fear. We like to say we play on the Dark Side and that's what it takes.\" Like those Rutgers defensive backs before him, Melton is ready for his turn to shine.",

Avon Lake Fire Chief Jeremy Betsa said the search was terminated for other individuals at about 11:15 a.m. There is no indication the man was accompanied in his boat. Betsa said investigators believe the man entered the lake from the Lorain boat launch. At noon on Wednesday, a Coast Guard helicopter searched for additional victims. The Miller Road Park boat launch was closed around 10:30 a.m., and starting around 11:30 a.m., boaters anchored at the inlet were allowed to start pulling out their boats. The man's name had yet to be released by the Lorain County Coroner's Office on Wednesday evening. Avon Lake fire was assisted by the Lorain County Dive Team, the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, and fire departments in Avon, Elyria, Sheffield Lake and North Ridgeville. Given the upcoming July 4 weekend, Betsa urged those taking boats out on the lake to wear safety equipment. \"Never go out alone, always have people with you and make sure people on shore know where you are,\" Betsa said.

    "text": "[Medio Oriente](https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/category/medio-oriente/) Con la guerra desatada en Gaza, la Navidad se cancela en Belén (CNN) -- Las campanas de las iglesias resuenan en las laberínticas calles de Belén. Con la Navidad a la vuelta de la esquina, la ciudad de la Ribera Occidental, ocupada por Israel, debería estar repleta de visitantes. Pero este año está casi desierta. Los dirigentes locales tomaron el mes pasado la decisión de reducir las festividades en solidaridad con la población de Palestina, mientras se libraban intensos combates entre Israel y Hamas en la devastada Gaza. Más de 20.000 palestinos han muerto durante la ofensiva aérea y terrestre de Israel, según el Ministerio de Sanidad de Gaza, controlado por Hamas, y casi el 85% de la población total de la franja ha sido desplazada. La guerra fue desencadenada por el ataque terrorista de Hamas del 7 de octubre contra el sur de Israel, en el que murieron al menos 1.200 personas y más de 240 fueron tomadas como rehenes. Muchos aquí tienen lazos con Gaza a través de seres queridos y amigos, y una sensación de miseria ha caído sobre la ciudad venerada por los cristianos como el lugar de nacimiento de Jesucristo. Este año se han retirado las decoraciones que antes adornaban los barrios. Se han cancelado los desfiles y las celebraciones religiosas. En el centro de la ciudad, el tradicional enorme árbol de Navidad de la plaza del Pesebre brilla por su ausencia. Viajar a Belén, a unos ocho kilómetros al sur de Jerusalén, no suele ser fácil. La barrera construida por Israel en la Ribera Occidental restringe la circulación, al igual que los diversos puestos de control que entran y salen de la ciudad. La situación no ha hecho más que empeorar desde el atentado de Hamas. Desde el 7 de octubre, Israel ha restringido la circulación en Belén y otras ciudades palestinas de la Ribera Occidental, con puestos de control militares que permiten entrar y salir, lo que afecta a los palestinos que intentan ir a trabajar. El territorio ocupado también ha experimentado un aumento de la violencia, con al menos 300 palestinos muertos en ataques israelíes, según el Ministerio de Sanidad palestino. \"Mi hijo me preguntó por qué no hay árbol de Navidad este año, no sé cómo explicárselo\", dice Ali Thabet a CNN. Él y su familia viven en Al Shawawra, un pueblo palestino cercano a Belén, y lo visitan cada Navidad \"porque nuestra relación con nuestros hermanos cristianos es una relación fuerte...\". Él y su familia viven en Belén y la visitan cada Navidad \"porque nuestra relación con nuestros hermanos cristianos es una relación fuerte\". Explica: \"Nos unimos a ellos en sus celebraciones, y ellos también se unen a nosotros en nuestras celebraciones\". Pero este año las fiestas son muy malas\". Caminando por las calles empedradas, el impacto del conflicto es evidente. Las empresas apostaban por un periodo festivo de gran actividad tras sufrir las penurias y restricciones de viaje de la pandemia de coronavirus. Pero sin las habituales multitudes de turistas y fieles, muchos de los hoteles, tiendas y restaurantes han cerrado. La economía de Belén depende de los peregrinos y el turismo, explica el propietario de una tienda de tercera generación, Rony Tabash, que espera fuera de su tienda a clientes que nunca llegarán. Recuerdos y figuras talladas en madera de olivo del belén se acumulan en las estanterías. La tienda de Tabash es una de las pocas que permanecen abiertas, por el deseo de apoyar a los hábiles artesanos que fabrican delicadamente su mercancía. Tabash lleva a su padre a la tienda todos los días para que salga de casa. Su abuelo abrió la tienda en 1927 y este lugar, junto con la plaza y su famosa iglesia, se han convertido en \"parte de nuestro corazón\". \"Nunca habíamos visto la Navidad así\", continúa. \"Desde hace tres meses, sinceramente, no tenemos ni una venta. No quiero que mi padre se quede en casa. No quiero perder la esperanza\". Incluso la iglesia de la Natividad, que en 2012 se convirtió en el primer sitio del Patrimonio Mundial en los territorios palestinos, está prácticamente vacía. En un año normal, las colas de cientos de personas serpentearían alrededor del aparcamiento exterior con peregrinos esperando pacientemente para entrar en su gruta, considerada desde el siglo II el lugar exacto del nacimiento de Cristo. Una estrella de plata de 14 puntas incrustada en el suelo de mármol marca el lugar exacto donde se dice que nació Jesús. En el siglo IV, el emperador Constantino fundó una iglesia en el lugar, que fue destruida en el año 529 y sustituida por estructuras más grandes, que forman la base de la iglesia actual. En el interior, normalmente sólo se puede entrar de pie. Pero este año, los combates en Gaza lo han cambiado todo. Ahora, prácticamente se puede oír caer un alfiler. \"Nunca la había visto así\", dice el padre Spiridon Sammour, sacerdote ortodoxo griego de la Iglesia de la Natividad. \"La Navidad es alegría, amor y paz. No tenemos paz. No tenemos alegría\", dice solemnemente. \"No está en nuestras manos, y rezamos por los líderes que tomarán las decisiones [en todo] el mundo para que Dios les ayude, les dé su luz para hacer la paz aquí y en todo el mundo\". -- Kareem El Damanhoury, Eyad Kourdi y Sugam Pokharel de CNN han contribuido a este reportaje.",
