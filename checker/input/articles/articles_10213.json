    "text": "A hard-hit Israeli kibbutz has announced the death of Judih Weinstein — an American-Canadian-Israeli woman who had been thought to be held hostage in Gaza. The news came six days after Ms Weinstein’s husband, Gad Haggai, was also declared dead. Ms Weinstein, 70, and Mr Haggai, 73, were taking an early morning walk near their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz on the morning of October 7 when Hamas militants burst across the border into Israel, killing about 1,200 people and kidnapping 240 others. In the early hours of the morning, Ms Weinstein was able to call emergency services and let them know that both she and her husband had been shot and send a message to her family. Ms Weinstein and her husband had been thought to be among the hostages still held in captivity in Gaza. But six days ago, the kibbutz announced that Mr Haggai was killed on October 7 and his body was taken to Gaza. On Thursday, the kibbutz said it had learned that Ms Weinstein was also killed on October 7 and her body is also being held in Gaza. It was not immediately clear how Israeli authorities determined their deaths. The couple are survived by two sons and two daughters and seven grandchildren, the kibbutz said. US President Joe Biden said he was “devastated” to learn of Ms Weinstein’s death, especially after hearing about the couple during a meeting with their daughter. The families “have been living through hell for weeks. No family should have to endure such an ordeal”, he said in a statement. Ms Weinstein was born in New York and was an active member of Kibbutz Nir Oz, a small community near the Gaza border where she taught English to children with special needs. The kibbutz said she also taught meditation techniques to children and teenagers who suffered from anxiety as a result of rocket fire from Gaza. Mr Haggai was a retired chef and jazz musician. “Judy dedicated her life to serving others, spending years teaching English and using her passions for poetry, puppeteering, and mindfulness to empower children of all backgrounds,” her family said in a statement. In a YouTube video made during a brief round of fighting between Israel and the Islamic Jihad militant group last May, Ms Weinstein read a series of poems and expressed hope for better days ahead. “I truly hope that the next time I’m recording some Haiku it won’t be under duress, under rocket fire, under conditions where people are at war,” she said. “May we all be granted the right to our basic rights of home, food, shelter and peaceful days. Here’s hoping.” Al Haggai, one of the couple’s sons, told Israel’s Channel 13 that the family had originally hoped their mother’s multiple citizenships would allow her to be released during the week-long ceasefire in late November, when 105 hostages were let go. Almost all were women and children. He said that when his mother’s name was not on any of the daily lists, he started to suspect that something had happened to her. According to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office, at least 23 of the approximately 129 hostages believed to be held in Gaza have either died or been killed in captivity. Nir Oz was one of the hardest-hit Israeli communities on October 7, with roughly a quarter of its residents killed or kidnapped. The families of missing hostages have drawn widespread support and sympathy in Israel as they press the government to reach a new ceasefire deal to bring home their loved ones. Mr Netanyahu met on Thursday in Tel Aviv with some of the families, where he told them there were behind-the-scene efforts to bring the hostages home, according to a statement from his office. “I can’t elaborate on the details, we are working to return everyone,” he said.

    "text": "NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\nNorth Korean ballistic missiles once again rained down over Ukraine this week as the war with Russia continues to rage, prompting President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to renew warnings that the threat posed by the Moscow-Pyongyang alliance is “extremely dangerous” for Europe and Asia alike.\n“The longer this war continues on our territory, the more warfare technologies evolve, and the greater the threat will be to everyone,” Zelenskyy said Tuesday. “This must be addressed now, not when thousands of upgraded Shahed drones and ballistic missiles begin to threaten Seoul and Tokyo.”\nZelenskyy’s warning came just one day after Ukraine’s military intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, confirmed in an interview with The War Zone that Russia has significantly improved North Korea’s KN-23 ballistic missiles.\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy lays flowers as he pays tribute to 12 people killed by the Russian ballistic missile in Kyiv, Ukraine, on April 25, 2025. (Ukrinform/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\nTop Ukrainian officials are sounding the alarm that there is a clear exchange of North Korean troops and supplies for Russian technical knowhow – including developments it has learned from Iranian drone manufacturing.\n“We are also tracking evidence that Russian-Iranian drone technologies have spread to North Korea,” Zelenskyy said Tuesday. “This is extremely dangerous both for Europe and for East and Southeast Asia.”\nSimilarly, Budanov said Pyongyang has agreed to produce Russian UVAs on North Korean territory utilizing developments in drone warfare that Moscow has obtained through Iran and its steady supply of Shahed drones.\n“It will for sure bring changes in the military balance in the region between North Korea and South Korea,” the intelligence chief warned on Monday.\nUpper floors of a nine-story residential building in the Dniprovskyi district are damaged by a Russian drone strike on March 23, 2025, in Kyiv, Ukraine.

And Russians are helping them with this.”",

Katie Hobbs to address this issue.](https://www.kjzz.org/2024-02-06/content-1870508-cost-long-term-care-could-squeeze-millions-middle-income-americans-poverty)\n\"So what we're doing is we're asking the governor to make this a priority, one of her priorities, this year,\" said Tory Roberg, director of government affairs for the Alzheimer's Association in Phoenix.\nThat's because many people living with dementia who meet the financial requirement of ALTCS are still being denied coverage, according to Roberg.\n\"Maybe because they didn't answer the phone when the assessor called. Maybe because when the assessor called, they asked the person questions and the person answered the questions in such a way that the assessor said, ‘oh, they don't need help,’\" Roberg said.\nALTCS moved to a phone assessment during the pandemic. But it can be difficult to gauge a person’s cognitive impairment issues on the phone.\nSo, Roberg wants ALTCS to do is to adjust their functional eligibility criteria to show these invisible symptoms.\n\"The person may look physically fine, but they are completely unable to take care of themselves and need supervision or prompting or monitoring,\" Roberg said.\nRoberg wants a return to in-person interviews, as well as an increase in the state budget for more ALTCS staff.",

    "title": "Amazon Fire Sticks Were Being Used To Run TV Streaming Services For ‘Cash In Hand’ Payments, Person Runn…",
    "text": "A 29-year-old U.K. resident living in Liverpool was running a service that involved uploading illegal services to Amazon Fire Sticks in return for earning a quick buck. Unfortunately, the authorities quickly triangulated on his position and put a stop to this activity while also hammering down a jail sentence that would last for more than three years. Illegal services through Amazon Fire Sticks were marketed using Facebook, which likely received the unwanted attention of the authorities. Jonathan Edge has been sentenced to three years and four months in prison, with Sky News reporting that a separate concurrent sentence of two years and three months has been imposed for accessing and viewing the content he was supplying. Using hard cash was one way to avoid being traced by the police, but the only problem was that Edge was marketing his illicit operation using Facebook, which likely notified the authorities of his activities. Edge received multiple warnings about illegally streaming content using Amazon Fire Sticks, but these were ignored. Later, during the sentencing, these warnings were referenced by the judge, who treated them as one of the reasons for the somewhat bigger sentence. The prosecution was undertaken by the Premier League, which was supported by other entities such as FACT, or Federation Against Copyright Theft, and Merseyside Police. Kevin Plumb, Premier League general counsel, says that the sentence handed down to Edge is the result of the severity of his actions, which involved providing viewers with unauthorized access to Premier League football. “The significant sentence handed down to the individual involved once again serves to highlight the severity of his actions. We will continue to pursue legal action against those supplying unauthorised access to Premier League football, regardless of the scale or mode of operation. Ignoring warnings to stop only served to make the consequences worse for the individual.” Detective Sergeant Steve Frame from Merseyside Police said that several people in the U.K. do not see any harm in illegally streaming TV services, but they are incorrect in this assumption and the recent outcome should serve as a stern warning to those who pursue such money-making avenues.",
