    "title": "Trump Vows To Defend Christianity Against 'Evil, Satanic Elite' - The People's Voice",
    "text": "Former President Trump has promised to use his second term in the White House to save and protect Christianity from the “Satanic globalists” who are seeking to make America a dark and evil place. “Remember, every communist regime throughout history has tried to stamp out the churches, just like every fascist regime has tried to co-opt them and control them. And, in America, the radical left is trying to do both,” Trump told attendees at the National Religious Broadcasters International Christian Media Convention in Nashville.

Trump is favored in a Republican primary where the once crowded field has dwindled to just him and his former ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley. The Christian media gathering, where sponsors distributed free red and white baseball caps emblazoned with “Make America Pray Again,” was exceedingly friendly territory for the former president, whose address often felt more like a rally than a staid convention speech. “The left is trying to shame Christians,” Trump said. “They’re trying to shame us. I’m a very proud Christian.” Trump brought the crowd to its feet repeatedly and frequently championed his record on [abortion](https://apnews.com/hub/abortion), including appointing three conservative Supreme Court justices who helped overturn the Roe v. Wade decision. But he notably didn’t mention the Alabama Supreme Court [ruling](https://apnews.com/article/alabama-frozen-embryos-ruling-ivf-pause-3ea72dd4494cad3f65c57e751e4c5c3b) that has prompted providers there to pause in vitro fertilization after justices ruled that frozen embryos could be considered children under state law. President Joe Biden‘s reelection campaign released a blank statement on the matter late Thursday, ironically calling attention to Trump’s lack of reaction on the “Alabama IVF ruling he is responsible for.” Instead, Trump used his speech to boast that he had used his first term to do “more to uphold religious freedom than any administration in history.” “The enthusiasm for this election coming up in November is far greater than it was in 2016 or 2020,” he said. “Far greater, it’s not even a contest.” Tennessee holds its primary on Super Tuesday, March 5, when many states around the country vote and could move Trump to the cusp of claiming the Republican nomination. Some religious leaders were initially hesitant to get behind multi-divorcee Trump when he first ran for president in 2016, but now they are among his mostly solidly loyal “Make America Great Again” base. That’s despite a personal history that has only gotten more checkered in recent years, including Trump being indicted in New York in connection with hush money payments made to a porn actress in an attempt to suppress an extramarital affair. “When he came onto the scene, people were skeptical,” said Troy Miller, president and CEO of the National Religious Broadcasters. “But I think, as they’ve learned more and listened to Donald Trump speak, the one thing I hear all the time from people … is that they really feel like Donald Trump understands them and that’s the biggest connection that people make is, ‘This is a guy in politics who gets us, who understands us, who doesn’t talk like he’s an elitist and talk down to us.’” [Sean Adl-Tabatabai](https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/author/cyrus/) Latest posts by Sean Adl-Tabatabai ( [see all](https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/author/cyrus/)) - [Trump Vows To Defend Christianity Against ‘Evil, Satanic Elite’](https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/trump-vows-to-defend-christianity-against-evil-satanic-elite/)- February 23, 2024 - [WHO Warns Everybody Will Have Cancer Within Next 20 Years](https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/who-warns-everybody-will-have-cancer-within-next-20-years/)- February 23, 2024 - [Illinois To Begin Jailing Parents Who Refuse To Transition Their Kids](https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/illinois-to-begin-jailing-parents-who-refuse-to-transition-their-kids/)- February 23, 2024",

    "text": "[Michael Foust](https://www.christianheadlines.com/author/michael-foust/)| ChristianHeadlines.com Contributor | Updated: Dec 29, 2023 Nearly six in 10 Americans who make New Year’s Resolutions say they want to pray more and focus on their faith more in 2024, according to a new poll that also found that about half the country is hopeful heading into the new year. The CBS News/YouGov [survey](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-poll-hopes-resolutions-2024/) found that 47 percent of Americans feel hopeful heading into 2024, while 22 percent feel discouraged, and 31 percent answer “both equally.” Just over one-third of Americans (37 percent) say they make New Year’s Resolutions. Among those, 59 percent say they want to “pray or attend religious services more” in 2024, an answer that tied for seventh place with “lose weight.” The top six answers were: improve health (94 percent), exercise (88 percent), “spending more time in person with people you care about” (84 percent), diet/eat better (81 percent), “learn a new skill, challenge or hobby” (73 percent) and quit a bad habit (70 percent). Other answers included “spend less time online” (51 percent) and “get more involved with volunteer efforts in the community” (50 percent). “Americans feel about twice as hopeful as discouraged when they think about 2024,” a CBS News analysis said. “But it's young people in particular who are the most hopeful, with two-thirds feeling this way.” Nearly two-thirds (64 percent) of Americans under 30 feel hopeful about 2024. It’s 51 percent among those ages 30-44, 37 percent among 45-64, and 39 percent among those 65 and older. New Year’s Resolutions, too, are more popular among young people, with 60 percent of those under 30 making them but only 15 percent among those ages 65 and over. “The young are by far the most likely to be making resolutions for 2024, as opposed to older Americans,” the analysis said, theorizing that “perhaps older Americans feel more complete, or set in their ways, or maybe age has brought the wisdom that a lot of us just don't keep them anyway.” The poll included interviews with 2,182 adults.

    "text": "Burrasca in porto a Trieste, raffiche a 80 km orari, tre navi rompono gli ormeggi: sgomberato molo Audace In difficoltà un traghetto e due portacontainer. Per una Msc necessario l’arrivo dei rimorchiatori. Onde sulle rive gremite di gente TRIESTE. Sono state ore di intensa attività per la Capitaneria di porto – Guardia Costiera di Trieste e per i servizi tecnico nautici (piloti, ormeggiatori e rimorchiatori) impegnati nella serata di giovedì e nella notte per ricondurre alla normalità le situazioni di pericolo che si sono verificate nel porto di Trieste dopo l’improvvisa burrasca che si è abbattuta sulla città ed in particolare sullo scalo giuliano. Le operazioni si sono concentrate in particolar modo sul porto nuovo, dove, nonostante le comunicazioni e le raccomandazioni fatte anticipatamente via radio alle navi e ai servizi tecnico nautici per l’imminente arrivo del fortunale, le forti raffiche di vento, rilevate con un picco massimo di circa 80 km/h, hanno determinato la rottura degli ormeggi di 3 unità navali, nello specifico Ulusoy-14, traghetto di bandiera turca, attraccato al molo VI (terminal TIMT), K-Stream, portacontainer di bandiera portoghese e Maersk Hidalgo, portacontainer di bandiera Singapore, entrambe al molo VII (terminal TMT). L'equipaggio della nave K-Stream ha risolto in autonomia, rinforzando gli ormeggi e rimanendo in banchina. La nave Ulusoy-14, accesi i motori, con pilota a bordo, è riuscita a dare fonda all'ancora. Situazione più critica per la nave Maersk Hidalgo, risolta con l'intervento di rimorchiatori, ormeggiatori e piloti grazie ai quali è stata ricondotta in sicurezza presso il proprio ormeggio. La motovedetta della Guardia Costiera CP881 è intervenuta per sgomberare il molo Audace, gremito di gente nonostante le onde alte ed il vento forte rendessero sconsigliabile la permanenza sul molo. E’ inoltre giunta segnalazione di un peschereccio che si presumeva essere disperso in mare, a seguito del quale si è attivata immediatamente la macchina della ricerca e soccorso, per fortuna poi rientrato in autonomia agli ormeggi, scortato dalla CP881. Il pronto intervento di personale e mezzi sia navali sia terrestri della Guardia Costiera, dei locali servizi tecnico-nautici, e degli equipaggi delle navi ormeggiate e sotto la vigile direzione ed il costante coordinamento della Sala Operativa e del Nucleo Nostromi della Capitaneria di porto di Trieste, ha garantito la gestione ed il ripristino in sicurezza delle situazioni emergenziali occorse. Rimane elevata la soglia di attenzione e l’allerta meteo fino alla giornata del 2 agosto. La Guardia Costiera ricorda sempre a tutti i diportisti ed in generale a chi va per mare di consultare sempre le previsioni meteomarine, in particolare le allerte diffuse dalla Protezione Civile Regionale, per evitare di trovarsi improvvisamente in situazione di potenziale pericolo.",
