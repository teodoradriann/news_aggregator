    "title": "WATCH: Arizona Good Samaritan Dives In to Rescue Driver Whose Car Was Sinking Into Lake",
    "text": "A driver in Glendale, Arizona, is lucky that someone who knew how to handle an emergency dip into a water hazard was in the right place at the right time earlier in June. The 66-year-old man found his car suddenly sinking into a local lake, after he was forced to make an evasive maneuver off the road when a reckless driver got in the way. A woman driving nearby on June 13th, when his car plunged into the lake, acted as a Good Samaritan, and came to his rescue. She says she used to be a lifeguard, so knew what to do. A local news report [gives details](https://www.12news.com/article/news/local/valley/glendale-woman-jumps-into-lake-rescue-crashed-driver-from-water/75-9cb0475a-086c-454a-a8a9-ba173f3cbb9b) on how it happened: On June 13, a driver swerved to avoid a crash at the intersection of 59th Avenue and Behrend Drive. The evasive maneuvers ended with their car crashing into a nearby man-made lake. ... [Amy] Magsamen was driving in the area at the time and when she stopped to help, she saw she had to act quickly. She spoke to the Glendale Police in a new clip, which includes government camera video of the woman's brave rescue. Magsamen explains: I had that lifeguard training. I know you don't dive into water that's unknown. Despite that fear, time was of the essence, so she didn't hesitate to act: The scary part was, the car was going down. It was sinking. Watch: Last Thursday's commute in Glendale took an unexpected turn when a reckless driver caused chaos on the road. One car even ended up in a lake after swerving to avoid a collision! A brave citizen stepped up and jumped into action to save the day.— Glendale Police (@GlendaleAZPD) [#GlendaleHeroes] [#GlendaleAZPD] [pic.twitter.com/uDs76wsiq2] [June 20, 2024] She also has good advice for anyone who finds themselves in a similar situation: Keep your eyes on the victim, try to get her to stay calm. If she doesn't here's what I'm gonna do. If the car goes down here's what I'm gonna do. So it seemed logical. With all of the negative news in the world and signs of bad behavior all around us every day, it's uplifting to find and share these kinds of stories sometimes. We need more people to realize the good in others, even if they're someone they have never met before. You never know -- someday, they could save your life.",

    "text": "Luna Luz Clothing, a newcomer in the world of baby apparel, is pleased to announce the official launch of its e-commerce platform featuring a line of baby clothing crafted from revolutionary bamboo fabric. This unique material not only provides superior comfort for infants but also boasts an exceptional ability to stretch, ensuring a longer lifespan for each piece. Designed with busy parents in mind, Luna Luz Clothing's bamboo-based baby clothing is poised to redefine the way parents approach dressing their little ones. The innovative fabric allows each piece to stretch and adapt to a growing baby's size, accommodating their rapid development and extending the lifespan of the clothes up to three times longer than traditional fabrics. Given the longer lifespan of their clothing line, parents can now experience the convenience of purchasing fewer items, while still ensuring their babies are comfortably and stylishly dressed. The reduced need for constant replacements not only simplifies the shopping process but also aligns with modern parenting values of sustainability and waste reduction. Beyond the uniquely stretchy clothes, Luna Luz Clothing’s mission is to simplify life for parents. Since traditional baby clothing typically only fits for a few months, an infant’s entire wardrobe usually has to be replaced several times a year. This is one more thing parents have to address when raising their children on top of the numerous other responsibilities they already have. Luna Luz Clothing offers this simple, yet elegant solution of their new clothing line to help parents buy, wash, and store less so that they can spend more time with their children.

    "text": "The gorgeous pink, green and purple hue, known as the northern lights , has been illuminating the night skies around the United States and as far south as Florida just after Hurricane Milton blew through the state. The northern lights , mostly only detectable through a camera lens, returned to Florida and parts of the United States on Thursday, Oct. 10 and Friday, Oct. 11. The last time the rare event was visible in this part of the country was in May 2024. What caused the phenomenon? A rare geomagnetic storm sent a barrage of coronal mass ejections from the sun that caused the lights to be visible as far south as the Sunshine State . Take a look at the colorful skies captured throughout the country on Oct. 10 and Oct. 11. Northern lights seen in Florida Aurora borealis, or northern lights seen around the United States What is the aurora borealis, or northern lights? The aurora borealis, or northern lights, are colorful curtains that shimmer in the night sky when charged particles from the sun come hurtling at Earth’s atmosphere. When the particles hit atoms in the atmosphere, it causes reactions in their nuclei of the atoms and the surrounding electrons, which produces the light. Earth’s magnetic field directs the particles toward its poles, where the northern and southern lights can be seen. Will the northern lights be visible Friday night, Oct. 11? NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center issued a rare G4 geomagnetic storm watch for Thursday, Oct. 10 and Friday, Oct. 11. Tips for viewing the northern lights \"Go out at night,\" NOAA said. \"And get away from city lights.\" The best aurora is usually within an hour or two of midnight (between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. in Palm Beach County). These hours can expand toward evening and morning as the level of geomagnetic activity increases. Did you capture northern lights in Florida? We would love to share your photos or videos. Please tell us the location where you capture the aurora borealis and send to Laura Lordi at [llordi@pbpost.com](mailto:llordi@pbpost.com).

Según sus promotores el bisonte europeo recuperaría los perdidos bisontes pintados en Altamira, contribuiría a frenar el cambio climático y operaría como una desbrozadora natural susceptible de prevenir los incendios forestales\", apuntan.\nEl bisonte europeo no es capaz de restaurar ningún hábitat perdido en España\nEn realidad, el bisonte europeo no es capaz de restaurar ningún hábitat perdido en España, ni puede cumplir ninguna de estas funciones mejor de lo que pueden hacerlo los herbívoros autóctonos silvestres o domésticos ya existentes, según indican.\n\"Es imposible que el bisonte europeo pueda sustituir al bisonte representado en Altamira, conocido como bisonte de estepa, porque este bisonte prehistórico es una especie distinta, definitivamente extinguida, que vivió en un hábitat, conocido como la “estepa del mamut”, que tampoco existe en la actualidad\", enfatizan.\nPor otra parte, los expertos aseguran que nadie ha podido demostrar que el bisonte europeo viviese nunca en la península ibérica, por lo que introducirlo en la naturaleza sería ilegal.\nBisonte europeo. / Gilberto Sánchez Jardón\nOriginario de Europa oriental, nunca logró habitar ninguna península mediterránea \"debemos asumir que es incapaz de sobrevivir en un clima tan cálido y árido sin la asistencia humana, que debe proporcionarle el alimento, el agua y los cuidados veterinarios que aquí necesita\". Esta puede ser la razón del importante número de aclimataciones fracasadas por su elevada mortalidad.\nPor razones ecológicas, bioclimáticas, legales y éticas, la introducción del bisonte europeo en España \"es un caso que rebasa los límites del reasilvestramiento razonable\", argumentan.\nLos científicos afirman que se ha pretendido justificar su introducción con supuestos nunca demostrados que han aprovechado su icónica imagen como especie emblemática para conseguir una finalidad carente de evidencias probadas.\nPor razones ecológicas, bioclimáticas, legales y éticas, la introducción del bisonte europeo en España \"es un caso que rebasa los límites del reasilvestramiento razonable\"\n\"Se ha explotado su atractivo social y mediático anteponiendo los aspectos emocionales a los estrictamente objetivos con el fin de generar un ambiente proclive a su introducción, tratando de dar la apariencia de un plan de recuperación de la fauna ibérica extinguida y de que se rescata una especie amenazada\", continúan.\nCon este trabajo, apelan a los grupos sensibles a la conservación de la naturaleza sobre la ilegalidad y error de introducir especies en lugares donde nunca han existido o lo han hecho en condiciones completamente diferentes a las actuales, \"tan solo por el mito que representan\", concluyen.\nReferencia:\n\"Rewilding through inappropriate species introduction: The case of European bison in Spain\".

    "title": "Taiwán: Los practicantes en Hualien desean al fundador de Falun Dafa un feliz Año Nuevo | Falun Dafa - Minghui.org",
    "text": "(Minghui.org) Practicantes en Hualien, Taiwán, se reunieron en el Parque Taipingyang (también conocido como Pacific Landscape Park) el 24 de diciembre de 2023, para celebrar las fiestas y desear un feliz Año Nuevo al fundador de Falun Dafa, el Sr. Li Hongzhi. Practicantes de Falun Dafa en Hualien desean a Shifu un feliz Año Nuevo. Hacía un buen día y después de tomarse una fotografía de grupo, los practicantes hicieron los ejercicios de DAFA juntos. La música relajante atrajo a muchos transeúntes y estaban felices de aceptar información sobre Falun Dafa. \"Escuché sobre Falun Dafa hace años y es genial verles aquí\", dijo Yeh, quien trabaja en un hospital local. Un jubilado, Kuo, dijo: \"Todos sabemos que “el bien es recompensado con el bien\" y \"el mal se encuentra con la retribución\". El Partido Comunista Chino (PCCh) enfrentará consecuencias por perseguir a Falun Dafa\". Los practicantes hacen el primer conjunto de ejercicios de Falun Dafa. Hablando con la gente sobre Falun Dafa. Una mujer (derecha) pregunta dónde puede aprender los ejercicios de Falun Dafa. Salud restaurada Varios practicantes compartieron cómo se han beneficiado de practicar Falun Dafa. La Sra. Hsu Huiyuan, que trabaja en una agencia gubernamental, estaba plagada de problemas de salud. Tomó muchos analgésicos para sus dolores de cabeza. Ella también tomó antibióticos. La hermana de la Sra. Hsu le presentó Falun Dafa en 2001. Poco después de comenzar a practicar DAFA, sus problemas de salud desaparecieron. Impresionada por estos cambios positivos, toda la familia de la Sra. Hsu la alentó a seguir practicando. Hsu Huiyuan agradece a Shifu por su guía. Después de que comenzó a practicar, la Sra. Hsu se enteró de cómo el PCCh persigue a Falun Dafa y quería contarle a la gente la verdadera historia. Se unió a un medio de comunicación y fue a Taipei para aprender composición tipográfica. Aunque no tenía experiencia en la formación tipográfica o la creación de gráficos, aprendió rápidamente y ayudó a presentar los hechos sobre la persecución de Falun Dafa. La Sra. Hsu dijo que había experimentado muchos milagros a lo largo del camino, y agradeció a Shifu. En el nuevo año, planea seguir mejor las enseñanzas de DAFA y ayudar a Shifu a salvar a más personas al compartir la bondad de Falun Dafa. El significado de la vida Desde la infancia, la Sra. Shen Jinlien siempre buscó el significado de la vida. Toda su vida, sintió como si una fuerza la empujara hacia adelante, pero no sabía qué era. En su búsqueda de respuestas, se unió a varios grupos budistas, pero luego descubrió que eso no era lo que había estado buscando. Shen Jinlien dice que es muy afortunada de ser practicante de Falun Dafa. En 2001, una amiga le dijo a la Sra. Shen sobre Falun Dafa y ella tomó la práctica. \"No fue hasta entonces que me di cuenta de lo que había estado esperando era Falun Dafa\", dijo. “Poco a poco aprendí a mirar hacia adentro y mejorarme. Pude dejar de lado los malos apegos y las nociones humanas, para cumplir con los principios de Verdad-Benevolencia-Tolerancia de Dafa \". La Sra. Shen dijo que tuvo la suerte de encontrar a Falun Dafa y convertirse en practicante. “Finalmente aprendí el propósito de la vida. Practicaré diligentemente y ayudaré a Shifu a salvar más gente. ¡Gracias, Shifu y feliz Año Nuevo!\". Propietaria de negocio: una familia feliz La Sra. Chang Yahui posee un famoso restaurante de fideos en la zona. Tiene que levantarse temprano todas las mañanas y hacer fideos. Después de unos años estaba agotada, física y mentalmente. Tenía dolor en el pecho y artritis degenerativa en ambos pies. Para empeorar las cosas, su esposo tenía mal genio y la pareja a menudo se peleaba. Chang Yahui posee un popular restaurante de fideos. En 2001, un cliente le dio a la Sra. Chang un folleto sobre Falun Dafa. \"Después de leerlo, sugerí que mi hermano practicara porque su salud era mala\", dijo la Sra. Chang, \"él estuvo de acuerdo pero dijo que tenía que practicar con él. Así que los dos vimos los videos de Shifu\". A pocos días de empezar la serie de videoconferencias, la Sra. Chang de repente se dio cuenta de que sus preguntas sobre la vida fueron respondidas. Por ejemplo, se había preguntado por qué estamos en este mundo y por qué deberíamos ser buenas personas. \"Estaba emocionada y feliz, finalmente encontré a Dafa y comencé a practicar\", dijo. La Sra. Chang pronto descubrió que sus problemas de salud habían desaparecido. “Una vez, mi esposo de repente me gritó sin ninguna razón. Antes de abrir mi boca para discutir, recordé las palabras de Shifu, que deberíamos ser desinteresados y considerados\", dijo. “Me di cuenta de que mi esposo tenía mal genio, pero él es una buena persona. Curiosamente, él también mejoró después de que yo cambiara y ahora somos una familia feliz\". La Sra. Chang está muy agradecida con Shifu por su compasión. \"¡Gracias, Shifu y feliz Año Nuevo!\", dijo. Todo el contenido publicado en este sitio web tiene derechos de autor de Minghui.org.
