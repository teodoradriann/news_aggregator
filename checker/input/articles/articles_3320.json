    "text": "(Reuters) - Three Christian missionaries from Missions in Haiti were shot and killed in an ambush by a gang in Haiti, the Oklahoma-based group said on Friday. The missionaries were taking shelter in a house when gang members began shooting at the residence at about 9 p.m. CDT (0200 GMT) Thursday, the group said in two Facebook posts. Months of gang violence in Haiti have forced the government into retreat, and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has warned the country is close to becoming a failed state. Haiti’s main international airport in Port-au-Prince reopened this week, nearly three months after it shut due to deadly gang-related violence. But gangs still control much of the capital and Haiti's main seaport remains closed. \"Unfortunately, this serves as a reminder that the security situation in Haiti cannot wait – too many innocent lives are being lost,\" State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said in a statement. Missouri State Representative Ben Baker said his daughter Natalie Lloyd and son-in-law Davy Lloyd were killed while working as full-time missionaries. Davy Lloyd was the son of the organization's founders, David and Alicia Lloyd, who started it in 2000. The identity of the third person killed has not been released. \"My heart is broken in a thousand pieces. I’ve never felt this kind of pain,\" Baker said on Facebook. Missions in Haiti said the couple was leaving a church when they were ambushed by three trucks full of gang members. They took Davy Lloyd to a house, tied him up and beat him, before taking the group's trucks and some items and left, it said. \"Another gang came after to see what was going on and if they could help, so they say,\" the organization said. \"No one understood what they were doing, not sure what took place but one was shot and killed and now this gang went into full attack mode.\" The couple and another individual identified as Jude called a leader of the organization on a satellite phone and said that their lives were in danger.

The workshop concludes with a fun, interactive Ssam (wrap) making activity using fresh produce from the Smart Farm.\nEach session can accommodate up to eight children, who must each be accompanied by a parent or guardian throughout. This program is chargeable at $15 per child, with proceeds from these workshops donated to the President's Challenge.\nInterested families are encouraged to sign up for the Smart Food Lab workshop via this link.

    "text": "Dos amigos de Murcia, obligados a volver de su viaje a Italia tras quedarse sin dinero la primera noche, advierten: \"No caigan\" La de los dos murcianos ha sido una de las historias con moraleja más impactantes del verano Con el verano llegando a su fin y muchos viajeros volviendo a sus casas, es hora de hacer balance de las vacaciones para muchos. Algunas personas traen anécdotas inolvidables, fotos impresionantes y experiencias enriquecedoras, pero también hay quienes regresan con historias de aprendizaje que se convierten en advertencias para otros. Una de las publicaciones más virales y más curiosas de esta temporada ha sido la de dos amigos murcianos que vieron cómo sus vacaciones en Italia se esfumaban en cuestión de horas y que se hicieron virales en redes sociales después de que una cuenta se hiciera eco de su historia. Urgente vuelta de su viaje a Italia tras perder todo su dinero Según contaron ellos mismos, Adrián y Manolo, dos jóvenes de Murcia, pasaron meses ahorrando para hacer un viaje que era su sueño a Roma. Después de pasar semanas trabajando duro y conseguir reunir 950 euros cada uno con la esperanza de disfrutar de dos semanas de descanso y turismo en la capital italiana, tuvieron que volverse casi nada más llegar. La historia de estos amigos se hizo viral cuando uno de ellos la compartió en una reseña en Google Maps, donde explicaba cómo un encuentro casual con un hombre bien vestido en la capital italiana había cambiado el rumbo de sus vacaciones. Según contaban, aquella noche decidieron \"salir de tranquis\" para celebrar que acababan de empezar su viaje y fueron convencidos por este desconocido para entrar en un club. El hombre les prometió que dentro encontrarían \"chicas muy guapas\", y los jóvenes, confiados y animados, decidieron entrar. Una vez dentro del club, la situación se complicó y seducidos por las camareras, quienes los hicieron sentir que habían ligado, los murcianos comenzaron a consumir más y más bebidas. La noche, que parecía una velada divertida, terminó costándoles todo su dinero y cuando se despertaron al día siguiente descubrieron con horror que sus cuentas bancarias estaban vacías porque les habían cobrado cuatro botellas de Moet y seis horas de servicios privados, dejándolos sin un solo céntimo. Desesperados y sin fondos para continuar con su viaje, Adrián y Manolo se vieron obligados a pedirle dinero a la madre de Manolo para poder volver a España terminando así su aventura en Italia, que debía durar dos semanas y terminó abruptamente después de solo dos días.

    "title": "HHS Secretary Kennedy Plans to Cut 10,000 Jobs",
    "text": "By Sandy Fitzgerald | Thursday, 27 March 2025 10:33 AM EDT\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is expected to announce drastic changes to his department Thursday, including cutting 10,000 full-time employees and closing regional offices, according to documents outlining the plans.\nThe cuts in the workforce are in addition to the roughly 10,000 employees who chose to leave their jobs through voluntary separation plans after President Donald Trump took office, reports The Wall Street Journal, which viewed the documents.\nThe cuts include:\nThe plan would shrink the department to about 62,000 by removing one-quarter of its workforce and eliminating five of the HHS's 10 regional offices, according to the documents, which add that essential health services will not be affected.\nThe employees being let go are spread among departments nationwide that are tasked with the approvals of new drugs, providing insurance for the nation's poorest people, responding to disease outbreaks, and more.\nThe CDC, meanwhile, will return to its \"core mission\" of preparing for and responding to epidemics, according to the documents. Its cuts are not to come from the divisions that focus on infectious diseases, an HHS official said.\nThe reorganization further calls to centralize HHS communications, information technology, procurement, human resources, and policy planning efforts that are now distributed through the department's divisions and some branches.\nThe secretary is also planning to create a new subdivision, the Administration for a Healthy America, combining HHS offices addressing toxic substances, occupational safety, addiction, and more into one central office. It will focus on programs addressing chronic disease prevention and health resources for low-income Americans.\nKennedy, a frequent critic of the HHS in the past, ran for president last year on a platform to address chronic disease in America. After he endorsed Trump in August, the two said they were going to \"make America healthy again.\"\nThe Trump administration, through efforts by the Department of Government Efficiency, led by Elon Musk, has cut thousands of federal government employees. Several lawsuits have been filed to challenge the dismissals.\nThe cuts are not to affect the FDA's inspectors or food reviewers, and several FDA probationary workers who had been cut last month were rehired a week later.\nThe plan also calls for several offices to shift.\nThe Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, which oversees the Strategic National Stockpile and pandemic preparedness planning, is to be moved under the CDC, rather than operating as it does now as a separate division.\nKennedy's Administration for a Healthy America is to include the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, the Substance Abuse and the Mental Health Services Administration, along two divisions under the CDC, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.\nOther offices relating to adjudicating or investigating disputes related to Medicare or other areas of HHS are to move to be under a new Assistant Secretary of Enforcement.\nIn addition, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality will merge with the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation to form a new Office of Strategy, and programs for older adults currently under the Administration for Community Living will move to other divisions of HHS, including CMS.\nSandy Fitzgerald has more than three decades in journalism and serves as a general assignment writer for Newsmax covering news, media, and politics.\n© 2025 Newsmax.
