    "text": "Dodgersâ€™ Max Muncy Leaves Game With Devastating Knee Injury\nDuring Clayton Kershaw's achievement of 3,000 career strikeouts, Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy suffered what looked like a very serious knee injury.\nWith the Dodgers down 4-2 in the sixth inning, Muncy crumpled to the ground after successfully tagging White Sox outfielder Michael A. Taylor out at third base on an attempted steal.\nMuncy immediately grabbed his knee and was down on the ground for several minutes before being helped off the field. Shortly after Muncy left the game, Kershaw struck out Chicago third baseman Vinny Capra for his monumental strikeout.\nAs different angles of the injury have been released, it appears as if Muncy severely hyperextended his knee.\nWhat is Max Muncy's Injury?\nA conclusive diagnosis on Muncy's knee has not been given, and likely won't be known until testing has been done in an official capacity. Having said that, the Dodgers are calling Muncy's injury \"left knee pain\".\nMore news:Â Dodgers' Tyler Glasnow Won't Return As Soon As Team Hoped\nFor more Dodgers news, head over toÂ Dodgers on SI.",

    "text": "By Allison Bruhl ,\n2 hours ago\nBATON ROUGE, La. (BRPROUD) — The Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry reports that bird flu, H5N1, has been detected in a second backyard flock.\nPeople who work with birds, poultry or cows are at an increased risk for the virus. Officials suggest poultry owners take steps to prevent bird flu from spreading. Last week , the state wildlife department reported an uptick in wild birds dying from bird flu.\nLouisiana health officials confirmed a human case of bird flu on Friday, Dec. 13. A resident from the southwestern portion of the state was hospitalized. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , there have been 61 reported human cases of bird flu in the nation since April 2024.\nSick or dead birds should be reported by calling USDA’s toll-free number 1-866-536-7593.\n‘Bird flu symptoms’: Online searches spike after first severe case in US Latest News New legislation will provide Social Security benefits to more retirees Democrats warn about impacts of a government shutdown ‘Bring back the Bison’: IU’s mascot movement gaining steam in Bloomington Bird flu detected in second Louisiana backyard flock: officials Senator pushes bill to build high-speed rail systems Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

    "text": "Spain’s Stormy Situation: A Comedic Perspective Ah, Spain! A place known for sun-soaked beaches, mouth-watering tapas, and now—wait for it—floods so bad that even the ducks are getting swimming lessons! Yes, we’re diving headfirst into the puddles of chaos as a raft of new red weather warnings has been issued, prompting the Irish government to send out an urgent alert. You know it’s serious when Ireland gets involved; they usually only send out alerts for Guinness shortages. Who knew that moderation wasn’t just Key lime pie?\nWeather Warning Bonanza! The weather in Spain has turned from balmy to “hold my sangria” in the blink of an eye. Spain is facing an intense deluge thanks to a peculiar weather phenomenon called “DANA”—not to be confused with an ex who shows up uninvited to every party. According to scientists, this storm wasn’t just any ol’ rain cloud; it’s got a special seasoning from global warming. Yes, folks, that’s right—Mother Nature has a range of flavors, and “severe storm with a hint of climate change” seems to be the current special.\nIf you’re looking for more scientific insight, the BBC has reported that our warming world is certainly helping to crank up the intensity of these storms. So, if your holiday photos feature you struggling against the rain while locals smugly dance with umbrellas, just remember: it’s not just you, it’s the planet reminding us who’s really in charge.\nDon’t Forget the Casualties In the tragic aftermath of the storms, we can’t ignore the sobering stats—unfortunately, the death toll has risen to 205. These numbers are indeed heartbreaking, a stark reminder that while we might chuckle about the absurdity of life, the reality hides a more serious tone under all that comedy. People are suffering, and as extra troops are mobilised, we’re left with a bittersweet lesson in how quickly the tides can change.\nMallorca: The Surprise Storm Lockdown And just when you thought it couldn’t get any worse, Mallorca has decided to go into a storm lockdown for an entire long weekend. Think about that for a second: a holiday destination known for letting your hair down and kicking back is now saying, “Nah, mate, we’ll stick to a nice indoor promenade.” Someone tell the tourists packing their bags! Instead of enjoying the beach, they’ll find themselves playing indoor charades while the storm sounds like a relentless percussion section outside.\nConclusion: Laughing Through the Storms So, as we watch the skies turn from blue to “Are we in a disaster movie?” grey, let’s remember to keep our spirits high (just like the floodwaters). Yes, laugh a little, but hold in your chuckles until the weather clears up. After all, what’s life without a good slice of humour, even when nature throws us a curveball? Just remember, if it gets too wet, you might want to consider investing in a kayak—or an inflatable flamingo. Stay dry, folks!\nFor more on the chaos, click here to jump into the latest scoop that will keep your umbrella handy!\nSpain is bracing for more destructive floods following a wave of new red weather warnings issued across the country, prompting the Irish government to send out urgent alerts to residents. The extreme weather has already wreaked havoc in various regions, and officials are closely monitoring the evolving situation. Irish Mirror Leading scientists confirm that the current warming trend in the world has significantly intensified the storm that ravaged Spain, further complicating the terrain and increasing the risk of disastrous flooding events. They emphasize the connection between climate change and extreme weather patterns, urging immediate action to combat this escalating crisis. BBC.com The unusual weather phenomenon known as DANA, or “Depresión Aislada en Niveles Altos,” has been identified as a key contributor to the deadly floods in Spain. Experts explain that DANA is characterized by isolated depressions at high altitudes that can lead to severe and unpredictable storms, exacerbating the impact of climate change on local weather systems. Livescience.com The flood disaster in Spain has led to a tragic increase in the death toll, which has now risen to a staggering 205 individuals. To combat the devastation and assist affected areas, the Spanish government has mobilized additional troops, ensuring that rescue and recovery efforts can be implemented swiftly and effectively across the hardest-hit regions. The Guardian Residents of Mallorca are currently facing lockdown measures as the island prepares for a long weekend storm that has the potential to unleash severe weather conditions. Authorities are urging citizens to stay indoors and take precautions, as heavy rainfall and strong winds are expected to pose significant dangers. Majorca Daily Bulletin",

    "title": "In the Mexican city that once perfumed the world, a push to revive vanilla",
    "text": "PAPANTLA, Mexico — Long gone are the days when heaps of green vanilla pods were drawn into town by mules and laid out on woven mats to dry in the sun, perfuming the streets before being packed up and sold abroad. In this corner of eastern Mexico, known as “the city that perfumed the world,” the aromatic spice once dominated daily life and contributed to Mexico becoming the world’s leading supplier of vanilla more than a century ago. Markets have long since shifted and artificial vanilla is now the global norm. But in Papantla, a city in Veracruz state where the spice is still strongly tied to people’s identity, scientists, chefs and farmers are actively pushing to reassert its profile. Could a vanilla renaissance finally bloom in Mexico? In this city of 160,000, artisans make figurines with vanilla’s shiny dark brown stems. Restaurants serve vanilla-infused dishes. And a prominent plaque by the town square tells the “Legend of Vanilla,” the tale of how vanilla originally grew from the blood of a beautiful Indigenous princess who was decapitated by priests for having a romantic affair. “If you have bad thoughts, they disappear, if you’re angry, it disappears, because the aroma has an effect of high relaxation,” said Lucio Olmos Morales, a local artisan who often works at a table on his porch weaving vanilla pods into crowns, rosary beads and flowers. The indigenous Totonac discovered the vanilla vines that once grew wild in this rainy region, naming the orchids Xanat. They used it for fragrance — women perfumed their hair with the pods — but there’s no record of the Totonac using vanilla in cooking, according to Tim Ecott, author of the book “ [Vanilla: Travels in Search of the Ice Cream Orchid.”](https://www.amazon.com/Vanilla-Travels-Search-Cream-Orchid/dp/080214201X) Later, the Aztecs are said to have used it to flavor a chocolate beverage, served in golden goblets to Emperor Moctezuma. The Spanish colonizers eventually took Mexico’s vanilla to Europe, where it was consumed by the aristocracy and fed a growing craving for hot chocolate. Vanilla was naturally pollinated by bees in Mexico, and when Europeans attempted to grow the plant back home they rarely got it to produce pods. But in the mid 19th century, a slave on the Indian Ocean island of Réunion discovered how to efficiently hand-pollinate vanilla. With French plantations there and elsewhere in the Indian Ocean adopting the technique, by the second half of the 19th century, Mexico lost its spot as the leading producer. Vanilla production in Papantla still boomed, however, in the late 1800s, fueled by the popularity of ice cream in the United States. In the following decades, the growth of artificial vanilla and competition with Madagascar, the current market leader, contributed to the decline of Mexico’s vanilla production. “The market turned to a massified cheap product and Mexico competed for a while but couldn’t really keep up with that,” said Emilio Kourí, a historian and director of the Katz Center for Mexican Studies at the University of Chicago. “People would say, ‘I don’t care, for my Twinkies I’ll just use artificial vanilla.’” Cycles of boom and bust in the market today swing the cured spice from about $300 to $7 a pound, said Josephine Lochhead, the chief executive of the California-based Cook Flavoring Co., which buys most of its vanilla from Madagascar. Mexico is the world’s third-largest natural vanilla producer, behind No. 2 Indonesia, according to 2022 data from the Food and Agriculture Organization. Most of the green vanilla Mexico produced in 2022 — 515 tons, according to the Mexican government — was sold locally. Although California consumers could be interested in Mexican vanilla, the product is too expensive compared with the spice that comes from impoverished Madagascar, where farmers earn less than $2 a day, Lochhead said. Craig Nielsen, co-owner of Nielsen-Massey Vanillas, based in Illinois, said that he sells Mexico’s vanilla to buyers who prefer its “spicy note,” which he compared to clove or nutmeg. These days, those tied to Mexico’s natural vanilla industry are working to increase the spice’s local consumption and production, saying that Mexicans should be encouraged to help small-scale farmers and uphold their vanilla heritage. José Merced Mejía Muñoz, an agriculture ministry official responsible for coordinating with Mexico’s vanilla producers, said that the country hopes to reach 8,000 acres of vanilla in 2030 with more efficient production. In 2022, farmers — mostly in Veracruz state — grew about 800 acres. One hurdle is that producing vanilla, an orchid that grows on a vine, requires intense labor. Only hours to pollinate by hand A newly planted orchid can take three years to bear fruit, and when the flowers blossom in the spring, growers have only a few hours to pollinate each one by hand. The fruit that ultimately emerges is a pod that looks like a long, thick string bean and contains black seeds. In Mexico, it’s picked around November while still green and fragrance-less, and then must be cured. Farmers lay the vanilla pods out on mats to dry in the sun for several months in order to transform the fruit into aroma-producing thin dark stems. Most of Veracruz’s 3,200 vanilla growers, who usually plant it as a side hustle alongside other crops such as citrus, sell the green pods to companies that turn the fruit into products such as cooking extract, liqueur and perfume, according to Crispín Pérez García, head of the state’s vanilla producers council. Farmers have faced disastrous periods where hurricanes and storms have destroyed a season’s crop. They also face theft and low market prices caused by companies willing to buy vanilla that’s been picked before the fruit matures fully. The lower quality hurts Mexican vanilla’s reputation overseas, said Pérez. Much of Mexico’s vanilla fails to meet the quality standards to be sold abroad because the fruit suffers from fungus, poor weather or early harvest to avoid theft, said Angélica Hernández Ávila, the Papantla-based director of the center that supports agricultural innovation at the National Polytechnic Institute. But the biggest challenge is artificial vanilla. Gaya, the leading producer of vanilla in Veracruz, sells a 4-ounce bottle of real vanilla extract for about $5 — several times the cost of artificial vanilla. “In Mexico, people don’t consume natural vanilla, it’s that simple,” said its director, Norma Gaya. Her family-run company, which grows vanilla pods and also buys the fruit from farmers across Mexico, works with university scientists to produce healthier plants, improve cultivation techniques and offer classes to local growers. A lab on its property in Gutiérrez Zamora, a city near Papantla, contains jars of vanilla plants that have been cloned to match varieties that are disease-resistant and have attractive smells. Gaya said that the government needs to better enforce the proper labeling of vanilla products, so that artificial vanilla is not passed off as natural. In the meantime, she and others have tried to ramp up interest in the orchid, holding a local vanilla festival and conferences to bring together vanilla experts. Hernández’s center offers growers lessons in customer service for English-speaking tourists who visit their plantations. But even Gaya, which exports most of its vanilla to the United States, several years ago supplemented its natural vanilla products with an artificial vanilla line. Some producers, such as Juan Salazar García, come from families that have grown vanilla for generations. Salazar runs Vainilla El Ojital, a company in Papantla with an acre of 30,000 vanilla plants. Vanilla farmers have long grappled with theft. Sitting on a chair outside his house by the family’s vanilla orchards, Salazar’s father described how farmers in the 1940s made traps for thieves by placing stakes in a pit hidden with leaves. Salazar gradually made his way into the business, learning at age 10 how to pollinate flowers with a finger. Every spring, Salazar and his employees have only a few hours a day to move as quickly as possible among the orchids to pollinate the flowers after they bloom. It takes about 10 seconds to pollinate each one, he said. “Some days we do feel stressed,” he said. “But we don’t despair.” Salazar has worked with a chemist to help sell natural vanilla liqueur, extract and perfume, as well as an artificial vanilla air freshener after requests from customers. Clients ask him why his vanilla extract is expensive, pointing to cheaper products they find online that are falsely advertised as natural. But Salazar hesitates to expand his artificial line. “As a producer, where would be the value in what I do?” he said. “I need to defend my work.” The farming brings him an annual income of about $47,000 a year, which he uses to maintain his plantation, and he hopes to grow the business with his three sons. He admits he barely consumed natural vanilla growing up — only in horchata water — but believes he can expand locals’ interest “at least a little bit.” Chefs have tried to do that through vanilla-infused dishes. In the 1990s, Mexican chefs began creating recipes with vanilla that went beyond its traditional use in desserts, said Ricardo Muñoz Zurita, a renowned chef in Mexico City. Vanilla, Muñoz said, goes well with subtle flavors and must be used carefully with strong spices such as chile that could overtake the vanilla. More than two dozen chefs contributed recipes to his 2008 cookbook, “ [La Vainilla Mexicana](https://www.gandhi.com.mx/la-vainilla-mexicana?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiA-vOsBhAAEiwAIWR0TVyHy-khJJDMu0FWDgzGj54vFEVAnmLW9KzshuLHsXBls-rGs8e0KBoCnwYQAvD_BwE),” many combining the ingredient with seafood. Among the dishes: avocado soup with vanilla, apple salad with a vanilla vinaigrette, and duck with a chocolate and vanilla sauce. “Of course we’d have vanilla ice cream and custard, but most of the plates were gourmet and all were made not just with the excuse of using vanilla but with vanilla as a protagonist,” he said. In Papantla, tourists who want to try vanilla dishes visit the restaurant [Nakú](https://nakurestaurante.mx/), which translates to “heart” in the Totonac language. The open-air restaurant, which displays and sells vanilla products, spends about $900 a month on four gallons of vanilla extract and about 125 vanilla pods. Patrons can order shrimp served with a creamy sauce made with vanilla extract, a chayote squash soup with vanilla seeds, a vanilla liqueur drink called Papenteco Kiss and plantains flambéed with vanilla ice cream. “The identity of our town is vanilla, like tequila in Jalisco, like the tulips in the Netherlands,” said Nakú owner Lorenzo Collado. Papantla’s vanilla history also lives on through art. The local Ancestral Knowledge of Vanilla restaurant and museum displays a 2.4-foot vanilla-woven Virgin Mary made with 13 pounds of vanilla — which is paraded through the streets every December — and a photograph of a 7½-foot pyramid made with 33,000 vanilla pods and weighing 264 pounds. In the summer last year, Lucio Olmos Morales, the artisan who weaves vanilla on his porch, received a special order. The local church, along with Totonac authorities, had selected Juanita Olarte, a 24-year-old preschool teacher, to be ceremoniously named a protector of Totonac culture at a Mass commemorating the 100th anniversary of the diocese. Olmos was commissioned to make a vanilla headdress to distinguish Olarte in her new role. He used 130 vanilla pods, high-quality stems carrying enough oil so they could be bent into shapes without breaking. The headdress’ elements included a sun with a gem at its center to represent Christ, corn leaves and flowers. As it was placed on Olarte’s head in August at the front of the church, she smelled its strong sweet scent. The vanilla reminds Olarte of her grandfather, who taught her as a small child to pollinate the vanilla plants he grew. “It’s feeling closer to my loved ones,” she said of wearing the vanilla headdress. “I feel their embrace. Although they’re not with me, they feel present.” ©2024 Los Angeles Times. Visit at latimes.com. Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",

    "text": "DA cries foul over newly appointed JDA CEO Critics have accused the DA of being “racist” amid the party’s expressed concerns about the appointment of Themba Mathibe as Johannesburg Development Agency (JDA) CEO. The DA went as far as labelling the appointment as “cadre deployment”, an accusation some South Africans viewed as racist. The JDA recently appointed Mathibe as CEO from June 2024 until May 2029. In a memo addressed to staff from the JDA, HR announced the appointment. “With his wealth of experience and visionary leadership, we are confident he will steer JDA toward continued growth and success. Before joining the JDA, Mathibe served as the COO of the Johannesburg Social Housing Company (Joshco), the Johannesburg Road Agency, and the City of Johannesburg Group Governance. His expertise and experience contributed to Joshco’s mission of creating sustainable housing solutions for the City of Johannesburg residents,” said the memo. Mathibe holds five academic qualifications, of which three are Master&#039;s degrees, including a Master’s of Laws (Commercial and Business Transaction Law), from Wits University, and a Master’s of Laws in Public Policy and Infrastructure Procurement from Stellenbosch University. He recently completed a Master’s of Management in Public Finance and Development Economics and is awaiting research and results. He has served as deputy director at the City of Johannesburg, acting head of department at the Johannesburg Road Agency, and chief operations officer at Joshco. He has been acting CEO of the JDA for the past five months. DA spokesperson on Development Planning in Johannesburg, Daniel Schay, speaking in an interview with a broadcaster on Thursday, said this perpetuates a trend of politicising key municipal positions. “The previous CEO of JDA was suspended without charges before he was dismissed to make way for Mathibe to become a CEO. We have seen job advertisements and they changed the requirements. Previously the requirements for this position was a minimum of 10 years’ experience, The board has changed the requirements for Mathibe to get in, to five to 10 years’ experience,” said Schay. The DA called on Johannesburg residents to stand with them as they “fight” against what they called “undemocratic practices” that consistently work against the residents. https://x.com/themankhosi/status/1798611409330422235 JDA spokesperson Kenneth Nxumalo confirmed seeing the press release from the DA with the allegation, and promised to respond. However, at the time of print, he had failed to do so. Political analyst Jamie Mighti questioned how much more qualified does the DA want a person to be. “As I understand it, this young man has two Master’s degrees. How much more qualified does the DA want him to be before they accept him? Especially when we knew the John (Steenhuisen) education situation,” Mighti said. South Africans took to social media platform X to express their views on this matter, and they accused the DA of being racist. “The DA is whining about Themba Mathibe’s appointment as JDA CEO is purely racist and groundless,” wrote Sesinga Mavikithi. “DA with their matric-less leader must leave Themba alone. He is qualified and capable and deserving,” wrote Lucky Shashaoka. The Star ntombi.nkosi@inl.co.za",

    "title": "Never Run Out of Patients: How SEO Fuels Consistent Growth for Medical Practices",
    "text": "As people start to search for literally everything they need online, SEO is no longer simply good to do. It’s now absolutely essential for business survival. This applies for almost all businesses, even ones serving a local community’s health needs. When potential patients have a question or need, their first move will be to search for a nearby service online.\nIf a business isn’t ranking well in search results, chances are high your potential patients won’t be able to find you. Without effective Healthcare SEO , a service or clinic is essentially invisible to this massive audience.\nTo avoid missing out online, it’s a very good idea to include SEO into established patient retention strategies and take time to focus on local SEO for healthcare . Let’s explore how medical website optimization is able to transform online patient engagement and greatly boost patient acquisition.\nBoosting patient acquisition through medical website optimization Good medical practice marketing strategies will almost always begin and end with a well optimized website. When a website is designed to be engaging for patients and is crafted with SEO best practices in mind, it’ll naturally rank higher and be found more easily using a simple Google search.\nBy refining an existing website with keywords that patients are likely to use in a search, and content that is both informative and simple to understand, healthcare providers can show up first on results and position themselves as a trustworthy place to visit. This is what medical website optimization is all about and why so many clinics rely on SEO in their patient retention strategies.\nThe website can’t simply be stuffed full of keywords. To boost online patient engagement and acquisition over the long term, care must be taken to make the website as welcoming and informative as possible. Modern audiences can tell the difference between a well designed site and one that only cares about ranking high.\nHaving a well crafted site can be a cost-effective way to capture and hold a patient’s attention. This not only increases visibility further but also builds trust and positions a practice as a reliable service to interact with, ultimately converting online searches into new patient appointments.\nMonitoring and measuring performance A solid medical SEO strategy isn’t over once a site has been optimized. Once all the necessary changes have been made it becomes important to track the site’s performance to see what’s working and what can be improved. Metrics such organic traffic, bounce rates and conversion rates will provide interesting tidbits of information that can be used to improve a site further.\nIt’s only possible to know if an SEO strategy focused on patient acquisition is working by checking these metrics. If the numbers go up, this is a good sign. If they aren’t, try identifying areas for improvement and making data-driven optimizations on site pages that aren’t being well received.\nConnecting close to home with local SEO for healthcare Implementing local SEO for healthcare strategies can significantly boost the success of a medical practice marketing plan. It doesn’t help to target patients from Spain if your clinic or practice is in Canada, for instance. Fortunately, it is possible to refine an SEO strategy to only target local patients.\nLocal SEO allows a practice to target patients searching for services within a specific geographic area. So, how does a practice actually improve online patient engagement and increase its local visibility? By optimizing its Google My Business listing, online directories and website with localized keywords. There’s quite a few ways to make a website shine in specific locations.\nEncouraging local patients to leave positive online reviews can also help quite a bit. These words of affirmation can make a business appear more trustworthy within a neighborhood and encourage newcomers to book an appointment.\nBuilding loyalty with SEO While the ability to attract new patients is obviously top priority, a successful medical practice will only thrive if it also focuses on retaining existing ones. The most effective SEO strategies will think beyond simple patient acquisition and play a vital role in patient retention strategies.\nA well made site should be a central hub for patients where they can book new appointments, view their billing information and explore what services a practice offers. If a medical website is crafted to be as helpful as possible using SEO best practices, patients will get used to the convenience and think twice before choosing to switch to a competitor.\nThe most effective medical practice marketing strategies that make use of SEO will encourage two-way communication. By responding to online reviews and comments on a blog a practice can demonstrate commitment to patient feedback and satisfaction. This responsiveness builds a clinic’s reputation by making patients feel both valued and heard. Happy patients are far more likely to return.\nSEO is essential Neglecting to make an online presence as welcoming and informative as possible is a recipe for disaster. Patients are online these days and SEO is indispensable for medical practices that want to grow in the digital healthcare landscape . Fortunately, it’s not difficult to add a dash of SEO to boost a site’s visibility.\nBy fixing up a website for optimal engagement, focusing on local SEO to target patients close to home and adopting new patient retention strategies, practices can enjoy stable growth slowly but surely.",

Officials said there has been a spike in complaints regarding phone scams claiming to be from the prosecutor, law enforcement and court officials. The schemer claims to be calling about a missed court appearance from Kanawha County Judge Douglas. During these conversations or voicemail messages, the scammer claims that he is a deputy with the Kanawha County Sheriff’s Office and that Prosecutor Debra Rusnak has obtained a warrant for arrest that will be effectuated unless the target pays money to the caller. Law enforcement and court officials will never contact you via phone requesting payment of any kind. Officials say although these scammers can be convincing officials say do not send money or other forms payment without taking steps to verify the legitimacy. If you get a similar call, officials say hang up and call 911. Copyright 2024 WSAZ. All rights reserved.",
