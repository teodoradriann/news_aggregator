    "title": "Democrats dominated 2023 with wins on abortion rights, labor",
    "text": "2023 was a good year for Democrats and their issues at the ballot box. Virginia put MAGA-allied politicians with higher aspirations, such as Gov. Glenn Youngkin, on notice. Democrats maintained control of the Virginia Senate and regained control of its House control, halting Youngkin's agenda for his final two years in office. That's a victory for Democrats. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear won an unlikely reelection. This provided Democrats with an interesting snapshot into how to govern and campaign in a progressive way yet connect with a challenging electorate. That's another victory for the left. Two ballot initiative in Ohio favored Democratic positions. The first was a crass attempt by Ohio Republicans to head off a November ballot measure protecting a woman’s right to choose. By conducting a special election aimed at requiring a supermajority for public ballot measures to become law, this measure challenged both women’s rights and our democracy. The vote wasn’t close in what has become a deeply Republican state. People are also reading… Then on the November ballot, a measure protecting reproductive choice passed by a similar margin. These electoral victories make a difference. Just look at two Midwestern states that used Democratic majorities paired with Democratic governors to gain a range of legislative victories. In Michigan and Minnesota, Democratic control brought gun safety laws, protections for reproductive rights and LGBTQ+ communities, climate-friendly measures and more ability of workers to organize. Labor, a traditional Democratic bloc, repeatedly made gains this past year by standing up, speaking out and winning favorable contracts. Workers already had notched victories at Amazon and Starbucks in 2022. This trend continued in 2023 with the headline-grabbing strikes for writers in the entertainment industry and auto workers. Sometimes victory comes more in the form of problems for your opponents. The year 2023 proved that point for Democrats with a stack of woes for Republicans. It was hard not to see that the Republican Party remains wrapped tightly around the little finger of dictator-in-waiting Donald Trump. His legal woes -- business wrongdoing in New York, the careless handling of sensitive documents, and insurrectionist behavior on a national scale -- contrast nicely for Democrats against their governing and electoral successes. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives provides another contrast with its chaotic and dysfunctional running of the people’s business. Leadership elections seems pretty straightforward. The party with the most members elects a speaker and goes about its work. Not so with the 2023 Republican House Caucus. It took four days and 15 votes to get Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., as their speaker. Then came a series of bizarre and fruitless political projects including committee hearings, impeachment inquiries and bills with no meaningful results for the people. The one exception was a deal McCarthy finally made on the most basic of functions -- funding the government. But that promptly cost him his job. Did the chaos subside? Well, no. More speaker votes and infighting followed over the next three weeks until Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., was finally elected speaker. The sum of this very public display of broken and unfit leadership for Republicans can be seen as nothing other than a victory for Democrats. So a quick review of the naughty vs. nice list shows Republicans with a 2023 record filled with dysfunction, contrasting nicely with the Democrats' roster of electoral, legislative and ally victories. Yes, 2023 was a good year for Democrats. Kusler is the national director of Americans for Democratic Action: [adaction.org](https://adaction.org/).

    "text": "Pre-order Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League to get early access\nRocksteady Studios, known for its trio of excellent Batman: Arkham games, are about to deliver another open-world superhero title inspired by the DC universe. Following a substantial delay in early 2023, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League will launch on Feb. 2, and is currently available to pre-order.\nKill the Justice League can be played solo, or cooperatively with up to three additional players to fulfill the roles of Harley Quinn, Deadshot, King Shark and Captain Boomerang. (I mean, the team could’ve filled that last slot with Solomon Grundy, but whatever.) While the four-player co-op may draw comparisons to the ill-fated live service Marvel’s Avengers title from Square Enix, the gameplay we’ve seen thus far more closely resembles a reimagined version of Rocksteady’s previous Batman: Arkham titles, with emphasis on fluid traversal and counter-heavy combat. Speaking of the bat, it’ll be an opportunity to hear Kevin Conroy voice the Dark Knight one last time.\nIf you’re excited to join the ranks of the Suicide Squad, two versions of the game are currently available to reserve for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X, with GameStop offering exclusive pre-order bonuses.\nWhere to pre-order Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League standard edition The disc edition of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League can be reserved for $69.99 from GameStop, Amazon, and Best Buy. If you prefer going digital, it can be pre-ordered via online storefronts including Steam, Epic Games Store, PlayStation, or Microsoft. It’s important to note that it’s coming to the Epic Games Store on March 5, more than a month after its initial launch.\nPre-ordering either the physical or digital versions of the game will grant you access to the classic outfits pack, which includes an alternate “silver-age” costume for each playable character. Pre-orders for the digital PlayStation 5 version includes the Rogue Outfits bundle, containing another set of alternate costumes for each character.\nAt GameStop, placing a pre-order for the Xbox or PlayStation version of Kill the Justice League will ensure that you get an exclusive alternate cover version of the first issue of Suicide Squad: Kill Arkham Asylum. This limited run of comics will include codes to redeem in-game bonuses in each issue.\nWhere to pre-order Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League deluxe edition The $99.99 deluxe edition of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League comes with even more digital goodies, including alternate Justice League outfits for the whole squad, three Black Mask Notorious weapons, the Squad Golds weapon doll, and a single premium Battle Pass token. Additionally, pre-ordering the digital version will get you No Shade color treatments for your outfits.\nReserving a copy of the deluxe edition ahead of the Feb. 2 launch gets you access to the Classic Outfits pack, as well as the Rogue Outfits pack if you pre-order the PlayStation 5 digital version. The biggest perk of all is that this pricier edition lets you play the game up three days early, with access unlocking on Jan. 30.\nPhysical versions of the deluxe edition are available from GameStop, Amazon, and Best Buy, while the digital version can be found on Steam, the Epic Games Store, and the online storefronts for Xbox and PlayStation consoles.",

    "text": "Jan 05, 2024 at 4:06 pm Expand People enjoy opening day of Christkindlmarket at RiverEdge Park in Aurora on Nov. 17. The event, which closed on Dec. 24, drew about 240,000 visitors during its run, organizers said. (H. Rick Bamman/For the Beacon-News) About 240,000 people visited Christkindlmarket at RiverEdge Park in Aurora during the holiday season, a big increase over the numbers in 2022, according to attendance figures released by event organizers Friday. Overall, the Christkindlmarkets in downtown Chicago, the Wrigleyville area of Chicago and Aurora saw more than two million visitors over the three locations during the holidays, according to a press release. Advertisement The 2023 Christkindlmarkets were organized by German American Events, LLC. The group said the numbers released Friday represent “an unprecedented surge in attendance.” The attendance included an increase of almost 100,000 people at the Aurora location in RiverEdge Park downtown, from about 150,000 in 2022 to 240,000 in 2023. Advertisement The flagship location in Daley Plaza in downtown Chicago saw some 1.3 million visitors, according to German American Events. The Wrigleyville location, part of the Wintrust Hinterland at Gallagher Way, saw 480,000 visitors. Christkindlmarket Chicago and Aurora ran between Nov. 17 and Dec. 24, and the Wrigleyville location ran through Dec. 31. “What a wonderful season,” said Maren Biester Priebe, CEO and general manager of German American Events. “We are immensely grateful to each and every visitor and hope that their time with us was filled with magical moments that created cherished memories.” The organization cited several milestones and highlights that contributed to the success of the markets, including the introduction of the first-ever German and Austrian wine-tasting event, glassblowing demonstrations, interactive photo opportunities, location-specific mugs and more. The Aurora market was expanded this year from 39 vendors to 53. The festival also utilized expanded lights and decorations. The Aurora location will start up again in November 2024, the third year of a three-year contract between the city and German American Events. Advertisement",

    "text": "PERRYSBURG, Ohio — A landmark silo in Perrysburg has been demolished due to safety concerns, officials announced this week.\nThe silo, stood at the intersection of Oregon Road and Biniker Drive since the 1880s. Originally a part of the nearby Biniker farm, it was purchased by [Owens Community College](/article/news/local/owens-community-college-early-childhood-forum-mental-health/512-a91e8987-7216-40fd-aefb-f44580c7595e) in the 1990s. Owens transformed the property into an educational complex that includes key facilities like the Engineering Technology, Math and Science buildings, the Healthcare Education Center and the Center for Fine and Performing Arts.\nDr. Dione Somerville, president of Owens Community College, explained that while the silo had historical significance, its deteriorating condition made it unsafe. \"If it were a sound structure and old, we would have kept it, but because of the safety concerns, we had to dismantle it,\" Somerville said.\n\"For us, it allowed us to expand as a campus,\" Somerville added. \"These purchases from the Biniker family made possible many of the programs that now serve our students.\"\nAs Owens Community College approaches its 60th anniversary, Somerville said the decision to demolish the silo was part of a broader effort to evaluate and update the campus to meet the needs of modern learners. \"We continue to evolve with the needs of our students, ensuring that our physical space supports their education and future success,\" she said.\nThough the silo is gone, its legacy will live on in photographs and memories. \"The silo was a symbol of growth and expansion,\" said Somerville. \"It will continue to inspire our students as they prepare for careers in business, industry and workforce development throughout Northwest Ohio.\"",

    "text": "[Expat_Guinea_Ecuatorial](/user/Expat_Guinea_Ecuatorial)a [gaceta.es](/go/link/3891432) [#0](c0#c-0) Ese titular es tendencioso y confuso, y probablemente seas consciente. El ataque no fue durante una misa, como quiere dar a entender, si no que se atacó una serie de aldeas de manera coordinada. Y además, el factor religioso no es el único relevante, y tampoco está plenamente confirmado.\nHay fuentes mucho más serias, informadas y rigurosas que la que has mandado...\n[#10](c10#c-10) Resulta difícil creer que puedan existir fuentes más serias leyendo maravillas cosas como:\nLa reciente matanza sucedida en Navidad confirma lo que anuncian las estadísticas: el cristianismo es la religión más perseguida en el mundo. Y no se limita solamente a esta región de África, sino que ocurre en Asia y Medio Oriente. Hace poco a cristianos perseguidos por el régimen comunista chino se les negó asilo en la España de Pedro Sánchez y el PSOE. Solo una lo pudo obtener porque su salud le impedía subir al avión donde la deportaban.\nTodo ello, mientras las pateras siguen llegando a España, posiblemente con insurgentes tan radicales como los que masacran a los cristianos en Nigeria y sin el amparo para los cristianos que huyen de estos.\n[#9](c9#c-9) bueno. Entérate quién financio al valeroso pueblo de Afganistán y sus valerosos guerreros los muyahidines( les dedicaron Rambo iii y todo), o quien armó y financio a Irak, a estos que ves ahora este terrible atentado de la noticia, quien los organizo y financió, ... Después nos vuelves a contar estás cosas. Y si sigues pensando que está irán detrás de todo pq es omnipresente vale. Si ves q algún otro estado puede estar implicado, fijate quién lo arma y financia. Un saludo.\n[#13](c13#c-13) lo se y lo he criticado 100 millones de veces, dinero de EEUU y Arabia Saudita y Pakistán.\nPero eso no les importa para llamarlos partisanos, \"que en Europa les habría llamado partisanos y que habrían luchado contra los nazis\"\nEso es mierda, el fanatismo religioso no atiende a razones.\nAl menos tu comentario muestra algo de vergüenza de esa gente... Algo es algo.\n[#20](c20#c-20) pues mira otra vez la captura que mandas, pq es exactamente lo que estoy diciendo. Afganistán era un país más adelantado que España y las mujeres iban sin velo. El tío Sam puso a la derecha religiosa conservadora, o lo que viene a ser los fascistas de toda la vida, pero en musulmán, a levantarse en armas... Cómo en Irak, libia, Egipto, Ucrania... Mismo proceder en todos lados, mismo resultado en todos lados. Países de mierda con gobiernos autoritarios y la población paupérrima y reprimida. Eso es el tío Sam.\n[#30](c30#c-30) Claro, Afganistan era un paraiso...\nhttps://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerra_de_Afganist%C3%A1n_(1978-1992))\nTienes una vision de la historia bastante distorsionada. China tambien dio armas a los talibanes para luchar contra la URSS, entre otros tantos paises....\nClaaaaaaro, todo culpa del tio sam...\n[#31](c31#c-31) entérate lo que era Afganistán antes del 92.\nEra un estado laico. En el año 90 la mayoría del profesorado eran mujeres, por ejemplo, que estaba integrada en el mundo laboral.\nY la revolución hostigada por el tío Sam puso a los integristas islámicos. Los valerosos muyahidines, como dijeron en Rambo 3, que les dedicaron.\nInfórmate tú un poquito, antes de hablar sin saber.\n[#32](c32#c-32) tengo entendido dos cosas : Rambo III estaba dedicada a “the galant people of Afghanistan” , lo otro es un bulo . Pero la info en internet se contradice en todas partes acerca de esto , asi que no sé.\nSegundo:\nLo de que Afghanistan era laico , mujeres sin velo etc . se ha mostrado erróneo, solo era en Khabul . En las zonas agrarias (el resto del país) era anticuado respecto a esto .\nPero es un lío y al final no sabes lo que es verdad o no , internet está lleno de información contradictoria .\nMira, igual en que en Gaza, pero estos no lo llaman masacre.\nhttps://www.lavanguardia.com/internacional/20231217/9456963/iglesia-denuncia-israel-mato-sangre-fria-dos-feligresas-gaza.html\nhttps://es.zenit.org/2023/12/12/22-cristianos-muertos-en-gaza-cohete-sin-detonar-hallado-en-parroquia/\n[#14](c14#c-14) Yo no apoyo yihadistas, eso es Israel que apoya a DAESH\nYo soy de izquierdas, no apoyo a la extrema derecha\nNo es muy dificil de entender, ánimo\n[#18](c18#c-18) otro comentario más de \"la culpa es de todos menos de la yihad y los países de mierda donde reina la sharia\"\nHoy te estás coronado máquina.\nQue lastima que estes aquí criticando a occidente para tapar mierdas de asesinos fanatizados y no allí al revés como los verdaderos mártires que si luchan por denunciar atrocidades de países islámicos, ahí veríamos lo valiente que eres con tu reinvidicacion de sofa y tu bandera nazi con la israelí en la foto de perfil.\n[#25](c25#c-25) Financiasteis a los talibanes para combatir a los rusos y ahora estamos pagando los platos\nFinanciar ISIS para destruir oriente medio\nFinanciar siempre lo peor para seguir con los genocidios, apartheid, limpieza étnica...\n[#26](c26#c-26) \"Financiasteis a los talibanes\"\nyo no financie a nadie, manipulador de pacotilla. Típico de esos de la bandera de tu perfil.\nMuestras muchos decíamos que la primavera árabe está plagado de fanáticos religiosos que apoyaban las reveliones, tantos otros decían que \"callate, hacen lo que deberíamos estar haciendo en Europa, es una revolución\". Ahora a gente como tú, si tu, que estás criticando a los críticos con el yihadismo de hamas se le avisa que apoyar grupos terroristas que hacen matanzas públicas es una barbaridad y que esto les embalentona y atrae a más fanáticos y que será la perdición de Palestina no escucháis. Dentro de 10 años saldrán muchos de Europa que han visto gritos de Allahu adbak y tontos en Internet diciendo que el único error de hamas es no haber actuado antes... Luego habrán chavales que pensarán que están siendo héroes en un Isis o unos talibanes dando su vida por puercos que vienen a cuerpo de rey con 4 mujeres y esclavas sexuales.\n[#18](c18#c-18) para tí seguro que extrema derecha es alguien de izquierdas que no compre el pack correntista de turno.\n[#9](c9#c-9) ¿En qué parte de su comentario dice eso? \"no son culpables de sus actos\" y toda la mierda que sigue. O qué parte de su comentario te ha llevado a esa conclusión, si es que necesitas algo más de margen.\nAunque es posible que esa respuesta no tenga nada que ver con su comentario y simplemente sea una patética y lamentable pataleta porque no te ha gustado su respuesta.\n[#17](c17#c-17) \"por no sé que historia\".\n¿O por \"no quiero saber\"? Te dan la oportunidad de aprender, no la desperdicies.\n[#19](c19#c-19) tienes algún comentario de crítica o de repudio a esta atrocidad? O vienes aquí a adoctrinar me sobre lo malo que es eeuu?\nEs una noticia de 160 muertos a manos de yihadistas por ser infieles.\nEntre tu y yo? Es duro entrar aquí a un noticia tan trágica y ponerte a discutir sobre si la culpa es o no es de occidente o ya estás curado de eso?\nEntras aquí a recalcar que \"no quiero saber\" tu verdad... Que ascazo.\n[#21](c21#c-21) Eres tú quien ha introducido este tema. Igual esperabas otro tipo de respuestas y ahora te arrepientes de haberte puesto a chapotear con intención de salpicar a los demás.\n[#23](c23#c-23) en todo momento denunció:\n1* las atrocidades de grupos islamistas radicales, no como tantos aquí que aprendieron que eran los talibanes hace 2 meses y ahora los llaman partisanos. Asesinos es su nombre, como es el del gobierno de irán o Arabia Saudita ente otros.\n2* crítico a los que claramente ocultan y defienden a estos asesinos bajo un pretexto de victimismo en Palestina.\nUn terrorista es un terrorista y lo es con 0 muertos en Palestina y con un millón de muertos.\n[#27](c27#c-27) 1a parte todo bien. Segunda, ya no tanto ¿Cómo que terrorista se es y punto?\n¿Crees de verdad que si a esta gente nadie estuviera tocándole los huevos en su casa harían lo mismo?\nIr a la raíz del problema, a las causas, e intentar desenredar un tema complejo no es defender a nadie.\nEstos son los que en Francia, España e Italia eran llamados partisanos por que no se que mierdas de las circunstancias? O estos los podemos llamar terroristas?\nLa yihad se lleva a cabo con muerte de infieles y el miedo a serlo.\nNo se trata de liberar nada, cada ataque sirve para atraer radicales y causar estragos en los no creyetes.\nQuien apoya a yihadistas es tan asesino como ellos.\n[#3](c3#c-3) Estos son los que llevan EEUU y UK financiando más de un siglo\nA lo más fundamentalista y extremista\nAquí cuando iban a la casa blanca a recibir paguitas\nhttps://es.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archivo:Reagan_sitting_with_people_from_the_Afghanistan-Pakistan_region_in_February_1983.jpg\n[#8](c8#c-8) bajo ninguna circunstancia son culpables de sus actos, siempre es otro, la culpa siempre será de EEUU, de UK, de la sociedad, de la Bernarda, pero nunca ellos y su fanatismo religioso serán los culpables para vosotros.\nVuestra fijación por defender o tapar cada asesino terrorista con escusas es repugnante y os rebaja como... Voy a decir seres humanos.\nEs decir para vosotros el fanatismo islámico viene de un supuesto apoyo de EEUU a hamas y no de irán...\nBoko haram es un paso de baile radicalizado por EEUU.\nLos talibanes son partisanos radicalizados por EEUU.\nLos hermanos musulmanes se radicalizado jugando call of duty.\nPero jamás lobbys, poderes y dinero de países radicales apoyan a estos grupos de mierda.\nAsí es vuestro mundo.\n[#12](c12#c-12) pero si tu pecas de lo mismo.\nA quien coño quieres dar lecciones?\nEEUU: apoyo yihadistas para quitarse de en medio a un enemigo común.\nTu: apoyas yihadistas para quitarte de en medio un enemigo común.\nEso que tienes ahí llamando nazis es la bandera de Israel no? Imagino que no eres simpatizante, pues eso.\nLa única deferencia entre EEUU y vosotros es que a EEUU sólo le movía la política, a vosotros os pierde el fanatismo.\nSabes lo que más me revienta de vosotros? Que no vais a ser vosotros quien caiga en esa oscuridad por vuestra culpa.\nHabrá niños de 15 que se sentirán libertadores, partisanos, defensores poniendo bombas para un estado islámico por vuestra culpa y vuestros comentarios.",

    "text": "El deporte mexicano vuelve a ser escenario de la polémica. La pentatleta mexicana Tamara Vega denunció haber recibido amenazas de muerte por parte de su colega de la disciplina Mariana Arceo. El conflicto habría derivado de la denuncia que la primera hizo en contra de su exentrenador, quien supuestamente enfrenta cargos por trata de personas y pederastia.\n[Te puede interesar: La pentatleta olímpica Tamara Vega denunció amenazas de muerte por parte de su compañera Mariana Arceo](/mexico/2023/12/28/la-pentatleta-olimpica-tamara-vega-denuncio-amenazas-de-muerte-por-parte-de-su-companera-mariana-arceo/)\nLos sucesos habrían acontecido durante el pasado mes de agosto de 2023, durante el Campeonato Mundial de Pentatlón Moderno en Reino Unido. Y es que, derivado del proceso que enfrenta ante las autoridades mexicanas, el entrenador Sergio “N” habría recibido una suspensión por parte de la Federación Mexicana de Pentatlón Moderno (FMPM) y la Unión Internacional (UIPM) de participar en cualquier competencia avalada por ambas entidades.\nEn ese sentido, en la citada competencia, Sergio “N” habría buscado escabullirse hacia la habitación donde se encontraba la pentatleta Mariana Arceo en la Universidad de Bath. No obstante, al percatarse de su presencia, las autoridades decidieron retirar al entrenador de las instalaciones. De acuerdo con la revista Proceso, en la escena hubo jalones y amenazas, entre las que figuraron las palabras de Arceo.\n“Seguro todo esto es por ella (Tamara Vega) ¡Voy a matarla! ¡Todos están locos! ¡La voy a matar! ¡Es una mentirosa! ¡La voy a put*ar!”, habrían sido las palabras emitidas por Arceo durante la escena. Y es que la pentatleta alegó que la presencia de Sergio “N” se debió a que estaba realizando la revisión de una espada que utilizaría en la competencia.\n¿Quién es Tamara Vega?\nNacida en Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, Tamara Vega Arroyos es una deportista mexicana especializada en la disciplina de pentatlón moderno. Su desempeño en dicha especialidad ha sido ampliamente destacado e incluso ha llegado a ser parte de la delegación mexicana en un par de ediciones de Juegos Olímpicos.\n[Te puede interesar: Quién es Mariana Arceo, la pentatleta olímpica que amenazó supuestamente de muerte a Tamara Vega](/mexico/2023/12/28/quien-es-mariana-arceo-la-pentatleta-olimpica-que-amenazo-supuestamente-de-muerte-a-tamara-vega/)\nVega se inició en el deporte como nadadora. Fue en dicha disciplina donde comenzó a brillar en su estado natal, aunque posteriormente recibió una invitación para incursionar en la disciplina de pentatlón moderno en la Ciudad de México.\nA los 17 años participó en los Juegos de la Juventud de Singapur y un par de años después logró clasificar a sus primeros Juegos Olímpicos, es decir los de Londres 2012.\n[Te puede interesar: ¿En qué lugar quedó Checo Pérez en el Top 50 de los mejores pilotos del mundo?](/mexico/2023/12/22/en-que-lugar-quedo-checo-perez-en-el-top-50-de-los-mejores-pilotos-del-mundo/)\nA pesar de la expectativa y euforia de participar por primera ocasión en la justa más importante del verano, la participación de Vega no fue la mejor. Después de caer de su caballo durante una competencia tuvo que resignarse a ser posicionada en el peldaño número 36 del listado en la justa olímpica.\nCuatro años más tarde, durante la edición de los Juegos Olímpicos de Río de Janeiro 2016, el deporte le brindó una revancha a Tamara Vega. En dicha ocasión, la pentatleta mexicana logró mejorar con creces su resultado final. Aunque no pudo colarse entre las mejores pentatletas que se subieron al podio, consiguió ubicarse en el peldaño número 10.\nDespués de dicha competencia, y en el marco de la realización de los Juegos Olímpicos de Tokio 2020, Tamara Vega intentó obtener un boleto para la justa deportiva de nueva cuenta, pero los méritos no fueron suficientes. A diferencia de las ediciones de 2012 y 2016, la pentatleta de Chihuahua no logró competir por tercera ocasión consecutiva.\nCabe mencionar que Tamara Vega cuenta con una medalla de oro, misma que obtuvo en la edición del Mundial de Pentatlón Moderno realizada en el año 2015.\nFue en julio de 2023 cuando la pentatleta realizó una denuncia en contra de su exentrenador Sergio “N”. A raíz de dicha acusación, la pentatleta ha notificado en sus redes sociales el supuesto acoso y hostigamiento del entrenador, así como de personas pertenecientes a su círculo social más cercano.\nMás Noticias\n[La entrada al evento será apto para todo público y no tendrá costo alguno](/mexico/2023/12/28/no-tienes-planes-para-fin-de-ano-el-cascanueces-ofrecera-una-funcion-gratis-en-la-cdmx/)\n¿No tienes planes para fin de año?
