    "text": "Windstream had a subcontractor doing some work for them back in the middle of October, and a line was cut. From that point, those of us without internet service were told a literal smorgasbord of reasons the net was not working, along with even more deadlines as to when it would be repaired.\nReasons for no service were:\n Storm damage. We were done with the storm and had service after the storm.\n A Hub. They told us a hub wasn’t working. They never got into detail.\n A Cut line. This was actually true. But their sub said they were not going to repair it because Windstream didn’t mark it. Windstream said they were not where they were supposed to be and a pissing match broke out.\n We went just over a month without internet service.\nI started calling once a day and listening to someone tell me what was wrong and giving me a deadline. None of the deadlines were met.\nThen I started used “Go Kinetic by Windstream” and saving the text.\n“I see you are using the Go Kinetic app for this chat, and we thank you for that.”\nThat’s what they said at the beginning of each conversation, so I started my conversations by saying it first. This confused the hell out of the men and women in the chat. Most froze up for a few seconds and only one got snarky about it. “Yes, you are welcome, you are funny person.”\nIsrah, the first person I spoke to who told me she had no idea what was going on in Brooks County, but could only tell me what she had been told, was more honest about how little she knew than most. She said she was told to just keep pushing the deadline forward.\nTo really get their attention, I started a rumor within one of those insidious “Word of Mouth” groups on FB. I told people one of the service techs told me it would be January of 2025 before we got service again.\nThe bad news was it was deep into November before we got service back and I was beginning to wonder if I wasn’t right.\nIf you get right down to what happened and why, it was a cut cable. But the reality of not having the internet was I missed music more than anything else. One of the women in my writer’s group was a first class opera singer, and it’s odd listening to a piece of music where you’ve met the singer in person. She was good, not just good, but damn good.\nThen there are all the updates to music I’m following where I could get an email or a notification but streaming was out of the question, even with a hotspot. We live out in the boonies for real.\nI missed writing to music. I missed listening to music at night and doing nothing else. I missed waking up to music. I missed the music I listen to frequently, old favorites, and songs I still sing that I heard first in high school.\nUsually, when I’m home, I’ll get a playlist going that will last for hours. I have a Pink Floyd playlist with seven albums on it. I have a playlist with just songs I like on it that would last three days if I listened to it all the way through.\nStreaming music is a lot different than the way I learned to listen to music and I love it. Hours and hours of time spent working out, writing, chilling or doing yardwork and never having to mess with the music at all. It’s always there. Until a cable gets cut.\nTake Care,\nMike\nMike writes regularly at his site: The Hickory Head Hermit .\nOpinions expressed in this article are not necessarily those of the management of this site.",

    "text": "PETALING JAYA: In the wake of robust economic expansion witnessed in 2023, the resilience of the national economy will stand as a testament to its stability in 2024, said economists.\nMalaysia University of Science and Technology economist and provost for research and innovation Prof Geoffrey Williams said Malaysia is poised for a positive economic performance this year, signalling a resolute stride towards prosperity and resilience.\nHe cited the Statistics Department, which said the national economy exhibited resilience in the face of global uncertainties and registered positive growth in 2023, primarily driven by robust industrial production and retail sales.\nChief Statistician Datuk Seri Mohd Uzir Mahidin reported a 3.9% economic growth for the first nine months of 2023, a notable contrast to the 9.2% growth recorded for the same period in 2022.\nWilliams said: “The positive trajectory was underpinned by a significant upswing in the industrial production index, which grew to 2.7% year-on-year in October 2023.\n“This was driven by the mining sector’s robust performance.”\nHe said the manufacturing sector faced challenges as its sales value experienced a 1.4% decline to RM156.7 billion in October 2023, influenced by a notable drop in the petroleum, chemical, rubber and plastic products sub-sectors.\n“On the other hand, the wholesale and retail trade sector saw a commendable increase in monthly sales value, reaching RM142.3 billion in October.\n“This was driven by the expansion of the wholesale trade sub-sector.”\nOn the economic outlook for 2024, Williams foresees a scenario characterised by a moderation in growth compared with 2023 and a sustained and controlled level of inflation.\nHowever, he said there are persistent challenges in attracting investments due to various local and global events recently.\nAs a result, on the trade front, a contraction of 2.4% was recorded year-on-year in October 2023, with both exports and imports experiencing a decline.\n“The trade surplus stood at RM12.9 billion, which reflected a 30.3% decrease from the previous year,” he said.\nWilliams emphasised the diversification of the economy by promoting sectors with growth potential.\n“A diversified economy is less vulnerable to external shocks and provides a broader range of investment opportunities,” he said.\nHe also underscored the need for conservative fiscal management and called for an analysis of tax reforms to improve revenue sources, and attention to good governance to reduce wastage and corruption.\n“My analysis stems from various factors influencing the economic landscape, including domestic and global conditions. Stakeholders and policymakers should formulate strategies and policies to navigate the evolving economic landscape this year,” he said.\nMonash University economic professor Dr Niaz Asadullah said 2024 will reflect confidence in the level of business investments and will contribute to job creation, innovation and overall economic expansion.\n“International trade, a crucial driver of economic interconnectedness, encapsulates the exchange of goods and services across borders.\n“Therefore, it is crucial to analyse key indicators such as GDP (growth domestic product) growth, consumption, investment, international trade, inflation and unemployment,” he said.\nHowever, Niaz highlighted Malaysia’s vulnerability to global economic trends and the importance of sustaining domestic demand.\n“Political stability has impacted the quarterly GDP growth in 2023, so there is a need for reforms to enhance the productivity of small and medium-sized enterprises to drive growth in 2024.\n“Therefore, it is important to propose reforms to the labour market and balance fiscal strength with provisions for popular support, which will ensure political stability.”\nHe said the government should work to overcome high-priority issues such as poverty and unemployment, subsidy rationalisation, raising incomes, improving job prospects and addressing long-term care and student loans this year.\n“By focusing on the importance of proactive measures, reforms and careful consideration of various factors to navigate the evolving economic landscape, Malaysia can experience a positive economic outlook in 2024,” he said.",

Purple Heart recipient Wayne Weaver, 63, is due to leave a Loves Truck Stop in Horizon Jan. 4, on a journey that will take him from El Paso to Fort Worth, followed by Norman, Oklahoma and back down to Houston. Along the way, Weaver will visit veterans -- including his uncle, a Purple Heart recipient and Three Bronze Star Veteran, who is buried at Evergreen Cemetery in Houston -- with his two German shepherds and a wagon carrying his belongings in tow. \"There's nothing I wouldn't do for people that need help and veterans that need help, and even sick and handicapped kids,\" said Weaver. Weaver is embarking on the trip out of his own pocket, however, should you see him walking in your neighborhood, donations are appreciated.

    "text": "Godung/Getty Images\n© 2024 Blaze Media LLC. All rights reserved.\n'Junk DNA' is bunk! Why the human genome argues for intelligent design\nNovember 21, 2024\nProminent evolutionary theory skeptic Dr. Casey Luskin tells Align why science shows an intelligence behind the creation of life.\nIn my quest to learn the ins and outs of the orthodoxy of evolutionary theory (and therefore bring to light its deficiencies), I discovered geologist and lawyer Dr. Casey Luskin, associate director of the Center for Science and Culture at the Discovery Institute.\nA proponent, researcher, and advocate for intelligent design, Dr. Luskin has been defending academic freedom for scientists who face discrimination because of their support for ID for nearly 20 years.\nLife is very low entropy, meaning it’s very ordered, and yet it’s also very high energy. How exactly does life maintain this seemingly contradictory state?\nI’ve written about it here\n[before](https://www.theblaze.com/align/why-evolution-is-fake), but I shared with Dr. Luskin my personal skepticism concerning the [religion](https://www.theblaze.com/tag/faith) of evolution. As a layman (relative to him), it seemed to me as if Evolution™ had an “invisible hand of God” problem that’s never been seriously addressed.\nMeet me in the middle\nThe mythology of Evolution™ seems to have a beginning (the Big Bang), an end (modern Homo sapiens), but no middle. And as I came to understand from my conversation with Dr. Luskin, much of the evidence for evolutionary theory amounts to flimsy, tenuously linked assumptions on the verge of being disproved in various fields.\nWe began by discussing one of the more popular arguments against intelligent design: the concept of “junk DNA.\"\nThe argument goes something like this: If everything is intelligently designed, then why does the vast majority of our DNA seem to serve no purpose?\nAs Dr. Luskin explained, the idea originated in the early 1960s, when scientists mapped out the molecular protein production process: DNA encodes RNA, which then carries that information to ribosomes, which in turn use it to assemble chains of amino acids into proteins.\nBecause so much of the DNA that had been studied up to that point did not seem to be doing that, it was tossed in the proverbial junk bin, hence the name.\nSelfish genes\nThe idea really took off with the publications of Japanese geneticist Susumu Ohno’s “So Much Junk DNA in Our Genome” in 1972 and Richard Dawkins’ “The Selfish Gene\" in 1976.\nOhno famously asserted that 90% of our DNA was total nonsense. Dawkins piggybacked off that and gave the junk DNA a “purpose,” saying that the only true function of the gene was to replicate itself. Whether or not the gene helps you is of non-substance.\nLuskin was one of the first to push back against this idea. As an undergraduate at the University of California, San Diego, he experienced firsthand how the \"junk DNA\" theory was used to dismiss the burgeoning ID movement.\nLuskin would argue with his professors and peers that it was still premature to conclude that most of our DNA could be classified as “junk,” citing the unfinished-at-the-time Human Genome Project as evidence for the lack of evidence.\nLuskin seems to have been onto something. In the past few years, the “junk DNA” theory has slowly unraveled.\nGod don't make no 'junk'\nThis is in large part thanks to a groundbreaking series of papers entitled the ENCODE Project, published by biologists studying “non-coding” DNA — the goal being to uncover the mysteries of the human genome.\nSince the ENCODE Project began in 2010, it has found that at least 80% of the genome has shown evidence of biochemical functionality. In other words — contrary to junk DNA theory — this DNA is transcribing information into the RNA.\nAnd as for the other 20%?\nThe lead researchers of the ENCODE Project say that many of these non-coding elements of DNA occur within very specific cell types or circumstances, so to catch them in action doing what they’re supposed to be doing is simply very difficult. But they predict that as they study more and more cell types, that that 80% figure will most certainly jump up to 100%.\nAll this is to say that applying a Darwinian paradigm to discoveries about gene function has led to erroneous conclusions about \"junk DNA\" — which then, in turn, has been used to justify the same Darwinian theory that spawned it.\nInformation, please\nMeanwhile, Intelligent Design's predictions that we would find function for that junk DNA have been borne out.\nAs Luskin pointed out, the origin of life is the origin of information. Life, on its face, is a very strange arrangement of matter.\nIt’s very easy to find things that are high entropy-high energy (think tornadoes or explosions) or low entropy-low energy (snowflakes, crystals). But life is different. Life is very low entropy, meaning it’s very ordered, and yet it’s also very high energy.\nHow exactly does life maintain this seemingly contradictory state?\nMachinery.\nJedi mind trick?\nOur cells are full of molecular machines that process and encode information to be used as applicable instructions. That is what our DNA, RNA, and ribosomes are all there for. They’re machines that process information.\nImagine you wanted to watch \"Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith\" on DVD. Would you be able to watch it without the DVD player? No.\nImagine if the instructions for building the world’s first ever DVD player were on a DVD. Could you build the DVD player just with the DVD? No.\nThe information and the information-processing machine are inseparable.\nThe question then becomes: How did these machines come into being?\nDid they build themselves? No, we just showed how that can’t be the case.\nThe only plausible answer is — intelligence. There needed to be an intelligent designer to create both the machinery and the instructions.\nDespite the initial mockery greeting Intelligent Design, the theory is gaining ground as a reliable model and explanation for the origin of life and genes. And that’s simply because the evidence is getting to be a bit undeniable.\nMake sure to follow Dr. Casey Luskin’s work\n[here](https://caseyluskin.com/).\nWant to leave a tip?\nWe answer to you.

    "title": "Empleo: hay beneficios que ya no son \"negociables\" a la hora de aceptar un trabajo",
    "text": "Ante un escenario laboral cada vez más dinámico y competitivo, se hace imperativo para las empresas, atender las expectativas y necesidades de los empleados si es que tienen el objetivo de retenerlos. En este sentido, un conjunto de \"beneficios\" laborales vienen posicionándose como uno de los factores decisivos al momento de elegir un empleo. De acuerdo con el informe \"Retos y perspectivas del trabajo: revelando las claves de la evolución laboral\", hecho por WeWork y la consultora Michael Page, la gran mayoría de los profesionales argentinos consideran como “no negociables” a los siguientes beneficios: - La flexibilidad: el 71% de los encuestados por estas firmas sostiene que la flexibilidad de horarios y la posibilidad de elegir libremente su lugar de trabajo, tiene un peso decisivo en la aceptación o rechazo de una propuesta de trabajo. - El apoyo de alimentación: un 17% considera a este beneficio como relevante. Este tipo de apoyo se da a través de vales de alimentos, descuentos en supermercados, o la provisión de almuerzos en el lugar de trabajo. \"Este beneficio refleja un reconocimiento por parte de las empresas de las necesidades básicas de sus trabajadores y su compromiso con su salud y calidad de vida\", según el trabajo. - Los planes de salud: en tercer lugar, con el 11%, la cobertura médica y los programas de bienestar son cruciales para los trabajadores. Un buen paquete de salud no solo garantiza la atención médica, sino que también demuestra el compromiso de la empresa con el bienestar de sus empleados. - El apoyo para el trabajo remoto: muchos empleados consideran este beneficio como esencial para su bienestar, permitiéndoles gestionar su tiempo y reducir el estrés del desplazamiento diario. Este beneficio fue elegido por el 7% de los encuestados. - Las vacaciones adicionales: con el 7%, las vacaciones adicionales contribuyen a una mayor motivación y productividad cuando regresan al trabajo”, analizan los expertos en Recursos Humanos. El peso del \"salario emocional\" Según Romina Diepa, People Partner Manager de WeWork, \"desde la flexibilización de los mercados laborales hasta la búsqueda de nuevas oportunidades, los argentinos vienen experimentando un cambio significativo en sus patrones de trabajo y en sus expectativas profesionales. En este sentido, los beneficios laborales que las empresas ofrecen hoy juegan un rol crucial en la satisfacción, atracción y retención de los colaboradores; por lo tanto, es fundamental que las organizaciones adapten sus políticas para alinearse con las demandas y necesidades que cada vez están más presentes entre los colaboradores.” explicó. También desde la organización Adecco sostienen que el sueldo no es el único factor de relevancia para los empleados. Por eso, incorporan el concepto del “salario emocional”, es decir el conjunto de beneficios no económicos que valoran los colaboradores de una empresa y contribuyen a mejorar su calidad de vida. Sin embargo, el punto es hasta dónde se aplican estos beneficios. Este año, Adecco hizo una encuesta a nivel nacional para conocer cuál era la situación actual de los trabajadores en relación a los beneficios otorgados por las empresas. Un 54% de los encuestados afirmó no recibir ningún beneficio. Entre los que sí tenían beneficios, el 70% estaba conforme con lo que se le ofrecía. Según las estadísticas de esta firma, el 58% de las empresas relevadas liquida conceptos adicionales además de la remuneración bruta fija. Entre los beneficios más valorados, según los sondeos de esta compañía, figuran los bonos, el reintegro de viáticos, premios, almuerzos, tarjetas precargadas, tiempo flexible para trabajar y hasta seguros adicionales.
