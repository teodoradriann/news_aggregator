    "title": "Viral photo of forlorn Spiral Hot Dogs owner leads to booming business",
    "text": "An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Hosek standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Hosek would soon have no time to stand around as \" Spirals: Hot Dogs & More ,\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Hosek told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Hosek found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Hosek said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Hosek wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance. Noticing Hosek gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\" \"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Hosek waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Hosek is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Hosek said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Hosek added.",

    "text": "O ministro Alexandre de Moraes , do Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF), decidiu, nesta quinta-feira (15), aumentar de R$ 50 mil para R$ 200 mil a multa diária aplicada contra a rede social X (antigo Twitter), comanda pelo bilionário Elon Musk , por descumprimento de decisão judicial.\nO caso envolve uma determinação de Moraes para a rede social bloquear o perfil do senador Marcos do Val (Podemos-ES) e de outros investigados. Segundo o gabinete do ministro, a ordem não foi cumprida.\nNa terça-feira (13), o senador foi alvo de medidas cautelares determinadas pelo ministro no âmbito das investigações sobre os atos golpistas de 8 de janeiro .\nAlém do bloqueio das redes sociais, o parlamentar teve as contas bancárias bloqueadas até o valor de R$ 50 milhões. A medida foi divulgada pelo próprio parlamentar em postagem na plataforma.\nNa decisão, Moraes alertou que um novo descumprimento da determinação poderia configurar crime de desobediência pelo representante legal do X no Brasil.\n“Fica determinado, ainda, que a decisão anteriormente proferida, cujo teor foi comunicado mediante o ofício eletrônico, deverá ser cumprida no período máximo de uma hora, sob pena de multa diária de R$ 200 mil para cada um dos perfis indicados”, decidiu o ministro.\nApós a determinação de bloqueio, Do Val disse que as medidas determinadas contra ele fazem parte de perseguição política.\nLeia também “É algo pessoal do Alexandre de Moraes comigo”, diz Bolsonaro sobre investigações O ex-presidente deu as declarações em entrevista a uma emissora de rádio de Natal, no Rio Grande do Norte. Bolsonaro deu início a um giro de três dias pela região Nordeste do país para uma série de atos políticos\n“Essa ação não pode ser interpretada de outra forma senão como uma clara e flagrante demonstração de perseguição política. Não há base legal ou lógica que sustente tal medida, evidenciando que o objetivo não é outro senão o de tentar silenciar e prejudicar um parlamentar em pleno exercício de suas funções. É um ataque ao direito e à democracia, que não pode ser ignorado”, afirmou.\nEm publicação no X, Elon Musk, dono da rede social, classificou como censura as decisões judiciais que determinam bloqueio de contas de apoiadores e pessoas ligadas ao ex-presidente Jair Bolsonaro (PL ).\nThis platform is being asked to censor content in Brazil where the censorship demands require us to violate Brazilian law!

    "title": "Fasting left me in awe of discipline required to observe Ramadan",
    "text": "LONDON: Ramadan holds multiple points of significance for the Muslim world. Perhaps most famous for its month-long fast, it is also believed to have been when the first verses of the Qur’an were revealed to Muhammad.\nNeither Muslim, nor someone who had before — at least knowingly — fasted, the request from Arab News to do one and write about it left me with several questions.\nWhy? What would there be to write about besides feeling hungry and thirsty? And would I buckle and gorge on the Sainsbury’s grocery delivery I had lined up for the proposed day?\nIt turned out that having successfully gone from dawn to dusk without breaking the fast, I did indeed have some self-control when it came to eating.\nPerhaps more importantly, it provided an opportunity to gain a greater understanding of why friends I know do it, and what it offers to the Muslim community, not to mention leaving me in awe of the physical and mental will required to fast for the full month.\nWaking up a little after 3:30 a.m., I followed the instructions provided by my colleague Zaynab: “Eggs, banana, porridge.” I gave the dates a miss, mainly through forgetfulness.\nAt this point I should state that the absence of food or water for one 14.5-hour stretch did not leave me overly nervous. In fact, given it was to be a single day, I would say to write anything on it was, if anything, quite bizarre considering the famines gripping swathes of the world.\nSpeaking to a friend and Arab News colleague Tarek, I did, however, question how faithful people were when it came to missing out on any drink during daylight hours.\n“No, not one drop, sir,” he said before agreeing that given a propensity for human social engagement to inform some form of consumption, this period of abstinence obviously affected social relations.\nHe added: “But there are other effects, including dizziness, fatigue, lethargy, lack of focus, and cravings — one day is fine but it is doing it consistently that makes it tough.”\nTarek’s reflections came about five hours into my own fast, and having followed Zaynab’s recommendations, I can confirm that I was not feeling any pangs of hunger at this stage, but by about midday I was finding my attention drawn more toward water.\nI spoke to other observant Muslim friends, and one thing that came across was that while there was a general uniformity toward the observation of the fast, it was not monolithic.\nFor instance, one friend said that they did without food for the whole period, but abstaining from water was somewhat dependent on the time of year that Ramadan fell: if in the summer, they would do without all drinks but water.\nAnother friend, Nabila, said she was stricter than most of her friends and family, additionally doing without music as part of her observation of the holy month.\nShe added: “The way I see it is that it is one month. For the rest of the year we can do what we want, but through that one month of observation I gain a lot and I become more focused on some of the ills of society; that in turn helps me readjust my engagement with the world.”\nNabila’s focus on those undergoing forced fasts, with this year’s Ramadan coinciding with the largest assault on Gaza in a generation, was shared by others I spoke to or heard.\nSpeaking to the BBC, Dr. Amjad Eleiwa, the deputy director of the emergency department at Gaza’s Al-Shifa Hospital, said that Palestinians in Gaza had “already been fasting for months,” with others noting the “dark shadow” Israel’s war had cast over what Nabila said should be a joyous time.\nShe added: “It’s not easy, though. I have little or no energy and I struggle with work. You won’t see me out. It is not easy and anyone who says it is, well, they’ve probably not committed.”\nEqually, however, Nabila noted that the breaking of the fast each day brought its own reward, describing the anticipation immediately before eating as a feeling “of excitement, that ends in a sense of euphoria … I can’t really describe it.”\nAs my own, solitary day of fasting came to an end, I found myself feeling, as it was suggested I might, almost in a post-hunger state. How did I break my fast? A yogurt.",

    "title": "Des microplastiques dans le bulbe olfactif du cerveau humain",
    "text": "Une étude à partir des bulbes olfactifs de 15 personnes décédées montre que des microplastiques peuvent y être détectés, suggérant une voie potentielle de translocation des microplastiques vers le cerveau. La pollution par microplastiques (MP) est devenue, ces dernières années, une préoccupation environnementale majeure, soulevant des interrogations quant à ses effets nocifs potentiels en cas de passage dans le corps humain. Des MP ont été détectés dans des organes très divers mais, à ce jour, cela n’avait pas été rapporté dans le cerveau humain. De fait, la barrière hémato-encéphalique constitue un facteur limitant essentiel. Toutefois, l’accès au cerveau des micro et nano plastiques pourrait se faire par la voie olfactive, via les neurones olfactifs qui transmettent les informations vers le système olfactif cérébral : leurs axones traversent la lame criblée de l’ethmoïde pour atteindre les bulbes olfactifs (BO), eux même connectés au système limbique. Certaines données laissent à penser que la voie olfactive pourrait permettre la translocation de particules exogènes vers les structures cérébrales. En effet, des particules de carbone noir ont été détectées en quantité dans les BO, de même que la forme amiboïde de Naegleria fowleri, à l’origine de méningo-encéphalites. De par la présence ubiquitaire des MP dans l’air ambiant et également dans les cavités nasales, l’hypothèse d’une pénétration des MP de très petite taille vers les BO est plausible. Une série autopsique de 15 cas Un travail a été mené entre février 2023 et mai 2024, à partir de l’analyse des BO de 15 individus décédés, qui avaient tous résidé au moins 5 ans à Sao Paulo (Brésil). Des renseignements précis ont été réunis sur leur profession, leurs pathologies et mode de vie. Un antécédent d’intervention neurochirurgicale constituait un critère d’exclusion. Il fut aussi procédé à l’analyse des BO de 2 bébés mort-nés à 7 mois de grossesse, qui ont servi de contrôle négatif. Sous stricte mesure de non-contamination extérieure, il fut procédé à une spectroscopieinfrarouge à transformée de Fourrier (µFTIRI), après préfiltre par fibres de cellulose dont la taille des mailles était de 0,45 µM. Lors de chaque étape, de grandes précautions ont été prises pour éviter toute contamination par l’air ambiant. De même, l’eau utilisée était ultra purifiée et le personnel de laboratoire portait des blouses exclusivement en coton, à l’exclusion de tout plastique ou autre textile. Dernier point, les échantillons de BO furent examinés dans une cabine à flux laminaire et des filtres propres servirent de contrôle négatif. La présence de MP fut évaluée au niveau du BO gauche, en microscopie optique après 48 heures de lyophilisation maintenant l’intégrité des tissus. La partie droite fut, pour sa part, congelée en flacons de verre scellés, puis incubée en boites de Petri maintenues closes jusqu’à l’analyse µFTIRI. La taille des particules décelées fut analysée par analyse microphotographique après spectroscopie. La couleur et la composition polymérique des MP détectés ont également été analysées. Des microplastiques dans les bulbes olfactifs de 8 des 15 cas L’âge médian des 15 individus (dont 12 hommes) autopsiés était de 69,5 (33-100) ans. La masse moyenne des BO prélevés était de 0,187 (0,05) grammes. Au total, 16 particules de synthèse et de fibres ont été identifiées, entre 1 et 4 par BO. On notait 25 % de particules sphériques. Elles avaient une longueur moyenne de 12,1 (7,2) µm, allant de 5,5 à 26,4 µm et une largeur moyenne de 21,4 (2,6) µm, variant de 10,0 à 24,5. Il fut identifié 2 fibres de coton, 2 perles de silicate et un fragment de silice. Dans 43,8 % des cas, le polymère décelé était du polypropylène. Point notable, les matériaux mis en évidence n’ont pas été retrouvés dans les filtres témoins négatifs, confirmant ainsi un risque très faible de contamination au cours de l’étude. Il s’agit donc là, à priori, du premier travail décelant la présence de micro particules dans le cerveau humain, avec étude en µFTIR permettant leur quantification et leur caractérisation. Ces particules ont été décelées dans 8 des 15 BO autopsiés. Il est ainsi fait la démonstration que, non seulement du carbone noir, mais aussi des MP peuvent passer des cavités nasales vers le cerveau à travers la lame criblée de l’ethmoïde qui comporte de multiples foramen, de moins de 1 mm de diamètre, autorisant le passage des neurones olfactifs, la surface totale de ces pertuis tendant à diminuer avec l’âge. En outre, une partie de l’écoulement du liquide céphalo-rachidien s’effectue via des vaisseaux lymphatiques entourant les axones olfactifs, avec, mis en évidence chez la souris, des espaces paracellulaires pouvant laisser passer des particules de plus gros calibre. Ces constatations renforcent l’hypothèse que les voies olfactives pourraient être un site d’entrée de particules exogènes vers le cerveau, la présence de ces dernières pouvant, éventuellement, être associée à des manifestations neurologiques et/ou psychiatriques, telles qu’une démence, une maladie de Parkinson, voire, chez l’enfant, à des troubles du développement cérébral. Dans cette étude brésilienne, les MP décelés sont pour la plupart des plastiques retrouvés communément dans les emballages ou les vêtements. Il faut toutefois signaler quelques réserves à cette étude. D’autres voies de pénétration vers le cerveau sont possibles, via la barrière hémato-encéphalique, les voies respiratoires ou le nerf trijumeau. Par ailleurs, la matière biologique des BO a quelques similitudes avec celle de matériaux polymères. Enfin, les techniques de spectroscopie µFTIR ne permettent pas de déceler des nano plastiques... En conclusion, ce travail confirme la présence de MP dans les BO, essentiellement de polymères, type polypropylène et nylon, suggérant que les voies olfactives pourraient constituer une porte d’entrée vers le cerveau de polluants environnementaux présents dans l’air ambiant. Serait-ce à mettre en parallèle avec l’augmentation des maladies neurodégénératives ? Des technologies complémentaires non invasives, telles que l’imagerie par résonance magnétique, pourraient permettre de dépasser les limites actuelles de l’analyse des tissus humains et mieux comprendre les dangers des MP pour l’homme.
