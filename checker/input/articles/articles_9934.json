    "text": "Shares of technology companies rose as traders dived back into the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\nApple shares surged by more than 3% after analysts at brokerage JPMorgan said the tech giant's artificial-intelligence enabled iPhone could cause a wave of upgrades akin to that which occured upon the launch of 5G-enabled phones.\nHedge-fund traders are increasingly buying into Apple following its recent selloff, said the JPMorgan analysts. Shares of Apple are now down roughly 6% for the year to date.\nMicrosoft shares rose after analysts at brokerage Morgan Stanley said an analysis of its generative artificial-intelligence revenue-growth prospects \"increased confidence in the durability of Microsoft's earnings-per-share growth trajectory and in Microsoft's AI leadership position ahead of the large market opportunity.\"\nAmazon Chief Executive Andy Jassy said generative artificial intelligence could be one of the largest technological transformations in decades.\nAmong other mega-cap tech stocks, shares of Nvidia rose by more than 3%.\nMicron Technology shares rose after the memory-chip maker estimated a recent earthquake in Taiwan will result in an impact of up to a mid-single-digit percentage of a calendar quarter's company-level DRAM supply.\nWrite to Rob Curran at rob.curran@dowjones.com\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n04-11-24 1723ET\nShare © Dow Jones - 2024",

    "text": "Millions of Britons are set for a New Year's Eve washout as parts of the UK brace for 75mph gales, flooding and snow over the long weekend. With seven named storms over the last three months bringing travel chaos, blizzards and even a tornado, revellers seeing in 2024 have been warned to wrap up warm and hold onto their party hats amid near-freezing conditions. This week, Storm Gerrit has wreaked havoc across the UK - and forecasters have warned that a low pressure system is set to bring more wet and windy weather. In England, the Environment Agency has issued 31 flood warnings, where flooding is expected, and 97 flood alerts, where flooding is possible. Meanwhile in Scotland, which has been heavily impacted by Storm Gerrit, there are five flood alerts and six flood warnings. In Wales, there are 11 flood alerts. Drone footage has shown that parts of the UK have already faced major flooding, including at a racecourse in Worcester after the River Severn burst its banks. Millions of Britons are set for a for a New Year's Eve washout as parts of the UK brace for 75mph gales, flooding and even snow. Pictured: Flooding around Tewkesbury Abbey in Gloucestershire In England, there are currently 31 flood warnings, where flooding is expected, and 97 flood alerts, where flooding is possible The Met Office has issued a yellow wind warning for southern England and Wales from 11am tomorrow until 3am on Sunday; while rain warnings were activated for Wales from 10am and 6pm tomorrow and Northern Ireland between 4am and 11am tomorrow. A warning for sleet, snow and rain in Scotland was issued for Scotland tomorrow between 8am and midnight Huge parts of flood prone town of Tewkesbury in Gloucestershire have also been submerged by water as Britain continues to battle with unsettled weather. More flooding is expected in England over the next five days, especially in the West Midlands and Yorkshire and the Humber until Tuesday. Flooding is also possible across parts of the south west tomorrow and across the Midlands and the north tomorrow and Sunday. It comes as the Met Office issued a wind warning for southern England and Wales from 11am tomorrow until 3am on Sunday; while rain warnings were activated for Wales from 10am and 6pm tomorrow and Northern Ireland between 4am and 11am tomorrow. An active cold front will move east across England and Wales tomorrow and into Sunday which will widely bring gusts of 45 to 50mph, but some reaching 60mph and the strongest near coasts in the west and south with 65 to 75mph in places. Meteorologists expect flooding, power cuts and disruption to roads, trains, planes and ferries as well as delays for high-sided vehicles on exposed routes and bridges. Up to 50mm (2in) of rain could fall in North West Wales with 25mm (1in) quite widely elsewhere in the country, while Northern Ireland was told to brace for up to 25mm (1in) in a few hours with warnings that the downpours will fall on saturated ground. Separately, a warning for sleet, snow and rain in Scotland was issued for Scotland tomorrow between 8am and midnight, with up to 10cm (4in) of the white stuff across higher ground and 3cm (1.2in) even on lower ground as well as 25mm (1in) of rain. The Met Office said its Irish counterpart, Met Eireann, could name another storm - Storm Henk - after Storm Gerrit sparked days of travel chaos following Christmas. Rail operators told revellers to travel to parties today amid concerns over further disruption and staff shortages when severe weather strikes in the next two days - with one operator issuing a 'do not travel' alert for some routes on New Year's Eve. Low pressure will bring more wet and windy weather to the UK and warnings for heavy rain, strong winds and snow have been issued for this weekend The Met Office released a video of the low pressure coming in across the weekend, with the above forecast for New Year's Eve Storm Gerrit hammering the seafront at Porthcawl on the South Wales coast this morning Flooding around Tewkesbury Abbey in Gloucestershire today after heavy rain from the storm A Knottingley Canoe Club member makes their way down the River Ouse in flooded York today Northern, which runs 2,500 services through 500 stations daily, said customers with tickets for New Year's Eve could use them today or tomorrow to avoid disruption. The UK's second largest train operator issued a 'do not travel' warning for six routes with no service on New Year's Eve - including Morecambe or Heysham to Lancaster; Preston to Colne; Manchester Victoria to Chester; Manchester Piccadilly to Chester via Altrincham; Manchester Victoria to Stalybridge; and Clitheroe to Bolton. Travel continued to be affected by the storm today, with rail disruption in Wales and Scotland - while LNER cancelled some trains this morning due to staff shortages and other services faced speed restrictions due to a signalling fault north of Newcastle. CrossCountry was operating a reduced service due to a 'shortage of train crew'. Avanti West Coast passengers also faced further cancellations today after all London Euston trains were axed yesterday afternoon amid four separate incidents including a person being hit by a train, a points failure, a tree falling on the line and flooding. Other disruption today included on London Underground's Central and Circle lines due to train shortages and cancellations; Merseyrail due to a signalling fault; and on East Midlands Railway due to a broken down train at Grimsby. Southeastern was also delayed between Ebbsfleet and St Pancras due to a signalling issue. Earlier in the week, Greater Manchester Police declared a major incident after a supercell thunderstorm hit the Tameside town of Stalybridge. A tornado damaged 100 homes, sent trees toppling 'like dominoes' and wrote off cars as flying debris caused major structural damage while residents hid under their duvets. Elsewhere, three men died after their 4x4 vehicle was submerged in a river, near Glaisdale in North Yorkshire. The UK is set for a deluge as soon as tomorrow, with the Met Office issuing a yellow weather warning for rain and snow for much of Scotland. The warning is in place from 8am until midnight on Saturday with up to 25mm of rain forecast at lower levels. A period of sleet and snow, turning to rain, may lead to some flooding and travel disruption. Bus and train services may be affected, with journey times taking longer, with some spray and flooding on roads. Some interruption to power services is also likely. Hundreds of homes in Scotland remain without power as the post-storm clean-up continues, but electricity bosses are 'very confident' the remaining properties will be reconnected on Friday. Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) Distribution said that as of 4pm on Friday, electricity supplies had been successfully restored to more than 47,000 properties, with 250 still off supply. Andy Smith, operations director at SSEN Distribution, said on Friday: 'Our teams have continued to make excellent progress today in restoring customers impacted by Storm Gerrit, in the face of continued challenging conditions. People under umbrellas as they go for a punt on the River Cam in the Cambridge rain today Water is pumped out of a house in York this morning after the River Ouse burst its banks Tewkesbury Cricket Club's pavilion is surrounded by floodwater today following heavy rain 'We recognise this has been a difficult couple of days for the customers still affected and I'm grateful to them for their continued patience and support as our teams work extremely hard to restore power. 'Up to now we've targeted our restoration plan on repairing the faults that will reconnect the greatest number of customers and those who have been without power the longest. 'Today, we face a number of complex and very localised faults, and whilst we're still encountering some access challenges, we're pressing on to reconnect those final customers affected. 'I'd therefore like to reassure our customers that all our teams have been directed to these last few remaining areas of damage for this final push. 'Our established welfare policy is active, offering reimbursement for meals and accommodation, for those who're eligible, and we're speaking to our most vulnerable customers to offer them tailored support. 'Anyone who may need additional help or advice should contact our dedicated teams on the power cut helpline, 105.'

Andy Page, Met Office chief forecaster, said: 'Parts of the higher ground of Scotland may see temporary snow accumulations of 5-10cm (1-2in), while up to 25mm (just under 1in) of rain is expected in Wales, Northern Ireland and lower levels in Scotland. 'Across Wales and southern England, wind gusts of 45-50mph are likely to be quite widespread, while gusts of 65-75mph are possible in the most exposed coastal areas.'",
