    "text": "A message from Robert McMaster, Vice Dean, Research and Teresa Tsang, Associate Dean, Research, Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute.\nWe are pleased to announce the appointment of Dr. Shernaz Bamji and reappointment of Dr. Lynn Raymond as Co-Directors of the Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health (DMCBH) for a five-year term, effective to June 30, 2029.\nDr. Shernaz Bamji is a professor in the Department of Cellular and Physiological Sciences, and served as Associate Director of DMCBH since 2020. Her research is focused on understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying neural connectivity and synaptic plasticity. Her work has provided key insights into the fundamental mechanisms underlying learning and memory, as well as how these processes are disrupted in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders such as intellectual disabilities, schizophrenia, autism and Alzheimer’s disease.\nDr. Bamji was a founding member of the School of Biomedical Engineering, and previously served as President of the Canadian Association for Neuroscience. She currently sits on the Board of Brain Canada.\nDr. Lynn Raymond is a professor in the Department of Psychiatry, and has served as Director of DMCBH since 2020. She is also the Clinic Director of the Centre for Huntington Disease. As a clinician-scientist, she brings a unique perspective to her work on neurodegenerative diseases, bridging the gap between research and patient care. Her lab investigates the mechanisms that lead to Huntington disease, focusing on changes in brain circuits and glutamate receptor function.\nDr. Raymond previously served in leadership roles including on the DMCBH Executive Committee during the centre’s formative years, as Director of the UBC MD/PhD Program and as President of the Canadian Association for Neuroscience.\nOver the past four years, Drs. Raymond and Bamji’s combined expertise and collaborative leadership have helped DMCBH achieve significant milestones. Under their guidance, the centre created its first strategic plan, aligned closely with the strategic priorities of the Faculty of Medicine and Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute. They have also fostered increased interdisciplinary collaboration between researchers and clinicians through the formation of five integrated research programs, ultimately leading to more discoveries in the lab translating into real-world solutions for patients.\nTogether, Drs. Raymond and Bamji have demonstrated an unwavering commitment to the Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health’s vision of advancing brain health across the lifespan. With their continued leadership as Co-Directors, the Centre is poised to build on its world-class reputation as a hub for innovative research, education and patient care. Looking ahead, their vision for a future School of Neuroscience will further position UBC as a global leader in neuroscience.\nPlease join us in congratulating Drs. Raymond and Bamji on their appointment.",

    "text": "Naples residents warned of potential flooding As heavy rainfall is expected to hit Naples, city officials are urging residents to take precautions against potential flooding. With more than 7 and a half inches of rain expected in the coming days, the National Weather Service has issued a [ flood watch](https://www.abc-7.com/article/widespread-rain-brings-potential-for-flooding-in-swfl/60270239) effective Thursday until Saturday at 8 p.m. The Director of Public Works for the City of Naples, Bob Middleton, confirmed that crews were working on clearing out drains across the city. Middleton asked the public to help, if possible, by removing debris from inlet structures near their homes to facilitate drainage after the rain. Areas with poor drainage are particularly at risk of flooding, posing a threat to both property and public safety. City officials are advising residents to not drive through flooded areas to avoid potential damage to cars and lower risks associated with floating debris. Bill Runzel, a resident living along a canal near downtown Naples, recounted the devastation he witnessed during Hurricane Ian. \"We had the big surge come up the river and probably put 4 to 5 feet of water through here and wiped out anybody that wasn't above flood elevation,\" he said. While this weekend's rainfall is expected to be a fraction of what was experienced during the hurricane, Runzel and others living near bodies of water are urged to remain vigilant and prepared to take action in the event of flooding.",

File photo.\nImage: Presidency/X\nPrayers for the government, for peaceful polls and the IEC ahead of the May 29 elections.\nThis is what President Cyril Ramaphosa sought during a service at the Eagle church in Mangaung on Friday as part of the ANC's Easter campaign programme. He was speaking in his capacity as the party's president.\nThe campaign is aimed at “galvanising communities ahead of the 2024 elections”, according to the party, and will see the party's top brass attend services at various churches around the country.\nAddressing congregants at the 10am service Ramaphosa said: “We are here to say that we would like the church to pray to strengthen the work we are doing. The second part of what brings us here is that we should pray for peaceful elections.\n“Please pray for each political party taking part in the elections, that they may do so in a peaceful manner. [and] allow our people to exercise their choice in peace,” he said.\nRamaphosa, Putin discuss Ukraine war and Moscow terrorist attack Ramaphosa's office said the talks were around \"ongoing efforts in the search for a peaceful end to the conflict in Ukraine\". Politics 4 days ago Ramaphosa also reflected on the country's voting history, saying that while part of the population had enjoyed the right to vote for hundreds of years, the majority had to fight for the right for many years.\nThe third request Ramaphosa made to the church was to pray for the IEC so it could carry out “free, fair and independent elections”.\n“So we want the IEC to be at their best and to run the best election we've ever had because this is going to be a very complex election, with some 350 or so parties contesting it.\n“We would like the IEC to be strengthened so that they are able to break forth and leave no one behind.”\nTimesLIVE",
