The leaders alleged that 'the martyrs’ soil got defiled by the visit of Pandian to the place who is promoting beef consumption on Odisha Chief Minister’s directions'.\nScores of men and women from Sri Bairagi Sishu Mandir took out a rally and reached the Saheed Padia and sprinkled cow dung and turmeric water on the entire area.\nAlso Read:\nVHP demands investigation as row erupts over Kamiya Jani\n“The way VK Pandian took Kamiya Jani, who consumes and promotes beef, into Puri Srimandir and offered Maha Prasad is not acceptable. It is an attempt to defame Hindu culture. Mahila Morcha and others sprinkled the entire area here with cow dung to purify it. We urge everybody to come forward to save Jagannath culture,” said Bhadrak BJP Mahila Morcha leader, Kalpana Jena.\nResponding to the allegations made by the BJP, BJD leader Harekrushna Padhy said, “This shows the Opposition has become intolerant and is frustrated. The stadium where the meeting was held has been named after martyrs. Those who sprinkled cow dung water need to purify themselves first. The Opposition has nothing to do other than coming up with frivolous allegations and opposing the government.”\nAlso Read:\nIndira Gandhi could not enter Puri Srimandir, but Kamiya Jani could!

    "text": "--All CIT patients maintained platelet counts >75 x 10 9 /L at 1-week following chemotherapy plus a single dose of SCB-219M, with durable responses through at least 3-weeks--\n--Durable efficacy and PK profile expected to support convenient dosing interval of ≥2-weeks, compared to daily or weekly dosing for current treatment options in China [1] and globally [2] --\n--Phase Ⅰ b trial in CIT and CTIT (cancer treatment-induced thrombocytopenia) patients evaluating repeated dosing of SCB-219M is planned to initiate in 2024--\nCHENGDU, China , Dec. 28, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Clover Biopharmaceuticals, Ltd. (Clover; HKEX: 02197), a global commercial-stage biotechnology company, today announced positive preliminary safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics data in a Phase Ⅰ clinical trial evaluating SCB-219M, an innovative thrombopoietin receptor agonist (TPO-RA) mimetic bispecific Fc-fusion protein produced from CHO cells, for the treatment of cancer patients with chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia (CIT).\nAll cancer patients enrolled to-date (n=9) receiving chemotherapy plus a single subcutaneous dose of SCB-219M observed platelet counts maintained or recovered at >75 x 10 9 /L (threshold level for CIT) after one week, with responses durable through at least three weeks (i.e. through the chemotherapy cycle). In comparison, following administration of the same chemotherapy (but without SCB-219M) in the same cancer patients prior to enrolling into the trial, all evaluable patients had observed platelet counts drop to <75 x 10 9 /L between one and three weeks. The durable preliminary efficacy and pharmacokinetic profile observed for SCB-219M are potentially supportive of dosing intervals ≥2-weeks. If further confirmed, this profile could enable convenient dosing of SCB-219M synchronized with any given patient's chemotherapy regimen, typically 2-3 weeks per cycle. A favorable safety and tolerability profile for SCB-219M has also been observed to-date, with no serious adverse events (SAEs) and no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) identified.\nDr. Yongsheng Wang , Associate Director of West China Hospital Cancer Center at Sichuan University and Principal Investigator for the SCB-219M Phase Ⅰ Trial commented: \"We are encouraged by the Phase Ⅰ results to-date for SCB-219M, and we look forward to the continued evaluation of SCB-219M, as we believe the management of CIT remains a pressing unmet medical need for patients undergoing cancer treatment.\"\n\"We are pleased to announce positive Phase Ⅰ results for SCB-219M demonstrating rapid and durable efficacy along with a favorable safety profile,\" said Dr. Peng Liang , Chairman, Chief Scientific Officer of Clover and inventor of SCB-219M. \"The preliminary results suggest that SCB-219M has a potentially differentiated profile compared to the current standard of care treatments for CIT and CTIT. In contrast to current biologic treatment options for CIT in China requiring daily injections [1] and globally requiring weekly injections [2] , the durable efficacy and pharmacokinetics of SCB-219M observed to-date could enable convenient dosing synchronized with any given patient's chemotherapy regimen.\"\nThe Phase Ⅰ trial is a multi-center, open-label, dose escalation and dose expansion study, that is exploring the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of SCB-219M administered subcutaneously in cancer patients with CIT. In addition to West China Hospital Cancer Center at Sichuan University, other participating sites in this clinical trial include Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital and Chengdu No. 6 People's Hospital. A Phase Ⅰb trial evaluating repeated dosing of SCB-219M in CIT and CTIT patients is planned to initiate in 2024.\nCIT is a serious, chemotherapy-associated complication observed in a wide range of cancer patients. Incidence of CIT can occur in greater than 50% [3] of patients undergoing standard chemotherapy regiments, and can have detrimental impacts on treatment outcome, resulting in chemotherapy dose delay or dose reduction, and potentially fatal bleeding events.\n1.

    "title": "Terapia con intelligenza artificiale: colmare il divario in termini di salute mentale sul posto di lavoro",
    "text": "Sebbene i datori di lavoro prestino maggiore attenzione alla salute mentale dei dipendenti, possono sfruttare l’intelligenza artificiale per fare di più, scrive Sarah Poh di The Therapy Platform. Il lavoro influisce sulla nostra salute mentale. L'Organizzazione Mondiale della Sanità (OMS) ha dichiarato che il tema della Giornata Mondiale della Salute Mentale di quest'anno sarà “La salute mentale sul lavoro”. Al contrario, la salute mentale può incidere anche sul lavoro. Secondo l’OMS, la cattiva salute mentale costa all’economia globale quasi 1 trilione di dollari. Vi è una crescente enfasi sulla necessità di una migliore cura della salute mentale dei dipendenti. Singapore è tra i primi tre mercati del Sud-Est asiatico con i più alti livelli di burnout. Un altro studio ha rivelato che il 61% dei dipendenti di Singapore soffre di burnout. Sebbene i datori di lavoro stiano prestando maggiore attenzione al sostegno della salute mentale della propria forza lavoro, si può fare di più. Sebbene alcune organizzazioni offrano programmi di assistenza ai dipendenti (EAP), l'ambito e i servizi forniti possono variare. Di conseguenza, i dipendenti potrebbero non ricevere un supporto adeguato. L’intelligenza artificiale, che sta già migliorando numerose industrie, potrebbe svolgere un ruolo nel colmare questa lacuna. La terapia assistita dall’intelligenza artificiale risponde alla crescente domanda di assistenza sanitaria mentale, in un momento in cui non ci sono abbastanza professionisti della salute mentale. Più conveniente rispetto alla terapia tradizionale, la terapia assistita dall’intelligenza artificiale consente ai datori di lavoro di fornire un supporto più ampio ai propri dipendenti a costi finanziari inferiori. Man mano che le persone si abituano sempre più a interagire con i chatbot, milioni di persone cercano supporto terapeutico attraverso i chatbot terapeutici. Un chatbot terapeutico non è in alcun modo destinato a sostituire la terapia con un operatore sanitario. Niente può sostituire la presenza di un essere umano compassionevole e in sintonia con l’alleviare la sofferenza umana. Tuttavia, per molte persone, i chatbot terapeutici possono essere uno strumento accessibile per gestire la propria salute mentale. “La terapia assistita dall’intelligenza artificiale risponde alla crescente domanda di assistenza sanitaria mentale, in un momento in cui non ci sono abbastanza professionisti della salute mentale”. – Sarah Poh, CEO, La piattaforma terapeutica La natura dei chatbot consente loro di fornire formazione e supporto ai clienti in modo conversazionale. Raccogliendo il contesto dalle interazioni con i clienti, adattano i loro messaggi per allinearli alle preferenze, ai problemi e agli obiettivi di comunicazione specifici di un individuo. Ciò può aiutare i clienti a sentirsi più a proprio agio e coinvolti con un chatbot, portando a discussioni più aperte e migliori risultati terapeutici. Negli Stati Uniti, uno studio condotto su 1.200 utenti di un chatbot terapeutico ha rilevato che entro cinque giorni si è formata una “alleanza terapeutica” tra bot e utente. Gli utenti credevano che il bot non solo li apprezzasse e li rispettasse, ma che gli importasse. Ciò ha portato a sentimenti di “onestà, sicurezza e conforto” con il chatbot. A differenza dei terapisti umani, il chatbot AI è accessibile 24 ore su 24, 7 giorni su 7, fornendo supporto senza la necessità di appuntamenti o viaggi. Quando i clienti si presentano con un determinato problema o fattore di stress, il bot risponde come farebbe un vero terapista: ponendo domande, suggerendo meccanismi di coping, fissando obiettivi e offrendosi di ritenerli responsabili. Tra una sessione di terapia e l'altra, il chatbot può offrire consigli personalizzati e strategie di coping, come esercizi di respirazione, suggerimenti sul diario e parole di affermazione. Ironicamente, alcuni clienti potrebbero sentirsi più a loro agio nel condividere informazioni sensibili con il chatbot piuttosto che con un terapista umano. In uno studio condotto su 500 persone in terapia, oltre il 90% ha confessato di aver mentito al proprio terapeuta almeno una volta. Ma con un chatbot, i clienti si sentono autorizzati a dire quello che vogliono senza il timore di offendere o gravare su nessuno. Possono discutere in modo sicuro e anonimo dei loro momenti più bui senza paura del giudizio. Nonostante i loro vantaggi, i chatbot terapeutici non sostituiscono i veri terapisti. Non possono fare diagnosi o prescrivere farmaci e non sono tenuti agli stessi standard etici e legali degli operatori sanitari autorizzati. Ancora più importante, mancano dell’intelligenza emotiva e della comprensione sofisticata dei professionisti della salute mentale qualificati. Noi di The Therapy Platform consideriamo l'intelligenza artificiale come uno strumento utile per supportare il lavoro dei nostri terapisti, ma certamente non come un sostituto dei nostri terapisti. Riducendo il lavoro amministrativo del 90%, l'intelligenza artificiale libera il tempo dei nostri terapisti per concentrarsi sulla creazione di connessioni di qualità con i nostri clienti. Formato sulla terapia cognitivo comportamentale, una modalità di psicoterapia basata sull'evidenza, il nostro chatbot terapeutico spinge i clienti a identificare i loro modelli di pensiero e a suscitare riflessioni e prospettive mentre monitora i loro progressi nella salute mentale. Utilizzando i dati del chatbot, i nostri terapisti possono anche rilevare potenziali problemi prima che diventino più seri. Ciò supporta i nostri terapisti nella formulazione accurata del caso e nella progettazione di piani di trattamento più completi. Questo approccio basato sui dati non solo aiuta i nostri terapisti a essere aggiornati sugli stati mentali dei nostri clienti e sulla risposta alla terapia, ma può anche fornire ai datori di lavoro informazioni preziose sulla salute mentale dei loro dipendenti. Ai datori di lavoro che si iscrivono al nostro servizio come parte del loro EAP vengono forniti report con approfondimenti quantitativi basati sull'utilizzo del chatbot da parte dei dipendenti e report qualitativi sul loro benessere. Facciamo un ulteriore passo avanti progettando linee guida e programmi di coaching per leader e manager, basati sul input anonimo dei membri del team e sui risultati delle loro valutazioni della personalità. LEGGI DI PIÙ: Crescita dell'intelligenza artificiale a Singapore: un punto di svolta per la gestione dei talenti C’è una buona ragione per la crescente attenzione alla salute mentale sul posto di lavoro. Tra le crescenti tensioni geopolitiche, le crescenti incertezze e la rivoluzione dell’intelligenza artificiale che sta cambiando il futuro del lavoro, dire che i lavoratori sono stressati è un eufemismo. Le persone hanno la sensazione che le richieste lavorative poste loro spesso superino le loro risorse. In questi tempi, disporre di una risorsa terapeutica sotto forma di un chatbot intelligente che offre ascolto, consulenza personalizzata, sicurezza psicologica e disponibilità 24 ore su 24, 7 giorni su 7, può fare la differenza per la salute mentale dei dipendenti.

    "text": "AFP Evert y Navratilova rechazan la candidatura saudí para albergar el WTA Finals Leer todo el artículo AFP 25 de enero de 2024, 10:59 p. m. · 3 min de lectura Las leyendas del tenis femenino Chris Evert (izq) y Martina Navratilova rechazan la candidatura de Arabia Saudita para organizar el WTA Finals (ROSLAN RAHMAN)\nLas leyendas del tenis estadounidense Chris Evert y Martina Navratilova criticaron la candidatura de Arabia Saudita para organizar el WTA Finals, en un artículo de opinión publicado este jueves en el Washington Post.\n\"No ayudamos a construir el tenis femenino para que fuera explotado por Arabia Saudita\", es el título de la columna conjunta de las dos exjugadoras en la que expresan su malestar con los funcionarios del Tour femenino (WTA) por considerar la candidatura saudí de cara al torneo que al fin de la temporada reúne a las mejores jugadoras del circuito.\nEvert y Navratilova, que ganaron 18 títulos individuales de Grand Slam cada una y formaron parte de las tenistas fundaron en 1973 la gira mundial de la WTA, afirmaron que pusieron su corazón en construir una gira mundial \"basada en la igualdad para empoderar a las mujeres en un mundo dominado por hombres\". \"Ese trabajo ahora está en riesgo\".\n\"Los funcionarios del WTA Tour, sin una consulta adecuada con las jugadoras, que son la base del deporte, están a punto de aceptar organizar el WTA Finals en Arabia Saudita\", escribieron las jugadoras. \"Esto es totalmente incompatible con el espíritu y el propósito del tenis femenino y de la propia WTA”\n\"Apreciamos plenamente la importancia de respetar las diversas culturas y religiones. Es por esto, y no a pesar de ello, que nos oponemos a que el torneo más importante del circuito se otorgue a Riad\".\nEl WTA Finals es considerado el quinto torneo en importancia en el año del tenis femenino, sólo detrás de los Grand Slam.\nLas inversiones de Arabia Saudita en el deporte han sido criticadas como una estrategia para desviar la atención de cuestiones de derechos humanos en la nación.\n\"Los valores de la WTA contrastan fuertemente con los del anfitrión propuesto\", escribieron.\n\"No sólo es este un país donde las mujeres no son vistas como iguales, es un país donde el panorama actual incluye una ley de tutela masculina que esencialmente convierte a las mujeres en propiedad de los hombres. Un país que criminaliza a la comunidad LGBTQ hasta el punto de la posible muerte. Un país cuyo historial en materia de derechos humanos y libertades básicas ha preocupado a la comunidad internacional durante décadas”.\nContinuar leyendo la historia - \"Paso atrás\" -\nEn su firme alegato, las jugadoras afirmaron: \"Organizar allí la final de la WTA no representaría un progreso, sino una regresión significativa\".\nNavratilova y Evert, de 67 y 69 años, respectivamente, citaron la ley saudí que exige la tutela masculina para casarse y que las esposas deben obedecer a sus maridos en las decisiones domésticas importantes.\n\"No podemos sentarnos y permitir que algo tan importante como conceder un torneo a Arabia Saudita suceda sin una discusión abierta y honesta\", expresaron.\nAdemás de plantear su posición, ambas recomendaron que la junta directiva de la WTA, el torneo y el consejo de jugadoras lleven adelante una sesión abierta con presentaciones de expertos en derechos humanos a las tenistas.\nPropusieron debatir si organizar el torneo involucraría a las jugadoras en un acto de lavado deportivo \"simplemente por una afluencia de efectivo\".\nPidieron al WTA Tour que creara un marco de derechos humanos y lo instalara para proteger a jugadoras, fanáticos, patrocinadores, trabajadores y otras personas involucradas en el circuito.\n\"La WTA debería revisar los valores sobre los que se estableció. Creemos que esos valores ni siquiera pueden expresarse, y mucho menos lograrse, en Arabia Saudita. Organizar un torneo allí representaría un importante paso atrás, en detrimento no sólo del deporte femenino, sino de las mujeres.\"\njs/sev/gfe/dg\nMÁS POPULARES Revendedor de Costco intenta regresar roscas que no logró vender San Diego Red · 2 min de lectura ¿Quiénes son los favoritos para ganar las elecciones presidenciales en México 2024?

It mandates immediate notification upon arrival, detailed shipment information, and secure holding to prevent pest spread until inspection. The bill also strengthens labeling requirements and grants inspectors the authority to enforce quarantine and treatment protocols.\nSB3365: COMPREHENSIVE BIOSECURITY MEASURES\nSB3365 requires the mandatory distribution of state plant and animal declaration forms to passengers and crew arriving from outside Hawaiʻi. Visitors, returning residents, and crew will be allowed to submit their forms electronically while maintaining Hawaiʻi’s paper option.\nHB2298: PROTECTING HAWAIʻI-GROWN COFFEE\nThis legislation addresses deceptive labeling practices of Hawaiʻi-grown coffee. Effective July 1, 2027, the law prohibits the use of geographic origin names like “Kona” on coffee products unless they contain at least 51% coffee by weight from that origin. The bill mandates clear labeling requirements for coffee blends and strict enforcement to protect the integrity of Hawaiʻi-grown coffee brands.\nHB2278: ENHANCING MACADAMIA NUT LABELING TRANSPARENCY\nHB2278 increases transparency in macadamia nut labeling by requiring products containing nuts grown outside Hawaiʻi to disclose this fact on the label. It prohibits misleading “with Hawaiʻi-Grown” claims unless all macadamia nuts are sourced from Hawaiʻi, with stringent enforcement measures and penalties for violations.\nThe complete list of bills signed included the following:\nClick links to see full details of bills enacted into law.\nRELATING TO FARMERS\nRELATING TO VALUE-ADDED PRODUCTION\nRELATING TO AGRICULTURE\nRELATING TO REGULATION OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES\nRELATING TO CAMPS\nRELATING TO PESTICIDES\nRELATING TO INVASIVE SPECIES\nRELATING TO FERAL CHICKENS\nPhotos from today’s ceremony, courtesy Office of the Governor, will be uploaded\nhere.\nGovernor Green presented\nthis slide deck during today’s event.\nVideo of the event can be viewed\nhttps://fb.watch/t5GzJDn7OX/.\n# # #\nMedia Contacts:\nErika Engle\nPress Secretary\nOffice of the Governor, State of Hawai‘i\nOffice: 808-586-0120\nEmail:\n[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#503522393b317e353e373c35103831273139397e373f26)\nMakana McClellan\nDirector of Communications\nOffice of the Governor, State of Hawaiʻi\nCell: 808-265-0083\nEmail:\n[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e9848882888788c7848a8a858c85858887a981889e888080c78e869f)",

    "title": "Obama, Pelosi privately expressed concerns over Biden",
    "text": "(CNN) — Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi have spoken privately about Joe Biden and the future of his 2024 campaign. Both the former president and ex-speaker expressed concerns about how much harder they think it’s become for the president to beat Donald Trump. Neither is quite sure what to do. Democrats are desperate for the dispiriting infighting to end so they can get back to trying to beat the former president. And they’re begging either Obama or Pelosi to help them get there, aware that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer doesn’t have the trust of Biden and that House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries doesn’t have the depth of relationship to deliver the message. CNN spoke with more than a dozen members of Congress, operatives and multiple people in touch with both Obama and Pelosi, many of whom say that the end for Biden’s candidacy feels clear and at this point it’s just a matter of how it plays out, even after Thursday night’s news conference. And if those two feel otherwise, several leading Democrats say, they need to say that clearly as soon as possible before even more damage is done less than four months before the election. Many of Pelosi’s colleagues are hoping that she can bring an end to the turmoil that has engulfed Democrats for the last two weeks. And to a good chunk of them, that end can come if and when she tells Biden that he has to drop out. Pelosi has spoken to Biden since the debate, but in the time since, the California Democrat has made clear that she does not see Biden’s decision to stay in the race as final. But she, through an aide, declined to comment further. Obama’s decision not to make any public comment for two weeks has left a number of leading Democrats feeling like he has left them flailing by holding to the same posture that has largely defined his post-presidency. After the debate, he posted on X, “Bad debate nights happen. Trust me, I know,” reiterating that sentiment at a fundraiser in New York for House Democrats the night after Biden’s performance. The former president hadn’t even planned to make any public statement, but Biden and Obama aides coordinated to get that post out in a way that reflected Biden campaign talking points that Obama’s first reelection debate in 2012 went badly, too, and it didn’t end up ending his campaign. But Obama’s deepening skepticism about his friend’s ability to win reelection is one of the worst kept secrets in Washington. When the history of this extraordinary two-week period of American politics is written, the fingerprints of Obama and Pelosi will be far more apparent than currently known, people familiar with the matter tell CNN, as the Democratic elders have served as a guidepost for a party in panic. “They are watching and waiting for President Biden to reach a decision on his own,” one longtime Democrat close to all of them told CNN, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid being seen as disrespectful to Biden. The Biden campaign declined to comment. Obama has been fielding more calls than he’s making, people who have spoken to him say. When he does talk to anxious Democratic donors and officials, he’s been listening more than talking, carefully avoiding taking positions that he assumes would quickly leak. That was also Obama’s approach to the call he had with Biden after the debate, which the current president has suggested to others included the former president being supportive of him riding out the turmoil. According to others familiar with the call, though, Obama stuck to his posture of being a “sounding board and private counselor.” He prodded. He played devil’s advocate. But he did not take a position. In conversations with some Democrats over the past two weeks, Obama has swatted away the notion that he could push Biden one direction or the other even if he wanted to, which underscores their long-running complicated, yet loyal, relationship. And it’s been complicated even further during their time apart: since leaving office behind – and their weekly lunches at the White House for eight years – the two have spoken far less than some of their advisers have often intimated. If the former president did try to steer Biden to get out, people who know Obama say, he is aware the prism through which it could be seen. Biden has written that he felt Obama was not encouraging of his jumping in late to the Democratic primaries in the months after his son Beau died in 2015. Though Obama believes that he was trying to help his then-vice president focus on his grief and not wade into what would have been an incredibly hard primary campaign against Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, that may not be how another conversation would go. “Biden would say, ‘Well, Mr. President, you already used that chip in 2015 and it got us Donald Trump,’” speculated a longtime 2020 campaign aide. “I think it would harden him more.” Obama is also loathe to give Trump, who is forever triggered by him, any new material by getting actively involved. In the past — including during the 2020 Democratic primaries — Obama has seen his role as being the unifier who can help validate the direction of the party to whichever parts of the party remain skeptical. So far, he has not committed to having that role in the turmoil over whether Biden should remain the nominee, what happens if he stays, or what happens if he changes course and decides to go. “Well he’s known as no-drama Obama,” said Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, a Missouri Democrat. “So if there’s drama, then he’s the one to deal with it.” Obama’s hands-off approach — at least publicly — has been seen by some close to him as a way to keep his powder dry in case he needs to have a blunt, difficult conversation with Biden. “He is going to be all in for the Democratic ticket. No matter who our nominee is, he will be busting his a** helping to make sure that person wins in November,” said one person who speaks with Obama regularly. Obama has been at Biden’s side during two fundraising events this year, including at the Los Angeles event last month at which George Clooney would later acknowledge he was alarmed by how Biden carried himself. Biden woke up the day before the fundraiser — after several days of G-7 meetings — and had to fly overnight across five time zones to get there, because campaign co-chair Jeffrey Katzenberg was eager to do the Hollywood-themed event, and Clooney told the campaign there was only one day he was available, given his shooting schedule. Even on the way there, Obama questioned the thinking of putting any presidential candidate through the wringer of that kind of scheduling. “He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate,” Clooney wrote in an essay in The New York Times this week, imploring Biden to step aside. It was those words that infuriated some Biden loyalists, who suggested that Obama was behind Clooney’s op-ed. The former president, who is friendly with the actor, was aware that it was coming but did not try to stop it. To some Obama defenders, that was a way of preserving his neutrality, but to some Biden loyalists, it was a mark of deep betrayal. Obama was backstage and on stage with Biden for much longer than Clooney was. Others around at the time chalked up the shape the president was in to jet lag. The infamous video of Obama leading Biden off stage, people familiar say, was more a function of the former president wanting to leave. An Obama aide declined to comment and also declined to say whether his own assessment of Biden’s condition remained that it was about jet lag. Pelosi re-broke the dam As House Democrats left their private caucus meeting on Tuesday morning, many felt the worst might be over for the president. Most of the anti-Biden remarks at the meeting had come from members who had already called for him to go. Then Pelosi went on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on Wednesday morning for a long-scheduled appearance and took advantage of being on a show the president is known to watch to cast major doubt on his candidacy. Privately, she was telling colleagues to hold off on embarrassing Biden while the NATO leaders were in town. But even more Democrats took her comments as an open pass to issue their statements calling on Biden to step aside. Pelosi has known Biden for decades. She is older than him by three years. She has been one of his staunchest defenders, including through the 2020 primaries.
