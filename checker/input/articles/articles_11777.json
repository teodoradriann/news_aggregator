    "text": "O\nFlamengo\nnão desistiu e venceu o\nRed Bull Bragantino\n, por 2 a 1, de virada, na noite desta quarta-feira (23), no Estádio Municipal Cícero de Souza Marques, em Bragança Paulista, pela 16ª rodada do\nCampeonato Brasileiro\n.\nLucas Barbosa abriu o placar para o Massa Bruta logo aos 4 segundos do 2º tempo, mas Léo Pereira deixou tudo igual e Wesley garantiu a vitória rubro-negra no fim da partida.\nA vitória coloca o Flamengo na cola do líder\nCruzeiro\n, com\n33 pontos\ncontra\n34\ndos mineiros. Por outro lado, o Red Bull Bragantino perdeu a segunda seguida e estacionou nos\n27\n, na\nquarta colocação\n.\nTitular pela primeira vez desde o atrito com Filipe Luís, Pedro não conseguiu repetir a performance do Fla-Flu e teve uma atuação apagada no interior paulista.\nComo foi o jogo\nO início do Red Bull Bragantino surpreendeu o Flamengo. Foram duas chances antes dos cinco minutos. Henry Mosquera desarmou Varela e chutou pela linha de fundo, enquanto Lucas Barbosa recebeu cruzamento rasteiro e mandou na rede pelo lado de fora. A resposta rubro-negra veio na finalização de Bruno Henrique defendida por Cleiton.\nDepois de um começo movimentado, a partida caiu de ritmo e só foi ter emoção nos minutos finais. Vinicinho assustou Rossi em chute cruzado para fora e Jhon Jhon só não marcou um golaço de falta porque o goleiro do Flamengo desviou com as pontas dos dedos.\nFilipe Luís optou por não mexer no intervalo mesmo com uma atuação ruim no primeiro tempo e foi castigo logo aos oito segundos da etapa final. Na saída de bola, Jhon Jhon lançou Lucas Barbosa nas costas do improvisado Varela e o atacante só teve o trabalho de tocar na saída de Rossi.\nO Flamengo se lançou para o ataque e, depois de Arrascaeta assustar em chute para fora, Léo Pereira empatou aos 20 minutos. O zagueiro aproveitou falta cobrada pelo uruguaio e, dentro da pequena área, cabeceou para o gol. O Red Bull Bragantino sentiu e levou a virada.\nDe tanto insistir, o Flamengo marcou aos 39 minutos. Viña fez boa jogada individual e encontrou Wallace Yan, que ajeitou para Wesley chutar cruzado no cantinho de Cleiton.\nClassificação no Brasileirão:\n-\nRed Bull Bragantino: 4º colocado, com 27 pontos\n-\nFlamengo: 2º colocado, com 33 pontos\nPróximos jogos do Red Bull Bragantino:\n-\nFortaleza(F): 26/07, 18h30 (de Brasília) -Brasileirão -\nBotafogo(F): 29/07, 19h (de Brasília) -Copa do Brasil -\nAtlético-MG(F): 03/08, 18h30 (de Brasília) -Brasileirão\nPróximos jogos do Flamengo:\n-\nAtlético-MG(C): 27/07, 20h30 (de Brasília) -Brasileirão -\nAtlético-MG(C): 31/07, 21h30 (de Brasília) -Copa do Brasil -\nCeará(F): 03/08, 18h30 (de Brasília) -Brasileirão",

    "text": "Digital Media Pad prototype\nThe healthcare landscape is constantly evolving, demanding innovative solutions to address challenges faced by patients and medical professionals alike. In this pursuit of progress, health resources and strategy leader Ela Vashishtha has emerged as a pioneer, spearheading the development of a groundbreaking invention: the Digital Medical Pad.\nMore than just a technological innovation, this patented device embodies Ms. Vashishtha’s deep understanding of healthcare complexities, honed through her vast experience managing a $3 billion portfolio and driving data-driven initiatives across 25+ hospitals in her state of residency. This expertise shines through in every facet of the Digital Medical Pad, designed to address critical issues plaguing healthcare systems, particularly in resource-constrained settings.\nSecure Access, Streamlined Processes\nAt the heart of the invention lies a secure biometric scanner. Gone are the days of misplaced charts and stolen identities; fingerprints grant authorized personnel instant access to a patient’s medical history, ensuring both privacy and efficient care delivery.

This level of real-time decision support enhances diagnostic accuracy and optimizes treatment plans, paving the way for personalized, effective care.\nBridging the Global Healthcare Divide\nMs. Vashishtha’s vision extends beyond borders. Recognizing the immense potential of the Digital Medical Pad in resource-limited countries, she is leading the charge in adapting the technology for these specific contexts. The device’s affordability and portability make it ideal for rural areas, where access to quality healthcare has traditionally been limited. By eliminating paper records and cumbersome processes, the pad promises to revolutionize care delivery in underprivileged regions, democratizing access to crucial medical information and services.\nPartnerships for Progress\nThe journey towards widespread adoption of the Digital Medical Pad is underway. Ms. Vashishtha is actively seeking partnerships with multiple entities in India, aiming to pilot the device in rural areas and smaller cities.

    "text": "COLCHESTER, Conn. — The corned beef and cabbage is already being cooked at the Inishmor Pub in [Colchester](https://www.fox61.com/section/new-london-county). Now nearly a decade old, the Irish pub is looking forward to a Saint Patrick’s Day that falls on a Sunday in 2024 - and that will only help business. Owner and head chef Alex Levere said, “it’s super Sunday,” and added, “that’s the one day everyone wants to be in an Irish Pub – from 8 a.m. to probably 9 p.m. it’s full.” Levere, who trained as a chef in Ireland, said that corned beef and cabbage is king all week in Colchester, “this week (we will prepare) somewhere between 1,500 and 16,000 pounds, and for the month just over a ton.” Andrew Kyser, the bar manager at the Inishmor, said that Saint Patrick’s Day at the pub is, “the best chaos because it’s everyone you know – it’s friends and family that come in.” Having navigated the pitfalls of the pandemic, Levere said that this year feels different. “I would say last year was about recovery and coming out of COVID, it still didn’t feel as authentic as it should – this year is about celebrating. It’s about making memories and it’s about relationships,\" he said. After preparing a signature Shepards Pie, which is a crowd favorite, Levere added that Saint Patrick’s Day at the Inishmor “is the culmination of a year's worth of work.” To learn more about the Inishmor Pub in Colchester click [https://theinishmorpub.com/](https://theinishmorpub.com/).

    "text": "The Renewable Fuels Association today thanked a bipartisan group of 43 lawmakers in both houses of Congress who [sent a letter](https://d35t1syewk4d42.cloudfront.net/file/2658) to the Biden administration’s Sustainable Aviation Fuels Lifecycle Analysis Interagency Working Group, asking them to meet their March 1 deadline for updates to the GREET model and ensure the updates are based on sound science, current data, and methodologies that properly recognize modern practices in agriculture and biofuel production. “RFA applauds this bipartisan group of lawmakers led by Sens. Klobuchar, Thune and Duckworth, and Reps. Craig, Pocan, Johnson and Smith for pushing the Biden administration to ensure the proper implementation of sustainable aviation fuel tax credits,” said RFA President and CEO Geoff Cooper. \"We thank these lawmakers for urging the administration to utilize the best available science and data when determining eligibility for the SAF tax credit established in the Inflation Reduction Act. A transparent and scientifically sound approach is crucial to stimulating investment in domestic SAF production, fostering innovation and creating American jobs.\" The bicameral letter was led by Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), John Thune (R-SD) and Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), and Reps. Angie Craig (D-MN), Mark Pocan (D-WI), Dusty Johnson (R-SD) and Adrian Smith R-NE). “Biofuels drive economic growth, create good-paying manufacturing jobs and strengthen economies across rural America,” the lawmakers write. “As you continue to develop a model to determine eligibility, we ask that you take measures to permit every participant in the SAF lifecycle to appropriately participate in the carbon reduction process.”",
