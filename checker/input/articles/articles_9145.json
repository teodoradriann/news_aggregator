    "title": "Protest at Catholic girls school a sign of ‘deeper malaise’ in Northern Ireland",
    "text": "Ulster Violence/ Holy Cross Primary Schoo\nA loyalist protest at a Catholic girls school in north Belfast in 2001 was a sign of a “deeper malaise” in Northern Ireland according to Bertie Ahern, new archives show.\nOfficials who compiled documentation of efforts to resolve the protest also noted criticisms of DUP MP for Belfast North Nigel Dodds for his actions, and said that then First Minister David Trimble’s efforts were integral.\nFor months in 2001, locals at Holy Cross primary school in north Belfast stood outside the school as girls and parents walked in\nThe protest began following a clash in June 2001 as a man collected his child.\n“He was, according to nationalists, attacked by loyalists when he objected to them putting up paramilitary flags on the Ardoyne Road,” a briefing note stated.\nEfforts to resolve the issue over the summer break failed, and the protests resumed in the autumn.\nLoyalists said they were protesting because of attacks on their community, which they claimed were prompted by the larger Catholic population and wanted better security in the Ardoyne area as a result.\nThe note from November said: “The hate-filled aggression the loyalist protesters showed to the primary school girls and their families has disturbed, dismayed, and angered people throughout Northern Ireland and in the wider world beyond.”\nOn October 18 2001, Fr Aidan Troy had an hour-long meeting with Mr Ahern in which he discussed the impasse over the protest, which had been ongoing for months.\nFr Troy, parish priest of Ardoyne and chair of the board of governors of the Holy Cross school, said that there were around 20 people on both sides of the road in the morning, and 60-70 people on each side in the afternoon.\n“A hard core” of local residents took part in the protests and there was also a “sinister” loyalist paramilitary involvement, as well as people from other loyalist areas taking part, according to notes taken of the meeting.\nFr Troy said that some residents from Glenbryn, the protestant and loyalist area around the school, expressed support for his work, usually anonymously because of the “climate of fear” surrounding those who opposed the protest.\nHe said that some children and parents had been subjected to abuse including “balloons filled with dog excrement and urine, scalding water, stones and a blast-bomb”.\nA blast bomb attack had taken place the day before the meeting on Alliance Avenue.\nOf the 220 pupils at the school, 35 were stressed and receiving counselling and medication, and 10 had been transferred to other schools.\nThe priest expressed concern that the protest could “drag on indefinitely”, as it was a no-cost effort from protesters, and said this could put an “intolerable strain” on the school community.\nHe also said that there was “a leadership vacuum” in Glenbryn, which was an impediment to progress, and the referral to a committee of 14 people with “no common agenda” made it difficult to find a resolution.\nFr Troy also said that while he appreciated the work of police to protect children on the way to school, he was “unhappy” that protesters were allowed to be so close that they were able to “spit at the children” and was confused as to why armed soldiers faced towards the parents and children.\nMr Ahern said that the root causes of the protests were a “symptom of a deeper malaise within Northern Ireland”.\nHe offered to raise the issue during a meeting with the UK Prime Minister Tony Blair the next day, but said that genuine progress could only be achieved through engagement and agreement at local level.\nFergal Mythen, an Irish official in the Security Section of the Department of Foreign Affairs, compiled the notes of the meeting on October 22 2001.\nIn notes taken by the British Irish Intergovernmental Secretariat, dated November 21, it said Fr Troy was “reasonably confident” of an end or suspension to the protest ahead of a meeting with Mr Trimble and deputy first minister Mark Durkan.\nMr Dodds, who was to chair a meeting of residents at Stormont, was noted as a sign of a possible deal, as “Dodds has sat on the loyalist fence on may issues and is not known to stick his neck out unduly”.\nIn a briefing dated November 26, it called Mr Trimble and Mr Durkan’s meeting with Glenbryn residents the previous week, as well as a prompt follow-up letter “instrumental in creating the climate for a discontinuation of the protest”.\nThe material can be viewed in the National Archives in file 2023/53/67.\nFrom news to politics, travel to sport, culture to climate – The Independent has a host of free newsletters to suit your interests.

    "title": "Tony Finau joins three Masters champions in this unusual golf equipment accomplishment",
    "text": "Tony Finau helped Ping design a putter. His influence was so significant that his name is on the patent for it (along with John A. Solheim and Tony Serrano, Ping’s principal putter design engineer).\nWednesday at Augusta National, Serrano presented Finau with a plaque containing some of the patent details of the small-headed putter inspired from Finau’s penchant for putting with the toe of his putter out of the rough. (To be clear, this is not the putter Finau is using this week, it’s merely something he tinkers with during practice sessions.)\n/content/dam/images/golfdigest/fullset/2024/4/tony-finua-ping-putter-pld.jpg\nAlthough not exactly earth-shattering stuff, should Finau go on to win the Masters it would make him part of a club far more exclusive than those who merely don a green jacket. He would become just the fourth Masters winner to have his name on a patent—and the other three might surprise you. Well, at least two of them, at least.\nYou’re first thought is probably Ben Hogan, Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus. Logical but incorrect. While all three had their names attached to equipment companies, none have their name on a patent.\nGeorge Archer, Nick Faldo and Phil Mickelson are the ones who actually put pencil to paper and have their names on patents for golf-club patents.\nArcher was one of the best putters of his time and he said shortly after his Masters victory in 1969, “Holing pressure putts is not a matter of talent or divine inspiration. It’s a question of confidence.”\nGiven that statement, it’s not surprising Archer filed for, and was granted, a patent (number 5,135,229, assigned to Bullet Golf) for a “Golf Putter With Training Device,” on August 4, 1992. Archer, who was the lone inventor listed, had the idea to create a putter head with a pair of notches in the topline slightly more than a golf-ball width apart where tees could be placed (with the points aimed out from the face), thus creating a training aid for honing the stroke. By removing the tees, the training aid reverted back to a putter that could be used on the golf course. Bullet marketed the club in 1993-94.\nMore From Golf Digest Masters 2024 Masters 2024: Why Tony Finau is using two drivers Tech-Focused The SubAir system at Augusta National, explained Interactive A Comprehensive History Of Every Change Made To Augusta National Golf Club\nA little more than seven years later, on Oct. 26, 1999, patent number 5,971,866 for a “Wedge Type Golf Club Tri-Level Sole Configuration” was issued to four inventors, including Nicholas A. Faldo of Surrey, United Kingdom. The patent, assigned to Adams Golf, described the idea as a club where “The multi-level configuration includes three separate angular sole surfaces whereby the club may be placed [on the ground] at one of three different loft angle positions such that a first sole surface corresponds to a lower-lofted golf club, a second sole surface corresponds to an intermediate-lofted golf club and a third sole surface corresponds to a higher-lofted golf club.” In essence, make one wedge that could take the place of three—pitching wedge, gap wedge and lob wedge.\nAlthough that idea never came to fruition in the form of a product brought to retail, portions of the design were incorporated in the Faldo Series wedges that featured an “asymmetric” sole. The clubs debuted in 2001, and Faldo used the wedges at that year’s Masters.\nA Sept. 25, 2012 patent (No. 8,272,974 B2) was granted to Mickelson, et al, with Mickelson the lead name on the patent and Callaway Golf the assignee. The patent was for a “Hybrid Golf Club Head” that has a cutout in the rear sole area. As described in the patent, “A sole of the hybrid golf club head is relieved to allow for the face angle to open without the leading edge lifting too high.” Four years later, Mickelson’s name again was the lead one on patent No. US D767,057 S for a golf club head that was a wedge design also assigned to Callaway Golf.\nArcher won a green jacket. Faldo has two. Mickelson has three. That’s a progression that Finau would love to keep going.\nMORE GOLF DIGEST MASTERS COVERAGE\nMasters 101: Answering all your frequently asked question\nHow to watch the 2024 Masters\nPower Rankings: Every player in the Masters field, ranked\n50 defining Masters Moments, ranked\nThe bogey golfer’s guide to surviving Augusta National\n5 shots that players should NEVER hit at Augusta National\n15 people who ended up in the Masters penalty box\nThe most memorable Rules issues in Masters history\nIn search of the greatest Augusta National\nThe Masters’ other jackets: Why working tournament week has its perks\nThe greatest Masters round time has forgotten\nThe Champions Dinner Tell-All, from those inside the room\nTee times for Round 1 and Round 2",

    "text": "Poor Tennesseans need affordable meds. This bill ensures they can access them. | Opinion\nHB 1242/SB 1414 is a bill before the Tennessee General Assembly that can protect 340B and the ability of struggling Tennesseans to purchase affordable drugs.\n- Eight other states have passed similar laws to protect affordable drug pricing\n- All savings from affordable drug plans must be reinvested into patient care\n- This care may include pediatrics, dental care, and medication management for low-income and uninsured patients\nTennesseans already struggling to afford their prescriptions are now facing even bigger challenges. The 340B Drug Pricing Program, which helps provide affordable medications through safety-net providers, is under attack.\nIn recent years, drug companies have limited how the program uses contract pharmacies, making it harder for patients to get the medications and care they need.\nHouse Bill 1242 / Senate Bill 1414, a bill before the Tennessee General Assembly, aims to stop these harmful practices and protect 340B. If passed, Tennessee will join states like Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi in protecting patients' access to affordable medication.\nHere’s how 340B works: Drug companies agree to sell certain outpatient medications at a discount to safety-net providers, such as community health centers. In return, these companies receive Medicaid and Medicare payments. Providers then use the savings to make medications affordable and support critical services like pediatrics, dental care, and medication management for low-income and uninsured patients.\nContract pharmacies – including local pharmacies – are essential to this process. They help ensure patients receive their medications close to home. But drug companies are now restricting how these pharmacies can take part, cutting off access to life-saving medications and vital services for patients.\nAvoid higher medical costs for everyone\nThese restrictions hit rural and low-income communities the hardest, where community health centers and local pharmacies are often the only healthcare providers available. B\ny undermining the 340B program, drug manufacturers not only harm patients but also place added strain on pharmacies already navigating tight margins and rising costs.\nFor patients, this means they may go without needed care, leading to worsening health, more emergency room visits, and higher costs for everyone.\nHere's the reality: Protecting the 340B program is a win for both patients and Tennessee’s bottom line.\nUnlike many healthcare programs, 340B doesn’t use taxpayer dollars. And community health centers must reinvest all 340B savings into patient care. This helps lower prescription costs for patients and supports vital services, like OB care in rural areas, which might not survive otherwise.\nLegislature should choose people over profits\nPassing HB 1242 / SB 1414 will put patients first. To date, eight other states have already stepped up to protect their residents by passing similar laws. Tennessee lawmakers can – and must – do the same.\nPharmaceutical companies’ efforts to limit 340B are clear: They want to boost their profits, leaving our state’s most vulnerable patients struggling to obtain the care they need.\nThe question remains, when is enough, enough?\nIt’s time for Tennessee legislators to act. Pass HB 1242 / SB 1414 and protect access to affordable medications for the patients who need them most.\nEditor's note: The Senate version passed 27-5 and the House version passed 82-4, both on April 16.\nLibby Thurman, CEO of the Tennessee Primary Care Association, leverages more than a decade of expertise in health policy, advocacy, and strategic leadership to support Tennessee’s community health centers in improving healthcare access statewide.
