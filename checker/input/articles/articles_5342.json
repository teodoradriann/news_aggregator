    "text": "Following the passing of comedian and actor Richard Lewis at the age of 76, his friend and former castmate [Jamie Lee Curtis](https://clutchpoints.com/lindsay-lohan-jamie-lee-curtis-tease-freak-friday-reunion) took to Instagram to pay a heartfelt tribute to him. In her emotional post, Curtis revealed that Lewis played a pivotal role in her journey to sobriety, [crediting him with her milestone](https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/29/entertainment/jamie-lee-curtis-richard-lewis/index.html) achievement, CNN reports. “He also is the reason I am sober. He helped me. I am forever grateful for him for that act of grace alone.” Curtis shared that Lewis had reached out to her recently, expressing his hope for another boxed set release of their show “Anything but Love,” in which they starred together. She highlighted Lewis's instrumental support in her battle with addiction, stating that he was the reason she achieved sobriety. Curtis, who recently celebrated 25 years of being sober, acknowledged Lewis's own struggles with addiction, which he candidly addressed in his standup routines and memoir. Reflecting on their time working together on “Anything But Love,” Curtis reminisced about the chemistry between them during auditions. Despite the show initially facing challenges, the undeniable rapport between Curtis and Lewis led to a revamp of the pilot and the eventual creation of the series. Lewis's impact extended beyond his professional collaborations, as evidenced by the outpouring of tributes from colleagues and friends. Larry David, Lewis's co-star on “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” described him as “a brother,” emphasizing the deep bond they shared. The passing of Richard Lewis marks the end of an era in comedy, but his legacy lives on through the lives he touched, particularly through his support and influence on those battling addiction, like Jamie Lee Curtis.",

    "text": "Seven Tips for Keeping New Year’s Resolutions Camp Codger podcast reveals the keys to achieving New Year’s goals. Keeping New Year's resolutions is easy. Just follow these 7 tips. COLORADO SPRINGS, COLORADO, UNITED STATES, December 28, 2023 / [EINPresswire.com](https://www.einpresswire.com/)/ -- Millions of Americans make New Year’s resolutions every year. Many people resolve to lose weight, get new jobs, spend more quality time with families, and more. In fact, nearly 40 percent of adults make New Year’s resolutions every year. But how many people achieve their New Year’s goals? Not many. “Studies have shown that most people are really bad at keeping New Year’s resolutions,” said Randy Schultz, co-host of the Camp Codger podcast for seniors. “Most adults--about 64 percent— quit on their New Year’s resolutions by the end of January. And only 9 percent actually stick with it to achieve their goals.” On the most recent episode of the Camp Codger podcast, co-hosts Gary Ebersole, Richard Kipling, and Randy Schultz reveal the keys to achieving New Year’s resolutions. They share the 7 tips from the experts at UC Davis Health that can turn New Year’s goals into success, and they share their own personal success and failure experiences. Tip #1: Be Picky About Your Resolutions According to the experts at UC Davis Health, most people make too many New Year’s resolutions. Instead of listing six or 10 goals, pick one or maybe two. This will increase the odds of achieving a primary resolution, which is more productive than failing to achieve a long list of goals. Another tip from the experts is: Set very specific goals. That's because a less specific goal is difficult to put onto a To Do list. “Many of us set a New Year’s resolution such as ‘exercise more,’” said Schultz. “But the problem with that is it’s very hard to track. It’s better to pick a more detailed resolution like ‘exercise 30 minutes a day, five days a week.’ That’s a measurable goal that you can track, which will be far easier to achieve.\" Tip #6: Get a Resolution Buddy One of the tips that the three co-hosts of Camp Codger loved the most involved getting a resolution buddy who can help guarantee resolution success. Richard Kipling told the story of his resolution to walk around the Rose Bowl Stadium in Pasadena five days a week. He enlisted a like-minded friend, and they both resolved to walk around the Rose Bowl together—five mornings a week. “There were many mornings that I just didn’t feel like walking,” said Kipling. “But because of the promise I made to my friend, I got my butt out of the house and met him for our walk. Having a resolution buddy made it possible for both of us to achieve that goal.” To hear the entire list of 7 Tips to Keep Your New Year’s resolutions, listen to the Camp Codger episode on Apple Podcasts, Google, Spotify, Amazon, and other major podcast services. This episode is also available at [www.campcodger.com](http://www.campcodger.com)/podcast/new-years-resolutions-and-how-to-keep-them/ Rocking Chair Wisdom Every week, the Camp Codger podcast offers information, observations, advice, and a humorous look at life to people aged 60 or over. The weekly podcast is specifically designed to NOT appeal to the TikTok generation. All the podcast episodes are available at [www.campcodger.com](http://www.campcodger.com) and on the major podcast services. Camp Codger is the brainchild of three self-proclaimed “old guys” who realized that older Americans were being excluded from the content of most popular podcasts. Even though there are now 54.1 million Americans 65 years or older, the founders of Camp Codger say these folks are routinely forgotten by the media. “Camp Codger is a place in the podcast-o-sphere where listeners can reminisce, laugh, learn about new things, and help make their golden years productive and enjoyable,” said Gary Ebersole. “We liked the image of old friends sitting on the porch of a summer camp in the mountains, shooting the breeze and dispensing rocking chair wisdom.” That’s why the music that begins and ends each podcast episode is an instrumental version of the 1963 hit song by Allan Sherman called “Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh.” (If you don’t know that song, you might be too young for Camp Codger.)

    "text": "O Rio Ave recebeu e venceu este domingo o Portimonense, por 2-0, em jogo da 16.ª jornada da Liga; viu-se um duelo intenso, muito intenso...\nRio Ave e Portimonense não proporcionaram um jogo espectacular, mas foi muito intenso, do primeiro ao último minuto, e que deu gosto de ver.\nAs duas equipas chegaram a este duelo pressionadas pelos maus resultados (ambas chegavam com séries de cinco desafios consecutivos sem vitórias) e pela necessidade de fuga aos lugares de despromoção.\nAs táticas encaixaram uma na outra e, durante a primeira parte, correram-se poucos riscos. À exceção de um remate perigoso do algarvio Gonçalo Costa , que Jhonatan defendeu, não foram criadas mais oportunidades de golo. Mas mesmo assim as equipas jogaram bem, de pé para pé, com inteligência e sem sofreguidão.\nDepois do intervalo viu-se mais Rio Ave , próximo de zonas de finalização. Um sinal mais que, ainda assim, nunca foi muito claro, porque o Portimonense ia equilibrando na sensação de perigo, mostrava-se mais forte defensivamente, e foi tendo, também, os seus momentos de domínio num jogo que foi mesmo marcado por grande equilíbrio.\nMas foi, efetivamente, o Rio Ave que começou a mostrar maior acutilância no ataque à profundidade e foi dessa forma que Boateng foi aparecendo com maior frequência, depois de primeiros 45 minutos muito discretos. O avançado, depois de um remate bloqueado a Costinha , emendou para golo, numa altura em que as duas formações novamente se olhavam nos olhos.\nA partir desta altura o jogo ficou mais partido, o Portimonense precisou de correr mais riscos (e poderia ter empatado não fossem boas intervenções de Jhonatan) e o Rio Ave, com espaço para fazer transições rápidas no contra-ataque, sentiu-se mais confortável. Luís Freire mexeu bem e mexeu com felicidade: Zé Manuel não só trouxe qualidade ao centro como matou o jogo com o segundo golo.",

    "text": "Tres personas sospechosas de preparar atentados contra iglesias y sinagogas en Turquía han sido detenidas dentro de una operación donde han sido arrestadas también otras 29 que se cree tienen contactos con círculos yihadistas y estaban implicados en esos planes. Una operación simultánea en nueve provincias turcas, coordinada por la policía junto a los servicios secretos (MIT), permitió detener a esas tres personas, supuestamente dirigentes de las redes del grupo yihadista Estado Islámico, o Daesh, en Turquía, informa este viernes la agencia oficialista Anadolu. La emisora pública turca TRT los identifica como Miybel el Shuweihi y Mohamed Hilaf Ibrahim, conocido como Abu Leis, sospechosos de preparar atentados contra sinagogas e iglesias en Turquía. El tercero sería Iheb Alani, que se cree estaba coordinando un ataque contra la embajada iraquí en Turquía, agrega la citada emisora. Además, las fuerzas de seguridad han detenido a otras 29 personas sospechosas de estar vinculadas a las redes yihadistas en Turquía. Hace una semana, la Policía detuvo a 304 personas bajo sospecha de mantener lazos con las células del Estado Islámico. Desde el atentado contra la discoteca Reina en Estambul en la Nochevieja de 2016, en la que un yihadista mató con un arma automática a 39 personas, las autoridades turca extreman la vigilancia en estas fechas. Aunque la Nochevieja se celebra popularmente en Turquía y no falta decoración navideña, algunos predicadores radicales se han pronunciado contra estas festividades por \"cristianas\" o \"paganas\". Desde el atentado contra el Reina, Turquía, que en 2016-2017 llevó a cabo una operación militar contra el Estado Islámico en el norte de Siria, no ha vuelto a sufrir atentados atribuidos al yihadismo.

    "text": "(CNN) — A former Mississippi police officer was sentenced to a year in federal prison followed by a year of supervised release along with fines and assessments for forcing a man who he arrested to lick urine off the holding cell floor.\nMichael Christian Green was sentenced to the maximum penalty for a federal misdemeanor for acting under color of law to deprive a person of their civil rights. The former Pearl Police Department officer\nplead guilty in March and is scheduled to report to the Federal Bureau of Prisons on July 26.\nGreen worked for the Pearl Police Department for six months after working at other law enforcement agencies in Jackson, Mississippi. Pearl is in the same county where\nsix White former law enforcement officers, some of whom called themselves the “Goon Squad,” were sentenced on federal and state charges after pleading guilty to a racist assault on two innocent Black men.\nGreen responded to a disturbance at a Sam’s Club on December 23, 2023, and arrested a man, according to the complaint. Once the man was booked, security footage from the holding cell showed him trying to tell Green he needed to urinate, the federal prosecutor wrote in the complaint. After not receiving a response, the man urinated in a corner. When Green was later told about the urine, he demanded the arrestee lick the urine, threatening to beat him with a phone, the complaint said.\nWhile standing in the doorway of the holding cell, Green commanded the man to get on the ground and “suck it up,” according to the complaint, then “removed his phone from his duty vest and filmed” the man, who complied. Green resigned on December 27.\nGreen testified in federal court during his sentencing hearing and took responsibility for his actions and said he regrets what he did.\nCNN reached out to Green’s attorney for comment.\n“The City of Pearl, while not the sentencing body on this case, is glad to have this part of our recent history put behind us,” the municipality said in a statement. “The actions of Michael Green were reprehensible and inexcusable, and we have been deeply grieved to have been associated with this incident. We hope that this sentencing can help the victim and his family in their healing process, and we’re grateful to our federal partners who helped bring this terrible incident to justice swiftly.”\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

    "text": "She’ll have the eggplant. Women who switch to vegan diets see their libido levels increase by up to 383%, researchers from Stanford University have determined. The frisky, cruelty-free findings are revealed in the new Netflix docuseries, “You Are What You Eat,” which tracks 22 sets of identical twins who adopt plant-based eating habits for eight weeks. The participants underwent a variety of scientific experiments to explore how certain foods can impact the body, with two sets of female twins having their libido levels measured while watching porn . “Not only did this study provide a groundbreaking way to assert that a vegan diet is healthier than the conventional omnivore diet, but the twins were also a riot to work with,” Christopher Gardern, PhD, declared in a press release about the experiments. To examine any impact to libido levels, two sets of twins, Pam and Wendy and Carolyn and Rosalyn, were asked to watch a variety of different videos while lab equipment was used to measure the temperature of their genitals. The temperature levels are a known marker of sexual arousal. The women were first required to watch a documentary on birds to assess their baseline measurements. They were subsequently asked to watch some porn of their own choosing. The experiment was conducted before the four women switched to a vegan diet. The experiment was subsequently repeated eight weeks later to see whether the plant-based diets had made any impact on their sex drives. Shockingly, all four of the women’s libido levels surged. Pam saw a staggering 371% increase in arousal, while twin sister Carolyn was also 288% hornier eight weeks into her vegan diet plan. Meanwhile, Carolyn’s arousal levels surged 383%, while her identical twin Rosalyn experienced a 212% hike. Stanford scientists did not declare how, exactly, a vegan diet could cause a drastic increase in arousal, but theorized that nutrients in vegetables helped improve blood flow to the genitals. It remains to be seen whether a vegan diet has the same sexed-up impact on men. If it does, it may prompt many males to re-assess stereotypes about veganism. A recent study found fewer men are adopting vegan diets because they don’t think the lifestyle is “manly” enough.",
