    "title": "‘Denied access’ to Jamia Masjid on Fridays, Mirwaiz urges J&K L-G govt. to relook policy of ‘detention’ - The Hindu",
    "text": "Hurriyat chairman and Kashmir’s chief cleric Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, who was allowed to attend Friday prayers at Srinagar’s Jamia Masjid only thrice since 2019 in September, has urged the J&K Lieutenant Governor’s administration to “relook the policy of detention and restore his religious rights” by granting access to the mosque on Fridays.\n“I believe that repression of any kind, including on religious rights, cannot bring or maintain peace. Those in-charge of decision-making should revisit this policy, considering historical precedents and adopting a long-term perspective,” Mr. Farooq said.\nHe accused the L-G administration of disallowing him to leave his residence in Srinagar’s Nigeen area on Fridays. “There is no reason provided by the authorities for the move,” Mr. Farooq told The Hindu .\n“It’s painful to stay away from the pulpit of the mosque as a religious leader. I have the religious obligation to deliver sermons and hundreds of worshippers wait for it. The move is an assault on the institution of the Mirwaiz,” he added.\nEarlier this year, Mr. Farooq was allowed to deliver his customary sermons at the Jamia Masjid, Srinagar, for three Fridays in September. It was for the first time since he was put under house arrest in 2019, when the Centre ended J&K’s special Constitutional position.\nSecurity agencies, worried about the possible fallout of the current Israel-Palestine conflict, again decided to disallow Friday prayers at the 600-year-old mosque in the old city. In the past two weeks, however, Friday prayers have been allowed but Mr. Farooq remain barred from attending or leading it.\nMr. Farooq said the authorities whimsically open or close the central Jamia Masjid to Muslims for prayers without accountability. “No one can inquire why,” he added.\nHe said these actions were telling signs of the time and situation we live in. “It also mocks the authorities’ own statements claiming things were fine in J&K and ‘I am a free man, who can go anywhere’,” Mr. Farooq said.\nMr. Farooq knocked on the doors of the J&K High Court over his house detention in September this year. However, the L-G administration has failed to file its reply in the case. The court has granted the last week of December as the deadline to the administration to file its reply in the case.\nCOMMents\nSHARE\nCopy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",

    "title": "Boeing workers going on strike after 96% vote for walkout",
    "text": "SEATTLE (Sept 13): Boeing's US West Coast factory workers will walk off the job after 96% voted on Thursday in favour of a strike, halting production of the planemaker's strongest-selling jet as it wrestles with chronic output delays and mounting debt.\nThe workers' first strike since 2008 will start at midnight Pacific time (0700 GMT) as Friday begins, just weeks after new chief executive officer Kelly Ortberg was brought on in August to restore faith in the planemaker after a door panel blew off a near-new 737 MAX jet in mid-air in January.\nRoughly 30,000 workers who produce Boeing's 737 MAX and other jets in the Seattle and Portland areas voted on their first full contract in 16 years.\nInternational Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) members voted 96% in favour of striking and 94.6% to reject the agreement.\n\"This is about respect, this is about addressing the past, and this is about fighting for our future,\" said Jon Holden, who headed the negotiations for IAM, Boeing's largest union, before announcing the vote result.\n\"We strike at midnight,\" he said, as members in the union hall cheered and chanted: \"Strike! Strike! Strike!\"\nBoeing said late on Thursday the vote sent a clear message that the tentative deal it had reached with IAM leadership was not acceptable to members.\n\"We remain committed to resetting our relationship with our employees and the union, and we are ready to get back to the table to reach a new agreement,\" the planemaker said in a statement.\nThe deal included a general wage increase of 25%, a US$3,000 (RM12,948) signing bonus and a pledge to build Boeing's next commercial jet in the Seattle area, provided the program was launched within the four years of the contract.\nAlthough IAM leadership recommended last Sunday that its members accept the contract, many workers had responded angrily, arguing for the originally demanded 40% pay rise and lamenting the loss of an annual bonus.\n\"We're going to get back to the table as quickly as we can,\" Holden told reporters, without saying how long he thought the strike would last or when talks would resume. \"This is something that we take one day at a time, one week at a time.”\nWorkers have been protesting all week in Boeing factories in the Seattle area that assemble Boeing's MAX, 777 and 767 jets.\nBoeing shares closed up 0.9% on Thursday before the vote results were announced but are down 36% this year on concerns over safety, production and a US$60 billion debt burden.\nThe duration of the walkout is not clear. A long strike would weigh not only on Boeing's financials, but on airlines that depend on the planemaker’s jets and suppliers who manufacture parts and components for its aircraft.\nAccording to a pre-vote note from TD Cowen, a 50-day strike could cost Boeing an estimated US$3 billion to US$3.5 billion of cash flow.\nThe Boeing workers' last strike in 2008 shuttered plants for 52 days and hit revenue by an estimated US$100 million per day.\nS&P Global Ratings said that an extended strike could delay the planemaker's recovery and hurt its overall rating. Both S&P and Moody's rate Boeing one notch above junk status.\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nUploaded by Chng Shear Lane",

    "text": "Related video: Gloriavale's bid to bring in foreign workers labelled 'bizarre and extraordinary' Credits: Image - Getty Images; Video - Newshub\nThis story discusses details of sexual abuse.\nBy Amy Williams of RNZ\nFormer members of a secretive sect under investigation by the FBI for historical child sexual abuse warn it is a highly controlling and insular group with many unwritten rules.\nThe religious group has about 2500 members and 60 ministers in New Zealand, meets in homes and has no official name but is commonly known as Two by Twos or The Truth.\nMore from Newshub\nGloriavale seeks accredited employer status\nFormer member of Auckland-based South Korean doomsday cult warns of its fraudulent recruitment methods Its spokesperson has confirmed police here are investigating at least one former minister for historical abuse and it is aware of 14 cases of allegations against members.\nThe sect is not registered as a charity, it has no buildings and members are encouraged to tick 'Christian non-denominational' on the census.\nElliot* recently left the church because of the way historical child abuse allegations were handled.\n\"In your article was more information than we'd ever been given as a church. I was concerned about the lack of accountability.\n\"There hasn't been a public spoken apology to the church from the workers, the ministers, to say these things have been handled really incorrectly in the past that has caused harm and we're sorry for the harm it's caused.\"\nElliot joined as a teenager and said the rules are subtle - you're not saved if you don't attend the sect's meetings in homes and hired halls, marrying an outsider is frowned upon, females have a dress code, TVs are not allowed and using the internet is actively discouraged.\"\nSarah* grew up in the sect, her parents were born into it too, but she left the church when she moved cities to attend university.\n\"I always felt very restricted by the very strict rules. There's a phrase they use which is 'be in the world but not of the world' so you're not meant to have school friends. I felt like I was living in these two really different worlds and I couldn't marry them up.\"\nThe sect's ministers travel in pairs within an area or region, staying in members' homes.\nThe church spokeperson Wayne Dean confirmed these ministers were police vetted and trained in keeping children safe, members were encouraged to report any abuse to police and any alleged offender is stood down from attending meetings pending investigation.\nSarah said that is not enough - she said the trust given to these ministers, also called Workers, creates a power imbalance.\n\"There's a culture of understanding that you don't go to the police to sort out any internal issues. If there had been any problematic behaviour before then the police wouldn't have probably been involved,\" she said.\n\"I was left alone with Workers my whole life when they were staying in my house, in their bedrooms. Nothing ever happened to me but I can absolutely see how it can happen. They are the most senior people.\"\nShe is concerned the secretive nature of the sect would make reporting any abuse difficult.\n\"I've seen another resurgence of people leaving, from what I understand promises were made that things were going to change and they haven't seen that come to be,\" Sarah said.\nAnother former insider said their family has been in the church for generations, but they left shortly after coming out as gay.\nThey were in contact with family still in the sect but are ignored by others.\n\"I feel like I have been shunned in a way. I'd see people I knew from growing up in the religion and they would just ignore me. To them I don't exist any more, these are people that I have known my whole life.\"\nReligious studies expert and Massey University professor emeritus of history Peter Lineham said former insiders he had talked to told him the sect is in crisis.\n\"What they seem to be implying is that there's been quite a big exodus of members over recent years. I think there's been much more public talk about the risks and dangers of secterian groups and a vulnerability of people within those groups.\"\nThe church keeps a low profile and Lineham said its response to RNZ, confirming a police investigation, was a \"striking development\".\n\"The 2x2s have kept such a low profile for so many years that in fact most people have never heard of them. With this sudden exposure I think it maybe has created a bit of a crisis.\"\nThe abuse scandal overseas The lid was lifted on the scale of historical child sexual abuse within the sect after the leader of its church in the US state of Oregon, Dean Bruer, died in 2022.\nAn internal letter by his successor stating that Bruer was a \"sexual predator\" whose actions included \"rape and abuse of underage victims\" was leaked on social media, then shared to a website set up for victims of the abuse within the group.\nTwo women set up a hotline just over a year ago, and the floodgates opened - their February update said more than 1500 victims had come forward from around the world.\nThe sect, founded in Ireland in 1897, is believed to have 100,000 members worldwide, most in North America.\nOne of the former insiders RNZ spoke to for this story said they had spent time in South East Asia with their family, as missionaries.\nAnother said the ministers would travel overseas to attend conventions, and foreign ministers would also travel to New Zealand to speak at the annual gatherings.\nThe FBI declined to comment on whether it had alerted police in New Zealand to its investigation of the 2x2s sect, launched in February.\nIts Omaha Field Office said it was seeking the public's help in identifying victims or individuals with knowledge of abuse and/or criminal behaviour that had occurred within a religious group that traditionally has not had a name.\n\"The group has often been referred to by others outside of the group as \"2x2,\" \"The Way,\" \"The Truth,\" and \"The Church With No Name,\" among others,\" the FBI said.\n\"While it is natural for parents to want to gain a better understanding of the potential exploitation of their child, further questioning of the child may lead to inaccurate statements and increased emotional trauma.\"\nThe FBI asked people with information to fill out a short questionnaire.\n* Former insiders talked to RNZ about the group's secretive culture on condition of anonymity - these are not their names.\nWhere to get help: Sexual Violence\nNZ Police\nVictim Support 0800 842 846\nRape Crisis 0800 88 33 00\nRape Prevention Education\nEmpowerment Trust\nHELP Call 24/7 (Akld): 09 623 1700, (Wgtn): 04 801 6655 - push 0 at the menu\nSafe to talk: a 24/7 confidential helpline for survivors, support people and those with harmful sexual behaviour : 0800 044 334\nMale Survivors Aotearoa\nSurvivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP) 022 344 0496\nFamily Violence\nWomen's Refuge : 0800 733 843\nIt's Not OK 0800 456 450\nShine : 0508 744 633\nVictim Support : 0800 842 846\nHELP Call 24/7 (Auckland): 09 623 1700, (Wellington): 04 801 6655 - push 0 at the menu\nThe National Network of Family Violence Services NZ has information on specialist family violence agencies.\nAbuse survivors\nFor male survivors:\nRoad Forward Trust, Wellington, contact Richard 021 1181043\nBetter Blokes Auckland, 09 990 2553\nThe Canterbury Men's Centre, 03 377 6747\nThe Male Room, Nelson 03 548 0403\nMale Survivors, Waikato 07 858 4112\nMale Survivors, Otago 0211064598\nFor female survivors:\nHelp Wellington, 04 801 6655\nHelp, Auckland 09 623 1296\nFor urgent help: Safe To Talk 0800 044 334.",
