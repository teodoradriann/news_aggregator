    "text": "Nafiz Modack has pleaded not guilty to policeman Charl Kinnear’s assassination, claiming police officers are behind the detective’s murder.\n‘Cops killed Kinnear and I have proof’, Nafiz Modack tells high court\nThe trial resulting from cop Charl Kinnear’s September 2020 assassination outside his Cape Town home has already taken a dramatic turn on day four of proceedings.\nIn the run-up to the trial, it has been highly anticipated that several accusations against, and from, current and former South African Police Service (SAPS) members will surface as the trial progresses.\nkinnear modack kilian\nNafiz Modack (left) and co-accused Zane Kilian appear in the Western Cape High Court in Cape Town during preliminary hearings on 29 January 2024. (Photo: Gallo Images / Die Burger / Jaco Marais\nThis turned out to be the case on Thursday, 1 February, when Nafiz Modack pleaded not guilty to killing Kinnear and told the court: “The police murdered Kinnear. I have the evidence.”\nIt is not the first time Modack has effectively claimed police officers are corrupt.\nIn the trial, he does not yet have legal representation because he wants the State to appoint him lawyers of his choice via the legal aid service, which is not how that system works.\nSo, when Modack began explaining on Thursday why he was pleading not guilty to Kinnear’s murder, Judge Robert Henney warned him that he needed to exercise caution.\nModack, though, told Henney he was intent on providing a plea explanation.\n“I want to take my own advice and provide this court with an explanation,” he said.\nBut Henney did not allow him to continue, saying Modack should use the time during a break to reflect on his decision.\nkinnear modack\nNafiz Modack in the Western Cape High Court on 29 January 2024. (Photo: Gallo Images / Die Burger / Jaco Marais)\nAfter the break, when court resumed, Modack seemed to follow what Henney advised and did not provide a further plea explanation.\nSections of the indictment in the case focused on the illegal monitoring of cellphones.\nWidespread ‘pinging’ It was alleged that Modack and the co-accused unlawfully intercepted the mobile devices of, among others, Kinnear, alleged 28s gang boss Ralph Stanfield, as well as City of Cape Town safety and security mayoral committee member JP Smith.\nThis allegedly happened during the period of 6 March to 17 September 2020.\nModack and 14 co-accused are collectively facing 124 criminal charges in the trial.\nThese link to murders, attempted killings, corruption, gangsterism and communication interception.\nThe most pivotal charges relate to Kinnear’s assassination.\nHe was shot outside his Bishop Lavis home in Cape Town on 18 September 2020.\nhttps://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2023-09-18-charl-kinnear-killing-3-years-of-controversty-no-accountability/\nAt the time, Kinnear was investigating several organised crime matters, as well as police colleagues.\nModack was among the suspects he had been investigating.\n‘Biased and corrupt’ He has previously taken legal action against SAPS officers, Kinnear included, in the very court in which he is now standing trial.\nIn May last year, it emerged Modack was unsuccessful in an attempt to have the Western Cape High Court order some cops to stop taking certain action against him — by that point, though, he was already in custody for Kinnear’s murder and other crimes.\nThe May 2023 judgment in that case detailed some of what Modack alleged against a group of cops who were involved in investigating him.\n“Several members of the … SAPS … including high-ranking officers, attached to different units of SAPS, have been harassing [him] whilst he has lawfully been acting as a consultant to certain security businesses, and whilst he has been in lawful possession of firearms,” it stated.\n“[Modack] has been liaising and co-operating with other members of SAPS, including high-ranking officers in Cape Town, Johannesburg and the Northern Cape.\n“In his interaction with those members of SAPS it has become clear that some of the [cops] are biased, and that others are corrupt.”\nExtortion and nightclubs However, the cops Modack tried to block from taking certain action against him, countered what he claimed.\n“Far from being singled out as alleged, [Modack] was, and is, just one of several parties involved in, or suspected to be involved in, the extortion and intimidation of businesses, particularly restaurants, pubs and nightclubs,” the judgment said, outlining the police’s version of events.\n“This state of affairs has given rise to a spate of violence, including murders. [Modack] was also one of thousands of suspects nationwide involved in fraud on a grand scale relating to the unlawful issuing of firearms licences.”\nGuns and licences Kinnear, at the time of his murder, had been involved in investigating fellow police officers in Gauteng – they allegedly created fraudulent firearm licences for suspects.\nThis matter culminated in arrests.\nIn June 2020, three months before Kinnear was murdered, the SAPS announced that a group of suspects, including Modack and several serving and former Gauteng cops, were detained in connection with fraudulent firearm licences.\nThat case was provisionally withdrawn last year.\nThere has been a high SAPS presence in and outside the court for the Kinnear assassination trial.\nEarlier this week Henney asked police officers with firearms, stationed in the courtroom, to move as he was uncomfortable with their presence.\nThe trial is expected to resume on Monday.

Assistant coach Andy Spence will lead the women's squad for the rest of the Paris games. The scandal has cast a shadow over the team's Olympic endeavors. [Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| Updated: 26-07-2024 05:38 IST | Created: 26-07-2024 05:38 IST The Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) removed head coach Bev Priestman on Thursday following her suspension by Canada Soccer over a drone spying scandal that has thrust the 2020 Olympic gold medallists into an unsavory global spotlight. The Canadian women's squad will be led by assistant coach Andy Spence for the remainder of the Paris games, the COC said. \"Over the past 24 hours, additional information has come to our attention regarding previous drone use against opponents, predating the Paris 2024 Olympic Games,\" Canada Soccer CEO & General Secretary Kevin Blue said in an emailed statement. \"In light of these new revelations, Canada Soccer has made the decision to suspend Women's National Team Head Coach, Bev Priestman for the remainder of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, and until the completion of our recently announced independent external review.\" Canada defeated New Zealand 2-1 in their Paris Olympics opening game on Thursday, a match which Priestman voluntarily sat out after the spying scandal broke this week. Priestman apologized to the New Zealand players for what had happened and said ultimate responsibility lay with her. \"This does not represent the values that our team stands for. I am ultimately responsible for conduct in our program.\" (With inputs from agencies.)",

    "text": "Mortágua convida 800 mil trabalhadores por turnos a assinar petição para mudar lei\nA coordenadora do Bloco de Esquerda convidou hoje os cerca de 800 mil trabalhadores por turnos em Portugal a assinarem uma petição para melhorar na lei as suas condições laborais.\n\"Deixo aqui esta proposta, este apelo, uma petição para juntar toda a gente que trabalha por turnos. Uma petição para juntar 800 mil pessoas. Tempo para viver e saúde para vivê-la [a vida] com qualidade\", disse Mariana Mortágua no encerramento da sua intervenção no 13.º Encontro Nacional do Trabalho do BE, que decorreu no Centro de Artes e Ofícios de Ovar (distrito de Aveiro).\nEm causa está uma petição, lançada no endereço do partido trabalhoporturnos.bloco.org, dirigida ao presidente da Assembleia da República, José Pedro Aguiar-Branco, que visa a mudança na lei.\n\"Lançamos uma petição a exigir uma coisa muito simples, que é tempo e saúde para todas as pessoas que trabalham por turnos\", materializada em medidas como subsídio de turno obrigatório, dois fins de semana a cada seis semanas para poder conciliar o trabalho com a sua vida familiar, descanso de 24 horas entre cada turno, limitação de 35 horas semanais de trabalho ou reforma antecipada com seis meses \"por cada ano que passa com a vida ao contrário do relógio, por cada ano que passa no ritmo contrário ao do resto da sociedade e da sua família\", enumerou Mariana Mortágua.\nEstes trabalhadores \"trabalham nos hospitais, na segurança, na indústria vidreira, na indústria automóvel, em 'call centers' ou até em empresas que fazem batatas fritas ou rolhas de cortiça\", descreveu Mortágua, sendo \"800 mil pessoas que têm a mesma experiência de viver ao contrário do relógio\".\n\"Sabem o que é ser dia de Natal e não estarem com os filhos. Sabem o que é passar as férias, os momentos de família, longe de quem mais gostam\", além de não terem \"tempo para estar, para combinar, para ter uma vida familiar\".\nSegundo a coordenadora do BE, estes trabalhadores vão para a reforma \"na verdade, muito mais velhos que todos os outros, apesar de terem exatamente a mesma idade, porque o desgaste dos turnos, do trabalho noturno, de ter a vida sempre em contrarrelógio, conta e tira anos de vida e vida com saúde\".\nTambém há trabalhadores que não necessitariam de trabalhar por turnos porque \"há empresas que não têm que estar em laboração contínua\", visando o BE \"alterar os critérios que o determinam\", disse Mariana Mortágua.\nPara a deputada, estas 800 mil pessoas \"tudo o que esperam e exigem é serem recompensados pelo seu trabalho, pelo seu esforço\", pretendendo a coordenadora do BE que, através da petição, façam \"ouvir a sua voz a exigir uma alteração da lei\".\n\"Se toda a gente que partilha a experiência do que é viver a vida ao contrário se unir para alterar a lei, então vamos conseguir alterar a lei\", pois \"ninguém cala 800 mil pessoas\", vincou.",

    "text": "Internal rifts increasing in US admin over policy on Israel's Gaza war US official reveals extent of dissent within State Department over Gaza casualties, telling TRT World that staffers affected by loss directly or indirectly are increasingly demanding action in the backdrop of high-profile resignations. Despite unfolding thousands of kilometers away, Israel's ongoing war with Gaza since last October continues to exacerbate divisions within American society and sow discord within President Joe Biden's administration. Whether it is providing billions of dollars in military support to Israel, offering humanitarian aid for Palestinians, or seeking to avoid regional hostilities that may intensify into a wider war — between Israel and Lebanon — Washington is deeply tied to what has been described as an [\"apocalyptic\"](https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/12/1144492) war on Palestinians. \"The distance has not dampened the impact on America,\" a senior US State Department official told TRT World. \"We have staffers whose nephews, nieces, close and distant relatives were killed in Gaza. We hear their complaints. The voices of dissent are growing every day,\" the official said on the condition of anonymity. Following the October 7 Hamas raid on southern Israel, the 266-day war — during which Israel has killed and wounded tens of thousands in Gaza, and laid waste to much of the besieged Palestinian enclave — has seen mass demonstrations in America, many of them led by Jewish groups, self-immolation protests, die-in sit-ins, arrest of students and scholars, surge in anti-Muslim attacks and anti-Semitism, limitations on free speech, and a rupture in the Democratic party. Accusing the US president of turning a blind eye to Israeli atrocities in the blockaded Palestinian territory, many US administration officials have quit in protest while others continue to build pressure within the system. \"I have never seen anything like this before in my 20 years of working with the US administration. The sheer scale of devastation and loss of lives in Gaza is mind-blowing,\" said the US official who has seen some colleagues quit the State Department to protest Washington's backing for Israel and its failure to bring about a long-lasting ceasefire. Surge of resignations Josh Paul, Director of the State Department's Bureau of Political Military Affairs, [resigned](https://www.trtworld.com/us-and-canada/us-ignores-israeli-war-crimes-in-gaza-for-domestic-politics-ex-official-15844344) in October last year in the first publicly known resignation, citing Washington's \"blind support\" for Tel Aviv. [Harrison Mann](https://www.trtworld.com/middle-east/us-army-major-quits-citing-guilt-for-contributing-to-gaza-mass-killings-18148699), a US Army Major and Defence Intelligence Agency official, resigned a month later in November. He cited \"guilt\" for contributing to Gaza mass killings and went public with his reasons to resign in May this year. In January, [Tariq Habash](https://www.trtworld.com/middle-east/second-biden-admin-official-quits-over-us-support-for-israeli-war-in-gaza-16523422), a US-Palestinian, resigned as Special Assistant in the Education Department's office of Planning, citing Biden administration's approach to the Gaza war and its failure to halt what he termed as Israel's \"collective punishment tactics.\" Then in March, [Annelle Sheline](https://www.trtworld.com/us-and-canada/in-tears-annelle-sheline-says-could-not-stay-silent-over-gaza-carnage-17574752)'s resignation from the State Department's Human Rights Bureau made global headlines and underscored her refusal to remain \"complicit\" in what she said was an unjust US policy towards Gaza. In April, [Hala Rharrit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MmqTjiC91I), an Arabic language spokesperson for the State Department, called it a day \"in opposition to the US' Gaza policy.\" Rharrit, who quit the US administration after 18 years of service, told TRT World in an interview that \"Israel was committing genocide\" in Gaza and US cannot escape \"complicity\" in this crime. In May, [Lily Greenberg Call](https://www.trtworld.com/us-and-canada/jewish-staffer-quits-over-bidens-support-for-israels-genocide-in-gaza-18163037), a Special Assistant to the Chief of Staff in the US Interior Department, quit, accusing President Biden of using Jews to justify US policy in Israel's war. \"He is making Jews the face of the American war machine. And that is so deeply wrong,\" Call said, noting that her ancestors were killed by \"state-sponsored violence.\" [Alexander Smith](https://www.trtworld.com/middle-east/live-blog-israel-kills-paramedics-palestinian-civilians-in-gaza-strikes-18167728), a contractor for US foreign aid agency, USAID, quit in late May, alleging censorship after the aid agency annulled publication of his presentation on maternal and child mortality among Palestinians. \"I can no longer in good conscience continue to be silent amidst USAID’s de facto policy of ignoring human suffering when that suffering is perpetrated by an ally [Israel],\" Smith wrote in his resignation letter to Samantha Power, Administrator of USAID. [Stacy Gilbert](https://www.trtworld.com/us-and-canada/another-senior-state-official-resigns-over-bidens-gaza-war-policy-18167435), who served in the US State Department's Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration as Senior Civilian-Military Advisor, resigned in late May. Gilbert reportedly accused the State Department of being wrong to conclude that Israel had not obstructed humanitarian assistance to besieged Palestinians of Gaza. In June, [Andrew Miller](https://www.trtworld.com/us-and-canada/andrew-miller-state-dept-expert-on-israel-palestine-quits-over-gaza-war-18175663), the US State Dept expert on Israel-Palestine affairs, resigned over war on Gaza. The resignation of Miller, a high-ranking official in Israel-Palestine policy, is notable, signifying a major change and showing the depth of discontent within the Biden administration over its policy on the war. 'Difficult and complex' The State Department official TRT World spoke with said several expressions of dissent including demands for immediate ceasefire in Gaza continue to make their way to the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. \"He [Blinken] is aware of the situation inside the department. And since he is one of the 15 members of Biden's cabinet, the US president too is cognisant of it,\" the official said, acknowledging Blinken alone cannot change the Biden administration's policy on the conflict. The official said Biden's three-phase truce deal, dubbed by the US president as a \"road map to an enduring ceasefire and the release of all hostages\", could pacify the tensions within the US administration but also admitted convincing Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu on the deal the way US sees it \"has been difficult and complex\". Biden has described the deal as an Israeli decision and thousands of Israelis have been demonstrating for months to support it, but Netanyahu has been defiant, saying what has been presented by the US publicly is not accurate and that Tel Aviv is still committed to continuing the war until destroying Hamas — something many experts have called a far-fetched goal. Netanyahu's far-right allies, too, have threatened to collapse his government if he implements the plan to reach a permanent ceasefire. This week Netanyahu reiterated his position, telling a local pro-government channel he will only be willing to agree to a \"partial\" ceasefire deal that would not end the war. \"We are committed to continuing the war after a pause, to complete the goal of eliminating Hamas. I'm not willing to give up on that,\" Netanyahu said. The US official told TRT World that Netanyahu's government is on shaky ground as his far-right allies could topple it if he proceeds with a permanent ceasefire plan. \"It has been hard to convince Netanyahu who is facing threats from his far-right alliances,\" the official said, worried that Israel's war on Gaza now threatens to spill over into Lebanon and beyond.",

    "text": "El [Centro de Pronósticos del Instituto de Meteorología (Insmet)](http://www.insmet.cu/asp/genesis.asp?TB0=PLANTILLAS&TB1=INICIAL) emitió el Aviso de Alerta Temprana No. 2 sobre la ocurrencia de lluvias y tormentas eléctricas en el occidente del país. El aviso destaca que un nuevo frente frío se formará hoy viernes sobre el golfo de México, avanzando hacia el Este y aproximándose al occidente de Cuba. Por delante de este sistema se desarrollará una banda prefrontal, que avanzará rápidamente hacia la mayor de las Antillas y provocará un deterioro del tiempo en la región occidental. Los nublados que acompañan esta banda prefrontal con fuerte actividad de chubascos y tormentas eléctricas, avanzarán hacia el este sobre la mitad occidental de Cuba durante la noche del viernes 22 y la madrugada del sábado 23. Con el avance de este sistema ocurrirán chubascos, lluvias y tormentas eléctricas, que pueden ser fuertes e intensas en algunas localidades del occidente. En áreas de chubascos y lluvias pueden producirse rachas de vientos fuertes, caída de granizos y fuerte actividad eléctrica, así como inundaciones en zonas bajas y de mal drenaje. El Insmet no descarta que de forma aislada puedan ocurrir otros eventos severos. Agrega la nota que el frente frío llegará en la tarde-noche del sábado 23 a la región occidental y también generará a su paso chubascos lluvias y algunas tormentas eléctricas. Esta situación meteorológica se trasladará posteriormente hacia las provincias centrales y llegará más debilitada a la región oriental el domingo 24. El Centro de Pronósticos mantiene una estrecha vigilancia sobre esta situación meteorológica y emitirá informaciones relacionadas en los Pronósticos del Tiempo y Avisos Especiales que lo requieran.",
